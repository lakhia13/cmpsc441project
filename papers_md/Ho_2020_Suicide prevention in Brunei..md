Brunei Darussalam is a small country in
Southeast Asia with a conservative Islamic
government and culture. Suicide is a criminal
offence under the civil Penal Code and the
newly implemented sharia Penal Code. Suicide
and mental illness are associated with
signiﬁcant stigma. Public discussion about
suicide and mental illness has been considered
taboo for many years. Recently, increased
rates of media-reported suicides caused
signiﬁcant public alarm. This paper describes
the initial steps that have been taken and
possible future strategies for suicide
prevention. The complex issues affecting
suicide prevention in the national context are
discussed.

Brunei is a developing country that scores highly
in economic, health and social indicators. It is a
member of
the Commonwealth and was a
British protectorate until 1984. Of the population
of 421 300, 65.8% belong to the predominantly
Muslim Malay ethnic group, 10.2% identify as
Chinese and 23.9% belong to ‘other’ ethnic
groups made up of Indigenous tribes and foreign
residents.1 The government system is a monarchy
and the Sultan of Brunei is the head of govern-
ment. Brunei is a member state of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Western Paciﬁc
Region. Healthcare services are provided by the
government free of charge to all citizens. Mental
healthcare services have undergone a period of
development over the past decade.2 New mental
health legislation has been implemented to
improve the treatment, care and welfare of people
affected by mental disorders.3 However, signiﬁ-
cant challenges remain. Brunei has a religiously
and culturally conservative society. Mental disor-
ders are highly stigmatised and beliefs about spir-
itual ‘uncleanliness’ are prevalent. People avoid
seeking help for mental health problems.4 There
are indications that the economy is slowing and
unemployment rates are rising. Within this con-
text, the country recently experienced an increase
in suicides reported in the local media.

Mental health services in Brunei
Mental health treatment
is provided free of
charge to all citizens in government-funded pri-
mary and secondary healthcare facilities through-
out the country. The main specialist psychiatric
facility is on a community site near the capital

city, which houses in-patient, out-patient and
rehabilitation services. There are 10 psychiatric
beds per 100 000 population. Routine waiting
times for a psychiatric appointment are under
1 month. Emergency psychiatric assessments are
available in accident and emergency departments
and walk-in services. Brunei has 1.7 specialist psy-
chiatrists per 100 000 population compared with
1.6 psychiatrists per 100 000 population in the
Western Paciﬁc region5 and 2.6 psychiatrists per
100 000 population in Singapore, the country
with the highest rate of psychiatrists in the
region.6 There is a post-graduate training pro-
gramme available, which aims to increase the
number of psychiatrists. There are 4.8 psycholo-
gists per 100 000 population working in the
government sector. Private psychology services
are also available. Selected antidepressant and
antipsychotic medications,
including oral and
injectable atypical antipsychotics, are available in
government pharmacies. A larger medication list
is available in a psychiatric clinic within a local pri-
vate hospital.

The prevalence of mental disorders in
Brunei
There have not been any epidemiological studies
of mental disorders in Brunei. However, it is pos-
sible to estimate the treatment prevalence for
mental disorders as an indication of the propor-
tion of people receiving treatment from mental
health services. The government has implemen-
ted a national electronic health records system
for all government healthcare services
since
2012. As the government is the main healthcare
provider, these electronic records are likely to
cover most of the population. Data for all health-
care consultations recorded from October 2018 to
October 2019 was used to calculate the number of
patients who were given a mental health diagnosis
by a health practitioner, as an estimate of the
1-year treatment prevalence. The rates for schizo-
phrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorder
(ICD-10 codes F20–F29); mania and bipolar
disorder (ICD-10 codes F31 and F32); and
depression and other mood disorders (ICD-10
codes F32–F39) were 580.2, 134.8 and 265.9
per 100 000 population, respectively. These ﬁgures
are likely to be overestimates given that they include
diagnoses made in primary and secondary health-
care facilities. Nevertheless, they compare favour-
ably with treatment prevalence rates reported by
high-income countries.5

Suicide as a public health problem
The WHO has identiﬁed suicide as a major public
health problem. Suicide prevention is a target of
the WHO 2013–2020 Mental Health Action
Plan. Traditionally, suicide was seen as a mental
health problem to be managed by clinical inter-
ventions such as treatment for depression. More
recently,
public health
approach using population-based strategies has
been suggested to be more effective.7 Reducing
the risk for the whole population may have a
greater effect, as suicide has been shown to be
caused by the complex interaction of biological,
social, cultural, economic, environmental, psycho-
logical and behavioural factors.8 It is not clear
which strategies would be most effective within
Brunei’s national sociocultural and legal context.

Suicide rates in Brunei
Suicide rates are susceptible to procedural and
sociocultural practices.8 The WHO Western
Paciﬁc Region has reported an age-standardised
suicide rate of 8.4 (9.5 for males, 7.5 for females)
per 100 000 population.5 Unfortunately, research
in Brunei is hampered by the strong cultural
taboo associated with suicide and mental illness.
There are multiple difﬁculties
in ensuring
adequate data collection. Suicide and attempted
suicides are classiﬁed as criminal offences and
often thought of as sinful. This makes the com-
munity reluctant to report deaths as suicides.
Consent
for post-mortem examinations are
often declined by family members. However,
post-mortems are required to investigate the
sudden deaths of foreign nationals. There has
only been one published study on suicides in
the country.9 This retrospective study evaluated
124 suicides that were brought by the police to
the state pathologist for post-mortem assess-
ment over a 20-year period. Foreign citizens
made up the majority. Hanging was the most
common method.

Recently, Brunei experienced an apparent
increase in completed suicides reported by the
police in local media. There was considerable gov-
ernment and public interest. Data reported with
permission from the Royal Brunei Police Force
showed an apparent increase in the national sui-
cide rate from 1.9 per 100 000 population in
2015 to 3.6 per 100 000 population in 2018.
However because of the absence of a systematic
suicide inquiry system, it is not clear if these ﬁg-
ures represent the actual suicide rates in the
country. Hanging was the predominant method,
occurring in 41 out of 44 cases recorded between
2015 and 2018, and 30 (68%) cases were foreign
citizens. This may be related to the presence of
many foreign low-income workers in the country.

Rapid ﬁrst response: setting up a mental
health crisis helpline
There was increased public discussion about men-
tal health and suicide. Social media users started

asking for a telephone helpline. Although many
telephone helpline services are operated by non-
internationally,
organisations
governmental
Brunei does not have a developed system of non-
governmental organisations
to do this. The
Ministry of Health leadership decided to set up
a telephone helpline operated by health profes-
sionals as a ﬁrst response, to be supported by a
nationwide mental health policy. A team was
sent to neighbouring Singapore to observe the
mental health crisis helpline operated by the
Institute of Mental Health. It was decided that
this model would be a ‘good ﬁt’ and that some
people would prefer using a telephone helpline
as an initial step into mental health services.
The common aims of mental health crisis help-
lines are to provide conﬁdential out-of-hours sup-
port, crisis resolution and specialist advice.10 This
new service was developed with similar aims. After
a period of staff training, preparation and publi-

Media reporting
News reports of suicides often published personal
details, videos or photographs of dead victims and
their surroundings. Unfortunately, these details
were widely shared on social media. A multi-
agency press conference chaired by the Ministry
of Health was held in August 2018 and media
organisations were advised to ensure responsible
reporting, to respect victims and the bereaved
and to reduce the risk of suicide contagion.
Media reporting improved signiﬁcantly after
this. However, there are no existing regulations
or laws to ensure responsible reporting or to dis-
courage the dissemination of
inappropriate
material on social media.

Challenges
People with mental health problems are often
reluctant to speak out for fear of stigma and dis-
crimination. High risk groups,
the
LGBT+ community, substance misusers, children
in care and prisoners, can be difﬁcult to access.
There is no antidiscrimination legislation to
ensure access to education and employment for
people with mental disorders or special needs.
There are no patient advocacy services. Thus, it
may be difﬁcult to conduct population needs
assessments. The police are often involved in ser-
ious self-harming incidents that are reported in
the community or that present to emergency ser-
vices. This can make it intimidating for people to
seek help and arguably worsens stigma and dis-
tress. Health services ﬁnd themselves dealing
with clients who have different
the
patient and the criminal justice system. The crim-
inal procedures relating to mentally disordered
offenders are lengthy and may result in a long
period of detention.14 Nevertheless, most suicide
attempts are not pursued in court. Although
hanging appears to be the most common method
of suicide, other less obvious methods may be
overlooked because of the absence of a systematic
suicide inquiry system.

interests;

Sustainability
Any meaningful change will require substantial
community and individual engagement. Current
efforts rely on already stretched government clin-
ical services and personnel to design and imple-
ment strategies. However, most clinicians do not
have speciﬁc training in conducting population-
based research or in designing and implementing
public policy. Signiﬁcant
investment will be
required in community outreach, human resource,
research and data systems, to ensure the sustain-
ability of any policy.

The way forward
Despite many challenges, Brunei has made some
progress in suicide prevention. Establishing a tele-
phone helpline service was a signiﬁcant ﬁrst step.
The development of a sustainable national mental
health policy should be a priority. Establishing a
systematic suicide inquiry system would improve
research accuracy. Legislative support would

protect vulnerable people and ensure access to
treatment. Ensuring the sustainable implementa-
tion of an effective suicide prevention plan will
require national commitment.
