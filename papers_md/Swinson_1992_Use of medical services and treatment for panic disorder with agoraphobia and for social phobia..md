Use of medical services and treatment for panic
disorder with agoraphobia and for social phobia

Richard P. Swinson, MD, FRCPC; Brian J. Cox, MA; Carolyn B. Woszczyna, BA (Hons)

Objective: To examine the medical services and treatment for anxiety disorders reported
by patients who had either panic disorder with agoraphobia or else social phobia.
Design: Archival research of consecutive records of psychiatric interviews conducted
between January 1990 and December 1991. The records were examined by a trained
research assistant who had had no contact with the patients.
Patients: One hundred patients who had panic disorder with agoraphobia and
twenty-eight patients who had social phobia.
Setting: An anxiety disorders clinic in a university-affiliated psychiatric institute.
Outcome measures: Variables related to the use of medical services included history of
hospitalization, emergency department visits and referrals to specialists. Variables
related to treatment included types of medication received, whether behaviour therapy
was received and types of health care professionals seen.
Results: Almost 30% of the patients with panic disorder and more than 20% of those
with social phobia had a history of a major depressive episode at some time in their
lives; 30% and 25% respectively had a current nonpsychiatric medical diagnosis. In the
past year nearly one-third of both patient groups had seen three or more different health
care professionals and almost one-fifth of those with panic disorder had gone to a
general hospital emergency department. Of the patients with panic disorder 9% had
previously been assessed by a cardiologist and 17% by a neurologist. At least two-thirds
of each group had received benzodiazepines, often for use as needed. Although most of
the patients in both groups had been seen by mental health professionals such as
psychiatrists, few had received optimal treatment. Of those with panic disorder, only
15% had received the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, 13% alprazolam and 11%
cognitive-behavioural therapy. Only 4% of the patients with social phobia had received
cognitive-behavioural therapy.
Conclusions: Both groups of patients, and particularly those with panic disorder, are
frequent users of medical services. Although most have had contact with mental health
professionals, few have received appropriate treatment. Benzodiazepines appear to be
overprescribed, whereas forms of treatment that have been shown to reduce the use of
medical services, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, are infrequently given.

examines par un adjoint de recherche chevronne qui n'a eu aucun contact avec les
patients.
Patients: Cent patients atteints de troubles de panique avec agoraphobie et vingt-huit
patients atteints de phobie sociale.
Contexte: Clinique de troubles anxieux dans un institut psychiatrique affilie a une
universite.
Mesures des resultats: Les variables liees au recours aux services medicaux compre-
la
naient les antecedents d'hospitalisation,
consultation de specialistes. Les variables liees au traitement comprenaient les types de
medicaments recus, l'administration ou la non-administration d'une therapie comporte-
mentale et les types de professionnels de soins de sante consultes.
Resultats: Presque 30 % des patients atteints d'un trouble de panique et plus de 20 %
des patients atteints d'une phobie sociale avaient deja fait une depression majeure a un
moment donne de leur vie; 30 % et 25 % respectivement des patients avaient un dossier
medical non psychiatrique courant. Au cours de l'annee ecoulee, presque le tiers des
deux groupes de patients avaient consulte au moins trois professionnels differents des
soins de sante et presque le cinquieme de ceux qui souffraient d'un trouble de panique
s'etaient presentes a un service d'urgence d'un h6pital general. Parmi les patients
examines auparavant par un
souffrant d'un trouble de panique, 9 % avaient e
cardiologue et 17 % par un neurologue. Au moins deux tiers des patients de chaque
groupe avaient recu des benzodiazepines, souvent a prendre au besoin. Meme si la
plupart des patients des deux groupes avaient consulte des professionnels de la sante
mentale comme des psychiatres, tres peu avaient recu un traitement optimal. Parmi
15 % seulement avaient recu de
ceux qui souffraient d'un trouble de panique,
l'imipramine, antidepresseur tricyclique, 13 % de l'alprazolam et 11 % une therapie
cognitive du comportement. Seulement 4 % des patients atteints de phobie sociale
avaient recu une therapie cognitive du comportement.
Conclusions: Les deux groupes de patients, et particulierement ceux qui souffrent d'un
trouble de panique, sont de frequents consommateurs de services medicaux. Meme si la
plupart ont eu des contacts avec des professionnels de la sante mentale, peu ont recu un
traitement approprie. On semble surprescrire des benzodiazepines, tandis que l'on
administre peu souvent des traitements qui ont fait leurs preuves pour reduire la
consommation de services medicaux, comme la therapie cognitive du comportement.

R esults from studies in the United States
suggest that patients with panic disorder are
frequent users of health care services, either
specialty or general,' and yet seldom receive appro-
priate treatment.2 They often have a high level of
somatization and hypochondriacal fears regarding
the panic attacks, and there is evidence that this
hypochondriasis lessens with successful anxiolytic
treatment.3'4

Behavioural psychotherapy for panic and agora-
phobia has been shown to reduce the use of health
care services by these patients.5'6 For example,
Bowen and colleagues5 found that patients who
completed a trial of behavioural group therapy for
panic disorder with agoraphobia reduced their yearly
visits to general practitioners by about 40%.

Unfortunately, most patients with panic disor-
der do not receive specialty treatment and often do
not have their problem correctly diagnosed by their
general physician.7 A US study found that fewer than
15% of almost 800 volunteers for panic disorder
research had previously received appropriate be-
haviour therapy or the tricyclic antidepressant im-
ipramine,2 and the little information available on
past treatment received by Canadian patients is not

encouraging. In a survey of Canadian hospitals, only
15% reported having an anxiety disorders clinic.8
Finally, US epidemiologic data suggest that, un-
treated, panic disorder may become associated with
poor quality of life (e.g., alcoholism9 and suicide
attempts'0), which can lead to even greater health
care demands.

The purpose of the study described here was to
document the types of medical services and anxiety
treatment received by patients with panic disorder in
Canada. We also studied a group of patients with
social phobia, because most of the previous studies
have not examined anxiety disorders other than
panic disorder.

Patients and methods

The samples consisted of 100 consecutive pa-
tients who had panic disorder with agoraphobia and
28 consecutive patients who had social phobia. The
diagnoses were based on the criteria of the Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, third
edition, revised (DSM-III-R)."I The DSM-III-R de-
fines panic disorder with agoraphobia as a condition
characterized by severe, unexpected anxiety attacks,

often accompanied by worry over future attacks, and
a fear of being in situations from which escape might
be difficult or help not easy to obtain in the event of
a panic attack. Social phobia is defined as a persis-
tent fear of being in situations in which one is
exposed to possible scrutiny by others and fears
doing something that will be embarrassing or even
humiliating.

All the patients had presented to an anxiety
disorders clinic and had given written consent that
the information they provided be used for research
purposes. All had voluntarily completed the State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory,'2 the Fear Questionnaire,'3
the Beck Depression Inventory'4 and the Mobility
Inventory for Agoraphobia."5 Variables of interest
had been recorded during semistructured psychiatric
interviews conducted by a psychiatrist with 20 years
of experience in anxiety disorders.

Only patients seen within the previous 2 years
(January 1990 through December 1991) were includ-
ed in the study, because many current treatments for
anxiety disorders did not exist several years ago.
Each patient record was independently reviewed and
coded for past medical services and treatment by a
research assistant who had had no contact with the
patient. In addition to the current diagnosis of either
panic disorder with agoraphobia or social phobia,
any other diagnoses (e.g., major depressive episode)
at some time in the patient's life were noted, as was
the presence of panic attacks. Panic attacks are
defined by DSM-III-R criteria as discrete episodes of
intense fear accompanied by feelings of impending
doom with symptoms such as dyspnea, depersonali-
zation and fears of dying or doing something uncon-
trolled. Patients who were poor historians (less than
10) were not included in the study.

Results

The percentages in the tables are based on the
numbers of patients for which the information in
the record was clear enough to provide an answer to
the applicable question.

Characteristics ofthe samples

The mean age of the patients with panic disor-
der (29 men, 71 women) was 33.4 (standard devia-
tion [SD] 9.5) years. The mean age of the patients
with social phobia (20 men, 8 women) was 32.3 (SD
9.8) years.

The Fear Questionnaire demonstrated mean
scores of 15.1 (SD 10.2) for agoraphobia in the
patients with panic disorder and 19.3 (SD 9.1) for
social fears in the patients with social phobia, scores
similar to those obtained in other samples of pa-
tients with phobias.'6 Both groups scored in the
dysphoric range of the Beck Depression Inventory,
the means being 18.9 (SD 10.7) and 16.7 (SD 7.9)
respectively. Panic attacks within the past month
were reported by 90% of the patients who had panic
disorder with agoraphobia and 71% of the patients
who had social phobia.

The medical history of the two groups of pa-

tients was similar (Table 1).

Medical services

Table 2 presents the types of medical services
sought for anxiety complaints by the two groups of
patients. Nearly one-third of both patient groups had
seen three or more different health care professionals
within the past year. When the social phobia group

was subdivided into those with and those without
was subdivided into those with and those without
panic attacks none of the rates changed substantially.

Anxiety treatment

Table 3 presents the types of treatment received
for anxiety complaints by the two groups of patients.
At least two-thirds of each group had received
benzodiazepines. The presence of panic attacks in
the patients with social phobia had not affected the
nature of the treatment. Few patients in either group
had received cognitive-behavioural therapy, whereas
most had received some type of psychoactive medi-
cation.

The male patients with panic disorder were
more likely than the female patients to report treat-
ment with benzodiazepines other than alprazolam
(x2 = 5.43, one degree of freedom, p < 0.02). This
was the only significant difference between the sexes
that emerged from the study, but it was not a large
difference, particularly given the number of compar-
isons.

Discussion

The results of this study indicate that patients
with panic disorder and to a lesser extent patients
with social phobia report a variety of physical and
psychiatric problems (e.g., major depression) and are
frequent users of the health care system. These
findings are consistent with data collected in the
United States"9 showing that a diagnosis of panic
disorder is associated with a greater likelihood of

alcohol abuse and more use of health services,
including those of emergency departments, than is a
diagnosis of major depression or neither diagnosis.
The results are also consistent with recently pub-
lished data provided by an Ontario sample of 354
general practitioners and family physicians who
completed a survey on 50 consecutive patients pre-
senting to each of their practices.'7 Patients with a
diagnosis of anxiety or a stress condition accounted
for 7.0% of the 16 125 encounters resulting in a
diagnosis and 9.76% of the estimated $1.6 billion in
expenditures. Almost 30% of the patients with anx-
iety received a prescription. These figures are proba-
bly underestimates, because many patients with an
anxiety disorder present with cardiologic or neuro-
logic complaints and are referred to specialists be-
fore an organic problem is ruled out. Almost 30% of
the patients with panic disorder in our study had
been assessed by a cardiologist or a neurologist or
both, and 21% had presented to a general hospital
emergency department, 19% in the past year.

These observations suggest that patients with
anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder, are
unsuccessfully seeking relief from their symptoms
through the general medical system. This unneces-
sary use of health care services could be reduced by
more immediate and accurate diagnosis of the anx-
iety disorder and appropriate intervention. Patients
with panic attacks presenting to general hospital
emergency departments can be successfully treated
with brief behaviour therapy,'8 and early recognition
of an anxiety disorder in general practice is associat-
ed with a shorter episode duration.7

Our findings also show that even when treated
by mental health specialists few patients with anx-
iety are receiving appropriate treatment, and many
have taken several medications. Despite limited effi-
cacy and problems associated with discontinuation,
benzodiazepines are by far the drugs most comm-
only prescribed for both panic and social phobia.
Among the patients in our study who had panic
disorder with agoraphobia, only 15% had received
imipramine, 13% alprazolam and 11% cognitive-
behavioural therapy, all of which have empirically
been found to be efficacious. Similarly, only 4% of
the patients with social phobia had received cog-
nitive-behavioural therapy, although almost two-
thirds had received benzodiazepines. These findings
are even more surprising given that almost one-third
of the patients had had three or more contacts with
different health care professionals in the past year
and almost two-thirds had seen a psychiatrist. Many

of the 40% with panic disorder who received tricyclic
antidepressants other than imipramine may have
received some benefit; however, only the use of
imipramine has empiric support from numerous
studies. '9

The underuse of effective forms of treatment for
panic disorder with agoraphobia has been observed
outside Canada as well,2 and our results suggest that
this pattern holds true for social phobia. Our finding
that many patients in both groups reported receiving
psychotherapy or psychoanalysis with apparently
little lasting effect is not surprising given the limited
efficacy of these forms of therapy for anxiety disor-
ders.2012'

Although we excluded patients who were poor
historians, this was an archival study relying on
retrospective data, and it is certainly possible that
some patients did not remember all the treatments
they had received.

In summary, the results of this study strongly
suggest that patients with anxiety disorders, particu-
larly panic disorder, are frequent users of health care
services in Canada, and this may be partially ex-
plained by the fact that few have received appropri-
ate treatment. Education regarding early recognition
and intervention is needed for general and emergen-
cy department physicians, who are often the first
point of contact for patients with anxiety disorders.
Seminars on the different types of anxiety disorders
and corresponding treatments as well as on standard-
ized methods of assessment to ensure accurate diag-
nosis2223 would likely be of benefit and reduce the
currently widespread use of nonspecific agents (ben-
zodiazepines), which may be due to a lack of
diagnostic specificity.24 Simply giving a few minutes
of exposure instructions (cognitive-behavioural ther-
apy) to patients with panic disorder can significantly
reduce their phobic avoidance.'8
