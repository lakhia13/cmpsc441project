Abstract 
Background  University students often face mental health challenges, exacerbated by stigmas that hinder seeking 
support and treatment. We introduce a participatory arts programme, Movin’ and Groovin’ for Wellness (MGW), that fea-
tures facilitated drumming and dancing sessions. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the MGW programme 
on students’ mental health, social connections, and creativity.

Methods  A 10-week pilot parallel Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted with 76 participants randomly 
assigned into an Experimental (MGW) group (N= 38) or a Control group (N= 38). Data were collected at baseline, 
midway, and post-intervention. Mental health was evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale- 21 
(DASS-21), and quality of life via the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) scale. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale, 
Lubben Social Networking scale, Experience of Creation scale, and Brief Music in Mood Regulation scale (B-MMR) 
were also administered. Qualitative feedback was gathered through a bespoke survey and focus group discussion 
(FGD), focusing on participants’ subjective experiences of the programme, mood/emotion states, social connections, 
and creative expression.

Results  The MGW programme led to significant improvements in mental health, quality of life, and creativity, 
while the Control group experienced significant declines in mental health and quality of life over the same 10-week 
period (coinciding with term time). The Experimental group showed significant reductions in Stress scores (DASS-21) 
at Week 10, whereas the Control group had significantly worse anxiety, depression, and stress at Week 5, with stress 
scores remaining elevated at Week 10. Improvements in the Experimental group were also observed in the Psycho-
logical (at Week 5) and Physical (at Week 10) domains of the WHOQOL-BREF. In comparison, the Control group showed 
a significant decrease in WHOQOL-BREF Physical scores at Week 10. The Experimental group also showed enhanced 
creativity (Experience of Creation scale) at Week 5 and Week 10, although no significant changes were observed 
in the social networking or resilient coping scales. Qualitative findings highlighted the programme’s positive impacts 
on participants’ mental health, social connections, and creativity.

Conclusions  The MGW programme effectively improved mental health, quality of life, social connection and creative 
expression among university students. These findings suggest that arts-based interventions such as MGW can sup-
port student health and well-being in a stigma-free and culturally appropriate manner.

Introduction
The  world  is  struggling  with  a  mental  health  crisis. 
According to the WHO, in the first year of the COVID- 
19 pandemic alone, the global prevalence of anxiety and 
depression increased by a staggering 25%.1 In addition to 
limitations regarding the ability to work and receive sup-
port  from  loved  ones,  WHO  suggests  that  another  pri-
mary explanation for this massive surge in mental health 
issues  is  due  to  social  isolation  and  loneliness.  Mean-
while,  Southeast  Asia  has  not  been  immune  to  this  rise 
in  mental  health  conditions  [1],  and  students  have  been 
identified as an at-risk population. Even before the pan-
demic,  the  highest  incidence  of  mental  illness  in  Singa-
pore was found in the population between the ages of 18 
and 24 years old [2].

Indeed,  universities  around  the  world  have  been  roll-
ing out new mental health initiatives to address the rising 
levels of stress and anxiety among students. While these 
efforts aim to increase access to mental health resources 
and encourage help-seeking behaviors, students are often 
reluctant to seek help due to the stigma associated with 
mental  health  issues  [3–5].  This  reluctance  mirrors  a 
broader  trend  observed  in  the  current  study’s  location, 
where  an  alarming  78.6%  of  adults  aged  18  and  older 
were found to refrain from seeking treatment for at least 
12 months despite being diagnosed with a mental illness 
[6].  This  is  where  creative  arts-based  programmes  to 
support mental health can play a crucial role: an impor-
tant facet of music and dance-based interventions is that 
there is no mental health stigma attached to participating 
in such programmes [7].

The  recent  pandemic  solidified  the  crucial  role  of  the 
arts  and  music  in  helping  individuals  and  communities 
reconnect and regain a sense of wellness. Even during the 
first  waves  of  the  pandemic,  quarantined  Italians  leaned 
out of their windows to bellow out tunes together, which 
served  to  decrease  their  sense  of  loneliness,  increase 
social cohesion, and improve mental well-being [8]. Now 
that concerts and arts events are again in full swing, cre-
ative-arts initiatives can be leveraged to promote mental 
wellness and social connection.

alence of anxiety and depression worldwide”. Retrieved from: https:// www.

Research  studies  in  health  and  epidemiology  have 
shown  that  participating  in  arts  and  cultural  activities 
enhances  mental  health,  well-being,  immune  response, 
and  a  variety  of  other  health  outcomes  [9–11].  Music 
specifically is an extremely effective medium for support-
ing mental, emotional, and social wellness. Participating 
in  music-based  activities,  and  even  passive  listening  to 
carefully  selected  music,  has  been  shown  to  be  effective 
for  reducing  stress,  anxiety  and  depression,  and  elevat-
ing  mood  states  [12,  13].  Work  examining  creative  arts 
therapies has identified several mechanisms that support 
the  therapeutic  effects  of  these  interventions,  including 
embodiment,  active  engagement,  creativity,  group  pro-
cesses  (e.g.,  group  cohesion),  emotion  processing,  and 
more [14]. These mechanisms highlight the value of crea-
tive arts interventions to improve health and well-being.

Drumming  programmes  in  particular,  such  as  the 
10-week group drumming intervention by Fancourt et al. 
[15], have been found to decrease anxiety and depression, 
and shift participants from “a pro-inflammatory towards 
an  anti-inflammatory  immune  profile”,  thereby  demon-
strating both the psychological and biological benefits of 
group  drumming  on  health  [15].  Dancing  has  also  been 
found to improve participants’ mental health by increas-
ing positive mood states and self-esteem, and decreasing 
negative emotions and depression [16, 17].

Music,  dance,  and  other  cultural  activities  have  also 
been  found  to  increase  social  cohesion.  For  example, 
music-based treatments and programmes (such as group 
drumming)  for  mental  health  promote  new  social  con-
nections  between  participants  [15,  18,  19],  and  support 
individuals’  sense  of  identity,  confidence,  and  emotional 
resilience  [20,  21].  Participating  in  a  group  dance  class 
has  been  found  to  facilitate  social  and  community  con-
nectedness  among  participants  [17].  In  addition,  arts, 
music, and dancing activities are very effective for help-
ing  individuals  communicate  both  within  and  across 
groups  [22],  which  helps  contribute  to  a  sense  of  social 
connection and cohesion.

Furthermore,  improvisation,  which  can  be  defined 
as  the  spontaneous  creation  of  music  or  movement, 
has  been  found  to  have  “specific  benefits  for  particular 
populations  including  the  amelioration  of  neurologi-
cal  damage,  improvements  in  mental  health  conditions, 
reductions in stress and anxiety, and improved communi-
cation and joint attention behaviours” in children on the

autism  spectrum  [23].  That  is,  improvisation  has  wide-
spread  benefits  for  health.  Dance  improvisation  encour-
ages self-discovery and creativity, and has been described 
as a powerful tool for helping individuals alter their men-
tal and bodily states to achieve novel forms of emotional 
expression [24], and to release suppressed emotions and 
inner thoughts [25]. Dance programmes involving move-
ment  improvisation  (e.g.,  inventing  creative  movements 
with  no  pre-defined  choreography)  have  been  shown  to 
foster creative expression in STEM students [26].

The  above  evidence  supporting  the  efficacy  of  music 
interventions (and specifically, group drumming), dance/
movement  programmes,  and  improvisation  to  improve 
mental  health  and  social  connection  warrants  a  pro-
gramme that combines all three of these artistic elements 
into one creative intervention for students. To our knowl-
edge, no such programme has been evaluated in the liter-
ature, and the anticipated benefits of such a programme 
are  plentiful.  We  therefore  offer  the  Movin’  &  Groovin’ 
for  Wellness  (MGW)  initiative  as  an  innovative  music-
dance-improvisation  programme.  This  iteration  of  the 
programme aims to bring translational research into the 
university student community, helping students navigate 
their emotional wellness and improve quality of life, facil-
itate  new  social  connections  and  a  sense  of  community, 
and stimulate creative expression.

The aim of the study is to test the programme’s efficacy 
in improving mental health, social connection, and crea-
tive  expression  in  a  Randomised  Controlled  Trial  with 
university students.

Method
Trial design

A  two-armed  randomised  parallel  group  design  was 
employed  to  test  the  aims  and  outcome  measures.  Par-
ticipants  were  randomised  (1:1)  into  either  an  Experi-
mental  (MGW)  group  or  Control  (Life  as  Usual)  group. 
Due  to  logistical  reasons  and  room  capacity,  half  of  the 
students participated in group drumming for the first five 
weeks  (‘Group  A’),  and  the  other  half  engaged  in  group 
dancing for the same period (‘Group B’). During the sec-
ond  five  weeks,  Group  A  participated  in  dancing  activi-
ties and Group B participated in drumming activities. All 
activities took place at the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory 
of Music, at the National University of Singapore (NUS). 
The  Control  group  did  not  participate  in  any  music  or 
dance activities.

Randomisation  (1:1)  was  conducted  by  the  Principal 
Investigator  (PI)  after  participants  provided  informed 
consent to join the study. Participant numbers were first 
listed sequentially. A random number generator in Excel 
was  then  used  to  assign  a  random  number  to  each  par-
ticipant.  The  list  was  sorted  in  ascending  order  based 

on the generated random numbers. The first half of par-
ticipants  in  the  sorted  list  were  allocated  to  the  Experi-
mental group, and the second half were allocated to the 
Control  group.  Group  allocation  was  communicated  by 
the PI to participants during the information session fol-
lowing  consent.  Note  that  this  study  does  not  involve  a 
blinding process due to the nature of the study (a partici-
patory arts intervention). Both participants and research-
ers were aware of the group allocations.

Data  collection  preceded  session  activities  on  Week 
1,  and  followed  the  Week  5  and  Week  10  activities. 
Both  groups  completed  the  same  questionnaires  at  the 
same  time  points.  We  also  invited  MGW  participants 
to  take  part  in  a  Focus  Group  Discussion  (FGD),  which 
was conducted within 10 days of the culmination of the 
programme.  Students  in  the  Control  group  did  not  par-
ticipate in a FGD. Including a Control group allowed the 
research  team  to  assess  the  benefits  of  the  programme 
compared to “normal student life”.

This  study  received  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB) 
ethics  approval  under  the  National  University  of  Singa-
pore  Institutional  Review  Board.  This  study  adhered  to 
CONSORT guidelines.

Recruitment

Recruitment  was  conducted  in  August  and  September, 
2023.  E-posters  were  sent  out  through  social  media,  a 
participant  recruitment  website  from  the  university  was 
utilized, and physical flyers were distributed to advertise 
the study. Interested participants signed up for informa-
tion sessions held by the PI, in which details of the study 
were explained and consent was obtained.

Participants

The  study  setting  was  the  Yong  Siew  Toh  Conservatory 
of  Music  (YSTCM)  at  the  National  University  of  Singa-
pore (NUS), Singapore. All participants in this study were 
students  from  NUS,  and  they  attended  an  information 
session where details of the study were provided and con-
sent was obtained. The eligibility criteria for participating 
in the study are as follows.

The inclusion criteria for the study were to: (1) be cur-
rently enrolled in NUS, (2) be between the ages of 18–40 
years old, (3) be fluent (speaking and writing) in English, 
(4) be able to commit to attending the in-person sessions 
for  the  entire  10-week  period,  and  (5)  have  normal  or 
corrected-to-normal hearing and vision. Those who had 
been diagnosed with neurological or hearing impairment 
or  a  physical  impairment  that  would  prevent  moving/
dancing, or who were taking medicine to treat their men-
tal health, were excluded from the study.

Sample  size  estimation  is  not  typically  required  for 
pilot  studies  [27],  and  was  not  conducted  prior  to  this

intervention.  We  aimed  for  as  large  a  sample  size  as  we 
could accommodate based on the facilitated MGW activ-
ities and dedicated MGW venues.

study participants, including those in the Control group, 
were also provided with a list of mental health resources.

Seventy-six  participants  were  recruited  and  randomly 
allocated  into  two  groups:  Experimental  (N=  38)  and 
Control  (N=  38).  The  Experimental  group  was  further 
divided  into  two  subgroups,  with  one  drop-out  occur-
ring  before  the  study  began,  resulting  in  19  participants 
in Experimental group A, and 18 participants in Experi-
mental  group  B.  The  remaining  seventy-five  partici-

Intervention

In  this  10-week  evidence-based  participatory  arts  pro-
gramme, called Movin’ & Groovin’ for Wellness (MGW), 
we  offered  a  music,  dance,  and  improvisation-based 
approach  to  support  students’  mental,  social,  and  emo-
tional health that has no stigma attached. MGW sessions 
took place weekly over a 10-week period (coinciding with 
term) in dedicated performance rooms, and each session 
was 1.5 hours in duration, with the exception of data col-
lection weeks (e.g., Week 1, Week 5, and Week 10), which 
were  2  hours  long.  Students  from  different  faculties 
around  campus  were  invited  to  participate  in  facilitated 
music and dance sessions with trained professionals, and 
encouraged  to  cultivate  their  creative  expression  using 
these two artistic mediums. Its empirical evaluation will 
not  only  assess  the  initiative’s  impact,  but  will  inform 
best-practice  in  creative  arts-based  programmes  for 
wellness,  and  aims  to  inspire  new  evidence-based  pro-
grammes for students in the future.

Aims for the 10-week Movin’ & Groovin’ for Wellness 

(MGW) programme included: 

1.  Supporting mental and emotional health in NUS stu-
dents  by  decreasing  stress,  anxiety,  and  depression; 
improving  emotion  states;  and  positively  impacting 
quality of life.

2.  Providing  a  dedicated  space  for  creative  expression, 
empowering  students  to  interact  in  artistic  ways 
(through music and dance), and stimulating creativ-
ity and non-verbal communication.

3.  Facilitating social connection between students from 
different faculties to tackle loneliness and promote an 
increased sense of social wellness.

The  Experimental  group  received  the  10-week  MGW 
intervention  described  above,  while  the  Control  partici-
pants  were  offered  their  own  dedicated  MGW  session 
following  the  10-week  study  period,  as  well  as  an  open 
invitation  to  join  future  individual  MGW  sessions.  All 

Outcome measures: mental health, social connection, 
and creativity

To evaluate the efficacy of the programme, our research 
employed a mixed-methods design, utilizing both quan-
titative  scales  and  bespoke  surveys,  as  well  as  a  Focus 
Group Discussion.

The  following  quantitative  measures  were  included  in 

this research: 

1.  Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) [28]: 
To assess mental health, across 3 subscales: Depres-
sion,  Anxiety,  and  Stress  (7  items  each).  Scores  are 
summed for each subscale and multiplied by 2, with 
higher scores indicating worse mental health.

2.  The  WHO  Quality  of  Life  scale  (WHOQOL-BREF) 
[29] : A validated scale to assess quality of life across 
four  domains:  Physical  (7  items),  Psychological  (6 
items),  Social  (3  items),  and  Environment  (8  items). 
Scores  are  mean-centered  and  multiplied  by  4,  with 
higher scores indicating better well-being. Addition-
ally,  two  standalone  items  assess  overall  quality  of 
Life and general Health.

3.  The Brief Resilient Coping Scale [30]: To assess resil-
ience  (4  items),  with  a  summed  score  ranging  from 
4–20. Higher scores reflect greater resilience.

4.  The  Experience  of  Creation  Scale  [31]:  To  assess 
the  impact  of  creative  experiences  (4  items),  with  a 
summed  score  where  higher  scores  indicate  greater 
creative expression.

5.  Short form Lubben Social Networking Scale [32]: To 
quantify  social  networks  and  connections  via  two 
subscales:  Family  (3  items)  and  Friends  (3  items). 
Higher  summed  scores  indicate  greater  social  con-
nectedness.

6.  The Brief Music in Mood Regulation Scale (B-MMR) 
[33]: To assess the use of music for mood and emo-
tion  regulation  across  seven  subscales:  Entertain-
ment,  Revival,  Strong  Sensation,  Diversion,  Dis-
charge,  Mental  Work,  and  Solace  (3  items  each). 
Higher scores reflect more frequent use of each regu-
lation strategy.

All scales have demonstrated good validity and reliability, 
with reported Cronbach’s alpha values generally ranging 
from  0.70  to  0.90  [30,  32–35],  with  the  exception  of  the 
Experience of Creation Scale for which this information 
is not available.

Our primary outcomes are mental health and quality of 
life.  Among  the  scales,  DASS-21  and  WHOQOL-BREF 
were  used  to  assess  the  primary  outcomes,  with  further 

Agres and Chen  BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1628

information  about  the  impact  of  the  intervention  pro-
vided by bespoke surveys and FDG (discussed below); the 
other scales were used to assess the secondary outcomes, 
including social connection, creativity, resilience, and use 
of  music  for  mood  regulation.  These  quantitative  scales 
were administered at baseline, Week 5, and Week 10.

In  addition  to  the  quantitative  measures  listed  above, 
we also employed a bespoke survey at Week 5 and Week 
10 asking about students’ experiences of the programme. 
Questions  were  asked  to  assess  the  participants’  over-
all  feelings  about  the  sessions.  They  were  asked  about 
the  sessions’  impact  on  their  mood  and  how  the  differ-
ent sessions influenced their emotional and social states, 
including  feelings  of  social  connectivity,  engagement, 
judgment,  openness  to  new  experiences,  and  positive 
attitudes.  Questions  also  explored  the  social  benefits  of 
the  sessions,  such  as  increased  social  connectivity  and 
new  friendships.  Learning  outcomes  were  assessed, 
asking  if  participants  learned  new  dancing  or  drum-
ming techniques and had opportunities for creative self-
expression. Emotional awareness was another focus, with 
questions  on  whether  the  sessions  helped  participants 
feel  more  in  touch  with  their  emotions  and  understand 
the  use  of  creative  activities  to  express  feelings.  Most 
questions  in  the  bespoke  survey  used  an  ordinal  rating 
scale.  Examples  of  response  options  include,  “The  ses-
sions significantly improved my mood”, and “The sessions 
significantly worsened my mood”.

Then,  to  better  capture  the  programme’s  impact 
through  lived  experience,  a  voluntary  Focus  Group  Dis-
cussion  was  conducted  after  the  culmination  of  the 
programme.

The  WHOQOL-BREF  scale,  Brief  Resilient  Coping 
Scale  [30],  and  DASS-21  scale  [28]  were  used  to  assess 
the extent to which our programme achieves Aim 1, e.g., 
to  support  NUS  students’  mental  and  emotional  health 
and  quality  of  life.  Qualitative  data  from  the  bespoke 
survey  and  FGD  were  also  collected  to  obtain  a  holistic 
account  of  the  impacts  of  the  programme  on  students 
mental and emotional well-being.

The  bespoke  surveys,  Experience  of  Creation  Scale 
[31],  and  FGD  are  used  to  evaluate  Aim  2,  that  is,  the 
extent to which students feel stimulated and empowered 
to be creative and artistically expressive.

The Lubben Social Networking Scale [32], bespoke sur-
veys, and the FGD are used to evaluate Aim 3, the extent 
to which the MGW programme helped to promote new 
social  interactions,  a  sense  of  social  connection,  and 
decrease  social  isolation  and  loneliness  in  this  student 
sample, as compared to the Control group.

In addition, the Brief Music in Mood Regulation Scale 
(B-MMR)  [33]  is  used  to  examine  whether  the  partici-
pants’ use of music to regulate their moods changed due 

to  participating  the  programme.  For  example,  students 
who tend to use music (as identified via the B-MMR) to 
gain  energy  and  uplift  themselves  (Revival),  to  distract 
themselves  from  unwanted  thoughts  or  feelings  (Diver-
sion),  or  to  seek  strong  emotional  experiences  (Strong 
Sensation)  from  music  may  find  the  programme  to  be 
particularly beneficial for their mental health and reduc-
tion  of  stress/anxiety  (e.g.,  there  may  be  greater  reduc-
tions in DASS-21 measures).

Data analysis

To  analyze  the  data  collected  from  the  validated  scales, 
we  followed  a  structured  approach,  including  a  quan-
titative  within-group  analysis,  between-group  analysis, 
and subgroup analysis. All the analyses were done using 
R  Statistical  Software  (v4.3.2;  R  Core  Team  2023)  [36]. 
Finally,  the  data  analysis  plan  for  the  qualitative  data 
gathered  from  the  bespoke  survey  and  FGD  is  shared 
below.

Within‑group analysis

The within-group analysis was conducted using the Wil-
coxon  Signed  Rank  Test  for  both  the  Experimental  and 
Control groups. This non-parametric test was employed 
to evaluate changes within each group over time by com-
paring baseline measurements with Week 5 and Week 10 
measurements for each outcome measure. This approach 
allowed  us  to  determine  whether  there  were  significant 
changes within each group across the study period.

Between‑group analysis

For the between-group analysis, we calculated difference 
scores  to  reflect  changes  over  time,  and  compared  dif-
ferences  in  these  scores  between  the  Experimental  and 
Control groups. Specifically, we computed two sets of dif-
ference scores:

•  D1: The difference between the baseline and Week 5 

measurements.

•  D2: The difference between the baseline and Week 10 

measurements.

These  difference  scores  were  analyzed  using  the  Mann-
Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon Rank Sum 
Test).  This  non-parametric  test  was  chosen  to  compare 
the distribution of difference scores between the Experi-
mental  and  Control  groups,  allowing  us  to  determine  if 
there were statistically significant differences in outcomes 
between the two groups at these time points.

Subgroup analysis

Finally, we further conducted a subgroup analysis within 
the  Experimental  group  for  group  A  and  group  B.  The 
Mann-Whitney  U  test  was  again  used  to  compare  out-
comes between these two subgroups. The analysis aimed 
to  identify  any  significant  differences  within  the  Experi-
mental  group,  providing  further  insights  into  the  pro-
gramme’s effectiveness, and exploring whether the order 
of activities (e.g., drumming in the first five weeks before 
dancing in the last five weeks) influenced the outcomes.

Effect sizes calculation and interpretation

For  our  non-parametric  analyses,  (i.e.,  the  Wilcoxon 
Rank  Sum  and  Wilcoxon  Signed  Rank  Tests),  we  esti-
mated the effect size using the formula:

r

=

Z
√N

where

(1)

•  Z is the standardized test statistic from the Wilcoxon 

tests, and

•  N is the number of paired observations (for within-
group  tests)  or  the  total  sample  size  (for  between-
group comparisons)

This  method  of  reporting  effect  sizes  is  commonly  used 
in  non-parametric  analyses  [37,  38].  For  within-group 
comparisons, effect sizes in the Experimental group rep-
resent the magnitude of change due to the intervention. 
However,  for  the  Control  group,  the  effect  sizes  reflect 
natural  variation  or  external  influences  over  time  (e.g., 
academic stress over the course of the term) rather than 
an  intervention  effect.  For  between-group  comparisons, 
effect sizes indicate the difference in change between the 
Experimental and Control groups, which reflects the rel-
ative impact of the intervention.

Bespoke survey analysis

For  the  data  collected  from  the  bespoke  surveys,  R 
Statistical  Software  was  used  to  calculate  response 
percentages.

FGD analysis

The  focus  group  discussion  (FGD)  was  conducted  over 
Zoom 10 days after the programme ended. It was facili-
tated by a member of the study team, and lasted approxi-
mately one hour. All MGW participants were invited, but 
the  session  was  voluntary  (with  $5  SGD  in  reimburse-
ment  for  their  time).  In  the  FGD,  the  participants  were 
asked  about  their  experience  and  thoughts  about  the 
programme’s  impact  on  their  mental  health,  social  con-
nection  and  creativity,  along  with  their  suggestions  for 

programme development. To ensure the privacy and con-
fidentiality  of  the  participants,  the  session  was  recorded 
and  subsequently  transcribed  in  a  de-identified  format. 
Following transcription, two members of the study team 
independently  engaged  in  a  detailed  review  of  the  data 
to  familiarize  themselves  with  the  content.  The  qualita-
tive  data  collected  from  the  FGD  were  analyzed  using  a 
thematic  analysis  approach  [39,  40].  Each  member  then 
independently  generated  initial  codes  from  the  data, 
which were iteratively refined and grouped into themes. 
Then,  the  two  members  held  one  session  for  discus-
sion  and  consensus  building  to  establish  the  final  set  of 
themes.  Regarding  the  quotes  presented  in  this  article, 
only  filler  words  (such  as  “um”,  “like”,  etc.)  and  repeated 
words were omitted for clarity and readability. Any words 
added, or redacted due to privacy, are indicated in square 
brackets.

Results
Baseline characteristics

The  flow  chart  below  (Figure  1)  illustrates  participants’ 
recruitment and retention throughout the study. All par-
ticipants  across  both  Experimental  and  Control  groups 
completed  the  baseline  quantitative  assessments  before 
the  intervention  began.  Throughout  the  study,  partici-
pant attrition occurred. The primary reasons for dropout 
were typically related to scheduling conflicts and the time 
commitment required for participation.

The  baseline  characteristics  of  participants  in  the 
MGW  programme  were  analyzed  to  ensure  compara-
bility  across  the  Experimental  and  Control  groups  (see 
Table 1). Fisher’s exact test was used for gender, Pearson’s 
Chi-squared  test  was  used  for  ethnicity  and  Wilcoxon 
rank sum tests were used for the remaining variables. The 
average  age  of  participants  in  the  Experimental  group 
3.1
was 22.3 years ( SD
years) in the Control group. There was no significant dif-
ference in age across groups ( U

compared  to  14%  males  and  86%  females  in  the  Experi-
mental  group  (Fisher’s  exact  test,  p

No  significant  differences  were  found  in  other  scales 
(see  Table  1)  at  baseline,  indicating  that  participants 
began  the  programme  with  similar  mental  health  and 
psychosocial states.

Experimental groups at Week 5 and Week 10 compared

period. In contrast, the Experimental group showed sig-
nificant improvements in physical and psychological well-
being  (as  indicated  from  the  Physical  and  Psychological 
domains  of  the  WHOQOL-BREF),  reductions  in  Stress 
(as indicated via DASS-21), and enhancements in creativ-

Takeaway messages from within‑group comparisons

Between‑group comparisons

Overall, the within-group analyses indicate that the Con-
trol  group  experienced  statistically  significant  declines 
in physical health  (as measured via the  Physical domain 
of the WHOQOL-BREF scale), and worse mental health 
(as  measured  via  DASS-21  Anxiety,  Depression,  and 
Stress  scores),  indicating  worsening  overall  well-being. 
This  is  likely  due  to  the  10-week  programme  coincid-
ing  with  the  term  period  (with  the  programme  running 
up until exam weeks), as there tend to be rising levels of

Takeaway messages from between‑group comparisons

Overall,  the  between-group  analyses  indicate  that,  over 
the 10 week intervention period, the Experimental group 
experienced  significantly  greater  improvements  in  psy-
chological  well-being,  creative  experiences,  and  reduc-
tions  in  depression  and  stress  levels  compared  to  the 
Control  group.  The  Experimental  group  also  showed 
greater improvements in specific aspects of music-based 
mood  regulation,  particularly  in  the  Strong  Sensation 
and  Diversion  subscales  of  the  B-MMR.  These  results 
indicate  that  participating  in  the  MGW  programme 
increased students’ use of music for eliciting strong emo-
tional  experiences,  and  for  distracting  themselves  from 
unwanted  thoughts  or  feelings.  Both  of  these  music  lis-
tening strategies have been shown to be positively associ-
ated with higher Quality of Life.

Subgroup comparisons

The  subgroup  analysis  indicates  that  there  were  no  sig-
nificant  differences  in  outcomes  between  Group  A 
and  Group  B  at  either  Week  5  ( p > 0.05
 )  or  Week  10 
( p > 0.05
 ). The results suggest that the order of interven-
tions (drumming first as in Group A, or dancing first as 
in Group B) did not have a significant impact, as both led 
to  similar  effects  on  the  participants’  mental  health  and 
creative experiences.

Bespoke survey results

The bespoke survey provides a more robust understand-
ing  of  the  impact  of  the  intervention  on  students.  The 
survey results offer insights into the impact of the MGW 
programme  on  students’  mental  health,  creative  expres-
sion, and social connection at Weeks 5 and Week 10. We 
summarize the main findings below; for the detailed list 
of  bespoke  survey  questions  and  participant  responses 
for each group at Week 5 and Week 10, please see Sup-
plementary Materials Tables 1–4.

Mental health

At Week 5, 100% of students in the drumming and 92% 
of  students  in  the  dancing  groups  reported  improve-
ments in their mood. In addition, 94% of students in the 
drumming  group  and  100%  of  students  in  the  dancing 
group indicated that the MGW sessions made them feel 
less stressed, tired, and/or sad. By Week 10, all students 
in  the  dancing  group  and  86%  of  students  in  the  drum-
ming  group  reported  that  the  sessions  improved  their 
mood.  Additionally,  71%  of  students  in  the  drumming 
group reported feeling more lively/energetic, and 66% felt 
less  stressed/worried.  In  the  dancing  group,  75%  of  stu-
dents reported feeling more lively/energetic and 67% less 
stressed/worried.

Creative expression

The  majority  of  students  in  both  groups  found  that  the 
programme  provided  them  with  new  techniques  and 
ideas  and  a  supportive  environment  for  creative  expres-
sion. At Week 5, 93% of students in the drumming group 
and  75%  of  students  in  the  dancing  group  said  that  the 
programme gave them the opportunity to express them-
selves  creatively.  By  Week  10,  79%  of  students  in  the 
drumming  group  and  83%  of  students  in  the  dancing 
group  agreed  that  the  sessions  gave  them  the  opportu-
nity  to  express  themselves  creatively.  Additionally,  92% 
of students in the dancing group and 79% of students in 
the drumming group agreed (at Week 10) that they had 
a  better  understanding  of  how  creative  activities  can  be 
used to express feelings.

Social connection

More  than  half  of  the  students  in  both  groups  reported 
that  the  programme  stimulated  new  friendships.  At 
Week  5,  57%  of  students  in  the  drumming  group  and 
67% of students in the dancing group indicated that they 
made  new  friends  through  the  sessions.  By  Week  10, 
85% of students in the drumming group and 75% of stu-
dents  in  the  dancing  group  agreed  that  they  made  new 
friends  through  the  sessions.  Therefore,  about  4  out  of 
every 5 students in the programme made new friends by 
participating  in  MGW.  In  addition,  100%  of  students  in 
the dancing group and 71% of students in the drumming 
group reported (at Week 10) that the sessions made them 
feel “more positive attitudes and feelings” towards those 
around them.

Affordances and impacts of drumming and dancing activities

For  both  the  drumming  and  dancing  portions  of  the 
MGW  intervention,  we  combined  the  results  across 
Group  A  and  Group  B  to  examine  differences  in  out-
come  measures  across  the  two  intervention  activi-
ties  (i.e.,  responses  relating  to  the  drumming  portion 

 Agres and Chen  BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1628 

Page 12 of 18

alone were combined across Groups A and B, in order 
to examine the impact of drumming on mental health, 
social connection, and creativity).

Both  drumming  and  dancing  groups  demonstrated 
mood  improvement,  with  93.33%  of  the  drumming 
group  and  96.0%  of  the  dancing  group  reporting  posi-
tive  mood  changes.  The  dancing  group  exhibited 
slightly  higher  rates  of  positive  emotions,  with  76.0% 
feeling  more  happy  and  lively,  compared  to  53.33% 
of  the  drumming  group.  Additionally,  66.67%  of  the 
drumming group felt more energetic after five weeks of 
group  drumming.  In  terms  of  reducing  negative  emo-
tions,  60.0%  of  the  dancing  group  and  56.67%  of  the 
drumming  group  felt  less  stressed,  while  reductions  in 
sadness  were  reported  by  40.0%  of  the  dancing  group 
and 33.33% of the drumming group.

Social  connectivity  was  notably  higher  in  the  danc-
ing group, with 72.0% feeling more socially connected, 
compared  to  46.67%  of  the  drumming  group.  In  terms 
of creativity, creative expression was slightly higher for 
the drumming group, where 86.67% felt the programme 
allowed  them  to  express  themselves  creatively,  com-
pared to 76.0% in the dancing group.

The findings above suggest that drumming and danc-
ing may have different affordances for supporting men-
tal  health,  social  connection,  and  creativity.  While 
improvements were similar in most areas, higher rates 
of  positive  emotions  and  social  connections  were  seen 
in  the  dancing  group,  and  higher  rates  of  creativity 
were reported by the drumming group.

Bespoke survey results across all participants at Week 10

In  the  subsections  above,  we  focus  on  results  from 
Group A and Group B (sections 3.5.1, 3.5.2., and 3.5.3), 
as well as the impact of drumming versus dancing activ-
ities (section 3.5.4). Here, we examine results across all 
students who participated in the MGW programme. At 
Week 10, all students in the MGW programme (across 
Groups A and B) were asked to reflect on their overall 
experience of the MGW programme, reflecting on their 
mood and emotional states, plans to participate in fur-
ther  creative  arts  programmes  as  a  function  of  having 
participated  in  MGW,  and  desire  to  connect  with  oth-
ers  through  creative  arts  in  the  future.  Figure  2  below 
shows the results of participants’ attitudes towards the 
overall programme.

Several  takeaway  messages  may  be  distilled  from  the 

bespoke survey results presented here and above:

•  Mood  improvements  were  reported  by  96%  of  stu-
dents  by  Week  10,  with  the  dancing  group  showing 
slightly higher rates of improvement.

•  High  levels  of  positive  emotions  (61%  or  greater) 
across  students,  with  the  dancing  group  reporting 
slightly higher feelings of happiness and liveliness.
•  Effective  reduction  of  negative  emotions  such  as 
stress  and  sadness  in  both  the  dancing  and  drum-
ming groups.

•  Enhanced social connectivity, with the dancing group 
feeling more socially connected with people around.
•  Strong support for creative expression, particularly in 

the drumming group.

•  Positive  impact  on  future  participation  in  creative 

arts activities more frequently.

These  findings  indicate  that  both  drumming  and  danc-
ing sessions effectively enhanced mood, fostered positive 
feelings, reduced negative emotions, and promoted social 
and creative engagement, with the dancing group show-
ing a slight edge in emotional and social connectivity and 
the drumming group excelling in creative expression.

Focus group results

The Focus Group Discussion (FGD) highlighted the pro-
gramme’s  impact  on  mental  health,  social  connection, 
and  creativity.  Four  students  participated  (male  =  1, 
female  =  3)  in  the  FGD  discussion,  as  the  FGD  session 
was voluntary and occurred during the busy end of term. 
Below we present the key themes that emerged from our 
thematic analysis of the FGD data.

Impact on mental health

Participants  reported  that  the  programme  improved 
their mental health by boosting their mood and facilitat-
ing  social  connections  through  what  they  saw  as  engag-
ing  and  well-facilitated  activities.  According  to  one 
participant,

P2:  “In  the  dancing  session,  it  is  easier  to  interact 
with  others,  because  sometimes  [the  dance  facilita-
tor] will assign us as a group, like two or three peo-
ple.  So  you  have  to  interact  or  communicate  with 
your partner. Maybe during this, a lot of interaction, 
then  I  became  friends  with  some  of  them  and  that 
made me feel better. I think [I] get more energy and 
spiritual support from the session”.

Sessions were reported to provide a much-needed break 
from  academic  stress,  offering  a  temporary  escape  that 
participants  looked  forward  to  each  week.  Engagement 
in music and dance was regarded as a stress management 
tool  and  a  coping  mechanism,  although  one  participant 
noted  that  the  sessions  did  not  completely  eliminate 
stress. As one participant remarked,

P1: “I guess music like kind of gave me a solution to 

Agres and Chen  BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1628

cope with it [stress] in the moment or something. But 
I wouldn’t say like overall like there was no anxious-
ness and no problem, like I think I still felt very like 
all the stresses that I usually feel”.

others and share personal aspects of their lives in the ses-
sions  through  structured  group  activities.  This  particu-
larly  benefited  those  who  were  naturally  shy.  According 
to one participant,

Participants  also  felt  inspired  to  integrate  more  move-
ment  and  music  into  their  daily  routines,  which  they 
believe enhanced their mental health, physical health and 
overall well-being. One participant stated,

P3: “And in fact, it [the MGW programme] did help 
me  to  relax  myself,  because,  for  example,  in  the 
dancing  group  through  the  movement,  it  help[ed] 
me in physical health. And at the same time,...I feel 
more relaxed about myself ”.

Impact on social connection

Participants  agreed  that  the  programme  created  a  safe 
and  supportive  community  atmosphere  which  fostered 
social  connections.  Participants  were  able  to  bond  with 

P1: “It’s also the fact that we all make mistakes and 
do silly things and it’s kinda like we show each other 
embarrassing  sides,  but  also  very  personal  sides 
because we express days and stuff. And that’s some-
thing you don’t do outside. You don’t suddenly move 
and show how your day was. It’s awkward, and it is 
something kind of embarrassing to do. But by doing 
it, it creates a safe space because everyone is kind of 
confidently doing it. It creates a safe space where you 
bond  with  people  more  because  they  created  that 
safe  space  and  also  this  very  open  space  with  each 
other”.

Over  time,  the  social  connection  led  to  the  formation 
of  meaningful  friendships.  This  enhanced  participants’ 

 Agres and Chen  BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1628 

Page 14 of 18

sense  of  social  connectedness  and  understanding  of 
different  perspectives  and  at  times  brought  students 
together from different faculties who would not normally 
interact in classroom settings. One participant remarked 
that,

P2:  “I  think  I  made  a  very  good  friend  there.  We 
share a lot about the cultural differences because we 
are from different countries. The cultural differences, 
and  also  what  we’ve  learned.  I’m  from  business 
school  and  she’s  form  engineering.  And  [we]  share 
our opinions on different subjects”.

Impact on creativity

Participants  said  the  programme  provided  them  with 
new  opportunities  for  personal  exploration  through 
creative  expression.  These  were  said  to  contribute  posi-
tively  to  their  quality  of  life  and  mental  health.  Accord-
ing to one participant (P1), “creatively expressing myself 
through music really makes me feel better and improves 
my mental well-being”.

The  participant  further  commented  that  the  sessions 
not only improved their mental health, but also encour-
aged  participants  to  use  the  arts  to  facilitate  expression 
outside of the sessions,

P1:  “I  started  listening  to  music  way  more.  Now 
when  I’m  sad,  I  think  I  definitely  listen  to  music.  I 
actually started playing piano as well because I just 
thought  creating  art  by  myself  is  a  very  like  thera-
peutic and everything”.

These  reflections  highlight  how  creative  expression 
through the arts is connected to mental health, and how 
participating in the MGW programme has led to behav-
ioral change in some participants.

Participants  stated  that  the  programme  helped  with 
removing their perceived barrier of entry to the arts, and 
encouraged  them  to  engage  freely  in  music  and  dance 
without focusing on the quality of their output. One par-
ticipant (P4) remarked that the dance facilitator encour-
aged  them,  regardless  of  their  perceptions  of  their  own 
dancing abilities, to “just move your body to express your 
feelings”.  The  participant  (P4)  further  commented  that 
regardless of body shape or dancing ability, “You can just 
move... You can just do whatever you like”.

Although technical skills were not seen as being neces-
sary for creative expression, the acquisition of technique 
was valued highly, with participants appreciating acquir-
ing a broader skill set that allowed them to express them-
selves more freely and creatively. As one participant (P1) 
noted, “I think technique is actually so important and it 
helps us express ourselves better...That’s what allows us to 
become creative with those kind[s] of techniques”.

Programme development: strengths and limitations

When reflecting on strengths of the programme, partici-
pants  valued  the  opportunity  to  enjoy  the  arts  and  have 
fun with fellow participants. They reported that the var-
ied activities provided different levels of comfort for self-
expression,  with  dancing  offering  a  less  direct  focus  on 
individuals  (as  everyone  was  moving  around  the  room). 
This helped ease self-consciousness.

Despite  some  initial  shyness,  the  programme’s  ele-
ments  and  its  supportive  atmosphere  enabled  partici-
pants  to  overcome  their  initial  reservations  and  engage 
more fully as the sessions progressed. However, the start 
of  the  programme  was  sometimes  marked  by  awkward-
ness  and  discomfort  as  participants  met  new  people, 
which was seen as the least favorite aspect of the experi-
ence by some participants. It took a couple of sessions for 
students to form a rapport with one another.

When  asked  whether  they  believe  the  programme 
should  be  offered  to  more  students  around  campus, 
participants  recognized  the  value  of  the  programme  for 
other  students.  One  participant  also  suggested  that,  like 
the current version of the programme, it may be a good 
idea to not specifically recruit friends (groups of students 
who  already  know  each  other),  as  participating  with 
friends may hinder the openness and effectiveness of self-
expression. In addition to feeling the space and freedom 
to  express  without  judgement,  joining  as  an  individual 
also helps facilitate new social connections.

Considering the suggestions above, the programme can 
be  further  refined  to  enhance  participant  comfort  and 
engagement. For example, future versions of MGW may 
aim  to  create  a  more  welcoming  and  inclusive  environ-
ment from the start by including more ice-breaker activi-
ties and small group interactions.

Discussion
Our  findings  indicate  that  the  MGW  programme  sig-
nificantly  improves  university  students’  mental  health, 
creative  expression,  and  social  connections  among  par-
ticipants.  In  our  RCT  study,  the  Experimental  group 
exhibited significantly lower levels of depression at Week 
5 compared to the Control group, as well as a significant 
reduction  in  stress  at  Week  10  (according  to  DASS-21 
scores). In addition, unlike the Control group, the Experi-
mental  group  did  not  demonstrate  worse  depression, 
anxiety,  and  stress  scores  at  Week  5  compared  to  base-
line. These  findings  indicate  that  the  MGW  programme 
helped  students  maintain  better  mental  health  over  the 
course  of  the  10-week  intervention.  Importantly,  these 
improvements in mental health were not only statistically 
significant,  but  showed  moderate  to  large  effect  sizes, 
which  further  support  the  programme’s  effectiveness 

Agres and Chen  BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1628 

Page 15 of 18

in  promoting  participants’  mental  health.  MGW  par-
ticipants  also  demonstrated  improvements  in  the  Physi-
cal  and  Psychological  domains  of  the  WHOQOL-BREF 
scale,  reflecting  enhanced  physical  health  and  mental 
well-being.  The  programme  also  significantly  boosted 
creative expression, as evidenced by higher scores on the 
Experience of Creation scale and positive feedback from 
the  bespoke  survey  and  FGD.  The  observed  increase  in 
creative engagement was particularly strong as evidenced 
by  the  large  effect  sizes.  Finally,  the  programme  effec-
tively  fostered  social  connections,  with  MGW  partici-
pants reporting new friendships and a stronger sense of 
community.

The positive effects of the Movin’ & Groovin’ for Well-
ness (MGW) programme on mental health can be attrib-
uted  to  several  interconnected  mechanisms.  Firstly,  the 
music  and  dance  activities  themselves  played  a  signifi-
cant role in reducing depression and stress. Engaging in 
rhythmic  drumming  and  dance  can  lead  to  physiologi-
cal changes, such as lowering cortisol levels and increas-
ing the release of endorphins [15, 41], which are known 
to  enhance  mood  and  reduce  stress. The  physical  act  of 
moving to music and participating in coordinated group 
activities  provides  an  immediate  and  enjoyable  way  to 
alleviate  the  symptoms  of  anxiety/stress  and  depression 
[42, 43].

Secondly,  the  programme’s  emphasis  on  creative 
expression  through  improvisation  likely  played  a  crucial 
role  in  fostering  emotional  release  and  reducing  stress. 
Improvisation has been associated with improvements in 
mental  health  conditions,  reductions  in  stress  and  anxi-
ety,  and  improved  communication  [23].  When  embed-
ded  within  music  and  dance  activities,  improvisation 
allows  participants  to  explore  and  process  their  feelings 
in  a  supportive  and  non-judgmental  environment  [23, 
25]. This form of creative expression can act as a power-
ful outlet for suppressed emotions, and help participants 
gain  insights  into  their  emotional  states.  Further,  the 
structured  yet  flexible  nature  of  improvisation  encour-
ages  spontaneity  and  self-discovery,  which  can  be  par-
ticularly  therapeutic  for  individuals  dealing  with  mental 
health challenges [23, 25].

We also found that the group-based nature of the ses-
sions  facilitated  social  interactions  and  bonding,  which 
are critical for reducing feelings of loneliness and enhanc-
ing a sense of community. The social connections formed 
through  the  programme  not  only  provided  emotional 
support but also helped students build a network of peers 
who  share  similar  experiences.  This  sense  of  belonging, 
contribution, and community is vital for improving men-
tal  health  and  well-being,  as  it  counteracts  the  isolation 
and  loneliness  that  many  students  face  [44].  The  focus 
group  discussions  revealed  that  participants  valued  the 

opportunity  to  interact  with  others,  make  new  friends, 
and engage in shared activities, all of which contributed 
to their well-being and an overall positive experience.

Importantly,  creative  expression  and  social  connec-
tion themselves may act as mediating factors for mental 
health  improvement.  In  this  way,  the  three  aims  of  the 
MGW  programme-mental  health  support,  social  con-
nection,  and  creative  expression-are  deeply  intertwined. 
Participating  in  creative  activities  in  a  group  setting  not 
only provides the opportunity and space for self-expres-
sion but also fosters shared experience and social bonds, 
which,  in  turn,  can  positively  impact  mental  health  and 
well-being.

Additionally,  the  skills  learned  during  the  MGW  pro-
gramme  had  a  positive  impact  on  participants’  mental 
health outside of the sessions. The significant increase for 
the Experimental group in two B-MMR subscale scores, 
including the “Strong Sensation” and “Diversion” catego-
ries,  illustrates  the  programme’s  efficacy  in  empowering 
students to use music as a tool for mood regulation. Par-
ticipants  reported  in  the  FGD  that  the  techniques  and 
practices they learned during the sessions improved their 
mood and helped them manage their stress even outside 
the programme. The lived experiences collected from the 
FGD  highlighted  how  students  continued  to  use  music 
and  dance  to  find  emotional  relief  and  joy,  demonstrat-
ing the enduring benefits of the skills acquired during the 
programme.

Finally, although the MGW programme always involves 
both drumming and dancing activities, we recognize that 
these activities have different affordances for participants. 
The  results  (especially  of  the  bespoke  survey)  revealed 
the  benefits  associated  with  each  activity.  Between  the 
two  activities,  drumming  was  more  strongly  associated 
creative  expression,  while  dancing  was  reported  as  par-
ticularly effective for facilitating social connection among 
the  participants.  These  findings  highlight  the  different 
affordances of drumming and dancing within MGW pro-
gramme. Incorporating both activities in the programme, 
addresses both the needs and preferences of participants, 
and allows for different aspects of health and wellness to 
be supported.

Novelty of the programme

This  programme  was  innovative  in  several  ways.  First, 
bespoke music and dance protocols were developed for 
the  10-week  programme  in  an  interdisciplinary/artis-
tic  collaboration  between  the  team  members  (span-
ning backgrounds in cognitive science and psychology, 
music  performance,  and  dance).  These  protocols 
offered a new way to engage students through perform-

no  similar  programme  (integrating  drumming,  danc-
ing, and improvisation to live music) currently exists in 
Singapore.

Second,  it  is  unique  to  combine  rhythmic  drumming 
with  tonal  improvisation  (provided  by  the  musicians 
playing live), let alone to add a dance component - most 
programmes  focus  on  a  single  modality,  or  for  example 
dancing  to  music.  Here  we  included  improvisation  “jsm 
sessions”  that  involved  students  drumming  and  dancing 
along  with  live  improvised  music.  We  know  that  both 
music-  and  movement-based  activities  are  empowering 
for emotional expression, and the literature confirms that 
both  of  these  activities  are  powerful  means  of  support-
ing mental health. The addition of improvisation was the 
proverbial icing on the cake – it allowed students to lev-
erage  the  drumming  and  dancing  skills  they  developed 
for creative expression with their peers, and provided the 
joy of engaging with live music.

Providing accessible, enjoyable, and culturally relevant 
activities is essential for promoting young adults’ mental 
health,  especially  when  those  activities  are  stigma-free. 
Future  studies  can  explore  how  to  sustainably  integrate 
and sustain arts-based strategies into universities’ health 
and wellness services.

Limitations

We  are  mindful  that  like  any  programme  or  research 
study,  we  encountered  certain  limitations.  Firstly,  the 
dropout rate during the 10-week programme was a con-
cern.  The  length  of  the  intervention  may  have  been  too 
long for some participants (with the final session held the 
week before finals), leading to the relatively small sample 
size  by  the  end  of  the  intervention.  Future  programmes 
might benefit from a shorter duration (e.g., 6 or 8 weeks), 
ending more in advance of the final exam period, or inte-
grating additional strategies (such as increasing the reim-
bursement) to maintain participant retention throughout 
the  intervention  period.  Increasing  the  sample  size  in 
subsequent  research  studies  would  provide  more  robust 
evidence.

Additionally, our sample included more female partici-
pants than males, and this gender imbalance could affect 
the generalizability of our results, as the experiences and 
outcomes  might  differ  by  gender.  Future  studies  would 
benefit  from  specifically  targeting  a  more  balanced  gen-
der distribution.

Finally,  we  recognize  that  the  study  was  conducted 
within a specific sociocultural context in Singapore (e.g., 
a  university  setting  in  SE  Asia).  Cultural  factors,  such 
as  local  attitudes  towards  mental  health  and  the  arts, 
can  always  potentially  influence  the  outcomes  of  such 
interventions.

Implications for policy

The  MGW  programme  seeks  to  promote  mental  and 
social  well-being  through  the  translation  of  research 
findings into a scalable initiative that positively supports 
university  students.  The  findings  from  this  study  have 
practical implications for mental health programmes and 
public  health  policy  around  campus  and  beyond.  Arts-
based  initiatives  like  MGW  demonstrate  the  potential 
to  promote  mental  health,  creativity,  and  social  connec-
tion  in  university  students  in  a  culturally  appropriate 
way  with  no  stigma  attached.  Furthermore,  arts-based 
programmes can attract participation by framing mental 
health  support  as  an  enjoyable  and  culturally  enriching 
activity, which can be particularly effective in encourag-
ing students who might otherwise not to seek help.
