Abstract. Zinc (Zn) may be associated with schizophrenia 
(SCH), since its altered homeostasis can contribute to abnormal 
glutamatergic neurotransmission, inflammation, neurodegen‑
eration and autoimmune abnormalities. It has been proposed 
that a number of patients with SCH could benefit from the 
use of Zn, either on its own or along with vitamins C, E and 
B6, and prenatal supplementation of Zn during the gestation 
period can mitigate the lipopolysaccharide‑induced rat model 
of maternal immune activation. The aim of the present review 
was to summarize the various effects of Zn dyshomeostasis on 
patients with psychosis and to clarify in what ways they could 
benefit from Zn supplementation.

1. Introduction

Zinc  (Zn)  is  an  essential  trace  element  that  has  a  role  in 
prenatal and postnatal growth and development; notably, it 
is involved in gene expression, DNA and RNA stabilization, 
neurotransmission and apoptosis (1‑3). Zn serves an important 
role in the activity of several enzymes, including dopamine 
β‑hydroxylase,  superoxide  dismutase  (SOD),  thymidylate 
synthase, DNA and RNA polymerases, matrix metalloprotein‑
ases and N‑acyl‑D‑aspartate deacylase (4,5). In addition, Zn 
is an inhibitor of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity, and it 
interacts with GABA and serotonin receptors (6,7); it is found 
in high quantities in the hippocampus and limbic system in 
glutamatergic neurons, and it can cause cognitive and memory 
impairment (8,9). Sources of Zn include red meat, oysters, 
crabs,  nuts,  beans  and  whole  grains (7).  Notably,  Zn  defi‑
ciency can result in symptoms of depression, anxiety, growth 
restriction, loss of appetite, impaired immune function, loss 
of smell, diarrhea and hair loss as well as in acrodermatitis 
enteropathica  specifically  in  children  (7,10‑13).  However, 
increased concentrations of Zn can have a toxic outcome; it 
has been reported that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
exhibit increased Zn concentrations in the substantia nigra, 
and after continuous Zn administration for 12 weeks, rats have 
demonstrated upregulation of COX‑2 mRNA in the substantia 
nigra (14).  The  important  role  of  Zn  in  neurodegenerative 
disorders,  schizophrenia  (SCH)  and  depression  has  been 
established in several research studies (8,15‑17).

2. Relationship of Zn with psychosis

Researchers  have  proposed  that  SCH  is  a  neurodevelop‑
mental disorder (18,19). Notably, Zn is considered a possible 
diagnostic biomarker associated with SCH, since its altered 
homeostasis  may  contribute  to  irregular  glutamatergic 
neurotransmission,  inflammation,  neurodegeneration  and 
autoimmune defects (3,5).

THELERITIS et al:  ZINC IN PSYCHOSIS

It has been suggested that prenatal Zn deficiency, as a result 
of maternal Zn insufficiency or fetal gene variants, results in 
decreased brain volume in rodent models (20,21) and increases 
the  incidence  of  SCH.  Other  SCH  risk  genes  (including 
CACNA1G,  SOBP,  GRIA3,  SRRM2,  NR3C2,  TRIO  and 
RYR2) (22) and Zn deficiency after birth may contribute to 
the occurrence of SCH. Within this context, a decrease in 
brain Zn content has been reported in postmortem samples 
from patients with early onset psychosis compared with that in 
control samples (15,23). Furthermore, in a post‑mortem study 
of the brains of patients with SCH, ionic Zn staining within the 
hippocampus was observed; Zn staining in the dentate gyrus 
was shown to be more intense in female and older donors (24). 
In another post‑mortem study, Zn levels were revealed to be 
elevated in the hippocampus, and reduced within the amyg‑
dala and caudate nucleus; notably, no significant differences 
were reported in Zn levels between patients with SCH and 
controls (25).

Dysfunction  of  Zn  transferring  molecules,  particularly 
of the SLC39 family responsible for transporting zinc into 
the cytoplasm, may lead to irregular Zn concentrations and 
have been implicated in SCH (17). Genome‑wide association 
studies  have  demonstrated  common  genetic  influences  of 
the  SLC39A8  gene  for  SCH  and  inflammatory  bowel 
disease (26,27). Variants of this gene have been reported to 
be associated with metabolic abnormalities (lipid levels, blood 
pressure  and  obesity)  and  SCH‑associated  inflammatory 
indicators (a shift in gut microbiome composition and T‑cell 
immunity) (26,28‑30).

One  missense  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  of  the 
SLC39A8 gene, which encodes ZIP8, rs13107325, has been 
found to be related to brain Zn homeostasis in psychosis (31). 
Li  et  al   (32)  demonstrated  that  cortical  dendritic  spine 
density in SLC39A8‑p.393T knock‑in mice was significantly 
diminished,  and  it  has  been  proposed  that  abnormalities 
in  dendritic  spines  are  associated  with  the  development 
of  SCH.  Furthermore,  Tseng et al  (33)  reported  that  the 
missense variant rs13107325 of gene SLC39A8 resulted in 
an elevated innate immune response and glutamate receptor 
hypofunction.  Moreover,  mRNA  expression  levels  of  the 
SLC39A12 gene, which encodes ZIP12, have been reported 
to be increased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 
patients with SCH (34). Perez‑Becerril et al (35) reported that 
allelic variants in SLC30A3 were also associated with SCH 
in female participants. Regarding the ZNF family of genes, 
ZNF804A has also been demonstrated to be associated with 
SCH (36).

It has been reported that Zn serves an antioxidant protec‑
tive role in patients with diabetes and patients undergoing 
hemodialysis,  and  it  decreases  inflammation,  ameliorates 
mucociliary clearance, inhibits ventilator‑induced lung injury, 
and regulates antiviral and antibacterial immunity in patients 
with COVID‑19, respiratory syncytial virus, common cold and 
pneumonia (37‑40). Moreover, Zn seems to be implicated in 
chronic liver disease through Zn‑supported metalloproteinase 
enzymes (41). In addition, it has been reported that an anti‑aging 
telomerase‑activating nutraceutical preparation, containing 
vitamins  D3  and  C,  Centella asiatica  extract  and  Zn,  can 
exhibit anti‑aging properties on rat brains, by preserving or 
even enhancing telomere size and action (42,43).

Santa Cruz et al (44) suggested that low Zn concentrations 
may  indicate  that  patients  with  SCH  and  bipolar  disorder 
exhibit  enduring  oxidative  stress;  among  the  free  radicals 
produced  during  oxidative  stress,  reactive  oxygen  species 
and reactive nitrogen species have been associated with the 
occurrence of SCH and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, it has 
been suggested that decreased Zn within the hippocampus 
may  activate  the  hypothalamus‑pituitary‑adrenal  (HPA) 
axis (45), while at the same time quinolinic acid, an NMDAR 
agonist, is produced; consequently, there is an elevation in 
NMDAR activity that results in increased glutamate release 
and neurotoxicity. Decreased Zn levels in patients with SCH 
and bipolar disorder who exhibit enduring oxidative stress do 
not permit effective inhibition of the NMDAR (46). Reactive 
oxygen  species  and  reactive  nitrogen  species  are  the  free 
radicals that are the most associated with SCH and bipolar 
disorder (47,48). Guo et al (49) identified a positive correla‑
tion between SOD, which exerts antioxidant enzyme activity 
against reactive oxygen species, and the copper (Cu)/Zn ratio, 
and Kunz et al (50) detected elevated concentrations of SOD in 
patients with SCH treated with antipsychotics vs. the controls. 
Furthermore, Hendouei et al (51) observed increased SOD 
activity in patients treated with clozapine compared with other 
antipsychotics. Al‑Hakeim et al (52) reported that subjects with 
reduced levels of IL‑10, magnesium, calcium and Zn exhibited 
generalized  neurocognitive  deficits  within  the  context  of 
deficit SCH due to the pathogenic IL‑6/IL‑23/Th17‑axis. In 
another study by the same group (53), lower Zn levels, elevated 
lipid peroxidation and reduced antioxidant procedures were 
reported to predicted methamphetamine‑induced psychosis.

3. Materials and methods

An  extensive  electronic  search  was  conducted  using  the 
databases  included  in  the  National  Library  of  Medicine 
(https://www.nlm.nih.gov/;  accessed  November  7,  2024), 
as  well  as  PsycInfo  (https://www.apa.org/pubs/data‑
bases/psycinfo;  accessed  November  7,  2024)  and  Google 
Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/; accessed November 7, 
2024), for studies that have investigated Zn levels (including 
in serum and scalp hair) in patients with psychosis (such as 
SCH and bipolar disorder). In addition, studies in which the 
therapeutic effects of Zn in psychosis were demonstrated were 
searched for. In addition, the Cochrane Library (https://www.
cochranelibrary.com/;  accessed  November  7,  2024)  was 
searched for the references of retrieved articles. The exclu‑
sion criteria included studies on other psychiatric conditions, 
depression, anxiety disorders, other neurological conditions, 
drug abuse, and severe systematic or malignant conditions. 
Two authors read the abstracts, and when agreement could 
not be reached between the two, the senior author resolved the 
matter. There were no limitations regarding study design, the 
present narrative review includes meta‑analyses, systematic 
reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and open‑label 
studies; unpublished studies were not searched for.

4. Trials assessing Zn levels in psychosis

A number of studies have estimated Zn levels in patients with 
psychosis compared with in controls (Table I). Pfeiffer et al was

the first to report on reduced Zn serum level in patients with 
SCH (4,54). Subsequently, Srinivasan et al (55) reported that 
mean serum Zn levels in patients with SCH were lower than 
those in the control group, as assessed by atomic absorption 
spectrometry. However, Gillin et al (56) reported that patients 
with acute and chronic SCH, on or off treatment with various 
major tranquillizers, did not exhibit significant deviation from 
normal regarding concentrations of Zn in serum, urine, gastric 
fluid or hair. Potkin et al (57) observed that cerebrospinal 
fluid Zn concentrations did not differ significantly between 
drug‑free patients with SCH, patients with SCH on antipsy‑

done there was an increase in Zn plasma levels as assessed 

by  spectrophotometry.  Notably,  Yanik  et  al (64)  reported 
that Zn plasma levels did not differ between Turkish patients 
with  SCH  and  controls,  as  assessed  by  atomic  absorption 
spectrometry. However, Farzin et al (65) revealed that mean 
Zn plasma levels were significantly lower in Iranian patients 
with SCH vs. controls, as assessed using an atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer; furthermore, the Cu/Zn ratio was elevated 
in the patients with SCH. Devi et al (66) demonstrated that 
the mean Zn plasma levels were significantly lower in Indian 
patients with SCH compared with in the controls, as assessed 
by flame atomic absorption spectrometry; furthermore, there 
was no significant difference among patients with SCH and 
with various symptomatology. In addition, Rahman et al (67) 
detected a significant decrease in Zn hair concentration in 
Bangladeshi patients with SCH vs. controls, as assessed by 
flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ghanem et al (68) also 
observed that the mean hair Zn level was significantly lower in 
participants with SCH vs. controls.

Arinola  et  al  (69)  reported  that  patients  with  SCH  on 
antipsychotic medication exhibited elevated Zn serum levels 
compared with those in newly diagnosed drug‑free patients 
with SCH and controls, as assessed with an atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer. Kaya et al (70) observed reduced serum 
Zn levels in patients with SCH compared with in controls, 
as assessed with an atomic spectrophotometer. Cai et al (71) 
assessed serum Zn levels with coupled plasma‑mass spectrom‑
etry and revealed that they were reduced in Chinese patients with 
SCH vs. controls. By contrast, Olabanji et al (72) investigated 
patients with psychosis (most of them with SCH), and reported 
that Zn concentration in the hair of patients did not differ from 
that in controls. Vidović et al (73) also demonstrated that Zn 
plasma levels were not significantly higher in Serbian patients 
with SCH vs. controls, as assessed by coupled plasma‑mass

spectrometry. However, Sharma et al (74) observed that serum 
Zn levels in patients with SCH were significantly higher than 
those in controls, as assessed using an atomic absorption spec‑
trophotometer. Asare et al (75) found that serum Zn levels were 
lower in patients with SCH than in controls, as assessed with 
flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Nawaz et al (76) did 
not identify a statistical difference in serum Zn levels between 
newly diagnosed Pakistani patients with SCH compared with 
in  controls  and  chronic  patients  with  SCH.  Liu  et  al  (77) 
also  did  not  identify  significant  differences  serum  in  Zn 
levels between Chinese patients with SCH and controls, as 
assessed by coupled plasma‑mass spectrometry. In a study 
by Lin et al (78), serum Zn levels between Chinese patients 
with SCH and controls were not significantly different, as 
assessed by coupled plasma‑mass spectrometry. Furthermore, 
Velthorst et al (79) reported that Zn concentrations in teeth 
were reduced, but not significantly, during the perinatal period 
of subjects who later developed SCH vs. controls; however, 
in  a  previous  study,  Zn  concentrations  in  teeth  during  the 
perinatal period did not differ between controls and subjects 
who later developed SCH (80). Chen et al (81) detected lower 
serum Zn levels in patients with SCH compared with those 
in the control group, as assessed u the colorimetric method. 
Zn has been shown to be significantly decreased, particularly 
in mixed type SCH, acute SCH and SCH with schizotypal 
characteristics, following antipsychotic treatment.

Li  et  al  (82)  revealed  no  difference  in  serum  Zn  levels 
between Chinese patients with SCH and controls, as assessed by 
coupled plasma‑mass spectrometry. In addition, Cao et al (83) 
revealed no statistical difference in serum Zn levels between 
Chinese  patients  and  controls,  as  assessed  with  coupled 
plasma‑mass spectrometry. By contrast, Ma et al (84) reported 
that there were reduced serum Zn levels in Chinese patients 
with SCH vs. controls, as assessed by coupled plasma‑mass 
spectrometry. de Souza Pessôa et al (85) demonstrated that there 
was no statistical difference in serum Zn levels between patients 
with SCH and controls, whereas serum Zn levels were reduced 
in patients with bipolar disorder vs. controls, as assessed with a 
mass spectrometer. Santa Cruz et al (44) observed that serum 
Zn concentrations were significantly reduced in patients with 
SCH and bipolar disorder vs. controls, as assessed by coupled 
plasma‑mass spectrometry; furthermore, a significantly higher 
Cu/Zn ratio was observed in patients with SCH than in the 
control  group.  In  a  study  by  Uddin et al (86),  Bangladeshi 
patients  with  SCH  exhibited  lower  serum  Zn  levels  than 
controls, as assessed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. 
In addition, Awais et al (87) observed reduced serum Zn levels 
in Pakistani patients with SCH than in controls. By contrast, 
Lotan et al (88) found no differences in Zn distribution between 
patients with SCH and controls in post‑mortem PFC specimens. 
Dos Santos et al (89) reported that significantly higher levels 
of Zn in hair samples were associated with the presence of 
hallucinations, illusions and paranoid ideation in patients with 
PD vs. controls and in patients with PD who did not present 
these  symptoms,  as  assessed  with  flame  atomic  absorption 
spectrometry. Furthermore, Tabata et al (90) reported that hair 
Zn levels (measured with coupled plasma‑mass spectrometry) 
of  drug‑naïve  adolescents  were  negatively  associated  with 
psychosis risk, as assessed by the Thought Problems Scale from 
the Child Behavior Checklist.

Two  reviews  have  found  similar  results  to  the  present 
review (91,92). Most of the studies assessed reported reduced 
Zn concentrations in patients with psychosis (such as SCH 
and  bipolar  disorder)  vs.  controls  (4,44,54,55,59,61,63, 
65‑68,70,71,75,81,84,86,87). Notably, in three studies reduced 
Zn levels were found to be associated with increased Positive 
and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores (68,79,84). In a 
number of studies there was no difference observed in serum, 
whole blood and plasma levels between patients with psychosis 
and controls (56,57,60,64,72,73,76‑78,82,83,85,88). Just a few 
studies detected elevated Zn levels in patients with psychosis 
vs. controls (69,74,89); one of which found elevated levels in 
medicated patients, but not in newly diagnosed, non‑medicated 
patients (69). Regarding treatment, serum Zn levels in patients 
with SCH under treatment with depot neuroleptics were found 
to be reduced vs. controls in one study (58), whereas there was 
no difference found in another study (60). Nechifor et al (63) 
observed that patients with paranoid SCH after treatment with 
haloperidol or risperidone exhibited an increase in plasma Zn 
levels; however, Chen et al (81) revealed that risperidone treat‑
ment reduced Zn concentrations, with the effect being stronger 
in female participants, whereas no association was observed 
when olanzapine treatment was administered. Finally, it is 
worth  noting  that  valproate  has  been  reported  to  stabilize 
decreased Zn and potassium concentrations when synchrotron 
radiation X‑ray microfluorescence spectroscopy was used to 
compare trace element levels in neural progenitor cells derived 
from two clones of induced pluripotent stem cell lines from 
a patient with clozapine‑resistant SCH and two controls (93).

5. Treatment of psychosis with Zn

Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of 
Zn on psychosis. In a 6‑week double blind placebo‑controlled 
study, Mortazavi et al (94) reported that patients with SCH 
exhibited marked reductions in the PANSS subscale scores, 
aggression risk subscale and PANSS total score when they 
received  risperidone  treatment  combined  with  Zn  sulfate 
compared with those receiving risperidone treatment plus a 
placebo.

Pfeiffer and Sohler (95) proposed that adequate doses of 
B6 (up to 3.0 g/day) and Zn relieved the psychotic symptoms 
in patients who excreted kryptopyrrole; however, discontinu‑
ation of B6‑Zn resulted in a rapid return of serious psychotic 
symptoms within 48 h. Notably, it has been observed that the 
rate of intestinal Zn absorption is augmented when B6 and Zn 
are supplied simultaneously (96). Rohde et al (97) described 
the case of a male patient with psychosis, Pica syndrome and 
hippocampal  sclerosis,  who  was  treated  successfully  after 
combined treatment with carbamazepine, clozapine, diazepam 
and Zn. In a study by Russo and de Vito (98), the use of Zn 
in combination with vitamins C, E and B6 in patients with 
SCH resulted in a reduction in anxiety, but not depression or 
overall psychopathology. In another study, Russo (99) reported 
an improvement in overall bipolar symptomatology following 
Zn and antioxidant therapy.

Czerniak  and  Haim  (100)  reported  that  three  pheno‑
thiazine  compounds  (chlorpromazine,  thioridazine  and 
perphenazine)  increased  the  total  brain  Zn  uptake  in  rats 
and  mice  (more  so  in  rats)  that  were  injected  with  Zn

chloride Zn 65. Alizadeh et al (101) demonstrated that Zn 
supplementation  during  pregnancy  mitigated  lipopolysac‑
charide  (LPS)‑induced  abnormalities  in  working  memory, 
as well as GAD67 mRNA levels, in male rats. Furthermore, 
Mousaviyan et al (102) revealed that prenatal supplementa‑
tion of Zn alleviated the LPS‑induced rat model of maternal 
immune  activation;  consequently,  prenatal  LPS  exposure 
could be mitigated by Zn supplementation during pregnancy. 
Moreover, Savareh et al (103) used an animal model of SCH 
and showed the beneficial effect of Zn supplementation during 
pregnancy to protect against LPS‑induced inflammation in 
the hippocampus of adult rats. Similarly, Coyle et al  (104) 
reported  that,  in  mice,  maternal  dietary  supplementation 
with  Zn  mitigated  LPS‑induced  abnormalities  in  object 
recognition.  Onaolapo et al (105)  observed  that  Zn,  being 
administered on its own or together with antipsychotics, was 
associated  with  reversal  of  ketamine  impact.  In  addition, 
Joshi et al (106) revealed that the administration of Zn in rats 
resulted in decreased stereotypic movements, mean velocity, 
distance travelled and increase in rest time in comparison with 
the control group. Moreover, Zn combined with amphetamine 
resulted in antipsychotic qualities (a reduction in locomotor 
activity and decreased stereotypic movements).

6.  Models  explaining  the 
homeostasis and psychosis

link  between  altered  Zn 

It  has  been  proposed  that  genetic  susceptibility  and 
prenatal/perinatal risk issues (viral infection, LPS‑induced 
inflammation, malnutrition, hypoxia and maternal stress) may 
result in the individual being more susceptible to environmental 
stressors (childhood trauma, migration, substance abuse and 
urbanicity) (107‑112). Therefore, following trauma (108,109), 
gene‑environment  interplay  (108)  and  epigenetic  mecha‑
nisms (110,111) may alter the expression of genes implicated in 
neurodevelopment, the stress reaction and synaptic transmis‑
sion, and could increase the incidence of psychosis through 
their influence on neurotransmitters, the immune response 
and subsequent oxidative stress (112). Within this context, 
elevated glucocorticoid signaling has been found to induce 
acceleration of DNA methylation age, leading to hippocampal 
atrophy (110). Both DNA hypermethylation and hypomethyl‑
ation, non‑coding of microRNAs and long‑chain non‑coding 
RNAs,  and  histone  modification  are  among  the  types  of 
epigenetic mechanisms that have been reported to be associ‑
ated with SCH (111). In addition, Zn deficiency may result in 
oxidative stress and abnormal immune response, which leads 
to cell apoptosis (113).

Notably, it has been indicated that early adversity may alter 
the HPA axis, leading to an abnormal stress reaction (114), 
and amplified sensitivity to potential stressors in adolescence 
and adulthood (115‑117), thus stimulating the incidence of 
SCH symptoms through dopaminergic hyperactivity (118). In 
addition, extended contact with stress and glucocorticoids may 
ensue a decrease in hippocampal volume (119) and decreased 
brain‑derived  neurotrophic  factor  levels,  as  detected  in 
SCH (120‑125).

Individuals who experience metal dysregulation during 
early  placental  nutrition  are  more  susceptible  to  memory 
disorders  and  psychotic  symptomatology  (79,80,126). 

Velthorst et al (79) reported that lower Zn levels (as assessed 
with tooth biomarkers) in the final prenatal weeks were associ‑
ated with significantly elevated positive and general PANSS 
scores. Notably, contact with inflammation throughout gesta‑
tion may have perpetuating behavioral and neuronal outcomes 
in children (127). Placental inflammation during fetal develop‑
ment has been suggested to account for nutritional disruption 
and metal dyshomeostasis of the fetus (128,129); in a previous 
study, fetal Zn deficiency has been reported to induce epigen‑
etic alterations in the gene coding for the metal transporter, 
metallothionein‑2, which also regulates other metals (130). In 
addition, Tellez‑Merlo et al (131) revealed that LPS‑treated 
rats developed behavioral abnormalities along with elevations 
in  Zn  and  nitric  oxide  brain  concentrations;  furthermore, 
post‑pubertal neuronal hypertrophy was detected in the PFC 
and basolateral amygdala, and decreased spine density in the 
nucleus accumbens. In a study by Camacho‑Abrego et al (132), 
an increase in nitric oxide, Zn and metallothionein levels was 
found in pre‑pubertal rats with neonatal ventral hippocampus 
lesions (an animal model of SCH), particularly in the lesion. 
Post puberty, the observed changes were considered to be the 
final result of the excitotoxic neonatal ventral hippocampus 
lesions,  resulting  in  lower  levels  of  the  neuroprotective 
molecule  metallothionein  in  the  PFC,  and  an  increase  in 
the levels of nitric oxide and Zn in the PFC, both of which 
have  an  excitotoxic  effect  at  high  levels.  In  another  study 
by Savareh et al (103), an animal model of SCH was used 
to demonstrate the beneficial effect of Zn supplementation 
during pregnancy to protect against LPS‑induced inflamma‑
tion in the hippocampus of adult rats. It has been proposed 
that decreased Zn levels within the hippocampus may result in 
the activation of the HPA axis (45), and the concurrent produc‑
tion of the NMDAR agonist quinolinic acid; consequently, 
there is an elevation in NMDAR activity, which results in 
increased glutamate release and neurotoxicity. Decreased Zn 
levels in patients with SCH and bipolar disorder who exhibit 
enduring oxidative stress do not permit effective inhibition 
of the NMDAR (46). There are two ways that the inhibitory 
effects of Zn on NMDARs unfold (Fig. 1). First, allosteric 
inhibition is caused by Zn binding to the GluN2A subunit of 
the NMDAR, which diminishes the possibility of the channel 
opening. Second, low‑affinity binding to pore‑lining residues 
of NMDAR blocks the channel.

The hypothesis of NMDAR hypofunction in SCH origi‑
nated from the observation that a sub‑class of non‑competitive 
NMDAR  antagonists,  phencyclidine  (PCP)  and  ketamine, 
induces  behaviors  suggestive  of  all  three  symptoms  of 
schizophrenia  in  human  subjects  (positive,  negative,  and 
cognitive) (33,133,134) (Fig. 1). Functional NMDAR blockade 
appears to occur in cortical GABAergic interneurons in both 
PCP/ketamine drug abuse and anti‑NMDAR encephalitis.

7. Conclusions, clinical implications and future perspectives

Zn is considered a possible diagnostic biomarker associated with 
SCH since its altered homeostasis can contribute to abnormal 
glutamatergic neurotransmission, inflammation, neurodegen‑
eration and autoimmune abnormalities. It has been proposed by 
researchers that a number of patients with SCH could benefit 
from the use of Zn alone (94), or in combination with vitamins

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the inhibitory effects of Zn on NMDARs. (A) High‑affinity binding of Zn to the GluN2A subunit of NMDAR causes 
allosteric inhibition and attenuates channel opening. (B) Low‑affinity binding of Zn to pore‑lining residues of the NMDAR blocks the channel. Zn deficiency 
and disrupted Zn transport dynamics (e.g., in the presence of SLC39 gene mutations) could account for abnormal NMDAR function and altered glutamatergic 
neurotransmission in schizophrenia. The model of NMDAR hypofunction and the consequent inability to downregulate prefrontal glutamatergic neurons is 
widely accepted by researchers and clinicians, especially since the induction of schizophrenia‑like symptoms has been detected following the administration 
of ketamine and phencyclidine in healthy subjects. Created in BioRender. Stefanou, M. (2025) https://BioRender.com/mcf93wr. NMDAR, NMDA receptor;

C, E and B6 (96,98,99). Furthermore, studies have suggested 
that prenatal supplementation of Zn during the gestation period 
may mitigate LPS‑induced rat models of maternal immune 
activation (101‑104). Notably, in a number of animal studies, 
Zn has been shown to exert an antipsychotic therapeutic effect 
on rats and mice (100,105,106), and when supplemented in rats 
during pregnancy it may mitigate LPS‑induced abnormalities 
in working memory, GAD67 mRNA levels, object recogni‑
tion and inflammation in the hippocampus (101‑103). More 
studies are required to determine whether Zn can also mitigate 
LPS‑induced abnormalities in humans.

Notably,  there  are  just  a  few  human  RCTs  exploring 
the  effect  of  Zn  treatment  on  patients  with  psychosis. 
Mortazavi et al (94) demonstrated an increased antipsychotic 
efficacy (positive results regarding PANSS subscale scores 
and aggression) of a combination of Zn and risperidone in 
patients with psychosis vs. controls. Similar results to those 
of Mortazavi et al (94) were reported by Tokdemir et al (62); 
this previous study reported that mean plasma Zn values were 
significantly lower in criminal subjects with SCH vs. noncrim‑
inal subjects with SCH. Furthermore, Walsh et al (135) reported 
that serum Cu/plasma Zn concentration in young men with 

violent behavior was 1.40 compared with 1.02 in noncriminal 
controls.  Estimating  Zn  and  Cu  plasma  concentrations  in 
patients with psychosis exhibiting aggression, and treatment of 
these patients with Zn may prove helpful in the mitigation of 
this symptom. However, there were limitations in the study by 
Mortazavi et al (94): The sample size was small, side effects 
were not noted in detail, there was a short follow‑up period, 
and plasma Zn concentrations were not available. In the study 
by Russo and de Vito (98) an improvement only in anxiety was 
observed in patients with SCH following administration of Zn 
in combination with vitamins C, E, and B6. Future studies 
that include an increased number of patients from various 
countries, with a longer follow‑up period than that used in the 
previous study (94) could provide more information regarding 
the therapeutic use of Zn in psychosis. Furthermore, a specific 
treatment target for these studies could be aggression in patients 
with psychosis, as it was demonstrated in Mortazavi et al (94) 
and Tokdemir et al (62). In conclusion, Zn may help a number 
of patients with psychosis by alleviating psychotic symptoms; 
consequently, patients may demonstrate better adherence to 
treatment (17), while the quantity of psychotic drugs needed 
could be reduced leading to fewer adverse effects.
