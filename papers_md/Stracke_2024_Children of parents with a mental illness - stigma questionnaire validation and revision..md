Introduction: Mental disorders are often stigmatized in society. The stigma of
mental illness affects people with a mental illness themselves as well as their
family members—a phenomenon called stigma by association (SBA). Children of
parents with a mental illness (COPMI) are a particular vulnerable group for SBA. In
our systematic review, experienced SBA, anticipated SBA, afﬁliate SBA, and
structural discrimination were identiﬁed as relevant stigma dimensions for
children of parents with a mental illness. To assess SBA in adolescents who
grow up with a parent with a mental illness, the COPMI-SQ was developed.

Methods: N = 930 adolescents completed the study. Of those, N = 380
adolescents (sample 1; 72.6% female, mean age 17.12 (SD = 2.01) years)
reported growing up with at least one parent with a mental
illness. Using
conﬁrmatory (CFA) and exploratory factor analyses (EFA) as well as standard
item and reliability analyses, we analyzed and revised the COPMI-SQ in the ﬁrst
sample. To validate the factorial structure of the revised COPMI-SQ, CFA was
also conducted in the independent sample of the other N = 550 adolescents
(sample 2; 80.0% female, mean age 16.36 (SD = 1.98) years) who reported not
growing up with a parent with a mental
illness. To test four measurement
invariance, a multiple-group CFA was conducted in the combined sample of
adolescents who reported growing up with and without a parent with a mental
illness (sample 1 and sample 2).

Results: CFA in sample 1 resulted in an inadequate model ﬁt for the theoretically
assumed four-factor structure (CFI = .687; RMSEA = .064 (90% CI = .062–.066);
SRMR = .092; AIC = 229 155.63). Following EFA and item and reliability analyses in
sample 1, the COPMI-SQ was reduced to four scales (“Experienced SBA,” “Afﬁliate
SBA,” “Shame,” and “Anticipated SBA”) and two additional screening scales
(“Healthcare” and “Social support”). To facilitate questionnaire use, only the
three best items were retained in each scale, reducing the total item number
to 12 plus ﬁve additional screener items. CFA in sample 2 also resulted in an
inadequate model ﬁt for the theoretically assumed four factor structure (CFI =
.667; RMSEA = .065 (90% CI = .063–.066); SRMR = .101; AIC = 335 651.99). In
comparison, the ﬁnal version of the COPMI-SQ-r showed the best model ﬁt
(CFI = .945; RMSEA = .062 (90% CI = .052–.072); SRMR = .049; AIC = 60 008.05).
In the multiple-group CFA (sample 1 and sample 2), metric invariance was

established (c2 (208) = 481.58, p < .001; CFI = .939; RMSEA = .053 (90% CI = .047-
.059); SRMR = .056). In sample 2, internal consistency was found to be good for
the total scale (a = .84) and almost acceptable to almost good for the subscales
(a = .64 to.78).

Discussion: The revised version of the COPMI-SQ (COPMI-SQ-r) is a reliable and
economic questionnaire to assess SBA in adolescents who grow up with a parent
with a mental illness. The COPMI-SQ-r can be used to help develop and evaluate
anti-stigma and general interventions for affected adolescents.

1 Introduction

Since mental disorders are still frequently stigmatized in society,
the World Health Organization (WHO) calls in its “Comprehensive
Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030” for targeted actions to lower
the stigmatization of people with mental disorders (1). The term
stigma (Greek for stab, burn, or wound mark) goes back to the
ancient Greeks, who cut or burned marks into the skin of criminals
or slaves to identify them as corrupt or immoral people to be
avoided (2). Today, stigmatization is understood as a process in
which individuals are assigned to a group based on a characteristic
or trait that is consensually categorized by society as deviating from
the norm and therefore devaluated (3, 4). Stigmata are not inherent
in the individuals themselves but are social constructs and depend
on historically shaped cultural norms (4). The process of
stigmatization consists of cognitive (stereotypes), emotional
(prejudices), and behavioral (discrimination) components (5, 6).
Stereotypes are simpliﬁed and generalized knowledge structures
about social groups. The approval of the existing stereotype in
association with negative emotions creates a prejudice, which, in
turn, can result in a behavioral reaction in the form of
discrimination (5, 6). Taken together, stereotypes and prejudices
in the society are also referred to as public stigma (7). Negative
stereotypes of people with mental disorders include stereotypical
assumptions of character weakness, incompetence, dangerousness,
or unpredictability (6, 8). The stigmatization of people with mental
disorders is associated with serious and far-reaching consequences
for those affected. Some authors argue that the consequences of
stigma are actually worse than those of the mental disorder itself (9).
Experiences of discrimination due to a mental disorder can lead to
less help seeking (10), social isolation, hopelessness, and suicidal
thoughts from internalizing the stigma (11). For those affected by
stigmatization, three mechanisms are known to be most relevant
(5): experienced stigma, anticipated stigma, and internalized stigma.
Whereas experienced stigma refers to personally experienced
stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminations in past or present,

anticipated stigma represents the expectation of stigmatization in
the future. Last but not least, internalized stigma, which is also called
self-stigma (12), is deﬁned as the internalization of stereotypes and
prejudices to the self.

Regarding various discredited groups affected by stigmatization
(e.g., people with AIDS, physical or mental illness), there is evidence
that both the trait-bearing individuals themselves experience and
expect stigmatization as well as people associated with them (13–
16). This form of stigmatization, ﬁrst referred to as courtesy stigma
(2), is nowadays called stigma by association (SBA) (17). SBA
depends on the entitativity, that is, the degree to which the trait-
bearing individual and other associated people are perceived as a
social unit. Since the highest degree of entitativity is attributed to
families (17, 18), family members carry a higher risk of experiencing
SBA. When SBA exists within families, it is also called family stigma
(19). In terms of the stigmatization of people with mental disorders,
this means that the whole family system experiences stigmatization
due to the mental illness of one family member. Embarrassment,
shame, guilt, and fear of contamination are reportedly frequent
consequences of family stigma concerning mental illness (20–22).
Worldwide, every fourth child and adolescent grows up with at
least one parent with a mental illness (23, 24). Children and
adolescents who grow up with a parent with a mental illness are a
particularly vulnerable group to develop a mental disorder
themselves (25–28). A recent large meta-analysis reported a
lifetime risk of 55% among those children and adolescents to
develop any mental disorder (27), whereby subclinical symptoms
occur more often and earlier in life (29). Due to their close and
dependent relationship to their parents, these children and
adolescents are also considered to be particularly affected by SBA
(21, 30) and stigmatization has been identiﬁed as a potential social
mechanism in the transgenerational transmission of mental
disorders (TTMD) (29).

Thus, to reduce the stigma of mental illness in general and SBA
in children of parents with a mental illness speciﬁcally, we need to
develop general anti-stigma campaigns and targeted interventions

to reduce SBA in children and adolescents who grow up with a
parent with a mental illness (1, 31). To make this possible, a better
understanding of the speciﬁc stigma experiences of affected children
and adolescents is necessary, as are valid questionnaires to assess
this information. Analogous to the mechanisms concerning the
stigmatization of people with mental disorders in general (5), our
recent systematic mixed studies review identiﬁed experienced
stigma, anticipated stigma, afﬁliate stigma, and structural
discrimination as important stigma dimensions for children and
adolescents who grow up with a parent with a mental illness (32).
Afﬁliate stigma (33) can be understood as the SBA version of the
aforementioned internalized stigma or self-stigma (5, 12, 32, 33).
Structural discrimination refers to the societal and policy structures
perpetuating stigmatization (34). Since—to our knowledge—no
adequate scale measuring SBA in adolescents who grow up with a
parent with a mental illness exists, we developed the Children of
Parents With a Mental Illness-Stigma Questionnaire (COPMI-SQ)
(30) based on the identiﬁed stigma dimensions that are speciﬁcally
relevant for children and adolescents who grow up with a parent
with a mental illness (32). In our ﬁrst pilot study (N = 32), we
observed the COPMI-SQ’s promising psychometric properties, but
as our sample was too small, analysis of the factor structure of the
COPMI-SQ was not possible.

Therefore, the present study aims to report on the factor structure
of the COPMI-SQ and its validation in a larger sample. A valid
instrument to measure SBA in adolescents who grow up with a parent
with a mental illness will enable us to better understand their stigma
experiences and can be used to help develop and evaluate anti-stigma
and general interventions for affected adolescents.

2 Methods

2.1 Ethics

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Department of Psychology at Philipps University Marburg. Prior
to study participation, adolescents were given information about the
study and gave their informed consent. If they were under the age of
18, information was also given to their legal guardians, and their
informed consent was also obtained. Data were collected
anonymously. As long as the questionnaire was not submitted to
the online platform, participants could withdraw from answering
the questionnaire at any time and without giving any reason. In case
of distress due to study participation, participants could contact
clinically trained study personnel at any time. None of the
participants took advantage of this offer.

2.2 Participants

who reported not growing up with a parent with a mental illness
could also participate in this study and a parallel version of the
COPMI-SQ that only differed on item stem was presented to them.

2.3 Procedure

Participants were recruited Germany-wide through an ongoing
research project concerning children of parents with a mental
illness (23, 37), university mailing lists, and social media
advertising on Instagram and also by directly contacting (social)
services for children and adolescents who grow up with a parent
with a mental illness. Data were collected between January and
March 2023 using the online platform SoSci Survey (38)
(www.soscisurvey.de). The survey was programmed so that all
items had to be answered as it was otherwise automatically
the survey, participants
terminated. At
completed sociodemographic questions (age, sex, socioeconomic
status) as well as questions regarding their parents’ and their own
mental health. Socioeconomic status was assessed using the four
item Family Afﬂuence Scale and accordingly rated as low, medium,
or high (39). At the end of the survey, participants were offered to
take part in a prize draw as compensation for study participation.

2.4 COPMI-SQ

Based on a systematic review (32), the COPMI-SQ (30) was
created as an instrument to assess the stigma experiences of
adolescents who grow up with a parent with a mental illness in
daily life. According to theory, the items were expected to load on
the four different scales “Experienced SBA,” “Anticipated SBA,”
“Afﬁliate SBA,” and “Structural Discrimination”. In a ﬁrst pilot
study with N = 32, the item number of the COPMI-SQ was reduced
from initially 109 to 67. Items are rated from 1 (“does not apply at
all”) to 101 (“fully applies”) on a 100-point visual Likert scale.
Cronbach’s alpha for the subscales was good to excellent (a = .87
to.95), and excellent for the total scale (a = .98). Item difﬁculties
ranged between Pi = 15.00 and Pi = 77.69. Corrected item-whole
correlations for the subscales ranged between rit = .28 and rit = .91.
For the total scale, no corrected item-whole correlations were
reported. Further information is found in Table 1.

For adolescents who reported not growing up with a parent
with a mental illness, a parallel version of the COPMI-SQ was
created. All item stems were adapted without changing the meaning
of the items: e.g., “Because my mother/my father has a mental
illness, others make fun of my mother/my mother.” was
reformulated to “Because the parent of a child has a mental
illness, others make fun of the parent”.

Eligible participants were all German-speaking adolescents
between 12 and 21 years of age who reported growing up with at
least one parent with a mental illness. No further inclusion or
exclusion criteria were applied. Since recruiting children of parents
with a mental illness has proven to be difﬁcult (35, 36), adolescents

2.5 Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted with RStudio (40) using the
packages “psych” (41), “nFactors” (42), and “lavaan” (43). For all
analyses, p-values ≤.05 were set as thresholds for statistical signiﬁcance.

Since rules of thumb for conﬁrmatory factor analyses (CFA)
propose a ratio of number of items to number of participants (N) of
1 to 5 (44), a sample size of at least N = 335 was calculated in
advance (67 items to 335 participants).

Initially, a CFA with robust maximum likelihood estimations
was conducted in sample 1 to test the theoretically derived four-
factor structure of the COPMI-SQ. Goodness of ﬁt was assessed
using the chi-square test statistics, the c2/df ratio, the root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA), the standardized root
mean squared residual (SRMR), the comparative ﬁt index (CFI),
and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) (45, 46). According to
conventions, non-signiﬁcant chi-square test statistics, RMSEA <.08,
SRMR <.08, and CFI ≥.90 are regarded as good model ﬁt (45).
Concerning AIC, the model with the lowest value is regarded as the
best model ﬁt, as it is the most parsimonious one (46). This also
applies to the c2/df ratio, although values between 2 and 3 are also
considered a good ﬁt here (47).

Since an inadequate model ﬁt was found for the theoretically
derived four-factor structure, subsequent exploratory factor
analyses (EFA) were conducted in sample 1 to further investigate
the factor structure of the COPMI-SQ. Using Bartlett’s test (48) and
Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) criterion (49, 50), the suitability of the
data for EFA was tested. EFA was conducted using maximum-
likelihood factor analysis with promax rotation. Factor extraction
was based on Velicer’s MAP test and Horn’s parallel analysis as well
as content considerations (51). Step by step, all items with factor
loadings <.3 or with factor cross loadings ≤.2 were removed and
EFA repeated until a clear factorial structure was found. At all steps,
Bartlett’s test and Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin criterion were used to test
the suitability of the data for EFA, and factor extraction was based
on MAP test, parallel analysis, and content considerations.

Subsequently, item analyses were performed in sample 1 based
on item difﬁculties, item discriminatory power (corrected item-
whole correlations), and Cronbach’s alpha if the item is deleted.
Furthermore, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated as reliability
coefﬁcient of the scales and subscales. If scales consisted of fewer
than three items, the Spearman–Brown coefﬁcient rSB was used as
reliability coefﬁcient. Item and scale analyses were always ﬁrst

conducted for the subscales, then for the total scale. Cronbach’s
alpha of ≥.7 was deemed acceptable, ≥.8 good, and ≥.9 excellent
(52). The distribution of item difﬁculties was aimed to be 20 ≤ Pi
≤
80 (53). Corrected item-whole correlations of.3 ≤ rit
≤.5 were
regarded as acceptable and.5 < rit <.07 as good discriminatory
power (53). All items with item difﬁculties Pi < 20 or Pi > 80 and
with corrected item-whole correlations rit <.3 were removed.

Results of the EFA were subjected to CFA in sample 2 to
conﬁrm the derived factor structure. Furthermore, a multiple-group
CFA was conducted in the combined sample of adolescents who
reported growing up with and without a parent with a mental illness
to test for measurement invariance.
(sample 1 and sample 2)
Finally, item analyses as described above were also performed in
sample 2 for the derived factor structure.

3 Results

3.1 Participants

Our survey was accessed 6,649 times. Among the participants,
2,512 gave informed consent, 2,312 met the inclusion criteria
(language, age), and 930 completed the survey. Of these, 380 also
reported growing up with at least one parent with a mental illness
and were included in sample 1. The remaining 550 adolescents who
reported that their parents have no a mental illness were included in
sample 2.

In sample 1, participating adolescents were mostly female
(72.6%) and on average 17.12 years old (SD = 2.01). Almost all
adolescents reported a medium (45.3%) to high (47.1%)
socioeconomic status. 91.3% of the participating adolescents
indicated having a mental illness themselves. Of those, almost
half (46.4%) reported having more than one relevant diagnosis
and 59.4% stated that they were undergoing treatment for their
mental illness. Adolescents’ mental disorders were mostly classiﬁed
as depressive disorders (62.0%), other symptoms (34.5%), and
anxiety disorders (27.4%). Concerning the parental mental illness,
almost half (47.1%) of the participating adolescents reported that

only their mother and 24.5% that only their father was affected.
28.4% of the adolescents reported that both their parents were
affected. Most common parental disorders were depressive
disorders (61.3% for mothers, 55.2% for fathers), personality
disorders (13.9% for mothers, 12.4% for fathers), and other
symptoms (12.9% for mothers, 14.4% for fathers). More than one

relevant diagnosis was reported for 26.8% of the mothers and for
21.4% of the fathers reported to have a mental illness. Furthermore,
participating adolescents indicated that 43.2% of the mothers and
30.8% of the fathers reported to have a mental illness were being
treated for their mental illness. More detailed sample characteristics
for sample 1 are provided in Table 2.

In sample 2, participating adolescents were mostly female (80.0%)
and on average 16.36 years old (SD = 1.98). Almost all adolescents
reported a medium (35.6%) to high (62.2%) socioeconomic status.
68.4% of the participating adolescents indicated having a mental
illness themselves. Of those, 35.6% reported having more than one
relevant diagnosis and 39.6% stated that they were undergoing
treatment for the mental illness. Adolescents’ mental disorders were
mostly classiﬁed as depressive disorders (54.0%), anxiety disorders
(33.0%), and other symptoms (26.6%). More detailed sample
characteristics for sample 2 are provided in Table 3.

3.2 Initial scale and item analyses
(sample 1)

between Pi = 8.01 and Pi = 84.30. Corrected item-whole correlations
for the subscales ranged between rit = .08 and rit = .75, and for the
total scale between rit = -.09 and rit = .68. Further information can
be found in Table 1.

3.3 Conﬁrmatory factor analysis of the
original COPMI-SQ scales (sample 1)

Testing the theoretically derived four-factor structure in sample
1 with a CFA resulted in an inadequate model ﬁt (c2(2138) =
5495.92, p <.001; RMSEA = .064 (90% CI = .062-.066); SRMR =
.092; CFI = .687; AIC = 229 155.63) (see Table 4).

Initially,

item and scale analyses were conducted for the
theoretically derived four-factor structure in sample 1. Cronbach’s
alpha was good to excellent (a >.89) for all subscales as well as the
total scale (a = .95), except for the subscale “Structural
Discrimination” (acceptable with a = .71). Item difﬁculties ranged

Bartlett’s test (c2(2211) = 14,038.49, p <.001) and Kaiser–Meyer–
Olkin criterion (KMO = .92), the data were suitable for EFA. MAP
test recommended the extraction of nine, parallel analysis the
extraction of eight factors. Due to content considerations, eight
factors accounting for 41% of the variance were initially extracted.
Step by step, all items with factor loadings <.3 and with cross
loadings with differences ≤.2 were deleted and EFA repeated ﬁve
times. At all steps, Bartlett’s test and Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin criterion
revealed the data’s suitability for EFA. For factor extraction, we
considered the MAP test, parallel analysis, and content at all steps.
Finally, EFA resulted in seven factors explaining 49% of
the variance.

3.5 Item reduction 1 (sample 1)

The subscales’ items derived from the EFA and the reduced
total scale were named according to their content and then analyzed
and revised in sample 1 concerning their difﬁculty, discriminatory
power, and reliability. Detailed characteristics of the reduced scales
are found in Table 5.

Factor 1: All but one of the initial items in the ﬁrst factor were
part of the original “Experienced SBA” scale. Thus, factor 1 was
named “Experienced SBA”. Initial Cronbach’s alpha was a = .91.
Removing any item would not have increased Cronbach’s alpha. All

items showed desirable discriminatory power .5 < rit <.7. Nine items
showed item difﬁculties of Pi < 20 and were thus removed. After
removal, Cronbach’s alpha was almost acceptable (a = .67) for the
remaining three items. The discriminatory power of the remaining
three items was acceptable to desirable (.49 ≤ rit
≤.53) and item
difﬁculties ranged from Pi = 20.40 to Pi = 27.12.

Factor 2: All items in the second factor were part of the original
“Afﬁliate stigma” scale. Thus, factor 2 was named “Afﬁliate stigma”.
Initial Cronbach’s alpha was a = .88. Removing any item would not
have increased Cronbach’s alpha. All items showed desirable item
difﬁculties 20 ≤ Pi
≤ 80. Two items showed almost desirable
discriminatory power .46 ≤ rit
≤.5. All other items showed
desirable discriminatory power rit >.50. Thus, no items
were removed.

Factor 3: The items in the third factor were originally part of the
scales “Anticipated SBA” and “Afﬁliate stigma”. All items dealt with
aspects of keeping the parental mental disorder a secret or being
ashamed by the parental mental disorder, thus, factor 3 was named
“Shame”. Cronbach’s alpha was a = .80. Removing any item would
not have increased Cronbach’s alpha. All items showed desirable
item difﬁculties 20 ≤ Pi
≤ 80. One item showed almost desirable
discriminatory power of rit = .49. All other items showed desirable
discriminatory power rit >.50. Thus, no items were removed.

Factor 4: All items in the fourth factor were originally part of the
healthcare subscale of the “Structural discrimination” scale. Thus,

factor 4 was named “Healthcare”. Cronbach’s alpha was a = .74.
Removing one item improved Cronbach’s alpha to a = .81.
Afterward, all
three remaining items showed desirable
discriminatory power rit >.5 and desirable item difﬁculties 20 ≤
Pi

≤ 80. Thus, no further items were removed.
Factor 5: All items in the ﬁfth factor were originally part of the
“Anticipated SBA” scale. Thus, factor 5 was named “Anticipated SBA”.
Initial Cronbach’s alpha was a = .87. Removing one item would have
increased Cronbach’s alpha to a = .88. All items showed desirable
discriminatory power rit >.5. Since all items showed inacceptable item
difﬁculty Pi <.2, all items from factor 5 were removed.

Factor 6: All but one of the initial items in the sixth factor were
part of the original “Anticipated SBA” scale. Thus, factor 6 was named
“Anticipated SBA”. Initial Cronbach’s alpha was a = .71. Removing
one item improved Cronbach’s alpha to a = .77. Afterwards, one item
showed almost desirable discriminatory power of rit = .48. All other
items showed desirable discriminatory power rit >.5. All four
remaining items showed desirable item difﬁculties 20 ≤ Pi
≤ 80.
Thus, no further items were removed.

Factor 7: The items in the seventh factor were part of the
original “Experienced SBA” scale and dealt with having somebody
to talk to in times of need. Thus, factor 7 was named “Social
support”. Since factor 7 consists of only two items, Spearman’s
brown coefﬁcient (rSB) was calculated as reliability coefﬁcient.
Spearman’s brown coefﬁcient was acceptable with rSB = .67. All
items showed desirable discriminatory power (rit >.5) and item
difﬁculty (20 ≤ Pi

≤ 80). Thus, no items were removed.
Total scale: Cronbach’s alpha was a = .91 for the total scale.
Removing any item would not have improved Cronbach’s alpha. All
items showed desirable item difﬁculties 20 ≤ Pi
≤ 80. Five items
showed inacceptable discriminatory power rit <.3. Since all these
items loaded on factor 4 (“Healthcare”) as well as factor 7 (“Social
support”) those factors were excluded from calculating the total

scale. Since stigma experiences in the healthcare system (factor 4)
and social support (factor 7) were considered important aspects to
assess, the subscales were nevertheless retained as separate
screening scales. After excluding factors 4 and 7, Cronbach’s
alpha was a = .92. Removing any further item would not have
improved Cronbach’s alpha. All remaining items showed desirable
item difﬁculties 20 ≤ Pi
≤ 80 and acceptable to desirable
discriminatory power rit >.3.

3.6 Item reduction 2 (sample 1)

To enhance usability, the scales were further reduced in sample 1
to a maximum of three items per scale. For reduction, discriminatory
power, item difﬁculty, and Cronbach’s alpha were considered and
only the best items were retained. Detailed characteristics of the
reduced scales are found in Table 6. The ﬁnal items and scoring
instructions of the COPMI-SQ-r are found in Table 7.

Factor 1 (“Experienced SBA”), factor 4 (“Healthcare”), and
factor 7 (“Social support”): Since these scales already consisted of
only two or three items, no further items were removed.

Factor 2 (“Afﬁliate stigma”): Step-by-step, eight items were
removed. After removal, Cronbach’s alpha was a = .82.
Discriminatory power was acceptable to (very) good (.64 ≤
≤.71) and item difﬁculties ranged from Pi = 40.65 to Pi = 48.11.

Factor 3 (“Shame”): Step-by-step, three items were removed.

Pi = 20.46 to Pi = 39.13.

Factor 6 (“Anticipated SBA”): One item was removed. After
removal, Cronbach’s alpha was a = .75. Discriminatory power was

3.7 Results of CFA (sample 2)

Testing the theoretically derived four factor structure (model

(2138) = 7,093.22, p <.001; RMSEA = .065 (90% CI = .063–.066);
SRMR = .101; CFI = .667; AIC = 334 651.99) (see Table 8, model
A*). All calculated models based on EFA and item analyses revealed
a better model ﬁt according to AIC than the theoretically derived
four factor structure (see Table 8, models A*-F*). According to
RMSEA (RMSEA ≤.062), SRMR (SRMR ≤.056), and CFI
(CFI ≥.942), the COPMI-SQ-r with and without the additional
screening scales showed a good model ﬁt. Regarding AIC, a better
model ﬁt was observed for the COPMI-SQ-r without the additional
screening scales (AIC = 60 008.05).

revised instrument in sample 2. Detailed characteristics of the scales
are found in Table 9. The ﬁnal items and scoring instructions of the
parallel version of the COPMI-SQ-r are found in Table 10.

Factor 1 (“Experienced SBA”): Cronbach’s alpha was almost
acceptable with a = .68. Discriminatory power was acceptable to
good (.43 ≤ rit

with a = .69. Discriminatory power was almost acceptable to good
(.28 ≤ rit
≤.66) and item difﬁculties ranged from Pi = 57.78 to
Pi = 64.13.

Factor 6 (“Anticipated SBA”): Cronbach’s alpha was almost
acceptable with a = .64. Discriminatory power was almost
acceptable to good (.25 ≤ rit

4 Discussion

Mental disorders are still frequently stigmatized in society,
which has negative consequences not only for the people with a
mental disorder themselves but also for their family members. This
is known as stigma by association (SBA) (9, 13–17). Children of
parents with a mental illness carry an increased risk to experience
SBA, one of the assumed mechanisms of the transgenerational
transmission of mental disorders (25–29). To our knowledge, the
COPMI-SQ is the ﬁrst questionnaire to have been developed
assessing such stigma-speciﬁc experiences of adolescents who
grow up with a parent with a mental illness (30). Promising
psychometric properties were reported in an initial small pilot
study (30). In the current paper, we investigated the factorial
structure and psychometric properties of this instrument in a
larger sample and present a shortened and revised version—the
COPMI-SQ-r. The structure of the COPMI-SQ-r was identiﬁed in a
sample of adolescents who reported growing up with a parent with a
mental illness (sample 1): Using CFA, the structure was replicated
in an independent sample of adolescents who reported not growing
up with a parent with a mental illness (sample 2). Furthermore,
conﬁgural invariance was established in a multiple-group CFA in
the combined sample of adolescents who reported growing up with

Frontiers in Psychiatry

Stracke et al.

10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1376627

and without a parent with a mental illness (sample 1 and sample 2).
In the sample of adolescents who reported growing up with a parent
with a mental illness (sample 1), psychometric properties of the
COPMI-SQ-r were found to be acceptable to good. In the sample of
adolescents who reported not growing up with a parent with a
mental illness (sample 2), psychometric properties of the COPMI-
SQ-r were found to be almost acceptable to good.

The ﬁnal version of the COPMI-SQ-r consists of 12 items that
load on the four main subscales “Experienced SBA,” “Afﬁliate
stigma,” “Shame,” and “Anticipated SBA” (three items each).
Experienced stigma, anticipated stigma, and internalized stigma
have been identiﬁed as the most relevant mechanisms applying to
the primary recipients of stigmatization (5), and it has been argued
that SBA involves the same mechanisms (32).

The subscale “Experienced SBA” measures personally
experienced stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination in the
past or present. Having unmet emotional needs (e.g.,
inappropriate language and contents, withdrawal and rejection)
and experiencing hostile behaviors of others were identiﬁed as
important aspects of “Experienced SBA” (32) that are both
represented in the Experienced SBA subscale. Furthermore, one
item of this subscale relates to the belief of being contaminated,
which was originally thought to be part of the “Afﬁliate stigma”
dimension (30). In the literature, children of parents with a mental
illness have frequently been described as experiencing
“contamination stigma” (20, 22, 32). On the one hand,
contamination can refer to a “fear of inheriting their parent’s
illness” (55)—an aspect that, due to item reduction, is no longer
covered in the COPMI-SQ-r. On the other hand, contamination can
also refer to the fear adolescents experience as closely connected to
the parent with a mental illness and thus, also be considered to be
“crazy” (56). Since the present item (“I feel like I’m carrying around
a sign: ‘He/she has a mother/father with a mental illness.’”) refers
not to a fear but to actual experiences of adolescents being perceived
differently by others because of their parent’s mental illness, it
makes sense that this item is incorporated within the subscale
“Experienced SBA”.

The subscale “Anticipated SBA” captures the expectation of
stigmatization in the future, and fearing hostile behaviors of others,
fear of negative attitudes and ascriptions, and fearing others’ lack of
understanding and rejections were identiﬁed as important aspects of
“Anticipated SBA” in adolescents who grow up with a parent with a
mental illness (32). Even though the present items were originally
devised to speciﬁcally assess the aspect of fearing hostile behaviors
(30), we ﬁnd that they adequately capture “Anticipated SBA” in
general. Concerning stigmatization, discrimination (e.g., hostile
behaviors) is seen as the behavioral reaction to stereotypes and
prejudices (5, 6). Attitudes are considered to be an individual’s
positive or negative evaluation of a psychological object (57), which
largely resembles the deﬁnition of prejudices as the approval of an
existing stereotype in association with negative emotions (5, 6). The
inﬂuence of attitudes on behavior has been well established in the
theory of planned behavior (58). Therefore, we consider hostile
behavior to be both the observable and anticipatable consequence of
negative attitudes and of other’s lack of understanding.

“Afﬁliate stigma” can be understood as the SBA version of
internalized stigma (33), and refers to the internalization of
stereotypes and prejudices to the self (32). Perceiving themselves as
being contaminated and perceiving themselves as being inferior have
been identiﬁed as important aspects of “Afﬁliate Stigma” in adolescents
who grow up with a parent with a mental illness (32). Stigmatization is
understood as a process in which individuals are assigned to a group on
the basis of a discrediting characteristic or trait and are subsequently
devalued (3, 4). For adolescents who grow up with a parent with a
mental illness, this seems to lead to a feeling of being less valuable and
abnormal (32), a feeling the present subscale captures.

“Shame” was identiﬁed as a separate subscale of the COPMI-SQ-
r in this paper. Most of the items in this subscale were originally part
of the COPMI-SQ’s “Afﬁliate stigma” subscale. A recent integrative
review identiﬁed that stigma experiences of children and adolescents
who grow up with a parent with a mental illness often result in
feelings of shame and embarrassment, and subsequently the attempt
to hide the parental mental illness (21). This implies that “Shame” is
more of a consequence of the other stigma dimensions, and
therefore, it makes sense to assess it in a separate subscale.

illness (“Mental

Furthermore, the COPMI-SQ-r includes two additional
screening scales: “Healthcare” (three items) and “Social support”
(two items). The “Healthcare” subscale consists of the only items
retained from the COPMI-SQ’s “Structural discrimination”
subscale. Structural discrimination refers to the perpetuation of
stigmatization through societal and policy structures (34). The
original “Structural discrimination” subscale included a
heterogeneous item pool (e.g., concerning media, school, and
healthcare) and was not necessarily speciﬁc to the stigma

media.”). Due to their unspeciﬁcity and high heterogeneity, most
of the items were already eliminated during the EFAs in sample 1 as
load on speciﬁc factors. Considering that
they did not
stigmatization is a major issue in healthcare and has negative
effects on treatment seeking and recovery (59), we nevertheless
decided to keep these remaining three items as a separate screening
scale to assess speciﬁc stigmatization experiences of adolescents
who grow up with a parent with a mental illness in the healthcare
sector. In line with this, two items were found to load on a speciﬁc
“Social support” factor. Since social support is known to be an
important protective factor for mental health (60, 61), we also
decided to keep these items as a separate screening scale.

4.1 Limitations

Several limitations need to be considered regarding the present
study. Having reduced the COPMI-SQ’s item numbers from
initially 109 to now 17 (including the ﬁve screener items), some
aspects of SBA concerning children and adolescents who grow up
with a parent with a mental illness that appeared to be important in
the systematic review (32) (e.g., fear of contamination by the
parental mental disorder, structural discrimination in school or
media) are no longer assessable with the COPMI-SQ-r. Nevertheless,

Frontiers in Psychiatry

12

frontiersin.org

Stracke et al.

10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1376627

the COPMI-SQ-r still captures the most relevant different aspects of
stigma by association as reported in the literature (5, 20, 21, 32).
Furthermore, the item reduction enhances its usability for both
research and clinical practice. Recruiting adolescents who grow up
with a parent with a mental illness into research studies is challenging
(35, 36), but by social media advertising, we were able to recruit a large
sample of adolescents who reported growing up with at least one parent
with a mental illness. While our sample is large, it was not large enough
to randomly divide it into two subsample to explore and test the
factorial structure. Thus, an independent sample of adolescents who
reported not growing up with a parent with a mental illness and who
answered a parallel version of the COPMI-SQ that only differed on
item stem was used to validate the derived factorial structure. In a
multiple-group CFA, conﬁgural invariance was observed, but metric
invariance could not be established. This implies that even though the
factorial structure is the same between the different groups, results
from using the COPMI-SQ-r in samples of adolescents who report
growing up with and without a parent with a mental illness should not
be compared (62, 63). In future studies, the factorial structure of
COPMI-SQ-r should also be tested in other independent samples with
adolescent who report growing up with a parent with a mental illness.
Furthermore, our sample is self-selected and representativeness cannot
be assumed (35). Furthermore, all data were collected only through
self-report from the participating adolescents. Thus, reported parental
symptoms and diagnoses have not been clinically validated. In
addition, over 90% of participating adolescents indicated in sample 1
having a mental illness themselves. This number is much higher than
reported in other studies (24, 27, 30), but again, one must be bear in
mind that those are not clinically validated diagnoses and that the
sample might be biased due to the recruitment strategy used (35). On
the one hand, this high number of young people already affected
emphasizes the need for preventive interventions to break the vicious
circle of transgenerational transmission at an early stage (29, 64, 65).
On the other hand, this also means that adolescents’ responses may be
cofounded by stigma experiences regarding their own mental disorder.
Future studies should therefore aim to include more representative
samples with clinically validated diagnoses and with young people who
do not experience mental health challenges themselves. Nevertheless,
the reported rate of adolescents (59.4%), mothers (51.6%), and fathers
(30.8%) in sample 1 being treated for their mental disorders indicates
that the reported problems and symptoms are for the most part
clinically relevant. As the COPMI-SQ-r has been only validated in
German so far, its results are not generalizable to other cultures. In
future studies, the existing English translation should therefore be used
as a starting point to validate the COPMI-SQ-r in other languages and
cultures. Most of the COPMI-SQ-r items reveal high item difﬁculty,
meaning that few participants approved very highly of the items. To
assess a broader range of stigmatization experiences of adolescents who
grow up with a parent with a mental illness, future revisions of the
instrument should ideally include items with lower item difﬁculty.
Finally, yet importantly, as research in this ﬁeld progresses, the
COPMI-SQ-r’s concurrent and discriminant validity should be
investigated as well as its retest reliability. Only factorial and content
validity of the instrument has been ensured so far through the theory-
based approach that was complemented by an expert panel during the
piloting phase (30).

4.2 Implications

To reduce the stigma of mental illness in general and SBA in
children and adolescents affected by a parental mental illness
speciﬁcally, general anti-stigma campaigns and targeted
interventions to reduce SBA in affected children and adolescents are
needed (1, 31). One example is the Australian StigmaBeat project (66).
In a participatory approach with young people who are affected by
parental mental health challenges, ﬁlms aiming at reducing mental
health stigma were developed. The COPMI-SQ-r could be used to help
develop, adapt, and evaluate activities such as StigmaBeat.

4.3 Conclusion

We have described here the development and validation of the
COPMI-SQ-r transparently and in detail. The COPMI-SQ-r is a
theoretically grounded, methodologically sound, reliable, and
economic questionnaire to assess SBA in adolescents who grow
up with a parent with a mental illness, which can be applied in both
research and clinical practice, and it will enable us to better
understand the speciﬁc stigma experiences of adolescents who
grow up with a parent with a mental illness.
