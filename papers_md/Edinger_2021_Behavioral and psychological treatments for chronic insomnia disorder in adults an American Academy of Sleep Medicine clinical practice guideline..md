Introduction: This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the use of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia
disorder in adults.
Methods: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology to develop
recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The task force evaluated a summary of the relevant literature and the quality of evidence, the
balance of clinically relevant beneﬁts and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that underpin the recommendations. The
AASM Board of Directors approved the ﬁnal recommendations.
Recommendations: The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in choosing a speciﬁc behavioral and psychological therapy for the
treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adult patients. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength (“strong” or “conditional”). A “strong” recommendation
(ie, “We recommend…”) is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A “conditional” recommendation is one that requires that the clinician use
clinical knowledge and experience, and to strongly consider the patient’s values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

1. We recommend that clinicians use multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in

adults. (STRONG)

2. We suggest that clinicians use multicomponent brief therapies for insomnia for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL)
3. We suggest that clinicians use stimulus control as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL)
4. We suggest that clinicians use sleep restriction therapy as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in

adults. (CONDITIONAL)

INTRODUCTION

Chronic insomnia disorder is a common sleep disorder that leads
to impairment in health and functioning.1,2 This clinical practice
guideline is intended to update the previously published
American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on
the psychological and behavioral treatments of insomnia.3
This updated guideline, in conjunction with the accompanying
systematic review (SR),4 provides a comprehensive update of the
available evidence and a synthesis of clinical practice recom-
mendations for the psychological and behavioral treatments of
chronic insomnia disorder. It is intended to optimize patient-
centered care by providing actionable recommendations for
the use of speciﬁc behavioral and psychological treatments
in adults with chronic insomnia disorder. Separate clinical

practice guidelines for pharmacologic treatment of chronic
insomnia disorder are available.5

The treatment of chronic insomnia disorder should be based
on a diagnosis established using ICSD-3 or DSM-5 criteria,6,7
and a comprehensive clinical history. Historically, in some
settings patients have been offered only sleep hygiene as
treatment for their chronic insomnia disorder; however, stan-
dard of care should be to provide one of the recommended
interventions discussed within the guideline to patients with
chronic insomnia disorder, taking into consideration the ac-
cessibility and resource requirements when deciding on the
most appropriate treatment for a given patient. Follow-up care
to evaluate symptoms at the conclusion of treatment is indi-
cated, and residual sleep-related symptoms should be evaluated
and addressed.

Behavioral and psychological treatments for insomnia

METHODS

The AASM commissioned a task force (TF) of sleep medicine and
sleep psychology clinicians with expertise in chronic insomnia
disorder. The TF was required to disclose all potential conﬂicts of
interest (COI), per the AASM’s COI policy, prior to being appointed
to the TF and throughout the research and writing of the guideline
and SR documents. In accordance with the AASM’s conﬂicts of
interest policy, individuals were not appointed to the TF if they
reported a professional or ﬁnancial conﬂict that might diminish the
integrity, credibility or ethical standards of the guideline. Individuals
reporting professional or ﬁnancial conﬂicts that represented po-
tential bias, but did not prohibit participation in the development of
the guideline, were required to recuse themselves from discussion or
writing responsibilities related to the conﬂicts. All relevant conﬂicts
of interest reported by the TF are listed in the Disclosures section.
The TF conducted a SR of the published scientiﬁc literature,4
to answer two Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes
(PICO) questions related to the behavioral and psychological
treatments for insomnia in adults. The review focused exclu-
sively on efﬁcacy of behavioral and psychological interventions
of chronic insomnia disorder in adults, with and without
comorbid conditions (Table 1), compared to a control or minimal
intervention condition (PICO 1). The review also compared the
effectiveness of different intervention delivery methods (eg, in-
dividual, group, telehealth, internet-based programs, telephone;
PICO 2). The SR focused on the following critical patient-
oriented, clinically relevant outcomes: patient reported sleep
quality, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset and remission and
responder rates. The TF considered remission and responder
rates as the most inﬂuential critical outcomes for evaluating the
quality of evidence. The review did not include comparisons of
different interventions or combinations of pharmacotherapy
with behavioral and psychological therapy.

These clinical practice recommendations were then developed
according to The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, De-
velopment and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the
evidence and assign a strength of recommendation,8,9 based on the
literature that provided data suitable for statistical analyses of
the critical outcomes. The TF assessed the following four factors
to determine the direction and strength of a recommendation:
quality of evidence, balance of beneﬁcial and harmful effects,
patient values and preferences, and resource use. Details of these
assessments can be found in the accompanying systematic review.

Taking these major factors into consideration, each recommendation
statement was assigned a strength (“strong” or “conditional”).
When deemed necessary by the TF, additional information is pro-
vided in the form of “remarks” immediately following the rec-
ommendation statements. Remarks are based on the evidence
evaluated during the systematic review and are intended to
provide context for the recommendations and to guide clinicians
in the implementation of the recommendations in daily practice.
The recommendations in this guideline deﬁne interventions
that should meet the needs of most patients in most situations.
A “strong” recommendation is one that clinicians should follow
for almost all patients (ie, something that might qualify as a quality
measure). A “conditional” recommendation reﬂects a lower
degree of certainty in the appropriateness of the patient-care
strategy for all patients (Table 2 shows the implications of
recommendation strength). It requires that the clinician use
clinical knowledge and experience, and strongly considers the
individual patient’s values and preferences to determine the best
course of action. The ultimate judgment regarding any speciﬁc
care must be made by the treating clinician and the patient,
taking into consideration the individual circumstances of the
patient, available treatment options, and resources. The AASM
expects this guideline to have an impact on professional be-
havior, patient outcomes, and—possibly—health care costs.
This clinical practice guideline reﬂects the state of knowledge
at the time of publication and will be reviewed and updated
as new information becomes available.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The following clinical practice recommendations are based on a
systematic review and evaluation of evidence using the GRADE
process. The implications of the strength of recommendations
for guideline users are summarized in Table 2 and the rec-
ommendations for interventions are summarized in Table 3.
Remarks are provided as context for the recommendations and to
guide clinicians in the implementation of these recommendations.
There was insufﬁcient evidence to make recommendations
for speciﬁc delivery methods (eg, individual, group, internet,
self-help, video) for any of the treatments. For all treatments
except for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I),
there was insufﬁcient data to evaluate efﬁcacy within patient
subgroups (ie, with or without comorbidities). In addition, there

Almost all patients should receive the recommended course of action. Adherence to this
recommendation could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator.

Most patients should receive the suggested course of action; however, different choices may be
appropriate for different patients. The clinician must help each patient determine if the suggested
course of action is clinically appropriate and consistent with his or her values and preferences.

The ultimate judgment regarding the suitability of any speciﬁc recommendation must be made by the clinician.

were fewer than three studies meeting our inclusion criteria for
the use of cognitive therapy, paradoxical intention, mindful-
ness, biofeedback and intensive sleep retraining; as a result, no
recommendations are made about these treatments. A detailed
review of the data for all interventions can be found in the
accompanying systematic review.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)

Recommendation 1: We recommend that clinicians use
multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for
the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (STRONG)
Remarks: This recommendation is based primarily on stud-
ies in which CBT-I was delivered by a trained professional to
patients with and without comorbid conditions.

The TF made a strong recommendation in favor of CBT-I based
on a large body of moderate quality evidence from 49 studies,
including multiple, recent, large RCTs, showing clinically
meaningful improvements in critical outcomes, patients highly
preferring behavioral and psychological treatments, and fa-
vorable information on cost-effectiveness of CBT-I.

The TF assessed whether CBT-I improved patient-reported
critical outcomes: remission rate, responder rate, sleep quality,
sleep latency and wake after sleep onset. The TF identiﬁed 66
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adult patients diagnosed
with chronic insomnia disorder that compared CBT-I to wait-
list, minimal interventions, or placebo therapies. Forty-nine of
the studies provided data suitable for meta-analyses for at least
one critical outcome. Meta-analyses demonstrated clinically
signiﬁcant improvements in remission and responder rates with
CBT-I compared to control conditions. Of these 49 studies, 11
studies included patients with insomnia and no comorbidities,
six studies included patients with insomnia and comorbid
psychiatric conditions and 12 studies included patients with
insomnia and comorbid medical conditions. Each of these
patient groups was analyzed separately. Twenty studies in-
cluded a mix of patients with and without comorbidities and
were not separately analyzed. Meta-analyses of sleep quality
demonstrated clinically signiﬁcant mean improvements in
patients with insomnia and no comorbidities and patients with
insomnia and comorbid psychiatric conditions. Meta-analyses
of sleep latency and wake after sleep onset demonstrated
clinically signiﬁcant mean improvements in patients with in-
somnia and comorbid psychiatric conditions and in patients
with insomnia and no comorbidities. Meta-analyses of remis-
sion and responder rates were clinically signiﬁcant for all three
subgroups. The overall quality of evidence was moderate due to

imprecision. The quality of evidence was moderate for sleep
latency, remission and responder rates. Beneﬁts of CBT-I in-
clude treatment gains that are potentially durable over the long
term without the need for additional interventions. CBT-I may
reduce the need for pharmacologic therapy and thereby reduce
patient risk of drug-related adverse events. The principal harms
associated with CBT-I are symptoms of daytime fatigue and
sleepiness, mood impairment (eg, irritability), and cognitive
difﬁculties (eg, attention problems) during treatment; however,
these undesirable effects are primarily restricted to the early
stages of treatment, when behavioral therapies are introduced,
and improve over time, typically resolving by the end of
treatment. Based on clinical experience, the TF determined that
the beneﬁts of CBT-I strongly outweighed the short-term un-
desirable effects for adults with chronic insomnia disorder.
Clinicians should also note that when sleep restriction therapy is
used as a component of CBT-I, this treatment may be contra-
indicated in certain populations such as those working in high
risk occupations (eg, heavy machinery operators or drivers) or
those predisposed to mania/hypomania or with poorly controlled
seizure disorders. While cost of treatment varies by delivery
method, the cost-effectiveness of CBT-I is favorable, as CBT-I is
a time-limited treatment, and the limited available data suggests
signiﬁcant costs of untreated chronic insomnia disorder. The
clinical consensus of the task force was that CBT-I is preferred
because it has superior long-term effectiveness and improvement
in symptoms with minimal side effects as compared to control
conditions. Based on their clinical experience, the TF determined
that the vast majority of well-informed patients would choose
CBT-I for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder.

Brief therapies for insomnia (BTIs)

Recommendation 2: We suggest that clinicians use
multicomponent brief therapies for insomnia for the
treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in
adults. (CONDITIONAL)

The TF made a conditional recommendation in favor of BTIs
based on a small body of moderate quality evidence from 7 studies
showing clinically meaningful improvements in several critical
outcomes, consideration that many patients prefer brief treatments,
and the potential for BTIs to require only limited resources.

The TF assessed whether BTIs improved patient-reported
critical outcomes:
rate, sleep
quality, sleep latency and wake time after sleep onset. The
TF identiﬁed 11 RCTs in adult patients diagnosed with
chronic insomnia disorder that compared BTIs to wait-list,

STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR USE
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
(CBT-I)

Treatment Type*

Description

Multicomponent

CBT-I combines one or more of the cognitive therapy strategies with education
about sleep regulation plus stimulus control instructions and sleep restriction
therapy. CBT-I also often includes sleep hygiene education, relaxation training
and other counter-arousal methods. Treatment progresses using information
typically gathered with sleep diaries completed by the patient throughout
the course of treatment (typically 4–8 sessions).

CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE

Brief therapies for insomnia (BTIs)

Multicomponent

BTIs include abbreviated versions of CBT-I (typically 1–4 sessions)
emphasizing the behavioral components. BTIs typically consist of education
about sleep regulation, factors that inﬂuence sleep, and behaviors that
promote or interfere with sleep, along with a tailored behavioral prescription
based on stimulus control and sleep restriction therapy and on information
typically derived from a pretreatment sleep diary. Some therapies include brief
relaxation or cognitive therapy elements.

Stimulus control

Single-component A set of instructions designed to (1) extinguish the association between the

Sleep restriction therapy

Relaxation therapy

bed/bedroom and wakefulness to restore the association of bed/bedroom
with sleep; and (2) establish a consistent wake-time. Stimulus control
instructions are: (a) go to bed only when sleepy; (b) get out of bed when unable
to sleep; (c) use the bed/bedroom for sleep and sex only (no reading, watching
TV, etc. in bed); (d) wake up the same time every morning; (e) refrain from
daytime napping.

Single-component A method designed to enhance sleep drive and consolidate sleep by limiting
time in bed equal to the patient’s sleep duration, typically estimated from daily
diaries. Time in bed is initially limited to the average sleep duration, and
subsequently increased or decreased based on sleep efﬁciency thresholds,
until sufﬁcient sleep duration and overall sleep satisfaction is achieved.
Single-component Structured exercises designed to reduce somatic tension (eg, abdominal

breathing, progressive muscle relaxation; autogenic training) and cognitive
arousal (eg, guided imagery training; meditation) that may perpetuate
sleep problems.

CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION AGAINST USE

Sleep hygiene

use) and environmental factors (eg, light, noise, temperature) that may
promote or interfere with sleep. Sleep hygiene may include some education
about what constitutes “normal” sleep and changes in sleep patterns with aging.

Single-component A set of strategies including structured psychoeducation, Socratic questioning,

use of thought records, and behavioral experiments designed to identify
and modify unhelpful beliefs about sleep that may support sleep-disruptive
habits and/or raise performance anxiety about sleeping.

Single-component A variant of relaxation training that employs a device capable of monitoring
and providing ongoing feedback on some aspect of the patient’s physiology.
This technique has most commonly employed continuous monitoring of
frontalis electromyography (EMG) activity to assess the overall level of muscle
tension. Typically, the biofeedback device produces an ongoing auditory tone to
train the patient to relax by learning how to alter the auditory feedback tone in the
desired direction (eg, reduced muscle tone).

Paradoxical intention

Single-component Patients are instructed to remain awake as long as possible after getting

into bed. The patient is instructed to purposefully engage in the feared
activity (staying awake) in order to reduce performance anxiety and conscious
intent to sleep that confound associated goal-directed behavior (falling asleep).
This method alleviates both the patient’s excessive focus on sleep and
anxiety over not sleeping; as a result, sleep becomes less difﬁcult to initiate.

homeostatic sleep drive in order to reduce both sleep onset difﬁculties and
sleep misperception. Following a night wherein the patient limits time in
bed to no more than 5 hours, the treatment includes a 24-hour laboratory
protocol in which the patient is given an opportunity to fall asleep every
30 minutes in sleep-conducive conditions. If sleep occurs the patient is
awakened after three minutes and remains awake until the subsequent
30-minute trial. For each sleep opportunity, the patient is given feedback as
to whether or not sleep occurred.
Mindfulness approaches are used as a form of meditation, emphasizing
nonjudgmental state of heightened or complete awareness of one’s
thoughts, emotions, or experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.
Mindfulness therapies are typically administered in a group format. Structured
exercises teach momentary awareness, self-acceptance, and muted reactivity.
Home practice of mindfulness exercises is required. When applied to
people with insomnia, standard mindfulness is often combined with other
insomnia therapies such as stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, and
sleep hygiene (described above).

minimal interventions, or placebo, out of which 7 RCTs pro-
vided data suitable for meta-analyses for at least one critical
outcome. Meta-analyses showed clinically signiﬁcant
im-
provements in remission rate, responder rate and sleep quality.
The overall quality of evidence was moderate due to im-
precision. In addition to beneﬁts of treatment, BTIs may use
fewer resources than CBT-I as fewer treatment sessions are
required. Similar to CBT-I, the TF determined that the un-
desirable effects of BTIs are minimal and short-term, and that
the balance of beneﬁts vs harms favors the use of BTIs over
control conditions. Clinicians should also note that when sleep
restriction therapy is used as a component of BTIs, this treatment
may be contraindicated in certain populations such as those
working in high risk occupations (eg, heavy machinery oper-
ators or drivers) or those predisposed to mania/hypomania
or with poorly controlled seizure disorders. Based on their
clinical experience the TF determined that the vast majority of
well-informed patients would choose BTIs for the treatment of
chronic insomnia disorder.

Stimulus control

rate, responder rate, sleep quality, sleep latency and wake time after
sleep onset. The TF identiﬁed 8 RCTs in adult patients diagnosed
with chronic insomnia disorder that compared stimulus control
to wait-list, minimal interventions, or placebo, all of which
provided data suitable for meta-analyses for at least one critical
outcome. These studies demonstrated clinically signiﬁcant
improvements in remission rate.

The overall quality of evidence was low due to imprecision
and risk of bias. Based on their clinical experience, the TF
determined that the potential beneﬁts of stimulus control out-
weighed the likely minimal risk and determined that
this
treatment may be appealing due to the sleep improvements it
produces. The TF noted that stimulus control may need to be
adapted for safety in some patient populations, such as those at high
risk for falls, with mobility issues, or using sedative-hypnotics. The
use of stimulus control may result in some cost and resource use
savings compared to multicomponent therapies such as CBT-I,
but such savings would be negligible compared to other single-
component
therapies. Based on their clinical experience
and limited available literature, the TF determined that the
majority of well-informed the patients would choose stimulus
control as a treatment for chronic insomnia disorder.

Recommendation 3: We suggest that clinicians use stimulus
control as a single-component therapy for the treatment of
chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL)

Sleep restriction therapy

The TF made a conditional recommendation in favor of stimulus
control as a single-component therapy based on a small body of
low quality evidence from 8 studies showing clinically meaningful
improvements in one critical outcome, consideration that some
patients may prefer stimulus control, and the potential for stimulus
control to require only limited resources compared to multi-
component or multistep single-component approaches.

The TF assessed whether stimulus control as a single-component
treatment improved patient-reported critical outcomes: remission

Recommendation 4: We suggest that clinicians use sleep
restriction therapy as a single-component therapy for
the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in
adults. (CONDITIONAL)

restriction therapy as a single-component therapy based on a
small body of low quality evidence from 6 studies showing
clinically meaningful improvements in several critical out-
comes, consideration that some patients prefer sleep restriction

therapy, and the potential for sleep restriction therapy to require
only limited resources.

The TF assessed whether sleep restriction therapy as a single-
component treatment improved patient-reported critical out-
comes: remission rate, responder rate, sleep quality, sleep latency
and wake after sleep onset. The TF identiﬁed 6 RCTs in adult
patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia disorder that compared
sleep restriction therapy to wait-list, minimal interventions, or
placebo out of which 4 RCTs provided data suitable for meta-
analyses for at least one critical outcome. These studies dem-
onstrated clinically signiﬁcant improvements in responder and
remission rates.

The overall quality of evidence was low due to imprecision
and risk of bias. Potential harms may occur in the early phases
of treatment such as increased daytime sleepiness and difﬁ-
culties with concentration, but these effects typically dissipate
as treatment progresses and time in bed is extended as sleep
improves. Patients may ﬁnd it challenging to adhere to sleep
restriction therapy due to shortened time in bed or the resulting
increase in daytime sleepiness or fatigue. In some cases (eg,
older adults, chronic pain, depression), patients may ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to identify meaningful activities to ﬁll the additional
time out of bed that is required by the sleep restriction protocol.

indicated in certain populations such as those working in high
risk occupations (eg, heavy machinery operators or drivers) or
those predisposed to mania/hypomania poorly controlled sei-
zure disorders or excessive daytime sleepiness. The use of sleep
restriction therapy may result in some cost and resource savings
compared to multicomponent therapies such as CBT-I, but
resource use is likely similar to other single-component ther-
apies. Based on their clinical experience, the TF determined that
the vast majority of well- informed patients would choose sleep
restriction therapy as a treatment of chronic insomnia disorder
if the treatment rationale is adequately explained and the patient
is monitored by a clinician during treatment.

Relaxation therapy

Recommendation 5: We suggest that clinicians use
relaxation therapy as a single-component therapy for
the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in
adults. (CONDITIONAL)

The TF made a conditional recommendation in favor of re-
laxation therapy as a single-component therapy based on a small
body of low quality evidence from 5 studies showing clinically
meaningful improvements in one critical outcome, consider-
ation that some patients prefer relaxation therapy, the fact that
most mental health providers are trained to deliver this form of
treatment, and the potential for relaxation therapy to require
only limited resources.

The TF assessed whether relaxation therapy as a single-
component treatment improved patient-reported critical out-
comes: sleep quality, sleep latency and wake after sleep onset,
remission rate, and responder rate. The TF identiﬁed 12 RCTs in
adult patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia disorder that
compared Relaxation Therapy to wait-list, minimal interventions,

or placebo, out of which 5 RCTs provided data suitable for meta-
analyses for at least one critical outcome. These studies demon-
strated clinically signiﬁcant improvements in responder rate and
sleep quality.

The overall quality of evidence was low due to risk of bias
and imprecision. The TF determined that the modest beneﬁts
of relaxation likely outweigh the minimal potential harms and
burdens. Based on their clinical experience, the TF determined
that relaxation therapy can be delivered at relatively low cost
and with minimal additional resources, given that many ther-
apists and clinical providers have training in relaxation therapy.
As a result, this treatment is widely available across clinical
settings. Based on their clinical experience, the TF determined
that majority of well-informed patients would choose relaxation
therapy as a treatment for chronic insomnia disorder.

Sleep hygiene

Recommendation 6: We suggest that clinicians not use sleep
hygiene as a single-component therapy for the treatment of
chronic insomnia disorder in adults. (CONDITIONAL)

Remarks: Although sleep hygiene is not recommended as a
single-component approach (ie, the only treatment) for patients
with chronic insomnia disorder, sleep hygiene may be included
in multicomponent interventions.

The TF made a conditional recommendation against use of sleep
hygiene as a single-component therapy based on indirect evi-
dence showing that sleep hygiene was less effective than other
treatments when used alone. Only two RCTs, which provided
low quality evidence, showed clinically meaningful improve-
ments in one critical outcome with sleep hygiene alone. Fur-
thermore, allocation of resources for sleep hygiene alone may
divert resources and delay the use of other single- or multi-
component behavioral interventions that are more effective.

The TF assessed whether sleep hygiene, as a single-component
treatment, improved patient-reported critical outcomes: remission
rate, responder rate, sleep quality, sleep latency and wake after
sleep onset. The TF identiﬁed three RCTs in adult patients
diagnosed with chronic insomnia disorder that compared sleep
hygiene to wait-list, minimal interventions, or placebo, of
which one RCT provided data suitable for posttreatment
comparisons of sleep hygiene and wait-list control for at least
one critical outcome. The study demonstrated a clinically
signiﬁcant higher responder rate in the sleep hygiene group
compared to control, although within the same study CBT-I
was superior to sleep hygiene alone. Those who showed im-
provement in the sleep hygiene group also made additional
behavioral changes such as standardizing their sleep schedules
without being told to do so.

The overall quality of evidence was low due to imprecision
and risk of bias. The potential beneﬁts of sleep hygiene as a
single-component therapy were considered by the TF to be
minimal and not more favorable compared to control conditions
overall. When sleep hygiene was used as a control group in
studies of other interventions, it was less beneﬁcial than active
treatments. Sleep hygiene education is considered inexpensive;
however, no formal cost analyses have been conducted, and this

minimally effective treatment may divert resources away
from more effective ones. The TF judged that any resources
utilized for a treatment without sufﬁcient evidence may be
considered unfavorable. Based on their clinical experience,
the TF determined that the vast majority of well-informed
patients would not choose sleep hygiene or beneﬁt from it
as a single-component therapy for the treatment of chronic
insomnia disorder.

DISCUSSION

The current recommendations were developed to guide treat-
ment decision-making as clinicians work with adult pa-
tients with chronic insomnia disorder. The recommendations
provided are based on a systematic review of the clinical

data when possible. The TF used the GRADE process for

the recommendations.

literature that

Psychological and behavioral treatments for chronic in-
somnia disorder comprise a variety of behavioral and cognitive
“nonpharmacologic” treatments for chronic insomnia disorder.
CBT-I is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, has the
most evidence available in the literature and is the only approach
to receive a Strong recommendation. The following consid-
erations should inform use of this intervention. First, CBT-I is a
multicomponent intervention, and the exact treatment com-
ponents vary across studies. All studies included sleep re-
striction therapy, stimulus control and some form of cognitive
therapy; however, the cognitive component varied widely.
Whether or not relaxation strategies or sleep hygiene were
included in the CBT-I regimen varied across studies as well. It
was beyond the scope of this CPG to recommend a speciﬁc
CBT-I protocol, and these variations did not appear to sys-
tematically impact the effectiveness of the treatment. In-person
one-on-one delivery of CBT-I by a trained CBT-I provider is the
most widely evaluated delivery method and is generally con-
sidered the best available treatment. While the number of trained
CBT-I providers is growing, health care professionals may have
difﬁculty identifying such providers and connecting patients
with them. Additionally, patients may face barriers to accessing
CBT-I, including higher out-of-pocket costs as compared to
medications, or locating a skilled provider in their geographic
region. Since CBT-I is typically provided by mental health
professionals, there may also be a perceived stigma in seeking
care. In light of variability in access and costs, clinicians should
discuss different CBT-I delivery modalities with their patients
(eg, in person individual treatment, group treatment, internet-
based programs), and align the delivery modality based on
availability, affordability, treatment format, duration and the
patient’s preferences and values.

Whereas CBT-I is the treatment of choice for most patients,
BTIs, sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control, and relaxation
therapy are also potentially useful interventions with minimal
undesirable effects, and thus all received Conditional recom-
mendations. These recommendations are based on a variable
number of studies across these therapies. In addition, there were

some interventions for which insufﬁcient evidence was avail-
able to make recommendations as single-component treatments
(paradoxical intention, intensive sleep retraining, biofeedback,
cognitive therapy and mindfulness). In some instances, research
is limited because some therapies are relatively new to the
insomnia treatment literature (eg, intensive sleep retraining)
while other, single-component therapies (eg, cognitive therapy)
have been incorporated into CBT-I, resulting in an absence of
studies comparing the single-component therapy to control over
time. Thus, it seems doubtful that the efﬁcacy of some single-
component therapies will be further evaluated in future re-
search. The TF felt that these therapies should still be considered
as viable treatment alternatives when CBT-I is not available
or not desired by, or appropriate for, the patient. Challenges
with ﬁnding providers skilled in delivering BTIs or single-
component therapies remain, as many providers do not receive
training in any sleep-speciﬁc modalities. While sleep hygiene is
not recommended to be used by itself, as a single-component
therapy, due to the lack of evidence for its efﬁcacy, certain
common-sense principles of sleep hygiene (eg, avoiding ex-
cessive caffeine or alcohol) may nevertheless be helpful in a
comprehensive treatment approach, and consideration of sleep
hygiene factors is a common element of CBT-I. The principles
of sleep hygiene are now widely available to patients as gen-
eral health information, and clinician time should be allocated
to delivery of interventions with the best evidence. As such,
clinical care devoted to sleep hygiene as a single-component
approach may impact the availability of clinical care devoted to
more effective single- or multicomponent treatments Based
on these evidence-based recommendations, clinicians should
spend time and resources offering CBT-I, BTIs or one of the
single-component therapies discussed above to patients with
insomnia disorder, rather than providing sleep hygiene alone.
Education of front-line providers on more effective alternatives
to sleep hygiene is needed.

Some of the challenges patients face when undergoing any
of these psychological treatments include the ability to attend
sessions and adhere to treatment recommendations. In most
cases, a noticeable improvement in insomnia symptoms is not
immediate (as is the case with pharmacological interventions),
and CBT-I treatment typically ranges from 4–8 visits, both of
which may serve as barriers to treatment completion. Patients
may also get discouraged if immediate results are not ob-
served. It is important for the treating provider to recognize
these challenges and help set realistic expectations before
starting treatment. When discussing treatment options for
chronic insomnia disorder, patients should be reminded
that psychological and behavioral insomnia therapies typi-
cally produce gradual improvements in insomnia symptoms,
but the beneﬁts are durable beyond the end of treatment.
Available evidence suggests that the initial undesirable ef-
fects (eg, sleepiness and fatigue) are typically mild and re-
solve quickly for most patients. In selecting appropriate
treatments, clinicians should additionally consider comorbid
medical and psychiatric conditions that may change the bal-
ance of beneﬁts vs harms (eg, the potential adverse effects
of treatment-induced sleep deprivation on seizure disorder
or bipolar disorder).
