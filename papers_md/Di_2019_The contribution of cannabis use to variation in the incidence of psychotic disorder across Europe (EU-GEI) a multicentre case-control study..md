Summary
Background Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of later psychotic disorder but whether it affects incidence 
of the disorder remains unclear. We aimed to identify patterns of cannabis use with the strongest effect on odds of 
psychotic  disorder  across  Europe  and  explore  whether  differences  in  such  patterns  contribute  to  variations  in  the 
incidence rates of psychotic disorder.

Methods We included patients aged 18–64 years who presented to psychiatric services in 11 sites across Europe and 
Brazil with first-episode psychosis and recruited controls representative of the local populations. We applied adjusted 
logistic  regression  models  to  the  data  to  estimate  which  patterns  of  cannabis  use  carried  the  highest  odds  for 
psychotic disorder. Using Europe-wide and national data on the expected concentration of Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC)  in  the  different  types  of  cannabis  available  across  the  sites,  we  divided  the  types  of  cannabis  used  by 
participants into two categories: low potency (THC <10%) and high potency (THC ≥10%). Assuming causality, we 
calculated the population attributable fractions (PAFs) for the patterns of cannabis use associated with the highest 
odds of psychosis and the correlation between such patterns and the incidence rates for psychotic disorder across the 
study sites.

Findings Between May 1, 2010, and April 1, 2015, we obtained data from 901 patients with first-episode psychosis 
across 11 sites and 1237 population controls from those same sites. Daily cannabis use was associated with increased 
odds of psychotic disorder compared with never users (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3·2, 95% CI 2·2–4·1), increasing to 
nearly five-times increased odds for daily use of high-potency types of cannabis (4·8, 2·5–6·3). The PAFs calculated 
indicated that if high-potency cannabis were no longer available, 12·2% (95% CI 3·0–16·1) of cases of first-episode 
psychosis could be prevented across the 11 sites, rising to 30·3% (15·2–40·0) in London and 50·3% (27·4–66·0) in 
Amsterdam.  The  adjusted  incident  rates  for  psychotic  disorder  were  positively  correlated  with  the  prevalence  in 
controls across the 11 sites of use of high-potency cannabis (r = 0·7; p=0·0286) and daily use (r = 0·8; p=0·0109).

Interpretation Differences in frequency of daily cannabis use and in use of high-potency cannabis contributed to the 
striking variation in the incidence of psychotic disorder across the 11 studied sites. Given the increasing availability of 
high-potency cannabis, this has important implications for public health.

Introduction
Many countries have legalised or decriminalised cannabis 
use, leading to concerns that this might result in an in­
crease in cannabis use and associated harm,1,2 even if the 
latter  only  affects  a  minority  of  the  population.3  Cross­
sectional  and  prospective  epidemiological  studies4,5  as 
well as biological evidence6 support a causal link between 
cannabis use and psychotic disorder. Meta­analysis shows 
a  dose–response  association  with  the  highest  odds  of 
psychotic  disorder  in  those  with  the  heaviest  cannabis 

use.7 Nevertheless, it is not clear whether, at a population 
level, patterns of cannabis use influence rates of psychotic 
disorder.8–10

Research in context

Evidence before this study
The evidence reporting the dose-dependent association between 
cannabis use and psychotic disorders has been summarised in the 
meta-analysis by Marconi and colleagues. We searched PubMed 
for studies published up to March 31, 2018, that had specifically 
measured the impact of high-potency cannabis use on the odds 
of psychotic disorder (not psychotic symptoms or psychosis in 
general) or that had calculated the proportion of new cases of 
psychotic disorder arising in specific populations that were 
attributable to the use of high-potency cannabis, using the terms 
“psychotic disorders” and “high potency cannabis” or 
“skunk-super skunk” or “high THC cannabis”; we also included the 
term “population attributable fraction”. Finally, we searched for 
studies that reported the impact of any use of cannabis on the 
incidence of psychotic disorder or schizophrenia. Three studies 
met our inclusion criteria. Boydell and colleagues speculated that 
an increase in the incidence rates of schizophrenia between 1965 
and 1999 in south London might be related to the increase, over 
the same period, in the prevalence of cannabis use in the year 
before first presentation. Our two previous case-control studies 
showed that high-potency cannabis, especially when used daily, 
carries the highest risk for psychotic disorder and that, assuming 
causality, 24% of new cases of psychotic disorder in south London 
could be attributed to the use of high potency cannabis.

Added value of this study
This multicentre case-control study across ten European and 
one Brazilian site replicates the strong effect of daily use of 

high-potency cannabis on the odds for psychotic disorder in 
the whole sample—which, to our knowledge, is the largest to 
date to address this question. This effect was particularly 
visible in London and Amsterdam. Additionally, we show 
that, assuming causality, if high-potency cannabis types were 
no longer available, then 12% of cases of first-episode 
psychosis could be prevented across Europe, rising to 30% in 
London and 50% in Amsterdam. Most importantly, we 
provide the first direct evidence that cannabis use has an 
effect on variation in the incidence of psychotic disorders. 
We show that differences in the prevalence of daily use of 
cannabis, and in use of high-potency cannabis, among the 
controls from the different study sites made a major 
contribution to the striking variations in the incidence rates 
of psychotic disorder that we have previously reported across 
the same sites.

Implications of all available evidence
In the context of the well reviewed epidemiological and 
biological evidence of a causal link between heavy cannabis use 
and psychotic disorders, our findings have substantial 
implications for mental health services and public health. 
Education is needed to inform the public about the mental 
health hazards of regular use of high-potency cannabis, which is 
becoming increasingly available worldwide.

the  populations  studied  might  contribute  to  these 
variations.

1000  population­based  controls  during  the  same 
period.

Therefore,  using  data  from  the  EU­GEI  case­control 
study  of  first­episode  psychosis  and  the  previously 
published  data  on  incidence,12  we  sought  to  describe 
differences  in  patterns  of  cannabis  use  across  sites, 
identify the measure of cannabis use with the strongest 
impact  on  odds  of  psychotic  disorder  across  sites, 
calculate  the  population  attributable  fraction  (PAF)  for 
the patterns of cannabis use associated with the highest 
odds  for  psychosis,  and  test  whether  differences  in 
patterns  of  cannabis  use  contribute  to  variations  in  the 
incidence of psychotic disorder across sites.

Methods
Study design
The EU­GEI project set out to estimate the incidence of 
psychosis and recruit first­episode psychosis cases and 
controls  to 
investigate  risk  factors  for  psychotic 
disorder.  First,  incidence  rates  were  estimated12  by 
identifying  all  individuals  with  a  first  episode  of 
psychosis  who  presented  to  mental  health  services 
between May 1, 2010, and April 1, 2015, in 17 areas in 
England,  France,  the  Netherlands,  Italy,  Spain,  and 
Brazil  (appendix).  Second,  to  investigate  risk  factors, 
we  attempted  to  assess  1000  first­episode  cases  and 

Participants
Patients presenting with their first episode of psychosis 
were  identified  by  trained  researchers  who  carried  out 
regular checks across the mental health services within 
the  17  catchment  areas  (one  site  per  catchment  area). 
Patients were eligible if they were aged 18–64 years and 
resident within the study areas at the time of their first 
presentation  with  a  diagnosis  of  psychosis  by  ICD­10 
criteria  (F20–33);  details  are  provided  in  the  supple­
mentary  methods  and  in  previous  publications.12  Cases 
were  approached  via  their  clinical  team  and  invited  to 
participate.  Using  the  Operational  Criteria  Checklist 
algorithm,  all  cases  interviewed  received  a  research­
based  diagnosis.13  Patients  were  excluded  if  they  had 
been  previously  treated  for  psychosis  or  if  they  met 
criteria  for  organic  psychosis  (F09)  or  for  psychotic 
symptoms resulting from acute intoxication (F1X.5).

We  adopted  quota  sampling  strategies  to  guide  the 
recruitment of controls. Accurate local demographic data 
were used to set quotas for controls to ensure the samples’ 
representativeness of each catchment area’s population at 
risk  in  terms  of  age,  gender,  and  ethnicity.  Potential 
controls  were  initially  identified  on  the  basis  of  locally

available  sampling  strategies,  most  commonly  random 
sampling  from  lists  of  all  postal  addresses  and  from 
general  practitioner 
from  randomly  selected 
surgeries.  To  achieve  representation  of  hard­to­reach 
groups  (eg,  young  men),  we  then  tried  to  oversample 
them using more ad­hoc approaches such as internet and 
newspaper advertisements, and leaflets at local stations, 
shops, and job centres. Controls were excluded if they had 
received  a  diagnosis  of,  or  treatment  for,  psychotic 
disorder.

committees in each site.

EU­GEI

Measures
We  obtained  sociodemographic  data  using  the  Medical 
Research  Council  Sociodemographic  Schedule,  as 
described previously.14 An updated version of the modified 
Cannabis Experience Questionnaire15 (CEQ
) was used 
to  gather  detailed  history  of  use  of  cannabis  and  other 
recreational  drugs  (appendix).  To  minimise  recall  bias, 
none  of  the  recruitment  materials  for  cases  or  controls  
mentioned cannabis or referred to its potential role as risk 
factor  for  psychotic  disorder.  Participants  were  asked  if 
they had ever used cannabis in their lifetime; if the answer 
was  yes,  they  were  then  asked  to  give  details  on  their 
pattern  of  use.  Questions  on  the  type  of  cannabis  used 
made no reference to its potency and allowed partici pants 
to  report  the  colloquial  name,  in  any  language,  of  the 
cannabis they used.

We included six measures of cannabis use in the initial 
analyses,  including  lifetime  cannabis  use  (ie,  whether  or 
not the individual had ever used cannabis), currently using 
cannabis, age at first use of cannabis,16 lifetime frequency 
of use (ie, the frequency that characterised the individual’s 
most consistent pattern of use), and money spent weekly 
on cannabis during their most consistent pattern of use. 
Using data published in the European Monitoring Centre 
for Drugs and Drug Addiction 2016 report17 that reported 
the concentration of Δ⁹­tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the 
types  of  cannabis  available  across  Europe,  supplemented 
by national data for each included country,18–26 we created 
the final measure of cannabis potency (appendix).

Statistical analysis
We  used  complete  case  analyses  for  all  analyses  using 
Stata version 14. We used inverse probability weights to 
account for any oversampling of controls relative to the 
populations  at  risk  (appendix);  we  gave  each  control’s 
data  a  weight  inversely  proportional  to  their  probability 
of  selection  given  their  key  demographics  (age,  gender, 
and ethnicity) using census data on relevant populations. 
These weights were applied in all analyses.

To  identify  potential  confounders,  we  used  χ²  and 
t tests to test for an association between sociodemographic 
data and the data on drug use with case­control status in 
the whole sample. On the basis of the χ² and t tests, data 

on the use of other recreational drugs were included as 
confounders  in  the  main  analyses,  with  low  or  no  use 
scored as 0 and use scored as 1 in categorical variables: 
tobacco (never used or smoked <10 cigarettes per day vs 
smoked  ≥10  cigarettes  or  more  per  day);  stimulants, 
hallucinogens,  ketamine,  and  novel  psychoactive 
substances  (so­called  legal  highs;  never  tried  vs  ever 
tried); and mean number of alcoholic drinks consumed 
daily  on  an  average  week.  All  sociodemographic  and 
drug­use  variables  associated  with  case­control  status 
were controlled for in all analyses (appendix).

We  applied  adjusted  logistic  regression  models  to 
estimate the effect of each of the six measures of cannabis 
use on the odds of a psychotic disorder (ie, case status). 
The  data  have  a  multilevel  structure  because  cases  and 
controls are nested within sites. To take account of this 
clustering in the logistic regression analysis, we used the 
cluster  option  in  Stata.  We  fitted  interaction  terms  to 
logistic  models.  These 
interaction  models,  using 
likelihood  ratio  tests,  were  run  to  investigate  whether 
individual measures of cannabis use interacted with each 
other  to  significantly  increase  the  odds  ratios  (ORs)  for 
psychotic  disorder  and  whether  the  ORs  for  psychotic 
disorder  of  the  individual  measures  of  cannabis  use 
varied significantly by site.

The STATA punafcc command was used to calculate the 
population attributable fraction (PAF) with 95% CIs for 
the  two  cannabis  use  measures  that  carried  the  largest 
adjusted  OR  for  psychosis.  The  PAF  measures  the 
population effect of an exposure by providing an estimate 
of the proportion of disorder that would be prevented if 
the exposure were removed, assuming causality.

To  account  for  potential  selection  bias,  we  did  a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the STATA episensi 
command.27  This  analysis  assumes  that  we  can  assign 
prior  probability  distributions  for  the  bias  parameters, 
which  capture  the  uncertainty  about  those  parameters, 
and use these distributions in a probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (appendix).

Finally,  we  used  Pearson’s  correlation  to  test  for  an 
association  between  the  incidence  rates  for  psychotic 
disorder adjusted for ethnic minority status in each site 
and the prevalence of daily cannabis use and use of high­
potency  cannabis  in  the  controls  as  representing  the 
general population for each site.

Table 1: Sociodemographics and lifetime history of substance misuse across all included cases and controls

356  (23%)  refused  to  participate,  19  (1%)  could  not 
consent because of language barriers, and 14 (0·9%) were 
excluded  because  they  did  not  meet  the  age  inclusion 
criteria.  Patients  who  refused  to  participate  were  older 
(p=0·0015), more likely to be women (p=0·0063) and of 
white European origin (p<0·0001; appendix).

Thus,  1130  cases  took  part.  These  cases  were  broadly 
representative for gender and ethnicity of the incidence 
sample,  although  younger  (mean  age  31·2  years 
[SD 10·6], median 29 years [IQR 23–37] for cases vs mean 
34·5  years  [12·0],  median  31  years  [23·0–41·0]  for  the 

total incidence; p<0·0001; details by site are available in 
the appendix). All 17 sites contributed to the recruitment 
of  1499  population  controls  except  for  Maison  Blanche, 
which  was  con sequently  excluded  from  the  analysis 
(appendix).

Most  sites  had  minimal  missing  sociodemographic 
(≤3%) or CEQEU­GEI data (<5%). However, Verona, Santiago, 
Oviedo,  Valencia,  and  Cuenca  had  at  least  10%  of  data 
missing  on  the  measures  of  cannabis  use  or  on  one  or 
more of the main confounding variables; therefore, given 
their  small  sample  sizes  there  was  insufficient  data  to 
include  these  sites  in  the  analysis.  This  resulted  in 
901 cases and 1237 controls for analysis.

Compared  with  controls,  cases  were  younger,  more 
often  men,  and  from  ethnic  minorities,  than  the 
controls  (table  1).  Controls  were  more  likely  to  have 
pursued higher education (p<0·0001) and to have been 
employed  a  year  before  assessment 
than  cases 
(p<0·0001; table 1); the differences in gender, ethnicity, 
education,  and  employment  are  those  expected  when 
comparing  patients  with  psychosis  with  general 
population samples.

More  cases  than  controls  reported  having  ever  used 
cannabis, having smoked ten tobacco cigarettes or more 
a day, or having tried other recreational drugs (table 1). 
We  found  no  difference  between  cases  and  controls  in 
the  mean  number  of  alcoholic  drinks  consumed  every 
day  on  an  average  week  (5·2  drinks  [SD  0·4]  among 
controls  vs  4·8  drinks  [0·4]  among  cases;  median 
2·0  drinks  [IQR  0·0–6·0]  for  controls  vs  1·0  drink 
[0·0–4·0]; p=0·45).

An  adjusted  logistic  regression  model  showed  that 
those who had ever used cannabis had a modest increase 
in  odds  of psychotic disorder compared with those who 
had never used it (table 2); the odds were slightly greater 
in  those  who  started  to  use  cannabis  at  age  15  years  or 
younger.

Daily cannabis use was associated with increased odds 
of psychotic disorder compared with never having used it 
(table  2);  this  remained  largely  unchanged  when  taking 
into  account  age  at first  use  (OR  3·1,  95%  CI  2·1–5·2), 
money  spent  (2·9,  1·9–4·4),  and  type  of  cannabis  used 
(2·6,  2·0–3·9).  Those  who  spent  €20  or  more  a  week 
showed more than a doubling in the odds of a psychotic 
disorder  (2·5,  1·6–3·8),  which  dropped  to  1·3  (95%  CI 
1·0–2·1)  after  controlling  for  daily  use  and  type  of 
cannabis used; we observed no interaction between daily 
use and money spent (p=0·67).

Use  of  high­potency  cannabis  (THC  ≥10%)  modestly 
increased the odds of a psychotic disorder compared with 
never  use  (table  2);  this  remained  largely  unchanged 
after controlling for daily use (OR 1·5, 95% CI 1·1–2·6). 
Those  who  had  started  using  high­potency  cannabis  by 
age  15  years  showed  a  doubling  of  risk  (2·3,  1·4–3·1), 
without evidence of interaction (p=0·63).

of high­potency cannabis carried more than a four­times 
increase in the risk of psychotic disorder (OR 4·8, 95% CI

odds were lower for those who used low­potency cannabis

Table 3: PAFs for daily use of cannabis and use of high-potency cannabis in the whole sample and by site

cannabis was associated with the greatest increase in the 
odds for psychotic disorder compared with never having 
used:  four  times  greater  in  Paris,  five  times  greater  in 
London, and more than nine times greater in Amsterdam 
(figure 2).

Based  on  the  prevalence  of  daily  cannabis  use,  and 
use of high potency cannabis, in cases and controls and 
the  corresponding  adjusted  ORs,  we  estimated  the 
PAFs  for  the  whole  sample  and  for  each  of  the  sites 
(table  3).  Assuming  causality,  the  proportion  of  new 
cases  of  psychotic  disorder  in  the  whole  sample 
attributable to daily use was 20·4% (95% CI 17·6–22·0) 
and 12·2% (3·0–6·1) for use of high­potency cannabis 
(table 3).

The PAF analysis revealed variations by sites, ranging 
from  43·8%  (95%  CI  34·0–69·1)  of  new  cases  of 
psychotic  disorder  in  Amsterdam  being  attributable  to 
daily use to just 1·2% (0·8–15·4) of cases in Puy de Dôme. 
Furthermore, the PAF for use of high­potency cannabis 
ranged from 50·3% (27·4–66·0) of cases in Amsterdam 
to  1·9%  (0·6–16·3)  estimated  in  Bologna.  We  did  not 

calculate  the  PAF  for  Palermo  because  there  was  no 
main effect of use of high­potency cannabis on the odds 
for psychotic disorder.

The  probabilistic  sensitivity  analyses  we  ran  suggest 
that  selection  bias  is  unlikely  to  explain  our  findings 
(appendix). After correction for selection bias, the OR for 
daily cannabis use (5·7, 95% CI 3·5–9·4) was similar to 
the  original  OR  (5·7,  4·4–7·5).  However,  the  CI  for  the 
corrected  OR  was  wider  than  that  for  the  original  OR, 
suggesting a wider range of possible values for the true 
OR  with  95%  certainty.  The  results  of  the  probabilistic 
sensitivity  analysis  to  estimate  the  potential  effects  of 
selection bias on high potency cannabis use  were similar 
(appendix).

The EU­GEI incidence study reported an eight­times 
variation  in  the  incidence  rates  of  psychotic  disorder 
adjusted  for  age,  gender,  and  ethnic  minority  status 
across the study sites.12 We found a correlation between 
the  adjusted  incidence  rates  for  psychotic  disorder  in 
our 11 sites and the prevalence of daily cannabis use in 
controls  (r=0·8;  p=0·0109).  Sites  where  daily  use  was 
common  such  as  London  (26  [11·7%]  of  223  controls) 
and Amsterdam (13 [13·0%] of 100 controls) had among 
incidence  rates  (45·7  cases 
the  highest  adjusted 
per  100 000  person­years  in  London  and  37·9  per 
100 000 person­years in Amsterdam). This differed from 
sites such as Bologna where daily use was less frequent 
(three  [4·6%]  of  65  controls)  and  the  adjusted  in­
cidence  rate  was  half  that  of  London  (21·0    cases  per 
100 000 per person years; figure 3).

Similarly,  we  found  a  correlation  between  adjusted 
incidence rates for psychotic disorder and the prevalence 
of  use  of  high­potency  cannabis  in  controls  across  the 
11  sites  (r=0·7;  p=0·0286).  Amsterdam  (54  [54·0%]  of 
100 controls), London (58 [26·0%] of 223 controls), and 
Paris  (21  [21·0%]  of  100  controls)  had  the  highest 
prevalence  of  use  of  high­potency  cannabis  in  controls 
and the highest adjusted incidence rates for all psychosis 
(45·7  per  100 000  person­years  in  London,  37·9  in 
Amsterdam, and 46·1 in Paris; figure 3). The prevalence 
of  daily  use  and  the  prevalence  of  use  of  high­potency 
cannabis  in  controls  were  only  modestly  correlated 
(r=0·2;  p=0·0413),  therefore  we  report  data  for  both

Discussion
Our  main  findings  show  that  among  the  measures  of 
cannabis  use 
independent 
predictors of whether any given individual would have 
a psychotic disorder or not were daily use of cannabis 
and  use  of  high­potency  cannabis.  The  odds  of 
psychotic  disorder  among  daily  cannabis  users  were 
3·2  times  higher  than  for  never  users,  whereas  the 
odds  among  users  of  high­potency  cannabis  were 
1·6 times higher than for never users. Starting to use 
cannabis  by  15  years  of  age  modestly  increased  the 
odds  for  psychotic  disorder  but  not  independently  of

Figure 2: Fully adjusted ORs of psychotic disorders for the combined measure of frequency plus type of cannabis use in three sites
Data are shown for the three sites with the greatest consumption of cannabis: London (201 cases, 230 controls), Amsterdam (96 cases, 101 controls), and Paris 
(54 cases, 100 controls). Error bars represent 95% CIs. OR=odds ratio.

frequency  of  use  or  of  the  potency  of  the  cannabis 
used.  These  measures  of  extent  of  exposure  did  not 
interact with each other, nor did they interact with the 
sites.  This  lack  of  interaction  between  degree  of 
cannabis use (ie, daily use of cannabis or use of high­
potency  cannabis)  and  site  might  reflect  insufficient 
power  in  our  study;  however,  it  could  also  indicate 
that  although  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  might  vary 
depending  on  the  degree  of  cannabis  use,  there  is  a 
consistent  effect  of  daily  use  and  use  of  high­potency 
cannabis on the ORs for psychotic disorders across all 
study sites.

We  replicated  our  previous  finding28  that  daily  use  of 
high­potency  cannabis  is  most  strongly  associated  with 
case­control  status.  Compared  with  never  users,  par­
ticipants who used high­potency cannabis daily had four­
times higher odds of psychosis in the whole sample, with 
a five­times increase in London and a nine­times increase 
in  Amsterdam.  We  also  saw  that,  in  the  whole  sample, 
daily use of high­potency cannabis was associated with a 
doubling  in  the  OR  for  psychotic  disorder.  The  large 
sample size and the different types of cannabis available 
across  Europe  have  allowed  us  to  report  that  the  dose–
response  relationship  characterising 
the  association 
between cannabis use and psychosis7 reflects not only the 
use  of  high­potency  cannabis  but  also  the  daily  use  of 
types  with  an  amount  of  THC  consistent  with  more 
traditional varieties.

Use  of  high­potency  cannabis  was  a  strong  predictor 
of psychotic disorder in Amsterdam, London, and Paris 

where  high­potency  cannabis  was  widely  available,  by 
contrast with sites such as Palermo where this type was 
not  yet  available.  In  the  Netherlands,  the  THC  content 
reaches up to 67% in Nederhasj and 22% in Nederwiet; 
in  London,  skunk­like  cannabis  (average  THC  of  14%) 
represents  94%  of  the  street  market29  whereas  in 
countries  like  Italy,  France,  and  Spain,  herbal  types  of 
cannabis  with  THC  content  of  less  than  10%  were  still 
commonly used.17,18

Thus  our  findings  are  consistent  with  previous 
epidemiological  and  experimental  evidence  suggesting 
that  the  use  of  cannabis  with  a  high  concentration  of 
THC  has  more  harmful  effects  on  mental  health  than 
does use of weaker forms.28,30,31

The  novelty  of  this  study  is  its  multicentre  structure 
and  the  availability  of  incidence  rates  for  psychotic 
disorder for all the sites. This has allowed us, for the first 
time, to show how the association between cannabis use 
and risk of psychosis varies geographically depending on 
prevailing patterns of use, and how the latter contributes 
to variation in incidence rates for psychotic disorder.

Variations in patterns of cannabis use across the sites 
translated  into  differences  in  the  proportion  of  new 
cases of psychotic disorder attributable to cannabis use. 
We  estimated,  assuming  causality,  that  20%  of  new 
cases  of  psychotic  disorder  across  all  our  sites  could 
have been prevented if daily use of cannabis had been 
abolished;  the  PAF  for  daily  use  was  21%  for  London, 
similar  to  that  previously  reported,3  but  ranged  from 
44%  in  Amsterdam  to  6%  in  Palermo.  The  local

Figure 3: Adjusted incidence rates for all psychosis for the 11 sites plotted 
against the prevalence of daily use in the population controls (A) and 
prevalence of use of high-potency cannabis in the population controls (B)
Incidence rates are adjusted for age, gender, and ethnicity. Puy-de-Dôme is not 
included because data on ethnicity were missing for 27 (66%) of 42 incidence 
cases, therefore the adjusted incidence rate for this site was not calculated.

availability of high­potency types of cannabis resulted in 
a  PAF  of  50%  for  Amsterdam  and  30%  for  London. 
Therefore, assuming causality, if high­potency cannabis 
were no longer accessible, the adjusted incidence rates 
for  all  psychotic  disorder  in  Amsterdam  would  drop 
from 37·9 to 18·8 cases per 100 000 person­years and in 
London  from  45·7  to  31·9  cases  per  100 000  person­
years.

Finally,  we  report  what,  to  our  knowledge,  is  the  first 
evidence  that  differences  in  the  prevalence  of  daily  use 

and use of high­potency cannabis in the controls correlate 
with  the  variation  in  the  adjusted  incidence  rates  for 
psychotic  disorder  across  the  study  sites.  Our  results 
show  that  in  areas  where  daily  use  and  use  of  high­
potency  cannabis  are  more  prevalent  in  the  general 
population,  there  is  an  excess  of  cases  of  psychotic 
disorder.

Our  findings  need  to  be  appraised  in  the  context  of 
limitations.  Data  on  cannabis  use  are  not  validated  by 
biological measures, such as urine, blood, or hair samples. 
However, such measures do not allow testing for use over 
previous  years.26  Moreover,  studies  with  laboratory  data 
and  self­reported  information  have  shown  that  cannabis 
users  reliably  report  frequency  of  use  and  the  type  of 
cannabis used.32,33

Our potency variable does not include the proportion 
of another important cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD),34 
because  reliable  data  on  this  were  available  for  only 
England  and  Holland.17,19,24,25,34  We  categorised 
the 
reported types of cannabis used as low and high potency 
on  the  basis  of  the  available  estimates  of  mean 
percentage of THC from official sources. Although this 
approach  does  not  account  for  variations  in  the  THC 
content  in  individual  samples,  we  used  a  conservative 
cutoff of 10%. Given the much higher mean percentage 
of  THC  expected  in  types  of  cannabis  commonly 
used  in  UK24,29  and  in  Holland,19  our  dichotomous 
categorisation might have led to under estimation of the 
effect  of  potency  on  the  ORs  for  psychotic  disorder. 
Furthermore,  a  direct  measure  of  the  THC  content  of 
the  cannabis  samples  used  by  our  participants  would 
have  only  provided  data  on  THC  value  for  a  single 
timepoint  rather  than  an  estimate  covering  lifetime 
use.

When  setting  quotas  based  on  the  main  sociodemo­
graphics of the populations at risk for the recruitment of 
controls,  we  applied  weights  to  account  for  under­
sampling or oversampling of some groups. For instance, 
most of the sites oversampled the age group 16–24 years 
(appendix), which represents the part of the population 
most likely to consume cannabis17 and the most likely to 
suffer associated harm.6,16,35

Moreover, none of the sites mentioned either cannabis, 
or  other,  drug  use  in  the  materials  used  for  participant 
recruitment,  thus  avoiding  selection  and  recall  bias. 
First­episode  studies  minimise  the  effect  of  recall  bias, 
which can be a source of error when history of exposure 
to  environmental  factors  is  collected  retrospectively  in 
patients  with  well  established  psychosis.  This  study 
design also reduces the chances of results being biased 
by illness course; therefore, it is preferred to investigate 
aetiology.36

In conclusion, our findings confirm previous evidence 
of  the  harmful  effect  on  mental  health  of  daily  use  of 
cannabis,  especially  of  high­potency  types.  Importantly, 
they indicate for the first time how cannabis use affects 
the  incidence  of  psychotic  disorder.  Therefore,  it  is  of
