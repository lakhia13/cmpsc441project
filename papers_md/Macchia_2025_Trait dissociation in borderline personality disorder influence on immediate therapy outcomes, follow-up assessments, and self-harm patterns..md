ABSTRACT
Background:  Dissociative  symptoms  are  suggested  to  compete  with  the  effectiveness  of 
psychotherapeutic  treatment  and  frequently  co-occur  with  early  life  trauma  and  self-harm 
patterns, 
ideation,  and  suicide  attempts,  which  are 
including  self-injury,  suicidal 
characteristic for borderline personality disorder (BPD).
Objective: We explore the connections between dissociation and other BPD features like self- 
harm  and  childhood  traumatization  and  examine  the  impact  of  trait  dissociation  on  both 
immediate and follow-up psychotherapy outcomes.
Method:  In  this  naturalistic  prospective  evaluation  study,  we  investigated  psychopathology 
including  general  psychological  distress  (SCL-90),  depression  (BDI-II),  and  borderline-specific 
pathology  (BSL)  in  131  patients  with  BPD  pre  and  post  of  a  certified  8-week  inpatient 
Dialectical  Behaviour  Therapy  (DBT),  as  well  as  3-  and  6-month  post  inpatient  treatment. 
Prior  to  therapy,  we  evaluated  trait  dissociation  (Dissociative  Experience  Scale),  early  life 
trauma  (Childhood  Trauma  Questionnaire),  and  self-harm  patterns  (clinical  interview).  We 
performed  a  network  analysis  to  explore  the  interplay  between  dissociation,  self-harm,  and 
childhood  traumatization.  To  analyse  the  influence  of  dissociation  on  treatment  outcomes, 
we employed linear mixed models.
Results:  Psychopathology  (SCL-90,  BDI-II  and  BSL)  exhibited  significant  reductions  at  post- 
treatment  and  follow-up  assessments  when  compared  to  baseline  measurements.  Higher 
levels  of  trait  dissociation  were  consistently  related  to  higher  psychopathology  but  did  not 
suggest  poorer  symptom  reduction  during  DBT.  However,  trait  dissociation  predicted 
reduced  6-month  follow-up  benefits  from  DBT,  regardless  of  the  baseline  symptom  burden. 
The  network  analysis  revealed  a  close  association  between  self-injury  and  derealization/ 
depersonalization,  while  the  frequency  of  suicide  attempts  was  more  closely  connected  to 
childhood emotional abuse, which was identified as a central node of the network.
Conclusions:  Dissociation  was  not  related  to  poorer  outcomes  regarding  inpatient  DBT. 
However,  trait  dissociation  predicted  reduced  follow-up  benefits,  highlighting  the  need  to 
address  dissociation  during  psychotherapeutic 
interventions.  Based  on  the  estimated 
network structure, treating dissociative symptoms could potentially mitigate self-injury while 
especially childhood emotional abuse was linked with suicide attempts.

Rasgo de disociación en el trastorno límite de la personalidad: influencia

HIGHLIGHTS
•  Patients with elevated trait 
dissociation  (DES ≥ 20) 
were  younger,  had  more 
frequent  diagnoses  of 
PTSD,  self-injury  (both 
lifetime  and  within  the 
past  year),  and made 
suicide  attempts earlier  in 
life,  but  showed  no 
increase  in  comorbid 
depression  or  alcohol 
abuse  compared  to  those 
with  lower  dissociation 
scores.

•  According to results from a 
network  analysis,  focusing 
on  dissociative  symptoms 
could  potentially  directly 
alleviate  self-injury, 
whereas  suicide  attempts 
and  suicidal  ideation  were 
only  indirectly  associated 
with  dissociation but 
emotional  and  sexual 
abuse.

•  Trait  dissociation  did  not 
indicate  worse  symptom 
reduction  during  an 
inpatient  DBT  treatment, 
but it predicted diminished 
medium-term  benefits 
from  DBT  at  follow-up, 
irrespective  of  initial

Resultados:  La  psicopatología  (SCL-90,  BDI-II  y  BSL)  mostró  reducciones  significativas  en  las 
evaluaciones  post-tratamiento  y  de  seguimiento  en  comparación  con

una  psicopatología  más  alta,  pero  no  sugirieron  una  menor  reducción  de  los  síntomas 
durante  la  DBT.  Sin  embargo,  el  rasgo  de  disociación  predijo  una  reducción  de  los 
beneficios  de  la  DBT  durante  los  6  meses  de  seguimiento,  independientemente  de  la  carga 
sintomática  basal. El análisis  de  la red  reveló  una  estrecha  asociación entre  la autolesión  y la 
desrealización/despersonalización,  mientras  que  la  frecuencia  de  intentos  de  suicidio  estaba 
más  estrechamente  relacionada  con  el  abuso  emocional  en  la  infancia,  que  fue  identificado 
como  un  nodo  central  de  la  red.  Conclusiones:  La  disociación  no  se  relacionó  con  peores 
resultados  en  relación  con  la  DBT  hospitalaria.  Sin  embargo,  el  rasgo  de  disociación  predijo 
menores  beneficios  en  el  seguimiento,  destacando  la  necesidad  de  abordar  la  disociación 
durante las intervenciones  psicoterapéuticas. Sobre la base  de la estructura de red estimada,

1.  Introduction

Dissociation is a sophisticated psychological phenom-
enon that allows the human mind to cope with over-
whelming  experiences  (Boon  et  al.,  2013).  This 
process  involves  the  interruption  or  disturbance  of 
physiological  interconnections  among  mental  func-
tions, encompassing specific aspects of one’s thoughts, 
memory,  identity,  and  consciousness  (Spiegel  et  al., 
2011).  In  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD), 
‘transient,  stress-induced  experiences  of  threat’  or 
‘severe  dissociative  symptoms’  are  considered  core 
symptoms  (Lyssenko  et  al.,  2018)  and  hold  a  highly 
predictive value for the development of BPD (Maldo-
nato et al., 2018).

Approximately  70%  of 

individuals  with  BPD 
experience  moderate  to  severe  dissociative  phenom-
ena  along  with  more  pronounced  BPD  symptoms 
(Jaeger  et  al.,  2017).  The  occurrence  of  dissociation 
as  a  temporary  symptom  (state  dissociation)  is  par-
ticularly prominent in individuals who exhibit a stable, 
high  predisposition  to  dissociate  (trait  dissociation) 
(Krause-Utz et al., 2021). The differentiation between 
trait and state dissociation is essential for achieving a 
nuanced  understanding,  as  these  phenomena  may 
not  necessarily  occur  simultaneously  within  an  indi-
vidual (Salmon et  al., 2023). Dissociation  can further 
be understood as a disruption or separation from cer-
tain mental processes, involving both detachment and 
compartmentalization  (Holmes  et  al.,  2005).  Detach-
ment  refers  to  alterations  in  consciousness,  where 
individuals  experience  derealization  –  a  sense  of 
detachment  from  reality  –  and  depersonalization  –  a 
feeling of emotional or bodily detachment from one-
self. Compartmentalization, on the other hand, refers 
to  a  loss  of  voluntary  control  over  mental  processes 
that  are  normally controllable,  such as  in amnesia  or 
conversion  symptoms.  In  these  cases,  functions  like 
memory,  emotions,  or  cognition  become  split  off 
from conscious awareness without a noticeable change 

in  the  overall  state  of  consciousness.  In  individuals 
with BPD, dissociative symptoms such as detachment 
from  reality  (derealization)  and  self-detachment 
(depersonalization)  are  particularly  relevant  (Sar 
et  al.,  2017).  The  tendency  towards  dissociation  is 
multifaceted;  however,  existing  literature  suggests 
that early life experiences, such as childhood trauma, 
significantly influence the development of dissociative 
symptoms  in  later  years  (Aksen  et  al.,  2021;  Schim-
menti  &  Caretti,  2016).  Childhood  traumatization, 
which has been shown to be linked to enduring dysre-
gulation  of  the  humans’  stress  system  (De  Bellis  & 
Zisk,  2014)  is  a  prevalent  factor  in  BPD.  It  is  closely 
associated with the severity of BPD symptoms (Regier 
et al., 2013; Zanarini et al., 2006) and BPD frequently 
co-occurs with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Pagura 
et  al.,  2010).  Notably,  patients  with  a  dual  diagnosis 
often  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  BPD  even 
after  their  PTSD  has  gone  into  remission,  and  they 
are  also  at  a  higher  risk  of  developing  PTSD  again 
later in life (Ford & Courtois, 2021). A predisposition 
to dissociation  may be  a  key factor  linking  these two 
disorders. However, the precise mechanisms connect-
ing dissociative detachment symptoms and other BPD 
symptoms to traumatization remain unclear.

Besides  a  PTSD  diagnosis,  self-harm  including  self- 
injury,  suicide  attempts,  and  suicidal  ideation  show  an 
association  with  dissociation  across  various  psychiatric 
disorders, which is particularly prominent in individuals 
with BPD (Calati et al., 2017; Perez et al., 2020; Sommer 
et al., 2021). Dissociation might adopt a mediating role 
between  trauma  and  non-suicidal  self-injury  (NSSI; 
Rossi  et  al.,  2019)  as  traumatization  co-occurs  with 
difficulties in regulating emotions, leading to heightened 
and  prolonged  states  of  inner  tension  in  BPD,  which 
could drive self-harming behaviours. Childhood trauma 
has  been  associated  with  intense  emotional  pain  and 
low self-compassion (Dye, 2018; Pohl et al., 2021). This 
implies  that  dissociation  could  play  an  important  role 

in  regulating  and/or  experiencing  emotions,  and  self- 
harm  might  be  an  attempt  to  deal  with  dissociative 
experiences (Reitz et al., 2015). Integrating these findings 
into  a  cohesive  theoretical  framework,  we  assume  that 
individuals may develop dissociation as a coping mech-
anism,  particularly  for  situations  experienced  as  trau-
matic, which allow them to detach from overwhelming 
and unbearable inner psychological states. This detach-
ment can further complicate self-regulation process, lead-
ing  some  individuals  to  engage  in  self-harm  or  other 
dysfunctional behaviour as a way to cope with these dis-
tressing feelings and reclaim a sense of control over their 
bodies and emotions. Moreover, self-harm could serve as 
a temporary relief from emotional numbness and feelings 
of detachment which are particularly prominent in BPS 
(Krause-Utz et al., 2021), providing a brief reconnection 
to their physical self and emotions. Understanding how 
these factors interconnect could help in developing effec-
tive therapeutic interventions. However, the relationship 
between  BPD  features,  childhood  trauma,  and  dis-
sociation  is  only  sparsely  understood.  Moreover,  there 
is  a  lack  of  research  on  how  self-injury  and  other  self- 
harm  patterns  such  as  suicidal  ideation  and  suicide 
attempts relate to dissociation (Rossi et al., 2019).

Psychotherapeutic interventions are the gold stan-
dard for the treatment of patients with BPD (Storebø 
et al., 2020) focusing on the reduction of dysfunctional 
behaviours  such  as  self-harm,  with  Dialectic  Behav-
ioural Therapy (DBT) emerging as a particularly suc-
cessful  therapeutic  approach  in  this  regard  (DeCou 
et al., 2019). Understanding and focusing on traumatic 
invalidation as a form of emotional abuse is considered 
a crucial element of DBT (Linehan, 1993). Investigating 
the  impact  of  dissociation  on  therapy  outcomes  in 
BPD, Kleindienst et al. (2011) found that high trait dis-
sociation was related to poorer follow-up improvement 
1 month after discharge from a 3-month inpatient DBT 
programme. Another study with a small sample (N =  
24)  investigated  the  influence  of  state  and  trait  dis-
sociation on the therapeutic outcome directly after dis-
charge  of  a  3-month  outpatient  DBT  programme 
designed  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  posttrau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD). Whereas the therapeutic 
outcome (PTSD symptoms) was negatively influenced 
by  state  dissociation,  no  association  emerged  between 
trait dissociation and the effectiveness of psychotherapy 
(Kleindienst et al., 2016). A meta-analysis examining 21 
primary treatment studies in PTSD found no evidence 
that trait dissociation is associated with reduced effec-
tiveness  of  psychotherapeutic  interventions  (Hoeboer 
et  al.,  2020).  This  implies  that  the  definition  of  dis-
sociation  as well  as the assessment time  point need  to 
be  considered  when  investigating  the  effect  of  dis-
sociation  on  psychotherapy.  Moreover,  a  randomized 
controlled trial showed a large and significant drop in 
both  the  intensity  and  duration  of  dissociative  symp-
toms during DBT (Kleindienst et al., 2021).

1.1.  Study  aim  and  hypotheses

This  study  aims  to  shed  light  on  dissociative  symp-
toms  in  patients  with  BPD  that  participated  in  a 
certified  inpatient  DBT  programme.  Our  first  aim  is 
to  explore,  how  dissociative  symptoms  in  patients 
with  BPD  interact  with  other  BPD  symptoms  using 
both self-reports and a clinical interview at a cross-sec-
tional level. This analysis also examines the association 
of  these  symptoms  with  demographic  and  health 
characteristics,  as  well  as  broader  psychopathology. 
Furthermore,  the  study  delves  into  the  relationships 
between  self-harm  patterns,  traumatic  childhood 
experiences,  and  dissociative  symptoms  through  net-
work analysis, providing a more detailed understand-
ing of how these factors might be interconnected. Our 
second aim is to investigate the influence of trait dis-
sociation  on  the  pre-to-post-treatment  improvement 
and  on  3-  and  6-month  follow-up  outcomes  of  the 
inpatient DBT programme.

2. Methods

Data  were  collected  as  part  of  a  naturalistic  study  con-
ducted at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychother-
apy III of Ulm University Clinic to evaluate the inpatient 
DBT  programme.  The  OSF  preregistration  document 
provides  further  details  about  the  study  (https://osf.io/ 
dfq9y/?view_only=4c19b891bb6448009b22f60b2552bd7 
3).  Eight  to  twelve  patients  (age > 18)  pass  through  the 
programme  in  8–10  weeks  with  DBT  group  therapy 
(270 min per week: mindfulness, emotion regulation, dis-
tress tolerance, interpersonal skills, education regarding 
BPD)  and  individual  therapy  (two  sessions:  30  and 
50 min/week).

2.1.  Sample

All patients diagnosed with BPD who took part in the 
Inpatient DBT programme between January 2021 and 
June 2023 were eligible for the study, only one partici-
pant declined to participate. Figure 1 illustrates the par-
ticipant  flow  through  the  response  rates  for  the 
assessments  upon  admission  (T0),  discharge  (T1), 
and 3 (T2), and 6 months (T3) after the end of therapy. 
A total of 131 patients provided written informed con-
sent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and 
the study has been carried out in accordance with ethi-
cal guidelines. Diagnoses of BPD were confirmed by a 
trained  psychiatrist  using  the  semi-structured  ‘Inter-
national  Personality  Disorder  Examination’  for  ICD- 
10 (IPDE, Loranger et al., 1997). All participants ana-
lysed at discharge and follow-up completed at least 2 
weeks  of  the  inpatient  DBT  programme,  including 
the behavioural analysis at the beginning of the DBT 
programme to analyse problematic behaviours. Mean 
duration of treatment was 51.4 days (SD = 18.69) with

a dropout rate of 21.4% (N = 28) after a mean treatment 
duration  of  24.7  days  (SD = 18.13)  in  the  DBT  pro-
gramme  (T1).  Most  of  the  study  participants  were 
female  (N = 114,  87%),  followed  by  male  (N = 14, 
10.7%) and transgender participants (female-to-male; 
N = 3,  2.3%).  The  mean  age  at  study  entry  was  26.2 
years (SD = 8.82 years, range: 18–61). 86.3% (N = 113) 
of the sample had at least one further psychiatric diag-
nosis, with  Depression and  Posttraumatic Stress  Dis-
order  representing  the  most  common  comorbid 
diagnoses according to ICD-10. Patients were addition-
ally treated with medication, mainly antidepressants to 
address affective symptoms and sleep disorders. After 
the  exclusion  of  patients  with  incomplete  question-
naires  or  too  many  missing  data,  106  patients  could 
be  included  into  the  analyses  of  effects  of  trait  dis-
sociation on symptom reduction.

2.2.  Instruments

Three  self-report  instruments  were  administered  at 
baseline (T0), the end of treatment (T1), 3- and (T2) 
6-month  (T3)  follow-up  to  investigate  psychopathol-
ogy  and  its  changes:  General  psychological  distress 
was  evaluated  using  the  Global  Severity  Index  of  the 
German  90-item  version  of  the  Symptom  Checklist- 
(SCL-90-R;  Franke,  2000).  Current 
90-Revised 
depressive symptoms were measured with the German 

version  of  Beck’s  Depression  Inventory,  second  edi-
tion (BDI-II, Hautzinger  et al., 2006).  To assess BPD 
symptoms in the past week, we included the short ver-
sion of the German Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23; 
Bohus et al., 2009), which comprises 23 items.

Furthermore  at  baseline,  participants  completed 
the German adaption of the Dissociative Experiences 
Scale, second version with 28 items (DES-II; Freyber-
ger et al., 1998), the German short form of the child-
hood  trauma  questionnaire  with  28  items  (CTQ; 
Bernstein et al., 2003; Wingenfeld et al., 2010), and a 
subset of questions from the Indicators of Rehabilita-
tion Status (IRES-3; Bührlen et al., 2005) questionnaire 
to  assess indicators  of  quality  of  life.  The DES-II  is a 
well-established,  self-report  inventory  to  measure 
trait dissociation by asking about the degree of agree-
ment  from  0%  to  100%  regarding  28  statements.  It 
provides  a  total  score  and  three  subscales:  amnestic 
dissociation  (1),  absorption/imaginative  involvement 
(2), and depersonalization/derealization (3). Utilizing 
a  cut-off-score  of  20  (Steinberg  et  al.,  1991),  we 
aimed  to  distinguish  individuals  with  mild/severe 
(≥20)  levels  of  dissociation  from  individuals  with 
low (<20) dissociation. The CTQ enables participants 
to  rate  the  incidence  and  severity  of  traumatic  child-
hood  and  adolescence  experiences  (<18  years)  on 
five  dimensions  including  emotional  abuse,  physical 
abuse,  sexual  abuse,  emotional  neglect,  and  physical 

neglect.  Including  three  questions  screening  for  the 
likelihood  of  underreporting  traumatic  experiences, 
28  questions  are  asked  using  a  5-point  Likert  scale 
(‘never  true’  [1]  to  ‘very  often  true’  [5]).  The  IRES-3 
was  developed  and  validated  in  Germany  to  collect 
information  about  health-related  quality  of  life  with 
144  items  (Bührlen  et  al.,  2005).  In  this  study,  14 
selected  items  were  assessed  to  investigate  subjective 
health,  social  support  and  professional  activity  of 
which three are presented in Table 1.

Psychologists  holding a  master’s  degree  or  trained 
students of medicine in a higher semester (>6th seme-
ster) conducted a clinical interview with study partici-
pants  at  T0.  Six  relevant  topics  were  covered: 
employment,  medical  and  therapeutic  pretreatment, 
dissociation  (existence  of  dissociative  symptoms,  fre-
quency  of  dissociative  symptoms,  daily  constraints 
due  to  dissociative  experiences;  explanation  of  dis-
sociation:  see  supplements),  substance  abuse,  other 
dysfunctional  behaviour  (i.e.  risky  behaviour),  and 
self-harm  (number  of  self-injuries  during  the  last 
year, lifetime self-injuries,  frequency of  suicidal idea-
tion  during  the  past  6  months,  lifetime  suicide 
attempts, age of first suicide attempt).

2.3.  Statistical  analyses

Data  processing  and  statistical  analyses  were  per-
formed  using  Rstudio  Version  4.3.1  (R  Core  Team, 
2023).  Missing  values  were  treated  according  to  the 
guidelines  of  the  respective  test  psychological  man-
uals.  We  did  not  replace  missing  data  of  individuals 
at  follow-up  assessments.  If  patients  indicated  a 
range  of  values  in  the  clinical  interview,  we  used  the 
mean  value.  The  threshold  of  statistical  significance 
was set to p < .05.

2.3.1.  Trait  dissociation  and  sociodemographic 
variables/psychopathology
Differences  between  patients  with  mild/severe  trait 
dissociation  (DES ≥ 20)  and  low  trait  dissociation 
(DES < 20)  were  analysed  with  independent  two- 
sided  t-tests  for  continuous  variables  and  chi-square 
tests  for  categorical  variables.  We  applied  robust  t- 
tests  with  20%  trimmed  means  using  the  R-package 
‘WRS2’  (Mair  et  al.,  2022)  for  data  violating  testing 
assumptions  and  report  robust  test  results  if  we 
found differences in statistical significance.

2.3.2.  Exploratory  network  analysis
A  Gaussian  Graphical  Model  (Lauritzen,  1996)  was 
used  to  conduct  a  cross-sectional  network  analysis 
including  (1)  the  three  DES  subscales  (amnestic  dis-

four  measures  of  self-harm  (lifetime  self-injury,  self- 
injuries  during  the  last  year,  suicidal  ideation  during 
the  last  6  months,  lifetime  suicide  attempts).  Since 
the self-harm variables did not follow a normal distri-
bution, we used Spearman correlations for the analy-
sis.  Missing  values  were  replaced  with  multiple 
imputations  using  the  R  package  ‘mice’  (van  Buuren 
&  Groothuis-Oudshoorn,  2011).  Accuracy  and  stab-
ility  estimations  were  carried  out  as  follows:  95% 
confidence  intervals  (CIs)  of  the  edge  weights  were 
obtained  through  bootstrapping  (1000  iterations), 
and  the  correlation  stability  coefficient  (CS)  for  cen-
trality  indices  was  estimated  with  values  exceeding 
0.5  implying  adequate  stability  (Epskamp  &  Fried, 
2018).  Detailed  information  about  network  stability 
is described elsewhere (Epskamp & Fried, 2018).

2.3.3.  Effect  of  dissociation  on  immediate  and 
follow-up  therapy  outcomes
To investigate a selection bias, we compared follow-up 
responders (T2, T3) to non-responders and compared 
their psychopathology (SCL-90, BDI-II, BSL) and the 
DES  sum  score  at  baseline  using  independent  two- 
sided  t-tests.  Linear  mixed-effect  models  were  used 
to  estimate  the  mean  change  of  psychopathology 
(GSI  SCL-90,  BDI-II  sum  score,  BSL  mean  sum 
score) depending on the assessment time point, com-
paring baseline (T0) to each follow-up (T1, T2, T3) in 
a  first  step  to  analyse  whether  the  DBT  programme 
was  effective  on  its  own  (Model  1).  In  the  second 
step  (Model  2),  we  included  dissociation  (DES  sum 
score;  continuous  variable)  and  the  dissociation  by 
time interaction  (T1, T2,  T3)  as  fixed effects  into the 
models.  We  computed  a  third  model  (Model  3)  that 
incorporated  the  relevant  psychopathological  factors 
at baseline, given the significance of baseline symptom 
severity as a predictor of treatment outcome (Barnicot 
et al., 2012). The models were analysed via the ‘lme4’ 
R-package  (Bates  et  al.,  2018)  and  included  random 
intercepts for participants. We applied 1000 resamples 
of  bootstrapping  with  bias-corrected  and  accelerated 
confidence  intervals  (BCa  CIs)  for  unstandardized 
beta  values  to  provide  robust  statistics  (Mason  et  al., 
2021).

3.1.  Trait  dissociation  and  sociodemographic 
variables

81% (N = 104) of the participants indicated during the 
interview (T0) that they had experienced a dissociative 
episode before. 52% (N = 65) of participants reported 
daily  constraints  due  to  dissociative  states.  Patients 
experienced  on  average  3.39  (SD = 3.47)  dissociative 
episodes  per  week.  The  mean  DES  score  at  baseline 
was  26.63  (SD = 19.32).  Around  55%  (N = 58)  of  the

sample  had  a  DES  score  above  20  (M = 40.38,  SD =

3.2.  Exploratory  network  analysis

Figure 2 shows the estimated network of dissociation 
(DES-II  subscales),  childhood  traumatization  (CTQ 
subscales),  and  self-harm  (clinical  interview)  (see 
Table S1 for descriptives). Out of the possible 66 pair-
wise associations, 23 (35%) resulted in non-zero edges, 
that  were  all  positively  related  to  each  other.  The 
strongest edges emerged within the subscales ‘absorp-
tion/imaginative  involvement’  (DES2)  and  ‘deperso-
nalization/derealization’  (DES3)  for  the  category 
dissociation,  between the  assessments  for ‘number  of 
self-injuries  during  the  last  year’  (SH1)  and  ‘lifetime 
self-injuries’  (SH2)  for  the  category  self-harm,  and 
between  the  subscales  ‘physical  abuse’  (CTQ3)  and 
‘physical  neglect’  (CTQ5)  for  the  category  childhood 
traumatization.

The  association  between  the  symptom  categories 
dissociation  and  childhood  traumatization  was  low 
and  primarily  emerged  for  the  subscales  ‘absorption/ 
‘emotional 
imaginative  involvement’  (DES2)  and 
abuse’  (CTQ1).  The  ‘frequency  of  suicidal  ideations’ 
(SH3)  was  merely  linked  to  ‘sexual  abuse’  (CTQ3) 
and  ‘self-injury  during  the  past  year’  (SH1)  and  thus 
only  loosely  integrated  in  the  network.  The  ‘number 
of  suicide  attempts’  (SH4)  showed  a  connection  to 
‘emotional  abuse’  (CTQ1)  and  was  only  indirectly 
linked  to  dissociation  via  ‘lifetime  self-injury’  (SH2). 
‘Lifetime  self-injury’  (SH2)  and  ‘self-injury  during 
the  past  year’  (SH1)  show  a  direct  connection  to 
‘derealization/depersonalization’  (DES3).  The  vari-
ables  ‘absorption/imaginative  involvement’  (DES2), 
‘depersonalization/derealization’  (DES3),  ‘emotional 
abuse’  (CTQ1),  and  ‘physical  neglect’  (CTQ5)  were 
the most central variables in terms of strength indicat-
ing  that  these  symptoms  have  strong  direct  connec-
tions  to  neighbouring  symptoms.  CTQ1,  CTQ3  and 
CTQ5 were most central in terms of closeness indicat-
ing  that  these  variables  are  quickly  affected  by  other 
variables and vice versa, regardless of a direct connec-
tion. Moreover, DES2, SH2 and CTQ1 were most cen-
tral  in  terms  of  betweenness  pointing  towards  a 
meaningful  function  in  connecting  variables  of  the 
network  and  increasing  the  distance  between  many 
variables  if  dropped  out.  The  strength  metric  and

childhood traumatization, and self-harm (nodes) using Spearman correlations. Solid lines (edges) show positive associations (par-
tial  correlations)  between  these  nodes.  As  spurious  connections  might arise  and  cause  problems  in  terms of  the  network  inter-
pretability the ‘least absolute shrinkage and selection operator’ (LASSO; Friedman et al., 2008) was implemented to shrink small 
edges to zero. The tuning parameter (λ) was set by applying the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC). The thickness and 
saturation  of  edges  are  an  indicator  for  the  strength  of  the  associations  between  symptoms  quantified  with  strength  centrality 
metric  using  the  most  common  aspects  of  centrality:  Strength  (i.e.  how  strongly  a  node  is  directly  connected  to  other  nodes), 
Closeness  (i.e.  the  average  distance  of  a  node  to  all  other  nodes  in  the  network),  and  Betweenness  (i.e.  number  of  times  a 
node lies on the shortest path between any two other nodes) (Hevey, 2018). The grey area in the rings around the nodes depicts 
predictability;  the  variance  of  a  given  node  is  explained  by all  its  neighbours  (Haslbeck  & Fried,  2017).

their  stability  is  reported  in  the  Supplements  (Figure 
S1). The average predictability of nodes was 0.44, indi-
cating  that  on  average  44%  of  the  variation  in  one 
node  is  explained  by  its  direct  neighbouring  nodes. 
The  highest  predictability  within  our  categories  was 
found for DES2 (80%), CTQ5 (57%), and SH2 (34%).
The correlation stability coefficient (CS; i.e. number 
of cases that can be dropped from the sample to retain, 
with 95% probability, a correlation of at least 0.7) for 
the  strength  centrality  metric  exceeded  the  rec-
ommended  cut-off  of  0.5  (CS = 0.60)  suggesting  a 
reliable  estimation.  The  confidence  intervals  around 
the edge weights were large and most of the confidence 
intervals  overlapped, 
indicating  that  their  order 
should be interpreted with caution (Figure S2). Boot-
strapped  difference  tests  between  edges  indicated  no 
significant  differences  between  edges  of  self-harm 
traumatization  or  dis-
variables  and  childhood 
sociation  compared  to  other  node  edges  of  the  net-
work  (Figure  S3).  Bootstrapped  difference  tests  for 
strength  showed  that  the  most  central  variables 
(DES2, DES3) revealed a significantly higher strength 
than SH1, SH3, and the SH4 but not SH2. CTQ1 and 
CTQ5,  which  were  also  high  in  their  strength  had 

significantly  greater  strength  than  SH1,  SH3,  but  not 
SH1, SH2 (Figure S4).

3.3.  Effect  of  dissociation  on  immediate  and 
follow-up  therapy  outcomes

We found no significant differences in psychopathol-
ogy  between  responders  to  follow-up  (T2,  T3)  and 
non-responders  (SCL-90,  BDI-II  and  BSL:  p > .005), 
but  trait  dissociation  at  baseline  was  significantly 
lower  in  follow-up  responders  (n = 32;  M = 20.03, 
SD = 12.87)  than  in  non-responders  (n = 73;  M =  
29.69, SD = 21.03; t = 2.88; p = .005).  We found a sig-
nificant  reduction  in  the  SCL-90,  BDI,  and  BSL-23 
scores  at  all  measurement  time  points  (T1,  T2,  T3) 
compared  to  baseline,  except  for  the  BSL-23  three 
months  after  the  DBT  programme  (Model  1),  which 
generally  supports  the  effectiveness  of  our  DBT  pro-
gramme (Tables S2–S4).

Figure 3. The upper figures illustrate predictions of Model 2 which examine the influence of dissociation on treatment outcomes 
(psychopathology  ∼ trait  dissociation  *assessment  time)  and  the  lower  figures  represent  Model  3,  accounting  for  the  baseline 
symptom  burden  (depression  ∼ trait  dissociation  *assessment  time  +  baseline  symptom  severity*assessment  time)  for  general 
psychological  distress  (SCL-90;  A),  depression  (BDI-II;  B),  and  borderline-specific  symptoms  (BSL;  C).  Upper  Figures  (Model  2) 
show that dissociation maintains a robust significant correlation with all the psychopathology variables throughout all assessment 
time points. The association between trait dissociation and various levels of psychopathology appears most pronounced during 
the 6-month follow-up (T3), while it becomes less conspicuous upon discharge after DBT (T1). The lower figures (Model 3) reveal 
that psychopathology at the 6-month follow-up (T3) tends to be higher in patients with elevated trait dissociation levels at base-
line, while it does not exert an impact on the level of depression at discharge (T1) and subsequent follow-up assessments (T2, T3).

assessments.  Including  the  DES  score  and  the  DES 
score  by  assessment  time  interaction  (Model  2) 
showed  that  there  was  a  large  effect  of  higher  DES 
scores on higher SCL-90-R GSI scores (β = 0.54, 95% 
CI  [0.39,  0.69],  b = 0.02,  BCa  CI  95%  [0.02,  0.03],  p  

< .001),  independent  of  the  assessment  time  point. 
Follow-up SCL-90-R GSI scores (T1, T2, T3) did not 
significantly differ from the baseline score controlling 
for the DES score. We found a significant interaction 
between  the  DES  score  and  the  end  of  treatment,  T1 

(β = −0.27, 95% CI [−0.47, −0.06], b = −0.01, BCa CI 
95%  [−0.02,  0.00],  p = .008),  indicating  that  the  DES 
score  had  a  lower  influence  on  the  SCL-90-R  GSI 
score  at  T1  as  compared  to  the  baseline  measure, 
although  it  was  not  substantiated  by  the  BCa  CI. 
There  was  no  significant  interaction  between  the 
DES  score  and  the  assessment  time  points  T2,  T3 
(Table S5). The inclusion of baseline symptom burden 
(Model 3, Table S8) showed that higher baseline psy-
chopathology is associated with greater reductions in 
SCL-90 scores over time at T1, T2, and T3. Moreover, 
Model  3  revealed  a  significant  interaction  of  dis-
sociation  and  the  follow-up  after  6  months:  Those 
patients  with  high  trait  dissociation  at  the  beginning 
of  therapy  had  higher  SCL  scores  at  T3  indicated  by 
a  large  effect  (β = 0.56,  95%  CI  [0.18,  0.94],  b = 0.02, 
BCa CI 95% [0.01, 0.04], p = .006).

3.3.2.  Depression,  BDI-II
Including  the  DES  score  and  its  interaction  with  the 
assessment  time  point  (Model  2)  showed  that  higher 
DES scores were associated with higher BDI-II scores 
supported by a medium effect (β = 0.34, 95% CI [0.19, 
0.49],  b = 0.25,  BCa  CI  95%  [0.12,  0.36],  p < .001), 
independent of the assessment time point. Follow-up 
BDI-II  scores  (T1,  T2,  T3)  did  significantly  differ 
from the baseline measure even when controlling for 
the  DES  score,  but  none  of  the  interactions  of  the 
DES score with the assessment time point was signifi-
cant  (Table  S6).  Including  baseline  symptom  burden 
showed that higher psychopathology at the beginning 
of therapy was associated with lower BDI scores at T1 
and T3. Dissociation did not significantly interact with 
any of the assessment time points, indicating that high 
trait dissociation before therapy (T0) did not influence 
depressive  symptoms  at  discharge  and  follow-up 
(Table S9).

3.3.3.  Borderline-specific  symptoms,  BSL-23
The  model  including  trait  dissociation  (Model  2), 
shows that higher DES scores strongly predict higher 
BSL-23 scores (β = 0.51, 95% CI [0.35, 0.66], b = 0.03, 
BCa CI 95% [0.02, 0.03], p < .001). Borderline-specific 
symptoms  at  T1,  T2  and  T3  did  not  differ  from  T0 
when  controlling  for  trait  dissociation.  None  of  the 
assessment  time  points  (T1,  T2,  T3)  exhibited  a  sig-
nificant  interaction  with  the  DES  score;  however, 
our  data  suggested  a  slight  decrease  in  the  influence 
of  dissociation  on  borderline  symptoms  throughout 
therapy (DES × Assessment time T1; Table S7). Base-
line  symptom  burden  (Model  3)  significantly  inter-
acted  with  the  improvement  at  T1,  and  T3,  showing 
that  those  patients  with  higher  psychopathology 
before 
therapy  experienced  a  greater  symptom 
reduction.  DES  scores  significantly  interacted  with 
the improvement at T3, indicating that high trait dis-
sociation  predicts  higher  psychopathology  6  months

4. Discussion

The  present  study  aimed  to  shed  light  on  the  role  of 
trait dissociation in BPD. We examined demographic 
and  core  health  characteristics  of  patients  scoring 
mild/severe vs. low in trait dissociation  and explored 
relations  between  self-harm,  childhood  trauma,  and 
trait  dissociation.  Additionally,  we  investigated  how 
trait  dissociation  influences  psychotherapeutic  treat-
ment effects at discharge, and 3-and 6-month follow- 
up  measures  of  an  inpatient  DBT  programme.  We 
found  that  high  trait  dissociation  is  associated  with 
various  adverse  health  outcomes  and  that  there  exist 
tight associations of self-injury with trait dissociation, 
while  suicidality  seems  to  be  more  closely  linked  to 
childhood  traumatization.  We  found  no  evidence 
that  trait  dissociation  negatively  affects  DBT  treat-
ment;  however,  trait  dissociation  might  predict 
reduced  medium-term  benefits  of  DBT  in  terms  of 
greater  general  psychological  distress  and  more  bor-
derline-specific  symptoms,  regardless  of  the  baseline 
symptom burden.

Our findings are consistent with studies suggesting 
that depending on the definition of dissociation, one- 
third  to  one-quarter  of  BPD  patients  experience  sig-
nificant dissociative phenomena (Spitzer et al., 2021). 
The  variability  of  prevalence  rates  likely  results  from 
the  various  definitions  of  dissociation,  as  flashbacks, 
amnesia,  emotional  numbness,  and  analgesia  can  be 
defined  as  dissociative  phenomena  in  BPD  (Krause- 
Utz et al., 2017), while other definitions focus on feel-
ings of alienation, such as derealization or depersona-
lization,  which  might  be  particularly  relevant  in  the 
context of BPD (Sar et al., 2017). Patients with elevated 
trait dissociation (DES ≥ 20) were younger, more fre-
quently  unemployed  or  on  sick  leave  during  the  half 
year  before  therapy  and  reported  more  risky  behav-
iour  and  drug  intake.  In  patients  with  elevated  trait 
dissociation,  the  diagnosis  of  a  PTBS,  lifetime  self- 
injury  and  self-injuries  during  the  past  year  were 
more  frequent  compared  to  the  participants  with 
lower  scores,  whereas  we  did  not  find  more  frequent 
comorbid  depression  or  alcohol  abuse.  Age  at  first 
suicide  attempt  was  markedly  lower  in  the  DES ≥ 20 
group  than  in  the  DES < 20  group.  This  is  in  line 
with  previous  research  showing  that  dissociation 
relates  to  adverse  health  outcomes  and  increased 
symptom  burden  (Jaeger  et  al.,  2017;  Sommer  et  al., 
2021;  Spitzer  et  al.,  2021).  Notably,  findings  are  in 
line with Schäfer et al. (2010) showing that compared 
to mere alcohol abuse, especially drug intake relates to

dissociation. In addition, the authors pointed towards 
the 
link  between  younger  age  and  dissociation, 
suggesting  that  drug  abuse  might  be  prevalent  in 
younger  individuals  affected  by  childhood  trauma, 
particularly  emotional  abuse.  Unemployment  and 
sickness before therapy might relate to other findings 
showing that  patients suffering from dissociative dis-
order  struggle  with  concentrating  and  engaging  in 
goal-directed  behaviours  (Nester  et  al.,  2022).  More-
over,  dissociation  may  contribute  to  emotion  regu-
lation  difficulties,  or  the  reverse,  potentially  leading 
to  self-harm  and  other  risky  behaviours,  both  of 
which  can  sustain  psychopathology  (Nester  et  al., 
2022).  Interestingly,  we  did  not  find  a  difference  in 
life  satisfaction  between  individuals  with  mild/severe 
trait dissociation and those with low trait dissociation. 
An association between reduced quality of life and dis-
sociative  symptoms  was,  however,  suggested  pre-
viously  (Prasko  et  al.,  2016)  when  employing  more 
objective  assessment  methods  related  to  life  quality. 
Mere  subjective  assessments  as  used  in  our  study 
might  be  biased  by  dissociative  experiences  them-
selves,  that  might  impair  interoceptive  processes 
(Cavicchioli et al., 2021).

Previous  studies  making  use  of  the  network 
approach  found  associations  between  sexual  abuse 
and  self-injury  in  a  nonclinical  sample  (Misiak  et  al., 
2023) as well as a connection between self-injury and 
dissociation  in  a  sample  of  mental  health  services 
users  (Fung  et  al.,  2023).  In  our  study,  particularly 
emotional  and  sexual  abuse  such  as  physical  neglect 
emerged as central nodes, highlighting their significant 
roles in the aetiology of BPD. Accordingly, a previous 
network  analysis  revealed  emotional  abuse  as  the 
most central node connecting other types of childhood 
trauma  to  BPD  characteristics  (Schulze  et  al.,  2022). 
This  discovery  aligns  with  early  theories  of  BPD, 
emphasizing  the  role  of  sexual  abuse  in  its  develop-
ment, as well as Linehan’s well-known assertion regard-
ing ‘invalidating environments’ as a key component in 
the aetiology of BPD (Winsper, 2018). Addressing trau-
matic invalidation as a very common form of emotional 
abuse is crucial in DBT, which therefore focuses on vali-
dating individual’s emotions and experiences (Linehan, 
1993). The central role of emotional abuse in the net-
work might explain part of the strategies success.

Identity  disturbance  which  might  arise  when  dis-
sociation  significantly  impairs  an  individual’s  ability 
to  harmonize  mental  functions  (Boon  et  al.,  2013) 
hereby  linking  emotional  abuse  to  affective  instability 
as  a  core  BPD  symptom  (Schulze  et  al.,  2022).  A 
meta-analysis  investigating  individuals  who  experi-
enced childhood trauma found the highest dissociation 
scores  in  those  who  experienced  sexual  and  physical 
abuse and assumed that the violation of bodily integrity 
is extremely threatening to survival from an evolution-
ary  perspective  (Vonderlin  et  al.,  2018).  Moreover, 

connectivity  which 

sexual  and  physical  aspects  of  traumatization  could 
impair  body–mind 
affects 
emotional regulation  (Schmitz et  al.,  2021). However, 
childhood  traumatization  in  our  study  exhibited  a 
weak  connection  to  dissociation  with  only  emotional 
abuse being linked to absorption/imaginative involve-
ment.  This  might  support  theories  of  a  multifaceted 
genesis  of  the  propensity  for  dissociation  involving 
emotion  dysregulation,  sleep,  alexithymia,  negative 
affect, impulsivity, and neuroticism (Aksen et al., 2021).
Our  finding  that  dissociation,  especially  derealiza-
tion/depersonalization,  is  associated  with  lifetime 
self-injury  and  self-harm  during  the  past  year  repli-
cates a previous study with college students (Brickman 
et al., 2014), showing that dissociation is significantly 
related  to  the  frequency  of  self-injury.  Additionally, 
the  indirect  link  between  self-injury  and  emotional 
abuse  through  dissociation  aligns  with  results  by 
Perez et al. (2020), indicating that dissociation moder-
ates the correlation between fathers’ invalidating beha-
viours  and  self-injury.  The  finding  may  support 
theories that one purpose of self-injury may be to alle-
viate  dissociative  experience  and  distress  stemming 
from  traumatic  childhood  experiences,  suggesting 
that  childhood  traumatization  may  underlie  certain 
self-injury behaviours (Briere & Gil, 1998). However, 
the  still  relatively  modest  correlation  between  dis-
sociation and  self-injury underscores  the  necessity  to 
identify  additional  variables  that  contribute  to  self- 
harm,  as  done  in  Brickman  et  al.’s  study  (2014) 
where  impulsivity,  chronic  emptiness,  and  identity 
disturbance were revealed as predictors for self-injury. 
In  our  network  analysis,  lifetime  self-injury  was  the 
best  predictor  for  self-injury  during  the  last  year 
which is  in  line with  Fox  et  al.  (2015).  Moreover,  we 
could  confirm  a  connection  of  suicide  attempts  and 
self-injury.  Interestingly,  suicidal  behaviours  were 
not  directly  associated  with  dissociation  in  the  net-
work  analysis,  but  emotional  and  sexual  abuse.  Pre-
viously  described  associations  between  dissociation 
and  suicide  attempts  (Calati  et  al.,  2017;  Sommer 
et al., 2021) may thus be mediated by third-party vari-
ables like emotional abuse, lifetime self-injury or other 
symptoms, with depression potentially playing a cru-
cial role (Bertule et al., 2021).

While  we  found  a  link  between  suicide  attempts 
and  self-injury,  suicidal  ideation  showed  only  low 
associations  to  other  variables  of  the  network,  but 
was directly linked to sexual abuse. The mere cognitive 
nature  of  suicidal  ideation  as  a  strategy  to  regain  a 
sense  of  control  (Bertule  et  al.,  2021)  over  various 
symptoms,  might  set  it  aside  from  actual  self-harm 
actions regarding regulating dissociation.

The  robust  and  strong  connection  between  dis-
sociation  and  heightened  psychopathology  including 
general  psychological  distress,  depression,  as  well  as 
borderline-specific  symptoms  is  concordant  with  the 

transdiagnostic perspective of dissociation (Ellickson- 
Larew  et  al.,  2020).  The  strong  correlation  between 
dissociation and mental health issues may stem from 
its influence on fundamental psychological processes, 
such as cognition, emotions, and interoception. More-
over, dissociation co-occurs with avoidance behaviour 
which has been suggested as a basic mechanism perpe-
tuating  psychopathology  (Cavicchioli  et  al.,  2021; 
Ellickson-Larew et al., 2020).

Opposed to dissociative phenomena, psychotherapy 
aims  to  integrate  the  affective,  cognitive  behavioural 
and  physiological  system  within  a  person,  which  also 
sheds  light  on  our  and  other  studies,  showing  that 
trait  dissociation  might  exert  a  negative  impact  on 
long-term  psychotherapeutic 
treatment  outcomes 
(Zanarini et al., 2011). However, trait dissociation did 
not impair the immediate effects of DBT in the studied 
sample.  As  dissociation  was  classified  as  therapy- 
damaging  behaviour  in  our  programme,  patients 
were regularly encouraged to perform behavioural ana-
lyses of situations with even mildly intense dissociative 
states  and  to  use  skills  to  counteract  dissociative 
phenomena.  This  may  have  attenuated  negative 
effects of dissociation on therapeutic outcomes. More-
over,  individuals  with  high  levels  of  dissociation  may 
be more motivated to engage in the therapeutic process 
as they encounter increased distress. A study examin-
ing  the  impact  of  mentalization-based  therapy  in 
BPD  supports  this  assumption,  as  it  found  that  more 
dissociative  symptoms  heightened  the  probability  of 
therapy completion (Barnicot & Crawford, 2019).

Thus,  our  findings  might  encourage  focusing  on 
strategies to deal with dissociation also in relapse pre-
vention and in daily life in BPD patients with high trait 
dissociation.  While  there  are  some  strategies  and 
guidelines for addressing dissociation during therapy, 
only a few of the suggested methods specifically target-
ing  dissociation  are  evidence-based  (Brand  et  al., 
2019). A strategy to enhance the effectiveness of DBT 
therapy  for  individuals  with  dissociative  tendencies 
might  involve  a  stronger  emphasis  on  mentalization, 
a  critical  component  of  social  cognition  inversely 
linked  to  dissociative  symptoms  (Wagner-Skacel 
et al., 2022). Improvement of mentalization skills cor-
relates  with  enduring  therapeutic  progress  over  the 
long-term  (De  Meulemeester  et  al.,  2018)  and  dis-
sociation  might  especially  relate  to  internalizing  psy-
chopathology 
inward-focused 
characterized  by 
experiences  (Ellickson-Larew  et  al.,  2020)  that  might 
be  addressed  with  mentalization  by  getting  a  deeper 
understanding  of  own  thoughts,  emotions,  and 
internal  processes.  On  the  other  hand,  more  intense 
dissociation  was  linked  with  a  higher  frequency  of 
PTSD  diagnoses,  so  enhancing  DBT  with  traumafo-
cused strategies could also help to reduce dissociation 
(Bohus  et  al.,  2020).  Our  inpatient  DBT  programme 
incorporates trauma-specific interventions, potentially

explaining  why  dissociation  did  not  adversely  affect 
symptom  reduction.  Other  psychotherapeutic  treat-
ment  methods  for  dissociation  include  psychoeduca-
tion,  self-monitoring,  anti-dissociative  techniques, 
and  emotion  regulation  skills  (Bohus  et  al.,  2004, 
2020;  Brand  et  al.,  2019;  Zerubavel  &  Messman- 
Moore,  2015),  whereas  options  for  pharmacological 
treatment options remain limited (Sutar & Sahu, 2019).
Overall, our findings indicate that trait dissociation is 
associated with poorer health outcomes, increased self- 
harm,  emotional  abuse,  and  reduced  follow-up  effec-
tiveness of DBT treatment. This raises questions about 
the  relationships  among  these  factors.  We  propose 
that dissociation hinders the inherent capacity to syn-
thesize  life  experiences  into  a  cohesive  framework, 
which is crucial for nurturing a stable yet adaptable per-
sonality characterized by self-compassion (Boon et al., 
2013). Specifically, impaired self-esteem, closely linked 
to  traumatic  invalidation  as  a  key  form  of  emotional 
abuse  may  lead  to  affective  instability  (Kockler  et  al., 
2022) and increased dissociation, which could explain 
the  association  we  found  between  emotional  abuse 
and  self-harm  behaviour  in  our  network  analysis. 
When  not  learning  to  associate  emotional  states  due 
to  traumatic  invalidation,  dissociation  may  occur  and 
lead to the creation of uncomfortable and uncategoriz-
able  psychological  states  by  causing  cognitive  and 
emotional disturbances in an individual’s awareness of 
their  psychological  states,  increasing  the  likelihood  of 
maladaptive  coping  strategies  such  as  self-harm,  risky 
behaviour,  or  substance  abuse.  These  dysfunctional 
coping  mechanisms  can  trigger  negative  emotions 
over  the  long  term  (Spitzer  et  al.,  2015)  and  maintain 
blind  spots  regarding  one’s  inner  psychological  states, 
perpetuating  further  maladaptive  behaviours.  This 
may also explain why individuals with a high symptom 
burden  particularly  benefit  from  DBT,  as  the  pro-
gramme specifically targets traumatic invalidation and 
seeks  to  modify  dysfunctional  behaviours.  However, 
these individuals may experience worse medium-term 
outcomes as the initial treatment effects diminish.

4.1.  Limitations  and  future  research

Several limitations of this study need to be considered. 
First, we used a naturalistic study design with advan-
tages  regarding  external  validity  and  reduced  risk  of 
a reactivity bias but also the lack of a systematic con-
trol with clear disadvantages upon determining caus-
alities.  Future  research  could  address  this  gap  by 
investigating DBT treatment outcomes with systema-
tic  allocation  to  treatment  groups  considering  dis-
sociation.  Second,  in  this  study,  we  did  not  measure 
the  probable  influence  of  DBT  treatment  on  state  or 
trait dissociative symptoms and only assessed trait dis-
sociation  before 
In 
addition, the network analysis relies on cross-sectional 

therapy  via  questionnaire.

baseline  data,  which  limits  the  ability  to  draw  causal 
inferences.  This  design  captures  correlations  at  a 
single point in time rather than dynamic relationships, 
potentially  obscuring  the  temporal  nature  of  symp-
toms  and  behaviours.  For  a  more  comprehensive 
understanding  of  interacting  symptoms,  inclusion  of 
repeated  assessments  of  both  trait  and  state  dis-
sociation  would  be  feasible.  Moreover,  the  multifa-
ceted  and  intricate  nature  of  dissociation,  which 
lacks a precise and universally agreed-upon definition 
(Giesbrecht et al., 2008) remains a fundamental issue 
persisting  in  the  investigation  of  this  phenomenon. 
Third,  our  follow-up  data  are  biased  by  the  fact  that 
responders to follow-up were characterized by signifi-
cantly lower trait dissociation upon admission. Thus, 
the  significance  of  our  data  on  treatment  success  is 
limited  regarding  highly  dissociative 
individuals, 
affecting  the  generalizability  of  our  findings.  Fourth, 
our dataset exhibited a relatively high number of miss-
ing values, which could introduce biases into the mul-
tiple imputation process we utilized to replace missing 
data in the network analyses.

5.  Conclusion

Our study results emphasize the importance of focusing 
on dissociative symptoms in patients with BPD particu-
larly regarding follow-up therapy outcomes. Treating dis-
sociative symptoms could potentially mitigate self-harm 
patterns,  particularly  self-injury  and  in  the  context  of 
early traumatization, dissociation and self-harm, focusing 
on emotional abuse might be particularly effective.
