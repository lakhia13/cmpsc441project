Stuttering
Clinical and research update

Hector R. Perez MD MS  James H. Stoeckle

Abstract
Objective  To  provide  an  update  on  the  epidemiology,  genetics,  pathophysiology,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  of 
developmental stuttering.

Quality  of  evidence  The  MEDLINE  and  Cochrane  databases  were  searched  for  past  and  recent  studies  on 
the  epidemiology,  genetics,  pathophysiology,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  of  developmental  stuttering.  Most 
recommendations are based on small studies, limited-quality evidence, or consensus.

Main message  Stuttering is a speech disorder, common in persons of all ages, that affects normal fluency and time 
patterning  of  speech.  Stuttering  has  been  associated  with  differences  in  brain  anatomy,  functioning,  and  dopamine 
regulation  thought  to  be  due  to  genetic  causes.  Attention  to  making  a  correct  diagnosis  or  referral  in  children  is 
important because there is growing consensus that early intervention with speech therapy for children who stutter is 
critical. For adults, stuttering can be associated with substantial psychosocial morbidity including social anxiety and 
low  quality  of  life.  Pharmacologic  treatment  has  received  attention  in  recent  years,  but  clinical  evidence  is  limited. 
The mainstay of treatment for children and adults remains speech therapy.

EDITOR’S KEY POINTS
 • Stuttering is a common speech disorder 
that normally resolves by early adolescence. 
Developmental stuttering can be distinguished 
from typical disfluency of childhood by occasional 
prolongation of sounds and increased learned 
secondary behaviour, including closing the eyes or 
tensing facial muscles while stuttering. 

 • Stuttering is associated with psychosocial 
morbidity and worsened quality of life in adults. 

 • Medications, including atypical antipsychotics, 
might serve as an adjunctive treatment option 
for adults who stutter, but evidence is limited 
to small trials. Speech therapy performed by a 
specially qualified speech-language pathologist 
remains the mainstay of treatment at any 
age. Early intervention and referral for speech 
therapy in children is critical.

Conclusion  A  growing  body  of  research  has  attempted  to 
uncover  the  pathophysiology  of  stuttering.  Referral  for  speech 
therapy remains the best option for children and adults.

Stuttering is a common speech disorder in persons of all ages 

that  can  cause  disturbances  in  the  normal  fluency  and  time 
patterning  of  speech.1  Developmental  stuttering  (DS)—stut-
tering  that  is  inappropriate  for  the  level  of  language  develop-
ment—is the most common form.2 Current evidence suggests the 
disorder  stems  from  inherited  central  nervous  system  abnormali-
ties that disrupt fluent speech.3

The  incidence  of  DS  varies  according  to  age  group  and  the 
exact  definition  of  stuttering  used.  A  lifetime  incidence  (chance 
that an individual will ever stutter) of 5% is the most consistently 
reported  statistic.  However,  recent  data  suggest  a  lifetime  inci-
dence closer to 10%,4,5 with most of the burden in children. Up to 
90%  of  children  who  stutter  (CWS)  will  naturally  recover  during 
childhood.  Adults  who  did  not  recover  in  childhood  are  said  to 
have persistent DS, which is estimated to occur in less than 1% of 
the  population.4  Acquired  forms  of  stuttering  thought  to  be  sec-
ondary to emotional trauma or brain damage are rarer, although 
exact  estimates  are  unknown.6  Males  are  4  times  more  likely  to 
have DS compared with females,4 and DS is more likely to persist 
in males than in their female counterparts. Late age of onset, lon-
ger duration of stuttering, family history of persistence, and lower 
language and nonverbal skills are other predictors of persistence.7
Prompt  diagnosis  in  children  is  critical,  as  early  intervention 
yields  the  best  outcomes.8  Family  doctors  or  pediatricians  are 
often  the  first  health  care  contact  for  CWS.  For  adults  who  stut-
ter  (AWS),  physician  knowledge  of  the  causes,  treatments,  and

indications  for  referral  can  assure  appropriate  manage-
ment  in  this  population.  In  either  case,  a  more  robust 
understanding  will  better  equip  physicians,  alongside 
speech  pathologists,  to  identify  stuttering  and  manage 
associated psychological issues.

Quality of evidence
We  reviewed  the  literature  on  DS  by  searching  the 
MEDLINE  and  Cochrane  databases  for  relevant  articles 
on  the  epidemiology,  genetics,  pathophysiology,  diag-
nosis, and treatment of the condition. We also reviewed 
the  references  of  each  article  to  ensure  that  we  were 
including  relevant  articles  that  might  not  have  been 
indexed  by  either  of  the  databases.  Last,  we  consulted 
with  several  experts  in  epidemiology,  genetics,  func-
tional  brain  anatomy,  and  diagnosis  of  stuttering  to 
ensure  that  we  included  all  important  data  while  keep-
ing  the  review  relevant  and  pertinent  to  primary  care 
physicians.  Most  recommendations  are  based  on  small 
studies, limited-quality evidence, or consensus.

Main message
Pathophysiology.  There  is  no  consensus  on  the  patho-
physiology  of  stuttering.  Research  exploring  sensory, 
motor,  and  cognitive  causes9  has  mostly  yielded  incon-
sistent  or  nonreproducible  results.  One  consistent  find-
ing  has  been  abnormal  auditory  feedback  systems  in 
persons who stutter (PWS).10

Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated differences 
in anatomy and function of the brain in CWS compared 
with  fluent  controls,  specifically  in  auditory  and  motor 
regions  and  the  basal  ganglia.11  These  abnormalities 
might  increase  over  time  in  individuals  who  do  not 
recover from DS. Adults who stutter demonstrate hyper-
activity  of  right  hemispheric  regions12,13  and  abnormal 
coordination between brain areas that plan and execute 
speech.14  It  is  unclear  whether  anatomic  and  functional 
differences are a cause of stuttering or an adaptation to 
stuttering in the adult brain.

Dopamine  dysregulation  might  also  be  a  contribu-
tor.  Levodopa  administration  increases  disfluency,15,16 
while  administration  of  dopamine  antagonists  has 
improved fluency.17-20 One study using positron emission 
tomography showed increased uptake of the fluorinated 
dopamine  precursor  6-FDOPA  in  PWS  compared  with 
controls,21 suggesting hyperactivity of dopaminergic sys-
tems in the central nervous system.

Genetics.  Since  the  1930s,  research  has  supported  a 
genetic  basis  of  stuttering.  Familial  studies  have  consis-
tently  shown  that  PWS  are  more  likely  than  controls  to 
have family members who also report a history of stutter-
ing. A recent review4 of 28 studies estimated that between 
30%  and  60%  of  PWS  had  a  positive  family  history  com-
pared  with  less  than  10%  of  controls.  Twin  studies  have 

confirmed these findings.22-24 Additionally, male relatives 
carry  a  substantially  higher  risk  than  female  relatives 
do.25-27  Recovery  and  persistence  appear  to  be  distinct 
heritable conditions.28,29

Stuttering has been associated with changes on chro-
mosomes  9,  10,  12,  13,  and  18.30-34  Genetic  analysis  of 
the  DRD2  gene,  a  prevalent  dopamine  receptor  in  the 
brain,  showed  increased  frequency  of  a  specific  allele 
in  AWS35;  however,  this  finding  was  not  replicated  in  a 
subsequent  analysis.36  Large  association  studies  have 
identified  9  genes  associated  with  stuttering,  some  of 
which were on chromosomes previously associated with 
stuttering.37  Proposed  functions  of  the  identified  genes 
include  neurometabolism,  cell-cell  interaction,  embry-
onic  transcription  regulation,  and  behaviour  modifica-
tion. Despite these promising results, clear mechanisms 
of actions have yet to be identified.

Diagnosis.  Family  physicians  might  be  the  first  con-
tact  for  parents  of  CWS,  so  knowledge  of  the  types  of 
disfluencies  is  important.  Table  1  outlines  forms  of 
early  disfluency.38  Normal  disfluency,  or  disfluency  that 
is  not  pathologic  and  that  can  be  part  of  normal  lan-
guage  development  between  the  ages  of  18  months 
and  7  years,  can  result  in  repetitions  of  sounds,  syl-
lables,  or  words.38  Generally,  after  about  3  years  of  age, 
normal  disfluency  might  cause  the  repetition  of  whole 
words  or  phrases  (eg,  “I  want  …  I  want  …  I  want  to 
go”).  Such  behaviour  might  increase  when  children  are 
tired, upset, or being rushed, but it generally waxes and 
wanes,  sometimes  disappearing  for  months.  Children 
with  typical  disfluencies  do  not  notice  or  become  frus-
trated by their speaking difficulties.

Children  with  DS,  on  the  other  hand,  can  be  classi-
fied  into  categories  based  on  the  severity  of  stuttering. 
Children with mild stuttering, which can begin between 
18  months  and  7  years,  show  similar  patterns  of  rep-
etitions  with  greater  frequency  of  disfluency.  In  addi-
tion  to  repetitions,  children  might  occasionally  prolong 
sounds  (“Mmmm-ommy”).  Nonetheless,  it  is  often  dif-
ficult to distinguish the mechanics of speech in children 
with  normal  disfluency  from  those  with  mild  stuttering, 
so  the  presence  of  other  secondary  behaviour  is  help-
ful. Children with mild stuttering might begin to manifest 
secondary  behaviour  such  as  closing  their  eyes  or  tens-
ing  facial  muscles  during  stuttering  episodes.  Children 
with mild stuttering might feel frustrated at times but are 
often not overly concerned.38

Children with severe stuttering, more common in later 
childhood, have speech disfluencies in many more speak-
ing  situations.  These  might  include  silent  blockages  of 
speech lasting 1 second or longer. Severe stuttering might 
produce  more  learned  secondary  behaviour,  including 
eye blinks and looking away. Children with severe stutter-
ing  are  frustrated  and  embarrassed,  creating  a  potential

Speech behaviour 
you might see or 
hear

Occasional (not more than once in 
every 10 sentences), brief (typically 
0.5 s or less) repetitions of sounds, 
syllables, or short words (eg, li-like 
this)

Frequent (3% or more of words), 
longer (typically 0.5 to 1 s) 
repetitions of sounds, syllables, or 
short words (eg, li-li-li-like this). 
Occasional prolongations of sounds

Very frequent (10% or more of 
words), and often very long (1 s 
or longer) repetitions of sounds, 
syllables, or short words; frequent 
sound prolongations, and 
complete blocks (where little or 
no sound comes out)

Similar to mild stuttering only 
more frequent and noticeable; 
some rise in pitch of voice during 
stuttering; more physical tension; 
extra sounds or words used as 
“starters”

Tends to be present in most 
speaking situations; far more 
consistent and nonfluctuating 
than for children with mild 
stuttering

Other behaviour 
you might see or 
hear

Occasional pauses, hesitations in 
speech, or fillers such as “uh,” “er,” or 
“um”; changing of words or thoughts

When problem is 
most noticeable

Tends to come and go when child is 
tired, excited, talking about complex 
or new topics, asking or answering 
questions, or talking to unresponsive 
listeners

Child’s reaction

None apparent

Repetitions (eg, “she-she-she”) and 
prolongations (eg, “shshshe”) begin 
to be associated with eye closing 
and blinking, looking to the side, 
and some physical tension in and 
around the lips

situations to those for normally 
disfluent children but is more often 
present than absent

Some children have awareness but 
little concern; some show

fear  of  speaking.  This  might  lead  to  psychosocial  impair-
ment  such  as  social  anxiety;  however,  there  is  no  evi-
dence  that  severe  stuttering  is  associated  with  learning 
disabilities or other behavioural problems. Severe stutter-
ing is more likely to persist into adulthood.38

Adults  who  stutter  tend  to  manifest  similar  patterns 
of  speech  disfluencies.  Repetitions,  prolongations,  and 
silent  blockages  are  common  and  can  be  disabling.39 
Secondary  behaviour  might  be  prominent.  Techniques 
used  to  avoid  challenging  words,  such  as  substitution, 
can be deep-rooted. Adults who stutter show wide vari-
ation in their degree of frustration with speaking.40-42

Psychosocial morbidity.  Social and generalized anxiety 
have shown robust positive associations with stuttering, 
theorized to be a result of the cumulative negative social 
effects  of  stuttering.43,44  While  the  relationship  between 
stuttering  and  anxiety  is  inconclusive  in  children,  there 
is  good  evidence  supporting  the  relationship  in  adoles-
cents, young adults, and older adults.45

The  evidence  suggests  that  most  CWS  do  not  show 
increased  anxiety  until  adolescence,  although  conclu-
sions  are  limited  by  the  heterogeneity  of  studies  in  this 

area.46,47  One  theory  suggests  that  CWS  experience  neg-
ative environmental risk factors beginning in early child-
hood,  including  negative  experiences  of  socialization, 
which  coalesce  during  adolescence,  a  time  of  greater 
social  and  physical  change.46  A  study  of  adolescents 
who  stutter  aged  12  to  17  concluded  that  38%  qualified 
for  at  least  1  mental  disorder  according  to  Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, 
criteria;  anxiety  was  the  most  prevalent.48  In  that  study, 
older  adolescents  aged  15  to  17  reported  significantly 
greater  anxiety  (P = .010)  and  emotional  and  behavioral 
problems  (P = .036)  compared  with  adolescents  aged 
12  to  14,  although  mean  scores  were  normal  in  both 
groups. Stuttering in adults, on the other hand, has been 
associated  with  2-fold  increased  odds  of  any  mood  dis-
order49  and  3-fold  higher  odds  of  personality  disorders 
compared with matched controls.50

Stuttering  in  adults  has  also  been  associated  with 
lower  quality  of  life,  occupational  and  educational  bur-
dens, and barriers to receiving high-quality health care.51,52 
In a survey of AWS, more than 70% agreed that stuttering 
decreased  the  chance  of  being  hired  or  receiving  promo-
tions, and 68% reported that stuttering had interfered with

ing  severity  was  negatively  related  to  highest  educational 
achievement.54 A recent qualitative study found that AWS 
sometimes  avoided  medical  interactions  or  avoided  dis-
cussing sensitive topics with their physicians.55

Treatment

Pharmacologic:  With  increasing  knowledge  of  the 
pathophysiology  of  stuttering,  pharmacologic  manage-
ment of stuttering has received attention.56,57 Clinical tri-
als have primarily evaluated antidepressants, anxiolytics, 
and  antipsychotics.  Evidence  supporting  use  of  these 
agents is limited.58

Antidepressants  have  not  shown  a  clear  benefit.  The 
selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor  paroxetine  was 
not  associated  with  a  significant  change  in  fluency.59 
The  tricyclic  antidepressants  clomipramine  and  desip-
ramine  showed  minimal  short-term  improvements  in 
some measures of fluency and decreases in self-reported 
speaking  avoidance  compared  with  placebo  in  a  trial 
of  16  participants59,60;  a  separate  analysis  showed  clo-
mipramine  to  be  superior  to  desipramine  on  self-report 
scales  on  fluency.60  However,  neither  manuscript  pro-
vided long-term data.

Despite  the  association  between  anxiety  and  stutter-
ing,  few  trials  have  measured  the  effect  of  anxiolytics. 
Data  on  benzodiazepine  efficacy,  in  particular,  are  lim-
ited. A noncontrolled trial of 3 participants taking a com-
bination  of  an  antidepressant  and  alprazolam  showed 
marked  improvement  in  stuttering  severity  scores.61 
More  recently,  pagoclone,  a  novel  non-benzodiazepine 
γ-aminobutyric  acid  modulator,  was  tested  in  the  larg-
est  randomized  controlled  trial  of  stuttering.57  Despite  a 
promising 4-fold reduction in stuttering in phase IIa stud-
ies,  results  from  phase  IIb  studies  have  yet  to  be  pub-
lished, and the company terminated future research.62

Antipsychotics  that  block  dopamine  receptors  in 
the  brain  have  shown  promising  results,  but  much 
of  the  data  are  not  easily  replicable,  are  older,  or  are 
limited  to  small  studies.  Haloperidol  was  first  tested 
in  1971  in  a  randomized  trial  of  36  participants  and 
showed  remarkable  results:  a  reduction  from  50.8% 
disfluencies  to  9.7%  after  8  weeks.63  Subsequent  stud-
ies  have  inconsistently  replicated  these  findings,  and 
treatment  has  been  associated  with  substantial  side 
effects. Based upon a stringent set of criteria, a recent 
systematic review concluded that the positive effect of 
haloperidol  on  stuttering  symptoms  is  not  supported 
by  the  literature.58  The  atypical  antipsychotic  risperi-
done  showed  significant  improvements  in  stuttering 
at  6  weeks  compared  with  both  placebo  and  baseline 
(P = .025). 19 Olanzapine, another atypical antipsychotic, 
showed  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  stuttering 
symptoms  compared  with  placebo  in  a  randomized 
trial  of  24  participants,20  with  the  primary  side  effect 

being  weight  gain.  Neither  of  these  studies  assessed 
long-term  effects.  Case  studies  have  documented  suc-
cesses in treating stuttering using asenapine, a newer 
atypical  antipsychotic,  but  there  are  no  controlled 
studies yet.64

Nonpharmacologic  treatments  and  speech  ther-
apy:  There  is  minimal  high-quality  evidence  available 
testing  the  efficacy  of  nonpharmacologic  treatment  of 
stuttering. Acupuncture,65 electromyography feedback of 
activity in lip muscles,66 and delayed auditory feedback67 
have been examined in small studies with varying rates 
of  success.  A  recent  review56  was  unable  to  make  any 
definitive  recommendations  for  specific  nonpharmaco-
logic treatments.

Speech  therapy  performed  by  a  specially  qualified 
speech-language  pathologist  remains  the  mainstay  of 
treatment.  Such  treatment  differs  substantially  for  chil-
dren and adults. Treatment of children has shifted in the 
past  20  to  30  years  from  a  “hands-off”  attitude  to  more 
aggressive  intervention.68  Consensus  is  that  early  inter-
vention  with  children  is  key,  although  there  is  debate 
about  the  preferred  approach.8  Multifactorial  treatment 
strategies are the dominant paradigm in North America, 
and  emphasize  treating  the  child,  identifying  his  or  her 
stressors,  and  modifying  environmental  stressors  start-
ing  from  preschool.  In  contrast,  the  Lidcombe  Program 
uses  operant  conditioning  techniques  to  teach  parents 
to  verbalize  positive  and  negative  responses  to  their 
child’s speech.

Treatment  of  adults  has  historically  focused  on 
stuttering  management  and  speech  restructuring. 
Stuttering  management  treats  cognitive  and  behav-
ioural  issues  associated  with  stuttering,  particularly 
to  relieve  anxiety  about  speaking  and  stuttering.  One 
randomized  controlled  trial  of  cognitive  behavioural 
therapy  performed  by  speech  therapists  showed 
decreased  social  anxiety  and  psychological  distress  in 
AWS.69  Speech  restructuring  teaches  new  speech  pat-
terns,  the  most  common  of  which  is  slowed  speech, 
or  controlling  and  slowing  the  rate  of  speech.  Some 
newer  intensive  programs,  such  as  that  at  the  Hollins 
Communications  Research  Institute  in  Virginia,  com-
bine  both  approaches.  Efficacy  data  on  these  intensive 
programs are limited.56

Conclusion
Developmental  stuttering  is  a  common  speech  disorder 
that  normally  resolves  by  early  adolescence.  Persistent 
forms are rarer and are associated with psychiatric and 
social  morbidity.  Table  2  summarizes  the  key  recom-
mendations  for  practice.7,35,40,41,48,49,55,63  A  growing  body 
of  genetic,  neurologic,  and  theoretical  research  has 
provided  insight  into  the  pathophysiology  of  stuttering, 
but  there  is  no  consensus  to  date.  Pharmacologic  treat-
ments  have  received  attention,  but  further  research  is
