Abstract

AIMS—There is growing interest in early intervention in psychotic disorders. However, gender 
differences in the outcomes of such treatment have not been studied in a randomized clinical trial.

METHODS—Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with less than 6 months 
antipsychotic exposure entered a cluster randomized trial of early intervention services compared 
to usual care in the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program 
(RAISE-ETP) study. Masked evaluators assessed the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) and the Positive 
and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) every 6 months. Our secondary analyses examined gender 
differences in baseline characteristics, two-year gender outcomes, and intervention responses.

RESULTS—Altogether 404 individuals aged 15–40 entered the study: 111 (27.4%) women and 
293 (72.5%) men. At baseline, women were significantly more likely to have been married 
(p=0.007) and to be living independently (p=0.012) than men. Women were also more likely 
to be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (p=0.006) and scored higher on the 
depression subscale of the PANSS (p=0.0004) but not the CDSS. Women were less likely to 
use or abuse cannabis (p=0.0004), though no less likely to abuse alcohol. Controlling for these 
differences, there were no significant gender differences in the QLS or PANSS outcomes.

CONCLUSION—Baseline gender differences in comorbid substance use and prevalence of mood 
symptoms in women with first episode psychosis are consistent with previous studies. The absence 
of significant gender differences in outcomes with early intervention has not been previously 
reported in a multi-site randomized US clinical trial.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

There is increasing interest in biological and psychosocial differences between women 
and men in the clinical presentation, course of illness, and treatment outcomes of mental 
disorders and specifically in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. (Riecher-Rössler, 
2017) These concerns reflect a broader concern that sex and gender influences on health 
have been long neglected throughout medicine. (Thande et al., 2019) Recent studies suggest 
that women with psychotic disorders are more likely to present with positive and affective 
symptoms while men have more prominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairments, 
(Irving et al., 2021) (Heitz et al., 2019) (Comacchio et al., 2020) and are more likely to 
meet criteria for comorbid substance use disorders. (Irving et al., 2021) Female patients 
have been found to experience a pre-psychotic prodrome for twice as long as male patients, 
(Seeman, 2018) and experience full psychotic disorders at later age. (Seeman, 2019) Women 
have also been reported to experience less impaired social functioning than men (Dubreucq 
et al., 2021) and it has been suggested that women respond more quickly and completely 
to available treatments. (Seeman, 2019) While short-term studies suggest better quality of 
life among women with psychotic disorders than men, (Dubreucq et al., 2021) longer term 
studies suggest these differences dissipate over time. (Thara & Kamath, 2015).

Among the most important recent developments in the treatment of schizophrenia has been 
growing evidence that early intervention services (IES), known as Coordinated Specialty 
Care in the United States (Heinssen RK et al., 2022) can have important positive impact 
on outcomes on when provided early in course of the illness. (Correll et al., 2018) Several 
studies have focused specifically on differences between women and men in their first 
episode of psychosis (FEP). One study from Switzerland (Heitz et al., 2019) and another 
from Italy (Comacchio et al., 2020) found that women presented with higher levels of 
affective symptoms, greater insight into their illness, and higher levels of functioning than 
men, who showed more severe negative symptoms.

Data from 1,098 Early Intervention Service patients in London showed men with early 
psychosis were more violent than women at both admission and 1-year follow up while 
women had more suicide attempts at admission and more psychiatric hospitalization at 
follow-up (Tseliou F, 2017). Another London study of 3,350 first episode patients showed 
significant differences between sexes in on 21 symptoms identified through natural language 
processing of electronic health records. The study concluded that men had more negative 
symptoms and women had more depressive and manic symptoms (Irving et al., 2021). 
Finally, in a major longitudinal study, five years of data from 578 participants in the Danish 
OPUS randomized trial of intensive early psychosis treatment (Thorup A, 2014) were used 
to compare men and women at 2- and 5-year follow-up assessments. However differences 
between men and women in the impact of treatment were not examined (Thorup A, 2014). 
As in previous studies, males consistently had more severe negative symptoms, were more 
likely to live alone, and had more problems with substance abuse while women achieved 
higher levels of social functioning at follow-up and were more likely to reach a state of 
recovery.

To our knowledge, no study has evaluated gender differences in service use and outcomes 
between treatment groups in a randomized clinical trial of Coordinated Specialty Care for 
early psychosis. The recent National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded study called 
Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) 
was a 34-site cluster randomized trial of 404 patients with FEP performed in community 
clinics. The coordinated specialty care intervention was called NAVIGATE to indicate that 
it was designed to help clients find their way to comprehensive services and ultimately 
to recovery. In the RAISE-ETP study, NAVIGATE improved quality of life, reduced 
symptoms (Kane JM, 2016) and increased school and work involvement (Rosenheck et 
al., 2017) as compared to usual community careInteraction analyses have shown greater 
improvement in those with shorter duration of untreated psychosis (Kane JM, 2016) 
or higher socio-economic status (Bennett and Rosenheck, 2020). However, a secondary 
analysis comparing the response of men and women to treatment has yet to be conducted. In 
this paper, we use data available from the RAISE-ETP trial, to compare women and men on 
baseline characteristics, two-year outcomes and use of services, and differential response to 
NAVIGATE or usual care. Since available studies suggests that women have better baseline 
functioning and quality of life, greater insight than men we hypothesized they would benefit 
more than men from NAVIGATE compared to usual care.

METHODS

Previous publications have included details on the recruitment process including a 
CONSORT diagram of recruitment and disposition, (Kane JM, 2016) and a detailed 
description of NAVIGATE (Mueser et al., 2015).

Subjects and Sites

Inclusion criteria included: presenting for first episode of psychosis (schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective bipolar disorder, schizoaffective depressive disorder, Schizophreniform 
provisional or definite, or brief psychotic disorder), and exposure to antipsychotic 
medication for fewer than 6 months. Enrollment occurred between July 2010 and July 2012. 
Written informed consent was obtained from adult participants or from legal guardians for 
those under 18 years old. The Institutional Review Boards of the coordinating center and 
at each site approved the study. A NIMH Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided 
oversight to the original study. Thirty-four community mental health treatment centers 
across the United States were randomized to provide either NAVIGATE or to usual 
community care. The Clinical Trials.gov number for the original study was NCT01321177.

Intervention

NAVIGATE included: a) a web-based decision support system for assisting personalized 
medication management called COMPASS; b) family psycho-education; c) individual, 
resilience-focused training in illness self-management; and d) supported employment and 
education via remote training and consultation. (Mueser et al., 2015) Participants without 
initial interest in work or school received continuing encouragement to participate in 
supported employment and education

Assessments

Page 4

Masked evaluators remotely assessed quality of life and symptoms (see measures, below) 
at baseline and every 6 months for two years via secure videoconferencing. Additional 
self-report assessments were obtained by local research assistants at each site.

Self-report data on socio-demographic characteristics were recorded at baseline. Interviews 
measured service use and employment on a monthly basis.

Measures

Initial assessment included documentation of socio-demographic characteristics. A central 
team of blinded evaluators assessed quality of life using the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) 
(Heinrichs et al., 1984) with 4 subscales of interpersonal relationships, instrumental role 
functioning, intrapsychic foundations (more recently re-conceptualized as “motivation”), 
and common objects and activities used in daily life. Psychiatric symptom severity was 
measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987) with 
five subscales (Wallwork et al., 2012); depression was assessed with the Calgary Depression 
Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS). (Addington D, 1993)

Patients self-reported well-being was assessed using a reduced versions of the perceived 
well-being scale (Ryff, 1989), the Mental Health Recovery Measure, (Young & Bullock, 
2003) the Autonomy Support Scale-Short Form, (Williams et al., 1998) the Brief Evaluation 
of Medication Influences and Beliefs, (Dolderk et al., 2004) and the Stigma Scale. (King et 
al., 2007)

Statistical Methods

Baseline characteristics were compared between genders using linear regression with 
interactions between round dummies and gender.

All standard errors in the longitudinal regressions were clustered by site to account 
for arbitrary error correlations within a site, including across individuals over time. 
All regressions also controlled for baseline marital status, current residence, diagnosis, 
cannabis use, previous hospitalizations, age, and baseline depression symptoms because 
these variables were shown to be imbalanced by gender at baseline.

Longitudinal analyses of gender differences included terms representing gender, time in 
months since the baseline (a single continuous variable) and the interaction of gender by 
time.

Longitudinal analyses of gender differences in treatment effects included main effects for 
gender, time, and treatment; the interaction of gender by time and treatment by time; and the 
term of interest, the three-way interaction of gender by time by treatment. Subscales were 
examined only for the primary outcome, the QLS, to limit artifactual results from multiple 
comparisons.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

Page 5

Table 1 presents the demographic comparison of men and women at study entry. A total 
of 111 (27.4%) women participants and 293 (72.5%) men participants were included in 
the study. Mean age of women was significantly older at 24.33 ± 6.19 years compared to 
22.68 ± 4.5 years of male patients (p = 0.0067). Eighty nine (80.2%) of women were never 
married, compared to 269 (91.8%) of men (p=0.007). A total of 31 (27.9%) of women lived 
independently and 72 (64.9%) lived with family members including parents, grandparents, 
and siblings. In comparison, only 41 (14.0%) of male patients lived independently and 215 
(73.4%) lived with family. Women were significantly more likely to have been married 
(p=0.007) and significantly more likely to be living independently (p=0.012) compared to 
male patients. A total of 44 (40%) of women were covered by public insurance compared to 
83 (28.5%) of men (p=0.03).

There were no significant gender differences in race/ethnicity, patient education and 
employment status, or parental education.

In diagnosis, a great proportion of women than men (14 women, 12.6% and 10 (3.4%) men) 
were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (p=0.006).

Turning to substance abuse or dependence, women were overall less likely to use or abuse 
drugs of any type with 24 (28.8%) meeting abuse or dependence criteria for lifetime 
cannabis use, compared to 116 (39.6%) male patients (p=0.002). There were no significant 
gender differences in lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence. Recent use of illegal drugs 
including cannabis also was significantly different across genders with women reporting 
drug use (mean 1.55 ± 5.33 days of the 30 days prior to enrollment, significantly fewer days 
than men (mean 3.74 ± 8.07 days (p=0.008).

There were no significant gender differences the proportions with one or more 
hospitalizations prior to study enrollment, on measures of medication compliance or on 
either the duration of untreated psychosis or the percentage of subjects above the median 
duration of untreated psychosis. (Table 3).

On the Heinrich Carpenter measure of Quality of Life Interview women scored significantly 
higher than men (p=0.02) (Table 2). Specifically, women averaged higher on on the 
interpersonal relations and the common objects and activities subscales (Table 2). There 
were no differences within the instrumental role subscale and intrapsychic foundations 
subscale.

On the PANSS symptom severity scale, women scored significantly higher (p=0.0004) on 
the depression subscale (Table 3). There were no significant gender differences on the total 
PANSS score or on other subscales of the PANSS (positive, negative, disorganized/concrete, 
and excited). There were also no significant differences in CDSS, a specific depression 
symptom severity scale.

There were no further gender differences in any self-reported social and well-being 
measures including the perceived Well-being Scale, the Mental Health Recovery Measure, 
the Autonomy Support Scale-Short Form, the Brief Evaluation of Medication Influences and 
Beliefs score, and the Stigma Scale score.

Longitudinal Analyses

Comparison of the duration of participation in the trial, adjusted for significant baseline 
differences showed no significant differences by gender: Men =13.57 months (sd=5.46), 
Women 14.47 months (sd=8.23), t = −1.11, p= 0.28.

Longitudinal analyses examining differences in outcomes by gender (i.e. the interaction 
of gender by time) showed no significant differences on the primary outcomes of QLS 
or on total PANSS symptoms (Table 4, column 3) but did show a significantly greater 
improvement in the intrapsychic functioning sub-scale of the QOL among women (p<.05).

Evaluation of differences in treatment effects between women and men (interaction of 
gender by time and by treatment group) showed no significant differences on any measure of 
clinical outcome or NAVIGATE service use (Table 4, column 4, Figures 1 and 2).

DISCUSSION

Secondary analysis of RAISE-ETP data on participants with FEP revealed that at study 
entry women were older with higher QLS scores and better social functioning than men, 
characteristics that are consistent with previous literature. (Seeman, 2019; Thorup A, 2014; 
Tseliou F, 2017).

They also had more severe mood symptoms on the PANSS although not the CDSS, (Irving 
et al., 2021) (Tseliou F, 2017) and reported less use of cannabis but not alcohol or other 
drugs.

Longitudinal analyses, the primary focus of this study, showed that controlling for these 
admission differences, there were no significant gender differences in 2-year measures of 
quality of life, in schizophrenia or depressive symptoms; or in use of key components of 
NAVIGATE. Furthermore, no gender differences were observed in response to treatment 
over two years.

Previous longitudinal research on gender and schizophrenia suggests that women fare better 
than men early in the disease course, possibly due to their older age at onset and better 
adherence and response to antipsychotic medications, (Dubreucq et al., 2021) (Thorup A, 
2014) though one study showed this advantage fades over time. (Thara & Kamath, 2015)

A review of the literature on the association of gender and treatment outcomes in mental 
disorders other than FEP reveals mixed findings. A general review of Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD) treatment outcome studies found equivocal effects of gender (Blain et al., 
2010) although a large multi-site study from the Veterans Health Administration reported 
greater reduction in PTSD symptom scores among female than male Veterans. (Stefanovics 
& Rosenheck, 2020) This finding of superior outcomes for women diagnosed with PTSD

has been reported in some additional VA (Eftekhari, 2013) a non-VA samples. (Bekes et al., 
2016; Galovski et al., 2013) and is consistent with the superior social adjustment of women 
in the baseline data presented here and with other longitudinal studies of FEP (Thorup A, 
2014).

In the realm of substance use disorders, a review of 126 efficacy and effectiveness trials for 
nicotine dependence found 59 in which women were significantly less likely to quit smoking 
and only two trials that showed women to be significantly more likely to quit smoking than 
men. (Smith et al., 2016)

In the treatment of opioid use disorder women appear to do better than men on measures of 
both retention in treatment and relapse to drug use. Weinstein and colleagues, for example, 
reported women were 55% more likely to remain in treatment than men (Weinstein et 
al., 2017) and a seven-year follow-up study found that women had both greater treatment 
retention and employment and lower relapse rates than men. (Ohlin et al., 2015)

Looking at other psychiatric conditions, Cuijpers and colleagues reported no gender effect 
on depression outcome after CBT and pharmacotherapy (Cuijpers et al., 2014) and a general 
review found no gender effect on short- and long-term outcome in anorexia nervosa. (Strobel 
et al., 2018)

This brief review of differences between women and men in studies of mental health 
disorders other than FEP similarly showed some evidence of superior baseline social 
adjustment and social adjustment outcomes among women but no consistent pattern of 
gender differences in treatnent effects.This pattern is consistent with the findings of better 
social adjustment at baseline in this study but no longitudinal differences in service use or 
outcomes..

Several methodological limitations require comment. First gender comparisons inevitably 
require observational research designs since random assignment is not possible. As a result, 
there may be unmeasured factors that influence outcomes differently among women and 
men. Since we found no evidence of gender differences in outcomes, after controlling for 
baseline differences that were measured, it seems unlikely that such factors would have 
altered our main findings. Second the study was not specifically designed to examine gender 
interactions affecting outcomes and may not have been adequately powered, especially in 
view of the fact that the sample of women was smaller than that of men. However, the fact 
that significant interactions have been found in other secondary analyses of the duration 
of untreated psychosis (Kane JM, 2016) and social class (Bennett & Rosenheck, 2020) 
suggests that the sample was adequate for identifying significant interactions if they existed. 
Third, although the study was conducted at 34 sites across the US the representativeness of 
the sample is unknown and thus the generalizability of the results is uncertain. Finally, this 
study was conducted five years after the publication of Kane et al. (2016) using a public 
release of the data from NIMH and a different analyst (DB) from the original RAISE-ETP 
analytic team. In contrast to Kane et al. (2016), who use a three-level mixed effects linear 
regression to model clustered data structure, we use a linear regression with clustered

standard errors. This approach allows for an arbitrary correlation between the residuals of 
observations within a site or over time, which allows us to account for the clustered nature of 
the data while imposing fewer assumptions about the nature of the error structure. The Kane 
et al. (2016) analysis applies a square root transformation to time, however our analysis does 
not transform the time trend in this way. Longitudinal analyses were repeated with a square 
root transformation of time with no change in the results.

CONCLUSION

Secondary analysis of the RAISE-ETP trial found that after adjusting for baseline 
differences, there were no significant effects of gender on the primary outcome of quality of 
life, total schizophrenia symptoms, or use of Coordinated Specialty Care services. Perhaps 
more importantly, benefits of the NAVIGATE intervention as compared to usual community 
care also did not differ significantly by gender.
