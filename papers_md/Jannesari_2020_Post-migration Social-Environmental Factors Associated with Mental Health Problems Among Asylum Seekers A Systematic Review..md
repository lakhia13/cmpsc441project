Abstract
People seeking asylum are at an increased risk of mental disorder compared to refugees and other migrants. This paper aims 
to understand the impact of postmigration social–environmental factors to help inform efforts to reduce rates of mental dis-
order. We conducted a systematic review searching 11 databases, as well as 6 government and nongovernment websites. We 
asked 5 experts for recommendations, and carried out forwards and backwards citation tracking. From 7004 papers 21 were 
eligible and had the appropriate data. Narrative synthesis was conducted. 24 Social–environmental factors were identified and 
categorised into 7 themes: working conditions, social networks, economic class, living conditions, healthcare, community 
and identity, and the immigration system. Evidence suggests that discrimination and post-migration stress are associated with 
increased rates of mental disorder. The post-migration environment influences the mental health of people seeking asylum. 
Discrimination and post-migration stress are key factors, warranting further research and public attention.

Introduction

The UN Refugee Agency [1] estimates there are 25.9 million 
refugees globally and 3.5 million people seeking asylum. 
Venezuela, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo constitute the top five nationalities for 
those seeking asylum [1]. In 2018, a decision was made on 
around a third of asylum applications (1.1 million) with 
about half of these (500,100) resulting in some form of 
humanitarian protection [1]. It is clear from these figures

that the vast majority of applicants spend at least a year in 
the asylum system. During this time they must navigate an 
increasingly unwelcome sociopolitical atmosphere. Politi-
cians such as US President Trump have presented people 
seeking sanctuary as a threat to national security [2]. The 
marginal EU public sympathy in 2015, when migration flows 
began to substantially increase, has crystallised into security 
and financial concerns (e.g. [3].).

Evidence suggests that people seeking asylum are at an 
increased risk of developing mental disorders compared to 
refugees and the host population [4]. Potential reasons can 
be located at different stages of migration: pre-migration, 
transit and post-migration [5, 6]. Mental health research 
usually focuses on pre-migration stressors, such as how 
traumatic experiences in countries of origin affect mental 
health in host countries [7, 8]. However, post-migration fac-
tors mediate the impact of pre-migration stressors on mental 
health [9–11]. Carswell et al. [12] and Gorst-Unsworth and 
Goldenberg [13] go further, suggesting that post-migration 
factors may be more important than pre-migration factors 
for some forced migrant populations. Gorst-Unsworth and 
Goldenberg found that only 11% of Iraqi refugees inter-
viewed in the UK had PTSD though almost 65% had suf-
fered physical torture in Iraq. Contrastingly, close to 44%

had depression and this was primarily associated with a lack 
of social support in the UK.

In a brief literature review of post-migration risk fac-
tors related to asylum policy, Silove et al. [14] argued that 
low levels of financial support [13], the application pro-
cess and harsh living conditions [15], as well as loneliness 
and boredom [16] were associated with as symptoms of 
depression, PTSD and anxiety. They did not include results 
from  non-Western  countries  and  the  review  is  almost 
20 years old. Patel [17] conducted a systematic review of 
English language papers, finding evidence that detention 
[18], length of the asylum process [19] and legal status 
[20] were associated with mental health outcomes such 
as PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms and psychopa-
thology. Giacco’s recent review [21] included studies with 
both refugees and asylum seekers, suggesting that factors 
such as a sense of belonging (protective factor) and social 
isolation (risk factor) are associated with mental disorder. 
However, the review only considered papers from 2017 
onwards and only 3 of the 29 eligible non-review studies 
included asylum seekers in their sample, with none solely 
working with asylum seekers.

This review focuses on social–environmental factors, 
defined by Barnett and Casper [22] as a person’s ‘imme-
diate physical surroundings, social relationships, and cul-
tural milieus’, including ‘built infrastructure; labour mar-
kets… power relations; government… [and] beliefs about 
place and community’. Social–environmental factors can 
change, either through medium-term individual actions 
or  longer-term  policy  shifts.  They  are  easier  to  adjust 
than most sociodemographic factors, character traits, and 
individual beliefs. Walsh et al. [23] evidence that positive 
psychology interventions based on character traits such 
can have poor acceptability and be perceived as belittling. 
Though skills and competencies such as language abil-
ity or vocational qualifications are changeable, they have 
been excluded to keep the review conceptually coherent 
and manageable.

An appreciation of social–environmental factors, such 
as the sociopolitical context in which forced migrants are 
received, can also lead to more ethical and effective mental 
health practices and interventions [24]. This is in line with 
Medical Research Council guidance [25] emphasising the 
importance of context, a term encompassing social–environ-
mental factors, in the evaluation of complex interventions. 
Self-Help Plus, for instance, is a mental health intervention 
developed by the WHO for forced migrants in ‘low-resource 
humanitarian settings’ [26]. Accordingly, it was created with 
a consideration that many forced migrants live in environ-
ments with limited access to healthcare, and precarious legal 
and housing situations. Self-Help Plus also underwent a pro-
cess of cultural adaptation [27], acknowledging the impor-
tance of social norms and beliefs in effective treatment.

This review, therefore, aims to identify, synthesise and 
appraise the evidence on the association of post-migration 
social–environmental factors with mental disorder in asylum 
seekers.

Method

Systematic  review,  following  the  Preferred  Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses check-
list and (a checklist is provided in Appendix A) registered 
with Prospero (CRD42017081915).

Search Strategy

Online  searches  were  in  EMBASE,  MEDLINE,  Social 
Policy and Practice, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Disser-
tations and Global Theses, PTSD Publications, Cochrane 
Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature,  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  Health  Sci-
ences Literature and the Danish Institute Against Torture 
database. Grey literature databases OpenGrey and Global 
Health were also searched, as were the websites of several 
non-profit organisations (see Appendix B). Five experts 
provided suggestions on studies to include. We conducted 
forward and backward citation tracking for included stud-
ies after full-text screening.

Keyword and medical subject heading searches were 
conducted from 1 January 1967 to 19 July 2019. January 
1967 was chosen as it was the date the UN Protocol Relat-
ing to the Status of Refugees was signed. This protocol 
extended refugee status to those affected by events outside 
of Europe. The search terms combined terms for mental 
disorders with terms for asylum seeking statuses [e.g. (exp 
PTSD/or “post-traumatic stress disorder” or PTSD) and 
(exp refugees/or asylum$ or refugee$ or migrant$)]. Full 
search terms are listed in Appendix B.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies  in  any  language  working  with  asylum  seekers 
over 18 years old were included. Studies with mixed sam-
ples where over 75% were asylum seekers were included. 
Research including only refugees or internally displaced 
people was excluded. Studies with populations living in 
detention, restricted reception centres and refugee camps 
were excluded. Such extreme living conditions may con-
found the relationship between asylum status and mental 
disorder, and are not representative of long-term post-
migration living conditions. Studies also had to meas-
ure one or more mental disorders using either validated

diagnostic or screening tools and to measure one or more 
social–environmental factor.

Screening and Extraction

A two-stage screening process was used where title and 
abstract screening was followed by full-text screening. 
Two-hundred and fifty studies were independently sub-
ject to title and abstract screening by two researchers. 
There were 23 discrepancies (i.e. < 10%) which were dis-
cussed and resolved; the primary issue was uncertainty 
over whether a study included asylum seekers or refugees.
Information on study design, demographics, outcome 
measures,  and  results  was  extracted.  Where  data  was 
missing or not disaggregated, authors were contacted. 
The Newcastle–Ottawa Assessment Scale [28] assessed 

quality  for  case–control  and  cohort  studies,  and  an 
adapted version [29] was used for cross-sectional stud-
ies. We adapted the scale for use in the forced migration 
context (see Appendix C).

Analysis

Analysis included description of study and population char-
acteristics, calculation of odds ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (if raw numbers were available). Narrative syn-
thesis first sorted study variables into 24 common factors. 
Factors were then placed into conceptually coherent themes 
based  on  the  International  Organisation  for  Migration’s 
[30] social determinants of migrant health, an adaption of a 
World Health Organisation 2008 model [31]. Synthesis then 
followed the stages described by Popay et al. [32]: ‘devel-
oping a preliminary synthesis’—we organised the results 

1 31058

Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health (2020) 22:1055–1064

in tables to identify patterns, ‘exploring relationships in 
the data’—we considered the role of study heterogeneity 
in emerging patterns, and ‘assessing the robustness of the 
synthesis product’—we evaluated the strength of evidence 
for each pattern. Synthesis was conducted for factors with 
six or more separate studies, and for studies reporting overall 
post-migration stress.

Results

We identified 7004 unique references (Fig. 1). After title and 
abstract screening, 297 papers remained for full-text screen-
ing, 49 of which were eligible (Appendix D). Of these, the 
required data could only be extracted from 11. After data 
requests, a further 10 studies were included to make 21 total.
The number of adult asylum seekers in studies totalled 
2402  (Table  1),  with  1679  men  and  856  women,  and  a 
median age of 34 (n = 15). Sudan and Iraq were the most 
common nationalities (Fig. 2). Research primarily occurred 
in high-income countries with majority white populations, 
with the USA (19% of studies) and Australia (19%) most fre-
quent. 71% of studies were cross-sectional (29% prospective 
cohort) and 59% used convenience sampling. PTSD was the 
most commonly assessed outcome (90% of studies) followed 
by depression (86%) and anxiety (48%). Median prevalence 
for depression (n = 9) was 68% (IQR 50%, 85%), for anxiety 
(n = 6) 48% (IQR 46%, 61%), and PTSD (n = 10) 39% (IQR 
36%, 51%).

Studies  measured  24  social–environmental  factors 
which we grouped into seven domains: working conditions, 
social networks, economic class, living conditions, health-
care, community and identity, and the immigration system 
(Fig. 3). The most frequently used risk factor tool was the 
Post-Migration Living Difficulties Questionnaire (PMLD, 
10 studies), developed by Silove et al. [15].

Immigration system was the most examined category (18 
studies), including the largest variety of factor types (5). 
Social networks received the least attention (8 studies) and 
had the fewest factor types (2). Although all studies focussed 
on mental health, access to counselling was only reported 
by two studies [15, 41]. Items in this theme were limited, 
seldom considering the impact of culture and language on 
healthcare quality.

Factors were typically broadly defined. In examining the 
asylum interview, several papers [15, 20, 49] asked whether 
‘interviews by immigration officials’ were a source of stress. 
However, this could include immigration officers at the bor-
der, interviewers in an asylum interview or tribunal judges 
in court. Schock et al. [45] provided the exception, focussing 
on the asylum interview, breaking it down different potential 
sources of stress: ‘perceived justice of the hearing’, ‘tes-
timony stress’ and ‘delay stress’. Similarly, some factors 

combined potentially separate risk factors into one. Loneli-
ness and boredom was created as a factor group because 
studies often grouped them [20, 35, 41].

Three studies [40, 44, 51] provided strong evidence that 
discrimination is associated with higher rates of mental dis-
order and four [15, 20, 35, 41] found weak evidence of an 
association. The former set had larger samples and used sev-
eral questions to arrive at a discrimination score, contrasting 
with the single item discrimination statement used in the 
other studies.

In their study with 294 Iraqi asylum seekers, Laban et al. 
[40] found a strong association between increased levels of 
discrimination and increased depression, anxiety and soma-
toform disorder (p =  < 0.01 for all results). In their multi-
variate analysis, Wong et al. [51] found a small association 
between everyday discrimination and depression (OR = 1.2, 
95% CI 1.10–1.24) among a sample of 374 African asylum 
seekers in Hong Kong. Ryan et al. [44] worked with 162 
people from 38 different countries, finding that discrimina-
tion was positively associated with distress in their multiple 
regression (β = 0.29, p < 0.001).

The  four  other  studies  generally  found  no  associa-
tion between discrimination and mental disorders in their 
analyses. Silove et al. [15] did, however, find an associa-
tion between discrimination and increased PTSD (95% CI 
4.52–22.50),  Morgan  et  al.  [41]  with  decreased  anxiety 
(r =  − 0.36, p = 0.02), Nickerson et al. [20] with increased 
depression (OR = 5, 95% CI 4.54–49.44) and Hecker et al. 
[35] with complex PTSD (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 3.16–17.6). 
Confidence intervals in all studies were broad due to small 
sample sizes, while results were not part of a multivariate 
model accounting for confounders.

Two studies [37, 43] found evidence for an association 
between unemployment and mental disorder, with five [33, 
34,  39,  41,  47] finding no evidence. In their study with 
90 asylum seekers in Israel, Nakash et al. [43] found that 
unemployment was associated with higher rates of depres-
sion (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.04–5.09). Hocking et al. [37] also 
found an association between depression and unemployment 
(OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.02–4.56) in their study with 115 peo-
ple seeking asylum in Australia.

Morgan et al. [41] found no evidence of a relationship 
between ‘not being able to find work’, a proxy for unem-
ployment,  and  anxiety  (r = 0.21,  p = 0.182),  depression 
(r = 0.035,  p = 0.826)  or  PTSD  (r =  − 0.106,  p = 0.504). 
Eisen [34] found no evidence of an association between 
unemployment and PTSD (β =  − 0.029, p = 0.766) or depres-
sion (β =  − 0.036; p = 0.712), a pattern repeated for Sohn 
[47] with depression (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.21–6.61) and 
PTSD (OR = 1.821, 95% CI 0.34–9.91), Kashyap et al. [39] 
for depression (β =  − 0.1; p = 0.28) and PTSD (β =  − 0.06; 
p = 0.51), and Boersma [33] for depression (r =  − 0.033, 
p = 3.61) and somatization (r =  − 0.04, p =  − 0.336). Results

Ryan et al.’s [44] principal component analysis (PCA) 
identified three groups of post-migration living difficulties; 
higher scores in each were associated with increased rates of 
distress: basic living difficulties (r = 0.56 p = 0.000), asylum 
stress (ρ = 0.27 p = 0.001) and family separation (r = 0.02, 
p = 0.005). Laban et al.’s [40] factor analysis created the 
similar categories: family issues, the asylum procedure, 
socioeconomic living conditions and discrimination, and 
socioreligious living conditions. Increases in category scores 
associated with increases anxiety, depression and somato-
form disorder (p < 0.05 for all categories). Steel et al.’s [49] 
PCA produced the themes: residency determination; threat 
to family; health care, welfare and asylum; adaptation dif-
ficulties and loss of culture and support. Results from the 
latter three were reported and higher scores were positively 
associated with posttraumatic symptoms (β = 0.24, 0.33 and 
0.27 respectively).

The categories developed through PCA and factor analy-
sis were not always conceptually coherent. In the paper from 
Steel et al. [49] ‘healthcare, welfare and asylum’ included 
elements as disparate as ‘poor access to emergency medi-
cal care’, ‘delays in processing your application’ and ‘little 
help with welfare from charities’. In Ryan et al.’s [44] paper 
‘basic living difficulties’ encompassed ‘racism and discrimi-
nation’, ‘financial concerns’ and ‘dietary concerns’, and 
there was overlap with the ‘asylum stress’ category which 
included ‘work permission’.

Discussion

Our review identified 24 social–environmental risk factors 
for asylum seeker mental health from 21 papers and cat-
egorised them into 7 domains: working conditions, social 
networks, economic class, living conditions, healthcare, 
community  and  identity,  and  the  immigration  system. 
Most risk factors were examined by only a few studies, 
but synthesis of findings was possible for discrimination 
(community and identity), unemployment (working condi-
tions), and post-migration stress (encompassing multiple 
domains). Strengths of the review included its compre-
hensive approach and robust search strategy. However, 
despite requests to corresponding authors for assistance, 
data could not be extracted for a large proportion of eli-
gible papers. Consequently, work from research hubs in 
Australia  and  the  Netherlands  was  excluded,  and  sig-
nificant nationality groups such as Syrians and Afghans 
underrepresented.

Findings suggested a link between discrimination and 
mental disorder, though study setting and measurement 
approaches were heterogeneous. The larger studies, using 
more nuanced scales to investigate different facets of dis-
crimination,  more  consistently  reported  an  association 

Fig. 2   Top six asylum seeker countries of origin (n = 21 studies)

could be confounded because participants working without 
permission do not want to reveal this to researchers. Only 
Eisen [34] considered work authorisation, using an employ-
ment rating scale developed by the Advocates for Survivors 
of Torture and Trauma charity (cited in Eisen, p. 41).

Five studies [20, 40, 42, 44, 49] reported a score for gen-
eral post-migration living difficulties derived from some 
of the factors in Fig. 3. Four of these studies reported that 
post-migration problems are associated with increased odds 
of mental disorder—all aside from Muller et al. [42]. The 
majority (4 of 5 studies) used a measure derived from the 
23-item PMLD developed by Silove et al. [15]. Both Ryan 
et al. [44] and Nickerson et al. [20] used a condensed form 
of the checklist tailored to their study context (17 and 13 
items respectively).

Nickerson et al. [20] found that increases in migration 
living  difficulties  were  associated  with  higher  rates  of 
depression (total effects1 = 0.06, p =  < 0.001) and PTSD 
(total effects = 0.07, p =  < 0.001). Ryan et al. [44] similarly 
found that higher overall scores on their post-migration 
checklist was related to higher rates of distress (β = 0.44, 
p =  < 0.000). Though Muller et al. [42] did not conduct any 
statistical comparison, there appeared to be no difference in 
the number of migration-related stressors between Turkish 
people seeking asylum in Germany with PTSD and those 
without (5.25 stressors against 6, in a sample of 16 and 13 
respectively).

1  ‘Total effects are the sum of direct and indirect effects that connect 
a predictor to an outcome’ [61].

between discrimination and mental disorder. In compari-
son, the smaller studies used single-item measures. The 
seven studies examining this relationship were conducted 
in different countries and, largely, with different nation-
alities. Experience of discrimination may vary by setting 
and by asylum seeker nationality and ethnicity [52], it is 
not clear whether its impact on mental disorder also var-
ies. However, our findings reflect the broader literature on 
mental health and discrimination, including from large 
meta-analyses [53,  54] as well as findings from studies 
conducted with refugees [55].

In contrast with the wider mental health literature [17], 
findings from the seven studies assessing unemployment 
suggested only a weak positive association with mental dis-
order. However, the majority of studies investigating this 
association did not consider a potential confounder: working 
without authorisation, which may be common but not readily 
disclosed [56]. Those working without permission may be 
subject to additional stressors such as forced labour, unpaid 
wages  and  a  lack  of  institutional  recourse  [57].  Future 

studies could use scales that incorporate unauthorised work-
ing, such as the employment scale used by Eisen et al. [34].
There was good evidence suggesting that post-migration 
stress as a broad category is associated with higher rates of 
mental disorder, with four of the five studies investigating 
this finding evidence for an association. Our work reinforces 
recent appeals from academics to consider post-migration 
factors in greater depth [58]. Further research could explore 
domains within post-migration stress, such as living con-
ditions and healthcare in more detail. Factors relating to 
the asylum process were key components of all of general 
post-migration stress score measures. As a category readily 
changeable through government policy, this could form a 
focus for future research and advocacy. The broad cross-
cutting categories around post-migration developed through 
PCA were not always conceptually coherent. The categories 
developed in this review could provide a basis for grouping 
factors in future studies.

The  included  studies  examined  a  broad  range  of  risk 
factors, exemplified by the reliance on the Post-Migration

Living Difficulties checklist which uses single item ques-
tions for complex issues such as discrimination. Even in the 
domain with the greatest number of individual risk factors 
(the immigration system) risk factors were wide-ranging 
and ill-defined. Schock et al. [45] provide a useful model 
for future research by focussing on the substantive asylum 
interview and breaking down different potential sources of 
stress. Similarly, measurement of access to healthcare could 
have been improved by recognising the impact of culture and 
language on the quality of healthcare. Nellums et al. [59] 
have found, for example, that healthcare access for people 
seeking asylum was inhibited by the lack of translators or the 
use of inappropriate translators (friends and family, or male 
interpreters for women’s sexual health services).

Understanding  of  how  post-migration  environmental 
factors impact the mental health of people seeking asylum 
would be deepened if studies asked separate questions about 
related but distinct concepts. For example, while Morgan 
et al. [41] asked participants about ‘mistakes and delays in 
the application process’, Jannesari et al. [60] have reported 
that people seeking asylum have different experiences and 
reactions to delays as opposed to mistakes (particularly 
trivial ones with significant consequences). Similarly, while 
many  studies  combined  loneliness  and  boredom,  Ryan 
et al.’s [44] Post-Arrival Concern Checklist assessed them 
as separate concepts.

Our comprehensive search strategy, accepting papers 
from  all  languages,  looking  at  any  mental  disorder  and 
social–environmental risk factor, is a key strength of our 
review. As is the large range of databases and sources used 
to identify papers. A major limitation was the number of eli-
gible papers for which data could not be extracted (28 of 49).

Conclusion

It has long been established that people seeking asylum have 
a high prevalence of mental disorder compared to host and 
other migrant populations. This review begins to address 
why this might be. Findings suggest both discrimination 
and general post-migration stress are linked to an increased 
risk of mental disorder, with a possible protective role for 
employment. With anti-migrant rhetoric increasing in many 
places worldwide, discrimination and restrictions on the 
freedoms and entitlements of people seeking asylum could 
increase, with potentially negative consequences for mental 
health.

New Contribution to the Literature

This review considers why the prevalence of mental disorder 
is high among people seeking asylum compared to other 

migrants and refugees. It investigates the role of social–envi-
ronmental  risk  factors  in  the  post-migration  period.  No 
limits were placed on language, country, or type of mental 
disorder. We synthesise evidence on a vast array of risk fac-
tors (often using data initially unreported in papers) into 
seven risk domains: working conditions, social networks, 
economic class, living conditions, healthcare, community 
and identity, and the immigration system. Findings suggest 
that discrimination and post-migration stress are associated 
with an increased risk of mental disorder in people seeking 
asylum.

With anti-migrant rhetoric increasing in many places 
worldwide, discrimination against people seeking asylum 
could  increase,  with  potentially  negative  consequences 
for mental health. The reduction of discrimination should 
be considered when forming asylum policy. Several risk 
domains, including living conditions and healthcare, remain 
under-researched and should be explored in future work. We 
also recommend the use of more nuanced measures of dis-
crimination, employment and other risk factors to arrive at 
more meaningful findings.
