Abstract

INTRODUCTION: We examined the efficacy of a multidomain intervention in pre-

venting cognitive decline among Japanese older adults with mild cognitive impairment

(MCI).

METHODS: Participants aged 65-85 years with MCI were randomized into inter-

vention (management of vascular risk factors, exercise, nutritional counseling, and

cognitive training) and control groups. The primary outcome was changes in the

cognitive composite score over a period of 18 months.

RESULTS: Of 531 participants, 406 completed the trial. The between-group difference
in composite score changes was 0.047 (95% CI: −0.029 to 0.124). Secondary analyses

indicated positive impacts of interventions on several secondary health outcomes. The

interventions appeared to be particularly effective for individuals with high attendance
during exercise sessions and those with the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele and elevated

plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein levels.

DISCUSSION: The multidomain intervention showed no efficacy in preventing cog-

nitive decline. Further research on more efficient strategies and suitable target

populations is required.

activity monitor. During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)

pandemic, group-based physical exercise sessions were restricted in

accordance with the declaration of a state of emergency by the govern-

ment. Under such circumstances, online intervention programs were
provided for physical exercise.10

Individual nutritional counseling was offered by qualified health

consultants. Participants were scheduled to receive face-to-face coun-

seling (60 min per session) once and telephone counseling four times

over 6 months, for a total of three and 12 face-to-face and tele-

phone counseling sessions over the 18-month intervention period,

respectively. For the first 6 months, nutritional counseling focused on

improving lifestyle and dietary behavior. From the next 7-18 months,

nutritional counseling included guidance on dietary intake required

to improve cognitive and physical condition and guidance on chewing

and swallowing function and oral care. Moreover, participants were

instructed to maintain a well-balanced diet, increase dietary diversity,

and increase intakes of fish and seafood, milk and dairy products, fruits,
vegetables, and green tea.8

Participants were encouraged to engage in cognitive training
individually using the Brain HQ,8 which was customized for the J-

MINT trial. Over the 18-month intervention period, participants were

instructed to engage in intensive training lasting at least 30 min per day

for at least 4 days per week during the 4th to 6th, 10th to 12th, and

16th to 18th months (intensive training periods).

1. Systematic review: We conducted a search on PubMed

for randomized controlled trials investigating multido-

main interventions for preventing cognitive decline. The

efficacy of multidomain interventions is inconclusive. Fur-

ther studies are needed to develop effective preventive

strategies and verify target populations likely to respond

well to interventions.

2.

Interpretation: While the multidomain intervention did

not demonstrate overall efficacy in preventing cognitive

decline, subanalyses indicated that consistent adherence

to interventions yielded beneficial effects on cognitive

function and secondary health outcomes. Moreover, sub-

group analyses indicated that multidomain interventions

might be particularly advantageous for older adults with
the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele and elevated plasma glial

fibrillary acidic protein levels, although these findings

require validation in other studies.

3. Future directions: Our trial underscores the potential of

adequate adherence to multidomain intervention in pre-

venting cognitive decline. Further research is necessary

to identify more effective preventive strategies and tar-

get populations that are more responsive to multidomain

interventions.

Analysis set

The following four analysis sets were used in this trial: (1) the intention-

to-treat (ITT) analysis set, which included all subjects randomized

regardless of whether they received the intervention programs or

general health instruction; (2) the FAS, which included subjects who

received the intervention program or general health instruction at least

once and had at least one postbaseline neuropsychological assessment;

using the MMRM with the same covariates mentioned earlier, years of
education (≤9 vs >9 years), threshold of age- and education-adjusted
cognitive decline (1.0 to <1.5 SD vs ≥1.5 SD), presence of mem-

ory impairment (amnestic vs non-amnestic), APOE phenotype (APOE
ε4 carrier vs APOE ε4 non-carrier), and dementia-related plasma
biomarkers (amyloid beta [Aβ] composite biomarker, tau phosphory-

lated at threonine 181 [p-tau181], neurofilament light chain [NfL],
and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]). Aβ composite biomarker was

assessed using the immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assay at
Shimadzu Techno Research. Aβ composite values were computed by
combining normalized scores of Aβ precursor protein 669-711/Aβ 1-
42 and Aβ 1-40/Aβ 1-42 using a reported cutoff value of 0.376, as
suggested previously.17 Other biomarkers, such as p-tau181, NfL, and

patient rights were protected, the reported data were accurate, and

the execution of the trial was compliant with the approved protocol.

The monitor ensured that (1) written informed consent was obtained

from all participants before their participation in this trial, (2) primary

outcome data reported in the EDC were complete and accurate, and (3)

all serious adverse events were reported appropriately.

Participant characteristics

Between November 26, 2019 and December 28, 2020, 1677 partici-

pants were screened, among whom 531 were randomly assigned to the
multidomain intervention (n = 265) or control group (n = 266; Figure 1).

Eventually, 406 (76%) participants completed the neuropsychological

tests at the 18-month follow-up. Dropout rates were similar between

the intervention (59 participants, 22%) and control (66 participants,
25%) groups (p = 0.147). The FAS included 433 participants (82% of

all randomized participants) after excluding 81 participants who with-

drew immediately after randomization and 17 participants without

any postbaseline assessment of neuropsychological tests. The baseline

characteristics of the 433 participants included in the FAS were well

balanced (Table 1).

The individual mean number of exercise session attendance was
64.9 ± 15.8 out of 78 sessions (83%). Subanalysis based on attendance
rate of group-based physical exercise sessions (≥70%, <70%, and

exhibited a significant interventional effect compared to the non-

adherent intervention group (mean difference: 0.233; 95% CI 0.079
to 0.388; p = 0.003; Cohen’s d = 0.540) and control group (mean dif-
ference: 0.080; 95% CI 0.001 to 0.159; p = 0.047; Cohen’s d = 0.160)

(Table S6 and Figure 2B). Analyses of secondary outcomes showed sig-

body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass), physical performance

(gait speed and five times sit-to-stand test), and incident physical frailty

between the adherent intervention and control groups (Tables S7 and

DISCUSSION

The J-MINT is the first trial to examine the efficacy of a multidomain

intervention for over 18 months in preventing cognitive decline among

Japanese older adults with MCI. Despite facing challenges posed by

the COVID-19 pandemic, J-MINT successfully completed the trial.

Nevertheless, the multidomain intervention did not demonstrate sig-

nificant efficacy in preventing cognitive decline in individuals with MCI.

Several trials have been conducted on multidomain interventions
in the past decade, but their results have varied.18 In the current

study, multidomain interventions did not show significant efficacy in

preventing cognitive decline, whereas positive effects on a wide range

of secondary health outcomes were observed. Additionally, main-
taining adequate adherence to physical exercise sessions (≥70%) and

cognitive training led to significant improvements in cognition. Our

findings align with the results of the recent FINGER trial, indicating that

high adherence to a multidomain intervention program can improve
cognition across all domains.19 However, it is important to interpret

effect sizes of multidomain interventions may have been character-

study period,7 their societal impact could be substantial over the long

term. Further long-term studies examining the societal implications of

multidomain interventions would be warranted. In the memory clinic

interventions, albeit less intensive, including the management of vascu-

lar risk factors and general health-related information every 2 months.

This study design may have posed challenges in detecting a signifi-

cant effect of multidomain interventions. Finally, as our trial focused on

Japanese older adults with MCI, the generalizability of our findings to

other populations may be limited.

In conclusion, the J-MINT did not reveal significant efficacy of mul-

tidomain intervention in preventing cognitive decline. Nevertheless,

the multidomain intervention exhibited effectiveness across a broad

spectrum of secondary health outcomes. Subanalyses indicated that

consistent adherence to multidomain interventions could potentially

prevent cognitive decline. Moreover, findings from the J-MINT sug-

gest that multidomain interventions for 18 months may hold particular

value for older adults with elevated GFAP levels and those carrying
the APOE ε4 allele, although confirmation of these findings is war-

ranted through additional studies. Further research is necessary to

identify more effective preventive strategies and target populations

that exhibit greater responsiveness to multidomain interventions.
