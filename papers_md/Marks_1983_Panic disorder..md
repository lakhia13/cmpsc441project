Drs Hockings and Ballinger, cause daytime
dopiness and impaired judgment. Very short
acting hypnotics should now be distinguished
and their potential problems recognised. If
the doctor feels impelled to
a
hypnotic then he must strike a balance, and at
present the best choice would appear to be a
benzodiazepine with an elimination half life
of around 10 hours (it may take longer in the
elderly): long enough to sustain sleep without
leading to appreciable daytime dopiness, yet
leaving sufficient in the tissues to prevent
withdrawal phenomena pending any next dose,
or at least to moderate withdrawal features by
avoiding a precipitous fall in tissue con-
centrations.

SIR,-Dr N Hocking and Dr Brian R Ballinger
(18 June, p 1949) seem to equate elimination
half life with duration of effect when con-
sidering hangover effects of benzodiazepines.
The duration of action of lorazepam (t, = 13 h)
is, however, three to four times greater than
that of an equivalent dose of diazepam (t I =
20 to 50 h).1

The pharmacokinetic profile of a drug does
not necessarily predict the pharmacodynamic
profile. Indeed, with the benzodiazepines both
receptor binding affinity
(or receptor oc-
cupancy) and the effective concentrations of
drug in a pharmacologically relevant body
compartment are more important than elimina-
tion half life in determining duration of action.
It seems inappropriate for a review article to
so simplify the pharmacological considerations
as to lead to incorrect conclusions.

SIR,-I agree that Professor Oswald's observa-
tion of an apparent increase in daytime anxiety
during prolonged treatment with the short
acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, is important,
both clinically and theoretically, but after
some debate we left it out of our review. Now
that it has been confirmed by another group
of workers, we will include it in our paper

triazolam is the only benzodiazepine in which
this effect has been shown to occur, I think
that

suggested is unnecessary and would stand by

of triazolam is that, at the doses used in
Britain, concentrations in body fluids are so
low that measurement of anything beyond the

differences

Dr Nutley quotes verbatim from Dundee's
paper that the duration of action of lorazepam
is three to four times greater than that of
diazepam, but he does not point out that this
is the duration of the amnesic effect of the
drugs and almost certainly
relates to the
rate of entry of the drugs into the brain. These
effects were observed for 90 minutes after oral
administration, thus confirming Dr Nutley's

One of the important messages of our
paper was that in choosing a benzodiazepine
the duration of action is the predominant
factor and that care should be taken when
attempting to

have done this is in the ranking of drugs
marketed as hypnotics. We believed that this
was useful, so that if hangover effects were
observed a more rapidly eliminated drug
could be chosen. Conversely, if the withdrawal

noted clinically a longer acting hypnotic may
be indicated.

SIR,-YOur leading article on panic disorder
(30 April, p 1376) and subsequent corres-
pondence (4 June, p 1818; 28 May, p 1750)
ignore a critical issue in management. The
chief (and eminently treatable) handicap in
most "panic" disorder is in fact not the panic
itself but avoidance of situations that trigger
panic. This leads sufferers to avoid public
streets, and public
situations
transport, resulting in many becoming house-
bound, placing a considerable burden on them-
selves and their families. When such avoidance
is prominent the syndrome is usually called
and
agoraphobia;
economically treated by exposure in vivo, a
method by which the patient is encouraged to
re-enter repeatedly the feared situations and
stay there until the panic subsides. Often the
patient can treat himself with the aid of a few
instructions from the therapist. In a recently
completed controlled trial' phobics (mainly
agoraphobics with panic attacks) improved
substantially and equally
six months'
follow up whether the exposure instructions
were obtained from a self help manual,2 from
interacting with a computer programmed with
that manual, or from a psychiatrist. Sufferers
can often easily complete their own exposure
treatment with simple guidance from their
general practitioner on how to plan their
exposure homework programme and how to
keep a systematic diary of their exposure tasks

overcome their phobias, but it also reduces
their panics.3 Your leading article regrettably
implies that panic disorder should exclusively
be treated by antidepressants. In fact four
controlled studies found that imipramine and
phenelzine did not reduce the phobias of
agoraphobics with panics.3-5 Moreover, a
review of all the controlled studies so far
found that where antidepressants have had a
beneficial effect the subjects usually began
with depressed mood (not a diagnosis of
depression) and that the antidepressant drugs
improved not only panics but also depression
and phobias, these three phenomena being
closely interrelated.6 When imipramine was
given and exposure was prevented
then
imipramine reduced depression but not panic
or avoidance.5

such

treatments

There are no data to support your corres-
pondents' contention (4 June, p 1818) that
behavioural
exposure
would be of limited value in hyperventilating
patients with hypocapnia or the contention of
the leading article that behaviour therapy is
ineffective until the panic attacks stop. On the
contrary, improvement of agoraphobia after
exposure in vivo has usually endured for up
to nine years.7 Where panic has been specifically
measured, this too has improved, up to two
years' follow up."

Finally, careful epidemiological study has
found that many agoraphobics have no panic
attacks, that many patients with panics have
no avoidance, and that most of these anxiety
syndromes have a strong association with
depressive symptoms." We can thus conclude
that panic, avoidance, and depressed mood are
significantly
unitary
phenomena, that avoidance can be treated by
exposure treatment and depressed mood by
antidepressants, and that panic responds to
exposure and also to antidepressants when
mood is low.

Which is more dangerous-cycling or
flying?

SIR,-Dr John Ashton (11 June, p 1843)
stated that cyclists are 60 times more likely to
be killed than passengers on a scheduled air-
line. This may be the case per kilometre
travelled, but it can hardly be true per
journey.

British airlines carried out 2 272 000 stage
flights per fatal accident over the period
1976-81. A comparable figure for cyclists can
be reached thus: in 1981 5489 cyclists were
seriously injured or killed, and 557 cycles
