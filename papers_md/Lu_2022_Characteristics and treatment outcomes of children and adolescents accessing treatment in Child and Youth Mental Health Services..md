Abstract

Aim: To provide insight into the characteristics and treatment outcomes of children and

adolescents accessing outpatient Child and Youth Mental Health Services (CYMHS),

and to explore whether outcomes differ by age, sex, and ancestry background. This

information can guide how to optimize the treatment delivered at these services.

Methods: An observational retrospective study was performed based on data from

3098 children and adolescents between age 5 and 18 who received treatment at
Brisbane, Australia, community CYMHS between 2013–2018. Patient characteristics,

service use, and clinician and parent rated Routine Outcome Measures (ROM) were

extracted from electronic health records.

Results: Anxiety and mood disorders were the most common mental disorders (37%

and 19%). In 1315 children and adolescents (42%), two or more disorders were diag-

nosed, and the far majority (88%) had experienced at least one psychosocial stressor.

The ROM scores improved between start and end of treatment with Cohen's d effect
sizes of around 0.9. However, (cid:1)50% of the children still scored in the clinical range

at the end of treatment. Outcomes did not differ over gender and Indigenous status.

Conclusions: Children and adolescents accessing CYMHS have severe and complex

mental disorders as reflected by high rates of comorbidity, exposure to adverse cir-

cumstances and high symptom scores at the start of treatment. Despite the clinically

relevant and substantial improvement, end ROM scores indicated the presence of

residual symptoms. As this increases the risk for relapse, services should explore

ways to improve treatment to further reduce mental health symptoms.

in the electronic health record, 52% had one diagnosis, and 42% had

two or more diagnoses. The majority (89%) had at least one Z-code

diagnosis, indicating the exposure to psychosocial stressors, and 70%

even had two or more Z-code diagnoses.

After combining psychiatric diagnoses into several main groups

(see Appendix, Table A1 for the list of diagnoses included in each cat-

egory), anxiety disorders was the most common diagnostic group,

followed by mood, stress and adjustment disorders, developmental

disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (Table 2). The

prevalence rates of psychiatric diagnoses followed the well-known

gender and age patterns. Internalizing disorders were more prevalent

in girls and in children above 11 years of age, while ADHD and con-

duct disorders were more prevalent in males and developmental dis-

orders more prevalent in children below 12 years of age.

Regarding the Z-code diagnoses (Table 3), the majority of children

had problems related to primary support group, followed by a family

history of mental health disorders and problems related to negative

life events in childhood. There were many differences between gen-

der and age-groups in the prevalence of Z-codes with some issues

more prevalent in males than females or more prevalent in children
≤11 than >11 years, but also the other way around.

There were no significant differences between Non-Indigenous

and Indigenous children for both F- and Z-code diagnoses.

3.3

| ROM treatment outcomes

Completion rates for clinicians were higher than for parents: 10% of

parents completed the SDQ halfway treatment and 15% at the end of

treatment compared to 38% and 65% of clinicians who completed the

HoNOSCA. The start CGAS score corresponded to moderate impair-

ment and the parental SDQ score corresponded to very high impair-

ment (AMHOCN, 2003; Wagner et al., 2007). For all three measures,

average scores incrementally improved from start to middle to end

(Table 4). The overall effect sizes as expressed in Cohen's d varied
between 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–0.79) and 1.01 (95%
CI 0.94–1.08) from start to end for HoNOSCA, CGAS, and SDQ, with

improvement in both first and second halves of treatment (Table 5). In

males and Indigenous children some of the start scores were signifi-

cantly worse compared to females or non-Indigenous children but

there were no significant difference for end values (Figure 1a,b,c), or

for the duration of treatment and number of episodes.

Limitations

The most important limitation of this study is the low response rates

at the later time points, in particular for the parental rates, The rates

were comparable to an earlier study about the implementation of

ROM in Australia with high completion rates at the start, reasonable

clinician completion rates in the middle and the end, but fairly low

rates of parent completed SDQs in the middle and at the end

(Burgess et al., 2015). As children whose parents did complete the

end-SDQ had significantly better clinician reported end-ROM and

longer duration of treatment, there may be participation bias, that

influenced the parental outcomes. However, the consistency in the

patterns of the results in the parental versus the clinician scores sug-

gest that, although the parental end scores may be slightly inflated,

there is substantial

improvement over time. Another limitation is

that data on interrater-reliability were lacking as well as data on

number of appointments. The latter would be helpful in getting bet-

ter insight into the association between treatment intensity and

outcomes.
