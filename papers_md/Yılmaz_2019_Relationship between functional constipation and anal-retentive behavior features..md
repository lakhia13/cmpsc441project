ABSTRACT

Objective: Constipation is the most commonly seen defecation problem related to several environmental factors. Defecation is learned in the childhood 
anal period in which anal characteristic features appear. Problems in the childhood anal period may affect not only characters but also defecation func-
tion. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between constipation and anal characteristic features of participants with functional constipation.

Material and Methods: Patients with functional constipation were included into the study according to the ROME III criteria. Patients with irritable 
bowel disease, slow transit constipation, outlet obstruction constipation, malignancy, and psychiatric diseases were excluded from the study. Patients 
filled out Personality Belief Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Obsessive Belief Questionnaire. The results were compared with 
healthy individuals.

Results: A total of 47 patients with functional constipation were included in the study. Avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, antisocial, narcissistic, and para-
noid personality traits were found to be higher in patients with constipation than in the control group. Perfectionism/certainty, importance and control, 
and hospital anxiety scores were found to be higher in patients with constipation than in the control group.

Conclusion: Constipation may be related to several factors, such as socioeconomic environment, emotional stress, age, and diet, among others. Here, 
it was found that anal-retentive behavior features are prominent in functional constipation. Biofeedback, which can be regarded as psychotherapy of 
defecation control, can be used for treatment.

InTRODUCTIOn

Defecation  is  a  complex  mechanism  composed  of  sympathetic  and  parasympa-
thetic systems, sacral spinal cord reflexes, normal anorectal sensation, and volun-
tary control of the external sphincters (1). Impairments of this process are called 
defecation disorders and generally associated with constipation. The term “Func-
tional  Defecation  Disorders  (FDDs)”  has  been  preferred  to  describe  constipation 
associated with anorectal dysfunction, according to recent consensus (ROME III) (2). 
Constipation is the etiology of most benign anorectal diseases, such as hemorrhoid 
and chronic anal fissure. Although anatomical and functional factors related with 
senility and sex have been addressed for etiology, constipation is also a common 
problem in children (3-5).

In addition to anatomical factors, psychological factors also play a role (6,7). Anal 
stage is defined as the period of controlling defecation in children. In this period, 
children learn how to hold their stool and defecate. Children understand the im-
portant part of defecation (i.e., voluntary control of the sphincter) during this pe-
riod. Defecation control is the interaction, communication, and exertion of power 
by children against their environment. Children experience several conflicts in this 
period. These conflicts may lead to anal-retentive personality, which includes will-
fulness, stinginess, excessive thoroughness, and excessive tidiness (7,8). Early toilet 
training, excessive parent-child conflict, irrational fears, and anxieties around toilet-
ing can also lead to constipation in children (9).

sion of the questionnaire were performed by Taymur et al. (11).

MATERIAl and METhODs

 hospital Anxiety and Depression scale

This  retrospective  descriptive  study  was  performed  at  the  De-
partment of General Surgery, Kocaeli University. The local ethics 
committee of Kocaeli University (KOÜKAEK 2015/49) approved 
the  study.  Inclusion  criteria  to  the  study  was  being  diagnosed 
with FDD according to the ROME III criteria at the Department of 
Gastroenterology and referred to the general surgery outpatient 
clinic between February 2015 and March 2016 (2,10). Gastroen-
terology reports were reviewed to ascertain whether or not pa-
tients had been evaluated by anal manometry and colon transit 
time measurement in order to rule out slow transit constipation 
and  outlet  dysfunction.  Patients  who  had  previously  known 
psychiatric, oncologic, inflammatory, and neurological diseases 
were excluded from the study. Patients admitted to the general 
surgery outpatient department were examined for hemorrhoid 
or anal fissure related with constipation. Chronic anal fissure is 
diagnosed  as  fissure  in  the  anal  canal  present  for  ≥  3  months 
and is indurated, fibrotic, has anal skin tags, and is located in the 
midline. Patients who had previously undergone surgical treat-
ment for hemorrhoids or anal fissure were not included in the 
study. Patients with constipation were divided into two groups: 
those  with  (i.e.,  constipation  with  disease)  and  those  without 
benign anorectal disease (i.e., constipation without disease). The 
control group was composed of healthy individuals with no pre-
vious gastrointestinal or psychiatric diseases. Demographic data 
included age, sex, body weight, and height. Informed consent 
was obtained from all of the participants of the study.

Personality Belief Questionnaire-short Form

Personality  Belief  Questionnaire-Short  Form  (PBQ-SF;  Turkish 
version)  is  composed  of  questions  that  query    an  individual’s 
basic  beliefs  about  himself,  other  people,  and  the  world  (10). 
In  its  initial  configuration,  PBQ  has  several  questions  assessing 
each  personality  disorder  found  in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (i.e., avoidant, dependent, 
passive-aggressive,  obsessive-compulsive,  antisocial,  narcissis-
tic, histrionic, paranoid, schizoid/schizotypal, and borderline). In 
each question, participants scored the statement from 0 to 4 ac-

Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) is composed of 14 ques-
tions  that  evaluate  depression  and  anxiety  of  the  participant. 
The aim of the scale is not to diagnose but instead to define the 
risk groups for anxiety and depression. HAD was developed by 
Zigmoid et al., and the validity and reliability were evaluated (12). 
Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the questionnaire 
were performed by Aydemir (13).

Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire

Obsessive  Beliefs  Questionnaire  (OBQ)  was  developed  by  the 
Obsessive-Compulsive  Cognitions Working  Group  and  is  com-
posed of 44 questions scored on a 7-point Likert scale (14). The 
subgroups  of  OBQ  include  Responsibility/Threat  Estimation, 
Perfectionism/Certainty, and Importance and Control Thoughts. 
Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the questionnaire 
were performed by Boysan et al. (15).

statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Pack-
age  for  the  Social  Sciences  version  17.0  (SPSS;  IBM  Corp.,  CA, 
USA). A p-value < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. 
Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Distribution of parametric 
data was evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical data 
of  the  three  groups  with  normal  distribution  were  compared 
with  the  ANOVA  post  hoc  Tukey  test.  Kruskal-Wallis  test  was 
used for the comparison of data with non-normal distribution. 
Categorical comparison was performed by Chi-square test. Sub-
group comparisons of OBQ were performed by Mann-Whitney 
U test.

REsUlTs

During a 12-month period, a total of 47 patients with FDD were 
included into the study. A total of 23 individuals were included 
into  the  study  as  the  control  group. Table  1  shows  the  demo-
graphic  results.  There  is  no  statistical  difference  between  the 
groups by age, sex, weight, and height.

Table 2 shows OBQ and HAD scale results. There is no statistical

DIsCUssIOn

Our study showed that anal-retentive characteristic features relat-
ed to the period of defecation control are significantly higher in 
patients with constipation than in healthy people. Constipation 
is  one  of  the  most  common  gastrointestinal  disorders  seen  by 
gastroenterologists and primary care physicians. The prevalence 
of the disease in adults older than 60 years of age is 33%, whereas 
the overall prevalence among adults of all ages is approximately 
16% (16). Constipation reduces quality of life and poses a large 
economic burden, with more than $820 million spent on laxa-
tives per year (17). Chronic constipation is defined as infrequent 
bowel movements and myriad symptoms (hard stool, straining, 
feeling of incomplete evacuation, sensation of fecal obstruction, 
and digitation for defecation) with less than three bowel move-
ments per week for at least 3 of the prior 12 months. FDD includes 
primary constipation and has different features than slow transit 
constipation and obstructed constipation. In our study, FDD-re-
lated  constipation  is  diagnosed  using  the  ROME  III  criteria  and 
excludes outlet dysfunction and slow transit constipation (10).

Our  study  showed  that  patients  with  constipation  have  much 
more  anal-retentive  behavior  features  than  healthy  subjects. 
Anal-retentive behavior features are developed during the anal 
stage of children between the ages of 1 and 3 years (18). Anal-re-
tentive personality has an excessive amount of libido fixated on 
the pleasures discovered during the period of toilet training. Con-
trol of defecation is a kind of libido that leads to anal-retentive 
personality during the time when superego is formed (18). Freud 
suggested that children in the anal stage of development regard 
the  release  of  their  feces  as  a  gift  to  the  parent-a  gift  that  can 
be  given  or  withheld. Toilet  withholding  is  the  most  common 
response seen in that period. Anal-retentive children hold their 
feces in a miserly fashion, releasing waste only when strongly en-
couraged or rewarded (19). These characteristics are supposedly 
present  in  anally  fixated  adults  who  demand  that  others  offer 
them devotion and sacrifice. Anal-retentive adults hoard love and 
affection while commonly withholding their own affection from 
others. Another type of an anal-retentive person is an individu-
al who seeks to obsessively control his or her environment and 
the people in his or her life, often by being stingy or miserly (19). 
Fixation at this stage can lead to a highly moralistic and overly 
controlled personality style.

It  has  been  reported  that  voluntary  holding  in  healthy  people 
can remarkably delay defecation and, at the same time, slow tran-
sit through the ascending colon and rectosigmoid tract (20). This 
type of mechanism often produces constipation in children and 
can continue into adulthood as an acquired illness behavior (21). 
One-third of patients with functional constipation had reported 
constipation  since  childhood,  whereas  others  developed  con-
stipation during adulthood (22). The onset of symptoms during 
childhood suggests that at least one-third of patients with func-

tional constipation may have never learned the art of proper def-
ecation or acquired faulty habits during toilet training (23). Early 
toilet training, excessive parent-child conflict, and irrational fears 
during  the  anal  stage  may  result  in  functional  constipation  (9). 
In  addition  to  these  withholding  features,  psychosocial  experi-
ences, physiological functioning, or susceptibility to developing 
a functional gastrointestinal disorder, including functional consti-
pation, is seen (24). It has been shown that physiological stress, 
anxiety,  socioenvironmental  factors,  and  genetic  predisposition 
may also contribute to the development of constipation (24,25). 
Psychological distress is associated with pelvic floor tension and 
increased extrinsic nerve supply and rectal mucosal blood flow 
to the gut (26). The mechanism in emotional stress and constipa-
tion result in the alteration of bowel habits via the brain-gut axis.

The prevalence of obsessive beliefs, such as Perfectionism/Cer-
tainty  and  Importance  and  Control  Thoughts,  in  patients  with 
constipation is significantly higher than that in healthy controls. 
Anxiety  about  making  a  mistake,  precise  and  excessive  desire 
to finish a task, strict and inflexible attitudes toward beliefs, and 
uncomfortable feelings about uncertain events are higher in pa-
tients with constipation. Higher rates of obsessive beliefs in pa-
tients with constipation demonstrate that these patients attach 
importance to compulsive thoughts, and that they need much 
more control for these thoughts (11). The desire to maintain con-
trol is a coping mechanism for individuals, and uncontrolled life 
events are predictive of psychological stress (24). Previous stud-
ies have shown a high prevalence of emotional distress includ-
ing anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction in patients with 
functional constipation (24). In the present study, we did not only 
show  high  anxiety  and  social  dysfunction  rates  but  also  found 
that other personality disorders are associated with anal charac-
teristic features. It has been shown that stress may act via the en-
teric nervous system to inhibit colonic motility and thus prolong 
colonic transit (24). However, in our study, we included patients 
with normal transit time.

The Personality Belief Scale was prepared according to person-
ality  disorders  in  DSM  IV  (18).  Avoidant,  obsessive-compulsive, 
paranoid, antisocial, and narcissistic beliefs are more common in 
patients with constipation than in healthy subjects. The most sig-
nificant difference between the constipated and control groups 
was  obsessive  beliefs.  Obsessive  personality  features  overlap 
with anal characteristic features. Individuals with anal character-
istic features are rigorous, prim, perfectionist, extremely niggling, 
and dislike uncertainty. There is limited information about obses-
sive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality 
disorder  among  patients  with  constipation.  Thus,  we  thought 
that the subject was worth investigating. The present study also 
found that paranoid personality including skeptical and insecure 
features and thoughts about the control of other people and the 
desire to find secret meanings in events was much more com-

mon  in  patients  with  constipation  with  diseases.  Furthermore, 
antisocial  personality  (including  difficulty  coping  with  societal 
rules  and  undeveloped  superego)  and  narcissistic  personality 
(including exaggerated appraisal of one’s personal features) were 
much more common in patients with constipation with diseas-
es. However, only obsessive-compulsive personality beliefs were 
significantly higher in both patients with constipation with and 
without disease. This shows that obsessive-compulsive features 
are  important  parts  of  anal-retentive  behavior  features.  On  the 
other hand, some features are more prominent in patients with 
constipation and disease than in patients with constipation only, 
which may be due to the severity of anal-retentive behavior fea-
tures. Unfortunately, the limitation of the present study was that 
it  was  unable  to  describe  the  relationship  between  the  severi-
ty of the disease and the anal-retentive behavior features. Anal 
characteristic features are not the disease to be treated, but when 
personality  disorders  are  observed,  first  line  of  therapy  may  be 
psychotherapy.

Biofeedback  is  a  learning  strategy  derived  from  psycholog-
ical  learning  theory  (27). The  basis  of  the  use  of  this  treatment 
is feedback signals from various autonomic systems that shape 
the behavior of the organ in a desired direction. Biofeedback is 
used for several gastrointestinal diseases including constipation, 
incontinence,  and  gastric  motility,  among  others.  Biofeedback 
treatment in constipation is much more effective for improving 
muscle  coordination  control  than  for  treating  slow  transit  time 
constipation (27). Taken together, biofeedback can be regarded 
as a kind of psychotherapy for defecation control. Patients with 
functional constipation and anal characteristic features may ben-
efit from both biofeedback and psychotherapy.

COnClUsIOn

Anal-retentive behavior features are more prominent in patients 
with  constipation.  Anal-retentive  behavior  features  are  devel-
oped during the anal period in which defecation is learned, and 
there might be a relationship between these two entities. Bio-
feedback treatment is one of the modalities for both anal-reten-
tive behavior features and functional constipation.

ÖZET

Giriş ve Amaç: Kabızlık çok sık görülen bir defekasyon problemi olup çeşitli çevresel faktörlerle ilişkilidir. Defekasyon, anal dönem kişilik bulgula-
rının oluştuğu çocukluk anal dönemde görülür. Çocukluk anal dönemdeki problemler sadece kişilik özelliklerini değil defekasyon fonksiyonlarını 
da etkileyebilir. Bu çalışmada fonksiyonel kabızlığı olan hastalarda kabızlık ve anal kişilik bozukluğu arasındaki ilişki incelenmesi amaçlanmıştır. 

Gereç ve Yöntem:  Çalışmaya  ROME  III  kriterlerine  göre  fonksiyonel  kabızlığı  olan  hastalar  dahil  edildi.  İrritabl  bağırsak  hastalığı,  yavaş  geçişli 
konstipasyonu, çıkış obstrüksiyonu olan, malignitesi olan, psikiyatrik hastalığı olan hastalar çalışma dışı bırakıldı. Hastalar kişilik inanç, hastane 
anksiyete, depresyon ve obsesif inanç anketi doldurdu. Konstipe hastalar benign anorektal hastalığı olan ve olmayan olarak iki gruba ayrıldı. Elde 
edilen bulgular sağlıklı gönüllülerle karşılaştırıldı.

Bulgular: Fonksiyonel kabızlığı olan 47 hasta çalışmaya dahil edilmiştir. Çekingen, obsesif kompulsif, antisosyal, narsist, paranoid kişilik inançları 
kabız ve hastalıklı hastalarda kontrol grubuna göre daha fazla bulunmuştur. Mükemmelliyetçilik, önem, kontrol ve hastane anksiyetesi kabız ve 
hastalıklı grupta kontrol grubuna göre daha fazla bulunmuştur.

Sonuç: Kabızlık sosyoekonomik, duygusal stres, yaş ve diyet gibi çeşitli faktörlerden etkilenir. Bu çalışmada fonksiyonel kabızlığı olan hastalarda 
tutucu  anal  kişilik  özelliklerinin  daha  belirgin  olduğunu  bulduk.  Biofeedback  bir  çeşit  defekasyon  kontrol  psikoterapisi  olduğundan  tedavide 
kullanılabilir.

Anahtar Kelimeler: Kabızlık, anal, çocukluk, kişilik bozukluğu, biofeedback
