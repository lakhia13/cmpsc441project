Abstract
Review Question: What is the impact of Covid-19 upon the mental health and well-being of women during pregnancy and 
during the perinatal period? Inclusion criteria: empirical primary research; maternal mental health and wellbeing; perinatal 
period; Covid-19; English or Thai language; studies from December 2019-September 2021, updated March 2024. Exclusion 
criteria: secondary research, commentary, grey literature. Databases searched: CINAHL, Cochrane, JBI, Medline, PsycINFO, 
Clinical Key and Web of Science. Studies were assessed for bias using tools aligned with study design. A convergent integrated 
approach was taken whereby quantitative data was combined with qualitative data, synthesised simultaneously using Braun 
and Clarke Six Steps to Thematical Analysis and presented as narrative. Forty-two studies were included. Overall level of 
methodological quality of studies was 14 rated good, 28 fair. Overarching themes: “Impact” and “Emotional Impact.” Themes: 
demographic impact; mental health and socio-economic factors; obstetric factors; pre-morbidity; maternity service delivery; 
relationships;  fear  and  worry,  grief  and  loss.  Commonality  suggested  some  evidence  for  increased  risk  and  prevalence 
for perinatal mental illness to pre-pandemic levels. Risk factors: lack/perceived lack of social support; high-risk pregnancy, 
complex obstetric history; prior mental illness; maternity service delivery, quality and safety; fear and worry. Results confer 
perinatal mental illness prominent during the pandemic though many did not suggest prevalence higher than pre-pandemic 
levels, or directly associated. Several factors compound risk. A small number of protective factors are identified. The dynamic 
processes of risk and protection need to be understood within the specific context in which they operate. The authors 
received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article. The study was not registered.

Introduction

Following  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  declara-
tion in March 2020 of a global pandemic resulting from the 
novel  coronavirus  (Covid-19)  outbreak  which  lasted  until 
May 2023, varying restrictions were implemented globally.1 
Common features of the time included national lockdowns, 
social isolation, high morbidity and mortality and evidence 
of increased risk to individual and population mental health.2 
Likelihood of reduced availability and accessibility of pro-
tective  mental  health  resources,  disruptions  in  maternal 
health services3 and rising global rates of mental health, sug-
gest the impact upon mental health and wellbeing of perina-
tal women, their infants and families was, and is significant.
The perinatal period, the time from pregnancy up until the 
end of the first year after giving birth, brings increased vul-
nerability for women.4 Increased risk to mental illness, most 
commonly depression and anxiety, but also obsessive-com-
pulsive  disorders,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD), 
postpartum  psychosis  and  eating  disorders,  are  evidenced.5 
Estimates of anxiety and depression have suggested it affects 
1 in 10 women in high income countries,6,7 and 1 in 5 women 
in middle-and low-income countries.8 A systematic umbrella 
review more recently estimated that the global pooled preva-
lence  of  perinatal  depression  and  anxiety  has  significantly 
increased during Covid-19, affecting almost 1 in 3 women.9 
Systematic global estimates of prevalence and incidence of 
perinatal  mental  illness  are  poorly  established  though  all 
suggest  poor  perinatal  mental  health  significantly  impacts 
many  women’s  lives,  as  well  as  their  infants  and  family’s 
health.6,7

Negative  impacts  of  perinatal  mental  illness  include 
increased risk of maternal suicide, abortion, obstetric com-
plications,  including  intrauterine  growth  disorder  and  pre-
term  labour,  and  poor  birth  outcomes  such  as  low  infant 
weight,  difficulties  with  infant  feeding  and  poor  mother-
infant bonding which is associated with increased risks for 
child  behavioural,  emotional  and  cognitive  problems.5,10 
Risk  factors  associated  with  poor  perinatal  mental  health 
include: a history of mental illness,11 preterm infant, relation-
ship  issues  and  intimate  partner  violence,12  past  trauma,13 
social isolation, and economic pressures.14 Risk factors are 
higher for some individuals and communities with protective 
factors  being  restricted  or  absent,  creating  mental  health 
inequalities.15  Social  determinants,  such  as  unemployment, 
minority ethnic status, exposure to personal or institutional

racism,  social  economic  deprivation,  inadequate  housing16 
and stigma1 are associated with increased risk.

A systematic review and meta-analysis found protective 
factors  for  post  -natal  depression  to  be  skin-to  skin  care, 
breast feeding, healthy diet, multi vitamin, vitamin D, zinc 
supplementation,17  while  social  support,  particularly  from 
partner and friends is well recognised as being protective for 
perinatal mental health.18 Psychological wellbeing adopting 
a positive as opposed to a deficit approach, is increasingly 
recognised as a significant aspect of mental health.19,20 Social 
support, self-efficacy and preparedness have been identified 
as supporting the transition to motherhood, promoting psy-
chological wellbeing.21

Contributing  to  the  development  of  a  cohesive,  quality 
evidence base to understand the impact of Covid-19 on peri-
natal women’s mental health is of prime importance given its 
significance  for  a  smooth  transition  to  motherhood  and 
mother, infant and family health. A small number of system-
atic  reviews  on  perinatal  mental  health  in  the  context  of 
Covid-19 have been undertaken, predominantly focusing on 
prevalence  of  depression  and  anxiety  and  quantifiable  
outcomes.9,14,22-25 To our knowledge, no mixed methods sys-
tematic review has been undertaken and only one integrative 
review26 on prevalence and intensity of anxiety and depres-
sion, risk and protective factors within the first wave of the 
pandemic.  Our  mixed  methods  systematic  review  extends 
the breadth of mental health focus within an extended time-
frame  in  addition  to  examining  commonalities  and  differ-
ences of global impact of Covid-19 upon women’s perinatal 
mental health and wellbeing.

The aim of the study was to evidence the impact of Covid-
19 upon women’s mental health and wellbeing during preg-
nancy  and  the  perinatal  period.  The  study  adopted  the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta 
Analysis, 2020 guidelines.18 After an initial informal scoping 
review to confirm the topic focus, the review question was 
formulated using the PI(C)O framework.

The following question was asked: What is the impact of 
Covid-19 upon the mental health and well-being of women 
during pregnancy and during the perinatal period? Objectives 
were to:

••

••

identify  differences  and  commonality  of  Covid-19 
global impact upon perinatal women’s mental health
identify risk and protective factors for perinatal wom-
en’s mental health and wellbeing during a pandemic.

We  undertook  a  mixed-methods  systematic  review  (SR) 
defined as  combining both qualitative and quantitative find-
ings within a single SR to address overlapping or complemen-
tary  review  questions.  This  combines  the  strengths  of  both 
methodological approaches, allowing for greater depth of evi-
dence  and  potential  health  policy  and  clinical  application 
while also addressing the limitations of each methodological 
approach.27,28  Inclusion  criteria  were  empirical  primary 
research;  maternal  mental  health  and  wellbeing;  perinatal 
period;  Covid-19;  English  or  Thai  language;  studies  from 
December 2019 to September 2021, updated March 2024. The 
exclusion criteria were secondary research, commentary, and 
grey literature. Search terms are included in Table 1.

CINAHL, Cochrane, JBI, Medline, PsycINFO databases 
were  searched  by  the  UK  site;  Clinical  Key  and  Web  of 
Science were searched by the Thai site. Initial searches were 
undertaken in September 2021 and last updated March 2024. 
Limiters included Full Text, English or Thai, peer reviewed 
research  articles  and  human  subjects.  Expanders  were  to 
include equivalent subjects. Boolean operators were used to 
combine or amalgamate search terms.

One hundred twenty-three full-text references were exported 
to Rayyan software, a web-based application that enabled ini-
tial blind screening of the papers by title and abstract.29 This 
was undertaken independently by the 2 international sites. Two 
duplicates  were  removed  and  the  full  texts  of  the  remaining 
121  papers  were  reviewed  by  both  sites  where  insufficient 
detail was available to form a decision by title or abstract alone. 
Blinding was removed following completion of initial screen-
ing allowing for consideration of results, discussion between 
the 2 sites, and confirmation of included papers. A third-party 
reviewer was identified to provide moderation where a deci-
sion could not be reached. Full texts of the final selected papers 
were read to confirm they met the required criteria by 2 mem-
bers  from  each  site.  The  search  was  documented  using  the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analyses.30 Forty-two studies ultimately met the inclusion crite-
ria and were critically appraised.

A JBI Extraction tool31 was adapted to allow for a com-
prehensive extraction process aligned to the study’s aim and 
objectives.  The  tool  was  piloted  independently  by  the  2 
international sites undertaking a joint data extraction com-
parison exercise, with minor revision to the tool following 
discussion. Data extraction of included studies was under-
taken by 2 team members from each site and cross-checked 
before synthesis. Data synthesis tables included: Overview 
summary; risk and protective factors; social variables; sam-
ple  overview;  recommendations;  study  strengths  and 
weaknesses.

Studies  was  assessed  for  methodological  quality  using 
Critical  Appraisal  Skills  Programme  (CASP),32,33  Joanna 
Briggs  Institute  (JBI),34  Mixed  Methods  Appraisal  Tool 
(MMAT)35  and  CEBMa  Centre  for  Evidenced  -Based 
Management,36  appraisal  tools  aligned  to  study  design. 
Piloting of the tools was undertaken by both sites to ensure a 
consistent approach and check inter-rater reliability. Studies 
where  conflicting  answers  occurred  were  resolved  through 
reappraisal and discussion between the teams. An indepen-
dent arbitrator was used where agreement could not initially 
be obtained. Inclusion of studies meeting the set quality cri-
teria (an average of 70% positive attributes for each of the 
appraisal tools was collaboratively agreed.

A  convergent  integrated  approach  was  taken  in  which 
quantitative  data  was  combined  with  qualitative  data  and 
synthesised  simultaneously  using  Braun  and  Clarke37  Six 
Steps  to  Thematical Analysis.  Included  papers  were  coded 
and a code table developed. A tabulated word document was 
developed  to  display  the  codes,  initial  themes  and  final 
named  themes  which  would  then  be  presented  in  narrative 
form. The synthesis approach was considered appropriate as 
both  quantitative  and  qualitative  designs  had  ability  to 
answer the review question.27,31 Reporting bias was addressed 
through data extraction, with study and sample attrition tabu-
lated within a sample overview table. All studies were graded 
good, fair/acceptable, or weak to determine the level of qual-
ity of overall evidence.

Forty-two  studies  were  included  in  the  review  (See  

Figure 1).

Results

Seventy-nine  studies  were  excluded  as  either  non-primary 
empirical research, not Covid-related, where mothers of chil-
dren  outside  of  the  perinatal  period  were  the  focus,  or  the 
studies did not reach the agreed quality status.

Included  studies  were  comprised  of  38  quantitative,  2 
qualitative,  and  2  mixed-methods  studies.  Study  designs 
were predominantly surveys with 29 online, 7 face-to-face, 3 

mixed face-to-face and online, 2 mixed online and face-to-
face and 1 telephone interview; additionally, there were 32 
cross-sectional  studies,  2  cohort  studies,  2  multi-centre 
cross-sectional studies, 1 longitudinal and prospective study, 
1  retrospective  cohort  study,  2  qualitative  studies,  2  mixed 
methods  studies.  Studies  were  conducted  in  15  countries: 
United  States  of  America  (n = 11),  Turkey  (n = 7),  China 
(n = 5),  Italy  (n = 4),  Canada  (n = 3),  the  United  Kingdom 
(n = 2),  Poland  (n = 2), Australia  (n = 1), Australia  and  New

Zealand (n = 1), Portugal (n = 1), Spain (n = 1), Qatar (n = 1), 
Iran (n = 1), Israel (n = 1) and Ethiopia (n = 1). Sample size for 
studies adopting a quantitate approach ranged from 137.6038 
to 72 participants,39 with 10 studies between 1061 and 4451 
in  size. A  power  calculation  with  a  confidence  interval  of 
95% was achieved in 3 studies.40-42 Sample sizes of studies 
using a qualitative approach were 27 participants43 and 15.44
All studies but two, those adopting a qualitative design43,44 
stated use of a mental health and or risk assessment tool spe-
cific to the subject focus to assess risk, resilience, symptom-
ology and severity, or wellbeing and aspects of functioning 
or  development.  Covid  specific  risk  assessment  tools  were 
used  in  the  following  studies.45-49:  Of  these,  all  but  one: 
Sbrilli et al47 were validated tools.

Thirteen studies accounted for women’s employment sta-
tus, though not by occupation.40-42,47,50-58: Ten studies stated 
the sample included women with a pre-existing mental health 
condition, though specific numbers were not always identifi-
able.45,54,55,58-63:  Mental  health  conditions  included  depres-
sion,  Generalised Anxiety  Disorder,  anxiety  disorder,  Post 
Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD),  mood  disorder,  eating 
disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and parenting stress. 
Table 2 provides a summary of included studies.

Overall level of methodological quality of included stud-
ies was 14 studies rated good and 28 rated as fair. Quantitative 
designs  predominately  lacked  sample  representation  and 
lacked  consideration  of  statistical  power.  A  summary  of 
assessed study quality and rated overall level of evidence is 
available in the Supplemental File, Table S1. Author identi-
fied study weaknesses included limited generalisability due 
to  lack  of  sample  diversity,  particularly  absence  of  racial, 
educational and socio-economic diversity.

Data was synthesised into 2 overarching themes: “Impact” 
and  “Emotional  Impact,”  with  additional  synthesis  of  risk 
and protective factors, and commonality of features within a 
global  context.  Table  3  presents  the  overarching  themes, 
themes, and sub-themes.

Narrative of themes

Impact

Demographic  variables.  Demographic  variables  associated 
with increased incidence of depression in women were found 
in the following studies.39,42,63-66 Living in a high-risk infec-
tion area and/or with a primary level of education, increased 
risk for perinatal anxiety and insomnia.39 Women of colour63 
and  immigrant  women42  had  a  higher  risk  of  developing 
postpartum  depression  (PPD),  with  single  women  at 
increased risk of depressive symptoms.64 Two studies found 
younger age in women to be significant for predicting prena-
tal depression64,65 whereas a Turkish study found advanced 
age to be predictive.66 Higher educational attainment54,67 and 
being  married67  were  suggested  to  be  protective  of  mental 
health and resilience. Religion did not feature in any included 
studies.

Perceived differences: Mental health impact and socio-economic 
factors.  Socio economic variables impacting women’s peri-
natal  mental  health  were  identified  in  the  following  
studies.54,58,66-68  Employment,  income,  living  space  and 
social  support,  either  on  their  own  or  compound  factors 
were  prominent  in  impacting  mental  health,  either  to 
increase risk to mental ill health or to protect it . Perceived 
reasons accounting for these differences of impact are given 
by  authors.  Loss  of  employment  or  economic  insecurity 
during Covid-19 significantly negatively impacted perina-
tal women’s mental health; by increasing risk of depression 
and  anxiety,  and  symptomology66,68  or  increasing  stress.67 
In  contrast,  a  study  from  China58  found  pregnant  women, 
employed full time, of middle income and with appropriate 
living space had increased risk of developing mental health 
problems.  Concerns  for  threat  to  their  employment  given 
the economic fallout, and for infection, working full time 
outside  the  home,  it  is  suggested  may  account  for  this 
increased risk.

Lower  income  was  associated  with  higher  anxiety 
scores for pregnant women; financial strain was reported 
to  be  a  predictive  value  for  anxiety  and  depression.54,66 
Those with very low income, under 600 euros a month, or 
higher incomes over 3600 euros per month, however, were 
found  to  have  the  highest  resilience  scores54  Low  socio- 
economic status was also found to be protective of preg-
nant  women’s  mental  health,  with  a  decrease  in  mental 
health  symptoms  when  covid  restrictions  on  schools  and 
non-essential  business  occurred69  Lower  socio-economic 
status  is  suggested  to  cause  greater  resilience  at  times  of 
crisis  ,  with  possible  amelioration  of  problems  resulting 
from  lockdown  having  unexpected  positive  effects  upon 
mental health. Three studies found income had no signifi-
cant  negative  effect  upon  a  sample’s  mental  health42,52,70 
though the latter 2 study samples were reported to refer to 
mostly employed women.

A lack, or perceived lack of social support and social iso-
lation is suggested to have increased risk for depressive and/
or  anxiety  symptoms,  loneliness  and  stress,42,44,46,51,60,64,66,71 
including for those in unsafe romantic relationships.64 Loss 
of childcare, and household conflict increased stress,67 with 
relationship  status  and  level  of  perceived  security  signifi-
cantly correlated with experiencing depressive symptoms.64 
Disrupted routines and social lives were suggested to have 
contributed  to  negative  mental  health44  as  was  grief  from 
financial  loss.64  Good  perceived  social  support  protected 
mental health, reducing symptomology, repetitive thinking, 
and loneliness.51,65,66

Obstetric 
upon  perinatal  women’s 
health.  Obstetric factors identified as increasing risk to peri-
natal women’s mental health, were related to 3 areas: obstet-
ric history and risk, pregnancy/perinatal stage, and parity. An 
obstetric  history  of  previous  C  section54  having  received 
infertility treatment48 being underweight prior to pregnancy58 
or  having  a  high-risk  pregnancy48,63  was  found  to  increase

the risk of depression and/or anxiety and symptomology. A 
study from Qatar40 found highest GAD scores for women to 
be in the third trimester of pregnancy or the post-natal period 
while a Polish study48 found the highest pregnancy pandemic 
related stress levels for women occurred in the second and 
third  trimester.  Higher  levels  of  fear  and  anxiety  during 
childbirth, and those with less available support during preg-
nancy and postnatally, were found to have increased risk and 
severity of depression and anxiety.65 The longer duration of 
pregnancy occurring during the pandemic period negatively 
impacted  upon  wellbeing  scores.72  Primipara  women  had 
highest  rates  of  pregnancy  related  stress,48,54,58  and  higher 
risk of anxiety and depression.41,44,48,54 Conversely, a Cana-
dian study68 comparing anxiety and depressive symptoms by 
parity  revealed  no  differences  in  Edinburgh  Postnatal 
Depression Scale (EPDS) scores or anxiety scores across the 
groups. A planned home birth was protective against anxiety 
increase.67

Impact  of  pre-morbidity  upon  perinatal  women’s  health.  
A  history  of  mental  illness  or  chronic  physical  illness  was 

suggested in several studies to  increase the risk for mental 
illness. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia scores were found 
to be significantly higher in women with prior comorbid psy-
chotic  and  depressive  disorders,54,56,65  the  most  important 
factor correlating to high levels of psychopathology during 
“lockdown”  being  previous  diagnoses  of  anxiety  and/or 
depression.45,62 A Qatar study, in contrast, suggested rates of 
depression were not affected by previous mental health prob-
lems  or  pregnancy  complications.40 A  chronic  physical  ill-
ness before pregnancy increased the risk for mental illness in 
the perinatal period in one study.39

Impact  of  maternity  service  delivery  upon  women’s  perinatal 
mental health.  Changes to normal expected maternity service 
delivery,  concerns  regarding  adequacy  and  safety,  and  ser-
vice and birth satisfaction, were significant areas of service 
delivery  negatively  impacting  perinatal  women’s  mental 
health.  Changes  to  women’s  birth  plan,  and  the  postpone-
ment of prenatal care significantly increased the severity of 
women’s  depressive64,66  and  anxiety  symptomology.73  A 
change from face to face to virtual provision increased anxi-
ety levels for Turkish pregnant women73 while newly deliv-
ered mothers living in Canada in areas with the most severe 
lockdown  restrictions  experienced  reduced  health  visits 
which was associated with higher levels of depression.38

Concern for the adequacy and safety of maternity services 
was  associated  with  higher  levels  of  depression;  identified 
variables included: lack of pre-natal care74 fear of viral trans-
mission at hospital birth and women requesting elective cae-
sarean.75  Women  who  gave  birth  during  the  peak  of  the 
pandemic,  those  who  were  SARS-CoC-2  positive,  Black, 
and Latina women, had lower birth satisfaction and higher 
perceived  health  care  discrimination,  were  also  associated 
with  higher  depression  levels.52  Exposure  to  one  or  more 
incident  of  healthcare  discrimination  was  associated  with 
higher levels of post-partum stress and birth-related PTSD.52 
Being  able  to  contact  health  professionals  easily,  receiving 
online  or  telephone  support,  and  good  accessibility  to  ser-
vices were reported in one study to provide comfort to preg-
nant women.44

Impact upon relationships, family networks and perinatal mental 
health.  The impact of Covid-19 on mother and family rela-
tionships, social networks and mental health highlighted dif-
fering experiences. Positive impact was found from studies 
in  New  Zealand/Australia,72  Portugal59  and  Israel76  and 
included: increased opportunity for family bonding resulting 
in time together and less pressures,72 a renewed appreciation 
of  family  time,  increased  shared  parenting  responsibilities, 
and  time  with  partner59  and  increased  family  cohesiveness 
due to working from home, or not working.38 In contrast, a 
Canadian study found parents were disproportionately nega-
tively affected by lockdown restrictions, with decreased fam-
ily  support  contributing  to  lower  mental  health  for  those 
living in the highest restricted areas.38 Turkish pregnant and 

Pankaew et al 

11

post-natal women lost the traditional support of their moth-
ers  staying  with  them  which  increased  their  loneliness  and 
isolation.44 A reduction in mental health in an Australian and 
New Zealand study was found to be associated with lower 
levels of family functioning, increased perceived stress, and 
perinatal anxiety.72

Maternal  infant  bonding,  and  breast  feeding  were  nega-
tively  affected  by  the  pandemic.39,52,55,59,72,75  Prolonged 
mother/baby separation39 increased parenting stress.59 Higher 
acute stress response to childbirth55 lower birth satisfaction,52 
longer pregnancy duration during the pandemic72 and fear of 
transmission  through  breast  feeding75  were  associated  fac-
tors.  A  study  of  new  mothers  found  a  higher  acute  stress 
response to childbirth was associated with more child-birth-
related PTSD symptoms and more problems with maternal 
bonding  and  breast  feeding55  while  another52  study  found 
lower birth satisfaction to be associated with poor maternal 
infant  bonding  and  lower  exclusive  breast  feeding.52 
Canadian  Mothers  with  PPD,  seeking  and  receiving  treat-
ment  from  a  Psychosocial  intervention  consistently  main-
tained good relationships with their infants, being unaffected 
by Covid-19.61

Emotional Impact

Emotional impact emerged as an overarching theme with the 
following themes: fear and worry, grief and loss.

Fear and worry.  Covid specific fears were identified in sev-
eral studies.44,45,49,55,64,67,68,70,75 Women’s fear of the unknown; 
not  understanding  the  seriousness  of  the  situation,  fostered 
anxiety.44 Perceived threat to mother and baby’s life contrib-
uted to substantially elevated depression and anxiety symp-
toms;  rates  far  exceeding  expected  normal  depressive  and 
anxiety  rates  seen  in  pregnancy  as  well  as  experienced  by 
other groups of people during the pandemic.39,68 An Italian 
study found that while joy was the most prevalent emotion 
expressed by 63% of mothers before Covid-19 (n = 126), it 
reduced to 17% (n = 34) after the pandemic onset, with fear 
being most prevalent 49% (n = 98).45 Women in a USA study 
were  found  to  have  mixed  emotions  ranging  from  joy  and 
excitement,  to  anxiety,  worry  and  disappointment  at  the 
changing circumstances of the birth and post-partum period.64 
Fear and anxiety surrounding labour and delivery55,64,67,70,75 
and  of  viral  transmission  and  separation  from  new-born, 
were prominent fears.55,64,75

Grief and loss.  Pregnant women grieved for the loss of their 
employment  and  income55,64  and  changes  in  job  status 
because of the pandemic. An American study found women 
to hold a sense of loss for missing out on the joy of typical 
pregnancy and post-partum experience.64 Loss of social sup-
port from loved ones and restriction on visiting to meet the 
new infant contributed to feelings of sadness.44,64 In a Chi-
nese study, women infected at the start of the pandemic with 

the  virus  in  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  aborted  their 
babies, as did one-third of cases in the second trimester.39

Factors  which  contributed  to  managing  worry  and  loss 
included  exercise,  leisure  activities  and  use  of  outdoor 
space54,70 which were found to be protective of mental health, 
as was the ability to constantly adapt to the changing circum-
stances and adopt self-help strategies.43

the Supplemental File.

Recommendations  for  health  policy,  practice  and  future 

research included:

•• Greater  consideration  of  women’s  psychological  
and  emotional  support  needs  by  healthcare 
services.55,60,64,66,71,75

•• Early  detection  of  mental  illness  and  mental  health 

problems for perinatal women57,64,66,76

•• Consideration of the role of social media and online 
materials in providing social support to women41,70
•• Clinical  studies  on  effective  promotion  of  maternal/

infant bonding during a pandemic.59

•• Longitudinal studies to address acute and longer-term 
consequences  of  the  pandemic  on  maternal  mental 
health.46

Global commonality and differences.  There was some evidence 
of  commonality  of  impact  upon  mental  health  of  perinatal 
women across countries, despite the heterogeneity of focus, 
sample and methodologies. Most studies, both global north 
and south, highlighted the occurrence of poor perinatal men-
tal  health  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Several  studies 
stated increased risk and prevalence rates for mental illness, 
symptomology,  stress  levels  and  negative  emotions  com-
pared to pre pandemic actual or expected levels, suggesting a 
direct relationship between Covid-19 pandemic and perinatal 
women’s psychopathology.40,45,49,55,56,58,59,61,71 The most com-
monly  identified  risk  factor  impacting  perinatal  mental 
health by increasing risk for depressive and/or anxiety symp-
toms was a lack, or perceived lack of social support , and of 
isolation.42,44,46,51,60,64,66,71 Good perceived social support was 
protective of mental health, reducing symptomology and or 
loneliness in studies from 3 countries.51,65,66

Frequent areas or variables where an increased risk to peri-
natal mental health was identified included: a high risk preg-
nancy or complex obstetric history,48,54,58,63 prior diagnosis of 
mental illness , particularly comorbid psychotic and depres-
sive  disorders,45,54,56,62,65  concerns  regarding  maternity  ser-
vice quality and safety, changes, reduction or withdrawal of 
expected maternity service provision,38,64,66,73,74 and fear and 
worry of viral contamination, particularly in relation to antici-
pated/actual hospitalisation and childbirth.49,55,64,67,68,70,75

Reporting bias was identified for the following: 3 studies 
reported  sample  attrition75:  24%  (n = 153)39;  11.11%  (n = 9)

and41 21.74% (n = 4). Four studies reported incomplete ques-
tionnaires66:  16.78  (n = 166)68;  10.70%  (n = 238),67  26% 
(n = 1114)  and49  12.5%  (n = 56).  One  study  also  reported 
inconsistency of answers 0.5% (n = 5).66

Discussion

This systematic mixed methods review has sought to bring 
together  a  diverse  range  of  evidence  and  methodologies  to 
present a narrative account of what is known of the impact of 
Covid-19 upon perinatal women’s mental health. The global 
pandemic presented a unique context for women who were 
perinatal  during  this  time,  with  taken  for  granted  assump-
tions  about  impacts,  risk  and  protection  requiring  potential 
new insights as to the ways in which these might operate or 
be understood.

The results from our review confer that perinatal mental 
illness, particularly depression, anxiety and stress, was very 
evident during the pandemic. Many review studies though 
were unable to or did not go so far as to suggest that preva-
lence  and  incidence  rates  were  higher  than  pre-pandemic 
the  pandemic. 
levels,  or  directly  associated  with 
Those25,45,49,55,56,58,59,61,71 that did are in keeping with similar 
conclusions  reached  by  Shorey  et  al,23  Hessami  et  al,24 
Suwalska  et  al26  and  Iyengar  et al.25 The  limited  method-
ological quality of our included studies, sample and timing 
heterogeneity,  diverse  range  of  adopted  assessment  tools 
and  the  challenges  of  determining  changes  in  prevalence 
and  incidence  given  the  variability  of  pre-existing  esti-
mates, highlight limitations and inability to draw any firm 
conclusions.

Demographic variables increasing risk to perinatal mental 
health in the content of Covid-19 pandemic, including living 
in  a  high-risk  infection  area,  being  a  woman  of  colour,  or 
immigrant, being single and of younger age, are confirmed 
findings from other studies.25,26

Highlighted  is  the  prominence  of  fear,  insecurity  and 
increased  stress  impacting  negatively  upon  mental  health. 
While fear has been recognised as a relatively common emo-
tion for perinatal women,77 Covid-19 specific fears, evidenced 
across several countries related to viral contamination, vertical 
transmission of infection between mother and infant, confu-
sion and uncertainty of the nature and extent of risk, as well as 
perceived  threat  to  actual  life. Anxiety  and  fear  of  potential 
Covid-19  infection  negatively  impacting  mental  health  was 
also  prominent  in  other  studies.26,78  Knowledge  of  previous 
human coronavirus outbreak suggested pregnant women and 
their  foetus  were  at  increased  risk  of  poor  pregnancy  out-
comes.79  Zaigham  and  Andersson’s80  systematic  review  of 
emerging  evidence  during  the  recent  pandemic  on  pregnant 
mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2E also concluded the pos-
sibility of severe maternal morbidity, perinatal deaths and pos-
sibility of vertical transmission, though major complications 
were rare for most mothers. Women’s fears in the early stages 
of the pandemic were not without some substance.

Disruption to normal maternity service provision and pro-
fessional support was associated with increased anxiety and 
depression. Usual services that would be expected to support 
women manage their fears were also widely viewed as poten-
tial sources of risk, or had been withdrawn, reduced, or deliv-
ered in unfamiliar ways. Those most at risk of obstetric poor 
outcomes, or with a complex obstetric history requiring the 
likelihood of increased professional monitoring and support 
throughout  their  pregnancy,  birth  and  post-partum  period 
would contend with competing tensions between risk expo-
sure and protection of themselves, foetus and newborn infant. 
Likewise, women with a prior mental health illness, recog-
nised to be at significant higher risk of high levels of psycho-
pathology, may have been further disadvantaged by a lack of 
available  routine  screening  and  gaps  in  mental  healthcare 
provision.81 A study with 11 809 participants from 12 coun-
tries found that overall, about 1 in 10 women with clinically 
significant  symptoms  of  perinatal  mental  health  symptoms 
were receiving mental healthcare.81

Social  isolation  and  loneliness,  and  reduced  social  sup-
port related to lockdown restrictions were identified as sig-
nificant  risk  factors  increasing  risk  for  depressive  and  or 
anxiety symptoms. Other systematic review studies support 
these findings. Bedaso et al’s,82 pre-pandemic review of the 
relationship between social support and mental health prob-
lems  during  pregnancy  found  significant  associations  with 
risks  to  depression,  anxiety  and  self-harm.  A  systematic 
review  on  perinatal  mental  health  literacy  found  lack  of 
social  support  to  be  the  most  reported  cause  of  post-natal 
depression and perinatal depression among perinatal women 
during Covid-19.4

Fear  of  hospitalisation,  particularly  childbirth,  a  higher 
acute stress response to childbirth, and or lower birth satis-
faction,  were  factors  associated  with  increased  depression 
levels and negative impact upon maternal infant bonding and 
breast feeding. Echoing this, a Canadian study of perinatal 
women found concerns about giving birth and restriction of 
partner attending to be their main worries; worry levels were 
found to be higher in comparison to pre-covid levels.83 A sys-
tematic review found post-partum women significantly more 
likely to report bonding problems compared to post-partum 
women  before  the  pandemic,  with  higher  levels  of  depres-
sion resulting in lower attachment.25

Conflicting findings as to the role of income and employ-
ment  on  perinatal  mental  health  were  found  across  some 
studies.  Lower  income,  financial  strain,  economic  and 
employment insecurity and loss of employment were identi-
fied54,66,68,70 as increasing mental health problems and predic-
tive for anxiety and depression. In contrast, very low income 
was also found to promote resilience54 with low socio-eco-
nomic  status  found  to  decrease  mental  health  symptomol-
ogy.69 Wu et al’s58 study of Chinese pregnant women found 
those  working  full  time  in  employment,  of  middle  income 
and with appropriate living space had increased risk of men-
tal  health  problems.  Author’s  considered  explanations  for 

Pankaew et al

these findings provide example of the importance of looking 
beyond merely identification of risk or protective factors for 
perinatal mental health, but rather seeking to understand the 
dynamic processes, salience and specific contexts in which 
they  operate. The  detrimental  impact  of  Covid-19  on  busi-
nesses and employment along with increased risk of redun-
dancies,  particularly  for  women,  during  this  period  have 
been documented.84 Low income and financial strain are rec-
ognised risk factors for mental health during Covid-19.84

In  a  similar  vein,  the  contrasting  impact  of  pandemic 
lockdowns,  seen  for  some  to  increase  isolation,  parental 
stress,  and  negatively  impact  mental  and  emotional  health, 
for others, it served to enhance family life, partner relation-
ship,  and  reduce  family  stress  as  a  result  of  working  from 
home or being unemployed. Highlighted is the false dichot-
omy of viewing risk and protective factors as distinct dichot-
omies, when both may act to expose, increase risk, or protect. 
Loss of childcare and necessity to undertake home schooling 
are  suggested  to  have  placed  a  heavier  burden  upon  some 
women’s lives within the home.85

A  comparatively  small  number  of  protective  factors  for 
perinatal  mental  health  were  identified  in  the  review  com-
pared to risks, a feature also reflected in other reviews. Good 
perceived  or  actual  social support  was  a  common  finding 
protecting mental health, both within our review and that of 
other studies,26,86 while its role more generally in supporting 
the  transition  to  motherhood  and  promoting  psychological 
wellbeing  is  also  recognised.22 Accessibility  to  health  care 
and professional support was also identified in one study.44 A 
systematic review found social support from family and part-
ners  to  be  the  most  reported  facilitator  to  help-seeking  or 
mental health symptom disclosure.4

This paper has responded to and is aligned with this spe-
cial  issue  journal  principles of  “Leave no  one  behind” and 
“Endeavour to reach the furthest behind first.” The study on 
women’s mental health and wellbeing during the major life 
event  of  pregnancy  and  the  perinatal  period  has  sought  to 
raise recognition of the need to prioritise research into this 
population and to increase understanding of the impact of the 
pandemic upon mental health.

Health/research recommendations

•• Greater  consideration  given  to  psychological  and 

••

••

emotional support needs of perinatal women.
Increased sample diversity; particularly racial, educa-
tional and socio-economic diversity.
Increasing  insight  into  the  operation  and  impact  of 
risk  and  protective  factors  in  a  global  pandemic 
context.

Study limitations

Study limitations include relatively small number of included 
papers; predominantly of fair to acceptable overall quality of 

evidence;  under  representation  of  studies  from  the  global 
south,  and  geographically  limited  studies  from  the  global 
north; the study was not registered.

Conclusion

Perinatal mental illness and negative emotions were promi-
nent  in  women’s  lives  during  the  pandemic. Women’s  vul-
nerability and risk to adverse mental health was contributed 
and influenced by a range of factors operating in ways spe-
cific to the pandemic context.
