Perceptions and attitudes around perinatal 
mental health in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan: 
a systematic review of qualitative data
Nafisa Insan1*, Anthony Weke1, Judith Rankin1 and Simon Forrest2 

Abstract 
Background:  Perinatal mental health (PMH) is a worldwide public health issue crossing cultural boundaries. How-
ever, the prevalence of PMH conditions vary considerably. These disparities stem in part from poor understanding and 
stigma surrounding PMH which hinder pregnant women from seeking mental health care and may exacerbate their 
conditions. Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are South Asian countries with a higher burden of PMH conditions than in 
the Global North-West and very different social and cultural norms around gender and mental health. The aim of this 
systematic review (PROSPERO Ref: CRD42020167903) was to identify, synthesise and appraise the available literature 
on perceptions and attitudes of perinatal (pregnant and postpartum) women, their families and healthcare providers 
surrounding PMH in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

Methods:  Five electronic databases, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of science, and grey literature 
were searched using predefined search terms. Qualitative or quantitative articles with a qualitative component 
reporting perceptions and attitudes surrounding PMH in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were eligible for inclusion, 
if published in English between January 2000 and January 2021. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative 
Research Checklist and Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies were used to assess study quality. Findings 
were synthesised using thematic synthesis, as described by Thomas and Harden 2008.

Results:  Eight studies were included. Five overarching themes comprising 17 sub-categories were identified. These 
descriptive themes were: perceived causes of PMH, perceived symptoms of PMH, perceptions of motherhood, access-
ing PMH care and emotional sharing and coping strategies. Sociocultural expectations underpin many of the themes 
identified in this review including the importance of familial and societal causes of PMH, emphasis on physical symp-
toms, sacredness of motherhood, lack of awareness, stigma, shame, limited resources allocated for mental health and 
lack of emotional sharing.

Conclusions:  There is a complex range of perceptions and attitudes around PMH which influence women’s experi-
ences and access to PMH care. These findings will inform policy and practice through targeted interventions to tackle 
stigmatising attitudes and increasing education and training for healthcare providers.

Background
Perinatal  mental  health  (PMH)  conditions,  particu-
larly  depression  and  anxiety  being  the  most  common 
PMH  conditions,  have  been  long  considered  a  West-
ern  biomedical  construct  [1].  It  was  thought  that  the

rise in modern obstetric practices in Western countries, 
which isolated women from guidance and social support 
throughout  their  pregnancy  and  after  childbirth,  was 
related  to  maternal  depression  [2].  This  medicalisation 
of pregnancy often shifted the care of women away from 
sociocultural practices such as mandated rest and social 
recognition of new social status through rituals and gifts 
into more professional healthcare settings. Hence, it was 
assumed  that  women  from  non-Western  countries  were 
protected  from  depression  by  these  culturally  specific 
rituals  and  factors  [2].  However,  there  is  little  evidence 
to  support  this.  Not  only  do    PMH  conditions  such  as 
depression seem to occur universally, but recent research 
has  investigated  the  cross-cultural  validity  of  maternal 
depression and has found there to be a convergent valid-
ity  for  the  construct  of  maternal  depression  in  terms  of 
the emotional and somatic distress in the setting of social 
adversity  [3].  Therefore,  PMH  is  a  worldwide  public 
health issue crossing cultural boundaries. However, con-
ceptualisation  of  perinatal  depression  and  anxiety  as  a 
psychiatric, or even a medical disorder is less applicable 
in South Asian cultures which have differing perceptions 
of PMH making it a challenging, yet important, construct 
to tackle in these cultural settings [3, 4].

Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are South Asian coun-
tries which have very different social and cultural norms 
to  Western  countries.  Previous  literature  has  found  the 
prevalence  of  perinatal  depression  in  these  South  Asian 
countries  to  range  from  10%  [5]  to  as  high  as  39%  [6], 
compared  to  7–15%  in  High  Income  Countries  (HICs) 
[7]. These disparities stem from the poor understanding 
and  high  levels  of  stigma  around  mental  health  condi-
tions  in  South  Asia  [8],  which  prevent  pregnant  women 
from  seeking  and  accessing  mental  health  care  and 
reporting mental health issues due to shame and fear of 
judgment. It also impacts the way families and healthcare 
providers  of  pregnant  women  manage  and  view  depres-
sion  during  pregnancy,  consequently,  affecting  the  care 
women receive. It is, therefore, imperative we investigate 
the perceptions and attitudes that these communities in 
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have towards PMH to aid 
our understanding of why these countries have high rates 
of  perinatal  depression,  what  needs  to  be  done  to  break 
the stigma and to make mental health care more available 
and accessible for pregnant women.

Perceptions  and  attitudes,  which  are  heavily  contin-
gent and linked to socio-cultural context, influence how 
individual’s  understand  mental  illness  and  the  way  they 
respond  to  situations,  activities  and  relationships  [9]. 
South Asian cultures, like Bangladeshi, Indian and Paki-
stani, are very collectivist, in that social controls such as 
family,  culture,  religion  and  community,  often  dominate 
decision-making  and  strongly  shape  the  attitudes  that 

individuals  hold  [10].  Hence,  the  way  such  collectivist 
cultures  perceive  social  roles  and  conceptualise  identi-
ties  will  influence  individuals’  perceptions  and  attitudes 
towards certain phenomena such as PMH. A systematic 
review by Watson et al. [11] investigating ethnic minor-
ity  women’s,  largely  South  Asian  and  Black  African, 
experience  of  PMH  conditions  and  services  in  the  UK 
found that lack of awareness, ongoing stigma and cultural 
expectations  all  impacted  women’s  receipt  of  adequate 
PMH  support  in  the  UK  [11].  However,  there  is  limited 
research  investigating  these  experiences  in  Bangladesh, 
India  and  Pakistan  where  the  social  and  structural  set-
tings are vastly different.

To  our  knowledge,  there  are  no  existing  systematic 
reviews  which  have  investigated  perceptions  and  atti-
tudes  of  perinatal  (pregnant  and  postpartum)  women, 
their  families  and  health  care  providers  towards  PMH 
in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. These groups are key 
actors  in  perinatal  women  receiving  mental  health  care. 
Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to identify, 
synthesise and appraise the available literature on percep-
tions and attitudes of perinatal women, their families and 
healthcare  providers  surrounding  PMH  in  Bangladesh, 
India  and  Pakistan.  This  will  inform  the  development 
of  PMH  services  in  these  countries  and  interventions 
and  programmes  to  improve  mental  health  of  perinatal 
women.

Methods
This  systematic  review  followed  the  Enhancing  Trans-
parency  in  Reporting  the  synthesis  of  qualitive  research 
(ENTREQ) guidelines (See Additional File 1).

Search strategy

Inclusion criteria were qualitative and quantitative stud-
ies  with  a  qualitive  component  reporting  perceptions 
and  attitudes  related  to  women  in  the  perinatal  period, 
their families and healthcare providers surrounding PMH 
(only  including  perinatal  depression  and  anxiety  as  the 
most  common  PMH  conditions).  Studies  must  be  con-
ducted  on  populations  in  Bangladesh,  India  or  Pakistan 
and  be  published  in  English  between   1st  January  2000 
and  31st January 2021. This date restriction was imposed 
because scoping searches on Medline showed no appro-
priate  studies  before  2000,  suggesting  that  investigation 
of  maternal  depression  and  anxiety  in  South  Asia  is  a 
relatively recent area of research enquiry. Over time, clin-
ical  approaches  and  thinking  towards  maternal  depres-
sion  and  depression  as  a  whole,  particularly  in  Low  and 
Middle  Income  countries  (LMICs),  have  developed  and 
changed  [3].  Therefore,  this  date  restriction  ensured 
that  the  literature  in  this  review  would  still  be  clinically 
and  socially  relevant.  Studies  were  excluded  if  they  had

no  qualitative  element  that  could  be  extracted,  not  con-
ducted  in  Bangladesh,  India  or  Pakistan  and  published 
outside of the time frame investigated.

A  systematic  literature  search  was  conducted  via  the 
electronic  databases  MEDLINE,  Embase,  PsycINFO, 
Scopus  and  Web  of  science  using  keywords  and  MeSH 
headings  developed  with  an  information  specialist  (See 
Additional  File  2  for  full  OVID  search  strategy).  This 
review  relating  to  perceptions  and  attitudes  forms  part 
of  a  wider  search  strategy  which  also  included  a  second 
review  investigating  the  social  determinants  of  antena-
tal  depression  in  South  Asia  [12]  (see  PROSPERO  Ref: 
CRD42020167903). Search results were exported into the 
reference manager Zotero and duplicates were removed. 
Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two 
reviewers  (NI  and  AW)  and  compared.  Those  that  met 
the  criteria  were  obtained  in  full  and  assessed  by  the 
research  team  to  determine  inclusion.  Grey  literature 
was  searched  using  the  Open  Grey  database  and  also 
via  charities  and  non-governmental  organisations  such 
as  Building  Resources  Across  Communities  (BRAC), 
UNICEF and National Health Mission India. Supplemen-
tary  searches  included  hand  searching  study  reference 
lists included from databases and citation searches using 
Google  Scholar.  Database  searches  were  completed  on 
 31st January 2020 and updated on  4th January 2021.

Quality appraisal

Quality  appraisal  was  carried  out  by  two  reviewers  (NI 
and  AW)  and  agreement  was  reached  through  discus-
sion.  Study  quality  was  assessed  using  the  2018  Critical 
Appraisal  Skills  Programme  (CASP)  checklist  for  quali-
tative  studies  (see  Additional  File  3)  [13].  A  scoring  of 
1  mark  for  each  question  that  was  answered  with  “Yes” 
was allocated to provide an indicator of quality and ena-
bled comparison between reviewers. Cut-off scores of ≥ 9 
indicated ‘strong’ quality, 6–8 indicated ‘adequate’ quality 
and ≤ 5 indicated ‘weak’ quality for the CASP tool.

For  the  primarily  quantitative  studies  included  in  this 
review, there are no CASP checklists for cross-sectional 
studies,  therefore,  the  Newcastle–Ottawa  Scale  (NOS) 
adapted for cross-sectional studies which assesses infor-
mation  bias,  selection  bias  and  confounding  bias  was 
used  to  assess  quality  (see  Additional  File  4)  [14].  The 
maximum  quality  score  a  paper  could  receive  was  10; 
0–3 reflected ‘low’ quality papers, 4–7 was ‘medium’ and 
8–10 indicated ‘high’ quality.

Data extraction and synthesis

Data  including  bibliographic  information,  country,  type 
of  study,  sampling  size  and  method,  participant  charac-
teristics,  data  collection  method,  data  analysis  method, 
quality  assessment  and  findings  were  recorded  on  a 

standardised data extraction form. The integrated mixed 
methods  synthesis  approach  developed  by  Sandelowski 
et  al.  [15]  was  adopted.  This  involves  transforming  the 
data which are then integrated and synthesised together. 
In  this  review,  the  data  from  the  cross-sectional  studies 
were  transformed  into  qualitative  data,  as  the  studies 
used surveys or semi-structured interview questionnaires 
that  consisted  of  phrases/sentences  that  summarised 
certain  attitudes  and  perceptions.  The  transformation 
was  done  by  extracting  the  statements  that  were  mostly 
agreed with by the participants and that the authors high-
lighted  in  their  findings  and  discussion  and  using  those 
as qualitative statements to form themes. This method is 
appropriate when both quantitative and qualitative stud-
ies address the same research question.

Integration  and  synthesis  of  qualitative  findings  were 
carried  out  using  thematic  synthesis  adapted  from 
Thomas and Harden [16] by the lead reviewer (NI) in two 
iterative  stages:  1)  coding  of  extracted  data:  data  from 
included studies were examined for meaning and content 
and  codes  were  applied  to  capture  these.  As  each  new 
study was examined, similar codes were highlighted, and 
new codes were added to the bank; 2) Grouping of codes 
into themes: list of initial codes were analysed for mean-
ing and organised into categories of similar or associated 
meanings. Each category was examined, and descriptive 
themes  were  generated  and  relationships  between  them 
were  revealed.  Themes  were  then  interrogated  by  other 
reviewers (SF and JR).

Results
Included studies

Eight studies published between 2000 and 2021 met the 
inclusion  criteria  (Table  1).  See  Fig.  1  for  the  PRISMA 
flow  diagram.  Six  studies  were  conducted  in  India  [3, 
17–21],  two  in  Bangladesh  [9,  22]  and  one  in  Pakistan 
[19]. Four studies were qualitative [3, 9, 19, 22] and three 
were cross-sectional studies [17, 18, 20, 21]. Sample sizes 
ranged  from  21  to  332  using  mostly  purposive  or  con-
venience  sampling.  The  included  studies  investigated 
perceptions  and  attitudes  from  four  population  groups: 
pregnant  women  [17–19,  21],  postpartum  women  [3,  9, 
17,  19,  21,  22],  family  members  of  pregnant  women  [3, 
20]  and  healthcare  providers  [9,  21].  The  CASP  quality 
appraisal of qualitative studies found that all four qualita-
tive  studies  [3,  9,  19,  22]  were  of  ‘adequate’  quality.  The 
NOS  quality  appraisal  of  cross-sectional  studies  found 
that  three  studies  [17,  20,  21]  were  of  ‘medium’  quality 
and one study [18] was of ‘low’ quality.

Findings

Five  themes  were  synthesised  concerning  perceptions 
and  attitudes  surrounding  PMH  in  Bangladesh,  India

and Pakistan: (1) Perceived causes of PMH, (2) Perceived 
symptoms  of  PMH,  (3)  Perceptions  of  motherhood,  (4) 
Accessing PHM care and (5) Emotional sharing and cop-
ing  strategies.  Themes  comprised  sub-categories.  Direct 
quotes  cited  from  interviews  or  focus  groups  from  the 
relevant included studies are used to illustrate the themes 
and their sub-categories.

Theme 1: Perceived causes of PMH

This theme comprises the perceived causes of PMH con-
ditions  such  as  depression  and  anxiety.  The  sub-catego-
ries include a range of different psychosocial, cultural and 
socioeconomic issues.

“I have to do everything by myself. I need someone to 
help me. I haven’t gone to stay with mother because 
then my husband will have trouble managing things; 
he  will  have  to  cook  by  himself.  So  I’ll  go  later  and 
stay a month with her.” [3]

Poor  relationship  with  husband/in‑laws  Four  studies 
found  that  a  poor  relationship  with  husband  or  in-laws 
was  perceived  to  be  a  cause  of  PMH  conditions  [3,  19, 
21, 22]. A quote cited from an interview with a postpar-
tum mother in a study conducted in India highlights the 
importance  women  attach  to  the  relationship  with  their 
husband and the care that he provides:

Lack  of  practical  support  Four  studies  reported  find-
ings  suggesting  lack  of  practical  support  from  in-laws 
and husbands in helping out with household chores to be 
a  cause  of  PMH  conditions  [3,  9,  20,  21]. This  view  was 
found among postpartum women [3, 9], nurse practition-
ers [21] and family members of postpartum women [20]. 
This  is  illustrated  by  this  quote  cited  from  an  interview 
with a first-time mother in a study conducted in India:

“Once  you  are  married  you  are  under  the  care  of 
your  husband.  If  your  husband  is  not  good  then 
there  is  tension  and  you  wonder  why  you  ever  got 
married.” [3]

Intimate  partner  violence  (IPV)  Five  studies  reported 
IPV  to  be  perceived  as  a  cause  of  PMH  conditions  by 
pregnant [19] and postpartum women [3,  9, 19, 22] and 

 Insan et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:293 

Page 8 of 13

family  members  of  postpartum  mothers  [20].  IPV  was 
found mainly to take the form of spousal emotional and 
physical  violence  both  during  and  after  pregnancy  as 
highlighted  in  this  quote  from  a  postpartum  mother  in 
India.

“He used to hit me when I was pregnant. We had an 
argument  and  I  said  I  was  going  to  leave  him.  He 
said we should both die and save our lives. I said I 
would give back all the money he had spent on me. 
Then, he hit me badly; I fell on my stomach.” [3]

One  study  conducted  in  Bangladesh  highlighted  that 
along with spousal violence, women also feared violence 
from in-laws creating an abusive family environment for 
postpartum mothers [22].

“I  am  scared  of  them  (the  parents  in‑law),  they 
look  at  me  threateningly,  and  they  want  to  pick 
issues.  When  they  come  home,  I  stay  in  my  room 
and don’t get out.” [22]

Gender of the baby  Gender of the baby is a major con-
cern for perinatal women in South Asian countries and 
having a female child has been highlighted as a perceived 
cause of PMH conditions in five studies [3, 19–22]. The 
stress  caused  by  familial  abuse  when  having  a  daughter 
is highlighted in this quote cited from a focus group dis-
cussion  with  postnatal  women  in  a  study  conducted  in 
India:

“This time also I have given birth to a girl child [and] 
because  of  this  the  family  atmosphere  is  not  good. 
My family members are abusing me and because of 
this I am going through a lot of stress.” [19]

Health care providers also stated that pressure from the 
husband and in-laws for a male child were causes of peri-
natal depression. This perception was more prominent in 
nursing providers than medical practitioners [21] as they 
tend to have more discussion time with perinatal women 
during antenatal and postnatal care visits.

Economic  difficulties  Poverty  was  reported  to  be 
an  important  cause  of  PMH  conditions  by  perina-
tal  women  and  their  family  members  [3,  9,  20,  22].  In 
rural areas, husbands often work as farmers on others’ 
lands  which  leads  to  unsteady  income  due  to  periods 
of unemployment [3]. For perinatal women, this results 
in  worries  around  meeting  medical  costs  during  and 
after  her  pregnancy  and  being  able  to  feed  her  baby 
properly. It also indicates their financial dependency on 
husbands.

“The  main  tension  is  because  of  the  unemployment 
of  my  husband.  Since  it’s  summer  now,  he  can  go 
anywhere (and do odd jobs), but once it starts rain‑
ing, where can he go…my elder son has jaundice. If 
one of them is better, then the other one falls ill. I’m 
worried  because  we  have  to  buy  the  medicine  pre‑
scribed by the doctor.” [3]

Spiritual  Three  studies  reported  perceptions  of  spirit-
ual causes of PMH conditions. These views were found in 
perinatal women [17, 18] and family members [20]. Many 
thought that mental illness during pregnancy was caused 
by  being  possessed  by  God  or  some  devil,  committing 
sin, black magic or witchcraft.

Theme 2: Perceived symptoms of PMH

This  theme  comprises  findings  relating  to  the  views 
of  perinatal  women,  family  members  and  health 
care  providers  on  the  symptoms  and  effects  of  PMH 
conditions.

Physical  symptoms  Four  studies  highlighted  that  many 
perinatal  women  attached 
importance  to  physical, 
somatic signs such as weakness, backache, headache and 
“brain stops” when describing the symptoms and effects 
of PMH conditions [3, 9, 17, 22]. This is illustrated by this 
quote cited from an interview with a postpartum mother 
when  asked  about  symptoms  of  depression  in  a  study 
conducted in India:

“The headaches, dizziness, cold, tiredness all are the 
effects of this tension.” [3]

It  was  also  suggested  by  Goyal  et  al.  [17]  that  women 
tend  to  focus  more  on  these  physical  symptoms  when 
trying to describe poor PMH to others such as health-
care  providers  or  their  families,  as  women  perceive 
these  to  be  more  acceptable  and  treatable  symptoms 
rather  than  symptoms  such  as  worry,  fear,  loneliness 
and  stress.  Physical  symptoms  prevent  women  from 
completing household chores or looking after her baby 
which was also highlighted to be a concern within peri-
natal women [22].

Emotional symptoms  However, some studies found that 
perinatal  women  and  health  care  providers  do  consider 
emotional symptoms of PMH to be important [3, 17, 19, 
21,  22].  Some  women  described  symptoms  of  PMH  as 
feeling  sad,  low  mood,  being  depressed,  crying,  having 
tension  or  being  mentally  weak.  These  symptoms  were 
acknowledged  by  women,  but  they  would  not  always 
share these [17].

Insan et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:293 

Page 9 of 13

“Things are running in my head. I can’t stop worry‑
ing about everything.” [22].

Some pregnant women did not consider certain physical 
symptoms such as change in appetite, sleep problems and 
feeling tired as symptoms of depression [21]. Such symp-
toms are considered to be a normal part of pregnancy or 
of the postpartum period [19].

Theme 3: Perceptions of motherhood

Perceptions  that  individuals  carry  towards  pregnancy 
and  motherhood  impacts  the  way  communities  view 
mental  health  issues  within  this  population  group  as 
they  have  preconceived  notions  of  what  pregnancy 
should  entail  and  how  mothers  should  behave.  In  this 
theme,  these  perceptions  are  highlighted  and  how  this 
impacts their attitudes towards PMH is explained.

Motherhood  is  sacred  Motherhood  is  sacred  and  an 
integral  part  of  being  a  woman  in  many  South  Asian 
communities  as  highlighted  by  three  studies  [9,  20,  21]. 
When a woman becomes a mother, her status is elevated 
in  her  family  and  society  and  it  is  acknowledged  as  an 
accomplishment  as  stated  by  a  postpartum  mother  in  a 
study conducted in Bangladesh:

“Now  everything  is  changed,  people  say  that  now 
you  are  a  mother,  they  give  me  more  importance, 
and they are so happy with me.” [9]

However,  this  places  pressures  on  women  to  live  up  to 
this  status. These  societal  expectations  placed  on  moth-
ers can result in criticism of women who may appear to 
struggle during pregnancy or postpartum, particularly to 
the point where she needs to access care [9]. In addition, 
these  perceptions  can  be  subject  to  certain  conditions 
such  as  having  female  children  which  is  often  perceived 
as a status reducing characteristic for mothers [22].

Baby’s health is most important  Prominence is attached 
to  a  baby’s  health  as  an  important  aspect  of  maternal 
wellbeing as highlighted in five studies [3, 9, 19, 20, 22]. 
Women  during  and  after  pregnancy  assess  their  moth-
ering  abilities,  health  and  success  on  the  basis  of  their 
baby’s health.

“The  most  important  thing  is  this  that  baby  is 
healthy.” [19].

“I  am  more  worried  now  about  the  baby…if  my 
baby stays healthy, I will be in peace.” [22]

Theme 4: Accessing PMH care

This  theme  highlights  some  of  the  key  barriers  and 
enablers  of  access  to  PMH  care  as  perceived  by  peri-
natal  women,  their  family  members  and  healthcare 
providers.

Mental  health  awareness  A  key  enabler  in  improving 
access  to  PMH  care  is  professional  awareness  of  mental 
health  and  the  understanding  that  perinatal  women  are 
at risk of mental health conditions [3, 9, 18, 19, 21]. Many 
healthcare  providers  had  poor  awareness  and  under-
standing  of  mental  health  and  PMH  and  perceived  that 
such conditions were not a serious health concern [3, 9, 
21]. This is highlighted in this quote cited from an inter-
view with a gynaecological intern in a study conducted in 
Bangladesh:

“There  is  no  mental  health  in  maternal  health  – 
we  don’t  take  mental  health  seriously,  it’s  just  not 
there.” [9]

Awareness  among  perinatal  women  varies  with  many 
finding it difficult to understand the links between preg-
nancy or motherhood and depression.

“Why would she be sad? I don’t understand.” “I don’t 
know, this does not happen.” [9].

One  study  highlighted  that  the  husbands  of  postpartum 
women  have  very  limited  awareness  of  PMH  [3].  Hus-
bands  are  less  aware  of  the  emotional  needs  of  women 
during and after pregnancy and they often feel their only 
duty  is  to  provide  financial  support  [3].  Many  husbands 
of  women  with  postpartum  depression  were  also  igno-
rant that their wives were unwell in any way [3].

Stigma and shame  Stigma and the related shame asso-
ciated  with  PMH  in  Bangladesh,  India  and  Pakistan  is 
a  key  barrier  for  perinatal  women  accessing  PMH  care 
as  highlighted  by  seven  studies  [3,  9,  17–21].  There  is 
the  attitude  that  emotional  health  problems  should  stay 
within the family and women would not tell their friends 
if  they  do  attend  mental  health  services  because  of  the 
taboo attached to them [9].

Attitudes  of  family  members  of  perinatal  women  also 
reflect these stigmatisations regarding women with post-
partum  depression  characterising  them  as  not  being 
good mothers [20]. Nevertheless, many are ready to help 
reduce depression through family interventions. Nursing 
providers  stated  that  postpartum  depression  is  a  sign  of 
weakness and “women choose to get postpartum depres-
sion.” [21].

Stigma  results  in  women  being  ashamed  or  fearful  to 
access care due to repercussions from family or judgment 
from  healthcare  providers  and  communities  [19].  These 
concerns are highlighted in this quote cited from a focus 
group  discussion  with  pregnant  women  in  a  study  con-
ducted in Pakistan:

‘Some women will not talk about their problems as 
they  are  afraid.  They  think  that  their  husband  will 
know about it if they talk to doctor and will be angry 
with them.” [19]

Friendly  and  confidential  counselling  McCauley  et  al. 
[19] found that perinatal women would find counselling 
acceptable if healthcare providers providing the counsel-
ling were friendly, kept the information confidential and 
removed  the  stigma  attached  to  PMH.  Counselling  is  a 
more  appropriate  form  of  treatment  compared  to  drugs 
and  medications  for  healthcare  providers  to  offer  and 
perinatal women to receive [20, 21].

Counselling and social support have been acknowledged 
as  helpful  by  many  women  but  require  much  more  cul-
tural attention to tackle the shame and stigma associated 
with  it  [17].  Western  protocols  and  counselling  meth-
ods  may  not  work  as  well  in  these  South  Asian  settings 
as  they  need  to  consider  religious,  cultural  and  societal 
beliefs which shape a lot of the beliefs around PMH [3, 9].

Limited  resources  A  key  barrier  in  accessing  adequate 
PMH  care  is  the  limited  resources  in  these  South  Asian 
countries  as  reported  by  five  studies  [3,  9,  17–19].  One 
aspect of limited resources is the lack of time that health-
care  providers  have  which  prevents  them  from  focusing 
on PMH [9, 19].

“A  doctor  has  many  patients…obviously,  they  don’t 
have time for these details!” [19].

Another  element  is  poverty  and  lack  of  money  in  the 
health system to treat PMH conditions and within fami-
lies  to  access  such  treatments  [3,  17,  18].  Resources  are 
very  constrained  within  the  healthcare  system,  with 
respect  to  mental  health,  and  healthcare  providers  have 
to make choices about the care they deliver and physical 
health takes precedence [9].

“How  can  we  focus  on  maternal  depression  when 
unattended  birth  and  postpartum  haemorrhage  is 
such a problem, and we are a poor country?” [9]

There  is  also  limited  education  for  healthcare  provid-
ers  on  PMH  with  counselling  not  widely  taught  and 

no  protocols  on  how  to  educate  or  identify  women 
with  postpartum  depression  [9].  This  lack  of  education 
impacts the care available to perinatal women.

Theme 5: Emotional sharing and coping strategies

This theme highlights the ways in which perinatal women 
share  their  emotions  and  the  “coping”  strategies  (term 
used  by  William  et  al.  [9])  they  adopt  to  manage  their 
PMH conditions.

Sharing is pointless  Many women reported that sharing 
their mental health issues is pointless or difficult because 
of resulting quarrels and judgment from others. [3, 9, 19] 
Family  members  tend  to  be  disinterested  in  such  mat-
ters  and  women  feel  that  healthcare  providers  will  not 
be able to do much as these are family related problems 
[3]. Hence, emotional sharing tends to be very limited in 
these South Asian countries.

“It’s not necessary to share, I feel better to just keep 
things to myself. I am afraid of sharing.”[9]

Personal coping strategies  With limited emotional shar-
ing  with  others,  perinatal  women  tend  to  resort  to  per-
sonal  coping  strategies  [3,  9,  17].  A  common  form  is 
through  distraction  from  the  issues  that  worry  women 
by getting out of the house or playing with their baby [9]. 
This is highlighted by this quote cited from an interview 
with a Bangladeshi postpartum mother when asked how 
she copes with stress:

“Sometimes  I  go  outside  the  gate  and  stand  there, 
and then I come back.” [9].

Religious  coping  strategies  Aside  from  coping  through 
personal  strategies,  four  studies,  Rodrigues  et  al.  [3], 
Williams et al. [9], Goyal et al. [17] and Manjrekar et al. 
[18] found that perinatal women would also turn to reli-
gious coping methods through prayers, faith-healing and 
crying for God’s help. Religion is often a source of com-
fort and strength for many women in these South Asian 
countries.

Discussion
This review synthesised data from primary studies inves-
tigating perceptions and attitudes around PMH in Bang-
ladesh,  India  and  Pakistan,  a  topic  largely  overlooked  in 
the literature to date. This review identified five themes: 
perceived causes of PMH, perceived symptoms of PMH, 
perceptions  of  motherhood,  accessing  PMH  care  and 
emotional sharing and coping strategies.

The perceptions and attitudes identified in this review 
are largely related to sociocultural factors, reflecting cul-
tural  collectivism  and  the  local  social  construction  of 
gender roles and power relations. This is evident from the 
perceived  causes  of  PMH  conditions  as  identified  from 
the studies included in this review. These findings relate 
to  evidence  from  cross-sectional  studies  which  found 
significant associations between IPV [23–26], poor rela-
tionship with husband/in-laws [8, 26], low practical sup-
port  [25,  26],  female  gender  of  the  baby  [5,  24,  27],  and 
antenatal depression among women in South Asia. Social 
construction of gender roles within South Asian commu-
nities often places women at a disadvantage. Women are 
expected to carry out all the household chores, even dur-
ing pregnancy, with little practical support and an inabil-
ity to do this can result in repercussions from the family 
including  being  subjected  to  violence  [24].  Even  before 
a  woman  is  born,  society  deems  her  to  be  of  lower  sta-
tus and value than men as reflected by the preference for 
male  children  [28]. These  gender  inequalities  are  rooted 
within many South Asian communities and can strongly 
influence individuals’ perceptions and attitudes.

Affective symptoms of PMH are acknowledged by peri-
natal women, however, discussing physical, more somatic 
symptoms  is  much  more  acceptable  due  to  the  percep-
tion that women with mental health conditions are ‘weak’ 
or ‘mad’. This is common in Asian culture as highlighted 
in the review by Halbreich & Karkun [4] who investigated 
cross-cultural  postpartum  depression  prevalence  and 
symptoms. Since motherhood is sacred, is it not socially 
acceptable  to  be  seen  as  weak.  Thus,  women  are  forced 
to hide their emotional symptoms from family members 
and  healthcare  providers  with  the  fear  that  their  child 
may  be  removed  from  their  care.  Even  healthcare  pro-
viders’  attitudes  are  dominated  by  collectivist  cultural 
controls where they infrequently ask about emotional or 
mental  health  symptoms  as  they  perceive  it  to  be  inap-
propriate.  These  findings  are  consistent  with  the  sys-
tematic review by Watson et al. [11] on South Asian and 
Black African women’s experiences of PMH in the UK.

Barriers and enablers to accessing PMH care operate at 
a number of levels ranging across sociocultural to struc-
tural  factors.  Perinatal  women  who  acknowledged  men-
tal health conditions were more open to discussing these 
with  healthcare  providers.  Family  members  and  health-
care  providers  who  had  adequate  awareness  around  the 
importance  of  PMH  also  enabled  perinatal  women  to 
access  care.  This  is  consistent  with  other  studies  which 
found that lack of awareness among women, their fami-
lies  and  healthcare  providers  led  to  poor  recognition  of 
symptoms  and  delayed  management  [11,  13]. Therefore, 
increased  training  and  education  is  required  to  increase 
awareness around PMH.

In  addition,  lack  of  awareness  often  stems  from  the 
high levels of stigma associated with mental health which 
is  a  significant  barrier  for  accessing  PMH  care.  This 
again  highlights  the  theory  of  collectivist  cultures  [29] 
where  societal  stigma  found  within  these  South  Asian 
countries  dominate  the  attitudes  people  have  towards 
PMH  resulting  in  women  who  access  PMH  care  being 
criticised. These  findings  are  highlighted  in  previous  lit-
erature  where  stigma  is  a  key  barrier  to  accessing  PMH 
care  [11,  30].  Women  do  not  want  to  be  labelled  with 
mental  health  conditions  as  society  will  deem  them  to 
be weak and unsuitable mothers. This relates to the emo-
tional sharing and coping strategies adopted by perinatal 
women  in  this  review.  Sharing  is  perceived  as  pointless 
as they won’t be taken seriously by a society which belit-
tles PMH, therefore, women resort to personal and reli-
gious coping strategies [3, 9, 17]. Distraction and praying 
are two methods; however, these are not sustainable. This 
calls  for  culturally  appropriate  coping  interventions  for 
long-term management.

Structural  factors  such  as  limited  resources  also  cre-
ate barriers for perinatal women receiving PMH care and 
healthcare  providers  delivering  the  care.  Lack  of  time 
and limited health workforce means healthcare providers 
are  forced  to  focus  only  on  physical  health.  Postpartum 
haemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality in 
South Asian countries [31]. Therefore, immediate atten-
tion must be given to such physical health concerns. Pov-
erty plays a role in the limited resources in countries such 
as Bangladesh who only spend 0.5% of the health budget 
on  mental  health  [32].  There  is  limited  money  to  spend 
on mental health services and facilities which are acces-
sible for perinatal women from all regions. These findings 
are consistent with other LMICs [30].

These  findings  have  implications  for  informing  cross-
sectoral  prevention  and  management  interventions  for 
PMH in these South Asian countries. The education sec-
tor will be a key actor in the development of these inter-
ventions addressing many of the perceptions and attitudes 
identified  in  this  review.  Improved  education  for  health-
care  providers  at  all  levels  is  vital  for  increasing  aware-
ness of PMH and better knowledge of the symptoms and 
management  options  [33].  Healthcare  providers  working 
directly  with  perinatal  women  should  be  given  adequate 
training around friendly and confidential counselling. Psy-
chosocial education aimed to tackle IPV, gender inequali-
ties  and  stigma  within  communities  could  be  provided 
through  Government  and  non-governmental  social  pro-
grammes. Family planning services are also key to address 
the issue of unplanned pregnancies. This can be achieved 
through  Maternal,  Neonatal  and  Child  Health  platforms 
who can provide these services at a community and house-
hold  level  through  community  health  workers  who  are

more  aware  of  the  rural  settings  and  culture.  The  Social 
welfare  sector  should  be  integrated  to  tackle  poverty, 
housing  and  unemployment,  for  example,  by  encourag-
ing microcredits for women to start their own small busi-
nesses and promoting health knowledge [34].

To our knowledge this is the first systematic review of 
literature  focusing  on  perceptions  and  attitudes  around 
PMH in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. A wide range of 
databases  were  searched  using  a  comprehensive  search 
strategy  and  supplementary  searches  were  carried  out. 
However,  we  acknowledge  some  possible  limitations. 
Due  to  resource  constraints,  articles  were  restricted  to 
those  in  the  English  language  which  may  produce  lan-
guage  bias.  Nevertheless,  journals  from  Bangladesh, 
India  and  Pakistan  tend  to  increasingly  publish  in  the 
English  language  or  contain  translations  making  them 
accessible  for  a  wider  audience.  Second,  although  most 
studies  were  deemed  to  be  of  ‘adequate’  or  ‘medium’ 
quality,  there  were  gaps  in  reporting,  particularly  with 
regards to possible researcher bias during data collection 
and analysis and what implications this may have on the 
findings and conclusions in the included studies. Finally, 
only  eight  studies  were  identified  for  inclusion  in  this 
review, with only one from Pakistan which may question 
the  relevance  of  the  themes  in  a  Pakistani  setting.  Nev-
ertheless,  qualitative  reviews  adopt  more  interpretative 
approaches using depth and richness of data rather than 
breadth  which  privilege  smaller  number  of  studies  [35]. 
Given this, Booth et al. [35] suggests a preferred number 
of between 6 and 14 studies for a qualitative review.

Conclusion
There  is  a  complex  range  of  perceptions  and  attitudes 
around  PMH  which  influence  women’s  experiences  and 
access to PMH care within Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. 
Sociocultural  expectations  underpin  many  of  the  percep-
tions  and  attitudes  identified  in  this  review  including  the 
importance of familial and societal causes of PMH, empha-
sis on physical symptoms, sacredness of motherhood, lack 
of  awareness,  stigma,  shame,  limited  resources  allocated 
for  mental  health  and  lack  of  emotional  sharing.  These 
interlinking  perceptions  reflect  the  cultural  collectivist 
nature  of  South  Asian  cultures  preventing  proper  identi-
fication and adequate care for perinatal women with PMH 
conditions.  These  findings  can  be  used  to  inform  policy 
and practice through targeted interventions to tackle stig-
matising  attitudes  and  increasing  education  and  training 
for  healthcare  providers.  Further  research  should  explore 
perceptions  and  attitudes  of  perinatal  women  along  with 
key family members, such as husband and mother-in-law, 
and community-based healthcare providers in Bangladesh, 
where  there  is  limited  qualitative  research,  particularly 
during the antenatal period.
