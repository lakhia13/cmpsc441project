Abstract 

Today’s people live in a society with many dangers to their peace and security. The effectiveness 
of different therapies in psychological variables needs to be evaluated to reach the most precise 
therapies  based  on  research  evidence.  This  study  aimed  to  compare  the  effectiveness  of 
existential  therapy  (ET)  and  acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)  in  alleviating  the 
loneliness and irrational beliefs of male prisoners. In the present quasi-experimental study, the 
statistical  population  consisted  of  all  married  male  prisoners  aged  between  25  to  45  years  in 
Mashhad Central Prison in the first half of 2017. Among the statistical population, 36 people 
were selected and then randomly placed in three research groups. The two experimental groups 
underwent eight separate intervention sessions, ET, and ACT. At the beginning and end of the 
study, all of the three groups were evaluated by a research questionnaire, including the loneliness 
scale. The results of data analysis showed that, in comparison with the control group, the changes 
in the other two groups under ET and ACT were significant as to the feeling of loneliness and 
irrational beliefs of prisoners. However, there was no significant difference between the effects 
of these two treatments. The present research was limited in the case of examining the follow-
up  stage  due  to  lack  of  access  and  cooperation  of  the  subjects,  incorporating  some  control 
variables (such as the history of substance use and psychiatry), and employing other evaluation 
methods  (e.g.,  interview).  It  is  highly  suggested  that  future  research  should  address  these 
limitations. 
Key  Words:  Feelings  of  loneliness;  irrational  beliefs;  acceptance  and  commitment  therapy;

 Today,  society  poses  many  dangers  (e.g.,  crime)  to 
people’s  peace  and  security.  Every  day,  there  are 
disturbing  news  and  reports  about  various  crimes  that 
lead  to  death,  disability,  and  other  physical  injuries  in 
society. Crimes are committed for different reasons such 
as  unemployment,  low  level  of  education,  family  and 
marital  problems,  crime-triggering  social  network, 
substance/alcohol use, poor social functions, anti-social 
attitudes, personal and emotional factors, and personality 
and  psychological  disorders.1  Living  space  plays  an 
important  role  in  human  physical  and  psychological 
health. Any restrictions on various aspects of this space 
is 
can 
associated  with  difficult  conditions  for  most  people, 
interpreted as a scary, dark, and terrifying environment, 
which is not far from reality. The prison environment has 
unique conditions and characteristics; in general, prison 
is one of the most stressful places for any human being.2,3

The  study  of  various  psychological  and  behavioral 
components  of  prisoners  is  one  of  the  main  topics  of 
interest  to  psychologists  and  social  science  experts. 
Surveys  show  that  more  than  10.1  million  people 
worldwide  and  220,000  people  in  Iran  are  in  prison, 
highlighting 
their 
importance  of 
physical and psychological health.4,5  Research in prisons 
has shown that physical and psychological disorders are 
the  general 
more  prevalent 
population. At least half of these people have personality 
disorders,  one  million  of  them  suffer  from  severe 
psychiatric  disorders 
as  mood  disorders, 
such 
posttraumatic stress disorder, or psychosis, and almost all 
of 
to 
them  experience  adjustment  disorders  due 
continuous  stress  conditions,  especially  in  the  presence 
of secondary alexithymia.6-8 Several thousand prisoners 
around the world commit suicide annually; 89% of them 
have  symptoms  of  depression,  and  74%  have  physical 
symptoms  of  stress,  which  is  higher  compared  to  the

general population.2,9,10 Further, research has shown that 
incarceration  has  a  negative  effect  on  prisoners, 
especially  young  people,  forcing  them  to  leave  their 
family, jobs, and social life and increasing the inclination 
to  commit  a  crime  in  prison.11  Feeling  alone  is 
experienced  by  prisoners  due  to  their  psychological 
condition and the specific environment of prison, which 
needs to be studied. Since human beings are born and live 
in 
in  communities, 
communication issues, such as loneliness as an integral 
part  of  social  life.  It  has  been  said  that  interpersonal 
anomalies are rooted in loneliness. In general, loneliness 
can  be  divided  into  intrapersonal,  interpersonal,  and 
existential  categories.12  Intrapersonal  loneliness  is  the 
personality  part  that  feels  lonely,  synonymous  with  a 
state  of 
isolation.  However, 
existential  loneliness  is  a  situation  related  to  human 
existence, which is not related to separation from others 
or lack of intimate relationships.13 Instead, it implies that 
man  is  permanently  incapable  of  understanding  how 
others perceive the world. Irrespective of his connection 
with  others,  he  is  still  alone  in  his  existence;  in  other 
words, he has entered this world alone and will leave it 
alone.14  This  loneliness  is  traced  back  to  the  distance 
between oneself and others. In fact, existential loneliness 
is a component of the existential approach.12-14 One of the 
three areas studied by psychologists on the human psyche 
is  the  field  of  cognition,  thinking,  and  interpretation. 
Irrational beliefs can probably be assumed as predictors 
of psychological functioning in prisoners. According to 
the  rational-emotional-behavioral  theory  (REBT),  the 
core  thought  in  the  logical  and  irrational  processes  in 
human  behavior  is  that  man  has  several  basic  desires, 
thinking 
goals,  and  preferences  as 

their  main 

components. More to the point, human beings live better 
and  more  effectively  when  they  have  a  sense  of  self-
efficacy  or  dominance  (self-satisfaction),  succeed  in 
setting goals (goal and satisfaction), are approved or less 
disapproved by people who are important to them (love 
and  approval),  and  stay  healthy  (health  satisfaction).15 
Irrational  beliefs  are  inappropriate  solutions  used  by  a 
person to their problems, which occur in their minds and 
affect their lives. Recent analyses have suggested that the 
social and cultural environment of the  individual is the 
basis of irrational beliefs. In other words, the individual’s 
mental  framework  is  shaped  by  information  received 
from the environment. Further, irrational beliefs trigger 
many  dysfunctional  behaviors  and  many  failures.15 
Accordingly,  interventions  and  treatment  programs  are 
needed to enhance the psychological state of prisoners. 
In this regard, various therapies have been studied, such 
as  existential  therapy  (ET)  as  one  of  the  psychological 
approaches to improving the psychological condition of 
prisoners. This theory has a philosophical nature and is a 
set  of  ideas  and  theories  about  human  beings,  called 
existential psychotherapies.16 The existential approach in 
psychology  as  a  common  situation  for  all  people, 
regardless of culture, religion, ethnicity, and race, deals 
with  deep  and  central  issues  such  as 
loneliness, 
meaninglessness,  death,  and  freedom.17  This  approach 
encourages clients to face those aspects of their lives that 
they  have  always  avoided,  courageously  acknowledge 
these unfortunate events, and accept that happiness and 
joy are met provided that one can realize the temporary 
nature  of  security  and  vitality  in  life.15  Existential 
psychotherapy focuses on the importance of human life 
based  on  his  perspective  on 
life.  Existential 
psychotherapy is an attitude to life issues such as life and

death,  freedom,  responsibility  for  oneself  and  others,

therapeutic  approach,  superior  to  any  other  approach, 
examines  man’s  self-awareness  and  ability  to  look 
beyond  their  problems  and  existential  issues.  In  this 
approach,  no  attempt  is  made  to  eliminate  human 
suffering  because  human  life  is  inherently  painful. 
Instead, human beings are helped to find meaning in life 
by accepting  the reality of pain and suffering,  whereby 
pain  will  be  enjoyable.16  The  advantage  of  existential 
psychotherapy  over  other  approaches  is  its  focus  on 
available  choices  and  paths  to  personal  growth.  It  also 
leads  to  accepting  personal  responsibilities,  expanding 
awareness  of  current  situations,  and  a  sense  of 
commitment 
to  decision-making  and  action.  This 
approach seeks to help people realize that although they 
may  not  be  able  to  change  some  of  the  unpleasant  and 
painful  aspects  of  their  lives,  they  can  understand  how 
these events are perceived and react to them.12 Another 
practical  treatment  approach  to  improving  prisoners’ 
mental  health  is  Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy 
(ACT). This therapeutic approach is one of the new and 
effective  therapies  for  solving  psychological  problems 
and disorders.18 Its basic principles include (i) Accepting 
or wanting to experience pain or other disturbing events 
without trying to control them; (ii) Acting based on value 

- 3 - 

goals 

before 

eliminating 

or commitment, with a desire to act towards meaningful 
personal 
unwanted 
experiences.19 As an essential part of the psychotherapy 
in ACT, the patient must be guided through the path of 
action to reach the values expressed by them.20 Attempts 
to  change  behavior  for  better  adaptation  have  led  to 
psychological  barriers  addressed  through  the  ACT 
process. Researchers have paid less attention to ACT that 
is  one  of  the  third  wave  therapies.18-20  In  a  committed 
activity, the individual is encouraged to do their best to 
achieve the goal. In other words, in this type of treatment, 
the  main  aim  is  to  create  psychological  flexibility,  i.e., 
making  practical  choices  among  different  most 
appropriate  options  rather  than  avoiding  disturbing 
thoughts,  feelings,  memories,  and  desires.  Empirical 
evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  this  treatment  in 
disorders  such  as  depression,  psychosis,  social  phobia, 
and  high-risk  behaviors  such  as  alcohol  and  substance 
use  has  been  identified.21  Prisoners,  on  a  larger  scale, 
reflect  some  of  society’s  values.  They  are  still  part  of 
human  society,  regardless  of  the  type  of  crime/penalty 
they have been arrested for/sentenced to. Most prisoners 
suffer  from  mental  disorders,  either  rooted  in  physical 
problems  or  triggered  by  the  individual’s  family  and 
mental  environment.  In  both  cases,  there  is  a  need  for 
counseling  and  psychotherapy  for  all  prisoners.  On  the

other hand, it is  necessary to study the effectiveness of 
different therapies in the psychological variables of this 
group  in  order  to  create  practical  treatments  based  on 
research evidence. Therefore, the present study  aims to 
compare  the  effectiveness  of  ET  and  ACT  in  male 
prisoners’ loneliness and their irrational beliefs. 

Materials and Methods 

and 

Participants and procedure 
This research is a quasi-experimental trial, conducted as 
pre-test/post-test,  with  a  control  group  and 
two 
experimental  groups.  The  statistical  population  of  the 
study included all married male prisoners aged between 
25  to  45  years  in  Mashhad  Central  Prison,  who  were 
sentenced to more than one year in prison and had passed 
counseling courses and basic psychological classes in the 
counseling  unit.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  ethics 
committee  of  the  Islamic  Azad  University,  Mashhad 
Branch 
all 
(IR.IAU.MSHD.REC.1399.131), 
procedures were in accordance with the latest version of 
the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to participation, written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants and 
their  parents/legal  guardians  after  a  comprehensive 
explanation of the study procedures. 
Exclusion criteria were: 
 (i)   intellectual disability; 
(ii)   a history of serious neurological disorders; 
(iii)   hearing loss.  
The sample of the present study consisted of 36 prisoners 
who were selected by the purposive sampling method and 
randomly  divided  into  two  experimental  groups  (12 
people in each group) and a control group (12 people). 
The  experimental  groups  underwent  eight  sessions  of 
intervention. The data were analyzed by SPSS software 
using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). 

Instruments 
Questionnaires and materials used in this study were as 
follows:  

UCLA Loneliness Scale  
The UCLA Loneliness Scale has 20 questions scored on 
the 5-point Likert scale, i.e., never (score 1), rarely (score 
2),  sometimes  (score  3),  often  (score  4),  and  always 
(score 5). Questions 19, 16, 15, 10, 9, 6, 5, 1 and 20 are 
scored reversely. The test scores range from 20 to 200, 
where  a  higher  score  indicates  a  more  intense  sense  of 
loneliness.22  Russell  and  Ferguson  first  developed  the 
Russell  Loneliness  Scale,  followed  by  three  revisions. 
The  final  version  of  the  scale  was  used  among  four 
groups  of  students,  nurses,  teachers,  and  the  elderly 
through various means such as self-report and interview. 
Their Cronbach’s alpha coefficient ranged from 0.89 to 
0.94, which was satisfactory.23 Sodani et al.24 studied the 
psychometric  properties  of  the  Persian  version  of  the 
UCLA  Loneliness  Scale  and  obtained  the  reliability 
coefficient of Cronbach’s alpha method equal to 0.81. 

Four-Factor Irrational Beliefs Test-Ahvaz (4IBT-A) 
The 4IBT-A was developed by Motamedin et al.25 based 
on  the  10-item  Jones  Irrational  Beliefs  Test  by  factor 
analysis  in  Iranian  society.  It  consists  of  40  questions 
scored  on  the  5-score  Likert  scale,  ranging  from  one 
(strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).  
Motamedin  et  al.25  also  used  Cronbach’s  alpha  method 
and estimated the reliability of the test  for helplessness 
with change, demand for approval, problem avoidance, 
emotional irresponsibility, and the total test at 0.77, 0.68, 
0.59, 0.68, and 0.86, respectively.

The treatment process program in the two experimental 
groups is presented in Table 1 and Table 2.

Results 
Table 3 presents the descriptive variables of this study for 
the three test groups. Before analyzing the covariance, we 
investigated the assumptions of this test. The normality 
of data distribution is presented in Table 4. It is necessary 
to 
the  normality  of  data  distribution, 
homogeneity of variance, independence, and assumption 
of  homogeneity  of  regression  slopes  to  examine  the 
assumptions  of analysis of covariance.  As can be seen, 
the variance of the feeling of loneliness in the pre-test and 
post-test  of  all  three  groups  ranged  from  -2  to  +2. 
Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the loneliness variable is 
normal in all groups.26 According to the significance  
level  of  the  Levene’s  test  (F  =  4.2,  p  <  0.05),  the 
assumption  of  homogeneity  of  variances  was  rejected 
(Table 5). However, since the groups were the same size, 
the  former  violation,  and 
they  were  resistant 
parametric  analyses  could  be  performed.26  For  all 
research  variables, 
test  statistics  of 
the  value  of 
interaction  between  pre-test  and  post-test  groups  was 
statistically  significant  (p  ˂  0.01),  and  the  condition  of 
regression slope balance for analysis of covariance was 
also  established  (Table  6).  Test  results  of  between-
subject  effects  also  showed  that,  after  adjusting  the 
effects of the pre-test, the F value of the group became 
significant (F = 45.24; p ˂ 0.001); (F = 29.42; p ˂ 0.001).  
As  can  be  seen,  the  difference  in  the  mean  score  of 
loneliness and irrational beliefs of the subjects between 

to 

the  control  group  and  both  ACT  and  ET  groups  was 
significant (p ˂ 0.001) (Table 7). Therefore, it can be said 
that ET and ACT had a considerably positive effect on 
loneliness  and  irrational  beliefs.  Also,  there  was  a 
negligible difference between the ET and ACT groups. 
In other words, ET and ACT could affect the feeling of 
loneliness  and  irrational  beliefs  of  the  subjects  to  the 
same extent. 

Discussion 
The  results  of  data  analysis  showed  that,  compared  to 
the  control  group,  the  effects  of  ET  and  ACT  were 
significant on the variables of loneliness and irrational 
beliefs  (almost  no  difference  between  the  two  latter 
therapies).  These  findings  were  consistent  with  the 
results of previous studies.27-32 According to Hayes and 
Strosahl,33  as  a  person  enters  the  ACT  process,  their 
in  negative  mental-verbal  processes 
involvement 
focusing  on  themselves  and  others  improves  and 
changes  gradually.  In  the  ACT,  healing  can  be  well 
enhanced through avoiding anxiety and  worry, freeing 
oneself from the past and bitter experiences, living in the 
present, and emphasizing values and committed action 
to reduce stress. Also, the underlying idea of ACT is to 
accept  what  is  beyond  our  control  and  will.34  In 
therapeutic  processes  based  on  acceptance  and 
commitment,  it  is  very  likely  that  a  person  pursues 
committed and value-oriented actions in different areas 
simultaneously.35  ACT  can  help  a  person  experience

less stress by increasing self-awareness and self-control 
and  prevent  stress  by  acceptance  training.  In  this 
therapy, individuals are taught to respond to problems 
and issues with greater acceptance, non-judgment, lack 
of 
intellectual  conflict,  and  cognitive-behavioral 
flexibility.  Further,  ACT  allows  individuals  to  change 
relationships  with  their  inner  experiences  in  the  first 
place, reduce empirical avoidance, increase  flexibility, 
and  rise  worthy  actions.  Changing  relationships  with 
inner  experiences  involves  expanding  and  clarifying 
inner  consciousness.  In  addition,  it  emphasizes  the 
strengthening  of  a  non-judgmental  and  compassionate 
relationship with experiences. Self-correction (a concept 
that  contradicts  the  judgment  and  criticism  most 
authorities  have  of  their  thoughts  and  feelings)  is  an 
important aspect of this treatment to reduce reactivity, 
fear, and misplaced judgments. Finally, the goal of this 
treatment  is  to  experience  thoughts,  feelings,  and 
emotions  as  they  occur  naturally.33 Moreover,  ET  and

Logotherapy  has  been  able  to  reduce  feelings  of 
loneliness by helping subjects to discover their true self, 
choose  personal  values,  and  find  meaning  in  their 
lives.24  One  of  the  elements  of  high  self-esteem  is  to 
have valuable goals and strive to achieve them. Since the 
most important goal of the subjects selected during ET 
is  to  achieve  meaning,  acceptance,  and  responsibility, 
they  can  increase  self-esteem  effectively.  In  fact,  a 
person 
acceptance, 
responsibility,  and  meaning  can  acquire  feelings  and 
thoughts  such  as  belonging,  planning,  ability 
to 
influence,  problem-solving,  and  effort.36  One  of  the 
characteristics  of  people  with  irrational  beliefs  is  the 
cognitive fusion that happens when a person thinks their 
thoughts  are  always  correct.  In  fact,  many  problems 
arise  from  focusing  on  the  texture  of  depressive 
thoughts.37  Therefore,  we  addressed  the  thoughts  and 
feelings that led to undesirable behaviors of the subjects, 
which  reduced  their  credibility  and  flexibility.  Thus, 
metaphors,  exercises,  contradictions,  and  language 
conventions  of  ACT  were  used  in  this  context  to 
describe that the mind cannot have all the answers and 
distinguish  between  itself  and  its  thoughts.  Cognitive 
disruption skills worked on judgments, interpretations,

to  separate 

themselves  from 

and predictions. In fact, the hidden function of language 
was  revealed  to  the  subjects,  and  the  authorities  were 
instructed 
thoughts, 
emotions,  and  feelings.  Ruminants  and  repetitive 
thought patterns are characteristics of depressed people, 
which put them out of touch with the present  moment 
and take them into a negative past or future. Despite that 
a  depressed  person  may  want  to  have  a  warm 
relationship, they do not go out and meet people because 
they  may  constantly  think  about  how  people  have 
mistreated them in the past. Although rumination seems 
to  be  more  focused  on  the  past,  the  high  rate  of 
concurrence  of  depression  and  anxiety  disorders 
indicates  that  depressed  clients  are  often  preoccupied 
with  the  future.38  As  one  of  the  dimensions  of  ACT, 
being in the present was emphasized in therapy sessions, 
whereby  the  subjects  could  realize  their  depressive 
thoughts. In this regard, meditation was used to enable 
them to return to the present moment and separate from 
rumination and, in turn, they were able to get a feeling 
of  changeability  and  reduce  irrational  beliefs.  The 
that  mortality  and 
implies 
existential  approach 
transience are not only the main features of life but also 
key factors in its meaning. Following the group process, 
the individual becomes aware that although they cannot 
change the real conditions of life, they can vary coping 
ways  from  despair  and  fruitlessness  —one  of  the 
components of lack of mental health— to the flourishing 
and  excellence  of  individuality  by  giving  meaning  to 
how  the  self  is.  People  face  new  challenges  related  to 
independence,  education,  social  communication,  and 
issues imposed by a new environment in the absence of 
family.  These  changes  may  lead  to  increased  stress, 
prevalence  of  adaptation  problems,  decreased  mental 
health,  and  reduced  overall  performance.  Throughout 
the  process,  the  group  members  identify  and  explore 
these  issues,  concerns,  values,  and  perspectives  on 
themselves and their lives to be changed so as to provide 
creative attitudes, worldviews, and values appropriate to 
their situation.  Therefore, the most prominent feature of 
this  approach  is  the  emphasis  on  the  therapeutic 
relationship  and  its  role  in  bringing  about  a  change  in 
clients.15,16  
Limitations  of  the  research  were  related  to  examining 
the follow-up stage of the subjects due to lack of access 
and  cooperation  of 
the  subjects,  examining  and 
controlling variables such as a history of substance use 
and  psychiatry,  and  investigating  other  evaluation 
methods  such  as  interview.  It  is  suggested  that  they 
should  be  addressed  in  future  research.  The  results  of 
data  analysis  showed  that  the  effects  of  ET  and  ACT 
were similarly significant on the variables of loneliness 
and irrational beliefs. Indeed, humans are born with the 
need for communication and intimacy, and feelings of 
isolation and loneliness can be the main focus of many 
disorders, especially for prisoners, which can be related 
to  irrational  beliefs.  Based  on  ET,  prisoners  in  these 
situations  can  find  meaning  in  life,  choose  their 

reactions freely to the situations ahead, and responsibly 
accept the consequences of their actions and choices. On 
the other hand, they realize that problems are inevitable 
and there is only one opportunity left in this situation, 
i.e.,  changing  their  attitude  and  approach  towards  the 
problem, enduring the suffering, and spending their time 
on  improving  the  quality  of  life  due  to  the  transient 
nature of life. These changes can give them new insights 
and  also  affect  their  irrational  beliefs  and  feelings  of 
loneliness.  ACT  helps  prisoners  define  more  valuable 
goals  in  their  lives  and  put  their  energy  into  more 
transcendent  activities.  Changing  relationships  with 
inner  experiences  involves  expanding  and  clarifying 
inner  consciousness,  which  can  ultimately  lead  to  the 
development of external relationships, reduce irrational 
beliefs, and free one from loneliness.
