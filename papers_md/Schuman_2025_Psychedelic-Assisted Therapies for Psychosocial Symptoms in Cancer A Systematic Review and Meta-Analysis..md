Simple Summary

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined whether psychedelic-assisted thera-
pies, especially psilocybin and ketamine, can reduce psychological distress like anxiety,
depression, and existential suffering in adults with cancer. Eleven randomized controlled
trials and four open-label studies were included. Meta-analyses showed that ketamine led
to rapid, large reductions in depression and anxiety shortly after treatment, while psilocy-
bin also showed large potential benefits but with higher variability across studies. Trials
using psilocybin included structured psychotherapy, whereas ketamine was given without
therapy. Early evidence from small studies of other psychedelic agents suggests possible
benefits for distress in cancer patients, but more rigorous research is needed. Overall, while
psychedelic-assisted therapies appear promising and well-tolerated, evidence certainty
remains low due to small sample sizes, methodological differences, and limited long-term
data. Larger, well-designed trials focused specifically on cancer populations are needed to
clarify how best to integrate these treatments into oncology care.

Abstract

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates (1) the effectiveness of psychedelic-
assisted therapy (PAT) using psilocybin and ketamine for psychosocial symptoms in adults
with cancer, (2) contextualizes findings with non-randomized and exploratory studies of
other psychedelics, and (3) examines the role of therapeutic frameworks in shaping out-
comes. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and EMBASE (2000–2024) for
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies investigating psychedelic
agents in cancer populations. Meta-analyses pooled RCTs of psilocybin or ketamine using
random-effects models. Non-randomized studies were synthesized narratively. Risk of bias
and evidence certainty were assessed via Cochrane ROB 2.0, NIH Before–After tool, and
GRADE. Eleven placebo-controlled RCTs and four single open-label studies were included.
Meta-analysis of four ketamine RCTs (n = 354) showed large, rapid effects on depres-
sion/anxiety (Hedges’ g = −1.37, 95% CI: −2.66 to −0.08; I2 = 92%). Three psilocybin RCTs
(n = 101) showed a large effect of psilocybin on alleviating depression (Hedges’ g = −3.13,
95% CI: −10.04 to 3.77; I2 = 95%). MDMA and LSD trials suggested promise but lacked
rigor. PAT may offer meaningful relief for cancer-related distress, though effects vary by
therapeutic model and context. Oncology-specific trials are needed to standardize and
scale for implementation.

1. Introduction

Psychosocial symptoms such as depression, anxiety, demoralization, and existential
distress are common among individuals living with or beyond cancer. Across cancer types
and stages, 23–46% of patients report clinically significant distress [1]. These symptoms
are associated with poorer treatment adherence, decreased quality of life, and increased
morbidity and mortality [2,3]. While pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions
are often used to manage these symptoms, a substantial proportion of patients remain
refractory to conventional care or experience only partial relief [3]. As a result, there is
growing interest in novel interventions that can address both the emotional and existential
dimensions of suffering experienced by people living with cancer (PLWC).

Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) has re-emerged as a promising intervention in
this context. Historically investigated for their therapeutic potential in the mid-20th cen-
tury, psychedelics such as psilocybin, ketamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA), and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are now being re-evaluated for their
ability to alleviate psychological distress when administered in controlled, supportive
settings [4–7]. Among these, psilocybin and ketamine have garnered the most clinical atten-
tion in oncology. Psilocybin, a serotonergic psychedelic, is often delivered with structured
psychotherapy and has shown sustained reductions in depression, anxiety, and existential
distress in patients with advanced cancer [8,9]. Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist,
has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects for PLWC, typically administered with-
out integrated psychotherapeutic support, particularly in perioperative or palliative care
contexts [10–12].

The renewed focus on psychedelics stems from accumulating evidence suggesting that
these agents can promote profound psychological experiences, emotional breakthroughs,
and cognitive flexibility, all of which may contribute to durable improvements in well-
being [13,14]. However, important challenges persist. These include small sample sizes,
inconsistent outcome measures, and variable therapeutic protocols, as well as regulatory
and ethical hurdles that complicate widespread clinical integration [15,16].

Currently, there remains a lack of focused synthesis of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) assessing the efficacy of PAT for psychosocial outcomes specifically in cancer popu-
lations. Prior reviews [17–19] have often included diverse patient groups with advanced
illness and pooled data across a range of psychedelic agents and therapeutic indications.
While this provides valuable insight into the broader potential of psychedelic therapies,
such heterogeneity limits interpretability for oncology-specific clinical decision-making.
While early findings are promising, individuals with cancer represent a clinically and
ethically complex population due to heightened emotional, physical, and existential vul-
nerability. As such, a focused synthesis of the evidence is needed to evaluate not only
therapeutic potential but also the appropriateness and safety of PAT in this sensitive context.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of
psilocybin- and ketamine-assisted therapies in reducing psychosocial symptoms among
adults with cancer or undergoing cancer-related treatment in a meta-analysis, (2) compare
delivery models and therapeutic contexts used across trials, and (3) narratively synthe-
size findings from additional non-randomized and exploratory studies involving other

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

psychedelic agents such as MDMA and LSD. In doing so, this review provides a compre-
hensive and contextualized understanding of the role of PAT in psychosocial oncology.

2. Materials and Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [20]. The
protocol of this study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251016889).

2.1. Eligibility Criteria

(off active treatment), experiencing psychosocial symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression,
existential distress).
Intervention: Psychedelic agents (psilocybin, ketamine, LSD, or MDMA) administered
in therapeutic settings, with or without structured psychotherapy.
Comparator: Placebo (e.g., saline, niacin) or active control (e.g., low-dose psyched-
elic, midazolam).
Outcomes: Quantitative psychosocial outcomes (e.g., validated depression/anxiety scales)

8.

Exclusion Criteria: Observational studies, qualitative only reports, or non-English

publications.

2.2. Information Sources and Search Strategy

A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed,
PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, to identify relevant studies. The search strat-
egy incorporated terms related to both psychedelic therapies and psychosocial symptoms
in cancer patients. The initial search was performed from database inception through July
2022. To ensure the inclusion of newly published studies, the search was updated again in
September 2024. Key search terms included:

1.

2.

Terms for psychedelic therapies (e.g., “psychedelic*”, “psychedelic therapy*”, “psilo-
cybin”, “ketamine”, “MDMA”, “LSD” and “ayahuasca”)
Terms for psychosocial symptoms (e.g., “anxiety”, “depression”, “psychological dis-
tress”, “emotional distress”).
Terms for cancer patients (e.g., “oncology”, “cancer survivor*”, “cancer patient*”).

2.3. Study Selection

The selection process involved two stages: initial screening of titles and abstracts,
followed by a full-text review. Two independent reviewers assessed the studies at each
stage based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through
discussion, and a third reviewer was consulted if necessary.

2.4. Data Extraction

Data were extracted independently and in duplicate by two reviewers (H.D.M.S. and
C.S.) using a standardized and piloted data extraction form, developed in accordance with
PRISMA 2020 guidelines [20]. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or adjudication
by a third reviewer (R.M.). For each included study, the following data items were extracted:
Study Characteristics: First author, publication year, country, trial phase, study design

(e.g., RCT, open-label; blinded), and journal.

1.

2.

3.

Participant Information: Sample size, mean age and standard deviation, sex distri-
bution, cancer type, cancer stage (e.g., advanced/metastatic), and treatment context
(e.g., perioperative, palliative, curative).
Intervention Details: Psychedelic agent (e.g., psilocybin, ketamine, MDMA, LSD),
dose and dosing regimen, administration route, frequency, setting, and presence or
absence of structured psychotherapeutic support (e.g., preparation, integration).
Comparator (for RCTs): Nature of the control condition (e.g., placebo, active compara-
tor such as niacin or midazolam).

4. Outcome Measures: Primary and secondary outcomes related to psychosocial dis-
tress (e.g., depression, anxiety, existential distress), including validated measurement
instruments and timing of assessments (e.g., Day 1, 1 week, 6 months).
Results: Mean and standard deviation at each timepoint for experimental and control
groups (if applicable), effect estimates (e.g., Hedges’ g), response/remission rates, and
p-values.

5.

6. Adverse Events: Any reported serious or non-serious adverse effects, including

dropouts related to tolerability or safety.

For missing or unclear data, attempts were made to extract the most conservative
or methodologically appropriate estimate. If outcomes were measured at multiple time-
points, the most clinically relevant post-intervention measure was selected for synthe-
sis (e.g., first post-dose result for immediate effects, or longest available follow-up for
durability assessment).

2.5. Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of bias (RoB) was independently assessed by two reviewers (HS and CS) for all
included studies. For RCTs, the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool was used, examining five domains:
randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data,
measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results [21]. Non-randomized
studies were assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

5 of 31

Tool for Before-After (Pre-Post) Studies without a control group, covering 12 domains
including clarity of the study question, eligibility criteria, outcome measurement, statistical
methods, and adequacy of follow-up [22]. Any discrepancies between reviewers were
resolved through discussion and consensus. The comprehensive RoB assessments are
detailed in Figure 1 and Table 1.

Figure 1. Risk of Bias assessment for included studies using the Cochrane RoB.2 tool under an
Intention-to-Treat (ITT) analysis approach [21]. The summary plot displays risk assessments across
five domains. Green indicates low risk, yellow indicates some concerns, and red indicates high risk.

2.6. Meta-Analyses of Controlled Psychedelic Trials
2.6.1. Study Selection and Outcome Measures

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of ketamine or psilocybin
(1–3 days post-ketamine; 2–7 weeks post-psilocybin) on psychosocial symptoms (e.g., de-
pression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, existential distress) in adults with cancer or undergoing
cancer-related surgery. Eligible studies were RCTs published in English that compared
ketamine, esketamine, or psilocybin to a placebo or active comparator, and reported psy-
chosocial outcomes using validated instruments (e.g., Montgomery-Asberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS)). Outcomes were included if means, standard deviations (SDs), and
sample sizes were reported or derivable.

For psilocybin crossover trials, only pre-crossover timepoints were used to avoid
carryover effects and maintain independent group comparisons. When multiple timepoints
were reported, the earliest post-treatment data (typically 2–7 weeks) were selected to
improve comparability across studies.

2.6.2. Data Extraction for Meta-Analysis

Data were extracted on study characteristics, intervention details, comparator condi-
tions, sample size, blinding and outcome measures. Where multiple psychosocial outcomes
were reported for a single study cohort, only the most comprehensive and relevant measure
of psychological distress was included to avoid unit-of-analysis error. For instance, in Fan
et al. (2017), only the total MADRS score was included, while the Beck Scale for Suici-
dal Ideation (BSI) and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale—Suicidal Ideation
(MADRS-SI) subscales were excluded. Where means and standard deviations were not
reported, we used WebPlotDigitizer [26] to extract numerical data from figures.

Although our systematic search identified one RCT involving MDMA and two involv-
ing LSD, these studies were excluded from the quantitative synthesis due to methodological
heterogeneity, limited extractable data, and differences in dosing protocols and outcome
reporting. While LSD and psilocybin share a common mechanism as 5-HT2A receptor ago-
nists, variations in trial design and therapeutic frameworks limited comparability. MDMA,
which differs more substantially in both mechanism and application, was also synthesized
narratively. Only ketamine and psilocybin had multiple RCTs with sufficiently comparable
data to support meta-analysis.

Similarly, we chose not to include non-randomized studies in the meta-analysis to
preserve methodological rigor and avoid introducing bias from uncontrolled or single-arm
trial designs. These studies were instead synthesized narratively. While they provide
important insights, particularly regarding feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy,
their results are not directly comparable to those of RCTs and were not suitable for pooled
effect size estimation.

2.6.3. Meta-Analytic Procedures

Separate random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for ketamine and psilocybin
trials using the meta package in R (v8.0-2) [27–29]. Standardized mean differences (SMDs)
were calculated using Hedges’ g to account for small sample bias. Between-study variance
(τ2) was estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML), and Hartung-Knapp ad-
justments were used to produce conservative 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity
was quantified using the I2 statistic and Cochran’s Q test. For each substance, a forest plot
was generated to visualize individual and pooled effect sizes.

2.6.4. Sensitivity Considerations

To ensure robustness, we conducted the meta-analysis using only one outcome per
study and accounted for heterogeneity, imprecision, and methodological limitations in
interpreting the findings. The certainty of evidence for the pooled outcomes, as summa-
rized in Table 2, was assessed using the GRADE framework, which considers risk of bias,
inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and potential publication bias [30].

Symptoms in Individuals with Cancer [30].

1 Some concerns about risk of bias due to limited blinding and outcome measurement methods in individual trials.
2 Inconsistency is serious due to substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 92.1%) and variation in study populations and
outcome measures. 3 Imprecision is serious because the 95% confidence interval is wide and includes effect sizes
that range from potentially trivial to large. 4 Some concerns due to lack of blinding, crossover design, and reliance
on self-report measures in small trials. 5 Serious inconsistencies due to very high heterogeneity (I2 = 94.9%,
τ2 = 7.32), suggesting substantial variability in effect sizes. 6 Imprecision is serious due to wide 95% confidence
interval that crosses both no effect and large effect, despite total sample size exceeding 100.

3. Results
3.1. Study Selection

A total of 1860 records were identified through database searching. After removing
1440 duplicates, 420 unique records were screened based on titles and abstracts. Of these,
332 were excluded for failing to meet the eligibility criteria (see Section 2). Full-text
review was performed on the remaining 88 articles, ultimately resulting in 15 studies being
included in this systematic review. The PRISMA flow chart detailing the study selection
process is presented in Figure 2. A summary of the characteristics of the studies included is
provided in Table 3.

with cancer or disease [20]. This is a flow diagram showing the initial citations discovered, the
number of citations excluded after we applied our criteria, and the final number of studies included
in the review.

3.2. Study Characteristics

The final 15 studies encompassed randomized controlled trials (n = 11) and non-
randomized experimental designs (n = 4). Publication years ranged from 2011 to 2024, with
sample sizes varying from 12 to 303 participants. Majority of the studies included were
conducted in the United States (n = 7), followed by China (n = 5), Switzerland (n = 2), and
Canada (n = 1). Most trials focused on the use of psilocybin (five studies) and ketamine (four
studies), while three studies investigated MDMA or LSD. Participant populations included
individuals diagnosed with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or other advanced malignancies,
and in several cases, those with comorbid depression, anxiety, or existential distress.

3.3. Risk of Bias Assessments

The RoB for included studies is visually summarized in Figure 1 and detailed in

Table 1.

RCTs: Of the 11 RCTs assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool, most (n = 8, 73%)
demonstrated low overall RoB. Two studies (18%) presented some concerns, primarily due
to insufficient reporting of allocation concealment or minor deviations from intervention
protocols. One study (9%) was classified as high risk of bias due to issues related to
randomization processes and incomplete outcome reporting. Functional unblinding is
an acknowledged limitation in PAT trials due to the noticeable psychoactive effects of
substances such as psilocybin and LSD. While Schipper et al. [17] rated this as a high risk
of bias in several studies, we adopted a more pragmatic approach. We rated studies as low
risk in this domain when double-blinding procedures were followed, and no evidence of
differential care or co-intervention was reported. Although expectancy effects are plausible,

 Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

12 of 31

we judged bias based on observed or reported impact, rather than assumption alone, in
accordance with Cochrane RoB 2.0 recommendations [21].

Non-RCTs: The four single-arm pilot trials [12,23–25] satisfied key methodological
benchmarks—clear objectives, prespecified eligibility criteria, standardized psilocybin
or ketamine dosing, and validated mood-distress outcomes—earning overall fair ratings.
Their interpretability is curtailed by shared limitations: very small samples (n = 12–30),
open-label conduct without blinded assessors, variable transparency in reporting how
screened candidates translated into enrolled participants, and reliance on a single baseline
rather than an interrupted time-series. Retention was high across studies, with all dosed
participants included in endpoint analyses. Collectively, these structural constraints temper
internal validity and limit the generalizability of the promising efficacy signals.

3.4. Narrative Synthesis of Non-Randomized Studies and Exploratory Studies
3.4.1. Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy (Open-Label Studies)

Three open-label, non-randomized studies have examined the feasibility, safety, and
therapeutic potential of psilocybin-assisted group therapy in people with cancer experienc-
ing depression and psychosocial distress. These studies adopted a group-based delivery
model with preparatory and integration psychotherapy components and used a single high-
dose (25 mg) psilocybin session. While not randomized, each study reported significant
reductions in depressive symptoms and psychosocial burden, sustained improvements in
psycho-social-spiritual well-being, and a favorable safety profile.

Agrawal et al. [38] conducted a phase 2 open-label trial in 30 cancer patients with
major depressive disorder (MDD). By week 8, participants experienced a mean reduction of
19.1 points on the MADRS (95% CI: −22.3 to −16.0; p < 0.001), with an estimated Cohen’s
d of 2.55, indicating a very large treatment effect. Fifty percent of participants achieved
remission (MADRS < 10) by week 1, and 80% maintained a ≥50% reduction in symptoms
(treatment response) through week 8. Significant improvements were also reported on
secondary outcomes at week 8, including anxiety (HAM-A: −17.0; d = 1.78), depression
self-report (QIDS-SR: −5.9; d = 1.51), and trait/state anxiety (STAI-T: −17.2; d = 1.13; STAI-S:
−17.2; d = 1.35).

Shnayder et al. [23] conducted an open-label trial of psilocybin-assisted group ther-
apy in 30 cancer patients, assessing changes in psycho-social-spiritual well-being using
the National Institute of Health, Healing Experiences in All Life Stressors (NIH-HEALS)
instrument. At 8 weeks post-treatment, participants demonstrated significant improve-
ments across all three NIH-HEALS domains: Connection (+12.7%; p = 0.003), Reflection
& Introspection (+7.7%; p < 0.001), and Trust & Acceptance (+22.4%; p < 0.001). The total
NIH-HEALS score increased by an average of 16.4 points from baseline to week 8 (p < 0.001),
indicating sustained improvements in meaning, connectedness, and emotional acceptance
following psilocybin treatment.

Lewis et al. [24] (HOPE trial) conducted an open-label pilot study assessing the
feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy in
12 cancer patients with depressive symptoms. At the primary outcome timepoint (2 weeks),
depression severity measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) decreased
by 10.7 points (from a baseline mean of 21.5 to 10.8; p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.71), indicating
a large effect size. This reduction remained clinically meaningful at 26 weeks (d = 1.28). Six
participants (50%) achieved remission (HAM-D < 7), while 67% experienced a ≥7-point
reduction in symptoms, considered a clinically substantial response. The observed change
exceeded thresholds for minimal clinically important difference, typically estimated at
3–6 points for HAM-D. Secondary outcomes at 2 weeks showed improvements in emotional
(d = 0.63), functional (d = 0.78), and spiritual well-being (e.g., spiritual peace d = 0.85)

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-
Being Scale (FACIT-Sp). The mystical experience questionnaire (MEQ-30) was significantly
correlated with improvements in depression (r = −0.71, p = 0.015). Half of participants met
criteria for a complete mystical experience.

Open-label studies of psilocybin-assisted group therapy in individuals with cancer
experiencing depression or psychosocial distress demonstrate strong preliminary sup-
port for feasibility, safety, and therapeutic benefit. Across three trials, a single high-dose
psilocybin session paired with group-based psychotherapy led to large and sustained
reductions in depressive symptoms, alongside improvements in anxiety, emotional and
spiritual well-being, and psycho-social-spiritual integration. High remission and response
rates were reported, and therapeutic outcomes were often correlated with the intensity of
mystical-type experiences. While findings are limited by non-randomized designs, they
offer compelling early evidence supporting the group delivery model and warrant further
investigation in controlled trials.

3.4.2. Long-Term Follow-Up

Ross et al. [39] conducted a long-term follow-up of their 2016 RCT, one of the three
psilocybin studies included in our meta-analysis [9]. While the meta-analysis focused on
short-term outcomes (pre-crossover, 7-week data), this follow-up evaluated the persistence
of therapeutic effects at 6.5 months, 3.2 years, and 4.5 years post-treatment.

Sustained reductions in psychological distress were observed across multiple domains.
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale—Total (HADS-T), used as the primary out-
come in our pooled analysis, decreased from a baseline mean of 16.45 (±1.32) to 4.38
(±1.35) at 6.5–8 months, with continued improvements at 3.2 and 4.5 years (7.13 and 7.34,
respectively) [40]. Reductions in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores, State-Trait Anx-
iety Inventory (STAI) scores, demoralization, hopelessness, and death anxiety were also
maintained over time.

In addition to these affective outcomes, participants showed significant improvements
in spiritual well-being as measured by the FACIT-Sp and reported enduring reductions
in suicidal ideation. Importantly, the majority of participants (71–100%) identified their
psilocybin session as among the most spiritually meaningful or personally significant
experiences of their lives.

3.4.3. Ketamine-Assisted Therapy (Open-Label Study)

Rosenblat et al. [12] conducted a single-arm, open-label phase II trial evaluating the
feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of intranasal racemic ketamine (50–150 mg across
three doses over one week) in 20 advanced cancer patients with moderate-to-severe MDD.
The primary outcome, clinician-rated depression severity (MADRS), decreased significantly
from a baseline mean of 31.0 (SD 7.6) to 11.0 (SD 7.4) at Day 8 (mean change: −20.0; 95%
CI: −24.7 to −15.3; p < 0.001), representing a large effect size. By Day 8, 70% achieved
antidepressant response (≥50% reduction in MADRS) and 45% met remission criteria
(MADRS < 10). Improvements were partially sustained at Day 14 (mean MADRS = 14.0,
SD 9.9) without additional dosing.

Secondary outcomes included significant reductions in patient-reported depression
(PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) from baseline to Day 8 (p < 0.001), with no significant change
in pain scores (ESAS-r). The intervention was well tolerated; the most frequent adverse
events were dysgeusia (50%), dizziness (30%), dissociation (30%), and nausea (20%). Most
adverse effects were mild and resolved within two hours post-dose. One participant
discontinued due to dissociation. These findings suggest a rapid and robust antidepressant
effect of ketamine with acceptable tolerability in this population.

3.4.4. Exploratory Evidence: MDMA and LSD

A small subset of exploratory trials examined the effects of other psychedelics, specifi-
cally MDMA and LSD, in populations with cancer or life-threatening illness (LTI). These
studies, while not included in the meta-analysis due to design or sample size limitations,
provide important context for the evolving evidence base.

MDMA-Assisted Therapy

Wolfson et al. [37] conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial
evaluating MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for individuals with LTI experiencing anxiety
and psychological distress (n = 18; MDMA = 13, placebo = 5). Ninety-four percent of
participants had a primary diagnosis of neoplasms, i.e., cancer. The intervention consisted
of two blinded MDMA (125 mg ± 62.5 mg supplemental) or placebo sessions, alongside
preparatory and integrative psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint (one-month post-
second session), the MDMA group demonstrated greater reductions in trait anxiety (STAI-
Trait: −23.5 vs. −8.8 points), with a large between-group effect size (Hedges’ g = 1.03),
though this narrowly missed statistical significance (p = 0.056). Removal of one potential
placebo outlier yielded a significant difference (p = 0.0066). Secondary outcomes favored
MDMA on measures of post-traumatic growth (∆ = 12.9 vs. −2.6, p = 0.04, g = 0.50) and
mindfulness (∆ = 0.4 vs. 0, p = 0.04, g = 0.67). While improvements were observed in
depression (BDI-II), sleep quality (PSQI), and global functioning (GAF), these differences
did not reach statistical significance in the blinded comparison.

LSD-Assisted Therapy

Gasser et al. [35] conducted a randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled
pilot trial of LSD-assisted psychotherapy in 12 individuals with LTI (majority with cancer)
and anxiety. Participants received two LSD sessions (200 µg) or active placebo (low dose
of LSD 20 µg), alongside preparatory and integrative psychotherapy. At the 2-month
primary endpoint, the LSD group showed large reductions in state and trait anxiety
(STAI-S: −19.2 vs. −2.7; STAI-T: −16.2 vs. −1.1), with between-group effect sizes of Co-
hen’s d = 1.1–1.2, though statistical power was limited. Improvements were sustained at
12-month follow-up.

Holze et al. [36] conducted a phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
trial in 42 patients with anxiety, 48% of whom had a LTI and 26% a cancer diagnosis.
Participants received a single 200 µg oral dose of LSD or placebo in a crossover design. At
16-week follow-up, LSD produced significant reductions in anxiety (STAI-Global: p < 0.001),
depressive symptoms (HAM-D, BDI: p < 0.001), and global psychopathology [35] (SCL-90-
R: p < 0.001), with large within-subject effects. Acute mystical-type experiences (MEQ-30,
5D-ASC) were significantly correlated with long-term symptom improvement.

Exploratory trials of MDMA- and LSD-assisted therapy in individuals with cancer or
LTI suggest promising effects on anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Though
limited by small samples and early-phase designs, both agents demonstrated large effect
sizes and sustained improvements, particularly when integrated with psychotherapy.
These preliminary findings support the potential role of both classic (LSD) and non-classic
(MDMA) psychedelics in cancer-related psychosocial care and underscore the need for
larger, well-powered trials that are cancer-specific.

3.5. Meta-Analytic Results
3.5.1. Ketamine

Four RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis, comprising 354 participants
(179 in the ketamine or esketamine groups and 175 in the control groups). Each study

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

15 of 31

evaluated the short-term effects, defined as outcomes measured within one to three days
following a single subanaesthetic dose, of intravenous ketamine (racemic or S-enantiomer)
on psychosocial symptoms in adults with cancer [32,34] or undergoing cancer-related
surgery [10,33]. Validated instruments were used to measure depression and psychological
distress, with primary outcomes including the MADRS, 17-item Hamilton Depression
Rating Scale (HAM-D-17), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale—Depression subscale
(HAD-D), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).

A random-effects meta-analysis using Hedges’ g demonstrated a large and statistically
significant effect favoring ketamine over control (Hedges’ g = −1.37; 95% CI: −2.66 to
−0.08; p = 0.043). However, heterogeneity across studies was considerable (I2 = 92.1%,
τ2 = 0.60), indicating substantial variability in effect sizes, potentially due to differences
in dosing strategies, clinical populations (e.g., perioperative vs. outpatient), or outcome
measurement timing. A forest plot of individual and pooled effect sizes is presented in
Figure 3.

3.5.2. Psilocybin

Three RCTs comprising 101 participants (50 in psilocybin groups and 51 in control
groups) were included in the meta-analysis evaluating the short-term effects of psilocybin-
assisted therapy on psychosocial symptoms in individuals with cancer. Each study eval-
uated short term effects at different timepoints ranging between 2 weeks and 7 weeks
following the administration of psilocybin. All included trials evaluated the effects of
psilocybin administered in a structured therapeutic setting with patients that had advanced
or life-threatening cancer and clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, or
existential distress. While some trials involved more than one dosing session, only data
from the first session and pre-crossover timepoints were extracted for meta-analysis to
avoid unit-of-analysis errors associated with repeated measures and crossover designs.

The selected outcome measures included the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(GRID-HAMD-17) in Griffiths et al. [8], the BDI in Grob et al. [31] and the HADS-T in Ross
et al. [9]. These instruments, while differing in scope and scoring ranges, each capture core
elements of psychological distress and were selected as the most comprehensive outcome
for each trial. Higher scores on each scale indicate greater symptom severity.

Figure 3. Forest plot of the effects of ketamine or esketamine on psychosocial symptoms in PLWC
(random-effects model) [10,32–34]. This forest plot presents Hedges’ g for each included RCT
comparing ketamine or esketamine to a control (saline or midazolam). The size of each square
represents the weight of the study under the random-effects model. The horizontal lines indicate 95%
confidence intervals. The blue diamond represents the pooled effect estimate. A negative effect size
indicates greater reduction in symptoms for the ketamine group.

A random-effects meta-analysis using Hedges’ g was conducted to account for vari-
ability in sample sizes and outcome measures. The pooled effect estimate demonstrated a
large, non-significant benefit of psilocybin compared to control, with Hedges’ g = −3.13

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

16 of 31

(95% CI: −10.04 to 3.77, p = 0.190). Heterogeneity across studies was substantial (I2 = 94.9%,
τ2 = 7.32), indicating marked differences in effect sizes. The common effect model yielded
a significant result (Hedges’ g = −2.38, 95% CI: −2.97 to −1.80, p < 0.0001), though this
model does not account for between-study variability.

Griffiths et al. [41] contributed disproportionately to both the magnitude of the pooled
effect and the observed heterogeneity. That study reported an exceptionally large between-
group effect (Hedges’ g = −6.39) and a narrow standard deviation in the psilocybin group,
suggesting highly consistent improvements. These findings occurred in a context that
included high-dose psilocybin administration and intensive psychotherapeutic support,
which may not be representative of broader clinical practice. Influence diagnostics con-
firmed that Griffiths et al. [41] was an outlier in terms of standardized residuals, Cook’s
distance, and heterogeneity contribution.

Despite its influence, this trial was retained in the meta-analysis to preserve analytic
integrity and reflect the limited but important evidence base in this emerging field. A forest
plot illustrating individual and pooled effect sizes is presented in Figure 4.

Data are based on primary depression or psychological distress measures reported at the first post-
treatment timepoint prior to crossover. Total sample included 50 participants in psilocybin groups
and 51 in control groups.

3.6. Adverse Events Across Studies

No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported across the psilocybin RCTs
or non-randomized studies included in this review. In Ross et al. [9] and Griffiths et al. [41],
transient increases in blood pressure, nausea, and brief anxiety episodes were documented
but resolved spontaneously and were consistent with expected acute psychedelic effects. In
the HOPE trial [24], participants reported mild nausea and headache; one case of sustained
gastrointestinal symptoms was attributed to a viral illness rather than psilocybin. Among
the ketamine studies, Rosenblat et al. [12] reported no serious adverse events. Minor side
effects, e.g., dissociation, dizziness, and nausea were transient and consistent with the
known pharmacological profile of ketamine. Holze et al. [36] reported a single serious
adverse event during the LSD condition (acute anxiety requiring temporary withdrawal),
which resolved within hours and did not require further medical intervention.

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

3.7. Therapeutic Support Across Trials

The therapeutic frameworks employed alongside psychedelic administration varied
substantially across studies and may have influenced treatment outcomes. All psilocybin
trials included in the meta-analysis incorporated structured psychological support, often
involving preparatory and integrative sessions with trained therapists. For example,
Griffiths et al. [41] and Ross et al. [9] used a manualized approach that included several
hours of preparatory counseling, support during the dosing session, and post-session
integration. These sessions emphasized participant safety, introspection, and meaning
making, often guided by existential or spiritual psychotherapeutic principles.

In contrast, most ketamine trials did not include formal psychotherapy. Studies such
as Fan et al. [32], Ren et al. [33] Liu et al. [10], and Wang et al. [34] focused on pharma-
cological administration in hospital or surgical settings, with no manualized therapeutic
support. This distinction highlights a key divergence in how psychedelic-assisted therapy
is conceptualized across agents—psilocybin is typically embedded within a psychotherapy-
enhanced model, whereas ketamine is often delivered as a standalone pharmacologic
intervention in medical settings.

In the exploratory trials, MDMA-assisted therapy [37] followed the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) protocol, which included structured prepara-
tion, non-directive support during the 8 h MDMA session, and follow-up integration [37].
Similarly, LSD-assisted psychotherapy [35,36] emphasized therapeutic containment, in-
volving preparatory counseling, supported dosing sessions, and continued psychological
follow-up. These models reflect a more psycholytic or experiential framework, blending
pharmacologic effects with therapeutic processing.

Among the open-label studies, psilocybin was consistently administered in conjunc-
tion with psychotherapeutic support. Agrawal et al. [25], Lewis et al. [24], and Shnayder
et al. [23] all utilized group-based or individual therapy sessions before, during, and after
dosing. These studies emphasized safety, group cohesion, and integration of insights,
typically delivered by trained clinicians in supportive environments. Similarly, Rosen-
blat et al. [12] administered intranasal ketamine to patients in palliative care without
accompanying psychotherapy but did include supportive clinical oversight and monitor-
ing. See Table A1 in Appendix B for a breakdown of therapeutic approaches used across
included studies.

4. Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide updated and focused evidence on
the efficacy of psilocybin- and ketamine-assisted therapies in reducing psychosocial symp-
toms among individuals with cancer. Across included RCTs both agents were associated
with large reductions in psychological distress, including depression and anxiety. While the
pooled effect sizes were substantial, heterogeneity was high—particularly for psilocybin,
where one outlying trial [8] substantially influenced the variance structure. Nevertheless,
sensitivity analyses and influence diagnostics supported the robustness of the observed
therapeutic effects.

Narrative synthesis of open-label and exploratory trials complemented the quantita-
tive findings, particularly in highlighting the durability of psilocybin’s psychological and
existential benefits over time (e.g., [39,40]). Open-label studies demonstrated feasibility
and scalability across delivery models, including group-based approaches with high ther-
apist efficiency [24,25], and showed large, sustained reductions in depressive symptoms.
Improvements extended beyond mood to encompass psycho-social-spiritual well-being,
with notable gains in domains such as meaning, connection, and peace [23]. Similarly,
non-randomized ketamine studies such as Rosenblat et al. [12] reinforced RCT findings

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

18 of 31

by demonstrating rapid-onset, clinically meaningful antidepressant effects within days of
administration, even in late-stage palliative care. These studies underscore the potential for
fast-acting, short-course interventions in oncology settings.

Early trials of MDMA- and LSD-assisted psychotherapy suggest emerging therapeutic
value for alleviating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in PLWC and other LTI.
Although none of the included RCTs were exclusively oncology-focused, each enrolled
participants with advanced-stage cancer [35–37]. Findings highlight large within-group
effects and associations between mystical-type or integrative experiences and clinical im-
provement. The therapeutic benefit of these agents appears tightly coupled to structured
psychotherapeutic support, including MAPS protocols for MDMA and psycholytic frame-
works for LSD [35]. Despite promising signals, regulatory constraints, including Schedule I
status and the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) non-approval of MDMA for
PTSD [42], continue to impede oncology-specific research and clinical implementation.

Despite promising effect sizes, the overall certainty of evidence from RCTs evaluating
psilocybin and ketamine remains low. GRADE assessments highlighted concerns due to
significant heterogeneity, imprecision, and methodological limitations, including small
sample sizes, inadequate blinding procedures, and variability in therapeutic approaches.
The Cochrane RoB 2 assessment indicated a low risk of bias across RCT domains, though
some concerns persisted regarding outcome measurement and selective reporting. Concur-
rently, NIH quality appraisals of non-randomized studies indicated fair methodological
rigor but consistently identified limitations related to insufficient sample size justification,
open-label designs, and reliance on a single baseline observation rather than an interrupted
time-series. Collectively, these methodological weaknesses limit the interpretability of
findings and highlight the critical need for larger, more rigorous, standardized, and scalable
trials to guide clinical practice in oncology populations.

4.1. Divergent Therapeutic Paradigms: Experiential vs. Pharmacologic Models

A key finding of this review is the divergent therapeutic paradigms employed across
PAT trials. Psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD were consistently delivered within structured
psychotherapeutic frameworks that emphasized preparation, emotional support during
dosing, and post-session integration. This psychospiritual model aligns with the “set
and setting” hypothesis, which posits that the therapeutic effects of psychedelics are
strongly mediated by psychological and environmental context [43]. Trials using the MAPS
protocol [37] or psycholytic techniques [35] reflect this experiential paradigm, aiming to
catalyze enduring emotional and existential insights.

Notably, however, few psychedelic trials in oncology have adopted fully manualized
psychotherapeutic frameworks, such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) [44],
acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that
are otherwise well-established in psycho-oncology settings [45]. This may reflect both
practical and philosophical factors: the dominant experiential paradigm in PAT favors
individualized, non-directive support over protocolized techniques. Yet the absence of
structured, reproducible therapeutic models limits opportunities for standardization, fi-
delity monitoring, and comparative effectiveness research.

By contrast, ketamine was typically administered as a standalone pharmacologic
intervention, often in perioperative, hospital, or palliative care settings, with little or no
structured psychotherapeutic support. Studies such as Fan et al. [32], Ren et al. [33], and
Wang et al. [34] illustrate this biomedical orientation, prioritizing rapid symptom relief for
acute psychological crises. While ketamine’s dissociative effects and NMDA antagonism
contribute to its antidepressant efficacy, the absence of a therapeutic container may limit
its impact on deeper existential suffering. This divergence also raises a broader defini-

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

19 of 31

tional debate: should ketamine be considered a psychedelic at all? Unlike serotonergic
psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin, LSD), ketamine operates through glutamatergic pathways
and typically produces a dissociative rather than a classic hallucinogenic experience. Al-
though some classify it as a “non-classical psychedelic” due to its capacity to induce altered
states of consciousness, others argue that its mechanisms and subjective effects are funda-
mentally distinct [46,47]. This distinction is not merely semantic; it has implications for
therapeutic delivery. The psychospiritual emphasis central to psilocybin trials may not
translate directly to ketamine protocols, which often focus on neurochemical modulation
over meaning-making [39].

Marguilho et al. [47] propose that the fast, albeit transient, antidepressant effects
observed after ketamine infusions are mainly driven by its acute modulation of reward
circuits and sub-acute increase in neuroplasticity, while its dissociative and psychedelic
properties are driven by dose- and context-dependent disruption of large-scale functional
networks. Wolfson and Vaid [48] emphasize that when ketamine experiences are embedded
in a therapeutic relationship, they can foster personal growth, inner healing, and better
relationships. However, the absence of structured psychotherapeutic support in many
clinical settings may limit these benefits. Future research should continue to clarify the
experiential, mechanistic, and therapeutic boundaries between ketamine and classical
psychedelics to guide appropriate clinical application.

4.2. The Therapeutic Container as a Mediator of Outcomes

These distinct paradigms influence treatment outcomes. The sustained improvements
observed in psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD trials may be partly attributable to psychother-
apeutic integration [39,40]. By contrast, ketamine’s effects are often short-lived, with
limited integration and ongoing concerns regarding long-term safety, including risks of
dependency, cystitis, and cognitive impairment [17,49].

This distinction is particularly salient in oncology, where patients often grapple with
existential concerns that extend beyond symptom control. Psilocybin’s integration with
psychotherapy appears well-suited for such needs, though it remains resource-intensive
and less scalable. Emerging models such as group-based psilocybin therapy [24,25], offer
promising alternatives, retaining therapeutic depth while enhancing accessibility. Similarly,
hybrid models like ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) may bridge the gap between
pharmacologic rapidity and psychospiritual depth, warranting further exploration in cancer
care [50].

4.3. Blinding Challenges and Comparator Heterogeneity

Blinding remains a critical methodological challenge in psychedelic clinical trials
due to the potent subjective effects of these agents. These effects, ranging from altered
perception and emotional breakthroughs to dissociation, can compromise the integrity of
double-blind designs, potentially inflating expectancy effects and undermining internal
validity [51,52].

In psilocybin trials, active placebos such as niacin or low-dose psilocybin have been
used to mimic physiological responses (e.g., flushing, tingling). However, such comparators
fail to replicate the profound psychoactive and often mystical experiences of moderate-
to-high dose psilocybin, making effective blinding challenging [9,31]. As Carhart-Harris
and Goodwin [53] and Aday et al. [52] emphasized, the vivid and unique nature of these
experiences makes them especially difficult to mask using traditional placebos, with partic-
ipants and therapists correctly guessing treatment allocation in over 90% of cases in some
trials [37,54].

Ketamine trials face similar limitations. While comparators such as midazolam or
saline are commonly employed, these agents fail to reproduce the dissociative effects
of ketamine, allowing for easy identification of the active condition [10,55]. Although
midazolam offers some sedation, it does not match ketamine’s perceptual alterations,
thereby introducing potential bias through expectancy [55–57]. Recent meta-research has
shown that when stronger blinding techniques (e.g., administration under anesthesia) are
used, ketamine’s effects may not differ significantly from placebo [58].

Beyond pharmacologic comparators, the integration of psychotherapy, standard in
most psilocybin trials, introduces further complexity. Participants in placebo conditions
still receive extensive therapeutic support, which may independently reduce symptoms
and blur between-group differences [9]. This confound is particularly relevant in trials
where the therapeutic container (set, setting, and therapeutic alliance) is theorized to be a
key mediator of efficacy.

To address these limitations, Aday et al. [52] proposed criteria for ideal active placebos
in psychedelic studies, including matched onset/duration, psychoactive and physiological
effects, safety, and absence of therapeutic efficacy in the target condition. Potential candi-
dates such as salvinorin A and dextromethorphan offer partial phenomenological overlap
with psychedelics and may enhance blinding fidelity [59,60]. THC and diphenhydramine
may serve as alternatives in lower-dose or microdosing trials but still present challenges,
particularly among participants familiar with their effects [61,62].

While rigorous trial design is essential for establishing safety and efficacy, efforts
to improve blinding raise important epistemological and cultural questions. The drive
to isolate drug-specific effects through active placebos may reflect a Western scientific
tendency to deconstruct holistic experiences into discrete, measurable components. Yet, in
many traditional and Indigenous healing contexts, the therapeutic value of psychedelics
is inseparable from their set (mental state), setting, and the broader ritual or spiritual
framework in which they are used [43,63,64]. Attempting to control for these elements may
inadvertently compromise the very mechanisms that contribute to healing. As the field
advances, it will be important to balance methodological rigor with cultural sensitivity and
openness to complexity.

In light of these issues, future trials should incorporate standardized assessments
of blinding and expectancy, and consider alternative trial designs such as dose–response
models, incomplete disclosure paradigms, pre-test/post-test, or pragmatic comparators
(e.g., psychotherapy-only arms) [52,65]. Such refinements are essential to disentangle
drug-specific effects from contextual influences and to uphold methodological rigor in this
rapidly evolving field.

4.4. Clinical Implications and Context-Specific Implementation

The global expansion of off-label ketamine use for cancer-related psychosocial distress
reflects both its rapid therapeutic potential and the urgent need for oncology-specific
evidence. In North America, ketamine is being used in palliative and private care settings
for treatment resistant depression and MDD with suicidal ideation [66]. However, it lacks
formal regulatory approval for use in cancer populations and is increasingly being applied
more broadly across clinical contexts [12,67]. Its accessibility, relatively low cost, and rapid
onset make it appealing in crisis contexts; yet, its use may be outpacing the evidence,
raising concerns about safety, efficacy, and equity [68–71].

This pattern is echoed globally. In high-income countries such as Australia, Canada
and the United States, ketamine is permitted off-label. Meanwhile, psilocybin, while
demonstrating durable psychosocial and existential benefits, remains restricted to clinical

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

21 of 31

trials or special access programs, limiting its scalability and integration into mainstream
oncology care [19].

Canada exemplifies these tensions. While public healthcare provides universal cov-
erage, private “psychedelic” clinics charge out-of-pocket fees (~$750 to $1400 CAD per
ketamine session), creating disparities in access [72–74]. The absence of national oncology-
specific guidelines for psychedelic use places clinicians in ethically ambiguous territory,
particularly when obtaining informed consent from vulnerable patients. This underscores
the need for pragmatic, equity-focused research to inform safe, scalable models of care [75].

4.5. Comparison with Existing Reviews

This review provides a focused and methodologically rigorous synthesis of PAT for
psychosocial symptoms in adults with cancer, a population that has often been subsumed
within broader reviews of LTI. Unlike previous syntheses that pooled heterogeneous diag-
noses, agents, and trial designs, we prioritized RCTs conducted specifically in oncology
populations and disaggregated findings by psychedelic agent to enhance clinical relevance
for psycho-oncology. However, three included RCTs [35–37] enrolled broader LTI popu-
lations and were retained based on partial cancer representation and because they were
the only controlled trials available for LSD and MDMA. While this decision introduces
some heterogeneity, it was necessary to ensure coverage of the full spectrum of psychedelic
agents under investigation for cancer-related psychosocial symptoms and reflects the early
stage of oncology-specific research in this field.

The Cochrane review by Schipper et al. [17] synthesized six RCTs (n = 149) assess-
ing psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA in individuals with LTI, including cancer. While their
analysis found low-certainty evidence for reductions in depression and anxiety, the inclu-
sion of heterogeneous populations and lack of agent-specific subgroup analysis limited
oncology-specific conclusions. Similarly, Schimmers et al. [19] reviewed 33 studies of
PAT in terminally ill patients and reported generally positive outcomes with few adverse
events; however, the review included mixed agents (e.g., psilocybin, ketamine, MDMA)
and diagnoses, without a specific cancer focus.

Maia et al. [18] also reported psychological and spiritual benefits in LTI, but their in-
clusion of primarily non-randomized studies constrained the overall certainty of evidence.
Ross et al. [76] reviewed classic psychedelics in cancer-related psychiatric distress and high-
lighted rapid and robust improvements, yet the absence of formal meta-analytic techniques
and the combination of various study designs reduced comparability across trials.

Our review builds on these foundations by applying standardized meta-analytic meth-
ods (e.g., Hedges’ g), GRADE certainty assessments, and rigorous risk of bias evaluations
using ROB 2.0 and NIH tools. We identified large effect sizes for both psilocybin and
ketamine in reducing depression, anxiety, and existential distress among PLWC, but also
emphasized the moderating influence of therapeutic context, particularly the presence of
structured psychotherapy in psilocybin trials. Furthermore, our narrative synthesis extends
these findings by integrating open-label studies [12,23–25] and exploratory trials involving
MDMA and LSD. These studies support the feasibility and clinical promise of psychedelic
interventions in cancer care, especially within group-based or psychospiritual delivery
models, but highlight the need for larger RCTs and oncology-specific implementation re-
search. In sum, this review contributes uniquely to the literature by isolating cancer-specific
data, distinguishing between psychedelic agents, and contextualizing efficacy within deliv-
ery frameworks, advancing the field toward more tailored, scalable, and evidence-informed
models of PAT in oncology.

4.6. Limitations

This review has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the
findings. First, substantial heterogeneity was observed across included studies, particularly
in the psilocybin meta-analysis. While all trials assessed changes in psychosocial symptoms
using validated instruments, the selected outcomes (e.g., GRID-HAMD-17, BDI, HADS-T
for psilocybin; MADRS, HAMD-17, PHQ-9, HAD-D for ketamine) varied in focus and
scoring range. Timepoints for outcome collection also ranged from 24 h to several days post-
treatment for ketamine, and from 2 to 7 weeks post-dose for psilocybin. These variations in
outcome type and timing likely contributed to statistical heterogeneity, particularly in the
psilocybin analyses, where a single study [8] had a disproportionately large effect size.

Second, the number of RCTs eligible for meta-analysis was small, especially for psilo-
cybin, which was represented by only three RCTs totaling 101 participants. Although
Griffiths et al. [8] was initially considered for exclusion due to its crossover design and
extreme effect size, it was retained in the final analysis due to its methodological rigor, use
of pre-crossover data, and alignment with recent Cochrane review practices. However, its
inclusion substantially increased between-study heterogeneity, underscoring the need for
more consistent outcome reporting and standardized trial design.

Third, non-randomized and open-label studies were excluded from the quantitative
synthesis to preserve methodological rigor. These studies, while informative, particularly
in exploring long-term outcomes, therapeutic frameworks, and implementation models,
were synthesized narratively due to their lack of comparator groups and risk of selection
and performance bias. Their exclusion from the meta-analysis limits our ability to estimate
real-world effectiveness or assess the role of setting and therapy format in modulating
treatment outcomes.

Fourth, only studies published in English were included, which may introduce lan-
guage bias and limit the comprehensiveness of the review. Additionally, the small number
of trials prevented formal tests of publication bias such as funnel plots or Egger’s test,
though the risk remains a concern in emerging fields where positive findings may be more
likely to be reported.

Finally, most trials evaluated short-term effects, with outcome assessments occurring
within days to weeks post-treatment. While some studies included long-term follow-
up [39], these were limited to small sample sizes and lacked comparator groups. As such,
the durability and functional impact of PAT in oncology populations remain areas requiring
further longitudinal research.

4.7. Future Research Directions

To responsibly advance the field of PAT in oncology, future research should prioritize
several key directions. First, comparative effectiveness trials are needed to directly evaluate
agents such as psilocybin and ketamine within cancer populations. These head-to-head
studies will help clarify their respective therapeutic niches, whether for acute symptom
relief, existential distress, or long-term psychosocial support. Second, the development
of oncology-specific protocols is essential. This includes standardizing psychotherapy
integration, optimizing dosing schedules, and harmonizing outcome measurement tools
that reflect the unique psychosocial challenges of cancer care.

Third, future trials should incorporate mechanistic and biomarker endpoints, such as
inflammatory markers, neuroendocrine parameters, gut microbiome, and neuroimaging
correlates, to bridge subjective experiences with underlying biological processes. Fourth,
equity-centered implementation research is urgently needed to ensure access and inclusion.
This may include evaluating telehealth modalities, group-based formats, and culturally
responsive delivery models, particularly for underserved or marginalized populations.

Curr. Oncol. 2025, 32, 380

23 of 31

Finally, future research should allow for greater methodological flexibility that honors
the complexity of psychedelic-assisted experiences. This may involve exploring alternative
trial designs (e.g., pragmatic, hybrid, or culturally embedded models) that capture both
pharmacological effects and contextual influences, especially in settings where meaning-
making, ritual, and therapeutic alliance are integral to outcomes. Longitudinal studies
are also critical to assess durability of effects, monitor adverse outcomes, and determine
long-term impact on quality of life. Together, these priorities will support the safe, effective,
and culturally attuned integration of PAT into oncology care.

5. Conclusions

PAT shows considerable promise for alleviating psychological and existential suffering
in PLWC. Our synthesis highlights both the efficacy and complexity of these interventions,
underscoring the influence of therapeutic setting, mechanistic pathways, and clinical
delivery models. Across these trials, it becomes clear that the experience of suffering
is not merely a symptom to be eliminated, but often an opportunity for deeper insight,
transformation, and renewal. As this field matures, oncology researchers and practitioners
must lead the way in shaping evidence-based, patient-centered applications that bridge
biological, psychological, and spiritual domains of healing.
