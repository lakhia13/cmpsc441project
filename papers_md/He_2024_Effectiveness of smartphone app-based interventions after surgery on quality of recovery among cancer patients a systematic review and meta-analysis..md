ABSTRACT
Background:  Postoperative  recovery  in  patients  with  cancer  is  a  complex  process  that  influences 
quality  of  life,  functional  recovery,  and  mental  well-being.  Smartphone  app-based  interventions 
have  emerged  as  potential  tools  for  improving  various  aspects  of  health  and  well-being  in  cancer 
patients.  However,  the  existing  literature  lacks  a  consensus  on  the  efficacy  of  these  interventions, 
leading  to  conflicting  outcomes.
Methods:  We  searched  multiple  databases,  including  PubMed,  Web  of  Science,  Cochrane  Library, 
Scopus,  EMBASE,  and  MEDLINE  Complete  (EBSCO). We  exclusively  selected  randomized  controlled 
trials  meeting  the  inclusion  criteria  for  our  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis.  Utilizing  a 
random-effects  model,  we  derived  the  pooled  effect  size  estimates  for  the  meta-analysis.  Where 
applicable,  we  calculated  the  pooled  standardized  mean  difference  (SMD)  with  95%  confidence 
interval  (CI).  The  Cochrane  Collaboration  tool  (Cochrane  ROB)  was  used  to  evaluate  bias  in 
randomized  trials.  The  primary  outcome  was  the  quality  of  life.  The  secondary  outcomes  were 
psychological  symptoms,  health  conditions,  satisfaction,  and  self-efficacy.

−0.72,−0.15;  p  =  .003),  and  enhanced  self-efficacy  (SMD  =  0.90,  95%  CI  0.26  to  1.53;  p   =   0.001). 
However,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  satisfaction  (SMD  =  1.25,  95%  CI-1.06  to

Conclusions:  Our  findings  suggest  that  mobile  health  apps  hold  promise  in  improving  the 
well-being  of  cancer  patients  after  surgery  by  enhancing  their  quality  of  life,  health  status,  and 
self-efficacy,  while  also  reducing  anxiety  and  depression.

PRÉCIS  (CONDENSED  ABSTRACT)
Many  smartphone  apps  focus  on  managing  health,  particularly  for  activities  such  as  exercise  and 
preventing  diseases  such  as  obesity,  diabetes,  and  mental  health;  however,  there  is  a  noticeable 
absence  of  specialized  health  management  apps  tailored  for  cancer  patients  after  surgery. 
Smartphone  app-based  interventions  have  the  potential  to  enhance  quality  of  life,  health  status, 
self-efficacy, and decrease feelings of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients after surgery.

Introduction

Cancer  is  a  significant  public  health  concern  worldwide, 
affecting  both  developed  and  developing  nations.  The 
number  of  new  cases  is  projected  to  increase  to  21.6 
million  annually  by  2030  [1].  Nowadays,  the  number  of 

cancer  patients  is  increasing,  and  the  significance  of 
survival  rate  and  quality  of  life  after  cancer  therapy  
is  progressively  growing  [2].  Postoperative  cancer 
patients  worry  about  disease  recurrence,  and  the  fear 
of  recurrence  increases  anxiety  and  depression,  while 
reducing  their  quality  of  life  [3].  The  quality  of  life  for

postoperative  cancer  patients  encompasses  several 
characteristics,  such  as  physical  health,  psychological 
conditions,  social  and  spiritual  well-being.  Modifications 
in  one  dimension  have  an  impact  on  the  other  dimen-
sions  [4].

With  the  development  of  the  information  age,  an 
increasing  number  of  people  have  smartphones.  As  of 
2022,  the  United  States  has  one  of  the  highest  smart-
phone  penetration  rates  in  the  world,  with  81.6%  of  its 
population  using  smartphones.  In  2023,  the  number  of 
global  smartphone  users  is  expected  to  reach  approx-
imately  6.8  billion,  representing  an  annual  growth  of 
4.2%  [5].  More  and  more  mobile  applications  are 
increasingly  altering  behaviours  to  enhance  wellness 
and  manage  illness.  An  increasing  number  of  mobile 
apps  are  designed  to  alter  behaviour 
in  order  to 
enhance  health  and  control  illness.  Presently,  there  are 
approximately  325,000  mobile  health  (mHealth)  appli-
cations  in  existence  [6].  It  is  projected  that  the  world-
wide  health  application  industry  will  reach  a  value  of 
US  $236  billion  by  2026.  More  and  more  fitness  and 
medical  applications  are  being  used  to  collect  and 
track  personal  health-related  data,  and  to  improve  the 
overall  health  status  of  patients  through  the  use  of 
smartphones  [7].  Furthermore,  previous  studies  have 
demonstrated  the  potential  benefits  and  effects  of 
using  the  smartphone  apps  as  the  major  intervention 
for  disease  prevention  or  self-care  conducted  in  diabe-
tes,  obesity  and  cancer  patients  [8].  Mobile  health 
applications  are  utilized  for  these  objectives;  nonethe-
less,  their  influence  on  health  results  has  shown  diver-
sity.  Information  on  the  feasibility  and  effectiveness  of 
mobile apps for cancer patients after surgery is limited.
When  it  comes  to  cancer  treatment,  post-surgery  and 
post-chemotherapy  or  post-RT  each  pose  unique  chal-
lenges  and 
lives.  Psychological 
effects  like  anxiety  and  fear  of  recurrence  are  common 
[9],  though  there  may  be  a  sense  of  relief  from  tumour 
removal  and  the  possibility  of  cure.  Our  study  focuses 
only  on  postoperative  patients  with  cancer  because  they 
have  more  complications,  including  physical  discomfort, 
changes  in  body  image,  infections,  ostomy-related  com-
plications  and  functional  impairments.

impacts  on  patients’ 

Most  postoperative  cancer  patients  receive  follow-up 
care  after  treatment,  primarily  to  detect  recurrences. 
Traditional  follow-up  includes  regular  visits  to  cancer 
experts  for  examination  and  testing,  which  is  expensive 
and  may  impose  a  burden  on  patients  [10].  Subsequent 
strategies  involving  non-professional  nursing  providers, 
surgeries  of  varying  intensities,  or  the  addition  of  sur-
vival  care  packages  have  been  developed  and  tested, 
but their effectiveness is still unclear [11]. The traditional 
strategy  of  meeting  postoperative  needs  of  cancer 

patients  is  not  practical,  and  there  is  still  an  urgent 
need  for  new  technologies  that  can  improve  health  out-
comes.  Health  education  and  compliance  of  postopera-
tive  patients  are  difficult  to  maintain  in  the  long  term.

Patients with cancer need convenient and cost-effective 
channels  for  postoperative  follow-up  and  doctor-patient 
communication. The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  integrate 
postoperative  smartphone  application  intervention  for 
cancer  patients  on  quality  of  recovery  and  tailor  support 
services  to  promote  physical  and  psychosocial  well-being 
across  the  cancer  continuum.

Materials  and  methods

The  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  adhered  to  the 
PRISMA  2020  guidelines  [12].  The  review  protocol  was 
registered  with  PROSPERO  (CRD42024516470),  with  its 
peer-reviewed  protocol  published  online,  focused  on 
randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  involving  in  1846 
patients with cancer after surgery. Quality assessment of 
the  RCTs  was 
the  Cochrane 
conducted  using 
Collaboration  risk  of  bias  tool  [13].  Ethical  approval  was 
obtained  for  all  included  studies,  and  participants  pro-
vided  informed  consent,  either  verbally  or  in  writing.

Study  selection

One  of  the  authors  (L.G.Z)  performed  a  comprehensive 
search  across  multiple  databases,  including  PubMed, 
Web  of  Science,  Cochrane  Library,  Scopus,  EMBASE, 
and  MEDLINE  Complete  (EBSCO),  covering  the  period 
from 
inception  to  March  3,  2024.  Search  strategy 
according  to  the  requirements  of  each  database 
(Attachment  1).  The  English  literature  will  be  included. 
According  to  the  Population  Intervention  Comparison 
Results  (PICO)  framework  [14]  and  the  eligibility  crite-
ria  for  the  study  were  as  follows  (Table  1).

Based  on  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  three 
rounds  of  screening  were  carried  out  by  trained 
researchers  (H.M.Q  and  C.M.Q),  starting  with  the  title, 
moving  on  to  the  abstract,  and  ending  with  the  com-
plete  text.  The  justifications  for  eliminating  papers  in 
the  full-text  screening  phase  are  presented.  Each  paper 
underwent  a  thorough  evaluation  by  a  minimum  of 
two  reviewers,  each  working  independently. The  group 
meetings  deliberated  on  the  disparities  among  the 
reviewers  until  a  unanimous  agreement  was  achieved. 
We  used  EndNote  21  was  used  to  organize  the  litera-
ture  database.  Following  the  elimination  of  duplicate 
entries,

research  was  determined  to  satisfy  the  requirements,

Data  extraction

Data  synthesis

Data  extracting  was  carried  out  by  two  individuals 
(H.M.Q  and  C.M.Q)  using  pre-designed  forms.  For  each 
trial,  we  gathered  information  on  the  clinical  aspects 
(participants,  interventions,  and  outcome  assessments) 
as  well  as  the  specific  specifics  of  the  treatments  and 
the  findings  of  each  outcome.  The  quality  of  the 
included  studies  was  assessed  separately  by  two 
reviewers,  H.M.Q  and  C.M.Q.  Any  discrepancies  were 
addressed  by  discussion  and  consensus  with  a  third 
reviewer,  L.G.Z.  Each  RCT  was  classified  according  to 
its  risk  of  bias  in  six  specific  areas:  sequence  genera-
tion,  allocation  concealment,  blinding  of  participants 
and  outcome  assessment,  incomplete  outcome  data, 
selective  outcome  reporting,  and  other  conceivable 
risks.  Risk  of  bias  was  categorized  as  low,  high,  or 
uncertain.  This  categorization  was  based  on  informa-
tion  obtained  from  published  articles  and  supplemen-
tary  materials  as  well  as  direct  communication  with 
the  study  authors  when  necessary.

We  extracted  the  mean  (Standard  Deviation,  SD) 
and  CI  (confidence  interval),  length  of  follow-up,  and 
characteristics  of  the  interventions.  We  collected  data 
on  the  impact  of  app-based  treatments  across  all  the 
age  groups.  Two  reviewers  (H.M.Q  and  C.M.Q)  inde-
pendently  conducted  data  extraction  and  risk  of  bias 
assessment  using  a  structured  Excel  spreadsheet. 
Discrepancies  among  reviewers  were  resolved  by  con-
versation,  and  if  needed,  a  third  reviewer  (L.G.Z)  was

Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  RevMan  (ver-
sion  5.4;  The  Cochrane  Collaboration)  and  the  R  meta 
package 
for  Statistical 
Computing).  Our  assessment  of  outcomes  employed 
standardized  mean  difference  (SMD)  along  with  a  95% 
confidence  interval  (CI),  considering  a  P  value  less  than 
0.05  as  statistically  significant.  Heterogeneity  was 
assessed  using  the  I2  test.

Risk-of-bias  assessment

Assessing  the  potential  for  prejudice  and  the  level  of 
research  excellence:  Two  unbiased  evaluators  used  the 
Cochrane  Collaboration  tools  [15]  to  evaluate  the  like-
lihood  of  prejudice  in  the  following  domains:  genera-
tion  of  randomization  sequences,  concealment  of 
allocations,  participants  and  investigators,  assessors  of 
outcomes,  blinding  of  data  assessors,  integrity  of  out-
come  data,  and  selective  reporting  of  outcomes.  The 
assessment  of  bias  was  conducted  using  RevMan  v5.4. 
If  any  differences  arose,  they  were  resolved  via  a  group 
discussion  or  by  seeking  the  input  of  a  third  party 
who  is  well-informed  and  impartial.

Bias  in  the  results  report  is  an  unrecognized  issue 
that  affects  a  significant  portion  of  the  conclusions  of 
the  Cochrane  review.  Individuals  conducting  system 
reviews  need  to  clearly  address  the  issue  of  missing 
result  data  to  consider  their  review  as  a  reliable  source

of  evidence.  Extra  caution 
is  required  during  data 
extraction.  Reviewers  should  determine  when  the  test 
reports  measured  results,  but  do  not  report  results  or 
observe  events  and  encourage  contact  with  the  test 
personnel  [16].

Assessment  of  reporting  biases:  If  more  than  ten 
for  a  quantitative  analysis 
studies  were  qualified 
(meta-analysis),  a  funnel  plot  [17]  was  utilized  with 
RevMan  v5.4  to  examine  reporting  biases.

Patients  did  not  participate 

in  formulating  the 
research  question  or  determining  outcome  measures, 
nor  were  they  involved  in  designing  or  executing  the 
study.  Their  input  did  not  seek  to  interpret  or  phrase 
the  findings.  The  results  will  be  disseminated  widely 
through  social  media  and  professional  networks, 
reaching  a  diverse  audience  including  the  general 
public,  patients,  healthcare  providers,  and  experts  in 
the  field.

Statistical  analyses

Meta-analysis
Heterogeneity  was  examined  using  the  χ2  test  (α = 0.1) 
and  the  I2  test.  If  the  p-value  of  the  χ2  test  was  less  than 
0.1  and  the  I2  was  more  than  50%,  the  randomized 
effect  model  was  employed.  If  the  p-value  of  the  χ2  test 
was  more  than  0.1  or  I2  was  less  than  50%,  the  fixed 
effect  model  was  applied. When  faced  with  heterogene-
ity,  we  conducted  a  subgroup  analysis  to  investigate 
clinical  heterogeneity,  especially 
time 
(Intervention  time  <  6 months  or  Intervention  time  ≥ 
6 months). The  random-effects  approach  produces  more 
uniform  study  weights  than  the  fixed-effects  model 
does.  In  comparison  to  the  fixed-effects  model,  large 
studies  are  awarded  less  relative  weight,  whereas  small 
studies  are  assigned  a  greater  relative  weight  [18].

We  used  a  random-effects  model  to  obtain  pooled 
effect  size  estimates,  and  study  heterogeneity  was 
examined  using  I2.  Due  to  the  inconsistent  evaluation 
scales 
the 
EORTC-QLQ-C30,  QLQ-CR29,  EORTC-QLQ-PAN26,  and 
EORTC-QLQ-BR23  scales  used  for  QOL  outcome  indica-
tors.  Standardized  mean  differences  (SMDs)  were  also 
computed.  If  standard  deviations  (SDs)  were  missing 
from  the  retrieved  data  but  other  statistical  informa-
tion  such  as  t  values,  P  values,  and  confidence  inter-
vals  (CIs)  were  available,  we  utilized  these  parameters 
to  compute  effect  sizes  following  the  guidelines  out-
lined  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  [19].

Sensitivity  analyses
We  conducted  sensitivity  analyses  by  excluding  trials 
with  a  high  or  unknown  risk  of  bias  and  those  with 
similar  risks  in  other  aspects.  We  also  excluded  RCTs 
with  follow-up  durations  of  <  4 weeks.  Additionally,  to 
evaluate  the 
individual  studies  on  our 
pooled  outcomes,  we  performed  a  sensitivity  analysis, 
systematically  omitting  one  study  at  a  time  and  con-
firming  the  robustness  of  our  findings.  Publication  bias 
was  assessed  using  funnel  plots  for  asymmetry  when 
at  least  ten  trials  were  available.

App  feature  analysis
We  selected  a  minimum  effect  size  of  0.2  or  higher  as 
the criterion for a successful app. This value was used as 
the  dependent  variable  in  a  logistic  regression  model. 
Statistical  analyses  were  conducted  using  R  4.3.1  [20,21] 
(R  Core  Team  2019)  and  Review  Manager5.4.

Results

Through  the  process  of  conducting  database  searches, 
731  records  were  discovered.  Of  these,  15  satisfied  the 
inclusion  criteria  and  were  included  in  the  present 
review.  Refer  to  Figure  1  for  the  PRISMA  flowchart  [12] 
illustrating  the  process  of  research  selection,  which 
also  provides  reasons  for  excluding  full-text  publica-
tions.  The  rationale  for  excluding  literature  after  com-
pleting  the  book  is  shown  in  Attachment  2.

Attachment  3  summarizes  the  characteristics  of 

these  studies.

Study  characteristics

Participants
The  sample  sizes  ranged  from  24  to  339,  with  a  total 
of  1  831  participants  across  15  studies.  On  average, 
the  age  of  the  participants  varied  from  45.75  (SD 
12.63)  to  69  (SD  3)  years. The  most  common  condition 
was  breast  cancer  [22–25]  (4/15,  26.7%).  Other  types  of 
cancer  include:  pancreatic  cancer  [26],  colon  cancer 
[27],  oesophageal  cancer  [28],  colorectal  cancer  [29], 
oral  cancer  [30],  gastric  cancer  [31],  thyroid  cancer 
[32],  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  [33]  and  bladder  can-
cer  [34].  Only  three  articles  [24,25,35]  (3/15,  20%)  lim-
ited  the  maximum  age  of  the  included  patients.  Two 
[35,36]  (2/15,13.3%)  of  the  articles  did  not  impose 
restrictions  on  tumour  types.

Interventions
The  intervention  duration  ranged  from  four  weeks  to 
two years. The citation applications’ functions (Figure 2) 
can  be  categorized  as  follows:  delivering  health  educa-
tion and guidance(12/15,80%); facilitating physician-patient

communication(11/15,73.3%); data management  pertain-
ing to self-management habits of cancer patients(6/15,40%)
(including  data  upload,  visualization,  and  reminders); 
pain  management(1/15,6.7%);  side-effect  management 
and  drug  complications(4/15,26.7%);  nutritional  educa-
tion(3/15,20%);  psychological  education  and  sup-
port(5/15,33.3%);  physical  activity  tracking(6/15,40%); 
and  medication  adherence(4/15,26.7%).  The  numbers 
of  these  nine  functions  in  each  article  are  shown  in 
the  following  figure.  The  interaction  between  physi-
cians  and  patients  occurs  via  two  methods:  the  appli-
cation  creates  automatic  feedback  using  predesigned 
individualized  input,  and  medical  professionals  provide 
interactive  assistance  based  on  personalized  data  sup-
plied  by  the  patient.  The  majority  (12/15,  80%)  of 

these  trials  included  tailored  advisory  services  offered 
by  healthcare  experts  that  assessed  patient  data  and 
talked  with  patients  via  SMS  text  messages,  phones,  or 
videos.  Most  of  the  mHealth  apps  (11/15,  73%)  can 
provide  patients  with  an  online  channel  for  direct 
communication  with  healthcare  professionals.

Risk  of  bias

The  Cochrane  Risk  of  Bias  tool  for  RCTs  (Figure  3)  was 
used  to  assess  the  risk  of  bias  in  all  studies.  The  ran-
domization  approach  (random  sequence  generation) 
for  the  majority  (12/15,  80%  low  risk  of  bias)  of  the 
experiments  was  deemed  sufficiently  explained.  More 
information  on 
than  half  of  the  studies  provided

allocation  concealment  (10/15,  66.7%  indicating  low 
risk  of  bias),  while  the  description  of  blinding  for  par-
ticipants  and  personnel  was  less  comprehensive  (5/15, 
30%  indicating  low  risk  of  bias).  All  the  included  arti-
cles  had  no  missing  values  and  have  fully  reported  the 
values  of  the  corresponding  outcome  indicators.  The 
attribution  bias  and  reporting  biases  were  low.  Other 
biases  in  most  studies  were  unclear  (14/15,93.3%). 
Only  two  [28,31]  articles  describe  how  to  evaluate  or 
control  confounding  factors.

Utilizing  the  GRADE  [37]  summary  of  evidence,  the 
evidence  quality  for  the  main  outcome  was  deemed  to 
be  high.  The  articles  included  were  RCTs  with  a  low 
risk  of  bias,  good  consistency,  and  a  large  number  of 
included  patients.  In  the  final  rating  of  quality  for  each 
outcome,  anxiety  and  depression  (four  RCT),  physical 
health  (three  RCT)  and  self-efficacy  (three  RCT)  were 
classified  as  high  quality.  Satisfaction  (three  RCT)  was 
classified  as  moderate  due  to  the  small  number  of 
studies 
interval 
included  and  the  wide  confidence 
quality.

Sensitivity  analysis

One  study  [34]  was  excluded  because  the  Chinese  ver-
sion  of  the  Stoma-QOL  Quality  of  Life  Scale  for  Stoma 

Patients  was  used  instead  of  the  global  universal  scale 
for  tumour  patients  to  explore  potential  sources  of 
heterogeneity.  After  removing  this  literature,  heteroge-
neity  was  removed  from  ‘Tau2  =  0.39;  Chi2  =  105.86, 
df = 9  (p < 0.00001);  I2  =  91%’  becomes  ‘Tau2  =  0.07; 
Chi2  =  25.55,  df  =  8  (p  =  0.001);  I2  =  69%’

Publication  bias  was  assessed  using  funnel  plots 
(Figure  4)  for  asymmetry  when  at  least  ten  trials  were 
included.

the  primary  analysis.  Each  white  dot  represents  an 
individual  study  included,  and  the  white  diamonds 
indicate  the  computed  effect  size.  The  larger  the 
sample  size,  the  more  reliable  the  result,  the  smaller 
the  variance,  the  smaller  the  standard  error,  and  the 
more  concentrated  the  small  points  are  in  the  narrow 
area  at  the  top  of  the  funnel  plot.  A  large  sample  size 
and  high  research  accuracy  were  distributed  at  the 
top  of  the  funnel  plot  and  concentrated  towards  the 
middle. Three  articles  outside  the  funnel  plot  indicate 
heterogeneity  [38].  In  addition,  the  appearance  of  the 
funnel  plot  was  asymmetric,  and  there  was  a  blank 
space  at  the  bottom  corner  of  the  graph  indicating 
publication  bias.  The  effect  calculated  by 
the 
meta-analysis  may  overestimate  the  efficacy  of  the 
intervention  measures.

Meta-analysis

Effects  on  QOL
A  total  of  67%  (10/15)  [22,24,26–28,30,31,33–35]  of  the 
studies  involving  1545  participants  utilized  different 
scales  to  report  QOL  outcomes.  Due  to  substantial 
variability  among  the  studies  (p<.001;  I2  =  91%),  the 

findings  were  aggregated  using  a  random-effects 
model.  Owing  to  slight  differences  in  the  selected 
scales,  SMD  was  chosen  for  effect  size  consolidation. 
Overall, 
interventions  through  mHealth  applications 
enhanced  scores  related  to  QOL  (SMD  =  -0.58,  95%  CI 
−1.00  to  −0.16;  p   =   0.007;  Figure  5).

Figure  5.  effect  size  for  quality  of  life.

The  subgroup  analysis  test  revealed  no  statistically 
significant subgroup effect (p  =  0.33), indicating that the 
duration  of  the  intervention  did  not  alter  the  impact  of 
intervention  outcomes. The  test  for  subgroup  differences 
I2  =  0%  showed  no  differences  between  the  subgroups. 
Since  the  results  from  all  trials  included  in  this  analysis 
were  relatively  homogenous,  it  is  unlikely  that  this  anal-
ysis  would  have  been  performed  to  investigate  the 

sources  of  heterogeneity.  The  sample  size  of  the  study 
population  between  the  two  subgroups  was  similar: 
Intervention  time  <  6 months  (662  people)  and  interven-
tion time ≥ 6 months (611 people). As no significant sub-
group  effects  were  observed,  conducting  this  subgroup 
analysis  may  not  be  important.  It  is  important  to  con-
sider  the  distribution  of  covariates  before  drawing  con-
clusions  based  on  the  results  of  subgroup  analysis  [39].

Effects  on  anxiety  and  depression
The  meta-analysis  of  anxiety  and  depression  covered 
27%  (4/15)  [22,25,32,33]  of  the  studies,  which  included 
551  patients  with  cancer.  Owing  to  the  heterogeneity 
among the studies (p = .06; I2 = 59%), a random-effects 
model  was  used  to  combine  the  data.  Overall,  the 
mHealth  app  interventions  significantly  alleviated  dis-
tress and anxiety among cancer patients (SMD =  −0.43, 
95%  CI  −0.71,  −0.15;  p  =  .03;  Figure  6).

Effects  on  Self-efficacy
A  total  of  20%  (3/15)  [25,26,29]  of  the  studies  reported 
self-efficacy  as  an  outcome. These  three  studies  showed 
that  using  the  mHealth  app  can  significantly  improve 
the  self-efficacy  of  postoperative  cancer  patients 
(SMD = 0.89,95% CI 0.21-1.58; p  =  0.01; I2 = 89; Figure 7).

Effects  on  health  conditions
A  total  of  20%  (3/15)  [23,25,36]  of  studies  reported 
health  conditions  as  an  outcome.  These  three  studies 
showed  that  using  the  mHealth  app  could  improve 

the  health  conditions  of  postoperative  cancer  patients 
(SMD = 0.27,95% CI 0.02-0.52; p  =  0.04; I2 = 0; Figure 8).

Effects  on  satisfaction
A  total  of  20%  (3/15)  [23,25,30]  of  studies  reported  sat-
isfaction as an outcome. The pooling of studies showed 
no  statistical  difference  between  the 
intervention 
group  and  control  group 
(SMD  =  1.25,  95%  CI 
 0.23;  I2  =  98%;  Figure  9).  Use  of 
−0.81,3.32;  p   =

reporting  standards. This  research  examined  the  use  of 
smartphone  applications  to  enhance  traditional  post-
operative  care  in  15  different  studies.  A  broad  range  of 
patient  populations,  interventions,  and  outcome  mea-
sures  had  been  documented,  showing  significant  vari-
ability.  We  adhered  to  the  guidelines  provided  by  the 
Cochrane  Collaboration  and  PRISMA  Declaration.  This 
study  also  conducted  a  thorough  evaluation  of  the 
credibility  of  the  evidence  using  the  GRADE  methodol-
ogy.  Accurate  data,  particularly  trustworthy  cancer  reg-
istries and quality assurance monitoring and assessment 
systems,  are  essential  for  effective  cancer  control  plan-
ning  [1]  The  use  of  mobile  data  software  may  provide 
the  possibility  for  a  global  cancer  patient  data  sharing 
platform  to  be  entered  in  the  future.  Our  study  also 
subdivided  and  categorized  the  mobile  apps  functions 
used  in  each  included  article.  Most  software  covered 
the  two  main  functions  of  health  education  consulta-
tion  and  communication.  For  cancer  patients,  pain 
management  is  the  most  lacking  module,  with  only 
one  article  [35]  involved.  In  the  future,  more  attention 
needs  to  be  paid  to  postoperative  cancer  pain  man-
agement  for  cancer  patients.  Despite  the  variety  of 
tumour  types  included  in  the  studies,  common  psy-
chological  symptoms  such  as  anxiety,  depression  [40], 
psychological  distress,  and  fear  of  cancer  recurrence 
[41]  are  prevalent  among  all  cancer  patients.

However,  this  study  had  some 

limitations.  First, 
masking  participants  using  smartphone  app-based 
interventions  is  impossible.  Although  all  studies  were 
RCTs,  their  quality  exhibited  variance.  While  some 
studies  explicated  specific  blinding  and  random  alloca-
tion  methodologies,  others  failed  to  do  so.  Second,  the 
included  studies  had  qualitative  and  methodological 
deficiencies.  Several  studies  did  not  clarify  the  meth-
ods  used 
for  allocation  concealment,  blinding  of 
researchers or participants, blinding of outcome assess-
ment,  or  techniques  for  dealing  with  inadequate  out-
come  data.  Only  two  [28,31]  articles  describe  how  to 
evaluate  or  control  confounding  factors. The  data  eval-
uated  had  limitations,  including  inherent  risks  of  bias 
in  the  original  research  designs.  Hence,  future  research 
implementation  of 
should  prioritize  meticulous 

allocation  concealment,  participant  blinding,  and  out-
come  evaluation  to  ensure  the  generation  of  more  reli-
able  and  valid  results.  The  third  issue  pertains  to 
clinical  heterogeneity:  patients  with  different  types 
(breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, oesoph-
ageal  cancer,  colorectal  cancer,  oral  cancer,  gastric  can-
cer,  thyroid  cancer,  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and 
bladder  cancer)  and  staging  of  cancer,  inconsistent 
versions  of  outcome  evaluation  scales,  or  the  use  of 
specific  and  targeted  evaluation  scales  for  cancer 
patients  rather  than  universally  applicable  scales. 
Additionally,  different  groups  of  people  exhibit  varying 
degrees  of  mobile  phone  usage.  Moreover,  disparities 
in  tumour  knowledge  and  comprehensiveness  of 
follow-up  content  (from  4 weeks  to  2 years)  across  dif-
ferent  apps  collectively  influence  variations  in  efficacy. 
The  sample  size  and  the  duration  of  intervention  var-
ied.  Each  application  has  subtle  differences  in  interven-
tion  measures  and  functional  focus  (Figure  2  Number 
is 
of  studies  with  app  features).  The  fourth  point 
reflected  in  the  limitations  of  the  research  population: 
the 
in  the 
middle-aged  and  elderly  populations,  who  have  a  rel-
atively  low  frequency  of  smartphone  usage.  At  the 
same  time,  the  coverage  of  smartphones  in  this  popu-
lation  shows  the  use  of  apps,  and  they  are  not  familiar 
with  the  use  of  smart  devices,  which  affects  the  effec-
tiveness  of  the  intervention.  The  population  is  rela-
tively  concentrated  and  there  is  a  lack  of  research  on 
the  young  and  middle-aged  populations.  The  young 
and  middle-aged  population  is  proficient  in  and  highly 
compliant  with  the  use  of  mobile  smart  devices,  with 
strong  learning  abilities,  easier  acceptance,  and  better 
results.  In  addition,  there  is  a  danger  of  bias  if  the  per-
sonnel  responsible  for  measuring  the  outcomes  are 
not  blinded  to  the  allocation,  which  is  the  case  in 
almost  all  trials.  The  reporting  bias  may  have  exagger-
ated  the  results.  However,  any  potential  overestimation 
might  be  balanced  by  variables,  such  as  incomplete 
involvement  in  treatments  by  the  target  group  or 
inadequate  compliance.  Finally,  during  the  literature 
search  process,  many  registered  and  ongoing  articles 
that  met  the  inclusion  criteria  were  found,  but  they

and  gray  literature  were  excluded  from  the  analysis, 
which  may  have  introduced  publication  bias.

optimize 

Mobile  phone  technology  may  be  a  part  of  transi-
tional  care  to  deliver  mental  and  physical  interven-
tions  to  cancer  patients,  compensating 
for  the 
shortcomings  of  comprehensive  post-tumour  educa-
tion  among  nurses  and  sharing  nurses’  work  pressure 
in  clinical  practice.  Utilizing  smartphone  applications 
and  information  technology  may  enhance  medical 
services  to  a  limited  degree,  allowing  for  the  specific 
remote  treatment  of  frequent  dangers  among  post-
operative  cancer  patients  with  unique  needs.

resource 
Nevertheless,  the  absence  of  any  improvement  in 
patient  satisfaction  might  be  attributed  to  variables 
such  as  the  asynchronous  nature  of  medical  data 
and  inadvertent  disclosure  of  electronic  prescription 
information.  In  the  future,  advanced  software  must 
adhere  to  applicable  rules  such  as  the  Health 
Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA) 
[42] 
in  the  United  States  and  the  General  Data 
Protection  Regulation  (GDPR)  [43]  in  the  European 
Union.  Utilizing  patient  management  software  with 
integrated  compliance  capabilities  enables  firms  to 
uphold  data  privacy,  fulfill  regulatory  obligations, 
and  prevent  substantial  penalties  or  legal  complica-
tions.  The  wide  range  of  perspectives  and  varying 
levels  of  success  in  implementing  patient  engage-
ment  make  it  challenging  to  combine  and  analyse 
data.  One  should  be  cautious  when  interpreting  the 
benefits  of  app  treatments  because  of  the  significant 
variation  in  the  definition  and  scoring  of  the  assess-
instruments  are  defined  and  scored.  This

sary  to  determine  the  optimal  intervention  duration 
and  to  address  the  methodological  shortcomings 
observed  in  prior  studies.

Conclusion

warranted. Further trials with a randomized, double-blind, 
and  multicentre  study  design  are  needed  to  confirm 
this  effect,  considering  the  small  number  of  clinical  tri-
als  included.
