The prevalence of chronic pain is increasing, and conventional pain therapies 
often  have  limited  efficacy  in  individuals  with  high  levels  of  psychological 
distress  and  a  history  of  trauma.  In  this  context,  the  use  of  Eye  Movement 
Desensitization  and  Reprocessing  (EMDR),  an  evidence-based  psychotherapy 
approach  for  the  treatment  of  posttraumatic  stress  disorder,  is  becoming 
increasingly important. EMDR shows promising results, particularly for patients 
with  pain  and  high  levels  of  emotional  distress.  Although  group  therapy  is 
becoming  increasingly  popular  in  pain  management,  EMDR  has  mainly  been 
studied as an individual treatment. However, a systematic review suggests that 
group therapy can be an effective tool for improving mental health outcomes, 
especially  when  trauma  is  addressed  together.  Based  on  these  findings,  an 
outpatient EMDR group program was developed for patients with chronic pain. 
The  program  consists  of  a  total  of  four  treatment  days  with  5–5.5  h  therapy 
sessions each day and provides patients with a supportive environment in which 
they  can  learn  effective  pain  management  strategies  and  interact  with  other 
patients with similar experiences. Initial pilot evaluations indicate high efficacy 
and adequate safety for patients with chronic pain.

1 Introduction

Millions of people around the world suffer from pain, which has emerged as a major health 
problem. As populations age and chronic diseases become more prevalent, the incidence of 
pain is increasing, contributing to a growing societal burden (Wettstein and Tesarz, 2023). The 
impact of pain is not limited to physical discomfort, but also has significant social, economic 
and  psychological  consequences  (GBD  Disease  and  Injury  Incidence  and  Prevalence 
Collaborators, 2017; Tesarz et al., 2019a).

Consequently, the treatment and management of pain is becoming an important part of 
public health. It is important to distinguish between acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is 
often self-limited and typically resolves as the body heals. In contrast, chronic pain, defined as 
pain that lasts longer than 3 months or recurs frequently, is associated with severe emotional 
distress and functional impairment (Treede et al., 2019). This longer duration and recurrence

pattern of chronic pain underscores the complexity and severity of its 
impact on individuals.

Addressing chronic pain effectively remains a major challenge, as 
it  often  persists  despite  appropriate  treatment  of  the  underlying 
conditions  (Buchbinder  et  al.,  2018).  Drug  and  invasive  therapies 
often have little effect (Williams et al., 2020). These therapies also 
carry the risk of severe side effects. Opioids in particular have been 
shown to be harmful (Harper et al., 2021). Non-drug treatments, such 
as intensified psychotherapeutic treatments, are therefore becoming 
increasingly important, especially in the comorbid presence of mental 
disorders and emotional stress (Williams et al., 2020).

Psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, the lack of self-
efficacy and catastrophizing, collectively referred to as negative effects, 
are  often  already  indications  that  pain  is  going  to  persist. 
Catastrophizing in particular, a pain-related construct characterized 
by negative cognitions, helplessness, pessimism, rumination and the 
fact that patients significantly overestimate pain-related symptoms, is 
a  variable  that  appears  to  have  a  decisive  influence  on  pain 
chronification.  At  the  same  time,  these  negative  affects  are  also 
consequences of the constant confrontation and the experience of 
permanent  and  recurring  pain  (Edwards  et  al.,  2016).  Other 
consequences of chronic pain are fear of illness and somatization, 
lower self-esteem and lower self-efficacy. Furthermore, chronic pain 
patients report a stronger impairment of their emotional functionality, 
often  also  referred  to  as  distress  (Burke  et  al.,  2015).  Since 
psychological factors play a decisive role in chronic pain, both causally 
and  supportively,  psychotherapeutic  methods  have  proven  to 
be helpful.

However, the range of pain psychology therapies is limited and 
therapists  often  lack  pain-specific  training  (Darnall  et  al.,  2016). 
Group therapy can be a promising approach as it allows more patients 
to be seen, while creating a supportive environment where patients 
can learn effective pain management strategies and share experiences 
with others who have had similar experiences.

Although psychological therapies can improve the quality of life 
and functioning of people with pain, their impact on the alleviation of 
pain is often limited (Williams et al., 2020). In particular, patients with 
severe  comorbid  mental  illness  and  a  history  of  trauma  pose  a 
significant  challenge  to  clinicians,  as  many  psychological  pain 
therapies do not adequately address trauma and posttraumatic stress 
symptoms  (Lumley  et  al.,  2022).  Unfortunately,  these  patients  are 
often excluded from group opportunities because of the fear that they 
will overwhelm the group or be re-traumatized. This exclusionary 
approach is inadequate, given that psychological distress is frequently 
observed in patients experiencing pain (Afari et al., 2014; Fishbain 
et al., 2017; Kind and Otis, 2019). This results in a significant number 
of  patients  missing  out  on  potentially  beneficial  treatments. 
Fortunately,  there  exists  a  suite  of  successful  strategies  to  tackle 
psychological trauma that are easy to learn and apply.

Numerous studies have confirmed the link between psychological 
trauma, PTSD, and chronic pain, with reported prevalence ranging

from 24% to over 80% in various studies. In a review by Liedl and 
Knaevelsrud  (2008),  the  connection  between  chronic  pain  and 
trauma-related disorders is made clear using various models.

The “mutual maintenance model” proposed by Sharp and Harvey 
suggests  an  interdependent  relationship,  where  pain  and  PTSD 
symptoms interact and perpetuate each other. The model includes 
seven mechanisms, for example avoidance, memories of the trauma, 
but  also  fear  and  pain  perception.  An  alternative  explanatory 
framework  is  the  “shared  vulnerability  model”  proposed  by 
Asmundson et al. This model suggests a predisposition—potentially 
even genetically rooted— that contributes to the onset of both PTSD 
and chronic pain. Individuals who experience both chronic pain and 
PTSD have an increased sensitivity to anxiety. This sensitivity involves 
heightened  individual  reactivity  and  exaggerated  catastrophic 
responses  to  physical  indicators  of  heightened  anxiety.  Previous 
models have tended to focus on individual facets of the relationship 
between pain and trauma. However, Norton and Asmundson have 
extended the extensively researched “fear-avoidance model” to include 
physiological arousal. This extension reveals a positive feedback loop 
in  which  physiological  elements  intersect  with  cognitive  and 
behavioral  aspects,  hindering  the  adoption  of  effective  coping 
mechanisms. Increased overall physiological arousal increases both 
the actual experience of pain and the belief that activities will increase 
pain (Sharp and Harvey, 2001; Asmundson et al., 2002). The complex 
and multifaceted interaction between trauma, PTSD and pain has led 
to the early discussion of the use of Eye Movement Desensitization 
and  Reprocessing  (EMDR)  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pain 
and trauma.

EMDR  is  an  evidence-based  psychotherapy  approach  for  the 
treatment of psychological trauma that is easy for therapists to learn 
and apply (Laliotis et al., 2021). EMDR involves exposure, dual focus 
of attention and bilateral stimulation to process traumatic memory 
and  reduce  associated  distress  (Laliotis  et  al.,  2021).  Unlike 
conventional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approaches, which 
are usually based on classical learning theories, EMDR is based on the 
Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model. This model posits that 
the brain naturally seeks psychological balance, similar to the body’s 
physical healing processes. According to AIP, mental disorders and 
illnesses arise from memories of traumatic events that are not fully 
processed  or  integrated  into  the  brain’s  neural  memory  networks. 
These  unprocessed,  dysfunctionally 
stored  memories  can 
be  reactivated  by  certain  stimuli,  leading  to  psychopathological 
symptoms  such  as  PTSD,  negative  effects,  and  bodily  symptoms. 
Whereas classical exposure methods in CBT involve systematic and 
controlled confrontation of the patient with anxiety-provoking stimuli 
or  situations,  such  as  detailed  descriptions  of  events  or  direct 
questioning  of  beliefs,  in  order  to  reduce  anxiety  responses  and 
develop  coping  strategies,  the  exposure  principle  of  EMDR  uses 
synchronized eye movements in conjunction with a dual focus of 
attention. This approach facilitates the incorporation of maladaptively 
stored  memories  into  the  brain’s  adaptive  neural  networks.  This 
process  alleviates  psychological  distress  and  enhances  adaptive 
responses to future stimuli, thereby promoting psychological resilience 
and health (World Health Organization, 2013).

EMDR is recommended in clinical practice guidelines as a first-
line  treatment  for  PTSD  (Martin  et  al.,  2021).  Due  to  its  proven 
effectiveness in treating psychological trauma, EMDR is now also 
recommended by World Health Organization (2013). Given the high

comorbidity of chronic pain and psychological trauma, and EMDR’s 
ability to address body sensations and experiences, it is not surprising 
that EMDR is increasingly being used in the treatment of chronic pain 
(Matthijssen et al., 2020).

Several  randomized  controlled  trials  have  demonstrated  the 
efficacy of EMDR in the treatment of chronic pain conditions such as 
chronic  musculoskeletal  pain  (Gerhardt  et  al.,  2016),  back  pain 
(Gerhardt et al., 2016), headaches (Konuk et al., 2011), phantom limb 
pain (Rostaminejad et al., 2017), fibromyalgia (Friedberg, 2004), and 
rheumatoid arthritis (Tesarz et al., 2019b; Matthijssen et al., 2020). 
These  studies  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  EMDR  in 
reducing  pain  intensity,  pain-related  disability  and  associated 
psychological distress (Leisner et al., 2014). However, most of these 
studies examined EMDR as an individual treatment rather than in a 
group format, which is surprising given that group interventions are 
commonly used for both chronic pain and PTSD (Matthijssen et al., 
2020). Given the benefits of group therapy, it is important to further 
explore the potential of EMDR group therapy as an effective treatment 
approach 
for  patients  with  chronic  pain  and  comorbid 
psychological trauma.

While individual EMDR therapy has been shown to be effective 
in treating psychological trauma (National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence, 2018), interest in the effectiveness of group EMDR 
has  increased  in  recent  years  (Kaptan  et  al.,  2021).  Group  EMDR 
therapy  has  been  shown  to  be  particularly  effective  when  large 
numbers of people are affected by the same event, such as after major 
events and natural disasters (Jarero et al., 2008). A 2021 systematic 
review indicates that the group format can be an effective tool for 
improving  various  mental  health  outcomes,  including  PTSD, 
depression  and  anxiety  (Kaptan  et  al.,  2021).  The  group  EMDR 
approach is particularly appropriate when there is collective trauma, 
such as after earthquakes or tsunami disasters. In such situations, 
group therapy can create a supportive and empowering environment 
where  participants  can  share  their  experiences  and  learn  coping 
strategies from each other (Jarero et al., 2006).

This observation leads to the consideration of using group EMDR 
therapy in the treatment of chronic pain. Pain can be seen as a form 
of traumatic experience, and coping with the pain trauma together in 
a group therapy setting can be an effective therapeutic step.

The effectiveness of EMDR group therapy has been demonstrated 
in  numerous  studies  (Kaptan  et  al.,  2021).  In  addition  to  EMDR-
specific factors in the sense of the AIP model, a number of other 
non-specific factors can be considered as underlying effective factors 
in  the  group  setting.  Yalom,  for  example,  identified  seven  general 
factors  of  influence,  such  as  the  therapeutic  relationship,  group 
cohesion, interactions between members, the universality of suffering 
and the importance of the group process for individual change (Yalom, 
2005). Accordingly, the shared experience of pain can help create a 
cohesion  and  understanding  among  group  members,  and  this 
supportive  environment  can  facilitate  the  use  of  EMDR-derived 
techniques. In addition, EMDR therapy can help patients to process 
the traumatic aspects of their pain experience, which may help to 
reduce pain intensity and associated psychological distress. This could 
help promote adaptive coping and alleviate pain.

Given the high comorbidity of chronic pain and psychological 
trauma and the proven efficacy of EMDR therapy in treating both 
conditions,  an  innovative  outpatient  EMDR  therapeutic  group 
program was developed for patients with chronic pain. The program 

aimed to provide a supportive and empowering environment in which 
patients could learn and practice effective pain management strategies, 
process traumatic memory and make supportive connections with 
other  group  members  having  similar  experiences.  In  this  article, 
we would like to introduce the treatment program and report on our 
initial  experiences  with  its  use,  including  its  feasibility  and 
acceptability among patients with chronic pain. We hope to contribute 
to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of EMDR therapy 
in the treatment of chronic pain and psychological trauma through a 
comprehensive evaluation of this EMDR group program.

1.1 Current scientific evidence on EMDR 
group therapy

The effectiveness of EMDR therapy used in groups to treat mental 
disorders in adults and children was examined in a recent review 
(Kaptan et al., 2021). The review identified 22 studies with a total of 
1,739  participants  that  examined  four  different  EMDR  protocols 
specifically designed for group therapy. These protocols adapted the 
eight standard phases of EMDR therapy to group therapy. They were: 
(1) the EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol (IGTP) (Jarero 
et al., 2008), (2) the EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol for 
Ongoing Traumatic Stress (EMDR-IGTP-OTS) (Jarero et al., 2006, 
2018), (3) the Group Traumatic Episode Protocol (Lehnung et al., 
2019;  Korkmazlar  et  al.,  2020),  and  (4)  the  EMDR  Group  Child 
Protocol (Korkmazlar et al., 2020). The EMDR IGTP protocol had the 
strongest evidence base with 13 studies, followed by EMDR IGTP 
OTS with four studies and G-TEP with four studies. Only one study 
was available for the EMDR-GP/C protocol. Despite the heterogeneity 
of the studies in terms of sample, setting, outcomes and number of 
sessions,  EMDR  group  interventions  significantly  reduced  post-
traumatic stress, depression and anxiety symptoms after treatment 
compared  to  pre-treatment  or  control  groups.  However,  the 
methodology  of  the  studies  was  subject  to  a  relevant  risk  of  bias, 
suggesting  that  further  studies  with  sound  methodology,  larger 
samples  and  sufficiently  long  follow-up  periods  are  needed  to 
determine the effectiveness of EMDR group therapy. Furthermore, no 
studies of EMDR group interventions for chronic pain were identified 
in this comprehensive systematic literature review, highlighting the 
importance of our work.

2 Methods

The present study aimed to develop an intensified EMDR therapy 
group program for patients with chronic pain. To achieve this goal, a 
series  of  expert  interviews  and  workshops  were  conducted  with 
therapists experienced in running EMDR therapy groups. In addition, 
two focus groups with seasoned therapists experienced in delivering 
EMDR to patients with chronic pain were included, complemented by 
the participation of therapists and physicians experienced in pain 
management and two EMDRIA certified EMDR consultants. These 
interviews and workshops provided insights and recommendations 
relevant to the development of the enhanced EMDR group treatment 
protocol. Two pilot groups were conducted to test the feasibility and 
acceptability  of  the  protocol,  the  results  of  which  ultimately 
contributed  to  the  development  of  the  enhanced  EMDR  group

treatment protocol. Patients’ experiences and changes in symptoms 
during the intervention were recorded descriptively and exploratively 
in an open feedback session following the intervention as well as in an 
anonymous  online  survey  with  the  “Patient  Global  Impression  of 
Change”  (PGIC)  scale  (Guy,  1976;  Dworkin  et  al.,  2008)  and  on 
possible side effects 1–2 weeks after the intervention. As this was a 
development  phase  in  which  the  intervention  program  was  to 
be adapted and improved, the survey focused on participants’ open 
feedback  on  the  content,  global  impression  of  change,  safety  and 
possible side effects. The evaluation asked about personal impressions, 
the most and least helpful elements of the therapy as well as individual 
suggestions for improvement, and negative aversive events during and 
after the therapy. Based on these data, we developed the intensified 
EMDR group treatment program for the treatment of chronic pain, 
presented here.

3 Contents of the intensified EMDR 
group program

Our final intensified EMDR group program extends over four 
treatment days of 5–5.5 h each day (see Table 1). It is based on three 
pillars: (1) EMDR-based exposure and resource work, (2) education, 
and (3) physical activation. The education prepares patients for the 
actual exposure work, strengthens patients’ belief in the therapy and 
is  intended  to  help  patients  engage  in  the  EMDR  approach  and 
physical  activation  as  well  as  strengthen  accompanying  adaptive 
coping behaviors.

The combination of psychoeducation and physical activation is 
based on a study by Van Woudenberg et al. (2018), which showed that 
this is an effective and efficient approach in the context of intensified 
exposure programs. This is also supported by the work of Liedl and 
Knaevelsrud (2008), who emphasizes the positive effects of physical 
activity.  The  use  of  education  is  a  central  component  of  many 
guidelines, particularly in pain management. Recent studies also show 
that reinterpreting pain as a neurobiological correlate (rather than a 
physical defect) is therapeutically effective (Ashar et al, 2022, 2023). 
In  addition,  physical  activity  was  chosen  as  a  complementary 

component because some of the participants were very exhausted by 
the  therapy  and  physical  activity  could  have  a  positive  and 
complementary counteracting effect. In this context, we have decided 
to use guided walking as a physical activity and to give patients the 
opportunity to get to know each other better in a casual context and 
to process the EMDR sessions.

The program is run by a therapist together with a co-therapist, 
and the roles can be alternated. All participants received a telephone 
screening interview prior to participation in the group program, as 
well as a pre-interview with one of the group therapists. The therapy 
content is based on exposure through individual group EMDR work 
using adapted EMDR group protocols, complemented by resource 
and pain management-oriented group work, physical activation and 
education. This setting allows for the development of stable group 
cohesion so that both (1) the group therapy setting can be used to 
facilitate  the  change  of  unhelpful  pain-related  thoughts  and 
behaviors, and to foster social support through group interactions; 
and  (2)  individual  trauma  work  can  be  conducted  in  the 
group setting.

3.1 Therapeutic elements of the intensified 
EMDR group program

To optimize exposure and trauma processing work in our treatment 
program, we chose to integrate two different EMDR group therapy 
protocols: the EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol for Ongoing 
Traumatic Stress (EMDR-IGTP-OTS) (Jarero et al., 2018) and the Group 
Traumatic  Episode  Protocol  (GTEP)  (Lehnung  et  al.,  2019).  Both 
treatment  protocols  were  slightly  modified  for  our  program  by 
specifically targeting distressing material related to pain (processing 
episodes as part of the patient’s “mental pain film”) or directly targeting 
the pain itself. Through these adaptations, we were able to ensure that 
the therapy content was tailored to the specific needs of our patients, 
allowing for effective processing of traumatic events and pain symptoms. 
This approach of individual group EMDR work to process stressful 
experiences and joint group work for resource activation was found to 
be very supportive and enriching by the patients.

3.1.1 Telephone screening and preliminary 
individual therapy session

Before  admission  to  the  group  therapy  setting,  a  telephone 
screening and a preliminary individual therapy discussion took place 
with all participants (see Table 2). During the screening, the patients 
were given important information about the group, the format, the 
procedure,  and  the  time  frame.  In  addition,  patients  had  the 
opportunity to clarify their own questions regarding the therapy. This 
procedure is of great importance as it gives patients a clear idea of 
what to expect and how the therapy will proceed. In addition, any 
concerns can be clarified in advance, which increases confidence in 
the therapy and can support the success of the treatment. Before the 
group  therapy  began,  there  was  also  an  individual  preliminary 
interview, which was conducted by the group therapists and lasted 
between  20  and  30 min.  In  this  individual  session,  the  therapists 
obtained an overview of the patient’s medical history, explored the 
patient’s treatment motivation, and asked about the patient’s subjective 
pain  history,  psychological  comorbidities  as  well  as  important 
resources  and  competences.  They  were  also  asked  about  their 
expectations of the therapy. Information about the timing of the group 
and any exclusion criteria were assessed. This preliminary consultation 
enabled the therapists to better understand the individual needs and 
prerequisites of the patients and to adapt the therapy accordingly. In 
these discussions, information was also provided about the setting, the 
exposure character and the background of EMDR in trauma and pain 
(such  as  the  AIP  model,  pain  memory  and  the  importance  of 
dysfunctional memories in pain chronification).

3.1.2 The EMDR group protocol for ongoing 
stress

The EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol for Ongoing 
Traumatic Stress (EMDR-IGTP-OTS) is an enhanced version of the 
EMDR  Integrative  Group  Treatment  Protocol  (EMDR-IGTP) 
developed by Jarero and Artigas (2012). Its primary objective is to 
offer a therapeutic framework for individuals who do not experience 
a  subsequent  post-traumatic  safety  window,  such  as  those  facing 
persistent  emotional  distress  and  ongoing  traumatic  exposure, 
including  cases  related  to  cancer.  The  EMDR-IGTP-OTS  aims  to 
facilitate the reprocessing of traumatic memories in such individuals.
Compared to other protocols, the EMDR-IGTP-OTS mainly uses 
drawings and symbols to reprocess the distressing memories. This 
leads to a deceleration of the process and is usually perceived by the 
participants  as  less  stressful  and  more  controllable.  The  version 
adapted for the specific need of patients with pain specifically offers 
the possibility to directly address the pain and the stressful experiences 

associated with it. The EMDR-IGTP-OTS is simple to conduct and 
requires no special equipment or materials. All that is needed is blank 
A4 sheets of paper and crayons to draw on. There is no sharing of 
experiences in the group except for brief feedback after doing an initial 
stabilization  exercise  at  the  beginning:  Strictly  speaking,  the 
IGTP-OTS is therefore not an EMDR group therapy, but a protocol 
for conducting (individual) EMDR therapy in a group setting. Also, 
the history taking is done individually and not in the group. This 
means  that  there  is  only  a  small  risk  of  group  participants  being 
overwhelmed by the experiences of other participants. For alternating 
bilateral  stimulation,  the  EMDR  butterfly  hug  method  for  self-
administered  bilateral  stimulation  (Jarero  and  Artigas,  2023)  is 
recommended.  It  involves  the  individual  crossing  their  arms  and 
alternately tapping their chest with their hands, creating a soothing 
rhythmic  sensation  that  helps  reduce  distress  and  facilitate  the 
processing  of  traumatic  memories  during  EMDR  sessions.  This 
method  promotes  a  sense  of  calm  and  safety,  enhancing  the 
effectiveness  of  the  therapy.  Overall,  the  protocol  is  based  on  the 
classic eight phases of the EMDR standard procedure.

 •  Phase  1:  This  phase  includes  the  client’s  anamnesis,  which  is 
taken individually. Accordingly, each group participant receives 
a  detailed  individual  interview  before  the  start,  in  which  the 
therapist has the opportunity to learn details about the trauma 
history as well as important resources of the patient. This part 
with done beforehand within the preliminary individual therapy 
session before inclusion in the intensified EMDR group program.
 •  Phase  2:  In  the  next  phase,  the  therapists  briefly  introduce 
themselves  and  it  starts  with  a  psychoeducation  session,  the 
introduction to the self-soothing exercises, the Subjective Units 
of Disturbance Scale (SUDS) and the teaching of how to perform 
the butterfly hug.

 •  Phase 3: The next step is to prepare for doing the exposure work 
(“assessment phase”). For this, the participants divide the blank 
A4 sheet in front of them into four rectangles and label them A, 
B, C, and D. In order to capture the full spectrum of traumatic 
stress, participants are asked to run a mental movie of their entire 
pain history, from right the beginning until today, or even to look 
into  the  future.  In  the  first  session,  participants  are  asked  to 
choose the hardest, most painful or distressing moment “From 
the whole mental movie, please choose the hardest, most painful, 
or distressing moment…” Participants are instructed to observe 
which emotions and physical sensations accompany that memory 
at  this  moment.  Then  the  participants  draw  this  moment 
symbolically or in their own way in the square with the letter “A”

and rate the corresponding disturbance level (subjective units of 
disturbance, SUD). Alternatively, in the pain therapy setting, the 
pain itself can be focused on with the help of pain visualization 
(“But you can also try to shape the pain as such. The following 
questions help: If the pain had a colour, what would it be? If the 
pain had a shape, what would that be? If the pain had a different 
texture,  what  would  it  be?  Would  it  be  hard  or  soft?  Rough 
or smooth?”).

 •  Phase  4: The  next  step  is  to  lead  the  group  into  reprocessing 
together (“desensitization phase”). For this, the participants are 
asked  to  consciously  put  themselves  back  into  the  moment 
chosen in square A, applying the bilateral stimuli in the form of 
butterfly hugs until they feel in their body that it has been enough 
(1–3 min on average). The duration of exposure and bilateral 
stimulation thus varies from individual to individual and is based 
on the participants who need the longest. When about 90% of the 
participants have finished the butterfly hug, it is usually possible 
to move on to the next step. After this desensitization procedure, 
the  participants  are  asked  to  draw  in  the  next  square  of  the 
worksheet (B) how they feel now and to assess the corresponding 
disturbance level (SUD).

 •  These instructions for square B and the procedure are repeated 
for square C and D, so that a total of four times the distressing 
memory  is  reprocessed  and  the  respective  degree  of 
disturbance  is  evaluated.  After  the  reprocessing  of  the  last 
square, the participants are asked to look at all the drawings 
and  choose  the  one  that  disturb  them  the  most.  Then, 
participants are asked to turn the paper over and write down 
the corresponding SUD they feel now. Deliberate care is taken 
to ensure that participants do not make the mistake of copying 
only the SUD of the most distressing drawing but write down 
the SUD of the disturbance they are feeling NOW… IN THE 
PRESENT MOMENT.

 •  Phase 5: The next step focuses on the vision of the future. For this, 
participants are guided to draw how they see themselves in the 
future and title their drawing. In this phase, it is NOT necessarily 
about imagining a happy future/outcome or successfully coping 
with  an  expected  future  event,  but  it  is  more  important  that 
participants  are  authentic  and  honest  with  themselves  than 
forcing  positivity.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  contrast  to  the 
standard EMDR protocol in the individual setting, the installation 
of  a  positive  cognition  is  not  provided  in  the  context  of  this 
EMDR group protocol, since in the context of OTS work each 
participant may have a different point in time for reaching an 
ecological level of distress, and thus at the end of a session one or 
the other may well still have blocking beliefs that get in the way 
of installing a positive cognition.

 •  Phase 6: Participants are instructed to remember the drawing 
that disturb them the most, close their eyes and scan their body 
from head to feet and at the end to do the butterfly hug.

 •  Phase 7: Instead, a joint relaxation exercise is carried out with all 
participants at the end of the protocol (“closure phase”), in order 
to release as many participants as possible from the intervention 
in  a  positive  state.  It  is  recommended  that  the  drawings  and 
worksheets  remain  with  the  therapists. This  can  symbolically 
underline  that  the  burden  is  given  or  left  behind—and  not 
taken home.

3.1.3 The group traumatic episode protocol

The Group Traumatic Episode Protocol (G-TEP) provides a group 
therapy approach for individuals who have experienced life-changing 
and  traumatic  events  that  continue  to  have  lasting  effects.  This 
protocol focuses on the entire traumatic episode, including the initial 
traumatic experience and all related events, regardless of how recent 
they may be. This adapted version is applicable even in the absence of 
a  history  of  life-changing  and  traumatic  events.  The  protocol  can 
therefore be used with any patient in pain who reports distressing 
experiences  associated  with  their  pain.  The  therapeutic  process  is 
highly specialized, with the therapist leading participants through a 
step-by-step exposure to the traumatic memories while maintaining 
dual attentional focus using bilateral stimuli. The session is designed 
so that a single worksheet takes you through the process step by step. 
The processing of stressful events is not necessarily chronological. 
Usually,  about  3–5  stressful  events,  so-called  “points  of  distress” 
(=PoDs) are identified. Processing usually takes place in several (2–4) 
sessions of 70–90 min each, possibly on consecutive days. In contrast 
to the EMDR-IGTP-OTS protocol, the G-TEP protocol deliberately 
provides for the exchange of experiences in the group: however, the 
exchange of experiences among the group participants is limited to 
the  stabilizing  elements  and  resource  activation;  the  conscious 
exchange of participants about stressful/traumatic events is limited. 
The treatment setting should include at least one EMDR therapist and 
one  psychosocial  professional  or  trained  assistant  for  every 
10 participants.

For bilateral stimulation, the participants’ self-performed tapping 
on  their  worksheet  is  used  together  with  eye  movements  (as  the 
participants follow their own fingers moving back and forth on the 
worksheet), the Butterfly Hug is only for installing resources. Overall, 
the  protocol  is  based  on  8  different  steps  through  which  the 
participants are guided step by step by the therapist.

 •  The protocol starts with a specific stabilization exercise called the 
“Four  elements  exercise”  which  is  repeated  at  the  end  of  each 
session. The exercise involves focusing on four elements—earth, air, 
water and fire—and identifying personal associations with each 
element. The exercise combines different levels of stress reduction: 
the element “earth” corresponds to grounding, the element “air” 
corresponds  to  the  regulatory  effect  of  breathing,  the  element 
“water” means the specific increase of saliva production to stimulate 
a vegetative relaxation reduction and the element “fire” refers to the 
imaginative power of visualizing through the installation of a safe 
place. By engaging with these elements, individuals can ground 
themselves in the present moment and develop a sense of safety and 
stability.  The  exercise  can  later  be  done  independently  by  the 
participants outside the group setting.

 •  After activating resources, participants are asked to name the 
initial traumatic event they would like to work on. They can do 
this  either  through  a  short  description  or  a  drawing  on  their 
worksheet and then assess the corresponding SUD.

 •  Before the actual trauma exposure begins, a past and a future 
resource  are  first  activated.  Participants  are  asked  to  recall  a 
positive memory and draw or describe it on their worksheet. This 
is then anchored by the butterfly hug.

 •  To  activate  a  future  resource,  participants  choose  a  positive 
cognition  to  represent  how  they  would  like  to  think  about 

Frontiers in Psychology

Vock et al.

themselves in the future. This is also recorded on the worksheet 
to support meta-communication. The trauma is presented on the 
worksheet surrounded by current, past and future resources to 
illustrate that the event is in the past and that there is safety in the 
here and now as well as that the future holds hope.

 •  In  the  next  steps,  the  participants  are  guided  into  the  actual 
process work. To do this, first the relevant targets, the PoDs are 
identified through a non-sequential Google search (“Now let the 
whole episode, everything that happened, from the beginning until 
today, run in front of your inner eye, like a Google search on your 
computer.  Look  for  something  that  is  still  bothering  you,  in  no 
particular chronological order”). Participants identify the PoDs of 
the traumatic event in no pre-given order and process them one 
by one, tapping from one side of the worksheet to the other.

   After identifying a PoD, participants are instructed to visually 
represent it on their worksheet by either drawing or writing. To 
initiate Bilateral Stimulation (BLS), all participants are asked to 
touch the “Disturbance” box (representing the past) and then the 
“Safe Place” box (representing the present) with one hand. They 
are instructed to follow their hand with their eyes while doing so, 
until  they  have  identified  a  PoD.  Once  a  PoD  is  found, 
participants document and enter it into the corresponding box 
on their worksheet. There are different options for the length of 
the bilateral stimulation: For example, the length of each set can 
be set by the group leader (e.g., 10 or 20) and done synchronously 
together in the group under the guidance of the group leader. The 
advantage of this joint tapping is that it promotes group cohesion. 
The disadvantage is that the perceived appropriate length of the 
tapping can vary individually. Alternatively, therefore, the length 
of each set can be left open by the group leader so that everyone 
can tailor it until a change is noticed during the tapping or a 
break  becomes  necessary.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  “Eye 
Movement  Desensitiziation”-strategy  of  this  approach  here 
focuses strongly on the PoD, in contrast to the classical EMDR 
setting, where association chains fostered. That is the dual focus 
of attention returns there again and again and inquires the level 
SUD (Subjective Unit of Disturbance), which however imposes a 
limit on the chains of associations. The protocol recommended 
to use six to nine sets of BLS to reduce the SUD for each PoD as 
much as possible. After each BLS set, participants are asked to 
pay  attention  to  their  thoughts,  feelings,  body  sensations  or 
whatever they perceive. After the 3rd, 6th, and 9th BLS sets, the 
focus is turned back to the PoD and the SUD is rated on the scale 
from 0 to 10 and recorded on the worksheet. These exposures and 
desensitization  steps  are  carried  out  by  each  participant 
individually,  no  exchange  with  other  group  participants  is 
planned in this phase.

 •  After the 9th bilateral stimulation set of a PoD, the SUD level is 
finally  assessed.  If  the  SUD  has  dropped  to  an  ecological 
appropriate  level,  the  next  PoD  can  be  identified  by  another 
“Google search” and processed according to the same procedure 
(3 × 3 sets á 10–20 BLS). Participants whose episodes SUD is still 
very high (SUD > 5), should continue with the same PoDs. It is 
recommended to work on a minimum of 2–3 PoDs per session.
 •  Thereafter, participants once again rate their SUD level for the 
whole episode and choose a positive cognition to anchor (“How 
would you like to think about the whole episode now? What did 
you learn? What do you take away from today?”). At this point, 
sharing their experiences in the group can be helpful. Then the 

cognition  is  written  down  or  drawn  and  anchored  with  the 
butterfly hug.

 •  Finally, after anchoring the positive cognition, the four elements 
exercise is done once again. At the end of a session, the group 
leader should assess how each participant is feeling and identify 
who needs more time to work through the stressful material and 
offer additional support if necessary.

3.1.4 The pain absorption exercise in the group

A modified version of the classical EMDR “absorption technique” 
(Hofmann,  2009)  was  used  for  the  group  setting.  The  aim  of  this 
modification was, on the one hand, to specifically address the patients’ 
pain problems and, on the other hand, to integrate them into the 
group setting in such a way that the advantages of the group could 
be used.

The basis of the modified absorption technique is the same as in 
the classical absorption technique and is based on the principle of 
linking  a  specific  stressful  situation  with  individual  resource-rich 
memories and sensations. However, the focus of the modified version 
is on the pain. Here, the pain is first visualized and the associated 
degree of stress is assessed. In the next step, participants are asked to 
identify individual skills or competencies and the positive body feeling 
associated with them. These are anchored through bilateral stimulation 
by means of a butterfly hug. In the last step, the resources are used to 
address the visualized pain and reduce the associated stress level.

In total, seven steps can be distinguished in this exercise. The 
exercise  starts  with  a  short  explanation  and  general  preparatory 
instructions (step 1). Then the participants are asked to visualize their 
pain (step 2) and to assess the associated current stress level with the 
help of the SUD scale (step 3). In the next step (step 4), the participants 
are  asked  to  name  different  skills  and  competences  that  can 
particularly help them to cope with their pain. This process is done as 
a  group  work  in  order  to  use  the  group  as  a  supportive  and 
empowering environment.

Subsequently (step 5), two individual competencies are selected 
by each participant and these are anchored together with the memory 
of a situation in which they succeeded in using this skill and together 
with the corresponding body feeling by means of bilateral provocation. 
At the end of the exercise, the original pain image is returned to and 
bilaterally  provoked  against  the  background  of  the  two  resources 
(step 6). Finally, the degree of stress is evaluated again (step 7). The 
modified absorption technique thus offers an effective way of working 
on individual pain problems in a group setting, drawing specifically 
on individual resources. The group work enables the exchange and 
strengthening of individual pain management strategies as well as the 
establishment of helpful relationships with other patients who have 
had similar experiences.

3.2 Evaluation of the group—exploratory 
evaluation

All  patients  suffered  from  chronic  pain,  mainly  in  the 
musculoskeletal system. However, we included all eligible patients 
regardless of pain diagnosis. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 63 years 
and all but one were female. Inclusion criteria for participation in the 
group  were  chronic  primary  or  secondary  pain,  willingness  to 
participate  in  group  therapy  and  attendance  at  all  scheduled

appointments. In addition, patients had to be able to self-regulate 
sufficiently and not fulfill any of the absolute contraindications such 
as suicidal tendencies (see Table 3). During the qualitative follow-up 
survey, participants expressed significant benefits derived from two 
key aspects: the opportunity to connect with others who share similar 
experiences, and the utilization of EMDR-specific techniques. These 
aspects were highlighted as particularly valuable and impactful for the 
participants. Assessing potential side effects, no relevant side effects 
were  reported  in  connection  with  the  therapy.  Furthermore,  it  is 
noteworthy that none of the participants reported a strong or very 
strong worsening of their symptoms during the course of therapy. 
These findings reinforce the notion that our therapeutic program is 
both safe and well tolerated within the group setting. Taken together, 
the evaluation reveals positive outcomes and a high level of satisfaction 
among participants. The positive impact of group dynamics, coupled 
with  the  effective  application  of  EMDR-specific  techniques, 
demonstrates the efficacy and potential of our therapeutic program 
for individuals experiencing chronic pain and emotional distress.

4 Discussion

Recognizing the many benefits that group therapy can bring to 
people with chronic pain, we have developed an advanced EMDR 
group therapy program, despite the fact that EMDR has largely been 
researched as an individual intervention. This program aims to create 
a supportive and empowering environment for patients, facilitating 
trauma  processing,  the  acquisition  of  effective  pain  management 
skills,  and  the  formation  of  helpful  bonds  with  others  who  share 
similar experiences. Early pilot studies have been encouraging but 
have also highlighted some unique aspects that need to be considered 
in implementation, including the group setting, length and breadth of 
sessions,  content  design,  inclusion  of  additional  therapeutic 
and  potential  patient 
components, 
exclusion guidelines.

cope with stressful experiences and activate resources to manage their 
suffering.  During  the  pilot  phase,  we  learned  that  building  strong 
group cohesion is crucial for successful EMDR group therapy. Starting 
EMDR  work  too  early  can  be  unproductive  and  cause  patients  to 
withdraw  from  therapy.  To  avoid  this,  our  program  emphasizes  a 
period of intensive group work before EMDR therapy begins. This 
consists of setting group rules and various exercises to help patients 
get to know each other better. We have also found that starting with 
the less intensive EMDR-IGTP-OTS protocol, where the traumatic 
experience is drawn and symbolized, can ease patients into therapy 
and  improve  their  acceptance.  This  approach  has  led  to  better 
acceptance  of  the  more  intensive  G-TEP.  Relative  to  the  EMDR-
IGTP-OTS protocol, the G-TEP protocol induced more emotional 
discomfort among the participants. Although it appeared to promote 
a more intensive processing, it simultaneously necessitated that the 
participants maintain a high level of trust in the setting. Commencing 
with this protocol was found to be disadvantageous, as it made certain 
participants uncomfortable and even resulted in some quitting the 
treatment. Significant improvements in exposure work were achieved 
by  implementing  a  well-structured  approach  that  included  an 
extended  group  work  phase  at  the  beginning  of  the  intervention. 
Targeted efforts to promote group cohesion and a gradual integration 
of  the  EMDR-IGTP-OTS  protocol  for  exposure  work  effectively 
addressed  potential  challenges,  ultimately  leading  to  improved 
outcomes. A clearly structured and consistent treatment framework 
(fixed  therapy  times,  consistent  breaks,  guided  walking)  has  also 
proved  helpful.  This  imitates  to  some  extent  the  protocol-based 
approach of the standard EMDR protocol and thus offers a reliable 
framework for dealing with emotional stress.

4.2 Extension of therapy sessions

Regular  group  therapy  sessions  usually  consist  of  weekly  or 
fortnightly sessions of 50–90 min each (Kaptan et al., 2021). However, 
in the context of EMDR group therapy, this time frame has proven to 
be  insufficient.  In  pilot  studies,  the  session  duration  was  gradually 
increased to 3 h and finally set at around 5 h. There were two main 
reasons for this adaptation: firstly, some participants needed a longer 
preparation time before addressing central distressing and traumatic 
issues,  and  a  longer  session  length  allowed  for  two  processing  and 
exposure units per session. Secondly, the standard therapy time of 50 or 

Severe dissociation or psychosis

 ▪  Individuals with severe dissociative or psychotic symptoms may have difficulty engaging with the structured and 

focused nature of group therapy and may require more individualized treatment to address these symptoms.

Active suicidal ideation, severe self-harming behavior

 ▪  People who have active suicidal or severe self-harming behavior may need more intensive and individualized 

treatment than can be provided in a group setting.

Insufficient social stability

 ▪  Individuals who lack structural (social) and functional (family) support may need more intensive and 

individualized treatment than is possible in a group setting.

Active substance abuse/dependence

 ▪  People who actively use or are dependent on drugs or excessive alcohol may not be suitable candidates for group 

therapy as they may not be able to fully engage with the therapeutic process.

Inability to tolerate a group setting

 ▪  If severe anxiety or other problems make group participation significantly more difficult, individual therapy may 

be a more appropriate form of treatment.

Lack of motivation or commitment

 ▪  Group therapy requires a certain level of motivation and commitment from the participants. If individuals are 

not willing or able to engage in therapy, they cannot benefit from the treatment and disrupt the group dynamic.

90 min was not sufficient for many participants to achieve a satisfactory 
reduction  in  subjective  distress.  By  extending  the  session  time  and 
incorporating repeated exposure within a session, interspersed with 
resource work, these difficulties were overcome, and the effectiveness 
and acceptance of the treatment was significantly improved.

4.3 Integration of complementary 
therapeutic elements into the EMDR 
treatment program

Extending  the  duration  of  individual  therapy  sessions  is 
challenging because participants tend to become increasingly fatigued 
as the session progresses. This was due to the prolonged engagement 
required during therapy, which gradually drains participants’ energy 
levels and reduces their overall level of stamina. Participants reported 
severe mental exhaustion after the emotional arousal and subsequent 
desensitization, so that further treatment was not considered helpful 
by the therapists in this situation. Relaxation exercises or a “free break” 
also did not have a sufficient impact on the group’s perceived energy 
level. The integration of activating elements such as guided walking 
proved  to  be  an  effective  solution  to  overcome  the  participants’ 
exhaustion caused by the long therapy sessions and to restore their 
receptivity. With this in mind, we included a joint activation exercise 
in the treatment program, where patients were invited to take a brisk 
walk accompanied by therapists on a voluntary basis. Furthermore, 
the  effects  of  trauma  confrontation  were  enhanced  by  subsequent 
exercise. This was well accepted by the patients and could positively 
influence the subsequent working atmosphere (Bryant et al., 2023).

4.4 Group cohesion and group therapy 
work

Over the course of the pilot phase, it had become apparent that a 
sufficient  degree  of  trust  in  the  therapeutic  setting  as  well  as  a 
supporting group cohesion is an important prerequisite for working 
on emotionally stressful content. To actively promote this, various 
interventions can be carried out in small and large group work. For 
example, a group therapy intervention was carried out at the beginning 
of a treatment day, in which the participants had to choose a card from 
many different cards with different motives that they felt applied to 
them. They then share with the group why they chose that card. This 
exercise actively promotes group cohesion as the participants gain 
insights into the personality and emotional state of the other group 
members. In addition, this exercise can also serve as a mood screening, 
as it gives an overview of the group’s current mood and state of mind.

4.5 Safety and possible contraindications

Safety is an important aspect to consider when using exposure-
based  therapies.  Studies  on  the  use  of  EMDR  in  the  treatment  of 
patients with post-traumatic stress disorder have not found evidence 
of increased safety risks in group settings (Kaptan et al., 2021). Of the 
22  studies  that  examined  the  use  of  EMDR  in  group  settings,  six 
reported no adverse effects, while five reported that individual EMDR 
sessions were occasionally required and some participants experienced 

an increase in depression, stress and anger during therapy (Kaptan 
et al., 2021). Overall, the available data do not suggest a specific safety 
risk for EMDR group therapy, but the data are not yet sufficient for a 
conclusive assessment.

However,  the  risk  of  possible  side  effects  from  the  exposure 
elements is higher than in purely educational therapy groups. Therefore, 
it  may  well  be  that  individual  participants  need  additional  support 
during or after the group intervention. This should be considered when 
planning and implementing the EMDR group intervention. On the one 
hand,  a  possibility  should  be  created  to  offer  individual  sessions  to 
individual participants who need additional support after the group 
intervention.  Our  experience  has  shown  that  this  only  concerns 
individual cases and that one or two sessions are usually sufficient here. 
However, it is much more common that individual participants need 
additional support during the EMDR intervention—especially in the 
first half of the treatment intervention this can happen—when patients 
on the one hand become increasingly courageous to go into exposure, 
but at the same time the presence of the safe “here and now” through 
the group and the activation of their own resources is not yet sufficiently 
consolidated. For this purpose, the concept of the emotional support 
team was introduced (Jarero et al., 2006): In addition to the group 
leader, a therapist (per 10 participants) should always take part in the 
group to be able to offer additional support to individual participants 
who need it during the therapy. This therapist team does not have to 
actively  participate  in  the  EMDR  work  but  should  be  able  to  help 
individual patients regain a safe state and address additional needs.

Another risk of the group setting is that individual participants 
may  become  distressed  by  the  description  of  the  traumatic 
experiences of other members. This potentially carries the risk of a 
possible  “re-traumatization,”  at  least  if  the  affected  persons  again 
enter a state of extreme fear and helplessness that overwhelms their 
individual  coping  skills.  During  an  exposure,  it  is  the  therapist’s 
responsibility to ensure that participants do not lose contact with the 
safe present in order to minimize the risk of losing control again. The 
therapist also needs to create a supportive group atmosphere that 
provides an appropriate level of safety, control and self-esteem for 
all participants.

In  the  pilot  phase,  the  importance  of  evaluating  individual 
suitability  for  group  therapy  EMDR  was  evident.  The  individual 
pre-session between the patient and therapist played a crucial role in 
this  process.  Here,  the  presence  of  possible  contraindications  (see 
Table 3) and the participant’s sufficient stability should be critically 
examined. In addition, the first therapist’s impression of the participant 
during the first stabilization exercises and exposure units in the group 
can play an important role: If participants have difficulty reducing 
stress during the stabilization exercises or early exposures offered, 
consideration can be given to exclude them from the group program 
and  offering  them  individual  treatment.  While  it  is  important  to 
critically evaluate group suitability before beginning therapy, it should 
also be evaluated after the regular treatment program is completed 
whether individual participants need additional support. If necessary, 
additional (individual) sessions should be offered.

5 Conclusion

In summary, our experience with an intensified outpatient group 
treatment with EMDR suggests that we have developed a promising

treatment program for patients with chronic pain. This provides new 
and promising treatment options, especially for those patients with 
pain who have high levels of emotional distress and post-traumatic 
stress symptoms. The opportunity to share with other patients and the 
pain  management  strategies  learned  are  particularly  promising. 
We  hope  that  future  studies  will  take  up  this  approach  to  further 
develop and optimize the program and prove its effectiveness. This 
could help to better meet the needs of this special group of patients 
and improve their quality of life.
