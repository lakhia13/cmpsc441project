Abstract

This study tested a path model of relationships between military sexual trauma (MST), combat 
exposure, negative urgency, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and alcohol use and 
related problems. The sample consisted of 86 OEF/OIF veterans who reported drinking at least 
one alcoholic beverage per week. PTSD mediated the relationships between MST and alcohol-
related problems, negative urgency and alcohol-related problems, as well as combat exposure and 
alcohol-related problems. In addition, negative urgency had a direct effect on alcohol problems. 
These results indicate that MST, combat exposure, and negative urgency independently predict 
PTSD symptoms and PTSD symptoms mediate their relationship with alcohol-related problems. 
Findings support previous literature on the effect of combat exposure and negative urgency on 
PTSD and subsequent alcohol-related problems. The current study also contributes to the limited 
research regarding the relationship between MST, PSTD, and alcohol use and related problems. 
Clinical interventions aimed at reducing emotional dysregulation and posttraumatic stress 
symptomology may subsequently improve alcohol related outcomes.

Introduction

Military personnel experience a number of stressful events while on active duty including 
frequent changes of duty stations, separation from both extended and immediate family and 
support systems, repeated changes in duty responsibilities, etc. (Burrell, Adams, Durand, & 
Castro, 2006). Moreover, these individuals potentially endure a multitude of adverse 
experiences during deployment such as combat exposure, sexual assault, and sexual 
harassment. Between 46% and 70% of OEF/OIF veterans report some combat exposure 
(Hoge, Auchterlonie, & Milliken, 2006; Milliken, Auchterlonie, & Hoge, 2007). Military 
sexual trauma (MST) is a term used by the Department of Veteran Affairs to label sexual 
assault or harassment that is experienced by a veteran during active duty (Title 38 U.S. Code

1720D). Among samples of OEF/OIF veterans, the rates of MST range from 1%–13% for 
men and 14%–42% for women (Haskell et al., 2010; Katz, Cojucar, Beheshti, Nakamura, & 
Murray, 2012; Kimerling et al., 2010). Research indicates that combat exposure is a 
significant predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol-related problems 
(Hooper et al., 2008; Jacobson et al., 2008; Wright, Foran, Wood, Eckford, & McGurk, 
2012). Additionally, MST is associated with increased rates of PTSD (Foa, Keane, 
Friedman, & Cohen, 2009; Katz et al., 2012; Shipherd, Pineles, Gradus, & Resick, 2009; 
Yaeger, Himmelfarb, Cammack, & Mintz, 2006) and problematic alcohol use (Gradus, 
Street, Kelly, & Stafford, 2008; Kimerling et al., 2010; Suris & Lind, 2008). PTSD and 
alcohol use disorders (AUDs) share high levels of comorbidity, with rates ranging from 41–
79% (Pietrzak, Goldstein, Southwick, & Grant, 2011; Scherrer et al., 2008).

In addition to adverse experiences such as combat exposure and MST, personality factors 
may also increase the risk of both PTSD and alcohol-related problems. Impulsivity, a 
personality factor developing relatively early in life (Clark & Watson, 1999; Eysenck & 
Eysenck, 1985), is associated with greater PTSD symptoms (Miller & Resick, 2007; Weiss, 
Tull, Anestis, & Gratz, 2013) and alcohol-related problems (Burton, Pedersen, & McCarthy, 
2012, Shishido, Gaher, & Simons, 2013). Negative urgency, a facet of impulsivity 
(Whiteside & Lynam, 2001), may be especially important to the development and 
maintenance of PTSD and alcohol-related problems among OEF/OIF veterans. Negative 
urgency refers to the rash action (e.g., excessive substance use, aggressive behavior, etc.) an 
individual may take in response to intense negative affect (Cyders & Smith, 2008) and has 
been independently associated with greater rates of PTSD (Weiss et al., 2013) and alcohol-
related problems in previous research (Settles, Cyders, & Smith, 2010; Wray, Simons, 
Dvorak, & Gaher, 2012; Kaiser, Milich, Lynam, & Charnigo, 2012; Shishido et al., 2013). 
Indeed, prospective research shows that posttraumatic stress symptoms are associated with, 
and predict, higher rates of future alcohol-related problems (Gaher et al., 2014; Hooper et 
al., 2008; Ouimette, Read, Wade, & Tirone, 2010). Due to the high comorbidity between 
PTSD and alcohol-related problems, it is essential to study PTSD and alcohol outcomes 
together in the same model and identify mechanisms to better understand the high 
comorbidity.

Prospective research indicates a relationship between trait negative urgency and alcohol-
related problems that is accounted for by behavioral and emotional dysregulation 
characteristics of PTSD (Gaher et al., 2014). This suggests a functional association between 
negative urgency, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol-related problems. Therefore, PTSD 
symptoms may play an integral function in the relationship between traumatic experiences 
and subsequent alcohol-related problems. Although MST and combat exposure are both 
significant traumatic experiences, the two experiences are distinctly unique. Thus, MST and 
combat exposure may play important, but independent roles in the development of PTSD 
and experience of subsequent alcohol use and related problems. To date, no studies have 
investigated the differential effects of MST and combat exposure on PTSD symptoms, 
alcohol use, and alcohol-related problems in the same model.

The current study tested MST, combat exposure, and negative urgency as independent 
predictors of PTSD symptoms. Moreover, we hypothesized that PTSD would mediate the

relationship between the aforementioned variables and alcohol-related problems. Thus, we 
tested the direct effect of PTSD on alcohol use and on alcohol-related problems. 
Additionally, we hypothesized that negative urgency would have a significant positive 
association with alcohol-related problems above and beyond the effects of PTSD symptoms. 
Retrospective research showed relationships between baseline PTSD and alcohol use 
(Capone, McGrath, Reddy, & Shea, 2013; Jakupcak et al., 2010), thus a direct relationship 
between PTSD symptoms and alcohol use was also tested. Finally, we predicted a 
significant direct effect of PTSD symptoms on alcohol-related problems over and above the 
effects of alcohol use.

Method

Participants

Measures

Participants included 90 OIF/OEF veterans between the ages of 18 and 50 (M = 28.90, SD = 
5.64), who reported consuming at least one drink per week. Exclusion criteria included 
psychosis and severe alcohol dependence, determined by a combination of unstructured 
interviews, and, when necessary, the recommendation of referring clinicians. Eight-six 
participants were utilized for the path analysis due to missing data. The sample was 
predominantly Caucasian (92%) and consisted of 65% males and 35% females. Participants 
were recruited from the local Veteran Affairs (VA) medical center and surrounding area 
through referrals, postings on the VA campus, and local advertisement. All variables were 
obtained during an initial baseline appointment for a longitudinal experience sampling study 
(Gaher et al., 2014).

Demographic information—A self-report questionnaire was provided to assess 
demographic information including participant’s sex, age, military experiences, and 
ethnicity.

Military sexual trauma—The Sexual Harassment Scale from the Deployment Risk and 
Resilience Inventory (DRRI; King, King, & Vogt, 2003) was used to assess MST. This 
measure consists of seven items assessing the frequency of sexual coercion, harassment, and 
assault experience during active duty. All items began with “While I was deployed, unit 
leaders or other unit members” and items included, “…made crude and offensive sexual 
remarks directed at me, either publicly or privately,” “…threatened me with some sort of 
retaliation for not being sexually cooperative (for example, the threat of a negative review, 
physical violence, or to ruin my reputation).” And “…forced me to have sex.” Each item 
was rated on a frequency scale where 0 = never, 1 = once or twice, 2 = sometimes, 3 = many 
times. The total score was used in this study. The alpha for the sample was .75.

PTSD Symptoms—PTSD symptoms experienced during the last month were assessed 
using the 17-item National Center for PTSD Checklist of the Department of Veteran Affairs 
(PCL-Military; Blanchard, Jones-Alexander, Buckley, & Forneris, 1996; Weathers, LItz, 
Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993). Symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) 
to 5 (extremely). The total score was used in this study. The alpha for this sample was .95.

Combat exposure—Combat exposure was assessed using the 15-item Combat 
Experiences Scale of the DRRI (King et al., 2003). Each item described a potential combat 
experience (e.g., being fired on, witnessing death, firing a weapon in combat, killing in 
combat, etc.). Participants responded yes or no to each dichotomous item. Higher scores 
indicated a higher quantity of unique experiences of exposure to combat. The alpha for this 
sample was .88.

Alcohol use—Alcohol use over the past month was measured using the Modified Daily 
Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ-M; Dimeff, Baer, Kivlahan, & Marlatt, 1999). The DDQ-M 
is a seven-day grid in which participants record their typical alcohol use for each day of the 
week over the past month. The total score represented the number of drinks consumed for an 
average week during the month preceding data collection.

Alcohol problems—Alcohol-related problems for the month preceding data collection 
were assessed by The Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC; Miller, Tonigan, & 
Longabaugh, 1995), a 50-item scale assessing negative consequences association with 
alcohol use. Participants responded yes or no to each dichotomous item. Items include, “The 
quality of my work has suffered because of my drinking,” “I have gotten into a physical 
fight while drinking,” and “My marriage or love relationship has been harmed by my 
drinking.” Total scores were used for this study. Higher scores indicate higher rates of 
alcohol-related consequences. The alpha for this sample was .96.

Negative urgency—Negative urgency was assessed using the 12-item negative urgency 
subscale of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-P; Lynam, Smith, Cyders, Fischer, 
& Whiteside, 2007). Participants indicate how much they agree or disagree with statements 
describing ways in which people act and think on a four-point likert scale (1 = Agree 
Strongly, 2 = Agree Some, 3 = Disagree Some, 4 = Disagree Strongly). Items include, 
“When I feel bad, I will often do things I later regret in order to make myself feel better 
now” and “When I am upset I often act without thinking.” Scores were derived by taking the 
mean of the items in the scale. The alpha for this sample was .92.

Results

Descriptive Statistics and Bivariate Correlations

The correlation matrix and descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Seventy-one 
percent of the sample served in the Army, 14% in the Air Force, 8% in the Marines, and 7% 
in the Navy. Over 26% of the sample (24% of men; 30% of women) reported experiencing 
MST. Of the individuals who reported experiencing MST, all reported experiencing sexual 
harassment, 17% reported experiencing sexual assault, and 13% reported experiencing 
sexual coercion. Additionally, the majority of the sample (97%) reported some combat 
exposure. MST exhibited significant positive associations with negative urgency, PTSD 
symptoms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related problems. Negative urgency and combat 
exposure were significantly positively associated and exhibited positive associations with 
both PTSD symptoms and alcohol-related problems. Gender was not significantly correlated 
with any of the measures in the model and thus omitted from the analysis.

Path Analysis

Page 5

The path model was tested using Stata 13 (StataCorp, 2013), with maximum likelihood 
estimation. Thus, due to missing data, 86 participants were used for path model estimation. 
The initial model included direct paths from MST, combat exposure, and negative urgency 
to PTSD symptoms. Additionally, direct paths were specified from PTSD symptoms to 
alcohol use and alcohol-related problems, as well as from alcohol use to alcohol-related 
problems. Lastly, a direct path was specified from negative urgency to alcohol-related 
problems. All hypothesized relationships were significant. The hypothesized model was an 
adequate fit to the data with χ2(5, N = 86) = 8.33, p = .139; RMSEA = .08; CFI = .97; 
SRMR = .05 (See Figure 1).

The indirect effects were calculated using bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals 
(MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams, 2004). The results indicated a significant indirect 
effect from MST to alcohol-related problems (ab = 0.15; 95% CI = .08–.55) through PTSD 
symptoms and alcohol use. Additionally, there were significant indirect effects from combat 
exposure to alcohol-related problems (ab = 0.13; 95% CI = .01–.97), and negative urgency 
to alcohol-related problems (ab = 0.12; 95% CI = .02 – .43).

Discussion

This study investigated the associations between MST, combat exposure, negative urgency, 
PTSD symptoms, and alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. Combat exposure and MST 
were indirectly associated with alcohol use and problems via PTSD symptoms. In other 
words, for individuals who experienced MST and/or combat exposure, the development of 
PTSD symptoms accounts for, at least in part, the association between MST and alcohol 
related problems. Negative urgency was directly associated with alcohol problems, as well 
as indirectly via PTSD symptoms and alcohol consumption. That is to say, negative urgency 
predicts alcohol problems in two ways: independently, as well as via PTSD symptoms. 
Overall, our findings, albeit cross-sectional, are consistent with previous prospective 
research supporting a self-medication functional association between PTSD symptomology 
and alcohol consumption (e.g., Gaher et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 2012). Interestingly, the 
direct effect of PTSD symptoms on alcohol problems was significant over and above the 
effects of alcohol use. Thus, PTSD symptoms predict higher alcohol use, and individuals 
experiencing PTSD symptoms have more alcohol problems regardless of how much they 
drink.

Although MST and combat exposure have a significant impact on PTSD symptoms, other 
individual differences may also predict greater PTSD symptoms in veterans. Negative 
urgency predicted PTSD and alcohol-related problems over and above traumatic exposure 
and alcohol use, suggesting that veterans with dysregulated behavior in response to intense 
negative affect are at increased risk for both PTSD and alcohol-related problems. This is 
consistent with previous findings that demonstrate a temporal relationship between negative 
urgency and PTSD, such that negative urgency and externalizing behavior lead to greater 
PTSD symptoms (e.g., Gaher et al., 2014; Weiss et al., 2013). Moreover, as expected, 
negative urgency had a significant positive relationship with alcohol-related problems over 
and above the effects of PTSD and alcohol use. This finding is especially important because

it indicates that individuals with poor emotion regulation, who act rashly in response to 
intense negative affect, not only have greater PTSD symptoms but may also experience 
alcohol-related problems in the absence of PTSD symptoms. Finally, veterans who 
experience MST are at a significant risk for experiencing PTSD symptoms and alcohol-
related problems regardless of their exposure to combat.

Clinical Relevance

The results of this study have implications for assessment and intervention. In our study, 
individuals with poor emotion regulation, who act rashly in response to intense negative 
affect, not only have greater PTSD symptoms but also experience alcohol problems in the 
absence of PTSD symptoms. Thus, adequate assessment of experiences and individual 
differences (i.e., impulsivity, negative affectivity, and emotional dysregulation) are 
important for treatment planning and implementation. Our findings suggest a complex 
relationship between experiences, emotion regulation, PTSD, and alcohol outcomes. First, 
negative urgency was associated with alcohol problems directly, as well as indirectly 
through PTSD symptoms. Despite the lack of randomized control trial studies, individuals 
with deficits in emotion regulation (i.e., negative urgency) may benefit from a skills building 
intervention (i.e., dialectical behavior therapy [DBT]) that can simultaneously reduce stress 
while developing the skills for effective emotion regulation (Becker & Zayfert, 2001; Hoyt, 
Rielage, & Williams, 2012; Wagner & Linehan, 2006). Theoretically, this treatment would 
have direct and indirect implications on both PTSD symptoms and alcohol-related problems. 
In addition, due to the high rates of comorbidity of PTSD and alcohol use disorders (AUDs), 
especially among veterans (Pietrzak et al., 2011; Scherrer et al., 2008), interventions 
targeting both PTSD and AUDs are of primary interest. Historically, PTSD and AUD have 
been treated separately, with AUD treatment usually preceding PTSD treatment (Ouimette, 
Moos, & Brown, 2003; Resick & Schnicke, 1993; Resick, Nishith, Weave, Astin, & Feuer, 
2002). Integrated treatments that target both PTSD and AUDs have shown mixed results, 
with the majority of trauma-focused interventions yielding similar results as standard AUD 
interventions (see van Dam, Vedel, Ehring, & Emmelkamp, 2012 for review). Our findings, 
however, highlight the need for interventions that successfully treat PTSD symptoms and 
that reducing PTSD symptoms would subsequently decrease alcohol consumption and 
alcohol-related problems. Other research also indicates that improvements in PTSD 
symptomology have been, indeed, associated with decreased substance use and problems 
(Back, Brady, Jaanimagi, & Jackson, 2006; Back, Brady, Sonne, & Verduin, 2006; Hien et 
al., 2010). Thus, trauma-focused therapies may be the most effective treatments for 
comorbid PTSD and AUDs (Coffey, Stasiewicz, Hughes, & Brimo, 2006; Kaysen et al., 
2014; Tuerk, Brady, & Grubaugh, 2009). Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is one such 
intervention that can be used to treat PTSD from either sexual assault or combat exposure 
(Monson et al., 2006; Resick, Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002; Resick & Schnicke, 
1992). CPT is an effective trauma-focused intervention that is also successful in reducing 
substance abuse (Kaysen et al., 2014).

Conclusion

The results of the current study demonstrated indirect associations between two types of 
traumatic exposure (MST and combat exposure) and alcohol use and related problems via

PTSD symptoms. We also highlighted the importance of negative urgency as an independent 
risk factor for PTSD and alcohol-related problems, as well as its indirect effects on alcohol-
related problems via PTSD symptoms and alcohol use. Finally, we demonstrated that 
veterans who experience MST are at a significant risk for experiencing PTSD symptoms and 
subsequent alcohol-related problems independent of combat exposure. This is the first study 
to simultaneously examine MST and combat exposure as independent predictors of alcohol 
use and related problems. Moreover, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first 
study to investigate PTSD symptoms as a mediator in the relationship between MST and 
alcohol-related problems.

Although the current study fills important gaps in the literature, it is not without limitations. 
First, the cross-sectional nature of the data cannot provide causal evidence for the modeled 
relationships. Future research on these relationships should utilize a longitudinal design to 
verify the findings. Next, we utilized a small sample, which limited the amount of variables 
included in the model and the type of analysis (i.e., a latent variable model could not be 
estimated), but replication with a larger sample is necessary to confirm these findings. 
Lastly, the sample was collected from one geographical region and lacked significant 
diversity, thus the results may only be generalizable to a small subset of the general veteran 
population.

MST and combat exposure can have serious implications if left untreated, including PTSD 
and alcohol related problems. Examining these complex relationships in the same model is a 
strength of this study. An additional strength is highlighting the importance of reducing 
PTSD symptomology and increasing emotional regulation as pathways to decrease 
problematic alcohol outcomes.
