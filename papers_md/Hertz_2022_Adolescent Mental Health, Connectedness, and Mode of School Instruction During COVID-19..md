Background: Because COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, nearly 93% of U.S.
students engaged in some distance learning. These school disruptions may negatively inﬂuence
adolescent mental health. Protective factors, like feeling connected to family or school may
demonstrate a buffering effect, potentially moderating negative mental health outcomes. The
purpose of the study is to test our hypothesis that mode of school instruction inﬂuences mental
health and determine if school and family connectedness attenuates these relationships.
Methods: The COVID Experiences Survey was administered online or via telephone from October
to November 2020 in adolescents ages 13e19 using National Opinion Research Center’s Ameri-
Speak Panel, a probability-based panel recruited using random addressebased sampling with mail
and telephone nonresponse follow-up. The ﬁnal sample included 567 adolescents in grades 7e12
who received virtual, in-person, or combined instruction. Unadjusted and adjusted associations
among four mental health outcomes and instruction mode were measured, and associations with
school and family connectedness were explored for protective effects.
Results: Students attending school virtually reported poorer mental health than students
attending in-person. Adolescents receiving virtual instruction reported more mentally unhealthy
days, more persistent symptoms of depression, and a greater likelihood of seriously considering
attempting suicide than students in other modes of instruction. After demographic adjustments
school and family connectedness each mitigated the association between virtual versus in-person
instruction for all four mental health indicators.
Conclusion: As hypothesized, mode of school instruction was associated with mental health
outcomes, with adolescents receiving in-person instruction reporting the lowest prevalence of
negative mental health indicators. School and family connectedness may play a critical role in
buffering negative mental health outcomes.

IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION

Adolescents receiving vir-
tual instruction reported
more stress, mentally un-
healthy days, persistent
depression symptoms,
and likelihood of seriously
considering attempting
suicide than students in
other modes of instruction
and may need additional
support. School and family
connectedness buffered
these relationships.

Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a
pandemic on March 11, 2020, all 50 states in the U.S. closed schools
for in-person learning at some point in time, with extended school
closures from March 2020 through the end of the school year
(MayeJune 2020) in 48 states [1]. In total, nearly 93% of U.S. stu-
dents engaged in some form of distance learning during Spring
2020 [2]. In many cases, these closures continued into the fall of

2020 or winter of 2021, with large portions of students receiving
fully virtual modes of learning, some in hybrid (i.e., partially in-
person and partially virtual) and a smaller portion going to
school fully in-person [3]. Mental health indicators tracked in the
nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey identiﬁed a
trend of declining youth mental health prior to the pandemic. For
example, on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, more youth in grades
9e12 reported being sad or hopeless over the past 2 weeks, re-
ported that they stopped doing usual activities [4], and reported
their mental health over the past 30 days was “not good” [5].
These declines in youth mental health may have been further
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated school
closures [6,7]. More recently, analysis of national trends in emer-
gency department visits found increases in suicide-related visits
among youth during the pandemic, with signiﬁcantly greater in-
creases among girls. The mean weekly number of emergency
department visits involving suspected suicide for girls ages 12e17
in FebruaryeMarch 2021 compared to
was 50.6% higher
FebruaryeMarch 2019, with a 3.7% increase among boys of the
same age during the same time period [8]. These results are
consistent with two international longitudinal studies that also
found associations between COVID-19 and youth mental health
challenges. An Australian study reported increases in youth
depressive symptoms and anxiety and signiﬁcant decreases in life
satisfaction over the course of the pandemic [9]. These negative
mental health effects were predicted by COVID-19-related
worries, online learning difﬁculties, and increased conﬂict with
parents, and were reduced by feeling socially connected, deﬁned
as feeling connected to those close to them, and society more
broadly. The second study, conducted in China with baseline
collection in November 2019 (prepandemic) and follow-up data
collection 6 months later during the pandemic, found signiﬁcant
increases in nonsuicidal self-injury, and suicidal ideation, plans,
and attempts [10].

In prepandemic research, protective factors, like feeling con-
nected to family or school, have demonstrated a buffering effect
and moderated negative mental health outcomes, such as
depression and anxiety [11] and may present opportunities for
building resilience during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.
School connectedness has been deﬁned in a myriad of ways, but
generally includes the subconstructs of student academic
engagement; sense of belonging and fairness; engagement in
school activities; positive peer relations; feeling safe at school;
and feeling supported by teachers [12]. Family connectedness, or
feeling loved, cared for, valued, and respected by one’s parents or
caregivers, is also critically important, and is similarly associated
with buffering against poor mental health. Youth who report
feeling close to their parents are less likely to experience
depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, nonsuicidal self-injury,
and conduct problems [13]. Research has demonstrated the
long-term beneﬁts of both school and family connectedness,
with adolescents with high levels of school and family connect-
edness having lower odds of many negative adult health out-
comes, including emotional distress [14].

Research about the protective effects of school or family
connectedness speciﬁc to youth and COVID-19 is scarce. One U.S.
study found that parent-reported youth “positive adjustment”
(interacts positively with siblings or family members, has positive
social or peer relationships, talks about plans for the near or far
future, hopeful or positive, etc.) buffered some negative mental
health outcomes [15]. Research with adults on connectedness

during COVID-19 and mental health indicates that overall social
connectedness can protect against negative mental health, with
more robust social connections associated with lower levels of
distress and fatigue during the pandemic [16].

This manuscript is grounded in the socialeecological theory
that views child and adolescent development as reciprocal pro-
cesses that evolve over time as an adolescent interacts with
individuals and environments including home, school, commu-
nity, and broader society. Socialeecological theory has been
suggested as a theoretical foundation to inform school psycho-
logical efforts because of its emphasis on promoting the mental
health of all students [17]. During the course of the pandemic,
youth may have experienced stress in their home and school
environments and in their relationships with peers and family
due to changes in school mode or to modiﬁcations to in-person
school settings. Simultaneously, adolescent access to social
support networks such as peers or extended family may have
also shifted as a result of school closures and travel restrictions.
These changes in the environments in which adolescents live,
work, and play, may have inﬂuenced their mental health and
well-being. Thus, this study investigates: (1) the association
between mode of school instruction and mental health chal-
lenges, including symptoms of depression, mental health quality
of life, stress, and suicidal ideation; (2) how the association be-
tween poor mental health and mode of school instruction varies
by race/ethnicity, age, sex, and poverty level; and (3) how school
and family connectedness inﬂuence the relationship between
mental health and mode of school instruction.

Given the lack of data on the relationship between mode of
school attendance and mental health challenges during the
COVID-19 pandemic, the purpose of this study is to address this
gap by describing: (1) the association between mode of school
instruction and mental health challenges, including symptoms of
depression, mental health quality of life, stress, and suicidal
ideation; (2) how the association between poor mental health
and mode of school instruction varies by race/ethnicity, age, sex,
and poverty level; and (3) how school and family connectedness
inﬂuence the relationship between mental health and mode of
school instruction.

Methods

The COVID Experiences nationwide survey was administered
online or via telephone from October 16 to November 6, 2020 in
adolescents ages 13e19 using National Opinion Research Cen-
ter’s AmeriSpeak Panel, a probability-based panel of approxi-
mately 40,000 households recruited using random sampling
from an address-based sample, to examine the relationship be-
tween adolescent mode of school instruction (i.e., in-person only
[hereafter, in-person], virtual-only [hereafter, virtual], or both
virtual and in-person [hereafter, combined]),
for example,
attending school in-person a few days a week and virtually a few
days a week. Nonresponse follow-up was conducted via mail,
e-mail, Internet, telephone, and in-person. The following groups
were recruited for survey participation if they were English-
(ages 18e19);
speaking:
(2) AmeriSpeak Teen Panel members (ages 13e17); and (3) ad-
olescents ages 13e17 residing with an adult AmeriSpeak Panel
member but not participants in the Teen Panel. AmeriSpeak
invited a single adolescent, randomly selected among all eligible
within the household, to the study. Participants age 18 or older

participants under age 18, parent consent and teen assent was
obtained. Among adult panelists qualiﬁed to go through the
nomination/consent for a teen, the completion rate for the con-
sent survey was 69.2%, with 874 teens given consent to be invited
to the COVID Experiences survey and 605 adolescents partici-
pating in the screening process. The screener completion rate for
the parent consenting survey was 39.2%. The incidence rate, the
percentage of qualifying respondents, was 69.8%. The interview
completion rate for 18- to 19-year-olds was 41.1%. Due to the
requirement of enrollment in middle or high school, only four-
teen 18- to 19-year-olds are included in this analysis. The median
duration for survey completion was 20 minutes; respondents
were offered the cash equivalent of $20 for completing the sur-
vey. This activity was reviewed by Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and conducted consistent with applicable federal
law and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention policy; the
study was also reviewed and approved by National Opinion
Research Center’s Institutional Review Board. In total, 727 ado-
lescents ages 13e19 completed the survey. Respondents not
enrolled in grades 7e12 (n ¼ 134) and those reporting home
school or “other” (e.g., schools that do not usually offer in-person
classes and those that selected “other” for school type) as their
mode of instruction in the past 14 days (n ¼ 26) were excluded.
The ﬁnal analytic sample included 567 adolescents, 51.1% (272) of
whom were male, 48.9% (292) female (Table 1).

Measures

Four indicators of mental health challenges were assessed: (1)
stress levels in four areas (at school, home, work, and with
friends) given response options low/moderate/high/very high;
responses were coded for high or very high stress in at least one

area (hereafter “high/very high stress”); (2) mental health-
related quality of life, assessed by number of the past 14 days
(response options: 0, 1 or 2, 3e6, 7e14) with mental health not
good, dichotomized with a cutoff score of (cid:2)7 days (hereafter,
(cid:2)7 days not good mental health); (3) seriously considering
attempting suicide (hereafter, considering suicide) in the past
12 months (response options: yes/no); and (4) persistent
symptoms of depression over the past 2 weeks, assessed by the
[18], with
Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item adolescent
students experiencing (cid:2)3 symptoms on more than half of the
past 14 days (response options: 0, 1 or 2, 3e6, 7e14) considered
to have persistent symptoms of depression (hereafter, persistent
symptoms of depression). Links to mental health resources and a
toll-free national suicide prevention hotline were provided to all
respondents.

Scales were used to assess both school connectedness and
family connectedness. School connectedness was measured us-
ing the six questions from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health’s School Connectedness Scale, including items
such as “I feel like I am a part of this school” and “The teachers at
this school treat students fairly” [19]. Standardized Cronbach’s
alpha ¼ .89. Family connectedness was measured using re-
sponses to ﬁve questions assessing parental monitoring, parente
adolescent communication, and emotional support such as “How
often do you and a parent/caregiver eat dinner together” and
“How comfortable do you feel talking to a parent or caregiver
about how you are feeling (for instance, stress, anxiety, and
depression)?” The standardized Cronbach’s was alpha ¼ .70. As
continuous variables, school connectedness ranged from 6 to 30
and family connectedness ranged from 6 to 20. Low connected-
ness was deﬁned as at or below the 25th percentile ((cid:3)16 for
school connectedness and (cid:3)13 for family connectedness).

Analysis

Unweighted frequencies or weighted prevalence estimates
and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) of demographic characteristics
and mental health indicators and connectedness by school in-
struction mode were calculated. Chi-squared tests identiﬁed
instruction (p < .05).
unadjusted associations by mode of
Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were calculated using pre-
dicted marginals in logistic regression, comparing mental health
indicators by mode of instruction. The ﬁrst model controlled for
categorical demographic variables for age, race/ethnicity, sex,
and poverty
controlled for
demographic variables in addition to continuous variables for
school connectedness (Model 2), family connectedness (Model
3), or both school and family connectedness (Model 4).
Connectedness variables were considered moderators if the aPR
was closer to 1.0 in Models 2, 3, or 4 compared to Model 1.
Findings were considered statistically signiﬁcant if p < .05. The
complex sample design was accounted for using SAS-callable

Results

Within the ﬁnal sample of 567 adolescents, 460 (80.2%) re-
ported enrollment in public school, 36 (7.1%) in private school,

and 69 (12.6%) in some other type of school, for example, a school
that is completely online all of the time, regardless of the
pandemic. A majority (56.3%) of respondents received virtual
instruction; 24.4% received combined instruction and 19.4%
received in-person instruction. Virtual
instruction was more
prevalent among black (68.2%) and Hispanic students (69.0%)
compared to white students (48.1%) (Table 1).

All four mental health indicators were associated with mode
of instruction (Table 2). Students in virtual learning were more
likely than students attending school in-person to report high or
very high stress (44.7% vs. 25.0%). Students in virtual learning
more frequently reported negative mental health risk on three
indicators than students receiving combined or in-person in-
struction: (cid:2)7 days not good mental health (14.5%, 7.6%, and 3.9%,
respectively); considering suicide (13.5%, 8.4%, and 3.8%,
respectively); and persistent symptoms of depression (19.1%,
15.3%, and 7.6%, respectively). When continuous variables for
school and family connectedness were dichotomized (lowest
quartile compared to the three upper quartiles), low school
connectedness was more common for students attending virtu-
ally than those receiving combined or in-person instruction
(34.8%, 19.1%, and 13.3%, respectively) and the association was
statistically signiﬁcant (p ¼ .006). Reported levels of family

As shown in Model 1 (Table 3), adjusting for demographics,
students receiving virtual instruction were more likely than
those in-person to report the following: stress/high stress (aPR
1.78; 95% CI 1.26e2.53); (cid:2)7 days mental health not good (aPR
4.13; 95% CI 1.61e10.55); seriously considering suicide (aPR 3.52;
95% CI 1.41e8.79); and persistent symptoms of depression (aPR
2.58; 95% CI 1.13e5.88).

School connectedness (Model 2) and family connectedness
(Model 3) (Table 3), each independently buffered the relation-
ship between mode of instruction and all four outcomes exam-
ined. Speciﬁcally, adjusting for demographics and school
connectedness
(Model 2) weakened the association and
rendered three previously signiﬁcant associations (Model 1) to
nonsigniﬁcance; and two associations became weaker and
nonsigniﬁcant after adjustment for demographics and family
connectedness (Model 3). For mentally unhealthy days, con-
trolling for school and family connectedness reduced the
magnitude of the association for virtual versus in-person in-
struction from aPR 4.13 (95% CI 1.61e10.55) to aPR 2.72 (95% CI
1.08e6.86). Similarly, for persistent symptoms of depression, the
magnitude of the association for virtual versus in-person in-
struction reduced from aPR 2.58 (95% CI 1.13e5.88) to aPR 1.58
(95% CI .82e3.02). Reductions also occurred for high/very high
stress (aPR 1.78; 95% CI 1.26e2.53 to aPR 1.30; .98e1.73) and
suicidal ideation (aPR 3.52; CI 1.41e8.79 to aPR 2.45; CI 1.22e
4.90) for students attending school in-person versus virtual
school attendance. For all other associations, the aPR was also
reduced after controlling for school and family connectedness.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to report adolescent
data indicating those receiving virtual school instruction may be
at increased risk of mental health challenges, including stress,
symptoms of depression, and suicidal ideation compared to
students attending school in-person or in a combined mode of
instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, adoles-
cents receiving combined school instruction may be at increased
risk for mental health challenges in comparison to those
receiving in-person instruction. However, these associations are
signiﬁcantly reduced when adjusting for feelings of connected-
ness to school or family. The socialeecological model describes
an interrelated process by which positive and negative factors at
all levels of the social ecology (e.g., home, school, neighborhood)
interact and inﬂuence youth well-being. A prevention approach
thus must address all of the contexts in which young people
interact [20].

Schools remain an environment where most young people
spend a signiﬁcant amount of time. Given that most schools were
closed for in-person instruction for a large portion of the 2020e
2021 school year and the potentially broad impact of school
closures on student mental health, a comprehensive, coordi-
nated, multidisciplinary approach to promoting student mental
health and well-being will be needed as students return to in-
person learning. This approach could include engaging diverse
partners across education, health, and mental health to plan for
and meet the needs of students and their families, particularly

62

those who attended school virtually, is critical [21]. For some
students, stressors related to COVID-19 and shifts in schooling
may be exacerbated by pre-existing mental health challenges,
including depression or anxiety, as well other, prior, or co-
occurring traumas, such as witnessing domestic violence, child
abuse or neglect, and ﬁnancial or food insecurities [22,23]. These
students may beneﬁt from individual or family mental health
services. Schools are one of the leading settings for delivery of
mental health services, with 15.4% of students receiving mental
health services in schools, surpassed only slightly by specialty
mental health settings (16.7%) [24]. However, signiﬁcant gaps
remain between those who need mental health services and
those who receive them. In 2019, nearly 57% of adolescents ages
12e17 with major depressive impairment did not receive any
treatment in the year prior to the survey [24]. On average, U.S.
school systems have only 1 counselor per 491 students and 1
psychologist per 1,400 students, far below recommended ratios
[25]. Estimates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic project a po-
tential dire shortage of school counselors, with a projected
deﬁciency of more than 10,000 personnel, relative to projected
need by 2025 [26]. This is particularly important given that
students who feel
like their school counselor knows them
personally and responds effectively to their concerns are more
likely to report feeling connected to their school [27]. As students
return to school, efforts to increase the number of school coun-
selors may be helpful, as they are trained to work with admin-
istrators to develop a comprehensive plan for mental health
promotion, provide direct student services, and broker partner-
ships with community mental health agencies [28].

School-based mental health services may meet the needs for
many, but not all students and families. Partnerships between
health and mental health providers, while always important,
may be of heightened importance in the coming months. Schools
and healthcare providers can establish memoranda of under-
standing or other, less formal arrangements to assist students
and their families in accessing youth friendly, culturally appro-
priate, and affordable mental health services, either on or off
school property [25]. Health practitioners can also provide
training for school staff and workshops for families to promote
overall family functioning and enhance connections among
caregivers, young people, the school, and health providers.
Topics for these efforts may include how to improve communi-
cation between parents and youth; monitor behavior and
well-being of youth in a developmentally appropriate manner;
identify when external mental health assistance may be needed;
and access community or school resources [29]. In clinic settings,
healthcare providers can also implement practices to increase
family connectedness. For example, they can incorporate ques-
tions about family and school relationships into routine visits
and provide resources and referrals to improve the quality of
communication, parental monitoring, and overall family and
school functioning. They can also use interactions with parents to
emphasize the importance of parentechild communication and
encourage joint activities that foster family connectedness, such
as eating meals together as a family [30].

However, the need for mental health support resulting from
the collective experience of COVID-19 [31] for many students is
so pervasive that services alone are necessary, but not sufﬁcient,
to promote recovery and well-being [32]. School connectedness
represents a public health approach to mental health promotion
[33] because of its potential to impact many students simulta-
neously and evidence of its relationship to promoting positive

student mental health outcomes and buffering the impact of
traumatic experiences [34]. Effective school connectedness
strategies include classroom speciﬁc and school-wide programs,
school climate change or management and disciplinary strate-
gies, and activities within the broader community environment
to promote with parent and family involvement [35]. Connect-
edness strategies may be increasingly important as students re-
turn to in-person instruction and can include practices such as
creating decision-making processes that facilitate student, fam-
ily, and community engagement; providing education and op-
portunities enabling families to be actively involved in their
children’s academic and school life; develop students’ academic,
emotional, and social skills to increase school engagement;
implementing effective classroom management and teaching
methods to foster a positive learning environment; and creating
trusting and caring relationships that promote open communi-
cation among administrators, teachers, staff, students, families,
and communities [36]. School connectedness approaches can be
incorporated within existing school frameworks, such as the
Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and layered with other, uni-
versal approaches such as SocialeEmotional Learning strategies.
Future research is needed to investigate the ﬁnding presented
here that students of color were more likely to be in the virtual
mode of school instruction compared to white students. It is
important to understand how mode of school instruction may be
inﬂuenced by prevalence of COVID-19 cases in these commu-
nities; whether or not these families had a choice in mode of
school instruction; and how these disparities in in-person about
school attendance may have been inﬂuenced by other factors, for
example, ﬁnancial or environmental.
In addition, although
sample size prohibited the exploration in this paper, future
research is needed to assess if and how the relationship between
mode of school
instruction and mental health and other
outcomes may vary by race/ethnicity and by sexual minority
status. Finally, as this was a survey of individuals and we were
concerned about their ability to accurately report school level
data, we were not able to assess the relationship between other
school level characteristics (e.g., school size, class size, teachere
student ratio) and student mental health. Additional research
exploring school level characteristics that might inﬂuence school
connectedness and student mental health would be informative
for educational policies and practices.

Findings in this report are subject to several limitations. First,
although data were weighted to approximate representativeness
of U.S. household demographics, ﬁndings may not represent all
U.S. students ages 13e19 years due to limited sample size and
response rate and use of an incentivized, English-language sur-
vey. Second, self-reports are subject to social desirability and
recall biases. Third, adolescents did not report the duration of
in-person or virtual instruction or whether they had a choice in
instruction method. Fourth, the study did not adjust for all
potential confounders such as community COVID-19 trans-
mission levels, some household characteristics (e.g., urbanicity or
rurality), and prior mental health status. Finally, neither causality
nor directionality (e.g., it is possible that students with poor
mental health were more likely to choose virtual or hybrid in-
struction) between instruction mode and indicators can be
inferred from this cross-sectional study.

As demonstrated by the study’s ﬁndings, connectedness can
play a critical role in buffering student stress experienced during
the pandemic. Adolescents receiving in-person instruction re-
ported the lowest prevalence of negative indicators of mental

health. Adolescents receiving virtual or combined instruction
may beneﬁt from additional support, including school and family
connectedness activities and linkages to mental health services.
Understanding the relationship among mode of school instruc-
tion, mental health, and connectedness is critically important as
students return to school and begin to re-engage with healthcare
providers, as the mental health impacts may not be as visible as
physical
impacts but may necessitate additional actions to
reduce risk and foster resiliency.
