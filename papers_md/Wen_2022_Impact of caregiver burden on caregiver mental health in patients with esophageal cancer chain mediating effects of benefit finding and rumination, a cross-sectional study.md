Background:  Cancer  caregivers  are  the  main  supporter  for  the  tumor  patients,  they  not  only  need  to 

provide daily nursing to the patients, but also suffering the pressure from economy, emotion and even family 

members. The mental health of tumor patient is mostly noticed, while not caregivers. The mental health 

of caregiver greatly affected the nursing quality and even the treatment outcomes. In the current study, the 

mechanisms underlying the links between caregiver burden, benefit finding, mental health, and rumination 

in those caring for people with esophageal cancer were examined.
Methods:  The  study  was  using  a  convenience  sampling,  166  esophageal  cancer  patients  in  2  general 

hospitals  in  Jiangsu  Province,  China,  and  caregivers  of  patients  were  included  after  excluded  the  non-

conforming patients. Data were collected using investigator-developed questionnaires, the Benefit Finding 

Scale (BFS), the Event-Related Rumination Inventory (ERRI), the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), and the 

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during May 2020 to December 2020. The results were 

analyzed by SPSS, and the chain mediating effect was analyzed by the the SPSS PROCESS Macro Model.
Results: The study comprised 166 caregivers with an average age of (59.96±11.48) years, most of them 

were female (85.5%). The ZBI was positive correlated with HADS (r=0.882, P<0.01), and negative correlated 

with BFS (r=−0.873, P<0.01). Intrusive rumination and deliberate rumination in caregivers were negatively 

correlated  (r=−0.901,  P<0.01)  and  positive  correlated  (r=0.904,  P<0.01)  with  BFS  scores,  respectively. 

Furthermore, research have discovered a chain mediation impact of benefit finding and rumination between 

caregiver burden and psychological well-being among carers of esophageal cancer patients.
Conclusions: The findings of this study imply that benefit finding and rumination are crucial components 

of the coping strategy used to buffer against negative emotion (such as anxiety and depression). Therefore, 

the mental health of caregivers should also be noticed, and health care professionals should provide targeted 

interventions to increase the caregiver’s level of benefit finding and promote deliberate ruminative thinking.

Introduction

According to estimates, esophageal cancer is the sixth most 
frequent cancer in the world and the ninth most common 
cause of cancer-related deaths (1). China has a high incidence 
of  esophageal  cancer,  accounting  for  53.7%  of  new  cases 
and  55.7%  of  deaths  in  the  world  (2).  The  results  of  the 
annual  report  of  the  Chinese  tumor  registry  showed  that 
the incidence rate of esophageal cancer in China reached 
13.9/100,000 and the mortality rate reached 12.7/100,000 in 
2015 (3). It ranks 6th and 4th in the spectrum of malignant 
tumor incidence and death in China, respectively (4). The 
degree  of  prognosis  of  patients  with  esophageal  cancer 
is  not  optimistic,  with  5-year  survival  rate  not  exceeding  
20% (5). 

A  cancer  diagnosis  can  have  a  huge  impact  not  only 
on  an  individual  patient,  but  also  on  the  entire  family. 
esophageal  cancer  patients  often  suffer  from  reflux, 
wasting and malnutrition (6). The long-term and repeated 
treatment  process  can  impose  a  heavy  burden,  economic 
pressure, and psychological pressure to patients and their 
families [such as anxiety, depression (7,8)]. Multiple studies 
have shown that caregiver burden and mental health status 
can affect the quality of care caregivers provide to patients 
(9,10),  which  in  turn  affects  patient  recovery.  Previous 
studies of caregivers of patients with esophageal cancer have 
reported significant levels of psychological distress (11,12), 
that 30% of caregivers had moderate/high anxiety, 10% had 
moderate/high depression, and a fairly high level of fear of 
re-occurrence. Regression analysis showed that the variables 
evaluated (illness, cognition, and coping) accounted for 35–
49% of the variance in caregiver psychological distress in 
a research of 382 family carers of patients with esophageal 
cancer (12).

Previous  researches  (13,14)  have  found  that  some 
caregivers experience not only negative emotions but also 
positive psychological experiences when caring for cancer 
patients. The caregivers’ mental health is greatly affected 
their  nursing  quality,  a  negative  mental  condition  would 
reduce  their  patience,  and  resulted  in  a  worse  service, 
while  a  positive  emotion  can  bring  a  more  careful  take 
care, and eventually affected the patient’s life quality. The 
mental health of tumor patients are greatly noticed by the 
researchers for it obviously affected the mortality rate, Less 
study has been done on the mental health of those who care 
for someone with esophageal cancer, though. The positive 
factors that affecting the caregivers mental health should be 
carefully studied to maintain the caregivers’ mental health 

and promote their service quality and benefit the patients. 
Antoni  et  al.  (15)  define  this  positive  personal  change, 
benefit finding, as a reappraisal and positive change in an 
individual’s perception of a negative event after experiencing 
a  stressful  or  negative  life  event.  Previous  research  has 
found that positive coping, positive reappraisal, optimism, 
social  support  (16,17),  and  social  constraints  (18)  are 
significantly associated with these positive changes. Benefit 
finding  has  indirect  effects  on  mental  health  by  finding 
positive meaning for events (19).

Rumination  (20)  refers  to  the  cognitive  process  of  an 
individual  after  experiencing  a  significant  stressful  life 
event, where the experience of a stressful event requires the 
individual to engage in cognitive activities with the purpose 
of better understanding the event. Rumination related to 
specific events is thought to play 2 possible roles. The more 
destructive  form,  namely  intrusive  rumination,  manifests 
itself  as  thoughts  that  appear  automatically  beyond  the 
control of the individual and are also unrelated to attempts 
to  solve  the  problem.  The  second  form,  referred  to  as 
deliberate, reflective, or intentional rumination, is a form 
of  constructive  rumination  that  is  thought  perform  two 
potential  functions.  Intrusive  rumination,  which  is  more 
harmful, appears as automatic thoughts that come to mind 
without one’s conscious control and are also unconnected 
to efforts to fix the issue. The second type of rumination is 
regarded to be more helpful and is referred to as deliberate, 
introspective, or intentional rumination (21). The process 
of  addressing  the  difference  between  the  unfavorable 
event experience and the collapse of basic beliefs includes 
intrusive on negative incident. Deliberate rumination, on 
the  other  hand,  can  assist  individuals  in  making  meaning 
of  trauma,  integrating  new  understandings  into  their 
beliefs,  and  processing  the  powerful  emotions  created 
by  the  experienced  event  between  the  experience  of  the 
unfavorable event and the collapse of basic beliefs. In turn, 
deliberate rumination can help individuals make meaning 
of the trauma and incorporate new ideas into their beliefs 
while  dealing  with  the  negative  emotions  caused  by  the 
experienced event (22). The first to emerge was intrusive 
rumination, which was perceived as a direct response to the 
negative events experienced. Later, purposeful rumination 
became more crucial, since it allowed individuals to retake 
control  of  the  situation  and  establish  coping  strategies. 
Rumination appears to be especially crucial in the start of 
constructive transformation following a negative incident. 
Several studies have shown a positive correlation between 
rumination, especially intentional rumination, and the onset

Wen et al. Chain mediating effect of benefit finding and rumination

of positive self-growth. This kind of positive correlation has 
been noted in women with cancer (23), as well as others (24) 
who  have  experienced  various  forms  of  cancer.  Multiple 
studies (25-27) have explored the effects of rumination on 
posttraumatic  growth  (PTG),  showing  that  rumination 
after a traumatic event can promote PTG, and deliberate 
rumination  is  thought  to  restore  the  traumatic  event  and 
rebuild personal belief on the world (28). The 2 concepts of 
BF and PTG share related characteristics, so the terms are 
often used interchangeably (16,29-31).

Multiple studies (28,32) have found that good cognitive 
processing  of  stressful  events  can  promote  effective 
individual  coping.  Fletcher  et  al.  (33)  established  “The 
Cancer  Family  Caregiving  Experience  Model”  for 
caregivers. This model believes that in the dynamic change 
trajectory  of  cancer,  the  diagnosis  of  cancer  initiates  the 
individual’s  cognitive  evaluation  and  coping  process  of 
stress. When  the  caregiver  adopts  a  positive  way  to  deal 
with  stress,  it  will  lead  to  individual  physical  and  mental 
health and well-being.

A c c o r d i n g   t o   “ T h e   C a n c e r   F a m i l y   C a r e g i v i n g 
Experience  Model”,  the  primary  stressor  is  the  burden 
placed  on  cancer  family  carers,  while  the  individual’s 
cognition  and  coping  style  serve  as  mediating  factors 
and  the  caregiver’s  physical  and  mental  health  and  well-
being as outcome variables. Previous research has revealed 
a  relationship  between  benefit  finding  and  intrusive  
thinking (18), but the mechanisms of how benefit finding 
and rumination affect caregiver burden and mental health 
have not been elucidated. Therefore, this study explores the 
chain  mediating  effect  of  benefit  finding  and  rumination 
on  caregiver  burden  and  mental  health,  and  provides 
theoretical support for carrying out caregiver mental health 
intervention. We present the following article in accordance 
with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://
jgo.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jgo-22-884/rc).

Methods

Study design and participants

Cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational designs were 
used  in  this  investigation.  From  May  2020  to  December 
2020,  esophageal  cancer  patients  who  were  hospitalized 
in  the  oncology  department  and  cardiothoracic  surgery 
department  of  2  tertiary  hospitals  (The  Third  Affiliated 
Hospital of Soochow University and Affiliated Hospital of 
Jiangnan University)  in  Jiangsu  Province, as  well as their 

family care members, were chosen for the survey.

The inclusion criteria for patients and caregivers were 
as  follows:  (I)  patients  with  primary  esophageal  cancer 
diagnosed  by  pathology;  (II)  caregiver  age ≥18  years  old; 
(III) the patient’s primary caregiver cares for ≥4 hours/day 
and has cared for the patient for at least ≥4 weeks; (IV) the 
caregiver has no mental illness or intellectual disability, and 
has normal language expression and reading.

The  following  were  the  exclusion  criteria:  (I)  Patients 
with end-stage cancer or other critical illnesses, such as renal 
failure,  respiratory  failure;  (II)  the  caregiver  and  patient 
have an employment relationship; (III) the caregiver has a 
serious  medical  condition  (e.g,,  malignancy,  depression.); 
(IV) patients and caregivers are being investigated in other 
research.

GPower  software  was  used  to  calculate  sample  size 
(version 3.1.9). With 134 responses, the sample size has a 
95.1% validity rate, a 0.3 effect size, and a 5% significance 
level  (two-sided)  (34).  This  study  was  carried  out  in  two 
tertiary  hospitals,  in  Jiangsu  Province,  China,  in  which 
202 patients and caregivers were consented to engage (the 
response  rate  was  89.1%),  and  180  questionnaires  were 
finally returned. The research team evaluated the validity 
of the questionnaires gathered that day and distributed all 
of them to team members who had received questionnaire 
management training for safekeeping. The research team 
evaluated  the  questionnaires,  and  there  were  166  valid 
complete questionnaires (the effective rate was 92.2%).

The  members  of  the  study  team  were  mainly  nursing 
graduate  students,  and  the  team  received  relevant 
training for 1 week before the start of the study, including 
the  research  background,  purpose,  and  significance. 
Researchers read relevant medical records, selected eligible 
patients, and helped participants who had difficulty reading 
questionnaires.  The  researcher  explained  the  purpose  of 
the investigation to the respondents, and all were told to 
voluntarily participate in the study and to withdraw from 
the  study  at  any  time  without  affecting  the  care  of  the 
participants.

This study follows the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised 
in  2013)  (35)  and  adheres  to  the  principles  of  informed 
consent,  security  protection,  privacy  and  confidentiality, 
and  fairness  and  transparency.  The  study  was  approved 
by the ethics committees of the Third Affiliated Hospital 
of  Soochow  University  (No.  2020-CL003-01)  and  the 
Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University (No. LS2020010). 
All participants gave informed consent before participation.

Measures

The researchers reviewed the literature and set up group 
discussions,  mainly  to  investigate  the  demographic  data 
of  patients  and  caregivers  such  as  gender,  age,  education 
level,  family  economic  status,  relationship  with  patients. 
Simultaneous collection of clinical data from patients was 
performed, including the stage of cancer.

This  study  adopted  the  Chinese  version  of  the 
revised  version  of  the  Benefit  Finding  Scale  (BFS)  (36) 
to  assess  caregivers’  BFS  scores.  The  scale  has  22  items 
in  5  dimensions,  including  acceptance  (3  items),  family 
relationships  (6  items),  personal  growth  (7  items),  social 
relations  (3  items),  and  health  behaviors  (3  items).  The 
Likert  5-level  scoring  method  was  used,  and  the  score 
ranged from 22 to 110 points. The scores of each dimension 
were  added  to  obtain  the  total  score  of  the  scale.  The 
total score of the scale is the sum of the scores for each of 
its  dimensions.  A  higher  overall  score  indicates  a  greater 
degree of benefit finding for the carer. The Chinese version 
of the scale has good reliability and validity, the Cronbach’s 
coefficient  of  the  total  scale  is  0.933,  and  it  has  been 
validated in cancer family caregivers (36).

This  study  adopted  the  Chinese  version  of  the  Event-
Related  Rumination  Inventory  (ERRI)  to  assess  the 
rumination  levels  of  caregivers.  The  questionnaire  has 
20  items,  including  2  dimensions:  intrusive  rumination 
and  deliberate  rumination.  Intrusive  rumination  can  lead 
to  individual  psychological  distress  and  hinder  growth 
thinking.  Deliberate  rumination  promotes  individual 
active  thinking  and  adaptive  thinking  for  growth.  A  total 
of 20 items on a four-point scale, with from zero to three 
representing “not at all,” “sometimes,” “often,” and “almost 
always” respectively. The higher the score, the higher the 
individual’s tendency to rumination. The Chinese version of 
ERRI was validated and had reliable reliability (37).

The  level  of  caregiver  burden  was  evaluated  using  the 
Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) (38) 22 items total, with two 
dimensions—personal burden and responsibility burden—
are included in the questionnaire. A score of <21 indicates 
no  burden  or  a  mild  burden,  a  score  of  21–39  indicates 
a  moderate  burden,  and  a  score  of ≥40  indicates  a severe 
burden on each scale, which includes five grades from 0 (none) 
to 4 (always) (39). The Chinese version of the ZBI has good 
reliability and validity for caregiver burden surveys, and the 
Cronbach’s coefficient of the scale is 0.86 (40).

The mental health of caregivers was assessed using the 
Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale  (HADS)  (41).  It 

consists of 14 items, 7 of which are used to assess anxiety 
(HADS-A)  and  7  of  which  are  used  to  assess  depression 
(HADS-D).  Each  item  is  scored  on  a  4-point  scale  from 
0  to  3.  The  Cronbach’s  coefficients  for  the  anxiety  and 
depression subscales of the Chinese version of the HADS 
were  0.83  and  0.82,  respectively  (42).  For  both  HADS-A 
and HADS-D, we divided respondents into subgroups by 
using  a  ≥9-point  depression  or  anxiety  cut-off  to  define 
pathological and non-pathological values, as suggested in a 
previous study (43).

Statistical analysis

IBM’s SPSS 26.0 software was used to analyze the data, and 
the  results  of  common  method  bias  (44)  were  examined 
using the Harman one-way test, which indicates a serious 
common bias if one factor explains more than 50% (45) of 
the common variance (the result is 33.3%). Measurement 
data  conforming  to  a  normal  distribution  are  expressed 
as  (Mean  ±  SD),  and  count  data  were  described  using 
frequency  and  composition  ratios.  Bivariate  relationships 
between variables were detected using Pearson correlation 
analysis. The method of testing mediation uses the currently 
recommended bias-corrected percentile bootstrap method 
for testing the hypothesized chain mediation model. Chain 
mediated  effect  implementation  (Model  6,  the  Process 
Macro)  (46)  was  performed  by  repeated  sampling  5,000 
times and 95% corrected confidence interval (CI) methods. 
Mediated effects are considered statistically significant if the 
95% bootstrap CI for the indirect effect does not contain 
zero  (47,48).  The  direct  effect  is  that  the  independent 
variable direct affect the dependent variable, and when the 
95% confidence interval of bootstrap test does not include 0, 
the effect is valid. The indirect effect is that the independent 
variable  has  an  effect  on  the  dependent  variable  through 
the  intermediary  variable,  and  when  the  95%  confidence 
interval does not include 0 via the bootstrap method, the 
indirect effect is valid.

Study hypothesis

Intrusive  rumination  and  deliberate  rumination  reflect 
negative  and  positive  cognitive  processes,  respectively. 
Therefore, we divided rumination into 2 variables, namely 
intrusive  rumination  and  deliberate  rumination,  to  test 
for  chain  mediated  effects.  We  also  established  2  chain 
mediated models with caregiver burden as the independent

dependent  variable  (Y),  caregiver  deliberate  rumination/
intrusive rumination as the 1st mediating variable (M1), and 
caregiver’s  benefit  finding  as  the  2nd  mediating  variable 

In  this  study,  data  were  collected  from  166  pairs  of 
hospitalized  patients  with  esophageal  cancer  and 
their  caregivers.  The  mean  age  of  the  caregivers  was  
59.96±11.48  years,  the  caregivers  were  predominantly 
women  [142  (85.5%)],  the  majority  of  the  caregivers  had 
secondary school education or less [122 (73.5%)], and the 
caregivers were mostly spouses of the patients [130 (78.3%)], 
as shown in Table 1. The analysis showed that mean value of 
the overall ZBI was 31.39±9.99, as shown in Table 2.

Pearson correlation analysis

Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation 
between  ZBI  and  HADS  (r=0.882,  P<0.01),  such  that 
caregivers  who  scored  higher  on  ZBI  reported  greater 
HADS.  Further,  a  negative  correlation  between  ZBI  and 
BFS  (r=−0.873,  P<0.01).  Intrusive  rumination  and  BFS 
scores in caregivers were negatively correlated (r=−0.901, 
P<0.01),  while  deliberate  rumination  and  BFS  scores  in 
caregivers were positively correlated (r=0.904, P<0.01).  All 
specific data are listed in Table 2.

Mediation effects analysis

To  determine  the  role  of  rumination  and  benefit  finding 
in  the  chain  mediating  between  caregiver  burden  and 
caregiver  mental  health,  the  implementation  method 
was  bias-corrected  percentile  Bootstrap  (5,000  replicate 
samples).

Chain mediation effects 1
The  findings  in  Figure  1  demonstrate  a  statistically 
significant overall impact of caregiver burden on caregiver 
anxiety  and  depression  (c=0.5011,  P<0.01),  the  direct 
effect of the path was c’=0.3564 (P<0.01), and the effect of 
caregiver intrusive rumination on caregiver benefit finding 
was negative (β=−1.6138, P<0.01).

path of the single mediating variable M2 (benefit finding; 
point estimate =0.0598; 95% BC CI: 0.0093, 0.1201) was 
statistically significant. In addition, the pathway of intrusive

statistically significant (point estimate =0.0789; 95% BC CI:

Chain mediation effects 2
The results in Figure 2 show that the total effect of caregiver 
burden on caregiver anxiety and depression was statistically 
significant (c=0.5011, P<0.01), and the direct effect of the 
path was c’=0.3607 (P<0.01). This result is the same as the 
result  of  model  1.  Caregiver  deliberate  rumination  had  a 

positive effect on the benefit finding of caregivers (β=1.5237, 
P<0.01).

As  shown  in  Table  4,  the  path  of  the  single  mediating 
variable  M 1  (deliberate  rumination;  point  estimate 
=−0.005; 95% BC CI: −0.1167, 0.1059) was not statistically 
significant and the path of the single mediating variable M2 
(benefit finding; point estimate =0.0572; 95% BC CI: 0.01, 
0.1125) was statistically significant. In addition, the pathway 
of  deliberate  rumination  and  benefit  finding  as  a  chain 
mediating effect of caregiver burden on caregiver anxiety 
and depression was statistically significant (point estimate 
=0.0882; 95% BC CI: 0.0167, 0.171).

experience”  (33)  as  a  theoretical  basis  (33),  this  study 
investigated  the  direct  relationship  and  pathways  of 
influence between caregiver burden and caregiver mental 
health  in  caregivers  of  Chinese  patients  with  esophageal 
cancer.  The  impacts  of  caregiver  burden,  rumination, 
and  benefit  finding  on  caregiver  anxiety  and  depression 
were  investigated  using  a  chain  mediation  model.  The 
findings  support  the  theoretical  hypothesis  and  validate 
the mediating role of rumination and benefit finding in the 
relationship between caregiver burden and mental health.

The results of this study showed that the benefit finding 
of caregivers was a mediating variable of caregiver burden 
and caregiver mental health. Family caregivers of multiple 

cancer  patients  reported  (49,50)  changes  in  individual 
cognitive  behaviors  in  response  to  negative  events 
while  accompanying  cancer  patients  during  treatment: 
appreciation and acceptance of life, improved interpersonal 
relationships,  spiritual  growth,  and  improved  health 
behaviors. Benefit finding as a cognitive-behavioral process 
for individuals to cope with stress and negative events can 
help  individuals  to  re-build  positive  coping  mechanisms 
(14,51,52).  Studies  on  caregivers  of  esophageal  cancer 
suggested  (12,53)  that  family  caregivers  of  esophageal 
cancer survivors may benefit from cognitive-based therapies 
by  alleviating  their  emotional  turmoil.  The  results  of 
previous intervention studies have shown that health care

professionals can use meaning-centered psychotherapy (54), 
cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention (55), 
brief writing intervention (56), and guided self-disclosure 
intervention  (57)  to  increase  the  benefit  finding  of 
caregivers, reduce caregiver burden, and promote caregiver 
mental health.

The  relationship  between  caregiver  burden  and 
caregiver psychological wellbeing is mediated by caregiver 
rumination  and  benefit  finding.  Cognitive  processing 
(rumination) is considered an important part of the process 
of coping with negative events, and rumination is recurrent, 
event-related  thinking  (37)  that  includes  comprehension, 
problem  solving,  recall,  and  anticipation.  In  the  early 
stages of experiencing a stressful event, rumination is often 
automatic  and  intrusive,  evoking  negative  emotions  (37).  
The diagnosis of cancer triggers the stress coping process, 
and  cognitive  process,  thus  enhances  the  deliberate 
rumination  of  caregivers,  such  as  why  their  beloved 
suffers  from  cancer,  how  it  will  affect  their  future  family 
life,  and  feelings  about  the  experience.  When  this  kind 
of  cognitive  processing  develops  over  time,  intrusive 
rumination is gradually replaced by deliberate rumination, 
which incorporates the traumatic event into the cognitive 
schematic  structure,  constructive  reconstruction  of  the 
stressful event (58), and caregivers develop new worldviews 
and goals to adapt to the consequences caused by the illness, 
implying that they acquire positive changes (37). According 
to  the  findings  of  a  survey  of  cancer  patients  and  their 
caregivers (58), the spouses of patients experienced higher 
levels  of  psychological  discomfort  and  intrusive  thoughts 
than the patients themselves. Influenced by the traditional 
Chinese culture and the concept of filial piety (59), caring 
for cancer patients is an unshirkable responsibility of family 
members  even  if  the  caregivers  themselves  have  health 
problems or face various difficulties. In particular, in caring 

for  patients,  caregivers  tend  to  put  the  patient’s  needs 
above their own (60). In this study, most of the caregivers 
were the patients’ spouses, and the patients’ spouses were 
intimate partners (61) who cared for and accompanied the 
patients for a long time. Family support plays an important 
role  in  the  disease  treatment  process,  and  when  patients 
and  spouses  cope  with  stressful  events  together,  stress 
perceptions are reciprocal, and joint positive coping by both 
spouses helps buffer the impact of stressful events. Studies 
have found that effective self-analysis (32) and timely self-
disclosure (57) of stressful events can effectively facilitate 
gradual  changes  in  cognitive  processes  from  intrusive 
rumination to deliberate rumination. Medical professionals 
can intervene with patients and their spouses (62-64) to help 
improve caregivers’ negative emotions and promote positive 
adaptation and coping. The shortcoming of this study was 
that, it was a cross-sectional study and can not answer the 
clinical question of mediating roles of variables including 
the chain mediating relationships, while it suggested that 
the proposed mechanism in that buffering against negative 
emotions  (anxiety,  depression)  is  an  approach  in  which 
benefit finding and rumination may play important roles. 
Our  study  provided  descriptive  information  in  this  fields 
and raised the concerns of caregivers’ mental health.

Conclusions

The  present  study  confirms  that  rumination  and  benefit 
finding  play  a  chain  mediating  role  in  family  caregiver 
burden  and  caregiver  mental  health.  Rumination,  as  an 
individual’s  cognitive  process  in  response  to  a  traumatic 
negative event, facilitates the generation of positive ways of 
coping, rearranging life, and deciding on priorities. Medical 
professionals can provide caregivers of cancer patients with 
measures based on rumination to promote positive coping
