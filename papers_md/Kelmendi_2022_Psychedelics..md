Summary

Psychedelics are compounds that alter consciousness by acting on serotonin receptors in the brain. 
The term ‘psychedelic’, from the Greek for mind manifesting, refers to the drugs’ subjective 
effects and was first proposed by Humphry Osmond in 1956. Other terms have been used 
to emphasize different aspects of the psychological experiences produced by various related 
compounds, including hallucinogens (perceptual), entheogens (spiritual), and empathogens or 
entactogens (social-emotional). The diversity in terminology reflects the existence of hundreds 
of potential psychedelic compounds with a spectrum of behavioral and neurobiological effects. 
Recent data on the effectiveness of psychedelics for treating mental illnesses has led to a 
resurgence of interest in their neurobiological effects. The purpose of this Primer is to provide 
those interested in the field of psychedelics with a concise and accessible overview of the scientific 
data.

Chemistry

Psychedelics can be divided into three classes based on their chemical structure: 
tryptamines, ergolines, and phenethylamines (Figure 1). Tryptamines are characterized by 
an indole, which is a 6-member benzene ring fused to a 5-member pyrrole ring with an 
ethylamine chain at the C3 position. Addition of methyl groups to the ethylamine chain and 
different functional groups at other positions, e.g., C4 and C5, yields psilocybin, psilocin 
(the active metabolite of psilocybin), DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT (see Figure 1 for full names). 
These compounds are closely related to the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin (also 
5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT), which is a tryptamine with a hydroxyl group at the C5 
position. Ergolines, initially isolated from the ergot fungus and then further processed 
via chemical reactions, include LSD. The phenethylamine class, based on a scaffold of a

Properties

benzene ring with an amino group attached through two-carbon, includes 2C-B, mescaline, 
amphetamine analogues such as DOI and DOM, and derivatives such as 25I-NBOMe.

In addition to the classical psychedelics, there are atypical compounds that produce related 
psychological effects, but do not share the same mechanism of action. These include 
some phenethylamines such as MDMA, deliriants such as muscimol and scopolamine, 
and dissociatives such as salvinorin A, ibogaine, nitrous oxide, phencyclidine (PCP), and 
ketamine. These atypical compounds are sometimes referred to as psychedelics, under a 
broader definition.

Psychedelics can be found naturally in fungi, plants, and animals. Psilocybin, for instance, is 
present in a few hundred species of mushrooms, some of which were used for healing and 
spiritual purposes by the Mayan and Aztec cultures of Mesoamerica. Naturally occurring 
psychedelics such as mescaline (found in peyote and San Pedro cactus) and DMT (as part 
of ayahuasca) may have also held cultural significance for early Indigenous peoples of the 
Americas, although the historical prevalence of these practices is less clear and a matter 
of debate. Other compounds are synthetic and were discovered as part of pharmaceutical 
development programs; these include MDMA by Anton Köllisch in 1912 and LSD by 
Albert Hofmann in 1943 (after initial synthesis in 1938). Today, psychedelics can be 
produced in multiple ways. For example, psilocybin can be obtained through extraction 
from mushrooms, enzymatic reactions in a bioreactor with bacteria or yeast, or chemical 
synthesis.

Psychedelics undergo various chemical reactions upon entering the body. Some are 
prodrugs, meaning that the parent compound is inert but is converted to metabolites that 
can enter the brain to be psychoactive. For example, psilocybin is typically taken through 
the mouth and dephosphorylated to psilocin in the intestinal lining and liver before entering 
blood circulation. By contrast, DMT is not bioavailable when orally ingested because it 
is rapidly eliminated by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in the body. Concurrent use of 
DMT and an MAO inhibitor greatly increases exposure to the drug, leading to enhanced 
and prolonged drug effect. Depending on the route of administration, psychedelics are 
generally considered fast-acting drugs. Psilocin has a half-life of 2.5 hours in blood plasma 
following oral administration of psilocybin in humans with onset of psychoactive effects 
beginning 20 – 40 minutes, with peak concentration and effects between 60 – 90 minutes, 
followed by an approximate 60-minute plateau before decreasing concentration. Within 
6 – 8 hours, the subjective drug effects have mostly disappeared. However, psilocybin 
administered intravenously has a shorter half-life of 30 minutes and a much shorter duration 
of psychoactive effects of 15 – 30 minutes. Eventually, much of the psilocin is converted 
further to more soluble metabolites such as glucuronides and excreted in urine.

Psychedelics exert varied effects on perception, cognition, and mood. First-person accounts 
of the drug-evoked experiences indicate both overlapping and dissimilar features across the 
many compounds. Controlled studies have been performed for several compounds, including 
psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA. For example, psilocybin is reported to increase feelings of

unity and transcendence of time and space, and to produce perceptual alterations akin to 
visual hallucinations, illusions, and synesthesia. However, it can also induce anxiety and 
distressing effects including a dread of ego dissolution, i.e., the loss of one’s sense of self. 
The acute episode is typically remembered long after the drug has left the system; in one 
study, most participants ranked it two months later as a significant, personally meaningful 
experience. There are typically minimal intellectual or memory impairments, and only slight 
autonomic side effects. Dose and route of administration are important variables contributing 
to the variance in behavioral effects.

A cornerstone of psychedelic administration is the concept of “set and setting”, which 
emphasizes the importance of participants’ psychological state (set) and the external 
environment in which the administration takes place (setting). There is evidence 
that administration in a safe physical environment with interpersonal support can 
mitigate negative experiences. With repeated use, people develop diminished response 
to psychedelics. Indeed, drug tolerance is rapidly induced and there is cross-tolerance 
across different psychedelics, which may be one reason that dependence and abuse are 
less common than with many other illicit drugs. Psychedelics are generally considered to 
be physiologically well tolerated, with relatively low toxicity. Adverse events are rare at 
psychoactive doses when administered in a controlled, supervised clinical setting.

Animal models

Psychedelics are noted for their ability to alter consciousness. Since the subjective 
experience cannot be observed externally, other proxy measures are needed to study 
the impact of psychedelics in animals. One popular assay is the head-twitch response. 
After the administration of a psychedelic, animals such as mice, rats, and rabbits 
exhibit rapid and stereotypical head movements that can be recorded with high-speed 
videography or magnetic sensors. When dozens of psychedelics were compared, their 
hallucinogenic potency in humans correlate with their capacity to evoke head twitches 
in mice. Moreover, antagonist drugs that block psychedelic-induced hallucinations also 
abolish head-twitch responses. For these reasons, notwithstanding a few compounds that 
are known false positives, head-twitch response is considered a reliable surrogate readout 
for the hallucinatory experience. Another frequently used assay is drug discrimination. 
Animals undergo operant training for many weeks to distinguish a psychedelic (e.g., LSD) 
from saline and report by pressing one of two levers. During testing, a novel compound is 
presented and its ability to substitute for the psychedelic is evaluated by the lever presses. 
Drug discrimination can yield precise dose-dependence curves; these are typically assessed 
with rats, with fewer studies in mice and monkeys.

In addition to these psychedelic-selective assays, an array of general behavioral tests can 
be used to assess other aspects of drug effects. For example, depressive-like behavior can 
be studied using tests such as learned helplessness and sucrose preference. Psilocybin, 
for one, has been shown to ameliorate stress-induced deficits in mice. However, these 
assays were popularized based on their effectiveness in identifying first and second 
generation antidepressants. An important question is whether the tests are also suitable for 
characterizing the unique effects of psychedelics. Another example is the study of pro-social

effects of MDMA, which can be modeled by measuring social approach in mice (and 
octopuses!). Fear extinction, the decrease after repeated exposure in fear associated with a 
conditioned stimulus, models aspects of exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder 
and may be useful for evaluating the effects of psychedelics in trauma-related disorders. 
Overall, findings in animals suggests potentially beneficial actions, but extrapolating such 
findings to humans is difficult, because each species has its own idiosyncratic behavioral 
repertoire. Moreover, there are species-specific differences in the blood-brain barrier 
permeability and pharmacokinetics of drugs and their metabolites.

Effects on the brain

The effects of psychedelics on the brain can be considered at multiple levels: molecular, 
cellular, circuit, and network (Figure 2). At the molecular level, psychedelics activate 
serotonin receptors at nanomolar concentrations, particularly the 2A subtype of serotonin 
receptors (5-HT2A). Binding of tryptamine and ergoline psychedelics to 5-HT2A receptors in 
the brain is required for the compounds’ consciousness-altering effects. The best evidence 
for this comes from studies involving the administration of selective 5-HT2A antagonist 
ketanserin and the partial antagonist risperidone, which block the subjective effects of 
psychedelics. Other receptor subtypes likely also contribute: most psychedelics bind to 
5-HT2C receptors as well, and many tryptamines and ergolines have high affinity for 5-HT1A 
receptors. Empathogens such as MDMA are exceptions because they act primarily by 
inhibiting serotonin reuptake. Non-serotonin receptors and multi-receptor heterocomplexes 
may be involved, but have only been examined in few studies. An exciting recent 
development is the structural determination of a psychedelic-bound 5-HT2A receptor at near-
atomic resolution. This detailed reconstruction of the receptor paves the way for computer 
simulations to test how thousands of candidate compounds may bind to serotonin receptors, 
enabling a new era of drug discovery.

The binding of psychedelics to serotonin receptors activates different signal transduction 
pathways within neurons. The canonical pathway involves the G-protein Gαq, which upon 
receptor activation dissociates from the receptor and from its Gβγ partners and activates 
other downstream effector proteins. There is a parallel, G-protein-independent pathway 
mediated by β-arrestins. Some psychedelics appear to be biased ligands such that they 
preferentially engage 5-HT2A receptors in conformations that favor β-arrestin signaling 
over the G-protein pathway. In contrast to 5-HT2A receptors, the 5-HT1A receptors are 
Gi/o-protein coupled and activate other signaling proteins.

Engagement of these receptors and signal transduction pathways drives neural plasticity. 
Psychedelics can alter gene expression, including increasing the transcription of immediate 
early genes such as c-fos and other activity-dependent transcription factors associated 
with neural plasticity. Moreover, psychedelics modify the morphology of dendrites, the 
compartment of a neuron that receives most of the inputs from other cells. In cultured 
neurons, various psychedelics including LSD, DMT, and DOI, have been shown to induce 
proliferation of dendritic branches. In live mice, when dendrites are imaged and tracked over 
time, the administration of a single dose of psilocybin increases the number of dendritic 
spines, the sites of excitatory inputs, for at least a month. Collectively, these enduring

transcriptional and structural effects of psychedelics are important, because they persist 
beyond the short half-life of psychedelics in the body, reflecting long-lasting modifications 
to the brain.

Psychedelics are expected to act on certain cell types and in particular brain regions, 
a selectivity shaped by the complex expression patterns of serotonin receptors. 5-HT2A 
receptors are found predominantly in the neocortex, thalamus, locus coeruleus, ventral 
tegmental area, and claustrum. In the neocortex, most 5-HT2A receptors reside on the 
dendrites of excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, although some are expressed in 
other cell types, such as inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Consistent with this expression 
pattern, functional studies have shown that the administration of 5-HT agonists to apical 
dendrites produces an increase in the excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Less is known about 
the subcellular localization of other serotonin receptor subtypes. The impact of psychedelics 
on spiking activity dynamics has been reported for a handful of brain regions, such as the 
frontal cortex and dorsal raphe, but is largely unexplored in other brain areas.

At the level of whole brain, effects of psychedelics on different regions can be visualized 
using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI). Studies in humans revealed that psilocybin reduces activities in the medial frontal 
cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, which compose the default mode network. The default 
mode network is a set of brain regions that are more active during wakeful rest and less so 
when engaging the external world. Connectivity analyses of fMRI data suggest that activity 
covaries more tightly across many regions under the influence of psychedelics. These 
observations have led to intriguing hypotheses, including the idea that default mode network 
suppression may explain the experience of ego dissolution. However, many cognitive tasks, 
disease states, and drugs can also influence the default mode network, so whether this 
phenomenon is unique to psychedelics remains to be clarified.

Therapeutic potential

Mental health professionals in the 1950s and 1960s studied the potential beneficial 
effects of psychedelic drugs, especially LSD. While these studies were not up to 
modern methodological standards, they revealed promising effects in mood disorders 
and addiction. Unfortunately, unregulated recreational use produced a cultural and legal 
backlash, culminating in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, that all but extinguished 
research into the potential therapeutic benefits of these agents. Research began to pick 
up in the late 1990s at a handful of institutions in the United States and Europe. It has 
accelerated enormously over the past ten years, and there is a growing belief among many 
that psychedelic pharmacology may represent a new era in psychiatric therapeutics.

Most clinical studies described over the past decade have focused on psilocybin. Much 
attention has been devoted to developing the appropriate set and setting to accompany the 
dosing experience; this focus sets the therapeutic use of psychedelics apart from many 
other pharmacological interventions, at least in current research practice. Trust and rapport 
are developed between the participant and facilitators through conversations prior to drug 
administration, in which the goal of intentions of treatment are thoroughly discussed. During

the dosing session, one or two trained facilitators are present in the room and serve as 
an anchor for the participant. There are variations: depression studies tend to provide 
interpersonal support primarily during dosing with potentially a few follow-up integration 
sessions, but trials for substance use disorders have embedded psychedelic administration in 
a multi-week course of psychotherapy.

The first controlled studies of psilocybin treatment in the modern era, beginning in 2011, 
investigated its use to ameliorate the anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by 
patients with advanced cancer. Investigators from Johns Hopkins University described a 
randomized, blinded, crossover study of low versus high dose psilocybin in 51 patients with 
advanced cancer. The high dose of psilocybin (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) produced a marked 
and lasting (> 6 months) improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life, 
life meaning, and optimism in 80% of patients. Investigators from New York University 
simultaneously published a study in 29 cancer sufferers treated with psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) 
in comparison to an active placebo, niacin; psilocybin treatment led to lasting improvements. 
These landmark studies garnered enormous attention and made it clear to the broader 
community that the modern era of rigorous research into psychedelic therapeutics had 
arrived.

There have been similarly exciting early studies in the treatment of major depressive 
disorder (MDD) with psilocybin. Griffiths and colleagues administered two doses of 
psilocybin (20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg, one week apart, in conjunction with 
psychological support) to 27 patients with MDD, either immediately or after a waiting-list 
delay. Depression was markedly improved in the psilocybin group, compared to little change 
in the wait-list group. In another study, Carhart-Harris and colleagues randomized 59 
patients with MDD to receive psilocybin (25 mg, with psychological support) and daily 
placebo to low-dose psilocybin (1 mg, with psychological support) and daily escitalopram, a 
commonly prescribed antidepressant. Both groups improved; the trend was towards greater 
improvement in the psilocybin group, though this did not reach statistical significance. 
These studies are small but impressive and suggest a substantial therapeutic benefit in MDD, 
comparable to or greater than that of standard medications. Larger studies are needed to 
corroborate these findings; several are in process.

Treatment studies of psilocybin in numerous other conditions are at an earlier phase. 
A proof-of-concept study in 10 subjects with alcohol use disorder showed that addition 
of psilocybin to standard psychotherapeutic treatment improved abstinence for up to 36 
weeks. Results from a follow-up, controlled study are expected soon. Studies are underway 
in obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia nervosa, headache, 
cocaine use disorder, smoking, and a variety of other conditions.

In parallel work, investigators led by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic 
Studies (MAPS) have investigated the use of MDMA with structured psychotherapy in 
the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with extremely promising results. 
The 90 participants were randomized to receive either MDMA or placebo, in conjunction 
with 12 psychotherapy sessions. Those receiving MDMA had a markedly and significantly 
greater reduction of PTSD symptoms and disability, without significant adverse events.

This finding, capping more than two decades of focused work, represents one of the most 
promising new advances in the treatment of PTSD in many years.

This promising early data, across diagnoses, has caught the attention of regulators. 
Psilocybin and MDMA remain a Schedule 1 drugs and is thus legally available only in 
carefully regulated research settings, under federal law. In a few cases, such as Oregon, state 
and local laws have moved towards a more relaxed stance towards psilocybin use, creating 
a complicated regulatory landscape. The US Food and Drug Administration granted both 
psilocybin and MDMA ‘breakthrough therapy’ status for the treatment of depression and 
PTSD, respectively, acknowledging the promising early data and speeding the regulatory 
path towards approval, if controlled data continue to be positive. However, the legal status of 
these drugs has not been changed, and the data are not yet sufficient for them to be approved 
for any indication.

Open questions

For a more in-depth treatment of the state of the field, we refer the readers to several 
excellent review articles (e.g., Nichols, Pharmacol. Rev., 2016; Vollenweider and Preller, 
Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2020). There are several key questions for which we lack clear answers. 
We know that the 5-HT2A receptors are essential for the subjective effects of psychedelics. 
Is it the same or a different receptor subtype that is responsible for the potential therapeutic 
actions? Relatedly, can we engineer novel psychedelic-like compounds that minimize the 
subjective effects but retains the beneficial actions? What behavioral assays and neural 
measurements will be most effective for screening these new compounds? Psychedelics have 
been shown to promote neural plasticity. Is there something special about those new synaptic 
connections – for example, do they strengthen certain neural pathways in the brain? Finally, 
what are the neural and behavioral consequences of microdosing (the use of psychedelics at 
sub-hallucinogenic dose)?

We are at an interesting juncture in the research of psychedelics. On the one hand, there 
is enormous optimism and enthusiasm, motivated by positive results in small, careful 
studies in mood and anxiety disorders, and early experience in a range of other conditions. 
On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that work to date remains preliminary and 
needs validation by robust multi-site studies. Looking ahead, a deeper understanding of 
the chemistry and neurobiology of psychedelics will facilitate their use and accelerate the 
discovery of novel compounds – advances that will hopefully fulfill the immense potential of 
psychedelic pharmacology for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.

Figure 1: Psychedelic compounds.
Classic psychedelics can be grouped based on their chemical structures into three 
major subtypes: tryptamines, ergolines, and phenethylamines. Empathogens such as 
MDMA are phenethylamines but differ from other compounds in the group by 
their weak or lack of binding to serotonin receptors. Dissociatives and deliriants are 
compounds with related psychoactive properties. Some psychedelics can be found in 
natural sources (green), whereas others can only be synthesized in the lab (blue). 
The illustrations depict examples of natural sources including psilocybe caerulescens 
for psilocybin, bufo alvarius for 5-MeO-DMT, ipomoea corymbosa seeds for LSA, 
echinopsis pachanoi for mescaline, salvia divinorum leaves for salvinorin A, and amanita 
muscaria for muscimol. DMT, N,N-dimethyltryptamine. 5-MeO-DMT, 5-methoxy-N,N-
dimethyltryptamine. LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide. LSA, d-lysergic acid amide. DOI, 
2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine. DOM, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine. 2C-B, 4-

Figure 2: Psychedelics act on the brain at multiple levels.
Using LSD as an example, the compound enters the brain and binds to receptors such as the 
5-HT2A subtype, activating signal transduction pathways within neurons. The consequences 
are alterations in gene expression, neural plasticity including remodeling of the synapses 
and dendrites, and spiking dynamics. At the network level, these effects can be observed as 
brain-wide changes in regional activation and functional connectivity involving hubs such 
as the default-mode network. Adapted from Kim et al., Cell, 2020, Savalia et al., Trends 
Neurosci, 2021, Preller et al., eLife, 2018.
