Abstract 
Background:  Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) are the major public health problems in 
adolescents. Despite the increased focus on these phenomena, there exist no reliable data in Nepal. This study aimed 
to determine the prevalence of NSSI and SB among adolescents. Furthermore the study identified the relationship 
between these two behaviors and assessed demographic, behavioral, and psychological risk factors of NSSI and SB in 
Nepalese adolescents in a representative sample of the general population.

Methods:  The study was conducted among 730 adolescents studying in grade 9 to 12 of public and private schools 
of Pokhara Metropolitan city, Nepal. Data were collected through self administered standard tools- Functional Assess-
ment of Self Mutilation (FASM) tool, Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), Rosenberg self-esteem scale 
(RSES) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Descriptive statistical measures such as frequency, percentage, mean, 
standard deviation, range were used to assess demographic characteristics and adolescent’s behavior regarding NSSI 
and suicide. For inferential analysis chi-square and one way ANOVA test was used. Furthermore, to determine the 
predictors of NSSI and SB, multiple logistic regression analysis was used.

Results:  Regarding behavioral characteristics, nearly half of the sample 327 (44.8%) reported a history of NSSI in past 
1 year. Furthermore, 25.8% (n

SB were at risk of NSSI behavior whereas female sex and adolescents with the history of NSSI were at risk of SB.

Keywords:  Non suicidal self injury, NSSI, Suicidal behavior, Suicidal attempt, Suicidal ideation

Background
Non suicidal self injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) 
are the common self harm behaviors among the adoles-
cents  and  young  adults.  NSSI  refers  to  an  act  involving 
the  direct  and  deliberate  destruction  of  one’s  body  tis-
sue  using  methods  that  are  not  socially  or  culturally 
sanctioned and without the intent to kill oneself [1]. The 
most  common  examples  among  adolescents  includes 
the behaviors such as scratching, banging, burning, cut-
ting,  self  hitting  body  parts  and  interfering  with  wound 
healing  [2–4].  On  the  other  hand  suicide  refers  to  self 
injurious  behaviors  with  the  intent  to  end  one’s  life  [5]. 
Therefore, it is important to differentiate NSSI from sui-
cidal  behavior  based  on  recent  literatures  consensus  on 
“with”  and  “without”  intent  to  die  [6,  7].  Furthermore, 
suicide related thought and behaviors are classified into: 
suicide  ideation,  suicidal  plan,  suicidal  threat  and  sui-
cide  attempt.  Suicide  ideation  is  defined  as  considering 
or  thinking  about  engaging  in  behavior  intended  to  end 
one’s  life;  suicide  plan  refers  to  the  proposed  method 
of  self-injury  through  which  one  intends  to  die;  suicide 
threat refers to any verbal or non-verbal action intended 
to  communicate  that  suicidal  behavior  might  occur  in 
near future and on the other hand suicide attempt refers 
to  engagement  in  potentially  self-injurious  behavior  in 
which there is at least some intent to die [6, 8].

A substantial body of research related to NSSI and SB 
has  been  conducted  in  developed  countries  [2,  9,  10], 
highlighting  the  need  of  such  studies.  But  it  has  been 
neglected  entirely  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries 
[11] and only few studies from Nepal has acknowledged 
on  this  area  [12–14].  Most  of  the  previous  studies  con-
centrated  among  clinical  populations  suggested  high 
prevalence  of  NSSI  among  psychiatric  patients  and  its 
association  with  various  psychiatric  problems  [15,  16] 
whereas  the  recent  studies  highlights  a  high  prevalence 
of  NSSI  in  nonclinical  populations  specially  community 
adolescents  [17,  18].  A  systematic  review  including  52 
international studies analyzed the prevalence of NSSI in 
adolescents  and  reported  a  rate  of  18%  lifetime  preva-
lence  of  NSSI  in  community  sample  [19].  A  higher  rate 
i.e. 34% of adolescents engaging in NSSI at some point in 
their lives was observed in a study conducted in US [20] 
whereas  other  study  reported  that  29.5%  of  adolescents 
were engaged in NSSI, 7.1 to 8.9% had elevated levels of 
suicidal  ideation  (SI),  and  3.3%  of  adolescents  had  sui-
cidal attempt (SA) in the past year [21]. Donath et al. [9] 

also  reported  a  lifetime  prevalence  rate  of  SI  36.6%,  SA 
7.6% and 1 year prevalence of direct self injurious behav-
ior 17.8% in a representative sample of German students. 
In a pooled analysis of the Global School-based Student 
Health Survey (GSHS) across 59 low-income and middle-
income countries, the prevalence of SI and SA was found 
to  be  16.9  and  17.0%  respectively,  highest  in  the  Afri-
can region and lowest in the Southeast Asia region [22]. 
GSHS in Nepal reported the prevalence of SI 13.6% and 
SA 10.3% [13].

NSSI  has  been  associated  with  a  broad  array  of  self-
reported  functions,  including  emotion-regulation,  self-
punishment  or  communication  of  distress  [2,  23–26]. 
Therefore, this behavior is distinguished from SA by the 
absence  of  a  conscious  desire  to  die.  Although  NSSI  is 
distinct  from  SA,  some  studies  indicate  that  50–75%  of 
those individuals with a history of NSSI also have made 
SA  [27,  28].  Numbers  of  other  studies  have  also  shown 
that  NSSI  is  associated  with  SB  and  it  is  a  significant 
predictor  of  subsequent  NSSI  and  SA  [10,  21,  29–34]. 
Among  2131  middle  school  Chinese  adolescents,  the 
lifetime  prevalence  of  NSSI  and  SA  was  23.2  and  3.2% 
respectively while the co-occurrence of these two behav-
iors was reported by 2.3% [33]. Furthermore, it has been 
suggested  that  high  frequencies  of  NSSI  incidents  were 
associated with a significant increase in risk of SI and SA. 
Each additional unit increase in reported NSSI was asso-
ciated with a seven-fold increased likelihood of future SA 
[21]. Anestis et al. [34] also found that 33.6% of individ-
uals  with  prior  history  of  NSSI  had  ever  attempted  sui-
cide compared to only 2.5% of individuals with no prior 
history  of  NSSI.  The  frequent  observations  of  the  coex-
istence  of  NSSI  and  SB  highlight  the  essence  of  assess-
ment  of  the  nature  of  the  link  between  these  two  types 
of behavior. In addition, it is important to underline the 
factors  that  differentiate  adolescents  engaging  in  NSSI 
from SA since not all the adolescents who engage in NSSI 
attempt suicide, and not all the individuals who attempt 
suicide engage in NSSI.

Despite  sound  knowledge  on  human  psychology  and 
continuous  advancement 
in  neurosciences,  suicidal 
behaviors  are  difficult  to  understand  [35].  Scientific  evi-
dences  highlight  the  role  of  genetics,  various  stressors, 
the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  stress-response  sys-
tem, the involvement of the monoaminergic neurotrans-
mitter  systems,  the  lipid  profile,  neuro-immunological 
biomarkers,  the  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  and

other  neuromodulators  on  the  complex  link  between 
suicidal  behavior  and  depression  [36].  Notably,  suicidal 
behavior  has  been  implicated  as  a  co-morbidity  of  sev-
eral  neuropsychiatric  disorders.  Recent  articles,  report-
ing individual cases have also illustrated the link between 
depression  and  suicidal  behaviors  [37,  38].  Moreover, 
studies have shown clear association between depressive 
symptoms  and  NSSI  in  adolescents  and  young  adults, 
both in community [3, 39] and clinical samples [27, 39]. 
Depression,  anxiety,  NSSI  history,  female  gender  and 
younger age are often reported as the predictor of NSSI 
[40, 41]. Similarly, depressive disorders and NSSI history 
are  the  strongest  risk  factor  for  SI  and  SA  [30,  41–43]. 
The adolescents with a history of both attempted suicide 
and NSSI generally experience more psychological symp-
toms  than  adolescents  who  have  engaged  in  only  one 
type  of  self-injury  [44,  45].  SA  and  SA  plus  NSSI  group 
are  significantly  more  likely  to  be  diagnosed  with  major 
depressive disorder than only NSSI group [39, 46]. Simi-
larly,  Brausch  et  al.  also  reported  that  NSSI  group  have 
fewer  depressive  symptoms,  lower  SI,  and  greater  self-
esteem (SE) than the group that also had attempted sui-
cide [47].

NSSI  and  SB  continue  to  be  absolutely  devastating 
problems  among  children  and  adolescents.  It  has  been 
recognized  as  a  public  health  problem  with  high  bur-
den  in  low  and  middle  income  countries.  Despite  the 
increased interest and pursuit of research into NSSI and 
SB, there exists no reliable estimate of the prevalence of 
NSSI and SB in the general Nepalese adolescents. There-
fore, the objectives of the current study are

comprised  of  9  to  12  class  students.  At  first,  list  of  the 
public  and  private  schools  and  number  of  students  of 
each class were obtained from District Education Office, 
Kaski. Number of students in each class ranged from 30 
to  50.  In  initial  stage  of  sampling  strategy,  to  meet  the 
sample  size,  5  public  and  5  private  schools  were  chosen 
from  among  the  total  secondary  level  schools  (9  to  12 
classes),  using  simple  random  sampling  technique  (lot-
tery  method).  In  second  stage,  intact  classrooms  from 
each of chosen school were selected to participate in the 
study and each student of selected classroom was eligible 
to participate in the study. The inclusion criteria for the 
participation  in  the  study  were  that  the  students  should 
of grade 9 to12 and willing to participate in the study.

Sample  size  was  calculated  by  using  the  formula 
n =  z2pq/d2.  According  to  the  study  conducted  in  Kath-
mandu, Nepal at tertiary care centers, the overall preva-
lence  of  lifetime  self-harm  behavior  among  secondary 
level students is 55.6% [14]. So, using this prevalence with 
an allowable error of 5% at a confidence interval of 95%, 
the  sample  size  was  estimated  to  be  380.  To  minimize 
the  design  effect,  sample  was  multiplied  by  1.5  as  clus-
ter  sampling  technique  was  adopted.  Assuming  a  non-
response rate of 20%, calculated sample size was 684.

A  total  of  748  questionnaires  were  distributed  to  stu-
dents  of  selected  classrooms  and  all  of  them  submitted 
the  questionnaires  to  the  researcher  (student  response 
rate = 100%).  Of  them,  18  questionnaires  missed  the 
information  or  were  not  readable,  thus 
important 
excluded from the study. Finally 730 questionnaires (382 
from public schools and 348 from private schools) were 
included in the analysis.

Nepal.

Methods
A cross sectional survey was conducted at selected public

Participants and procedure

Two  stage  cluster  sampling  technique  was  applied  to 
select  representative  sample  from  study  population  that 

Part II

NSSI was assessed through Functional Assessment of Self 
Mutilation (FASM) tool [48]. FASM consists of a check-
list of 12 types of NSSI, denoted as ‘minor NSSI’: hitting 
self, pulling hair, biting self, inserting objects under nails 
or  skin,  picking  at  a  wound,  and  picking  areas  to  draw 
blood; ‘moderate/severe NSSI’: cutting/carving, burning, 
self-tattooing,  scraping,  and  erasing  (i.e.  using  an  eraser 
to rub skin to the point of burning and bleeding) skin [2]. 
The questionnaire also consists of NSSI additional infor-
mation  questions,  and  a  checklist  of  potential  functions 
of NSSI. However in this study NSSI functions were not

assessed.  This  tool  has  been  used  in  several  studies  [2, 
24, 27, 49]. The FASM has demonstrated acceptable psy-
chometric properties within adolescent samples, yielding 
adequate  internal  consistency  ranging  from  0.62  to  0.85 
for each subscale of functions of NSSI [25].

Part III

SB  was  assessed  by  using  Suicidal  Behaviors  Question-
naire-Revised  (SBQ-R).  SBQ-R  consisted  of  four  items, 
each  assesses  different  dimension  of  suicidality:  lifetime 
suicide ideation and / or suicide attempt, frequency of SI 
over the past 12 months, threats of SA, and self-reported 
likelihood  of  SB  in  the  future.  Items  are  scored  using 
a  Likert-scale,  with  between  5  and  7  response  choices 
per item, and are summed for a total score (range 3–18) 
[50].  Higher  score  indicates  higher  levels  of  suicidality. 
Furthermore,  the  cut-off  score  between  suicidal  behav-
ior  (SB)  and  non-suicidal  behavior  for  the  undergradu-
ate  sample  is  identified  as  a  score  of  7  (i.e.,  a  score  of  7 
or above will be classified as suicidal). The internal con-
sistency coefficients of the SBQ-R were 0.76–0.88 in the 
Osman et al. study [50].

Part IV

Depression  was  assessed  by  using  Nepali  version  of  the 
21- item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [51]. The BDI 
is a commonly used self- measure of depressive severity 
that  includes  21  questions  about  various  symptoms  of 
depression.  Each  answers  being  scored  on  a  scale  value 
of 0 to 3. Total scores can range from 0 to 63, with higher 
scores  indicating  more  depression.  The  standardized 
cutoff  point  is:  0–13:  minimal  depression,  14–19:  mild 
depression,  20–28:  moderate  depression,  29–63:  severe 
depression. The Nepali version of BDI has excellent psy-
chometric  properties  (Cronbach’s  alpha = 0.90  and  2 
week test-retest reliability = 0.84) [51, 52].

Part V

SE  was  assessed  by  Rosenberg  Self-esteem  scale  (RSES). 
It is a 10-item measure that assesses an individual’s over-
all  evaluation  of  his  or  her  worth  or  value  [53].  Glob-
ally,  RSES  is  the  most  widely  used  scale  to  measure  SE 
among  adolescents  and  has  been  shown  to  have  good 
reliability. The items are rated using a 4-point likert scale 
(0 = strongly  disagree;  3 = strongly  agree).  The  scoring 
is  obtained  by  doing  the  sum  of  scores  according  to  the 
ratings assigned to all the items after reverse scoring the 
negatively  worded  items  and  score  ranges  from  0  to  30. 
The  score  less  than  15  indicate  a  problematic  low  self 
esteem. The internal consistency reliability of tool ranges 
from 0.85 to 0.88 for college samples [53].

Apart  from  BDI  which  was  available  in  Nepali  lan-
guage,  other  tools  were  translated  into  Nepali  language 
using standard guideline [54].

Data collection procedure

Data  was  collected  on  August  2019  after  getting  ethi-
cal approval from Ethical Review Board of Nepal Health 
Research  Council  (Ref.  No  3051).  Informed  verbal 
consent  was  obtained  from  the  school  authority  after 
explaining the purpose of the study. One day before data 
collection  the  parents/care  giver  of  all  selected  partici-
pants  were  informed  about  the  study  objectives,  nature 
of the survey, participants rights regarding voluntariness 
and withdrawn form study through a letter sent to home 
with their child. Parent’s permission to include their child 
in the study was ensured though signature of the parents 
in  the  informed  consent  form.  Furthermore,  verbal  and 
written  informed  consent  was  obtained  from  the  sub-
jects  prior  to  data  collection.  One-class  period  (approx. 
45 min) was provided to fill in the questionnaire. Consid-
ering the sensitivity of the issue, the school authority was 
requested not to be present in the class during the filling 
in of the questionnaire. However, researcher was availa-
ble to make clear of any queries if present. Students were 
assured that the information they provided would remain 
confidential  and  thus  were  encouraged  to  be  truthful  in 
their responses. They were informed that their participa-
tion was completely voluntary and they could quit at any 
time if they feel uneasy to give answer.

Data analysis

Statistical  Package  for  Social  Sciences  (Version  20;  IBM 
Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data anal-
ysis. Normality was verified using Shapiro–Wilk test, and 
the data were found to be normally distributed (p > 0.05). 
For  the  detail  analysis  of  the  item  1  of  SBQ-R  question, 
the  sub-categories:  suicidal  ideation,  suicidal  plan  and 
suicidal  attempt  were  entered  separately.  Furthermore, 
based  on  the  SBQ-R  cut  of  point  (i.e.  Suicidal  behavior 
(SB):  total  score ≥ 7),  adolescents  were  further  catego-
rized into No-NSSI +No SB group, NSSI only group, SB 
only  group  and  NSSI+SB  group. The  data  was  analyzed 
by using descriptive statistics such as frequency, percent-
age,  mean  and  standard  deviation.  For  inferential  analy-
sis chi-square test was used for categorical variables and 
ANOVA test for continuous variable. Furthermore, mul-
tiple  logistic  regression  was  done  to  identify  the  predic-
tors of NSSI and SB.

Results
Among  730  adolescents  participated  in  the  study  382 
(52.3%) were from public and 348 (47.7%) were from pri-
vate schools. Almost equal percent, 336 (46%) were male 

Poudel et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:96 

Page 5 of 12

and 394 (54%) were female. The mean age of the partici-
pants was 15.85 ± 1.31, ranging from 12 to 19 years. They 
were categorized into early adolescents (10–14 years) 107 
(14.7%) and late adolescents (15–19 years) 623 (85.3%).

NSSI behavior of adolescents

Regarding  behavioral  characteristics,  nearly  half  of  the 
sample 327 (44.8%) reported a history of NSSI in past 1 
year. Furthermore, 25.8% (n = 188) of the overall sample 
engaged in minor NSSI only and 3.42% (n = 25) engaged 
in  at  least  one  act  of  moderate/severe  NSSI.  Twenty 
seven  percent  of  self-injurers  (n = 87)  reported  engag-
ing in only one type of NSSI in the past year, while 66% 
(n = 217)  of  self-injurers  endorsed  engaging  in  two  to 
five  different  types  of  NSSI,  and  7%  (n = 23)  endorsed 
six or more different types of NSSI. The mean number of 
type  of  NSSI  performed  was  2.63 ± 1.71  (median = 2.0, 
mode = 2.0,  range  1–10).  Among  those  adolescents  who 
engage  in  NSSI  in  the  past  year,  the  average  number  of 
incident  was  9.12  (SD =  9.95,  median = 6·0,  mode = 1·0, 
range = 1–102) (Table 1).

The type of NSSI method used were picking at wound 
(27.3%), biting self (20.3%), pulling hair out (11.8%), cut-
ting  oneself  (11.1%),  tattoing  (9.6%),  hitting  self  on  pur-
pose (9.2%), inserting objects under nails and skin (8.1%), 
picking areas of own body to the point of drawing blood 
(7.5%), erased skin (4.2%), burning skin (3.4%) and scrap-
ing own skin (2.3%). Regarding frequency of behavior, the 
most frequently reported forms of NSSI were also picking 
at  the  wound,  biting  self,  pulling  hair  out.  Of  moderate 

to severe NSSI giving self tattoo and cutting on skin was 
common.

Boys  (52.6%)  were  more  likely  to  be  engaged  in  NSSI 
than girls (47.4%) (χ2  =  10.298, p  =  0.002). Similarly, ado-
lescents  studying  in  private  schools  (53.2%)  reported 
more  NSSI  behavior  than  adolescents  of  public  schools 
(37.2%)(χ2  =  10.298,  p  =  0.002).  None  of  the  adolescents 
reported engaging in NSSI while taking drugs or alcohol, 
and the majority of them (75%) reported little or no pain, 
with  the  remaining  4%  reported  severe  pain.  The  mean 
age  of  first  NSSI  incident  was  13.57 ± 1.71 years  and 
ranged from 10 to 17 years. Seventeen percent (n = 56) of 
the self-injurers reported receiving medical treatment as 
a result of their self-injurious behavior.

Suicidal behavior of adolescents

Among 730 adolescents who completed the SBQ-R ques-
tionnaire,  131  (17.9%)  had  SB  (as  defined  by  SBQ-R,  a 
total  score ≥ 7).  Similarly,  120  (16.4%)  had  mild  depres-
sion, 95 (13.0%) had moderate depression and 75 (10.3%) 
had severe depression. Regarding SE 75 (10.3%) had low 
SE and 655 (89.7%) had high SE (Table 1).

Furthermore,  the  percentage  of  participants  who 
reported  past  SI,  past  suicidal  plans  (SP)  and  past  SA 
were also calculated based on Item 1 of the SBQ-R. The 
lifetime  prevalence  of  SI,  SP  an  and  SA  was,  76(10.4%), 
58(7.9%)  and  33(4.5%)  respectively.  Similarly,  regard-

sixty  three  (22.3%)  adolescents  had  threat  of  SA  or  they 
told  to  other  people  as  they  were  going  to  commit  sui-
cide.  Out  of  those,  103  (63.2%)  adolescents  told  once 
and  60  (36.8%)  adolescents  told  more  than  once  to  oth-
ers. The likelihood of SB in future was reported only by 3 
(0.4%) adolescents (Table 2).

Regarding  sex  differences  female  were  significantly 
higher in life time prevalence of SB than male (χ2 = 30.26, 
p = 0.001). No significant differences were noted between 
private and public schools in SB.

Association between NSSI and suicidal behavior

Simple Chi-square tests indicated that NSSI was signifi-
cantly  associated  with  SB  (χ2 = 58.16,  P < .001).  Of  those 
who  had  SB,  74.8%  had  also  engaged  in  NSSI  and  of 
those  who  reported  NSSI,  30.0%  also  had  the  history  of 
SB. Separate analysis of the elements of SB revealed that 
lifetime prevalence was significantly higher among NSSI

Group differences

Based on the adolescent’s NSSI and SB they were catego-
rized into different groups. The No-NSSI +No SB group 
included  370  (50.6%)  adolescents,  the  NSSI  only  group 
had 229 (31.3%) adolescents, SB only group had 33 (4.5%) 
adolescents and NSSI + SB group had 98 (13.4%) adoles-
cents.  Significant  differences  emerged  between  groups 
in  terms  of  all  demographic  and  psychological  charac-
teristics.  SB  only  group  were  predominantly  female  and 
from public school compared to three other groups. Fur-
thermore,  all  the  four  groups  were  mostly  late  age  ado-
lescents (15–19 years), and the difference was significant 
(Table 4).

In  addition,  data  were  analyzed  using  a  one-  way 
ANOVA  with  self-harm  group  as  independent  variable 
and  depression  and  self-esteem  as  dependent  variable. 
The  NSSI+SB  group  were  significantly  more  depressed 
and  had  lower  level  of  self-esteem  than  NSSI  only,  SB 
only and No-NSSI +No SB groups (Table 4).

Logistic regression to identify the predictors of NSSI 
and suicidal behaviors

Logistic  regressions  identified  the  four  significant  pre-
dictors  of  NSSI  behavior:  sex,  SE,  depression  and  SB. 
Dependent  variable,  NSSI  behavior  had  two  categories: 
No  NSSI  and  NSSI  adolescents.  Female  adolescents  and 
those  with  higher  SE  were  less  likely  to  perform  NSSI 
behavior.  Similarly,  compared  to  those  who  do  not  have 
suicidal thought, adolescents who have SI were 4.6 times, 
and  those  who  had  attempted  suicide  were  4.2  times 
higher  risk  of  NSSI  behavior.  Furthermore,  adolescents 
who  had  moderate  to  severe  depression  were  2.6  times 
higher risk of NSSI behavior as compared to minimal to 
mildly depressed adolescents (Table 5).

To  identify  the  predictors  of  SB,  age,  sex,  self-
esteem,  depression  and  NSSI  behavior  was  entered  as

independent  variables.  Based  on  SBQ-R  cut  off  point, 
SB was defined into two group: No SB and SB. Sex, SE, 
depression  and  NSSI  behavior  were  the  independent 
predictors of SB. Female adolescents compared to male 
adolescents were 1.7 times at risk of SB. Similarly, com-
pared  to  those  adolescents  who  do  not  perform  NSSI, 
adolescents who perform only minor type of NSSI were 
2.4 times, moderate to severe type of NSSI performing 
adolescents 8.5 times and those who perform both type 
of NSSI were 5.3 times higher risk of SB. Furthermore, 
adolescents  with  higher  SE  were  less  likely  to  exhibit 
SB  than  adolescents  having  lower  SE  and  adolescents 
who had moderate to severe depression were 3.8 times 
higher  risk  of  SB  as  compared  to  minimal  to  mildly 
depressed adolescents (Table 6).

Discussion
By definition, both NSSI and SA involve intentional harm 
to  oneself  but,  unlike  suicide  attempts,  NSSI  does  not 
involve intent to die. NSSI is a common but often hidden 
behavior, especially among adolescents. Nearly half of the 
sample  44.8%  reported  a  history  of  NSSI  in  past  1  year. 
This proportion is fairly consistent with other studies [2, 
55]. A previous study from Nepal also found higher rate 
of  self  harm  behavior  among  adolescents  with  lifetime 
prevalence  of  55.6%  [14].  Similarly,  a  study  with  similar 
type of sample from US also reported that approximately 
34%  of  the  adolescents  were  engaged  in  some  form  of 
NSSI at some point in their lives, with 16% of the overall 
sample reporting evidence of repetitive NSSI in the past 
6 months  [20].  However,  the  present  study  prevalence 
rate is generally higher than earlier studies of adolescent

community samples [9, 17, 18, 41, 47]. The difference in 
prevalence  rates  might  be  due  to  differences  in  the  cul-
tural background of the sample, as well as use of different 
tools to assess self injuring method.

Furthermore, 66% of self-injurers endorsed engaging in 
two to five different types of NSSI, and 7% endorsed six 
or more different types of NSSI which is almost similar to 
the study by Lloyd-Richardson et al. [2]. Boys were more 
likely  to  be  engaged  in  NSSI  than  girls.  However  some 
other  studies  indicated  higher  prevalence  in  girls  [21, 
56] and some Nepalese and Chinese adolescents did not 
reveal significant gender differences in rates of self-harm 
behavior [14, 17]. The most frequently reported forms of 
NSSI  were  picking  at  the  wound,  biting  self  and  pulling 
hair  out.  Self  tattooing  and  cutting  on  skin  were  com-
mon form of moderate to severe type of NSSI. Study con-
ducted  by  Giri  in  Nepal  also  found  scratching  the  skin, 
tattooing,  preventing  wounds  from  healing  and  cutting 
skin as the commonly chosen method of NSSI [14]. Chi-
nese  adolescents  also  reported  hitting,  pinching,  pulling 
hair  and  biting,  the  frequently  occurring  NSSI  behavior 
[17]. However some studies have suggested picking at the 
wound  is  clinically  insignificant  behavior  [2]  and  biting 
self is a socially acceptable and normative behavior [57].

Suicide  is  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  death  among 
adolescents around the world. In this study the life time 
prevalence  of  SB  was  17.9%.  In  addition,  the  lifetime 
prevalence  of  SI,  SP  and  SA  were,  10.4,  7.9  and  4.5% 
respectively.  Almost  similar  finding  has  been  reported 

with  the  1  year  prevalence  rate  of  8.8  and  3.5%  for  SI 
and SA respectively in a study conducted in China [41]. 
However the prevalence rate found in our study is slightly 
lower  than  that  reported  by  a  global  school  health  sur-
vey  in  Nepal  which  reported  that  nearly  14%  of  school 
students had SI while 10.3% had attempted suicide [13]. 
Global  variation  can  be  observed  with  prevalence  of  SI 
and  SA,  4.9  and  6.7%  in  Bangladesh  [58]  and  11.6  and 
11.3%  in  Bhutan  [59]  respectively.  The  heterogeneity 
across  countries  might  be  due  to  the  effect  of  various 
risk factors associated with SB. Regarding sex differences 
female were significantly higher in life time prevalence of 
SB than male. It has been supported by many studies [13, 
22, 33].

The  present  study  found  the  significant  association 
between  NSSI  and  SB.  NSSI  was  significantly  associ-
ated  with  the  increase  odds  of  SI,  SP  and  SA  (OR:  4.2, 
1.1  and  4.8  respectively).  Of  those  who  were  engaged 
in  NSSI,  8.0%  of  the  adolescents  had  attempted  suicide, 
which is significantly higher than that of people who were 
engaged  in  No-  NSSI  (1.7%).  Furthermore,  13.4%  of  the 
overall sample reported co-occurrence of both NSSI and 
SB. Of those who had SB, 74.8% had also engaged in NSSI 
and  of  those  who  reported  NSSI,  30%  also  had  the  his-
tory  of  SB.  A  high  co-occurrence  of  NSSI  and  SA  was 
observed among outpatient samples of adolescents where 
37%  of  adolescents  with  a  history  of  NSSI  also  reported 
having  made  at  least  one  SA  [29,  39].  A  study  by  Nock 
et al. reported that 55–70% of adolescents with NSSI also 

Poudel et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:96 

Page 9 of 12

had history of attempted suicide [29]. Moreover, a recent 
study found 7.7% lifetime prevalence of co-occurrence of 
NSSI  and  SB,  among  those  with  NSSI,  39.6%  endorsed 
SB, and 66.3% of those with SB reported NSSI [60]. Con-
sistent with the present study, Kiekens et al. [56] reported 
that  NSSI  was  associated  with  increased  odds  of  subse-
quent  suicide  ideation  (OR = 2.8),  plan  (OR = 3.0),  and 
attempt  (OR = 5.5).  These  findings  extend  the  previous 
work  and  provide  evidence  on  co-occurrence  and  asso-
ciation between NSSI and SB [21, 31, 32, 41, 44, 56].

Despite the above evidence that NSSI and SB co-occur, 
these behaviors also differ in many ways in some charac-
teristics [28, 29, 31, 33, 39, 44–47, 61]. In this study, sig-
nificant differences were found between four groups (No 
NSSI and No SB, NSSI only, SB only, NSSI+SB) on age, 
sex,  type  of  school,  depression  and  self-esteem.  SB  only 
group  and  NSSI+SB  group  were  predominantly  female 
and  from  public  school  compared  to  NSSI  only  group. 
In  addition,  NSSI+SB  group  were  significantly  more 
depressed  and  had  lower  level  of  self-esteem  than  NSSI 
only,  SB  only  and  No-NSSI  +No  SB  groups.  Regard-
ing  gender,  the  finding  has  been  contradicted  by  previ-
ous  studies  where  the  groups  were  predominated  by 
female gender but the difference was not significant [39, 
47]  whereas  significant  difference  was  noted  on  a  study 
conducted by Liang et al. [33]. Furthermore, in line with 
this  study,  the  previous  study  found  no  self  harm  group 
reporting  lower  level  of  risk  factors  (hopelessness)  and 
highest level of protective factor (self-esteem) compared 
to NSSI and NSSI+SA groups [47]. The other study also 
identified  that  adolescents  in  NSSI+SA  group  and  SA 
only group were more likely to meet criteria for a major 
depressive disorder than NSSI only group [39]. The cur-
rent  study  findings  provide  evidence  that  adolescents 
with  both  type  of  behavior  are  at  greater  risk  of  having 
sever  form  of  psychological  symptoms  than  adolescents 
with only one type of self harm behavior.

Furthermore,  the  study  identified  low  self-esteem, 
moderate  to  severe  form  of  depression,  history  of  SI, 
history  of  SA  and  male  gender  as  the  significant  pre-
dictors  of  NSSI,  which  differentiates  adolescents  with 
NSSI  from  No  NSSI  group.  A  study  by  Garisch  et  al. 
also reported that higher level of depression and lower 
self  esteem  are  significantly  associated  with  NSSI  [55]. 
In  addition,  a  recent  review  [40]  highlighted  depres-
sive symptoms, suicidality and psychological distress as 
the important predictors of NSSI and our result further 
supports this finding. The same study [40] found female 
gender as the predictor of NSSI, however our study did 
not  support  this  finding.  NSSI  theories  proposed  that 
people who engage in NSSI have particularly high lev-
els  of  emotion  dysregulation,  and  these  feelings  drive 

them to engage in NSSI as a way to improve their mood 
[62].  Moreover,  prior  history  of  suicidal  thought  and 
behavior has been found as the significant risk factor of 
NSSI [63, 64]. In addition, empirical evidence has dem-
onstrated that NSSI is under-taken by some to alleviate 
negative emotions (such as low self-esteem) and may be 
used in times of difficulty in a person’s life [65]. Regard-
ing  gender  in  contrast  to  previous  studies  [30,  64]  the 
current study revealed male as the significant predictor 
of NSSI.

Similarly,  the  lower  level  of  self  esteem,  moderate  to 
severe depression, female gender, minor and moderate 
to severe form of NSSI and engagement in both type of 
NSSI  are  the  significant  predictors  of  SB.  These  vari-
ables  significantly  differentiate  the  individuals  with  SB 
from  without  SB.  Most  of  the  previous  studies  suggest 
that NSSI is a strong risk factor for future SA [10, 11, 27, 
30]. Nock et al. suggests that adolescents who use more 
varied methods to injure themselves are more likely to 
have a history of SA [27]. In addition, NSSI thought and 
higher frequencies of NSSI concurrently are associated 
with  higher  levels  of  suicide  ideation  and  a  history  of 
SA [2, 3, 27, 28, 56]. Moderate to severe form of NSSI is 
associated with increased suicidal thoughts and behav-
iors compared to mild NSSI [2, 41] which is consistent 
with  our  study  finding.  Furthermore,  among  mental 
disorders,  major  depressive  disorder  is  the  strongest 
predictors  of  suicide  and  SB  [42,  66].  In  addition,  a 
meta-analysis of the longitudinal studies identified low 
level of self-esteem as a significant risk factor of SA in 
adolescents and young adults [67].

The  finding  of  this  study  has  to  be  considered  with 
reference to its limitations. The students who are more 
likely  to  have  risk  behaviors  such  as  school  not  going 
students  and  drop  out  students  were  missed  in  the 
study  which  limits  the  generalizability  of  our  find-
ings.  Furthermore,  the  study  findings  depend  on  the 
response  of  adolescents  from  self-administered  ques-
tionnaire  that  might  result  in  recall  bias  and  unwill-
ingness  to  provide  their  personnel  information  might 
have  lead  to  either  over  reporting  or  under  reporting 
of  information.  Moreover,  there  might  be  social  desir-
ability  bias,  since  the  existing  stigma  surrounding  SB 
in  culturally  diversified  Nepalese  societies  might  have 
caused an underreporting of the conditions. In addition 
to this, the cross-sectional nature of the study prevents 
establishing a causal relationship between the variables. 
The  lower  level  of  self  esteem  and  depression  were 
either  cause  or  consequences  of  NSSI  and  SB  has  not 
been identified. Thus, to solve this problem and identify 
the causal relationships, longitudinal and experimental 
studies need to be done.

Conclusion
The  prevalence  of  both  NSSI  and  SB  is  high  in  adoles-
cents.  Despite  the  differences  between  NSSI  and  SB,  a 
significant  number  of  adolescents  reported  a  history  of 
both behaviors. Moreover, two of the strongest NSSI risk 
factors,  lower  level  of  self-esteem  and  depression  were 
also the significant risk factors of SB. Furthermore, Male 
gender and history of SI and SA is the significant predic-
tor of NSSI behavior. Similarly, female gender and adoles-
cents with the history of NSSI behavior are at risk of SB. 
Thus the finding reinforces the importance of assessment 
of  various  risk  behavior  among  the  adolescents  so  that 
prevalence of NSSI and SB can be minimized.

Implication of the study

Although there are plenty of study assessing NSSI behav-
ior among adolescents from the USA, Canada, Australia 
and UK, data on adolescent NSSI are scarce from devel-
oping  country  like  Nepal.  Despite  the  above  limitations, 
as per the researcher’s knowledge this is the first study to 
assess  NSSI  behavior  among  adolescents  in  Nepal.  The 
study  identified  that  large  number  of  adolescents  with 
risk  behavior  are  in  hidden  form,  that  they  need  to  be 
identified  and  appropriate  intervention  should  be  done. 
The finding provides valuable information to parents and 
teachers to assess the adolescent’s behavior and examine 
the  psychological  health  periodically  so  that  risk  behav-
ior  like  NSSI  and  suicide  can  be  prevented  by  adopting 
appropriate  preventive  strategies.  The  study  findings 
could be useful for policy makers in designing appropri-
ate preventive strategies for suicide prevention programs. 
Furthermore,  the  significant  association  found  between 
NSSI and SB; and higher level of depression and low level 
of self-esteem in NSSI+SB group emphasizes the poten-
tial  importance  of  identifying  and  treating  adolescents 
with  a  history  of  NSSI,  and  continuous  assessment  of 
adolescents’  mental  health  status.  In  addition,  sex,  self-
esteem  and  depression  were  identified  as  the  significant 
predictors of NSSI and suicidal behavior (which includes 
suicidal ideation, suicidal plan and suicidal attempt), that 
highlight the importance of consideration of socio-demo-
graphic  characteristics  and  psychological  factors  on  the 
occurrence  of  these  negative  outcomes.  Understanding 
the  reasons  of  NSSI  is  crucial  for  treatment;  and  future 
research  needs  to  elaborate  further  on  previous  work. 
Furthermore,  studies  exploring  the  association  of  self-
esteem  with  NSSI  and  SB  among  adolescents  would  be 
warranted as there is scare of literatures on this topic.
