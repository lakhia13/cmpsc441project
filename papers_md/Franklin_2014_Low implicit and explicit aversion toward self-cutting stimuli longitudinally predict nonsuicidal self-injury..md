Abstract

There is a pressing need to improve the ability to identify individuals at risk for nonsuicidal self-
injury (NSSI; e.g., cutting or burning oneself); unfortunately, beyond prior NSSI, there are few
powerful longitudinal predictors of NSSI. The present study addressed this limitation by
investigating the ability of a novel factor—low aversion to self-cutting stimuli—to longitudinally
predict NSSI in 49 individuals with a history of self-cutting. Results revealed that both low
implicit and explicit aversion to self-cutting stimuli were significantly associated with future NSSI
(rs = .32–.51), and that these associations were unique from several other theoretically important
predictors, including prior NSSI, number of NSSI methods, implicit identification with self-
cutting, self-prediction of future NSSI, emotion dysregulation, and therapy status. These findings
are consistent with the notion that instinctive barriers (e.g., aversion to NSSI stimuli, pain)
dissuade most people from engaging in NSSI, and that the erosion of these barriers may facilitate
NSSI.

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the direct and intentional destruction of one’s own body
tissue in the absence of suicidal intent (e.g., cutting or burning one’s skin; Nock, 2010).
Millions of people engage in these behaviors each year (Klonsky, 2011), with especially
high rates in adolescent, young adult, and clinical populations (e.g., 15% to 60%; see Nock,

2010). Although NSSI itself is a concerning behavior, it is most alarming because of its
strong association with suicidal self-injury. In fact, recent evidence indicates that NSSI is a
stronger longitudinal predictor of future suicidal self-injury than prior suicidal self-injury
(e.g., Wilkinson, Kelvin, Roberts, Dubicka, & Good-year, 2011). Given its prevalence and
dangerousness, there is an urgent need to identify individuals at-risk for engaging in NSSI.
Unfortunately, the nascent literature on the longitudinal prediction of NSSI has produced
few powerful and consistent predictors of NSSI.

Perhaps the most effective known predictor of NSSI is prior NSSI, which is moderately
correlated with future NSSI and tends to wipe out most other effects when simultaneously
entered with other variables (e.g., Chapman, Derbidge, Cooney, Hong, & Linehan, 2009;
Tuisku et al., in press). This highlights the need for additional factors that powerfully predict
future NSSI. Several studies have tested the hypothesis that depression represents such a
factor; however, as a whole, this literature reveals that depression often is weakly and
inconsistently associated with future NSSI. Some studies have obtained relatively small but
significant effects (e.g., Guerry & Prinstein, 2010; You, Lin, & Leung, 2013); others have
found that this effect disappears when controlling for factors such as prior self-injury and
instability of rumination (e.g., Selby, Franklin, Carson-Wong, & Rizvi, 2013; Wilcox et al.,
2012); and still others have found no effect of depression (e.g., Glenn & Klonsky, 2011;
Tuisku et al., in press). Evidence for the predictive ability of factors related to emotion
dysregulation is stronger, but these effects also tend to be weak compared with prior self-
injury (e.g., Wilcox et al., 2012; You et al., 2013). Taken together, this literature suggests
the need for more effective NSSI predictors. Ideally, such predictors would be powerful,
easy to assess, unique from traditional factors such as emotion dysregulation, and able to
predict above and beyond prior self-injury. The primary goal of the present study was to
evaluate a novel factor that recent theory and research suggest may meet these criteria—low
aversion to self-cutting stimuli.

Given that affective reinforcement (i.e., feeling better after NSSI) is the primary reason that
most people give for engaging in NSSI (Klonsky, 2007; Nock & Prinstein, 2005), this factor
has received attention as a potential risk factor for NSSI. However, an accumulating
literature indicates that it is natural to display increased positive affect and diminished
negative affect (compared with baseline) after the removal of a physically painful stimulus
(e.g., Franklin, Lee, Hanna, & Prinstein, 2013; Tanimoto, Heisenberg, & Gerber, 2004).
This natural pain offset relief helps to explain the affective reinforcement of NSSI.
Surprisingly, this pain offset relief does not distinguish between non-NSSI and NSSI groups
(e.g., Franklin et al., 2010, Franklin, Puzia, et al., 2013). In contrast, what we conceptualize
as the barriers to NSSI powerfully discriminate between these groups. For example, many
people avoid NSSI because of the pain involved in these behaviors, and laboratory studies
have shown that individuals who engage in NSSI often are willing to endure pain because
they believe that they deserve punishment (e.g., Franklin, Aaron, Arthur, Shorkey, &
Prinstein, 2012; Hooley, Ho, Slater, & Lockshin, 2010; Hooley & St. Germain, in press).

The aversion to NSSI stimuli also represents an important barrier to self-injurious behaviors.
The aversion to injury and stimuli associated with injury is potent and instinctive (cf. Öhman
& Mineka, 2001). Indeed, in normative samples, mutilation stimuli tend to produce the most

negative affective reactions across a range of self-report and psychophysiological measures
(e.g., Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, & Lang, 2001). Recent theoretical (e.g., Franklin, Puzia,
et al., 2013; Joiner, Ribeiro, & Silva, 2012) and cross-sectional empirical work (Glenn &
Klonsky, 2010; Plener, Bubalo, Fladung, Ludolph, & Lulé, 2012), however, suggests that
individuals who engage in NSSI overcome this instinctive aversion to self-injury stimuli.
Recently, we found that diminished implicit and explicit aversion to self-cutting stimuli
powerfully distinguished between NSSI and non-NSSI groups at baseline (ds = .61 to 1.23)
and were strongly associated with lifetime NSSI frequency (rs = .42 to .46; Franklin, Lee,
Puzia, & Prinstein, in press). This suggests that diminished aversion to self-cutting stimuli
may longitudinally predict NSSI. Nevertheless, it should be noted that baseline group
separation does not necessarily lead to longitudinal prediction. For example, an NSSI-
specific version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) distinguishes between non-NSSI and
NSSI groups as baseline (d = 1.20; Nock & Banaji, 2007), but does not appear to
prospectively predict NSSI (Glenn & Klonsky, 2011). In the present follow-up to Franklin et
al. (in press), we evaluated the hypothesis that greater reductions in aversion to self-cutting
stimuli would be associated with more frequent engagement in future NSSI.

To test this hypothesis, we measured implicit and explicit affective aversion to self-cutting
stimuli in a sample of individuals with a history of self-cutting and then measured their
NSSI frequency over the ensuing 6 months. We measured explicit aversion with a
computerized survey that asked participants to rate the pleasantness/unpleasantness of self-
cutting images. Because individuals may be unwilling or unable to accurately report their
affective responses to self-injury stimuli (cf. Nisbett & Wilson, 1977; Nock et al., 2010), we
additionally measured implicit aversion to these same self-cutting stimuli with the Affect
Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005). To investigate
the independence of these factors, we tested their abilities to predict NSSI uniquely from
other theoretically important factors including prior self-injury, number of NSSI methods,
self-prediction of future NSSI, implicit identification with self-cutting, emotion reactivity,
and therapy status. Finally, in addition to self-cutting, we separately examined overall
noncutting severe NSSI behaviors (i.e., burning, scraping, severe hitting, etc.) as an outcome
variable. This allowed us to investigate whether diminished aversion to self-cutting was
specific to self-cutting or applied to NSSI more broadly.

Participants consisted of 58 individuals recruited from campus, community, and hospital
advertisements that offered $75 for participation in a study related to self-cutting.
Participants were offered an additional $10 for completion of a follow-up survey about NSSI
6 months after their lab visit. A total of 49 (36 women) participants completed the follow-up
portion of the study. Power analyses based on other longitudinal NSSI studies indicated that
this sample size would be sufficient to detect medium-to-large effects. We have reported
baseline findings on the total sample elsewhere (Franklin et al., in press); the present data
are based only on the follow-up sample. There were no significant differences between
individuals who did and did not complete the follow-up on any baseline or demographic

variable (all ps >.20). The present sample had an average age of 24.37 (Mdn = 21.00; SD =
8.28) and an ethnic composition of 61.2% Caucasian American, 8.2% African American,
16.3% Asian American, 4.1% Hispanic American, and 10.2% mixed/other. There were no
significant effects of ethnicity on any measure in the present study (all ps >.20). All
participants reported a history of self-cutting as assessed by the Self-Injurious Thoughts and
Behaviors Interview (SITBI; Nock, Holmberg, Photos, & Michel, 2007). Self-cutting was
selected as a required behavior because it is the most common NSSI behavior (e.g., Nock &
Prinstein, 2005), it is an unambiguously severe NSSI behavior (see Lloyd-Richardson,
Perrine, Dierker, & Kelley, 2007), and we specifically examined implicit and explicit
aversion to self-cutting stimuli. The mean number of lifetime self-cutting episodes was
127.27 (Mdn = 30; SD = 432.48; range = 1–3,000). The mean number of months since the
last self-cutting episode was 11.56 (Mdn = 0; SD = 28.29; range = 0–162).

SITBI—The SITBI (Nock et al., 2007) is a structured interview that measures the presence,
frequency, and characteristics of various types of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. The
SITBI has strong interrater reliability (average K = .99; r = 1.0) and test–retest reliability
(average K = .70; intraclass correlation coefficient = .44) over a 6-month interval (Nock et
al., 2007). In the present study, we employed the NSSI module of the SITBI, which has
shown strong construct validity, converging with other measures of NSSI (average K = .87).
For the present study, we were interested in several variables: (a) the frequency of self-
cutting during the 6 months before and after the laboratory visit; (b) the frequency of other
(i.e., noncutting) severe NSSI behaviors during the 6 months before and after the laboratory
visit; (c) self-prediction of future NSSI on a 0 (definitely not) to 4 (definitely so) scale
assessed during the laboratory visit; (d) the number of severe NSSI methods before and after
the laboratory visit; and (e) therapy status (i.e., any type of psychosocial or pharmacological
treatment) during the 6 months after the laboratory visit.

The category “other severe NSSI behaviors” included burning, scraping, and any other NSSI
behaviors that caused substantial tissue damage (e.g., severe self-hitting). This
categorization is consistent with prior studies showing that, compared with minor NSSI
behaviors (e.g., lip-biting, skin picking), these severe NSSI behaviors are associated with
greater likelihood of psychopathology, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and hospitalizations
(e.g., Lloyd-Richardson et al., 2007). For the 6-month follow-up, an online survey version of
the NSSI module of the SITBI was created. The common variable between the baseline and
follow-up SITBIs, lifetime NSSI frequency, showed high test–retest reliability (r = .85).

Emotion Reactivity Scale (ERS)—The ERS (Nock, Wedig, Holmberg, & Hooley,
2008) measures emotion reactivity, which has been defined as a component of emotion
regulation that specifically involves emotional sensitivity, intensity, and persistence (see
Nock et al., 2008). The ERS is a 21-item self-report questionnaire that displays strong
internal consistency (α = .92 in the present study), convergent and discriminant construct
validity, and criterion-related validity (Nock et al., 2008). The ERS has been shown to
mediate the association between psychopathology and self-injury (Nock et al., 2008).
Accordingly, in the present study the ERS served to specify that any predictive effects of

diminished aversion to self-cutting stimuli were not because of more general emotional and
psychopathological correlates of NSSI.

Picture stimuli—The self-cutting pictures included in the affective measures were
developed specifically for the present study with a combination of digital art and theatrical
makeup techniques. These were 12 images that depicted various features of a self-cutting
episode (see Figure 1 for an example of four of these images). Post hoc analyses revealed
that all self-cutting picture subtypes (e.g., blood vs. no blood) were similarly related to
future self-injury. We also included 12 general unpleasant images from the International
Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005). These included images
of spiders, snakes, and impending attack (e.g., gun pointed at camera).

Explicit affective ratings—Explicit affect toward the images noted above was assessed
with a computerized self-report survey. On each trial, a picture was presented and
participants were asked to rate it on a scale of 0 (extremely unpleasant) to 5 (neutral) to 9
(extremely pleasant). This measure was self-paced: after participants made their ratings on a
given trial, they clicked on a button to move on to the next trial. Explicit ratings displayed
excellent internal consistency (α = .95 for self-cutting images; α = .89 for unpleasant
images).

AMP—The AMP (Payne et al., 2005) is a brief computer-based task that measures implicit
affect. On each trial of the AMP, the computer flashes an emotionally valenced picture for
75 ms, a blank screen for 125 ms, a Chinese symbol for 100 ms, and finally a gray screen
that remains until the participant presses a key. Participants were excluded if they indicated
that they could read these symbols. In this forced-choice task, participants were instructed to
press one key (i.e., ‘p’) if they judged the Chinese symbol to be more pleasant than the
average symbol and another key (i.e., ‘q’) if they judged it to be less pleasant that the
average symbol (see Payne et al., 2005). Participants were instructed to use their “gut
feelings” to make their judgments and to ignore the initial emotionally valenced images.
Despite this latter instruction, evaluations tend to be strongly influenced by the valence of
the picture, with more pleasant pictures generating more pleasant evaluations of subsequent
Chinese symbols (Payne et al., 2005). The dependent variable for the AMP was the
proportion of trials on which a positive evaluation occurs to the total number of trials within
a given picture category. We created a version of the AMP specifically for the present study
that included the images noted above. AMP responses displayed high internal consistency
within categories (α = .91 for self-cutting; α = .88 for unpleasant).

The identity version of the self-cutting IAT—The IAT (Nock & Banaji, 2007) is a
brief computer-based task that measures implicit associations. The identity version of the
self-cutting IAT assesses the strength of the association that participants hold between
themselves and self-cutting (Nock & Banaji, 2007). The format and stimuli for this task
were identical to those of Nock and Banaji (2007). Specifically, there were five blocks.
During the three practice blocks, two words were displayed at the top of the screen (either
me and not me; or cutting and no cutting). During the two experimental blocks, four words
were displayed at the top of the screen: (a) one of these blocks paired me/cutting and not

me/no cutting at the top of the screen; (b) the other block paired not me/cutting and me/no
cutting at the top of the screen. On each trial, a stimulus appeared in the center of the screen
and participants were instructed to correctly sort this stimulus into one of the categories at
the top of the screen by pressing either ‘e’ (if the correct category was in the left-hand part
of the screen) or ‘i’ (if the correct category was in the right-hand part of the screen). For any
block that included me/not me, these stimuli included self- and other-related words; for any
block that included cutting/no cutting, these stimuli included cutting-related images and
images of noninjured skin. Reaction time was recorded for each trial on which a correct
classification was made. If an incorrect classification was made, the trial was repeated.
Consistent with recommendations (see Nock & Banaji, 2007), the strength of association
between cutting and oneself was quantified by taking a standardized difference score (i.e.,
response latencies for the me/cutting block subtracted from the not me/cutting block, divided
by the SD for all five blocks) for each participant. Positive difference scores reflected
stronger associations. This measure showed high internal consistency in the present study (α
= .93).

Procedure

Participants arrived at the laboratory and completed an informed consent form. Participants
then completed the SITBI and ERS, followed by the self-cutting versions of the AMP, IAT,
and explicit affective ratings survey. At the conclusion of the study, participants were
compensated and informed about the optional follow-up survey. Six months after their lab
visit, participants received a link to the follow-up survey about NSSI behaviors. Upon
completion of this survey, participants were compensated again.

Data Analytic Plan

First, we calculated descriptive statistics for all measures. Second, we examined zero-order
Pearson product–moment correlations among all variables (we note that rank-order
correlations produced very similar results). Third, we employed Poisson regression models
to investigate the ability of theoretically relevant variables to uniquely predict future self-
cutting and future noncutting severe NSSI behaviors.

Results

Zero-Order Correlations

Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations among variables are presented in Table 1.
Of note, diminished implicit and explicit aversion toward self-cutting stimuli were both
associated with future self-cutting and future noncutting severe NSSI behaviors. Self-
prediction of future NSSI, number of NSSI methods, therapy status, and prior NSSI also
were prospectively associated with NSSI behaviors. It is interesting that affect toward
general unpleasant images, implicit identification with self-cutting, and emotion
dysregulation were not significantly associated with future NSSI (Table 1).

Prepost Self-Injury Patterns

Results indicated that there were significant overall reductions in both self-cutting, F(48) =
16.60, p < .001 and noncutting severe NSSI behaviors, F(48) = 10.64, p = .002 between the
6 months before the laboratory visit and the 6 months after the laboratory visit.

Unique Predictors of Future NSSI

The Poisson regression model for the prediction of self-cutting indicated that several
variables were unique predictors (Table 2). Specifically, prior self-cutting, the number of
NSSI methods, and implicit/explicit affect toward self-cutting images each significantly
uniquely predicted the frequency of future self-cutting. Implicit identification with self-
cutting, self-prediction of future NSSI, emotion reactivity, and therapy status were not
significant unique predictors of self-cutting. Similarly, a separate Poisson regression model
revealed an identical prediction pattern for noncutting severe NSSI behaviors, with the
exception that therapy status was an additional significant predictor in this model (Table 2).

Discussion

There is an urgent need to improve the identification of individuals at-risk for NSSI and to
advance knowledge about the mechanisms that drive NSSI. Consistent with previous studies
(e.g., Glenn & Klonsky, 2011), results revealed that prior NSSI frequency and number of
NSSI methods were strong predictors of future NSSI. Adding to mixed evidence from
previous studies (e.g., Tuisku et al., in press; Wilcox et al., 2012), our index of emotion
dysregulation (ERS scores) was not prospectively associated with NSSI. Similarly,
replicating the findings of Glenn and Klonsky (2011), results indicated that implicit
identification with self-cutting did not predict NSSI. Taken together, these findings suggest:
(a) prior NSSI is a robust predictor of NSSI; and (b) factors such as emotion dysregulation
and implicit identification with self-cutting cross-sectionally differentiate NSSI and non-
NSSI groups, but may not play active roles in maintaining NSSI behaviors.

In accordance with the primary hypothesis of the present study, results revealed that low
aversion to self-cutting stimuli was a strong and independent predictor of NSSI.
Specifically, it predicted uniquely from other theoretically important factors including prior
self-injury, number of NSSI methods, self-prediction of future NSSI, implicit identification
with self-cutting, emotion reactivity, and therapy status. It is interesting that implicit and
explicit diminished aversion predicted independently from one another (Table 2). The
present results are consistent with the idea that the instinctive aversion to self-cutting stimuli
is an important barrier to NSSI, and greater reductions in this barrier are associated more
frequent future NSSI. We hypothesize that pain offset relief conditioning may be one of the
primary mechanisms that erodes this aversion barrier. Specifically, because pain offset relief
occurs during NSSI (see Franklin, Puzia, et al., 2013), it is possible that stimuli present
during this time (e.g., knives, blood, wounds) become paired with relief, gradually
diminishing the aversion to these stimuli (cf. Andreatta, Mühlberger, Yarali, Gerber, &
Pauli, 2010). This would suggest that the opposing conditioning process—aversive
conditioning—may reestablish the instinctive aversion to NSSI stimuli. Rebuilding this
barrier may reduce the likelihood of future NSSI. Given that currently there are no

empirically supported treatments for NSSI despite attempts with nearly all traditional
interventions (Nock, 2010), future studies may benefit from testing these conditioning and
counterconditioning hypotheses with experimental and longitudinal studies.

Echoing the findings of most longitudinal self-injury studies (Glenn & Klonsky, 2011;
Hazell et al., 2009; Linehan et al., 2006; You et al., 2013), results indicated that overall self-
injury frequency significantly decreased between the 6 months’ prelaboratory visit and the 6
months’ postlaboratory visit. The most likely explanation for this pattern is that self-injury
studies (including the present study) usually attempt to recruit individuals with recent and
frequent self-injury (e.g., multiple NSSI episodes within the past 6 months). Many of these
episodes may be driven in part by acute stressors that resolve within a few months, leading
to fewer NSSI episodes during follow-up intervals. Future studies are needed to directly
investigate why this overall decreased self-injury pattern occurs.

The present results should be interpreted in accord with the limitations of the present study.
First, future studies may benefit from employing larger sample sizes, other populations, and
additional predictors (e.g., sexual orientation, Wilcox et al., 2012; self-criticism, Hooley &
St. Germain, in press). Second, the present measures only gauged aversion to self-cutting
stimuli; future studies may benefit from including a wider range of stimuli (e.g., burning,
death/suicide related). The fact that low aversion to self-cutting stimuli strongly predicted
noncutting behaviors (see Tables 1 and 2) suggests the possibility that low aversion to a
given form of self-injury (e.g., cutting) may be concatenated with low aversion to several
other forms of self-injury, including suicidal self-injury. This may help to explain the link
between NSSI and suicidal self-injury (cf. Joiner et al., 2012); future studies should
investigate this possibility. Third, to investigate the discriminant predictive validity of low
aversion to self-cutting stimuli, future studies should examine whether this factor predicts
other dysregulated behaviors (e.g., substance use, purging) or only NSSI. Fourth, the
measures in the present study were not counterbalanced, leaving open the possibility that
later measures (i.e., IAT, explicit ratings) may have been influenced by earlier measures
(i.e., AMP). Fifth, the present study examined NSSI within a 6-month window. This window
is comparable to that of most other longitudinal NSSI studies, but future investigations may
benefit from including a longer window and measuring NSSI at multiple time points (cf.
Guerry & Prinstein, 2010).

The present study established that low aversion to self-cutting stimuli is a strong and robust
longitudinal predictor of NSSI. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms that reduce
this and other barriers to NSSI, and aim to design novel interventions that rebuild these
barriers (cf. Franklin et al., in press; Hooley & St. Germain, in press).
