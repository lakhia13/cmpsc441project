To  celebrate  its  20th  anniversary,  Evidence  Based  Mental  Health 
has  devoted  a  Special  Issue  to  child  and  adolescent  mental  health, 
acknowledging  its  crucial  role  in  mental  health.  The  issue,  aimed  at 
providing a comprehensive overview of the advances and unmet needs 
in evidence-based child and adolescent mental health, includes three 
types of articles.

First, in a series of state-of-the-art reviews, renowned experts in the 
field provide a critical overview of the major advances in key areas of child 
and  adolescent  psychiatry  over  the  past  20  years  and  highlight  future 
research priorities. In a succinct but very thoughtful review, Doherty et al1 
guide  us  through  the  journey  of  the  genetics  of  neurodevelopmental 
disorders (NDs), with a special focus on its implications for the clinical 
practice. While initial linkage analysis and candidate gene approaches to 
generate reproducible results were discouraging, genomewide analyses 
have recently revealed significant findings for autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, it 
appears that rare chromosomal deletions and duplications (copy number 
variants, in <1% population) can also contribute to the genetics of NDs. 
This  has  fuelled  the  debate  around  the  most  appropriate  thresholds  to 
refer patients with NDs and their families to clinical genetics services.

In a comprehensive overview of the advances and challenges of child 
and adolescent psychopharmacology, Vitiello and Davico2 highlight how 
the past two decades of research in this area have been progressively 
shaped  by  the  evidence-based  approaches.  Nevertheless,  there  is  still 
a long way to move from symptom improvement to disease-modifying 
interventions,  especially  with  relevance  to  treatment  effects  in  usual 
practice  conditions.  The  review  by  Vitiello  and  Davico2  is  also  nicely 
completed by the paper authored by Baker and Carlson,3 who, after an 
extensive literature search, were able to identify only 10 studies using 
Pro Re Nata (PRNs) to manage agitated outbursts in children and adoles-
cents in acute care settings and most were chart reviews. In fact, the 
only placebo-controlled trial of PRN medications was done by Vitiello and 
colleagues in 19904 which showed that placebo worked as well as active 
drug! If there was ever an ‘Emperors New Clothes’ award to be given to 
a practice, this is it. Given how common the use of PRNs is in the daily 
clinical practice of a child and adolescent psychiatry in acute settings, it 
is shocking how flimsy the evidence base is to support it.

Moving on to specific disorders, Cortese and Coghill5 review the main 
advances in terms of clinical description, neuroscience, neuropsychology, 
genetics and treatment of ADHD. Certainly, there have been important 
developments in this area, such as the introduction of the DSM-5 criteria 
(including  the  removal  of  the  veto  of  diagnosing  ADHD  in  individuals 
with  ASD  and  age-specific  symptom  thresholds),  the  shift  from  alter-
ations in individual brain regions to complex brain network dysfunctions 

in the conceptualisation of the pathophysiology of the disorder and the 
meta-analytic  evidence  pointing  to  different,  but  likely  complementary, 
roles  for  pharmacological  (effectively  targeting  core  symptoms)  and 
behavioural  approaches  (improving  non-core  symptoms  such  as  oppo-
sitional  behaviours).  However,  many  other  challenges  remain,  such  as 
the recent controversy around the possible and puzzling adult onset of 
ADHD symptoms, and the need to move beyond symptoms to include 
functional impairment as a treatment target. In this respect, the review 
by  Cortese  and  Coghill  is  thoughtfully  complemented  by  the  Weiss  et 
al paper,6 providing a very detailed account of the psychometric proper-
ties of the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale and of the available 
studies using this scale. Weiss and colleagues also discuss a paradigm 
for  defining  functional  improvement  and  remission,  and  conclude,  in  a 
very sensible way, that defined criteria for improvement and remission in 
functioning need to complement symptom improvement and remission of 
psychiatric conditions.

Findling and colleagues7 address the controversy over bipolar disorder 
in children and adolescents, providing an updated overview of the diag-
nosis, phenomenology and treatment of this disorder. While the definition 
and characterisation of BD have been highly controversial over the past 
two decades and there continue to be divergent views on how to best 
define  bipolar  disorder  especially  in  children  (vs  adolescents),  Findling  
et al7 point out that there is substantial evidence for the validity of using 
DSM  criteria  to  diagnose  mania,  at  least  in  children  and  adolescents. 
However, consensus regarding diagnosis of cyclothymia and BP-NOS is 
far  from  being  definitive  and  arguably  BD  will  continue  to  spur  intense 
debate  in  the  field.  A  remake  of  the  1970s  WHO  study8  of  manic-de-
pression  and  schizophrenia  may  be  necessary  where  clinicians  with 
disparate views evaluate the same children to understand the source of 
disagreement.

Another  highly  controversial  topic,  the  concept  of  ‘ultra-high  risk’ 
(UHR) or ‘clinical high risk’ for ‘transition’ to psychosis is the subject of 
two articles in the section ‘Debate’ by two leading research groups. On 
one hand, Guloksuz and van Os9 argue against the utility of this construct, 
pointing out that among other things the prognostic accuracy is mediocre 
and the outcome of merely prolonging the time to onset of psychosis is 
an inadequate goal. On the other hand, McGorry and Mei10 suggest that 
using an UHR approach has been a landmark paradigm. Furthermore, in 
their review article,11 they provide a very useful historical account of the 
development  of  so-called  ‘transition  psychiatry’,  the  setting  up  of  clin-
ical services for youth mental care using the paradigm of early psychosis 
services which address provision of treatment and services that tackle 
‘real world’ issues.

While  acknowledging  major  critiques,  the  authors  propose  a  revi-
sion, moving towards a broader, transdiagnostic at-risk model (Clinical 
High  Risk  Mental  State).  Ultimately,  as  usually  happens  in  debates 
conducted in a sensible way, it appears that this is not a black or white 
issue  and  there  seem  to  be  relevant  points  of  convergence  between 
the two sides.

Finally, this Special Issue includes three original articles that provide 
novel  evidence-based  insights  to  highly  relevant  issues  in  child  and 
adolescent mental health. Although not part of the defining criteria, sleep 
disturbances are relevant in many patients with ASD. Diaz-Roman et al12 
conducted  the  first  meta-analysis  including  both  subjective  and  objec-
tive sleep parameters and found significant differences between children 
with  ASD  and  typically  developing  controls  in  a  number  of  subjective 
and objective measures. There are, of course, limitations in the studies 
reviewed, not least of which are the use of medications and comorbid-
ities  like  ADHD.  However,  this  reflects  daily  practice  and  the  authors 
advise that specific enquiries about sleep be routinely undertaken in chil-
dren with ASD .

In  a  prospective  observational  cohort  study  of  children  with  septic 
illness, meningoencephalitis or other critical disorders admitted to paedi-
atric intensive care units, Caspani et al13 found that, at admission, low 
lymphocyte  count  was  associated  with  increased  global  psychiatric 
risk at follow-up and high C-reactive protein was associated with PTSD 
symptoms at follow-up. While the role of inflammation in mental health 
conditions  is  certainly  not  a  novel  notion,  the  study  by  Caspani  et  al13 
sheds light for the first time on a possible contributing role of inflamma-
tory processes in a previously overlooked clinical population.

Lastly, the study by Wilkinson et al 14 provides, for the first time, initial 
evidence-based support to the implementation of interpersonal counsel-
ling for youth with depressive symptoms seen in local authority non-spe-
cialist mental health services. This could arguably address a need that 
currently mental health services are not in a position to cover, at least in 
the UK, due to financial constraints.

As  nicely  shown  in  this  Special  Issue,  achievements  over  the  past 
20 years in the field have not come without additional challenges. We 
look  forward  to  the  next  20  years  of  growth  of  evidence-based  child 
and  adolescent  mental  health,  and  we  are  confident  that  the  Journal 
will continue supporting the dissemination of the best evidence base for 
patients, families, practitioners and researchers.
