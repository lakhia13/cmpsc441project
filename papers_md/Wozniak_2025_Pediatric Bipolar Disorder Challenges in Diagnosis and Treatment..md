Abstract
Despite an opportunity to prevent adult psychopathology associated with bipolar disorder through early diagnosis in chil-
dren, there is insufficient information and awareness among healthcare providers about the unique features and treatment 
of mania and its comorbid conditions in children. Converging evidence from disparate sites describe a developmentally 
distinct presentation of bipolar disorder in youth that is highly morbid, persistent and responds to treatment with the mood 
stabilizer medications used in the treatment of adult bipolar disorder, such as divalproex sodium and carbamazepine. Some 
are additionally approved for use in pediatric populations including, for manic or mixed states, risperidone, aripiprazole, 
and asenapine for those aged 10–17 years and also including lithium and olanzapine for ages 13–17 years. Quetiapine is 
approved as monotherapy or as adjunct to lithium or divalproex sodium for manic states in those aged 10–17 years. Delayed 
or missed diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, worsening course, and treatment resistance unfortunately still occur. While 
an array of mood-stabilizing medications is available for treatment, such as second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, and 
anticonvulsants, these can be only partially effective and fraught with annoying and serious side effects. This article will 
review current practice in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder and its comorbid conditions, highlight-
ing areas of need for future research.

Key Points 

Pediatric bipolar disorder occurs in a sizable number of 
children who are severely affected by explosive irritabil-
ity and mixed states, requiring aggressive intervention.

Treatment options are challenging due to difficulty of 
overlapping diagnoses and adverse effects of medica-
tions.

Combined psychopharmacology is the best course of 
action to address comorbidity, and new medications 
available for the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder 
hold promise for improved outcomes.

1  Introduction

Children  with  bipolar  disorder  often  have  delayed  or 
missed diagnosis and inappropriate treatment, which can 
lead to worsening course and treatment resistance later in 
life. Studies find that adults with bipolar disorder often go 
many years before getting appropriate psychiatric treat-
ment [1], and length to first treatment is associated with 
treatment resistance [2]. Debate over diagnostic criteria, 
a serious shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists, 
concern regarding side effects of mood stabilizing medi-
cation, and stigma associated with psychiatric diagno-
sis in children all interfere with the accurate diagnosis 
of bipolar disorder in youth. Potentially contributing to 
inappropriate  treatment  with  antidepressant  medica-
tion, the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) [3] included the 
new diagnosis ‘disruptive mood dysregulation disorder’ 
(DMDD) listed under depressive disorders and charac-
terized  by  chronic  irritability.  While  DMDD  offers  an 
alternative diagnosis for moody children with irritability, 
unfortunately this diagnosis may confuse clinical manage-
ment [4]. A diagnosis of DMDD still requires a clinical 
assessment of the source of the irritability, whether it be 
a form of depression requiring antidepressant treatment, 
a symptom of bipolar spectrum disorder requiring mood

stabilizers and/or irritability from another source [4]. The 
paradigm shift that led to the increase in bipolar diagnoses 
in children began with research findings from structured 
interviews with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disor-
ders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS), which identified that 
a significant proportion (16%, N = 43) of children in an 
academic medical center outpatient service met criteria for 
mania [5, 6]. Major depressive disorder (MDD) has long 
been considered a valid diagnosis in pediatrics, affect-
ing over 10% of children and adolescents in the United 
States [7–9]. In 1980, the DSM-III indicated that the cri-
teria for pediatric-onset bipolar disorder were the same as 
those used for adults [10]. However, by the mid-1990s, 
only a limited evidence base addressed the diagnosis and 
treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder [11]. Recent epi-
demiologic studies suggest a weighted range prevalence 
of pediatric bipolar spectrum disorders of 2–4% in the 
United States and other Western countries [12, 13]. The 
overall rates seem to be steady over time [12] and indicate 
that, while depression affects a larger number of children, 
bipolar disorder impacts a sizable minority [8] and these 
children require intensive intervention, posing a significant 
public health concern [14]. In addition, evidence supports 
a cohort effect accounting for earlier age of onset of and 
greater morbidity in bipolar disorder in the United States 
[15]. The converging evidence of familiality, response to 
treatment and longitudinal course from disparate research 
sites provides compelling evidence of the validity of bipo-
lar  disorder  onsetting  in  the  pediatric  years.  However, 
there are some authors who argue that bipolar disorder 
does not onset in the pediatric years, or that the rates are 
exceedingly low. These authors argue that severe mood 
dysregulation in the children and adolescents is not ‘true’ 
bipolar disorder [16–20]. (See Table 1 for details of key 
cited studies.)

2   Diagnostic Confusion

State of the art psychiatry relies on clinical acumen, and 
an unmet need is the lack of valid and reliable biomarkers 
to accurately diagnose psychiatric disorders throughout the 
lifecycle [21]. Adults with bipolar disorder often go many 
years without receiving an accurate diagnosis and appropri-
ate treatment [22]. Misdiagnosis with unipolar depression 
is common and can lead to treatment with antidepressants, 
which may lead to manic activation and worsening clinical 
course in individuals with bipolar disorder [23, 24].

The  differential  diagnosis  of  unipolar  versus  bipolar 
disorder with the deployment of the optimal treatment is 
a critical challenge throughout the life cycle, especially 
challenging in youth due to the developmentally different 
presentation of manic symptoms in youth, the high rates of 

mixed states and complex cycling, the frequent presence of 
depression in children with bipolar disorder, and the frequent 
occurrence of confounding comorbidity [25]. While overdi-
agnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder has been a concern in 
some settings, with consequent inappropriate prescription 
of mood stabilizers and stigma associated with a serious 
psychiatric diagnosis [26, 27], not properly diagnosing and 
treating children with bipolar disorder is evidence of stigma 
toward psychiatry that is not seen in any other branch of 
medicine [28]. Both early onset bipolar illness and delay 
to first treatment are independent risk factors for a poor 
outcome in adulthood [29]. Rather than concern regarding 
overdiagnosis [30, 31], Post et al. [30] note that a “skeptical 
view of the data has resulted in neglect of the magnitude of 
the problem in terms of clinical therapeutics, public health 
practices, and a treatment research agenda.”

The criteria for bipolar disorder in pediatric-aged patients 
is the same as in adults; however, the developmental presen-
tation of bipolar disorder in youth proves to be an obstacle to 
accurate diagnosis. While cyclicity is a well-known feature 
of bipolar disorder, complex and rapid-cycling patterns with 
frequent mixed states have been reported in childhood-onset 
bipolar disorder [32, 33]. In DSM-V, a manic or hypomanic 
episode is considered ‘mixed’ with three of six additional 
depressive symptoms (appears or feels sad, joyless, psycho-
motor retardation, fatigue, worthlessness, suicidality) and a 
major depressive episode is considered ‘mixed’ with three 
of seven additional manic symptoms (euphoria, grandiosity, 
pressured speech, racing thoughts/flight of ideas, increased 
energy, reckless activities, decreased need for sleep) [3].

The distinct episodes considered pathognomonic for bipo-
lar disorder may be difficult to discern in youth who are often 
persistently unwell due to cycling and multiple comorbid 
conditions [5, 6]. While melancholic and euphoric moods 
are symptoms of depression and mania, respectively, irrita-
bility is a common symptom of both depression and mania 
in children. MDD in children is characterized by annoyed 
and easily irritated moods [34] and a qualitatively distinct 
form of severe irritability is most often the presenting chief 
mood complaint in pediatric mania with rage, aggression, 
and destruction [34–36].

Symptomatic  overlap  of  mania  with  attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common disorder of child-
hood, additionally confounds accurate diagnosis of pediatric 
bipolar disorder. Abnormally high energy, distractibility, and 
pressured/talkative speech are symptoms of both disorders. 
In making the diagnosis of bipolar disorder versus ADHD, 
it can be helpful to look for non-overlapping symptoms such 
as periods of euphoria, decreased need for sleep, hyper-
sexuality, suicidality, homicidal ideation, hallucinations, 
and delusions. There is an asymmetrical overlap of ADHD 
and bipolar disorder as ADHD commonly occurs without 
comorbid bipolar disorder, while pre-pubertal onset bipolar

disorder usually co-occurs with ADHD [37]. The comorbid 
condition of bipolar disorder and ADHD is associated with 
worse functioning than ADHD without mania and is familial 
[5, 6, 37, 38]. Family studies of bipolar disorder find a larger 
genetic contribution in earlier-onset versus late-onset cases, 
with a familiality rate of 3% for adult bipolar probands, 9% 
for adolescent bipolar probands, and 30% for child bipolar 
probands [39–41]. A genome-wide association study reports 
a single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlation 
between ADHD and bipolar disorder, suggesting that early-
onset bipolar disorder comorbid with ADHD may be caused 
by a genetic mechanism that is different from later-onset 
adult bipolar disorder [42]. These findings suggest that the 
pediatric-onset form of bipolar disorder, with high rates of 
comorbidity with ADHD, may be a distinct genetic subtype.
In recent years, an increasing number of high function-
ing individuals have been diagnosed with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD), a significant developmental condition [43]. 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) 
has approved two medications (risperidone and aripiprazole) 
for the symptom of irritability in ASD, suggesting that irri-
tability is part of the ASD clinical picture rather than attrib-
utable to a comorbid condition. However, among a sample 
of youth referred for treatment of ASD, 31% had comor-
bid bipolar disorder [44]. Bipolar youth with and without 
ASD have similar rates of bipolar familiality [45] and in 
clinical trials have similar scores on the Young Mania Rat-
ing Scale (YMRS) and the Children’s Depression Rating 
Scale (CDRS) [46]. There is no difference in the anti-manic 
response of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for 
bipolar youth with and without ASD [46], suggesting that 
youth with ASD and comorbid bipolar disorder would ben-
efit from accurate diagnosis for treatment of mania.

Subthreshold bipolar syndromes that do not meet the full 
diagnostic criteria are important to recognize, and meeting 
full syndrome criteria is not a requirement for treatment. The 
Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study found 
that during follow-up, 25% of bipolar disorder-II (BP-II) and 
38% of bipolar disorder—not otherwise specified (BP-NOS) 
probands converted to bipolar disorder-I (BP-I) [47]. Fur-
ther supporting their treatment, BP-II and BP-NOS are both 
highly morbid with as much impairment and familiality as 
full syndrome mania [48, 49].

3   Pharmacologic Treatment of Pediatric 

Mania

There are many treatment studies emerging to address the 
symptoms of pediatric bipolar disorder and, in 2017, the 
International  Society  for  Bipolar  Disorders  Task  Force 
reported on knowledge to date including the pharmacologic 
trials which inform the treatment of manic/mixed episodes 

131

in children [27]. This group highlights the concern that 
there are less data addressing bipolar depression and main-
tenance/continuation treatment in children. The algorithm 
for treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder recommends the 
use of mood stabilizers alone or in concert to reduce mania 
but, given the dearth of head-to-head trials, does not pro-
vide guidance for which mood stabilizers to use or in what 
sequence. There are numerous US FDA-approved treatments 
for youth with bipolar disorder down to age 13 and, in some 
cases, to age 10, most of which are SGAs. Additionally, 
a small evidence base supports the use of anticonvulsant 
medications as mood stabilizers. Lithium has long been FDA 
approved for pediatric bipolar disorder down to 7 years of 
age, but the first double-blind randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) study for pediatric BP-I occurred in 2015 [50]. In 
this trial, pediatric participants with manic or mixed epi-
sodes were assigned either to a lithium treatment or a control 
group for 8 weeks. Change in YMRS scores was signifi-
cantly higher in the lithium group, as well as CGI scores 
showing greater improvement, demonstrating lithium to be 
effective in reducing manic symptoms. SGA medications 
are FDA-approved effective mood-stabilizing treatments for 
adult bipolar disorder [51] and are generally employed as 
the first-line mood-stabilizing treatments for pediatric bipo-
lar disorder given their FDA approval and superior efficacy 
in reducing manic symptoms with less discontinuation of 
treatment and less need for augmentation [52–54]. The last 
options for treatment-resistant youth with bipolar disorder 
are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and clozapine, but these 
are rarely used in youth due to potential side effects [55]. 
Clinicians must be aware that poor adherence to psychiatric 
medication is common due to annoying and serious side 
effects of medications as well as diminishing insight during 
bipolar relapse. Clinicians and patients must keep aware that 
inadequate treatment with relapses of mania and/or depres-
sion contribute to treatment-resistant states [30].

4   Pharmacologic Management 

of Comorbidities

There is a high rate of occurrence of comorbid conditions 
in bipolar youth including ADHD, anxiety disorders, ASD, 
oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disor-
der (CD) [56, 57]. The approach to diagnosing comorbid 
conditions in children is the same as in adults: a structured 
approach adhering to DSM-V criteria is required for accu-
rate diagnoses [3]. As each of these disorders is severely 
impairing in their own right, a combined pharmacotherapy 
approach is generally required to address an array of symp-
toms in youth with bipolar disorder [56–59].

ADHD  is  commonly  comorbid  with  bipolar  disorder 
and age at onset of bipolar disorder modifies the risk for

comorbidity  of  ADHD.  Pre-pubertal  bipolar  probands 
have rates of comorbidity with ADHD near 80–90% ver-
sus 50–60% in adolescent-onset bipolar probands [60]. A 
report of adults with bipolar disorder found ADHD only 
in the individuals with an onset of bipolar disorder prior to 
19 years of age [61]. A small number of studies report that 
ADHD comorbid with bipolar disorder can be safely treated 
with stimulants, but only in the setting of mood stability [62, 
63]. A recent literature review reported that stimulant treat-
ments can exacerbate bipolar disorder [64], suggesting that 
clinicians should proceed with caution.

The majority of youth with bipolar disorder also meet 
diagnostic criteria for ODD and approximately 40% for CD 
[65]. As these conditions do not have pharmacologic treat-
ments, comorbidity with bipolar disorder offers an oppor-
tunity for intervention with medication. A flagrant disre-
gard for adult authority can be a presentation of grandiosity 
in bipolar youth, thus, severe defiance may improve with 
anti-manic treatment. Bipolar youth with and without CD 
respond equally well to SGAs for the treatment of bipolar 
disorder, offering some hope for diminishing the impulsiv-
ity, poor judgment, irritability, and grandiosity that can fuel 
symptoms of CD [66].

Almost half of youth with bipolar disorder also have a 
comorbid anxiety disorder [67–69]. Although antidepres-
sants are commonly used for anxiety and MDD in youth, 
these treatments can cause or precipitate mania [70]. Mania 
or hypomania developed in 31% of children with MDD in 
a follow-up study [71], and bipolar I disorder was found 
in 33% of 72 subjects with prepubertal major depressive 
disorder followed-up into adulthood [72]. Earlier onset of 
mood symptoms and treatment with antidepressants poses 
an even higher risk of switching [73, 74]. Alternative anxiety 
treatments should be enlisted before prescribing antidepres-
sants for anxiety in bipolar youth [75]. In adults with bipolar 
disorder, mood stabilizing anticonvulsants and SGAs with 
anxiolytic effects have been recommended for the treatment 
of comorbid anxiety [76].

The armamentarium for the treatment of bipolar depres-
sion is relatively small and not without potential adverse 
events [57,  77,  78]. The differential diagnosis of unipo-
lar versus bipolar depression remains  a vexing  problem 
throughout the lifecyle, and the diagnostic distinction is vital 
as treatment with anti-depressant medications can worsen 
outcomes for individuals with bipolar disorder [75]. Lur-
asidone can lead to a significant reduction in symptoms of 
depression in children with bipolar depression with minimal 
effects on weight [79], but may cause switch to mania [80, 
81]. Evidence supports the use of lamotrigine and lithium 
for adolescent bipolar depression [82]. Hafeman et al. [82] 
reported on 340 bipolar youth over follow-up of 10 years 
and found that those taking lithium had half as many suicide 
attempts and fewer depressive symptoms. However, both are 

fraught with serious and annoying side effects. Lamotrigine 
carries an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome in 
those under 16 years of age [83]. Although some studies sug-
gest that anticonvulsants may have more nephrotoxicity than 
lithium [84, 85], lithium requires regular blood monitoring 
for possible adverse impact on kidneys and thyroid, has a 
narrow therapeutic index and can cause acne, tremors, and 
gastrointestinal (GI) distress [86].

5   Challenges in Treatment

There are very few head-to-head trials of mood stabilizers 
to guide clinicians in the choice of medications for bipolar 
youth [87]. Multiple prospective controlled studies (mono-
therapy and combination therapy) in this population provide 
a useful evidence base [50, 53, 79, 87–108] (see Table 2). 
There is a paucity of studies of pre-adolescent youth and 
very few studies of preschool-aged youth, although retro-
spective reports indicate that prepubertal bipolar disorder 
often starts in the preschool years of life [109–111]. Patients 
must endure the trial and error process as we await reli-
able biomarker predictors of response. While current FDA-
approved medications for bipolar disorder boast high effi-
cacy rates, many children suffer from partial effectiveness or 
treatment resistance. Comorbid conditions remain difficult 
to manage with few studies available to guide treatment. The 
need for combined pharmacotherapy increases the risk for 
adverse events, which may result in the need for additional 
medications to manage medication side effects.

SGAs, the first-line treatments for pediatric bipolar dis-
order, have significant metabolic adverse effects [112]. In 
order to manage weight gain and its associated morbidity, 
clinicians must screen for family history of obesity, diabetes, 
and cardiovascular disease prior to the initiation of treat-
ment. Body mass index (BMI) is measured at baseline, 4, 8, 
and 12 weeks, and every 3 months after that. Labs including 
fasting glucose, lipids, and blood pressure are done at base-
line, after 3 months, and then annually if normal. Limited 
evidence suggests that co-treatment with appetite suppres-
sants including naltrexone and topiramate may offset weight 
gain without exacerbating mania, but studies are few and 
generally do not address pediatric populations [113, 114].

Clinicians prescribing SGAs can choose to co-treat with 
metformin, a medication that decreases hepatic production 
and GI absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glu-
cose utilization. Metformin has been shown to lead to weight 
loss and improve insulin activity compared with placebo 
in individuals with schizophrenia [115], although results in 
overweight youth on SGAs is not as impressive [88]. Further 
limiting its use, metformin commonly has GI-related side 
effects including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [116] and 
can lead to B12 deficiency [117]. There is an accruing level

of evidence suggesting that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists (GLP1) may be helpful to mitigate SGA-associated 
metabolic dysfunctions, including favorable improvements 
in waist circumferences, BMI, glucose, and lipid metabolic 
markers [118, 119]. Unfortunately, these potentially highly 
effective medications have not been commonly extended to 
use in youth [120].

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a potentially permanent move-
ment disorder that is a side effect of SGAs and of great con-
cern when treating youth. Studies suggesting that rates of 
TD are very low are encouraging but are limited by short 
follow-up periods [121]. Clinicians must monitor for, and 
instruct parents to monitor for, the development of abnormal 
involuntary movements when prescribing SGAs. Clozapine 
has the lowest risk for TD, but is seldom used in very young 
children due to lack of study and frequent need for blood 
tests for safety monitoring. While there are pharmacologic 
interventions for TD, there are no studies of these treatments 
in pediatric populations.

New medications are gaining traction in the treatment 
of bipolar disorder but studies in youth lag behind FDA 
approval in adults. Cariprazine is a dopamine receptor ligand 
that was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of 
schizophrenia and bipolar I in adults [122]. Cariprazine is 
shown to be effective and well tolerated in children with 
bipolar disorder, although causes weight gain with higher 
doses [123, 124]. Another medication of interest is lumatep-
erone, which is an antipsychotic approved by the FDA in 
2019 for treatment of schizophrenia and in 2021 for treat-
ment of adult BP-I and BP-II [125]. Clinical trials explor-
ing use of these new treatments in pediatric populations are 
ongoing.

Although pharmacologic interventions are considered 
the first-line options for severely impairing conditions, adju-
vant psychosocial and psychotherapeutic treatments can be 
effective in augmenting treatment adherence and second-
ary outcomes, especially in patients with greater functional 
impairment and comorbid anxiety disorders [126]. When 
clinically indicated, integrating family psychoeducation and 
skill building for youth with bipolar disorder can be helpful 
in reducing behavioral symptoms and aiding in the recovery 
and maintenance of mood stability [127]. Dialectical behav-
ior therapy (DBT) is highly effective for adults with bipolar 
disorder, but studies in youth are lacking and there are few 
child psychologists skilled in its administration.

Natural supplements for the treatment of emotional dys-
regulation  and  other  symptoms  associated  with  bipolar 
disorder are an emerging and potentially promising option 
[128]. Neutriceuticals, which are generally well tolerated 
and considered to have a good safety profile, can be used as 
an adjunctive treatment or as monotherapy in very young 
children or those with mild impairment for whom the risk 
of adverse events with prescription medications may not 

137

outweigh benefits. While studies in adults have varied out-
comes, utilizing these treatments in pediatrics during brain 
development and at the earliest onset of symptoms holds an 
increased promise of efficacy. The use of omega-3 fatty acids 
and inositol as a combination therapy can reduce manic and 
depressive symptoms in children with bipolar disorder better 
than either treatment used alone [129]. A 12-week, open-
label pilot trial of n-acetylcysteine (NAC) reported reduction 
in mania and depression in 26 children aged 5–17 years with 
bipolar disorder, with an additional improvement of their 
general functioning and quality of life [130]. While gener-
ally not as effective as prescription medications in reducing 
symptoms, many supplements are low-risk and low side-
effect interventions [128]. More data is required before cli-
nicians can turn to natural supplements in select patients in 
clinical practice for pediatric bipolar disorder.

Bipolar disorder in adults is often considered a lifelong 
condition. Longitudinal studies in pediatric-onset bipolar, 
although few in number and limited by short follow-up peri-
ods, find pediatric bipolar disorder to be a highly persistent 
condition [47, 131]. Geller et al. followed pediatric probands 
into adulthood and reported a 44.4% (N = 24) frequency of 
manic episodes, which was 13–44 times higher than popula-
tion prevalences—a strong support for continuity of pediat-
ric bipolar disorder into adulthood [131]. One 6-year follow-
up study reported that 48% (N = 42) of children continued 
to meet full diagnostic criteria for BP-I and that complete 
functional remission is rare [132]. These longitudinal studies 
are not controlled by adequate and early treatment. Addition-
ally, beginning treatment in childhood during rapid brain 
development is an opportunity to treat proximal to the onset 
of bipolar symptoms with appropriate medications, bringing 
the hope of improved outcomes.

Mood-stabilizing medication discontinuation studies in 
pediatrics are lacking. Given the lack of an evidence base, 
and  hope  that  development  and  early  treatment  brings 
improved emotional regulation, prescribing clinicians regu-
larly weigh the risks and benefits of ongoing treatment [133, 
134]. When and how to taper or discontinue medications in a 
child with bipolar disorder is a shared decision with parents, 
and the child when possible, weighing the risks associated 
with continuing the medication versus the risks associated 
with a possible relapse with subsequent treatment resistance. 
Future research is needed to guide clinicians in this difficult 
decision.

6   Conclusions

Progress has been made in understanding the developmen-
tally  distinct  presentation  of  pediatric  bipolar  disorder, 
which can help lead to early diagnosis and treatment with 
the appropriate pharmacologic interventions. Addressing 

Pediatric Bipolar Disorder Advances138 

J. Wozniak et al.

the most serious symptoms of mania and depression with 
mood stabilizers is generally required given the severity of 
the symptoms and concern for the development of treat-
ment resistance with delay to appropriate treatment. Many 
second-generation antipsychotics are US FDA approved for 
the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder and are often first 
line due to effectiveness, but metabolic side effects limit 
their use. The morbidity associated with high rates of comor-
bidity in pediatric bipolar disorder often compels treatment 
for additional conditions once mania and depression have 
been stabilized, despite a dearth of studies to guide this com-
bined pharmacotherapy [135]. Further research is required 
in  younger  populations  to  find  safer  and  more  effective 
options to address the symptoms of mania, depression, and 
comorbid conditions. New treatments with fewer side effects 
are needed to address multiple symptom targets, as well as 
additional medication options to address these side effects. 
Future longitudinal and neurobiologic studies should aim 
to demonstrate the utility of early treatment and to predict 
treatment response and outcomes.
