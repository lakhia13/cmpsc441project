HIGHLIGHTS 
•  A  diverse  range  of 
pharmacological, 
psychological  and  other 
approaches  now  have  an 
evidence  base  for  the 
prevention  and  treatment  of 
PTSD. 
•  This  editorial  introduces 
the  EJPT  special  issue  that 
considers  these 
interventions  and  their 
relative  strengths  in  more 
detail.

ABSTRACT
Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is  a  common  condition  that  affects  millions  of  people  across 
the  world.  Up  to  date  recommendations  based  on  the  best  available  evidence  are  vital  to 
prevent and treat this debilitating condition. In this issue, we are bringing together a series 
of  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  that  underpinned  the  development  of  the  2018 
International  Society  for  Traumatic  Stress  Studies  Guidelines.
The  strongest  evidence  was  found  for  psychological  treatments  for  PTSD,  in  particular 
for  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  with  a  trauma  focus  (CBT-TF)(generic),  cognitive 
processing  therapy  (CPT),  cognitive  therapy  (CT),  eye  movement  desensitisation  and 
reprocessing  (EMDR)  and  prolonged  exposure  (PE).  For  the  subgroup  of  military 
personnel  and  veterans,  results  were  less  impressive.  Dropout  from  trauma-focused 
psychological  treatments  was  higher  than  for  other  forms  of  psychological  treatment 
for  PTSD  in  adults.  For  early  interventions,  CBT-TF,  CT  and  EMDR  were  recommended. 
With  regard  to  pharmacological  approaches,  a  number  of  them  were  effective  but 
with  a  low  effect  size.  Of  the  pharmacologically  assisted  psychotherapies,  MDMA- 
assisted  psychotherapy  was  promising.  Six  complementary  and  alternative  approaches 
showed  emerging  evidence.
We  now  have  an  evidence  base  for  a  diverse  range  of  pharmacological,  psychological  and 
other approaches that should facilitate their implementation and lead to the more effective 
management  of  people  affected  by  traumatic  events.

Prevención  y  Tratamiento  del  TEPT:  La  base  de  evidencia  actual 
El  trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  es  una  condición  frecuente  que  afecta  a  millones  de 
personas en el mundo. Las recomendaciones actualizadas basadas en las mejores evidencias 
disponibles  son  vitales  para  prevenir  y  tratar  esta  condición  debilitante.  En  este  número, 
reunimos una serie de revisiones sistemáticas y metanálisis que respaldaron el desarrollo de 
las  Guías  Clínicas  de  la  Sociedad  Internacional  para  el  Estudio  del  Estrés  Traumático  del 
2018.
La  evidencia  más  sólida  se  encontró  para  los  tratamientos  psicológicos  para  el  TEPT, 
en  particular  para  la  terapia  cognitivo  conductual  centrada  en  el  trauma  (CBT-TF  por 
sus  siglas  en  inglés)  (genérica),  la  terapia  de  procesamiento  cognitivo  (CPT  por  sus 
siglas  en  inglés),  terapia  cognitiva  (CT  por  sus  siglas  en  ingles),  desensibilización 
y  reprocesamiento  por  movimientos  oculares  (EMDR)  y  exposición  prolongada  (PE 
por  sus  siglas  en  inglés).  Para  el  subgrupo  de  personal  militar  y  veteranos,  los 
resultados 
tratamientos 
psicológicos  centrados  en  el  trauma  fue  mayor  que  otras  formas  de  tratamientos 
psicológicos  para  TEPT  en  adultos.  Para  intervenciones  tempranas,  se  recomendaron 
la  CBT-TF,  CT  y  EMDR.  Con  respecto  a  los  enfoques  farmacológicos  varios  de  ellos 
fueron  efectivos  pero  con  un  tamaño  de  efecto  bajo.  De  las  psicoterapias  asistidas 
farmacológicamente  la  psicoterapia  asistida  con  MDMA  fue  prometedora.  Seis  enfo-
ques  complementarios  y  alternativos  mostraron  evidencia  emergente.
Ahora  tenemos  una  base  de  evidencia  para  una  amplia  gama  de  enfoques  farmacológicos, 
psicológicos  y  de  otro  tipo  que  deberían  facilitar  su  implementación  y  conducir  a  un 
manejo  más  efectivo  de  las  personas  afectadas  por  eventos  traumáticos.

1. Introduction

The COVID-19 crisis is a timely reminder that, sadly, 
traumatic  experiences  are highly  prevalent across the 
world (Kessler et al., 2017) and a major public health 
issue  (Magruder,  McLaughlin,  &  Elmore  Borbon, 
2017).  It  is,  therefore,  essential  that  we  understand 
how  best  to  help  those  affected  by  traumatic  events 
and that effective interventions are available to reduce 
the  psychosocial  impact  of  them.

There has been and is much debate on how best to 
prevent  and  treat  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD).  More  recently,  this  debate  has  extended  to 
include the management of complex PTSD (CPTSD). 
Since  the  first  International  Society  for  Traumatic 
Stress  Studies  (ISTSS)  Treatment  Guidelines  were 
published  in  2000  (Foa,  Keane,  &  Friedman,  2000), 
there  has  been  an  almost  exponential  growth  in  the 
number  of  prevention  and  treatment  trials  con-
ducted. Despite this, it has remained difficult to pro-
vide 
all 
prevention  and  treatment  questions,  resulting  in 
alternative  methods  being  used  to  develop  evidence- 
informed  recommendations,  such  as  the  use  of 
Delphi methodology for the ESTSS TENTS guidelines 
(Bisson  et  al.,  2010).

(International 

The  third  version  of  the  ISTSS  Prevention  and 
Society  of 
Treatment  Guidelines 
Traumatic  Stress  Studies  (ISTSS)  [Online],  2018a)  was 
published  in  late  2018  and  provide  recommendations 
based on syntheses of data from randomized controlled 
trials  (RCTs).  The  ISTSS  Guidelines  were  developed 
through a robust methodological process involving sys-
tematic  reviews  of  the  literature,  meta-analyses  of  RCT 
results  that  addressed  specific  scoping  questions,  and 
then  the  development  of  recommendations  from  the 
evidence  available 
following  an  agreed  algorithm 
(Bisson  et  al.,  2019).  In  the  case  of  CPTSD,  the  ISTSS 
Treatment  Guidelines  Committee  determined  that, 
because of definitional issues and the limited availability 
of  appropriate  clinical  trials,  meaningful  meta-analyses 
could not be conducted. Instead, narrative reviews of the 
current situation were undertaken to facilitate the devel-
opment  of  a  definitive  evidence  base  to  inform  future 
recommendations  on  the  management  of  CPTSD  in 
children,  adolescents  and  adults  (International  Society 
of  Traumatic  Stress  Studies  (ISTSS)  [Online],  2018b, 
2018c).

This  special  EJPT  issue  provides  readers  with  an 
opportunity  to  read  more  detailed  accounts  of  the 

majority  of  the  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses 
that  underpin  the  ISTSS  Guideline  recommendations 
for  adults  and  represents  a  detailed  picture  of  the  state 
of the art with respect to the prevention and treatment at 
the time this work was completed.

2. Articles  in  this  issue

Early  psychological  interventions  for  adults  exposed  to 
trauma  (Roberts,  Kitchiner,  Kenardy,  Lewis,  &  Bisson, 
2020). This paper  concludes that the  quality of  the evi-
dence  remains  low  but  includes  recommendations  for 
cognitive behavioural therapy with a trauma focus (CBT- 
TF), cognitive therapy and eye movement desensitisation 
and reprocessing (EMDR) for early treatment.

Psychological treatments for adults with PTSD (Lewis, 
Roberts,  Andrew,  Starling,  &  Bisson,  2020).  This  paper 
demonstrates the large increase in RCTs of psychological 
treatments  for  adults  that  allowed  individual  forms  of 
cognitive behavioural therapy with a trauma focus (CBT- 
TF) to be evaluated separately in addition to as a family of 
interventions. Sixteen different treatments received some 
form  of  recommendation,  CBT-TF  (generic),  cognitive 
processing  therapy,  cognitive  therapy,  EMDR  and  pro-
longed exposure all received the strongest recommenda-
tion available, making them the first-line treatments for 
PTSD.

Psychological treatment for active duty and ex-serving 
military personnel (Kitchiner, Lewis, Roberts, & Bisson, 
2019).  This  paper  provides  a  sub-analysis  of  studies 
included in the psychological treatment paper described 
above. The results for military personnel and veterans are 
less impressive than for the population as a whole. The 
UK’s  NICE  Guideline  (NICE,  2018)  decision  not  to 
recommend  EMDR  for  veterans  is  supported  by  the 
meta-analyses  in  this  paper  although  the  low  number 
and  low  quality  of  the  studies  available  may  have 
impacted this finding.

Dropout  from  psychological  treatment  (Lewis, 
Roberts,  Gibson,  &  Bisson,  2020).  The  reasons  for 
dropout  are  multiple  and  it  is  important  not  to 
equate  it  solely  with  tolerability  of  a  treatment, 
although  these  issues  do  seem  to  be  related  to 
a  degree.  This  review  found  that  dropout  from 
trauma-focused  psychological 
treatments  was 
higher  than  for  other  forms  of  psychological  treat-
ment  for  PTSD  in  adults.

Pharmacological  treatment  of  adults  with  PTSD 
(Hoskins  et  al.,  2020).  This  paper  demonstrates  strong 
low  effect  evidence  for  a  number  of  pharmacological 

approaches. Fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and venla-
faxine  all  have  good  evidence  that  they  reduce  PTSD 
symptoms in adults but the magnitude of improvement 
appears to be less than that found for the psychological 
treatments with the best evidence of effect.

Pharmacologically-assisted  psychotherapy  for  adults 
with PTSD (Hoskins et al., 2020). Although not included 
in  the  ISTSS  Guidelines,  the  emergence  of  MDMA- 
assisted psychotherapy and other approaches that com-
bine medication and psychological treatment make this 
an  increasingly  important  area  to  consider.  MDMA- 
assisted  psychotherapy  was  the  most  promising  of  the 
interventions  considered  and  shown  to  have  emerging 
evidence of effect.

Non-psychological  and  non-pharmacological  inter-
ventions  (Bisson,  Van  Gelderen,  Roberts,  &  Lewis, 
2020). The final paper provides an overview of the results 
of the systematic review and meta-analyses that led to the 
final  group  of  ISTSS  recommendations.  There  is  emer-
ging  evidence  for  six  different  interventions,  including 
yoga,  neurofeedback,  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation 
and acupuncture. These findings have major clinical and 
research  implications  and  should  encourage  more 
research with respect to complementary and alternative 
approaches.

3. Future  work

It is hoped that this unique collection of papers will 
stimulate  people  working  in  the  field  to  undertake 
further  research  to  develop  more  effective  interven-
tions  for  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  PTSD  by 
refining  existing  effective  approaches  and  develop-
ing  new  ones.  There  are  a  large  number  of  inter-
ventions  with  emerging  evidence  of  effect  that 
appear  to  be  at  a  point  where  further  development 
would  help  them  develop  to  the  next  level.

There  are  also  major  questions  to  be  answered  with 
respect  to  how  best  to  effectively  implement  evidence- 
based interventions into practice at scale across the world, 
to maximise global impact and improve the health and 
wellbeing  of  people  exposed  to  traumatic  events  (Olff 
et  al.,  2019).  Work  is  ongoing  to  facilitate  this,  e.g. 
through  the  development  of  decision  aids  focused  on 
people  with  PTSD,  to  help  them  navigate  the  current 
evidence base and inform decision-making that is right 
for their needs.
