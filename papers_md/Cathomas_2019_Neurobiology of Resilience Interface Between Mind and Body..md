Abstract

Stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder and posttraumatic 
stress disorder exact enormous socio-economic and individual consequences. Resilience, the 
process of adaptation in the face of adversity, is an important concept that is enabling the field to 
understand individual differences in stress responses, with the hope of harnessing this information 
for the development of novel therapeutics that mimic the body’s natural resilience mechanisms. 
This review provides an update on the current state of research of the neurobiological mechanisms 
of stress-resilience. We focus on physiological and transcriptional adaptations of specific brain 
circuits, the role of cellular and humoral factors of the immune system, the gut microbiota and 
changes at the interface between the brain and the periphery, the blood-brain barrier. We propose 
to view resilience as a process that requires the integration of multiple central and peripheral 
systems and that elucidating the underlying neurobiological mechanisms will ultimately lead to 
novel therapeutic options.

however also intuitive that the individual reactions to similar traumatic events can be very 
different. These range from lifelong disabling mental disorders to relatively moderate acute 
stress reactions or even a strengthening effect that protects one from future traumas. The 
topic of the current review is stress-resilience, defined here based on the American 
Psychological Association as “the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, 
tragedy, threats or significant sources of stress” (1).

Our aim is to provide an update on the current state of research of the neurobiological 
mechanisms of stress-resilience, focusing on literature that has specifically investigated 
resilience in pre-clinical rodent models relevant to major depressive disorder (MDD) and 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Stress, resilience and the HPA axis:

An adequate reaction of the body to acute threats is a crucial mechanism to adapt to 
environmental changes that occur in different developmental stages throughout life. The 
autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis play a key 
role in orchestrating the body’s reaction to threats (2). Upon danger, the hypothalamus 
secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone, which via the pituitary hormone 
adrenocorticotropin induces production of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Parallel 
activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to effects on several peripheral organs, 
including release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. These responses mediate the 
necessary acute “fight-or-flight” reaction (3) (4). On the other hand, stress of extreme nature 
or prolonged duration is among the most important risk factor for many diseases, including 
neuropsychiatric disorders such as MDD and PTSD (5) (6). An informative 
conceptualization of this continuum between adaptive and maladaptive stress was introduced 
with the terms allostasis and allostatic load. While allostasis refers to the adaptive processes 
that maintain homeostasis, the term allostatic load describes the cumulative burden of 
adaptations that result when the involved systems fail to shut off after the stressor has 
subsided or when these systems do not respond adequately (7) (8).

Responses to similar stressors are strikingly distinct across individuals, and the first 
scientific attention drawn to resilience as a phenomenon of adaptation in the context of risk 
or adversity took place in the 1970s (9). It was soon established that resilience is a common 
phenomenon rather than an extraordinary process (10). Over the years, several factors have 
been linked to resilience, including a strong social support network as well as intrinsic 
behavioral traits such as optimism (11) (12). Individual coping strategies (13) are 
particularly relevant to resilience and can be classified into two categories. 1) Active coping 
responses are intentional efforts of the subject aimed at minimizing the physical, 
psychological, or social harm of a stressor and are associated with actual or perceived 
control over the stressor (14). Such coping is considered to lead to changes facilitating an 
adaptive, resilient response (14). 2) Passive coping, in contrast, includes mechanisms such as 
avoidance or helplessness and is associated with increased vulnerability (15) (16).

Rodent models of susceptibility and resilience:

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience have long been difficult to uncover, 
primarily because creating significant adversity in humans in controlled experimental 
settings is impossible and exploration of molecular and circuit brain mechanisms in humans 
remains limited. Over the past decade, advances in pre-clinical animal stress models that 
uncover individual differences in stress-reactivity have allowed detailed neurobiological 
characterization of the precise mechanisms of stress-vulnerability vs. resilience (14) (17). 
One of the first animal models demonstrated to separate susceptible and resilient phenotypes 
is learned helplessness (LH) (18) (19). However, there are considerable shortcomings in the 
validity of the LH procedure to depression-like behaviors, including that the depression-like 
behaviors only last a few days and in some strains acute administration of an antidepressant 
is sufficient to reverse LH behavior (19). Additionally, Nasca et al. showed individual 
differences in response to both chronic unpredictable stress and restraint stress with some 
mice exhibiting resilience to development of depression- and anxiety-related behaviors (20).

Another widely used rodent stress model, which distinguishes susceptible and resilient 
phenotypes with greater etiological validity, is repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) (21) 
(17). Over a period of usually ten days, a rat or mouse is repeatedly subordinated by a 
dominant animal; for example, a C57BL6 mouse is defeated by a larger, more aggressive 
CD1 mouse (22) (23). Importantly, despite undergoing the same stress, individual mice and 
rats (even from inbred strains) display different behaviors. While susceptible mice are 
characterized by alterations in behaviors with high face validity to MDD, such as social 
avoidance and anhedonia (measured by the preferences of a sweet tasting solution over 
water), resilient mice do no show these changes and display behaviors similar to control 
mice (24). Until recently, one major limitation of this model was that, mainly because innate 
aggression of male towards female mice is limited, it could only be applied in male C57BL6 
mice (25), although female social defeat has been validated in a different mouse species 
(26). From a translational perspective, male and female patients differ not only in the 
prevalence of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, but also in their clinical presentations 
(27) (28). Therefore, it is a major recent advance that two female mouse models, both based 
on the defeat stress paradigm, have been developed for C57BL6 mice: Harris et al. proposed 
a model, in which male urine is applied to females to induce CD1 males to attack them (29). 
Another paradigm uses a DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer 
drugs) approach, where induction of aggression in male CD1 mice towards female C57BL6 
mice is achieved by activation of the ventromedial hypothalamus (30). Similar to social 
defeat in males, both stress models lead to different stress responses with some female mice 
being susceptible and others resilient (29) (30). These models will provide important tools to 
further elucidate neurobiological mechanisms underlying sex specific differences and 
commonalities in stress-responses relevant to affective disorders (see (31) for review).

Given that adversity experienced in childhood and during adolescence can profoundly 
impact individual trajectories, early life stress animal models are of great importance (32). 
Several established rodent early-life stress paradigms exist, with maternal separation and 
reduced bedding material being the most commonly used (33). Interestingly, the relation 
between the extent of stress-exposure and stress response is not linear. While no/low and

high levels of stress have a negative effect on performance, moderate exposure to stress can 
promote active coping responses and therefore have pro-resilient effects. If pups experience 
maternal-deprivation for a long period, they show higher susceptibility to subsequent 
stressors in adult life, HPA axis hyperactivity and altered glucocorticoid responses (34) (35). 
However, if stress exposure is less severe, it can have pro-resilient effects, a process termed 
stress-inoculation. Rat pups that are exposed to postnatal handling, a moderate early life 
stress, display lower plasma levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone and an attenuated 
stress-induced increase in plasma corticosterone compared to both rats that were left 
undisturbed and those that were severely stressed as pups (36). Additionally, certain 
behavioral traits that manifest in early life are associated with outcomes in later life. Rats 
that showed less exploratory behavior of a novel environment in early life had a shorter life 
span than their more exploratory conspecifics (37).

Decades of research have investigated the importance of the HPA axis in psychosocial stress 
and indeed led to potential clinically applicable biomarkers, e.g., neuropeptide Y (NPY) or 
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (38) (39). Nevertheless, progress in the development of 
novel therapeutics, including generation of resilience-promoting drugs that directly target the 
HPA axis, stands in no relation to the vast number of pre-clinical findings that exist, making 
more effective translational research a high priority.

Central Nervous System Mechanisms of Resilience

Hippocampal neurogenesis:

The hippocampus is important in mediating responses to stress. Both mineralocorticoid and 
glucocorticoid receptors are vastly expressed in the hippocampus, making it a region highly 
responsive to activation of the HPA axis (40) (41). The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is 
capable of generating functional neurons from adult neural precursors, a process termed 
adult neurogenesis (42). Stress and glucocorticoid release decrease adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis, a process that is reversed by treatment with some but not all antidepressants 
(43) (44). The findings regarding the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mediating 
RSDS-induced susceptibility vs. resilience, however, are inconsistent. Lagace et al. showed 
that, compared with resilient and control mice, susceptible mice display enhanced survival 
of dentate gyrus neurons four weeks after the defeat that were born 24 hours after but not 
before defeat stress. Irradiation-induced ablation of neurogenesis led to pro-resilient 
behaviors. The authors suggested that this compensatory enhancement in hippocampal 
neurogenesis is related to the maladaptive stress response (45). In contrast, a recent study 
reported that increasing hippocampal neurogenesis promotes resilience to social defeat stress 
(46) (Fig. 1B). The authors used a gain-of-function model, where deletion of the pro-
apoptotic gene Bax from adult neural stem cells was sufficient to increase hippocampal 
neurogenesis, and showed that this manipulation protects from social defeat-induced social 
avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors (46). The authors additionally describe a population of 
stress-responsive cells that are inhibited by adult-born neurons and suggested that direct 
silencing of these cells confers resilience to stress (46).

Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons:

The mesolimbic dopamine pathway is a key reward circuit, in which DA neurons project 
from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and 
other forebrain regions (47). Neurons of the VTA release dopamine in response to both 
rewarding and aversive stimuli and different stressors can differentially influence the 
dopaminergic neurons of the VTA (48) (49) (50). One of the key findings of this circuit is 
that stress-susceptible mice show increased firing of DA neurons projecting from the VTA to 
the NAc, whereas projections from the VTA to the mPFC display the opposite (Figure 1D) 
(49). Interestingly, resilient mice display control-level firing activity in both of the 
aforementioned circuits (51) (52). Further supporting the role of the VTA in actively 
mediating resilience are data from gene expression studies, where both in the VTA and NAc 
significantly more genes were regulated in resilient compared to susceptible mice (24). 
Particularly interesting, the microarray data revealed upregulation of four distinct potassium 
(K+) channel subunits in the VTA of resilient mice only (Fig. 1D) (24). These findings 
suggest that K+ channels may play an active functional role in driving the higher firing of 
VTA DA neurons back to normal levels in resilient mice, indicating that resilience represents 
a physiological state distinct from control mediated by a host of resilience-promoting 
mechanisms. It is known that RSDS increases the excitatory Ih current in VTA DA neurons 
of susceptible mice, and induces even greater increases in Ih in these neurons of resilient 
mice (51) (53) (54). Further studies showed that local infusion of HCN (Hyperpolarization-
activated cyclic nucleotide–gated) channel inhibitors into the VTA rapidly normalized social 
avoidance in susceptible mice (53) (51). This finding suggests that the force that drives the 
pathological higher firing exists in resilient mice, but that additional compensative ionic 
mechanisms such as K+ channel induction could drive the higher firing back to normal levels 
in resilient mice as stated above. Further, measuring K+ currents revealed a selective 
increase in resilient mice (51). Among these voltagegated K+ currents, KCNQ subtype of K+ 
channels plays a key role in regulating the firing activity of VTA DA neurons and 
pharmacologically enhancing KCNQ channels showed significant antidepressant-like effects 
in the RSDS model (51). Informed by these pre-clinical results, a recent study reported that a 
10-week treatment with a non-selective KCNQ channel opener, ezogabine, decreases 
depressive symptoms in MDD patients, an effect associated with changes of ventral striatal 
connectivity as a function of clinical improvement (55).

The NAc and its inputs:

The NAc integrates dopaminergic projections from the VTA and glutamatergic inputs from 
the hippocampus, PFC, amygdala and thalamus and is comprised largely of two subtypes of 
GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that express predominantly either dopamine 1 
(D1) or D2 receptors and play important roles in a host of reward-related behaviors (56) (57) 
(58). Distinct glutamatergic inputs to the NAc allow this region to bidirectionally regulate 
reward and aversion (59) (60) (61) (62), leading to the hypothesis that depression—and by 
extension resilience—may be due in part to alterations in glutamatergic function within the 
NAc (63). For example, it was observed that susceptible mice have more excitatory dendritic 
spines and increased postsynaptic transmission onto NAc MSNs compared to resilient mice 
(Fig. 1E) (64) (65). Francis and colleagues (66) expanded upon these initial findings to show 
increased glutamate transmission specifically on D2 MSNs of susceptible mice relative to

resilient mice (Fig. 1E). While there were no changes in excitatory currents in D1 MSNs 
following RSDS, the authors found an increase in excitability of D1 MSNs in resilient mice 
relative to susceptible mice (Fig. 1E). Subsequent studies by Khibnik et al. suggested that 
the upregulated amplitude of unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents specifically on 
mushroom spines of D1-MSNs could represent an active adaptation enabling the mice to 
better cope with the effects of social stress (67). Together, this work points to cell- and 
possibly circuit-specific glutamatergic signaling within the NAc that promotes stress 
resilience. Given what we know about NAc glutamate signaling in susceptibility vs. 
resilience, it has been suggested that distinct inputs to NAc may control positive vs. negative 
mood states following chronic stress contributing to either susceptible or resilient 
phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, research has employed in vivo optogenetic approaches 
to stimulate or inhibit PFC-NAc, thalamus-NAc, BLA-NAc or ventral subiculum (vSub)-
NAc glutamate pathways in mediating stress responses during social defeat stress (62) (61). 
It was found that stimulation of glutamate inputs from either the thalamus or vSub both 
potentiate social avoidance following subthreshold social defeat stress. By contrast, 
stimulation of PFC-NAc glutamate inputs promotes resilience, but only under very specific 
conditions, and studies to silence these inputs using halorhodopsin have no effect (62) (61). 
This suggests that PFC neurons either promote resilience via collateral pathways or that 
different stimulation parameters evoke different postsynaptic effects on NAc MSNs. While 
these findings clearly define the importance of input specificity to NAc neurons in encoding 
susceptibility vs. resilience, we still have a limited understanding of how these inputs 
differentially activate the NAc. One possibility is that specific inputs are differentially 
connected to D1 vs. D2 MSNs or perhaps to GABAergic vs. cholinergic interneurons. In 
vivo tracing studies support this possibility (68), however, functional studies in mouse 
models of resilience are required to confirm this hypothesis.

The locus coeruleus (LC) and its outputs:

There is increasing evidence that the LC, a norepinephrine (NE) producing brainstem 
nucleus, plays a role in stress susceptibility and resilience (69) (70). The LC provides 
virtually all of the NE input throughout the forebrain and also innervates the VTA. Isingrini 
et al. showed that resilient mice display increased NE release from LC neurons that project 
to the VTA (Fig. 1C) (71). In a recent study, Zhang et al. reported that resilient but not 
susceptible mice show increased firing of LC neurons that project to the VTA (Fig. 1C) and 
that mimicking this adaptive change by optogenetic stimulation in stress-susceptible mice 
promotes resilience (72). Molecular profiling and pharmacological studies identify α1- and 
β3-adrenergic receptors expressed by VTA DA neurons as being sufficient and necessary to 
induce resilience, providing an additional potential pharmacological target which now 
warrants clinical investigation (72).

Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms:

Transcription factors have been implicated as important mechanisms in mediating 
environmental influences on the brain (73). As alluded to above, several brain-region 
specific gene expression studies have indicated that resilience is an active process with the 
involvement of greater transcriptional activity than stress susceptibility (74) (75). Several 
forms of stress induce ΔFosB, a truncated product of the  FosB immediate early gene, in

specific brain regions, including the NAc (76) (77). Interestingly, ΔFosB induction in the 
NAc after RSDS is cell-type specific. The modest induction of ΔFosB in susceptible mice 
takes place in D2 MSNs, whereas the more robust induction in resilient mice is specific to 
D1 MSNs (Fig. 1E) (78) (79). Viral overexpression of ΔFosB in D1 MSNs promotes a 
resilient behavioral phenotype and is necessary for the antidepressant action of fluoxetine 
(78) (79) (80) (81). Further supporting its importance, ΔFosB is reduced in post-mortem 
NAc tissue of patients with MDD (78). Additionally, β-catenin, a downstream factor of 
WNT (wingless) signaling, is highly regulated in the NAc of resilient mice (82). Again, this 
effect is cell-type specific, since overexpression of β-catenin in D2- but not D1-type MSNs 
induces a pro-resilient phenotype, mediated in part through activation of Dicer1 and 
downstream generation of microRNAs (miRNAs) (Fig. 1E) (83). In a recent study, Lorsch et 
al. identified in the PFC the zinc-finger transcription factor Zfp189 as a key hub gene in a 
resilient-specific gene module (84). The authors reported that cAMP response element-
binding protein (CREB) was the strongest predicted upstream regulator of genes within this 
module and showed that overexpression of Zfp189 in the PFC promoted resilience (Fig. 1A).

The initial findings linking epigenetic alterations and MDD were that broad inhibition of 
histone deacetylases (HDACs) in several brain regions, including NAc, hippocampus and 
PFC, led to antidepressant-like effects in stressed rodents (85). Additional evidence came 
from studies suggesting that antidepressant effects of fluoxetine were in part mediated by 
histone acetylation (86). However, alternate studies have begun to unravel the complex 
mechanisms of histone modifications and have revealed opposing effects of certain HDACs. 
For example, RSDS decreased expression of Hdac5 in the NAc of susceptible mice and 
chronic imipramine administration increased its expression, therefore suggesting a potential 
pro-resilient effect (87). AAV-mediated Hdac2 overexpression in the same brain region 
protected mice from chronic ultra-mild stress induced social avoidance (88). These findings 
suggest that different HDACs regulate different genes to promote susceptibility versus 
resilience.

DNA methylation is a process during which a methyl group is covalently attached to 
cytosine (and rarely other nucleotides) and leads generally via hyper-methylation of gene 
promotors to inactivation of gene expression (89). One interesting target relevant to stress 
susceptibility and resilience is the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3a: DNMT3a expression 
is elevated both in the NAc of human MDD patients and in stress-susceptible mice. 
Interestingly, Dnmt3a manipulation seems to have sex-specific effects: overexpression of 
Dnmt3a in the NAc makes both female and male mice susceptible to subthreshold variable 
stress, while knockout of Dnmt3a in the NAc promotes resilience selectively in females (90) 
(91).

Another mechanism of transcriptional regulation takes place through non-protein coding 
RNAs (92). Recent transcriptional studies have shown that stress leads to brain region 
specific changes in miRNA expression (93) (94). As an example of the function of miRNAs 
in promoting resilience, Higuchi and colleagues showed that overexpression of miR-124, an 
endogenous small, noncoding RNA that represses gene expression post-transcriptionally, in 
hippocampal neurons confers stress-resilience (Fig. 1B) (95). Recent advances in molecular 
methods and gene-editing technologies will enable precise cell-type specific manipulation of

understanding of the transcriptional and chromatin-based mechanisms of resilience (96) (97) 
(81).

Peripheral Mechanisms of Resilience

The innate immune system:

Both pre-clinical animal models and human studies show that repeated psychosocial stress 
leads to profound peripheral immunological changes (98) (99). Evidence from human 
studies linking stress-vulnerability and resilience to immune-alterations exists at multiple 
levels: a subset of patients with MDD show elevated levels of several pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (100) (101), MDD has high comorbidity with chronic inflammatory illnesses such 
as autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disorders or cancer (102) (103) (104) and certain 
anti-inflammatory therapies potentially elicit antidepressant effects (105). Whether 
traditional antidepressants reduce peripheral cytokine levels, remains controversial, with a 
recent meta-analysis indicating a reduction of levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and possibly IL-6 
(106). Interestingly, there is evidence that the rapid acting antidepressant ketamine reduces 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (107) (108). However, whether these inflammatory 
changes are causally linked to antidepressant effects remains unclear.

The innate immune system, which represents the first line of host defense during infection, 
plays an important role in the early recognition and subsequent triggering of a pro-
inflammatory response to invading pathogens (109) (110). Similar to the response to 
pathogens, chronic stress leads to an increase of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory 
mediators, e.g., Ly6chigh monocytes and neutrophils or IL-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α, respectively (111) (112). Hodes et al. was one of the first to investigate differences 
between stress-susceptible vs. -resilient phenotypes. After RSDS, resilient mice displayed 
lower blood levels of IL-6 than susceptible mice (Fig. 1G) and both neutralizing IL-6 with a 
systemically-administered antibody and depleting IL-6 from bone-derived leukocytes using 
chimeric mice promoted resilience (113). Additionally, pre-defeat inflammatory markers 
predicted how mice will respond to RSDS: mice susceptible after RSDS displayed more pre-
existing circulating leukocytes than resilient mice and IL-6 release upon stimulation with the 
bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) correlated negatively with social interaction 
scores (113). Additional work by Pfau et al. investigated the potential role of stress-induced 
epigenetic regulation of leukocytes by miRNAs (114). The authors reported that, within 
Ly6Chigh monocytes of mice exposed to RSDS, several miRNAs were regulated by RSDS, 
including miR-25-3p, a member of the miR-106b~25 cluster (114). Selective knockout of 
the miR-106b~25 cluster in peripheral leukocytes promoted behavioral resilience to RSDS 
(114). Given that Ly6Chigh monocytes tend to be more inflammatory in nature, it is thought 
that these cells may be a prominent source of inflammatory molecules following stress and 
therapeutic strategies targeting Ly6Chigh may promote resilience by reducing inflammation. 
Indeed, systemic administration of the phytochemicals, dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA) and 
malvidin-3′-O-glucoside (Mal-gluc), promoted stress-resilience in mice by decreasing IL-6 
release from leukocytes (115) (Fig. 1G).

The adaptive immune system:

The adaptive immune system is involved in the later phase of an infection, where it fights 
invading pathogens with an immune response characterized by clonal gene rearrangement of 
antigen-specific receptors on lymphocytes and the formation of an immunological memory 
(116). Far fewer studies have investigated its main cellular components, B and T 
lymphocytes (117), in stress responses. One meta-analysis concludes that MDD patients 
show reduced T-cell proportions and a moderate increase in the ratio of CD4/CD8 T-cells in 
blood (118). Rodent studies have indicated a potential neuroprotective or pro-resilient effect 
of T cells (119). Immunization of rats with modified myelin basic protein (MBP), which 
leads to the induction of autoreactive T-cells, prior to chronic mild stress (CMS), reduced 
depressive-like behaviors such as anhedonia endpoints and immobility in the forced swim 
test (Fig. 1H) (120). These changes went along with the rescue of CMS-induced BDNF 
decrease in the hippocampus (120). Interestingly, recruitment of T-cells to the CNS 
correlated positively with stress-resilience (121). The authors showed that T-cells infiltrated 
the choroid plexus, which displayed an increase in the intracellular adhesion molecule 
ICAM-1 (121). Additionally, mice depleted of lymphocytes (Rag2−/−) receiving 
lymphocytes from defeated donors displayed less anxiety-like behaviors, reduced pro-
inflammatory cytokine levels and microglia shifting towards an anti-inflammatory 
phenotype, compared with those receiving no cells or cells from unstressed donors (122). 
This work suggests that psychosocial stress imprints onto the adaptive immune system 
which then influences the outcome of stress exposure. It can be speculated that resilience to 
psychosocial stress may be promoted via behavioral immunization, where in analogy to 
traditional vaccination strategies, exposure to an attenuated antigen can protect against 
successive stressful events (Fig. 1H) (123) (124).

Gut microbiota:

Microbiota refers to the collection of microorganisms in a particular habitat, e.g., the skin or 
gut (125). The gut microbiota has been implicated in a wide range of physiological 
processes including interactions with the host immune system and direct effects on the brain, 
for example, by production of neuroactive metabolites (126). These pathways, subsumed in 
the term “microbiota-gut-brain axis”, are an important modulator of the body’s response to 
stress (127) (126). Several studies reported disturbances in gut microbiota composition in 
MDD patients compared to healthy controls (128) (129). In a seminal mouse study, germ-
free mice (animals that lack bacterial colonization) displayed increased motor activity and 
reduced anxiety-like behavior coincident with elevated NE, DA and serotonin turnover in the 
striatum (130). Interestingly, it was possible to transfer an “anxious” behavioral phenotype 
between two mouse strains (BALB/c vs. NIH Swiss) via fecal microbiota transfer (131). 
Additionally, fecal microbiota transplantation of germ-free mice with microbiota derived 
from MDD patients resulted in increased depression-like behaviors, compared to mice 
colonized with microbiota from healthy controls (132). Regarding resilience, a small study 
reported that oral intake of Bifidobacterium significantly increases the number of resilient 
mice after RSDS compared with vehicle-treated mice (133) (Fig. 1I). Treatment with 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus led to decreased RSDS-induced anxiety-like behaviors, prevented 
deficits in social interaction with conspecifics and attenuated stress-related activation of 
dendritic cells while increasing IL-10+ regulatory T cells, suggesting a potential resilience-

promoting interaction with the immune system (134). However, the mechanisms that link 
gut dysbiosis to stress-susceptibility and resilience associated immune-disturbances, remain 
to be elucidated.

The blood-brain barrier:

The blood-brain barrier, comprised of brain microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes and 
pericytes, is an important interface between the brain and the systemic circulation (135). 
Under homeostatic conditions, the BBB tightly controls the communication between these 
two compartments: cytokines for example do not passively diffuse into the brain but are, in a 
saturable manner, transported actively from the blood to the brain (136). Under stress 
conditions however, studies in humans and rodents have implicated neurovascular 
impairment in stress responses (137) (138). One study revealed that RSDS in mice decreases 
the endothelial tight junction protein Claudin-5, resulting in a higher permeability to the 
peripheral cytokine IL-6 (139) (Fig. 1F). In this study, viral-mediated downregulation of 
Claudin-5 promoted greater susceptibility to RSDS. Importantly, Claudin-5 was found to be 
downregulated in postmortem NAc tissue from MDD patients (139). Another study 
conducted with rats found that passive coping animals display greater vascular remodeling 
than active coping animals, with active coping seen as a pro-resilience phenotype (140). 
Using a murine LH model, Cheng et al. showed that BBB permeability increases in the 
hippocampus of mice after LH induction, and this was maintained in mice with prolonged 
LH, whereas the BBB permeability had normalized in mice that recovered from LH (141).

Neuro-immune interactions.

A wealth of evidence indicates that stress influences the peripheral immune system resulting 
in depression-associated behavioral changes. However, the specific mechanisms are still not 
well understood. It has been suggested that because RSDS leads to brain region specific 
BBB disruption (i.e. increased permeability in the NAc but not in other brain regions), 
infiltrating cytokines may act directly on these brain regions to affect neuronal function 
(139). In accord with this hypothesis, it was recently shown that peripheral IL-6 is necessary 
for maladaptive synaptic plasticity in NAc of susceptible mice following RSDS (115). 
Another interesting possibility is that the central nervous system itself might attract 
peripheral immune cells, in a region-specific way, to impact brain circuits. A recent study by 
McKim et al. (142) reported that the development of anxiety-like behaviors during stress 
was dependent on microglial recruitment of IL-1β-producing monocytes, which stimulated 
brain endothelial IL-1R1 (142). This study adds to the increasing evidence that glial cells, 
the non-neuronal cells of the nervous system constitute an important interface between the 
periphery and neuronal dysfunction (143). While an in-depth discussion of the role of glial 
cells is beyond the scope of this review, it is important to take into account the regulatory 
and immune surveillance functions of microglia, the brain-resident macrophages (see (144) 
for review). Different lines of evidence indicate a role of microglia in stress-associated 
neuropsychiatric disorders. Social defeat stress leads to morphological and functional 
changes in microglia (145). Post-mortem brain analysis in patients that committed suicide 
showed significant microgliosis (146) and brain translocator protein density, a marker of 
increased microglial activation, was elevated in MDD patients (147). With regard to 
resilience, the antibiotic minocycline prevented chronic unpredictable stress induced

anhedonia in rats, indicating that manipulations of microglia could be pro-resilient (148). 
Given that metabolites produced by the gut microbiota can not only influence the immune 
system but also directly affect glial cells (149) and the BBB (150), the concept of providing 
resilience via specific modulation of the gut microbiota could provide a promising avenue 
for novel treatments.

Conclusion and Outlook

The societal and individual burden entailed by stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders is 
immense. Past efforts in developing treatments for such disorders have focused on 
preventing or reversing the damaging effects of stress. Understanding the neurobiological 
mechanisms that promote resilience to stress in some individuals, but lacking in those who 
are inherently more susceptible, constitutes a novel, additional important approach in stress 
biology. Indeed, early clinical studies suggest that inducing mechanisms of natural resilience 
in depressed humans might be an effective route for antidepressant drug discovery. As 
shown in this review, the neurobiology of resilience is complex, involving many convergent 
systems that ultimately affect brain function and behavior. One of the main challenges will 
be to gain a holistic model of resilience that encompasses both peripheral systems and key 
circuits in the brain to answer central questions in the field. To address the many open 
questions in the field, with the ultimate goal of developing much needed therapeutic options, 
a multi-disciplinary, translational approach, incorporating multiple levels of analysis of the 
brain as well as studies of several peripheral organs, will be critical.

Fig. 1. 
Stress-resilience, the process of positive adaptation in the face of psychosocial stress, is a 
complex process that involves both central and peripheral mechanisms. In the central 
nervous system, several specific brain regions and circuits are crucial in mediating responses 
to stress (Fig. A-E). In the periphery, cellular and humoral factors of the immune system 
(Fig. G, H) and changes in gut microbiota composition (Fig. I) contribute to the development 
of resilience. Recently, the blood-brain barrier has been implicated as an additional factor 
(Fig. F). Importantly, these compartments interact extensively with each other.
