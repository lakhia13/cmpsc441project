Editorial on the Research Topic

The representation of psychiatry and mental health in popular culture

Mental illness has a complicated history in popular culture (1). Stories about the
“madman,” whether ﬁctional or real, often unfold in dark, unpredictable, and violent
narratives, contributing to moral panics and cultural paranoia in society (1–4). These
representations profoundly shape the public perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours toward
psychiatry and mental health (1, 5–7). This Research Topic aims to investigate media
representations of mental health through diverse conceptual perspectives and
analytical approaches.

The six articles in this Research Topic covered popular entertainment and prominent
cases across the UK, USA, and Belgium, spanning various media forms like newspapers,
magazines, television series, and video games. Employing social scientiﬁc methods and
critical cultural studies, the authors examined phenomena regarding the creative industry,
mainstream media, and policies directly and indirectly affecting perceptions and treatment
of mental illness. Topics included discrimination and stigma associated with disorders such
as schizophrenia, personality disorders, PTSD, depression, and anxiety, alongside
intersections with racial trauma and socioeconomic disparities, as well as adverse
consequences like imprisonment and suicide.

De Hart et al. examined the news coverage of Belgium’s ﬁrst criminal case since
euthanasia for psychiatric patients became legal. Using both quantitative and qualitative
content analysis, they found predominantly neutral news coverage regardless of ideological
backgrounds and publication platforms, though subtle differences emerged in content
selection and tonality. The end-of-life decision-making of a 38-year-old woman with
borderline personality disorder and/or autism ignited wider legal and ethical debates on
euthanasia for incurable mental illness and unbearable suffering, including the problematic
nature of deﬁning psychiatric suffering.

Cummins critiqued the British news media’s recurrent use of a photograph of
Christopher Clunis, a young Black man with a history of mental illness, following his
conviction of manslaughter of a White stranger at a London train station in 1992. Clunis’
death in February 2021, announced to the public 22 months later, prompted Cummins to
argue how the Clunis image symbolised negative racial stereotypes associated with madness

and mentally ill, contributing to moral panics and representing the
failings of psychiatric policy and community care in the late
20th century.

media representation of psychiatry and mental health, and
vulnerable and marginalised groups worldwide, particularly non-
Western perspectives.

Wang et al. investigated news coverage of the controversial
Netﬂix original series, 13 Reasons Why, upon its Season 1 premiere
in 2017. Their quantitative content analysis of 3,150 sentences
across 97 articles revealed that content directly addressing mental
health themes were more negative than positive, especially concerns
for glamorising teen suicide, the copycat effect, and portraying
adults as inept and uncaring. Despite some praise for raising
awareness of the reality of young people struggling with mental
illness, most failed to comply with the WHO guidelines.

Tenzek et al. studied mental health portrayals in an award-
winning American drama series, This Is Us, focusing on anxiety
storylines of a main character Randall. Their narrative analysis of 38
episodes underscored the importance of chronic care and various
forms of literacy (i.e., English, personal health, and mental health)
for effective depictions of mental
illness. They recommended
mental health professionals to use Randall’s narrative as an
entertainment-education tool to discuss chronic care delivery and
promote literacy.

Quadros et al. analysed the 2024 British Academy Television
Awards (BAFTA) best drama series, Top Boy. Its main character,
Dushane “Top Boy” Hill, runs a gang operation for narcotics
distribution out of a ﬁctional housing estate in the London borough
of Hackney. The authors commended the series for depicting a broad
range of mental health themes, exploring the intersectionality of
syndemics involving racial trauma, social inequities, PTSD, substance
misuse, and gang violence. They highlighted the show’s broad audience
reach and educational potential.

Buday et al. examined 456 best-selling UK-based video games
from 2002 to 2021, revealing mental illness representation in 54
(12%) games, with schizophrenia being the most frequent
condition. Of 57 such portrayals, 43 (75%) were negative, 13
(23%) were neutral, and only one was positive. Furthermore, only
13 (3%) games included any form of psychiatric or psychological
intervention, and sadly no positive portrayals were found. The
authors emphasized the overlooked adverse impacts of video games
compared to the ﬁlm industry.

The conceptual arguments and research ﬁndings in this
Research Topic are largely consistent with prior literature and
complementary to recent work in other domains (e.g., 8–10).
Taken together, they remind us that individuals with mental
illness are embedded in communities and systems, and it is the
dynamics across micro-, meso-, and macro-level factors that shape
the suffering and possibilities of positive change (11).

The editorial process of this Research Topic also revealed
research gaps and future opportunities. First, although the
authors shared critical cases on women, youth, and Black
communities living with mental illness in Western societies, there
is a scarcity of rigorous studies at the intersection of popular culture,

Second, while one article explored mental illness representation
in video games, our constantly evolving popular culture provides a
fertile ground for research. Future studies can explore, for example,
music, anime, digital games, AR/VR/XR, social media, AI
applications, and the role of celebrities for public engagement and
health communication (1, 9, 10, 12–15).

Third, while we appreciate the authors’ use of content analysis,
narrative analysis, and critical analysis in this Research Topic,
additional methodologies such as systematic reviews, meta-
analyses, experiments, and computational research can further
enrich our knowledge.

Finally, opportunities abound for empirical examinations to
facilitate positive change in policies and practices across the
journalism, social services, and legal
entertainment industry,
systems. The stories we tell can shape who we are. By focusing on
counter narratives and effective solutions, we can transcend
dichotomies of we vs. them, individual vs. collective, biomedical
vs. humanistic, and factual vs. ﬁctional storytelling.
