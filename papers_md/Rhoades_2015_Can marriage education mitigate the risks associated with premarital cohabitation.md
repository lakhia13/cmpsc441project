Abstract

This study tested whether relationship education (i.e., the Prevention and Relationship Education 
Program; PREP) can mitigate the risk of having cohabited before making a mutual commitment to 
marry (i.e., “pre-commitment cohabitation”) for marital distress and divorce. Using data from a 
study of PREP for married couples in the U.S. Army (N = 662 couples), we found that there was a 
significant association between pre-commitment cohabitation and lower marital satisfaction and 
dedication before random-assignment to intervention. After intervention, this pre-commitment 
cohabitation effect was only apparent in the control group. Specifically, significant interactions 
between intervention condition and cohabitation history indicated that for the control group, but 
not the PREP group, pre-commitment cohabitation was associated with lower dedication as well 
as declines in marital satisfaction and increases in negative communication over time. Further, 
those with pre-commitment cohabitation were more likely to divorce by the two-year follow up 
only in the control group; there were no differences in divorce based on premarital cohabitation 
history in the PREP group. These findings are discussed in light of current research on 
cohabitation and relationship education; potential implications are also considered.

There is evidence that premarital cohabitation is associated with risk for divorce and marital 
distress (for meta analyses, see Jose, O’Leary, & Moyer, 2010), particularly among those 
who cohabited before having made a mutual commitment to marriage (Kline et al., 2004; 
Manning & Cohen, 2012; Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009; Stanley, Rhoades, Amato, 
Markman, & Johnson, 2010). This study tests whether receiving marriage education can

mitigate the risk associated with cohabiting before a specific mutual commitment to 
marriage (i.e., “pre-commitment cohabitation”).

The inertia theory (Stanley, Rhoades, & Markman, 2006) suggests that one reason why pre-
commitment cohabitation is associated with poorer marital outcomes is that cohabitation 
makes it harder to end a relationship and therefore increases the likelihood that a poorer 
quality and less committed relationship may progress into marriage. We would expect that 
those who cohabit only after having made a mutual commitment to marry would be less 
likely to be subject to the potential “inertia” living together may create. Most research that 
has examined the distinction between cohabiting before versus after having made a mutual 
commitment to marriage has found that pre-commitment cohabitation is associated with a 
higher risk for divorce (Manning & Cohen, 2012; Stanley, Rhoades, et al., 2010) as well as 
lower marital satisfaction, lower dedication, poorer communication, and more aggression 
compared to cohabiting only after a commitment to marriage or not at all before marriage 
(Kline et al., 2004; Rhoades et al., 2009; Stanley, Rhoades, et al., 2010).

These types of relationship dynamics and problems are often targeted in couple-based 
relationship education (Markman & Rhoades, 2012). The Prevention and Relationship 
Education Program (PREP; Markman, Stanley, & Blumberg, 2010), for example, teaches 
couples skills and principles associated with happy, healthy relationships and includes ways 
to communicate and handle conflict well and a focus on the importance of commitment in 
marriage and ways to preserve and enhance it. We believe that by targeting communication 
and commitment directly, PREP may reduce the link between pre-commitment cohabitation 
and poor marital outcomes. Although changes in commitment have rarely been examined, 
meta-analyses indicate that relationship education programs are generally effective at 
improving communication (Blanchard, Hawkins, Baldwin, & Fawcett, 2009). With regard to 
PREP in particular, many studies indicate its effectiveness in improving communication 
quality compared to no treatment or treatment-as-usual (Laurenceau, Stanley, Olmos-Gallo, 
Baucom, & Markman, 2004; Markman, Renick, Floyd, Stanley, & Clements, 1993; Stanley 
et al., 2001).

There is also evidence that relationship education programs like PREP may be most 
effective for couples who are considered “high risk” for marital distress or divorce. For 
example, couples with certain characteristics (e.g., parental divorce, those with children 
from prior relationships) tend to show greater improvements than those without these risk 
factors (e.g., Amato, 2014; Halford, Sanders, & Behrens, 2001; Petch, Halford, Creedy, & 
Gamble, 2012).

Based on this prior work on premarital cohabitation and relationship education, we 
hypothesized that PREP would mitigate the risk for divorce and marital distress for those 
who cohabited before having made a mutual commitment to marry. Specifically, our first 
hypothesis was that at the first assessment (before random assignment to the intervention or 
control group), married couples with a history of pre-commitment cohabitation would show 
“a pre-commitment cohabitation effect”; that is, they would have lower marital satisfaction, 
lower dedication, and more negative communication than those who cohabited only after 
clarifying a commitment to marriage or who did not cohabit at all before marriage. Second,

we hypothesized that there would be an interaction between intervention status and 
cohabitation history such that the pre-commitment cohabitation effect would be apparent 
only in the control group after intervention and not in the PREP group. Third, we 
hypothesized that pre-commitment cohabitation would be associated with a higher risk for 
divorce in the control group, but not in the PREP group.

We tested these hypotheses using a sample of U.S. Army couples who were randomly 
assigned to PREP or to a no-treatment condition. Prior publications with this sample have 
demonstrated that PREP is associated with increases in some aspects of marital quality in 
the short-term (Allen, Stanley, Rhoades, Markman, & Loew, 2011) and with a decreased 
risk for divorce up to two years post intervention (Stanley et al., 2014).

If receiving relationship education can mitigate the risk of pre-commitment cohabitation, 
there may be policy and practice implications, as well as implications for whether social 
scientists consider premarital cohabitation to be a static or dynamic risk factor for poor 
marital outcomes. Because cohabitation obviously occurs before marriage, practitioners and 
policy makers concerned with improving marital quality and stability may consider it an 
unchangeable or static risk. Although it is true that we cannot change the past, 
demonstrating that relationship education can alter the dynamics associated with pre-
commitment cohabitation is important because it may suggest options for intervention that 
may not have been considered before.

Method

Participants

This sample included 662 Army couples. The average age at the baseline (pre-random 
assignment) assessment was 28.5 years (SD = 5.9) for husbands and 27.7 years (SD = 6.2) 
for wives. Wives were 71% White (non-Hispanic/Latina), 11% Hispanic/Latina, 10% 
African American, 2% Native American/Alaska Native, 1% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 
and 1% Asian; 5% endorsed mixed race/ethnicity. Husbands were 69% White (non-
Hispanic/Latino), 12% Hispanic/Latino, 11% African American, 1% Native American/
Alaska Native, 1% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 1% Asian; 5% endorsed mixed race/
ethnicity. Almost all husbands (97.4%) were Active Duty Army (2.3% were in the study due 
to their wives being Active Duty), whereas almost all wives (91.7%) were civilian spouses 
of Active Duty husbands (8.0% of wives were Active Duty Army or Reserves). Husbands’ 
median income was between $30,000 and $39,999 a year; wives’ median income was under 
$10,000 a year. High school or an equivalency degree was the median highest degree 
(endorsed by 69% of husbands and 55% of wives). At the baseline assessment, couples had 
been married an average of 4.9 years, and 74% reported at least one child living with them at 
least part-time.

Procedures

Complete details of the procedures for the test of the interventions are available in prior 
publications (e.g., Stanley, Allen, Markman, Rhoades, & Prentice, 2010); an overview is 
provided here. Two sites were used: Site 1 included 478 couples and Site 2 included 184

couples. Although there were some socio-demographic differences between the sites (i.e., on 
length of marriage, age, rank, income, and deployment history), there were no significant 
differences between the sites on indices of marital quality at the baseline assessment (Allen 
et al., 2011).

To be eligible for the study, couples had to be married, with both partners age 18 or over, 
fluent in English, and with at least one active-duty spouse in the Army. Couples could not 
have already participated in PREP and had to be willing to be randomly assigned to either 
the intervention or the no-treatment control group, which can be considered treatment-as-
usual. Recruitment was conducted via brochures, media stories, posters, and referrals from 
chaplains. All procedures were approved by a university Institutional Review Board.

Prior to random assignment, spouses completed the baseline questionnaires separately 
(“pre”); 343 couples were then randomly assigned to the intervention and 319 were assigned 
to the control group (see CONSORT table). As described by Stanley et al. (2014), there 
were 53 cohorts randomly assigned and 27 iterations of the intervention. After each 
iteration’s intervention was complete, spouses completed another set of measures separately 
(“post”). Approximately every six months after post, participants whose marriages remained 
intact completed online measures. These follow-up assessments took approximately one 
hour to complete and each spouse was paid $50 to $70 depending on the time point. The 
current analyses are based on a subset of measures collected at pre and post and the 
subsequent four follow-up assessments. The fourth follow-up assessment was completed 
two years after post.

Intervention and Attendance

The intervention was a version of PREP (Markman et al., 2010) adapted for Army couples 
and delivered by Army chaplains to groups of Army couples in a workshop format (Stanley, 
Markman, Jenkins, & Blumberg, 2006). The workshop consisted of two parts: a one-day on-
post training followed by a weekend retreat at an off-post hotel, totaling approximately 14.4 
hours of training. Intervention modules included communication and problem solving skills 
training, negative affect management, insights into relationship dynamics, emotional 
support, stress and relaxation, principles of commitment, fun and friendship, forgiveness, 
sensuality and sexuality, expectations, core beliefs, and deployment/reintegration issues.

All analyses use an intent-to-treat design. That is, those assigned to the intervention group 
are analyzed as part of that group regardless of whether couples attended the workshops. At 
Site 1, 60% attended all, 23% attended part (e.g., either the duty day of training or the 
weekend retreat, but not both), and 17% attended none of the intervention. At Site 2, 54% 
attended all, 35% attended part, and 11% attended none of the intervention. Two couples 
assigned to the control group attended the intervention at Site 1.

Measures

Premarital cohabitation history—At pre, all participants were asked “Did you live 
together (that is, share the same address) before you got married?” and “If yes, had the two 
of you already made a specific commitment to marry when you first began living together?”

Partners who agreed that they had not cohabited before marriage or who said that they had 
made a specific commitment to marry when first living together were coded 1 for having 
made a mutual commitment to marry before cohabiting (58.6%). Those who agreed that they 
had not made a specific commitment to marry when they began living together or who gave 
discrepant answers were coded 0 for not having made a mutual commitment to marry before 
cohabiting (41.4%; “pre-commitment cohabitation”).

Marital satisfaction—The Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale (Schumm et al., 1986) was 
used to measure marital satisfaction at all waves. It includes three items rated on a 1 to 7 
scale and has strong reliability and validity (Schumm et al., 1986). At pre, the average score 
was 5.67 (SD = 1.27); internal consistency (α) was .94.

Dedication—Dedication was assessed with 5 items from the Dedication subscale of the 
Revised Commitment Inventory, a measure shown to be reliable and valid (Owen, Rhoades, 
Stanley, & Markman, 2011; Stanley & Markman, 1992), including in brief form (Cui & 
Fincham, 2010; Rhoades et al., 2009). Each item such as “My relationship with my spouse is 
more important to me than almost anything else in my life” was rated on a 1 to 7 scale. At 
pre, the average score was 6.57 (SD = 0.68); α was .84.

Negative communication—Negative communication was assessed with 4 items from 
the Communication Danger Signs Scale (Stanley & Markman, 1997). Short forms of this 
scale have been shown to be reliable and valid in other research (e.g., Allen et al., 2011; 
Rhoades et al., 2009). Each item (e.g., “My spouse criticizes or belittles my opinions, 
feelings, or desires”) was rated on a 1 to 3 scale. At the pre-intervention assessment, 
participants’ average score was 1.92 (SD = 0.53); α was .76.

Divorce—A couple was considered divorced if either spouse reported that they had 
obtained or filed for a divorce as of the two-year follow-up assessment. At Site 1, there were 
54 divorces (11.3%) and 2 couples with missing data on divorce; one participant died (not 
combat-related) prior to the two-year time point and we could not ascertain divorce status at 
two years post-intervention for the other couple. At Site 2, there were 10 divorces (5.4%) 
and no missing data.

To test the first hypothesis that those who did not have a mutual commitment to marry when 
they moved in together would have lower marital satisfaction, lower dedication, and more 
negative communication at pre than those with a mutual commitment, we ran 2 X 2 
ANOVAs in which gender was a within-subject variable (i.e., the couple was the unit of 
analysis) and pre-commitment cohabitation history was a between-subjects variable (see 
Table 1). There were three outcome variables: marital satisfaction, dedication, and negative 
communication. (These measures were correlated |.36 | to |.61| with one another, M = |.52|.) 
There were no significant main effects of gender, nor any significant gender X pre-
commitment cohabitation history interactions in any of these three ANOVAs. As 
hypothesized, for marital satisfaction and dedication, there were significant main effects of 
cohabitation history with those who had cohabited before a mutual commitment to marriage

reporting lower marital satisfaction and lower dedication than those who cohabited only 
after marriage/after a specific mutual commitment to marriage at pre. The sizes of these 
differences were small. Contrary to our first hypothesis, there was not a significant main 
effect of pre-commitment cohabitation history for negative communication at pre. We also 
tested whether there were any group (PREP vs. control)×cohabitation history interactions at 
the pre-intervention assessment by including group as a factor in additional repeated-
measures ANOVAs. There were no significant group X cohabitation history interactions for 
any of the dependent variables at pre (marital satisfaction: F(1, 653) = 0.06, p = .81, 
dedication: F(1, 650) = 0.13, p = .72, negative communication: F(1, 653) = 0.95, p = .33).

The next hypothesis was that the pre-commitment cohabitation effect would be apparent 
only in the control group after the intervention phase of the project (see Table 2 for results). 
We tested for differences in terms of both level (i.e., the intercept) and the slope (i.e., 
changes over time in the dependent variable), using 4-level multilevel models and HLM 7.0 
software (Raudenbush, Bryk, Fai, Congdon, & du Toit, 2011). This approach accounted for 
the nested nature of these data, as time was nested within individuals who were nested 
within couples who were nested within cohorts. The equation below demonstrates the 
analyses that were conducted separately for marital satisfaction, dedication, and negative 
communication. Pre levels of the dependent variable were controlled for and Time was 
measured in months since post and grand-mean centered so that it could be interpreted as the 
estimated level of the dependent variable at the mean number months of follow-up since 
post. The Cohabitation History and Intervention Group variables were also grand-mean 
centered to be consistent. For tests of key interactions (i.e., Cohabitation History X 
Intervention Group), we used one-tailed tests, as they were hypothesized and because 
interactions tend to be underpowered (McClelland & Judd, 1993). For all other analyses, we 
used two-tailed tests. We calculated effect sizes using: r = √[t2/(t2 + df)].1

Level-1 (Time):

Marital Satisfactiontijk = π0ijk + π1ijk(Timetijk) + etijk

Level-2 (Individual):

π0ijk = β00jk + β01jk(Pre Satisfactionjk) + r0ijk

π1ijk = β10ijk + β11ijk(Pre Satisfactionjk)

Level-3 (Couple):

β00jk = γ000k + γ001k(Cohabitation History) + u00j

β01jk = γ010k

β10jk = γ100k + γ101k(Cohabitation History)

β11jk = γ110k

Level-4 (Cohort):

γ000k = δ0000 + δ0001(Intervention Groupk) + v000k

γ001k = δ0010 + δ0011(Intervention Groupk)

γ010k = δ0100

γ100k = δ1000 + δ1001(Intervention Groupk)

1We did not have any hypotheses about gender differences, given that the broader literature has identified few gender differences in 
the way cohabitation is associated with marital quality/divorce or in how relationship education impacts relationship outcomes. 
Nevertheless, we tested whether Gender X Cohabitation History X Intervention Group interactions were significant for the intercepts 
(i.e., levels of satisfaction, dedication, or negative communication) or slopes (i.e., change over time in the above variables). There 
were no significant Gender X Cohabitation History X Intervention Group interactions, so we elected not to include gender as a factor 
in the analyses presented.

In support of the second hypothesis, the Cohabitation History X Intervention Group 
interaction was significant for the intercept for dedication. An analysis of simple effects 
indicated that for those in the control group, pre-commitment cohabitation was associated 
with lower estimated dedication at the midpoint of the two years following intervention (b = 
-0.18, p < .01, r = .14), but that there was no difference in dedication based on cohabitation 
history for those in the PREP group (b = 0.01, p = .80, r < .01). There was not a significant 
Cohabitation History X Intervention Group interaction for the slope of dedication.

There was not a significant Cohabitation History X Intervention Group interaction for the 
intercept for marital satisfaction, but there was a significant interaction effect for the slope. 
An analysis of simple effects indicated that for those in the control group, marital 
satisfaction declined more across the two years following post for those who cohabited 
before a mutual commitment to marry compared to those who did not (b = −0.012, p < .01, r 
= .19), but there was no such difference for those in the PREP group (b = −0.002, p = .72, r 
= .02).

There was not a significant Cohabitation History X Intervention Group interaction for the 
intercept for negative communication, but there was a significant interaction effect for the 
slope. An analysis of simple effects indicated that for those in the control group, negative 
communication increased more for those who cohabited before a mutual commitment to 
marry compared to those who did not (b = −0.005, p < .01, r = .18), but there was no such 
difference for those in the PREP group (b = -0.002, p = .32, r = .06).

Our third hypothesis was that having cohabited before a mutual commitment to marry would 
be associated with divorce in the control group, but not in the PREP group, and it was 
supported. A significant chi-square test in the control group showed that 18 out of 123 
(14.6%) of those who cohabited before a mutual commitment to marry filed for divorce 
compared to 14 out of 186 (7.5%) of those who did not, χ2 (1, N = 309) = 4.03, p < .05. For 
the PREP group, there was not a significant difference in divorce by cohabitation history, 
with 11 out of 141 (7.8%) of those who cohabited before a mutual commitment to marry 
having filed for divorce compared to 14 out of 188 (7.4%) of those who did not, χ2 (1, N = 
329) = 0.02, p = .90.

Discussion

The results of this study supported our general hypothesis that PREP would mitigate the risk 
of having cohabited before making a mutual commitment to marriage. We examined marital 
satisfaction, dedication, and negative communication as indices of marital quality. On two of 
the three indices, we found small, but significant differences before random assignment 
(which was about five years into marriage, on average) between those who had cohabited 
before a mutual commitment to marry and those who had not, supporting prior research that 
this specific type of premarital cohabitation is associated with marital distress and divorce

(e.g., Rhoades et al., 2009; Stanley, Rhoades, et al., 2010). After the intervention phase of 
the study was complete, this cohabitation effect was only apparent in the control group and 
not in the PREP group. In the control group, there were differences in average levels of 
dedication based on cohabitation history and there was evidence that those who cohabited 
before a mutual commitment were declining more in marital satisfaction and increasing 
more in negative communication over the two-year period than those who cohabited only 
after a mutual commitment to marry. These findings may reflect that among those who 
cohabited before a mutual commitment to marry, PREP had a more immediate impact on 
dedication and a longer-term impact on satisfaction and negative communication. Further, 
two years after the intervention, there was an association between having cohabited before a 
mutual commitment to marriage and divorce in the control group, but not in the PREP 
group. Specifically, couples in the control group who cohabited before a mutual 
commitment to marry were twice as likely to divorce compared to those who cohabited only 
after a mutual commitment to marriage.

The association between having pre-commitment cohabitation history and marital quality 
are small, which is consistent with other work that examined couples several years into 
marriage (Rhoades et al., 2009). Some of the couples most at risk for lower marital quality 
likely divorced earlier on and therefore are not included in the marital quality analyses (for a 
discussion of this methodological challenge, see McConnell, Stuart, & Devaney, 2008).

Even though the effects are small, that we find these effects on more than one index of 
marital quality and on divorce is important. We chose variables that have been theorized and 
shown to be related to premarital cohabitation history in previous research (Kline et al., 
2004; Stanley, Rhoades, et al., 2006; Stanley, Whitton, & Markman, 2004), and these 
findings demonstrate that relationship education may be particularly beneficial to couples 
who cohabited before they were committed to marriage in terms of their marital satisfaction, 
communication, dedication, and their risk for divorce. They add to a growing literature on 
different risk factors that may be associated with greater gains in prevention services (e.g., 
Allen, Rhoades, Stanley, Loew, & Markman, 2012; Amato, 2014; Halford & Bodenmann, 
2013; Halford et al., 2001; Petch et al., 2012). If these kinds of findings were replicated in 
future work, they could be good news to couples who have what appear to be static risk 
factors for marital distress or divorce, as they suggest that relationship education may reduce 
such risks. In fact, static risk factors might be better thought of as inertial risk factors, as 
their sequelae are not impossible to change. That is, static factors seem to set in motion 
dynamics that may be ameliorated by intervention.

Limitations and Conclusion

This study’s findings should be considered in light of several limitations. First, premarital 
cohabitation history was measured after marriage and, for some, long after they began 
cohabiting. There were some discrepancies between partners’ reports of their cohabitation 
histories and future research could improve measurement of cohabitation history by using an 
interview with both partners together and/or by documenting cohabitation at the time it 
happens. Second, couples had been married five years, on average, when they started this 
study, and this characteristic of the sample reflects a selection effect in that some of the

couples most at risk for divorce would not have qualified for the study because they had 
already divorced. Future research should test these associations with a sample of more 
recently married couples as well as with a longer time horizon for measuring divorce. Third, 
this sample included only couples who were part of the U.S. Army. We cannot know if the 
findings generalize to civilian couples, as reasons for cohabitation and marriage may be 
different across civilian and military contexts.

Notwithstanding these limitations, this study contributes new knowledge to both research on 
premarital cohabitation as well as research on relationship education for couples. The 
findings support the idea that relationship education curricula like PREP can mitigate the 
association between cohabitation before a commitment to marry and later marital distress 
and divorce.
