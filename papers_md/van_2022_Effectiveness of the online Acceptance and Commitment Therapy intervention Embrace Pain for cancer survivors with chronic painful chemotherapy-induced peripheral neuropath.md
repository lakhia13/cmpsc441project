Abstract 
Background:  About 30% of cancer survivors suffer from chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) 
months after completion of chemotherapy. This condition, for which treatment options are scarce, comes with limita-
tions in daily life functioning and decreased quality of life. The current study examines the effectiveness of an online 
self-help intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in comparison to a waiting list condition 
(WLC) to deal with CIPN. In addition, it examines which factors moderate effects and to what extent the effects differ 
between guided and unguided ACT intervention.

who experience painful CIPN for at least 3 months and completed chemotherapy at least 6 months ago will be 
recruited (n

text and experiential exercises, supplemented with illustrations, metaphors, and audio files, people will learn to carry 
out value-oriented activities in their daily life with pain. Participants will learn new ways of coping with pain, including 
reducing pain avoidance and increasing pain acceptance. Participants in the WLC will be invited to follow the inter-
vention without therapeutic guidance 5 months after start. Pain interference is the primary outcome, while psycho-
logical distress, quality of life, CIPN symptom severity, pain intensity, psychological flexibility, mindfulness skills, values-
based living, and pain catastrophizing will serve as secondary outcomes. All outcome measures will be evaluated 
at inclusion and baseline, early-intervention, mid-intervention, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month post-treatment.

Background
The number of cancer survivors continues to grow [1–5] 
as  the  population  ages,  early  detection  through  screen-
ing  rises,  and  cancer  survival  rates  improve  [6].  Many 
of  these  survivors  face  long-term  side  effects  of  cancer 
and  its  treatment,  whereby  their  quality  of  life  (QoL)  is 
strongly  affected  [1,  7].  Chemotherapy  can  cause  multi-
ple  disabling  long-term  side  effects  like  chemotherapy-
induced  peripheral  neuropathy  (CIPN)  [8].  CIPN  can 
occur due to the use of certain chemotherapeutic agents, 
such  as  taxanes,  platinum  compounds,  and  vinca  alka-
loids  [9].  CIPN  presents  itself  with  symptoms  such  as 
tingling, numbness, cramps, and aching or burning pain 
in the hands and feet, which can also spread to arms and 
legs [10–12]. Up to 80% of cancer survivors suffers from 
CIPN  1  month  after  chemotherapy,  which  stabilizes  to 
around 30% at 6 months or longer after chemotherapy [7, 
8,  13–16].  This  prevalence  differs  between  cancer  types 
(range  10–60%).  As  the  application  of  chemotherapy  in 
cancer treatment is rising, CIPN is likely to become one 
of  the  most  common  long-term  side  effects  for  cancer 
survivors  [17].  CIPN  is  a  very  limiting  condition,  as  a 
systematic review has shown that CIPN negatively influ-
ences  QoL  in  adult  cancer  survivors  [7].  Patients  can 
experience  impaired  QoL  due  to  CIPN  up  to  11  years 
after  chemotherapy,  caused  by  the  decreased  perfor-
mance  of  regular  activities,  depressive  symptoms,  and 
poor sleep quality [18–21]. In addition, it has been shown 
that  specifically  painful  CIPN  is  associated  with  lower 
QoL compared to non-painful CIPN [22].

In order to improve the patients’ QoL, cognitive behav-
ioral  therapies  (CBT),  like  third-generation  CBTs  as 
Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), are increas-
ingly  used  in  global  cancer  care  [23,  24].  ACT  helps 
patients  to  shift  focus  towards  engaging  in  personally 
valuable activities by increasing pain acceptance [25] and 
has been shown to be effective for other types of chronic 
pain  [26].  Although  the  effectiveness  of  online  ACT 
interventions  has  not  yet  been  investigated  for  chronic 
painful CIPN patients, a previous study found that treat-
ment  with  online  CBT  positively  affected  pain  intensity 
in  this  patient  group,  creating  positive  expectations  for 

treatment with online ACT as well [27]. Traditional face-
to-face  psychological  therapies  have  some  drawbacks, 
such as high costs, not being accessible or hardly availa-
ble, having to travel to the therapist, negative stigma, and 
high psychological burden [27, 28]. Due to developments 
in  the  field  of  eHealth,  these  obstacles  can  be  mitigated 
[27–29]. That is, with the use of online self-management 
interventions,  patients  are  able  to  receive  psychological 
therapy whenever and wherever they would like to, with-
out  having  to  travel  to  a  therapist  [27,  28].  Online  self-
management interventions offer the additional benefit of 
augmented protection of patients’ anonymity and privacy 
[29].

Even though online interventions are relatively new, 
several such interventions have demonstrable effectiv-
ity in improving QoL in cancer patients and survivors 
[28,  30–32].  A  randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT)  has 
shown that the use of an online CBT intervention sig-
nificantly  improved  CIPN  pain  intensity  and  may  be 
effective  [27].  Furthermore,  research  has  shown  that 
online  interventions  based  on  ACT  are  capable  of 
improving  pain  intensity,  pain  interference,  pain  cata-
strophizing,  disability,  depression,  anxiety,  psycho-
logical  inflexibility,  and  QoL  in  chronic  pain  patients 
with  a  variety  of  pain  diagnoses  (e.g.,  fibromyalgia, 
rheumatoid  arthritis,  and  back  complaints)  [33,  34]. 
These  findings  suggest  that  an  online  self-help  inter-
vention  based  on  ACT  might  be  effective  for  adult 
cancer  survivors  with  chronic  painful  CIPN  as  well. 
However,  effects  may  differ  between  patients,  since 
previous  research  has  shown  factors  such  as  pain 
intensity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and emo-
tional well-being to predict the effectiveness of online 
ACT  for  chronic  pain  [35],  and  the  extent  to  which 
patients  benefit  from  the  online  intervention  may 
hence vary. Furthermore, there may also be differences 
in  the  effectiveness  with  different  types  of  the  online 
intervention, namely with or without guidance. Earlier 
research has shown that guidance, including feedback, 
explanations,  motivations  and  reminders,  improves 
treatment effects compared to unguided interventions 
[36, 37]. The primary aim of this study researching the

online intervention named ‘Embrace Pain’ is to reduce 
pain  interference  in  cancer  survivors  with  chronic 
painful CIPN. To study this, three objectives have been 
formulated:

Objective 1: To examine the effectiveness of an online 
self-help  intervention  based  on  ACT  for  reducing 
pain  interference  in  cancer  survivors  with  chronic 
painful CIPN in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
and compare this to a waiting list condition (WLC).
Objective  2:  To  examine  which  baseline  demo-
graphic, clinical, and psychosocial factors may mod-
erate  the  effectiveness  of  an  online  self-help  inter-
vention based on ACT.
Objective  3:  To  examine  the  extent  to  which  effects 
differ  between  guided  and  unguided  versions  of  the 
online self-help intervention based on ACT.

Methods
Study design

An  RCT  will  be  carried  out  with  two  parallel,  non-
blinded groups. Participants will be involved in the study 
for a duration of 8 months from the first to the last meas-
urement.  Outcome  measures  will  be  collected  at  base-
line (T0), early-intervention (T1; 3 weeks after baseline), 
mid-intervention  (T2;  6  weeks  after  baseline),  directly 
at the end of intervention (T3; 2 months after baseline), 
and through two follow-up measurements (T4; 3 months 
after  the  intervention,  T5;  6  months  after  intervention). 
A flowchart of the study is shown in Fig. 1.

Study population

Inclusion  criteria  consist  of  (a)  age  of  18  years  or  older 
and  (b)  identified  by  a  clinician  or  self  as  having  pain-
ful  sensations  (i.e.,  aching,  burning,  “pins-and-nee-
dles”,  shock-like,  painful  tingling,  numbness,  cramps)

bilaterally in the feet/legs and/or hands/arms for at least 
3 months. Furthermore, (c) a score of 3 or higher on an 
11-point  pain  intensity  scale  (Numeric  Rating  Scale), 
(d)  the  pain  was  not  present  prior  to  receiving  chemo-
therapy,  (e)  chemotherapy  ended  at  least  6  months  ago, 
and (f ) a score of 1 or higher on EORTC QLQ–CIPN20. 
Exclusion  criteria  are  (a)  enrollment  in  psychological 
treatment related to cancer, pain, or psychological disor-
ders upon entry; (b) new chemotherapy scheduled during 
study participation; (c) no access to the Internet/no email 
address; (d) not enough time to follow the intervention (2 
h  per  week);  and  (e)  according  to  patient’s  own  percep-
tion no problems with the Dutch language.

Recruitment

Patients will be recruited through a flyer with a QR code 
and  a  link  to  a  website.  These  flyers  will  be  distributed 
in various ways (in the Netherlands): online media (e.g., 
Kanker.nl, Facebook groups for neuropathy, patient asso-
ciations),  hospital  waiting  rooms  (e.g.,  oncology  depart-
ments,  AYA  centers,  pain  clinics),  and  through  other 
healthcare  providers  (e.g.,  oncological  foot  care  provid-
ers).  Interested  patients  can  visit  the  recruitment  web-
site where they can read more information and sign up if 
interested.

When  a  patient  is  interested  in  participation,  the 
patient will receive an information letter and an informed 
consent  form  by  mail,  sent  by  a  research  assistant.  The 
informed  consent  also  includes  information  regarding 
the  collection  and  use  of  participant  data  in  follow-up 
studies.  Afterwards,  the  participant  will  receive  a  ques-
tionnaire  (T0a)  regarding  inclusion  criteria,  to  examine 
whether  the  participant  is  eligible  to  participate.  Addi-
tionally,  patients  must  achieve  certain  scores  on  several 
questionnaires,  namely  Numeric  Rating  Scale  ≥2  and 
EORTC QLQ–CIPN20 ≥1. If the questionnaire from T0a 
shows that respondents are not suitable for participation, 
they will be notified with a rejection and along with it the 
reason  for  rejection  based  on  the  relevant  inclusion  or 
exclusion criterion.

Randomization

When the patient is admitted to the study, the patient will 
receive confirmation of participation, the result of rand-
omization, and the baseline questionnaire (T0b). Patients 
will  be  randomized  to  receive  either  ACT  or WLC. The 
study will stratify by age and sex by means of block-wise 
randomization. An online generator will be used for this. 
Randomization will be performed by a research associate.

Intervention

The  experimental  condition  includes  an  online  psycho-
logical intervention with therapist email guidance based 

on ACT. The intervention can be worked through by the 
patient from home or at another location of choice, in a 
webpage or app by logging in with an email and self-cre-
ated password. Participants receive a welcome letter from 
the  supervisor.  It  consists  of  6  modules  which  can  be 
worked  through  in  8  weeks.  The  intervention  primarily 
consists of text and experiential exercises, complemented 
with  illustrations,  metaphors,  and  audio  (mp3)  files. 
Before  starting  the  module,  participants  read  an  intro-
duction about the training. The first module includes psy-
choeducation  on  neuropathic  pain  and  CIPN  (Table  1). 
Participants  will  be  provided  with  information  to  famil-
iarize  themselves  with  intervention  goals  and  mindful-
ness  exercises  central  to  ACT.  In  subsequent  modules, 
participants  will  learn  about  the  aversive  effects  of  pain 
avoidance,  gain  insight  into  their  personal  values,  and 
work  on  pain  acceptance.  Throughout  the  intervention, 
participants will exercise to recognize unhelpful thoughts 
about  their  pain  and  learn  the  difference  between  the 
subjective  (judging)  and  objective  self,  create  activities 
that  align  with  values,  and  think  about  concrete  actions 
to  prevent  relapse.  When  access  to  the  online  environ-
ment  is  terminated,  participants  can  no  longer  view  the 
online environment or communicate with the supervisor. 
However,  participants  can  always  continue  to  view  the 
session they submitted.

Participants in the experimental condition will receive 
guidance  from  Psychology  master’s  students  from  Til-
burg University, who will be first trained and then super-
vised  by  a  licensed  healthcare  psychologist.  In  addition, 
they  receive  supervision  in  the  first  weeks  of  providing 
guidance.  Also,  they  will  always  have  the  possibility  to 
ask for advice from a licensed clinical psychologist during 
the  intervention.  There  will  also  be  a  backup  in  case  of 
possible  psychological  problems  that  require  more  help. 
In  that  case,  the  licensed  clinical  psychologist  will  be 
informed and asked for advice. Guidance of participants 
will occur via email. Contact will be without obligation. It 
is possible to send an email every week in the protected 
environment  of  the  online  intervention,  which  complies 
with all privacy conditions as stated by the GDPR. Guid-
ance is mainly intended for feedback related to the exer-
cises  made,  answering  questions  about  the  content,  and 
maintaining  motivation  to  continue  with  the  interven-
tion. Here the choice lies with the participant, but facili-
tators  will  continue  to  encourage  questions  throughout 
the training.

Waiting list condition

The control condition includes a WLC. At 5 months after 
start (i.e., T4) participants in the WLC receive the oppor-
tunity to follow the intervention without email guidance 
by  a  therapist.  They  neither  receive  a  welcome  letter  at

Outcomes

Questionnaires  will  be  completed  online  via  the  PRO-
FILES  Registry  [38].  Patients  will  receive  reminders  via 
email  to  promote  participant  retention  and  complete 
follow-up. A complete overview of enrolment, interven-
tions, and outcome measurements is shown in Table 2.

Primary outcome

Pain  interference  will  be  measured  using  the  Multidi-
mensional Pain Inventory, Dutch language version (MPI-
DLV) – subscale Interference [39, 40]. The MPI consists 
of  statements  rated  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale  ranging 
from  0  (no  change)  to  6  (a  lot  of  change).  The  subscale 
Interference  focuses  on  psychosocial  aspects  of  chronic 
pain, such as functioning in work, homework, and recre-
ational and social activities. The scale consists of 11 items 
and has been translated/validated into Dutch [39].

Secondary outcomes

Quality  of  life  will  be  measured  with  the  European 
Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer 
Quality  of  Life  Questionnaires  Core-30  item  (EORTC 
QLQ-C30)  [41].  This  is  a  validated  30-item  self-report 
screening  scale  for  QoL  in  cancer  patients  including 
a  4-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  1  (not  at  all)  to  4 
(very much) including five subscales (i.e., physical func-
tioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cogni-
tive functioning, and social functioning) [41].

CIPN  symptom  severity  will  be  measured  using  the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN20 (EORTC 
QLQ–CIPN20)  [42].  This  questionnaire  is  intended  to 
be  used  as  a  supplement  to  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30.  It 
assesses  CIPN-related  symptoms  as  well  as  functional 
limitations  related  to  CIPN.  The  questionnaire  has 
been validated and includes 20 items on a 4-point Lik-
ert  scale  ranging  from  1  (not  at  all)  to  4  (very  much) 
including  three  subscales  (i.e.,  sensory,  motor,  and 
autonomic symptoms) [43].

Pain intensity will be measured with the Numeric Rat-
ing  Scale  (NRS-11)  [44].  This  is  based  on  International 
Association  for  the  Study  of  Pain  (IASP)  recommenda-
tions for measures in clinical trials on chronic pain [44]. 
This  questionnaire  has  been  validated  and  includes  2 
items on a 11-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no pain) 
to 10 (the worst pain possible) [45].

Psychological distress will be measured using the Hos-
pital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [46, 47]. This 
is based on IASP recommendations for measures in clini-
cal  trials  on  chronic  pain  [44]. The  HADS  is  a  validated 
14-item  self-report  screening  scale  (ranging  from  0  to 
3)  including  two  subscales  (i.e.,  anxiety  and  depression 
symptoms) [46, 47].

Pain  catastrophizing  will  be  measured  using  the  Pain 
Catastrophizing  Scale  (PCS)  [48].  This  questionnaire 
includes three subscales (i.e., rumination, magnification, 
and helplessness). It consists of 13 items on a 5-point Lik-
ert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (always) and has 
been validated [48].

Psychological flexibility will be measured with the Psy-
chological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS) [49, 50]. This 
is  a  validated  12-item  measurement,  including  two  sub-
scales  (i.e.,  avoidance  and  cognitive  fusion)  [51].  It  con-
sists of a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never true) 
to 6 (always true).

Mindfulness will be measured using the Freiburg Mind-
fulness Inventory (FMI) [52]. This validated measurement 
consists of 14 items with two subscales (i.e., presence and 
acceptance) [52]. It includes a 4-point Likert scale, rang-
ing from 0 (rarely) to 3 (almost always).

Values-based living will be measured with the Engaged 
Living Scale (ELS) [53]. This is a validated 16-item meas-
urement,  consisting  of  two  subscales  (i.e.,  valued  living 
and life fulfillment) [53]. It includes a 5-point Likert scale, 
ranging  from  0  (completely  disagree)  to  4  (completely 
agree).

Intervention evaluation

Intervention  evaluation  includes  15  questions  regarding 
the  evaluation  of  the  intervention.  It  includes  questions 
regarding  amount  of  use  and  overall  satisfaction  with 
the content and guidance, which was based on an earlier 
RCT  studying  an  online  ACT  intervention  [33].  Overall 
satisfaction  will  be  measured  using  the  Client  Satisfac-
tion  Questionnaire  (CSQ-8)  [54].  Also,  participants  will 
grade the intervention on a scale from 1 (extremely poor) 
to 10 (excellent).

Process outcomes

Technical data regarding usage of the intervention will be 
gathered, namely moment when session was first viewed, 
moment when session was finished, moment of message 

sent  to  supervisor,  and  moment  of  feedback  given  by 
supervisor.  This  enables  evaluation  of  adherence  to  the 
intervention and information about the use of guidance. 
Once all participants have completed the online training, 
Karify will make this data available. Karify is the eHealth 
platform in which the online intervention was build (ISO 
27001 and NEN 7510 certified).

Other outcomes

Qualitative  data  on  intervention  experiences  and  sat-
isfaction  will  be  collected  by  means  of  interviews  with 
some  participants  after  completion  of  the  intervention. 
In  this  way,  it  will  be  possible  to  examine  experiences, 
usage,  usability,  content  fit  of  intervention  with  com-
plaints,  and  satisfaction.  Specifically,  both  participants 
who adhered and did not adhere to the intervention will 
be  interviewed.  Patients  adhered  to  the  intervention  if 
all sessions were completed (i.e., based on data retrieved 
from Karify) and a minimum of 2 h per week was spent 
on  the  intervention  (i.e.,  self-reported).  Participants 
are  informed  about  this  by  the  information  letter  and 
informed  consent  form.  As  a  starting  point,  4  patients 
in  each  group  (i.e.,  adherent  and  non-adherent)  will  be 
interviewed. New interviews will be done until saturation 
is reached.

Participant characteristics

Socio-demographic  factors  are  assessed,  including  sex, 
marital  status,  having  children,  educational  level,  and 
work.  Clinical  information  will  be  examined  as  well, 
including  year  of  diagnosis,  tumor  type,  other  cancer 
treatments  besides  chemotherapy,  CIPN  characteris-
tics (i.e., days per week, medication used to treat CIPN), 
long-term  consequences  of  cancer  (other  than  CIPN), 
and  psychological  problems.  Comorbidities  in  the  last 
12 months will be examined using the Self-administered 
Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ) [55].

Sample size calculation

Per  group,  51  participants  during  follow-up  measure-
ments  are  necessary  to  detect  minimal  effect  sizes  of 
interest (d = .50) on the primary outcome. This is based 
on  earlier  findings  on  effectiveness  of  online  and  face-
to-face  ACT  intervention  for  chronic  pain  [33,  34].  The 
power  will  be  high  enough  (p  =  1-beta  =  .80)  to  find 
significant  effects  in  a  two-sided  test  at  alpha  =  .05.  As 
found in previous online ACT interventions, a drop-out 
rate of 30% needs to be considered. G*Power calculations 
revealed  that  73  participants  per  group  are  needed  at

Statistical analysis
Primary analyses

Significant differences at baseline between the conditions 
will  be  checked  by  performing  one-way  ANOVA’s  and 
chi-square tests.

Effects  of  the  intervention  on  all  outcomes  will  be 
assessed by performing intention-to-treat analyses using 
general  linear  mixed  models.  Baseline  to  post-interven-
tion  and  3-  and  6-month  follow-up  differences  will  be 
used  as  repeated  measures,  with  treatment  (2  levels), 
time  (3  levels)  and  their  first-order  interactions  as  fixed 
factors.  Confidence  intervals  of  95%  will  be  calculated 
for  all  outcomes.  Drop-out  and  non-adherence  are  rela-
tively  common  in  online  interventions  [56].  Therefore, 
secondary analyses will be performed to examine effects 
on outcome variables for participants who adhered to the 
intervention (i.e., all session completed and self-reported 
minimum  of  2  h  per  week  spent  on  intervention).  At 
post-intervention  and  follow-up,  effect  sizes  (Cohen’s  d) 
will  be  calculated  using  means  and  standard  deviations. 
Effect  sizes  of  0.80  are  considered  large,  effect  sizes  of 
0.50  are  evaluated  as  moderate,  and  effect  sizes  of  0.20 
are considered small [57].

Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assess-
ment  in  Clinical  Trials  (IMMPACT)  recommendations 
will  be  followed  to  evaluate  the  proportion  of  partici-
pants  showing  clinically  significant  change  [58].  Clini-
cal  improvement  will  be  assessed  with  missing  values 
imputed  by  the  Expectation  Maximization-algorithm. 
Proportions of clinically improved participants and Chi-
square tests will assess statistically significant differences 
in the proportions for the two conditions. It will be cal-
culated  for  (a)  pain  interference  (MPI  –  Interference), 
(b)  pain  intensity  (NRS),  and  (c)  CIPN  symptom  sever-
ity (EORTC QLQ – CIPN 20). A decrease of at least 0.6 
standard  deviation  will  be  assessed  as  evidence  of  clini-
cally significant change for the MPI – Interference scale, 
based  on  the  IMMPACT  guidelines  [58].  Decreases  of 
20% or higher in pain intensity (NRS) will be assessed as 
minimum and moderate changes. No specific IMMPACT 
guidelines exist for the HADS. Therefore, a distribution-
based decrease of at least 1 standard error of the mean is 
recommended [58].

time since CIPN onset, CIPN symptom severity (EORTC 
QLQ – CIPN20), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), pain 
intensity  (NRS),  psychological  distress  (HADS),  psycho-
logical  inflexibility  (PIPS),  mindfulness  (FMI-NL),  val-
ued  based  living  (ELS),  and  pain  catastrophizing  (PCS). 
They will be selected based on theoretical and empirical 
considerations.

To assess differences in effects between the guided and 
unguided  version  of  the  intervention,  independent  sam-
ples t-tests and a two-stage hierarchical multiple regres-
sion  analysis  for  each  primary  and  secondary  outcome 
will be conducted. Baseline to 3-month follow-up change 
will be used as the dependent variable. The independent 
variable will be an intervention dummy variable. Baseline 
score on the respective outcome measure will be used as 
control  variable.  Effect  sizes  for  both  conditions  will  be 
computed to indicate differences in the magnitude of the 
effects of online ACT with and without email counseling.

Interview analyses

Qualitative  data  will  be  used  to  gain  further  insight  in 
the  intervention  effects,  usage,  usability,  content  fit  of 
intervention with complaints, and satisfaction. All inter-
views  will  be  recorded  and  transcribed  verbatim.  The-
matic analysis in Atlas Ti 8.0 will be used to analyze the 
data.  Following  transcription,  two  researchers  will  inde-
pendently  (re)read  a  set  of  3–4  interviews  and  perform 
inductive  coding  followed  by  a  discussion  of  disparities. 
One  researcher  will  further  code  the  rest  of  the  inter-
views  using  a  codebook  that  will  be  generated  from  the 
first  round  of  coding,  adding  new  codes  along  the  way, 
and  discussing  outcomes  of  coding  with  the  second 
researcher.

Ethical considerations

This study protocol has been reviewed and approved by 
the  Medical  Research  Ethics  Committee  Brabant,  the 
Netherlands  (reference  number:  NL78436.028.21).  If 
there are protocol modifications, all relevant parties will 
be informed. Tilburg University has insurance for partici-
pants for compensation in the unlikely event that partici-
pants are harmed from trial participation.

Secondary analyses

To assess predictors of effects, steps of a study on predic-
tors  of  change  during  CBT  for  chronic  pain  will  be  fol-
lowed  [59].  Pain  interference  at  3-month  follow-up  will 
be used as indicator of treatment effect. Using the PRO-
CESS macro for SPSS [60], linear regression models will 
be  applied  (two-tailed).  Predictor  variables  may  include 
sex,  age,  educational  level,  number  of  comorbidities, 

Data security

Each participant will be assigned a study number, which 
guarantees  confidentiality  and  anonymity.  Only  the 
research assistant will be able to connect the study num-
bers  to  the  participants.  Data  will  be  stored  in  a  secure 
location  (PROFILES  registry)  for  15  years.  PROFILES 
data  is  freely  available  (FAIR  principles)  for  non-com-
mercial  scientific  research  trough  www. profi lesre gistry. 
nl [38].

Discussion
Chronic  painful  CIPN  is  a  very  limiting  long-term  con-
sequence  of  chemotherapy  that  many  adult  cancer  sur-
vivors  suffer  from,  resulting  in  a  greatly  reduced  QoL. 
Since  treatment  options  are  limited,  online  self-help 
therapy could offer support to these patients. This study 
aims to evaluate effectiveness of an online self-help inter-
vention  based  on  ACT.  It  could  provide  an  entry  point 
for the development of psychological treatment for can-
cer  patients  suffering  from  other  forms  of  cancer  pain, 
which is a major, growing cancer survivorship issue that 
is highly under recognized.

Trial status
Recruitment  started  in  December  2021.  Estimated  Pri-
mary Completion Date is July 1, 2023.
