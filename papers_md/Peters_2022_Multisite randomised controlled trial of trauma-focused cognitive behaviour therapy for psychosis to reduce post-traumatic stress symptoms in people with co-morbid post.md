Abstract

Background: People with psychosis have high rates of trauma, with a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
prevalence rate of approximately 15%, which exacerbates psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations.
Pilot studies have shown that trauma-focused (TF) psychological therapies can be safe and effective in such
individuals. This trial, the largest to date, will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a TF therapy integrated with
cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (TF-CBTp) on post-traumatic stress symptoms in people with psychosis.
The secondary aims are to compare groups on cost-effectiveness; ascertain whether TF-CBTp impacts on a range of
other meaningful outcomes; determine whether therapy effects endure; and determine acceptability of the therapy
in participants and therapists.
Methods: Rater-blind, parallel arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing TF-CBTp + treatment as usual
(TAU) to TAU only. Adults (N = 300) with distressing post-traumatic stress and psychosis symptoms from five mental
health Trusts (60 per site) will be randomised to the two groups. Therapy will be manualised, lasting 9 months (m)

with trained therapists. We will assess PTSD symptom severity (primary outcome); percentage who show loss of
PTSD diagnosis and clinically significant change; psychosis symptoms; emotional well-being; substance use; suicidal
ideation; psychological recovery; social functioning; health-related quality of life; service use, a total of four times:
before randomisation; 4 m (mid-therapy); 9 m (end of therapy; primary end point); 24 m (15 m after end of therapy)
post-randomisation. Four 3-monthly phone calls will be made between 9 m and 24 m assessment points, to collect
service use over the previous 3 months. Therapy acceptability will be assessed through qualitative interviews with
participants (N = 35) and therapists (N = 5–10). An internal pilot will ensure integrity of trial recruitment and
outcome data, as well as therapy protocol safety and adherence. Data will be analysed following intention-to-treat
principles using generalised linear mixed models and reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials-Social and Psychological Interventions Statement.
Discussion: The proposed intervention has the potential to provide significant patient benefit in terms of
reductions in distressing symptoms of post-traumatic stress, psychosis, and emotional problems; enable clinicians to
implement trauma-focused therapy confidently in this population; and be cost-effective compared to TAU through
reduced service use.

Introduction
Background and rationale {6a}
People with psychosis report high rates of adversity and
trauma, particularly interpersonal victimisation (e.g.
emotional, physical, and sexual abuse/assaults) both in
childhood and adulthood, with the majority having
experienced multiple
those
traumas
reporting trauma [1]). The prevalence rate of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population is
approximately 15%, which is up to five times the general
population rates [2]. PTSD is characterised by intrusive
memories of the trauma, such as ‘flashbacks’, hyper-
trauma reminders. Post-
arousal, and avoidance of
traumatic symptoms are frequently intertwined with
psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucina-
tions [3, 4]. However, in clinical practice PTSD is over-
looked in many people with psychosis [2]. A single
diagnosis often means that
the psychosis is treated
pharmacologically, but not the psychological effects of
traumatic events. Such individuals have a poorer re-
sponse to antipsychotic medication [5], and increased
substance-abuse, self-harm, suicide behaviour, and psy-
chiatric and medical hospitalisation than those with
psychosis alone [1].

as

Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is
an
recommended for people with psychosis,
adjunctive therapy to medication [6]. CBTp is a ‘trauma-
informed’ therapy, in that it involves making sense of
how trauma has shaped a person’s difficulties, and
learning strategies for managing trauma-related distress
[7, 8]. However, it does not focus directly on the key
psychological mechanism in the development and main-
tenance of PTSD—vivid, sensory trauma memories that
are poorly contextualised in autobiographical memory
[4, 9, 10]. Trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT) is recom-
mended for PTSD [11], which includes ‘trauma memory
reprocessing’,
i.e. targeting trauma memories directly,
in vivo exposure, and
through imaginal exposure,

experiential and cognitive techniques to modify their as-
sociated meanings. These techniques elaborate and con-
textualise trauma memories in autobiographical memory
so that they become less distressing and less likely to in-
trude involuntarily (e.g. as flashbacks or nightmares).
However, therapists can be reluctant to address PTSD
symptoms directly in people with psychosis as they fear
the memory reprocessing procedures may exacerbate
psychotic symptoms [12]. These concerns have excluded
people displaying psychotic symptoms from all promin-
ent PTSD trials [13].

Three systematic reviews [14–16] have all concluded
there is emerging evidence from open and pilot
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [17–19] and case-
series studies [20] that treating PTSD can be safe and ef-
ficacious in psychosis. The largest RCT was carried out
in The Netherlands [19], and recruited adults with a life-
time diagnosis of psychosis and meeting full diagnostic
criteria for PTSD. Compared to the waiting list group,
trauma-focused therapies led to improvements in PTSD
symptoms with large between-group Cohen’s d [21] ef-
fect sizes (ES) (0.78; p < 0.001, in the Prolonged Expos-
ure arm; 0.65; p = 0.001,
in the Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) arm) as
assessed with a continuous measure of PTSD symptoms
(Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [22]). Fur-
thermore, 57% in the Prolonged Exposure group (N =
53), and 60% in the EMDR condition (N = 55), achieved
a loss of PTSD diagnosis, compared to 28% of the wait-
ing list group (N = 47). End of therapy effects were
maintained at both 6 m [19] and 12 m [23] follow-up
time points, with similar results obtained on secondary
outcomes [23, 24]. However, the 12-m follow-up ana-
lyses were within group only (comparing the 6 to 12 m
outcomes), and further research is needed to ascertain
between-group long-term effects.

There have been four recent UK studies (one RCT and
three case-series studies) in this area [20, 25–27]. Steel
and colleagues [25] also showed that psychological ther-
apy was safe and feasible in a small RCT with people di-
agnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (N =
61). However, no difference was found between therapy
and treatment-as-usual (TAU) groups on PTSD symp-
toms on the CAPS-S (CAPS for Schizophrenia [28]; ei-
ther at the 6 m (end of therapy; ES = 0.26; p = 0.39) or
12 m (ES = 0.29; p = 0.39) follow-up time points, with
both groups improving. There are two potential reasons
for the discrepant results between the UK and Dutch tri-
als. First, the therapy protocol in the Steel et al. trial in-
the
volved
exposure element, unlike the Dutch study. Second, par-
ticipants did not meet full PTSD diagnostic criteria in
the UK trial. As a result, participants presented with less

compared to other trials, potentially leading to some de-
gree of spontaneous recovery occurring in both arms.

The proposed trial will address the limitations of the
previous trials in several ways. First, our proposed
intervention, TF-CBTp, includes trauma memory expos-
ure, which is hypothesised to be central to effective
trauma-focused therapy for PTSD [29]. This standard
PTSD therapy will be integrated with the standard ther-
apy for psychosis, CBTp, according to our previous the-
oretical models [3, 30, 31], practice recommendations
[8] and case-series of TF-CBTp [20, 26, 27]. Second, all
participants will meet PTSD diagnostic criteria. They
will also be screened for the presence of at least one re-
experiencing symptom [32, 33], to ensure specificity of
presenting symptoms to PTSD [34], and on which to an-
chor the trauma memory reprocessing therapeutic pro-
cedures. The diagnostic interview will put particular
emphasis on assessing symptom stability, i.e. continuous
presence of symptoms, attributable to the index trauma,
for 1 month minimum, as specified in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition
(DSM-5 [35]). Third, this study will differ from the
Dutch trials (including a new, ongoing trial comparing
Prolonged Exposure, EMDR, Cognitive Restructuring
and Waiting List) [36] by only including participants
with current distressing psychotic symptoms, rather than
merely a lifetime psychotic disorder diagnosis. Last,
between-group analyses 2 years post-randomisation will
be reported to ascertain the sustainability of treatment
effects.

Integrating TF therapy with CBTp means that it is
more intensive and lengthier
than the Prolonged
Exposure intervention reported by the Dutch group (9
months compared to eight weekly 90-min sessions over
10 weeks, respectively). However, van den Berg and col-
leagues have since reported their protocol had too few
sessions and have recommended longer therapy [37].
Psychosis and PTSD symptoms are often intertwined [3,
4], for example hearing the voice of an abuser, experien-
cing physical sensations of being interfered with, or vi-
sions of past torturers (i.e. auditory, somatic, and visual
hallucinations); or believing past abusers implanted a
chip in your brain to track you (paranoid delusions). In
practice, it therefore makes little clinical sense to treat
the PTSD and psychosis symptoms separately. The Na-
tional Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
[6] recommend a minimum of 16 sessions over 6
months or longer for psychosis, with more sessions lead-
ing to better outcomes [38]. Therapy lasting 12 months
plus boosters is recommended for complex PTSD where
there are multiple or chronic traumas [39], which is the
case for most of the people with psychosis seen in ser-
vices. Therefore, TF-CBTp is shorter and potentially less
the two conditions were addressed
costly than if

separately. In general,
integration of exposure proce-
dures within standard therapies is preferable for com-
plex, co-morbid populations [40, 41].

To conclude,

the current evidence derives from a
range of diverse small trials in different health settings.
They clearly demonstrate feasibility and promise of
useful effects, but a pragmatic effectiveness trial is now
needed. NICE have recommended that ‘an adequately
powered, multi-centre RCT is needed to test whether a
CBT-based trauma reprocessing intervention can reduce
PTSD symptoms and related distress in people with
psychosis and schizophrenia’ [6]. The recent Cochrane
Review [14] also recommended that good quality evi-
dence is required on trauma-focused therapy in psych-
osis
study
individuals with co-morbid PTSD. This
follows these recommendations and will test of whether
TF-CBTp is safe, and clinically and cost-effective in
people with psychosis.

Covid-19 adaptations to the trial
Adaptations were made to the protocol during the
pandemic to enable assessments and the intervention to
be delivered remotely either by videoconferencing or
telephone, when in-person meetings were not possible.
Although the drivers for these adaptations were compli-
ance with UK government guidelines, there is evidence
about the efficacy of remote delivery of PTSD psycho-
logical treatments dating back to more than a decade,
both in terms of telehealth (see [42] for a review) and e-
Mental Health (internet) interventions more generally
(39 studies identified by a systematic review by [43]).
There is evidence of non-inferiority from trials compar-
ing remote with in-person delivery of treatment directly
[44–46],
in terms of PTSD symptom reductions and
maintenance of treatment gains. The use of remote ther-
apy does not affect therapy competence, adherence, and
general fidelity [44, 47, 48]. Overall, a recent review [49]
concluded that telehealth interventions for PTSD have a
demonstrated evidence base of feasibility, acceptability,
and comparable outcomes to traditional in-person ther-
apy, without compromising the therapeutic process.

a dearth of studies investigating videoconferencing in
psychosis populations [53], in clinical practice it is the
norm to have at least some therapy sessions delivered by
phone with such populations, which reduces the number
of missed sessions for this group who may have difficulty
attending in person.

Page 5 of 26

There has been some suggestions that remote delivery
may adversely impact the therapeutic relationship, with
some studies [46, 54] but not others [55] finding a
slightly higher drop-out rate than in in-person PTSD
treatments. To minimise this possibility, we incorporated
the extensive guidelines that have been published for
successful delivery of remote therapy in our therapy
protocol and training [42, 56, 57]; see also resources at
https://oxcadatresources.com/covid-19-resources/).
In
addition, our therapy protocol already includes digital
materials (around providing psychoeducation and pro-
moting control), which will benefit digital platforms and
will facilitate therapy engagement.

We have included a measure of therapeutic alliance
for participants in the therapy group that will allow us
to monitor the potential impact of different modes of
delivery on the therapeutic relationship. We will record
the type of delivery used for each assessment and
therapy session, which will enable us, if required, to do
post hoc analyses comparing the use of different
platforms on outcomes.

is likely that some of

If appropriate, the adaptations will be deliverable for
the entirety of the study, rather than just during the
pandemic. Pre-pandemic, the drivers for developing re-
mote treatments were to increase access to therapy
when in-person meetings were not feasible [49]. Unsur-
prisingly, during 2020, there has been a step change in
the implementation of these methods across the UK
these
(and internationally). It
changes will remain post-pandemic, and we will be able
to continue to offer remote delivery throughout the trial
for those who prefer it. There is limited research evi-
dence on patient preferences, but one study found that
up to 50% of participants preferred remote delivery [46].
Equally, we know that not everyone is able or willing
to access remote therapy, with older and disadvantaged
groups being less likely to have access to the technology,
including having the necessary digital
literacy, and/or
suitable private space [42, 58]. With regard to psychosis
populations specifically, a recent study in one of the trial
sites showed that 30% of people on a psychological
therapy waiting list declined the offer of remote therapy
[59]. Therefore, to adhere to patient choice, there will be
the opportunity to carry out in-person therapy for those
who choose to do so, even during Covid-19 restrictions,
adhering to Trust policies and government guidelines to
ensure safety of therapists and participants.

Overall, the current changes taking place throughout
the UK and elsewhere will likely change the landscape of
therapy delivery well beyond this pandemic [42] and will
contribute to increased patient choice and access to
therapy, especially for difficult to reach populations [58].
Delivering at least some therapy sessions by phone is
already standard practice with psychosis population;

going forward,
there will be increased flexibility of
delivery platforms to cater to different clinical needs and
preferences, both across patients
and within the
therapy for individual patients. We are

therefore confident that our results will be valid and
generalisable post-pandemic. We will also have access to
further data on patient and therapist experience through
our qualitative interviews, which will provide useful in-
formation about
the different
options.

Objectives {7}
Our research question is the following: Is TF-CBTp in
addition to TAU clinically and cost-effective in reducing
the severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms in people
with PTSD and psychosis at the end of therapy, com-
pared to TAU alone?

Primary aim
The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
manualised trauma-focused therapy for psychosis (TF-
CBTp) on post-traumatic stress symptom severity in
people with current PTSD and psychosis at the end of
therapy (9 m post-randomisation).

Secondary aims
Secondary aims are as follows:

1. To compare the two groups at 9 m post-

randomisation (end of therapy) on (i) percentage of
individuals achieving a loss of PTSD diagnosis, and
showing clinically significant change; (ii) PTSD
symptom clusters; psychosis symptoms and associ-
ated distress; emotional well-being; suicidal ideation;
substance use; psychological recovery; social func-
tioning; (iii) cost-effectiveness;

2. To determine whether therapy effects endure 24 m
post-randomisation (15 m post end of therapy), in-
cluding both clinical and cost-effectiveness;

3. To determine the acceptability of TF-CBTp in par-

ticipants and therapists.

Trial design {8}
The STAR (Study of Trauma And Recovery) trial is a
rater-blind, parallel arm RCT comparing an integrated
therapy to address post-traumatic stress and psychosis
symptoms (TF-CBTp)
to TAU
alone, in individuals with co-morbid PTSD and psych-
osis across five sites. Randomisation will be in the ratio
1:1 to the two groups and will be stratified by centre. It
will be a pragmatic clinical and cost-effectiveness super-
iority trial.

Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}
The comparator will be TAU, which consists of multi-
disciplinary psychologically informed care, delivered by
mental health services.

Specifically, TAU will include standard psychiatric care
consisting of medication and outpatient psychiatric
appointments; psychologically informed case-management,
including regular meetings with a care coordinator; access
to a range of psychotherapies, which could include CBTp.
Clinicians involved in participants’ treatment will receive a

manual summarising current best practice and evidence-
based treatment guidelines to promote standardisation of
good quality TAU.

Intervention description {11a}
Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for psychosis
(TF-CBTp)
TF-CBTp is a manualised therapy integrating standard
psychological therapy for PTSD and for psychosis [3, 8,
20, 25–27, 31]. It will be delivered over a period of 9 m.
Approximately 26 weekly or bi-weekly individual 60–90-
min sessions will be offered in the first 6 m. Bi-weekly
rather than weekly sessions have a potential to be benefi-
cial during the trauma reprocessing phase of the therapy
[70, 71] but it will be left to participant choice. A further
three sessions will be offered on a monthly basis during
the next 3 m, to consolidate therapeutic gains. They will
be done jointly with the care coordinator, if possible, to
assist with generalisability of therapy effects. Therapists
will liaise with clinical teams throughout the delivery of
therapy to discuss progress, with the participant’s con-
sent, and to share any potential risk to self or others.

TF-CBTp is formulation-based and individualised to
tailor to the specific needs of the individual, depending
on the type of PTSD presentation (for example, PTSD
following a single traumatic event versus complex PTSD
as a result of polyvictimisation) and type of psychotic
symptom (for example, hallucinations or delusions).
Therapy is conducted in a flexible style with an emphasis
on engagement and building a good therapeutic relation-
ship, which is key throughout the delivery of therapy.
Trauma-focused work can be emotionally challenging,
and throughout, a balance is struck between ensuring
the person is able to manage distress and improve their
coping if necessary, whilst not delaying or avoiding the
trauma-focused interventions. Overall, TF-CBTp con-
sists of four broad, flexible phases: (1) assessment, psy-
choeducation, and goal setting; (2) developing a shared
understanding of current difficulties and maintenance
cycles,
i.e. formulation; (3) formulation-driven model-
based interventions, consisting of (a) promoting control;
(b) addressing trauma memories, anomalous experi-
ences, and associated meanings; and (c) rebuilding your
life, with cognitive, behavioural, and interpersonal tech-
niques integrated as necessary into model-based inter-
ventions; and (4) consolidation and staying well (see Fig.
2). Phase 3 includes the memory reprocessing strategies,
which are hypothesised to be necessary for the reduction
of post-traumatic stress symptoms. The aim here is to
associated psychotic
reduce
symptoms through elaboration of the trauma memory
and discrimination of triggers. The method of elabor-
ation will be determined by the nature of the person’s
memory intrusions as specified in the formulation but

re-experiencing and/or

Fig. 2 Trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (TF-CBTp) overview

will include established reprocessing strategies such as
imaginal reliving and imagery rescripting.

Given the time limited nature of the therapy and that
the main target of therapy is post-traumatic stress symp-
toms, the aim is to adhere to PTSD model-based inter-
ventions unless adaptations for psychosis are necessary.
In practice, therapy is formulation based and hence per-
sonalised and pragmatic in that it is adapted to the indi-
vidual, with clinicians able to shift focus according to
clinical need. Similarly, therapy speed and progression
are tailored to the individual. Psychosis-focused inter-
ventions are embedded throughout to address psychosis-
related experiences, appraisals, and behaviours as they
arise.

research distressing,
longer wish to
continue with either the research or the therapy, they
will be able to withdraw from either or both without
having to give a reason or this impacting on their
usual clinical care in any way. Clinical teams will be
responsible for the provision of TAU interventions,
with no interference from the research team.

At the trial level, it is an important subsidiary goal of
the trial to establish the safety of the intervention, and
we will take all appropriate steps during the conduct of
the trial for ensuring participant safety, in both arms of
the trial. Concerns over safety of TF-CBTp, identified
through adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events
(SAEs), therapy sessional ratings or qualitative inter-
views, would, in the first instance, lead to therapy proto-
col amendments, but could lead to study termination at
any time. Our experience with this population and type
of therapy suggests that the therapy proving unaccept-
able or too distressing to participants is a low risk. So far

Peters et al. Trials          (2022) 23:429 

Page 10 of 26

the evidence suggests the opposite, with van den Berg
and colleagues [72] showing that fewer SAEs, symptom
exacerbations, and revictimisation experiences were re-
ported in the therapy groups, compared to the Waiting
List group, suggesting that therapy decreases risk. How-
ever, we would see this unlikely eventuality as an im-
portant outcome of
the study, as it would provide
empirical evidence to inform future studies on what
should be avoided in people with PTSD and psychosis,
rather than relying solely on clinical intuition.

Outcomes {12}
The primary outcome for the study is PTSD symptom
severity at 9 m post-randomisation (end of
therapy),
assessed on the CAPS-5 [69] (past-month version), a
semi-structured interview assessing the severity of symp-
toms delineated in DSM-5 [35]. It is currently the rec-
ommended
interview in PTSD research,
including in psychosis populations [19]. The total symp-
tom severity score will be the specific measurement
variable.

Research assessments to assess PTSD and secondary
outcomes,
including cost-effectiveness outcomes, will
take place at four time points (baseline, 4 m (mid-ther-
apy), 9 m (end of therapy; primary endpoint), and 24 m
(15 m post-therapy) post-randomisation). There will also
be four ‘keeping in touch’ phone calls where service use
will be assessed and contact details updated (at 12 m; 15
m; 18 m; and 21 m, post-randomisation). The 24 m post-
randomisation assessment will enable us to determine
whether therapy effects endure on both our primary and
secondary outcomes. The 4 m assessment and the phone
calls will help retention into the trial and reduce loss to
follow-up, by avoiding having lengthy periods of time in
the study without contact from the research team.

Sample size {14}
We will recruit 300 people for the study, 150 in each
group, and 60 per site.

Sample size calculations accounted for clustering in
therapy arm with intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.01
with 10 therapists over the trial period, each with an
average of 12 participants and variation in the cluster
size of 12; no clustering in TAU group; 1:1 allocation;
0.05 significance level; baseline-endpoint correlation of
0.5 (range in previous data [19, 25]: 0.4–0.7) reducing
the standard deviation (SD) to 0.866 from a standardised
value of 1.

Allowing for 20% attrition to primary endpoint, 120
people per group in the analysis set has 91% power to
detect an effect size of 0.4. As a sensitivity check, with
240 participants in the analysis set, if the ICC = 0.05 we
would still retain 85% power. Alternatively, if the ICC =
0.01, a sample size of 240 participants has 80% power to

Concealment mechanism {16b}
The allocation sequence will be held independently of the

via a secure web-based service hosted by King’s Clinical
Trials Unit (KCTU). The allocation is dynamically gener-
ated and uses randomly varying blocks of sizes not known
to the study team so allocation concealment is assured.

Implementation {16c}
The research workers will enroll participants, and KCTU
will assign participants to the two groups. The therapists
will inform the participants to which group they have
been randomised.

Assignment of interventions: Blinding
Who will be blinded {17a}
Clinicians, therapists, and participants will be unblinded,
as is customary in psychological therapies trial. The
research workers who conduct follow-up assessments
will remain blinded to the allocation of participants until
after the participant has completed their involvement in
the trial. They will not be exposed to clinical notes or
therapy records whilst they remain blinded. A system of
web-based data entry will be used to ensure assessors do
not have access to information in the database that
might reveal allocation. Participants and clinical teams

will be reminded prior to each assessment timepoint by
the research team that they must not inform the re-
search workers of their group allocation. The senior trial
statistician will be blind throughout the study; the trial
statistician will be unblinded at a group level after the
first Data Management and Ethics Committee (DMEC)
meeting. The Statistical Analysis Plan will be prepared
before any unblinding of the trial statistician, and only
amended by the senior trial statistician.

Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b}
There are no pre-determined situations in which blinded
research workers should become unblinded. Breaks in
blindness will be monitored and recorded and where op-
erationally feasible assessments will be allocated to an-
other (blinded) research worker. Where blind breaks
occur during an assessment, any interview-based mea-
sures that have been recorded will be scored by another
(blinded)
research worker, removing the unblinding
information.

Data quality
Assessors will be trained to competence on the interview
outcome measures (CAPS-5 and PSYRATs scales) [67,
69] prior to starting any assessments, i.e. they will need
to have reached > 80% agreement with ratings made by
the Trial Coordinators on training videos during the
initial
training stage. Agreement will be based on
symptom presence ratings for the CAPS 5 (i.e. scores of
2 or above for each item of criteria B-E) and individual
item scores for the PSYRATS. Once started, assessments
will be recorded, with participants’ consent, to conduct
further inter-rater reliability on the interview measures.
Each research worker’s assessments will be double-rated
by the Trial Coordinator until > 80% agreement has been

Peters et al. Trials          (2022) 23:429 

Page 14 of 26

reached. These procedures will be repeated every 4–6
months to minimise rater drift. Inter-rater reliability for
our primary outcome will be reported from the double
ratings made throughout the lifetime of the trial for a
minimum of 60 ratings (excluding those used for rating
agreement during the initial competency training stage
prior to obtaining > 80% agreement).

Measures
All measures were selected or designed with the
participant population in mind and are considered
suitable for people with psychosis to complete. A range
of potential measures for each domain of assessment
was presented to our experts-by-experience advisory
group who made the final selection, based on consider-
ation of content acceptability and burden. An extra
questionnaire will be administered to capture contextual
information relating to the Covid-19 pandemic such as
the degree of restrictions at the time of assessment, level
of
lockdown in the previous month, and how much
Covid-19 has impacted on the person.

Primary outcome PTSD symptom severity in the past
month will be assessed on the CAPS-5 [69]. The CAPS-
5 is a semi-structured interview assessing the severity of
symptoms delineated in DSM-5 [35].

The CAPS-5 consists of seven criteria (Criteria A to
G). Scores are anchored to an index event, which will be
elicited using the mini-TALE and TALE checklists [61,
62]. The index event could be a single trauma experi-
ence or multiple incidents. In this study, meeting Criter-
ion A (i.e. only events including objective actual or
threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence) will
not be a requirement, as we will include events related
to psychosis and its consequences (e.g. hearing a threat-
ening voice, involuntary admission or forced restraint),
emotional and physical neglect, discrimination, and at-
tachment disrupting experiences, as possible index
events [68]. PTSD diagnostic status will be determined
by an algorithm of minimum scores on specific items
from Criteria B to E, and meeting Criteria F and G, ac-
cording to DSM-5 diagnostic rules.

Once the index event has been ascertained,

the
severity of symptoms is scored on a 5-point scale (‘ab-
sent’ to ‘extreme’) on four criteria: (i) Criterion B: Re-
(ii) Criterion C: Avoidance
experiencing symptoms;
symptoms; (iii) Criterion D: Cognitions and mood symp-
toms; (iv) Criterion E: Arousal and reactivity symptoms.
Criteria F and G are scored dichotomously (Yes/No) on
whether the duration of the experience is more than 1
m, and has caused subjective distress and impairment in
functioning, respectively. The total symptom severity
score (total of 20 item scores on Criteria B to E) will be
the primary outcome.

Secondary outcomes All measures listed below consist
of standardised questionnaires and semi-structured in-
terviews, with demonstrated reliability and validity. Short
forms have been included when available, to minimise
participant burden. The timescale of assessment will be
the past month for all symptom measures, consistent
with our primary outcome (apart from substance use,
which will be 3 months as the timescale cannot be
amended, and the economic measures). All have been
used in previous trials with psychosis populations and
were endorsed by our experts-by-experience advisory
groups.

Symptoms

PTSD PTSD includes the following: (i) percentage of
people who achieve a loss of their PTSD diagnosis, as
determined by the CAPS-5 diagnostic status algorithm;
(ii) percentage of people who show a clinically significant
improvement and a reliable change in CAPS-5 scores;
(iii) CAPS-5 individual symptom clusters (severity scores
for the individual Criteria B to E); (iv) self-reported
PTSD symptoms and their associated appraisals and re-
sponses will be assessed on standardised, commonly

cognitive appraisals of the trauma and its aftermath; Dis-
sociative Subtype of PTSD Scale (DSPS; 15 items [77];),
which assesses lifetime occurrence and current
fre-
quency and intensity of dissociative symptoms (consist-

items for voices, and six items for delusions). The PSYR
ATS is well suited to assess outcome in psychological
therapies [78] and has been used in major RCTs [63,
64]. PSYRATS items will also be administered for hallu-
cinations in other modalities (i.e. non-verbal auditory;
visual; somatic; sexual sensations; olfactory; gustatory;
sense of presence [79]), and additional items will be in-
cluded at

self-report rating scale will be added to each item, as
there is evidence that the nominal scale is not sensitive
to change for some of the items (e.g. delusional convic-
tion is rated as a 3 for conviction ratings of 50–99%, and
as 4 for 100%; therefore, a 50% change in delusional con-
viction only incurs a 1-point difference). The rating scale
will be presented in the form of a thermometer to facili-
tate self-report. Both ratings (total scores for each PSYR

five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate prob-
lems, severe problems, and extreme problems). Partici-

Therapeutic alliance We will assess the therapeutic
alliance between therapists and participants
in the
therapy group to monitor
impact of
different modes of therapy delivery, implemented as a
result of the Covid-19 pandemic, on the therapeutic re-
lationships. The therapists and client versions of the
Working Alliance Inventory – Short Form Revised
(WAI-SR) [93] will be used. Three key aspects of alliance
are assessed: agreement on therapy tasks, agreement on
therapy goals, and the development of an affective bond
[93]. Both the self-report participant and therapist ver-
sions will be completed at three time points (sessions 3,
13, and last session). The therapists will be blind to par-
ticipant ratings at all time points.

and

(e.g.

Participants who choose to end the therapy early or

receiving trauma-focused therapy in the TAU group)
will still be invited to complete all
follow-up assess-
ments. Participants will be remunerated for their time
and travel, which secures good concordance with trial
procedures, even in those who end therapy early [94].
There will be flexibility around the location of assess-
ments, including remote assessments or home visits for
participants who are unable to travel. Anyone who
moves within the UK will be followed up.

A mid-therapy assessment is included to minimise at-
trition from the trial, as 9 m is a long period without
contact with the research team for this population. This
is particularly the case for the control group and those
who end therapy early, and the extra assessment stage
will provide data that can be used in the linear mixed
model for the intention-to-treat analysis for those who
drop out of the study at the primary endpoint. This adds
some validation to a missing-at-random assumption for
outcome missingness. The four ‘keeping in touch’ phone
calls will also help to retain participants in the trial until
the final assessment 24 m post-randomisation.

Data management {19}
All data are anonymised at source. No patient identifiable
information is recorded on the research assessment
records, and the computerised database is held centrally
and managed by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit (KCTU).
A web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system will be
designed, using the InferMed Macro 4 system. The EDC
will be created in collaboration with the trial analyst/s and
the Trial Coordinator and maintained by the KCTU for
the duration of the project. It will be hosted on a dedi-
cated server within KCL.

Source data will be entered by the research workers at
each site by authorised staff onto the EDC. A full audit
trial of data entry and any subsequent changes to
entered data will be automatically date and time
stamped, alongside information about the user making
the entry/changes within the system. Database access
will be strictly restricted through user-specific passwords
to the authorised research team members. The data
management plan is in the study site file and can be pro-
vided on request.

Data quality will be ensured by close monitoring and
routine auditing for accuracy throughout
the data
collection period. To ensure the accuracy of the data
entered into the database, the main outcome measure
entry will be checked for 20% of participants by
comparing the paper record with that on the database.
An error rate of no more than 5% is acceptable. If the
the percentage of
error
participants checked will increase to a minimum 50%.
No data will be amended independently of the study site
responsible for entering the data. Prior to analysis of the
9 m and 24 m outcomes, there will be a central process
of data cleaning and checking to verify that all data are
complete and correct. At this point, data can be formally
locked for analysis of that timepoint.

Pseudonymised recordings of the qualitative interviews
will be transcribed by a KCL-approved transcription ser-
vice. All recordings will be transferred and stored se-
curely, and the transcription service will follow GDPR
regulations (2018).

Confidentiality {27}
Clinical confidentiality
Issues relating to confidentiality will be addressed at the
eligibility stage and potential participants will be advised
of the limits of confidentiality. It is also possible that
disclosure of criminal or other acts potentially requiring
action will occur during assessment
and therapy
sessions. The research team will be trained in both local
and national policies for dealing with such disclosures
and will follow our Standard Operational Procedures for
managing risk disclosures. Therapists will
address
confidentiality issues again with participants allocated to

the TF-CBTp group at the start of therapy, and at any
appropriate subsequent points during the therapy.

Data confidentiality
Research data will be confidential unless a participant
discloses information that indicates that they or another
person are at risk of harm. If harm is disclosed, the
research worker or trial therapist would be required to
share this information with the participant’s care team

data will be destroyed following a period of 10 years (as
determined by relevant information governance policies)
after the completion of the trial.

No participant identifiable information is recorded on
the research assessment records and the computerised
database is held centrally and managed by the KCTU.
Data from the assessments are entered into this central
record by research workers using a secure network
connection.

Therapy files will be kept in a secure office and are
not accessible to the staff collecting the research
outcome data.

Recordings
Encrypted recording equipment
(such as encrypted
smart phone, laptop, or equivalent devices) will be used
to record assessments (with participant consent)
to
check fidelity to assessment protocols and allow for
multiple ratings of assessments to ensure inter-rater reli-
ability. The therapy sessions will also be recorded (with
participant consent) for monitoring the fidelity of the
intervention delivery. These files named with a unique
participant identifier will be transferred to secure central
storage as soon as possible and stored as computer files

on secure NHS/ University servers. Recordings of the
therapy will be accessible to the participant’s therapist,
the supervisor, and a random selection to the independ-
ent fidelity rater. With additional, optional participant
consent, anonymised therapy excerpts will be used for
training and dissemination purposes.

The study will adhere to the joint guidance on secure
recording issued by KCL and the NHS Trusts. When
not in use, encrypted devices will be stored in a locked
cabinet within a locked office. Each device will be
password protected. In the event of the device being lost
or stolen, this will be reported as a data incident to the
Information Management and Compliance Team at
KCL and the Information Governance Team at
the
relevant NHS Trust. Any sensitive data on a lost/stolen
device will be remotely erased.

Pseudonymised audio recordings of

the qualitative
interviews will be transcribed by a KCL-approved tran-
scription service. All recordings will be transferred and
stored securely, and the transcription service will follow

timated effect at 24 m.

Economic analysis
A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried
out, taking the NHS/personal social services perspective
preferred by NICE [92]. Service use will be measured in
interview using the AD-SUS [91], at baseline (covering
the previous 3 months), at the 4 m, 9 m, and 24 m
follow-up points, and at the four 3-monthly phone calls
(covering the period since previous interview/phone call,
thus ensuring coverage of the full 24-m period). Service
use will be costed using nationally applicable unit costs

(e.g. NHS Reference Costs for hospital contacts; Personal
Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) Unit Costs of
Health and Social Care for community-based services;
and the British National Formulary for medication). The
TF-CBTp intervention will be directly costed taking a
standard micro-costing approach [95]. Data on therapist
time will be collected from clinical records (number and
duration of face-to-face contacts) and unit costs will be
based on the mid-point of the therapists’ salary, includ-
ing all employer costs (National Insurance and super-
annuation)
(capital,
managerial, administrative, etc.). The cost of supervision
will be included and indirect time (for, e.g. training, ad-
ministration, meetings with other professionals) will be
estimated using a questionnaire completed by each ther-
apist on the time they spend on various direct and indir-
ect patient-related activities.

appropriate

overheads

and

The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-utility
analysis carried out at the 9-m endpoint (end of ther-
apy), in line with the clinical analyses, with outcomes
expressed in terms of QALYs, calculated from the EQ-
5D-5L [88], using the area under the curve approach
[96]. Given evidence to suggest the EQ-5D may not be
particularly sensitive in psychosis populations, the new
ReQoL measure [89] and the primary clinical outcome
measure (CAPS-5 [69]) will be included in secondary
economic analyses. All three economic evaluations will
be repeated at the 24-m follow-up to explore the longer-
term impact of TF-CBTp compared to TAU.

Costs and QALYs will be compared at the 9-m and
24-m follow-up points and presented as mean values by
trial arm with standard deviations. Mean differences in
costs and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained by
non-parametric bootstrap regressions to account for the
non-normal distribution commonly found in economic
data [97]. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed using the
net benefit approach and following standard approaches
[98]. A joint distribution of incremental mean costs and
effects for the two groups will be generated using boot-
strapping to explore the probability that TF-CBTp is the
optimal choice compared to TAU, subject to a range of
possible maximum values (ceiling ratio) that a decision-
maker might be willing to pay for unit improvements in
outcomes. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be
presented by plotting these probabilities for a range of
possible values of the ceiling ratio [99]. These curves are
a recommended decision-making approach to dealing
with the uncertainty that exists around the estimates of
expected costs and expected effects associated with the
interventions under investigation and uncertainty re-
garding the maximum cost-effectiveness ratio that a
decision-maker would consider acceptable. To provide
more relevant treatment-effect estimates, all economic

specified and in line with the clinical analyses. The pri-
mary analysis will be a complete case analysis with the
nature and impact of missing data, in particular those
lost to follow-up, explored in sensitivity analyses.

categories. Member checking strategies [102] will be
employed for this stage of the analysis with participants,
members of the research team, and expert-by-experience
consultants, to maximise the transparency and trust-
worthiness of the data. Data management and analysis
will be supported by NVivo software. Analysis will occur
in parallel with data generation and will continue until
thematic saturation is achieved (the point at which no
new categories emerge). All trial documentation and
data will be retained for a minimum of 10 years, as
stated in Clinical Trials Regulations.

Interim analyses {21b}
No interim analyses are planned.

Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses)
{20b}
Any putative subgroups,
including centre, will be
assessed by including an interaction term between
randomisation and the subgroup variable, as well as a
main effect for the subgroup if not already in the model.
All additional analyses will be clearly specified in the
Statistical Analysis Plan and reviewed by the DMEC.

Methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence
and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c}

The DMEC will monitor the following: (1) recruitment
of study participants; (2) ethical issues of consent; (3)
quality of data (including missing data and unblindings);
(4) the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs); (5)
any other factors that might compromise the progress
and satisfactory completion of the trial. The Chair will
be responsible for confirming judgements on the
likelihood of any SAE’s relatedness to trial procedures as
well as the SAE’s intensity and unexpectedness. The
DMEC will make recommendations to the TSC on
whether there are any ethical or safety reasons why the
trial should not continue, with the safety, rights, and
well-being of participants being paramount. It will con-
sider the need for any interim analyses, including poten-
tial requests from the Funder, and will advise the TSC
regarding the release of data and/or information. The
DMEC will consist of three independent members: a
chairperson, a clinical academic, and a statistician. The
PI, trial coordinators, and statisticians will attend parts
of the DMEC meeting to provide reports but will not be
members or be present when unblinded data is dis-
cussed. The DMEC charter is in the study site file and
can be provided on request.

study. In addition, we will have local PPI reference
groups who will be asked to contribute to the delivery of
the trial in a range of ways, e.g. consultation and piloting
on assessment protocols; reviewing materials; supporting
training of staff; supporting recruitment to the trial; con-
ducting qualitative interviews with participants in the
intervention group; and assisting with dissemination. Ex-
perts by experience researchers conducting the inter-
views will be provided with supervision from EL and site
leads.

Adverse event reporting and harms {22}
Best practice, professional guideline, and local NHS
policies for monitoring mental state and risk will be
followed throughout the participants’ involvement in the
trial and will be facilitated by close liaison with clinical
teams. The safety of the intervention will be monitored

closely during therapy sessions and through regular
contact with the participant’s clinical team or GP.

The occurrence of adverse events

(AEs) will be
monitored actively and systematically and recorded by
research workers and therapists,
following guidance
from the CONSORT-SPI [74] with the extension for
non-pharmacologic treatment, and the extension for
reporting of harms. Reasons for withdrawal from the
study will also be recorded. Medical Research Council
Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in Clinical Trials
will also be followed to ensure good governance of the
trial for integrity and participants’ safety and well-being.
To ensure active surveillance of harms, at each
assessment point, research workers will actively check
for the occurrence of specific AEs using a structured
checklist completed with the participant. Clinical notes
will additionally be checked by unblinded members of
the research team for any further undisclosed record of
AEs. This extra procedure is to ensure completeness of
records and to address the possibility of an increased
likelihood of disclosure of AEs in the TF-CBTp condi-
tion, as a result of greater frequency of contact and the
therapeutic relationship.

Good Clinical Practice guidance for non-CTIMPs
(Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product)
studies will be followed to make decisions regarding ser-
iousness (i.e. AEs vs SAEs), relatedness to the trial (i.e.
Related Events (REs) and serious related events (SREs),
and unexpected serious related events (USREs).

AEs are defined by the Health Research Authority as
any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease

whether or not related to the treatment, which require
additional support or input from health professionals. In

health problems and/or risky or problematic behaviours;
including suicide attempts; harm
harm to self/others,
from others; emergency room visits; or crises. Clinically
significant increases will be operationalised as an unre-
solved exacerbation requiring increased involvement
from the care team, e.g. requiring a change in treatment
plan. Distress or complaints associated with therapy,
completion of assessment measures, or any other trial
procedure would also constitute AEs.

The causes for the AEs will also be recorded and
monitored. For each AE, the following potential reasons
will be identified: victimisation (aggressive behaviour,
sexual abuse/assault, physical abuse/assault, emotional
and
abuse/psychological maltreatment,

AEs will be assessed initially at three levels of severity,
namely mild, moderate, and severe, which reflect the
severity or impact of the event on the person at the
time, and is distinct
from seriousness. Seriousness
relates to the outcome of the event and is the criteria for
defining regulatory reporting obligations: SAEs are
defined as death and life-threatening events (Category
A), incidents which acutely jeopardise the health or psy-
chological well-being of the individual, resulting in im-

there are any concerns about unexpectedly high rates of
SAEs, SREs, or USREs, which may include being
unblinded as to trial condition or seeking further data on
adverse events, and will advise the TSC on any ethical or
safety reasons why the trial should be prematurely ended.

academics;
service
providers; and NICE guideline development group. It is
intended that the results of the study will be reported
and disseminated at international conferences and in
peer-reviewed scientific journals and will be made avail-
able to participants and clinical teams in an accessible
format and on the study website. Trial findings will also
be accessible in print and digital media and presented at
stakeholder’s events. One of the key outputs of this
study will be the publication of the final, detailed therapy
manual, which will include specific guidelines for the de-
livery of therapy and operational guidelines for its appli-

Discussion
therapies and the
Improving access to psychological
implementation of trauma-informed care are key issues
for NHS services. The proposed therapy, if acceptable,
will provide a new, integrated psychological therapy for
people with complex mental health problems whose
needs are often not met by mental health services. The
outcomes of this study, if positive, will be immediately
useful to patients, clinicians, and clinical services. The
proposed intervention has the potential to provide sig-
nificant benefits to the substantial number of people
who are affected by past trauma in terms of reductions
in distressing post-traumatic stress, psychosis, and other
symptoms. If found to be acceptable and safe, the ther-
apy could overcome obstacles in therapy delivery in clin-
ical practice such as clinicians’ concerns about
the
potential of trauma-focused therapy to exacerbate psych-
osis symptoms, and lack of confidence or competence in
effectively treating trauma-related problems in psychosis

to be cost-effective to service providers through reduced
need for participants to receive support
from other

The availability of a detailed therapy manual will
enable the therapy to be applied by CBT-trained thera-
pists throughout the NHS, in both primary and second-
ary care settings and elsewhere. There are current plans
for a significant expansion of training in CBTp nationally
by NHS-England (NHS-E), which will be timely for max-
imum impact of the manual, as it can be embedded
within the curriculum of the national training programs.
The main barrier to providing immediate patient
is likely to be a lack of resources for the

implementation of
the therapy. However, providing
parity of care for mental health is an ongoing, pan-party
government agenda. The development of psychological
interventions for psychosis, specifically, is a current NHS
priority, with recent investments by NHS-E in Improving
Access to Psychological Therapies – Severe Mental Ill-
ness (IAPT-SMI) demonstration sites [107], and the im-
plementation of national standards for the access and
waiting times for psychological therapies in Early Inter-
ventions for Psychosis services [108]. The remit of
IAPT-SMI has since expanded (now renamed Psycho-
logical Therapies for SMI), with training plans contribut-
ing to a national agenda for increasing the workforce.
The recent inclusion in NICE guidelines of the necessity
to assess and treat trauma symptoms in people with
psychosis in Early Interventions for Psychosis services is
an indication that this topic is timely and will remain
highly relevant to the needs of the NHS. Pathways to
specialist
to the
trauma therapy are also integral
provision of
trauma-informed care, which is recom-
mended in the NHS Long Term Plan as the model for

community services in adults with severe mental health
problems [109]. A failure to treat trauma sequelae in
psychosis is itself costly to patients, their families, and
the NHS. Should the therapy prove cost-effective, it will
provide evidence to Clinical Commissioning Groups that
investing in this treatment will save money in the long
run.
