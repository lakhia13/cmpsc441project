We aim to describe the Australian child and
adolescent mental health system, which has
its historical origins in the child guidance
clinic, with recent efforts at modernisation to
meet community needs and major policy
innovations, including the National Disability
Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and expansion of
digital/telehealth services. Shared funding/
responsibility across commonwealth and
state/territory governments has resulted in
country-wide variations, allowing innovation
but also introducing fragmentation and
duplication. The increase in demand
outstripping supply (which was exacerbated
by workforce shortages resulting from the
pandemic), the lack of robust evaluation, and
poor service integration (which make
navigation difﬁcult for families) are ongoing
challenges.

The Commonwealth of Australia comprises six
states and two territories. Australia has strong
government and public service systems support-
ing health, education, employment and social ser-
vices. While maintaining strong ties with the UK
and USA, Australia has a close relationship with
New Zealand and increasingly sees itself within
the Asia Paciﬁc region. The Australian child and
system is
adolescent mental health (CAMH)
embedded in the broader mental health and
health system.

Australia’s population is around 25 million, with
just over 20% aged under 18 years. Indigenous
Australian history dates back over 50 000 years,
with contemporary Australia born through British
colonialisation over the past 250 years. Modern
Australia is highly multicultural and over 85% live
leaving regional/rural areas
in coastal areas,
sparsely populated. These demographic and geo-
graphical factors make delivery of effective and
equitable healthcare a challenge.

Total health spending is 9.8% of gross domes-
tic product, with 7.3% of the budget spent on
mental health but only a fraction of this is allo-
cated to CAMH. Both state and Commonwealth
governments are active in CAMH policy, funding
and service delivery, with a National Children’s
Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy developed
in 2021.1 The Commonwealth-funded health
insurance (Medicare) covers primary care and
community ofﬁce-based specialist mental health
practice on a ‘fee for service’ model, often with a
patient co-payment, referred to as the ‘private

(NDIS)

funded by

sector’. This insurance includes psychiatric con-
sultation and care and psychotherapeutic treat-
ments by psychologists and other mental health
clinicians. State-funded services cover hospital
and specialist community CAMH services, while
developmental/intellectual disability and mental
health-related (categorised as psychosocial) dis-
ability are covered by the National Disability
Insurance Scheme
the
Commonwealth government. Further, non-
governmental organisations
(NGOs) deliver a
range of CAMH-relevant services, such as youth,
family and drug and alcohol, services, out-of-
home care (foster or residential care) and employ-
ment
support/recovery or rehabilitation. The
Commonwealth also directly funds headspace, a
network of youth-focused (12–25 years of age)
mental health clinics.2 Head to Health Kids is a
similar development for children 0–11 years old.
This complex policy, governance and funding
environment provides CAMH services with some
national consistency in themes and architecture,
but leads to substantial variation in service form,
level and nomenclature across states and territor-
ies. Consequently, a universal description of the
Australian CAMH system is challenging.

The epidemiology of child and adolescent
(4–17
years) mental health difﬁculties
in
Australia is comparable to international estimates,
with a prevalence of around 14%.3 Signiﬁcant
increase in demand and expansion of digital
(e.g. parenting programmes) and telehealth ser-
vice delivery that occurred during the pandemic
has improved access particularly for those in
regional/rural areas. Although well-resourced by
international standards, there remains a substan-
tial shortfall, with only a quarter of those with sig-
niﬁcant mental health problems seeing child
psychiatrists, while the others access general prac-
titioners (GPs), paediatricians and psychologists.4
Australia has recently seen considerable polit-
ical will, additional funding and efforts to mod-
ernise
including
high-level inquiries5 outlining the argument and
impetus for transforming the mental healthcare
system, including CAMH services, but with vari-
able response from states and territories. A tiered
CAMH system is envisaged, with strong commu-
nity orientation and an integrated continuum of
connect and care (I-CCC) pathways to higher-
or lower-intensity services from primary to specia-
lised, as individual needs change.6

the emergence of a peer workforce. Much of this
is articulated in adult mental health and the pro-
cess of bringing young peoples’ voices into the
design, running and delivery of CAMH services
is in its infancy.

An aspect of Australian CAMH has been the
emergence of the youth mental health move-
ment,2 including the change from CAMH to
CY(outh)MH services, covering 0–25 years of
age. This represents Australia’s response to transi-
tional (transition-age) youth, and at the younger
end of the age range, Australia has more devel-
oped perinatal and infant mental health services
than elsewhere.

Despite some of the recent innovations in mod-
els of care and expanded funding, the CAMH ser-
vice system is facing signiﬁcant challenges in
workforce size, architecture and equitable distri-
bution of resources. This is further compounded
by poor integration across state and common-
wealth governments; across health, disability,
education and social care within each govern-
‘private’ and
ment; and between government,
NGO sectors.

Architecture of the Australian CAMH
system
The aspiration is for a CAMH system that is com-
munity oriented, accessible and providing the
right intensity of care, at the right time and
close to home, with the capacity and ﬂexibility to
step up and down the care levels.

Prevention, early intervention and primary care
Prevention and early intervention services are
currently expanding and include the develop-
mental surveillance programme and early parent-
ing interventions. There is a renewed focus on the
ﬁrst 2000 days from pregnancy to the start of
school,7 with headspace and youth mental health
conceived as early (in illness) intervention.

Australia has a robust primary care sector, with
GPs serving as the ﬁrst point of contact and the
referral conduit to more specialised CAMH care.
Limitations in time, training and skills, funding
models and access to psychiatric consultation
due to cost and low availability are barriers to
greater CAMH service delivery in primary care,
although it is expanding.

Middle-tier CAMH services
The middle-tier services such as headspace and,
more recently, the Head to Health hubs, initially
conceptualised as enhanced primary care, are
increasingly providing care for those with moder-
ate to severe mental disorders that do not meet
the clinical or capacity thresholds of the tertiary
public CAMH services; in other words, closing
the ‘missing middle’. However, there is debate
about headspace’s clinical and cost-effectiveness,
in need and
whether it
whether it is worsening the fragmentation and
lack of integration within the service system.8

those most

targets

Medicare-funded, private ofﬁce-based practice
by psychiatrists, paediatricians and allied health
clinicians has recently seen substantial investment
by the Commonwealth, which has also increased
access to subsidised psychotherapeutic treatments
in the community through Medicare. However,
the substantial ‘gap’ payments paid by the patient
(a charge determined by the practitioner above
the government rebate) and unequal distribution
limits its access for regional/rural and disadvan-
taged populations with the greatest need.

Recovery- or rehabilitation-focused intervention
The NGO sector, using state and Commonwealth
funding, delivers recovery and rehabilitation
intervention, including NDIS-funded interven-
tions for those with a disability, drug and alco-
hol services and a range of CAMH-relevant
therapeutic services (e.g. family support, child
protection, out-of-home (foster or residential)
care). However, poor integration and diffusion
of accountability across public and private
bodies and NGOs, and across levels of govern-
ment, risk duplication and service inefﬁciencies
while also making the system confusing and dif-
ﬁcult for families to navigate – concerns well
articulated in recent inquiries5 and the NDIS
review.9

Specialist CAMH services
The state and territory government-funded
CAMH services provide multidisciplinary child
and adolescent in-patient and out-patient care,
intensive mobile outreach, acute and urgent crisis
response, triage services, consultation to emer-
gency departments, and specialised programmes
for eating disorders, early psychosis, neurodeve-
lopmental conditions etc., and provide consult-
ation–liaison services when based in paediatric
hospitals/centres. Historically,
the Australian
CAMH model was similar to that in the UK, pro-
viding ongoing intensive, specialised care, but
recently it has shifted the focus to shorter inter-
ventions for severe, complex and crisis-driven
urgent presentations. CAMH services typically
cover less than 1% of under-18-year-olds. This
coverage, and also access to adolescent mental
health in-patient beds, is substantially less than
in comparable countries.10 Australian CAMH
relies on a robust community CAMH service,
with in-patient care being an unusual interven-
tion with varying availability across states. For
example Victoria has 60 adolescent short-term
in-patient beds for a population of 6–7 million,
whereas Tasmania has no in-patient beds and
only limited access to paediatric beds. Although
step-down residential units jointly managed by
NGOs and mental health services are emerging,
including Youth Prevention and Recovery Care
(YPARC) centres and some options for supported
signiﬁcant gaps remain a
residential care,11
challenge.

CAMH workforce
The Australian CAMH workforce consists of psy-
chiatrists; paediatricians; allied health professions,
including clinical psychologists, occupational
therapists and social workers; and nurses. Child
and adolescent psychiatry is a subspecialty of
psychiatry requiring a 2-year training within a
5-year psychiatry fellowship training under the
Royal Australian and New Zealand College of
Psychiatrists (RANZCP).12 Paediatricians deliver
more CAMH services than in comparable coun-
tries, including assessment and management of
attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, autism
and emotional and behavioural problems. Allied
health professionals provide case management
and psychotherapeutic treatments. Considerable
training occurs within state CAMH services, and
the peer workforce, both patient and carer/
parent, is gaining prominence.

Most specialist CAMH services and paediatric
hospitals/centres have university afﬁliations and
conjoint academic–clinical positions with a focus
on research and teaching. Academic child and
adolescent psychiatry has a strong tradition in
Australia, although currently there are signiﬁcant
workforce concerns.

Australia boasts excellent workforce and train-
ing standards, but the current CAMH workforce
shortage is a major challenge. Although there is
a need to increase the workforce size and capacity,
in the interim ensuring that specialist skills are
deployed in the most effective way to those most
in need will enable an accessible, effective, equit-
able and sustainable CAMH care system.
