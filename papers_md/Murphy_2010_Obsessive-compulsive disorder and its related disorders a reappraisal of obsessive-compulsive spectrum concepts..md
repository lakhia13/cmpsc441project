O

bsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  occurs
worldwide, with common features across diverse ethnic
groups and cultures. It affects approximately 2% of the
population and is associated with substantial social, per-
sonal, and work impairment.1,2 In fact, the World Health
Organization identified OCD among the top 20 causes
of years of life lived with disability for 15- to 44-year-
olds.3 Although generally longitudinally stable, OCD is
known  for  its  substantial  heterogeneity,  as  symptom
presentations  and  comorbidity  patterns  can  vary
markedly in different individuals. Moreover, a number
of other psychiatric and neurologic disorders have sim-
ilar phenomenological features, can be comorbid with
OCD, or are sometimes even conceptualized as uncom-
mon presentations of OCD. These include the obsessive
preoccupations and repetitive behaviors found in body
dysmorphic  disorder,  hypochondriasis, Tourette  syn-
drome, Parkinson’s disease, catatonia, autism, and in
some individuals with eating disorders (eg, anorexia
nervosa).4-10 These heterogeneous facets of the disorder
have led to a search for OCD subtypes that might be
associated  with  different  etiologies  or  treatment
responses.

Obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is  a  clinical  syn-
drome whose hallmarks are excessive, anxiety-evoking
thoughts and compulsive behaviors that are generally
recognized as unreasonable, but which cause significant
distress and impairment. When these are the exclusive
symptoms, they constitute uncomplicated OCD. OCD may
also occur in the context of other neuropsychiatric disor-
ders, most commonly other anxiety and mood disorders.
The question remains as to whether these combinations
of  disorders  should  be  regarded  as  independent,  co-
occurring disorders or as different manifestations of an
incompletely understood constellation of OCD spectrum
disorders with a common etiology. Additional considera-
tions are given here to two potential etiology-based sub-
groups: (i) an environmentally based group in which OCD
occurs following apparent causal events such as strepto-
coccal  infections,  brain  injury,  or  atypical  neuroleptic
treatment; and (ii) a genomically based group in which
OCD  is  related  to  chromosomal  anomalies  or  specific
genes. Considering the status of current research, the
concept of OCD and OCD-related spectrum conditions
seems fluid in 2010, and in need of ongoing reappraisal.

Ruminative, obsessional, preoccupying mental agonies
coupled  with  perseverative,  ritualized  compulsion-
resembling behaviors have been depicted in biblical doc-
uments as well as Greek and Shakespearian tragedies.
In modern nosology, a number of different approaches
have been suggested to characterize this syndrome, yet
the question of how best to categorize OCD subgroups
remains under debate in 2010. 
Currently,  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of
Mental  Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) of  the  American
Psychiatric Association, classifies OCD as an anxiety dis-
order. There have, however, been questions raised about
this categorization on the basis of some phenomenolog-
ical differences between OCD and the other anxiety dis-
orders. As such, suggestions have been made that, in the
forthcoming  2012  DSM-5,  OCD  should  be  removed
from its position as one of the six anxiety disorders—a
reformulation still under debate. One solution under dis-
cussion is that OCD should constitute an independent
entity in DSM-5 (ie, remain outside of any larger group-
ing),  congruent  with  its  designation  as  such  in  the 
international  diagnostic  manual,  ICD-10
current 
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems).11-14 An alternative suggestion
would  group  OCD  and  related  disorders  into  a  new
Obsessive-Compulsive  Spectrum  Disorders  (OCSD)
category. The concept of an OCSD classification was first
postulated  over  a  decade  ago.15,16 Later,  the  original
OCSD  concept  was  extended  with  the  proposal  that
OCD and other compulsive disorders may lie along a
larger continuum of corelated compulsive-impulsive dis-
orders.15 Disorders hypothesized at the impulsive end of
this spectrum continuum include pathologic gambling,
nonparaphilic compulsive sexual activity, and others.17,18
A general feature of these proposed impulsive disorders
is that, although they have some repetitive elements,
they  are  generally  egosyntonic  (in  contrast  to  the

egodystonic nature of OCD), often with minimal anxi-
ety and behaviors that are not resisted, and that are usu-
ally associated with pleasure (not with relief as in OCD).
However, the concept of a compulsive-impulsive con-
tinuum has not been widely subscribed to in either a
recent survey of OCD experts or in recent reviews.19,20
Some of the original proponents of the OCSD groupings
and others in the field have softened the stipulations that
implied common underlying etiological components of
the OCSD, to a more general notion of “obsessive-com-
pulsive-related disorders” (OCRD).12 This debate con-
tinues to wax and wane as additional investigations eval-
uate the underpinnings of a putative OCD spectrum.21,22
This review focuses on newer contributions to the OCD
spectrum concept and efforts to subtype OCD. It does
not reiterate already well-evaluated aspects of OCD
spectrum concepts recently published in expert reviews
(eg, refs 12,23-27). Rather, it discusses new data pri-
marily from recent epidemiologic and clinical research,
as well as new quantitative psychological, physiological,
and genetic studies with the aim of reappraising and
developing additional elements related to the OCSDs
and OCRDs. Particular points of emphasis are ques-
tions regarding (i) what OCD phenotypes might be of
value  in  present  and  future  genetic  studies;  and  (ii)
other types of etiological contributions to OCRDs, with,
of  course,  the  ultimate  aim  of  better  treatments  for
OCRDs that might be based on more than our current
descriptive  nosologies.  Our  immediate  hope  in  this
review is to spur additional thoughts as the field moves
towards clarifying how OCD-related disorders might
arise and manifest at the phenomenological and mech-
anistic levels.

What is OCD?

DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR characterizes OCD by the symp-
toms outlined in Table I. It is listed within the Anxiety
Disorder section. The text highlights that if an individ-
ual attempts to resist or delay a compulsion, they can
experience marked increases in anxiety and distress that
are relieved by the rituals.

OCD symptom heterogeneity in individuals

While the core components of OCD (anxiety-evoking
obsessions and repetitive compulsions) are recognizable
as the cardinal features of OCD, the specific content of

these symptoms varies widely. Thus, there is clear evi-
dence that within OCD, there is symptom heterogeneity.
For example, Figure 1 depicts the results of a cluster
analysis of OCD symptoms based on two separate symp-
tom  checklists  for  OCD  (Yale-Brown  Obsessive
Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist (YBOCS) and
the Thoughts  and  Behavior  Inventory  (TBI)  accom-
plished initially using item clusters and subsequently
using individual items from these scales, with essentially

Obsessions are: 
Recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are 
experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and 
inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress
Thoughts, impulses or images that are not simply excessive worries 
about real-life problems
The effort by the affected person to ignore and suppress such 
thoughts, impulses or images, or to neutralize them with some 
other thought or action
Recognition by the affected person that the obsessional thoughts, 
impulses or images are a product of his or her own mind rather 
than imposed from without.
Compulsions are: 
Repetitive activities (eg, handwashing, ordering, checking) or 
mental acts (eg, playing, counting, repeating words silently) that 
the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or 
according to rigid rules that must be applied rigidly
Behavior or mental acts aimed at preventing or reducing distress 
or preventing some dreaded event or situation but either clearly 
excessive or not connecting in a realistic way with what they are 
designed to neutralize or prevent
Recognition, by the affected person (unless he or she is a child), 
at some point during the course of the disorder, that the obsessions 
or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable
Obsessions or compulsion that cause marked distress, are time-
consuming (take more than 1 h/day), or interfere substantially 
with the person’s normal routine, occupational or academic 
functioning, or usual social activities or relationships
Content of the obsessions and compulsions not restricted to any 
other Axis I disorder, such as an obsession with food in the context 
of an eating disorder, that is present
Disturbance not due to the direct physiological effect of a 
substance or a general medical condition

identical  results.29,30 Notable  is  that  there  are  distin-
guishable groupings of symptoms, falling into four major
groupings (yellow components) and that both obsessions
and compulsions of similar types group together. This
clustering is in direct contrast to the current DSM-IV
notation of obsessions “and/or” compulsions. There also
exists an inseparable overlapping of symptom groupings
(blue components), such that despite separable concep-
tual entities, there is an overall merging of these group-
ings on a more hierarchical level.
Many other studies over the last decade have attempted
to reduce the variability of OC symptom groupings in
different populations of OCD patients through factor,
cluster, or latent variable analyses of OCD symptom
inventories. The majority of such studies have found sup-
port for between three to five symptom dimensions,19
with the most commonly identified solution including
four factors: (i) contamination obsessions and cleaning
compulsions;  (ii)  aggressive,  sexual,  religious,  and
somatic obsessions with checking-related compulsions;
(iii) obsessions regarding symmetry, exactness, and the
need for things to be “just right” paired with compul-
sions relating to ordering, arranging, and counting, and
(iv) hoarding obsessions and compulsions. With regard
to these four symptom dimensions, it should be noted
that current debate exists as to whether hoarding should
be considered along with the other core OCD symptoms,
or whether it exists as an independent syndrome often
comorbid with OCD.31-33 We will revisit this issue in a
subsequent section of this review. An additional concern
that has been raised is that in studies of pediatric OCD,
changes in the most prominent symptom patterns have
been  found  over  time.34 In  contrast,  studies  of  adult
OCD populations revealed stability of the most promi-
nent symptom patterns.35,36 This suggests that perhaps
more primary symptom dimensions affecting an indi-
vidual solidify as an individual matures into adulthood.
Family studies, including a sib-pair study, indicate that
there is statistically significant within-family preferential
sharing of symptom types; however, such correlations
are relatively modest.37
Given this literature, there does not seem to be an ade-
quate basis for establishing distinct within-OCD subtypes
based on OC symptoms that, however, might be useful
for distinguishing individuals with OCD for general treat-
ment-directed  investigations.  There  is  one  important
exception with regard to the hoarding subgroup, which
has shown several specific genetic-based and brain imag-

ing-based differences from general OCD groups (eg, refs
38-40). Furthermore, given preliminary research that an
individual’s dominant symptom dimension may in fact be
associated with differential treatment response and func-
tional correlates,41,42 future research into hypothesized
multidimensional models is warranted.
It is also worth mentioning that a different, two-dimen-
sional model of OCD phenomenology has been sug-
gested since Janet’s 1904 reports on 300 patients43; he
highlighted the “anakastic” feature of altered risk assess-
ment (related to the later concepts of harm avoidance or
neuroticism) as well as the sense of “indecision” and
“incompleteness.” Someone suffering from incomplete-

ness was “Continually tormented by an inner sense of
imperfection, connected with the perception that actions
or intentions have been incompletely achieved.” 43 This
phenomenon has relatively recently been “rediscovered”
and seen some empirical study, especially in its narrower
sense of the “not just right”44,45 experience frequently
seen in OCD.46 Although research tools to characterize
patients in this respect remain in development, some
promising work has been reported.47,48 Incompleteness
symptoms may have more affinity for tic-related phe-
nomena  than  those  strictly  encompassed  by  anxiety-
related mechanisms,49 while Janet’s “forced agitations”
were also described by him as mental manias.45

Investigators have additionally attempted to subgroup
OCD patients using specific phenomenological charac-
teristics, such as overall OCD severity, familiality, gen-
der, age of OCD onset, and comorbidity patterns.24,26,29,50-53
There  is  considerable  indication  that  OCD  which
emerges  in  childhood  is  meaningfully  different  from
OCD that occurs later in adulthood, including gender
and comorbidity differences (eg, a higher prevalence of
tic disorders and Tourette syndrome).26,54-56 In addition,
some  have  subgrouped  OCD  on  the  basis  of  the
patients’ insight into the senselessness of their obsessions
and  compulsions.  Some  evidence  suggests  that  OCD
patients  with  poorer  insight  experience  more  severe
symptoms, are less responsive to treatment, and have
more family history of the disorder, though this has not
always been observed.57 Interestingly, hoarding symp-
toms again appear to be distinct from the other OCD
symptoms in this regard, in that hoarders typically evi-
dence less insight.53,58,59
In one latent class analysis of comorbid psychiatric con-
ditions, two OCD subgroups were identified: a dimen-
sional anxiety plus depression class and a panic plus tic
disorder class.60 Another latent class analysis using a
novel latent variable mixture model following a confir-
matory factor analysis of 65 OCD-related items in 398
OCD probands found two statistically significant sepa-
rate OCD subpopulations.30 One group had a signifi-
cantly higher proportion of OCD-affected relatives (ie,
a familial group) and was associated with an earlier age
of OCD onset, more severe OCD symptoms, greater
psychiatric  comorbidity,  and  more  impairment  com-
pared  with  the  second  group.30 However,  because  of
considerable  overlap  among  groups  of  OCD  symp-
toms/dimensions and subgroup composition as identi-
fied by different statistical methods, discrete subgroup
membership for any specific OCD proband is not yet
available.30

OCD and its relationship to the anxiety disorders

At the same time as the field attempts to refine and clar-
ify subtypes within OCD, broader questions about the
disorder have also been asked, with some proposing that
OCD is miscategorized as an anxiety disorder.61 Some
have suggested that OCD bears more in common with
other disorders categorized by repetitive thoughts and
behaviors, and should be moved to a new category of
disorders including OCSDs and OCRDs. This proposal

requires  elucidation  of  what  constitutes  the  core  of
OCD: anxiety, obsessions, or repetitive behaviors. It is of
note that, under the key features of OCD described in
DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR anxiety, as a feature is mentioned
just once. 
Nonetheless,  many  studies  of  OCD,  and  particularly
investigations of OCD treatment that used quantitative
self- and observer ratings, have documented very high
anxiety ratings in individuals with untreated OCD. The
levels  of  these  anxiety  ratings  were  as  high  or  even
higher than those reported in similar studies of panic dis-
order, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and
specific phobias. Thus, for the present time, OCD’s close
affinity with other disorders characterized by high anx-
iety would suggest that it remain under this categoriza-
tion, unless it becomes recognized as a distinctly sepa-
rate diagnostic entity in DSM-5, as noted above.14,62,63

OCD and its relationship to mood disorders

Some proponents of moving OCD from its categoriza-
tion as an anxiety disorder have suggested that, at its
core, OCD is an affective disorder. In fact, depressive
features are common in OCD and major depressive dis-
order is the single most frequently comorbid disorder in
OCD probands (Table II). Cumulatively, mood disorders
occur in 50% to 90% of OCD probands (not taking into
account individuals with overlapping mood diagnoses)
(Table II). However, some have found that depressive
symptoms most typically emerge following OCD onset,
perhaps, it is speculated, as a consequence of long-term
anxiety, stresses, and functional impairment associated
with OCD symptoms.64 A special comorbid relationship
has been noted between OCD and bipolar I and II dis-
orders,1,65,66 also raising the question of a cyclothymic
form of OCD.67 As with the affective disorders, modu-
lating  factors  that  seem  to  affect  the  expression  and
some features of OCD include gender and degree of
insight into symptoms.53,67,68
It is important to note that, although across OCD groups
there exist patterns of frequent comorbidity with other
anxiety, mood and other disorders, an “uncomplicated”
noncomorbid OCD presentation has nonetheless been
documented.69,70 This group, comprising ~10% of OCD
probands  in  several  studies,  represents  a  relatively
understudied entity,71,72 despite some indications that
“uncomplicated” OCD may be of high value in refining
the question of “What is OCD?”

OCD: its relationship to OCD-comorbid 
disorders as part of a description-based 
OCD spectrum

The original conceptualization of the OCD spectrum:
considerations of symptomatology

Although there are a number of different approaches
and considerations with regard to OCD spectrum disor-
ders, we first present one prevalent view that the spec-
trum consists of disorders with diverse phenomenologi-

cal features, but which share commonalities that tie them
together. Figure 2 provides a depiction of the original
and modified groupings of OCSD and OCRD disorders,
including  notation  of  other  disorders  considered  by
some as part of a compulsive-impulsive spectrum group
of disorders. Some re-evaluations of these relationships
have been published recently,12,19,21,27,61,73-75 and reflect the
ongoing  debate  about  genetic  and  environmentally-
shaped, neurodevelopmental elements related to OCD
onset that also may impact the future status of OCD in
DSM-5.

Table II indicates the frequency of comorbid disorders
found in adult probands with OCD compared with the
incidence of these disorders in the general US popula-
tion. As is evident, two- to sixfold higher prevalence
rates of most psychiatric disorders are found in individ-
uals with OCD. Most striking are the high frequencies of
all anxiety disorders taken together, and likewise, all
affective disorders. Also of interest are the lack of dif-
ferences in alcohol-related and substance abuse disor-
ders between those with OCD and the general US pop-
ulation.  Specific  symptomatologic 
that
potentially may be useful for grouping OCD into more
homogeneous  and  familial  phenotypes  for  etiologic
investigations include those of comorbid tic, affective,
anxiety and the other disorders listed, as well as obses-
sive-compulsive personality disorder. 
An example of one OCD-comorbid disorder (not listed
in Table II but recently identified as a potential OCRD
disorder)  is  attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder
(ADHD).80,81 While some of the original OCD comorbid
spectrum disorders remain in this grouping simply on
the  basis  of  consistent  co-occurrence  with  OCD  in
descriptive samplings or overlapping features, others

features 

such  as ADHD  have  been  validated  via  segregation
analysis. In evaluations of the OCD-ADHD relationship,
relatives  of  probands  with  both  disorders  have  been
found to have a significantly higher frequency of OCD
plus ADHD compared with the relatives of probands
with ADHD only.80,81

Apparent environmental etiology-based OCD-related
disorders

Three examples of full-blown OCD occurring appar-
ently acutely de novo following putative causal events
include: (i) OCD related to an infection such as that
associated  with  streptococcal  infections  (pediatric
autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with
streptococcal  infections  [PANDAS]  syndrome);  (ii)
trauma-related OCD following acute brain injuries; and
(iii) OCD occurrence during treatment of schizophrenia
with atypical neuroleptic agents. These would seem to
constitute an etiologically-based OCD subtype, since
most cases of primary, idiopathic OCD have an insidious
onset  with  a  gradual  development  of  symptoms  and
impairment over a longer timeline of months or years.

OCD and infections: the example of PANDAS 
syndrome

A potential environmental contributor to the develop-
ment of OCD, particularly in childhood, is a suspected
relationship between group A streptococcal infections
and onset of OCD and/or tics/Tourette syndrome, akin
to the development of Sydenham’s chorea reported pre-
viously following streptococcal infection.82-84 In fact, an
increased  prevalence  of  obsessive-compulsive  symp-
toms85-87 and OCD88 has also been noted in patients with
rheumatic  fever  (RF)  with  or  without  Sydenham’s
chorea. Initially, these findings were reported in children
during an active phase of rheumatic fever.88 Subsequent
studies revealed the presence of OCSDs in adults with
a previous history of rheumatic fever (not active), sug-
gesting  that  the  streptococcal  infection  may  trigger
OCD, which may persist throughout life regardless of
the  activity  of  the  rheumatic  fever.85,86 Recent  family
studies have reported that OCSDs and OCRDs (such as
tic disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, trichotilloma-
nia, grooming behaviors, and others) aggregate more
frequently in first-degree relatives of rheumatic fever
probands when compared with controls.89,90 Moreover,
two polymorphisms of the promoter region of the tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene have been associ-
ated with both OCD and rheumatic fever, which is an
interesting finding since the TNF-α gene is a proinflam-
matory cytokine involved in rheumatic fever and several
other  autoimmune  diseases,91,92 suggesting  that  both
obsessive-compulsive related disorders and rheumatic
fever share a common genetic vulnerability.
Thus,  PANDAS  OCD  could  be  a  mild  expression  of
rheumatic fever whose incidence is higher in developing
countries, while the full development of rheumatic fever-
related disorders may be attenuated by the appropriated
antibiotic prophylaxis in developed countries. Consistent
with this hypothesis, there was a higher family history of
rheumatic fever in PANDAS OCD patients. Thus, abnor-
mal immune response to this streptococcal infection,
with abnormal antibody production leading to basal gan-
glia damage has been focused upon as a likely mecha-
nism for both rheumatic fever and PANDAS OCD.52,93,94
This proposed mechanism is supported by behavioral
changes and brain lesion development in mice following
immunization with streptococcal antigens,95 with resem-
blances to similar studies investigating immune mecha-
nisms in Sydenham’s chorea.83

Abnormal brain autoantibody production may itself be
mediated by specific genetic factors, posing a possible
gene X environment (G x E) pathogenesis for a PAN-
DAS subgroup. However, a puzzling anomaly potentially
reflecting a different possible G x E interaction, or even
a confound to the importance of streptococcal infections
and autoantibodies in OCD, is that OCD patients with
suspected  PANDAS  had  an  equal  number  of  OCD-
affected  relatives  as  the  non-PANDAS  comparison
OCD population.96 Some recent reviews have concluded
that the relationship between strep infections and OCD
may  be  indirect  and  complex  and  thus “elusive,”  97-99
although other controlled studies continue to support an
association.100
Besides streptococcal infections and PANDAS, there are
interesting examples of other apparent infection-related
OCD development. Both bacterial and viral infections
have been noted to be associated with acute OCD onset,
including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, varicella, toxoplas-
mosis,  Borna  disease  virus,  Behcet’s  syndrome,  and
encephalitis, with some infections accompanied by striatal
and other brain region lesions.101-106 In some cases, marked
OCD symptoms subsided with antibiotic treatment.

Onset of OCD and/or hoarding after acute traumatic
brain injury and in association with other types of 
neuropathology

A number of reports have described new onset of OCD
in previously healthy individuals who suffered docu-
mented brain injury, usually after accidents (reviews: refs
45,107-109). Besides OCD, other psychiatric disorders
that follow brain injuries have been documented in epi-
demiologic studies.110 In one of these, which retrospec-
tively  evaluated  5034  individuals  among  whom  361
(8.5% weighted average) reported a history of brain
trauma with loss of consciousness or confusion, lifetime
prevalence was significantly increased (P<0.03–0.0001)
for  many  disorders,  including  OCD,  compared  with
those without head injuries. An odds ratio of 2.1 was
reported for OCD, representing a greater than twofold
increase of the occurrence of OCD compared with con-
trols without head injuries, after corrections for age, gen-
der, marital status and socioeconomic status.110 Of note,
although similar odds ratios have been found for major
depression and panic disorder, rates of schizophrenia or
bipolar disorder were not increased in this sample of
individuals with brain trauma.110

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 12 . No. 2 . 2010

Some case report series noted acute onset of OCD within
a  day  to  a  few  months  following  traumatic  brain
injury.107,111,112 One of three studies documented a typical
array of OCD symptoms using YBOCS ratings; a subgroup
of patients had the generally unusual symptom of “obses-
sional slowness.” 107 Compared with matched controls, the
patients with post-brain injury OCD symptoms had poorer
performance on an array of cognitive measures, including
executive functions. Also, the patients with the most severe
traumatic brain injury had more frequent abnormal mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) exams involving the fron-
totemporal cortex and the caudate nucleus.107 Some of these
reports specifically emphasized the lack of prior personal
or familial OCD symptoms or diagnoses. 
Smaller survey studies of post-brain injury patients with
Ns of 100 or less and using various types of diagnostic
evaluations, some quite brief, have infrequently noted
cases  of  OCD,  although  OCD  symptoms  have  been
reported as present in other types of brain disorders,
including surgery for seizure disorders and carbon diox-
ide poisoning, as well as brain tumors and stroke lesions
the  cortico-striato-pallido-
affecting  portions  of 
thalamic circuits.109,113 OCD and OC symptoms have also
been associated with other neurological disorders and
neuropathology found in Parkinson’s disease, posten-
cephalopathic disorders, and other brain disorders.114,115
Influenced in part by the literature that focal injury to
the basal ganglia was associated with OCD emergence,
we recently observed an MRI abnormality suggesting
elevated iron deposition in the globus pallidus in OCD
patients whose symptom onset was from around ado-
lescence to early adulthood.116 This initial result adds to
the literature suggesting that age of onset is likely to be
an important consideration in attempts to separate OCD
into etiologically meaningful subgroups. Age of onset
may also be an important variable in regard to the repet-
itive-compulsive OC traits and OCD itself which are
well documented in conjunction with autism spectrum
disorders, including Asperger's syndrome.117,118

Apparent acute new onset of OCD in patients with
schizophrenia during treatment with atypical 
antipsychotic medications

One recently-recognized OCD-related disorder is atyp-
ical  neuroleptic-related  OCD,  as  reported  in  schizo-
phrenic  patients  successfully  treated  with  clozapine,
ritanserin, and other newer neuroleptic agents.119-122 Some

have suggested that this syndrome represents OCD-like
symptoms induced by the atypical neuroleptics—ie, a
drug side effect. Others subscribe to the hypothesis that
suppression of overt and more dominant psychotic symp-
toms by clozapine and other atypical neuroleptics unveils
coexisting OCD, permitting diagnosis. The latter would
be in accord with some suggestions from earlier studies
that reported as many as 5% to 20%, or more of indi-
viduals with schizophrenia have comorbid OCD.123-125 It
seems more studies are required to evaluate these two
somewhat opposing views of this syndrome.
Of note, other detrimental, traumatic life events of a psy-
chological or social nature have been associated with
OCD with different possible implications. For instance,
one study compared patients with OCD plus post-trau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) who developed OCD after
clinically significant trauma (designated “post-traumatic
OCD”)  to  general  OCD  patients  in  terms  of  socio-
demographic and clinical features. Compared with gen-
eral OCD patients, “Post-traumatic OCD” presented
several phenotypic differences such as: later age at onset
of obsessions; increased rates of some obsessive-com-
pulsive dimensions (such as aggressive and symmetry
features); increased rates of mood, anxiety, impulse-con-
trol and tic disorders; greater “suicidality and severity of
depressive and anxiety symptoms; and a more frequent
family history of PTSD, major depressive disorder and
generalized anxiety disorder.” 79,126 One study of a treat-
ment-resistant OCD subgroup found that all subjects
who met formal criteria for OCD and comorbid PTSD
had PTSD onset that preceded OCD onset.127
What is there to make of this diversity of antecedent
events suggested to trigger typical OCD? One concept,
elaborated below, is that severe acute or more chronic
stresses that impact executive (or “ego”) functions may
elicit a kind of regression to or activation of less goal-ori-
ented but more simplified, ritual-based action patterns
that may act to prevent further disorganization of the
self.128,129 In this view, OCD “strategies” and symptoms
may provide a common pattern of behaviors that are of
advantage  in  the  short  term,  but  which  may  become
deleterious if sustained beyond the time of stress.

Putative chromosomal or gene-based, genomic 
OCD-related disorders

At present, studies of possible genetic contributions to
OCD  and  OCSD  remain  quite  limited.  Apart  from

S t a t e   o f   t h e   a r t

investigations  of  specific  candidate  genes  and  gene-
related syndromes, as noted below, the greatest effort in
the last decade has been directed towards genome-wide
linkage and, more recently, genome-wide association
studies that are primarily based upon groups of individ-
uals with DSM-IV-diagnosed OCD without concern for
OCD-related subgroups. As reviewed previously and in
this same issue, there have been several recent evalua-
tions of genetic contributions to OCD.130-133 In addition,
specific investigations of some candidate genes have
been subject to meta-analysis with positive results, eg,
the  SLC6A4 (serotonin  transporter  gene)  polymor-
phisms,134 plus positive results from investigations of rare
variants in SLC6A4 (review in ref 135). 
However, in large part these reviews and evaluations of spe-
cific genes have not gone beyond generic OCD to address
possible associations with OCD spectrum disorders. One
notable exception deserves comment. Among five positive
studies of variants in SLC1A1 (the neuronal glutamate trans-
porter gene), one study reported separable results for dif-
ferent  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  associated  with
overall OCD from associations of a novel 5’-prime region
variant (that was not found in the overall OCD sample) with
hoarding compulsions.39 This is reminiscent of the report of
different patterns of associations with hoarding compulsions
compared to associations with overall OCD or with Tourette
syndrome for chromosomal regions in genome linkage stud-
ies.38,136 In one of these studies, those with OCD plus hoard-
ing exhibited a novel peak on chromosome 14; likewise, in a
subgroup of individuals with OCD but from which the indi-
viduals with hoarding had been deleted, the peak on chro-
mosome 3q became more distinct.38,137
In keeping with these results, prior studies from differ-
ent vantage points have suggested that individuals with
OCD and hoarding might differ from others with OCD
without hoarding, and that hoarding itself might repre-
sent  a  separate  syndrome  within  the  OCRDs.31,32
Providing further support for this notion, brain imaging
results have indicated that individuals with OCD have
distinctly different patterns of cerebral glucose utiliza-
tion from nonhoarding OCD patients.40 Additionally,
hoarding is more frequent in the first-degree relatives of
hoarding  probands,  and  hoarding  is  associated  with
other biological and gender differences.31,33,37,68,71,138-141
Thus, with only a few interesting exceptions, the chro-
mosomal regions discovered in the genome-wide link-
age studies of OCD as possibly harboring OCD-related
genes  are  relevant  only  to  OCD  in  general,  without

much attention to OCD diversity and heterogeneity, or
with regard to other OCSDs. The same is true for those
studies focusing on a single candidate gene. One other
exception of possible future interest in regard to likely
gene-related subgroupings is age of OCD onset.137

Common gene variants plus rare gene and genetic 
syndromes associated with OCD and OCD/Tourette
syndrome subgroups and/or OCD-related disorders

Uncommon chromosomal anomalies and both rare and
common  gene  variants  have  come  under  increasing
scrutiny in OCD and OCD-related or OCD-comorbid
disorders.  Several  uncommon  chromosomal  region
abnormalities that are associated with multiple pheno-
types have been found to include individuals with OCD.
Thus, OCD diagnoses have been made in individuals
with the 22q11 microdeletion syndrome (also known as
velocardiofacial syndrome).142-145 In one comprehensive
study that used the YBOCS scale together with psychi-
atric interviews in evaluating a VCSF clinic sample, 33%
received an OCD diagnosis.142
OCD has also been diagnosed in some individuals with
the myoclonus dystonic syndrome related to chromo-
some 7q.146-149 In one study of three extended myoclonus
dystonic syndrome families, OCD meeting direct inter-
view-based DSM-IV criteria was present in 25% (4/16)
of symptomatic myoclonus dystonia syndrome carriers
with the 7q21 haplotype, but in only 9% (1/11) of non-
symptomatic carriers and 0% (0/28) of the nonhaploytpe
carriers.146 This is of special interest because its 7q21-q31
locus is near the chromosomal anomalies described in
other individuals with OCD or Tourette syndrome but
without the myoclonus dystonic syndrome who have
anomalies in chromosome regions 7q31 and 7q35-36.150-152
Additionally,  a  family-based  association  study  using
markers in the 7q31 region demonstrated biased trans-
mission  of  these  marker  alleles  in  individuals  with
comorbid Tourette syndrome, OCD, and ADHD.153
For the 22q11 and 7q variants, insufficient data exist for
OCD, OCD spectrum disorders like other dystonias,154-157
and possibly related disorders like autism spectrum dis-
order to draw firm conclusions as to how these different
disorders might be related. However, these findings from
uncommon chromosomal regions and rare genes suggest
distinct and different etiologies for an OCD phenotype
that may represent a type of OCD spectrum disorder, ie,
a genomic group of OCSDs. For example, as noted above,

one common candidate gene, SLC1A1, manifested a vari-
ant associated with complex hoarding, while different
variants were strongly associated with OCD in general.135

Discussion: what might be common 
elements that could contribute to 
OCD spectrum disorders?

The relationships among OCD comorbid disorders
and additional OCD spectrum disorders: old and new
postulated groupings

From an overview perspective, OCD remains as a distinct
clinical entity, with classic symptoms and behaviors involv-
ing obsessions and compulsions plus high anxiety and,
over the lifetime, the occurrence of mood and other anx-
iety disorders. OCD differs from the other anxiety disor-
ders by its earlier age of onset, more complex comorbid-
ity, and severity of obsessional thoughts and compulsive
behaviors. OCD as defined in DSM-IV/IV-TR also occurs
concomitantly with other DSM-defined disorders ranging
from body dysmorphic disorder, Tourette syndrome, eat-
ing disorders, and autism spectrum disorders,118 as well as

multiple other disorders. Individuals with these other pri-
mary disorders may have separately defined OCD meet-
ing full criteria. There seem to be two views about this
overlap: (i) All of these disorders together constitute an
OCD spectrum group, with implications that they are all
manifestations of a single OC-based entity; or (ii) each
may be an independent coexisting disorder. For some
individual patients, it may be that a mixture of both may
be operative for different components of these disorders.
Thus,  the  relationship  among  OCD-related  disorders
remains uncertain. 
We have noted that a number of other disorders have
sometimes been named in an extended list of OCD spec-
trum disorders (Figure 2) such as the impulsive disor-
ders; however we will not discuss them further, as their
association to OCD is tenuous and not acknowledged by
most experienced clinicians and researchers or recent
reviews.19 On the other hand, we have explicitly added
two additional groupings of OCD-related disorders that
are not based on descriptive nosology, but rather on eti-
ologic considerations (Figure 3). One of these links acute
OCD onset to environmental events such as the conse-
quences of infection, traumatic brain injury, and other
neurological disease insults. The other newly suggested
OCD spectrum encompasses etiologies related to spe-
cific gene or narrow chromosome region-related syn-
dromes—a fourth genomic OCD-related group. Some of
this latter group also overlaps with disorders such as
Tourette syndrome, with its common tripartite combi-
nation of tic disorders, OCD, and ADHD. It is of inter-
est  that  some  considerations  for  DSM-5 and  future
DSMs are  beginning  to  show  additional  elements
beyond clinical symptoms as bases for designation of an
entity. These include biological, psychophysiological, and
brain imaging data as well as potential etiological factors
including genetic elements and brain neurocircuitry con-
tributions.6,12,14,19,22,25-26

Evaluations of treatment responses and familiality of
treatment responses as possible bases for OCD-related
subgroups

Like OCD, many of the OCD-related spectrum disor-
ders respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs),
which some have used as evidence for an association
between these conditions. However, given that individ-
uals with these disorders often suffer from comorbid dis-
orders that also respond to SRIs (eg, major depressive

disorder and other anxiety disorders), as well as the fact
that many other neuropsychiatric and medical disorders
with no postulated relationship to OCD also respond to
SRI  treatment,  this  treatment  responsivity  seems
patently  a  weak  hypothesis.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is
notable that many anxiety disorders, but not OCD, ben-
efit from monotherapy with other types of anxiolytic
agents such as benzodiazepines.
Psychological treatments with specificity for OCD pro-
vide a more discriminating test for grouping disorders
together based on treatment response. Exposure and
Ritual Prevention (ERP) is one treatment of choice for
OCD, and several studies have demonstrated that body
dysmorphic disorder and hypochondriasis also respond
to psychological treatments incorporating elements of
ERP. Worthy of additional study would be comparative
examination of whether nonresponse to other antide-
pressants compared with anxiolytics such as benzodi-
azepines might characterize subgroups of these other
OCD-related disorders. Data from such approaches are
sparse, with very few head-to-head studies like those
done in OCD of SRIs versus norepinephrine transporter
inhibitors such as desipramine or drugs affecting other
neurotransmitter systems that have been reported (eg,
ref 158). 
Likewise, while there is evidence for some features of
OCD to exhibit family-based relationships in treatment
responses, as recently reviewed,26 similar data are very
meager for OCD-related disorders other than major
depression. Thus, these notions have not yet been ade-
quately explored across more than a handful of disor-
ders related to OCD to provide an adequate treatment-
based subcategorization of these disorders or to provide
a common understanding of them.

Additional approaches to understanding OCSDs and
OCRDs: brain imaging studies, putative 
endophenotypes (including neuropsychological and
neurophysiologic measures) and hints from animal
models

Brain imaging investigations of OCD patients have only
relatively recently been expanded to include some sub-
groups such as body dysmorphic disorder and compul-
sive  hoarding.  Specific  investigations  have  included
positron emission tomography (PET) studies of glucose
utilization and MRI-based volumetric studies of com-
ponents of the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuits

most implicated in OCD. Another approach has been
PET studies using specific ligands and magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy-based studies of specific brain chem-
icals to evaluate receptor and transporter elements of
neurotransmitter signaling pathways.159,160
Most studies thus far have endeavored to compare OCD
patients with controls, or occasionally other neuropsy-
chiatric patient groups, or pre- and post-treatment com-
parisons. There has been a decided lack of investigations
considering the OCD-related disorders. Expense, diffi-
culty, and time limit the numbers of individuals that can
be studied, and thus there are only a very few studies of
OCD subgroups, such as one comparing OCD patients
with and without hoarding40 and studies comparing the
symptom  dimensions  of  OCD.161 A  similar  situation
exists for psychological and physiological measures or
endophenotypes and for animal models, all of which are
at the stage of mostly searching for relevant measures
for OCD phenotypes.162-164
One rodent model, which documented changes in micro-
neuroanatomical structures in pathways that were asso-
ciated with shifts from normal goal-directed behaviors
to more limited, habit-based “compulsive” behaviors fol-
lowing multiple types of chronic stressors would seem of
relevance to environmental trauma and stress as dis-
cussed above regarding the genesis of an environmental
OCD spectrum.128 Conceptually, combinations of stresses
(from the environment such as psychological traumatic
events and from disease-based etiologies such as neuro-
logic disorders or comorbid anxiety, mood, or other neu-
ropsychiatric  disorders),  plus  genetic  vulnerabilities
might be envisaged as combining to lead towards tem-
porarily adaptive OCD-related thoughts and behaviors
that  limit  further  nonadaptive  disorganization. Their
continuation, however, past the times of most marked
stress, may become nonadaptive— a sustained reduction
in  abilities  to  act  towards  more  adaptive,  social,  and
occupational goal-directed functions. Prior clinical data
and theoretical formulations have led to some similar
suggestions resembling this interpretation and applica-
tion to OCD of this experimental animal model.128

Conclusions

Thus, we are left with a multifaceted array of obsessive-
compulsive features that cut across traditional (DSM-
IV/TR) as well as draft plans for the DSM-5. Before
elaborating what comprises OCSD and OCRD, it seems

important to consider “uncomplicated,” OCD, as such
individuals may be important to study for many pur-
poses and comparisons.69,70 For example, if our current
nosologic  distinctions  retain  some  validity,  detailed
knowledge of uncomplicated OCD may help to clarify
which genes are more directly OCD-related when coex-
isting mood, anxiety, and other groupings of comorbid
disorders and their underlying genes are also present.
However,  even  uncomplicated  OCD  demonstrates
symptom heterogeneity, leading to continuing efforts
such as using latent class modeling to go beyond factor
and cluster analyses in order to parse the condition into
more  valid  groups.  Considering  underlying  features,
stressors and the other environmental contribution to
symptoms may be additional factors to consider in these
investigations.
In view of the present diagnostic scheme, there is some
consensus that entities such as body dysmorphic disor-
der, hypochondriasis, and obsessive-compulsive person-
ality disorder share the highest apparent phenotypic
overlap with OCD. At the same time, the most com-
monly occurring disorders comorbid with an OCD diag-
nosis are anxiety and mood disorders, especially major
depressive disorder and dysthymia, and even bipolar dis-
order.165 Another interesting connection with additional
disorders arises from segregation, and other analyses
that have shown that ADHD and bipolar disorder occur
in OCD and the families of OCD probands as frequently
as these disorders occur in family studies of each of the
primary  disorders, ADHD,  and  bipolar  disorder.71,80,81
Thus it is apparent that OCD does co-occur with a wide
variety of disorders, and certainly some share enough in
common to be considered OCD-related.
The search for OCD subtypes and spectrum conditions
over the past 15 years has sought to clarify the constella-
tion of features associated with OCD, but has proved to be
a monumental task, sometimes beset by false paths and
perhaps spurious associations such as the suggestion of an
impulsive-compulsive continuum and a range of problems
only very distantly resembling OCD (eg, Figure 2, lower
right).  Recently,  however,  efforts  have  been  made  to
emphasize shared underlying mechanisms and etiologies.
For example we have reviewed two examples of etiologi-
cally based OCD presentations that could comprise new
OCD-related  disorder  groupings.  Another  avenue  of
approach is the weaving together of model approaches
from experimental (eg, brain imaging) and genetic mod-
els, combined with more detailed empirical studies of the

phenotypical heterogeneity of individuals with OCD and
similar disorders.129,164,166,167 With recent advances from ongo-
ing clinical investigations and other research, the state of
OCD and OCD-related spectrum disorders is evolving
rapidly, with many interesting new developments, as elab-
orated in a surge of recent publications. It is to be hoped
that, together, this work will result in an etiologically based

A new look at the “OCD spectrum” question - Murphy et al

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 12 . No. 2 . 2010

El trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo y sus 
trastornos relacionados: una reevaluación 
de los conceptos del espectro obsesivo-
compulsivo

El trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo (TOC) es un sín-
drome  clínico  cuyo  sello  distintivo  son  los  pensa-
mientos desmedidos que provocan ansiedad y con-
ductas compulsivas, los cuales habitualmente no son
reconocidos como razonables, pero que causan un
distrés y un deterioro significativos. Cuando éstos son
los síntomas exclusivos, constituyen un TOC no com-
plicado. El TOC también puede presentarse en el con-
texto de otras patologías neuropsiquiátricas, princi-
palmente en otros trastornos ansiosos y del ánimo.
La pregunta que persiste es si acaso estas combina-
ciones de trastornos deben considerarse como cua-
dros independientes, trastornos que co-ocurren o
como manifestaciones diferentes de  una constela-
ción parcialmente comprendida de los trastornos del
espectro del TOC con una etiología común. También
se entregan consideraciones adicionales para dos
subgrupos según sus potenciales bases etiológicas: 1)
un grupo de base ambiental en el cual el TOC ocurre
a continuación de acontecimientos aparentemente
causales como las infecciones por estreptococo, el
daño cerebral o el tratamiento con neurolépticos atí-
picos y 2) un grupo de base genómica en que el TOC
se relaciona con anomalías cromosómicas o de genes
específicos.  Considerando  el  estado  actual  de  la
investigación, parece fácil de manejar el concepto de
TOC y de las condiciones del espectro relacionado
con el TOC en 2010, pero requiere de una reevalua-
ción permanente.

Trouble obsessionnel-compulsif et troubles
associés : réévaluation du concept de spectre
obsessionnel-compulsif

Le trouble obsessionnel-compulsif (TOC) est un syn-
drome clinique caractérisé par des comportements
compulsifs  et  des  pensées  excessives  à  type
d’anxiété, généralement reconnus comme dérai-
sonnables, causant une souffrance et un handicap
significatifs. Quand ces symptômes sont les seuls,
on parle de TOC non compliqué. Mais le TOC peut
également  survenir  dans  le  contexte  d’autres
troubles  neuropsychiatriques,  plus  couramment
dans  le  cadre  d'autres  troubles  anxieux  ou  de
troubles de l’humeur. Il reste à savoir si ces troubles
doivent  être  considérés  comme  indépendants,
simultanés  ou  comme  des  manifestations  diffé-
rentes d’une constellation incomplètement com-
prise de troubles du spectre du TOC avec une étio-
logie commune. Cet article propose des réflexions
supplémentaires sur deux sous-groupes éventuels
d’origine étiologique : 1) un groupe d’origine envi-
ronnementale dans lequel le TOC survient après
des événements  apparemment causaux comme
une infection streptococcique, une lésion cérébrale
ou un traitement neuroleptique atypique ; et 2) un
groupe d’origine génomique dans lequel le TOC
est lié à des anomalies chromosomiques ou à des
gènes spécifiques. Au stade actuel de la recherche,
le concept de TOC et de trouble du spectre obses-
sionnel compulsif semble flou en 2010 et nécessite
une réévaluation.
