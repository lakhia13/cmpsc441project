Introduction

Alcohol has been consumed by humans and non-human animals for as long as we have 
historical records, with earliest evidence of human alcohol consumption dating back to 
7000 BC1. Paleogenetic analyses have identified that a mutation in the enzyme alcohol 
dehydrogenase class 4 (AHD4), which improved primates’ ability to metabolize alcohol, 
first appeared over 10 million years ago2. In present day, alcohol is the most commonly used 
psychoactive substance worldwide. Data from 2017 indicate 47% of the world population 
are current drinkers of alcohol, and the adult per-capita consumption of alcohol is estimated 
at 6.5 liters of per alcohol per adult3.

Given the high level of consumption worldwide, it follows that alcohol use disorder (AUD) 
is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, globally. Recent estimates of global 
lifetime prevalence of AUD has been estimated at 8.6%4 (range: 3.8% to 97.1% within 
individual countries). There are also tremendous human and social costs of AUD. More than 
3 million people die annually worldwide due to causes related to alcohol, and alcohol is 
attributable to 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury5.

One of the many factors that has contributed to the burden of harmful alcohol use and 
AUD worldwide is the lack of treatment access and very low rates of seeking treatment 
for alcohol-related problems. The majority of individuals who engage in harmful alcohol 
use and those with AUD will never seek treatment6 with recent estimates of 17.3% of 
individuals with AUD worldwide receiving AUD treatment services and even lower rates in 
lower and middle income countries7. The primary reasons for not seeking treatment include 
not wanting to stop drinking, lack of access to treatment, and concerns about stigma6.

Given high rates of AUD and lack of treatment, it is not surprising that alcohol-associated 
liver disease (ALD) is also a prevalent and costly disease. Previously thought of as a disease 
of older, white males, recent changes have demonstrated a marked and disproportionate 
increase in ALD in younger people, females, and some minoritized racial and ethnic groups. 
While overall ALD prevalence is approximately 8.1% in the United States, the prevalence 
of more severe forms of ALD has risen disproportionately over time, with an increase 
in more advanced ALD from 2.2% to 6.6% from 2001 to 20168. In the United States, 
cirrhosis-related mortality increased 65% from 1999 to 2016 and was driven almost entirely 
by ALD9. The most severe form of ALD, alcohol-associated hepatitis, which carries a 
30-50% mortality rate at 6 months, has also increased in recent years, particularly during 
the COVID-19 pandemic which saw a 60% increase in waitlisting and transplants for 
alcohol-associated hepatitis10,11. Increased alcohol use, especially amongst females and 
young people, has fueled the rising ALD rates. Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease 
(MASLD), a liver disease similar to ALD histologically, occurs in the presence of the 
metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and results in synergistic 
damage to the liver10. Liver disease from both alcohol use and metabolic syndrome has been 
termed MetALD12, and rising rates of metabolic syndrome and obesity in the United States 
are almost certainly contributing to the increase in MetALD.

Diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder

The diagnosis of AUD has shifted substantially over the past 74 years. The first edition 
of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the 
American Psychiatric Association in 195213 described “alcoholism” within a broader 
classification of Sociopathic Personality Disorder. The second edition of the DSM, 
published in 196814, included text descriptions for problems caused by alcohol use that were 
divided into three categories: alcohol dependence, episodic excessive drinking, and habitual 
excessive drinking. In the 1970s Feighner15 and Spitzer16 published diagnostic criteria for 
the disease of “alcoholism” based on observational research studies to inform research and 
practice17. The third and fourth editions of the DSM would take a similar approach of 
creating diagnostic categories based on symptoms, with the designation of alcohol abuse and

alcohol dependence as separate diagnostic categories18,19. In 2013, the fifth edition of the 
DSM was published20 and AUD was considered a single diagnosis, based on endorsing two 
or more of eleven criteria (see Figure 1) measuring impaired control over alcohol use, social 
and occupational impairment from drinking, alcohol use that causes harm, and physiological 
consequences of heavy drinking. DSM-5 also added a severity continuum based on the 
number of criteria endorsed such that individuals can now be classified as mild (2-3 criteria), 
moderate (4-5 criteria), or severe (6 or more criteria).

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), published by the World Health 
Organization, has followed a similar trajectory as the DSM. The diagnosis of alcohol 
dependence in ICD-1121 changed from prior versions of the ICD and also was a point 
of departure from the 11 criteria of DSM-5, as shown in Figure 1, with only three diagnostic 
features and at least two required for a diagnosis: impaired control over alcohol use, 
alcohol interferes with life and often continues despite problems, and physiological features 
indicative of neuroadaptations to alcohol22. ICD-11 has better concordance with earlier 
versions of the ICD and DSM-IV, and DSM-5 may be inclusive of a larger group of people 
with problems related to alcohol23.

Harmful alcohol use.

Alcohol use occurs across a spectrum. As alcohol use increases in quantity and frequency 
so does the risk of developing or worsening medical conditions (e.g. liver disease), mental 
health problems, and AUD. Heavy alcohol use is also more likely to lead to acute health 
risks such as accidents and injuries. These harms from alcohol use increase in a dose 
dependent fashion. For this reason, alcohol-related harm or risk is typically defined as the 
quantity and frequency of standard drinks consumed over a given time interval (e.g. average 
standard drinks a day in the past month).

In the United States, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) 
defines harmful alcohol use as having more than 4 (males)/3 (females) drinks on any day 
or more than 14 (males)/7 (females) standard drinks per week. Another useful definition 
that takes into account a broader spectrum of alcohol risk is The World Health Organization 
(WHO) risk drinking levels24. The WHO defines four sex-specific levels of drinking risk, 
based on average grams of alcohol consumed per day (g/d), that correspond to low (1-40 
g/d males; 1-20 g/d females), medium (41-60 g/d males; 21-40 g/d females), high (61-100 
g/d males; 41-60 g/d females) or very high risk (> 100 g/d males; > 60 g/d for females). 
Corresponding conversions of these cut-offs to standard drinks in the United States and other 
countries for these cut-offs are available and shown in Table 1. The WHO risk drinking 
levels provide a clinically meaningful and validated endpoint, and reduction in WHO risk 
level is associated with improvements in health and liver functioning making it a useful 
metric in clinical care25-27.

Drinking reductions should be encouraged among all individuals, however even very low 
levels of alcohol use can incur increased risk of morbidity and mortality, and there is no 
current amount of alcohol use that is considered safe. Furthermore, harmful alcohol use 
in a patient with, or at-risk for, liver disease may be quite different than these standard 
recommendations for healthy adults. The NIAAA and WHO risk drinking levels, somewhat

align with guidance for steototic liver disease subclassification, for which ALD is defined as 
increasingly predominant as alcohol use reaches and exceeds 30–60 g/d for males, or 20–50 
g/d for females.

Alcohol Use Disorder.

AUD is a medical condition characterized by impaired control over alcohol use, 
consequences from use, increasing time and priority given to alcohol in one’s life, and 
physiological changes in the body such as alcohol tolerance and withdrawal. AUD is also 
a chronic and relapsing condition that occurs across a spectrum of severity. AUD remission 
and recurrence can happen multiple times across the lifespan. AUD can occur at any level 
of alcohol use but is more likely to occur at higher levels of alcohol use. AUD diagnosis is 
based on the presence or absence of behavioral symptoms and can be diagnosed using the 
DSM-520 or ICD-1121, shown in Figure 1. Those who do not meet AUD diagnostic criteria 
for 3 months are considered in early remission, and those who do not meet criteria for 12 
months are considered in sustained remission.

Assessment.

Alcohol consumption and AUD should be evaluated at regular intervals. Regular assessment 
can lead to timely intervention and treatment given that changes in alcohol use and 
return to drinking are common even after a period of abstinence. In addition to standard 
clinical interviews, we recommend three types of assessment to capture key alcohol-related 
information: 1) self-report questionnaires and interviews that assess alcohol consumption, 2) 
AUD symptom assessments, and 3) alcohol-related biomarkers.

Alcohol consumption should be assessed using validated alcohol screening instruments. 
These instruments are often short and easy to embed into measurement-based care digitally 
or given in person at clinics. One such instrument is the AUDIT-C28, a 3-item assessment of 
alcohol quantity and frequency. Alternatively, the 10-item AUDIT29 assesses alcohol use as 
well as domains related to AUD symptoms. The Timeline Follow-Back is a gold standard for 
measuring frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption using a calendar-based method30.

For patients who drink at any level of risk, a full diagnostic assessment of AUD should occur 
via clinical interview by a trained provider for diagnostic accuracy. Common comorbid 
conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and other substance use disorders, should also be 
assessed. This may require the involvement of a psychosocial team member, or referral to an 
addiction specialist. However, when this is not possible we recommend using a brief alcohol 
symptom checklist31 or using the AUDIT to assess domains relevant to AUD symptoms 
which can inform clinical decision making.

Direct alcohol biomarkers are also recommended32. Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is a highly 
specific and sensitive biomarker that can detect alcohol use or cessation over a 3-4 week 
period33. Interpretive guidelines for PEth levels provide ability to categorize consumption 
levels corresponding no/light, moderate, or heavy alcohol consumption34. PEth has been 
shown to correspond with objective measures of alcohol consumption35. Other biomarkers, 
such as urine ethyl glucuronide (EtG) or urine ethyl sulfate, are relatively common and 
inexpensive and can detect alcohol use in the past 3-5 days. With patient consent, family

member or loved ones can also be useful sources of information when assessing alcohol 
use to corroborate self-report or when an individual is unable to self-report (e.g. cognitively 
impaired or unconscious).

Diagnosis of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease

The era of deepened understanding of ALD pathophysiology abutted the first liver 
transplantation in humans by Thomas Starzl in 196336. Though early attempts yielded 
short survival durations and a brief international moratorium on the surgery, improvement 
in immunosuppression with cyclosporine extended survival in the late 1970s and liver 
transplantation was accepted by the American Association of the Study of Liver Diseases 
(AASLD) in November 1982. It was approved by the National Institutes of Health 
Consensus Development Conference the following June, including ALD as an appropriate 
liver transplantation indication if alcohol abstinence was achieved giving rise to the 
informal recommendation of 6 months of alcohol abstinence as a liver transplantation 
prerequisite37-39.

Liver transplantation for ALD, though hampered by stigma, was undertaken but 
considered exceptionally challenging in the 1980s with the perspective that increased 
risk of complications due to malnourishment and infection, and overall lower survival 
was noted40-42. Advocates of liver transplantation in ALD emerged, including Starzl, 
who published not only on the equal post-operative survival with cyclosporine 
immunosuppression in patients with ALD as compared to those with other causes of 
liver failure in 198843. As heterogeneity developed among liver transplantation centers 
in approach to liver transplantation in ALD, physicians from the University of Michigan 
Alcohol Research Center proposed a pre-liver transplantation evaluation based on 4 domains 
(diagnosis, patient/family recognition of the disease, social stability, and prognostic factors) 
on the basis that pre-operative abstinence did not predict surgical or return to drinking 
outcomes44. This group went on to demonstrate excellent, equivalent survival of 45 patients 
with ALD requiring liver transplantation who underwent multidisciplinary evaluation, and 
only 2 patients were found to return to hazardous alcohol use45.

The growth of liver transplantation for ALD indications continued to revolve around the 
controversy of the pre-transplant sobriety period46. This was most notably restrictive of 
liver transplantation for patients suffering from severe alcohol-associated hepatitis. This 
barrier to transplant for alcohol-associated hepatitis was prominently challenged by the 2011 
French-Belgian study which demonstrated 70% survival of the 26 carefully selected patients 
with alcohol-associated hepatitis as compared to the dismal 20% of the matched controls, 
and that return to alcohol was late and rare47. The ACCELERATE-AH consortium then re-
demonstrated 94%, 1-year survival of 147 patients transplanted for severe alcohol-associated 
hepatitis48.

As the AASLD sought to decrease stigma by reforming its lexicon, “alcoholic” for “alcohol-
associated,49” and encourage concomitant AUD treatment50,51, the COVID-19 pandemic 
ignited the rates of AUD and ALD in the United States and doubled the rates of liver 
transplantation for alcohol-associated hepatitis52,53. This prompted the Dallas Consensus

Conference’s proposal of criteria to evaluation patients for liver transplantation in alcohol-
associated hepatitis54. Understanding of AUD and return to use after liver transplantation 
in patients transplanted for ALD indications continues to evolve, with further nuanced 
means of monitoring55,56 and understanding of patterns of post-liver transplantation return 
to alcohol use57. There continues to be lack of consensus in the liver transplantation field 
and in the AUD research field, generally, regarding how to define relapse, slip, versus return 
to heavy drinking58.

ALD comprises a spectrum of liver damage. The earliest form of liver damage from alcohol 
use is steatosis, or fatty liver. Steatosis from alcohol occurs in most patient (>90%) when 
chronically consuming 20-50 grams per day for females or 60-80 grams per day for males 
for at least 2 weeks49. With 4-6 weeks of total abstinence, steatosis can resolve. With 
continued heavy drinking, however, approximately 20-40% of these patients who develop 
steatosis will go on to develop inflammation (steatohepatitis) and scarring (fibrosis). Grades 
F3 and F4 are considered advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) as such patients have 
increased risk of mortality over time59. Patients who have cirrhosis but who have not 
developed symptoms of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, variceal bleeding, jaundice, or 
hepatic encephalopathy) are termed compensated cirrhosis or compensated ACLD (cACLD) 
and those who have developed such symptoms are considered decompensated ACLD or 
decompensated cirrhosis. Decompensated cirrhosis portends significantly worse prognosis 
overall59. However, for those with ACLD secondary to alcohol use, complete alcohol 
cessation can lead to recompensation and fibrosis regression59. Finally, the most severe 
form of liver disease, alcohol-associated hepatitis, which is defined by clinical diagnosis 
and biopsy60, can occur at any timepoint in the specttimerum of liver disease, though 
most frequently co-occurs with cirrhosis61. Alcohol-associated hepatitis is a severe hepatic 
and systemic inflammation that occurs in the presence of heavy alcohol use, but is likely 
influenced by other factors, such as genetic predispositions as well.

The diagnosis of ALD involves diagnosing alcohol use and AUD, as noted above, and 
diagnosing the stage of ALD. Earlier stages of ALD, particularly steatosis, may be 
challenging to diagnose as these early stages are usually asymptomatic and may not be 
accompanied by liver enzyme changes. In some cases, physical exam will disclose an 
enlarged liver by palpation. Common liver enzyme elevations of aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) may indicate the presence of alcohol use. 
Other liver enzyme elevations (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and/or 
bilirubin) may also be elevated with steatohepatitis and more advanced stages, though 
this is not uniform. Diagnosis of steatosis can be made with imaging such as ultrasound, 
computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imagery (MRI). Liver biopsy is not required 
for steatosis diagnosis typically.

Staging of fibrosis can be performed using non-invasive tests or liver biopsy. Non-invasive 
tests (NITs) are more popular due to their relative ease of performance and the avoidance 
of liver biopsy and its potential complications. Commonly performed lab tests, such as 
the FIB-4, performed reasonably well for ruling in advanced ALD with specificity of 
89-91% for F3-F4 fibrosis and negative predictive value of 88%, but with poorer sensitivity 
(58-71%)62. The Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test, also performed well with comparable

specificity and slightly improved sensitivity, but is not widely available in the United States. 
NITs based on elastography, an imaging-based exam that uses vibration to determine 
liver stiffness, have traditionally performed even better than lab-based NITs, but have 
the disadvantage of being more costly and less widely available. Transient elastography 
performs well to diagnosis advanced CLD (F3 or F4) with sensitivity and specificity over 
90% and a negative predictive value of 96%62. Though no formal care pathways exist for 
guiding the diagnosis of ALD, initial evaluation for staging ALD should start with basic 
labs, including liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) as well as a 
complete blood count to obtain platelet counts to enable calculation of a FIB-4 score. A 
FIB-4 score greater than or equal to 3.25 should prompt further evaluation with transient 
elastography and a potential referral to gastroenterology or hepatology for further diagnostic 
evaluation for ACLD. Lower than normal platelet levels may denote the presence of portal 
hypertension so should be investigated further with imaging. Cirrhosis may be directly 
seen on imaging, but the absence of cirrhotic morphology of the liver does not rule out 
the presence of F3-F4 fibrosis. Patients with evidence of cirrhosis by NIT, physical exam, 
clinical symptoms (e.g. ascites, jaundice), or imaging should be referred to hepatology for 
further evaluation.

Alcohol is widely consumed in society and many individuals worldwide meet criteria for 
harmful use of alcohol and/or AUD. Alcohol can affect all human organ systems and any 
medical provider may find themselves as first to learn of a patient’s struggle with alcohol 
use, necessitating universal preparation of medical professionals, either through education 
and intent to treat or up-to-date referral options at hand. ALD is also common and increasing 
with rising rates of drinking in some population groups, and with increases in metabolic 
diseases. There are many diagnostic tools for AUD and ALD, and clinicians are encouraged 
to use these tools to intervene early in the progression of AUD and/or ALD. Integrated 
medical and psychosocial care has been highly effective in supporting patients with AUD 
and ALD in achieving recovery and as such the standard of care has become specialized 
multidisciplinary clinics44,49,63. Patients with AUD and ALD can recovery through early, 
coordinated intervention, reductions in stigma, and through careful management with 
integrated medical and psychosocial care. AUD treatment is effective even for those with 
advanced ALD with reduced risk of decompensation and patient mortality64-66. Future 
research on integrated treatments and how to best support patients with AUD and ALD is 
needed.

Key Points

•

•

•

•

Alcohol use disorder is among the most common psychiatric disorders and 
excessive drinking is attributable to 5.1% of the global burden of disease and 
injury.

Most individuals with alcohol use disorder never receive treatment and 
the primary reasons for not seeking treatment include not wanting to stop 
drinking, lack of access to treatment, and concerns about stigma.

Alcohol-associated liver disease is also increasing, and there is growing 
research on the need for coordinated medical and psychosocial care for 
individuals with alcohol use disorder and/or alcohol-associated liver disease. 
Early intervention can reduce alcohol use and prevent progression to alcohol-
associated hepatitis.

Liver transplantation is effective in treating alcohol-associated liver disease, 
including alcohol-associated hepatitis.

Synopsis

Harmful alcohol use and alcohol use disorder are common worldwide, and rates of 
alcohol-associated liver disease are also increasing. Alcohol use disorder is a disease that 
is treatable and can be diagnosed and managed, and recovery from alcohol use disorder 
through abstinence or reductions in drinking is possible. Management of alcohol use 
disorder among individuals with alcohol-associated liver disease is increasingly being 
addressed via integrated medical and psychosocial treatment teams that can support 
reductions in drinking and prevent progression of liver disease. Early diagnosis of alcohol 
use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease can improve lives and reduce mortality.

Clinics Care Points

There is “no wrong door” by which patients access addiction care 
– all physicians can treat addiction, regardless of sub-specialization. 
Despite acknowledgement of previous deficits in addiction care training by 
surveyed gastroenterologists67, it has been demonstrated further training is 
available and effective. Modalities have included interdisciplinary institutional 
didactics68, participation in immersive programs like ASAM’s Fundamentals 
of Addiction Medicine course, addiction-specific conferences such as ASAM 
or AMERSA or state-chapter meetings, in-person or on society platforms 
like AASLD’s Liver Learning69, or formal subspecialty training in Addiction 
Medicine or Addiction Psychiatry70. NIAAA also offers a core resource on 
alcohol with free continuing education credit71

Words matters, utilize clinically accurate and medically appropriate 
language. Stigma is a significant barrier for patients with SUDs towards 
building rapport with medical teams and enabling access to care72. It is 
imperative physicians, staff, and researchers avoid terms of negative bias 
when speaking and documenting encounters involving patients with AUD 
as word choice influences perceptions and judgments resulting in disparate 
outcomes.

Screen universally, and by evidence-based means, early and often. 
Screening for problematic alcohol use is recommended across the care 
continuum from emergency departments, to primary care clinics, to hospitals, 
to sub-specialist hepatology offices49. Ideally, a brief assessment such as the 
AUDIT-C is used to assess whether a person is drinking any alcohol, and 
whether the level of use necessitates advice about risk and/or further clinical 
intervention. Given even low levels of alcohol use increase risk of morality in 
those with ALD it is critical to assess all individuals regularly for alcohol use, 
even after periods of abstinence49.

Diagnose AUD with DSM-5 criteria, if adding a diagnosis, disclose to the 
patient and document criteria met. The DSM-5 can be used to create a 
single diagnosis of AUD with mild, moderate, and severe sub-classifications. 
Transparency with diagnosis is important to allow for a shared understanding 
of illness and impacts, support rapport and alliance, as well as empower 
patients and promote agency.

Offer treatment early and often. Only 1 in 3 patients with AUD is offered 
evidence-based AUD medications despite good efficacy and tolerability73. 
However, response to treatment is heterogeneous among patients and 
additionally given the chronic recurrent nature of AUD, may necessitate 
multiple treatment attempts to achieve sustained remission73. Together this 
means providers must be prepared to offer treatment for AUD when patient 
indicates interest and be prepared to revisit gently and often.

Document extent of patient education and AUD treatment offered during 
alcohol-related health care interactions, as these impact future treatment 
options. With the adoption and recapitulation of the Dallas Consensus 
Conference around transplant in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis across 
United States institutions, it is important to manage all alcohol-related health 
care interactions in light of future impacts on transplant candidacy. Given 
criteria related to alcohol-associated hepatitis recommend consideration 
for liver transplantation be given only with “first presentation with 
decompensated alcohol-related liver disease” and criteria related to AUD 
caution against “repeated unsuccessful attempts at addiction rehabilitation” 
and “acceptance of ALD diagnosis with insight,” it is imperative that 
counseling and treatment options, progress, or complications be explicitly 
addressed in medical record documentation54.

Make space for ambivalence. Motivational interviewing offers a framework 
to support behavior change through and emphasis on empathy of the provider, 
approaching with curiosity by rolling with resistance, and partnering patients 
instead of lecturing in clinical case to promote “change-talk” by our patients 
which often leads to better outcomes.

Multidisciplinary care is the standard for AUD in ALD given the 
biopsychosocial complexity of these patients. Integrated medical and 
psychosocial care has been highly effective in supporting patients with AUD 
and ALD in achieving recovery and as such the standard of care has become 
specialized multidisciplinary clinics44,49,63.

Concurrently address concomitant mood disorders. Up to sixty percent 
of patients with AUD have a concurrent mental illness, most commonly 
depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)74. Dual 
treatment of AUD with other psychiatric diagnoses is recommended.

Concurrently address nutrition deficiencies. The neurotoxic effects of 
alcohol are compounded by replacement of nutrients and create additional 
challenges in care engagement for patients suffering from neurologic deficits 
from thiamine deficiency, anemia-related fatigue, and protein-malnutrition 
fragility. Given this, all patients at risk of malnutrition should receive 
thiamine and folate replacement, and high protein dietary supplementation 
if alcohol-associated hepatitis or cirrhosis is suspected75.

Make space to discuss --and a plan to address—slips and return to 
use before they happen. It is important to discuss and plan with patients 
around inadvertent alcohol use in order to minimize alcohol-related harms 
and regain recovery in as short a duration as possible. It is important to 
support a patient’s understanding of their triggers resulting in craving or use, 
and increase healthy coping and care-seeking behaviors.
