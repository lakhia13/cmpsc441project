Abstract
Introduction: Longitudinal research examining the impact of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID‐19) school closures on the mental health of adolescents is scarce.
Prolonged periods of physical and social isolation because of such restrictions may
have impacted heavily on adolescents’ mental health and loneliness.
Methods: The current study addresses a major gap by examining the impact of school
closures on the mental health and loneliness of 785, 10‐ to 17‐year‐old Western
Australian adolescents (mean age = 14.1, SD = 1.31), who were surveyed across four
time points: twice before COVID‐19, once as schools closed, and once post reopening
of schools. Pre‐ and post‐COVID‐19 changes in mental health and loneliness were
compared using linear mixed models. Random intercept cross‐lagged panel models
(RI‐CLPMs) assessed temporal associations between loneliness, depression symptoms,
and positive mental wellbeing.
Results: Compared with pre‐COVID‐19 symptom levels, there were signiﬁcant in-
creases in depression symptoms, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and a
signiﬁcant decrease in positive mental wellbeing at diﬀerent points over time.
Symptom change over time diﬀered according to gender and pre‐COVID‐19 symp-
tom severity. Signiﬁcant increases in positive attitudes towards being alone and
feelings of isolation occurred at diﬀerent points over time. Gender diﬀerences were
evident. RI‐CLPMs highlighted the predictive signiﬁcance of friendship quality and
having a negative attitude towards being alone over time in relation to depression
symptoms. A positive or negative attitude towards being alone was predictive of
positive mental wellbeing over time.
Conclusion: Findings provide evidence that COVID‐19‐related school closures ad-
versely aﬀected adolescents' mental health and feelings of loneliness.

INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was declared a global pandemic on
March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organisation (2020). Within days, the Western Australian (WA) government im-
plemented disease containment measures to slow the potential spread of the virus. On March 24, 2020, the WA government
initiated a phased border restriction policy, which within 2 weeks culminated in a “hard border,” preventing persons from
other Australian states or international countries entering WA. Already the most isolated capital city in the world, Perth was
now eﬀectively completely isolated. Parents were subsequently advised to keep their children at home as schools closed.

HOUGHTON ET AL.

Although this had the desired eﬀect of restricting COVID‐19 cases and deaths, the school closures along with home
conﬁnement, social distancing, and the cancellation of numerous types of extracurricular activities meant WA adolescents
were confronted with prolonged periods of physical and social isolation from friends and family. Existing research shows that
the loneliness and social isolation arising from disease containment measures in previous outbreaks (e.g., severe acute
respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome) were associated with signiﬁcant increases in risk of
mental illness in adolescents and poor mental health up to nine years later (Brooks et al., 2020; Cénat et al., 2020; Loades
et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020).

There is now mounting evidence globally to suggest that the dramatic changes in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic
resulted in poorer general mental health and elevated anxiety and depression levels in adolescents, for example, Asanov et al.
(2021) in Ecuador; Branquinho et al. (2020) in Portugal; Chen et al. (2020) in China; Ellis et al. (2020) and Cost et al. (2021)
in Canada; Garcia de Avila et al. (2020) in Brazil; Ravens‐Sieber et al. (2021) in Germany; and Yeasmin et al. (2020) in India.
Almost all of the research to date has, however, been cross‐sectional, collected data “during” the pandemic months, and/
or relied on retrospective reports. Longitudinal studies that include assessments of mental health before, during, and after
COVID‐19 restrictions are scarce (McGinty et al., 2020), as are longitudinal studies including multiple time points during
COVID‐19 (Wang et al., 2020). This is particularly the case for longitudinal studies examining the impact of COVID‐19
restrictions on the lives of adolescents. Wang et al. (2020) surveyed the general population in China, including adolescents,
on two separate occasions (January 31 to February 2, 2020, ages 16–59 years; and February 28 to March 1, 2020, ages 12–59
years) and found levels of stress, anxiety, and depression remained stable, despite sharp increases in the number of COVID‐
19 cases between the two surveys. Although students aﬀected by prolonged school closures reported a higher psychological
impact, the participants during the two surveys were not the same.

In Australia, Magson et al. (2021) surveyed the mental health of 248, 13‐ to 16‐year‐olds in the 12 months leading up to
the COVID‐19 outbreak and again 2 months following government‐imposed school restrictions. Depressive symptoms and
levels of anxiety increased signiﬁcantly from T1 to T2, whereas life satisfaction decreased signiﬁcantly. Females experienced
greater declines in mental health than males, which is in line with other ﬁndings (e.g., Asanov et al., 2021). Similarly, in the
United States, reports from N = 105 parent–child dyads pointed to increasing trajectories in young adolescent's overall
mental health symptoms because of COVID‐19 restrictions (Hussong et al., 2021).

Although the emerging research ﬁndings point to a deteriorating situation in adolescents mental health because of
COVID‐19 restrictions, there is also evidence that such adverse changes do not remain, and in fact return to pre‐COVID
levels once stay‐at‐home orders are lifted (Breaux et al., 2021).

Loneliness, a potential antecedent of emerging mental health issues, has been reported as an unintended consequence
of the prolonged periods of physical isolation arising from school closures (Lim et al., 2016). Deﬁned as a subjective and
distressing psychological or emotional state, loneliness arises from a perceived deﬁcit in the quality or quantity of an
individual's meaningful social relationships (see Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009; Maes et al., 2016; Matthews et al., 2019;
Peplau & Perlman, 1982). Although subjective feelings of loneliness are theoretically distinct from objective social isolation
(i.e., number of social contacts/interactions) the two constructs are related (Entringer & Gosling, 2021; Folk et al., 2020)
and both are associated with negative health outcomes (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010). However, it is the feeling of being
connected, rather than the number of social contacts that promotes better health outcomes (Holt‐Lunstad et al., 2010;
Luchetti et al., 2020).

The research evidence is unequivocal that feeling lonely is associated with a myriad of mental health and psychosocial
problems (e.g., Cacioppo et al., 2002, 2006; Heinrich & Gullone, 2006; Houghton et al., 2016). Furthermore, an increasing
trajectory of loneliness during adolescence exacerbates mental health problems (Smith et al., 2018) and predicts self‐harming,
suicide ideation, and more lethal suicide attempts (Gvion et al., 2014; Heinrich & Gullone, 2006; Qualter et al., 2013).

Adolescence is already a highly sensitive time of social transformation where there is an increased need for peer
interaction and peer friendships (Orben et al., 2020). It is also a time for social comparison (i.e., to gain approval, feel good
about themselves, and reduce uncertainty) (Crone & Fuligni, 2020) where peer groups have a signiﬁcant impact on the
socialization of a range of behaviors (Ellis & Zarbatany, 2017). An independent sense of identity is also formed at this time,
which can lead to changes in the quantity and quality of personal interactions (Heinrich & Gullone, 2006). COVID‐19‐
related school closures and stay‐at‐home orders may therefore have increased risk of feelings of loneliness in young people
(Bu et al., 2020; Magson et al., 2021). Studies conducted with adults (age range 18–88 years) have shown that COVID‐19
either led to increased feelings of loneliness (for a review, see Buecker & Horstman, 2021) or had no eﬀect on feelings of
loneliness (Bu et al., 2020; Luchetti et al., 2020; Ray, 2021). According to Buecker and Horstmann (2021), the evidence about
pandemic containment measures being associated with changes in perceived quality or quantity of social relationships, or
both, is inconclusive because studies have not examined these processes.

Deteriorations in adolescent's mental health from prolonged school closures have been reported in longitudinal studies,
along with changes in loneliness (Hussong et al., 2021; Magson et al., 2021). For example, utilizing a single loneliness item Li
et al. (2021) found over 60% of Australian adolescents “frequently” felt lonely during the COVID‐19 period. “Not feeling
connected to friends” was also a key COVID‐19‐related concern of Canadian (Ellis et al., 2020) and Australian adolescents

(Li et al., 2021). Given the length of time a person experiences loneliness is a predictor of future mental health problems
(Qualter et al., 2010), it is important for educators and policy makers to understand the impact of COVID‐19 school closures.

1.1 | THE CURRENT STUDY

The research ﬁndings so far provide consistent evidence that the COVID‐19 pandemic has had a signiﬁcant negative impact
on adolescent's mental health and, indirectly, their feelings of loneliness. In Australia, where COVID‐19‐related infections
and deaths have remained low compared with most other countries, its impact has still been evident. For example, 3 months
after disease containment measures were introduced, 75% of 12‐ to 18‐year‐olds across all Australian states reported they
were worried about contracting COVID‐19, even though they had little direct or indirect experience with it (Li et al., 2021).
Our understanding of the impact of COVID‐19 restrictions on the lives of adolescents’ remains limited due to the scarcity of
longitudinal studies, however. Moreover, where evidence has been obtained over time, samples have been relatively small,
single items have been used to assess some variables, and the direction of any associations has not been possible due to the
timing and/or limited number of assessments undertaken. Although genuine concerns for the mental health of adolescents
are warranted, public debate should be informed by reliable data (Koenig et al., 2021).

To address this, the current study presents ﬁndings from a four‐wave longitudinal study capturing change in mental
health and feelings of loneliness in Australian adolescents before COVID‐19, as schools closed because of COVID‐19, and
again following schools reopening. We tested three main hypotheses. First, depression symptoms, externalizing and inter-
nalizing symptoms would increase, and positive mental wellbeing would decrease from pre‐COVID to COVID‐19‐related
school closures; second, feelings of loneliness would increase from pre‐COVID to COVID‐19‐related school closures, and
changes in mental health would be temporally preceded by changes in loneliness; and third when pre‐COVID measures of
mental health are averaged and compared with school closures time and post‐COVID schools reopening, there would be a
return to pre‐COVID levels. We will examine for sex diﬀerences.

| METHODS

2.1 | Participants and settings

Participants in the current study were part of a larger longitudinal project examining trajectories of loneliness and mental
health in adolescents. When COVID‐19 school closures were initiated in March 2020, N = 785 adolescents from the larger
study had completed Time 3 of the larger project surveys. Of these, 82% (N = 644) had completed assessments at Time 1 (pre‐
COVID ~18 months earlier) and 93% (N = 732) had completed assessments at Time 2 (pre‐COVID ~6 months earlier).
When schools reopened (~3 months after Time 3 COVID school closures), 83.95% (N = 659) completed the online surveys
(i.e., Time 4 schools reopening). These data indicate that participation rates and engagement with the surveys was high over
time. The full demographic characteristics at the commencement of school closures (T3) are outlined in Table 1.

The participants for the current study were the N = 785 adolescents (mean age 14.10 years, SD = 1.31, range = 10–17
years), who had completed the T3 survey in the time leading up to COVID‐19 school closures. These came from seven
randomly selected schools (ﬁve state government schools and two nongovernment schools) in Perth, Western Australia.
These schools were located across a range of socioeconomic status areas as indicated by their Index of Community Socio‐
Educational Advantage (ICSEA). ICSEA is set at an average of 1000 (SD = 100) and higher ICSEA values indicate higher
levels of educational advantage of students attending the school. The ICSEA values for schools in the study ranged from 939
to 1191.

2.2 | Measures

2.2.1

| Loneliness

The Perth A‐loneness scale (PALs: Houghton et al., 2014) was used to measure adolescent loneliness. This validated 24‐item
self‐report measure is composed of four correlated factors, each with six items. Factor 1 measures quality of friendships (e.g.,
“My friends will stand by me in almost any diﬃculty”). Factor 2, feelings of isolation (e.g., “I feel like I do not have a friend in
the world”). Factor 3, positive attitudes towards being alone (e.g., “I have discovered the beneﬁts of being alone”) and
Factor 4, negative attitudes towards being alone (e.g., “When I am all by myself, I wish I had a friend to be with”).
Participants respond using a six‐point Likert scale: 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often, and
6 = always. In the present study, the quality of friendships (T1–T4, α = .90–.93), isolation (T1–T4 α = .79–.89), positive

attitudes towards being alone (T1–T4 α = .85–.88), and negative attitudes towards being alone (T1–T4 α = .78–.81) subscales
showed good internal consistencies.

2.3 | Depressive symptoms

The Children's Depression Inventory–2 (self‐report short version; CDI:SR [S] 2; Kovacs, 2004) is a brief self‐report assessment
of cognitive, aﬀective, and behavioral symptoms of depression in children and adolescents aged 7–17 years. The CDI:SR [S] 2 is
composed of 12 items, each with three separate sentence response options that describe participants’ feelings and ideas over the
past 2 weeks. Each item is measured on a three‐point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating poorer outcomes (e.g., 0 = I am
sad once in a while, 1 = I am sad many times, 2 = I am sad all the time). The CDI:SR [S] 2 has demonstrated good reliability and
discriminant and convergent validity (Kovacs, 2004). In the present study, the CDI:SR [S] 2 had good internal consistency from
T1 to T4 (α = .83–.86). One item was removed before calculating scores due to content relating to feelings of loneliness which
may bias associations with the PALs: Item 12 (“I do not feel alone, I feel alone many times, I feel alone all the time”).

2.4 | Positive mental wellbeing

The Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS; Tennant et al., 2007) comprises 14 positively worded items
(e.g., “I've been feeling cheerful” and “I've been feeling optimistic about the future”) to which participants respond using a
ﬁve‐point Likert scale (1 = none of the time, 5 = all of the time). Responses are based on participants’ feelings over the
previous 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of positive mental wellbeing. In this present study, the WEMWBS had
good internal consistency from T1 to T4 (α = .83–.87). One item was removed before calculation of total scores due to
content relating to feelings of loneliness: “I've been feeling close to other people.”

Internalizing and externalizing symptoms

The Strengths and Diﬃculties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997) has been used extensively as a screening measure for
emotional and behavioral diﬃculties in children and adolescents (Goodman, 1997). Although the SDQ is designed to
produce ﬁve subscales (i.e., emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer relationship problems, and prosocial
behavior), a three‐subscale division is recommended when assessing nonclinical populations (Goodman et al., 2010).
Adolescents self‐reported symptoms on a three‐point Likert scale (0 = almost never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often), with more
signiﬁcant internalizing and externalizing symptoms indicated by higher scores. In the current study, the internalizing items
exhibited acceptable internal consistency across T1–T4 (α = .73–.88) and the externalizing items exhibited acceptable‐good
internal consistency from T1–T4 (α = .78–.80).

2.6 | Procedure

Permission to conduct the research was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the administering in-
stitution, the WA State Department of Education, and the principals of all participating schools. Permission was also granted
by the publisher of the CDI:SR [S] 2 to administer the instrument online. Informed consent and verbal assent was obtained
from individual participants. Participants completed the surveys online during regular school time on four separate occasions
over the span of ~28 months. Each of the T1–T4 survey administrations remained open for schools and participants to access
for a period of 30 days. All participants were provided with a unique identiﬁcation code, which allowed them to log on to the
survey at each separate administration. To ensure that the correct code was used, it was given to each participant immediately
before each administration. This unique code also ensured that all information provided was conﬁdential and that data could
be linked across waves via these codes for the purposes of data analysis. School principals nominated one teacher to be
responsible for liaising with the researchers and overseeing survey administrations across time points. These teachers each
received written instructions to ensure standardization of administration procedures. No money or other incentives were
provided to participants.

2.7 | Data analysis

2.7.1

| Assessing change in symptoms and loneliness over time

To examine change in symptoms of mental health over time, mixed eﬀects models were ﬁt to the data (using the mixed
procedure in SAS Version 9.4). These models assessed whether symptoms of depression, internalizing and externalizing
symptoms, positive mental wellbeing, and the four dimensions of loneliness signiﬁcantly changed over time when compared
with pre‐COVID‐19 school closure levels. Depressive symptoms, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, positive mental
wellbeing, and the four dimensions of loneliness were modeled linearly, and time was treated as a categorical variable. Both
pre‐COVID‐19 time points (T1 and T2) were included in models and T2 was selected as a reference point, as it assessed
mental health closest in time to the onset of COVID‐19. Separate mixed eﬀects models were ﬁtted for each variable, with
random intercepts and slopes included to account for individual variability. Missing data were handled with maximum
likelihood, which has been shown to produce largely equivalent results when compared with multiple imputation
(Newman, 2003).

Separate follow‐up models were ﬁtted for males and females to assess whether signiﬁcant change was evidenced for either
genders. During childhood and adolescence, well‐established gender diﬀerences exist for mental health and this gap increases
with age during adolescence (Van Droogenbroeck et al., 2018). For example, girls report signiﬁcantly more internalizing
disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety) (Campbell et al., 2021), whereas boys present with more externalizing disorders
(Plenty et al., 2021). A recent systematic review of studies during the COVID‐19 pandemic showed females were more
aﬀected than males for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during this period (Santomauro et al., 2021). Despite
this evidence, knowledge about gender diﬀerences in adolescent mental health remains poorly understood (Campbell
et al., 2021). Mean change over time for both genders is depicted graphically and full results from individual growth models
are provided in the Supporting Material.

In addition, trajectories over time were examined based on pre‐COVID‐19 T1 and T2. For depression symptoms,
categories were developed with reference to normative levels outlined in the CDI:SR [S] 2 (Kovacs, 2004). For positive mental
wellbeing, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms, a quartile split was used based on sample distributions. Subsequent
mixed eﬀects models assessing the magnitude of change added symptom categories at Time 1 as an independent variable, and
change over time assessed with Time 2 as a reference point. Eﬀect sizes have been calculated based on the within‐subjects
pooled SD and the magnitude of eﬀects interpreted based on Cohen's guidelines (i.e., weak = 0.2, medium = 0.5, strong = 0.8;

196

HOUGHTON ET AL.

Lakens, 2013). Gender, depression symptoms, positive mental wellbeing, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms were
nonsigniﬁcantly associated with missing data at each other time point when compared with the school closure time
assessment. However, adolescents who did not complete pre‐COVID T 2 assessment had a marginally higher mean age.

2.8 | Temporal relationships between loneliness and depression symptoms

Random intercept cross‐lagged panel models (RI‐CLPMs) were ﬁt to the data to assess the temporal associations between
dimensions of loneliness and both depression symptoms and positive mental wellbeing. Cross‐lagged panel models are
advantageous in examining reciprocal relationships between variables over time (Usami et al., 2019). Although CLPMs
attempt to control for stability in an outcome through autoregressive parameters (i.e., the extent to which one variable is
associated with itself at the next assessment), critics suggest this fails to accommodate for the trait‐like, time‐invariant
nature of a variable (Hamaker et al., 2015). As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with standard CLPMs do
not represent the actual within‐person relationships over time and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the
presence, predominance, and sign of causal inﬂuences. Through the introduction of a random intercept, the RI‐CLPMs
allow for examination of cross‐lagged eﬀects and autoregressive components, whereas adequately controlling for stability
over time. RI‐CLPMs are advantageous in long‐term longitudinal studies in examining within‐person dynamics. Due to
complexity, RI‐CLPM models were ﬁt separately for each subscale of the PALs in relation to depression symptoms or
positive mental wellbeing (eight models in total). All four time points were included in each model, but we have omitted
the associations between T1 and T2 from the presented results to simplify the diagrams, as these changes were not relevant
to our hypotheses. With this approach, scores are interpreted with reference to a person's own mean averaged over time,
rather than the overall mean for all participants. This person‐centered approach allows for examination of whether
deviations in a factor from typical levels at one timepoint (i.e., higher than average isolation at pre‐COVID) predict change
at the next time point (i.e., higher than average depression symptoms at school closures, when controlling for higher than
average levels at pre‐COVID). This within‐person approach was utilized to examine whether increases in loneliness from
typical levels at the start of COVID‐19 lockdowns were associated with deterioration in mental health at future timepoints.
Cross‐sectional correlations between factors were constrained to be equal at each time examining whether deviations from
a person‐speciﬁc mean in depression symptoms or positive mental wellbeing were correlated with deviations in loneliness.
Variables with signiﬁcant univariate associations with depression or positive mental wellbeing were included in a ﬁnal
model to identify the unique eﬀects of each factor. Full model results have been presented in the Supporting Material
(Tables S6–S13).

Results from standard CLPMs have also been presented in Figures S3–S8. These analyses examine levels of loneliness
or mental health relative to a grand or overall mean, rather than a person‐speciﬁc mean. Within this context, auto-
regressive associations examine whether deviations in scores from the grand‐mean persisted from one time period to the
next (i.e., if an adolescent had depression symptoms higher than the overall average at one time period, how much of this
variance persisted at the next time period?). On the other hand, cross‐lagged parameters allow for an assessment of
whether scores in a construct relative to the grand‐mean are associated with change in another factor at the next time
period (i.e., when controlling for autoregressive association). For example, whether higher than average levels of loneliness
relative to other adolescents, are associated with heightened levels of depression symptoms at the next time period. All
analyses were conducted using Mplus Version 8.4. All correlations and descriptives at each time point have been reported
in Tables S1–S4.

| RE SULTS

3.1 | Changes in symptoms over time

Results from linear mixed models assessing change in symptoms over time are reported in Table 2. In comparison with
symptom levels at T2, there were signiﬁcant increases in depression symptoms (B = 0.84, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 0.2,
1.68, p = .046) at the COVID‐19 school closure period T3 and a signiﬁcant decrease in positive mental wellbeing (B = −0.05,
95% CI = −0.09, −0.01, p = .025). Further, there were signiﬁcant increases in depression symptoms (B = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.09,
1.84, p = .03) and internalizing symptoms (B = 25, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.48, p = .040), and a signiﬁcant decrease in positive mental
wellbeing (B = −0.08, 95% CI = −0.12, −0.04, p < .001), at the post school reopening period T4 when compared with pre‐
COVID‐19 T2 levels. There were no signiﬁcant changes in externalizing symptoms reported at both T3 COVID‐19 school
closure and T4 post school reopening assessments. Inspection of eﬀect sizes indicated that for all time points the eﬀects of
change in symptoms were small (i.e., ≤0.2) or negligible.

3.2 | Trajectories by initial severity

Symptom change over time, shown in Figure 1, is based on pre‐COVID‐19 T2 levels. Across each construct, positive changes
in depression symptoms, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms were evident for adolescents who had the highest
depression symptom levels at pre‐COVID‐19 T2 (i.e., very elevated depression or highest quartile internalizing and ex-
ternalizing symptoms). In addition, individuals low in positive mental wellbeing at pre‐COVID‐19 T2 reported a higher
increase in symptoms compared with those high in positive mental wellbeing at pre‐COVID‐19 T2. Mixed eﬀects models
conﬁrmed these diﬀerences in trajectories, with changes in depression symptoms (B = −3.35, 95% CI = −5.63, −1.07, p = .004)
and internalizing symptoms (B = −1.20, 95% CI = −2.01, −0.38, p = .004) by T4 post school reopening being signiﬁcantly
lower for adolescents with higher symptom levels (compared with the lowest symptom category) and higher changes in
positive mental wellbeing (B = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.28, p = .034). However, there were no signiﬁcant changes in ex-
ternalizing symptoms at T4 post school reopening (B = −0.60, 95% CI = −1.28, 0.08, p = .081). Eﬀect sizes of the changes in
mental health compared to baseline levels based on initial levels have been depicted in Figure S1.

3.3 | Gender diﬀerences

A gender split was conducted to examine changes over time for males and females (see Figure 2 for the degree of change in
symptoms and Table S5 for model results). Results suggested there were nonsigniﬁcant changes over time for males in
depression symptoms, positive mental wellbeing, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms. However, for female
adolescents there were signiﬁcant increases in depression symptoms (B = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.21, 2.38, p = .019) and internalizing
symptoms (B = 0.32, CI = 0.03, 0.61, p = .031), and decreases in positive mental wellbeing (B = −0.06, 95% CI = −0.11,
p = .027) at T3 school closure. At T4 post schools reopening, there were signiﬁcant increases in depression symptoms
(B = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.16, 2.42, p = .025), externalizing (β = .36, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.66, p = .018), and internalizing symptoms
(B = 0.44, CI = 0.14, 0.74, p = .004), and decreases in positive mental wellbeing (B = −0.11, 95% CI = −0.16, −0.05, p < .001).
Eﬀect sizes of the changes in mental health compared to baseline levels have been depicted in Figure S2.

3.4 | Changes in loneliness over time

Compared with pre‐COVID‐19 T2, there was a signiﬁcant increase in positive attitudes towards being alone at T3 school
closure (B = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.93, p = .007) and T4 post school reopening (B = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.82, 1.64, p < .001).

There was a signiﬁcant increase in feelings of isolation at the T4 post schools reopening (B = .42, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.81,
p = .036), but not at the T3 school closure (B = 0.32, 95% CI = −0.05, 0.69, p = .092). There were no signiﬁcant changes in
quality of friendships and negative attitudes towards being alone over time.

3.5 | Gender diﬀerences

A gender split was conducted to examine changes over time for males and females (see Table S5 for model results and
Figure 3 for graphical depiction). Males reported signiﬁcant increases in positive attitudes towards being alone at both T3
school closure (B = 0.93, CI = 0.30, 1.56, p = .004) and T4 post schools reopening (B = 1.50, CI = 0.83, 2.17, p < .001). For
females, there were signiﬁcant increases in positive attitudes toward being alone (B = 1.03, CI = 0.51, 1.56, p < .001) and
decreases in negative attitudes towards being alone (B = −0.57, CI = −1.10, −0.03, p = .040) at T4 post schools reopening when
compared with pre‐COVID‐19 T2 levels. No signiﬁcant changes over time in isolation or quality of friendships were evident
for either gender.

3.6 | Temporal associations between loneliness and mental health

RI‐CLPMs were ﬁt for each dimension of loneliness to examine within‐level temporal associations with depression symptoms
and positive mental wellbeing (Figure 4). Higher person‐centered quality of friendships at pre‐COVID‐19 T2 was sig-
niﬁcantly associated with lower depression symptoms at T3 when schools closed (β = −.21, 95% CI = −0.34, 0.07, p = .015).
Feelings of isolation and positive attitudes and negative attitudes toward being alone were non‐signiﬁcantly associated with
depression symptoms over time. Fit to the data for the model with quality of friendships (root mean square of approximation
[RMSEA] = 0.04, comparative ﬁt index [CFI] = 0.99, Tucker‐Lewis index [TLI] = 0.98) was excellent.

Higher levels of positive attitudes toward being alone at T3 school lockdowns were associated with higher positive mental
wellbeing at T4 when schools reopened (β = −.13, p = .024). Quality of friendships, isolation, and negative attitudes towards
being alone were non‐signiﬁcantly associated with positive mental wellbeing over time. Fit to the data for the model with
positive attitudes toward being alone (RMSEA = 0.03, CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99), was excellent.

Cross‐lagged panel models examined the between‐level associations between loneliness and mental health. Quality of
friendships and negative attitudes toward being alone were signiﬁcantly associated with depression symptoms over the study
period. In the ﬁnal model, quality of friendships at pre‐COVID T2 was signiﬁcantly associated with lower depression

All variables exhibited signiﬁcant univariate associations with positive mental wellbeing at future time points. In the ﬁnal
model, only higher positive attitudes toward being alone at T2 pre‐COVID was signiﬁcantly associated with higher positive
mental wellbeing at T3 school closures (β = .07, 95% CI = 0.00, 0.12, p = .040). Higher negative attitudes toward being alone at
T3 school closures was signiﬁcantly associated with lower positive mental wellbeing at T4 school reopenings (β = −.09, 95%

To date, few longitudinal studies have examined the impact of COVID‐19‐related school closures on the mental health of
adolescents. Rather, the emerging research evidence has been primarily cross‐sectional and relied on parents retrospective
reporting of pre‐COVID‐19 functioning. The ﬁndings from these studies consistently suggest deteriorating mental health
among adolescents because of COVID‐19 (e.g., Asanov et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2020). The limited number of prospective longitudinal studies to date (Breaux et al., 2021; Hussong et al., 2021; Magson
et al., 2021) conﬁrm these cross‐sectional study ﬁndings. Our current longitudinal research strengthens the existing ﬁndings
by demonstrating increasing levels of depression symptoms, internalizing symptoms, feelings of isolation, and decreasing
positive mental wellbeing among adolescents at diﬀerent points in time in comparison to their pre‐COVID‐19 school closure
levels. In addition, our ﬁndings show that lesser increases in symptoms were evident for those with higher initial symptom
severity and greater for those low in initial severity. However, it is important to note that those who were among the lowest in
initial severity levels still remained within average levels according to normative criteria, and mean changes overall were low.
This suggests that adolescents are fundamentally resilient to the adversity associated with COVID‐19 imposed school
closures, including the uncertainty and widespread disruptions to daily life.

Magson et al. (2021) investigated whether mental health outcomes from pre to “intra‐COVID‐19” pandemic times
diﬀered according to sex. Our ﬁndings are supportive of Magson et al. (2021) in that although males evidenced no signiﬁcant
change in depression symptoms, externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and positive mental wellbeing over time,
females did at both commencement of school closures and post schools reopening. In general, girls exhibit more internalizing
problems, especially symptoms of depression, compared with boys during adolescence (Campbell et al., 2021; Hankin &
Abramson, 1999; Hankin et al., 2007). However, our ﬁndings are also supportive of Santomauro et al. (2021) whose
systematic review of studies found females were more aﬀected than males for depressive disorder during the COVID‐19
pandemic, and Ravens‐Sieber et al. (2021) who found emotional problems in girls seemed to increase with age during the
COVID‐19 pandemic period.

According to Hankin et al. (2007), sex diﬀerences in depression are partially explained by girls reporting more “fateful”
events outside of their own control, compared with boys. The COVID‐19 school lockdowns and restrictions on social
interactions may have been viewed as out of “their” control by the girls in our study and, therefore, although the current
ﬁndings reinforce the need to monitor the mental health of adolescents into the future, this might be especially important for
females.

Stressful life events and social isolation are known to be highly inﬂuential factors for externalizing disorders and this
may be why, contrary to established research (see Plenty et al., 2021), girls reported more externalizing symptoms than
boys at T3 and T4 school lockdown and reopening. Females tend to make plans with nonfamily members more often than
males do and have greater quality of friendships (de Jong Gierveld & Van Tilburg, 2010; Houghton et al., 2014).
School lockdowns may have disrupted these events to a greater extent than in males, resulting in females giving angrier,
inattentive, or impulsive externalizing‐type responses to life situations. Alternatively, as Lanceﬁeld et al. (2016) high-
lighted, it may have been the interaction between internalizing and externalizing psychopathology that explains the results
pertaining to girls. For example, externalizing psychopathology is characterized by disinhibition, which aﬀects attentional
processing and impulse control. As a result, an individual ﬁnds it diﬃcult “to appraise external stimuli appropriately and
hold in mind alternative explanations for their occurrence, thereby amplifying cognitive dysfunction” (Lanceﬁeld
et al., 2016, p. 533).

The impact of COVID‐19 school closures on adolescent's feelings of loneliness has received scant attention in
COVID‐19 studies. Li et al. (2021) utilized a single item to measure loneliness “over the past 2 weeks,” but data were
collected during the ﬁnal week of June 2020. Nevertheless, over 50% of respondents still reported frequent feelings of
loneliness.

In general, the emerging evidence pertaining to the COVID‐19 pandemic is that feeling connected to friends was
important in mitigating the eﬀects of lockdown protocols (Ellis et al., 2020; Magson et al., 2021). Although having this
“connection” may be important, it is also the quality of friendships that matter, especially during adolescence (Qualter
et al., 2015). This may be particularly important for adolescent girls' because their friendships are characterized by greater
levels of intimacy and emotional support (Rose & Rudolph, 2006; Rose, 2002). In the context of disease containment
measures, any associated loneliness and social isolation signiﬁcantly increases risk of mental illness in adolescents (see Loades

HOUGHTON ET AL.

et al., 2020). In the present study, having reliable, trustworthy, supportive friends was found to be protective against
developing depression symptoms at the commencement of school closures. Moreover, having quality friendships pre‐
COVID‐19 school closure was predictive of higher levels of positive mental wellbeing when schools closed. These ﬁndings are
important since the absence of friends can lead to feelings of loneliness, higher rates of morbidity and mortality (Holt‐
Lunstad et al., 2010), and long‐term psychopathology (Prinstein et al., 2009).

That feelings of isolation were elevated before school lockdowns (T2) might reﬂect normal trends, because up to 80%
of young people typically report experiencing loneliness (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010), while one in ten report “often”
feeling lonely (Snape & Manclossi, 2018). However, feelings of isolation increased signiﬁcantly at the T4 post schools
reopening, a time when one might have anticipated such feelings declining due to adolescents being reunited with their
peers. Loneliness involves negative cognitions about, for example, relationships, achievement, social acceptance, ap-
pearance, the future, upcoming stressful events, and changes in circumstances (Hunter et al., 2021; Songco et al., 2020).
Despite young people's eﬀorts to re‐engage in positive ways with their peers at T4, their negative social cognitions about
current and further potential COVID‐19 school lockdowns may have exacerbated their feelings of isolation.

It is known that “attitudes towards being alone might aﬀect one's vulnerability to feeling lonely, when alone” (Goossens
et al., 2009, p. 890), and that some adolescents have an aﬃnity for being alone while others tend to have an aversion to it
(Marcoen et al., 1987). Our ﬁndings reveal that having a more positive attitude toward being alone relative to other
adolescents at pre‐COVID was associated with higher positive mental wellbeing at T3 school lockdowns, and within‐level
increases in positive attitudes toward being alone at the T3 school lockdown assessment was beneﬁcial to adolescents as
shown by T4 post school reopening increases in positive mental wellbeing. Conversely, having a higher negative attitude
toward being alone relative to others at pre‐COVID was associated with increased depression symptoms at T3 school
lockdowns; there were also associations with decreases in positive mental wellbeing. While spending occasional time away
from others predicts psychological wellbeing, the key to positive mental health is the ability to enjoy these solitary activities
(Leary et al., 2003). Enjoying solitary activities can provide adolescents with pleasurable positive opportunities to become
more thoughtful and reﬂective (Leary et al., 2003). The inevitable disruption to daily functioning because of COVID‐19
school closures may have been quickly appraised by adolescents in the present study. Their thoughtful reﬂection on the
emerging global situation and ensuing social isolation via school closures may have contributed to developing positive
attitudes toward being alone and the activities they could access.

Although a strength of the present study is that it addresses the absence of longitudinal studies examining the impact of
COVID‐19 on adolescents (McGinty et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), there are several limitations that must be acknowledged.
There were diﬀerent time lags between data collections. The ﬁrst two lags were 6–8 months apart, whereas the COVID‐19
commencement of school closures (T3) and COVID‐19 post schools reopening (T4) were 4–6 months apart. Although our
study captured the impacts of COVID‐19 on the mental health and feelings of loneliness of adolescents likely caused by the
COVID‐19 imposed school closures, it may have missed periods of heightened loneliness and acute changes to mental health
at diﬀerent times during the COVID‐19 period.

Our data were based on adolescents self‐report and therefore may be subject to bias and poor recall. Although the optimal
recommended strategy is to use two or more sources (Antshel et al., 2012), self‐report is an eﬀective means of obtaining an
accurate insight into the subjective dispositions (such as mental health and loneliness) that can be diﬃcult to obtain from
third parties such as parents and teachers (Baldwin & Dadds, 2007; Houghton et al., 2014). Finally, data were obtained from
adolescents in Western Australia, where rates of COVID‐19 infections and death were relatively low compared with other
countries and, therefore, the results may not be widely generalizable.

Despite the limitations, this current research adds signiﬁcantly to the existing research regarding the impact of the
COVID‐19 pandemic on the mental health of adolescents. Speciﬁcally, it demonstrates increasing trajectories in depression
symptoms and internalizing symptoms, and feelings of isolation along with a decline in positive mental wellbeing during the
COVID‐19 school closures period. Furthermore, the current ﬁndings highlight the importance of quality friendships,
especially as schools closed and face‐to‐face contact among adolescents was restricted. Our ﬁndings have also highlighted key
predictors of future mental health among adolescents, along with potential mediators of the eﬀects of loneliness on mental
health. These may be important factors to assess during future pandemic imposed restrictions and other events that result in
prolonged periods of social isolation.

In conclusion, “the true impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on mental health is yet to be seen” (Wickens et al., 2021,
p.107). Research following the SARS outbreak found that longitudinal declines in mental health were still ongoing after
three years (Wu et al., 2009). It is therefore imperative that further longitudinal studies are conducted, not only to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the complexities such events present, but also to develop more targeted and innovative
strategies to address the mental health needs of adolescents as they progress into adulthood in uncertain times.
