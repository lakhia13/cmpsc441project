Abstract: Anxiety and eating disorders produce a physiological imbalance that triggers alterations in
the abundance and composition of gut microbiota. Moreover, the gut–brain axis can be altered by
several factors such as diet, lifestyle, infections, and antibiotic treatment. Diet alterations generate
gut dysbiosis, which affects immune system responses, inﬂammation mechanisms, the intestinal
permeability, as well as the production of short chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters by gut
microbiota, which are essential to the correct function of neurological processes. Recent studies
indicated that patients with generalized anxiety or eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia
nervosa, and binge-eating disorders) show a speciﬁc proﬁle of gut microbiota, and this imbalance can
be partially restored after a single or multi-strain probiotic supplementation. Following the PRISMA
methodology, the current review addresses the main microbial signatures observed in patients with
generalized anxiety and/or eating disorders as well as the importance of probiotics as a preventive
or a therapeutic tool in these pathologies.

1. Introduction

The interest in mental health has increased in recent years. Anxiety and mood disor-
ders are associated with many disabilities and individual suffering. The overall prevalence
of anxiety ranges from 5% to 30%, and of mood disorders from 5% to 15% [1,2]. Moreover,
the COVID-19 pandemic has increased these percentages, as demonstrated by a recent
meta-analysis conducted in the general population and in healthcare workers, showing a
prevalence for anxiety of 30% and 23.2%, respectively [3,4]. Furthermore, there is a close
relationship between eating disorders (EDs) and anxiety. The most prevalent EDs are
anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), with a life-
time prevalence of 0.48%, 0.51%, and 1.12%, respectively. All of them usually start between
10 and 20 years old, predominantly in females [5]. The lifetime prevalence of any ED is
2.5% in the European population, these patients have a prevalence of 33–40% of any anxiety
disorder and 19–50% of any mood disorder [5]. However, the pathophysiology of anxiety

and EDs is poorly understood due to the complexity of analyzing the genetic, metabolic,
and environmental factors that are involved in the appearance of these disorders.

The altered neural mechanisms in EDs are mainly related to the reward, behavioral
control, and decision-making paths. The current bibliography suggests that amygdala,
hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex are functionally compromised in anxiety
disorder [6]. These brain regions are involved in the generation and regulation of emotions
and fear. In anorexia and BN, there is a greater connectivity between insula, orbitofrontal
cortex, and ventral striatum, but lower connectivity from orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala
to the hypothalamus [7].
In BED, there is a diminished activity in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and insula [8], areas that are involved in self-
regulation and impulse control. Moreover, the alteration of the dopamine pathway is
an important contributor to the developing of any ED [8–10]. In anorexia and BN, harm
avoidance mechanisms related to serotonin receptor availability and to dopamine receptor
binding are also altered [11]. Otherwise, the neuropeptides that manage the signal of
hunger (ghrelin) and satiety (leptin) interact with the mesolimbic dopamine system, being
altered in EDs. Leptin is an anorexigenic peptide released from adipose tissue that is
diminished in AN. Ghrelin peptide with orexigenic functions is elevated in AN and
does not respond correctly after food intake [12]. Sensitivity to insulin (anorexigenic
pancreatic hormone) is also increased in AN [13]. Stress, hyperactivity, and appetite are
also modulated by the cortisol awakening response of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA) axis, being imbalanced in anxiety and AN [14].

One of the factors that inﬂuence the pathophysiology of anxiety and EDs is the compo-
sition of gut microbiota due to the strong association between the microbial signature and
the brain function. The gut microbiota includes the phyla Firmicutes (including Lactobacillus,
Enterococcus, and Clostridium genera) and Bacteroidetes (including Bacteroides genus), which
represent more than 90% of the intestinal community in healthy adults as well as Actinobac-
teria and Proteobacteria [15,16]. The gut–brain axis refers to the bidirectional interaction
between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS). This interaction has
been shown an increasing interest in recent years due to the harmful effects of dysbiosis
on brain function. Gut bacteria interact with the CNS by synthetizing neurotransmitters
such as serotonin, dopamine, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, and gluta-
mate and respond to hormones. Moreover, gut microbial diversity is also associated with
dysregulation of appetite due to ability to inﬂuence the intestinal satiety pathways [17].

Diet inﬂuences the microbial composition and richness. The fermentation of indi-
gestible carbohydrates by the colon microbiota produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs),
such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, implicated on the maintenance of homeostasis,
the regulation of appetite, and anti-inﬂammatory processes [18]. Diet alterations can gen-
erate an imbalance of microbial diversity and richness (alpha-diversity), which reduces
gut Firmicutes and increases Bacteroides phyla [19]. Moreover, alterations of gut microbiota
decrease the intake of calories from the diet [20], altering the immunological response. The
innate immune system is activated under dysbiosis by the increase of bacterial lipopolysac-
charides (LPS). These endotoxins trigger the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in plasma, and downregulate
synaptic proteins through the subdiaphragmatic vague nerve [21]. Moreover, recent studies
show that the gut microbiota modulates the reactivity of the HPA axis, which inﬂuences
the endocrine pathway. Therefore, its imbalance can produce abnormal glucocorticoid
levels and promote behavioral changes [22].

Due to the role of gut microbiota on modulation of neuronal circuits through the
gut–brain axis, the analysis of microbial proﬁles in patients with anxiety and/or EDs is
of vital importance. The knowledge of the changes in the microbial communities of these
patients could help in the development of novel therapeutic tools based on the modulation
of the microbiome.

2. Results
2.1. Role of Microbiota in Anxiety

Anxiety is considered one of the most frequent mental disorders and is highly comor-
bid with other mental disorders and EDs [23,24]. A 2004 study found that about two-thirds
of 672 individuals with AN, BN, or both had one or more lifetime anxiety disorders [25].
Moreover, anxiety disorders, especially obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in child-
hood, could be a risk factor for EDs later in life [26]. Although the etiology of anxiety has
traditionally been focused on genetic factors, evidences indicate that the gut microbiota and
its metabolites are closely linked to the host’s central nervous system though a bidirectional
communication. The microbiome plays an important role in the programming early in life
of the HPA axis, a primary component of the stress response, and its reactivity in adult
life [27]. Recent studies showed that prenatal stress in mice is related to alterations in
the microbiome, cytokines levels, and reduction of the brain derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) in the offspring, suggesting a link between the microbiome at early stages and
adult behavioral changes [28]. Moreover, a transfer of vaginal microbiome from stressed
mothers to offspring that were not stressed resulted in higher corticosterone levels and an
altered gene expression in the para-ventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus after
stress exposure in adulthood [29].

Stress decreases speciﬁc intestinal epithelial tight junction proteins such as claudin
1 (CLDN1) and damages the integrity of the gut epithelium [30], altering gut motility,
secretions, and mucin production [31,32]. These changes in the habitat of resident bacteria
will promote changes in microbial composition and intestinal permeability. One of the
most relevant is the translocation of certain gram-negative bacteria and allergens to the
bloodstream that will trigger the inﬂammasome signaling and neuroinﬂammatory pro-
cesses [33–35]. Inﬂammatory and neuromodulatory cytokines in the systemic circulation
will reach the brain due to an altered permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), enhanc-
ing mood disorders such as anxiety [36,37]. Therefore, an altered intestinal microbiota can
alter behavior, immunity, and endocrinology, and has been associated with central nervous
disorders, such as autism, and depression or anxiety behaviors.

Preclinical models highlight how gut microbiota disturbances due to antibiotics,
delivery mode, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from AN patients correlated
with anxiety-like behaviors [38–41]. Lach et al., assessed the long-term effects of transient
gut microbiota depletion using a cocktail of ﬁve antibiotics in mice. Results showed
a decrease of members of the family Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroides genus, which are
also associated with anxiety in humans [42]. Furthermore, expression of genes involved
in neurotransmission (such as Gabra1, Gabbr1, Npy, or Nr3c1), SCFA, and tight-junction
proteins were more drastically affected during adolescence than adulthood [43]. These
results highlight the consequences of gut microbiota manipulation during adolescence in
mood disorders and the need for this kind of study in humans.

Given the role of gut microbiota in the gut–brain axis due its capacity to produce neu-
rotransmitters (e.g., GABA by Biﬁdobacterium [44]) and its precursors as well as cytokines,
BDNF, and SCFA [45], several efforts have been carried out to establish a microbiological sig-
nature in individuals with anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, only a few studies in humans
achieved the establishment of taxonomic differences between anxiety disorders relative
to controls [42,46,47]. In all three studies analyzed, participants with generalized anxiety
disorders (GAD) showed lower microbial richness, measured by the number of observed
operational taxonomic units (OTUs), compared to controls. In a cross-sectional study of 36
heathy controls and 40 patients with GAD, Jiang et al., observed a signiﬁcant decrease of
Firmicutes spp., specially Butyricicoccus, Lachnospira, and the anti-inﬂammatory commensal
bacterium Faecalibacterium in GAD patients. Conversely, Fusobacteria, a pathobiont with
invasive and proinﬂammatory properties, and Bacteroidetes spp. increased signiﬁcantly.
Interestingly, the abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus, related to Crohn’s disease and the
producer of an inﬂammatory polysaccharide [48], was signiﬁcantly higher in GAD patients.
This study showed that gender or remission had no effect on the relative abundance of

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

the different taxa; however, the medication did. An enrichment of Escherichia–Shigella in
treatment-naïve GAD was observed after a subgroup analysis [42].

Another study in a Chinese population with GAD published a year later also showed
a greater enrichment in Escherichia–Shigella and Bacteroides [47]. Other groups such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriales, and Bacteroidaceae were also increased in these patients,
highlighting again the relationship between the presence of pathogens in the gut and
anxiety. On the contrary, Firmicutes, Dialister, Prevotellaceae, Coprococcus, Clostridium in-
nocuum group, Buchnera, Tenericutes, Mollicutes, and Acinetobacter were more abundant
in healthy controls. Interestingly, abundances of Bacteroides and Escherichia–Shigella were
positively associated with anxiety severity, whereas Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group,
Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and Prevotella_9 correlated positively with anxiety reduction.
These authors observed association between gender and the gut-microbial community
composition in patients with GAD (contrary to Jiang et al.). Unfortunately, they did not
examine the effects of drugs on gut microbiota proﬁles. Only two case-control studies
have been carried out for the study of a microbiological signature related exclusively to
GAD, both being carried out in the Asian population. Only one study was performed in
the Caucasian population, although the subjects exclusively diagnosed with anxiety was
very low (n = 8) and all females were under medication [46]. In this study, Mason et al.,
associated negatively the abundance of Eubacterium rectale/Closteridium group (Clostridium
cluster XIVa) and Clostridium leptum group (Clostridium cluster IV) with the severity of
anxiety (measured as GAD-7 score). Neither α-diversity nor β-diversity were signiﬁcantly
associated with this score, contrary to the other two studies where GAD was associated
with a lower fecal bacterial α-diversity. Likewise, the abundance of Bacteroides was also
inconsistent with previous studies, since, in this case, reductions in Bacteroides were associ-
ated with the presence of anxiety. However, due to the bias in sex and the limited sample
size, these conclusions should be analyzed with caution [46].

Overall these studies identiﬁed an imbalance of microbial communities in GAD
patients, suggesting that microbiome modulation may be a preventive and therapeutic tool
for anxiety.

2.2. Microbiota and Anorexia Nervosa

The intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in metabolic function, immunomodula-
tion, and weight regulation. AN represents a severe mental illness characterized by severe
weight loss associated with biochemical, metabolic, and immunologic disabilities, as well
as high mortality rates [49].

The gut microbiota exerts a critical role in weight gain and energy intake from the
diet. Dietary changes may also provoke an intense microbiota shift [50]. Furthermore, the
microbiota impacts satiety pathways through interaction with peptide signaling and may
be included in the etiology of AN [51]. The interactions between microbiota and the CNS
are regulated by neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways, adjusting the balance between
anorexigenic hormones like alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH) and orexigenic
peptides (ghrelins, leptine, and orexin) originated from the gastrointestinal tract [52].
Biﬁdobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. produce GABA, related to anxiety control;
Enterococcus spp., Escherichia spp., Streptococcus spp., and Candida spp. produce serotonin, a
neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, as well as dopamine produced by Bacillus
spp. [53,54]. In general, gram-negative bacteria produces bacterial lipopolysaccharides,
involved in the regulation of food intake through the activation of the enteroendocrine
cells expressing toll-like receptors (TLRs) [55]. An imbalance of such molecules may impair
feeding behaviors and weight loss [56]. Moreover, disorders in microbiota composition
have been linked to anxiety and depression typical of AN patients, and psychological stress
may lead to microbial translocation that enhance gut inﬂammation [57].

The ﬁrst case studies in people with AN showed 11 new bacterial species classiﬁed in
Firmicutes (Soleaferrea massiliensis, Stoqueﬁchus massiliensis, Dorea massiliensis, Holde-
mania massiliensis, Clostridium anorexicus, Clostridium anorexicamassiliense, Bacillus

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

marseilloanorexicus), Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides timonensis, Alistipes marseilloanorexi-
cus), and Actinobacteria (Streptomyces massiliensis, Blastococcus massiliensis) phyla and
four new micro-eukaryote species (Tetratrichomonas sp., Aspergillus ruber, Penicillium
solitum, and Cladosporium bruhnei), respectively, in a single fecal sample, demonstrating
an abnormal state in the intestinal tract of people with AN [58,59] (Table 1).

Complex carbohydrates are metabolized by intestinal microorganisms into SCFA
with neuroactive involvement (n-butyrate, acetate, and propionate) [60,61]. Recent clinical
studies (Table 1) conducted in the AN population showed that the total amount of bacteria
including Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum, and Bacteroides fragilis was signiﬁcantly
decreased in AN patients [62]. In addition, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and the
genera butyrate-producing Roseburia, carbohidrate-fermenter Ruminococcus, and Clostrid-
ium, belonging to Firmicutes, were reduced with the subsequent reduced acetic, propionic,
and butyrate acid concentration in the feces of patients with AN [62–65]. Propionate exhib-
ited a positive correlation with insulin concentrations and with the relative depletion of the
propionate producer Roseburia inulinivorans, whereas butyrate levels were negatively corre-
lated with anxiety and depression [63]. This may explain the reduced insulin levels and the
increased anxiety in AN individuals. Additionally, a reduction of the butyrate-producing
Roseburia spp. was identiﬁed in AN compared with healthy controls leading to elevated
branched-chain fatty acid concentrations and products of protein fermentation, which may
impair gut physiology and motility [66,67]. In contrast, mucin-degraders and members
of Clostridium clusters I, XI, and XVIII; Actinobacteria (mainly Biﬁdobacteria) [66], Enter-
obacteriaceae, and the methan-producing archeon Methanobrevibacter smithii [63], as well as
Coriobacteriaceae, were increased in AN compared with healthy controls. Methanobrevibacter
smithii improves the efﬁciency of microbial fermentation, and its richness optimizes calorie
extraction from a diet with very low calorie content. The development of Methanobrevibacter
in AN patients might be associated with an adaptive mechanism to optimize the absorption
of a hypocaloric diet [64]. The nutrient-deﬁcient environment, together with a delayed
colonic transit in AN patients, favors the increase of mucin-degrading microorganisms.
This will contribute to a disrupted gut barrier and a chronic state of low-grade inﬂamma-
tion, exacerbating the disease [68]. Therefore, the microbiota proﬁle has been linked to
gut inﬂammation and impaired structure of epithelial layer [69], as demonstrated by the
increased levels of IL-6 found in AN patients and IL-6 and IL-1 α in obese individuals [70].
LPS also produces an increase in blood–brain barrier permeability with the elevation of
plasma circulating cytokines responsible for the anorexigenic response [71]. Although there
is an association between cytokine production and speciﬁc gut microbiota in a healthy
population [72], more studies are needed in ED patients.

Morkl et al., found that athletes displayed the most diverse gut microbiota, while
obese participants and AN patients displayed less diversity [69]. Nevertheless, Mack et al.,
did not ﬁnd differences in microbiota diversity between AN patients and normal weight
(NW) controls, probably because the high ﬁber intake of AN patients may have protected
against the estimated reduction of alpha diversity [66]. Moreover, impaired microbiota,
SCFA proﬁles, and gastrointestinal complaints remained persistent after weight gain,
whereas overall species richness increased [66]. Signiﬁcant differences in the composition
of intestinal microbiota were found in patients with AN during renourishment. The
Ruminococcaceae, a family associated with bowel inﬂammation, were prevalent in AN
patients [73].

Distinct alterations in microbiota were observed for individuals with restrictive and
binge/purging AN-subtypes. During weight gain, microbial richness increased; however,
perturbations in intestinal microbiota and SCFA proﬁles in addition to several gastroin-
testinal symptoms did not recover [66].

A recent report suggested that Enterobacteriaceae, in particular Escherichia coli species,
can produce an anorexigenic and anxiogenic protein, the caseinolyitic protease b (ClpB),
which may impair αMSH involved in satiety and anxiety signaling. Consequently, the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

increased abundance of Gram negative bacteria might be linked to a higher production of
neuropeptide ClpB, which could be a mediator with the gut–brain axis in AN subjects [63].
Borgo et al., demonstrated that the most suitable predictor for intestinal dysbiosis and
metabolic changes was the body mass index (BMI) [63]. In contrast, in a case-series study
with three AN patients, no associations between the composition of intestinal microbiota
and BMI were observed despite signiﬁcant weight gain during the treatment [74]

- AN patients had: lower amounts of total
bacteria and obligate anaerobes including
Clostridium coccoides group, Clostridium leptum
subgroup, and Bacteroides fragilis group; lower
numbers of Streptococcus
- In the analysis based on AN subtypes, the
counts of the Bacteroides fragilis group in the
ANR and ANBP groups and the counts of the
Clostridium coccoides group in the ANR group
were lower than those in the control group.
- The detection rate of the Lactobacillus

the AN group
- The AN group had lower acetic and propionic
acid concentrations in the feces
- The subtype analysis showed that the fecal
concentrations of acetic acid were lower in the
ANR group than in the control group

- AN diet: signiﬁcant lower energy intake, but
macronutrient analysis highlighted a
restriction only in fats and
carbohydrates consumption.
- AN intestinal microbiota showed a signiﬁcant
increase of Enterobacteriaceae, and of the
archeon Methanobrevibacter smithii compared
with healthy controls.
- In contrast, the genera Roseburia,
Ruminococcus, and Clostridium were depleted,
in line with the observed reduction in AN of
total short chain fatty acids, butyrate,
and propionate.
- Butyrate concentrations inversely correlated
with anxiety levels, whereas propionate
directly correlated with insulin levels and with
the relative abundance of Roseburia
inulinivorans, a known propionate producer.
- BMI represented the best predictive value for
gut dysbiosis and metabolic alterations

The analysis conﬁrmed a
clear difference in the
bacterial components
between the AN patients
and healthy women.
Collectively, these results
clearly indicate the
existence of dysbiosis in the
gut of AN patients.

The gut dysbiosis could
take part in the AN
neurobiology, in particular
in sustaining the persistence
of alterations that
eventually result in relapses
after renourishment and
psychological therapy, but
causality still needs to
be proven.

samples were collected by
unit nurses and nursing
assistants trained in
collection protocols.

The stool sample was
collected on her ﬁrst day
of hospitalization, before
the introduction of tube
feeding. The dietary
habits of the patient
were surveyed

- Signiﬁcant changes in composition and diversity of
the intestinal microbiota over time at the phylum
(n = 4), class (n = 8), order (n = 14), family (n = 28), and
genus (n = 68) levels.
- REE increased during treatment, in parallel with
energy intake and BMI.
- REE was not related to composition or diversity of
gut microbiota.
- Diet- induced thermogenesis reached a peak after
2–3 weeks of treatment

Nineteen bacterial species never isolated from the
human gut before were found, including 11 new
bacterial species for which the genome has been
sequenced, Firmicutes, Bacterioides, and Actinobacteria

This preliminary case series
suggests that even in a state of
pathology, individual
microbial signatures persist in
accounting for the majority of
intestinal microbial variation.

This study revealed new
bacterial species participating
signiﬁcantly to the extension
of the gut microbiota
repertoire, which is the ﬁrst
step before being able to
connect the bacterial
composition with the
geographic or clinical status.

A 21-year-old Caucasian
woman was admitted in
an intensive care unit for
severe malnutrition in AN

One stool specimen was
collected from the

Culture and PCR-based explorations yielded a
restricted diversity of fungi but four microeukaryotes,
Tetratrichomonas sp., Aspergillus ruber, Penicillium
solitum, and Cladosporium bruhnei, previously
undescribed in the human gut.

Establishing microeukaryote

Authors aimed to determine
an association between FIDs
severity and dysbiosis of the
gut microbiota in a severely
malnourished patients with
AN undergoing
enteral nutrition.

33 AN patients (BMI:
11.7 ± 1.5; Age: 32 ± 12)
and 22 healthy controls
(BMI: 21 ± 2; age:
36 ± 12)

Fecal microbiota of AN
(DSM IVr criteria) female
inpatients were collected
and compared to healthy
controls based on 16S
rRNA proﬁling. The
severity of FIDs was
evaluated in patients and
healthy controls using
Francis Score.

- Some potentially pathogenic bacterial genera
(Klebsiella, Salmonella) were more abundant in AN
patients, whereas bacterial genera Eubacterium and
Roseburia involved in immune balance were
signiﬁcantly less abundant in patients than controls.
- Severity of FIDs was strongly correlated with several
microbial genera (r = −0.581 for an unknown genus
belonging to Peptostreptococcaceae family; r = 0.392 for
Dialister; r = 0.444 for Robinsoniella; and r = 0.488 for
Enterococcus). Other associations between dysbiosis,
clinical, and biological characteristics were identiﬁed
including severity of undernutrition.

-A marked dysbiosis was
identiﬁed in AN patients
compared to healthy controls.
-Observed gut microbiota
dysbiosis in malnourished
patients with AN is correlated
with the severity of FIDs and
other metabolic disturbances,
which strongly suggests
an altered
host–microbe symbiosis.

FMT in a single AN patients

De Clercq 2019
The Netherlands [76]

To describe FMT in a single
patient with AN

26-year-old female
following clinical recovery
from AN (restricting type)

This study assessed the
effects of FMT on gut
barrier function, microbiota
composition, and the levels
of bacterial
metabolic products.

FMT was performed with
feces from an unrelated
healthy female donor with a
BMI of 25. Dietary intake
was reported through
online application seven
days prior to each visit.
Changes in metabolic
parameters and body
composition were assessed
at baseline, six, 12, and
36 weeks.

- Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of
beneﬁcial bacteria, together with a great
abundance of fungal species were observed
in the patient stool sample before FMT.
- After FMT, both bacterial species richness
and gut microbiome evenness increased in
the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity
decreased. The total SCFA levels gradually
increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the
most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters,
serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the
observation period

- The patient gained 6.3 kg in bodyweight
(from 45.8 to 52.1 kg), mostly due to a 55%
increase in body fat and despite a reported
stable caloric intake. Resting energy
expenditure was decreased on all
post-measurements compared to baseline.
- Gut microbial composition showed an
increase in weighted phylogenetic diversity
at six and 12 weeks with an especially
marked increase in the number
of Verrucomicrobia.
-The gut microbiota composition slowly
changed back towards the patients’ initial
personal core microbial composition. No
side effects from FMT were reported or
observed during the entire study period.

The patient treatment with
FMT led to the
improvement of gut barrier
function, which was altered
prior to FMT

Authors showed for the ﬁrst
time that FMT induced
weight gain in a patient
with recurrent AN,
suggesting that gut
dysbiosis may be one of the
causal factors in the etiology
of persistent underweight
in AN.

2.3. Microbiota Involvement in Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder

BN is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and compensatory behaviors
such as self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, fasting, or intensive exercise
designed to undo or compensate for the effects of binge eating [77]. Binge-eating disorder
shares some characteristics with BN: recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food; a
feeling of a loss of control during the binge; experiencing shame, distress, or guilt after-
wards; and not regularly using unhealthy compensatory measures to counter the binge
eating [77]. The etiopathogenesis of both disorders is poorly understood. Genetic fac-
tors [78–80], neurotransmitters, and neurohormonal peptide secretion disturbances [80,81]
have been involved in BN and BED. Recently, the gut microbiota has been considered a
modulator of host metabolome, inﬂammation processes, and brain function [80]. Despite
gut microbiota in EDs has acquired increased interest in recent years, there are scarce
studies on the microbiota in BN and BEDs.

The gut microbiota of BED obese patients has a speciﬁc composition and differs from
that of obese subjects without BED. A cross-sectional study of a 101-patient cohort using
the microbial 16S rDNA sequencing showed decreased Akkermansia and Intestinimonas, and
elevated Biﬁdobacterium, Roseburia, and Anaerostipes in BED obese patients (Table 1) [82].
Changes in the proﬁle of gut microbiota entail biological consequences, sometimes related
to the eating behavior. Akkermansia muniphila produces SCFAs (propionate, an important
regulator of satiety) and acetate and increases the intestinal levels of several acylglycerols
(2-OG, 2-arachidonylglycerol, and 2-palmitoyl glycerol) involved in the regulation of the
inﬂammation and immunity reactions. Therefore, Akkermansia has an impact on food
intake behavior through the modulation of gut peptides [83,84]. Moreover, this genus is
associated with improved insulin-resistance and obesity. Thus, the decreased Akkermansia
observed in BED obese patients may be harmful. Biﬁdobacterium and Roseburia are related
to cardiometabolic beneﬁts, such as the reduction of hypertension and atherogenesis [82].
Anaerostipes is suggested to regulate human behavior. This genus is increased in psychiatric
disorders such as depression and bulimia nervosa. Intestinimonas can metabolize toxic
products from processed foods, such as Amadori products. This bacteria can convert
lysine into butyrate and acetate, involved in the maintenance of a proper gut function [85].
Therefore, the decrease observed in Intestinimonas in BED patients may be negative. Hence,
gut microbiota may be a modulator factor of metabolic proﬁle of obese BED patients.

As mentioned previously, one of the molecular pathways involved in the regulation
of anxiety and satiety is mediated by α-MSH. The caseinolytic protease B produced by
Escherichia coli is a conformational antigen-mimetic protein of α-MSH with anorexigenic
effect. Plasma levels of ClpB depend on the ClpB concentration in gut microbiota [86].
Preclinical models in Wistar rats showed sex-related different response to E. coli feeding.
Females had E. coli in gut microbiota before the intervention, but not males. After E. coli
feeding, males presented an increased production of α -MSH Ig M compared to females.
However, females respond to the intervention by producing higher α-MSH Ig G levels.
Females also presented a higher weight gain associated with Ig G and more efﬁcient
stimulation of α-MSH. Furthermore, food restriction was associated with ClpB production
in the gut microbiota [87]. ED patients have elevated ClpB concentrations in plasma
compared to healthy population. ClpB plasma concentrations in the three subgroups of ED
patients (AN, BN, and BED) were associated with α-MSH-reactive Ig G, but not statistically
signiﬁcant differences were found when compared the ClpB plasma levels in the subgroups
of ED patients. In BED patients, the ClpB concentration correlated with disorder duration,
but no association was found with the frequency of binge-eating episodes in BN and BED
patients. ClpB plasma concentrations also have been associated with psychopathological
traits of these patients [86]. These data support the relation between the E.coli ClpB
production and ED diagnosis and sex-related differences.

Different factors are involved in the etiopathogenesis of BN and BED, but there is a lack
of studies offering a global analysis of the etiopathogenic factors of these disorders. The
Binge Eating Genetics Initiative (BEGIN) arises with the aim of expanding the knowledge

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

about the etiopathogenesis of BN and BED. This study will include 1000 patients diagnosed
with BN and BED in order to characterize the disease through the collection of saliva,
feces, and the register of behavior traits. The study of the genome, the gut microbiota,
and the behavioral factors of this cohort will allow exploring the etiology, risk factors,
natural history, and response to treatment of patients diagnosed with BN and BED [88].
The phenotyping of these patients will allow in the future the offering of personalized
therapeutic options, in many cases related to gut microbiota (Table 2).

2.4. Therapeutic Tools in Anxiety and Eating Disorders

Although current pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders are safer than a
few decades ago, the effectiveness in some of them has not improved and can generate
addiction problems. Benzodiazepines (BZs) or serotonergic anti-depressants (ADs) are the
most widespread therapeutic options, BZs being more efﬁcacious than ADs for reducing
GAD symptoms [91]. However, BZs are not recommended for patients with a history of
drug abuse, nor can it be prescribed indeﬁnitely. Moreover, BZs are related to some side
effects, and high doses may be associated with dementia [92]. Therefore, the development
of new tools to look after or restore mental health without the undesired effects discussed
above are necessary. A psychobiotic is a live organism that, when ingested in adequate
amounts, produces a health beneﬁt in patients suffering from psychiatric illness [93]. The
growing preference for preventive medicine coupled with a growing portfolio of products
and a greater understanding of their mechanism of action will make psychobiotics a key
player in the area of nutritional supplements.

Preclinical studies show that probiotics can alter the cognitive and emotional processes
modulating behaviors and brain processes via the gut–brain axis in animal models, such
as zebraﬁsh, mice, or piglets [94–96]. As previously stated, anxiety is signiﬁcantly more
frequent in subjects with EDs than the general community and may predispose subjects to
developing AN or BN [94,97]. For this reason, it was necessary to review all the clinical
studies to date of the use of probiotics or postbiotics in patients that suffered anxiety or
worked in stressful environments. For that, those studies in which the population had some
disease concomitant (irritable bowel syndrome, major depression, autism, autoimmune
disorders, etc.), were discarded.

A total of 14 studies published until 2020 were included in the analysis: twelve of
them referred to a probiotic treatment, while the remaining two used a postbiotic [98]
or a symbiotic [99] (Table 3). Regarding the duration of the treatments, these varied
from 28 days [100] to six months [98], three months being the most used duration. In
reference to probiotic intake, only three studies with the same strain (Lactobacillus casei
Shirota YIT9029, LcS) in fourth grade medical students in exam period did not detect
a signiﬁcant decrease in anxiety according to the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A) scores compared to
placebo [101–103]. Neither did it improve depression rates according to the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression (HASD-D) and Zung Self-Rating Depression
Scale (SDS) or decreased salivary cortisol [102]. However, in their last study, they observed
a signiﬁcant positive effect of LcS treatment on sleep scores related to sleepiness on rising
and increased sleep length. In addition, overnight single-channel electroencephalography
(EEG) recordings showed that LcS strain suppressed sleep latency and increased sleep
intensity [101]. The symbiotic mixture composed of 10 g of resistant maize starch and
nine probiotic strains also failed to signiﬁcantly reduce anxiety levels according to the
HADS-A scale after six weeks of treatment. Nonetheless, the authors observed a relevant
improvement in these female healthcare workers, since after probiotic supplementation all
anxiety, depression, and fatigue scores fell into normal ranges [99]. In all studies identiﬁed,
only one used a single strain of Biﬁdobacterium [104]; by contrast, ﬁve studies used a
mixture of probiotics strains [99,100,105–107] and eight studies used Lactobacillus, being
L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus the most used species [98,101–103,108–111]. Biﬁdobacterium
longum 1714 strain was evaluated under a cold-pressor test in 22 healthy volunteers and
after a month of treatment, the anxiety score (STAI) did not signiﬁcantly increase under
the stressor, in contrast to placebo group [104]. This ﬁnding is important, since the study
was carried out with individuals who did not have baseline anxiety, so these results open
the door to the use of probiotics for the prevention of anxiety states. Although more
studies would be needed with other different stressors to corroborate this preventive
effect. The longest treatment (six months) corresponded to the only study that was done
with postbiotics (heat treated Lactobacillus gasseri CP2305). In this randomized double-
blind placebo controlled trial with medical students under ﬁnal examination pressure,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

17 of 43

authors showed a signiﬁcantly reduction of State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-trait scores
after postbiotic treatment compared to placebo (−1.9 vs. +1.1). Students also increased
signiﬁcantly their sleep quality (according to Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score)
and showed lower depression scores using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28),
although there was no signiﬁcant difference in the global GHQ-28 scores between groups.
The probiotic group also showed a non-signiﬁcant improvement of anxiety and depressive
moods (HADS) [98]. This study, moreover, was the only one among the 14 selected that
analyzed the change in the microbiota after treatment. Results showed that stress in the
students signiﬁcantly decreased Biﬁdobacterium and increased Streptococcus in placebo
group. By contrast, the heat treated probiotic signiﬁcantly mitigated the reduction in
Biﬁdobacterium and prevented the elevation of Streptococcus. These promising results call
for the need to increase the number of clinical studies with postbiotics for the prevention
and treatment of anxiety.

Recently, Ma et al., (2021) analyzed, in a follow-up work, the gut microbiota from
the study of Lew et al., (2019) to elucidate the mechanism behind the clinical efﬁcacy of L.
plantarum P8 in signiﬁcantly reducing some stress and anxiety symptoms [112]. Like the L.
plantarum DR7 strain, P8 strain signiﬁcantly decreased TNF-α and interferon-gamma (IFN-
γ) after treatment. However, DR7 strain also signiﬁcantly decreased plasma cortisol levels,
in addition to enhancing the serotonin pathway and increasing IL-10 levels [109]. The
analysis of the fecal metagenomes from the study with L. plantarum P8 showed a signiﬁcant
decrease of the Shannon diversity index in the placebo group but not the probiotic group
after 12 weeks. Moreover, the prevalence of some species-level genome bins (SGBs) related
to neuroprotective properties signiﬁcantly increased (e.g., B. adolescentis, B. longum, and F.
prausnitzii) after the treatment with L. plantarum P8 [112].

The interactions between eating behavior and microbiome modulate host biology. The
microbiota has the ability to modulate HPA axis, behavior, neuronal, and immune system.
Thus, manipulation of the gut microbiota may be useful to alter the natural history of
the EDs.

Increased use of antibiotics in patients with BN and BED prior to the onset of the ED
indicates the existing dysbiosis in these patients [89]. Intestinal microbiota in ED patients
are different from the healthy population. Microbial gut composition of AN patients shows
speciﬁc characteristics; butyrate-producers (such as Roseburia spp.) are decreased and
mucin-degrading bacteria (for example, Akkermansia muciniphila and Methanobrevilacter
smithii) are increased compared to controls [20]. Moreover, the study of intestinal microbiota
in the obese population found a different pattern of intestinal microbiota in patients
diagnosed with BED (decreased Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio, and Intestimonas, and increased
Anaerostipes) [82]. Additionally, ClpB produced by Escherichia coli (a conformational antigen-
mimetic protein of α-MSH with anorexigenic effect) is present in human plasma of patients
with EDs [86]. On the other hand, studies in speciﬁc populations with malnutrition showed
a nutritional recovery of the subgroup treated with antibiotics [113]. Therefore, antibiotics
may be a therapeutic target for the existing dysbiosis in patients with EDs. However,
researchers have to be cautious in using this therapeutic strategy, because antibiotics
can also produce intestinal dysbiosis. More studies are necessary to clarify the effect of
antimicrobial therapy on the course of the EDs. Future research should address the search
for therapeutic target molecules for the eradication of the desired bacteria.

There is a growing interest in the immunomodulatory role of prebiotics and probiotics
for the treatment of mood disorders. A recent meta-analysis of 34 controlled clinical trials
evaluating the effects of prebiotics (all with biﬁdogenic properties) and probiotics (mostly
lactobacilli and Biﬁdobacterium) on depression and anxiety concluded that prebiotics have
no effect on psychologic disorders, while probiotics have antidepressant and anxiolytic
effects [114]. The association of anxiety with EDs is accepted. Probiotic supplementation
with lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria, by stimulating a cross-feeding mechanism and increas-
ing Roseburia abundance and butyrate production, would ameliorate the imbalance of gut
structure in AN patients [115]. Future research on this ﬁeld might offer a new alternative
in the therapy of these disorders.

Finally, FMT is being evaluated in the management of the EDs. Preclinical studies in a
mice model showed the positive effects in the reverse of compulsive behavior of germ-free
mice previously reconstituted with the microbiota of restricting-type of AN patients [38].
Similarly, weight gain was achieved in an AN patient with recurrent underweight after FMT
(Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Euryarchaeota) [76], while the other case report
showed no clinical improvement after FMT (Akkermansia muciniphila, Methanobrevibacter
smithii) [75]. The total SCFA were increased [75,76] and serotonin decreased after FMT [75].
On the other hand, Firmicutes, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Prevotellaceae
are families of bacteria negatively associated with weight gain and positively associated
with gut microbiota ClpB KEGG function (K03695, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes annotation) after fecal transplantation from humans to mice [116]. Therefore,
future studies to examine the role of fecal microbiota transplantation in eating behavior
and weight gain may be helpful in unraveling altered pathways in EDs.

3. Discussion

The composition of the gut microbiota is strongly modulated according to the char-
acteristics of the diet [50,117], Moreover, the gut microbiota plays a critical role in weight
gain and energy intake from the aliments. For that, disruptions in the balance of human
microbiota are associated with several diseases, such as diet-related mental illness [118] or
generalized anxiety disorders. Therefore the scientiﬁc research focused on the gut micro-
biota proﬁle in patients diagnosed with anxiety or ED leads to an innovative approach to
understanding the etiopathogenesis of EDs and anxiety.

Several studies show imbalances in the intestinal microbiota of patients with EDs and
anxiety. In GAD, for example, there is an increase of bacterial groups with inﬂammatory
capacity such as Ruminococcus gnavus, Fusobacteria, or Escherichia–Shigella, positively as-
sociated with anxiety severity and a lower prevalence of SCFA-producing genera, whose
lack triggers an intestinal barrier dysfunction [119]. Therefore, an increase of pathogenic
bacteria able to degrade gastrointestinal mucins and produce exotoxins and inﬂammation
could exacerbate anxious symptoms. In contrast, Prevotella correlated positively with
anxiety reduction [47]. This is particularly interesting, because a signiﬁcantly tighter con-
nection between emotional well-being and a Prevotella-dominant condition [120] as well as
an increased response to affective images in the limbic system has been suggested [121].
Faecalibacterium, related with anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects, was also decreased
in GAD population. F. prausnitzii increase SCFAs and IL-10 levels and reduce corticosterone
and IL-6 levels in rats under a chronic unpredictable mild stress [122]. Therefore, their
depletion can increase the anxiety states. On the other hand, the increase of Enterobacte-
riaceae, together with a weakened intestinal barrier, would enhance the translocation of
the proinﬂammatory endotoxin LPS in blood [123]. LPS produces an inﬂammatory cas-
cade that activates the kyneurine pathway; tryptophan will be degraded by indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), decreasing the serotonin levels [124].

Although it has not been clariﬁed if gender inﬂuences the shaping of the microbial
community in patients with GAD, if it seems that the medication does [42]. However,
this exogenous factor has not been adequately considered by studies. Of the three studies
comparing the microbiota of healthy controls with GAD patients, only Jiang et al., (2018)

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

25 of 43

examined a subgroup with treatment-naïve patients. Furthermore, in six of the 14 studies
with probiotics or postbiotics, no data on the use or not of psychotropic drugs during
follow-up were reported [99,100,105,106,108,109]. Psychotropic medication is a signiﬁcant
source of inter-study variation, since, in addition to change the microbial community, its
absorption and efﬁcacy can be affected by the patient(cid:48)s own microbiota [125,126]. Therefore,
this variable must be taken into consideration in future studies where the main aim is the
reduction of symptoms in these patients through microbiome modulating solutions.

During this review, we have found numerous studies and reviews with microbiota
modulators that tested the changes in anxiety levels. However, studies generally focused
on patients with other pathologies, especially individuals with irritable bowel syndrome
and major depression, as other authors also point out [114]. For this reason, as well as for
the co-occurrence with EDs, we considered it necessary to collect those studies focused on
healthy individuals with anxiety or those subjected to stressful conditions that can lead to
anxious states.

One of the main conclusions of the present study is that it seems that the effect of
probiotics in reducing anxiety seems all the more effective the higher the baseline anxiety
level of the individual. Of the 14 studies, seven reported basal anxiety or stress based
on the HADS-A [99], STAI [101,103,107], Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety-A (HAM-
A), [106] or Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS-10) scales [108,109]. Of these seven studies, ﬁve
achieved a positive outcome in reducing anxiety, despite using different treatments and
conditions [99,106–109], while the same strain (L. casei Shirota) failed to decrease subjective
anxiety levels in the other two remaining studies. This observation coincides with the
sub-analysis of two groups with different baseline levels of distress, where no signiﬁcant
improvement was observed in the normative distress group after probiotic treatment [100].
Similarly, this occurs in depressive symptoms, where a meta-analysis with a total of
1349 patients showed that probiotic supplementation signiﬁcantly improved the moods of
individuals with mild–moderate depressive symptoms versus healthy individuals [127].
This trend is also observed in mice, but not rats, according to a meta-analysis, where a
subgroup analysis revealed that probiotic administration signiﬁcantly reduced anxiety-like
behavior in diseased but not in naïve animals [94].

The studies in this review bring up some points that deserve to be considered for
future studies in the anxiety ﬁeld. First, we have not found a relationship between the main
outcomes and the use of a multi strain or a single strain product. This fact corroborates once
again that it is the intrinsic characteristics of the strains and their combinations and not the
number of strains added in a product that determine its efﬁcacy. A recent review based on
65 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for eight different diseases remarks on our ﬁndings
and shows how, in most cases, multi-strain mixtures are not signiﬁcantly more effective
than single-strain probiotics [128]. Secondly, we found a great diversity of questionnaires
used to measure anxiety levels, questionnaires based on self-reports and not supervised
by specialized personnel. In one study, authors used modiﬁed questionnaires of STAI6
and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), which was not validated [110]. This
makes it difﬁcult to obtain comparable results among studies. For this reason, the use of
speciﬁc biomarkers and the choice of the right questionnaire for the right population is
needed. One should be cautious about the title of the instrument and ﬁnd a compromise
between precision and respondent burden [129]. Finally, it is necessary to mention the few
studies with postbiotics in the ﬁeld, only one, despite the growing interest that this “-biotic”
generates due its several advantages over probiotics, in terms of stability or use in several
food matrices.

Interestingly, two studies measured plasma pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as IFN-
γ and TNF-α after probiotic treatment, obtaining reduced levels as anxiety decreased.
Moreover, these two cytokines were signiﬁcantly correlated with psychological traits
of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 42 (DASS-42) (anxiety and stress), indicating that
inﬂammation is probably a major cause of stress and anxiety [108,109]. In fact, inﬂammation
affects anxiety-related brain regions such as amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

26 of 43

cortex [130]. Therefore, the use of speciﬁc probiotic strains with anti-inﬂammatory effects
could be a powerful coadjuvant tool in the treatment or prevention of anxiety, which, as
mentioned, is usually linked to other pathologies, such as EDs.

In addition to their anti-inﬂammatory effects, probiotics can also act on anxiety states
in various ways, although we insist again that these characteristics will vary depending on
the probiotic strain chosen. First, probiotics can attenuate the increased and prolonged acti-
vation of the HPA axis in GAD patients. In murine models, B. breve CCFM1025 signiﬁcantly
reduced the hyperactive HPA response, possibly via regulating the expression of gluco-
corticoid receptors (Nr3c1) [131]. These results are remarkable, because persistent HPA
hyperactivity has been associated with higher rates of relapse, and glucocorticoid receptor
function is impaired in anxiety disorders [132]. Other probiotic strains can also regulate
the HPA axis, improving the systemic and nervous antioxidant status [133], reducing cFos
protein expression in different brain areas, and changing the brain plasticity due to BDNF
production [134]. Second, some strains from Biﬁdobacterium genus such as B. adolescentis
PRL2019 and B. adolescentis HD17T2H can stimulate the in vivo production of GABA [44].
This inhibitory neurotransmitter and its neurotransmitter system is the target of BZs to treat
anxiety disorder [135]. In zebraﬁsh, probiotics can also modulate the GABAergic pathway
through the differential expression of genes such as gabra1 that encode the GABA-A alpha
1 receptor and serotonin transporter A (slc6a4a) [136]. Some probiotics can also increase the
serotonin pathway and maintain the levels of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are
higher in stressed subjects [109]. Finally, oxidative stress and intestinal permeability are also
therapeutic targets and ﬁelds of enormous interest in probiotics due to their relationship
with anxiety [137,138]. The increase of antioxidant enzymatic and non-enzymatic defenses
in rat brains generated neuroprotective effects and reduced compulsiveness/anxiety using
a marble burying test and open ﬁeld test [93]. Interestingly, the strain B.longum CECT
7347 that showed antioxidant capacity in the nematode C. elegans [139] and improved the
structure of the intestinal epithelium in a murine model of enteropathy by gliadin [140] also
decreased anxiety behaviors in zebraﬁsh [95]. Weissella paramesenteroides WpK4 also exerted
their beneﬁcial roles in the gut–brain axis through the reinforcement of the intestinal barrier
in murine models of colitis and chronic stress [141]. Therefore, the effect of probiotics on
anxiety cannot be attributed to a single mechanism of action, nor do all probiotics have the
same characteristics to exert their effect on anxiety. Physical and psychological characteris-
tics of AN patients entail differences in their gut microbiota composition [58,59]. Different
studies have shown the involvement of the intestinal microbiota in neuroendocrine and
metabolic pathways, including SCFA and anorexigenic hormones like αMSH [52], as well
its association with gut inﬂammation. Different microorganisms are associated with the
features of the disorder: Biﬁdobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. are involved in the
regulation of anxiety; Enterococcus spp., Escherichia spp., Streptococcus spp., Candida spp.
and Bacillus spp. are related to mood regulation [53,54]. Furthermore, LPS produced by
gram-negative bacteria are related to the regulation of food intake [55]. Although several
studies are conducted in order to recognize the dysbiosis of AN subjects, well-designed
studies are needed for a complete understanding of the disbalances of gut microbiota of
these patients, in addition to more research aimed at knowing the molecular pathways
responsible for the disorder.

Despite the studies reporting on the intestinal dysbiosis in AN patients, reports
about the composition of gut microbiota of BN and BED patients are scarce. The main
molecular pathway studied is the anorexigenic and anxiogenic caseinolyitic protease b
(ClpB) produced by Eschericchia coli species. Studies in AN patients showed an increased
abundance of E. coli linked to the production of the ClpB neuropeptide [63]. Although there
are no human studies in BN and BED, preclinical models of EDs show the mediator effect
of ClpB with the gut–brain axis [51,87,90]. Initiatives such as BEGIN [88] are necessary to
understand the gut microbiota composition in these patients.

This review shows some of the desirable characteristics in future microbiome-based
solutions for eating disorders: ﬁrst, the decrease of the anorexigenic ClpB protein in an AN

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 2351

patients, whose plasma concentration is correlated with proportion of Enterobacteriaceae in
faeces [142]. The screening of probiotic strains with antagonistic properties against ClpB
protein producers could be helpful in the treatment of EDs. Second, the modulation of the
ghrelinergic signaling to balance the feeding behavior could be another mechanism for the
development of new therapeutic tools. In fact, different Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium
strains are able to modulate the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) [143]. Finally, the increase of
butyrate-producing gut commensals by cross-feeding from some species of Biﬁdobacterium
could stimulate epithelial cell proliferation. Butyrate would reinforce the intestinal wall,
resulting in a larger absorptive surface to improve nutrients absorption from the diet [144].
As is discussed above, anxiety can promote Eds, and they often appear together. Therefore,
reducing anxiety levels through microbiome modulators could be an additional strategy to
prevent the EDs.

Knowledge of the intestinal microbiota will allow progress in the study of the pato-
physiological mechanisms of the EDs in order to establish possible therapeutic options as
probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. The correction of dysbiosis may be associated
with the physical and emotional well-being of ED subjects.

4. Materials and Methods

This systematic review has been performed following the PRISMA statement for
systematic reviews and meta-analyses [145,146], which includes deﬁnition of the research
question and bibliographic search; data collection, evaluation, comparison, and synthesis;
and critical analysis and ﬁndings presentation, indicating the strengths and weakness of the
studies evaluated (Figure 1). A meta-analysis to evaluate the role of microbiota in anxiety
and/or EDs was not considered due to the experimental design and clinical differences
observed among the studies selected as well as by the low sample size achieved in these
studies, which would generate an important bias in the statistical results.

The bibliographic search strategy was conducted to identify all studies reporting mi-
crobiota alterations in patients diagnosed with anxiety and/or EDs (AN, BN, or BED), also
highlighting the use of probiotics as therapeutic tools. The electronic databases consulted
were PubMed (MeSH), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus. The
following descriptors were used (as MeSH terms or not) with Boolean operators (AND/OR)
in multiple combinations (see Supplemental Material S1): Section 2.1. “((fecal microbiota)
OR (gut microbiota)) AND (generalized anxiety disorder)”; Section 2.2. “(microbiota OR
microbiome OR dysbiosis) AND (anorexia nervosa)”; Section 2.3. “(microbiota OR gas-
trointestinal microbiome OR dysbiosis) AND (bulimia nervosa OR binge-eating disorder)”;
Section 2.4. “Probiotics AND (anxiety OR anorexia nervosa OR bulimia nervosa OR binge-
eating disorder)” and ” (Psychobiotic OR probiotic OR prebiotic OR symbiotic OR fecal
transplantation OR postbiotic) AND (generalized anxiety disorder OR anxiety)”.

Inclusion criteria were papers written in English and Spanish (with no geographi-
cal restrictions) published from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2020; the presence of
the selected terms in the title or as keywords; original research performed in humans;
selected experimental designs including clinical trials, case–control, longitudinal cohort,
cross-sectional, and case report studies. Sample size ≥ 10. The quality of controlled
studies referring to randomized, nonrandomized, and pre-post treatment was critically
appraised following the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool [147]. Exclusion criteria
were infant population to 10 years old and no association with other psychiatric diseases.
Interventions using only prebiotics or immunotherapy were also excluded for Section 2.4.

Figure 1. Methodological ﬂowchart following preferred reporting items for systematic review based
on PRISMA.

The selection of original manuscripts started by screening titles and abstracts for inclu-
sion, creating a reference list of relevant papers for the topics explored in this review. Two
investigators (T.L. and N.-T.E.) conducted each stage of the studies selection, deleted dupli-
cate inputs, and reviewed studies as excluded or requiring further assessment. All data
were extracted by one investigator (T.L.) and cross-checked by a second investigator (N.-
T.E.). In case of discrepancies in the selected studies, we opted for reconciliation through
team discussion. The information evaluated from each study was ﬁrst author, experimental
design, number of participants, control groups, main outcomes/ﬁndings, conclusions, and
strengths and limitations (including biases). The eligibility criteria followed the PICOS
(patient, intervention, comparators, outcome, and study design) approach. Population:
Men or women diagnosed with anxiety or ED (anorexia, bulimia, or binge-eating disor-
der); intervention: if applicable, any doses, strains, or species of probiotics administered;
comparators: if applicable, placebo or no probiotics; outcome: the primary outcome was
microbiota composition in anxiety or ED patients. All authors performed a critical appraisal
for the studies selected following the inclusion criteria, also analyzing the methodology
and key results.

In the literature evaluated following PRISMA methodology, we observed heteroge-
neous results due to the different populations (patients with different ED) compared; the
distinct health conditions derived to the clinical complexity of ED diagnosis; the reduced
number of randomized trials in ED patients using probiotics; and the small sample size
observed in these studies. Finally, the studies indicated in Figure 1 for each section of
this review were identiﬁed through databases searching, selecting after meeting the in-
clusion criteria, and the application of the exclusion criteria the following: Section 2.1 (3),
Section 2.2 (14), Section 2.3 (13), and Section 2.4 (20).

Finally, the articles were evaluated using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach, which describes four levels of
quality of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very [148]. Quality of evidence was obtained
(Table 4) after judging the designs of the studies, the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness,
imprecision, number of subjects, and publication bias.
