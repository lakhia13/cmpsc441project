Physical activity, exercise, and mental disorders:  
it is time to move on

Felipe Barreto Schuch,1*  Davy Vancampfort2

Abstract

Introduction: Physical activity, conceptualized as any bodily movement that results in energy expenditure, 
and its structured form, exercise, play an important role in public health, preventing and treating a wide 
range of physical conditions, including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and obesity. 
Objective:  This  article  aims  to  provide  a  brief  overview  and  summary  of  the  evidence  on:  1)  the 
preventive effects of physical activity on a wide range of mental disorders; 2) the role of physical activity 
in promoting the physical health of people with mental disorders; 3) the role of exercise as a strategy to 
manage mental health symptoms in a range of mental disorders; and 4) the challenges and barriers faced 
when implementing exercise in clinical practice.
Methods: This was a narrative review.
Results:  Compelling  evidence  has  demonstrated  that  physical  activity  and  exercise  can  also  prevent 
common  mental  disorders,  such  as  depression  and  anxiety  disorders,  and  have  multiple  beneficial 
effects  on  the  physical  and  mental  health  of  people  with  a  wide  range  of  mental  disorders.  This  body 
of evidence has been incorporated in national and international guidelines over the last decades, which 
have recommended the inclusion of physical activity and exercise as therapeutic approaches for mental 
disorders, mainly for depression and schizophrenia. Nonetheless, implementation into clinical practice has 
been slow, probably due to barriers associated both with patients and mental health professionals. 
Conclusion:  Increases in  physical  activity  levels  in  populations  are  likely  to  reduce  the  mental  health 
burden. Exercise interventions should be incorporated to the routine care of people with mental disorders 
due its multiple benefits on physical and mental health outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach is needed 
to overcome patients barriers and enhance adherence and benefits. 
Keywords: Exercise, physical activity, mental disorders, physical health, mental health.

Introduction

Mental  disorders  are  highly  prevalent  and 

burdensome. It is estimated that approximately 12% of 

of  comorbid  somatic  disorders,2-4  leading  to  a  life 
expectancy  15  to  20  years  shorter  when  compared  to 
that of the general population.5 Risk factors associated 
with  this  high  rate  of  physical  comorbidities  are  a 

the  global  population  suffered  from  a  mental  disorder 

genetic  vulnerability  in  people  with  mental  disorders, 

in  2019,  accounting  for  roughly  5%  of  the  disability-

side effects of pharmacological treatments, and a poor 

adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)  and  16%  of  the  years 
lived  with  disability  worldwide.1  The  mental  health 
burden  is  further  compounded  by  a  high  prevalence 

lifestyle,  including  unhealthy  eating  habits,  substance 

abuse,  poor  sleep,  low  levels  of  physical  activity,  and 
long periods spent on sedentary behavior.6-9

Expenses  in  mental  health  care,  led  by  expenses

in  pharmacological 
increased 
substantially over the last decades.10 However, current 
approaches  have  not  been  sufficient  to  further  reduce 

interventions,  have 

available  to  date  on:  1)  the  preventative  effects  of 

physical  activity  and  exercise  on  mental  disorders;  2) 

the  role  of  physical  activity  and  exercise  in  promoting 

the  prevalence  of  these  disorders  at  a  population

level  –  in  fact,  that  prevalence  has  remained  almost 

the role of physical activity and exercise as strategies to 

stable over the last 30 years worldwide. In fact, rates 

manage mental health symptoms in a range of mental 

of  common  mental  disorders  such  as  depression  and 

disorders;  and  4)  the  challenges  and  barriers  faced 

anxiety  appear  to  even  be  increasing  among  the 
younger generations.7
Pharmacological 

including 
antidepressants11  and  antipsychotics,12  are  still  the 
frontline strategy for symptom management. However, 

treatments, 

the  long-term  treatment  effects  of  pharmacotherapy 
are  being  questioned.13  For  many  people  with  mental 
disorders,  psychotropic  medication  does  not  result  in 

clinically meaningful improvement in the long-term, and 
side  effects  such  as  significant  weight  gain,12  elevated 
blood glucose levels, and loss of sexual interest, among 
others,14  are  considerable.15,16  These  side  effects  often 
result  in  medication  discontinuation  and  distress  and 
can negatively impact patients’ lives.17-19 There has also 
been  little  improvement  in  the  primary  prevention  of 

by  mental  health  professionals  when  implementing 

exercise in clinical practice.

Effects  of  physical  activity  on  the 
prevention of mental disorders

Mental disorders are multifactorial and are linked to 

a  multitude  of  nonmodifiable  and  modifiable  risk  and 
protective factors.24-26 There is available evidence from 
prospective and more complex Mendelian randomization 

studies that physical activity is a modifiable protective 

factor against the incidence of some mental disorders in 
people free from diagnosis.27

Evidence  from  a  meta-analysis  of  49  prospective 

mental disorders, with clear gaps in both the evidence 
and implementation of such interventions.6

studies,  including  data  from  more  than  260,000 

participants,  demonstrates  that  people  with  higher 

Thus, additional approaches towards the prevention 

physical  activity  levels  are  less  likely  to  develop 

and  treatment  of  mental  disorders,  which  can  be 

delivered  alongside  or  in  the  absence  of  traditional 

mental health care strategies, are needed to reduce the 

depression  (odds  ratio  [OR]  =  0.83,  95%  confidence 
interval  [95%CI]  =  0.79-0.88).28  That  relationship 
remained significant regardless of age group, sex, and 

global and growing burden of these conditions. A large 

geographic region and after adjustment for a number 

and new body of evidence has been accumulated over 

the  last  decades  suggesting  that  physical  activity  and 

exercise might be such approaches. Although the body 

of  potential  confounders,  including  weight,  smoking, 
and the presence of physical diseases or impairments.28 
Even  though  the  analysis  was  adjusted  for  multiple 

of evidence can be considered new, these interventions 

confounding  factors,  other  behavioral,  social,  and 

are not.

“Walking 

is  man’s  best  medicine,”  quoted 
Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.).20 The quote demonstrates 
that physical activity, nowadays defined as “any bodily 
movement  produced  by  skeletal  muscles  that  results 
in  energy  expenditure,”21  and  exercise,  defined  as  “a 
subset  of  physical  activity  that  is  planned,  structured, 

genetic  confounders  cannot  be  fully  ruled  out  in 
observational  designs.29  Advanced  epidemiological 
study  designs,  such  as  Mendelian  randomization 

studies,  can  minimize  these  confounding  factors 
and  provide  stronger  insights  on  causal  inferences.29 
Mendelian randomization is an alternative method that 

uses the genetic variation of known genes associated 

and  repetitive  and  has  as  a  final  or  an  intermediate 

with  the  outcome  as  a  natural  experiment,  allowing 

objective the improvement or maintenance of physical 
fitness,”21  have  been  recognized,  since  the  ancient 
Greeks  of  the  classical  period,  as  having  preventative 

the  evaluation  of  a  modifiable  (nongenetic)  exposure 
factor  over  the  outcome  in  observational  studies.29 
Two  Mendelian  randomization  studies  reinforce  the 

and  therapeutic  effects  on  human  health.  Currently,  a 

plethora of evidence supports the claim that “exercise 
is  medicine,”22  due  to  its  preventative  and  therapeutic 
effects on a broad range of physical conditions, including 

neurological, metabolic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary 
diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and cancer.23

A large body of evidence has demonstrated that these 
preventative  and  therapeutic  effects  are  extended  to 

finding  that  physical  activity  protects  from  incident 
depression.30,31  First,  a 
association  study  using  data  from  participants  of 

large-scale  genome-wide 

the  UK  Biobank  that  assessed  physical  activity  using 

objective  measures  (accelerometry)  has  shown  that 

physical  activity  has  causal  protective  effects  against 
depression.30  The  effect  is  consistent  in  magnitude 
with  the  findings  of  cohort  studies  (OR  =  0.74,

95%CI = 0.59-0.92). This result is corroborated by a 

that  reducing  the  levels  of  physical  inactivity  by  10% 

second,  longitudinal,  Mendelian  randomization  study 

using  data  from  the  Partners  Biobank,  a  dataset 

worldwide  would  have  resulted  in  more  than  500,000 
deaths averted in 2008.37

collected from primary care patients. Interestingly, the 

People  with  severe  mental  disorders,  such  as 

authors found that physical activity can offset the risk 

psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders, and depression, 

of depression across all levels of genetic vulnerability to 
depression, including people at higher genetic risk.31

Evidence was also found for the protective effects of 
physical activity against incident stress and anxiety.32 
A  meta-analysis  of  11  prospective  studies,  including 

spend an average of 7.8 hours in sedentary behavior per 

day, being significantly more sedentary than age- and 
gender-matched controls.9 They also spend an average 
of 38 minutes per day in moderate to vigorous physical 

activity  (95%CI  =  32-45),  significantly  lower  than 

more  than  69,000  participants,  demonstrated  that 

controls.  Moreover,  they  are  50%  less  likely  to  meet 

higher levels of physical activity significantly reduced 

incident  anxiety  (OR  =  0.74,  95%CI  =  0.62-0.88) 

in  the  analysis  adjusted  for  multiple  confounding 

physical activity guidelines (OR = 1.5; 95%CI = 1.1-2.0) 
compared  to  controls.9  Among  individuals  with  mental 
disorders,  lower  physical  activity  levels  are  associated 

factors. The examination of specific anxiety disorders 

with being male, being single, being unemployed, fewer 

indicated  protective  effects  against  agoraphobia  (OR 

years  of  education,  higher  body  mass  index  (BMI), 

=  0.43,  95%CI  =  0.19-0.99)  and  post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  (OR  =  0.58,  95%CI  =  0.39-0.86).32 
Because of the small number of studies on the topic, 

further  exploration  on  the  consistency  of  the  effects 

across  age  groups,  sex,  and  geographic  regions  was 

not possible.

There  is  limited  and  conflicting  evidence  on  the 

protective  effects  of  physical  activity  against  bipolar 

disorders  and  schizophrenia.  For  bipolar  disorder,  one 

prospective  study  found  that  higher  levels  of  physical 

activity  were  associated  with  a  greater  likelihood  of 
incident  bipolar  disorder  at  follow-up.33  However,  a 
Mendelian  randomization  study  found  that  physical 

activity  has  a  causal  protective  effect  against  bipolar 
disorders  (OR  =  0.49,  95%CI  =  0.31-0.76).34  It  is 
expected that additional studies will offer new insights 

into the topic.

Lastly,  evidence 

from  a  meta-analysis  of  5 

longer illness duration, antidepressant and antipsychotic 

medication  use,  and  having  a  lower  cardiorespiratory 

fitness. Notably, some differences were observed across 
diagnoses.9  People  with  schizophrenia  were  the  least 
active, while people with bipolar disorder were the most 

physically active, although people with bipolar disorder 

are  the  ones  reporting  the  higher  levels  of  sedentary 
behavior.9

The  literature  has  demonstrated  that  exercise 
programs  result  in  reductions  in  body  weight,38  waist 
circumference,39  BMI,38  epicardial  adipose  tissue,38 
and  subcutaneous  adipose  tissue38  in  people  with 
lifestyle  counseling  programs, 
depression.  Also, 

including  physical  activity  promotion  and  exercise 

programs,  are  the  most  effective  interventions  for 

weight reduction (standardized mean difference [SMD] 

= -0.98), followed by psychoeducation (SMD = -0.77), 
in people with schizophrenia.40

prospective  studies  demonstrated  that  higher  physical 

Changes  in  lipid  profile,  markers  associated  with 

activity  levels  were  associated  with  a  lower  risk  of 

incident psychosis or schizophrenia (OR = 0.72, 95%CI 
= 0.53-0.99).35 However, when the analysis was limited 
to the two studies that adjusted for confounding factors, 
the significant associations were no longer supported.35 
The Mendelian randomization study that addressed the 

topic does not support the notion that physical activity 
protects from psychosis or schizophrenia.34

Effects  of  physical  activity  and  exercise 
on  the  physical  health  of  people  with 
mental disorders

Physical  activity  is  a  well-established  protective 
factor 
syndrome, 
cardiovascular diseases,23 and all-cause mortality in the 
general  population.36  It  was  estimated,  for  example, 

diabetes,  metabolic 

against 

incident  cardiovascular  diseases,  and  cardiovascular 
mortality are also evident.41 In people with depression, 
exercise significantly increases high-density lipoproteins 
levels.38  Lifestyle 
interventions  have  also  proved 
effective in reducing triglycerides, total cholesterol, and 

low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (SMD  ranging  from 
-0.35 to -0.37) in people with schizophrenia.40

Lastly,  exercise  interventions  yield  large  increases 
in  exercise  capacity  in  people  with  mental  disorders,42 
another  independent  risk  factor  for  cardiovascular 

mortality. For example, a meta-analysis of randomized 

controlled  trials  (RCT)  demonstrated  that  exercise 

interventions promoted increases equivalent to 3 mL/kg/
min in people with depression43 and 2.79 mL/kg/min in 
people with schizophrenia.44 These increases in aerobic 
capacity are clinically meaningful, as they are associated 
with  a  decrement  in  all-cause  and  cardiovascular 
disease  mortality.45  More  specifically,  increases  of

3.5  mL/kg/min  are  associated  with  decrements  of 

exercise improves some cognitive outcomes, such as 

13  and  15%  in  the  risk  of  all-cause  mortality  and 
cardiovascular disease, respectively.45

Effects  of  physical  activity  and  exercise 
on the mental health symptoms of people 
with mental disorders

International  guidelines 

for 

treating  mental 

disorders  have  begun  to  incorporate  the  available 

scientific  evidence  and  propose  that  physical  activity 

and  exercise  should  be  integrated  into  mental  health 
care.46-49  For  example, 
Association’s  guidelines  on  the  promotion  of  physical 

the  European  Psychiatric 

visual learning and memory (Hedge’s g = 0.24, 95%CI 
= 0.00-0.47),54 and improves physical (SMD = 0.53, 
95%CI = 0.22-0.84) and psychological (SMD = 0.53, 
95%CI = 0.22-0.85) domains of quality of life.55

Stubbs et al.56 conducted a meta-analysis including 
six trials assessing people with panic disorder (N = 2), 

generalized anxiety disorder (N = 1), or posttraumatic 

stress  disorder  (N  =  2),  in  addition  to  a  further  RCT 

that  included  people  with  either  panic  disorder,  social 
phobia,  or  generalized  anxiety  disorder.56  The  authors 
found  that  exercise  reduced  anxiety  symptoms  with  a 

moderate  effect  size  (SMD  =  -0.58,  95%CI  =  -1.0  to 

-0.76). The small number of studies included precluded 

any  further  analyses  exploring  the  effects  of  different 

activity  in  people  with  mental  illness  state  that  there 

is  considerable  empirical  evidence  supporting  the  use

groups and sexes.56

incorporated  as  a  routine  care  treatment  even  before 
pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy.49 The latest version 
of the Brazilian Medical Association’s guidelines on the 
treatment of depression, published back in 2009,50 does 
not mention the use of exercise or physical activity in the 

treatment of depression; however, exercise is listed in a 
separate guideline of nonpharmacological treatments.46 
Currently,  there  is  a  plethora  of  evidence  supporting 

the  beneficial  effects  of  physical  activity  and  exercise 
in  people  with  a  range  of  mental  disorders.51  These 
benefits are, for some diagnoses, extended beyond the 

core  diagnostic  symptoms,  including  improvements  in 
cognitive symptoms and quality of life.51

symptoms  (SMD  =  -0.54,  95%CI  =  -0.95  to  -0.13), 

and negative symptoms (SMD = -0.44, 95%CI = -0.78 
to  -0.09).57  In  another  study  by  the  same  authors, 
exercise  also  improved  global  cognition  compared  to 

non-physically  active  interventions  of  treatment-as-

usual (Hedge’s g = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.19-0.64) in people 
with schizophrenia.58

There is some evidence from nonrandomized studies 

that  exercise  might  effectively  reduce  depressive 

symptoms  in  people  with  bipolar  disorders,  but  there 

is a paucity of studies reporting the effects of exercise 
on  manic  or  hypomanic  symptoms.59  In  fact,  some 
people  with  bipolar  disorders  refer  to  exercise  as  a

exercise  effectively  reduces  depressive  symptoms 

in  people  with  depression  (people  with  subclinical 
symptoms  or  with  a  diagnosis  of  major  depressive 
disorder).52  In  people  with  major  depression,  the 
effect  size  was  large  (SMD  =  1.13,  95%CI  =  0.46-

1.81)  when  compared  to  physically  inactive  control 
groups.52  In  another  meta-analysis,  aerobic  and 
mixed  (aerobic  and  strength  combined)  exercises 

seemed to be more effective than strength exercises 
alone.53  However,  a  more  recent  review  including 
a  greater  number  of  trials  has  demonstrated  that 

strength training alone effectively reduces depressive 

symptoms,  with  a  moderate  effect  size  (Hedge’s  g 
=  0.66,  95%CI  =  0.48-0.83).53  Age  and  sex  do  not 
seem to alter the magnitude of the effect, suggesting 
that  strength  training  is  effective  for  all  age  groups 
and sexes. For depression, there is also evidence that

beneficial  and  harmful  at  the  same  time,  provoking 
relaxation and a lift in mood.60 Since these findings are 
based  on  qualitative  studies,  well-designed  trials  are 

required to clarify these effects in more detail.

Lastly,  exercise  programs  have  been  shown  to 

improve  anxiety  and  depression  in  children  with 

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (weighted mean 
difference  [WMD  =  -1.84,  95%CI  =  -2.65  to  -1.03).61 
Thought  problems  (WMD  =  -3.49,  95%CI  =  -5.51  to 

-1.47), social problems (WMD = -5.08, 95%CI = -7.34 

to  -2.82),  and  aggressive  behaviors  (WMD  =  -3.90, 

95%CI  =  -7.10  to  -0.70)  are  also  improved  following 
physical activity interventions.61 However, hyperactive/
impulsive  symptoms  (WMD  =  -0.01,  95%CI  =  -0.32-
0.29) and inattention symptoms (WMD = -0.22; 95%CI 
=  -0.51-0.08)  do  not  seem  to  improve  significantly 
after exercise.61

Barriers and challenges for the promotion 
of physical activity and exercise in people 
with mental disorders

poor  physical  health  and  fatigue.  In  the  psychological 

arena,  high  levels  of  stress  and  depression,  as  well 
as a lack of motivation, have been  reported.66 To help 
patients  overcome  these  personal  barriers,  evidence-

Even though the evidence on the mental and physical 

based  theory-driven  cognitive  behavioral  strategies 

health benefits of physical activity and exercise for people 

with mental disorders is growing fast, the translation of 
these  beneficial  findings  into  clinical  practice  is  slow.62 
For  example,  in  a  very  recent  survey  evaluating  73 

that facilitate autonomous motivation have been shown 
to  be  effective67  and  should  be  adopted.  Autonomous 
motivation  includes  for  example  having  identified 

motives  for  exercising,  i.e.,  experiencing  the  personal 

mental  health  professionals  working  on  psychosocial 

importance of exercise due to physical, mental, or social 

rehabilitation  centers  in  the  metropolitan  area  of  Porto 

benefits  (identified  regulation).  Another  related  form 

Alegre,  southern  Brazil,  including  psychiatrists,  general 

of  autonomous  motivation  is  integrated  regulation,  in 

practitioners,  psychologists,  nurses,  social  workers, 

which  motives  for  exercising  are  brought  in  harmony 

and  exercise  professionals  (e.g.,  physiotherapists  and 

with  other  prevailing  life  values,  e.g.,  being  an  active 

physical educators), more than 40% never, and almost 

contributor  to  the  community,  for  which  one  needs  to 

22%  occasionally  prescribed  or  recommended  exercise 
to  their  patients.62  Approximately  35%  of  the  study 
participants usually or always prescribed or recommended 
exercise to their patients.62 In this scenario, determining 
the  most  common  barriers  to  implementing  exercise 

be  healthy  –  to  the  point  that  being  active  becomes 

prioritized  within  several  life  domains.  A  third  form  of 

autonomous  motivation  includes  intrinsic  regulation, 

which entails engaging in exercise for its own sake, i.e., 

because  one  finds  exercising  stimulating,  challenging, 

in  prevention  and  treatment  programs  for  people  with 

or  enjoyable  by  itself.  Autonomous  motivation  differs 

mental  disorders  would  help  to  optimize  resource 

from controlled regulations such as exercising to avoid 

allocation when delivering physical activity and exercise 

criticism  or  to  obtain  external  appreciation  (external 

services  in  clinical  practice.  Barriers  are  known  to  be 

regulation). The imposition of pressures onto one’s own 

multidimensional  and  include  individual,  patient-level 
and systemic, socio-ecological factors.62

In  the  previously  mentioned  study,62  the  main 
reason  for  not  prescribing  or  recommending  exercise 

functioning, for  instance,  by reinforcing one’s  exercise 

engagement  with  feelings  of  guilt,  self-criticism,  or 

contingent  self-worth,  is  also  a  controlled  form  of 

exercise  motivation,  i.e.,  a  person  could  experience 

was  rather  systemic.  Mental  health  professionals 

feelings  of  guilt,  shame,  or  low  self-worth  when  not 

believe that exercise prescription is the responsibility of 

exercising  (introjected  regulation).  Therefore,  instead 

exercise professionals, such as exercise physiologists or 

of  engaging  in  exercise  for  the  experienced  benefits, 

physical therapists, and not a part of their own mental 
health profession.62 This is not surprising since exercise 
prescription  is  indeed  considered  a  task  for  physical 

educators and physiotherapists within many health care 
systems, including in Brazil.63 However, there is emerging 
evidence that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary in 

order to increase physical activity and exercise adoption 
and  maintenance.  In  other  words,  recommending, 

discussing, and proposing lifestyle changes, while at the 

importance,  or  enjoyment,  they  engage  for  thinking 
that others would consider them lazy otherwise.67-69

Previous  research  has  shown  that  to  facilitate 

autonomous  motivation,  psychological  needs 

for 

autonomy  (i.e.,  experiencing  a  sense  of  psychological 

freedom  when  exercising),  competence  (i.e.,  feeling 

effective  to  attain  desired  outcomes),  and  relatedness 
(i.e., being socially connected) need to be nurtured.70 In 
clinical practice, this can be achieved by offering clear 

same time exploring individual barriers to such changes, 

exercise choices, supporting the patient’s own initiative, 

should  be  a  result  of  combined,  coordinated  efforts  of 

avoiding  the  use  of  external  rewards,  using  autonomy 

all professionals involved in patient care, and not only 
of  exercise  professionals.64  For  example,  receiving  a 
recommendation  from  a  physician  and  other  health 

care  professionals  is  associated  with  greater  exercise 
engagement  in  people  with  anxiety  and  depression.65 
Therefore,  in  order  to  move  on,  physical  activity  and 

exercise should be considered everyone’s responsibility 

in multidisciplinary prevention and treatment programs 

for people with mental disorders.

Patient-level 

barriers 

can

than “you should exercise” and “you have to do aerobic 

exercise  three  times  per  week”),  giving  constructive 

feedback, showing enthusiasm and interest, and offering 

both  individual  support  and  group-based  exercise 

sessions.  Exploring 
individual  preferences,  views, 
and  concerns  is  particularly  important.67-69  Personal 
preferences should be considered in all and every aspect

Conclusions

The  current  evidence  demonstrates  that  physical 

activity  increments  at  a  population  level  is  likely  to 

reduce the prevalence of mental disorders, particularly 

common  mental  disorders  (depression  and  anxiety). 
From  a  clinical  perspective,  people  with  mental 

disorders are a vulnerable group, with physical health 

disparities.  One  of  the  reasons  for  these  disparities 

can be attributed to poor lifestyle choices, such as low 

physical activity levels. Physical activity is a well-known 

protective factor against cardiometabolic diseases, and 

embedding it into routine care will very much likely help 

reduce this health disparity while also helping to keep 

mental health symptoms at bay. Incorporating physical 

activity  and  exercise  programs  is  a  multidisciplinary 

task that requires attention and effort from all mental 

health professionals working collaboratively. Although 

exercise  professionals  are  the  ones  who  prescribe 

and  supervise  exercise  sessions,  exploring  patient-

level  barriers  and  developing  strategies  to  overcome
