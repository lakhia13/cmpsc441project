Abstract

Background: There is a strong stigma attached to mental disorders preventing those affected from getting
psychological help. The consequences of stigma are worse for racial and/or ethnic minorities compared to racial
and/or ethnic majorities since the former often experience other social adversities such as poverty and
discrimination within policies and institutions. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the
evidence on the impact of differences in mental illness stigma between racial minorities and majorities.
Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis included cross-sectional studies comparing mental illness
stigma between racial minorities and majorities. Systematic searches were conducted in the bibliographic databases
of PubMed, PsycINFO and EMBASE until 20th December 2018. Outcomes were extracted from published reports,
and meta-analyses, and meta-regression analyses were conducted in CMA software.

Results: After screening 2787 abstracts, 29 studies with 193,418 participants (N = 35,836 in racial minorities) were
eligible for analyses. Racial minorities showed more stigma than racial majorities (g = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.12 ~ 0.27) for
common mental disorders. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of these results. Multivariate meta-regression
analyses pointed to the possible moderating role of the number of studies with high risk of bias on the effect size.
Racial minorities have more stigma for common mental disorders when compared with majorities. Limitations
included moderate to high risk of bias, high heterogeneity, few studies in most comparisons, and the use of non-
standardized outcome measures.

Conclusions: Mental illness stigma is higher among ethnic minorities than majorities. An important clinical
implication of these findings would be to tailor anti-stigma strategies related with mental illnesses according to
specific racial and/or ethnic backgrounds with the intention to improve mental health outreach.

Background
Common mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression
and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent, disabling and
costly with diminished quality of life, medical morbidity
and mortality [1–3]. It
is estimated that every year
almost one in five people among the general population
worldwide suffers from CMDs [4, 5]. Even though many
people are affected by CMDs globally, there is a strong
stigma attached to CMDs and those who have them [6].
Mental
illness stigma is a multidimensional problem
causing great burden on those who are affected [6, 7].
Not only does it determine negative public opinion and
discrimination against people with mental illnesses [7]
but it also leads to not to seek or adequately participate
in psychological treatment [8–10].

There are various definitions of mental illness stigma in
the current stigma literature. Recently, the Mental Illness
Stigma Framework (MISF) has been proposed [11]
emphasising that how stigma is experienced differs de-
pending on the perspective of the general public who
often attributes stigma (i.e. stigmatizer) to those who have
illnesses (i.e. stigmatized) [11]. There are also
mental
shared perceptions and attributions between stigmatizer
and stigmatized (i.e. perceived stigma). Different cognitive,
affective and behavioural mechanisms are associated with
each of these perspectives. The cognitive mechanisms are
stereotypes referring to the collectively agreed upon nega-
tive beliefs about an individual with a mental illness (e.g.
dangerousness, weakness) [11]. The affective mechanisms
are prejudices which are emotional reactions generated by
stereotypes such as fear, anger and pity. The behavioural
mechanisms are named as discrimination such as with-
holding help, avoidance, segregation or coercion [11]. The
impact of stigma on an individual’s life can be understood
in terms of three components: 1) Experienced stigma, re-
ferring to the day-to-day experiences of stereotypes, preju-
dice and discrimination from others, 2) anticipated
stigma, the expectation to be a target of a stereotype,
prejudice or discrimination, and 3) internalised stigma,
which is the application of mental illness stigma to oneself
such as believing that they are dangerous to others or they
are incompetent [11].

There are differences in the extent of the impact of
mental illness stigma depending on the racial and/or eth-
nic background of those who are affected [11]. Early re-
search on the influence of ethnicity on the mental illness
stigma indicated that compared to the White group, the
non-White group perceived someone with mental illness
as more dangerous [12] and expressed greater need for
segregation than the White group [12]. These results were
replicated by more recent research comparing Asian
Americans [13–16], African Americans [17, 18] and His-
panics [19–21] with European Americans (White). Fur-
ther, the variation in mental illness stigma could be even

more so among specific ethnic groups within broad racial
categories [22]. For instance, in a large scale study repre-
sentative of the ethnic groups in Singapore, Subramaniam
and colleagues found that, those of Indian ethnicity who
also had low socio-economic status, perceived individuals
with mental illness as more dangerous and unpredictable,
and desired more social distance compared to those of
Malay and Chinese backgrounds [22]. Thus, there is inter-
sectionality in experiences of stigma [23, 24]. This per-
spective emphasises that the consequences of stigma are
worse for some racial and/or ethnic groups who have for
instance, personal incompetence attributions of mental ill-
ness [23] and who also face with other forms of “minority
stress” and adversities such as interpersonal and structural
discrimination within policies and institutions and low
socio-economic background [8–10, 23, 24].

To date, there are no prior meta-analyses investigating
racial and/or ethnic differences in mental illness stigma.
This could be due to the inconsistency in how stigma
mechanisms have been defined and measured [11]. One
implication of this gap in the literature is the lack of infor-
mation about the evidence base for developing culturally-
relevant anti-stigma interventions [25]. Since CMDs are
highly prevalent globally, it is important that psycho-social
interventions focus on changing the negative stereotypes
(e.g. I am incompetent) and/or discriminatory behaviours
(e.g. social withdrawal) related with CMDs among racial
and ethnic minorities specifically [25, 26]. Nevertheless,
there are promising theoretical developments in the
stigma field such as the MISF. There is also growing num-
ber of studies examining the ethnic variations in stigma
for CMDs in Western as well as in Non-Western coun-
tries. Thus, the objectives of the current study are twofold.
We examine the differences in mental illness stigma be-
tween racial minorities and majorities. We expect that ra-
cial minorities have more mental illness stigma for CMDs
compared to majorities. We also investigate if there are
variability in mental illness stigma between racial minor-
ities depending on race, quality of the studies and types of
stigma outcomes (self-report vs vignette).

Methods
Identification and selection of studies
Search strategy
A review protocol was developed based on the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analysis (PRISMA)-statement
(www.prisma-statement.
org) [27]. The protocol for this meta-analysis was regis-
tered at PROSPERO (CRD42018091080).

We conducted a comprehensive systematic literature
search in the bibliographic databases PubMed, Embase.
com and PsycINFO up to 20th December 2018, in collab-
oration with a medical librarian. Detailed search strategies

Eylem et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:879

for these databases are given in the Appendix 1. The fol-
lowing terms were used (including synonyms and closely
related words) as index terms or free-text words: “Social
stigma”, “Common mental disorders”, “Mood disorders”,
“Anxiety disorders”, “Depression”, “Stress disorders”, “Mi-
grants”, “Minority groups”. The search was performed
without date or language restriction. Search strategies for
other databases were built accordingly. We also checked
the references of the included studies to identify additional
relevant studies (see Fig. 1 for the Prisma Flowchart).

Inclusion criteria
The searches were limited to the following criteria: 1)
Peer-reviewed papers, 2) Racial minorities (i.e. defined
based on the classification of the country of the included
studies) 2) Racial majorities (i.e. defined based on the
classification of the country of the included studies) 3)
Adults aged 18 and above and 4) Participants with/with-
out common mental disorders (i.e. common mental

disorders are identified as depression and anxiety
spectrum disorders), 2) Empirical studies with cross-
sectional designs measuring mental illness stigma about
common mental disorders among racial minorities in
comparison to majorities 3) Studies were not limited to
the European populations only and studies carried out
in other continents were included.

Exclusion criteria
The exclusion criteria: 1) Publications
focusing on
stigma about help-seeking, HIV, physical disorders or
sexual minorities (if they are not from a racial minority
group), 2) Publications focusing on stigma about severe
mental health disorders (e.g. schizophrenia), 3) Empirical
studies without a comparison group (studies which are
not comparing different racial groups were excluded), 4)
Qualitative studies and 5) Publications focusing on ado-
lescent and children sample.

Quality assessment
We assessed the quality of the included studies using the
Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assess-
ment Tool (EPHPP). This tool assesses possible sources
of bias in observational studies and RCTs. Since we have
included cross-sectional studies, the following domains
of the tool were used in this study: (1) selection bias; (2)
study design; (3) confounders; (4) data collection method
and; (5) analyses. The studies received an overall assess-
ment in one of the following: 1) high risk of bias (studies
which scored high risk of bias in 3 or more of the assess-
ment domains); 2) moderate risk of bias (studies which
scored high risk of bias in 2 of the assessment domains)
and; 3) low risk of bias (studies which scored high risk
of bias in 1 of the assessment domains). Assessment was
carried out by two independent assessors and disagree-
ments were solved through discussions.

Data extraction
A customised data extraction form was generated and in-
cluded the following characteristics: Method of recruit-
ment into the study (community, clinical samples or other
recruitment type), target group (adults in general, older
adults, student population or other target group), types of
stigma perspectives, types of stigma mechanisms and
types of outcome measures used to measure stigmas (self-
report instruments, vignettes). Vignettes are case descrip-
tions of an individual, presenting symptoms of a CMD
[22] (see Appendix 2 for an example).

Covidence, online software for screening and data ex-
traction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, was
used for the review and extracting data. First, the results
of the online database searches were imported to covi-
dence. Two reviewers had personal accounts and se-
lected papers independently in a random order. A third
reviewer carried out the reference list search of the se-
lected papers. The titles of all studies were screened, and
the abstracts of the studies were checked regarding the
inclusion criteria. When no definitive decision could be
made based on the abstract, the original papers were
used. Discrepancies between the reviewers’ selections
were resolved through discussions. If not resolved, the
opinion of a fourth researcher was sought. The corre-
sponding author filled in the extraction form.

Conceptual frameworks
We conceptualised mental illness stigma based on the
MISF [11]. The types of perspectives, measured by the
studies, were categorised into three groups: 1) the per-
spective of the stigmatizer (i.e. Public attitudes and be-
liefs that other people devalue or discriminate against
individuals with mental illness. The specific components
are: stereotype, prejudice and discrimination); 2) The
the stigmatized (i.e. Personal beliefs,
perspective of

attitudes and perceived anger for having a mental illness.
The specific components are: experienced stigma, antici-
pated stigma and internalized stigma) and; 3) The per-
ceived stigma (i.e. shared experiences of stereotypes,
prejudices and discrimination between people who
stigmatize and who are stigmatized).

The concept of race-ethnicity was defined based on the
minority or majority classifications of the country of the
included studies. Because there were many ethnic groups
(e.g. Chinese, Indian) within the included studies, we de-
cided to use broad racial categories (e.g. Asian, Black) in
order to make the studies comparable [28]. Six racial
groups were identified in consultation with the categories
previously defined by Ünlü İnce and colleagues [29].
These categories were: Black (African background), Asian,
Hispanic (Latin American and Spanish background), Na-
tive American (referring to the indigenous people of
North America), and White (Caucasian and white Euro-
pean) and other (people from racial-ethnic minority group
who could not be identified in one of these categories).

Outcome
For each comparison between ethnic groups in stigma,
the effect size indicating the difference between groups
was calculated (Hedge’s g). Effect size of 0.8 was
accepted as large, effect size of 0.5 was accepted as mod-
erate and effect size of 0.2 was accepted as small [30].
Effect sizes were calculated by subtracting the means of
stigma between racial minorities and majorities and div-
iding the result by the pooled standard deviation. If
means and standard deviations were not reported, we
used the procedures of
the Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis software (see below) to calculate the effect size
using dichotomous outcomes; and if these were not
available either, we used other statistics (such as t-value
or p-value) to calculate the effect size.

In order to calculate effect sizes we used all the self-
report measures and vignettes examining mental illness
stigma (see Table 1 for the outcome measures) [such as
Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD)
[48], Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI)
[49], Community Attitudes to Mental Illness scale (CAMI)
[33]]. The decision on which outcome measure is captur-
ing which specific stigma perspective and mechanism was
based on the Fox and colleagues` classification [11].

Analyses
To calculate pooled mean effect sizes, we used the com-
puter programme Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version
3.3070; CMA). We expected considerable heterogeneity
among the studies for various reasons. First, our definition
of racial minorities and majorities were too broad and did
not capture specific ethnic minorities and majority groups

within the samples. Second, we pooled the studies
employing different outcome measures (self-report and vi-
gnette). Third, the included studies are investigating dif-
ferent stigma perspectives and mechanisms associated
with them. Fourth, the included studies often investigated
mental illness stigma for various common mental illnesses
(both anxiety and depression spectrums) and lastly, we in-
cluded studies from both High Income and Low and Mid-
dle Income countries which have variations in how mental
illness stigma is defined, measured and experienced. In
the light of these, we employed a random effects pooling
model in all analyses.

As a test of homogeneity of effect sizes, we calculated
the I2 statistic, which is an indicator of heterogeneity in
percentages. A value of 0% indicates no observed hetero-
geneity, and larger values indicate increasing heterogen-
eity, with 25% as low, 50% as moderate and 75% as high
heterogeneity [50]. We calculated 95% confidence inter-
vals around I2 [51] using the non-central chi-squared
based approach within the heterogi module for Stata [52].
We tested publication bias by inspecting the funnel plot
on primary outcome measures and by Duval and Twee-
die’s trim and fill procedure [53] yields an estimated effect
size after publication bias has been taken into account (as
implemented in CMA). We also conducted Egger’s test of
the intercept to quantify the bias captured by the funnel
plot and to test whether it was significant.

We also examined whether specific characteristics of
the studies were related to the effect sizes. We con-
ducted subgroup analyses according to the mixed effects
in which studies within subgroups are pooled
model,
with the random effects model, while the tests for sig-
nificant differences between subgroups are conducted
with the fixed effects model. The priori decided sub-
groups were: ethnicity, type of stigma outcome, type of
stigma perspective and the quality of the studies. Fur-
ther, we used multi-variate meta-regression analyses as
implemented in CMA.

Results
Selection and inclusion of the studies
After examining a total of 2787 abstracts (1806 after re-
moval of duplicates), we retrieved 1806 full text papers

for further consideration. We excluded 1732 of the re-
trieved papers. The PRISMA flowchart describing the in-
clusion process, including the reasons for exclusion, is
presented in Fig. 1. A total of 29 studies were included
in the quantitative synthesis.

Characteristics of the included studies
Selected characteristics of the included studies are pre-
sented in Table 1. Of all the studies included in the analysis,
(N = 18) 62% were conducted in the United States and
(N = 3) 10% were conducted in the United Kingdom. The
rest of the countries were: Singapore (N = 2) 6%; Australia
(N = 2) 6%; Spain (N = 1) 3%; Nigeria (N = 1) 3%; Germany
(N = 1) 3%; Canada (N = 1) 3% and; Korea (N = 1) 3%.

Regarding the participant characteristics, a total of 157,
582 (81%) participants were from the majority racial
groups and a total of 35,836 (19%) were from the minority
racial groups. Minority and majority statuses were defined
based on the country of the included study. Of all the par-
ticipants from the racial majority groups, 96.06% (N = 151,
383) were White, 2.69% (N = 4239) were Asian, 0.06%
(N = 91) were Hispanic and 1.18% (N = 1869) were Black.
Further, of all the participants from the racial minority
groups, 11.30% (N = 4051) were Hispanic, 57.09% (N = 20,
462) were Black, 23.11% (N = 8285) were Asian, 9.31%
(N = 3338) were from other racial background.

With respect to the condition of the CMD, more than
half of the studies (N = 17) investigated various CMDs
and/or not specified the type of CMD in the study,
whereas (N = 12) 41% studies investigated depression.

A considerable number of the studies (48%) recruited
community sample (N = 14), 24% recruited student sam-
ple (N = 7), 14% recruited other sample (e.g. geriatric
population) (N = 4) and 14% recruited participants from
clinical populations (N = 4). Regarding the outcomes,
(N = 7) 24% used a vignette approach to measure stigmas
whereas, (N = 22) 76% used self-report questionnaires.

Risk of bias
The risk of bias can be seen in Table 2. When taking into
account the five different bias items, 20 studies (68%) were
rated as high risk of bias, 6 studies (21%) were rated as mod-
erately high risk of bias and only 3 (10%) studies were rated

Eylem et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:879 

Page 9 of 20

as low risk of bias. The selection bias was rated as low risk
of bias in 10 studies (34%), high risk of bias in 18 studies
(62%), and unclear in 1 study (3%). When taking into ac-
count the study design, there was a high risk of bias in 18
studies (62%) and low risk of bias in 11 studies (38%). Data
collection methods were rated as low risk of bias in 10 stud-
ies (34%), high risk of bias in 16 studies (55%) and unclear
in 3 studies (10%). The risk for confounders was high in 20
studies (68%) and low in 9 studies (31%). As for the data
analyses, the risk of bias was low in 22 studies (76%), high in
1 study (3%) and unclear in 6 studies (21%) (see Table 2).

We assessed whether the authors used stratification and/
or matching in the study design in order to control possible
confounders [54, 55]. Only 4 studies (14%) used stratifica-
tion. Further, the representativeness of the samples was also
limited as only 4 studies (14%) used random sampling,
whereas the rest of the studies used convenience sampling.
In one study, the authors recruited participants from their
friends and networks of their friends which increased the
chances of selection bias and restricted the representative-
ness of the racial groups in their sample [15].

Out of the 21 self-report studies, 7 (33%), and out of
the 8 vignette studies, 3 (37%) used “study constructed”
questionnaires (i.e. questionnaires which are constructed
by the author for the purpose of the study) as outcome
measures. The psychometric properties of these ques-
tionnaires were not tested.

Mental illness stigma for CMDs between racial minorities
and majorities
First, we run the analyses separately for the studies in-
vestigating depression only g = 0.22 (95% CI: 0.10 ~ 0.34)
(I2 = 94, 95% CI: 93 ~ 96) and for the studies investigat-
ing various types of CMDs together g = 0.18 (95% CI:
0.10 ~ 0.28) (I2 = 86, 95% CI: 81 ~ 90). Since this resulted
with small effect sizes and with very high heterogeneity
in each, we decided to pool all the studies together, re-
gardless of the condition of the mental illness studied,
for further sensitivity analyses.

behavioural

discrimination)

Primary outcome was mental illness stigma defined by
the MISF [11]. Cognitive (e.g. stereotype), affective (e.g.
and/or
(e.g.
prejudice),
combination of each of these components of mental illness
stigma were compared between racial minorities and ma-
jorities in 29 studies (39 comparisons). We have decided to
pool the studies together as stigmatizer perspective measur-
ing the cognitive component of the stigma was over repre-
sented, whereas stigmatized perspective measuring how
stigma was anticipated was under represented (see Table
1). The overall effect size was small but significant g = 0.20
(95% CI: 0.12 ~ 0.27) indicating that racial minorities had
more mental illness stigma about CMDs when compared
with the majorities, with very high heterogeneity (I2 = 91,
95% CI: 89 ~ 93). The results of the analyses are reported in

Table 3, and the forest plot is given in Table 4 (see figure 2
in Appendix 3 for the forest plot) .

When studies with high risk of bias (i.e. defined as
those with high risk of bias scores on three and/or more
categories of the risk of bias assessment tool) were ex-
cluded, the effect was sustained g = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.10 ~
0.25) and the heterogeneity was still very high (I2 = 88,
95% CI: 84 ~ 90) (see figure 3 in Appendix 4 for the for-
est plot). When only studies with standardized outcome
measures were included,
the effect size was slightly
greater g = 0.23 (95% CI: 0.10 ~ 0.36) and the heterogen-
eity remained high (I2 = 84, 95% CI: 75 ~ 89) (see figure
4 in Appendix 5 for the forest plot). Next, excluding out-
liers resulted in a comparable effect size g = 0.29 (95%
CI: 0.21 ~ 0.36) and less heterogeneity (I2 = 29, 95% CI: 0
~ 63) (see Table 5 and figure 5 in Appendix 6 for the for-
est plot). To identify outliers, we looked at whether the
95% CI of the study overlaps with the 95% CI of the
pooled effects size and we also looked whether a study
considerably differs from the other included studies in the
metanalysis [57]. Even though the CI of the study by Sub-
ramaniam and colleagues [22] did fall between the CI of
the pooled effect sizes, the study did conceptualise stigma
differently compared to the other studies. Additionally, ex-
cluding that study reduced the heterogeneity significantly
and therefore we decided to exclude it (see Table 3).

Egger’s test did not indicate a significant publication
bias (p = 0.100). Duvall and Tweedie’s trim and fill pro-
cedure indicated 2 missing studies (see the funnel plot
with imputed studies in Appendix 7). The adjusted effect
size (after imputation of the missing studies) was g =
0.27 (95% CI: 0.20 ~ 0.33).

since

analyses

We did not investigate whether there was a variability
in stigma perspectives among racial minorities in the
subgroup and in multi-variate
the
remaining number of studies in some categories (per-
ceived stigma N = 2, stigmatized N = 1) were not suffi-
cient. No significant differences were found in subgroup
analyses (see Table 2). Multi-variate analyses indicated
no significant associations between the effect size and
the racial groups (p = 0.42), quality (p = 0.12) and the
type of the outcome of the studies (self-report, vignette)
(p = 0.48) (see Table 6). However, there was a significant
association between studies with high risk of bias and
the effect size of stigma (p = 0.04).

Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed at
comparing mental illness stigma associated with CMDs
based on racial background. In line with our expecta-
tions, the results suggest that racial minorities have more
mental illness stigma for CMDs when compared with ra-
cial majorities. Sensitivity analyses showed the robust-
ness of these results. The multi-variate meta-regression

analyses indicated that studies of poor quality had higher
effect sizes than the studies with high quality.

Higher mental illness stigma in racial minorities is in
line with the growing literature highlighting the varia-
tions in mental illness stigma based on ethnicity and/or
race [11, 12, 56, 18–23]. This finding could be explained
in relation to the social identity theory [58]. In collectiv-
istic cultures, group harmony and cohesion are of cen-
tral importance [24]. In this context, CMDs might be
seen to fall outside of societal expectations [13, 58, 59]
and this would precipitate shame and subsequent
mental-illness stigma [58, 59]. Thus, what is defined as
“them” not “us”, would reinforce the public opinion that
individuals with CMDs are dangerous and must be seg-
regated [60]. Consistent with this notion, there is re-
search evidence indicating that cultural beliefs of CMDs
are related with the extent of the impact of mental

illness stigma (i.e. fear of someone with CMDs and/or
desire for social distance from an individual with CMDs)
at individual and societal levels [24, 60–63].

In extent, the consequences of mental illness stigma are
more harmful especially when the preceding cultural and/
or personal attributions coincide with social adversities
such as migration, poverty, gender, diagnosis of a CMD,
ethnic and/or sexual minority statuses [7–9, 63, 64]. This
impact of
phenomenon is known as the intersectional
stigma and it accounts for the underutilisation of mental
health services among those who are affected [10, 63–67].
For instance, a large scale study from America (N = 15,
383) showed that, Black women with low socio-economic
background reported more stigma related concerns and
were less likely to utilise mental health services compared
to locally born women from White backgrounds [8].
Furthermore, the negative impact of the intersection of

Eylem et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:879 

Page 11 of 20

different types of stigma on utilisation of health services is
well-documented in the HIV literature investigating (HIV-
related stigma, sexism, racism, and homo/transphobia) on
individuals` well-being [65–67].

Studies comparing public beliefs and attitudes regarding
CMDs point to the importance of migration status and/or
ethnicity in shaping mental illness stigma [23]. For in-
in a large scale vignette study (N = 2013) by
stance,
Makowski and colleagues in Germany, there was an indi-
cation for the differences in mental illness stigma between
locally born minorities, migrants and non-minorities [23].
from a
When the vignette concerned an individual
migrant background with depression, participants from
migrant background expressed greater stigmatizing atti-
tudes (e.g. negative stereotypes, emotional reactions and
desire for social distance) compared to the locally born
minorities and majorities [23].

Strengths and limitations
This study has various innovations. This is the first meta-
analysis in the stigma field utilizing a unified conceptual
framework to pool the studies. This is an important step
to advance the current understanding of the mental illness
stigma and how racial/ethnic differences impact people’s
experiences of mental illness stigma.

Based on the current results an important message for
the public health field is to tailor the existing anti-stigma in-
terventions according to the specific racial and/or ethnic
groups [25]. At present, recommended practices include
psycho-educational campaigns aiming to improve the

public knowledge on CMDs and individuals with CMDs
[25, 68]. Such practices however, fail to demonstrate
changes in attitudes among stigmatized and stigmatizer
[69]. Often, educational campaigns do not provide evi-
dence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma campaigns in
increasing help-seeking for CMDs [69]. Our results
suggest that the development and the implementation
of such campaigns can be improved if the messages of
these campaigns are adapted according to the socio-
cultural and political contexts of the countries that the
individuals live in [69, 70].

Even though our results suggest that all racial minorities,
regardless, have higher mental illness stigma, various limita-
tions need to be taken into account whilst interpreting our
findings. We found no variability in mental illness stigma
based on specific races. This could be explained with the
small number of studies representing each racial minority
group in sub-group analyses. Further, we were also unable
to investigate if there were differences in mental illness
stigma between racial minorities based on the migration
status since this was rarely investigated in the included
studies [8, 23]. It may be that there are other potential
moderators such as the degree of acculturation which are
overlooked in the current stigma literature and could not
be taken into consideration in our study.

Further, the multi-variate analyses pointed to the possible
moderating role of the number of studies with high risk of
bias on the effect size of stigma. It could be that if there
were more studies with low risk of bias, we might have
found no racial differences in stigma for CMDs. Given

these reasons, the results of this study must be treated with
caution.

The studies from North America were overrepresented
in the current study. This limits our understanding of how

contextual differences between continents influence the
impact of mental illness stigma. For instance, the experi-
ences of discrimination related with stigma might be dif-
ferent in Europe compared to America [23].

Related issues were the racial classification and the
definition of minority and/or majority statuses in this
study. Since there were many ethnic and religious
groups in the included studies, we decided that the mu-
tually exclusive category approach [28], re-allocating in-
dividuals in existing categories defined by the previous
research [29], would be the most suitable. We have also
defined minority and majority statuses based on the
country of the included studies. Since the definition of
language and
race-ethnicity includes history, religion,
socio-political dynamics [28, 70], we oversimplified the
term by using broad racial categories. Moreover, our
definitions do not capture the changes in ethnicity and
minority statuses over time depending on the changing

socio-political circumstances [28]. An alternative to the
preceding is the multiple characteristics approach [28]
taking into account the various aspects of ethnicity such
as language, country of birth, nationality and religiosity
[28]. Even though the latter offers more effective ap-
proach to the measurement of ethnicity in detail, the
former is more pragmatic and facilitates the comparabil-
ity of the studies across countries [28]. In the light of
these caveats, our results are restricted with the broad
racial categories which are defined at a specific point in
time. It is recommended that ethnicity and minority sta-
tuses are measured at different time points in prospect-
ive studies [28].

Another limitation restricting the representativeness
of the sample in our study was the exclusion of clinical
populations that had comorbidities. One reason could
be that we have excluded HIV, and other comorbidities
and yet most clinical studies include people who often
have CMDs and other conditions. Some studies indi-
cate that diagnosis of a CMD would reinforce the label
indicating that the individual falls out of the societal ex-
pectations and therefore is unpredictable and/or dan-
gerous [8, 46, 71]. Alternatively, diagnosis of a CMD
might create opportunities for more psycho-education
about CMDs, and more contact with the others with
CMDs and this might reduce the mental illness stigma
in return [71]. Since clinical populations are not repre-
sented in our study, we were not able to assess if there
was a variation in mental illness stigma among racial
minorities depending on the presence of a formal diag-
nosis. Thus, the following questions are important and
yet they remain to be answered by the future studies:
Among those who have received a diagnosis of a CMD,
are there any differences in the experience of mental ill-
ness stigma between ethnic minorities and majorities?

Eylem et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:879 

Page 14 of 20

Among ethnic minorities, are there differences in men-
tal illness stigma between those who have been diag-
nosed with CMDs and those who have not?

Further, some types of mental-illness stigma are under in-
vestigated. There is an indication that stigma is associated
with greater burden when it is accepted and internalized by
those who have a mental illness [11]. In our meta-analysis,
many studies investigated stereotypes or prejudices attrib-
uted to those who have a mental illness. Conversely, how
stigma was anticipated or experienced by ethnic minorities
when compared with majorities were rarely investigated
[20, 21]. Given this limitation, we could not investigate
whether there was a variation in different perspectives (e.g.
anticipated, internalised) and/or components (e.g. cognitive,
affective, behavioural) of mental illness stigma between ra-
cial minorities.

It is worth to emphasize that there were considerable
number of the questionnaires which were developed for
the purpose of the studies by the authors themselves. In
our sensitivity analyses, exclusion of these questionnaires
and limiting the analyses with the validated questionnaires
such as CAMI, reduced the heterogeneity. The revision of
the existing self-report questionnaires by the authors was
another limitation. Often, these questionnaires were re-
vised according to the research question and/or the
sample and their psychometric properties were not tested.
Additionally, the self-report questionnaires often mea-
sured multiple stigma mechanisms within the same scale
[11]. This might conflate the results as stigma mechanisms
might differently relate to the outcomes.

Poor quality of the vignette studies also worth mentioning.
The vignettes were developed based on the DSM criteria
and the authors` clinical information of the CMDs. Often,
there was no information about the psychometric properties
of the vignettes with one exception. Subramaniam and col-
leagues followed a systematic approach by revising the vi-
gnettes with clinical experts, piloting them with participants
and revising the relevance and acceptability afterwards [23].
Since the vignettes are often developed by the researchers
themselves, it could be that they are more suggestive when
compared with self-report measures and this would con-
found the results (see Appendix 2).

Our results are also limited with the MISF as other
frameworks exist such as the Framework Integrating Nor-
mative Influences on Stigma (FINIS) [72]. We have chosen
the MISF as to our knowledge, it identifies specific out-
come measures capturing specific stigma mechanism [11].

Conclusions
The limitations of our study underscore the importance of
investigating the intersection of race/ethnicity, degree of ac-
culturation, presence of a mental illness diagnosis and the
impact of mental health stigma. There is a need for more
high quality research for the advancement of the stigma

field. The quality of the future studies could be improved
by defining meaningful controls. For instance, researchers
could relate sample characteristics to the general popula-
tion of the country of the study. Additionally, the racial and
or ethnic groups of the country of the studies should be
represented. In line with the multiple characteristics ap-
proach to define ethnicity, future studies could define the
ethnic composition of their sample consistently based on
the characteristics such as history and religion which are
outlined earlier. Furthermore, more prospective studies are
needed to capture the changes in ethnic classification over
to examine
time. Prospective studies are also crucial
whether the degree of acculturation, diagnosis of a CMD
and/or minority statuses are effect modifiers in the relation-
ship between ethnicity and mental illness stigma.

To conclude, mental illness stigma is one of the import-
ant myriad of factors that might underpin individuals`
state of physical, psychological, and social wellbeing. The
results of the current meta-analysis indicate differences in
mental illness stigma based on racial background and this
result highlights the important role of racial and/ethnic
background in shaping the mental illness stigma. An im-
portant clinical implication of these findings would be to
tailor anti-stigma strategies according to the specific racial
and/or ethnic backgrounds with the intention to improve
mental health outreach [25].

Vignette and Manipulation
to
J.S. was a typical man who enjoyed going out
dinner after work with his coworkers, and playing
sports on the weekend with his friends. Recently, he
started feeling very down and unhappy. After he
found it very hard to get out of bed, get dressed, go
to work, or do anything for several weeks, he decided
to go see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist asked him
about his symptoms, which included not getting any
pleasure out of things he normally would and having

trouble sleeping and eating. At times, he would also
feel completely worthless and even had thoughts
about killing himself.
Genetic condition:
Because of J.S.’s symptoms, the psychiatrist diagnosed
him with depression and recommended that he enroll in
treatment. Many experts and doctors also tested to see
what had caused J.S.'s problem. After many assessments,
the doctors found no imbalance of brain chemicals, and no
significant childhood or recent events that could have
contributed to the onset of depression. But experts in
