Abstract

Background: Repeated self-harm represents the single strongest risk factor for suicide. To date no study with
full national coverage has examined the pattern of hospital repeated presentations due to self-harm among
young people.
Methods: Data on consecutive self-harm presentations were obtained from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland.
Socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics of individuals aged 10–29 years who presented with self-harm
to emergency departments in Ireland (2007–2014) were analysed. Risk of long-term repetition was assessed using
survival analysis and time differences between the order of presentations using generalised estimating
equation analysis.
Results: The total sample comprised 28,700 individuals involving 42,642 presentations. Intentional drug
overdose was the most prevalent method (57.9%). Repetition of self-harm occurred in 19.2% of individuals
during the first year following a first presentation, of whom the majority (62.7%) engaged in one repeated
act. Overall, the risk of repeated self-harm was similar between males and females. However, in the 20–24-
year-old age group males were at higher risk than females. Those who used self-cutting were at higher risk
for repetition than those who used intentional drug overdose, particularly among females. Age was associated
with repetition only among females, in particular adolescents (15–19 years old) were at higher risk than
young emerging adults (20–24 years old). Repeated self-harm risk increased significantly with the number of
previous self-harm episodes.
Time differences between first self-harm presentations were detected. Time between second and third
presentation increased compared to time between first and second presentation among low frequency
repeaters (patients with 3 presentations only within 1 year following a first presentation). The same time
period decreased among high frequency repeaters (patients with at least 4 to more than 30 presentations).
Conclusion: Young people with the highest risk for repeated self-harm were 15–19-year-old females and
20–24-year-old males. Self-cutting was the method associated with the highest risk of self-harm repetition.
Time between first self-harm presentations represents an indicator of subsequent repetition. To prevent risk
of repeated self-harm in young people, all individuals presenting at emergency departments due to self-harm
should be provided with a risk assessment including psychosocial characteristics, history of self-harm and time
between first presentations.

Background
Self-harm is relatively common among young people
with prevalence rates in adolescent samples which range
from 6.9 to 15.9% [1–4]. One review of the literature
showed that 13.2% of adolescents reported engaging in
self-harm at some stage in their lives, with 11.2% who
reported engaging in self-harm in the last 6 months [5].
Self-harm is ‘an act with non-fatal outcome in which
an individual deliberately initiates a non-habitual behav-
iour, that without intervention from others will cause
self-harm, or deliberately ingests a substance in excess of
the prescribed or generally recognised therapeutic dos-
age, and which is aimed at realising changes that the
person desires via the actual or expected physical conse-
quences’ [6]. This definition was developed by WHO/
Euro Multicentre Study Working Group and associated
with the term ‘parasuicide’ (superseded by the term
‘deliberate self-harm’, and this latter by ‘self-harm’), and
includes acts involving varying levels of suicidal intent
by adopting the principle that suicidal intent is on a con-
tinuum and not an all-or-nothing phenomenon [7, 8].

Research has shown that risk of suicide is associated
with self-harm [9], in particular with repeated self-harm
[10, 11]. A previous study showed that among 10–24-
year-old males, the risk of suicide within 1 year following
a single self-harm episode was 2.1%, whereas among
those with repeated self-harm the risk was 4.1% [11].
Among females, a greater difference was identified, the
risk of suicide for those with a single self-harm episode
was 0.3% whereas among those with repeated self-harm
it was 1.9% [11]. History of self-harm is not associated
only with suicide but also with future repeated self-harm
[12]. In addition to history of self-harm, other factors are
also associated with increased risk of repetition in young
people including alcohol and drug misuse, depression
[12], psychiatric treatment [13], behavioural problems, dis-
turbed family relationships, alcohol dependence in the
family, social isolation, and a poor school record [12].
Repetition among young people is also associated with
older age and self-cutting as method of self-harm [13].

Research investigating hospital presentations due to
self-harm revealed that self-harm repetition occurred in
27.3% of people aged 10–18 years who had previously
presented to emergency departments with self-harm
[13]. Moreover, a repeat self-harm episode is most likely
to occur in the first months following a hospital presen-
tation [14–16].

There have been few studies on self-harm repetition in
young people including a large sample and more than
one centre [13]. To our knowledge, there are no studies
focusing on young people with full national coverage.
No studies have analysed time between first hospital
presentations in young people and its association with
subsequent self-harm.

This study has been conducted to investigate the pat-
tern of self-harm presentations and repetition, in order
to better understand self-harm in young people. The
overall objective was to identify risk factors for long-
term repetition of self-harm among children, adolescents
and young adults who have presented to hospital emer-
gency departments in Ireland with self-harm. Specific-
ally, we aimed to identify age group similarities and
differences in risk of self-harm repetition, with the focus
on frequency of repetition and time between self-harm
presentations. We also aimed to examine potential risk
factors for repeated self-harm, such as gender, age,
frequency of repetition, involvement in substance use,
previous self-harm and recommended next care. We
hypothesised these factors to be significantly associated
with self-harm repetition according to the findings of a
previous study analysing all age groups [17]. Addition-
ally, we conducted a number of exploratory analysis with
the aim to identify possible age-group and gender differ-
ences in the association between self-harm repetition
and individual variables (e.g. age-group differences in the
association between recommended next care following a
self-harm presentation and self-harm repetition).

We conducted this study with the aim of gaining a
greater understanding of risk of repeated self-harm, which
is needed to inform health care services dealing with
youth self-harm at hospital emergency departments.

Methods
Setting and sample
Data for this study were drawn from the National Self-
Harm Registry Ireland. Data were extracted for consecu-
tive patients aged 10 to 29 years who attended any of
the emergency departments (ED) in the Republic of
Ireland (estimated population: 4,593,300 in 2013) in con-
sequence of non-fatal self-harm between 1st January
2007 and 31st December 2014. In total, self-harm data
were collected for all 35 acute hospitals in Ireland. A
small number of hospital emergency departments were
re-designed (Model 2 status hospitals, HSE’s Securing
the Future of Smaller Hospitals framework) [18]. The
analyses included data from 1st January 2007 as full
coverage of EDs of Ireland was obtained from that time
onwards. A new and more precise procedure to identify
self-harm cases was also adopted in 2007. The end of
the study period was 31st December 2014.

The definition of self-harm from the WHO/Euro Mul-
ticentre Study Working Group was used in this study
[6]. All methods of self-harm are included such as
intentional drug overdoses, alcohol overdoses or lacera-
tions. Episodes involving acts without the intention to
self-harm were excluded (e.g. one individual who is ill
and takes additional medication without any intention to
deliberately harm her/himself ).

The four age group categories used were defined as
follows: Children (CH) were referred to as those be-
tween 10 and 14 years, adolescents (AD) to those be-
tween 15 and 19 years, younger emerging adults (YEA)
to those between 20 and 24 years, and older emerging
adults (OEA) to those between 25 and 29 years.

For the purpose of statistical analysis, those individuals
who had more than one presentation were categorised
in two groups. Low frequency repeaters were referred to
as those with three presentations, and high frequency
repeaters to those with at least four presentations, within
12 months following a first presentation. A similar cat-
egorisation (frequent and infrequent repeaters) was used
by C Haw, et al. [19].

Method of self-harm was recorded according the
Tenth Revision of the WHO’s International Classifica-
tion of Diseases codes for intentional injury [20]. The
main methods were grouped as follows: overdose of
drugs and medications (X60-X64), self-poisonings by al-
cohol (X65), poisonings which involve the ingestion of
chemicals, noxious substances, gases and vapours (X66-
X69), hanging (X70), drowning (X71), and self-harm by
sharp object (X78). Some individuals have used more
than one method at one time. In this study, methods
were categorised as follows: drug overdose (only), self-
cutting (only), drug overdose and self-cutting, attempted
hanging, attempted drowning, other methods (which in-
cludes either methods other than those listed above or a
non-common combination of methods).

Self-harm repetition was defined as a presentation at a
hospital emergency department due to a self-harm act
following a previous self-harm presentation.

A previous study showed that the patterns of self-
harm repetition of males and females presenting at
in the sur-
EDs in Ireland differed [17]. Therefore,
vival analyses examining the risk of repetition,
fe-
male and male patients’ presentations were analysed
separately.

Data collection
Data were entered into a computerised system by the
Registry’s data registration officers. In each one of the
four HSE regions (Dublin/Midlands, Dublin/North East,
South, West region) a team of people collect the data
that form the national dataset. A self-harm act was re-
corded dependent on the standardised application of the
case-definition. High levels of agreement were found be-
tween the data registration officers in term of case ascer-
tainment [17].

Encrypted patient initials, date of birth and gender
were the data items used to distinguish between pa-
tients and to identify repeat presentations by the
same patients.

Statistical analyses
The following variables were included in the analyses:
age, gender, method of self-harm, date of presenta-
tion, alcohol use (detected when presenting in ED),
recommended next care following treatment
in the
hospital ED.

Univariate analyses examining associations between
the total number of presentations by person and
socio-demographic and method characteristics were
conducted using chi-squared tests.

Associations between repetition of self-harm and
self-harm,
socio-demographic, history of previous
method characteristics and recommended next care
were examined using survival analysis. In the first
step, a model was built for each of the variables. In the
second step, all the variables with a p-value <0.10
(value present either in the male or female model)
were included in a subsequent multivariate model.
The survival analysis method used was the Cox pro-
portional hazard model, in particular the conditional
risk set model. The assumption of this model, pro-
posed by Prentice, Williams and Peterson, is that an
individual is not at risk of a second event until the
first event has occurred and so forth. Additionally, ac-
cording to these methods after the occurrence of a
first failure, an individual still remains at risk of a sec-
ond and subsequent failures [21–23]. Time to the next
self-harm presentation was measured for the second
or subsequent presentation. The analysis was stratified
by failure order. Socio-demographic and self-harm
method characteristics examined were age, gender,
alcohol
involvement, and, where applicable previous
self-harm. A variable “status” was generated and in-
cluded observations to next presentation, ending in an
event (coded as status = 1) and observations to the end
of 1-year follow-up, ending as censored (status = 0).
Censored cases were all non-repeaters’ presentations
and the last presentation of repeaters (to the end of
the follow up). To be certain of accounting for the
first presentation, people whose first presentation oc-
curred in 2010 and onwards only were included.
Follow-up was 1 year following the individual’s index
presentation made between 2010 and 2013. A similar
method was applied by Perry et al. [17].

Finally, we included in the survival analyses the first
six presentations by subject. This cut-off was used as
most of individuals who repeated had no more than six
presentations, and this approach is consistent with previ-
ous studies [17, 24, 25]. The order of presentation as
stratification was not included in the analysis, as it
would not have allowed the performance of the whole
analysis. In order to conduct the analysis including all
the variables, we decided to exclude it, as this did not
change the overall picture and in general the results.

Lastly, performing a generalised estimating equation
model, time differences between first order presentations
were analysed, adopting the same inclusion criteria used
for survival analyses. For this analysis, those who repeated
self-harm were categorised into two groups, based on the
frequency of their repetition as low frequency repeaters, and
high frequency repeaters (the definition of these categories
was outlined in section Setting and sample). In particular,
we compared the time between a 1st and 2nd presentation,
to that between 2nd and 3rd presentation.

For the analysis STATA version 12.0 for Windows [26]
and IBM SPSS version 22.0 for Windows [27] were used.

Results
The total sample comprised 28,700 individuals aged 10–
29 years. During the study period, these 28,700 individ-
uals were involved in 42,642 self-harm episodes resulting
in presentation to any of the 35 emergency departments
(EDs) in Ireland. Overall, there were more females (N =
15,560, 54.2%) than males (N = 13,140, 45.8%; χ2 = 27.6,
p = <0.001; Table 1). At first presentation, there were
1726 (6.0%) children (CH), 9911 (34.5%) adolescents
(AD), 9510 (33.1%) younger emerging adults (YEA) and
7553 (26.3%) older emerging adults (OEA). Comparing
all of the age groups according to the number of presen-
tations, a similar proportion of those who presented 1–3
times were AD (33.7%) and YEA (33.3%). The highest
proportion of those who presented 4 or more times
were YEA (38.4%; χ2 = 559.99, p = <0.001). The majority
of these episodes involved drug overdose, with self-
cutting the second most common method (Table 2).

Self-harm repetition
Those individuals whose first presentation occurred dur-
ing 2010–2013 (N = 13,736; 46.3% males and 53.7% fe-
males) were followed up for 1 year until 2013. Repetition
occurred in 19.2% (N = 2630) of these individuals. The
majority of individuals who repeated had one repetition
only (62.7%, N = 1650). A number of those who repeated
had two (19.3%, N = 508) or three repetitions (7.3%, N =
193). Moreover, 10.6% of all individuals who repeated
had at least four repetitions. Finally, 4.5% (N = 118)
had more than 6 repetitions with a wide variation in
the number of episodes.

Table 1 Total number of self-harm presentations by gender

The proportion of females and males who repeated at
least once was 52.6 and 47.4% respectively. By age group,
the proportion of individuals repeating among CH, AD,
YEA, and OEA was 24.1, 20.9, 18.6 and 16.3%
respectively.

Cox hazard survival analysis: univariate analyses
Age, gender, method used, previous self-harm episodes,
and recommended next care were examined separately
using cox proportional hazard survival analysis (Table 3).

Self-harm method
Among males, those using drug overdose (only) were at
lower risk of repetition compared to those using self-
cutting (only), overdose and self-cutting, and other
methods (a rare method or combination of methods).
Among females, those who used drug overdose (only)
were at lower risk than those who used self-cutting
(alone or combined with drug overdose), attempted
hanging, attempted drowning, and other methods.

The risk of repeated self-harm among those who used
self-cutting, self-cutting and overdose, attempting hang-
ing or drowning, and other methods, compared to drug
overdose (only) was higher among females, but not
among males.

History of self-harm
History of self-harm represents a risk factor for repeated
self-harm, with the risk increasing with the number of
previous episodes. This association was stronger among
females compared to males (Table 3).

Recommended next care
Comparing males of all age groups on next care follow-
ing a self-harm episode revealed that the risk of repeated
self-harm was similar regardless of what the recom-
mended next care was (Table 3). However, according to
some exploratory analyses, among young male emerging
adults, those who had left without being seen were at
higher risk of repetition than those who were admitted
to general ward (HR = 0.36; CI (95%) = 0.16–0.81; p =
0.01) and those who were not admitted (HR = 0.42; CI
(95%) = 0.22–0.81; p = 0.01).

were at lower risk of repeated self-harm within 1 year
(following the index presentation) compared to those
who were admitted to psychiatric ward, had left before
admission, and were not admitted (Table 3). This pattern
was particularly strong among older female emerging
adults; those who were admitted to general ward were at
lower risk of repetition within 1 year (following the
index presentation) compared to those who were admit-
ted to psychiatric ward (HR = 3.31; CI (95%) = 1.20–9.16;
p = 0.02), had left before admission (HR = 3.58; CI (95%)
= 1.48–8.64; p = 0.005), and were not admitted (HR =
2.11; CI (95%) = 1.05–4.26; p = <0.04).

Alcohol involvement
Overall, among females the risk for self-harm repetition
was lower among those who had taken alcohol com-
pared to those who had not (Table 3). This pattern was
observed only among young female emerging adults
(HR = 0.81; CI (95%) = 0.66–0.99; p = 0.04).

Cox hazard survival analysis: multivariate analysis
The multivariate analysis (Table 4) identified age as a
risk factor for repetition only among females, in particu-
lar AD were at higher risk than YEA. Additionally, those
individuals using self-cutting (alone or combined with
drug overdose) were at higher risk than those using drug
overdose (alone) among females. Self-harm methods and
repetition were marginally associated among males
(Table 4). Previous self-harm was a risk factor for re-
peated self-harm, particularly among women. Risk of
repetition was higher among those females who did not
use alcohol.

Overall, risk of repetition was similar regardless of the
recommended next care. Additional exploratory multi-
variate analyses revealed that young male emerging

adults who were admitted to general ward were at lower
risk for repetition compared to those who had left with-
out being seen (HR: 2.32; CI (95%) = 1.03–5.24; p =
0.004). Moreover, older female emerging adults admitted
to general ward were at lower risk for repetition com-
pared to those who refused to be admitted (HR = 2.89;
(95%) = 1.00–8.32; p = <0.001), had left before
CI
admission (HR = 4.83; CI (95%) = 2.07–11.27; p = <0.001),
were not admitted (HR = 2.3; CI (95%) = 1.19–4.44; p
= 0.01).

The results of Kaplan-Meier analyses are shown in
Figs. 1a, b and 2a, b. Among all age groups risk of repeti-
tion was higher during the first months after the initial
presentation (Fig. 1a and b). The proportions of those
male patients who did not repeat within 3 months after a
first episode were as follows: 92.0% in CH, 87.0% in AD,
84.0% in YEA, and 84.0% in OEA, respectively. Those
male patients who did not repeat within 12 months after a
first episode were as follows: 84.0% in CH, 77.5% in AD,
74.0% in YEA, and 73.5% in OEA. The proportions of
those female patients who did not repeat within 3 months
after a first episode were as follows: 90.0% in CH, 87.0% in
AD, 83.0% in YEA, and 81.5% in OEA, respectively. Those
female patients who did not repeat within 12 months after
a first episode were as follows: 79.0% in CH, 78.0% in AD,
73.0% in YEA, and 71.5% in OEA, respectively.

The risk of repetition within 12 months after a first
episode for those who presented due to self-cutting
alone or combined with drug overdose was higher than
that for individuals presenting due to other methods
(Fig. 2a and b). According to the self-harm method used,
the proportion of patients who did not repeat within 12
months after a first episode was as follows: in males,
68.0% for self-cutting combined with drug overdose; 72.0%
for self-cutting (only); 77.0% for drug overdose (only); 79.0%

66.0% for self-cutting combined with drug overdose; 72.0%
for attempted hanging (only), 72.5% for attempted drowning
(only), and 80.0% for drug overdose (only).

The risk of repetition increased with the number of
previous self-harm episodes both in males and females.
The proportions of male and female patients who did
not repeat a self-harm act according to their self-harm
history were similar within 1 year after a first presenta-
tion. Overall, the proportions of those patients who did
not repeat within 12 months after a first episode was
86.0, 68.0, 54.5, 45.0, 35.0, and 37.0% for those with no,

Discussion
This study investigated socio-demographic and self-harm
characteristics of young individuals presenting to hospital
emergency departments in Ireland due to self-harm. We
have identified age similarities and differences in repetition

of self-harm, focusing on frequency of repetitions and time
between self-harm presentations. Our findings also high-
light associations between repeated self-harm and socio-
demographic and method characteristics and elucidate the
relationship between recommended next care and repeti-
tion of self-harm across four age groups. We found that,
among females, 15–19-year-old were at higher risk for
repetition than 20–24-year-olds. Among females, those
who used self-cutting were at higher risk for repetition than
those who used intentional drug overdose. Overall, re-
peated self-harm risk increased significantly with the num-
ber of previous self-harm episodes. Time between second
and third presentation increased compared to time between
first and second presentation among low frequency re-
peaters, whereas the same time period decreased among
high frequency repeaters.

We have investigated the relationship between socio-
demographic and self-harm act characteristics and risk
for repeated self-harm. Overall, age was not associated
with repetition. However, among female patients, those
aged 15–19 years old were at higher risk for repeated
self-harm compared to those aged 20–24 years old. IJ
Perry, et al. [17] reported that in females of all ages the
peak rates of self-harm was in 15–19-year-old age group.
Overall, the risk for repetition for males and females was
similar. However, among 20–24-year-old individuals, males
more often presented to ED due to self-harm than females.
A recent
systematic review [28], which investigated
hospital-based repeated self-harm, did not include gender
among risk factors for repetition. Even though gender did
not represent a risk factor for repetition in all age groups,

our findings reveal that younger emerging adult males were
at higher risk for repetition than females.

With regards to self-harm method used, female pa-
tients using self-cutting, only or combined with drug
overdose, were at higher risk for subsequent self-harm
compared to those using drug overdose only. This con-
firmed the findings of a study of Lilley et al. [29] which
investigated self-harm presentations at ED in individ-
uals of all age groups. The findings of Lilley showed
that 47% of those who had used self-cutting presented
again to EDs due to a self-harm act, compared to 31%
of those who had used self-poisoning.

We found that risk of repetition increased with the
number of previous self-harm episodes, this is in keeping
with findings from previous studies investigating self-

harm in young people [13] and individuals of all age
groups [17].

Results from the present study suggest that repeated
self-harm is associated with recommended next care
only among some subgroups of patients. In particular,
20–24-year-old males admitted to general ward were at
lower risk for repetition than those who left without be-
ing seen, and 25–29-year-old females admitted to gen-
eral ward were at lower risk for repetition than those
who were not admitted, were refused to be admitted and
left before admission. Receiving after care following a
self-harm episode is needed for every single patient pre-
senting to ED. This is even more urgent among 20–24-
year-old as they represent the subgroup with the highest
rates among males [17]. It is relevant for every patient to
receive an appropriate assessment as non-assessed
patients are at greater risk of further self-harm and com-
pleted suicide than those who are assessed [30].

Observing subgroups of patients classified by total
number of presentations by individual within 1 year
following a first presentation revealed relevant find-
ings. The proportion of
females was overall higher
than males, which confirmed the outcomes of studies
in which Irish [31] and international samples [5] were
analysed.

In addition to this, from some exploratory analyses,
we found that the proportion of those using self-cutting
compared to other methods was approximately 80%
higher among those who had multiple episodes com-
pared to those who had only one episode (17.9% of total
number of presentations among those who presented
once accounted for self-cutting, whereas 31.1% among
those who presented seven or more times accounted for
the same method). Conversely,
the proportion of
presentations by all other methods decreased among in-
dividuals with increasing number of presentations. This
outcome confirmed the findings of K Hawton, et al. [13]
who investigated self-harm among 10–18 year-old indi-
viduals and showed that self-cutting is a self-harm
method associated with higher risk of repeated self-harm
and suicide compared to self-poisoning.

To better identify people at higher risk for repetition,
it was also relevant to examine the time between presen-
tations at ED. This study found that time between sec-
ond and third presentation was 42 days longer than time
between first and second presentation among those pa-
tients who subsequently had a low number of repeti-
tions, whereas this period was 47 days shorter among
those who subsequently had a higher number of repeti-
tions. The length of time between first presentations was
shorter over time for those who subsequently presented
to ED many times, and conversely longer for those who
subsequently presented three times only. This pattern
was confirmed in a number of subgroups of patients,

that is both in adolescent and older emerging adult high
frequency repeaters (from 3 to over 30 repetitions), and
younger emerging adult low frequency repeaters (2 repe-
titions). The same pattern was found among female low
frequency repeaters and male high frequency repeaters.
Moreover, a similar pattern was also found among those
who used drugs (overdose or other methods, both in
LFR and HFR). Remarkably, among those who used self-
cutting these time differences were even more marked
compared to the general patient population. In fact,
among low frequency repeaters using self-cutting the
time difference between second and third presentation
was 62 days longer than time between first and second
presentation. Among adolescent low frequency repeater
females who used self-cutting this pattern is highly
marked, in fact the time difference between second and
third presentation was 138 days longer than time be-
tween first and second presentation, whereas it was
42 days in the whole population.

A number of findings of this research confirm previ-
ous studies, others provide new information on at-risk
individuals. Our results highlighted that self-harm repe-
tition was more likely to occur among the given sub-
groups of patients, that is younger emerging adult males,
adolescent females, females using self-cutting, and those
individuals with previous self-harm presentations.

Conducting the survival and the generalised estimated
equation analysis was necessary to identify at-risk groups
for self-harm repetition within 1 year following a first
presentation. Survival analysis methods were used in
previous similar studies [11, 13, 17, 24, 29], while esti-
mated equation methods to assess first presentations
time differences have innovatively employed in the
current study.

Strengths and limitations
The results of this study are robust as a large number of
self-harm cases were analysed. Moreover, this study ob-
served self-harm hospital presentations for a long time
period. This represents a strength as not many studies
to our knowledge investigating self-harm among young
people have employed longitudinal data.

EM McMahon, et al. [31] showed that a large number
of self-harm episodes are hidden, that is they do not
come to the attention of health services. This study ex-
amined self-harm episodes involving presentation to ED
only, not considering other cases. This may represent a
limitation. However, the main objective of this research
was to assess the specific patient population presenting
to EDs due to self-harm, in order to inform ED services.
This study did not include possible suicide or other
type of death following self-harm presentations which
may have occurred during the follow-up period. How-
ever, as suicide is a rare event in young people in

Bennardi et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:421 

Page 11 of 12

Ireland, particularly in adolescents [31], this has not af-
fected the overall outcome of this study. The study could
not take account of patients who presented to a hospital
ED outside the Republic of Ireland. People who repeated
and presented to a hospital ED other than an Irish hos-
pital were not assessed. This may thus have slightly
underestimated the rate of repetition.

The first presentation of

the participants in the
study period might not necessarily have been their
first ever presentation at ED due to self-harm. How-
ever, in the survival analysis we excluded all of those
patients who had presented between 1st January 2007
and 31st December 2009. It was thus unlikely they
repeated after 3 or more years following a previous
presentation. This is in accordance with current sci-
entific literature which indicates that repeated self-
harm in young people is most common in the first
months following a presentation to ED [32].

Conclusion
A number of subgroups of young patients presenting to
hospital due to self-harm were at elevated risk of repeat-
ing a self-harm act within 1 year. Every person present-
ing at ED should receive a risk assessment to reduce the
likelihood that such person represents over and over
again with the same problem. Appropriate aftercare fol-
lowing a presentation due to self-harm should be put in
place for everyone, irrespective of age. A health care pro-
fessional should not underestimate the risk for a non-
fatal or fatal suicidal act in young people. A common
wrong belief might be that young people self-harm only
temporarily and due to superficial reasons, such as a
passing trend, or that improvements in young people are
unlikely to occur due to ongoing physical and psycho-
logical development. These and other similar beliefs may
hurt an individual in urgent need of help. Every health
care provider dealing with self-harm and young people
should go beyond these myths and be aware of the exist-
ence of non-suicidal self-injury disorder [33] and associ-
ated risks in order to best address the affected person’s
needs. The findings of this study might help to inform a
health care provider when conducting a risk assessment
and planning next care. In particular, these findings
might help to identify those individuals who are at
higher risk for repeated self-harm. Additionally, the out-
comes of this study highlight the importance of taking
into account psychosocial characteristics, history of self-
harm and the time between first presentations during
risk assessment, as these represent indicators of risk of
subsequent self-harm.
