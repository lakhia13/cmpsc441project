There is a large consensus indicating that childhood trauma is significantly involved in the development of depression. The aim
of this study was to examine the prevalence of retrospectively recalled childhood trauma in chronically depressed patients and
to investigate a more specific relationship between trauma type and depression. We further asked for the influence of multiple
experiences of childhood trauma on the vulnerability to a chronic course of depression in adulthood. 349 chronically depressed
patients of the German LAC Depression Study completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, a self-report measure of traumatic
experiences in childhood. 75.6% of the chronically depressed patients reported clinically significant histories of childhood trauma.
37% of the chronically depressed patients reported multiple childhood traumatization. Experiences of multiple trauma also led to
significantly more severe depressive symptoms. Stepwise multiple regression analysis suggested that childhood emotional abuse
and sexual abuse were significantly associated with a higher symptom severity in chronically depressed adults. Yet, expanding the
regression model for multiple exposures showed that multiplicity was the only remaining significant predictor for symptom severity
in chronically depressed patients. Clinical implications suggest a precise assessment of childhood trauma in chronically depressed
patients with a focus on emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and multiple exposures to childhood trauma. This trial is registered with
registration number ISRCTN91956346.

1. Introduction

Among the leading causes of the global burden of disease
depression currently ranks third place worldwide and first
place in middle- and high-income countries [1, p. 43].
Wittchen et al. [2] even reported depression to be “by far
the most burdensome disorder of all diseases in the EU”
(p. 669). It is predicted that by 2020 depression will have
jumped to second place [3]. Depression has a high risk of
recidivism: 50% after the first, 70% after the second, and
90% after the third episode [4]; 50% of patients relapse after
any form of short-term psychotherapy [5]. 20 to 30% of
patients with major depression do not respond to antide-
pressant medication and one-third of those who initially
responded relapse within a year [6]. Depressed patients form
a heterogeneous group showing quite different pathogeneses.
Traumatic experiences in childhood can be found in most
multifactor models on etiopathogenesis as a psychosocial

aspect of depression (e.g., [7–10]). Epigenetic studies fur-
ther substantiate the finding that a genetic vulnerability
will only lead to depression if the individual experienced
simultaneous early traumatization. Caspi et al. [11] showed
that early separation trauma triggers the 5-HTTLPR allele
in turn regulating relevant neurotransmitters hence evoking
depression. Childhood trauma may be one decisive source of
heterogeneity that may also depend on trauma type [10].

Trauma can be understood as a “relational” term, a
concept that connects an outer occurrence with its specific
consequences for an inner psychic reality [12, 13]. Referring
to Cooper [14] psychic trauma is any psychological event
that abruptly overwhelms the capacity to “provide a min-
imal sense of safety and integrative intactness, resulting in
overwhelming anxiety or helplessness, or the threat of it, and
producing an enduring change in the psychic organization”
(p. 44). With single trauma versus multiple trauma the
accumulation of traumatic experiences can be differentiated.

Depression Research and Treatment

In multiple trauma different traumatic events or situations
can either simultaneously, sequentially [15], complexly [16,
17], or cumulatively [18] be effective and thereby manifold
their impacts [12, 19–21]. Terr [22] differentiated between
type I and type II trauma. Type I trauma conceptualized as
“one sudden blow” (p. 13) following from an “unanticipated
single event” (p. 14). Type II trauma refers to “longstanding
or repeated exposure to extreme external events” (p. 15).

Clinical and survey studies show in general a significantly
higher prevalence of childhood trauma in mental disorders
(e.g., [12, 23, 24]) emphasizing a nonspecificity of traumatic
experiences as risk factors for the vulnerability to different
forms of psychopathology. Nonetheless, the relationship of
childhood trauma and an increased risk of depression in
adulthood has been confirmed in several cross-sectional (e.g.,
[25, 26]) and longitudinal (e.g., [27, 28]) studies. Most studies
rely on either community based surveys (e.g., [26, 27, 29–31])
or psychiatric outpatient samples with heterogeneous (e.g.,
[24, 32]) or homogeneous (e.g., [33]) psychopathology and
also ask for a possible relative specificity of trauma types and
diagnoses.

For example, several studies (e.g., [10, 34, 35]) docu-
mented the association of sexual abuse in childhood and
depression in adulthood. Molnar et al. [26] showed that
among men and women suffering from sexual abuse the risk
of developing a depression was 1.8 times higher. Others [34]
even discuss four times higher risk. Fergusson and Mullen
[34] reported in their community survey that 60% of the
women with exposure to childhood sexual abuse fulfilled
the criteria of a chronic major depression. Furthermore,
empirical findings showed that emotional abuse (e.g., [23, 30–
32]) and emotional neglect (e.g., [10, 27, 31, 33]) increase the
vulnerability to develop a major depression in adulthood. The
more chronic the abuse, the higher the lifetime prevalence
[27]. Subic-Wrana et al. [24] analyzed the specific relationship
of trauma types and frequencies of diagnoses in a general
clinical sample and found an association of emotional abuse
with depression and personality disorders (see also [36]) and
an association of physical abuse with somatoform disorders.
However, sexual abuse was associated with adjustment and
posttraumatic stress disorders [24]. Accordingly, Fernando
et al. [37] reported in a study on the impact of childhood
trauma on emotion regulation in borderline personality
disorders and major depression significantly higher scores
on emotional abuse and emotional neglect in depressed
patients, yet borderline patients reported significantly more
emotional abuse than did depressed patients. Bernet and
Stein [38] assessed 47 adults with major depression and
41 healthy controls who were given the CTQ. Patients
with major depression reported significantly more severe
emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and physical abuse in
childhood. Also Gibb et al. [32] found in a psychiatric
outpatient study that childhood emotional abuse was related
to major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social
phobia, whereas physical and sexual abuse were related to
anxiety disorders. Etain et al. [39] confirmed this same
preferential association of emotional abuse for a group of
bipolar patients. And Spinhoven et al. [33] found emotional

neglect as the predictor of depressive disorders, dysthymia,
and social phobia.

Another central finding was the relationship between the
number of different types of childhood maltreatment and
the risk for mental or medical disorders (e.g., [27, 28, 30, 31,
39, 40]). Multiple traumatic experiences are also assumed to
have a substantial impact on the persistence or chronicity
of severe depressive symptoms (e.g., [41]). For example,
Wiersma et al. [42] reported a dose-response relationship
between frequencies of childhood trauma and chronicity of
depression and identified childhood trauma as an indepen-
dent determinant of chronicity of depression. Tanskanen et
al. [28] confirmed in a large two-year follow-up community
sample that life-threatening accidents, victimization by vio-
lent crime, domestic violence, and childhood sexual abuse
were significantly higher among “persistent depressives” (p.
461); multiple traumatic experiences substantially increased
this likelihood. Widom et al. [27] showed in their prospective
longitudinal study on abused and neglected children that
children who experienced multiple forms of abuse or neglect
were at elevated risk for the development of a later depression.
Experiences of multiple childhood trauma also correlate with
severity of trauma (e.g., [43]). Khan et al. [31] confirmed this
graded dose-response relationship for multiplicity of trauma
and depression.

(IDS-SR)

Few studies explicitly compared chronically and non-
chronically depressed patients with respect to childhood
trauma: Wiersma et al. [42] found besides the longer illness
duration significantly more severe symptoms of depression
measured by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-
Self-Report
in chronically depressed patients
against nonchronically depressed patients signaling thresh-
olds from moderate to severe symptoms and from moderate
to mild symptoms, contrastingly. Klein et al. [44] showed
in a ten-year follow-up study on the course of chronic and
nonchronic depression that patients with dysthymia showed
slower rates of improvement over time and higher symptom
levels at 10-year assessments. Further, dysthymic patients met
symptom criteria for depressive disorder over a period of
60% of the follow-up, compared to 21% for patients with
nonchronic depressive disorders. Hence, authors suggested
chronic depression to be “more severe condition when
considered from a longitudinal perspective” (p. 878).

Moreover, chronicity in contrast to nonchronicity of
depression was significantly associated with emotional
neglect, psychological abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse
[42] (the ladder also more frequently in chronic compared
with nonchronic outpatients [45]). Spinhoven et al. [33]
reported dysthymia to show even higher significant asso-
ciations with the childhood adversities emotional neglect
and sexual abuse than did depression (p. 109). Riso et
al. [46] elaborated in their review that the development
of chronic depression compared to nonchronic forms may
involve increased levels of childhood adversity. Amongst
others, longer duration and higher symptom severity were
each associated with multiple forms of childhood adversity
in especially chronic depression [47]. A history of childhood
abuse also predicted a lower probability of remission [47].

Reported studies not only were based on distinct samples
but also relied on a variety of measures and different diagnos-
tic procedures. Though several studies used the Childhood
Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (e.g., [24, 32, 37, 38, 42, 45]),
others applied childhood trauma questions (e.g., [28, 40]),
scales [31], childhood trauma lists (e.g., [26]), and childhood
trauma interviews (e.g., [33, 40]), or abused or neglected
children were drawn from records of criminal courts (e.g.,
[27]). Some studies administered diagnostic interviews yield-
ing DSM-III/IV diagnoses (e.g., [26, 31–33, 45]), and others
relied on medical diagnoses (e.g., [24]) or applied symptom
inventories (e.g., [27, 28, 37, 42]).

The aims of this study were to examine extent and types of
retrospectively reported childhood abuse and neglect in adult
patients suffering from acute chronic forms of depression
operationalized as either diagnosis of dysthymia or double
depression lasting for at least 24 months or longer or a major
depressive episode currently lasting for at least 12 months or
longer. The CTQ was used to assess patients’ type and level
of childhood abuses and/or neglect. We predicted that a sub-
stantially high number of the chronically depressed patients
would report suffering from childhood trauma. We further
assumed a substantially high number of patients reporting
experiences of severe and of multiple trauma in childhood.
We predicted that depressed patients with multiple trauma
reports differed from patients with fewer trauma reports in
symptom severity assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI-2) referring to reportedly higher symptom severity in
chronically depressed patients (e.g., [42, 44, 47]). Secondly,
we investigated the association between trauma types and
symptom severity in chronically depressed patients and asked
for the specificity of trauma types or multiplicity.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants. Chronically depressed patients (according
to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders, Fourth Edition, DSM-IV [48]) were recruited
within the German LAC Depression Study between 2007
and 2013. LAC is an abbreviation for long-term treatment of
chronically depressed patients in German. The study exam-
ines the outcomes of psychotherapeutic long-term treatments
and compares psychoanalytic with cognitive-behavioral ther-
apies. The multicentre study combines a naturalistic and
randomized-controlled trial design. Patients between 21 and
60 years of age were included. Patients had to currently
meet a DSM-IV [48] diagnosis of either a major depressive
episode already lasting for at least 12 months or longer or a
dysthymia lasting for at least 24 months or longer at study
intake, respectively. Hence, chronicity was operationalized as
a function of time within diagnoses. In addition, patients had
to meet a BDI-2 score of above 17 and a Quick Inventory
of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-C, clinician version) score
of above 9. Exclusion criteria included ongoing or previous
psychotic symptoms, substance dependence, dementia or
decrements in cognitive functioning, a borderline, schizoty-
pal, schizoid, paranoid, or antisocial personality disorder, a
severe acute or chronic somatic disease, and acute suicidal
intentions. The Ethics Review Commission of the Federal

Chamber of Psychotherapy of the State of Hessen, Germany,
approved the study protocol. The study was registered with
ISRCTN91956346. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants after they had been provided with a full
description of the study. The study design is published in
detail elsewhere [49–51].

2.2. Measures. Diagnoses were made by independent,
trained, and supervised interviewers using the German
version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
(SCID I and SCID II) [52]. Chronicity was operationalized
as a function of time: Major depressive episodes had to
last for at least 12 months already at study intake (which
extends the diagnostic minimum requirement of two weeks).
Diagnoses of dysthymia or double depression indicate
depressive symptoms of at least 24 months or longer at
study intake. BDI-2 [53] and the QIDS-C [54] were used to
assess symptom severity. The global severity index of the
Symptom-Checklist (SCL-90-R) [55] indicated self-reported
global distress.

Childhood trauma was examined using the German
short version of the CTQ, a 28-item, clinically and non-
clinically well-validated self-report measure developed by
Bernstein et al. [56–58] (for the German version see [59–61]).
Only within the scale sexual abuse the perpetrator remains
indefinite. The other scales capture traumatic experiences
within family. Thus, the CTQ pictures traumatic experiences
within primary relations actually expected to offer protection
and holding (see also [24]). The retrospective self-report
of childhood memories yields five subscales of neglect and
abuses on a five-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 “never
true” to 5 “very often true”: emotional neglect and physical
neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse.
Each subscale consists of five items (for subscale details see
[57, p. 2]). Higher scores signal a higher extent of traumatic
experience. Emotional neglect refers to the lack of holding
and support as well as the deficient provision of emotional
needs such as love and belonging (item example: “When I was
growing up my family was a course of strength and support”).
Emotional abuse refers to an atmosphere of hatred, threat,
demeaning, and humiliation and pictures verbal abuses on
a child’s sense of worth or wellbeing (item example: “When
I was growing up someone in my family hated me”). Physical
neglect refers to the lack of basic physical needs such as food
and shelter and a sense of safeness (item example: “When I
was growing up I did not have enough to eat.”) Physical abuse
refers to physical assaults resulting in injury or risk (item
example: “When I was growing up I got hit so hard by someone
in my family that I had to go see a doctor or go to the hospital.”)
Sexual abuse corresponds to any sexual contact including
coercion between a child and an adult (item example: “When
I was growing up, someone tried to touch me in a sexual
way or tried to make me touch them”). Walker et al. [62]
externally validated the measure by an experienced clinical
interviewer who was blind to CTQ scores and determined
whether reports of trauma histories represented clinically
significant abuses or neglect. Following this clinical focus, the
authors calculated cutoff scores using thresholds in order to
specifically examine clinically relevant traumatic experiences.

4

Depression Research and Treatment

In the present study these cutoff scores were used to classify
patients according to types of reported childhood neglect or
abuses (see also [24, 63]). Cutoff scores according to Walker
et al. [62] for each subscale (along with the ranges of scores
for low, moderate, and severe trauma by Bernstein et al. [56])
were for sexual abuse ≥8 (low: 6-7; moderate: 8–12; severe: 13–
25), physical abuse ≥8 (low: 8-9; moderate: 10–12; severe: 13–
25), emotional abuse ≥10 (low: 9–12; moderate 13–15; severe
16–25), physical neglect ≥10 (low: 8-9; moderate 10–12; severe
13–25), and emotional neglect ≥15 (low 10–14; moderate 15–
17; severe: 18–25). In order to examine the impact of multiple
experiences of trauma we further considered the number of
scales achieving these cutoff scores for each patient.

2.3. Data Analysis. Homogeneity between patient and miss-
ing data was analyzed using chi-square and Mann-Whitney
tests. For further analyses missing data were excluded. The
sample was first split into a group of traumatized chronically
depressed patients who achieved cutoff scores according to
Walker et al. [62] in the CTQ subscales, respectively, and
a group of nontraumatized but still chronically depressed
patients. For frequencies group differences were calculated
using 𝜒2
. Spearman correlations were used to estimate cor-
relations between trauma subtypes. Secondly, the sample was
divided into four trauma groups using an index counting
the number of traumatic experiences reported: a subthreshold
trauma group not reporting clinically relevant traumatic
experiences, a single trauma group, reporting trauma on one
scale, a double trauma group reporting trauma on two scales,
and a multiple trauma group reporting trauma on three to
five scales according to the above described cutoff scores,
respectively. Group differences for multiplicity were tested
pertaining to depression symptom severity (BDI-2) using
one-way analyses of variance. Stepwise multiple regression
analyses were conducted using the BDI-2 as the dependent
variable and the five CTQ subscales, gender (Model 1),
and multiplicity (Model 2) as independent variables. All
statistical tests were two-tailed and for multiple comparisons
a Bonferroni correction was applied. All computations were
calculated with SPSS 22.

3. Results

The intention to treat sample of the LAC Depression Study
included a total of 402 patients. 349 patients completed the
CTQ. Missing data arose from incomplete questionnaires or
patient study withdrawals. Statistical controls of homogeneity
between patient and missing data using Mann-Whitney 𝑈
tests were not significant for age at study intake (𝑝 = .084),
BDI-2 (𝑝 = .176), QIDS-C (𝑝 = .106), and GSI/SCL-90
(𝑝 = .211) and were not significant using chi-square tests
for gender (𝑝 = .868), diagnosis (𝑝 = .108), marital status
(𝑝 = .825), education (𝑝 = .898), and number of previous
outpatient treatments (𝑝 = .181) giving no indication for
dropout distortions. The characteristics of the CTQ samples
are detailed in Table 1. Age at study intake was on average
40.40 (SD 10.58) years. The female-male ratio corresponded
to clinically depressed populations (male: 𝑛 = 113; female:
𝑛 = 236). The distribution of diagnoses is shown in Table 1.

34.7% of the patients were depressed for 24 months. The BDI-
2 mean score of 32.28 and the QIDS-C at least mean score
of 14.41 show severe to moderate depressive symptoms. The
sample features a mean score of 1.29 (SD = 0.55) in the general
severity index (GSI) of the SCL-90 indicating a fairly high
psychic distress in patients. The chronicity of depression of
the sample is further underlined by the high rate of 71.4%
of patients who had been treated previously to study intake.
43.6% underwent more than one previous treatment.

The CTQ total score reached an average of 57.10 (SD =
18.41). In total, 75.6% of our chronically depressed patients
reported clinically relevant histories of traumatic experiences
in childhood on at least one scale (Table 2). 60.7% of the
sample reported traumatic experiences of emotional abuse,
51.9% reported emotional neglect, and 25.2% reported sexual
abuse in childhood. Means within CTQ subscale groups
indicate trauma severity on thresholds from moderate to

severe [56] indicating clinically relevant traumatization in
childhood [62]. Gender differences were found: significantly
more women reported a history of emotional abuse (𝜒2
= 7.44,
𝑝 = .006) and of sexual abuse (𝜒2
= 10.83, 𝑝 = .001). The
total number of patients achieving thresholds in at least one
subscale also showed significant gender differences (𝜒2
= 3.97,
𝑝 = .046).

Spearman correlations between the types of childhood
trauma were fairly moderate in magnitude. The highest cor-
relations were found between emotional abuse and emotional
neglect (0.64, 𝑝 ≤ .001). Others were lower. Subscale
correlations are presented in Table 3.

In order to calculate dose-response relationships we
further differentiated four trauma groups; hence an index was
used counting the number of scales per patient that achieved
cutoff scores for clinically relevant reports of traumatic
experiences according to Walker et al. [62]: subthreshold
trauma, single trauma, double trauma, and multiple trauma.
The multiple trauma group refers to trauma reports on three
to five scales. Group distribution is shown in Table 4. 37%
of our patients reported multiple trauma and 18.1% double
trauma. A tendency towards significant gender differences
was found (𝜒2
= 7.47, 𝑝 = .058) within trauma groups.
Most frequently the combination of emotional abuse and
emotional neglect was reported (𝑛 = 37, 14.0%) followed
by emotional abuse alone (𝑛 = 33, 12.5%). 28 (10.6%)
patients achieved thresholds on all five CTQ subscales. This
was followed by 9.8% (𝑛 = 26) achieving cutoffs for the
combination of emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and
physical neglect.

Table 5 shows the BDI-2 descriptive scores within the
four trauma groups, respectively. The mean score increases
from the single to the multiple trauma group. Interestingly,
patients in the subthreshold trauma group show similar
values as patients in the double trauma group. In the analysis
of variance with age and gender as covariates (Table 6) we

found a highly significant effect of the trauma group. Though
the Levene test indicates a violation of the assumption of
homogeneity of variance, results can be retained as to the
large sample and the validation of this highly significant result
through an additionally conducted Kruskal-Wallis test. For
post hoc analyses we used the Games Howell test robust
against violations of homogeneity of variance. The multiple
trauma group differs significantly with higher values from the
three other trauma groups.

First, a stepwise multiple regression analysis (Model 1)
was performed between the BDI-2 mean score indicating
symptom severity as the dependent variable and emotional,
physical, and sexual abuse and emotional and physical
neglect scores from the CTQ as the predictor variables
(Table 7). Due to significant gender differences within
the CTQ subscales, emotional abuse and sexual abuse, we
included gender in the model. Results included the subscales
emotional abuse and sexual abuse as explanatory variables
significantly increasing the risk of symptom severity in
chronically depressed patients (𝑅 = .251, 𝑅2 = .063, 𝐹 =
11.584, and 𝑝 < .01). After emotional abuse and sexual
abuse were considered in step two, the remaining abuses and
neglect as well as gender failed to contribute significantly
to depression symptom severity in chronically depressed
patients.

4. Discussion

This study investigated prevalence, extent, and associations
of childhood trauma exposure in a specific chronically
depressed adult sample diagnosed according to DSM-IV
criteria. We relied on the CTQ as an internationally widely
used, reliable, and valid instrument. Chronicity was assessed
through DSM diagnoses and validated by the substantial
number of patients undergoing up to four treatments before
study intake. This allowed comparisons between traumatized
chronically depressed patients with a clinically significant
history of childhood trauma and chronically depressed
patients without such a history providing strength as to
the possibility of differentially investigating trauma within
chronically depressed patients.

Overall, the prevalence of childhood trauma was remark-
ably high with a magnitude of 75.6%. Moreover, CTQ sub-
scale means indicated childhood trauma on the thresholds
from moderate to severe exposure [56–58]. We additionally
applied higher thresholds for the specific examination of clin-
ically relevant childhood trauma [62]. Specific contributions
of certain types of childhood trauma to the vulnerability of
different forms of psychopathology were repeatedly reported.

Depression Research and Treatment

Our results show that emotional abuse was reported most fre-
quently with 61%. Additionally, 25% of the patients reported
childhood sexual abuse. Contrastingly, 15% emotional abuse
and 12.6% sexual abuse were found in a representative
German survey study on the prevalence of childhood trauma
[64]. These findings show chronically depressed patients to
be highly burdened by childhood adversities and supports
reports of greater childhood adversity in chronic forms of
depression compared to nonchronic forms [46]. For example,
dysthymic patients were reported to have significantly poorer
early parental relationships and to receive less care than
patients with episodic depression [65]. Also, duration of
depression was reported to be uniquely predicted by maternal
abuse, maternal indifference, and paternal overcontrol [47].
In our study, women reported significantly more frequent
childhood trauma in general and emotional abuse and sexual
abuse in particular. McGrath et al. [66] pointed to the higher
risk of victimization in women and estimated childhood
abuse in women at 21.7 to 37%. Lampe’s [67] review on
childhood trauma confirmed that women suffered more
frequently from sexual abuse than men. Scher et al. [63]
showed that women were nearly twice as likely to report
emotional abuse and four times as likely to report sexual
abuse. Furthermore, our results showed that when referring
to associations of trauma types and trauma groups with
symptom severity, gender did not contribute significantly.
Arnow et al. [68] examined the moderating role of gender
on the association between childhood abuse, neglect, and
depression, yet they found no gender differences. However,
they also identified significantly more depressed women than
men reporting histories of emotional abuse and sexual abuse,
which they interpreted as stemming from higher rates of
victimization among women (p. 179). The lack of evidence for
gender differences in the relationship of childhood adversity
and depression was also substantiated by other studies report-
ing that among those with a history of childhood sexual abuse
[35] with physical [69] or emotional abuse [69, 70] men and
women were equally at risk for depression.

Mainly, our results suggest a substantial influence of
multiple childhood trauma on a severe and chronic course
of depression in adulthood. 37% of our patients reported a
history of multiple childhood trauma, that is, trauma reports
on at least three to maximum five CTQ scales. Additionally,
18.1% achieved thresholds on at least two subscales. Also in
line with other studies [27, 28, 40, 42], the patients reporting
multiple childhood trauma showed greater symptom severity
suggesting a dose-response relationship between the number
of childhood maltreatments and symptomatology. This sug-
gests that cooccurrences of childhood trauma and its possible
effects being synergistic or additive [12, 71] due to cumulative,
sequential, simultaneous, and/or complex [16, 17] impacts
may be specifically relevant in chronically depressed patients.
This “cumulative effect of chronic exposure to multiple
adversities” (p. 95) [72] was in general stressed as the largest
burden of diseases within the ACE study.

Moreover, results indicated that significant associations
between the trauma types, emotional abuse and sexual abuse,
and symptom severity (Model 1) in chronically depressed
patients were not maintained when taking multiplicity

(Model 2) into account. Though both regression models only
accounted for a poor amount of variance (4–6%), results
replicated empirical findings (see, e.g., a meta-analysis on
nonsexual maltreatment [43] reporting robust evidence for
the relationship of emotional abuse and depression or a
systematic review on the evidence of the relationship between
childhood sexual abuse and mental disorders reporting odds
ratios of 1.1 (p. 1886) for depression [73]). Yet, these studies
did not take multiplicity of childhood trauma exposures into
account. Multiplicity was also related to severity [30, 43, 74]
which we supported referring to our figures of CTQ subscale
distributions and mean values.

Fischer and Riedesser [12] stress childhood sexual abuse
as a serious relational trauma and conceptualized childhood
sexual abuse itself as multiple trauma (p. 303). Wetzel [75],
for example, found that 64.3% of sexually abused participants
were at the same time physically abused. Molnar et al. [26]
examined the relation between childhood sexual abuse and
later psychopathology and reported significantly higher per-
centages of women and men with lifetime dysthymia (15.7%
and 12.5%) and depression (39.3% and 30.3%) among those
reporting childhood sexual abuse. Briere and Elliott [76]
linked experiences of childhood sexual abuse to disruptions
in the development of a sense of self, causing difficulties in
relating to others. Unfortunately the CTQ subscale for sexual
abuse lacks information on perpetrators and the victims’
relations to them making conclusions on familial versus
nonfamilial sexual abuse impossible.

With emotional abuse depression is again associated with
trauma as a “relational” term. This type captures a narcissistic
dimension of hatred, threat, demeaning, and humiliation and
pictures verbal abuses on a child’s sense of worth or wellbeing
also embodying experiences of repeated losses in primary
relations. Emotionally abused children may also attribute
more negatively than nonabused children which may lead
to the development of a general negative attribution style
[77–80]. For example, Gibb and Abela [81] investigated the
potential of emotional abuse to change children’s inferential
styles in a sample of 140 children of parents with a depression
history. They found that emotional abuse was significantly
related to changes in children’s inferential styles regarding
consequences and self-characteristics.

Beyond multiplicity, Khan et al. [31] argued for specific
sensitive exposure periods exerting maximal impact on risk
for major depression (see p. 23). The authors caution that the
linear increase associated with exposure to the number of
different types of maltreatment may be a statistical byproduct
of the fact that exposure to more types of abuse increases the
chance of experiencing a critical form of maltreatment at a
critical age. Their results showed that being rejected at the age
of 14 was a crucial risk for depression: females were particu-
larly sensitive to peer emotional abuse and males to parental
nonverbal emotional abuse at the age of 14, respectively.
Unfortunately, the CTQ neither allows an investigation of
critical developmental periods (p. 23) nor asks for peer abuse.
Rather, the CTQ captures an atmosphere of primary relations
and trauma comprised of a loss of sense of self-worth,
wellbeing, or self-efficacy (e.g., [8, 9, 82, 83]). This allows
linkages to psychoanalytical conceptions of inner objects

8

Depression Research and Treatment

through processes of identification and introjection (e.g.,
[9, 82]) or to attachment theory (e.g., [84–86]) that might
explain the strong connection of multiple trauma exposure
to symptom severity in chronically depressed patients. It
marks the disruption of one’s capacity to ascribe meaning to
trauma, the loss of a basic sense of trust, and an enduring
shock of one’s understanding of the outer and the inner world
[13, 14, 83]. Fonagy et al. [87] showed that rates of insecure
attachment in dysthymia were significantly higher than in
major depression.

Strengths of this study include a large sample of patients
solely diagnosed with chronic forms of depression using
structured diagnostic interviews and the use of a well-
validated instrument of childhood abuse. However, this
study design also has several limitations: the retrospective
assessment of childhood abuse and neglect may be subject
to recall biases. Yet, adults’ recall on trauma is reported to
be relatively reliable [88, 89]. Along with good criterion-
related validity with therapist’s ratings of abuse [58], we
also applied thresholds specifically developed to investigate
clinically significant histories of childhood trauma [62].
Nevertheless, the measure captures specific types of trauma
in contrast, for example, to early loss of parents, natural
catastrophes, physical or mental disease in childhood or of
parents, and peer abuses. Future research would especially
benefit from focusing on a longitudinal aspect that allows
a direct examination of trauma exposure and its relation to
chronic depression and therapy outcomes.

Our findings suggest implications for clinical practice.
Clinicians should precisely look for the presence of childhood
trauma in chronically depressed patients being aware of
its possible prognostic implications. In particular multiple
traumatic experiences, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse
may lead to a more chronic and severe course of depression.
Nonetheless, a group of likewise severely depressed patients
reporting histories of childhood trauma subthreshold as
conceptualized within this study remained. This underlines
that childhood trauma may only be one central pathway
leading to chronic depression in adulthood (e.g., [8, 9, 12,
13, 19–21, 89, 90]). Depression summarizes a group of highly
complex mental disorders that have to be diagnosed precisely
and treated cautiously in consideration of its origins. For
example, patients with a history of childhood trauma showed
a poorer medication response than those without such a
history and were significantly more likely to remit with
psychotherapy than pharmacotherapy [47].

5. Conclusion

Consistent with previous studies showing an association of
childhood trauma and depression, in our study a high num-
ber of chronically depressed patients experienced not only
childhood trauma, but also multiple trauma. The magnitude
in frequency of traumatized depressives and of multiply trau-
matized depressed patients remarkably stresses the impact of
trauma within chronic courses of depressive disorders and
the necessity to intensively and critically integrate this trauma
aspect in treatments. Particularly multiple childhood trauma
might be specifically related to chronic courses of depression.
