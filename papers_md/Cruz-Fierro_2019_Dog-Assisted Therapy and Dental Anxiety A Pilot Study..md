Simple Summary: The participation of animals, speciﬁcally dogs, in therapeutic activities has been
demonstrated to improve individuals’ physical and mental health. However, few investigations
have been carried out in the area of dentistry. This study was conducted to evaluate the eﬀect
of dog-assisted therapy for individuals with a history of anxiety related to dental visits. During
preventative dental procedures (cleaning), a therapy dog accompanied the participant. After this
intervention, people reported lower perceived discomfort at dental visits. The participation of therapy
dogs in this area of health could help improve people’s experiences in dental oﬃces.

Abstract: Animal-assisted therapy aimed at improving individuals’ mental or physical health has
been widely reported. However, the data on how a therapy dog could help control anxiety during
dental procedures is scarce. The objective of this work was to evaluate the eﬀect of dog-assisted
therapy on people with a history of dental anxiety while receiving preventive dental treatment.
Twelve adults participated (women: n = 11 (91.7%) and men: n = 1 (8.3%), mean age = 31.25 years,
D.E. = 5.78). The Corah Dental Anxiety Scale was applied, the patient’s mood was assessed with a
Likert scale before and after receiving the dental treatment, and their blood pressure was recorded
for each of the three stages of treatment. A therapy dog accompanied the participants during the
dental procedure. The main results indicated that a decrease in discomfort was perceived during
the intervention, and there was also an improvement in the patient’s evaluation of the experience.
The results are based on the decrease in patients’ blood pressure when taken in the middle of the
dental treatment.

1. Introduction

Fearing or refusing dental treatment is a negative emotional reaction manifested by cognitive,
physiological, and motor responses [1], which, when associated with dental visits or dental treatment,
is referred to as dental anxiety [2].

Avoidance behavior is one of the main causes of canceled appointments or lack of interest in dental
treatment, which in turn generate tooth decay, decreased self-esteem, and poor quality of life [3,4].
However, the responses observed in each person vary depending on individual coping resources [5,6].
This variation in response, together with its multifactor origin [7], contributes to the lack of clarity in
its etiology, making it diﬃcult to choose the most appropriate treatment for its control [1].

Dental anxiety can be acquired through direct conditioning, generating mostly physiological and
behavioral responses, or through indirect conditioning through experiences narrated by other people,
tending to prompt subjective responses [1,8–11].

To control these negative reactions during dental treatment, diﬀerent techniques have been
proposed, which are mainly focused on non-pharmacological management (tell–show–do technique,
voice control, non-verbal communication, positive reinforcement, distraction), pharmacological
management with nitrous oxide, sedation, and general anesthesia [12], or modifying the environment
through both sounds and lights speciﬁcally designed for helping pediatric patients [13].

In addition to these traditional techniques, the use of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) has been
proposed as an alternative that produces calming eﬀects for people, as previously learned from
relationships between humans and animals [14]. This ﬁnding is supported by results that have been
reported in animal-assisted activities (AAA) in diﬀerent areas, such as visits to hospitals and nursing
homes; in interventions to support at-risk youth or delinquents; and in psychotherapy, social work,
and physiotherapy, as well as in reading and education programs [15,16].

There is broad historical support for these activities in the medical ﬁeld, beginning with the work
of Nightingale in 1800 [17]. In 1962, Levinson formally integrated animal-assisted activities with
clinical psychology [18]. Since then, diﬀerent studies have conﬁrmed their eﬀects, and to date, this
form of therapy has been supported by diﬀerent organizations worldwide [19].

Currently, in diﬀerent parts of the world, beneﬁcial eﬀects have been observed in patients visiting
hospitals accompanied by therapy dogs, with reports of their inﬂuence on improving blood pressure and
neurohormone levels and facilitating anxiety management [20,21]. Although these hospital activities
follow strict clinical guidelines, such as those proposed by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of
America [22], their recent inclusion and the cultural diﬀerences regarding the role of animals limit the
dissemination of such practices in various areas.

In dental practice, various publications have reported that dog-assisted activities contribute to
reducing anxiety, among which the report by Solana [23] for the American Dental Association (ADA)
stands out, as does the study by Cajares, Rutledge, and Haney [24], who measured the levels of dental
anxiety in a group of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Studies have conﬁrmed
that these animal-assisted activities cause a relaxing eﬀect in people that allows them to divert their
attention to the dog and therefore reduce their anxiety [25].

It is important to expand the data to strengthen alternative techniques that contribute to prevention,
thereby improving individuals’ oral health and quality of life and expanding knowledge of the beneﬁts
obtained through AAT as a support method for the management of dental anxiety.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in dental anxiety when introducing a therapy
dog during a prophylactic procedure, hypothesizing a decreased state of anxiety in the participants
given the presence of the canine assistant during the intervention.

2. Materials and Methods

A non-probabilistic convenience sampling was conducted whose inclusion criteria required being
of legal age, having expressed apprehension (stress, anxiety, fear) when going to the dentist, and
liking dogs.

The following were considered exclusion criteria: fear of interacting with dogs, regardless of their

size; disgust at being licked by dogs; allergic to dogs.

Instruments: The Corah Dental Anxiety Scale (CDAS) was used [26], which is a Likert-type
instrument with four questions scored from 1–5 points for a total possible value of 20. A score of 13
or 14 suggests to the dentist that the patient has dental anxiety, and a score of 15 or more generally
indicates a patient with high dental anxiety [27]. For this study, a minimum score of 13 was considered
indicative of anxiety suﬃcient for inclusion in the study; the reliability of the instrument had a value of
α = 0.73.

To identify possible diﬀerences between the participants’ prior experiences and what was
experienced during this session, a questionnaire was designed with two questions aimed at prior
experiences with dentistry and three at their participation in the project assisted by a dog. The following
questions were asked prior to the intervention: “How did you feel about going to the dentist?” and the
open-ended “Going to the dentist is . . . ” After the oﬃce visit, the following questions were asked:
“How do you feel?”, “Going to the dentist is . . . ”, and “What did you think of going in with (name of
the dog)?” The questionnaire was designed as a Likert scale with six possible answers, the numerical
values of which were weighted from 1 (the worst) to 6 (the best). The reliability of the instrument
had a value of α = 0.67. Item analysis revealed that the last question, which was oriented to how the
patient perceived having gone in with the animal, showed low item-total correlation; after this item
was eliminated, instrument reliability increased to α = 0.70.

We used a Beurer BC-58 wrist blood pressure monitor, Beurer GmbH, Neu-Ulm, Germany, which
performs an automatic measurement of arterial pressure (systolic and diastolic pressure) and radial
pulse, following the manufacturer’s instructions for use.

Therapy dogs: For this study, the participation of four dogs, three females and one male, was
included; the dogs’ breeds were English Shepherd, Schnauzer, Border Collie, and Labrador Retriever.
All the dogs were adults, sterilized, vaccinated, and dewormed, with an average age of 40 months
(SD = 19.25). Of these, two dogs already had participated in various workshops and activities as
therapy dogs; for the other two, this experience was their ﬁrst. All the dogs were evaluated by a
canine trainer certiﬁed by the Certiﬁcation Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) for selection
considering the circumstances and environment under which they would work: reduced space, new
visual and auditory stimuli, and close contact with unknown people, among others. Likewise, a test
session was conducted in place with each dog separately before being included in the study.

Canine teams worked as volunteers; handlers were not compensated for participating, and
were also previously trained in the privacy standards and given all the necessary details about the
dental treatment.

The research project adheres to ethical standards and was approved by the Bioethical Review
Commission of the School of Dentistry of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León on 27 May 2016,
sheet 0100 and code SPSI-010613.

Procedure: The invitation to participate in this research project was publicized on a page within
Facebook conducted by researchers of a research group of the School of Psychology, which was
oriented to the dissemination of scientiﬁc information on the human–animal bond. The invitation
included the objective of the research, and its procedure was reported: participating in a preventive
conventional dental prophylactic treatment without cost. Contact was made via email. The interested
parties received more detailed information about the project, which included the previously described
inclusion criteria, the dates and time available, which depended on the availability of the volunteer
handlers, and the need to sign an informed consent once the project was made known in greater
detail. The form authorized the indicated procedure and permitted videotaping the session, and the
participant agreed to complete the previously described questionnaires.

Once the day of the appointment was agreed upon, a photograph of the therapy dog that would
assist the individual was sent to the person. Dogs were randomly assigned to patients, with the sole
criterion that both coincided in date and time. On the appointed date, the therapy dog and its handler
were introduced, and instructions were given regarding the treatment of the dog (where and how to
hold it, so that the dog feels comfortable) and telling the participant that he or she should feel free to
touch or caress the dog when he or she felt anxious and/or stressed. Blood pressure and pulse were
taken at three periods: before, midway through treatment, and at the end of treatment.

The questions aimed at knowing their previous and current experiences regarding the intervention

were delivered before and at the end of the intervention.

The guidelines for the basic measures for the prevention of biological risks, disinfection of surfaces
and instruments, and the use of disposable barriers and supplies, according to the Oﬃcial Mexican
Standard, NOM-013-SSA2-2006 [28], were followed.

The sessions were carried out following an infection control protocol, using physical barriers
to avoid direct contact of the dog with the furniture. The equipment was used exclusively for the
intervention. For infection control, before and after the session, the areas were thoroughly cleaned to
remove organic material, followed by basic disinfection, using a 1:32 dilution of household bleach
(1/2 cup of sodium hypochlorite per gallon of water). Periodically, the areas were fumigated [29,30].
For the disinfection of surfaces and prevention of zoonoses, the guidelines recommended in
the compendium of measures to prevent diseases associated with animals in public places were
followed [31], as were guidelines for hospitals [32–34].

The dogs’ health was monitored by the veterinarian, who certiﬁed that the dog was healthy,
had a complete vaccination and deworming program in place, and showed no signs of physical,
dermatological, or oral diseases. The dog’s temperament was evaluated by the trainer, as previously
mentioned, and handlers were in frequent contact with her. Patient contact with any bodily ﬂuid was
avoided. In addition, prior to the appointment, the dog was brushed to remove loose hair. At all times,
the dog’s behavior and welfare was supervised by its handler [35].

During the intervention, the dog was placed on a clean towel over the patient’s legs; both at the
beginning and at the end of the intervention, the participant was invited to wash and sanitize their
hands [22,36]. The dentist was assisted by a psychologist who monitored the patient’s behavior and
well-being, took readings from the blood pressure monitor, and provided any necessary supplies, thus
preventing the dentist from abandoning his or her activities and thereby compromising the hygiene of
the procedure.

Statistical analysis: The reliability of all the questionnaires was analyzed before performing any
other analysis. To determine the participants’ history of dental anxiety, descriptive measures of the
mean and standard deviation of the CDAS scale were taken. To evaluate changes in dental anxiety, the
responses to the questionnaire designed for this study were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank test.
The values of heart rate, high blood pressure, and low blood pressure were contrasted relative to three
periods—before, midway, and end of the intervention—with the Friedman test.

3. Results

Twelve people with a history of dental anxiety participated in this study, all of whom were adults
living in the metropolitan area of Nuevo León, Mexico. Of these, 11 were women (91.7%), and one
was a man (8.3%). The mean age of the group was 31.25 years (SD = 5.78). Three of them, 40%, were
married; the rest were single. Regarding the level of dental anxiety, the group had an average score on
the CDAS scale of 14.41 points (SD = 2.74).

Perceptions and feelings prior to the intervention, which related to the degree of dental anxiety
that each of these items aroused, are presented in Table 1. As observed, all the items had a mean score
greater than or equal to the mean level of the scale, which was scored as tension (value 3) and close to
anxiety (value 4). The average value of the summed results of the scale was 14.41 (SD = 2.74). The
frequency and percentage per question of each of the questionnaire items are shown in Appendix A.
As for the questions oriented to the participant’s perceptions and feelings before and after
the assisted dental intervention with dogs, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence was obtained between how the
participant felt in previous visits (How did you feel about going to the dentist?) and the current
session (How do you feel?): Z = 2.96, p = 0.003. The average value of how they felt in previous
visits was 3.2 (range = 4), and the average value of the current visit was 4.9 (range = 3). That is, an
improvement was reported after the dog-assisted intervention. In relation to how both experiences
were perceived, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were also found: Z = 2.89, p = 0.004. In this second category, the
mean value of the perception prior to the dentist visit (Previsit question: Going to the dentist is . . . )

Animals 2019, 9, 512

5 of 9

was 2.2 (range = 4); after dog-assisted intervention (Postvisit question: Going to the dentist is . . . ),
it was 4.5 (range = 3) (see Table 2).

Finally, Table 3 shows the descriptive data and comparison tests of the three physiological
measures taken before, during, and after the intervention. There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in high and
low blood pressure, with a decrease during the intervention (midpoint), i.e., when accompanied by the
dog. While pulse also decreases, this change does not reach statistical signiﬁcance.

The analysis of the pulse and blood pressure measurements at the beginning and midpoint of
the intervention showed that in all three measurements, these had decreased during the assisted
intervention with the dog (Table 4). It is deduced that the presence of the dog helped the person feel
more relaxed in the middle of the procedure, while the increase observed at the end of the procedure
could be because the person was reactivating to get up from the chair and leave the doctor’s oﬃce,
since the treatment had ended.

4. Discussion

6 of 9

This study is based on the exploration of the potential of assisted interventions with animals in
the ﬁeld of dental health through the focus on psychological phenomena. As its sole objective, the
evaluation of the eﬀect of canine accompaniment in dental practice for the reduction of dental anxiety
was proposed, and it was hypothesized that the presence of the dog would decrease participants’ anxiety.
To achieve this eﬀect, participants with a history of dental anxiety veriﬁable through a reliable
psychometric evaluation were included. Four dogs with variable experience as therapy dogs
participated with their handlers, which were all randomly assigned to the human participants.

To test the hypothesis, the study included self-assessments of the level of anxiety perceived
by the patient in previous experiences and the current experience assisted by a dog. Physiological
measurements, speciﬁcally pulse and blood pressure, were taken at three instances: before, midpoint,
and at the end of the intervention.

According to the results obtained, there was a history of dental anxiety in the patients as expected.
Aspects such as thinking about going and waiting for the instruments to be prepared for the intervention
were the reasons that provoked the most unease. After the intervention, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
found in how the experience of going to and participating in the dental appointment was evaluated:
being accompanied by a dog led to a decrease in discomfort. In addition, there was an improvement in
how the experience of going to the dentist was perceived.

These results support the working hypothesis proposed in this research: the presence of an animal
(dog) decreases the participants’ anxiety, which is already documented in nondental spaces [14]. This
fact was corroborated by the decrease in blood pressure (high and low) in the middle of the intervention.
For pulse, other physiological measure were used; although it showed a similar behavior—decrease
during the intervention—its change did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.

In another study of 30 patients with intellectual disabilities, ranging in age from 24 and 66 years,
who received dental care under sedation, the therapy dog accompanied the patients until the moment
at which the anesthesia was induced. Anxiety was measured with the Anxiety Depression and Mood
Scale (ADAMS), evaluating the behavior before and after interacting with the therapy dog, and a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p < 0.019) was found in the reduction of anxiety, from moderate levels (M = 4.30,
SD = 0.79) to minor levels (M = 2.93, SD = 0.86) [24]. These results coincide with those of the present
study, where the physiological data show a decrease in symptoms associated with an anxious state.

While little scientiﬁc information has been reported so far on the psychological beneﬁts provided
by therapy dogs to patients with dental anxiety, the results are encouraging, and for this reason, it is
of great importance to expand these data based on scientiﬁc evidence that justiﬁes the use of these
non-invasive procedures in people with disabilities, especially those disabilities in which people cannot
communicate or express their emotions. In addition to contributing to strengthening and regulating the
biosafety protocols of these procedures, patients with disabilities may be systemically more vulnerable,
which further research can help address.

This project was based on the theory of learning as an antecedent to how the person will experience
a new situation: it situates the dental anxiety experienced by the participants and its acquisition in
various ways [1,8–11], in the face of empirical knowledge that the presence of an animal has eﬀects on
perceived anxiety in diﬀerent spaces and for diﬀerent reasons [14]. Accordingly, it is observed that
there is indeed support for managing dental anxiety using the presence of animals.

Although this approach assumes that a basic requirement for working with dogs is to feel
comfortable with them, which can be seen as a determining factor in the outcome, in turn, it considers
the cognitive and physiological responses associated with discomfort that can diminish or even lead to
abandoning dental treatments with gradual adverse consequences for general health [3,4]. For this
reason, apart from expanding the knowledge about the eﬀect of animals on human health, this research
opens up the opportunity to consider it as an option to augment existing techniques to support patients
with this type of negative reaction [12,13], considering the merging of several disciplines with the
same objective.

Regarding the limitations of this pilot study, the small sample size is the main limitation, because a
small number of participants does not enable generalizing the results. However, the results demonstrate
an improvement in controlling negative emotions such as dental anxiety in people without disabilities,
thus promoting the development of broader multidisciplinary studies on the subject by psychologists,
orthodontists, and veterinarians. Since it is a simple, non-invasive and economical procedure, AAT is
an excellent option for the management of dental anxiety, especially in people who live with dogs on a
daily basis and keep them indoors as part of their family. A further limitation has been the acceptance
of AAT in the dental environment by health personnel, because when seeking authorization from
local health authorities to implement a large-scale project in dental oﬃces, authorization was rejected,
citing possible hygiene problems or risk to patients. Thus, research on the subject must be expanded,
including an evaluation of possible infections or other health risks for humans and dogs.

Recommendations for the continuity of this project include testing this type of intervention with
people with disabilities and with patients who have resorted to sedation to explore its possibility as a
less invasive alternative.
