Background: Sleep disturbance is a common clinical issue for patients with psychosis. It has been identiﬁed as a
putative causal factor in the onset and persistence of psychotic experiences (paranoia and hallucinations).
Hence sleep disruption may be a potential treatment target to prevent the onset of psychosis and reduce persis-
tent psychotic experiences. The aim of this review is to describe developments in understanding the nature,
causal role, and treatment of sleep disruption in psychosis.
Method: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies, published in the last ﬁve years, inves-
tigating subjective sleep disruption and psychotic experiences.
Results: Fifty-eight papers were identiﬁed: 37 clinical and 21 non-clinical studies. The studies were correlational
(n = 38; 20 clinical, 18 non-clinical), treatment (n = 7; 1 non-clinical), qualitative accounts (n = 6 clinical),
prevalence estimates (n = 5 clinical), and experimental tests (n = 2 non-clinical). Insomnia (50%) and night-
mare disorder (48%) are the most prevalent sleep problems found in patients. Sleep disruption predicts the
onset and persistence of psychotic experiences such as paranoia and hallucinations, with negative affect identi-
ﬁed as a partial mediator of this relationship. Patients recognise the detrimental effects of disrupted sleep and are
keen for treatment. All psychological intervention studies reported large effect size improvements in sleep and
there may be modest resultant improvements in psychotic experiences.
Conclusions: Sleep disruption is a treatable clinical problem in patients with psychosis. It is important to treat in
its own right but may also lessen psychotic experiences. Research is required on how this knowledge can be im-
plemented in clinical services.

1. Introduction

“When I'm tired, everything is worse”
(Patient with psychosis, Waite et al., 2016a, p.186)

Since the ﬁrst descriptions of schizophrenia sleep dysfunction has
been a feature of patient, family, and clinician accounts (see Kraeplin,
1919; Birchwood et al., 1989; Yung and McGorry, 1996). Despite this,
sleep problems have been overlooked as a treatment target. Historically,
sleep disruption has been seen as a non-speciﬁc epiphenomenon or sec-
ondary consequence of a core psychotic disturbance. Over the past ten
years there has been increasing interest in a different view: that sleep
dysfunction may be a potential causal mechanism in the onset and per-
sistence of psychotic experiences (Anderson and Bradley, 2013;

Freeman et al., 2009; Reeve et al., 2015; Soehner et al., 2013; Waters
et al., 2017). This paradigm shift identiﬁes sleep disruption as a potential
novel treatment target for psychotic symptoms. It also provides a route
to determine causality: if successful treatment of sleep problems results
in improvements in psychotic experiences then a causal relationship is
demonstrated. Our previous review found that sleep disturbance and
psychotic experiences co-occur (Reeve et al., 2015), but the direction
of effect and underlying mechanisms were yet to be established. Given
the recent work on sleep and psychosis, particularly treatment innova-
tion, it is timely to review the current status of the evidence and con-
sider the implications for clinical practice.

In patients with psychosis sleep problems are very common. For ex-
ample, in a survey of 1809 patients with non-affective psychosis attend-
ing NHS mental health services, 50.1% had clinically signiﬁcant levels of
insomnia (Freeman et al., 2019). Disturbances in sleep architecture and
circadian systems are also typically found in patients (Cosgrave et al.,
2018). Indeed the clinical picture is complex, with comorbidity of
sleep disorders normal rather than the exception (Reeve et al., 2019b).
Patient accounts highlight an interaction between sleep difﬁculties
and psychotic experiences and describe the negative impact on

functioning (Faulkner and Bee, 2017; Waite et al., 2016a; Waite et al.,
2018). Clinicians certainly recognise the prevalence and importance of
sleep problems, but in current practice formal assessment infrequently
occurs and the provision of recommended treatment is extremely lim-
ited (Rehman et al., 2017; Reeve et al., 2019b). Yet there is a clear desire
for treatment: three-quarters of patients with psychosis who have in-
somnia would like treatment to improve their sleep (Freeman et al.,
2019).

In international guidelines the recommended ﬁrst line treatment for
insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBTi) (for example, National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2015; Qaseem et al., 2016;
Wilson et al., 2019). CBTi targets the subjective sleep disturbance
which characterises insomnia. It has a well-established evidence base
demonstrating effectiveness in treating insomnia (without comorbid
psychosis), for example a recent meta-analysis of 87 randomised con-
trolled trials (RCT) found large effect size improvements in self-
reported insomnia symptoms (hedges g = 0.98) (van Straten et al.,
2018). In recent years, researchers have begun to investigate the appli-
cability, feasibility, and effectiveness of CBTi in people with psychotic
experiences in the general population (Freeman et al., 2017), individ-
uals at ultra-high-risk of psychosis (Bradley et al., 2018, patients with
persistent psychotic experiences (e.g. Freeman et al., 2015; Hwang
et al., 2019; Chiu et al., 2018;) and patients admitted to acute psychiatric
inpatient care (Sheaves et al., 2018a). This review aims to provide an
overview of sleep disruption and its treatment across this spectrum of
psychosis severity. Given previous reviews on the occurrence of sleep
disruption and its contribution to psychotic experiences (see Cosgrave
et al., 2018; Davies et al., 2017; Reeve et al., 2015) the main focus of
this review will be on treatment developments in the past ﬁve years.
Consistent with treatment guidelines this review will focus on
evidence-based psychological interventions. By conducting a literature
review of the studies published in the last ﬁve years investigating
sleep disruption and psychotic experiences, we sought to address the
following questions:

1. What is the experience of sleep disruption and its treatment in pa-

tients experiencing psychotic symptoms?

2. Do subjective sleep disturbance and psychotic experiences co-occur

across this spectrum of psychosis severity?

3. Are psychological interventions for sleep disturbance (CBT) applicable,
feasible, and effective on a) subjective sleep problems, b) psychotic
experiences?

2. Method

A search was carried out on PubMed for English language papers
published in peer-reviewed journals containing the following terms:
((sleep OR insomnia OR dream* OR nightmare*) AND (Delus* OR
Hallucinat* OR Psychosis OR *Schizophren* OR Schizotyp*)), published
in the last ﬁve years (search conducted on 5th August 2019). Literature
on non-human studies was not included. The search criteria were con-
sistent with our earlier review (Reeve et al., 2015) to enable a focus
on recent ﬁndings.

Both qualitative and quantitative methodologies were included. Pa-
pers relating primarily to dementias or other neurological conditions,
bipolar disorder, or affective psychoses (including post-partum psycho-
sis) were excluded. Previous reviews were excluded. For quantitative
studies, a speciﬁc measure of subjective sleep disturbance was required.
There are elevated rates of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with psy-
chosis (24%) (see Annamalai et al., 2015) and an established respiratory
treatment, however this is outside the scope of this review.

This search revealed 789 papers. Titles and abstracts were scanned,
and if appropriate the whole paper, in order to ascertain the inclusion
and exclusion criteria. The reference lists of relevant papers were also
scanned for further citations, which provided an additional 11 papers.
See Fig. 1 for a PRISMA ﬂow diagram of the systematic review process.

3. Results

Fifty-eight papers were included in the review. Thirty-seven pa-
pers concerned clinical samples (8 ultra-high-risk, 3 ﬁrst-episode
psychosis, 22 schizophrenia, 4 acute inpatients) and 21 concerned
non-clinical samples. Within the clinical samples there were six
qualitative studies, ﬁve studies assessed the prevalence of sleep dis-
turbance, 20 studies provided correlational data, and six studies
evaluated psychological treatment. In the non-clinical studies, 18
studies provided correlational data, two were manipulation tests,
and one study concerned treatment.

3.1. The patient experience of sleep disruption and its treatment

“…because, the voices, and there's too many things on your mind and
you get anxious and stuff like that but it's...yeah, it is quite hard to get
to sleep, it's stressful.”(patient 15; Faulkner and Bee, 2017)

“When I'm tired it gets worse because I don't have the strength to ﬁght
the voices as much”. (patient 1; Waite et al., 2016a)

Across the spectrum of severity of psychosis there is a striking
consistency in patient accounts of the nature of sleep disturbance,
the interaction with psychotic experiences, the negative impact on
functioning, and treatment preference (Chiu et al., 2016; Faulkner
and Bee, 2017, 2016; Waite et al., 2016a; Waite et al., 2018; Waters
et al., 2015).

Patients describe how sleep can be disrupted by psychotic experi-
ences, for example: “if I'm having voices and stuff I ﬁnd it harder to
sleep, my mind's racing” (3, Chiu et al., 2016); “These voices like to
see me awake and agitated.” (13, Faulkner and Bee, 2017). Patients
also highlight the reverse: that sleep problems contribute to the occur-
rence of psychotic experiences. Indeed, patients describe the reciprocal
nature of sleep problems and psychotic experiences as a “nightmare you
can't get out of” (4, Waite et al., 2016a). Yet this also indicates a self-
identiﬁed avenue for improvement: "sometimes my voices would be
better as well from sleeping" (2, Waite et al., 2016a). In young people
at ultra-high-risk of psychosis, sleep disturbance was typically
characterised by disrupted sleep timing (Waite et al., 2018). In contrast,
patients with persistent psychotic experiences often described being re-
liant on hypnotic medication or using neuroleptic medication as a route
to initiate sleep: “knocking yourself out” (Faulkner and Bee, 2017, p.8).
Despite wanting better sleep, the accounts highlight a sense of hope-
lessness and limited expectation concerning treatment outcome. There
were often beliefs that sleep simply cannot be changed: “I just seem to
be at the mercy of it you know. I just don't really have any control
over it really. It's just sometimes it happens for me, and sometimes it
doesn't.” (5, Chiu et al., 2016). This sense of resignation was more pro-
found in patients with persistent psychosis, for example: “I know I'm
going to be like this forever, there's no point in telling a lie to myself, I
know I'll always have problems sleeping" (2, Faulkner and Bee, 2017).
Yet it was already present in many young people at ultra-high-risk of
psychosis when offered a sleep intervention: “I didn't think it would
work at ﬁrst” (8, Waite et al., 2018).

Those patients who had received a psychological sleep intervention
described important clinical change and valuing the therapy: “It was re-
ally, really good. Really good. I was really impressed. I didn't think it was
going to help or anything. I am really impressed” (10, Waite et al.,
2016a). For some, the process of implementing new strategies was chal-
lenging: “It's hard to try and change, to try and get myself motivated” (7,
Waite et al., 2018). Yet, for others, treating sleep problems was identi-
ﬁed as a route to improving wider mental health. With some patients
explicitly describing an improvement in psychotic symptoms with

improved sleep: “since I've been sleeping better, my, visual things have
like stopped” (8, Waite et al., 2018).

(Table 2) reporting an association between sleep disruption and psy-
chotic experiences.

3.2. The prevalence of sleep disturbance in patients

The patient accounts of sleep disturbance are consistent with the
empirical data. Rates of sleep disturbance are elevated across the spec-
trum of severity of psychotic experiences. Studies indicate that
75–80% of patients at ultra-high-risk (Poe et al., 2017), those who
have experienced a ﬁrst episode (Ma et al., 2018; Reeve et al., 2019b),
and patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (Laskemoen et al.,
2019) are experiencing subjective sleep disturbance. There were no
studies in the past ﬁve years reporting prevalence in acute settings.
When speciﬁc sleep disorders are assessed using self-report or clinician
interview measures the rate of insomnia is approximately 50%
(Freeman et al., 2019; Laskemoen et al., 2019), the rate of weekly night-
mares 55% (Sheaves et al., 2015), and the rate of hypersomnia 30%
(Laskemoen et al., 2019) in patients with non-affective psychosis.
Only one study has conducted formal diagnostic sleep interviews in pa-
tients with psychosis (Reeve et al., 2019b). In a sample of 60 patients
with early psychosis, insomnia (50%) and nightmares (48%) were the
most common disorders. Sleep disorders were not only highly prevalent
but frequently comorbid: the average number of sleep disorders per pa-
tient was 3.3 (Reeve et al., 2019b).

3.3. Sleep disturbance as a causal factor for psychotic experiences

3.3.1. Correlational data

Our previous review found a robust association between sleep dys-
function and psychotic experiences (Reeve et al., 2015), especially be-
tween insomnia and paranoia. The current review found 38 recent
studies: 18 general population (Table 1) and 20 clinical samples

3.3.1.1. General population studies. The ﬁndings from these recent studies
robustly conﬁrm the cross-sectional association between sleep dysfunc-
tion and psychotic experiences. For example, an analysis of data from
over a quarter of a million people in the general population found that
insomnia signiﬁcantly increased the likelihood of reporting at least
one psychotic symptom (OR = 2.41; 95% CI 2.18–2.65) (Koyanagi and
Stickley, 2015). In addition to the evidence for insomnia, an online
study with 846 participants from the general population found that,
even after controlling for PTSD and negative affect, both nightmare oc-
currence and severity were associated with hallucinatory experiences
and paranoia (Rek et al., 2017).

Several studies provide insight into the temporal relationship
using longitudinal and experience sampling method (ESM) designs.
For example, in a sample of 4720 young people, nightmares at age 12
predicted psychotic-like experiences (PLE) at age 18 (OR = 1.62,
95% CI 1.19–2.20) (Thompson et al., 2015). In an ESM study of 61 ad-
olescents, shorter sleep duration predicted paranoia, but paranoid
symptoms did not predict sleep parameters (Hennig and Lincoln,
2018).

Within correlational studies, a number of potential mechanisms
have been investigated. For example, an online study with 2678 stu-
dents found that depression and PTSD symptoms, but not anxiety symp-
toms, mediated the relationship between poor sleep and PLEs (Ered
et al., 2018). This study examined positive symptoms, but did not report
the ﬁndings for individual psychotic experiences. Structural equation
modelling of a sample of 348 students, recruited in an online study,
found an association between subjectively delayed sleep onset and per-
secutory ideation that was fully mediated by negative affect (Scott et al.,
2017). However there are obvious limitations of cross-sectional media-
tion analyses (see Maxwell and Cole, 2007). Mediation tests related to

Objective and subjective sleep measures interact to predict the
highest risk of psychotic experiences. The combination of perceived
poor sleep and actual lack of sleep predicts the greatest risk for
psychotic experiences.

The relationship between psychotic-like experiences and sleep quality
was mediated by symptoms of depression and PTSD, suggesting that
treating symptoms of depression and PTSD could improve multiple
domains of psychotic illness.
Shorter sleep duration and more dreaming predicted paranoid
symptoms, but paranoid symptoms did not signiﬁcantly predict sleep
parameters. Positive and negative affect partially mediate the effect of
sleep duration on paranoid symptoms.
There was a signiﬁcant positive association between quality of sleep
and hallucination proneness, dissociation and unusual sleep
experiences. Sleep quality and hallucination proneness was fully
mediated by dissociation and unusual sleep experiences.
Study 1: The relationship between sleep quality and paranoia was
partially mediate by alexithymia, perceptual anomalies and negative
affect.
Study 2: The relationship between sleep quality and paranoia was
fully mediated by negative affect, perceptual anomalies and
alexithymia.
Fragmented sleep, night anxiety and disturbed sleep all signiﬁcantly
correlated with psychotic-like experiences.

Paranoia predicted sleep dysfunction six months later, but not the
reverse.
When controlling for negative affect, nightmare occurrence was
associated with high levels of worry, depersonalisation, hallucinatory
experiences, paranoia, and sleep duration. Nightmare severity was
associated with higher levels of worry, depersonalisation,
hallucinatory experiences, and paranoia.

Insomnia was associated with hallucinations in both cross-sectional
datasets. Mild sleep problems were associated with 2–3 times greater
odds of reporting hallucinations, whilst chronic insomnia was
associated with four times greater odds. These associations remained
signiﬁcant, although with smaller odds ratios, after controlling for
depression, anxiety and paranoia.

Insomnia, nightmares, and circadian phase delay are associated with
increased subsyndromal psychiatric symptoms in young people. Each
is a treatable sleep disorder and might be a target for early
intervention to modify the subsequent progression of psychiatric
disorder.
People with insomnia taking sedative-hypnotic prescriptions had an
elevated risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to those
without insomnia or a sedative-hypnotic prescription.

Positive association between sleep
problems and attenuated psychotic
symptom severity. Sleep problems
closely associated with suspiciousness.
Depression mediated the cross-sectional
association between sleep problems and
paranoid symptoms only.

Association found between shorter sleep
duration and increased positive
symptoms, but not cognitive
disorganisation. Longitudinal
relationships did not remain signiﬁcant
when controlling for previous severity of
psychotic symptoms.
Insomnia found to be a signiﬁcant
predictor of paranoia persistence.

Self-reported sleep problems were
associated with impaired procedural
learning rate.
In CHR participants, circadian
disturbances were associated with
psychotic symptom severity and
predicted symptom severity and
psychosocial impairment at 1-year
follow-up.

Rates of sleep disturbance were
signiﬁcantly elevated in patients.
Sleep disturbance was associated with
increased positive and negative
symptoms and worse overall
functioning.

Patients displayed reduced efﬁciency,
disrupted continuity, and increased
movements during sleep compared to
HC. This behaviour was associated with
increased positive symptoms at baseline.

Poor subjective sleep quality predicted
elevated paranoia the following morning.
This relationship was fully mediated by
morning negative affect. No signiﬁcant
association between evening paranoia
and poor sleep the following night
emerged.

nightmares are lacking. However, negative affect and related processes
such as worry are candidate variables given their strong associations
with nightmare occurrence and severity (Rek et al., 2017).

3.3.1.2. Clinical studies. In patients at ultra-high-risk of psychosis, sleep
disruption has been associated with positive and negative symptoms
(Lunsford-Avery et al., 2015; Poe et al., 2017), disrupted cognitive func-
tioning (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2017), severity of psychotic experiences
such as hallucinations and delusions (Reeve et al., 2019a), and overall
functioning (Poe et al., 2017). In a large sample of 740 ultra-high-risk
patients, sleep disruption was positively correlated with attenuated
psychotic experiences, especially suspiciousness (Goines et al., 2019).
Depression mediated the association between sleep problems and
paranoia.

In patients with psychosis, sleep disturbance is associated with poor
clinical outcomes (Afonso et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2018; Hou et al.,
2017; Kilicaslan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017). For example, a naturalistic
longitudinal study of 388 patients found that insomnia was associated
with an increased risk of suicide attempts (Li et al., 2016). In the only
study speciﬁcally reporting correlational data in a ﬁrst-episode sample,
insomnia was associated with poorer outcomes on all four quality of life
domains assessed (Subramaniam et al., 2018).

Only two studies with patients with psychosis reported mediation
analyses (Kasanova et al., 2019; Reeve et al., 2018b). In a longitudinal
observational study of 29 patients with non-affective psychosis, insom-
nia predicted the persistence of psychotic experiences over time: a bidi-
rectional relationship was indicated between insomnia and paranoia
however insomnia was found to be a stronger predictor of later halluci-
nations than the reverse direction (Reeve et al., 2018b). Mediation
models were tested and found that negative affect (anxiety and depres-
sion) mediated the relationship between insomnia and psychotic expe-
riences. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of an ESM study, in which a
time-lagged mixed multilevel model was applied to distinguish the con-
tribution of poor sleep quality on morning paranoia, and evening para-
noid ideation on subsequent sleep quality (Kasanova et al., 2019). Poor
sleep quality predicted elevated paranoia, and this was fully mediated
by negative affect. However, no signiﬁcant association was found be-
tween evening paranoia and poor sleep quality.

3.3.2. Causal tests

When the amount of sleep is deliberately reduced in experimental ma-
nipulation studies, either via total sleep deprivation (Meyhöfer et al., 2017;
Petrovsky et al., 2014) or sleep restriction (Reeve et al., 2018a), it results in
increases in psychotic experiences. These studies have only been con-
ducted with non-clinical samples, but all three report sleep loss resulting
in increased perceptual distortions such as hallucinations. Reeve et al.,
2018a also found an increase in paranoia and cognitive disorganisation,
but no signiﬁcant changes in grandiosity. Mediation analyses revealed
that changes in psychotic experiences were mediated by changes in neg-
ative affect and related processes (including worry and negative self and
other cognitions), but not memory impairment. Together these manipula-
tion studies provide strong evidence that sleep disturbance is a contribu-
tory cause to paranoia and hallucinatory experiences.

3.4. Interventionist-casual tests

“It sorted out my sleep and I'm a better person for it.”(patient 10, Waite
et al., 2016a, p.187)

In the last ﬁve years, there have been six intervention studies
targeting insomnia and one targeting nightmares (Table 3). These stud-
ies have typically been designed to not only test whether sleep can be
improved but to ﬁnd out whether psychotic symptoms reduce (an
interventionist-causal approach, Kendler and Campbell, 2009). Most

studies have focused on patients with persistent psychotic symptoms
(n = 3 insomnia, n = 1 nightmares). There has been one study con-
ducted in an acute inpatient setting and one with young people at
ultra-high-risk of psychosis. However, the most robust ﬁnding is pro-
vided from a large RCT of university students with insomnia (n =
3755) (OASIS trial; Freeman et al., 2017).

The goal of the OASIS trial was to deﬁnitively test whether there is a
causal association between insomnia and paranoia and hallucinations
(Freeman et al., 2017). Students with self-reported insomnia were
randomised to receive either a digital CBTi intervention in addition to
usual care or usual care alone. Post-treatment, there were large effect
size reductions in insomnia (SCI cohen's d = 1.1) and small effect size
improvements in paranoia (GPTS-B d = 0.19) and hallucinations
(SPEQ-H d = 0.24) in the CBTi group compared with usual care. Those
who received the digital sleep treatment were less likely to meet ultra-
high-risk criteria (indicated by a score ≥ 6 on the 16-item prodromal
questionnaire) post treatment. Parallel analyses in the opposite direction
indicated that changes in psychotic experiences explained a much
smaller (approx. 3%) proportion of change in sleep. This study provides
the most deﬁnitive evidence to date that sleep treatment can improve
psychotic experiences and that insomnia is a contributory causal factor
in paranoia and hallucinations. A key limitation is that the study was
not in a clinical population.

In young people at ultra-high-risk, an uncontrolled feasibility case
series (SleepWell) with 12 participants (14–24 years) found large effect
size improvements in sleep (ISI d = 6.8) following an 8-session individ-
ual intervention (Bradley et al., 2018). The treatment included adapta-
tions to account for the developmental age of participants (for
example, including parents, incorporating technology) and the associ-
ated circadian phase shifts that occur during adolescence (for example,
adjusting expectations of sleep timing). Compared to baseline, the con-
ﬁdence intervals indicated improvements in paranoia (GPTS d = 0.6),
hallucinatory experiences (SPEQ-H d = 0.3), and negative affect
(DASS-21 depression d = 0.5) post-treatment, yet, as appropriate for
pilot studies, the p-values were not reported (for further statistical ra-
tionale see Lancaster et al., 2004). However, the quality of the evidence
is limited by the small sample size and lack of control group.

Three studies have evaluated CBTi interventions with patients with
persistent psychotic symptoms (two in outpatient settings and one in
a residential setting). The Better Sleep Trial (BeST; Freeman et al.,
2015) was an assessor-blind pilot randomised controlled trial with 50
patients with current psychotic symptoms. The manualised interven-
tion was delivered on an individual basis over eight sessions. Post-
treatment there were large effect size improvements in sleep: 41% of
patients in the intervention group no longer had clinical insomnia
(compared to 4% in the control group). However, the treatment effect
estimation for delusions (PSYRATS d = 0.1 CI −2.0 to 2.6) and halluci-
nations (PSYRATS d = 0.2, CI −65 to 2.7) included reducing or increas-
ing psychotic experiences. The study was underpowered to determine
with any precision the effect on psychotic experiences (which led to
the much larger OASIS trial). In addition to the clinical beneﬁts, a health
economic evaluation indicated that the sleep intervention may also be
cost-effective (Tsiachristas et al., 2018).

In an open label trial of adapted CBTi added to usual care, compared
to usual care alone, differential treatment outcomes were observed be-
tween different sleep presentations (Chiu et al., 2018). Latent class anal-
ysis was conducted on the 74 participants to identify three sleep
subtypes: classic severe insomnia (44.6%), insomnia with normal sleep
duration (37.8%), insomnia with hypersomnia (17.6%). The greatest
treatment beneﬁts were observed in the ﬁrst cluster. In the hypersomnia
cluster, total sleep time reduced and sleep onset latency was halved. A
blunted treatment response was reported in the normal sleep duration
cluster. However, there were comparable improvements in daytime
functioning and overall psychopathology.

Within a residential rehabilitation setting, a four-session CBTi group
intervention was evaluated in addition to usual care compared to usual

care alone (Hwang et al., 2019). This was a non-randomised, assessor
blind trial with 63 patients. No signiﬁcant changes in psychotic
symptoms, depression or anxiety were found, although the study
was underpowered. Signiﬁcant improvements in sleep were re-
ported post-treatment (4 weeks) and at follow-up (8 weeks). How-
ever, the effect sizes (ISI d = 0.8 at 8 weeks) were smaller than
those reported in the BeST trial (ISI d = 1.9 at 12 weeks). This
may indicate that longer treatment duration or individual rather
than a group format is important for achieving large treatment
effects.

In acute settings, an assessor-blind pilot RCT of a novel sleep in-
tervention has been conducted (Sheaves et al., 2018a). Eighteen
(45%) of the 40 participants, recruited from a single ward, had a di-
agnosis of non-affective psychosis. The intervention included CBTi,
sleep monitoring, and light/dark exposure for circadian entrain-
ment. In this acute setting the entire intervention was delivered in
2 weeks. Compared to usual care, there were large effect size reduc-
tions in insomnia (ISI d = 0.9) at post-treatment and follow-up
(12 weeks). This was the only intervention study to report the out-
come on negative symptoms: there was an indication of a small ef-
fect size improvement (d = 0.3), however the conﬁdence intervals
were wide, including zero, and so the ﬁndings are not conclusive.
Patients who received the sleep intervention were discharged on av-
erage 8.5 days earlier.

One pilot RCT has evaluated imagery rehearsal training (IRT) to
reduce nightmare severity in 24 patients with persecutory delusions
(Sheaves et al., 2019). In addition to IRT, the intervention included
CBT techniques to target identiﬁed causal factors for nightmares,
for example reducing worry and oversleeping. Large effect size im-
provements in nightmare severity (DDNSI d = 1.1) and insomnia
(SCI d = 1.4) were reported post-treatment (4-weeks) and main-
tained at follow-up (8-weeks). There was a medium effect size treat-
ment beneﬁt on paranoia favouring the CBT group at both 4 and
8 weeks. However, the conﬁdence intervals are wide, hence a larger
trial is required to estimate the effect with greater precision. There
was no effect of the treatment on hallucinations which ﬁts with the
understanding that psychotic experiences are distinct phenomena
with different causal factors (Peralta and Cuesta, 1999; Zavos et al.,
2014).

4. Discussion

There has been a sharp rise in the number of studies investigating
sleep disruption and psychosis: the number of quantitative investiga-
tions has doubled in the last ﬁve years. There are numerous correla-
tional studies, both in clinical and correlational studies, both in clinical
and non-clinical studies, often substantial, that robustly support the
co-occurrence of subjective sleep disruption and certain psychotic
experiences across the spectrum of psychosis severity. Yet the mecha-
nisms underpinning this relationship remain uncertain. Patient ac-
counts consistently highlight the importance and negative impact of
sleep problems and a desire for treatment. The principal advance has
been the evaluation of adapted CBT for sleep disorders in patients
with non-affective psychosis. The trials have generally been small, lim-
iting the ability to determine the effect of improving sleep on psychotic
experiences. Yet taken together an initial clinical picture forms: sleep
disturbance is a common and treatable problem across the spectrum
of psychosis severity that leads to small improvements in psychotic
symptoms such as paranoia and hallucinations. To date, the OASIS trial
(Freeman et al., 2017) provides the strongest test, showing that improv-
ing insomnia leads to improvements in paranoia and hallucinations.
However, studies have been inadequately powered to test this in clinical
populations.

There may be differences between how individual psychotic experi-
ences are linked to distinct sleep disorders. In a study of 5000 adolescent
twin pairs, the genetic and environmental inﬂuences of sleep disturbance

were found to overlap with those for paranoia, hallucinations, and cogni-
tive disorganisation but not grandiosity and anhedonia (Taylor et al.,
2015). In a robust experimental test of sleep restriction, negative affect
was found to mediate the relationship between sleep loss and paranoia
but not hallucinations (Reeve et al., 2018a). There are many plausible
mechanisms, both psychological and biological, one might expect to un-
derpin the association between sleep dysfunction and psychotic experi-
ences. The most consistent evidence, at a psychological level, is for the
role of negative affect mediating the association between insomnia and
psychotic experiences (principally paranoia) (Freeman et al., 2009,
2017; Kasanova et al., 2019; Reeve et al., 2015; Reeve et al., 2018a).
Other potential routes include alexithymia, and dissociation, which
could be further linked to adversity or trauma. Further work is needed
to understand the mechanisms linking hallucinations and insomnia.
Studies investigating the interaction of sleep problems with grandiosity,
cognitive distortion, or negative symptoms are rare. This review has fo-
cused on psychological models, as this is the framework underpinning
the ﬁrst-line recommended treatment (CBTi), yet neurodevelopmental
and neurochemical mechanisms are also plausible (Lunsford-Avery and
Mittal, 2013). For example, abnormalities in the interacting neurotrans-
mitter systems and neural circuits observed in sleep and circadian dis-
ruption are also implicated in the aetiology of psychosis (Wulff et al.,
2010). At the neurobiological level, overactivity of dopamine receptors
are implicated in both the causation of positive psychotic symptoms
and wakefulness (Monti and Monti, 2005). To date, we do not have
clear evidence to indicate the primary route.

Understanding the mechanistic links will help in the adaptation and
improvement of treatment, however it could be argued the key line of
research needed now is how to provide the best evidence-based treat-
ments for patients. Psychological interventions for sleep disturbance
are applicable, feasible, and demonstrate large effect size improvements
in insomnia and nightmares in patients with psychosis. This is consistent
with the evidence-base for these treatments in other mental health dis-
orders. The treatment is popular with patients with psychosis: the up-
take rate is strikingly high (80–100%) and qualitative data indicate that
patients value the opportunity to address sleep disturbance. The studies
reporting the largest effect sizes made adaptations to standard treatment
protocols. One key adaptation is the use of sleep restriction principles,
without applying the formal sleep restriction protocol. In practice, this
involves a degree of ﬂexibility, sharing the aims of the procedure to re-
duce time in bed not sleeping and careful negotiation to set a ‘sleep win-
dow’. This is particularly important given the experimental evidence for
the impact of sleep restriction in the occurrence of psychotic experiences
(Reeve et al., 2018a). Screening and evaluation of treatment progress can
be achieved using brief self-report measures (for example, Insomnia Se-
verity Index (Morin et al., 2011)) yet they are infrequently used in cur-
rent practice (Rehman et al., 2017). Treatment protocols outlining
adaptions for patients with psychosis have been produced (for example,
Sheaves et al., 2018b; Waite et al., 2016b; Waite and Sheaves, 2020;
Waters et al., 2017). The next challenge is implementation.
