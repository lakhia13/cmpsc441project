Abstract

  OBJECTIVE—To conduct a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Early 
Start Denver Model (ESDM), a comprehensive developmental behavioral intervention, for 
improving outcomes of toddlers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

  METHODS—Forty-eight children diagnosed with ASD between 18 and 30 months of age were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) ESDM intervention, which is based on developmental and 
applied behavioral analytic principles and delivered by trained therapists and parents for 2 years; 
or (2) referral to community providers for intervention commonly available in the community.

  RESULTS—Compared with children who received community-intervention, children who 
received ESDM showed significant improvements in IQ, adaptive behavior, and autism diagnosis. 
Two years after entering intervention, the ESDM group on average improved 17.6 standard score 
points (1 SD:15 points) compared with 7.0 points in the comparison group relative to baseline 
scores. The ESDM group maintained its rate of grow thin adaptive behavior compared with a 
normative sample of typically developing children. In contrast, over the 2-year span, the 
comparison group showed greater delays in adaptive behavior. Children who received ESDM also

were more likely to experience a change in diagnosis from autism to pervasive developmental 
disorder, not otherwise specified, than the comparison group.

  CONCLUSIONS—This is the first randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of 
a comprehensive developmental behavioral intervention for toddlers with ASD for improving 
cognitive and adaptive behavior and reducing severity of ASD diagnosis. Results of this study 
underscore the importance of early detection of and intervention in autism.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social reciprocity and 
communication, and stereotyped and repetitive behaviors, with onset during early childhood. 
Intellectual disability is present in a large proportion of individuals.1 With a prevalence of 1 
per 150,2 autism costs the United States $35 billion per year.3 The lifetime per-capita 
societal cost of autism is $3.2 million, with lost productivity and adult care among the 
largest costs.4 Thus, early-intervention methods that can improve outcome for individuals 
with ASD are of high importance.

The 1987 report by Lovaas5 of an early behavioral intervention that resulted in 49% of 
children in the study being mainstreamed into regular classrooms and showing significant IQ 
gains created a groundswell of interest among parents and professionals in early intervention 
and raised questions about early plasticity in children with autism.6 Although subsequent 
intervention studies, including a randomized, controlled trial,7 have documented 
improvements in IQ for a subgroup of children, questions regarding the efficacy of early 
intervention have remained. Many of the studies lacked methodologic rigor. Authors of a 
recent meta-analysis of the efficacy of early behavioral intervention argued that stronger 
evidence that early behavioral intervention results in better outcomes than standard care is 
still needed.8

Our study was a randomized, controlled trial of early intensive behavioral intervention for 
young children with ASD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (Dr 
Dawson, principal investigator). It was hypothesized that the early intervention would result 
in significant improvements in cognitive abilities of young children with ASD. The study 
differed from previous ones in several ways. First, we maintained a high level of 
methodologic rigor, including gold-standard diagnostic criteria, randomization, 
comprehensive outcome measures conducted by naive examiners, high retention rates, and 
measures of fidelity of implementation of a manualized intervention.

Second, to our knowledge, our study is the first randomized, controlled trial of intervention 
for toddlers with autism; all children were younger than 30 months at entry. Given the recent 
recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics that 18-month-old children be 
screened for ASD,9 it is imperative that the efficacy of early-intervention models appropriate 
for toddlers with ASD be demonstrated.

Third, the intervention, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM),10 is a comprehensive early 
behavioral intervention for infants to preschool-aged children with ASD that integrates 
applied behavior analysis (ABA) with developmental and relationship-based approaches. 
The ESDM was designed to address the needs of toddlers with ASD as young as 12 months. 
The intervention is provided in a toddler’s natural environment (the home) and is delivered 
by trained therapists and parents. In our study, children received structured intervention at 
high intensity, consistent with the National Research Council’s recommendation.11

  PATIENTS AND METHODS

  Study Procedures

Forty-eight children between 18 and 30 months of age diagnosed with autistic disorder or 
pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), not otherwise specified (NOS), were randomly 
assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) the ESDM group received yearly assessments, 20 hours/ week 
of the ESDM intervention from University of Washington clinicians, parent training, and 
parent delivery for 5 or more hours/week of ESDM, in addition to whatever community 
services the parents chose; and (2) the assess-and-monitor (A/M) group received yearly 
assessments with intervention recommendations and referrals for intervention from 
commonly available community providers in the greater Seattle region.

Children were evaluated by experienced examiners naive to intervention status at baseline 
(preintervention), 1 year after onset of the intervention, and at either 2 years after onset of 
the intervention or at 48 months of age, whichever yielded a longer time frame.

  Participants

Participants were recruited through pediatric practices, Birth to Three centers, preschools, 
hospitals, and state and local autism organizations. Exclusion criteria included (1) a 
neurodevelopmental disorder of known etiology (eg, fragile X syndrome), (2) significant 
sensory or motor impairment, (3) major physical problems such as a chronic serious health 
condition, (4) seizures at time of entry, (5) use of psychoactive medications, (6) history of a 
serious head injury and/or neurologic disease, (7) alcohol or drug exposure during the 
prenatal period, and (8) ratio IQ below 35 as measured by mean age equivalence score/
chronological age on the visual reception and fine motor subscales of the Mullen Scales of 
Early Learning (MSEL).12 Children who developed seizures during the course of the study 
were not excluded. Inclusion criteria included age below 30 months at entry, meeting criteria 
for autistic disorder on the Toddler Autism Diagnostic Interview,13 meeting criteria for 
autism or ASD on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,14 and a clinical diagnosis 
based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) 
criteria15 using all available information, residing within 30 minutes of the University of 
Washington, and willingness to participate in a ≥2-year intervention. At baseline, 18 children 
in the A/M group and 21 in the ESDM group received a DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic 
disorder. Six children in the A/M group and 3 in the ESDM group received a diagnosis of 
PDD NOS. This difference was not significant (Fisher’s exact test, P = .231). The ethnicities 
involved were Asian (12.5%), white (72.9%), Latino (12.5%), and multiracial (14.6%). The 
male-to-female ratio reflected the expected ratio in ASD of 3.5:1.

Retention rates were 100% (1-year) and 100% (2-year) for the ESDM group and 96% (1-
year) and 88% (2-year) for the A/M group, which yielded a sample size of 24 in the ESDM 
and 21 in the A/M group at outcome. Figure 1 shows the participant flowchart.

  Measures

  Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised—The toddler version of the Autism 
Diagnostic Interview–Revised13 is a semi-structured parent interview that assesses autism 
symptoms across 3 domains: social relatedness; communication; and repetitive, restricted 
behaviors.

  Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule—The Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule (ADOS), WPS version,14 is a semistructured standardized observation that 
measures autism symptoms in social relatedness, communication, play, and repetitive 
behaviors. A standardized severity score based on codes within these domains can be 
calculated to compare autism symptoms across modules.16

  Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)—The MSEL12 are a standardized 
developmental test for children from birth to 68 months of age. Four of the 5 subscales were 
administered: fine motor, visual reception, expressive language, and receptive language. T 
scores for subscales have a mean of 50 (SD: 10). The early-learning composite score is a 
standard score with mean of 100 (SD: 15).

  Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales—The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales 
(VABS)17 are a parent interview that assesses social, communication, motor, and daily living 
skills. They provide age-equivalent and standard scores for several subscales, including 
expressive and receptive language and social adaptive functioning.

  Repetitive Behavior Scale—The Repetitive Behavior Scale (RBS)18 is a parent 
questionnaire that characterizes the severity of repetitive behaviors, yielding 6 subdomain 
scores (eg, sameness, self-injurious behavior) and a total score.

  Randomization

Participants were stratified into 2 groups on the basis of composite IQ at entry (<55 and 55) 
and gender to ensure comparable IQ and gender ratios between groups. Within each of these 
strata, randomization was conducted by using random permuted blocks of 4. The 
intervention groups did not differ at baseline in severity of autism symptoms based on 
ADOS scores, chronological age, IQ, gender, or adaptive behaviors (see Table 1).

Intervention Groups

  ESDM Group—The ESDM group was provided with intervention by trained therapists 
for 2-hour sessions, twice per day, 5 days/ week, for 2 years. A detailed intervention manual 
and curriculum were used.19 One or both parents were provided with parent training from 
the primary therapist during semimonthly meetings, during which the principles and specific 
techniques of ESDM were taught. Parents were asked to use ESDM strategies during daily 
activities and to keep track of the number of hours during which they used these strategies.

ESDM uses teaching strategies that involve interpersonal exchange and positive affect, 
shared engagement with real-life materials and activities, adult responsivity and sensitivity 
to child cues, and focus on verbal and nonverbal communication, based on a 
developmentally informed curriculum that addresses all developmental domains. Teaching 
strategies are consistent with the principles of ABA, such as the use of operant conditioning, 
shaping, and chaining. Each child’s plan is individualized. There is a strong parent-family 
role responsive to each family’s unique characteristics. Parents are taught the basic ESDM 
strategies and asked to use them during everyday activities such as feeding, bath time, and 
play. Parents chose teaching objectives from the curriculum that they viewed as high priority.

Intervention programs were supervised by a graduate-level, trained lead therapist who had a 
minimum of 5 years’ experience providing early intervention to young children with autism, 
with ongoing consultation from a clinical psychologist, speech-language pathologist, and 
developmental behavioral pediatrician. An occupational therapist provided consultation as 
needed. Intervention objectives and strategies were reviewed, and the intervention was 
observed at least biweekly by the lead therapist and every 3 months by the speech-language 
pathologist. Intervention was delivered by therapists who typically held a baccalaureate 
degree, received 2 months of training by the lead therapist, and met weekly with the lead 
therapist. Therapists were trained to competence, defined as completing course-work, 
passing tests, mastering the intervention, demonstrating fidelity of 85% of maximum scores 
on the fidelity instrument, and maintaining ongoing fidelity.20

ESDM intervention hours were systematically recorded. Although 20 therapist-delivered 
intervention hours per week were made available, the actual mean was 15.2 hours (SD: 1.4) 
because of illnesses, vacations, and so on. Parents reported spending an average of 16.3 
hours/week (SD: 6.2) using ESDM strategies. The ESDM group reported an average of 5.2 
hours/week (SD: 2.1) in other therapies (eg, speech therapy, developmental preschool) over 
the study enrollment period. Other therapies were documented by using an intervention 
history interview administered every 6 months.

  A/M Group—Children who were randomly assigned to the A/M group received 
comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, intervention recommendations, and community 
referrals at baseline and again at each of the 2 follow-up assessments. Families were given 
resource manuals and reading materials at baseline and twice yearly throughout the study. 
The A/M group reported an average of 9.1 hours of individual therapy and an average of 9.3 
hours/week of group interventions (eg, developmental pre-school) across the 2-year period 
during which the intervention study was conducted. In the greater Seattle area, there are a 
number of Birth to Three centers that provide interventions, speech and language therapy, 
and occupational therapy. Developmental preschool programs vary but typically include 
special education and related services. There are a number of private ABA providers in the 
community.

  Data Analysis

The effect of ESDM intervention was assessed by using repeated-measures analysis of 
variance, with a priori contrasts that compared baseline scores with 1- and 2-year outcome

scores. The primary outcome measures were the MSEL composite standard score and the 
VABS composite standard score. Secondary outcome measures were the ADOS severity 
score,16 the RBS,18 MSEL, and VABS subscale scores, and changes in diagnostic status 
(autistic disorder, PDD NOS, and no diagnosis).

  RESULTS

No serious adverse effects related to the intervention were reported during the 2-year period.

  1-Year Outcome

Table 2 displays statistics for 1- and 2-year outcomes, change scores relative to baseline, and 
group comparisons for primary and secondary measures. Significant intervention effects 
were found for cognitive ability after 1 year on the MSEL composite standard scores. The 
ESDM group demonstrated an average IQ increase of 15.4 points (>1 SD) compared with an 
increase of 4.4 points in the A/M group. The visual reception subscale was the only 
individual subscale on the MSEL on which the groups significantly differed at the 1-year 
outcome. The ESDM group gained 5.6 T-score points, whereas the A/M group declined 1.7 
points. The ESDM group improved 17.8 points on receptive language compared with a 9.8-
point improvement in the A/M group, a difference that fell just short of statistical 
significance.

As a whole, children gained raw score points in the daily living skills subscale of the VABS; 
however, progress was much slower in relation to the VABS normative sample between 
baseline and 1 year. The groups did not differ in terms of adaptive behavior, measured by the 
VABS composite standard score, after 1 year (the ESDM group showed a 3.8-point decline, 
and the A/M group showed a 6.3-point decline). The groups did not differ in terms of their 
ADOS severity scores or RBS total score after 1 year of intervention.

  2-Year Outcome

Two years after the baseline assessment, the ESDM group showed significantly improved 
cognitive ability, measured by MSEL composite standard scores, which increased 17.6 
points compared with 7.0 points in the A/M group. The bulk of this change seems to have 
been a result of receptive and expressive language, which showed increases of 18.9 and 12.1 
points, respectively, for the ESDM group, whereas the A/M group improved 10.2 and 4.0 
points, respectively.

The ESDM and A/M groups significantly differed in terms of their adaptive behavior as 
measured by the VABS composite standard scores at the 2-year outcome (see Fig 2). The 
ESDM group showed similar standard scores at the 1- and 2-year outcomes, indicating a 
steady rate of development, whereas the A/M group, on average, showed an 11.2-point 
average decline. Thus, the A/M group’s delays in overall adaptive behavior became greater 
when compared with the normative sample. The A/M group showed average declines in 
standard scores that were twice as great as those in the ESDM group in the domains of 
socialization, daily living skills, and motor skills. The groups did not differ in terms of their 
ADOS severity scores or RBS total score after 2 years of intervention.

  Diagnosis

Page 7

At baseline, the diagnoses in each group were not significantly different (Fisher’s exact test, 
P =.461) and were distributed as follows: ESDM, 21 with autistic disorder and 3 with PDD 
NOS; A/M, 18 with autistic disorder and 6 with PDD NOS. At the 2-year outcome, 15 
(62.5%) children in the ESDM group had the same diagnosis (14 with autistic disorder, 1 
with PDD NOS) and 15 (71.4%) children in the A/M group had the same diagnosis (all 15 
with autistic disorder). Diagnosis improved (baseline autistic disorder to PDD NOS at year 
2) for 7 (29.2%) children in the ESDM group but for only 1 (4.8%) child in the A/M group. 
However, the diagnosis changed from PDD NOS at baseline to autistic disorder at year 2 for 
2 (8.3%) children in the ESDM group and 5 (23.8%) children in the A/M group. Thus, 
children who received ESDM were significantly more likely to have improved diagnostic 
status at the 2-year outcome compared with children in the A/M group, as assessed by using 
Fisher’s exact test 2 (intervention groups) × 2 (improved versus worsened diagnosis) 
contingency table (P = .041). Fisher’s exact test for the 2 (intervention groups) × 3 
(diagnostic change: no change versus improved versus worsened diagnosis) contingency 
table was just short of significance (P = .060).

  DISCUSSION

Recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics9 that all children be screened for 
autism at 18 months of age oblige the development of interventions that are appropriate for 
toddlers with ASD. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of an 
intensive intervention designed for toddlers with ASD as young as 12 months of age. After 2 
years of intervention, children provided with the ESDM19 showed significant improvements 
in IQ, adaptive behavior, and diagnostic status compared with children who received 
community interventions. Consistent evidence of improvement in communicative abilities in 
the ESDM group was found, as demonstrated by gains in receptive and expressive language 
scores on the MSEL subscales and the VABS communication subscale. Significant 
improvement for the ESDM group was found for overall adaptive behavior, communication, 
daily living skills, and motor skills. Specifically, the ESDM group, although still 
significantly delayed in adaptive behavior, was able to keep pace with the rate of change of 
the VABS normative sample, whereas the community-based intervention group continued to 
fall farther behind in adaptive behavior. Given the importance of adaptive behavior for 
everyday functioning at home and school, the fact that the ESDM group did not continue to 
fall farther behind is likely to affect ability to function in less-restrictive environments. This 
demonstrates that the ESDM intervention accelerates overall development and is 
generalizing to everyday life. Whereas 71% of the children in the group that received 
community-based intervention retained their diagnosis of autistic disorder over the 2-year 
period, only 56% of children in the ESDM group did so. The diagnosis of 7 children (30%) 
in the ESDM group changed from autistic disorder to PDD NOS, whereas this only occurred 
for 1 child (5%) in the community-intervention group. These diagnostic assessments were 
conducted by experienced clinicians who were naive with respect to intervention-group 
status. However, this change in diagnostic severity was not reflected in significant 
differences in the ADOS severity scores. This lack of correspondence between measures is 
difficult to interpret, because the child’s performance in the ADOS contributes to clinical

diagnosis. However, other behaviors, including parental report, also contribute to overall 
clinical diagnosis. The repetitive-behavior scores also did not change over time in either 
group.

  CONCLUSIONS

The outcomes of this study, which involve an increase in IQ scores of 17 points (>1 SD) and 
significant gains in language and adaptive behavior, compare favorably with other controlled 
studies of intensive early intervention (eg, Smith et al [2000],7 which delivered discrete trial 
intervention for >2 years for 25–40 hours/week). The group differences reported from our 
study are larger than those produced by other comparative trials of developmental behavioral 
approaches, which were conducted for briefer periods of time and with fewer hours of 
delivery per week.21,22 Whether the children will sustain their gains over a longer term is an 
important question that will require follow-up study.

The results of this study suggest that the ESDM model,19 an intervention approach that uses 
teaching strategies of ABA that are delivered within an affectively rich, relationship-focused 
context, can be effective for improving outcomes of young children with autism. Parents’ 
use of these strategies at home during their daily activities likely was an important ingredient 
of its success.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT

Previous studies on the efficacy of early behavioral intervention for improving outcomes 
for preschool-aged children with autism have yielded promising results. However, no 
randomized clinical trials of early developmental behavioral intervention designed for 
toddlers with autism have been conducted to date.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

This study assessed the efficacy of the Early Start Denver Model, a comprehensive 
developmental behavioral intervention, for improving outcomes of toddlers with ASD. 
The intervention, which was initiated when children were less than 2½ years, resulted in 
significant improvements in IQ, language, adaptive behavior, and autism diagnosis.
