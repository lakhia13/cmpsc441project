50% of mental illnessbeginsby age 14and 3/4 beginsby age 24*

Major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder rarely appear “out of the blue.” Most often family, friends, teachers or individuals themselves begin to recognize small changes or a feeling that “something is not quite right” about their thinking, feelings or behavior before an illness appears in its full-blown form.

Learning about developing symptoms, or early warning signs, and taking action can help one take action to ensure prompt treatment. Early intervention can help REDUCE mental illness’ effect on the quality of life. It may even reduce the severity of an illness and possibly delay or prevent a major mental illness altogether!


## Signs and Symptoms


If several of the following are occurring, it may useful to follow up with a mental health professional.

- Sleep or appetite changes —Dramatic sleep and appetite changes.

- Decline in personal care – Difficulty caring for oneself including bathing.

- Mood changes —Rapid or dramatic shifts in emotions or depressed feelings, greater irritability.

- Withdrawal —Recent social withdrawal and loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed.

- Body Pain–Difficulty managing pain such as stomach aches or headaches

- Problems thinking —Problems with concentration, memory or logical thought and speech that are hard to explain.

- Apathy —Loss of initiative or desire to participate in any activity.

- Illogical thinking —Unusual or exaggerated beliefs about personal powers to understand meanings or influence events; illogical or “magical” thinking typical of childhood in an adult.

One or two of these symptoms alone can’t predict a mental illness but may indicate a need for further evaluation. If a person is experiencing several at one time and the symptoms are causing serious problems in the ability to study, work or relate to others, he/she should be seen by a physician or mental health professional. People with suicidal thoughts or intent, or thoughts of harming others, need immediate attention.


## Taking Action, Getting Help


More than a decade of research around the world has shown that early intervention can often minimize or delay symptoms, prevent hospitalization and improve prognosis. Even if a person does not yet show clear signs of a diagnosable mental illness, these “red flag” early warning symptoms can be frightening and disruptive.

Just as with other medical illnesses, early intervention can make a crucial difference in preventing what could become a serious illness.

Encourage the person to:

- Use self help approachesGratitude and positive thinkingExerciseMaking connection with othersStress management strategies

- Gratitude and positive thinking

- Making connection with others

- Stress management strategies

- Receive supportive counseling

- Have an evaluationby a mental health or other health care professional.

- Learn about mental illness, including signs and symptoms.

- Be monitored closely for conditionsrequiring more intensive care.

Recognize that stigma may pose a significant barrier to seeking help.

Each individual’s situation must be assessed carefully and treatment should be individualized. Comprehensive treatment to prevent early symptoms from progressing into serious illness can include ongoing individual and family counseling, vocational and educational support, participation in a multi-family problem-solving group, and medication when appropriate.

The people in the individual’s life are very important and can be seen as partners. Family members are valued partners, as are teachers, coaches, and religious figures. Learning about mental illness can help individuals, families and community members understand the significance of symptoms, how an illness might develop, and what can be done to help.
