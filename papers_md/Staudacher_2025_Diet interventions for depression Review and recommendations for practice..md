Abstract

Objective: this paper aims to present the evidence for the role of diet in the prevention and treatment of depression, 
review the potential underlying mechanisms and provide practice recommendations for mental health clinicians. 

Methods: A literature review was conducted through searches of PubMed with the search terms ‘depression’, ‘diet’,  
‘prevention’,  ‘treatment’ and ‘mechanisms’ and combinations thereof. Additional articles were identified through hand 
searching. 

Results: Greater adherence to several healthy dietary patterns, traditional diets such as the Mediterranean diet and 
other  diets  such  as  the  DASH  diet  are  associated  with  or  can  treat  symptoms  of  depression.  Several  limitations  of 
the research were noted, many of which relate to inherent challenges of studying diet. Mechanisms by which dietary 
intervention  can  influence  mood  include  the  gut  microbiome,  modulation  of  inflammatory  processes,  reduction  in 
oxidative stress and modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Recommendations for mental health 
clinicians to enable translation of the evidence into practice are provided. 

Conclusion: Diet can play an important role in preventing and treating depression. Mental health clinicians are well 
placed to provide dietary counselling and to use clinical judgement in choosing the specific approach that reflects the 
needs of the patient but are encouraged to refer to a specialist dietitian where necessary.

Introduction

Growing evidence indicates diet can play an important role 
in the prevention and/or treatment of depression. The exact 
interplay of mechanisms by which diet can influence mood 
is  unclear;  however,  the  gut  microbiome  is  probably 
involved. Here, we describe the diets and dietary patterns 
that have been evaluated in research, discuss the range of 
mechanisms  potentially  underlying  their  effect  and  criti-
cally  evaluate  the  studies  that  test  the  effects  of  dietary 
interventions on mental health symptoms. Finally, we pro-
vide recommendations for mental health clinicians to ena-
ble translation of the evidence into practice.

Data presented for the healthy diet is based on national dietary guidelines for the United Kingdom (British Nutrition Foundation, 2015), the United 
States (US Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2020) and Australia (AUS), for the Mediterranean diet from the seminal PREDIMED trial (Estruch 
et al., 2013), for the DASH diet as outlined in the dietary guidelines for the United States (USDA, 2020). Recommended food group servings vary 
for a healthy diet based on nutrient needs based on age, gender, activity level and weight. Portion sizes varied across all three diets (e.g. one serve 
fruit = 80 g fresh fruit in the United States, 150 g or one medium piece in AUS).

Healthy diet pattern

A ‘healthy’ diet typically aligns with national dietary guide-
lines. These guidelines are founded on scientific evidence 
about nutrients essential to health, based on intake required 
to prevent nutritional deficiency and reduce risk of chronic 
disease,  and  are  targeted  to  healthy  individuals  and  those 
with  common  health  conditions  (e.g.  overweight)  but  not 
for people requiring dietary advice for a specific medical 
condition. Although  there  are  variations  in  the  guidelines 
across countries, the universal messages are inclusion of a 
wide variety of vegetables, fruit, wholegrains and legumes 
and reduction in intake of foods high in saturated fat, added 
salt or added sugar (Herforth et al., 2019).

In the research context, the ‘healthiness’ of a person’s 
diet is often rated using a diet quality index (e.g. Healthy 
Eating Index), which is validated in the target population 
(Reedy  et al.,  2018).  The  diet  quality  score  is  usually 
computed based on dietary data collected using a food fre-
quency questionnaire or diet record. Diet quality compo-
nent  scores  are  calculated,  which  are  then  summed  to  a 
total score with a higher score representing a higher qual-
ity diet. In practice, diet quality tests are available online 
and may be useful for mental health clinicians for screen-
ing  individual’s  diets  (University  of  Newcastle,  2021; 
Commonwealth  Scientific  and 
Industrial  Research 
Organisation [CSIRO], 2021).

The Mediterranean diet and other 
traditional diets

The Mediterranean diet is an extensively researched tradi-
tional  dietary  pattern  shown  to  have  wide-ranging  health 
benefits  including  a  reduced  risk  for  non-communicable 
diseases  (e.g.  cardiovascular  disease,  neurodegenerative 
diseases, cancer and diabetes) (Dinu et al., 2018; Martinez-
Lacoba  et al.,  2018).  The  dietary  pattern  originated  from 
nations  in  the  Mediterranean  regions  including  Greece, 
Cyprus, Spain and Southern Italy and, as a result, there are 
several variants based on the local food availability, prefer-
ences,  and  culture  within  each  region  (Trichopoulou  and 
Lagiou,  1997).  The  traditional  Cretan  Mediterranean  diet 
was the first diet variant to be established as protective for 
health  and  formed  the  basis  for  the  principles  of  a  tradi-
tional  Mediterranean  diet.  The  diet  is  characterised  by  a 
high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruit, wholegrains, nuts 
and seeds, a moderate-to-high intake of fish, a low intake of 
meat,  olive  oil  as  the  principal  source  of  added  fat,  and 
moderate consumption of wine with meals.

Other  behavioural  and  lifestyle  recommendations  are 
central  to  the  Mediterranean  approach,  including  eating 
slowly without distraction, cooking at home, sharing meals 
with others, incorporating seasonal and local produce and 
including  regular  physical  activity  (Fundación  Dieta 
the 
Mediterránea,  2022).  Successful  adoption  of

Mediterranean  diet  to  non-Mediterranean  populations  is 
possible,  and  studies  report  take  up  of  the  diet  into  non-
Mediterranean communities using an intensive dietitian-led 
approach 
incorporating  regular  support  and  written 
resources (Murphy et al., 2022). Challenges such as acces-
sibility  to  Mediterranean  foods,  cultural  barriers,  religion 
and cost may be prohibitive of adoption and/or long-term 
adherence in some individuals. While cultural adaptation of 
the Mediterranean diet may enhance adherence at a popula-
tion level, it is unknown if a modified Mediterranean diet 
approach leads to disease prevention to the same extent as 
a traditional approach.

A range of validated scores have been used to measure 
adherence to a Mediterranean diet in the published litera-
ture. Several scoring systems are recommended for use in 
research and practice (Hutchins-Wiese et al., 2021), which 
include  relatively  brief  validated  questionnaires  such  as 
the  MDSS  (Monteagudo  et al.,  2015)  and  the  MEDAS 
(Schröder et al., 2011).

Other traditional dietary patterns with growing evidence 
for  health  benefits  include  the  Nordic  diet,  traditional 
Brazilian  diet  and  traditional  Japanese  diet/Okinawa  diet. 
The Nordic diet has similar ‘plant-based’ principles to the 
Mediterranean  diet  but  encourages  rapeseed  (canola)  oil 
instead of olive oil. The traditional Brazilian diet has soy or 
corn oil as the predominant oil and includes rice and beans 
in main meals, with small portions of red meat. The tradi-
tional Japanese diet is rich in rice, vegetables, soy products 
(e.g. soybeans and tofu), seafoods and fermented products 
such as miso and nattō.

DASH diet

The  DASH  diet  refers  to  ‘Dietary  approaches  to  Stop 
Hypertension’.  The  DASH  diet  is  a  healthy  diet  pattern 
originally developed for the treatment of hypertension and 
has demonstrated benefits for reducing the risk of cardio-
vascular disease (Chiavaroli et al., 2019). It encourages low 
salt intake and increased intake of foods rich in potassium, 
calcium  and  magnesium  and  emphasises  intake  of  fruit, 
vegetables, wholegrains, nuts, seeds, legumes, low or no fat 
dairy products and lean meat.

Anti-inflammatory diet

Many  chronic,  non-communicable  diseases,  including 
depression, are associated with chronic systemic inflamma-
tion.  The  exploration  of  known  sources  of  inflammation 
including psychosocial stress, poor diet and physical inac-
tivity, suggest that inflammation at least partly mediates the 
path  for  risk  and  progression  of  these  chronic  diseases 
(Berk  et al.,  2013).  Intake  of  a  range  of  specific  foods, 
nutrients and dietary constituents have been associated with 
lower  levels  of  systemic  inflammatory  markers  and  have 
been described as having anti-inflammatory potential. For 

example, some studies show adherence to a Mediterranean-
style  diet,  vegetarian/vegan  and  DASH  diet  have  been 
associated  with  lower  levels  of  systemic  inflammation 
(Koelman  et al.,  2022).  Conversely,  increased  intake  of 
foods  and  nutrients  characteristic  of  a  Western-style  diet, 
including foods high in sugar or saturated fat, can increase 
inflammatory  markers  (Christ  et al.,  2019).  The  Dietary 
inflammation  Index  (DII)  is  a  literature-derived  tool  that 
attempts  to  encapsulate  these  disparate  data  (Shivappa 
et al., 2014). Scores are calculated based on intake of die-
tary components that negatively and positively contribute 
to  the  inflammation  score.  Dietary  components  that  con-
tribute positively to the total score include fat and carbohy-
drate,  bioactive  components  such  as  flavanols,  and  foods 
such as ginger, garlic and onion.

Mechanisms: how could diet 
influence depression?

The relationship between diet and mental health is multi-
faceted  and  complex.  Studies  examining  the  underlying 
mechanisms are still limited and much of the mechanistic 
research has been conducted in animal models or restricted 
to  the  examination  of  specific  dietary  components  (e.g., 
micronutrients) and their impact on human health. However, 
there  are  several  strong  candidate  mechanisms  through 
which diet influences mental health.

Gut microbiome

The community of microorganisms within the gastrointes-
tinal  tract,  known  as  the  gut  microbiome,  is  critical  to 
human  health.  In  particular,  the  gut  microbiome  plays  an 
important role in human digestion, nutrient extraction and, 
throughout this process, direct production or stimulation of 
production of bioactive metabolites (Rowland et al., 2018). 
These  include  short-chain  fatty  acids  (SCFAs),  vitamins 
and several neuromodulators (e.g. serotonin, gamma-amin-
obutyric  acid,  catecholamines  and  acetylcholine;  Wiley 
et al., 2020). Microbial production of neuroactive metabo-
lites represents just one pathway in the complex set of bidi-
rectional lines of communication between the microbiome 
and  the  brain,  known  as  the  microbiome-gut-brain  axis, 
which includes the vagus nerve, intestinal barrier and the 
immune system (Figure 1).

Many studies have demonstrated that the microbiome is 
altered  in  individuals  with  clinical  depression,  and  some 
show  abundances  of  certain  microbiome  members  (or 
‘taxa’) are correlated with symptom severity (McGuinness 
et al.,  2022;  Simpson  et al.,  2021).  For  example,  there  is 
consistent upregulation of several taxa with inflammatory 
properties, such as the opportunistic pathogen Eggerthella 
(McGuinness et al., 2022; Nikolova et al., 2021; Simpson 
et al., 2021). Other studies identify downregulation of taxa 
with  anti-inflammatory  properties  or  SCFA-producing

capabilities in anxiety and depression (McGuinness et al., 
2022; Nikolova et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2021). SCFAs, 
such as butyrate, are produced through microbial fermenta-
tion of indigestible carbohydrates (i.e. dietary fibre) and are 
involved  in  a  range  of  pathways  within  the  microbiome–
gut–brain  axis,  including  modulation  of  intestinal  barrier 
and immune function (O’Riordan et al., 2022).

The microbiome is highly responsive to changes in diet. 
In animal studies, whole diet interventions, macronutrient 
and micronutrient supplementation have led to changes in 
both  the  microbiome  and  behavioural  outcomes  (Bear 
et al., 2020). supporting the idea that the microbiome may 
mediate diet-induced changes in behaviour. While studies 
of extreme diet alteration in humans are relatively scarce, 
significant changes in the microbiome are possible within a 
single  day  (David  et al.,  2014).  Mediterranean  diet  inter-
ventions have had limited success in shifting the microbi-
ome, however this may be partly explained by inconsistent 
diet adherence and variability in baseline microbiome pro-
file (Kimble et al., 2023). A 3-month randomised controlled 
trial (RCT) in 106 people with obesity found 16 g/d prebi-
otic  inulin  supplementation  with  a  high  fibre  diet  had 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 59(2)

limited effects on mood (Leyrolle et al., 2021). However, 
exploratory analysis of the treatment responders (i.e. those 
who  reported  improved  mood  following  prebiotics)  indi-
cated that these individuals exhibited an inflammatory pro-
file and elevated faecal Coprococcus abundance at baseline 
(Leyrolle et al., 2021). These data further support the role 
of the microbiome in diet-induced mood improvement.

Inflammation

Immune  activation  and  associated  inflammatory  processes 
have  an  essential  role  in  maintaining  physical  health  in 
response to injury or infection. However, psychological stress 
also elicits an inflammatory response, including elevation of 
cytokines (Steptoe et al., 2007), and inflammatory processes 
can influence mood and psychological function (Berk et al., 
2013). Multiple lines of evidence support the importance of 
inflammation in the pathophysiology of depression and anxi-
ety  in  humans.  For  example,  inflammatory  cytokines  are 
commonly elevated in individuals with depression and anxi-
ety (Costello et al., 2019; Osimo et al., 2020), cytokine con-
centration  is  associated  with  treatment  response  in  both 
anxiety and depression (Hou et al., 2019; Strawbridge et al., 
2015), and anti-inflammatory treatments can reduce depres-
sive symptoms (Köhler-Forsberg et al., 2019).

From  a  dietary  point  of  view,  several  nutrients  have 
anti- or pro-inflammatory effects. For example, omega-3 
fatty acids naturally occurring in oily fish and polyphe-
nols present in blueberries have anti-inflammatory prop-
erties  (Giacobbe  et al.,  2020;  Yahfoufi  et al.,  2018).  A 
diet rich in refined carbohydrates and trans saturated fats 
but  low  in  plant  foods  is  considered  pro-inflammatory 
and is associated with current and future risk of depres-
sion (Firth et al., 2018; Lassale et al., 2019). Conversely, 
the Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce inflam-
mation  (Itsiopoulos  et al.,  2022),  which  likely  interacts 
with  other  postulated  mechanisms  to  influence  mental 
health (Figure 2).

Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis

The  hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal  (HPA)  axis  is  stimu-
lated  in  response  to  threats  in  healthy  individuals,  ulti-
mately leading to release of glucocorticoids. Chronic stress 
and  persistent  glucocorticoid  release  can  have  neurotoxic 
effects, leading to hippocampal atrophy and dysregulation 
of the HPA axis (Sapolsky, 2000). Aberrant glucocorticoid 
responses  are  observed  across  a  range  of  psychological 
conditions (Tafet and Nemeroff, 2020). Importantly, some 
aspects  of  HPA  axis  function  are  normalised  in  patients 
who respond to pharmacological treatment for anxiety and 
depression  (Tafet  and  Nemeroff,  2020).  Food  restriction 
has  been  shown  to  dampen  HPA  axis  responsiveness  to 
acute  stress  in  humans  and  rodents  (Rohleder  and 
Kirschbaum, 2007), and specific nutrients such as vitamin 
C  (Brody  et al.,  2002)  and  omega-3  fatty  acids  (Larrieu 

Staudacher et al.

Figure 2.  Major candidate mechanisms through which diet can impact mood.

et al.,  2014)  can  modulate  HPA  activity.  How  diet  might 
alter  HPA  axis  signalling  remains  unclear,  but  HPA  axis 
involvement  in  gut-brain  signalling  suggests  the  microbi-
ome is involved (Figure 2).

Oxidative stress

Chronic  psychological  stress  not  only  disrupts  HPA  axis 
function but also promotes oxidative damage, which have 
consistently  been  reported  in  anxiety  and  depression 
(Hovatta et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2015). Moreover, successful 
antidepressant  treatment  is  associated  with  a  reduction  in 
oxidative stress markers (Liu et al., 2015). Specific nutrients 
with  antioxidant  properties  (e.g.  vitamin  C,  cysteine  and 
polyphenols) have been associated with reductions in oxida-
tive  stress  in  cell  culture  and  animal  studies  (Zhang  and 
Tsao,  2016).  In  contrast,  a  high-fat  Western-style  diet 
increases oxidative stress markers in serum and the brain of 
rodents  (Matsuzawa-Nagata  et al.,  2008;  Studzinski  et al., 
2009). In humans, dietary antioxidant intake has been asso-
ciated with reduced depression (Ferriani et al., 2022). There 
is also emerging evidence that antioxidant compounds can 
have antidepressant and anxiolytic properties in certain clin-
ical populations (e.g. major depression, obsessive compul-
sive  disorder  and  generalised  anxiety  disorder;  Fernandes 
et al., 2016; Gautam et al., 2012; Lafleur et al., 2006).

Tryptophan metabolism

Tryptophan  is  an  essential  amino  acid  that  is  synthesised 
into  several  neuroactive  catabolites,  including  serotonin 

and  kynurenine.  Kynurenine  production  is  important 
because  it  occurs  at  the  expense  of  serotonin  production, 
and  it  is  further  metabolised  into  other  neuroactive  com-
pounds including neuroprotective kynurenic acid and neu-
rotoxic  quinolinic  acid.  A  higher  kynurenine:tryptophan 
ratio paired with a decrease in the kynurenic acid:kynurenine 
ratio  is  consistently  reported  in  major  depression  (Marx 
et al.,  2021b)  and  elevation  of  quinolinic  acid  levels  has 
been observed in untreated depression (Ogyu et al., 2018). 
Tryptophan  is  derived  from  a  variety  of  dietary  proteins 
(e.g.  meat,  fish,  nuts,  dairy).  However,  the  relationship 
between diet and plasma tryptophan is complex and manip-
ulating tryptophan levels via dietary means is difficult (Soh 
and Walter,  2014). Adding  to  this  complexity,  tryptophan 
metabolism  is  related  to  several  other  mechanisms  previ-
ously discussed, with the microbiome playing a key role in 
tryptophan degradation.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and 
neurogenesis

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most abun-
dant neurotrophin in the brain, is essential for the growth, 
differentiation,  maintenance  and  survival  of  neurons. 
Supporting  its  role  in  the  pathophysiology  of  depression, 
lower serum BDNF concentrations have been reported in 
many  studies  of  patients  with  major  depression  (Çakici 
et al., 2020) and increased expression of BDNF has been 
implicated  as  one  of  the  mechanisms  underlying  antide-
pressant drugs (Castrén and Monteggia, 2021). Intriguingly, 
including  polyphenols, 
specific  dietary  components, 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 59(2)

ANZJP Articles

preserve  hippocampal  neurogenesis  in  animal  models, 
whereas  a  Western  diet  impairs  neurogenesis  and  lowers 
hippocampal BDNF (Marx et al., 2021a). A healthy diet is 
associated  with  larger  hippocampal  volume  in  humans 
(Jacka et al., 2015) and data from the PREDIMED trial has 
shown  a  Mediterranean-style  diet  with  30 g  of  nuts  a  day 
led  to  higher  circulating  BDNF  compared  with  controls 
(Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2011). The mechanisms by which 
diet influences neurogenesis are likely through direct and 
indirect  pathways  (i.e.  via  the  microbiome;  Marx  et al., 
2021a) (Figure 2).

Obesity

The  relationship  between  depression  and  obesity  is  com-
plex. There appears to be a reciprocal relationship between 
the two conditions, that is, presence of depression increases 
risk of obesity, and vice versa (Luppino et al., 2010), how-
ever this research tends to rely on body mass index to define 
obesity, which fails to measure body composition, adiposity 
or physical fitness. A series of clinical, neurobiological and 
genetic characteristics, including higher levels of inflamma-
tion and related cytokines, are shared between the two con-
ditions,  however  the  nature  of  the  association  between 
obesity  and  mental  disorders  remains  poorly  understood. 
Importantly, negative attitudes and weight stigma can exac-
erbate mental health disorders, interfere with positive life-
style change and contribute to weight gain (Lambert et al., 
2019). Considering depressive symptoms can be alleviated 
by  dietary  intervention  in  the  absence  of  weight  change 
(Jacka et al., 2017), the goal of dietary intervention should 
be to improve diet quality rather than addressing obesity or 
overweight in people with depression.

Evidence for diet interventions in 
treating depression
Healthy diet

There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that a 
‘healthy’  diet  can  reduce  the  risk  or  treat  symptoms  of 
depression. A 2021 synthesis of prospective observational 
research identified adherence to a ‘healthy’ diet was associ-
ated with a reduced risk of depression. This included evi-
dence  from  12  studies  and  over  150,000  individuals  (Xu 
et al., 2021). The strength of the evidence from these stud-
ies needs to be interpreted in the light of some challenges. 
The ‘healthy diet’ defined in studies was heterogeneous and 
depended  on  the  background  preferences  of  each  popula-
tion.  Most  studies  make  appropriate  adjustment  for  con-
founders (e.g. physical activity, smoking); however, many 
studies  did  not  control  sufficiently  for  other  potential 
confounders.

Clinical trials provide important evidence that a healthy 
diet intervention improves depressive symptomatology. In 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 59(2)

a recent review, 16 trials including a total of nearly 46,000 
individuals  evaluated  the  effect  of  increasing  the  healthi-
ness  of  the  diet  on  depressive  symptoms  (Firth  et al., 
2019a).  Most  trials  included  participants  with  nonclinical 
depression and comorbidity such elevated cholesterol, and 
only  one  study  included  a  clinically  depressed  group. 
Across most studies, diet advice provided was in line with 
healthy eating principles. Overall, there was a small effect 
of  healthy  eating  interventions  on  reducing  depressive 
symptoms.  Interestingly,  those  studies  that  incorporated 
advice  from  registered  nutrition  professionals  were  most 
beneficial.  Based  on  the  totality  of  the  evidence,  healthy 
eating advice is beginning to be incorporated into clinical 
and  lifestyle  guidelines  for  mood  disorders  (Malhi  et al., 
2018; Marx et al., 2023).

Mediterranean diet

The Mediterranean diet has a growing evidence base for the 
prevention  and  treatment  of  depressive  disorders.  The 
pooled effect of four longitudinal studies with a mean fol-
low-up period of approximately 10 years found a 33% risk 
reduction in the development of depression for the highest 
compared to the lowest adherence categories (Lassale et al., 
2019). Recently, a large multi-centre 2 × 2 factorial design 
1-year RCT (n = 1025) evaluated whether modifying a per-
son’s  diet  to  be  more  aligned  with  the  Mediterranean  diet 
was effective in preventing the development of a depressive 
disorder.  The  intervention  group  received  food-related 
behavioural  activation  therapy,  conducted  by  a  psycholo-
gist, incorporating the Mediterranean diet and multi-nutrient 
supplementation (together and in isolation) and the control 
groups received placebo and no therapy (Bot et al., 2019). 
Although  there  was  no  difference  in  incident  depression 
between groups in the primary analysis, after accounting for 
food-related behavioural activation therapy adherence, there 
was  a  significant  favourable  effect  of  food-related  behav-
ioural activation on incident depression, indicating further 
research  is  required  to  assist  understanding  of  the  role  of 
diet in prevention of depression (Bot et al., 2019b).

Stronger and more consistent evidence has been found 
for  Mediterranean  diet  intervention  to  treat  symptoms  in 
people with clinical depression (Bayes et al., 2022; Francis 
et al.,  2019;  Jacka  et al.,  2017;  Parletta  et al.,  2019).  The 
2017 ‘SMILES’ 12-week parallel group (n = 56 adults) trial 
found  a  dietitian-delivered,  modified  Mediterranean  diet 
intervention  was  superior  to  a  social  support  group  in 
reducing  depressive  symptoms,  with  remission  being 
achieved  in  32%  of  the  Mediterranean  diet  group  com-
pared to 8% in the social support group (Jacka et al., 2017). 
The 6-month ‘HELFIMED’ trial (n = 152 adults), incorpo-
rating  nutrition  education  and  fish  oil  supplementation 
demonstrated  similar  findings  (Parletta  et al.,  2019).  In 
both trials, improvements in Mediterranean diet adherence 
scores  aligned  with  reductions  in  depressive  symptoms 

Staudacher et al.

(Opie  et al.,  2018;  Parletta  et al.,  2019).  Similar  findings 
have  been  reported  in  younger  individuals,  including  a 
12-week RCT (n = 72) in young males (Bayes et al., 2022), 
and a 3-week RCT in young adults (17–35 years) (Francis 
et al., 2019), both finding a greater reduction in depressive 
symptoms in the Mediterranean diet group.

Considering the frequent comorbidity of anxiety in indi-
viduals with depression, it is interesting to note there is rea-
sonable  consistency  in  the  observational  evidence  for  the 
Mediterranean  diet  being  protective  against  anxiety 
(Madani et al., 2022), however intervention studies in peo-
ple with anxiety disorders are lacking.

Anti-inflammatory diet

People  with  depressive  disorders  appear  to  have  dietary 
intakes  with  higher  inflammatory  potential  based  on  DII 
scoring.  An  analysis  of  68,879  people  from  the  baseline 
phase  of  the  UK  Biobank  study  (2007–2010),  found  DII 
scores  were  significantly  higher  for  people  with  major 
depression compared to people without a serious mental ill-
ness, after adjusting for a range of confounders (Firth et al., 
2018). Evidence from 11 observational studies (n > 100,000) 
also reports a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with 1.4 
times higher odds of having/developing depression in the 
future (Tolkien et al., 2019).

Other traditional diets

The  beneficial  effect  of  traditional  diet  interventions  on 
depression  may  not  be  limited  to  the  Mediterranean  diet, 
however there is less evidence for other traditional dietary 
patterns. For example, a cross-sectional study of Japanese 
men and women aged 21–67 years (n = 521), found a 56% 
risk  reduction  for  depressive  symptoms  in  those  with  the 
highest  adherence  compared  with  the  lowest  adherence 
(Nanri  et al.,  2010).  In  a  12-week  RCT,  of  people  with 
severe  obesity  in  Brazil  (n = 149)  were  randomised  to  52 
mL/day of extra virgin olive oil, traditional Brazilian diet, 
or  traditional  Brazilian  diet  with  52  mL/d  of  extra  virgin 
olive  oil. There  was  a  significant  reduction  in  depression 
and anxiety scores in all three groups (Canheta et al., 2021). 
Finally, a small RCT (n = 16) has reported feasibility of a 
Nordic  diet  as  a  treatment  for  depression  (Sabet  et al., 
2021), providing a platform for larger efficacy trials.

DASH diet

The DASH diet has predominantly been studied in the con-
text of hypertension and cardiovascular disease and is rec-
ommended 
in  clinical  guidelines  for  prevention  of 
cardiovascular disease (Chiavaroli et al., 2019). The over-
lapping pathophysiologies of hypertension and depression 
(e.g. hyperactivation of the HPA axis, oxidative stress, low 
grade inflammation) spurred interest in whether the DASH 
diet might also have a protective role for mood disorders. A 
large prospective study of the Spanish SUN cohort showed 
a  moderate  relationship  between  four  DASH  diet  indices 
and  depression  risk  over  8  years  of  follow-up  (Perez-
Cornago et al., 2017), in contrast with the clearer inverse 
relationship between the Mediterranean dietary pattern and 
depression  in  the  same  cohort  (Sánchez-Villegas  et al., 
2009). Only one RCT to date has studied  the  DASH  diet 
and  its  effect  on  depressive  symptoms,  which  failed  to 
show  an  effect  on  depressive  scores  compared  with  a 
healthy  diet  control  group  that  had  lower  targets  for  fruit 
and vegetable intake (Torres and Nowson, 2012). Overall, 
to  date  there  is  insufficient  evidence  supporting  a  DASH 
diet for the prevention or treatment of depression.

Limitations of the research

There are a range of limitations of the research evaluating 
the role of diet intervention for treating or preventing depres-
sive  symptoms.  A  considerable  proportion  of  RCTs  have 
been conducted either in general population samples or clin-
ical samples with a primary physical health condition, rather 
than  in  samples  of  people  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  a 
depressive  disorder.  Where  individuals  with  a  depression 
diagnosis are included, participant selection occurs via self-
reported  depression  questionnaires  rather  than  a  clinical 
diagnosis, meaning findings are not necessarily generalisa-
ble to those with a clinical disorder. Response bias may also 
be significant in studies due to involvement of participants 
with  strong  interest  in  diet.  Interventions  may  therefore 
appear feasible and effective based on data from RCTs but 
are less promising when scaled up to reach a larger propor-
tion of the clinical population.

Other  factors  challenge  synthesis  and  interpretation  of 
studies. There is large heterogeneity of instruments used to 
measure depressive symptoms as well as dietary intake and 
adherence.  Particularly  relevant  for  observational  studies, 
many  measure  dietary  intake  at  a  single  timepoint  which 
fails to capture temporal variability in eating behaviour. Diet 
RCTs differ in the mode of delivery of diet intervention, the 
nature  of  the  intervention  (e.g.  some  include  counselling 
and goal-setting), the presence of blinding and the nature of 
the control intervention. Finally, many intervention studies 
are short-term and lack long-term follow-up. Therefore, the 
ability  of  individuals  to  maintain  adherence  and  the  long-
term effectiveness of diet interventions remains unclear.

Recommendations for future research

Enhancing diet quality is one of a suite of lifestyle changes 
that  can  improve  symptoms  of  depression.  Future  trials 
must explore whether combined intervention models (e.g. 
diet + exercise  intervention)  are  superior  and  also  disen-
tangle  the  effects  of  individual  lifestyle  components. 
Further  to  this,  the  efficacy  of  dietary  modification  as  a 
sole intervention, given published studies rarely restrict the

use  of  psychotropic  medications,  is  still  to  be  confirmed. 
The literature is also biased towards individuals from high-
income  countries,  and  the  role  of  dietary  modification  in 
lower-income  countries  where  food  insecurity  rates  are 
considerably  high  and  access  to  more  traditional  mental 
health care are already strained needs to be determined.

Symptoms  central  to  depressive  disorders  can  often 
challenge recruitment to studies as well as engagement and 
adherence to behavioural interventions. Recruitment strate-
gies should therefore aim to include a diverse range of par-
ticipants, or at least clearly define the sample group when 
publishing findings.

The heterogeneity and generalisability of diet interven-
tion delivery needs consideration. Some elements (e.g. pro-
vision of food hampers) are not feasible when scaled to real 
world implementation. Furthermore, a better understanding 
of  the  nature  and  intensity/frequency  of  counselling,  and 
efficacy of different delivery modes (e.g. face-to-face indi-
vidualised, group) is required. Ideally, future trials should 
evaluate  modes  of  delivery  that  are  easily  adopted  and 
delivered at scale, and mode of delivery and diet composi-
tion should be clearly specified.

Individuals with depression are a heterogeneous popula-
tion. Patients experience a variety of symptoms and levels 
of acuity, with the potential for differing triggers, different 
treatment approaches and associated comorbidities. This is 
an important consideration as the efficacy of different treat-
ment approaches may differ across subgroups, for example, 
reducing inflammation may only be beneficial to the sub-
group of people with depression who have elevated inflam-
matory markers. Identification of specific biopsychosocial 
predictors  to  diet  intervention  will  be  an  important  step 
forward.

Application to practice for mental 
health clinicians
Dietary assessment and counselling

Dietitians  are  nutrition  experts  trained  in  providing  indi-
vidualised dietary advice for health and disease. A range of 
clinical, physical, mental and social factors are considered 
throughout the nutrition care process, as many of these are 
critical for successful patient engagement. Commonly, the 
nutrition care process includes assessment of dietary intake, 
assessment  of  the  patient’s  knowledge  and  motivation  to 
change, discussion and identification of the issues and bar-
riers  to  be  addressed,  provision  of  information,  nutrition 
counselling  and  evaluation  of  dietary  changes  that  have 
previously been implemented. Although many individuals 
will benefit from dietary assessment and/or counselling by 
their  mental  health  clinician,  there  are  some  individuals 
that should be referred to a dietitian, such as those with a 
history  of  or  existing  eating  disorders  (e.g.  anorexia  ner-
vosa, bulimia nervosa) or those with disordered eating. In 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 59(2)

those  with  disordered  eating,  individuals  may  experience 
symptoms and exhibit behaviours of eating disorders (e.g. 
inflexible eating patterns, restrictive eating or dieting), but 
at a lesser frequency or lower level of severity. The preva-
lence  of  disordered  eating  is  up  to  32%  in  younger  indi-
viduals and is more prevalent in those with mental health 
problems (Sparti et al., 2019). Individuals who are young, 
pregnant  or  elderly,  and  those  with  additional  nutrition 
needs (e.g. comorbid disorders such as gastrointestinal dis-
orders or type 2 diabetes) or with loss of appetite or signifi-
cant weight change should also be referred to a dietitian for 
their nutrition care.

An important first step in the nutrition care process for 
any  clinician  seeing  individuals  with  depression  is  the 
assessment  of  dietary  intake  and  dietary  behaviour.  For  a 
clinician  not  trained  in  nutritional  assessment  techniques, 
this could start with simple open questions regarding how 
many meals and/or snacks are eaten per day, if the patient 
cooks for themselves, or whether they can describe a typi-
cal  day’s  intake.  Initiating  a  discussion  around  food  and 
eating will also help to provide some understanding about 
an  individual’s  knowledge  about  nutrition  and  its  impor-
tance to the individual.

Second, identifying the main barriers for healthy eating 
is needed to construct a patient-centred plan and to identify 
the  support  required  to  achieve  their  nutrition  goals.  The 
typical side-effects of common mental disorders should be 
considered  (e.g.  altered  appetite  [reduced,  increased  or 
food-specific  cravings],  apathy,  low  motivation,  impaired 
concentration and memory) when assessing these barriers.
Third, to facilitate dietary behaviour change, psychoed-
ucation and evidence-based resources should be provided. 
Clinicians are recommended to provide diet counselling in 
a sensitive manner, cognisant that many individuals experi-
ence  shame  and  guilt  when  discussing  weight  and  diet 
behaviours.  Dietary  information  should  be  delivered  in 
accessible, bite-size format, and take into consideration the 
individuals learning styles, baseline knowledge and beliefs, 
motivations, readiness to engage in sessions, and relevant 
lifestyle factors (e.g. work commitments, family dynamic). 
Importantly,  motivation  and  readiness  to  change  can  be 
highly  variable  and  should  be  assessed  in  each  session. 
When the individual is ready, focusing on small, attainable 
and value-based goals will build motivation and self-capac-
ity  for  change.  For  example,  providing  practical  tips  for 
cooking and preparing meals and snacks may be warranted, 
with a large emphasis on forward planning (e.g. developing 
shopping lists, preparing meals in advance and stocking the 
home with long shelf-life foods) for times when a patient is 
experiencing  increased  severity  of  symptoms.  To  support 
dietary adherence, recommendations should also align with 
common  cravings.  For  example,  nutritious  foods  can  be 
encouraged  that  address  cravings  for  ‘sugary’  foods  (e.g. 
Greek yoghurt with walnuts, honey, fruit) and ‘salty’ ‘fatty’ 
foods (e.g. olives and nuts).

Staudacher et al.

Finally, through reflective practice, evaluating outcomes 
and  identifying  helpful  strategies  that  have  facilitated 
change will assist the clinician in fine tuning their dietary 
assessment and counselling skills (Koshy et al., 2017).

Clinical considerations

Individuals  with  depression  commonly  present  with  other 
psychological comorbidities (e.g. anxiety) and chronic phys-
ical conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, metabolic syn-
drome and type 2 diabetes). Many of these are responsive to 
dietary intervention. There is strong evidence that diet inter-
ventions for depression (i.e. Mediterranean diet and DASH 
diet) also achieve improved health outcomes at least for car-
diovascular  disease  and  diabetes  (Martinez-Lacoba  et al., 
2018), and therefore there is potential for dietary counselling 
to address both mental and physical health conditions in the 
same  individual.  In  any  case,  a  weight-neutral  approach  is 
critical  (i.e.  lack  of  focus  on  weight  loss  but  rather  health 
behaviour change) (Hunger et al., 2020). Weight stigma and 
negative attitudes about one’s body weight and shape hinder 
positive changes, creates unnecessary pressure and can pro-
mote poor eating behaviour and low motivation (Vartanian 
and Porter, 2016). Evidence demonstrates that improvements 
in  depressive  symptoms  (and  physiological  health)  can  be 
achieved with dietary improvement without weight loss and 
in higher weight people (e.g. body mass index = 30 k/gm2) 
(Jacka et al., 2017).

Social considerations

Individuals  living  with  mental  illness  commonly  experi-
ence high rates of unemployment or missed days at work 
and therefore may lack adequate finances to access food or 
to access nutrition services. Food insecurity relates to lim-
ited  or  uncertain  access  to  sufficient,  safe  and  nutritious 
food for normal growth and development and an active and 
healthy  life  (Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation  of  the 
United  Nations  [FAO],  2022).  This  may  include  lack  of 
resources, access to nutritious food at an affordable price, 
access due to geographical isolation, cooking facilities, and 
knowledge or skills to make appropriate choices. The clini-
cian should ascertain the degree of food insecurity experi-
enced by the individual and modify dietary recommendations 
accordingly,  for  example,  strategies  for  preparing  meals 
with minimal storage; free community meals; community 
cooking classes. For individuals requiring dietetic assess-
ment  and  counselling,  clinicians  should  explore  potential 
subsidised  dietetic  services  available  and  how  they  may 
access them.

Service considerations

Dietary consultations should be delivered using an evidence-
based  approach  underpinned  by  peer-reviewed  scientific 

research, while considering the therapeutic relationship with 
the patient (Nagy et al., 2022). With regard to the intensity 
and  frequency  of  nutrition  care  for  efficacy  in  depression, 
evidence from the SMILES trial shows that an intervention 
encompassing  seven  individualised  face-to-face  sessions 
with a dietitian involving motivational interviewing and goal 
setting, with the aim to encourage dietary change, delivered 
over a 3-month period (e.g. weekly to fortnightly sessions) 
can achieve reductions in depressive symptoms (Jacka et al., 
2017; Opie et al., 2018). In practice, initial dietetic appoint-
ments are of 60 minutes duration and review appointments 
are  of  30–60 minutes  duration  (Dietitians Australia,  2019). 
This degree of service frequency and intensity can allow for 
meaningful changes in dietary quality The complex nature of 
common mental disorders and the many facets of the indi-
vidual  and  their  multiple  health  concerns  often  necessitate 
more  frequent  sessions.  Those  with  lower  readiness  to 
change,  or  limited  food-related  knowledge  or  skills,  may 
benefit  from  a  greater  number  of  diet-focused  sessions, 
longer period of extensive support and/or ‘restart’ opportuni-
ties. For a long-term effectiveness, diet interventions should 
be flexible, with continuous motivational support and broad 
multifaceted strategies for change (Firth et al., 2019b).

Delivery considerations

Developing  a  meaningful  therapeutic  relationship  is  con-
sidered  crucial  in  nutrition  practice  and  pivotal  to  how 
effectively  the  patient  and  the  professional  engage  and 
work  together  (Nagy  et al.,  2022).  Face-to-face  consulta-
tion  allows  for  tailoring  or  personalisation  of  nutrition 
information  to  the  individuals’  requirements  and  lifestyle 
with  the  aim  of  facilitating  behaviour  change.  Evidence 
from RCTs of personalised nutrition interventions demon-
strate  that  compared  to  web-based  interventions,  face-to-
face  nutrition  interventions  can  achieve  significantly 
greater dietary change, and are also more likely to produce 
long-term  benefits  (Al-Awadhi  et al.,  2021).  In  addition, 
supporting a patient to attend in-person appointments can 
play  an  important  role  in  working  through  motivation, 
encouraging forward planning and routine. However, face-
to-face nutrition services can be expensive, time-consum-
ing  and  may  not  be  accessible  to  everyone  (Al-Awadhi 
et al., 2021).

Following 

technological  advances,  web-based  and 
mobile methods of dietary advice are increasingly replac-
ing or supplementing face-to-face consultations. Telehealth 
offers a convenient service that can be especially desirable 
for individuals with mood disorders who commonly expe-
rience amotivation and/or agoraphobia. In addition, it can 
reduce  the  burden  associated  with  regular  attendance  at 
appointments  and  potential  financial  concerns  (e.g.  cost 
of transport). Telehealth and web-applications can reach a 
larger population and allows patients with mobility issues 
to  access  services.  Importantly,  web-based  nutrition

interventions  should  be  personalised  in  order  to  support 
dietary change, but there is currently insufficient evidence 
that web-based interventions are as effective as face-to-face 
interventions (Al-Awadhi et al., 2021).

It  is  worth  considering  the  use  of  multiple  delivery 
modes which allows for development of a therapeutic alli-
ance in the initial phases, while allowing for a convenient 
service with reduced patient–clinician burden in the latter 
phase (e.g. initial face-to-face consultation with videocon-
ference review appointments). Finally, group consultations 
should be considered in the context of providing a valuable 
opportunity for peer support (Watkins et al., 2020).

Final considerations

Diet  interventions  can  lead  to  impressive  reductions  in 
depressive symptoms, particularly when advice is dietitian-
delivered  and  with  sufficient  frequency  of  sessions. 
However,  psychiatrists,  psychologists  and  other  mental 
health clinicians can play an important role in the assess-
ment and counselling of individuals with regard to diet, and 
at least raising patient awareness of the role of diet in men-
tal  health.  For  example,  clinicians  could  discuss  with 
patients of the current evidence that healthy dietary patterns 
may be instrumental in managing symptoms of depression. 
Conversely, a high intake of discretionary items (e.g. crisps 
and sugar sweetened beverages) increases the risk of poor 
mental health. This must be delivered in a highly sensitive 
non-stigmatising fashion, as patients commonly experience 
shame  around  food,  eating  and  body  weight.  Support 
should focus on positive behavioural changes (e.g. increas-
ing intake of legumes by one serve/ week) and should be 
weight-neutral. Raising the profile of nutrition is highly rel-
evant  and  in  accordance  with  Royal  Australian  New 
Zealand  College  of  Psychiatrists  clinical  practice  guide-
lines stating lifestyle approaches should form the founda-
tion of treatment for mood disorders (Malhi et al., 2018).

Psychiatrists  and  other  members  of  the  mental  health 
team also play a part in working a patient up for a referral 
to a mental health dietitian. This work-up involves estab-
lishing  an  individual’s  interest  in  dietary  change,  their 
motivation level and readiness to change, and presence of 
potential  ‘red-flags’,  including  eating  disorders,  disor-
dered  eating,  poorly  managed  comorbid  medical  health 
conditions, loss of appetite, significant weight change, need 
for a specialised diet or pregnancy.

data to support Mediterranean diet intervention to improve 
symptoms  of  depression.  Given  the  high  rates  of  cardio-
metabolic comorbidity in individuals with depression, this 
is  a  favourable  approach  because  of  its  protective  effects 
for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Mental 
health clinicians are well placed to provide nutrition coun-
selling and to use clinical judgement in the timing of nutri-
tion counselling and the choice of approach that reflects the 
needs of the patient but are encouraged to refer to a special-
ist dietitian where necessary.

The large burden of early mortality due to cardiometabolic 
illness, alongside the more recent evidence for diet quality 
as a risk factor and treatment target for mental health prob-
