BACKGROUND: Perinatal mood disorders are common yet underdiagnosed and un- or undertreated. Barriers exist to accessing perinatal
mental health services, including limited availability, time, and cost. Automated conversational agents (chatbots) can deliver evidence-based cog-
nitive behavioral therapy content through text message-based conversations and reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in select populations.
Such digital mental health technologies are poised to overcome barriers to mental health care access but need to be evaluated for efﬁcacy, as
well as for preliminary feasibility and acceptability among perinatal populations.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efﬁcacy of a mental health chatbot for mood management in a general postpartum
population.
STUDY DESIGN: An unblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary academic center. English-speaking postpartum
women aged 18 years or above with a live birth and access to a smartphone were eligible for enrollment prior to discharge from delivery hospital-
ization. Baseline surveys were administered to all participants prior to randomization to a mental health chatbot intervention or to usual care only.
The intervention group downloaded the mental health chatbot smartphone application with perinatal-speciﬁc content, in addition to continuing
usual care. Usual care consisted of routine postpartum follow up and mental health care as dictated by the patient’s obstetric provider. Surveys
were administered during delivery hospitalization (baseline) and at 2-, 4-, and 6-weeks postpartum to assess depression and anxiety symptoms.
The primary outcome was a change in depression symptoms at 6-weeks as measured using two depression screening tools: Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms measured using Generalized Anxiety Dis-
order-7, and satisfaction and acceptability using validated scales. Based on a prior study, we estimated a sample size of 130 would have
sufﬁcient (80%) power to detect a moderate effect size (d=.4) in between group difference on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.
RESULTS: A total of 192 women were randomized equally 1:1 to the chatbot or usual care; of these, 152 women completed the 6-week sur-
vey (n=68 chatbot, n=84 usual care) and were included in the ﬁnal analysis. Mean baseline mental health assessment scores were below positive
screening thresholds. At 6-weeks, there was a greater decrease in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores among the chatbot group compared to
the usual care group (mean decrease=1.32, standard deviation=3.4 vs mean decrease=0.13, standard deviation=3.01, respectively). 6-week
mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scores did not differ between groups and were similar to base-
line. 91% (n=62) of the chatbot users were satisﬁed or highly satisﬁed with the chatbot, and 74% (n=50) of the intervention group reported use
of the chatbot at least once in 2 weeks prior to the 6-week survey. 80% of study participants reported being comfortable with the use of a mobile
smartphone application for mood management.
CONCLUSION: Use of a chatbot was acceptable to women in the early postpartum period. The sample did not screen positive for depression
at baseline and thus the potential of the chatbot to reduce depressive symptoms in this population was limited. This study was conducted in a
general obstetric population. Future studies of longer duration in high-risk postpartum populations who screen positive for depression are needed
to further understand the utility and efﬁcacy of such digital therapeutics for that population.

AJOG Global Reports at a Glance

Why was this study conducted?
To pilot the acceptability and preliminary efﬁcacy of a smartphone application-
based mental health chatbot for postpartum mental health.

Key ﬁndings
Participants randomized to use the chatbot reported high satisfaction with the
chatbot and found it highly acceptable as a mental health management tool.
Among a general postpartum and non-depressed population, the use of a smart-
phone application-based mental health chatbot for the ﬁrst 6 weeks postpartum
reduced depression scores from baseline on one assessment tool that is com-
monly used in clinical practice.

What does this add to what is known?
This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that a digital mental health
resource, such as a chatbot, may contribute to mood management and improve-
ment in the postpartum period, and that such approaches are of interest and
acceptable to patients.

Introduction
Childbirth is a signiﬁcant event, accom-
panied by deﬁnitive life changes, includ-
ing physical, behavioral, psychological,
and emotional adjustments. The Ameri-
of Obstetricians
and
can College
Gynecologists
recommends
(ACOG)
screening of all women for depression
and anxiety symptoms at the compre-
hensive postpartum visit. Worldwide,
about 10-20% of women develop the
full clinical syndrome of peripartum
depression,1 deﬁned as minor or major
depressive episodes with onset during
pregnancy or within the ﬁrst 12 months
following childbirth.2 The American
Psychiatric Association’s (APA) guide-
lines for the treatment of women with
major depression who are pregnant or
breastfeeding indicate psychotherapy
without medication as a ﬁrst line treat-
ment.3 Cognitive behavioral
therapy
(CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy
(IPT) are evidence-supported and rec-
ommended psychotherapies for post-
partum depression (PPD).4-7

Research on cognitive behavioral
therapy translated into digital forms has

Control: usual care
Usual care consisted of usual postpar-
tum management at the discretion of
the patient’s obstetric provider. At the
study site, Lucile Packard Children’s
Hospital, patients are generally seen for
an in-person obstetric visit at 6-weeks
postpartum wherein an Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is
self-administered. Some patients may
also have an earlier in-person or tele-
health postpartum phone visit depend-
ing on their provider and their speciﬁc
comorbidities.

Intervention: chatbot and usual care
The chatbot, called Woebot, was devel-
oped by Woebot Health and has demon-
strated reductions
in symptoms of
depression among a young adult popula-
tion10 and adolescents17 as well as sub-
stance use reductions among adults.16
For this study, peripartum-speciﬁc con-
tent was adapted to support postpartum
mothers managing mood and anxiety
and added to Woebot. The program

derived from CBT and IPT for postpar-
tum mood and invites users to track and

Results
From January to May 2019, 467 inpa-

within 72 hours of delivery. Of the 282
women who were eligible, 193 (68%)
consented to participate. Among this
group, 192 women completed the base-
line assessment and were randomized to
the usual care or chatbot group (n=96 in
each condition) (Figure 1).

There were no differences between the
two groups at baseline on any variable
except for the distribution of age but
mean age in both groups was 34 years

Chatbot group: satisfaction,

Mean CSQ-8 satisfaction score in the
chatbot group was 24.0 (SD=5.7). 64% of

chatbot users had scores ≥ 24, indicating
high satisfaction with the tool (Table 3).
Most patients (74%) in the chatbot group
reported using the chatbot at least once
in the 2 weeks prior to the 6-week survey
completion. There were no signiﬁcant
differences in satisfaction or therapeutic
alliance scores between participants by
frequency of use (Table 3).

Therapeutic relationship as measured
by the WAI-SR demonstrated high
scores in the bond-subscale (mean=3.3
[SD=1.6]),
indicating the participants
endorsed establishing an affective bond
with the chatbot. Chatbot participants
had a medium score on the goal and
task subscales
(mean=2.9 [SD=1.5];
mean=2.7 [SD=1.3] respectively).

Comment
Principal ﬁndings
A general postpartum population felt
that monitoring depression and anxiety
in the postpartum period was important
and demonstrated an interest in using a
smartphone application for mood man-
agement. Moreover, the use of a chatbot
delivering CBT and IPT therapeutic

techniques and perinatal psychoeduca-
tional content was acceptable to women
in the early postpartum period. Relative
to a usual care control group, the use of
a chatbot improved mean depression
scores between birth and 6-weeks post-
partum based on one common depres-
sion screening
even
though the sample was below the
screening threshold for depression at
baseline. There were no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between groups on the EPDS
or an anxiety screening tool, GAD-7,
although both means were below
screening thresholds at baseline, indi-
cating there was no clinical need for
improvement of scores.

Reducing maternal depression is associ-
ated with positive outcomes for both
mother and child.13 Psychotherapy is
considered ﬁrst line treatment and does
not involve the risk of exposure to med-
ications,14 yet barriers to psychotherapy
are persistent and pervasive (eg, short-
age of licensed mental health providers,
stigma, transportation, childcare, cost
prohibitive). Thus, most women go
unrecognized and under- or completely
untreated. This study was the ﬁrst to
investigate the preliminary efﬁcacy and
acceptability of a mental health chatbot
that delivers evidence-based psycho-
therapeutic techniques in the provision
of postpartum mental health care.

This study population was on average
asymptomatic for depression. Stated
differently, their mean scores on two
gold-standard clinical screening tools
for depression were less than estab-
lished cut-offs that indicate the presence
of depression (PHQ-9 ≤5and EPDS
≤10). The study was not powered to
detect change in a non-clinical sample.
Moreover, statistically signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in depression are not expected at
all in a non-depressed population, such
as the present sample.

signiﬁcant differences in depression, are
not expected among an asymptomatic
population, the direct of improvement
of scores for the chatbot over the usual
care group is consistent across both the
PHQ-9 and EPDS measures and analy-
ses. A study of individuals with depres-
sion at baseline, indicated by either or
both a screening tool (PHQ-9; EPDS)
or a structured diagnostic clinical inter-
view (SCID), would further inform the
chatbot’s true impact upon women with
depression. Such a study could also uti-
lize recommended thresholds for mini-

pants showed the chatbot helped them
to consciously focus on mood changes
and provided them with tools and tech-
niques to impact their mood and behav-
ior. Participants were satisﬁed with the
chatbot due to increased availability
and the ability to check in on their men-
tal health at their own convenience at
any time of the day or night. Such
acceptability data among a population
in need of mental health care and facing
signiﬁcant mood changes is promising
to both patients and providers who
often ﬁnd themselves with limited
options for mental health care referral
resources. This data is consistent with a
recent study which demonstrated that
using text-messaging
technology to
screen women for postpartum depres-
sion and provide information on post-
partum mental health appears to be
sensitive, feasible, and well accepted.15
The study results indicated that post-
partum patients are engaged with mes-
sage-based communication, with nearly
all participants responding to at least
one of the six text messages, and two-
thirds responding to all six messages.
Participants randomized to the chatbot
group also established a therapeutic alli-
ance with chatbot. Speciﬁcally, all WAI-
SR scores were in the acceptable range,
with speciﬁc questions about the bond
between Woebot and the participant
scores. These

distinct populations of individuals with

psychotherapy outcomes, but this is the

apeutic relationship between a chatbot

women. We did not ﬁnd factors clearly
associated with high usage, and depres-
sion scores did not seem to be inversely
related to usage, although the study was
not powered to detect differences for
groups based on usage.

Strengths and limitations
Study strengths include the randomized
design and low dropout rate. Feasibility
and study interest were high; women
who had given birth within the previous
72 hours were approached during their
birth hospitalization and offered the
opportunity to participate in this study.
Despite a myriad of adjustments occur-
ring within these early postpartum
days, this study yielded a 68% consent
to participate rate among women who
were eligible to participate. Another
study strength is that nearly half of the
sample self-identiﬁed as a minority
population, highlighting the diversity of
the group. The depression outcomes
were derived from internationally rec-
ognized gold-standard self-report meas-
and
ures with substantial
reliability, and represent the most com-
mon depression screeners presently
used in clinical practice and settings,
lengthy diagnostic measures
unlike
which are often impractical to imple-
ment in real world clinical settings. The
current study has several
limitations.
The study period was limited to short-
term outcomes with no follow-up
period and inability to conﬁrm usage of
chatbot beyond self-reported usage. The
study did not assess gender identity or
speciﬁc relevant obstetric history factors
(ie, pregnancy and delivery complica-
tions, route of delivery) that may inﬂu-
ence depression and anxiety symptoms;

included a higher proportion of Asian

to participate in this study were women
who gave birth at Lucille Packard’s

to May 2019 and reﬂect the maternity

national samples is warranted. Future

Conclusions and implications
Millions of women suffer from signiﬁ-
cant mood changes during the peripar-
tum period yet only a small fraction
access help, leaving them often alone to
face the tremendously daunting and
simultaneous
that
lifestyle
motherhood demands. Improved access
to maternal mental health care is a fun-
damental need that women, their fami-
lies, providers, and clinics face together.
Yet smartphone ownership in women
of child-bearing age is very high as in
interest in digital mood management
options. A smartphone application-
based conversational agent
(chatbot)
that delivers mood management pro-
grams is poised to dramatically improve
access to mental health treatment and
deliver support to a large number of
women immediately. This randomized
controlled trial demonstrated that the
chatbot had high feasibility and accept-
ability as well as preliminary efﬁcacy in
reducing depression score on one gold-

standard depression screening tool.
Future studies investigating this tech-
nology within a cohort with clinical lev-
els of depression and over a longer
period of time are encouraged, with par-
ticular attention made to addressing
strengths and limitations identiﬁed in
&
this preliminary/pilot study.
