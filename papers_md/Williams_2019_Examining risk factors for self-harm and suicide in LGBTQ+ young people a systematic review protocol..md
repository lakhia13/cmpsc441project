ABSTRACT
Introduction  Young people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning (LGBTQ+) 
are at increased risk for self- harm, suicide ideation and 
behaviours. However, there has yet to be a comprehensive 
understanding of what risk factors influence these 
behaviours within LGBTQ+ young people as a whole. 
The purpose of this systematic review is to examine risk 
factors associated with self- harm, suicidal ideation and 
behaviour in LGBTQ+) young people.
Methods and analysis  A systematic review will be 
conducted, conforming to the reporting guidelines of the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta- Analyses statement recommendations. Electronic 
databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO and 
Web of Science) will be systematically searched for 
cross- sectional, prospective, longitudinal, cohort and 
case–control designs which examine risk factors for self- 
harm and/or suicidal ideation and behaviour in LGBTQ+ 
young people (aged 12–25 years). Only studies published 
in English will be included. No date restrictions will be 
applied. Study quality assessment will be conducted using 
the original and modified Newcastle- Ottawa Scales. Meta- 
analysis or narrative synthesis will be used, dependent on 
findings.
Ethics and dissemination  This is a systematic review of 
published literature and thereby ethical approval was not 
sought. The review will be submitted to a peer- reviewed 
journal, be publicly disseminated at conferences focusing 
on mental health, self- harm and suicide prevention. The 
findings will also be shared through public engagement 
and involvement, particularly those related to young 
LGBTQ+ individuals.
PROSPERO registration number  CRD42019130037.

InTROduCTIOn
Suicide, intentionally ending one’s own life,1 
is  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  death  within 
young  people.2  3  Globally,  suicide  accounts 
for  around  131 441  deaths  between  the  ages 
of  15  and  24.2  Rates  of  self- harm,  the  self- 
injury  or  poisoning  of  one’s  self  irrespective 
of  suicidal  intent,4  are  on  the  rise  among 
young people.5 Data from the 2014 UK Adult 
Morbidity Survey state that 25.7% of women 
and  9.7%  of  men  were  likely  to  have  self- 
harmed between the ages of 16 and 24 years.6 
Approximately  50%  of  those  who  die  by 

Strengths and limitations of this study

 ► This is the first systematic review of risk factors for 
both self- harm as an individual behaviour, and sui-
cidal ideation and suicidal behaviour among Lesbian, 
Gay,  Bisexual,  Transgender,  Queer  or  Questioning 
young people.

 ► The protocol has been written following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- 
Analyses Protocol guidelines (2015).

 ► The  robust  search  strategy  was  conducted  with 
input  from  an  academic  skills  specialist  to  ensure 
replication across all databases, and capture a large 
range of papers.

 ► The  systematic  review  will  follow  the  Cochrane 

Review guidelines.

 ► A  limitation  of  this  systematic  review  is  the  exclu-
sion of studies which are not published in English; 
this may bias findings against non- English speaking 
countries.

suicide  have  previously  self- harmed,  making 
self- harm  one  of  the  strongest  predictors  of 
suicide.7–9

Among  people  who  identify  under  the 
umbrella 
term  LGBTQ+  (Lesbian,  Gay, 
Bisexual,  Transgender,  Queer  or  Ques-
tioning),  this  being  how  one  self- identifies 
as  their  sex,  sexuality,  gender  identity  and 
gender expression,10 there are elevated rates 
of  suicidal  ideation  (thoughts  of  self- harm, 
the  consideration  or  planning  of  suicide1) 
and  suicidal  behaviour.11–13  King  et  al’s  2008 
systematic review found that lesbian, gay and 
bisexual  (LGB)  individuals  were  found  to 
be at higher risk for both suicidal behaviour 
and ideation compared with heterosexuals.11 
Internationally,  this  has  been  estimated  to 
be  between  four  and  eight  times  higher 
in  LGB  and  transgender  young  people 
when  compared  with  the  heterosexual  and 
cisgender  peers.14  While  as  a  broad  group, 
sexual and gender minorities have high levels 
of  suicidal  ideation  and  behaviour,  among 
transgender  people  (individuals  who  do  not 
present or identify with their sex assigned at

birth15) these rates are even greater. Indeed, lifetime risk 
for suicide attempt is estimated to be between 22% and 
43%, with 9%–10% having made an attempt in the past 
12 months.16–20

Previous  research  has  examined  potential  risk  factors 
for  self- harm  and  suicide  in  young  people  in  general 
populations. These risk factors range from demographic 
characteristics  such  as  being  female,  being  a  younger 
adult  or  adolescent,  having  fewer  qualifications,21  to 
childhood  abuse  and  neglect.22  23  Additional  risks  such 
as  bullying  and  academic  pressure  have  been  linked  to 
suicidal behaviour in young people,9 as well as any mental 
health disorder.24 Other factors which relate to the risk of 
self- harm  repetition  include  troubled  relationships  with 
family  members,  social  isolation,  poor  academic  perfor-
mance, alcohol and drug misuse, and depression.25

Given  the  heightened  risk  of  suicide  attempt  within 
LGBTQ+,11–13  26  it  would  be  pertinent  to  explore  which 
factors  specifically  pose  as  a  risk  to  this  population. 
Although  some  of  these  risk  factors  may  overlap  with 
those  from  non- LGBTQ+  populations  (eg,  depression, 
substance  or  alcohol  misuse),11  27  there  are  also  unique 
risk factors to sexual and gender minorities. For example, 
Clements- Nolle  et  al27  stated  that  experiences  of  abuse, 
discrimination  or  harassment  due  to  an  individual’s 
gender identity or presentation were also linked to high 
levels  of  attempted  suicide.  Meyer28  29  suggested  that 
additional  risk  within  homosexual  communities  may 
be  related  to  the  high  levels  of  stigma,  prejudice  and 
discrimination which thereby impacts individual’s mental 
well- being. Victimisation or discrimination due to sexual 
orientation  and  gender  identity  is  particularly  common 
within  LGBTQ+  populations.30–33  In  addition,  among 
LGBTQ+ young people, these experiences were found to 
be significantly associated with suicidal ideation.34 35 It is 
suggested that young people may internalise these expe-
riences  of  public  stigma  in  relation  to  being  LGBTQ+, 
known  as  internalised  homophobia,36  which  can  lead 
to  adverse  impacts  on  their  self- perception  and  beliefs, 

which  could  then  enhance  suicidal  ideation,  behaviour 
or self- harm.37

Why this review is important
The goal of this systematic review is to comprehensively 
examine  risk  factors  for  self- harm  and  suicide  ideation 
and  behaviour  within  LGBTQ+  young  people.  Identi-
fying and understanding how these factors relate to self- 
harm and suicide could allow future research to address 
specific  risks  and  streamline  potential  studies  to  target 
the  mental  health  needs  of  this  population.  Previous 
reviews regarding various dimensions of self- harm22 23 38–40 
have  focused  on  a  specific  subgroup,  such  as  the  preva-
lence within transgender population41 or sexual orienta-
tion.42 Whereas, few have considered both self- harm and 
suicide  in  relation  to  LGBTQ+  populations  as  a  broad 
group.11  42–44  Thus,  this  review  not  only  takes  a  dimen-
sional  approach  to  include  self- harmful  thoughts  and 
behaviour  with  and  without  intent  of  suicide,  thereby 
covering  a  wide  spectrum  of  suicide  and  self- harm,  but 
also includes all sexual and gender minorities.

Objectives
1.  To examine risk factors associated with self- harm and 
suicide  ideation  and  behaviour  in  LGBTQ+  young 
people.

2.  To  examine  whether  there  is  a  difference  between 
sexual orientation minority young people and gender 
identity minority young people in the type of risk fac-
tors for self- harm, suicidal ideation and behaviour.

METhOdS
A  systematic  review  of  empirical  quantitative  studies 
which  examine  risk  factors  for  self- harm  and  suicidal 
ideation  and  behaviour  in  LGBTQ+  young  people  will 
be conducted. The search considered all studies up to 1 
April  2019,  a  summary  of  eligibility  criteria  is  shown  in

Scale (NOS)46 and the adapted version for cross- sectional 
studies.47

Eligibility criteria
See table 1 for summary:

Types of studies
These 
include  empirical  quantitative  peer- reviewed 
studies  following  cross- sectional,  prospective,  longitu-
dinal,  cohort  and  case–control  designs  which  examine 
risk  factors  for  self- harm  and/or  suicidal  ideation  and 
behaviour in LGBTQ+ young people. Risk factors being 
identified as significant predictors, mediators or moder-
ators  which  influence  a  self- harm  or  suicidal  outcome. 
These papers may specifically focus on one subgroup of 
the  LGBTQ+  umbrella  (eg,  transgender)  or  look  across 
groups  (eg,  LGB).  Mixed- method  papers  which  have 
applicable extractable information will also be included. 
Grey literature such as theses, dissertations or conference 
proceedings will not be included. Commentary, reviews, 
editorial  or  opinion  pieces  will  also  be  excluded.  All 
included  studies  must  be  available  as  full- text  and  peer- 
reviewed in the English language.

Types of participants
Participants between the ages of 12 and 25 years old, who 
identify  as  LGBTQ+  referring  to  how  one  self- identifies 
as their sex, sexuality, gender identity and gender expres-
sion.10  This  age  range  was  selected  to  mirror  papers 
within the field that consider young people up to the age 
of 25 years,9 48 with the lower limit extended to 12 years to 
include the adolescent period. Participants will also have 
had  experiences  of  self- harm  (self- injury  or  poisoning 
irrespective of suicidal intention4), suicide ideation (this 
can  include  thoughts  of  self- harm,  the  consideration  or 
planning  of  a  suicidal  attempt,  eg  method1)  or  suicidal 
behaviour  (intentionally  trying  to  end  one’s  own  life1). 
Alternatively,  if  participants  met  the  above  inclusion 
criteria as a subgroup, this data will be extracted.

Types of outcome measures
Studies  will  be  included  if  they  used  a  measure  for  self- 
harm,  suicidal  ideation  or  suicidal  behaviour.  The 
measurements of self- harm (any, with intent and without 
intent) and suicidal behaviour; attempt or death, will be 
taken as binary variables; present or absence. Continuous 
scales  for  suicidal  ideation  will  be  converted  to  binary 
variables  by  considering  the  original  scale  threshold. 
This will act as a cut- off point, if the population mean for 
ideation is above this threshold, ideation will be consid-
ered present, whereas below the threshold, ideation will 
be  considered  absent.  The  psychometric  measures  of 
these outcomes will be extracted for descriptive purposes. 
This  can  be  specific  tools  for  considering  suicide,  for 
example, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation;49 Motto’s Risk

of Statements about Self- injury;38 Self- Injurious Thoughts 
and  Behaviour  Interview  Short  Form.54  Also  included 
will  be  self- harm  or  suicide  items  from  general  scales 
such  as  items  102–105  from  the  Mental  Health  History 
Form (Boudewyn and Liem, 1995; Mental Health History 
Form)  or  individual  questions  regarding  self- harm  or 
suicide had ever been considered or acted on55 and clini-
cian reports.

Search strategy
The search was limited to English language and was run 
up  to  1  April  2019.  No  date  restrictions  were  applied. 
The  following  electronic  bibliographic  databases  were 
searched:  MEDLINE,  Scopus,  EMBASE,  PsycINFO  and 
Web  of  Science  for  peer- reviewed  publications  which 
examine  risk  factors  for  self- harm  or  suicide  within 
LGBTQ+ young people. The search strategy can be found 
in the online supplementary file 2. This was developed in 
collaboration  with  an  academic  skill  specialist  from  the 
University  of  Birmingham  library  to  ensure  the  robust-
ness of the search. Reference lists of eligible papers and 
conduct  citation  searches  of  key  papers  were  explored 
to  identify  additional  reports.  Before  the  final  draft  of 
the  systematic  review  is  completed,  a  second  search  will 
be  conducted  to  allow  for  any  additional  studies  to  be 
identified.

Study records
Selection process
The  search  strategy  will  retrieve  titles  and/or  abstracts 
which  will  be  screened  by  two  independent  researchers 
to  identify  studies  which  potentially  meet  the  inclusion 
criteria  outlined  above.  The  full- texts  of  the  studies  will 
be  retrieved  and  independently  assessed  for  eligibility. 
Any  disagreement  or  uncertainty  over  the  eligibility  of 
particular studies will be resolved through discussion by 
two independent researchers.

Data management and collection
Rayyan  QCRI  (https:// rayyan. qcri. org/ welcome),  the 
online systematic review tool, will be used to manage and 
screen  all  retrieved  papers.  AJW  will  be  the  solo  team 
member  responsible  for  adding  or  amending  paper 
records  in  Rayyan,  as  well  as  identifying  and  removing 
duplicates. A second independent reviewer will be given 
access  to  all  titles  and  abstracts,  within  Rayyan.  They 
will  be  able  to  make  their  own  decision  as  to  whether 
to include or exclude a paper, blind to AJW’s decisions. 
AJW  will  also  be  blind  to  the  decisions  of  the  second 
reviewer until all titles and abstracts are reviewed. Rayyan 
will provide information on the original number of titles 
screened, duplications, those excluded at this stage and 
those included titles at this stage.

Those  papers  which  reach  full- text  screening  will  be 
managed  within  Zotero  (https://www. zotero. org/), 
the  bibliographic  software.  These  will  be  sectioned  by 
those included at full- text screening, and final inclusion.

Reason  for  exclusion  will  be  reported  for  each  paper. 
AJW will be responsible for liaising with interlibrary loans 
and  obtaining  the  full- text  papers.  Full- text  screening 
will again be conducted by two researchers, blind to each 
other’s decisions, who will resolve disagreements through 
discussion. If an agreement cannot be reached regarding 
a paper, this will be rated by a third researcher.

A  prepiloted  standardised  data  extraction  tool  will  be 
adapted and used on included studies.56 Extracted infor-
mation will include (1) author and publication date; (2) 
study  design  and  setting;  (3)  characteristics  of  partici-
pants  (age,  gender  identity),  and  the  studies’  inclusion 
and  exclusion  criteria;  (4)  method  of  harm  (self- harm, 
suicidal  behaviour  or  ideation);  (5)  factors  associated 
with  or  predictive  of  self- harm  or  suicidal  ideation  and 
behaviour  (including  clinician  diagnosis,  subscales  or 
validated scales used to assess these items) and (6) infor-
mation relating to risk of bias for the individual study.

Risk of bias (quality assessment)
The overall quality of each study will be evaluated by two 
independent researchers using the NOS46 and the NOS 
adapted  for  cross- sectional  studies.47  Alternative  study 
designs, which are not covered in these versions of NOS, 
will be assessed using a prepiloted version developed for 
a previous systematic review.56 The level of agreement will 
be demonstrated by Cohen’s Kappa and a Prevalence and 
Bias- Adjusted Kappa score.

Data synthesis and assessment of heterogeneity
Included studies will be presented by grouping risk types 
together  (eg,  demographic,  psychosocial,  psychiatric 
or  mental  health).  The  descriptive  characteristics  of 
each  will  be  presented  in  tabular  format,  and  the  risks 
and outcomes of which will be discussed using narrative 
synthesis,  following  the  Economic  and  Social  Research 
Council  guidelines.57  The  analysis  will  take  place  over 
four steps; (1) developing a theory of which factors influ-
ence  LGBTQ+  young  people,  (2)  synthesising  the  find-
ings, (3) exploring whether there are relationships within 
the data and what these might be and (4) assessing the 
robustness of the synthesis.

If possible, a meta- analysis of risk factors for self- harm 
and  suicidal  ideation  and  behaviour  using  RevMan  5 
(https:// community. cochrane. org/ help/ tools- and- soft-
ware/ revman- 5/ revman- 5- download)  may  be  conducted 
by  pooling  data  on  risk  factors  using  a  random- effects 
model with the assumption that populations have various 
effect sizes and weights studies from in- study and between- 
study  variance.  These  risks  will  be  pooled  based  on  the 
analysis which has taken place in the original paper, if a 
risk appears in more than one type of analysis, it will be 
included in both analyses. These will consider the extent 
of  heterogeneity,  which  will  be  determined  using  the  I2 
statistic.  From  this,  a  summary  effect  will  be  presented, 
associated  95% CI  and  p  values.  OR  with  95%  CIs  will 
present  the  overall  synthesised  measure  of  effect  size.

Publication  bias  will  be  assessed  using  funnel  plots  and 
Harbord- Egger test.58

Additionally,  consideration  will  be  given  to  subgroup 
analysis if data allows, exploring heterogeneity by sexual 
and gender minorities; such that these studies are split by 
LGBQ and transgender; as even within this population it 
is recognised that the transgender population have high 
levels of suicide risk and self- harm.41 48 This will allow us 
to determine which risk factors are similar within sexual 
and gender minorities, and those that unique to the trans-
gender  population.  Further  examination  of  risk  factors 
will be conducted by age difference, split by 12–18 years 
and 19–25 years.

The quality of the included studies will be considered 
when synthesising and analysing the findings in terms of 
the strength of evidence which they provide. A sensitivity 
analysis  will  be  run  to  assess  the  robustness  of  included 
studies,59  following  the  removal  of  papers  which  score 
lower than 70% on quality assessment scales.

Patient and Public Involvement
No patients involved.

EThICS And dISSEMInATIOn
It will be submitted to a peer- reviewed journal, be publicly 
disseminated at conferences focusing on mental health, 
self- harm  and  suicide  prevention.  Findings  will  also  be 
shared  through  public  engagement  and  involvement, 
particularly considering young LGBTQ+ individuals.

dISCuSSIOn
This systematic review will be the first to provide a rich, 
holistic  account  of  the  existing  evidence  of  risk  factors 
for  self- harm  and  suicidality  within  a  broad  sample  of 
LGBTQ+  young  people.  The  synthesis  of  these  findings 
will  assess  the  prevalence  of  particular  factors  which 
impact this population, which may not be relevant to non- 
sexual or gender minority young people. However, when 
pooling studies within a meta- analysis, it is possible that 
the  variation  between  papers  may  cause  a  challenge  for 
this synthesis. This may be related to the broad approach 
in which we are approaching the systematic review, none-
theless  we  feel  that  this  approach  offers  many  values. 
Such  as,  exploring  the  similarities  and  differences  of 
risk  factors  by  subgroup  analysis,  via  sexual  orientation 
and gender identity or age, could be used as a valuable 
stepping stone when considering LGBTQ+ research and 
promoting more applicable research aims.

The quality and strength of the evidence will be rigor-
ously  assessed,  which  could  be  used  to  inform  future 
research targeting these particular risks. This could ulti-
mately  help  to  inform  self- harm  and  suicidality  preven-
tion within LGBTQ+ young people. It is anticipated that 
the findings of this review will be of interest to the wider 
academic  and  clinical  community,  policy- makers,  young
