Bidirectional causality between addiction and cognitive deficits

Research, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States

Abstract

Cognitive deficits are highly comorbid with substance use disorders. Deficits span multiple 
cognitive domains, are associated with disease severity across substance classes, and persist long 
after cessation of substance use. Furthermore, recovery of cognitive function during protracted 
abstinence is highly predictive of treatment adherence, relapse, and overall substance use 
disorder prognosis, suggesting that addiction may be best characterized as a disease of executive 
dysfunction. While the association between cognitive deficits and substance use disorders is 
clear, determining causalities is made difficult by the complex interplay between these variables. 
Cognitive dysfunction present prior to first drug use can act as a risk factor for substance 
use initiation, likelihood of pathology, and disease trajectory. At the same time, substance use 
can directly cause cognitive impairments even in individuals without preexisting deficits. Thus, 
parsing preexisting risk factors from substance-induced adaptations, and how they may interact, 
poses significant challenges. Here, focusing on psychostimulants and alcohol, we review evidence 
from clinical literature implicating cognitive deficits as a risk factor for addiction, a consequence 
of substance use, and the role the prefrontal cortex plays in these phenomena. We then review 
corresponding preclinical literature, highlighting the high degree of congruency between animal 
and human studies, and emphasize the unique opportunity that animal models provide to test 
causality between cognitive phenotypes and substance use, and to investigate the underlying 
neurobiology at a cellular and molecular level. Together, we provide an accessible resource for 
assessing the validity and utility of forward- and reverse-translation between these clinical and 
preclinical literatures.

Introduction

Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a significant global public health crisis. In 
the United States alone, the societal cost of SUDs has grown to be in excess of 740 
billion dollars annually (NIDA, 2020) and worldwide SUDs exceed all other mental health 
disorders in regard to premature mortality due to illness (Whiteford et al., 2013). Many 
treatments for SUDs focus on the management of withdrawal symptoms and the reduction 
of craving (Beck, Wright, Newman, & Liese, 1993; Haass-Koffler, Leggio, & Kenna, 2014; 
Myrick, Brady, & Malcolm, 2001; Perkins, Conklin, & Levine, 2008; Phillips, Epstein, 
& Preston, 2014; Veilleux, Colvin, Anderson, York, & Heinz, 2010), sequelae that are 
also heavily emphasized in the preclinical addiction literature (Becker, 2000; Lichtman &

Martin, 2002; Markou et al., 1993; Markou & Koob, 1991; Venniro, Caprioli, & Shaham, 
2016). Although treating withdrawal symptoms in abstinent patients is a critical step toward 
recovery, relapse often occurs long after these symptoms have subsided and therefore there 
is increasing interest in other mechanisms that outlast these processes. An ever-growing 
body of clinical research indicates that the dysregulation of executive function, a diverse set 
of cognitive processes responsible for purposeful, goal-directed behavior (Diamond, 2013), 
plays a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of SUDs. The prevalence of 
cognitive comorbidities across substance classes, their role in the initiation and maintenance 
of harmful patterns of substance use, and the long-lasting nature of these deficits compared 
to other consequences of drug use suggests that SUD may be best characterized as a disease 
of executive dysfunction.

Although it is indisputable that cognitive deficits are comorbid with SUDs, the relationship 
between the two is complex. It has long been held that prolonged exposure to substances 
of abuse, such as alcohol and psychostimulants, promote neuroadaptations that produce 
cognitive abnormalities. However, substantial evidence suggests that executive dysfunction 
is also a risk factor for SUDs, therefore making it difficult to determine the direction and 
nature of causality in between these variables in clinical populations. Given this complexity, 
animal models, where risk factors and exposure can be fully measured and controlled, offer 
unique advantages for probing the relationship between cognitive function and substance 
use.

Here we review the clinical evidence for the integral role of cognitive deficits in both the 
development and maintenance of stimulant use disorder (StUD) and alcohol use disorders 
(AUD), as well as survey insights from the clinical and preclinical literatures regarding the 
underlying neurobiological mechanisms mediating these deficits. We begin with an overview 
of clinical research examining the interplay between SUDs and cognitive deficits (for more 
exhaustive reviews see Bates, Bowden, & Barry, 2002; Domínguez-Salas, Díaz-Batanero, 
Lozano-Rojas, & Verdejo-García, 2016). Guided by this research, we then examine evidence 
from animal studies and discuss potential neural circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive 
deficits in SUDs. We focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) given its role in mediating 
cognitive processes and the extensive evidence linking substance use to dysregulation of 
PFC function and structure (for review of subcortical structures role in addiction see 
Everitt & Robbins, 2013; Koob & Volkow, 2010; Yager, Garcia, Wunsch, & Ferguson, 
2015), and limit our discussion to literature examining alcohol and psychostimulant use 
(for review of other compounds see Crean, Crane, & Mason, 2011; Gruber, Silveri, & 
Yurgelun-Todd, 2007; Jasinska, Zorick, Brody, & Stein, 2014; Klugman & Gruzelier, 2003). 
While cognitive deficits are commonly observed across SUDs (Rolland et al., 2019), we 
focus on psychostimulants and alcohol because they are well characterized in both the 
clinical and preclinical literatures, and therefore provide a suitable platform for comparing 
human and animal studies.

We highlight similarities in findings between preclinical and clinical investigations, which 
support the validity of animal models, and discuss areas that are understudied regarding the 
neuronal basis of these phenomena. Our goal is to provide a broad, accessible introduction to 
evidence from animal and human studies as to the relationships between cognitive function

and SUDs, and to provide a resource on the translatability of specific animal models by 
comparing these literatures.

2.  Cognitive deficits and SUDs: Clinical findings

SUDs are often associated with cognitive impairments spanning multiple domains including 
attention, memory, and executive function (Rolland et al., 2019; Stavro, Pelletier, & Potvin, 
2013; Verdejo-Garcia & Rubenis, 2020). Estimates indicate that between 30 and 80% of 
individuals with AUD (Bruijnen et al., 2019; Fein, Bachman, Fisher, & Davenport, 1990; 
Løberg & Miller, 1986; Martin, Adinoff, Weingartner, Mukherjee, & Eckardt, 1986; Meek, 
Clark, & Solana, 1989; Morgenstern & Bates, 1999) and 30–50% of individuals with StUD 
(Bruijnen et al., 2019; O’Malley, Adamse, Heaton, & Gawin, 1992; Rippeth et al., 2004; 
Vonmoos et al., 2013) exhibit some degree of cognitive impairment. Moreover, deficits 
are observed in laboratory-based decision-making tasks utilizing non-drug reinforcers 
demonstrating that these cognitive deficits represent a fundamental dysregulation of function 
that is not restricted to drug-associated contexts or decisions involving drug (Bechara et al., 
2001; Brière et al., 2019; Stout, Busemeyer, Lin, Grant, & Bonson, 2004; Verdejo-Garcia et 
al., 2007). Interest in substance-induced cognitive impairments has been further driven by 
findings that deficits, particularly in cognitive processes associated with executive function, 
are linked to poor clinical outcomes (Bates, Pawlak, Tonigan, & Buckman, 2006; Czapla 
et al., 2016; Domínguez-Salas et al., 2016; Goncalves et al., 2017). For example, deficits 
in basic (e.g., response inhibition) and higher-order executive functions (e.g., problem 
solving, decision making) are associated with early relapse and poor treatment adherence 
in AUD and StUD populations (Rolland et al., 2019; Rubenis, Fitzpatrick, Lubman, & 
Verdejo-Garcia, 2019; Stevens et al., 2014).

The PFC, a neocortical structure composed of several functionally and structurally diverse 
subregions, is critically involved in executive function (Diamond, 2013; Robbins, 1998; 
Stuss, 2011). In healthy adults, greater PFC volume and thickness is associated with better 
executive performance across a variety of neuropsychological tests (Burzynska et al., 2012; 
Yuan & Raz, 2014). In addition, the PFC is disproportionately impacted by prolonged 
use of alcohol and psychostimulants as compared to other brain regions (Chanraud et al., 
2007; Ersche, Williams, Robbins, & Bullmore, 2013; Goldstein & Volkow, 2011; Mackey 
& Paulus, 2013; Oscar-Berman, Kirkley, Gansler, & Couture, 2004; Pfefferbaum, Sullivan, 
Rosenbloom, Mathalon, & Lim, 1998; Volkow, Mullani, Gould, Adler, & Krajewski, 1988). 
Significant physiological and morphological differences are commonly observed in the 
PFC of individuals with AUD or StUD, often coinciding with impaired executive function 
(Chanraud et al., 2007; Dao-Castellana et al., 1998; Fein, Di Sclafani, & Meyerhoff, 2002; 
Goldstein & Volkow, 2002; Hanlon, Dufault, Wesley, & Porrino, 2011; Kim et al., 2006; Le 
Berre et al., 2014).

While it is clear that individuals with AUD and StUD display deficits in cognitive function 
concomitant with structural and functional dysregulation of regions involved with these 
processes, the extent to which deficits are caused by substance use can be difficult to 
parse. In fact, extant clinical research suggests that deficits in executive function present 
prior to first drug use (i.e., preexisting) serve as a risk factor that facilitates substance use

initiation and confers vulnerability to subsequent development of SUDs. At the same time, 
these preexisting deficits may be further exacerbated by substance-induced neuroadaptations 
(Fig. 1). Thus, to understand the complex interplay between cognitive deficits and SUDs, 
both directions of causality must be considered. Below we discuss the clinical evidence 
(1) implicating cognitive deficits as a risk factor for SUDs, and (2) as a consequence of 
prolonged substance use. We do not intend to be exhaustive in our review of the clinical 
literature; rather, we aim to provide an accessible overview for researchers outside of the 
immediate field, and to motivate our further discussion of questions that can be uniquely 
addressed by animal models (see Section 2).

3.  Clinical evidence linking executive dysfunction and addiction 

vulnerability

Many individuals are exposed to or actively use illicit drugs and alcohol, however 
only a relatively small subset of these individuals will develop a SUD in their lifetime 
(SAMHSA, 2019). Thus, to understand, treat, and prevent SUDs, it is imperative to identify 
behavioral and neurobiological features that may promote the initiation of substance use 
as well as those that confer resilience or susceptibility to the subsequent development 
of SUDs. Premorbid deficits in response inhibition (i.e., inhibitory control), one of the 
core executive functions alongside working memory and cognitive flexibility, have been 
consistently implicated in SUD vulnerability. Prospective studies have found that relatively 
poor performance on measures of response inhibition in individuals with minimal substance 
use history is predictive of the frequency and intensity of later substance use (Nigg et al., 
2006; Squeglia, Jacobus, Nguyen-Louie, & Tapert, 2014). Moreover, neuroimaging studies 
have consistently documented PFC hypofunction in individuals with SUDs during tasks 
involving response inhibition (Bolla et al., 2004; Fu et al., 2008; Morein-Zamir, Simon 
Jones, Bullmore, Robbins, & Ersche, 2013; Salo, Ursu, Buonocore, Leamon, & Carter, 
2009) and it is thought that decreased activation of the frontal lobe during these tasks may 
also serve as an important functional marker for susceptibility to problematic substance 
use. For example, during a go/no-go task in which respondents were required to respond to 
certain stimuli (go trials) and inhibit responding to others (no-go trials), decreased activity 
in multiple subregions of the PFC among adolescents was associated with transition to 
heavy alcohol use ~3 years later (Norman et al., 2011). Similarly, lower activation in the 
PFC during this task also has been shown to predict heightened substance use and SUD 
symptoms at an 18-month follow-up (Mahmood et al., 2013). Importantly, differences in 
task performance and PFC activation in these studies have typically been most pronounced 
during “no-go” trials, where the subject is required to inhibit a response, suggesting that 
vulnerability to SUDs is related to deficits in response inhibition rather than poor task 
performance in general.

For many individuals, substance use initiation begins during adolescence ( Johnston et al., 
2019), a critical transition period characterized by significant physical, social, emotional, 
and cognitive development as well as continued brain maturation including the refinement 
of connectivity in the PFC (Spear, 2013). Differences in cognitive performance across 
development provide a unique opportunity to examine the impact of cognitive function on

vulnerability to SUDs. For a variety of substances including alcohol and psychostimulants, 
age of first substance use is correlated with SUD prevalence whereby younger age of 
onset is associated with a greater likelihood of developing a SUD (Chen, Storr, & 
Anthony, 2009; Dawson, Goldstein, Chou, Ruan, & Grant, 2008; Flory, Lynam, Milich, 
Leukefeld, & Clayton, 2004; King & Chassin, 2007; Li, Duncan, & Hops, 2001; Lopez­
Quintero et al., 2011). Although many PFC-mediated cognitive processes continue to mature 
throughout adolescence, the protracted development of cognitive control, juxtaposed with 
a fully developed and hyperactive reward system, has been proposed to be an underlying 
factor in adolescent SUD vulnerability (Hammond, Mayes, & Potenza, 2014). Indeed, 
adolescents display high attraction to rewarding activities associated with novelty and 
sensation seeking and are less sensitive to negative outcomes of risky choices (Somerville 
& Casey, 2010). Moreover, prospective studies have demonstrated that high reward-seeking 
in conjunction with poorer working memory performance is predictive of early substance 
use progression and the ultimate development of SUDs (Khurana et al., 2015; Khurana, 
Romer, Betancourt, & Hurt, 2017). While these studies implicate PFC-mediated cognitive 
processes as important factors in vulnerability to problematic drug use, they also further 
highlight the difficulty of precisely parsing causal relationships between these variables in 
human subjects.

Many of the cognitive phenotypes implicated in addiction vulnerability are heritable traits 
and linked to family history of SUDs (Chassin, Pitts, & Prost, 2002; Clark, Cornelius, 
Kirisci, & Tarter, 2005; Friedman et al., 2008; Hill, Shen, Lowers, & Locke, 2000). Family 
history of SUDs is associated with deficits across multiple domains of executive function 
including cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and working memory (Corral, Holguín, 
& Cadaveira, 2003; Ersche, Jones, et al., 2012; Ersche, Turton, et al., 2012; Habeych, Folan, 
Luna, & Tarter, 2006; Nigg et al., 2006). For example, individuals from families with a 
history of alcoholism display less improvement in cognitive flexibility during development 
relative to those without a family history of alcoholism (Corral et al., 2003) as well as 
aberrant patterns of frontal lobe activation during response inhibition tasks (Schweinsburg 
et al., 2004; Silveri, Rogowska, McCaffrey, & Yurgelun-Todd, 2011). Along with cognitive/
behavioral traits, marked morphological abnormalities have been observed in individuals 
with a family history of alcoholism including reductions in brain volume and cortical 
thickness in frontal regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; Henderson et al., 2018; 
Hill et al., 2009). A recent, landmark longitudinal study revealed that reduced gray matter 
brain volume in the dorsolateral PFC and insular cortex, brain regions involved in cognitive 
processes including decision making, reasoning, response inhibition, and working memory 
(Krawczyk, 2002), was predictive of the initiation of alcohol drinking during adolescence 
and increased alcohol use during early adulthood (Baranger et al., 2020). These associations 
were found to be due to shared genetic factors and that genomic risk for greater alcohol use 
was enriched in genes that were preferentially expressed in the dorsolateral PFC (Baranger 
et al., 2020). Similarly, lower gray matter volume in the medial PFC of occasional stimulant 
users predicted future escalation of stimulant use (Becker et al., 2015), suggesting that 
deficits in cortical function confer vulnerability to SUD across substance classes.

Together, there is extensive evidence demonstrating that executive dysfunction as well as 
structural and functional abnormalities in the PFC often serve as premorbid factors that

facilitate problematic substance use. However, there is a clear need for further prospective 
investigations of prexisting individual differences in executive function, their role in SUD 
vulnerability, and how these phenotypes interact with substance-induced alterations in PFC 
function.

4.  Clinical evidence for substance-induced impairments in executive 

function

Although it is accepted that prolonged substance use contributes to functional and structural 
brain changes and subsequent cognitive impairments observed in SUDs, many clinical 
studies have relied heavily on cross-sectional designs that cannot fully dissociate the impact 
of drug-induced adaptations from preexisting differences. A prominent and often replicated 
finding is that greater substance use is associated with decline in brain volume in cortical 
regions as well as with extent of cognitive dysfunction (Albein-Urios, Martinez-González, 
Lozano, Clark, & Verdejo-García, 2012; Bechara et al., 2001; Bolla, Funderburk, & Cadet, 
2000; Fein, Klein, & Finn, 2004; Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2007). For example, heavy alcohol 
drinking in humans has been linked to widespread reductions in brain volume (Bjork, Grant, 
& Hommer, 2003; Paul et al., 2008; Pfefferbaum et al., 1998), decreased gray matter volume 
in the frontal lobe (Cardenas, Studholme, Meyerhoff, Song, & Weiner, 2005; Kubota et 
al., 2001; Pfefferbaum et al., 1998), and decreased neuronal density in the OFC (Miguel­
Hidalgo, Overholser, Meltzer, Stockmeier, & Rajkowska, 2006). Similarly, psychostimulant 
use is also associated with reductions in gray matter volume in multiple PFC subregions 
(Ersche et al., 2013). While there is no question that there is a robust relationship between 
excessive drug use, dysregulated cortical function, and cognitive deficits, as discussed in the 
previous section, it is important to consider that some of these effects may be driven by 
preexisting differences or may be a result of complex interactions with latent traits which 
ultimately determine the extent of cognitive dysregulation and propensity to develop a SUD.

One notable study examined cognitive performance in both recreational and dependent 
cocaine users who differed markedly in their patterns and amount of cocaine use (Vonmoos 
et al., 2013). Dependent cocaine users exhibited deficits in cognitive performance, including 
performance on tasks of executive function, relative to recreational users and cocaine­
naive individuals. Interestingly, cognitive performance in recreational cocaine users was 
intermediate to that of cocaine-dependent and cocaine-naive individuals (Vonmoos et al., 
2013). In order to parse the contribution of preexisting and substance-induced effects, a 
handful of longitudinal studies have sought to determine whether the degree of substance 
use is associated with morphological changes and cognitive deficits over time. A 5-year 
longitudinal study that tracked cortical gray matter and ventricular changes in men with 
AUD found that the amount of alcohol consumed throughout this period was predictive 
of sulci expansion and cortical gray matter loss that were most prominent in prefrontal 
and frontal regions (Pfefferbaum et al., 1998). Furthermore, high levels of daily alcohol 
consumption in older adults has been linked to a significant decline in global cognition, 
executive function, and memory over a 10-year period relative to light-to-moderate drinkers 
and alcohol abstainers (Sabia et al., 2014). Finally, in cocaine users, increased cocaine use

throughout a 1-year period was associated with a reduction in cognitive performance with 
the greatest impairments observed in working memory (Vonmoos et al., 2014).

Perhaps the strongest approach to isolating drug-induced volumetric and cognitive deficits 
in SUDs from preexisting differences comes from studies demonstrating that these 
deficits attenuate during protracted abstinence. In AUD, moderate impairments across 
multiple cognitive domains including executive functions, though persistent during early 
and intermediate sobriety, become less severe after a year (Stavro et al., 2013). This is 
in line with findings that alcohol-dependent individuals with an average of 6 years of 
sobriety display normal cognitive functioning (Fein, Torres, Price, & Di Sclafani, 2006). 
Improvements in verbal memory, executive function, and social cognition have been 
observed in methamphetamine-dependent individuals after 6 months of continued abstinence 
(Zhong et al., 2016). In cocaine users, decreased cocaine use has been associated with minor 
improvements in domains such as attention, declarative memory, and executive function, 
with the greatest improvements observed in individuals remaining abstinent at a one-year 
follow-up (Vonmoos et al., 2014).

In contrast to the delayed recovery of cognitive impairments in substance users, regional 
brain volume increases are evident during early abstinence and continue to improve over 
time. For example, volume increases occur during alcohol abstinence in multiple brain 
regions including the dorsolateral PFC, OFC, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula as early as 
1 month (Zou, Durazzo, & Meyerhoff, 2018), though improvements in cognitive function do 
not typically appear until later (discussed above). Importantly, while brain volume continues 
to increase in these brain regions during long-term abstinence from alcohol, rates of increase 
are at least 2.5 times higher during short-term vs. long-term abstinence indicating rapid 
abstinence-induced recovery of frontal and insular brain volumes among individuals with 
AUD (Zou et al., 2018). Furthermore, increases in gray matter in multiple cortical regions 
including the anterior and posterior cingulate, insula, and PFC are apparent during early 
cocaine abstinence and volumetric deficits are fully recovered in as little as 35 weeks 
after cessation of use (Connolly, Bell, Foxe, & Garavan, 2013). These findings suggest 
that cognitive improvements during abstinence may be contingent on the recovery of brain 
regions that subserve affected cognitive domains, but that behavioral recovery may lag 
significantly behind these morphological changes. Additionally, while evidence indicates 
that abstinence promotes the recovery of these domains which may, in turn, reduce the 
likelihood of relapse (Rolland et al., 2019; Rubenis et al., 2019; Stevens et al., 2014), 
questions remain as to whether comorbid cognitive impairments in SUDs are fully reversible 
and to what extent residual impairments are substance-induced. It is conceivable that 
preexisting deficits in executive function are still present throughout prolonged abstinence 
and therefore not only represent a risk factor for the development of SUDs but also a 
persistent obstacle in the path to recovery.

5. 

Insights from preclinical models

As summarized above, there is strong evidence supporting causality for cognitive deficits as 
a risk factor for SUDs and a consequence of substance use that maintains harmful behavioral 
patterns. Both directions of causality are accepted to be true. However, parsing the precise

contributions of preexisting and substance-induced deficits to SUDs, and investigating the 
neurobiology underlying the two phenomena, remains a challenge. The use of human 
subjects poses many roadblocks in the attempt to understand the bidirectional relationship 
between cognitive dysfunction and SUDs due to a multitude of factors, including the cross­
sectional nature of most studies, reliance on self-reports of prior substance use, and the sheer 
number of variables that must be controlled for. Preclinical studies in animal models, though 
not without their own limitations, can provide further insight into this relationship whereby 
a substance naive population can be studied longitudinally, while allowing complete 
experimenter control over the nature of substance exposure and measurements of cognitive 
dysregulation. Here, we review the wealth of preclinical literature that has contributed to 
our understanding of this complex relationship and highlight the congruency between animal 
and clinical studies.

6.  Phenotypic predictors of SUD vulnerability in animal models

While the majority of preclinical literature has examined neuroadaptations underlying drug­
induced cognitive impairments, there has also been substantial work probing the role of 
preexisting variation in a wide array of behavioral traits as predictors of later drug and 
alcohol self-administration behaviors. These investigations have implicated various aspects 
of cognitive function such as response inhibition and cognitive flexibility, corroborating and 
extending clinical findings linking preexisting cognitive deficits with vulnerability to SUDs 
(for an overview of the tasks used, see Fig. 2). Importantly, in preclinical studies history of 
substance use is assured, rather than self-reported, and propensity for substance use can be 
assessed independent from availability due to environmental factors.

As discussed previously, cognitive flexibility, a critical component of executive function that 
is broadly defined as the ability to make behavioral adaptations in response to changing 
environmental contingencies (Ragozzino, Detrick, & Kesner, 1999), is impaired in humans 
with AUD (Fein et al., 2006; Goudriaan, Oosterlaan, Beurs, & Brink, 2006) and StUD 
(Ersche, Roiser, Robbins, & Sahakian, 2008; Kim et al., 2006). In both humans and animals, 
commonly used tests of cognitive flexibility include reversal learning and set shifting 
(explained below). Importantly, evidence from lesion studies of rodents, humans, and non­
human primates indicate that performance on these tasks is dependent on the OFC and 
dorsolateral PFC (medial PFC in rodents) (Bissonette et al., 2008; Dias, Robbins, & Roberts, 
1996a, 1996b; McAlonan & Brown, 2003), indicating that these cognitive constructs have 
validity for cross-species comparisons.

In animal models, reversal learning is typically assessed in tasks wherein the animal learns 
that one type of response yields a reinforcer (e.g., food) while the other yields a negative 
consequence (e.g., a timeout period where food cannot be obtained or delivery of an 
electrical shock). After meeting a learning criterion, typically a high percentage of correct 
responses, the contingencies are then switched and the ability to quickly update behavioral 
strategies to match the new rules is used as a measure of cognitive flexibility (Fig. 2). Low 
cognitive flexibility indicated by poor performance in reversal learning tasks predicts various 
aspects of drug-taking behaviors in multiple model species [reviewed in (Izquierdo & 
Jentsch, 2012)]. For example, a higher latency to reach criterion after a contingency switch

(i.e., poor performance) is associated with faster acquisition of cocaine self-administration 
and higher administration rates across sessions in mice (Cervantes, Laughlin, & Jentsch, 
2013). Similarly, strain variation across recombinant inbred mice shows phenotypic overlap 
between poor performance in reversal learning and high levels of alcohol self-administration 
and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking (Laughlin, Grant, Williams, & Jentsch, 
2011; Loos, Staal, Smit, De Vries, & Spijker, 2013). Together, these findings provide further 
support for the idea that an impaired ability to update responding following a contingency 
switch is a predictor of heightened self-administration of both cocaine and alcohol.

Similarly, performance on set-shifting tasks is also predictive of future aspects of substance 
use in preclinical models. In this task, animals learn by trial and error to attend to a 
relevant cue in the environment (e.g., shape) while ignoring irrelevant cues (e.g., color) in 
order to receive a food reward. During an intradimensional shift, animals must maintain 
the attentional set by learning to ignore a previously reward-paired stimuli (e.g., triangle) 
to attend to another stimulus within the same dimension (e.g., circle). This attentional 
set is then challenged during the extradimensional shift wherein a previously irrelevant 
dimension (e.g., color) is now relevant. Importantly, this task can be easily applied across 
multiple species, including in humans as a variation of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, 
therefore presenting a highly translatable approach (Brown & Tait, 2016). In nonhuman 
primates, lower performance in set-shifting tasks is associated with higher overall preference 
for alcohol, reduced latency to reach maximum alcohol consumption, and higher overall 
intake (Shnitko, Gonzales, & Grant, 2019). While these results provide strong evidence 
that relationships between cognitive performance and SUD vulnerability can be faithfully 
recapitulated in a range of models, relatively little preclinical work has focused on neural 
circuit mechanisms mediating these effects prior to first drug use.

Response inhibition, the ability to suppress prepotent responses in order to select more 
appropriate goal-directed behaviors (Diamond, 2013), has been linked in both clinical and 
preclinical studies to measures of impulsivity, suggesting they may have similar underlying 
neural mechanisms (Dalley, Everitt, & Robbins, 2011; Franken, van Strien, Nijs, & Muris, 
2008; Horn, Dolan, Elliott, Deakin, & Woodruff, 2003; Izquierdo & Jentsch, 2012). 
Furthermore, like reversal learning performance, behavioral measures of impulsivity also 
have well-studied relationships with aspects of SUD vulnerability in animal models, both 
for psychostimulants and alcohol [reviewed in (Belin, Belin-Rauscent, Everitt, & Dalley, 
2016; Winstanley, Olausson, Taylor, & Jentsch, 2010)]. Performance in delay discounting 
tasks represents one commonly utilized measurement of impulsivity in both clinical and 
preclinical studies, which is shown to be predictive of aspects of substance use (Vanderveldt, 
Oliveira, & Green, 2016). In this paradigm, impulsivity is defined as the extent to which 
time reduces the subjective value (or reward magnitude) of a reinforcer. This is typically 
assessed by allowing the choice between a smaller reward that will be delivered immediately 
after the choice is made, or a larger reward that is delivered after a delay period. By varying 
the length of the delay, discounting of reward value as a function of time is assessed as a 
measure of impulsivity (Fig. 2) (Bizot, Le Bihan, Puech, Hamon, & Thiébot, 1999; Thiébot, 
Le Bihan, Soubrié, & Simon, 1985; Vanderveldt et al., 2016).

Early studies in the field found that impulsive performance in a delay discounting paradigm 
predicts higher alcohol consumption in rats (Poulos, Le, & Parker, 1995; Poulos, Parker, 
& Lê, 1998). Furthermore, when animals are selectively bred for alcohol preference, 
high-alcohol-preferring mouse strains exhibit steeper delay discounting curves (i.e., small, 
immediate rewards are preferred over large, delayed rewards), even when tested prior to 
first alcohol exposure (Oberlin & Grahame, 2009; Wilhelm & Mitchell, 2008). Impulsivity 
can also be measured using the five-choice serial reaction time task wherein an animal is 
required to select the correct nose-poke port following a brief presentation of a visual cue 
indicating which option is correct on that trial (typically a light in the response aperture), 
and withhold responding during the intertrial interval to maximize the number of reinforcers 
earned. However, it should be noted that impulsivity in this task, as measured by premature, 
anticipatory responses during the intertrial interval, does not appear to be related to alcohol 
preference (Peña-Oliver et al., 2015). Altogether, preexisting differences in impulsivity prior 
to alcohol exposure are predictive of subsequent AUD-like phenotypes in preclinical models, 
mirroring results in humans, but this relationship may be specific to subdomains within 
impulsivity or to sensitive to the methodology used to assess impulsivity.

Individual differences in impulsivity also map onto aspects of rodent psychostimulant use. 
In this body of work, multiple subdomains of impulsivity have been considered, such as 
attentional impulsivity/impulsive choice and motor impulsivity/inhibitory failure [(Robinson 
et al., 2009); reviewed in (Dalley et al., 2011)]. In rodents, attentional impulsivity is often 
defined as steeper delay discounting curves, while motor impulsivity is typically defined 
in reaction time tasks as high levels of anticipatory/premature motor response behaviors 
prior to the presentation of stimuli indicating that a reinforcer is available. For cocaine, high 
attentional impulsivity in delay discounting predicts faster escalation of self-administration 
(Anker, Perry, Gliddon, & Carroll, 2009; Perry, Larson, German, Madden, & Carroll, 2005; 
Perry, Nelson, & Carroll, 2008). Moreover, high motor impulsivity in the five-choice serial 
reaction time task predicts risk to develop compulsive cocaine-taking in outbred rats (Belin, 
Mar, Dalley, Robbins, & Everitt, 2008; Dalley et al., 2007), mirroring the clinical findings 
(Nigg et al., 2006). Impulsive performance in this task also correlates strongly with several 
facets of pathology-like psychostimulant-taking behaviors, including extinction resistance 
(Broos, Diergaarde, Schoffelmeer, Pattij, & De Vries, 2012), insensitivity to punishment 
(Belin et al., 2008), as well as higher reinstatement of cocaine-taking after punishment­
induced abstinence (Economidou, Pelloux, Robbins, Dalley, & Everitt, 2009).

In sum, individual differences in motor and attentional components of impulsivity appear 
to predict multiple aspects of drug-taking behavior across substance classes. Specifically, 
variation in attentional impulsivity has a strong relationship with the preliminary aspects of 
drug-taking, such as preference and escalation, while motor impulsivity predicts compulsive 
aspects of drug-taking, such as persistent drug use despite negative consequences. 
Collectively, these findings suggest that the two proposed components of impulsive behavior 
are indeed dissociable and should likely be examined separately. In further support of this 
notion, increased motor impulsivity in the five-choice serial reaction time task fails to 
predict alcohol preference (Peña-Oliver et al., 2015). Based on the above findings from the 
cocaine literature, motor impulsivity may instead be associated with likelihood of persistent 
alcohol seeking, though this remains to be tested. Overall, these results provide strong

7.  Substance-induced impairments in cognitive function in animal models

Animal models have provided valuable insight into the nature of substance-induced deficits 
in PFC function and associated cognitive deficits. Importantly, these studies can definitively 
parse preexisting traits from substance-induced deficits using longitudinal approaches where 
genetic and environmental backgrounds can be fully observed and controlled. Findings from 
this research have revealed that several facets of executive function shown to be impaired 
in individuals with SUD including cognitive flexibility (Chung et al., 2007; Errico, King, 
Lovallo, & Parsons, 2002; Ersche et al., 2008), response inhibition (Goudriaan et al., 2006; 
Lawrence, Luty, Bogdan, Sahakian, & Clark, 2009; Monterosso, Aron, Cordova, Xu, & 
London, 2005), and working memory (Albein-Urios et al., 2012; Ambrose, Bowden, & 
Whelan, 2001; Gonzalez, Bechara, & Martin, 2007), are similarly disrupted in rodents and 
non-human primates following exposure to substances of abuse.

Impaired cognitive flexibility has been observed in alcohol-exposed rodents across ages 
of exposure, length of exposure, and withdrawal time points. Chronic intermittent 
ethanol (CIE) exposure is a well-validated model of alcohol dependence where subjects 
are exposed to multiple cycles of high concentrations of alcohol vapor followed by 
abstinence/withdrawal periods (Avegno & Gilpin, 2019; Becker & Lopez, 2004; Gilpin, 
Richardson, Cole, & Koob, 2008; Lopez & Becker, 2005; Vendruscolo & Roberts, 2013). 
In rats, CIE exposure during adolescence produces set-shifting impairments in adulthood, 
enhanced alcohol-seeking behavior, and volumetric reductions in brain regions including 
the neocortex, thalamus, and hippocampus (Gass et al., 2014). Similar studies conducted in 
both mice and rats have also revealed that CIE exposure causes impairments in set-shifting 
performance assessed during brief abstinence (Kroener et al., 2012; Trantham-Davidson et 
al., 2014) while studies involving voluntary alcohol drinking have revealed reversal learning 
deficits in rats assessed following more prolonged abstinence periods (Charlton et al., 2019). 
Notably, these reversal learning deficits coincided with significant cortical cell loss in the 
OFC, medial PFC, and motor cortex (Charlton et al., 2019).

Similar to alcohol, exposure to psychostimulants produces persistent impairments in 
cognitive flexibility in rodents and non-human primates. In monkeys, both short-term (2 
weeks) or long-term (~5 years) exposure to experimenter-administered or self-administered 
cocaine, respectively, induced deficits in reversal learning (Gould, Gage, & Nader, 2012; 
Jentsch, Olausson, De La Garza, & Taylor, 2002). Interestingly, deficits in reversal learning 
following short-term exposure to cocaine were still evident after a month of abstinence 
( Jentsch et al., 2002). These findings are in agreement with studies in rats in which 
experimenter-administered or self-administered cocaine led to reversal learning deficits 
which persisted 1–3 months after drug cessation (Calu et al., 2007; Schoenbaum, Saddoris, 
Ramus, Shaham, & Setlow, 2004). Notably, the degree of reversal learning impairment 
induced by cocaine was indistinguishable from that induced by bilateral OFC lesions 
(Calu et al., 2007; Schoenbaum et al., 2004; Schoenbaum, Setlow, Nugent, Saddoris,

& Gallagher, 2003), suggesting that psychostimulants result in OFC-mediated deficits in 
cognitive flexibility in both rodents and non-human primates. In addition, performance on 
tasks of cognitive flexibility thought to be primarily mediated by the medial PFC (i.e., set 
shifting) are similarly disrupted in psychostimulant-exposed rodents. For example, in rats, 
methamphetamine self-administration induced set-shifting deficits that were comparable to 
those observed in animals with lesions to the dorsomedial PFC (Parsegian, Glen, Lavin, & 
See, 2011). Although it is tempting to conclude from any set of studies that drug-induced 
deficits in cognitive function can be localized to a single brain region, it is much more likely 
that deficits in the function of many regions converge to produce rigid behavioral strategies.

In addition to deficits in cognitive flexibility, animal models have also faithfully reproduced 
substance-induced deficits in working memory commonly observed in individuals with 
AUD and StUD during protracted abstinence (Chanraud et al., 2007; Fein et al., 2006; 
Gonzalez et al., 2007; Goudriaan et al., 2006; Rendell, Mazur, & Henry, 2009). Working 
memory refers to a cognitive system that allows for the temporary storage and manipulation 
of limited amounts of information required to perform complex cognitive tasks including 
planning, reasoning, and problem-solving (Cowan, 2014). Lesion studies in rodents and 
non-human primates have revealed that working memory is dependent on the dorsolateral 
PFC (medial PFC in rodents) (Tsutsui, Oyama, Nakamura, & Iijima, 2016). In both humans 
and animals, delayed match to sample and delayed non-match to sample tasks are commonly 
used to assess working memory performance. These tasks can vary significantly in exact 
methodology (Fitz, Gibbs, & Johnson, 2008; George et al., 2012; George, Mandyam, Wee, 
& Koob, 2008; Herndon, Moss, Rosene, & Killiany, 1997; Porter et al., 2011), but typically 
involve presenting the subject with a stimulus (in rodents this is often one arm of a T-maze) 
referred to as the sample. In a delayed match to sample task, the subject must then remember 
the sample stimulus through a given delay period before returning to the sample stimulus 
to receive a reward. In a delayed non-match to sample task, to receive a reward the subject 
must avoid the sample stimulus (for example by choosing the opposite arm of the T-maze) 
(Fig. 2). A similar task, termed spontaneous alternation, is also commonly used in rodents 
and relies on novelty rather than a food reward to reinforce behavior (Hughes, 2004).

In mice, voluntary alcohol drinking produced persistent deficits in working memory 
(Dominguez et al., 2017). Notably, these deficits were only evident in animals that 
underwent a prolonged period of abstinence and not those with continued alcohol access at 
the time of testing (Dominguez et al., 2017). Impairments in working memory performance 
have also been observed in rats on a delayed non-match to sample task during acute 
abstinence after intermittent, but not continuous, access to alcohol; however, these deficits 
were no longer apparent when tested during more prolonged abstinence periods (George 
et al., 2012). These findings suggest that alcohol-induced deficits in working memory 
in rodents may be most pronounced during acute withdrawal, as compared to during 
maintenance of drinking, but dissipate over protracted abstinence.

Regarding psychostimulants, long-term cocaine self-administration in non-human primates 
induced deficits on a delayed match to sample task when tested during acute abstinence 
(Porter et al., 2011). Furthermore, escalation of cocaine intake during extended access 
cocaine self-administration in rats was associated with working memory deficits on a

delayed non-match to sample task, while limited access self-administration was not 
(George et al., 2008). Working memory deficits during protracted abstinence from cocaine 
correlates with a lower density of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the dorsomedial 
PFC and oligodendrocytes in the OFC (George et al., 2008). As mentioned earlier, 
deficits in executive functions including working memory gradually improve with extended 
abstinence in human cocaine users (Vonmoos et al., 2014). Several studies in rodents 
and non-human primates have also revealed improvements in cocaine-induced working 
memory deficits following prolonged abstinence. For example, persistent impairments in 
working memory on a delayed alternation task, a measure of spatial working memory, 
were observed following short-term cocaine self-administration in rats that dissipated 
after 6 weeks of abstinence (Fijał, Nowak, Leśkiewicz, Budziszewska, & Filip, 2015). 
Additionally, non-human primates with long-term exposure to self-administered cocaine 
displayed improvements in working memory on a delayed match to sample task by 30 days 
of abstinence (Gould et al., 2012).

Taken together, these findings indicate that both alcohol and psychostimulant exposure 
across multiple animal models can induce significant impairments in PFC-mediated 
executive functions. This is consistent with clinical studies in humans that have found 
that individuals with SUDs commonly display signs of executive dysfunction and confirms 
that prolonged substance abuse induces cognitive deficits in addition to those that may 
be preexisting. In several animal studies, substance-induced impairments were comparable 
to those observed in animals that received selective damage to regions of the PFC that 
subserve these functions. Furthermore, multiple animal studies reported substance-induced 
impairments coincident with loss of cortical volume and reductions in cellular density in the 
PFC (Charlton et al., 2019; Gass et al., 2014; George et al., 2008), consistent with clinical 
observations (Fein et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2006; Le Berre et al., 2014). This is in agreement 
with studies revealing that individuals with SUDs display reduced markers of neuronal 
integrity and viability in the frontal lobe and PFC (Chang, Ernst, Strickland, & Mehringer, 
1999; Ernst, Chang, Leonido-Yee, & Speck, 2000; Xia et al., 2012) as well as reductions 
in brain volume and density in these regions (Hanlon et al., 2011; Matochik, London, 
Eldreth, Cadet, & Bolla, 2003; Nakama et al., 2011; Pfefferbaum et al., 1998; Pfefferbaum, 
Sullivan, Mathalon, & Lim, 1997). This suggests that substance-induced alterations to 
cognitive performance in animal models is associated with morphological and functional 
alterations to PFC with a high degree of similarity to alterations observed in individuals with 
SUDs, further supporting the utility of animal models for mechanistic investigations of these 
phenomena.

Notably, the aforementioned animal studies utilized a variety of methods to expose animals 
to alcohol and psychostimulants, and there is significant debate within the field as to which 
methods are most relevant for human addiction. While there is extensive nuances in the 
models used, and even how the same model/procedure is performed between laboratories, 
one major distinguishing feature is whether the drug is used voluntarily (i.e., the animal 
chooses to consume the drug, by pressing a lever to activate a syringe pump or licking 
a spout) or non-voluntarily (i.e., the experimenter chooses if the animal is exposed, via 
injection or filling the homecage with vaporized drug). It is clear that the complexities of 
SUDs cannot be captured in a single animal model, and that diversity of models to address

specific aspects of SUDs is a strength of the preclinical literature. That said, the differential 
impact of various exposure methods on behavioral and neuronal function is not trivial. 
Indeed, contingent vs. non-contingent drug exposure can produce distinct neuroadaptations 
and cognitive deficits (Schweppe et al., 2020; Wiskerke, Schoffelmeer, & De Vries, 2016). 
Taken together, the ability to specifically isolate and test specific aspects of SUDs is a 
unique strength of animal models, but the validity and caveats of these procedures should 
continue to be a matter of discussion and results that are consistent across models should be 
emphasized.

8.  Circuit mechanisms of substance-induced cognitive deficits

As summarized in the sections above, the structure and function of PFC is heavily impacted 
by psychostimulant and alcohol exposure. Animal models provide an avenue to investigate 
the specific neural circuits and transmitter systems involved in these adaptations at the 
cellular and molecular level (Siciliano & Tye, 2019; Spanagel, 2017). The degree of 
similarity in the behavioral impact of chronic drug use in humans and animals, discussed 
above, gives confidence that these models are appropriate for investigating the neurobiology 
underlying these phenomena. Here we provide a brief overview of circuit-specific drug­
induced adaptations that have been linked to cognitive deficits in animal models and 
highlight further convergence with findings in human subjects.

The mesolimbic dopamine system has been extensively implicated in the reinforcing and 
rewarding aspects of drugs and alcohol as well as craving and seeking (Di Chiara & 
Imperato, 1988; Nestler, 2005; Siciliano, Calipari, Ferris, & Jones, 2015). In contrast, 
mesocortical dopamine projections that originate in the midbrain and terminate in the 
PFC are believed to serve a crucial role in many cognitive processes and in deficits 
induced by chronic psychostimulant or alcohol use. The PFC, which is composed mostly 
of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, relies on a balance of 
excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission for normal physiological and cognitive function. 
Activity in both of these cell types is modulated via release of dopamine from presynaptic 
terminals arising from cell bodies in the midbrain. Once released, dopamine acts on D1 and 
D2-type dopamine receptors located both postsynaptically on interneurons and pyramidal 
neurons and presynaptically on cortical inputs from upstream regions and interlaminar 
lateral connectivity (Benes & Berretta, 2001; Gao, Krimer, & Goldman-Rakic, 2001; 
Paspalas & Goldman-Rakic, 2005; Seamans & Yang, 2004; Vander Weele, Siciliano, & 
Tye, 2019). Human neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated that individuals 
with SUDs exhibit abnormal patterns of PFC activity under baseline conditions, while 
performing cognitively demanding tasks, and during exposure to drugs and drug-associated 
cues that often differ between subregions (Bolla et al., 2003; Childress et al., 1999; Ersche 
et al., 2005; Goldstein et al., 2007; Goldstein & Volkow, 2002; Grant et al., 1996; Kilts 
et al., 2001; London, Ernst, Grant, Bonson, & Weinstein, 2000; Paulus et al., 2002; Salo 
et al., 2009; Volkow et al., 1992, 2005). For example, stimulant-dependent individuals 
commonly display greater activation in the OFC and reduced activation in the medial and 
dorsolateral PFC during decision making tasks (Bolla et al., 2003; Ersche et al., 2005). Such 
observations may be due, in part, to substance-induced alterations in dopamine signaling 
(Volkow et al., 2001, 1993, 1996) and further evidence suggests that preexisting variation in

dopamine signaling may confer susceptibility or resiliency to SUDs in humans (Volkow et 
al., 2006).

In animal models, dysregulated dopamine release and receptor function in the medial PFC 
is associated with impairments in multiple cognitive domains including working memory, 
cognitive flexibility, and decision making (Floresco, 2013). Notably, mesolimbic and 
mesocortical dopamine neurons undergo contrasting plasticity after exposure to substances 
of abuse (Lammel, Ion, Roeper, & Malenka, 2011). Growing evidence suggests that 
alterations in dopamine release in the PFC in conjunction with a reduced ability of dopamine 
receptors to modulate neuronal activity in this region are a major factor mediating substance­
induced deficits in executive function. For example, chronic alcohol exposure is associated 
with reduced firing of midbrain dopamine neurons and decreased dopamine transmission in 
the dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and OFC (Narendran et al., 2014; Trantham-Davidson 
& Chandler, 2015) whereas repeated exposure to methamphetamine is associated with 
progressive cell death and reductions in dopamine terminal density in the medial PFC 
(Kadota & Kadota, 2004). Amphetamine and cocaine have also been demonstrated to reduce 
the influence of midbrain dopamine neuron activation on postsynaptic excitability in medial 
PFC neurons (Nogueira, Kalivas, & Lavin, 2006; Tse, Cantor, & Floresco, 2011). Together 
these data suggest that alcohol and psychostimulants significantly disrupt dopaminergic 
regulation of the PFC. Moreover, reduced expression and impaired function of dopamine 
receptor subtypes in the medial PFC have been linked to deficits in executive function 
in cocaine and alcohol-exposed rodents during abstinence (Briand et al., 2008; Trantham­
Davidson et al., 2014). These substance-induced deficits are likely mediated, in part, by 
impaired dopamine receptor modulation of excitatory inputs to the PFC. For example, 
repeated amphetamine exposure has been shown to diminish the ability of D1 and D2 
receptors to modulate basolateral amygdala inputs to medial PFC during abstinence in 
rodents that exhibited impaired decision making (Tse et al., 2011). Similar alterations may 
also disrupt hippocampal- PFC circuits involved in working memory (Seamans, Floresco, & 
Phillips, 1998).

Changes in dopaminergic activity as well as many other systems converge to ultimately 
produce dysregulated and aberrant activity of cortical neurons. Indeed, methamphetamine- 
induced alterations in neuronal firing patterns in the dorsomedial PFC have been associated 
with impaired set-shifting performance and enhanced drug seeking (Parsegian et al., 2011) 
while rescue of cocaine-induced reductions in medial PFC excitability decreased compulsive 
drug-taking behavior (Chen et al., 2013). Similarly, rescue of cocaine-induced reductions 
in OFC excitability ameliorates deficits in Pavlovian summation in rats, thought to be a 
measure of insight or reasoning (Lucantonio et al., 2014). Interestingly, activity and synaptic 
connectivity in distinct PFC subregions are uniquely affected by psychostimulants such 
as cocaine and amphetamine. For example, repeated exposure to amphetamine produced 
enhanced inhibitory and excitatory responses in the medial PFC and OFC, respectively, 
that were associated with progressive impairments in instrumental responding (Homayoun 
& Moghaddam, 2006). Furthermore, amphetamine and or cocaine exposure increase the 
number of dendritic branches and the density of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons 
in the medial PFC and medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens, effects that are 
still evident after a month of abstinence (Crombag, Gorny, Li, Kolb, & Robinson, 2005;

Robinson, Gorny, Mitton, & Kolb, 2001; Robinson & Kolb, 1997, 1999). This is in contrast 
to the OFC where amphetamine reduces spine density (Crombag et al., 2005). Mirroring 
findings in clinical studies examining risk factors for SUDs (Baranger et al., 2020), the 
activity in medial PFC during initiation of alcohol use is a marker of compulsive drinking 
vulnerability in mice (Siciliano et al., 2019).

One plausible take away from these findings is that substance-induced alterations to PFC 
structure and function commonly found in SUDs are, in part, a consequence of impaired 
dopamine neuromodulation of PFC neuronal networks and region-specific changes in 
synaptic connectivity. The combined influence of these changes could drastically impact 
excitatory drive in the PFC leading to behavioral inflexibility and impaired decision making 
that may ultimately undermine rehabilitation efforts and increase risk of relapse. While 
preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that executive functions are compromised 
in a variety of animal models following both short- and long-term exposure to alcohol and 
psychostimulants, a more robust understanding of the neural circuitry involved and how 
substance-induced neuroadaptive changes evolve over time is needed.

9.  Concluding remarks

While animal studies have greatly expanded our knowledge of the circuit mechanisms 
mediating drug and alcohol-induced cognitive deficits, this realm is dramatically 
understudied in the preclinical literature in comparison with drug-taking and seeking 
processes. Both clinical and preclinical studies are needed to develop a comprehensive 
understanding of how addiction impacts the brain to elucidate what areas of cognition are 
both predictive of subsequent use and most affected by continued use. Extensive clinical 
research so far has cogently demonstrated that PFC-mediated executive dysfunction and 
impulsivity are most heavily impacted by continued substance use, and cross-sectional work 
further indicates dysfunction in these faculties may confer individual vulnerability to SUD 
development, particularly during adolescence when substance use is most often initiated. 
Meanwhile, preclinical studies can effectively recapitulate these phenotypes in animal 
models, allowing us to address questions of causality, illuminate underlying mechanisms, 
as well as characterize the longitudinal nature of these deficits.

However, there is still much we do not understand. While years of research have illuminated 
how drugs of abuse hijack natural reinforcement circuitry and drive maladaptive behaviors, 
there is still a lack of understanding why only a subset of individuals that experiment 
with these drugs will go on to develop an addicted phenotype. There is a strong need 
for more longitudinal work from the clinical research side, which contends with issues of 
subject recruitment and continued retention, to understand the complex and bidirectional 
factors that lead an individual to develop these problematic patterns of use and identify how 
substances can confer vulnerability to relapse through exacerbated executive dysfunction. 
Understanding the longitudinal nature of these cognitive deficits, both prior to and after 
exposure, can then inform experimental design in the preclinical realm, and lead to greater 
understanding and enhanced treatment development. Additionally, in the preclinical field, 
much work is needed to delineate the distinct nature of the relationships among the various 
classes of drugs and across the lifespan. Due to technical limitations, including issues with

Interplay between cognitive function, drug use, and addiction outcomes. Variation in 
cognitive function prior to initial substance use is a critical factor influencing the likelihood 
of initiation and maintenance of harmful patterns of substance use. Substance-induced 
neuroadaptations may exacerbate premorbid cognitive deficits or promote the development 
of cognitive deficits in cognitively normal individuals. Deficits far outlast acute phases of 
withdrawal and associated negative affect, serving as an enduring risk factor in addiction 
recovery, and recovery of cognitive function during abstinence is associated with lower rates 
of relapse; therfore, treatments targeting cognitive dysfunction may significantly improve 
clinical outcomes.

Behavioral tasks commonly used to assess cognitive function in rodents. Reversal learning 
tests how quickly rodents can learn a contingency switch as a measure of cognitive 
flexibility. In the delayed match/non-match to sample task, which is used to measure 
working memory, animals are shown a sample stimulus and are required to remember the 
sample throughout a delay period. To receive a reward, they must then return to the sample 
stimulus (delayed match to sample task) or avoid the sample (delayed non-match to sample 
task). In delay discounting, animals choose between responding for a small reward delivered 
immediately or a larger reward delivered after a delay period. Here, impulsivity is measured 
by how strongly reward magnitude is discounted as a function of wait time. The five-choice 
serial reaction time task can also be used to assess impulsivity. In this task, animals 
must withhold responding until the correct response is indicated by brief illumination of 
a port. Animals must quickly respond after the presentation and the frequency of premature 
responses is used as a measure of impulsivity. Set shifting is a complex task that requires the 
subject to learn a set of rules presented within complex stimuli (e.g., the presence of parallel 
lines indicates the target stimulus) while ignoring irrelevant features (e.g., the shape of the 
visual stimulus). Intradimensional shifts where the initial rule is altered (e.g., perpendicular 
lines become the target) or extradimensional shifts where the initial rule is replaced by an 
entirely new rule (e.g., stimulus shape becomes the relevant feature) are introduced accross 
sessions and the animals’ ability to update behavior is assessed as a measure of cognitive
