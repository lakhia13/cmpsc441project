Abstract

This study aggregated data from three randomized control trials to explore the differential efﬁcacy of three forms of
exposure therapy, namely, in vivo (iVET), virtual reality (VRET), and augmented reality (ARET), in the treatment
of small animal phobia. Additionally, baseline patient characteristics were used to detect subgroups of patients who
showed a differential response to certain treatment modalities. Primary measures were distance covered, anxiety
during the behavioral avoidance test (BAT), and overall fear of small animals. A repeated-measures analysis of
variance was used to explore the overall treatment effect across the exposure modalities. A cluster analysis and an
analysis of moderation were conducted to explore differential response to treatments. The main study ﬁnding was
that the three treatment conditions were similarly efﬁcacious in the treatment of small animal phobia for all study
outcomes. Only for distance covered, our results revealed a tendency for iVET to be more effective than VRET and
ARET in participants with worse performance on the BAT before treatment. The present study ﬁndings provide
further evidence for the comparable efﬁcacy of the three forms of exposure. Our results also suggest that, overall,
treatments are likely to be similarly effective, regardless of the individual baseline characteristics (i.e., fear, anxiety,
and age), whereas pretreatment scores on distance covered in the avoidance test might be used to personalize
treatments (iVET may be preferable when participants perform worse at pretreatment).

Introduction

Animal phobia (i.e., insects, snakes, birds, or other ani-

mals) is one of the most prevalent forms of speciﬁc pho-
bias, especially in women. Lifetime rates of this disease range
from 5 percent to more than 12 percent, depending on the study,
with the highest prevalence rates in young adults.1–4

In vivo exposure therapy (iVET) is the treatment of choice
for speciﬁc phobias, including animal phobia, as it has been
shown to outperform all other forms of nonexposure psycho-
social treatment. However, other forms of exposure treatment,
such as virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), have been

found to be just as efﬁcacious as iVET,5 especially on post-
treatment followup measures.6

Virtual reality and augmented reality are two technologies
that can be used as alternatives to iVET. In the former, the
patient is asked to interact with a computer-generated, three-
dimensional environment or object. In the latter, a computer-
generated virtual object is superimposed onto reality. Thus,
while both technologies have the ability to enhance or enrich
an experience using artiﬁcial, computer-generated elements,
they differ in their purpose. Speciﬁcally, while virtual re-
ality aims at transporting the user to a different location
by substituting the existing physical environment with a

virtual one, thus creating an immersive effect, in aug-
mented reality the virtual elements are the ones that are
transported into the user’s location and added to the user’s
world, arguably resulting in a different quality of the
experience.7,8

The use of these alternative forms of exposure (i.e., virtual
reality and augmented reality) has been found to have some
advantages over traditional iVET. For instance, some clini-
cians and patients are reluctant to use iVET because they ﬁnd
it cruel.9,10 In fact, there is evidence suggesting that virtual
reality has a much lower refusal rate than in vivo treatment.11
In addition, VRET and augmented reality exposure therapy
(ARET) offer ecological treatments when the availability of
the feared stimuli is limited.12

There is currently extensive evidence for the effective-
ness of VRET and ARET in the treatment of a wide range of
mental disorders.13,14 For instance, their use is now sup-
ported in post-traumatic stress disorder15,16 and anxiety
disorders,17–19 including panic disorder, social anxiety dis-
order, and speciﬁc phobias.

Despite the shared advantages of ARET and VRET over
iVET (e.g., safety, control over the scenario and the stimuli,
and easy use in repeated training), both technologies present an
important difference that might inﬂuence the experience of
exposure and, ultimately, the efﬁcacy of interventions. Speci-
ﬁcally, ecological validity is higher in augmented reality, as the
feared element is embedded in the real environment of the
individual. Consequently, the user is allowed to use his/her own
body to interact with the virtual object as opposed to partici-
pating via a virtual representation of his/her body, as in virtual
reality.7,20 Also importantly, augmented reality only requires a
few elements to be developed, thus resulting in reduced pro-
duction costs when compared with virtual reality, which makes
it an attractive technology for research and clinical purposes.
The extent to which the aforementioned differences be-
tween ARET and VRET ultimately result in differential ef-
ﬁcacy scores in small animal phobia is still unclear. There is
extensive literature showing that VRET can effectively re-
duce symptoms and avoidance in small animal fear.21 There
is also some recent evidence to suggest that ARET can ef-
fectively induce and reduce anxiety and fear and increase the
ability to interact with the feared small animal (e.g., spider or
cockroach).22–25 However, studies into small animal phobia
have rarely compared the effectiveness of more than one
treatment modality in the same investigation, so the differ-
ential effects of ARET and VRET, and the ability of both
technology-based forms of exposure to become alternatives

to traditional iVET in the treatment of small animal phobia
require further investigation.

To date, some previous evidence suggests that alternative
forms of exposure and traditional iVET are equally effective,5
especially at followup.6 However, this latter meta-analysis
did not report separate effect sizes for the different forms of
alternative exposure treatments (i.e., imaginal exposure, cave
automatic virtual environment (CAVE), and VRET), and
neither of the two meta-analyses included data on augmented
reality, so the beneﬁts of using an arguably more ecological
technology (i.e., augmented reality) in front of iVET and
VRET remain speculative. Moreover, it is still unclear whe-
ther certain treatments might be more beneﬁcial for a certain
subset of patients (i.e., moderation). The goal of this study is
twofold. First, we will compare the efﬁcacy of three treatment
modalities, namely, traditional iVET, VRET, and ARET,
which have shown to be effective across investigations but
have never been studied together in small animal phobia.
Second, we will investigate differential treatment efﬁcacy as
a function of baseline patient characteristics, which would
allow us to recommend a speciﬁc treatment for a given patient
(i.e., personalized therapy). In the light of the reviewed re-
search, we expect iVET and alternative treatments (VRET
and ARET) to reduce fear, anxiety, and avoidance. We an-
ticipate that differences in effectiveness across treatment
modalities, if existent, will be small. Finally, the existence of
subgroups of patients that preferably respond to one of the
treatments is merely exploratory at this stage, so no hypoth-
eses are provided.

Methods

Research design and procedure

In this study, three datasets from previously published ran-
domized controlled trials from our team were compared.26–28
A summary of the studies included is shown in Table 1. All the
studies included a VRET, an ARET, or an iVET group.

In all studies, participants were mostly university students
either recruited via introductory Psychology classes or using
advertisements around the university campus and mails to
university community members.26–28 Once eligibility was
ensured, which broadly included the presence of a small an-
imal phobia and the physical and mental ability to participate
(see each original study for a more detailed description of the
inclusion criteria), participants were randomly assigned to an
experimental condition by an independent researcher. Then,

assessment was made before and after treatment (see the
Measures and the Treatment sections below).

Measures

Behavioral avoidance test. The behavioral avoidance
test (BAT) is an objective, observational test of the patient’s
behavior, to measure clinical progress in overcoming pho-
bias through exposure to the feared object.29 In all the
studies, a sealed container containing a live cockroach or a
spider was placed on a table inside a room. Participants
were asked to enter the room and approach the spider as
much as they could. Then, the distance covered was mea-
sured, and participants were asked to rate their anxiety level
during the test. In Botella et al.26 and Garcı´a-Palacios
et al.,28 the distance left to cover was measured in meters,
whereas in the study by Hoffman et al.,27 the distance left to
cover was measured in feet. In Garcı´a-Palacios et al.28 and
Hoffman et al.,27 a 101-point measure of anxiety was ob-
tained, where 0 represented no anxiety, and 100 reﬂected
extreme anxiety. The study by Botella et al.26 used an 11-
point scale ranging from 0 (no anxiety) to 10 (extreme
anxiety).

The BAT was performed in a separate room from the
treatment room. During the test, the experimenter waited
outside the door to minimize the impact of his/her presence.
Participants were informed that the BAT was used as an
objective measure of their fear, and not as part of the therapy.

Fear of Spiders Questionnaire.

Items on the Fear of
Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) are designed to assess pa-
tients’ anxiety about spiders. In the study,26 the instructions
were changed so that participants with fear of cockroaches
referred to their feared small animal (i.e., cockroaches).30
Two of the studies used the full version of the FSQ,26,28
which consists of 18 items, whereas Hoffman et al.27 used a
reduced 6-item version. The same response scale, ranging
from 1 (does not apply to me) to 7 (very much applies to
me), was used in all cases. The FSQ has obtained excel-
lent reliability and validity results in previous research.31
The FSQ was administered both before and after exposure
treatment.

Treatment

All studies used exposure therapy for treatment, which
is the recommended and evidence-based treatment for
small animal phobia.32 The treatment aims at exposing
participants to phobic situations in a controlled, gradual,
and planned manner so that the fear is tolerated and the
negative thoughts associated with the feared object and its

consequences are disconﬁrmed. Of course, the treatment
was applied differently across conditions. Speciﬁcally,
when there was an iVET group,26 these participants were
exposed to real animals (i.e., live spiders or cockroaches),
while those in the VRET and ARET condition26,27,28 were
exposed to computer-generated animals using a virtual or
an augmented system, respectively. The assessment of
anxiety and distance covered with the BAT was performed
using live animals irrespective of treatment condition, as
recommended in guidelines.29

Therapists included expert clinicians and PhD students
who were trained and supervised by senior clinicians to
ensure the ﬁdelity to the treatment requirements (e.g., ses-
sions were recorded and weekly meetings were planned).
As exposed above, before and after the treatment we ad-
ministered the assessment protocol described in the Mea-
sures section.

Equipment

Patients in the VRET used a Silicon Graphics Octane
MXE device with Octane Channel Option coupled with a 40(cid:2)
vertical · 105(cid:2) horizontal ﬁeld of view (40(cid:2) overlap). The
position of the head, hand, and virtual animal was measured
with the Polhemus(cid:3) Fastrak tracking system.

Augmented reality was displayed using two devices: (a)
the AR 5DT Head-Mounted Display with an 800 · 600 res-
olution, a 40(cid:2) angle of view, and an embedded NX-Ultra
video camera; and (b) Vuzix VR Goggles with a 640 · 480
resolution, a 30(cid:2) ﬁeld of view, and a camera attached to it.

Data analysis

First, all the variables were standardized to compare scores
using different scales and numbers of items. The formula used
was z = (X - l)/r, where z is the standardized score with a
mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, X is the score that has to
be converted, l is the sample mean, and r is the standard
deviation.

Baseline imbalance was explored for all study outcomes
(i.e., fear of the small animal, anxiety, and distance left to
cover), to decide whether covariates would be needed in the
repeated-measures analysis.33 As Table 2 shows, baseline
scores were comparable across conditions, and so there was
no need to control for baseline ratings in the repeated-
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the ANOVA,
time and treatment condition were the within- and between-
subject factors, respectively. Fear, anxiety, and distance
were the dependent variables.

Finally, a series of two-step cluster analyses were performed
to explore whether there were groups of cases in the data (i.e.,

analysis, the condition was included as a categorical variable.
Three cluster analyses were performed, one for each outcome
variable. For each outcome, pretreatment and posttreatment
ratings of that outcome were included as continuous variables.

Results

The ﬁnal sample consisted of 91 participants, including 32
from the ARET condition, 28 from the VRET condition, and
31 from the iVET condition.

As seen in Table 2, which presents the sociodemographic
and clinical characteristics of the sample, most individuals
were highly educated, young, and female.

Table 3 shows the participants’ median scores for all study
outcomes across conditions, along with the results of the
baseline imbalance test. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and
Levene’s test revealed that assumptions of parametric data
were violated (i.e., normality and homogeneity of variance).
Hence, baseline imbalance across the three conditions was
explored by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test, which indicated
that baseline scores were comparable across conditions for
all outcomes [Hdistance (2) = 1.45, p = 0.485; Hanxiety (2) = 0.78,
p = 0.676; Hfear (2) = 1.84, p = 0.399], and so there was no need
to use baseline scores of study outcomes as covariates in the
repeated-measures ANOVA.

As Table 4 shows, the repeated-measures ANOVA revealed
a signiﬁcant effect of time for all study outcomes, namely,
fear, F(1, 88) = 529.26, p < 0.001, anxiety, F(1, 88) = 90.96,
p < 0.001, and distance, F(1, 88) = 109.33, p < 0.001. There
was a decrease in fear (Mpretreatment = 0.82, Mposttreatment =
-0.82), anxiety (Mpretreatment = 0.52, Mposttreatment = -0.52), and
(Mpretreatment = 0.56, Mposttreatment =
distance left
-0.56) over time. The largest change was revealed for fear

Table 4 shows that the time · condition effect was not
signiﬁcant for any of the study outcomes, indicating com-
parable effects for VRET, ARET, and iVET.

Cluster analysis

The same three-factor solution was obtained for anxiety
(condition = categorical variable; pretreatment and post-
treatment anxiety = continuous variables) and fear (condi-
tion = categorical variable; pretreatment and posttreatment
fear = continuous variables). Each cluster corresponded to
one treatment condition (1 = ARET, n1 = 32; 2 = VRET,
n2 = 28; and 3 = iVET, n3 = 31). Median pretreatment anxiety
scores were Mdn1 = 0.54, Mdn2 = 0.37, and Mdn3 = 0.90.
Median posttreatment anxiety ratings were Mdn1 = -0.19,
Mdn2 = -0.49, and Mdn3 = -0.92. Median pretreatment fear
scores were Mdn1 = 0.80, Mdn2 = 1.02, and Mdn3 = 0.72.
Average posttreatment ratings for fear were Mdn1 = -0.77,
Mdn2 = -0.77, and Mdn3 = -0.79.

The cluster analysis for distance (condition = categorical
variable; pretreatment and posttreatment distance = continu-
ous variables) revealed a four-factor solution. Cluster 1 in-
cluded all iVET participants (n1 = 31). Clusters 2 and 4
included the majority of the ARET (n2 = 29) or VRET par-
ticipants (n4 = 25). The third cluster included six participants
(10 percent of the total sample), three from the ARET con-
dition and three from the VRET group. Median pretreatment
distance scores for clusters 1–4 were Mdn1 = 0.63, Mdn2 =
0.63, Mdn3 = 1.89, and Mdn4 = 0.63. Median scores at post-
treatment were Mdn1 = -0.68, Mdn2 = -0.67, Mdn3 = 1.07,
and Mdn4 = -0.77. A graphical representation of this four-
factor solution is shown in Figure 1. The graphical display
suggested that the common feature of individuals in cluster
3 might be poor posttreatment performance. Indeed, the
Kruskall-Wallis test revealed a difference between clusters
in distance covered at posttreatment, H(3) = 31.59, p < 0.001, but

not at pretreatment, H(3) = 3.63, p = 0.305. A post hoc Mann-
Whitney test revealed a difference in posttreatment distance
when comparing clusters 1 and 3 (U < 0.01, Z = -5.61,
p < 0.001), 2 and 3 (U < 0.01, Z = -5.80, p < 0.001), and 3
and 4 (U < 0.01, Z = -3.76, p < 0.001). Effect sizes of these
differences in posttreatment distance were calculated (r = Z/On).
All differences were found to be large (r13 = -0.92, r13 = -0.98,
and r13 = -0.68).

We compared differences in baseline measures between
cluster 3 and the other three clusters together (n = 85) to better
understand the poorer performance in posttreatment distance
covered. We did not ﬁnd group differences in age (U < 223.50,
Z = -0.51, p = 0.613), duration of fear (U < 195.00, Z = -0.76,
p = 0.764), pretreatment anxiety (U < 246.50, Z = -0.14,
p = 0.891), or pretreatment fear (U < 183.00, Z = -1.15,
p = 0.249). We found a nonsigniﬁcant trend for pretreat-
ment distance (U < 143.50, Z = -1.80, p = 0.072).

Median distances covered at pretreatment in cluster 3 (the
one with poor performance on distance after treatment) and
the other three clusters were 1.89 and 0.63, respectively. In
our sample, a standardized distance of 1.89 should be in-
terpreted as *4 m away from the feared animal (from an
initial distance of 5 m), whereas a standardized distance of
0.63 reﬂects a distance of 2 m left to cover (from an initial
distance of 5 m).

Because there were no individuals from the iVET condi-
tion in cluster 3, and we found a trend toward a signiﬁcantly
higher baseline distance left to cover in this cluster, we ex-
plored whether iVET was more effective than VRET and
ARET for individuals with high baseline scores on distance
left to cover. A multivariate regression was performed with
treatment condition (1 = ARET or VRET; 2 = in vivo) in the
ﬁrst block, baseline distance in the second block, and the in-
teraction between condition and baseline distance in the third
block. Posttreatment distance covered was used as the de-

pendent variable. The model explained 10.2 percent of the
variance in posttreatment distance covered, and the effect of
the interaction term was marginally signiﬁcant, F(1) = 3.82,
p = 0.054, change in R2 = 2.9 percent, B = -0.21 (-0.420 to
0.004), p = 0.054. A graphical representation of this mar-
ginally signiﬁcant moderation effect is presented in Figure 2.
No moderation effect was found when the same analysis
was performed for anxiety, F(1) = 0.19, p = 0.667, change in
R2 < 0.1 percent, B = -0.12 (-0.682 to 0.439), p = 0.667, and
fear, F(1) = 1.61, p = 0.208, change in R2 < 0.1 percent,
B = -0.38 (-0.981 to 0.217), p = 0.208.

Discussion

This study aimed to study the differential efﬁcacy of
VRET, ARET, and iVET for the treatment of small animal
phobia. Research had revealed that other exposure treat-
ments, including VRET, were good alternatives to iVET for
the treatment of speciﬁc phobias,5,6,17 including small animal
phobia.27,28 However, to the best of our knowledge, no study
had compared the efﬁcacy of the three treatment modalities
together. This study is the ﬁrst to include ARET.

As expected, the results from this study suggest that the
three approaches may be equally efﬁcacious in the treatment
of behavioral (e.g., how close patients were willing to ap-
proach the feared object, namely, a cockroach or a spider,
during the BAT) and psychological (i.e., anxiety during the
BAT and fear) features of the disease. In our study, this
similarity in the results was observed right after treatment,
coinciding with the most recent meta-analysis on speciﬁc
phobias.5 A previous meta-analysis only indicated the
comparability of traditional iVET and alternative forms of
exposure at followup.6 It is important to note, however, that
alternative forms of exposure in this study included a mixture
of different procedures (i.e., imaginal exposure, CAVE, and

VRET), but no study on augmented reality, which might help
to understand the differences found in our investigation and
in the more recent meta-analysis.5

This study used cluster analysis and moderation analysis
to explore whether subgroups of patients showed a differ-
ential response to the treatments. This is important because
the detection of subgroups would provide evidence about
how to maximize treatment effectiveness (i.e., personalized
treatments) by selecting the treatment that has the most im-
pact on each subset of individuals. Overall, our results sug-
gest that the three treatment modalities are effective across
different levels of patient characteristics, including age, fear,
and anxiety during the BAT. The cluster analyses only re-
vealed differences in the response to treatment for distance.
Speciﬁcally, one group of individuals (n = 6) was found to
differ from the other groups in distance covered after treat-
ment. None of the poor-responding patients belonged to the
iVET group, three received VRET treatment, and three
participated in the ARET condition. Accordingly, a moder-
ation analysis revealed a marginally signiﬁcant trend toward
a superior efﬁcacy of iVET when less distance was covered
in the baseline BAT. Although the implications of these re-
sults should be interpreted with caution, it is possible that
iVET is more effective when individuals show worse per-
formance on distance covered during the BAT before treat-
ment onset. Further research should explore the reliability of
this ﬁnding, which might be important
in personalizing
treatments, but could be problematic for institutions planning
on implementing virtual or augmented reality for animal
phobia treatment.

One of the strengths of the present investigation is that,
after aggregating the three datasets used, the sample size
was large compared to previous research. In fact, the most
recent meta-analysis comparing VRET and iVET for the
treatment of speciﬁc phobias revealed that the mean sample

size for the 14 studies included was only 18.64 partici-
pants.5 Our investigation intended to overcome this limi-
tation of small sample sizes by aggregating data from three
studies. However, this study is not free of limitations. First,
there was very low variability in age and sex, and so gen-
eralization of the results to men and older samples should
be done with caution. However, it is important to note that
in women and
small animal phobia is more frequent
younger adults, so that these study ﬁndings may be relevant
for a large percentage of patients. In addition, although
cluster analyses are useful tools to identify groups of cases
with a shared characteristic, it is also true that they are
atheoretical, and their solution is not generalizable because
it depends on the variables used. Hence, the results of our
cluster analyses should be considered exploratory and should
be interpreted with caution. Thus, replication is needed. Also,
while standardization of all variables was required due to the
use of different scales and numbers of items, this might have
made the results difﬁcult to interpret. Using a homogeneous set
of measures will be important in future replication studies.
Finally, although the aggregation of studies led to a consider-
able sample size, even larger sample sizes are needed in future
studies to explore whether certain treatments are more effective
for a subset of patients, which is a key to personalizing psy-
chological treatments. For example, our cluster and moderation
analyses did not reveal different subgroups of patients as a
function of baseline and posttreatment anxiety and fear.
However, larger sample sizes with greater variability, for ex-
ample in sex, could test different moderators and grouping
variables.

Despite these shortcomings, our study ﬁndings may have
important clinical implications because they support previ-
ous literature indicating that VRET and ARET are useful
alternatives to traditional iVET treatments for small ani-
mal phobia. Considering that iVET treatments are more

frequently refused by patients than VRET,11 these ﬁndings
are important because they provide clinicians with two
equally efﬁcacious alternatives to iVET.

It is important to note, however, that the implementation
of VRET and ARET in clinical practice is still difﬁcult.
Research has revealed some resistance to implementing new
digital technologies in clinical practice.34 Moreover, virtual
reality devices have traditionally been expensive, which
might have restricted their use. Fortunately, this situation is
already starting to change, and new trials are being carried
out with inexpensive commercial devices.35 It is important to
make virtual reality devices accessible in terms of ease of use
and price if their beneﬁts are to be transferred from research
to clinical practice. In this regard, it is likely that bigger
sample sizes will be recruited for future studies, and, thus, it
will be easier to establish differential responses to VRET and
ARET. In fact, as exposed previously, the reduced costs of
augmented reality when compared with virtual reality (i.e.,
less elements need to be created) might help achieve this
goal.7 The remaining beneﬁts of using ARET as opposed to
VRET (e.g., the former is argued to be more ecological),
however, did not result in greater treatment efﬁcacy in the
present investigation, so further research is required.
