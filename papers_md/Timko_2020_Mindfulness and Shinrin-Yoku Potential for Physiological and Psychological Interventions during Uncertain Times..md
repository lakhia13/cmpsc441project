Abstract: Mindfulness and Shinrin-yoku (SY) translated as forest bathing, is potentially eﬀective to
alleviate mental health issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The purpose of this
article is to provide a translational and pragmatic approach to understanding mindfulness in the
context of SY and psychological wellbeing through a rapid review of the literature. The background
of mindfulness and SY practice are discussed and the emotional, neuroendocrine, and neurobiological
responses are examined. Next, a rapid review of the literature examined six studies, published between
2010 and 2020 to determine what is known regarding the relationship between SY, mindfulness,
and psychological wellbeing. The studies included 21–360 participants with a mean age of 20–55 years.
The results demonstrated a signiﬁcant positive correlation between nature, mindfulness, and measures
of psychological wellbeing. During uncertain events, including COVID-19, weaving mindfulness
with SY may be speciﬁcally important to at-risk groups, those experiencing depression, loneliness,
and social isolation, and at-risk populations such as college students, veterans, and professionals
with high levels of stress. The goal of this review is to provide a thorough background and support of
this cost-eﬀective modality to promote overall psychological wellbeing as a preventative measure to
those at risk or experiencing psychological illnesses.

1. Introduction

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard, presented by the Center for Systems Science and
Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), illustrates the brevity of this unprecedented
time of global uncertainty. As of 27 October 2020, there are 43,895,968 conﬁrmed cases of COVID-19 in
189 countries with 1,165,455 deaths globally [1]. The conﬁrmed individuals and others collectively have
been seriously aﬀected physically, psychologically, spiritually, and/or economically by this pandemic.
From a psychological perspective, researchers quickly shined a light on the eﬀects of COVID-19
epidemiological mandates, such as: fear of disease and death, fear of the threat to human existence,
heightened state anxiety, social distancing, social isolation, and quarantine [2–5]. Mental health
issues tend to be discounted in various cultures and societies even though mental illness accounts for
one-third of adult disabilities worldwide [5]. Mental health interventions are to be actively available at
all times and keenly recognized during and after unstable global catastrophes. Mindfulness practice
has demonstrated signiﬁcant positive eﬀects on mental health concerns [6–13] while Shinrin-yoku (SY),

translated as forest bathing has also demonstrated relaxing and healing eﬀects. When evaluating these
two modalities together, would there be a signiﬁcant eﬀect on emotional wellbeing? The authors’ aims
are to provide a background and rapid review of the literature pertaining to mindfulness and SY as
interventions to alleviate mental health issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

2. Background

2.1. Mindfulness

Mindfulness has a long history, dating back to the Buddhist tradition in the ﬁrst century BC.
This history has countless understandings and several historical theories. Mindfulness has varied ways
to practice with clinical, philosophical, religious, and secular approaches. With all the complexities
within the practice of mindfulness, it is surprisingly not diﬃcult to ﬁnd common ground in writings and
teachings. There are two main purposes of this ancient practice: coping and elimination of suﬀering,
and positive changes in emotional states that lead to changes in behavior [6]. This has been simpliﬁed
s internal states and surroundings” [7] or
over the centuries to the understanding of “awareness of one
“paying attention in a particular way; on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally” [8].
When mindfulness is practiced and achieved, there is an improvement in mental, physical, emotional,
and spiritual well-being [9].

(cid:48)

Health care workers and college students are particularly vulnerable to the negative eﬀects of
the COVID-19 pandemic and mindfulness practices have demonstrated positive mitigation of these
concerns [10]. Healthcare professionals who practice mindfulness have signiﬁcant positive eﬀects
regarding stress, anxiety, burnout, depression, and psychological distress [11–13]. All of these stressors
have a negative eﬀect on the provision of patient care, which is of particular importance at this
time, with stress, anxiety, and fear so prevalent in all aspects of patients’ lives during this pandemic.
College students, in particular, have high rates of stress and fatigue whereas mindfulness encourages
engagement, focus, and learning [14].

Mindfulness research has been substantially increasing as an intervention to improve general
health and well-being [15]. People are desiring to know and incorporate positive coping strategies [16].
Healthcare providers who participate in mindfulness programs, such as Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MSBR) have experienced an increased quality of life and decreased perceived stress [17].
Research conducted in prison settings supports mindfulness interventions as having positive eﬀects on
the physical and mental health of inmates, instructors, and prison staﬀ members [18].

Mindfulness provides many opportunities for a variety of practice methods. Several ways to
practice include clinical/secular and philosophical/religious approaches. Some examples that have
emerged are described here.

Clinical and secular approaches are used in a variety of settings. Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MBSR) is a formal, 8-week program that is oﬀered at medical centers across the United
States. Instructors lead participants through mindfulness meditation techniques with stretches and
postures from Hatha yoga. MBSR teaches how to positively handle daily stressors. Mindfulness-Based
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is MBSR and cognitive therapy as a treatment for chronic depression.
MBCT helps people to cope and manage personal thoughts and feelings. There is also Acceptance-Based
Behavioral Therapy (ABBT) that includes MBSR and behavioral therapy to treat generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD). GAD assists individuals to understand personal thoughts and emotions are normal,
expected, and will increase and decrease from moment to moment.

Philosophical and religious approaches have been practiced for thousands of years. The root
of mindfulness practice, as we understand it today, is derived directly from Buddhism. In order to
practice mindful meditation, it is not required to have an understanding of Buddhism. It is an attempt
to pay attention, to listen, and to be aware by simply noticing your breathing. It is gentle, appreciative,
and nurturing [19]. An ancient practice in the Christian tradition is that of lectio divina. Lectio has
roots in the Jewish synagogue, where Rabbis meditated on the Hebrew Scriptures [20]. In the 6th

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 9340

3 of 13

century, St. Benedict discussed the four phases: mind, heart, spirit, and body or read, meditate, pray,
and contemplate [21]. We are called to rest in God’s word and allow his vision and value to shape us [20].
Hinduism has deep roots in yoga and Vedic meditation that date back 2500–3500 years. Diﬀerent types
of Hindu mindful meditation today include Mantra Meditation, Transcendental Meditation, and Yoga
Meditation. These are all ways to focus and silence the mind using a mantra or focus of attention,
concentration, or visualization.

2.1.1. Mindfulness Emotional Responses

The eﬀect of mindfulness on emotional response has been well documented in the literature
ranging from fear conditioning, emotional learning, and reduction of post-traumatic stress disorder
symptoms [22]. Roemer, Williston, and Rollins [23] found mindfulness to be associated with enhanced
emotional recovery, reduced negative emotional responses, reduction in behavioral avoidance
and decreases in emotional regulation diﬃculties. Roomer and colleagues [23] continue with the
interpretation of their ﬁndings to indicate the practice of mindfulness is associated with healthy
emotion regulation.

Long and Christian [24], explored the eﬀect of mindfulness as a buﬀer to ruminative thoughts
and negative emotional responses including injustice and retaliation. Their ﬁndings are supportive of
the buﬀering eﬀects of mindfulness on ruminative and negative emotional responses which lessen
retaliation. This bolster to self-regulation is especially important to health care workers who, through
secondary trauma, are likely to experience higher levels of stress leading to negative emotional
responses. Long and Christian [24] were among the ﬁrst researchers to focus on mindful self-regulation
in a workplace setting. As the workplace culture shifts to focus on healthier environments, this type
of research is imperative to the creation of sustainable and functional workplace environments that
support active measures to decrease deleterious circumstances, including retaliation and automaticity.
Measures such as this have the potential to increase job satisfaction, retention, and performance through
decreasing negative emotional responses.

The central pillar of Gestalt therapy is awareness which is directly related to the practice of
mindfulness [25]. Through increasing mindfulness, the practice of MBSR impacts the modiﬁcation of
emotional responses including those associated with fear response and conditioning [22]. Highlights
of this research suggested underlying neural plasticity related to mindfulness practice and its impact
on the sensitivity of emotional responses [22]. Practitioners of mindfulness are encouraged to turn
toward unpleasant emotions and stimuli rather than away [26]. This is similar to research on increasing
the performance and endurance threshold of elite athletes [27]. This research is signiﬁcant because of
the negativity correlated with trait anxiety levels thus suggesting understanding the neural plasticity
associated with mindfulness training can be incorporated into successful and sustainably anti-anxiety
interventions. Björkstrand et al. [28] found mindfulness training had a positive eﬀect on emotional
function through the retention of safety learning protocols for healthy individuals. This has profound
implications for the potential treatment of anxiety and trauma-related psychological disorders such as
posttraumatic stress disorders [29,30].

Relating the eﬀect of mindfulness on fear-based behaviors is highlighted by the research conducted
by Orellana-Rios et al. [31] and the importance of developing a mindful presence, cultivating
loving-kindness, and inner-self acceptance into daily work activities. Relating the eﬀects of mindfulness
on fear-based behaviors is important for the increase in the skills for the self-care strategies toolbox and
minimizing the fear of unpleasant circumstances. Incorporating these skills in daily work activities,
makes these skills more accessible and sustainable for a larger population. Targeting practitioners and
their patients with mindfulness and compassion-oriented practices will be beneﬁcial for all involved.

2.1.2. Neuroendocrine Responses

Regarding mindfulness and neuroendocrine eﬀects, the literature [32] suggests mindfulness
practice is associated with down-regulation of nuclear factor kappa B, the opposite of chronic stress

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 9340

4 of 13

eﬀects, and thus associated with a reduced risk of inﬂammation-related disease. This connection is
important when considering chronic disease management and prevention, as well as chronic work
stressors on employees [33].

Even brief (3-day) mindfulness meditation training has been shown to reduce self-reported
perceived stress [34]. However, the increase of salivary cortisol in the same experiment suggests a
greater coping eﬀort and cortisol reactivity during evaluative stressors [34]. These results suggest,
and are in line with previous research, mindfulness skill acquisition may be mentally demanding but
further research is needed to determine the extent of this response.

2.1.3. Neurobiological Responses

The neurobiological correlates of mindfulness meditation are especially interesting on impulsivity
and emotional regulation [35–37]. Guendelman et al. [37] explored mindfulness-based regulation
interventions to more clearly explore and deﬁne a top-down and bottom-up perspective. Mindfulness
emotional regulation strategies tend to use a bottom-up approach where the individual regulates
emotional response through mindful awareness versus a cognitive reappraisal which relies on a
top-bottom mechanism. Guendelman et al. [37] concluded mindfulness practices change the bottom-up
emotional regulation system including emotional generation and implicit emotional regulation
through long-term meditation training. Although these strategies focus on diﬀerent aspects including
interoceptive-proprioception, sensory-perception, and cognitions and thought process of emotional
regulation, the end goal beneﬁts of emotional regulation are clearly accessible to both casual and the
expert meditator [37].

2.2. Shinrin-Yoku (Forest Bathing)

Shinrin-yoku (SY) is a Japanese word ﬁrst identiﬁed by the Director of the Japanese Forestry Agency,
Tomohide Akiyama, in 1982 as a method to attract people to visit the Japanese forests. The Japanese
characters, or Kanji, for Shinrin-yoku are 森林浴. The ﬁrst character represents a forest (three trees),
the second character symbolizes a wood and the third character corresponds with bathe (ﬂowing water
on the left of the character and a valley on the right side of the character). When translated into English,
it means forest bathing and is similar to the English nuance of sunbathing. The practice of slowly and
mindfully walking in the forest environment while using all ﬁve senses led Japanese scientists to
research the physiological and psychological outcomes of experiencing nature [38].

Initially, Miyazaki [38] conducted physiological experiments in 1990 on Japanese participants
living in Yakushima because of the plethora of hinoki cedar trees. The eﬀects of SY on the levels of
the stress hormone, cortisol, were initially measured because an increase in the number of people
living in cities and urban areas were identiﬁed as experiencing higher levels of stress. In a decade,
new techniques evolved to measure the SY eﬀects on the autonomic nervous system (e.g., brain wave
activity) and the incidence of research increased in the 2000s to provide credence to the preventative
prescription for enhancing wellbeing and placing less strain on the healthcare system.

Current published research, centered on the physiological health beneﬁts, has increased over the
past decade [39–42]. The physiological health beneﬁts include decreased blood pressure, decreased levels
of oxyhemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex, decreased pulse rate, decreased cortisol levels, and decreased
heart rate variability (HRV). Most recently, perhaps due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a multitude
of references pertaining to SY and nature therapy (NT) research by various researchers deeply looking
at the relaxing and healing eﬀects of receiving stimuli from natural environments, such as plants,
ﬂowers, trees, forests, various woods, and running water in natural environments.

2.2.1. SY Emotional Responses

Focusing on the natural world through an emotional lens of awe may have a positive eﬀect on
human health and well-being. Flora and fauna also may create safe and secure places for individuals
to reﬂect on emotions, investigate feelings while minimizing the stress response, and provide an

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 9340

(cid:48)

opportunity to journal emotions that arise while being exposed to nature and green spaces. According to
Bethelmy and Corraliza [43], nature is a commonly acknowledged source of transcendent emotion and
research has shown nature
s brawn to bring about strong human emotions. The aforementioned
(cid:48)
s sublime emotion toward nature.
researchers generated abstract and operative deﬁnitions of a human
Based on recent research regarding the feeling of awe, Bethelmy and Corraliza [43] developed an
instrument to measure sublime emotion toward nature and recruited 280 participants from the general
population of Madrid, Spain to determine the conceptual deﬁnition of sublime emotion. Results indicated
two conceptual determinants: awe and inspiring energy. Writers and researchers have identiﬁed positive
aﬀective eﬀects radiating from the concept of awe, as a speciﬁc emotional state. Precisely, the awe
experienced in nature settings reduced human stress-related symptoms and increased overall human
wellbeing [44,45].

Exposure to nature, such as green spaces, may have a shielding eﬀect on a human’s mental
well-being, such as reported favorable eﬀects on the human stress response. Hunter and colleagues [46]
demonstrated 10–30 min of quiet stillness in nature lowers the stress hormone, cortisol. Bratman and
associates [47] determined individuals who walked 90 min in nature compared with individuals
who walked 90 min along a busy urban road ruminate less about themselves and had a reduction
in the activity of the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC). The sgPFC part of the human brain is
an area showing sadness, human withdrawal, and reﬂection on negative emotional experiences
via magnetic resonance imagery (MRI). Furthermore, viewing photographs or videos of nature
scenes have a restorative eﬀect, such as fewer negative feelings and increased reported positive
moods. Whereas viewing images of urban scenes do not have a soothing eﬀect reported by research
participants [48].

2.2.2. SY Neuroendocrine Responses

The neuroendocrine eﬀects of SY are clearly presented in a recent systematic review conducted by
Wen and colleagues [49]. Li and co-researchers [50] investigated the eﬀects of SY on cardiovascular
health and metabolic factors of 19 middle-aged Japanese male participants. Following a 2.6 km walk
(80 min each in the morning and afternoon) in an urban treeless environment and controlling for the
exact exposure in a forest environment on two consecutive Saturdays in Japan, the participants’ blood
and urine samples were collected before and after each trip. In addition, participants’ blood pressure
and pulse rates were measured during the trips, as well as the Japanese version of the Proﬁle of Mood
States (POMS) was conducted before, during, and after each walk. The forest bathing environment
walks signiﬁcantly reduced participants’ pulse rate and signiﬁcantly increased the stamina score and
signiﬁcantly decreased the scores for anxiety, confusion, depression, and fatigue. Showing a tendency
toward a decline in urinary adrenaline and a signiﬁcant drop in urinary dopamine was indicated
among the forest bathing program when compared to the urban walking program. Additionally,
serum adiponectin, an adipocyte secreted protein that decreases inﬂammation in the cardiovascular
system, was elevated amongst the forest bathing walkers.

Ochiai and research colleagues [51] recruited middle-aged males with high-normal blood pressure
in an attempt to study the eﬀects of time spent walking and relaxing in a forest environment on
blood pressure and other physiological and psychological factors associated with human stress.
The physiological and psychological parameters were measured the same time of day before and
circa two hours following the forest walk in order to control for circadian eﬀects. The systolic and
diastolic blood pressure readings, as well as urinary adrenaline and serum cortisol, were signiﬁcantly
lower (p < 0.05) than baseline following the forest walk. Therefore, these results indicate a forest
therapy intervention that has a positive eﬀect on individuals who have been diagnosed with
cardiovascular disease.

As mentioned before, SY has been documented as a stress-reducing integrative medicine modality.
Kobayashi and colleagues [52] conducted a randomized crossover study and reported the eﬀect of
viewing a forest environment versus viewing an urban landscape on male participants (n = 348)

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 9340

6 of 13

salivary cortisol concentrations. Each participant sat on a chair for 15 min while viewing a forest
environment and then 15 min viewing an urban environment for 15 min. The intervention sites were
34 forest sites and 34 urban sites (city centers) scattered across Japan. The participants’ saliva was
collected immediately following each 15-min intervention. Frequency distributions of salivary cortisol
intensities, as reported as mode, were in a range from 5.73 to 6.55 nmol/L for both groups. However,
the participants with a higher salivary cortisol level (>10 nmol/L) were larger in the urban group
(n = 84) than in the forest environment (n = 44). Furthermore, cortisol levels were signiﬁcantly lower in
the forest environment group (mean: 6.88 nmol/L, median: 6.35 nmol/L) than in an urban environment
group (mean: 7.98 nmol/L, median: 7.45 nmol/L), and the variation test revealed these diﬀerences were
statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.001).

These three studies provide a snapshot of the current research conducted on the SY eﬀects
on the neuroendocrine human system. According to the physiological anthropologist and deemed
father of forest bathing, Miyazaki [53], designed the back-to-nature-theory purporting since humans
evolved in nature it is where humans feel most comfortable and achieve homeostasis. Miyazaki
and associates [54–57] have extensively conducted and published studies involving physiological
markers, such as the autonomic nervous system (heart rate variability), central nervous system (EEG,
fMRI and PET scans), endocrine systems (cortisol, adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, immunoglobulin A,
and the immune system (natural killer cells).

2.2.3. Neurobiological Responses

Song and research associates [55] examined the eﬀect of viewing real forest landscapes on human
prefrontal brain activity. Song et al. [55] set out to conduct this research because there is limited
evidence-based research involving brain activity changes when exposed to forest environments.
Twenty-nine females (age: 21 ± 1.4 years) were recruited across ﬁve forest and ﬁve urban environments
and were asked to view forest and urban scenes for 15 min each. The oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-hb) levels
were constantly measured in the right and left pre-frontal areas of the brain while the participants
viewed each scene and the results indicated a lower level of Oxy-hb in the participants’ right pre-frontal
lobes while viewing forest landscapes. This area of the human brain is associated with physiological
relaxation and these results showed less oxygen uptake in this region of the brain is necessary while
viewing nature landscapes. This recently published study supports prior studies [56,57] and studies
conducted in a nature therapy laboratory [58,59].

This provided review of the recent research conducted in the areas of neuroendocrine
and neurobiological eﬀects associated with SY supports and improves mental health wellbeing.
Shinrin-yoku is a living medicine that has been with us for over seven million years as humans evolved
in nature (99.9%) versus the time we have spent in urban cities (0.01%) (personal communication,
Miyazaki, 2018). Applying Miyazaki
s human stressed state
during this unprecedented pandemic and global warming times is warranted. The Concept of Nature
Therapy is a top-down concept that starts with a stressed state and from this mindful stressed state one
looks for exposure to ﬂowers, wood products, and forests with a result in physiological relaxation and
immune function recovery, hence resulting as preventive medicine. Weaving mindfulness with this Concept
of Nature Therapy may be applied to mental health risk groups, such as depression, loneliness, and social
isolation during uncertain events as recently experienced at the global level.

3. Materials and Methods

A rapid review was conducted to determine what is known regarding the relationship between
SY, mindfulness, and measures of psychological wellbeing at this critical time of a global pandemic
with COVID-19 (Table 1). A literature search was conducted using the keywords: nature, mindfulness,
Shinrin-yoku, psychological wellbeing, and mental health. Inclusion criteria included: peer-reviewed
article, published between 2010 and 2020, English language, and mindfulness in nature to measure
psychological wellbeing outcomes. Exclusion criteria included: systematic reviews. A total of 29 articles
were reviewed with a total of six meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Continue to study the
beneﬁcial eﬀects of
nature and mindfulness
and an intervention to
support well-being,
resilience and improve
mental health.

For female university
students, connecting
with nature may be more
likely to be associated
with increased in
positive psychological
outcomes rather than
decreases in
negative symptoms.
Nature relatedness and
elements of wellbeing
may be explained by the
nonreactivity and
observing qualities of
mindfulness

Signiﬁcant relationship
across all measures
including CNS and all
measure of
psychological wellbeing
and mindfulness

All three groups showed
signiﬁcant changes to
mental health and
wellbeing. Only the
natural outdoor
environment group had
improved nature
connectedness,
rumination, reﬂective
attitudes, and stress
reduction over the
intervention including a
one-month follow-up

4. Results

4.1. Sample and Study Characteristics

The number of subjects in the studies ranged from 21 to 360 with a mean age range between 20.67
and 55 years. The studies not reporting mean age ranges were conducted in a university setting [60],
or a work setting [61]. All the research studies measured mindfulness and emotional health outcomes.
Two of the studies did not include a connection or relationship with nature questionnaire [61,62]
though the studies took place in an outdoor setting. The studies included both survey [60,63,64] and
interventional [61,62,65] studies. All studies used convenience sampling and one study did have a
small control group [61]. The search also included two pilot studies [61,62].

The purpose of three of the studies was to determine the relationship between nature, mindfulness,
and psychological wellbeing outcomes [60,63,64]. The remaining study purposes were to examine the
eﬀects of mindfulness training within an outdoor nature environment [61,62,65].

4.2. Results

The results showed overall, that there is a signiﬁcant positive correlation between nature,
mindfulness, and measures of psychological wellbeing. Two studies discussed the positive beneﬁts
of mindfulness training in nature with the reduction of the burden of illness related to the
intervention [61,62] by as much as 40% [61]. Speciﬁc psychological conditions such as anxiety,
depression, and psychological stress showed signiﬁcant beneﬁts from mindfulness in nature [60,65].
Connection or relatedness to nature scores was correlated to an increase in mindfulness [60,63,64] and
measures psychological wellbeing [60,63–65]. Mindfulness was positively correlated with measures of
psychological wellbeing [60–63,65].

4.3. Limitations

Research in this area is limited due to small sample sizes, lack of adequate power, at higher than
desired attrition rates. The authors of all the studies reported the need for larger sample sizes with
randomization to increase power and a greater variety of participants to provide generalizability.

4.4. Conclusion

Mindfulness and SY interventions are a cost-eﬀective modality that can be implemented in a
variety of settings to promote overall psychological wellbeing to at-risk populations such as college
students, veterans, and professionals with high levels of work-related stress.

5. Discussion

Mindfulness and Shinrin-Yoku Connection

Two are better than one because they have good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can
help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up. Also, if two lie down together,
they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can
defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. (Ecclesiastes 4:9–12)

Human beings have the innate capacity for health and wellbeing [66]. This capacity is reaching
for balance and respite in an ever-changing environment. Yet, nature is also reaching for balance
and respite in every changing relationship with humankind. Both humans and nature are seeking,
searching, striving to develop the symbiotic relationship that has existed for millennia. Ancient writings
reveal spiritual practices of contemplation during challenging times that people would retreat to
nature, the deep forest, and the most desolate desert, for days, weeks, months, and even years
seeking wellbeing.

We are seeing some increased threats to psychological and emotional wellbeing while nature is
showing she may be damaged beyond repair, both in need of healing. Supporting mindfulness in
nature will result in a symbiotic relationship that is beneﬁcial to both human wellbeing and nature,
rather than destructive of both [67]. Symbiosis is from the Greek word sumbios, companion, to sumioun,
live together, and ﬁnally symbiosis, a living together [68].

Additionally, mindfulness and SY support environmental well-being. When mindfulness is
practiced within SY there is an increase in connection with nature and a reestablishment and
strengthening of this bond [69]. With the decline of nature in urban areas, it is even more important to
expand the understanding of the beneﬁts to promote a pro-environmental attitude and behavior to
strengthen psychological wellbeing.

SY helps to support interconnectedness to nature but it is signiﬁcantly greater when participants
engaged in mindfulness [60,63,64,69]. Mindfulness supports a deeper connection with nature and
may support achieving those beneﬁts more eﬃciently [70]. The health eﬀects of outdoor activities
were greatly enhanced when engagement strategies of mindfulness were incorporated into nature
activities [62]. Psychological well-being was more likely when people were engaged and interacted
with the environment through mindfulness [60,63–65,71]. In addition, time in nature can enhance
mindfulness while fostering physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being while supporting the
development of insight into the reality of the present situation [67].

6. Conclusions

In this year of 2020, we have seen over 40 million cases and greater than 1.1 million deaths from
COVID-19 [1]. This has caused signiﬁcant physical, psychological, spiritual, and economic distress
to people and the environment, all around the globe. Accessible mental health interventions need
to be available and utilized to alleviate further destruction. Mindfulness practice has been shown
to improve mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing [9]. Techniques can be clinically
based, such as MBSR and MBCT [62,65], or philosophically/religiously based from Buddhism, Judaism,
Christianity, and Hinduism [19–21]. SY experiences have demonstrated a decrease in the stress
response [38] and multiple overall health beneﬁts [39–42]. Mindfulness and SY have shown an
increase in positive emotional responses [31,43–48], neuroendocrine eﬀects [24–32,49–57], and even
neurobiological responses [35–37,55–59]. The greatest eﬀects may be best utilized together with the
support of the symbiotic relationship of humanity and nature [60–65]. Additional information is
available in the supplementary materials. Mindfulness and SY support the health and healing of both
self and nature. Psychological wellbeing is greatly enhanced and supported when humanity can slow
down, be present, be mindful, rest in the woods, and allow the healing power of nature to perform her
healing work from within.
