COMMENTARY

COVID-19 and Cannabidiol (CBD)

Jag H. Khalsa, MS, PhD, Greg Bunt, MD, Sanjay B. Maggirwar, PhD, and Shyam Kottilil, MBBS, PhD

COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in devastating mortality and
morbidity consisting of socioeconomic and health effects that have
included respiratory/pulmonary, cardiovascular, mental health and
neurological consequences such as anxiety, depression, and sub-
stance use. Extensive efforts are underway to develop preventive
vaccines and therapeutics such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, con-
valescent plasma, and others to treat COVID-19 but many report
residual mental health problems after recovery. Cannabis products
such as cannabidiol (CBD) are being advertised for the treatment of
COVID-19 associated mental health problems and substance use
disorders. This commentary will briefly clear the myth that CBD can
ameliorate a wide range of COVID-19 associated health effects
including anxiety, depression, or any substance use disorder, and
show that there is a clear lack of sufficient unbiased clinical evidence
from well-designed double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to
prove the antianxiety or antidepression therapeutic properties of
CBD and support its wide use as medicine to treat COVID-19-
associated mental health conditions or substance use disorders.
Finally, we suggest that addiction physicians must play an important
role in dealing with their patients requesting CBD prescription for
treating any of these conditions.

T oday, the world is facing one of the most devastating viral

pandemics of our time where almost 62 million people
have been infected with a novel corona virus, known as severe
acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-Cov2),

and more than one million people have died from the corona
virus induced disease (COVID-19).1 The COVID-19 pan-
demic is also responsible for unprecedented loss of life,
economic, social, and health consequences including severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),2 cardiovascular,3 mental
health including anxiety, depression, and neurological com-
plications like tremors, seizures, and impaired conscious-
ness.4 An estimated 45% of adults in the US reported that
their mental health has been negatively impacted due to worry
and stress over the virus.5 Further, people with preexisting
health conditions including asthma, cerebrovascular disease,
hypertension, diabetes, immunocompromised state, neurolog-
ical conditions such as dementia and others might be at
increased risk from COVID-19.6 The conditions such as
imposed shelter-in-place, physical distancing, social isolation
and potential financial distress from job loss might further
lead to mental health problems, increased substance use, and
possibly suicides. Furthermore,
limited access to mental
health care and addiction treatment health care providers
for treating substance use disorder(s) may also in part exac-
erbate COVID-19 related complications, thereby necessitat-
ing the use of telemedicine to treat people with substance use
disorder(s).

Extensive efforts worldwide are underway to develop
vaccines and therapeutics including remdesivir, dexametha-
sone, and convalescent plasma to combat the coronavirus
induced symptomatic disease (COVID-19) and associated
complications. Even though long-term use of cannabis is
associated with significant morbidity including increased risk
of panic attacks,7 the internet is filled with suggestions for
using cannabis or cannabinoids including cannabidiol (CBD)
for the treatment of coronavirus infection induced inflamma-
tion and COVID-19 induced mental health conditions includ-
ing anxiety, depression, PTSD, and panic attacks. The recent
changes in legalization of CBD in many US states have made
CBD products easily accessible to all as over the counter
products. This commentary will briefly show that the use of
CBD for the treatment of anxiety, depression and substance
use disorder(s) are just myths and not a reality.

Though CBD may be a promising drug to treat panic
disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic disor-
der (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, and depressive disorders8
via serotonergic pathways and endocannabinoid system,
extensive literature search failed to find sufficient clinical
evidence to support CBD for treating any of the above-
mentioned mental conditions.9 Much more clinical research
from well-designed clinical trials is needed to support the use
of CBD in treating anxiety and depressive disorders and
bipolar disorders.10 CBD may promote wakefulness via

triggering increased dopamine levels in areas of the brain and
thereby treat narcolepsy, and in a case report,11 CBD did
improve the quality and quantity of sleep of a 10-year old
young patient with PTSD, likely due to its anxiety-relieving
benefits. But these data from one patient are clearly insuffi-
cient to support the use of CBD for treating sleep disorders.
Could CBD treat substance use disorders? The answer is
not yet. Limited research suggests that CBD could potentially
treat patients with substance use disorders like opioid-, cannabis-
, and tobacco use disorders (OUD, CUD, TUD).12 Earlier studies
showed that legalization of medical marijuana reduced the
number of over dose deaths from opioid pain relievers,13 and
that medical marijuana laws significantly reduced prescribing of
opioids for pain.14 More recently, Hurd et al15 reported that acute
administration of CBD to heroin abstinent patients with OUD
significantly reduced craving, anxiety, heart rate and salivary
cortisol without causing adverse effects. But still additional
clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of CBD in
treating opioid use disorder.16 In a randomized, double blind,
placebo-controlled trial,17 nabiximols (THCþCBD [Sativex])
combined with Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Cogni-
tive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), reduced cannabis use and
craving but not withdrawal symptoms in persons that used
cannabis chronically. CBD also reduced euphoria and depressive
and psychotic-like symptoms, improved attention, verbal learn-
ing and memory without impairing cognition when smoking
cannabis, suggesting that prolonged therapy with CBD may be a
useful adjunct therapy for treating cannabis dependence.18 In a
study of 24 tobacco smokers, CBD inhaler reduced the number of
tobacco cigarettes by 40% when compared to placebo19; and a
single dose of 800 mg oral dose of CBD reduced the salience and
pleasantness of cigarette cues, but did not influence tobacco
craving or withdrawal or any subjectively rated side effects.20
Data from these studies with a small number of patients present a
positive signal of CBD’s potential to treat substance use dis-
orders, but significantly much more research from well-designed
clinical trials is needed to support its wide use as treatment for
substance use disorder(s).

Thus, there is a clear paucity of data from well-designed
clinical trials to support the use of CBD for treating anxiety,
depression, other neurological complications associated with
COVID-19 or substance use disorders. A careful systematic
evaluation of CBD in large clinical trials is essential prior to
endorsing its wider use for alleviation of mental health
symptomatology. It is also of paramount importance that
the clinicians treating patients with any of
the above
COVID-19 related mental or neurological conditions or sub-
stance use disorders inform their patients about the lack of
sufficient unbiased clinical evidence for the use of CBD and
discourage them from using CBD for COVID-19 related
health problems during this COVID-19 related severe, unprec-
edented global health catastrophe.
