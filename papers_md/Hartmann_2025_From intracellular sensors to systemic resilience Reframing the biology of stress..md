The biological consequences of chronic stress and trauma are complex, influencing multiple systems and contributing to the development of psychiatric disorders 
such  as  MDD  and  PTSD.  Yet,  the  underlying  molecular  mechanisms  that  confer  susceptibility  in  some  individuals  but  resilience  in  others  remain  incompletely 
understood. To help close these knowledge gaps, my work centers on glucocorticoid signaling as a core mechanism underlying stress-related adaptations. This in-
cludes  the  glucocorticoid  receptor  (GR),  its  co-chaperones  FKBP5  and  FKBP4,  and  regulatory  partners  such  as  SKA2.  Through  a  combination  of  genetic,  viral, 
pharmacological, and transcriptomic approaches, my lab has delineated how these molecules influence HPA axis feedback, fear-related learning, and stress recovery. 
Recently, we identified a novel, GR-independent role for SKA2 in regulating secretory autophagy, a non-lytic autophagy pathway involved in vesicular cargo release, 
including cytokine secretion in microglia. These findings established a mechanistic link between intracellular stress signaling and neuroinflammatory responses. In a 
parallel line of research, we are investigating how chronic stress alters the gut microbiome composition and function, and how these changes impact behavior. Our 
aim  is  to  harness  dietary  and  probiotic  interventions  to  restore  homeostatic  balance  and  enhance  stress  resilience.  By  integrating  molecular  neuroscience  with 
immune and microbiome research, my long-term goal is to build a comprehensive, systems-level model of stress vulnerability and resilience. This approach holds 
promise for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets that support mental health and resilience across the lifespan.

1. Introduction

Severe trauma or chronic stress can profoundly increase the risk of 
developing  psychiatric  disorders.  A  central  question  in  my  research, 
shared by many in the field, is why some individuals maintain psycho-
logical resilience while others develop persistent mental health condi-
tions.  Disorders  such  as  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD)  and 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are not only highly prevalent but 
also rank among the most disabling globally (Ressler et al., 2022; Cui 
et al., 2024). Although their impact is well recognized, the molecular 
pathways underlying these disorders remain incompletely characterized 
(Fenster et al., 2018; Maddox et al., 2019). Central to the body’s stress 
response  are  two  major  systems:  the  autonomic  nervous  system, 
responsible 
the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis,  which  regulates  glucocor-
ticoid release, cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents, as a key 
adaptive mechanism (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009).

and 

for 

While acute glucocorticoid release can be adaptive, facilitating sur-
vival and recovery, dysregulated glucocorticoid signaling, particularly 
under conditions of chronic stress or early-life trauma, can disrupt brain 
function  and  increase  vulnerability  to  psychiatric  disease  (De  Kloet 

et al., 2005; Lupien et al., 2009; Herman, 2022; Kim and Kim, 2023; 
McEwen and Akil, 2020). Accordingly, impairments in HPA axis regu-
lation  represent  a  shared  pathophysiological  thread  across  multiple 
stress-related conditions.

At the molecular level, glucocorticoid effects are mediated by two 
nuclear  receptors:  the  mineralocorticoid  receptor  (MR,  encoded  by 
Nr3c2) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, encoded by Nr3c1). MRs 
exhibit  high  affinity  and  are  predominantly  activated  under  basal 
glucocorticoid conditions, while GRs become engaged during circadian 
peaks or in response to stress. This complementary dynamic allows MRs 
to  maintain  homeostasis  and  initiate  stress  responses,  while  GRs  pri-
marily mediate recovery and feedback inhibition (de Kloet et al., 1998; 
de Kloet and Jo¨els, 2024). Disruptions in the MR:GR balance or signaling 
dynamics of these receptors can alter stress reactivity, fear learning, and 
emotion regulation which are core features of stress-related psychopa-
thology (Daskalakis et al., 2022).

A  central  challenge  in  stress  neurobiology  is  understanding  how 
repeated or traumatic stress becomes biologically embedded, reshaping 
neural circuits, molecular pathways, and immune tone to promote long- 
term vulnerability or, in some individuals, resilience.

2. From glucocorticoid signaling to neuroimmune crosstalk

From the beginning of my research career, I have been intrigued by 
the GR and its central role in coordinating stress responses and behavior. 
My early work, in the lab of Mathias Schmidt at the Max Planck Institute 
of Psychiatry, Munich, focused on identifying the cell-type and circuit- 
specific roles of GR in regulating emotion-related behaviors. Although 
GR is widely expressed in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons as well 
as glial cells, its distinct contributions within these populations were not 
well understood. To further delineate the circuit-specific actions of GR, 
we  generated  mice  lacking  the  GR  specifically  in  forebrain  gluta-
matergic  or  GABAergic  neurons  (Hartmann  et  al.,  2017).  We  demon-
strated  that  GR  signaling  in  forebrain  glutamatergic  neurons,  but  not 
GABAergic  cell  populations,  impacts  both  anxiety  behavior  and  fear 
extinction behavior. Moreover, we showed that selective GR signaling 
within the basolateral amygdala excitatory cell population mediates fear 
learning  and  fear  extinction  but, importantly,  does  not impact  innate 
anxiety  behavior.  This  clarified  a  long-standing  question  about  the 
distinct behavioral domains regulated by GR across neuronal subtypes 
and highlighted glutamatergic GR signaling as a potential therapeutic 
target for fear-related disorders.

Although the GR is essential for mediating glucocorticoid signaling 
and HPA axis feedback, it functions as part of a larger protein complex 
that includes multiple co-chaperones (Binder, 2009; Grad and Picard, 
2007). I became increasingly interested in how these co-factors modu-
late  GR  activity,  as  their  more  subtle  regulatory  effects  may  offer 
promising therapeutic entry points. In parallel with my work on GRs, I 
began  investigating  two  key  co-chaperones:  FKBP5  (FK506  binding 
protein  51)  and  FKBP4  (FK506  binding  protein  52).  FKBP5  acts  as  a 
negative  regulator  by  decreasing  GR  sensitivity  and  nuclear  trans-
location,  while  FKBP4  supports  GR  activity  by  promoting  its  nuclear 
import (Zannas et al., 2015; Wochnik et al., 2005). At the time, FKBP5 
had been identified as a genetic risk factor for stress-related disorders 
such as MDD and PTSD (Binder, 2009; Binder et al., 2004, 2008; Klengel 
et al., 2013; Willour et al., 2009), yet few preclinical studies had vali-
dated its role in disease-relevant outcomes (O’Leary et al., 2011; Scharf 
et  al.,  2011;  Lee  et  al.,  2010;  Touma  et  al.,  2011).  Our  work  helped 
elucidate  the  distinct  roles  of  FKBP5  and  FKBP4  in  modulating 
stress-induced  neuroendocrine  responses  and  behavioral  outcomes 
relevant  to  psychiatric  illness.  We  demonstrated  that  Fkbp5  knockout 
mice exhibited reduced sensitivity to both acute stress and chronic social 
defeat, particularly in terms of behavioral and neuroendocrine responses 
(Hartmann et al., 2012a; Hoeijmakers et al., 2014; Gassen et al., 2014). 
In  contrast,  mice  lacking  Fkbp4  showed  the  opposite  phenotype 
(Hartmann et al., 2012b). Using both viral and pharmacological tools, 
we  further  showed  that  Fkbp5  signaling  in  the  amygdala  modulates 
anxiety-like  behavior,  supporting  FKBP5  as  a  promising  target  for 
therapeutic intervention (Hartmann et al., 2015; Gaali et al., 2015).

More  recent  studies  have  begun  to  dissect  the  cell  type-specific, 
circuit-level,  and  sex-dependent  roles  of  FKBP5  in  stress-related  be-
haviors and GR signaling, providing a more detailed and differentiated 
understanding of its function in distinct neural populations (Brix et al., 
2022; Engelhardt et al., 2021a, 2021b; Kovarova et al., 2024; Sabbagh 
et al., 2014). For example, Fkbp5 deletion in Sim1
PVN neurons reduces 
acute stress reactivity and enhances GR sensitivity, highlighting a key 
role in HPA axis control at the circuit level (H¨ausl et al., 2021); condi-
tional  knockouts in  glutamatergic versus  GABAergic neurons  produce 
opposite  behavioral  effects  in  a  sex-specific  manner  (van  Doeselaar 
et al., 2023); and FKBP5 in forebrain excitatory neurons mediates the 
long-term,  pro-resilient  effects  of  early  life  stress  in  females  but  not 
males  (van  Doeselaar  et  al.,  2025).  These  findings  underscore  the 
nuanced and context-dependent nature of FKBP5 signaling in brain and 
behavior.

+

We also established a link between FKBP5 signaling and autophagy 
pathways,  identifying  a  molecular  mechanism  through  which  FKBP5 
influences  antidepressant  treatment  response  across  cellular,  animal, 

and human models (Gassen et al., 2014, 2015). In this context, FKBP5 
expression levels may serve as predictive biomarkers for antidepressant 
its  genetic 
efficacy,  offering  potential  clinical  utility  beyond 
associations.

During  my  postdoctoral  training  in  Kerry  Ressler’s  lab  at  McLean 
Hospital, I expanded my research to explore how not only the GR, but 
also the MR, interact with FKBP5 - focusing in particular on the concept 
of MR:GR balance in the hippocampus (de Kloet and Jo¨els, 2024; Das-
kalakis  et  al.,  2022).  We  found  that  MRs  regulate  baseline  FKBP5 
expression, which in turn sets the sensitivity of GR signaling under acute 
stress  (Hartmann  et  al.,  2021).  This  work  revealed  an  MR-FKBP5-GR 
feedback loop that fines-tunes hippocampal glucocorticoid responsive-
ness, providing new insight into how MR signaling, often underappre-
ciated in stress research, contributes to psychiatric disease risk.

Upon establishing my independent lab, I focused on understanding 
how stress signaling is regulated in the brain beyond traditional HPA 
axis components. We were the first to identify a novel function for SKA2 
(spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 2), a gene previ-
ously recognized solely for its function in cell cycle regulation (Hanisch 
et al., 2006), in modulating stress signaling in the brain. Although SKA2 
had been identified as a GR interactor in peripheral dividing cells (Rice 
et  al.,  2008)  and  had  been  associated  with  stress-related  psychiatric 
disorders including PTSD and suicide risk (Sadeh et al., 2016a, 2016b; 
Kaminsky et al., 2015; Boks et al., 2016; Pandey et al., 2016), its func-
tion  in  nonreplicating,  postmitotic  neurons,  and  its  potential  role  in 
regulating  HPA  axis  activity,  had  remained  unexplored.  Our  research 
demonstrated  that SKA2  promotes  GR nuclear  translocation  by  facili-
tating  FKBP4  binding  and  dissociating  FKBP5  from  the  GR-HSP90 
complex  (Hartmann  et  al.,  2024a).  This  mechanism  is  essential  for 
maintaining  HPA  axis  responsiveness  and  allostasis,  key  processes 
implicated in stress-related psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disor-
der (BD). Notably, we observed altered SKA2 expression in the hippo-
campus and amygdala of individuals with BD, suggesting that SKA2 may 
contribute to disease-relevant dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling. 
Together,  these  findings  reveal  SKA2  as  a  previously  unrecognized 
modulator of stress responsiveness in the brain and a potential target for 
therapeutic intervention.

Building on this GR-focused framework, in close collaboration with 
Nils Gassen and his lab at the University of Bonn, we uncovered a sec-
ond, GR-independent role for SKA2 in regulating secretory autophagy, a 
non-lytic  vesicle-mediated  process  by  which  pro-inflammatory  cyto-
kines such as IL-1β  are released (Ponpuak et al., 2015; Dupont et al., 
2011; Kimura et al., 2017). We found that SKA2 inhibits FKBP5-driven 
IL-1β secretion through suppression of secretory autophagy (Hartmann 
et  al.,  2024b;  Bajaj  et  al.,  2024).  This  regulation  appears  especially 
relevant  in  microglia,  where  stress  alters  autophagic  and  cytokine 
pathways. These results expand the functional landscape of SKA2 and 
FKBP5,  identifying  them  as  multi-function  proteins  that  coordinate 
glucocorticoid  signaling  and  inflammatory  responses  through  distinct 
intracellular  mechanisms.  In  addition  to  its  roles  in  stress  hormone 
signaling  and  neuroinflammation,  FKBP5  also  contributes  to  systemic 
metabolic 
status  as  a  pleiotropic 
stress-responsive protein. Studies have shown that FKBP5 modulates Akt 
signaling, glucose uptake, and insulin sensitivity, and is implicated in 
adipocyte differentiation and energy metabolism-linking chronic stress 
to metabolic dysfunction and systemic inflammation (Balsevich et al., 
2014, 2017; H¨ausl et al., 2019, 2022; Sidibeh et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 
2014; Zannas et al., 2019; H¨ahle et al., 2019; Smedlund et al., 2021). 
This conceptual shift, from stress hormone regulation to immune mod-
ulation, has laid the foundation for my lab’s current research program, 
which  aims  to  understand  how  chronic  stress  drives  neuroimmune 
dysfunction and psychiatric disease risk.

Harvard  Medical School.  Our  research  aims  to map  how  intracellular 
stress signaling pathways, particularly GR, FKBP5,  FKBP4, and SKA2, 
interact with immune and microbial systems to shape long-term stress 
outcomes. Our work spans genetically engineered mouse models, tran-
scriptomics, behavioral phenotyping, microbiome profiling and human 
postmortem tissue analysis. Through this multidisciplinary lens, we aim 
to  build  an  integrated  model  of  stress  biology  that  links  intracellular 
dynamics to whole-organism and population-level outcomes.

3.1. Secretory autophagy: a molecular bridge between stress and 
neuroinflammation

A growing body of evidence implicates neuroinflammatory processes 
in the etiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as PTSD and 
MDD. Both epidemiological and preclinical studies indicate that chronic 
stress  alters  microglial  function,  priming  the  brain’s  immune  system 
toward  hyper-responsivity.  Yet  the  intracellular  mechanisms  linking 
neuronal  stress  signaling  to  immune  activation  remain  incompletely 
defined.

Our lab is investigating secretory autophagy as one such mechanism. 
In  contrast  to  canonical  degradative  autophagy,  secretory  autophagy 
facilitates  the  extracellular  release  of  cytokines  and  other  vesicular 
contents. Given that both FKBP5 and SKA2 modulate this pathway, we 
hypothesize that stress-induced transcriptional changes in these genes 
alter the brain’s inflammatory set point. Using molecular assays, region- 
specific  knockouts,  and  chronic  stress  paradigms,  we  are  identifying 
molecular  checkpoints  at  which  secretory  autophagy  becomes  dysre-
gulated.  Our  goal  is  to  determine  how  this  pathway  contributes  to 
behavioral pathology and to uncover novel targets for immunomodu-
lation in stress-related disease.

3.2. Expanding toward a holistic view: microbiome-based interventions

In parallel, our lab is investigating a distinct but complementary axis: 
the role of the gut microbiome in shaping stress responses and resilience. 
While  initially  viewed  through  the  lens  of  metabolic  health,  the  gut 
microbiome  is  now  understood  to  regulate  immune,  endocrine,  and 
neural  systems,  making  it  a  powerful  potential  modulator  of  stress- 
related behavior. Although its specific role in stress-related psychiatric 
disorders  remains  incompletely  defined,  there  is  increasing  evidence 
that  microbial  composition  influences  HPA  axis  activity,  anxiety-like 
behavior,  and  cognition  (Ke  et  al.,  2023).  We  aim  to  identify  how 
stress-induced shifts in microbial composition affect brain function and 
behavior,  and  test  whether  dietary  and  probiotic  interventions  can 
restore microbial balance and improve molecular and behavioral out-
comes. These efforts reflect a broader transition in our lab’s approach, 
from circuit-specific mechanistic studies to systems-level investigations 
that  encompass  both  central  and  peripheral  contributors  to  stress 
vulnerability.  In  doing  so,  we  aim  to  build  a  more  holistic  model  of 
stress-related disease and resilience.

4. Looking ahead: toward a systems-level model of stress

Moving forward, the field of stress neurobiology must transition from 
a compartmentalized view to one that embraces the full complexity of 
multisystem  interactions.  While  past  work  has  yielded  important  in-
sights  into  neurocircuitry,  immune  signaling,  endocrinology,  and  pe-
ripheral  physiology,  these  domains  are  increasingly  recognized  as 
interdependent. Chronic stress disrupts not only brain function but also 
the communication between central and peripheral systems, including 
the  immune  system,  endocrine  pathways,  and  gut  microbiota.  A  new 
framework is needed, one that captures this dynamic interplay and re-
flects the real-world complexity of stress-related disorders.

Future  progress  will  depend  on  our  ability  to  map  bidirectional 
signaling across brain and body. For instance, stress-induced changes in 
microbial  composition  can  influence  brain  function  via  cytokine 

3 

production,  vagal  signaling,  and  microglial  activation.  Conversely, 
central  neuroendocrine  responses  can  reshape  the  gut  and  immune 
landscape.  Identifying  biomarkers  that  reflect  these  integrated  states, 
and that can be tracked across development and context, may offer a 
path toward precision psychiatry. Systems biology and high-throughput 
approaches will be essential, as will computational modeling to uncover 
causal links and regulatory networks.

To  complement  this  systems-level  approach,  it  will  be  critical  to 
account  for  both  cell-type-specific  and  sex-specific  effects.  Emerging 
evidence highlights that stress responses are shaped by distinct cellular 
populations,  including  specific  neuronal  subtypes,  glial  cells,  and  im-
mune  effectors,  as  well  as  by  biological  sex  (Cathomas  et  al.,  2022; 
Bangasser and Wicks, 2017; Heck and Handa, 2019). These factors in-
fluence  not  only  susceptibility  and  resilience  but  also  treatment  re-
sponses. My lab aims to incorporate cell-type specific manipulations and 
analyses,  and  sex-balanced  experimental  designs  to  systematically 
dissect these variables. This work will help build a more granular and 
inclusive understanding of stress biology, better reflecting the hetero-
geneity seen in clinical populations.

Translational relevance will also require closer integration between 
animal models and human data. Transcriptomics, digital phenotyping, 
longitudinal behavioral tracking, and biospecimen collection in diverse 
populations  can  help  bridge  this  gap.  Ultimately,  advancing  our  un-
derstanding of stress biology will require sustained collaboration across 
disciplines. Neuroscience alone cannot solve the puzzle of adversity; it 
must  be  joined  by  psychiatry,  endocrinology,  immunology,  microbi-
ology, data science, and other disciplines.

One  initiative  that  exemplifies  this  approach  is  the  Biology  of 
Adversity  Project  at  the  Broad  Institute  of  MIT  and  Harvard  (https 
://www.broadinstitute.org/biology-of-adversity-project).  This  collabo-
rative effort brings together researchers from across domains to under-
stand how stress and adversity shape biological systems from molecular 
signaling and circuit function to population health. By integrating data 
across  species,  tissues,  and  developmental  stages,  the  project  aims  to 
identify common biological mechanisms that underlie vulnerability and 
resilience. As a contributing investigator, I am particularly focused on 
linking  mechanistic  insights  such  as  GR  dynamics  and  neuroimmune 
regulation,  to  broader  frameworks  that  account  for  human  diversity, 
environmental exposures, and early-life programming.

Our ongoing and future work seeks to illuminate how intracellular 
stress  sensors  such  as  FKBP5  and  SKA2  participate  in  multisystem 
adaptation,  how  microbiota-derived  signals  influence  brain  function, 
and  how  molecular  pathways  converge  on  resilience  or  risk.  By 
embracing integrative and collaborative models, we hope to move the 
field  toward  interventions  that  are  both  biologically  grounded  and 
clinically impactful, supporting resilience across life stages, diagnoses, 
and populations.

5. Concluding remarks

Stress-related  psychiatric  disorders  arise  from  a  complex  web  of 
molecular, cellular, and systemic dysregulation. To fully understand this 
web and to identify tractable points for intervention, we must integrate 
insights  from  stress  hormone  signaling,  immune  responses,  and  envi-
ronmental influences. My work has traced a path from intracellular GR 
modulators like FKBP5 and SKA2 to broader questions about how stress 
is encoded across tissues and timescales. As the field continues to evolve, 
I  believe  that  embracing  cross-disciplinary,  systems-level  approaches 
will be key to advancing both basic understanding and clinical trans-
lation. By investigating the molecular underpinnings of resilience, we 
move closer to developing interventions that not only mitigate pathol-
ogy, but strengthen the capacity to adapt. The next generation of stress 
research will depend not only on understanding vulnerability, but on 
uncovering  the  molecular  signatures  of  resilience  and  transforming 
them into tools for prevention and repair.
