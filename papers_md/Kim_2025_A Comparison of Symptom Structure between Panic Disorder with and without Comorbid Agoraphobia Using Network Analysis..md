Purpose: Panic disorder (PD) and PD with comorbid agoraphobia (PDA) share similar clinical characteristics but possess distinct 
symptom structures. However, studies specifically investigating the differences between PD and PDA are rare. Thus, the present 
study conducted a network analysis to examine the clinical networks of PD and PDA, focusing on panic symptom severity, anxiety 
sensitivity, anticipatory fear, and avoidance responses. By comparing the differences in network structures between PD and PDA, 
with the goal of identifying the central and bridge, we suggest clinical implications for the development of targeted interventions.
Materials and Methods: A total sample (n=147; 55 male, 92 female) was collected from the psychiatric outpatient clinic of the uni-
versity hospital. We conducted network analysis to examine crucial nodes in the PD and PDA networks and compared the two net-
works to investigate disparities and similarities in symptom structure.
Results: The most influential node within the PD network was Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised (ASI-R1; fear of respiratory symp-
tom), whereas Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS5; phobic avoidance of physical sensations) had the highest influence in the 
PDA network. Additionally, bridge centrality estimates indicated that each of the two nodes met the criteria for “bridge nodes” 
within their respective networks: ASI-R1 (fear of respiratory symptom) and Albany Panic and Phobic Questionnaire (APPQ3; in-
teroceptive fear) for the PD group, and PDSS5 (phobic avoidance of physical sensation) and APPQ1 (panic frequency) for the 
PDA group
Conclusion: Although the network comparison test did not reveal statistical differences between the two networks, disparities in 
community structure, as well as central and bridging symptoms, were observed, suggesting the possibility of distinct etiologies 
and treatment targets for each group. The clinical implications derived from the similarities and differences between PD and PDA 
networks are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Panic disorder (PD) and agoraphobia are prevalent anxiety 
disorders, marked by distinct yet interrelated symptomatolo-
gy.1,2 PD manifests through maladaptive cognitive and behav-
ioral changes following recurrent panic attacks (PAs), often 
dubbed “the most physical of mental disorders.”3 Agoraphobia, 
on the other hand, encompasses anxiety surrounding specific 
places or situations.4 Amid the emergence of coronavirus dis-
ease-2019 (COVID-19), these disorders have garnered un-
precedented clinical attention. This heightened focus reflects 
augmented sensitivity to physical symptoms, particularly 

277

ed or enclosed spaces since the onset of the pandemic. Nota-
bly, statistics from Korea revealed a 46.7% surge in PD patients 
and a staggering 167% increase in agoraphobia cases post-
COVID-19.5

Against the backdrop of the burgeoning global burden of anx-
iety disorders, research on PD and agoraphobia is of paramount 
importance. With an estimated 28.68 million disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) attributed to anxiety disorders worldwide in 
2019, compared to 18.66 million in 1990, and an age-standard-
ized DALYs rate of 3.60 per 1000 population in 2019, these disor-
ders undeniably impose substantial health losses on a global 
scale.6 The recent surge in patient numbers and clinical atten-
tion towards PD and agoraphobia underscores the pressing 
need for accurate comprehension and treatment of these condi-
tions, both from social and economic standpoints. Given the in-
tricate interplay between these disorders, addressing this nexus 
has become even more pivotal.7

Previously, PAs played a central role in the development of 
agoraphobia until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders, Fourth Edition era. Agoraphobia was delineated 
as fear or anxiety arising when escape might prove challenging 
during panic-like symptoms.8 However, the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifh Edition (DSM-5) 
broadened this scope, encompassing fear or anxiety in diverse 
situations, without explicit reference to PAs. Despite this shift, 
PD and agoraphobia remain closely intertwined, with symp-
toms frequently embedded in the diagnostic criteria of oth-
ers.9,10 The co-occurrence of PD and agoraphobia is associated 
with poor prognosis and treatment outcomes, including an in-
creased likelihood of hospitalization and compromised social 
functioning.11,12 Therefore, distinguishing PD with and without 
comorbid agoraphobia is clinically important but challenging. 
PD and PD with comorbid agoraphobia (PDA) share com-
mon underlying features, such as anxiety sensitivity (AS), an-
ticipatory fear, and avoidance responses, which are pivotal tar-
gets for therapeutic interventions.13,14 AS is primarily considered 
the bridging link between understanding PAs and agorapho-
bia.15-17 AS, also known as the “fear of anxiety itself,” refers to 
the trait in which one believes that experiencing anxiety and 
its related symptoms leads to catastrophic outcomes. Com-
pared to other anxiety-related disorders in the PD model, AS is 
a panicogenic factor that plays a particularly distinctive role in 
triggering PAs and maintaining PD.18 A high AS increases the 
probability of misappraisal of internal cues and habituates an 
exaggerated fear of daily physical sensations, such as changes 
in heart rate.13,16,19 In line with this mechanism, elevated AS has 
been theorized as a predisposing factor for the onset and wors-
ening of anxiety-related disorders,20 and evidence has revealed 
that AS is a stable predictor of the development and mainte-
nance of anxiety disorders, particularly PD.19 Thus, understand-
ing AS is crucial for shedding light on the etiology of PD and 
agoraphobia.

278

Another key feature of PD and PDA is the anticipatory fear 
and avoidance responses.21 Phobic situations are not limited to 
mere exposure to external phobic situations (e.g., using public 
transportation, being in open/enclosed places, standing in line), 
but also include fear of interoceptive symptoms (e.g., nausea or 
abdominal discomfort, sweating, chills, or hot flushes) that pro-
duce somatic sensations.22 According to the generic cognitive 
model, the appraisal of interoceptive stimuli is erroneously re-
garded as a sign of an impending catastrophe associated with 
the development of PAs.23 Misinterpretation of minor respira-
tory disturbances caused by CO2 as oxygen deprivation can 
trigger panic symptoms and induce agoraphobic avoidance. 
This misinterpretation leads to increased fear and activates 
avoidance tactics against PAs, thereby reinforcing catastrophic 
cognition, which reaffirms the initial misinterpretation.22,24 
Therefore, assessing and understanding anticipatory fear and 
avoidance responses in phobic situations may have important 
implications in clinical approaches to PD and agoraphobia.

In recent years, the network analysis of psychopathology has 
emerged as a valuable tool for understanding the complex in-
terplay of symptoms in psychiatric disorders.18,25 The network 
refers to the complex web of symptoms containing “nodes” that 
stand for one symptom, while “edges” represent the partial cor-
relation coefficient between two nodes,26 and larger relations 
form communities (i.e., clusters or dimensions) in the network. 
By identifying central nodes and bridge symptoms within the 
network, network analysis offers insights into the underlying 
mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and informs the develop-
ment of targeted interventions.27,28 In addition, bridge symptoms 
that link two or more clusters of symptoms together, thereby 
activating multiple clusters simultaneously, can also be identi-
fied, which contribute to the maintenance of comorbid symp-
toms; hence, targeting these symptoms may mitigate the co-
morbid state.29 There has been an increasing number of network 
analysis studies on PD, but most have focused on examining the 
relationship between PD and other psychiatric symptoms, such 
as depression.30 However, research exploring the subtle rela-
tionship between PD and PDA, each of which significantly af-
fect the severity and prognosis of the disorder, remains scarce.
The present study aimed to use network analysis to explore 
the clinical network structure based on panic symptom severi-
ty, particularly focusing on AS, anticipatory fear, and avoidance 
responses. Additionally, it sought to compare the network 
structures between PD and PDA to identify central and bridge 
symptoms. These findings are expected to offer valuable in-
sights for developing targeted interventions tailored to the spe-
cific characteristics of each disorder, ultimately improving the 
treatment efficacy and reducing the overall socioeconomic 
burden associated with these conditions.

Symptom Networks in Panic Disorder and Agoraphobiahttps://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2024.0177MATERIALS AND METHODS

Statistical analyses

Participants
To conduct a network analysis comparing PD and PDA, we ex-
tracted data from all patients who complained of panic-related 
symptoms during their first visit to a psychiatric outpatient 
clinic at a university hospital in South Korea (Gangnam Sever-
ance Hospital, Seoul, Korea) between September 2020 and 
February 2022. Patients were excluded based on the following 
criteria: 1) patients who failed to complete all clinical scales on 
panic and agoraphobia symptoms, and 2) patients who were 
not diagnosed with PD or PDA according to the DSM-5. Our 
data were obtained during routine clinical process, and since 
our study was retrospectively conducted, informed consent 
was waived. The study design and protocol were approved by 
the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University Gangnam 
Severance Hospital (3-2022-0465).

Measures

Panic Disorder Severity Scale
Trained clinical psychologists measured PD severity using the 
Korean version of the Panic Disorder Severity Scale  (PDSS),31,32 
rated by trained clinical psychologists. The scale comprises 
seven items: frequency of PAs, panic distress, anticipatory 
anxiety, agoraphobic fear/avoidance, interoceptive fear/
avoidance, work impairment/distress, and social impair-
ment/distress, with higher scores indicating higher levels of 
panic severity. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none, 
4=extreme). 

Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised
AS and its dimensions were measured using the Korean ver-
sion of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised (ASI-R),33,34 a self-
reported scale in which respondents are asked to rate each item 
on a 5-point scale (0=none; 4=extreme). The scale is com-
posed of 36 items that measure four subscales: fear of respira-
tory symptoms, fear of publicly observable anxiety reactions, 
fear of cardiovascular symptoms, and fear of cognitive dyscon-
trol. Higher scores indicate higher levels of AS. 

Albany Panic and Phobic Questionnaire
Interoceptive, agoraphobic, and social situational fears were 
measured using the Korean version of the Albany Panic and 
Phobic Questionnaire (APPQ),33,35 a self-reported scale in which 
respondents are asked to rate each item on a 9-point scale 
(0=none; 8=extreme). The scale consists of 27 items that mea-
sure the “fear of agoraphobic situations,” “fear of social situa-
tions,” and “fear of activities that produce somatic sensations,” 
with higher scores indicating higher levels of fear. 

Descriptive and correlations
Descriptive analyses (frequency distributions) were performed 
to examine the prevalence and range of demographic and pan-
ic-related clinical symptoms (PDSS, ASI-R, and APPQ). Cross-
tabulations were conducted to investigate the differences be-
tween PD and PDA using independent t-tests for continuous 
variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. Addi-
tionally, Cohen’s d was calculated to interpret the effect size for 
the t-test, where values of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 represented small, 
medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. Next, Pearson cor-
relation analysis was conducted to examine the associations 
between each symptom.

Network estimation techniques
Network analyses were conducted using the R software (v. 
4.2.2.; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Aus-
tria).36 The polychoric network for all nodes was calculated 
based on the Gaussian graphical model (GGM) with the graph-
ic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and 
the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) model 
using the qgraph package version 1.6.7. The qgraph package 
uses two estimators: the EBICglasso algorithm for regularized 
GGM estimation and the ggmModSelect algorithm for poten-
tially non-regularized model research. Both estimations are 
primarily based on the graphical LASSO (glasso) algorithm in 
combination with EBIC model selection, EBICglasso estima-
tion is a commonly used procedure for network analysis in 
psychopathological research.26 In this context, unregularized 
estimators are preferred for discovering individual edges (speci-
ficity) rather than focusing solely on the strongest edges (preci-
sion), particularly when the sample size is less than 300.37 This 
study examined the polychoric differences between PDSS, ASI-
R, and APPQ symptoms in the psychopathology of PD and PDA 
status in terms of specificity. Therefore, we used a non-regular-
ized ggmModSelect algorithm for calculations, as focusing on 
specificity may have clinical implications. 

Community detection and bridge centrality 
The network community structure and bridge nodes were eval-
uated using the EGAnet and networktools packages,29,38 respec-
tively. First, the Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) was conduct-
ed to detect communities in both PD and PDA. Communities 
are clusters of highly connected variables, equivalent to factors 
in the context of factor analysis.38 However, EGA produces more 
robust and accurate results than traditional latent factor anal-
ysis when based on edges.38 Thus, we used the Walktrap algo-
rithm based on random walks, that is, steps from one node to 
another randomly chosen in the network, to calculate the mod-
ularity and explore the number of compositions of individual 
symptoms in each group. To estimate the median number of 
communities, 1000 bootstrap samples were generated using 

279

Joonbeom Kim, et al.https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2024.0177the bootEGA function. To quantify the importance of individ-
ual nodes in the network, one- and two-step expected influ-
ences (EI1 and EI2, respectively) were computed using the 
qgraph package. This approach is regarded as more accurate 
for calculating influential nodes than traditional centrality in-
dices, such as strength, closeness, and betweenness.39 Fur-
thermore, as EI1 does not consider information regarding the 
expected influence of the connected node, we only reported 
metrics as EI2 to account for both immediate and secondary 
influences on the network through its neighbors.39 Next, we 
identified important nodes that had the strongest connections 
and acted as bridges between detected communities by calcu-
lating the one- and two-step bridge expected influence (BEI1 
and BEI2, respectively) using the bridge function.29 Edge-
weight metrics from ggmModSelect were used to identify 
bridge nodes based on the centrality indices. The BEI is calculat-
ed by summing a node’s edge weights, but only the edges that 
connect nodes from one community to another are counted. 
Tests for significant differences between the BEI values of the 
individual nodes were conducted using bootstrap analysis.

To further ensure the validity of centrality, a case-dropping 
bootstrap procedure was implemented using the bootnet pack-
age.40 The stability of all centralities was estimated by calculat-
ing correlation stability (CS) coefficients. The CS indicates the 

proportion of cases that can be dropped while maintaining a 
95% probability that 10000 bootstrapped correlations between 
true and resampled centrality indices are greater than 0.25, 
with a preferred value above 0.5. The predictability, which re-
flects how well all neighboring nodes predict a specific node, 
was estimated using the mgm package.41

Network comparison
A network comparison test (NCT) was performed to investi-
gate the differences in the network structures between PD and 
PDA using the NetworkComparisonTest package.41 NCT utiliz-
es permutations to explore the differences in network structure 
between groups by testing invariance in global strength (the 
sum of all edge weights), network structure (e.g., distributions of 
edge weights), and specific edge values between two networks.

RESULTS

Sample characteristics and comparisons by group
A total of 709 outpatients were initially screened by psychia-
trists and divided into PD and PDA groups according to the 
DSM-5. A total of 561 patients were excluded based on the cri-
teria, leaving 147 patients included in the final analysis. Table 1

Symptom Networks in Panic Disorder and Agoraphobiahttps://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2024.0177presents the characteristics of the participants and compari-
sons by group. Of the total sample, 62.6% (n=92) were female 
and the mean age was 36.3 years. In the PDA group, the ma-
jority of participants were female (74.6%, n=44), and the mean 
age (34.3±13.4 years) did not significantly differ between the 
two groups. The PDA group showed more severe symptoms 
compared to the PD group in almost all areas. APPQ1 (agora-
phobia) had the largest effect size (Cohen’s d=2.76) between 
the groups, followed by ASI-R2 (fear of publicly observable anx-
iety reaction), APPQ3 (interoceptive fear), and ASI-R4 (fear of 
cognitive dyscontrol), whereas neither PDSS1 (panic frequency) 
nor PDSS5 (phobic avoidance of physical sensation) showed 
statistical significance.

Correlations of the variables of interest
Bivariate correlation analysis was conducted for the PDSS, ASI-
R, and APPQ. As illustrated in Fig. 1, all correlations were sta-
tistically significant in the predicted direction, except between 
ASI-R3 (fear of cardiovascular symptom) and PDSS4 (phobic 
avoidance of situations) (r=0.11, p>0.05). As shown in Fig. 1, 
ASI-R1 (fear of respiratory symptom) and ASI-R3 (fear of car-
diovascular symptom) were highly correlated (r=0.73). Howev-

er, none of the correlations exceeded the cut-off for multicol-
linearity (r>0.84).

Network structure and centrality
The estimated network and detected communities based on 
the 13 clinical symptoms in each PD and PDA sample are pre-
sented in Table 2 and Fig. 2. The CS coefficients for the expect-
ed influence of both networks were 0.36 and 0.31, respectively, 
which were above the acceptable cut-off score of 0.25. Within 
the PD network, the edge weight between ASI-R1 and ASI-R3 
(fear of respiratory symptom-fear of cardiovascular symptom) 
was the strongest, followed by edges APPQ1-APPQ2 (agora-
phobia-social phobia), ASI-R3-APPQ3 (fear of cardiovascular 
symptom-interoceptive fear), PDSS4-PDSS5 (phobic avoid-
ance of situations-phobic avoidance of physical sensation), and 
PDSS2-ASI-R1 (distress during panic-fear of respiratory symp-
tom) (Fig. 3). In contrast, the edge between PDSS2-PDSS3 (dis-
tress during panic- panic-focused anticipatory anxiety) was the 
strongest in the PDA, followed by ASI-R2-APPQ2 (fear of pub-
licly observable anxiety reaction-social phobia), ASI-R1-ASI-R3 
(fear of respiratory symptom-fear of cardiovascular symptom), 
PDSS3-PDSS7 (panic-focused anticipatory anxiety-impairment

in social functioning), and PDSS1-APPQ1 (panic frequency-ag-
oraphobia). The node predictability index ranged from 31.7% 
to 77.2% and from 34.3% to 66.7% in each network, with an av-
erage of approximately 49.0%, accounting for half of the vari-
ance that could be explained by neighboring nodes. 

The EI metrics were calculated for each network to determine 
the most influential nodes. The most influential node within the 
PD network was ASI-R1 (fear of respiratory symptom, EI=2.49), 
followed by PDSS2 (distress during panic, EI=2.26), and PDSS5 
(phobic avoidance of physical sensation, EI=1.91). In contrast, 
PDSS5 (phobic avoidance of physical sensations, EI=2.29) had 
the greatest influence on the PDA network, followed by PDSS2 
(distress during panic, EI=2.14) and ASI-R3 (fear of cardiovascu-
lar symptom, EI=1.98). Next, the CS coefficients for the bridge 
expected influence of both networks were 0.38 and 0.33, re-
spectively, which were also above the acceptable cut-off score. 
Bridge centrality estimates using BEI2s indicated that each of 
two nodes had the highest BEI2s in their respective commu-
nities (Z-score ≥1) and were thus identified as bridge nodes in 
the individual networks; ASI-R1 (fear of respiratory symptom), 
APPQ3 (interoceptive fear), PDSS5 (phobic avoidance of phys-
ical sensation), and APPQ1 (panic frequency). 

Community detection and comparison of PD versus 
PDA
The communities detected in each PD and PDA sample are 
shown in Fig. 2. In the PD network, 23 of the 91 possible edges 
(25.2%) were not zero, and the EGA revealed two communi-
ties. The first community comprised the ASI-R and the APPQ 
(“anxiety sensitivity with panic and phobia”), while the second 
community solely consisted of PDSS (“panic symptom severi-

ty”). In the PDA network, 21 of the 91 possible edges (23.1%) 
were not zero, and four dimensions with mixed PDSS, ASI-R, 
and APPQ scores were detected: 1) diagnostic symptoms of 
PD, 2) anticipatory fear, 3) avoidance behavior, and 4) social 
anxiety. The first dimension was composed mainly of diagno-
sis-related symptoms, such as panic frequency, anticipatory 
anxiety, and impairment in work functioning. The “anticipato-
ry fear” included fear of interoceptive symptoms and cognitive 
dyscontrol, and the third “avoidance behavior” dimension com-
prised phobic avoidance of situations and physical sensations, 
impairment in social functioning, and the severity of agorapho-
bic symptoms. Lastly, “social anxiety” dimension comprised 
fear of publicly observable anxiety reaction and social phobia. 
When examining the statistical differences between networks 
using NCT, we found no significant differences in the overall 
network structure (network structure maximum=0.35, p=0.58) 
or global strength (global strength=5.86, p=0.52). 

DISCUSSION

The current study examined the intricate relationships among 
panic-related symptoms in patients with PD and PDA using net-
work analysis. While the two groups’ network structures and 
overall global strength did not significantly differ, suggesting a 
strong similarity between the conditions, notable variations were 
observed in community structure. These differences could be 
important when considering the underlying mechanisms and 
tailoring clinical interventions for each condition. To ensure the 
robustness of these findings, highly reliable and validated psy-
chometric scales were employed. Specifically, the Korean ver-

sion of the ASI-R demonstrated excellent internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s alpha: 0.967), the APPQ showed strong reliability 
(Cronbach’s alpha: 0.920), and the PDSS presented an accept-
able level of consistency (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.871). The strong 
reliability of these measures further reinforces the validity of 

the observed network patterns and differences.

The PD network was composed of two communities. One 
community consisted solely of the PDSS, and the combined 
ASI-R and APPQ cluster formed the other community. In oth-
er words, the former focused on diagnosing PD and directly

determining its severity through specific items, whereas the lat-
ter focused on items related to anxiety levels and avoidance be-
haviors. Within the symptom network structure of PD, fear of 
respiration (ASI-R1) and distress during panic (PDSS2) have 
emerged as key factors that maintain and aggravate PD symp-
toms, given their high EI measure. Moreover, PD severity was 

associated with respiratory fear (ASI-R1) and interoceptive fear 
(APPQ3). Symptoms of respiratory fear (ASI-R1) and interocep-
tive fear (APPQ3) emerged as potential risk factors contributing 
to the escalation of PD severity.

Furthermore, respiratory symptoms within the PD network 
were strongly correlated with other symptoms and played a cen-

284

Symptom Networks in Panic Disorder and Agoraphobiahttps://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2024.0177tral role in the manifestation of the disorder and network activa-
tion. Moreover, they demonstrated significant associations with 
panic severity symptoms within the community. Therefore, re-
spiratory symptoms appeared to be pivotal indicators of PD. 
This result is consistent with the previous literature regarding the 
relationship between respiratory symptoms and other panic 
symptoms. Respiratory abnormalities, namely greater breath-
to-breath variability, irregular respiratory frequency, excessive 
sighing, and tidal volume irregularity,42,43 are common symp-
toms in patients with PD during PAs. The suffocation false-alarm 
theory (SFA) postulates that PAs occur when the brain misinter-
prets the amount of air available and sends a false alarm to a suf-
focation alarm system.44 According to SFA, PAs are the result of 
an oversensitive fear network that is closely related to the central 
nucleus of the amygdala (CNA).42 CNA increases respiratory rate, 
leading to an increased risk of false suffocation alarms that 
eventually trigger PAs.44 Thus, along with previous literature, 
our results also showed that managing respiratory symptoms is 
crucial for patients with PD, highlighting the role of breathing 
exercises and exposure therapy for PAs. 

In contrast, community detection identified four clusters in 
the PDA network. More intricate communities within the PDA 
network may suggest that the symptoms observed in PDA are 
interconnected in a more complex manner, indicating the 
possibility of numerous comorbid pathways. This suggests 
potential heterogeneity between the two groups.45 One com-
munity mainly consisted of PD diagnostic symptoms, and the 
other three communities represented subsets of anxiety-related 
symptoms of PD and PDA: anticipatory fear, avoidance re-
sponse, and social anxiety. The central symptoms of the PDA 
network were phobic avoidance of physical sensation (PDSS5) 
and distress during panic (PDSS2), whereas symptoms closely 
associated with the manifestation of other communities were 
agoraphobia (APPQ1) and phobic avoidance of physical sen-
sation (PDSS5). 

It is intriguing and worth noting that within the PDA net-
work, PDSS5 emerges as a central and bridging symptom, de-
spite not exhibiting significantly higher scores than other items 
in the PDSS. This suggests that severity, represented as an indi-
vidual item score, may not be actively expressed by patients in 
clinical settings, potentially leading to oversight. Despite this, 
it displayed a stronger association with other indicators. Given 
its highest EI measure within the PDA network, avoidance be-
havior related to physical symptoms may play a primary role in 
exacerbating or maintaining a wide range of symptoms within 
PD, including symptoms of PAs, anticipatory anxiety, and social 
and occupational dysfunctions. Moreover, it provides a predic-
tive link to the manifestation of symptoms such as anticipatory 
anxiety and impaired social functioning in other communities. 
Therefore, despite not attaining high scores on clinical assess-
ments, it should be regarded as a significant marker that requires 
careful attention and targeting. This finding can be regarded as a 
valuable outcome that confirms the utility of this study and net-

work analysis, highlighting its clinical implications.

These results showed that the PD and PDA networks share 
many common characteristics, suggesting underlying similari-
ties in the factors contributing to PD and PDA. In both net-
works, despite having different structures, central and bridge 
symptoms were consistently observed within the anxiety-relat-
ed communities. In other words, while PAs are the hallmark 
symptoms of PD, it is one’s perspective and coping strategy, 
rather than the frequency or intensity of the attacks themselves, 
that determine the severity and maintenance of the disorder. 
This reaffirms the role of cognitive and behavioral coping 
mechanisms in the treatment of PD, specifically the develop-
ment and implementation of these mechanisms through cog-
nitive and behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is an evidence-based 
treatment for PD and PDA, demonstrating superior therapeu-
tic outcomes compared to other treatment approaches.46 It is a 
well-established therapy that yields successful treatment out-
comes, whether administered individually or in group settings 
via the Internet or through self-guided interventions.

Moreover, in both groups, fear and distress experienced by 
patients during PAs contributed to the severity of the disorder 
and perpetuated other symptoms. The EI centrality of the nodes 
identified distress during panic (PDSS2) as the core symptom 
with a high centrality value in both groups. The average PDSS in 
the PD group was mild, whereas that in the PDA group was 
moderate. Regardless of the objective severity of symptoms, 
there is a possibility that the distress experienced subjectively 
by patients plays a significant role in the manifestation of the 
disorder.47,48 Therefore, interventions that aim to alleviate the 
distress associated with panic attacks and help patients cope 
should take precedence in any disorder involving PAs. This 
finding further supports the rationale of previous studies that 
have examined the efficacy and effectiveness of CBT in PD. 
Particularly, it underscores the crucial role of basic techniques, 
such as breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, and interocep-
tive exposure, during the treatment process. 

These findings further reinforce the significance and effec-
tiveness of exposure therapy in treating PD and PDA, as they 
shed light on the interpretation of anxiety and coping strategies 
for distress regarding PAs. Exposure training, which involves 
exposing patients to anxiety-inducing stimuli to eliminate fear 
responses, is a fundamental aspect of panic treatment.3 Vari-
ous techniques have been developed, ranging from exposure 
training that focuses on specific symptoms of PA to imagery ex-
posure, in which patients imagine fearful situations in a thera-
py setting, and in vivo exposure therapy, which involves direct-
ly confronting feared real-life situations. Extensive research 
has been conducted over an extended period, providing evi-
dence for the effectiveness of these techniques in treating PD 
and PDA.49

However, the findings of this study also indicate that distinc-
tive characteristics may exist between the two clinical groups, 
suggesting a different intervention approach. First, our find-

285

Joonbeom Kim, et al.https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2024.0177ings regarding EI measures suggest that the primary targets of 
PD and PDA in clinical intervention may differ. In our network 
model of PD, the fear of respiratory symptoms played a signifi-
cant role in maintaining or exacerbating disorders and other 
symptoms. Therefore, among the various techniques compris-
ing panic-CBT, mastering basic techniques related to bodily 
sensations, such as breathing and relaxation training, can be 
considered an essential and prioritized element of treatment 
based on our findings. However, in cases of PDA, the primary 
cause that perpetuates the disorder and causes distress for pa-
tients appears to be avoidance behavior resulting from the fear 
of these symptoms. Thus, in their treatment, it may be crucial 
to eliminate agora avoidance, as it is a prerequisite for achiev-
ing proper therapeutic effects. The results of this study suggest 
that PD and PDA can be classified as distinct symptom systems, 
aligning with previous research findings. According to a study,50 
PD is more of a distress disorder, related to emotional disorders, 
whereas PDA is more of a fear disorder, related to phobias. This 
indicates that PD and PDA represent different psychopatho-
logical constructs. Therefore, the findings of the present study 
support the conceptualization of PD and PDA as separate di-
agnostic entities, reinforcing their independent classification 
in the DSM-5.

Second, the PDA network exhibited a more intricate symp-
tom structure than that of the PDA network. This highlights the 
need for a multi-dimensional treatment approach.51 Instead of 
symptoms being highly interconnected, having multiple symp-
tom structures may indicate that PDA symptoms are composed 
of more tightly connected subgroups, necessitating a symptom-
based approach based on patterns exhibited by individuals. 
Third, the distinction between the PD and PDA networks was 
also evident in the fact that, unlike PD, the PDA network exhib-
ited a division within the panic symptom distress scale. Nota-
bly, agoraphobia was related to phobic avoidance of situations 
and physical sensations (PDSS4 & 5) along with impairment in 
social functioning (PDSS7). The emergence of PDSS5 (phobic 
avoidance of physical sensations) as a key node in PDA popu-
lations distinct from the PD network indicates the chronic de-
velopment of sensation-related fear. This chronic fear contrib-
utes to notable impairment across different aspects of life, as 
evidenced by the fact that PDSS7 is part of the same symp-
toms’ community, in which nodes specifically address social 
functioning impairment. This community structure implies that 
the PDA group exhibited a more pronounced impairment in 
social functioning attributed to phobic avoidance compared to 
the PD group. As social functioning is related to various do-
mains of life, individuals with PDA may experience more se-
vere impairments than those with PD.52 Moreover, earlier re-
search indicated that phobic avoidance stands out as the most 
reliable predictor of reduced improvement during PDA treat-
ment.53 Consequently, our study underscores the importance 
of monitoring phobic avoidance and social functioning as cru-
cial targets in the treatment of PDA. 

286

This study examined the characteristics of PD and PDA symp-
tom structures and compared them using a network analysis. 
These results demonstrated the utility of node- and symptom-
centric network analyses in understanding and treating mental 
disorders. Rather than understanding PDA as a result of merely 
adding agoraphobic features to PD symptoms, our results shed 
light on more intricate and interactive dynamics among the 
symptoms. These findings suggest that treatment tailored to 
the specific symptoms of the disorder could have a significant 
impact on treatment outcomes. 

Furthermore, the symptom-based approach to treating PD 
emphasizes the need for individualized and evidence-based 
approaches. However, the application of these techniques to 
patients requires specialized professionals, which may limit 
their time and cost-effectiveness. Recently, with advancements 
in virtual reality (VR) technology, a promising alternative that 
can address these limitations and deliver evidence-based ther-
apy has emerged. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has 
been successfully utilized in the clinical context and has been 
found to have an efficacy comparable to that of in vivo expo-
sure. Given that the flexibility and scalability of VR content 
could integrate diverse forms of content, such as psychoeduca-
tion, interoceptive exposure, and other modularized contents, 
the CBT format across VRET enables consistency in the deliv-
ery of evidence-based and personalized treatment.

Despite its novel findings and clinical implications, this study 
had several limitations. First, due to the relatively small sample 
size, the results should be interpreted with caution. There may 
have been a loss of statistical power, which often leads to diffi-
culties in finding true differences in centrality and in estimating 
more stable and accurate networks.40 Moreover, the small sam-
ple size may have influenced the results of the NCTs. Thus, fu-
ture studies should analyze data from a larger sample to esti-
mate more stable networks and examine whether the network 
structures are different. Furthermore, there are a few additional 
suggestions that consider the characteristics of the PD and 
PDA samples. Given that the prevalence rates of PD and agora-
phobia are high in women,54 future studies should compare 
the network structures of PD and PDA symptoms according to 
sex. Although this study did not include depressive symptoms 
as a measure, PD is known to be highly comorbid with depres-
sive symptoms, in severe cases. To delineate the symptom-level 
relationship between depression, panic symptoms, and agora-
phobic symptoms, it is highly recommended to add depressive 
symptoms to PD and PDA networks in future studies. Second, 
this study was cross-sectional in nature; therefore, a causal re-
lationship between the symptoms could not be assumed. We 
discovered the most influential nodes in each network; there-
fore, future studies are needed not only to confirm whether the 
results can be replicated but also to determine how they influ-
ence other nodes using longitudinal data. In addition, a previ-
ous study that analyzed a longitudinal data network indicated 
that their results demonstrated within-person differences.55 

Symptom Networks in Panic Disorder and Agoraphobiahttps://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2024.0177Hence, a longitudinal design may help clinicians understand 
the changes in the pattern of each individual’s symptom struc-
ture, thereby allowing for more precise individualized treat-
ment. Lastly, one notable limitation of this study is the inability 
to conduct sub-analyses on gender differences within each 
group using NCT. Due to the relatively small sample sizes in 
the subgroups (PD male: 40, PD female: 48, PDA male: 15, 
PDA female: 44), we encountered convergence issues in the 
network models, particularly within the smaller PDA sub-
groups. As a result, we were unable to assess potential gender 
differences in network characteristics, such as centrality and 
bridge symptoms. Future research with larger and more bal-
anced samples will be necessary to explore these differences in 
greater detail.

In conclusion, this study examined panic-related symptoms 
in patients with PD and PDA using network analysis. The two 
groups had different structures, as well as central and bridge 
symptoms, suggesting that adopting different approaches for 
each disorder could be beneficial and may be required in a 
clinical setting. The findings also revealed similarities in the fac-
tors contributing to PD and PDA, highlighting the role of cogni-
tive and behavioral coping mechanisms in treatment. Distress 
during panic was identified as the core symptom in both groups. 
These findings support the effectiveness of exposure therapy 
and the importance of addressing avoidance behaviors. Per-
sonalized treatment and VR technology have been suggested as 
potential approaches for improving treatment outcomes.
