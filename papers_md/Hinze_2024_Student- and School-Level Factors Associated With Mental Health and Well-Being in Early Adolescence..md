Objective: Adolescence is a key developmental window that may determine long-term mental health. As schools may inﬂuence mental health of
students, this study aimed to examine the association of school-level characteristics with students’ mental health over time.
Method: Longitudinal data from a cluster randomized controlled trial comprising 8,376 students (55% female; aged 11-14 years at baseline) across 84
schools in the United Kingdom were analyzed. Data collection started in the academic years 2016/2017 (cohort 1) and 2017/2018 (cohort 2), with
follow-up at 1, 1.5, and 2 years. Students’ mental health (risk for depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale], social-emotional-
behavioral difﬁculties [Strength and Difﬁculties Questionnaire]) and well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale) and relationships
with student- and school-level characteristics were explored using multilevel regression models.
Results: Mental health difﬁculties and poorer well-being increased over time, particularly in girls. Differences among schools represented a small but
statistically signiﬁcant proportion of variation (95% CI) in students’ mental health at each time point: depression, 1.7% (0.9%-2.5%) to 2.5% (1.6%-
3.4%); social-emotional-behavioral difﬁculties, 1.9% (1.1%-2.7%) to 2.8% (2.1%-3.5%); and well-being, 1.8% (0.9%-2.7%) to 2.2% (1.4%-3.0%).
Better student-rated school climate analyzed as a time-varying factor at the student and school level was associated with lower risk of depression
(regression coefﬁcient [95%CI] student level: (cid:1)4.25 [(cid:1)4.48, (cid:1)4.01]; school level: (cid:1)4.28 [(cid:1)5.81, (cid:1)2.75]), fewer social-emotional-behavioral difﬁ-
culties (student level: (cid:1)2.46 [(cid:1)2.57, (cid:1)2.35]; school level: (cid:1)2.36 [(cid:1)3.08, (cid:1)1.63]), and higher well-being (student level: 3.88 [3.70, 4.05]; school-level:
4.28 [3.17, 5.38]), which was a stable relationship.
Conclusion: Student-rated school climate predicted mental health in early adolescence. Policy and system interventions that focus on school climate
may promote students’ mental health.

High-quality research considering the role of schools
in the mental health of young people is limited. Yet,
conceptually, student- and school-level factors could be
key to the mental health and well-being of young people,
and schools offer an acceptable and efﬁcient opportunity
for intervention.3 Schools are where most young people
spend much of their waking lives. Schools can therefore
inﬂuence young people’s mental health both directly (eg,

(eg, deprivation of

management of problems of bullying) and indirectly

ethnicity) or operational features of the school itself (eg,

context
Research on the role of schools in addressing adoles-
cents’ health and behavioral problems has been active for
nearly 50 years. For example, in 1981, the Seattle Social
Development Project, a nonrandomized controlled trial
combining teacher training with parent education and
social competence training for primary school children in
urban, high-crime areas in Seattle, was launched.7 Stu-
dents receiving the intervention (vs control) reported less

by age 18 years, 6 years after the end of the intervention,
underscoring the potential role of schools in promoting
students’ health and social adjustment.7 More recent
research suggested that a positive school climate is asso-
ciated with a lower risk of not only behavioral but also
emotional problems in children and youth;
improved
student learning, academic achievement, and graduation
rates; and higher teacher retention rates.6,8 The growing
evidence in this research area has led to government
initiatives,
the Safe and Supportive Schools
Project in the United States,9 that promote school and
home connectedness to reduce students’ risk of physical
health (eg, sexually transmitted diseases), mental health
(eg, emotional distress), and behavioral (eg, violence and
substance use) problems.9 Yet, with a strong focus on

A recent study of 26,885 11- to 14-year-old adoles-
cents in 85 schools found that schools accounted for a
small but statistically signiﬁcant proportion of the varia-
tion in mental health outcomes of
(1.4%-
2.4%).10 School context (urban area), school community
(higher percentage eligible for free school meals), and
operational features of the school (school climate rated by
teachers) were cross-sectionally associated with students’
mental health and well-being. This study was guided by a
theoretical model and highlighted 3 types of school fac-
tors that might inﬂuence students’ mental health and
well-being (Figure S1, available online),
including the
broader school context (eg, rural/urban location and area-
level deprivation), characteristics of the school commu-
nity (eg, socioeconomic status, level of special educational
needs and disability, and ethnic compositions of students
within a school), and operational features of the school
(eg, school climate, quality ratings, and social-emotional-
learning provision as well as
student-to-
teacher ratio, and mixed-/single-sex schools).10 Here, we
applied the same theoretical model to explore the inﬂu-
factors on students’
ence of a broad range of school
mental health over time during early adolescence. First,
we estimated the proportion of variation in mental health
outcomes of adolescents at the school level at each time
point. Second, we explored changes in the associations
between student- and school-level
factors and mental
health outcomes over 2 years. We explored the potential
importance of gender differences in all analyses.

METHOD
Study Design and Participants
This study is a secondary analysis of longitudinal data
collected in the MYRIAD (MY Resilience In ADolescence)
trial, a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial that aimed
to establish the effects of school-based mindfulness training
on the mental health and well-being of students in early
adolescence (ISRCTN86619085, June 3, 2016).11,12 The
trial sample consisted of 8,376 students in 84 schools across
the United Kingdom (Figure 1). Study participants pro-
vided baseline data and were in classes selected for ongoing
trial participation. Informed assent/consent was obtained
from schools, parents (via opt-out), and students. Partici-
pating schools were representative of UK secondary schools
(see Supplement 1, available online, for eligibility criteria
and representativeness).10,13 The University of Oxford
Medical Sciences Division Ethics Committee (R45358/
RE001, May 23, 2016) provided ethical approvals for the
MYRIAD trial.

Participants were recruited in 2 cohorts. Data collection
for the trial sample at baseline (T0) started in the academic
years 2016/2017 (cohort 1: n ¼ 975) and 2017/2018 (cohort
2: n ¼ 7,401). Subsequent assessments were carried out after 1
year (preintervention [T1]), 1.5 years (postintervention [T2]),
and 2 years (follow-up [T3]) (Figure 1). All data used for the
present analyses were collected before the start of the COVID-
19 pandemic. There were no differences between school-based
mindfulness training (intervention) and teaching as usual in
adolescents’ mental health at follow-up in this trial (see
Table S1, available online) due to a lack of student engage-
ment.13 Hence, we analyzed participants from both trial arms
together, but adjusted for trial arm status. Additional infor-
mation can be found in the trial protocol and update.11,12

Measures
Student mental health was quantiﬁed using 3 outcome
measures: risk for depression (Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression [CES-D] Scale),14 with a higher total
score (range 0-60) reﬂecting a greater risk for depression;
social-emotional-behavioral difﬁculties (Strength and Difﬁ-
culties Questionnaire [SDQ]),15 with a higher total score
(range 0-40) reﬂecting more difﬁculties; and well-being
Scale
(Warwick-Edinburgh
[WEMWBS]),16,17 with a higher total score (range 14-70)
reﬂecting greater well-being. Other student-level character-
istics included baseline age (analyzed at both the student
and the school level), gender (male, female, other/prefer not
to say), and ethnicity (White, Asian, Black, and mixed/other
ethnic minorities [eg, Arab]).

features.3,10 Hence, school-level characteristics are aggre-
gates across students within a school, providing comple-
mentary information about the impact of a student’s school
environment on their mental health beyond their individual
characteristics. Data were obtained by linking publicly
available government data to the school’s postal code, unless
otherwise speciﬁed. We selected measures that were directly
comparable across all 4 nations within the United Kingdom
(England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales). Other-
wise, we mapped existing measures onto their English
equivalent (eg, school quality ratings). The broader school
context summarizes wider socioeconomic factors in the
school’s catchment area,
including urbanicity (urban vs
rural school location) and area-level deprivation (Index of
Multiple Deprivation, decile rating range 1 [most deprived]
to 10 [least deprived]). School community factors refer to

characteristics of the student population,
including the
percentage of students who were eligible for free school
meals (school-level economic deprivation), the percentage of
students receiving support for special educational needs or
disabilities, and students who were White British (all range
0%-100%), as well as the average age of students in a
school. Operational
included the total
number of students within a school, student-to-teacher ra-
tio, and school sex (mixed or female-only schools). The
most recent ofﬁcial school inspection rating before trial arm
allocation was used to obtain an ordinal rating of school
quality. As the approach to the measurement of school
quality differed in public (independent schools) and private
schools and across the nations, we mapped all school in-
spection rating systems onto the following 3 categories:
requires improvements, good, and outstanding. Quality of

learning (SEL) provision was assessed
social-emotional
through a semistructured interview with the senior leader-
ship team or a staff member with overall responsibility for
teaching SEL using a list of 16 quality indicators speciﬁcally
designed for the trial. A higher school rating (range 0-16)
reﬂected better SEL provision.18 School attainment was
obtained from publicly available government data referring
to the average attainment of students within a school.19 The
score is calculated based on the student’s
attainment
achievement across 8 subjects,
including English and
mathematics (double weighted) and 6 further subjects.20
The Alaska School Climate and Connectedness Survey
(SCCS)21 was used to assess teacher-rated (subscales School
Leadership and Involvement, Staff Attitudes, and Respectful
Climate) and student-rated (subscales School Leadership
and Involvement, Respectful Climate, Peer Climate, and
Caring Adults) school climate, with higher total scores
(range 1-5) representing a better school climate. We con-
ducted conﬁrmatory factor analyses using robust maximum
likelihood estimation to conﬁrm that our reduced set of
subscales is a valid measure of the underlying school climate
concept. Here, school climate was deﬁned as teachers’ and
students’ experiences in a school,
including feeling safe,
connected, and welcomed. It includes connections, part-
nerships, and conditions for learning (see Supplement 2,
available online, for each subscale, the psychometric prop-
erties, and relations to students’ mental health over time).22
For analysis, overall scores were calculated by taking the
mean across teachers (or students for the school-level mea-
sure) within a school to obtain a composite school-level
measure of teacher-rated (or student-rated) school climate.
Student-rated school climate refers to the student’s views of
the school climate analyzed both at the student and at the
level. Student-level effects capture each student’s
school
unique perception of the school climate and school-level
effects capture the average perception of
the school
climate among students within a school.

Given the short study period, all student- and school-
factors were measured at baseline (T0) only and
level
assumed to be stable except for student- and teacher-rated
school climate, which was considered to be more subjec-
tive and changeable and hence was assessed repeatedly.
While teacher ratings were available for all time points (T0-
T3), student-rated school climate was available only at
subsequent assessments (T1-T3) to minimize participant
burden at baseline. Additional information on the study
measures has been reported elsewhere.10

Statistical Approach
All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.223
(Table S2, available online; for further information, see

Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
Volume 63 / Number 2 / February 2024

PREDICTORS OF MENTAL HEALTH IN ADOLESCENCE

Supplement 3, available online). We conducted complete
case analyses and explored differences between students
retained and lost to follow-up. We plotted individual and
mean growth curves of adolescents’ mental health over time
by gender and prior mental health status (baseline T0 levels)
using established cutoff scores.

We estimated intracluster (intraschool) correlation co-
efﬁcients by ﬁtting 2-level random intercept multilevel
linear regressions for each outcome and time point using
maximum likelihood estimation (level 1: student level; level
level). The intracluster correlation coefﬁcient
2: school
shows the extent to which differences in adolescents’ mental
health can be explained by differences between schools.24
We calculated the 95% CI for the intracluster correlation
coefﬁcient based on 100 bootstrap samples.

We analyzed cross-sectional (for school climate factors,
assessed repeatedly) and longitudinal (for student- and
school-level factors, assessed only at baseline) relationships
between student- and school-level factors and mental health
outcomes and tested whether there is evidence that those
relationships change over time (categorical: 0 [reference], 1
year, 1.5 years, and 2 years). For this, we ﬁtted 3-level
random intercept multilevel
regressions using
maximum likelihood estimation (level 1: repeated mea-
surements over time; level 2: student; and level 3: school).
All continuous level-2 factors were centered at the school
level. All analyses were also stratiﬁed by gender.

linear

These analyses were undertaken as follows. First, we
examined one factor at a time to explore the effect of each
factor on adolescents’ mental health over time. Models
with the time by factor interaction term were compared
with models with only the respective main effects of time
and the factor. If the inclusion of this interaction term
provided a better model ﬁt (likelihood ratio test: p < .05),
then this was used as evidence that the association between
the factor and the outcome changes over time. Thus,
regression coefﬁcients for the time by factor interaction
term reﬂect changes in the relationship relative to the ﬁrst
assessment. In the absence of statistically signiﬁcant in-
teractions with time (likelihood ratio test: p > .05), we
assumed stability in the relationship, and regression co-
efﬁcients reﬂect the average relationship across time.

Second, we included statistically signiﬁcant main or
time by factor interaction terms in a series of multivariable
models to explore the independent effect of each factor on
adolescents’ mental health over time after controlling for
all other factors. We adjusted for cohort, trial arm (allo-
cation), and multiple comparisons (Benjamini-Hochberg
correction) and estimated 2 models covering 2 years
(model 1: T0-T3) or 1 year (model 2: T1-T3), respec-
tively: model 1 comprised student-level demographics þ

school context þ community þ operational features except
for student-rated school climate, and model 2 comprised
all factors in model 1 þ student-rated school climate. The
absence of baseline student-rated school climate data
meant that the ﬁrst wave (T0) was dropped when student-
rated school climate was added as a factor to the multi-
variable model. Hence, model 2 was considered only to
student-rated school
examine the adjusted effects of
climate on the outcomes.

RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Of the initial sample (N ¼ 8,376 trial participants, K ¼ 84
schools), 7,263 students (86.7%) and all 84 schools were
retained until the ﬁnal time point, and 7,250 students
(86.6%) provided data on at least one outcome (Table 1;
Table S3, available online). A higher proportion of female
students had outcome data at 2-year follow-up compared
with male students (55.4% vs 51.1%, p ¼ .012). Students
with outcome data at 2-year follow-up also reported slightly
lower levels of risk of depression (mean [SD] ¼ 13.1 [9.7]
vs 15.5 [10.7], p < .001) and social-emotional-behavioral
difﬁculties (mean [SD] ¼ 11.5 [6.4] vs 13.5 [6.6], p <
.001) and higher well-being (mean [SD] ¼ 49.9 [9.6] vs
48.2 [10.2], p < .001) at baseline. No other notable dif-
ferences between students with and without 2-year follow-
up data were observed (Table S3, available online). Across
time, the percentages of missing data for our outcomes
(<2%), time-constant factors (<13.5%) and time-varying
factors (teacher-rated school climate: 0%-0.2%; student-
rated school climate: 0%-3.4%) were low (Table 1).

Table 1 shows student and school characteristics across
time. Students’ mental health at baseline was within normal
ranges, ie, low risk of depressive symptoms (CES-D: mean
[SD] ¼ 13.5 [9.9]) and social-emotional-behavioral difﬁ-
culties (SDQ: mean [SD] ¼ 11.8 [6.5]) and average mental
well-being (WEMWBS: mean [SD] ¼ 49.7 [9.7]). At
subsequent assessments, mental health worsened, such that
students’ rounded mean scores fell within the at-risk range
of risk for depression (T1-T3).14 This increase was more
pronounced in girls than boys (Figure 2). Additional ana-
lyses showed that differences in adolescents’ mental health
narrowed over time. That is, adolescents with worse baseline
mental health typically improved, while adolescents with
better baseline mental health tended to decline (Figure S2,
available online).

Across all time points, differences between schools
accounted for a small yet statistically signiﬁcant propor-

difﬁculties (1.9%-2.8%), and well-being (1.8%-2.2%),
which was evident for both genders, particularly girls
(Table 2).

Factors Associated With Changes in Adolescents’
Mental Health
Table 3 shows student- and school-level factors that were
associated with changes in adolescents’ mental health over
time in fully adjusted, multivariable models (for girls see
Table S4, available online; for boys see Table S5, available
online). Similar results were obtained for model 1 (T0-T3:
2-year period without student-rated school climate) and
model 2 (T1-T3: 1-year period with student-rated school
climate), unless noted explicitly.

For demographic factors, female students had a higher
risk of depression score (regression coefﬁcient B ¼ 2.20,
95% CI [1.64, 2.76], p < .001) and lower well-being
(B ¼ (cid:1)1.75, 95% CI [(cid:1)2.22, (cid:1)1.28], p < .001) at
baseline. Signiﬁcant changes in coefﬁcients show that this
association strengthened for all outcomes at subsequent
assessments. Furthermore, students’ ethnicity (White) was
social-emotional-behavioral difﬁ-
associated with higher
culties at baseline (B ¼ 0.80, 95% CI [0.45, 1.15], p <
.001), which was a stable association across time, present for
girls but not boys. Older age was associated with a higher
risk of depression (B ¼ 0.53, 95% CI [0.16, 0.90], p ¼
.005) and social-emotional-behavioral difﬁculties
(B ¼
0.41, 95% CI [0.14, 0.67], p ¼ .002) and lower well-being
(B ¼ (cid:1)0.87, 95% CI [(cid:1)1.25, (cid:1)0.50], p < .001) at
baseline, which was a stable association over a 2-year period
for depression and weakened over time for social-emotional-
behavioral difﬁculties and well-being, particularly for girls.
Age was not associated with adolescents’ mental health
when considering a 1-year period (model 2).

For school context, students in schools in rural (vs ur-
ban) areas had a lower social-emotional-behavioral difﬁ-
culties score (B ¼ (cid:1)0.95, 95% CI [(cid:1)1.66, (cid:1)0.23], p ¼
.009) and higher well-being (B ¼ 1.09, 95% CI [0.28,
1.89], p ¼ .008) at baseline. This association was stable
across time and present in boys, but not girls. Area-level
deprivation was not signiﬁcantly associated with adoles-
cents’ mental health.

For school community, a higher percentage of White
(vs other) students within a school was associated with lower
well-being (B ¼ (cid:1)0.03, 95% CI [(cid:1)0.04, (cid:1)0.01], p <
.001) at baseline. This association was stable across time and
present in the whole sample. The mean age of students
within a school, the percentage of students eligible for free
school meals, and the percentage of students receiving
support for special educational needs or disabilities were not
signiﬁcantly associated with adolescents’ mental health at

aAt baseline, most students were aged 11 (41.9%) or 12 years (49.3%).
bTwo cutoff points have previously been proposed to identify students at risk of depression ((cid:3)16) and with symptoms likely to meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder ((cid:3)28).
These 2 validated criteria were used to categorize participants into 3 subgroups for descriptive purposes (low: 0-15; at risk: 16-27; probable caseness: 28-60).
cThe validated 4-band categorization was used for descriptive purposes: (normal: 0-14; borderline: 15-17; high: 18-19; very high: 20-24).
dThe WEMWBS has been validated in UK population-based samples and benchmarked against validated measures of depression, suggesting cutoff values, which were used for descriptive
purposes (probable mental health difﬁculties: 0-40; possible mental health difﬁculties: 41-44; average mental well-being: 45-59; high well-being: 60-70).

Note: The baseline assessment (T0) is used as the reference time point except for student-rated school climate, where data were collected only at T1, T2, and T3. Hence, model 2 includes
only data collected at T1, T2, and T3, and T1 was used as the reference time point in model 2. Students are nested within schools. NA indicates that associations were not tested because they
were nonsigniﬁcant in univariable analyses. Given the small numbers observed in our sample and to facilitate data analyses, we coded ethnicity as White and other ethnic groups (including
Arab, Asian, Black/African/Caribbean, mixed ethnic groups, other ethnic groups). Boldface type indicates signiﬁcant values. CES-D ¼ Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale;
RI ¼ requires improvement; SDQ ¼ Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire; T0 ¼ baseline (0 years), T1 ¼ preintervention (1 year), T2 ¼ postintervention (1.5 years), T3 ¼ follow-up (2 years);

difﬁculties

For school operational features, student-rated school
climate, analyzed as a time-varying factor at both the stu-

(T1-T3). These associations were present in girls and boys.
Furthermore, better teacher-rated school climate, measured

which was a stable relation over a 1-year period (T1-T3).
However, no effects for teacher-rated school climate were
revealed when considering a 2-year period (model 1).
Additional small associations were found in crude (unad-
justed) models, but were not signiﬁcant at the 5% level in
fully adjusted models (Tables S6-S8).

DISCUSSION
We explored students’ mental health and well-being during
early adolescence and their relationship to individual and
school characteristics (context, community, and operational
features). Our study suggests 3 key messages: there are
signiﬁcant levels of mental health problems among adoles-
cents, which worsen from ages 11 to 16, particularly in girls;
for a small but statistically signiﬁcant
schools account
amount of the variation in students’ mental health and well-
being; and school climate (particularly as perceived and
reported by the students) is the single most important factor
associated with these outcomes.

as

children move

We observed that

into mid-
adolescence as many as one-third report notable mental
health problems. The ﬁnding that differences in adolescents’
mental health narrowed over time could be explained by
youth who started with worse mental health experiencing
improvement, while youth who started with better mental
health experienced decline. This could be due to similar but
delayed mental health trajectories in the latter or the effect
of different vulnerability factors (eg, age or gender), but may
equally relate to regression to the mean. Among older girls,

the mean score on our measure of risk for depression was
above the clinical cutoff point. Moreover, older age, espe-
cially among adolescent girls, was signiﬁcantly associated
with worse mental health over time. The rising incidence of
mental health problems in the second decade of life, and
that the deterioration is particularly marked in girls, is well
established.25 However, recent evidence suggests that the
mental health of young people, especially emotional difﬁ-
culties in adolescent girls and young women, has deterio-
rated, which might be due to earlier pubertal timing,
maladaptive coping styles (rumination), or a heightened
sensitivity to family and peer relationship problems in girls
than in boys.26 While these ﬁndings are signiﬁcant on the
population level (see Table S1, available online),
is
important to note that not all adolescents experience mental
health symptoms of clinical severity, which underscores the
need to consider factors that might protect against the
development of mental health difﬁculties
in some
adolescents.

it

Consistent with a previous scoping review and con-
ceptual model,3 we found that schools accounted for a small
but statistically signiﬁcant proportion of the variation in
adolescents’ mental health. Other factors (eg, schools in
urban areas and White ethnicity at the student and school
level) were associated with worse mental health in early
adolescence but are nonmodiﬁable. Yet, as regression co-
efﬁcients were smaller and conﬁdence limits were closer to
zero, these factors might be less important in adolescents’
mental health compared with school climate estimates.

As other key modiﬁable factors are outside the school
setting (eg, home connectedness9), the role of schools in
mental health promotion is important but only part of a
wider strategy that should involve all agencies working with
children, parents/carers, and families. The green paper
“Transforming Children and Young People’s Mental
Health Provision”27 encourages schools and colleges to
promote mental health by identifying a senior mental health
lead and building links with mental health support teams.
Early evaluation suggests that schools welcome such addi-
tional expertise and capacity to support the mental health of
students.28 The ﬁnding that differences between
their
schools are small suggests that existing school-based ap-
proaches target students’ mental health to a similar extent.
While similar ﬁndings were reported in cross-sectional
studies,6,10

approach to studying a broad range of school-level charac-
teristics and suggests that students in early adolescence with
positive views on the school climate had fewer mental health
problems and better well-being over 1 year
(T1-T3).
However, these associations are likely complex and bidi-
rectional (eg, worse mental health being associated with the

to reduce students’

Our ﬁndings suggest that schools could enhance the
mental health of young people through creating a school
climate that students view as positive, including positive
peer relationships, caring and respectful adults, and effective
school leadership and involvement. This suggestion aligns
with the key aims of the Safe and Supportive Schools
Project in the United States, which aims to promote school

risk of
(mental) health and behavioral problems.9 School climate
has consistently been associated with a range of important
outcomes, including better attendance, less substance use,
and better academic performance.8 A recent review suggests
that establishing peer networks that foster belonging and
prosocial behavior could contribute positively to both
school climate and student mental health and well-being.29
Study strengths include a large, representative sample of
UK secondary schools and students, with low percentages of
missing data (<2% for our outcomes). The focus on vali-
dated measures, appropriate rigorous analyses (multilevel
models of repeated measures), and separate mental health
outcomes
relationships are
additional strengths of this study.

to reveal potential distinct

The study also has limitations. First, although partici-
pating schools were broadly representative of schools in the
United Kingdom, the exclusion of schools with inadequate
or no SEL strategy limited school variability. Future
research should explore how different levels of SEL provi-
sion and school quality may inﬂuence students’ mental
health by oversampling from uncommon school types,
including poorly functioning schools. Second, the time
window for student- and school-level characteristics to
impact students’ mental health over time was narrow,
particularly for student ratings of the school climate, which
were available only from T1 and hence covered a period of
only 1 year. Longer time windows might be needed for
school-level effects to emerge. Relations might also change
across time and be different for different age groups, which
is a question that awaits future research. Nevertheless, the
strong prospective associations of student ratings of the
school climate with students’ mental health over time sug-
gest that these exploratory ﬁndings might persist if longer
time periods are considered. Only a subset of teachers and
students within each school (ie, participants in the trial)
completed school climate ratings,11 and there was consid-
erable drop out, particularly of teachers providing school
time. Hence, ﬁndings might not

nontrial participants, such as students in other year groups
not selected for trial participation. Nevertheless, all the

280

reported effects were also identiﬁed at the student level,
which increases our conﬁdence in the ﬁnding that school
climate, particularly as perceived by students, is associated
with students’ mental health over time. Third, the rela-
tionship between school characteristics and students’ mental
health is likely complex and bidirectional, meaning that
temporal precedence in identiﬁed associations needs to be
explored further. Fourth, the usual caveats apply regarding
the generalizability of the ﬁndings to students who did not
participate in this study and to schools outside the United
Kingdom. However, the fact that students were represen-
tative of the wider population and that similar proportions
of outcome variation at the school level have been reported
in other countries30 increases conﬁdence in our ﬁndings and
their generalizability. Fifth, students retained in this study
were more likely to be female and to report lower levels of
risk of depression and social-emotional-behavioral difﬁ-
culties and higher well-being at baseline, which means that
caution is warranted when ﬁndings are translated to boys or
students identifying as other gender identities and for stu-
dents with worse mental health at baseline. Nevertheless,
ﬁnding signiﬁcant adverse effects for girls suggests that we
can be more conﬁdent in these ﬁndings, as girls were more
likely to be retained in this study. Furthermore, ﬁnding
signiﬁcant effects in students with better mental health at
baseline underscores the potential protective role of school
climate in students’ mental health over
time. Sixth,
although the overall trial revealed no differences between
school-based mindfulness training and teaching as usual in
adolescents’ mental health over time, there remains the
potential of unmeasured group differences. Yet, by con-
trolling for trial arm status in the statistical analyses, we
minimized this risk, leading to increased conﬁdence in the
generalizability of our ﬁndings. Finally, there are many
variables that impact schools and mental health of young
people that were outside the scope of our study, such as
nonconforming gender identity,9 family-level factors (eg,
home connectedness, parental mental health and educa-
tion),5,9 other school-level factors (eg, percentage of sus-
pensions or bullying/violence),30 and the complex interplay
of broader inﬂuences of inequalities such as poverty or
ethnicity.4 Future research may explore the relationship
between distinct subdimensions of school climate and stu-
dents’ mental health to obtain a better understanding of the
dimensions that are most important, which was beyond the
scope of this study.

In summary, our ﬁndings are consistent with recent evi-
dence26 and suggest worrying levels of poor mental health
among UK adolescents, especially girls. Schools account for a
small but statistically signiﬁcant proportion of the variation in
mental health of adolescents over time. Using multilevel,

theory-driven student- and school-level
(including school context, community, and operational fea-
tures) and separate mental health outcomes over time in a
representative sample of UK adolescents, entering a higher-risk
period of mental health problems. We found a stable role for
school climate in students’ mental health in early adolescence
in repeated cross-sectional analyses over 1 year. This ﬁnding
suggests that school climate may play an important role in
students’ mental health beyond the inﬂuence of other school
contextual, community, or operational factors, highlighted in
comprehensive frameworks of school-based mental health,10
which has important implications for policy and system in-
terventions that focus on enhancing school climate.
