Abstract

Background

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is prevalent among children and adolescents. Cognitive-
behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used as the first-line treatment. However, evaluation of
CBT conducted in a school setting has been scarce.

Objectives

This study aims to review the CBT and its effectiveness in the school setting for children and
adolescents with SAD or social anxiety symptoms. Quality assessment on individual studies
was conducted.

Methods

Studies were identified through the search in PsycINFO, ERIC, PubMed and Medline target-
ing CBT conducted in a school setting with an aim to treat children and adolescents with
SAD or social anxiety symptoms. Randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental stud-
ies were selected.

Results

A total of 7 studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies were randomised controlled trials,
and two were quasi-experimental studies with 2558 participants aged 6–16 years from 138
primary schools and 20 secondary schools. There were minor effects to reduce social anxi-
ety symptoms for children and adolescents at post-intervention in 86% of the selected stud-
ies. Friend for Life (FRIENDS), Super Skills for Life (SSL) and Skills for Academic and

Social Success (SASS) conducted in school were more effective than the control
conditions.

Conclusions

There is a lack of quality of the evidence for FRIENDS, SSL and SASS, due to inconsisten-
cies on the outcome assessments, statistical analyses, and the fidelity measures adopted in
individual studies. Insufficient school funding and workforce with relevant health back-
ground, and the low level of parental involvement in the intervention would be the major
challenges in school-based CBT for children and adolescents with SAD or social anxiety
symptoms.

Introduction

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent and continual psychiatric disorder in children and
adolescents, who are socially avoidant with cognitive belief of being checked, embarrassed,
ashamed, rejected, and judged by unfamiliar people in social situations or school settings [1].
Individuals with SAD have anxiety symptoms that persist for at least several months and their
functioning, including the delivery of speech or ideas, is significantly impaired [1]. SAD also
affects children’s and adolescents’ functioning at school, including an increase of occurrence
of crying, freezing and tempering, avoiding classroom activities and peer gathering, seeking
reassurance from teacher and parents, and a decline of school performance [2]. A recent study
reported that the global prevalence of SAD is 36% [3], with the lifetime prevalence of SAD is
up to 10% in children and adolescents [4–6].

Individuals in eastern countries were found to have a lower risk of SAD than in western

countries [7], which have a prevalence rate ranged from 2.3 to 11.6% [8–15], whilst it was
lower than 1% in some eastern countries [16].

The body of evidence shows that the impairment of social communication and education
participation for children and adolescents could lead to higher risk of other psychiatric disor-
ders [17–19], including depression [6,12,20,21], substance use disorder [6,12,22,23], and other
types of anxiety disorder [6,11–13,24].

Despite the evidence, children and adolescents with SAD have been under-recognised,
which might hinder the treatment process [25]. Currently, few systematic reviews focus on
school-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for children and adolescents with SAD. A
meta-analysis of 17 studies addressed the efficacy of CBT and other behavioural therapies in
treating SAD and enhancing children and adolescents’ quality of life and functioning [26].
However, this meta-analysis was limited by sample size and age range heterogeneity. In addi-
tion, this meta-analysis did not separate school-based from community-based programmes. It
is important to distinguish between school-based and community-based programmes in the
evaluation, as the circumstances of children and adolescents in schools are different from the
community settings, leading to different outcomes in the same intervention [27]. Similarly,
two reviews showed a small positive effect of the school-based intervention programmes on
depression and anxiety [27,28]. These reviews, however, also showed high heterogeneity in
study design and methodology, and they relied on self-report outcome measures on anxiety
disorder without the clinician’s rating, leading to questionable validity and reliability of the
findings. In addition, these reviews focus on a wide range of psychotherapies. As CBT has
been shown to be a more effective intervention when comparing with other psychotherapies
[25], it is believed that more focus should be placed on CBT.

PLOS ONESchool-based CBT for children and adolescents with SAD and social anxiety symptoms

Understanding the type of school-based CBT, its purpose and nature, and its length and
effectiveness is important for policymakers to address children and adolescents with SAD in
the school setting. It is also essential to examine the role of parents in CBT conducted in a
school setting. Children could gain benefits in the parent-child interaction by reducing paren-
tal rejection, increasing psychological control of the mother, and reducing social anxiety [29–
31]. Moreover, the fidelity measures such as the supervision of CBT, are elements which deter-
mine the consistency and quality of the intervention. This systematic review, therefore, aims to
review the evidence concerning school-based CBT for children and adolescents with SAD or
social anxiety symptoms.

Methods
Search strategies and inclusion criteria

This systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines [32]. Peer-reviewed articles written in English with full-
text published from 1964 to 2021 were searched through the following databases: ERIC, Psy-
cINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed. The following search terms were used: “social anxiety disor-
der” or “social phobia”, AND “cognitive behavioural therapy” or “CBT” or “cognitive
behavioural therap�” or “cognitive behaviour therap�” AND “school” or “school-based” or
“school-based prevention” or “school-based intervention”. Reference lists of relevant studies
were reviewed. We selected studies which examined school-based intervention endorsed by
school and delivered in school premises during or outside school hours. The selected studies
must implement CBT which involves psycho-education, graded exposure, coping strategies or
problem solving [25]. Studies which examined children and adolescents aged up to 19 years
with SAD or social anxiety symptoms were included. Table 1 shows a summary of inclusion
and exclusion criteria based on the PICO elements: Patient, Intervention, Comparision and
Outcome.

Data extraction and quality assessment of individual studies

Two independent reviewers (first and last author) reviewed the articles according to the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria, and extracted main characteristics of the studies, including the
publication year, age of participants, types of intervention and its details, and outcome mea-
sures. In case there was disagreement on the selection, a third reviewer would be involved in
the discussion.

The selected studies were critiqued by the first and last author using a modified methodo-

logical quality checklist adapted from the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies
[33,34], which is suitable for both RCT and non-RCT studies. Each article was rated according
to the overall methodological quality, including the description of the characteristics of partici-
pants and schools, the study design, the blinding methods for the data collection, and the out-
come measures. A third reviewer would be involved if there was disagreement in the quality
assessment.

Results
Overview of the selected studies

The search provided a total of 251 articles. After removing duplicates and non-English articles,
217 remained, of which 185 did not meet the inclusion criteria and the full text is not available
for 3 articles.

Twenty-nine articles remained after the initial screening. After review, 22 were excluded, in

which 5 articles were not conducted in the school setting; 13 articles did not include evidence
about the change of social anxiety symptoms or SAD in the results; 2 articles were not peer-
reviewed, and 2 articles were not quantitative study. A total of seven studies, including five ran-
domised controlled trials (RCTs) and two (non-RCTs) quasi-experiments, were selected in
this review (Fig 1).

Quality assessment

Table 2 shows the quality assessment of each selected study. We found that the majority of
studies did not have their intervention providers, outcome assessors, data collectors and par-
ticipants blinded, whilst most studies provided clear description of the characteristics of partic-
ipants and school setting. Only one study had an overall rating over 50%, indicating a low
quality among most of the selected studies.

Sampling and risk of bias

The sample of two studies [35,39] adopted a cluster randomised controlled trial design. These
studies involved participants with similar experiences within the same group or school. Three
studies [36,37,40] did not disclose the details of randomisation. Warner et al [36] involved a
sample with nomination by teachers; de la Torre-Luque et al [37] involved a sample with a
middle social-economic background. Essau et al [38] recruited vulnerable children and adoles-
cents with psychological problems voluntarily from schools. Similarly, Matsumoto and Shi-
mizu [41] recruited voluntary participants from three schools. The findings of these studies
might be subjected to selection bias. Two studies [38,41] adopted quasi-experimental designs
without any control conditions, and a non-random method was applied to assign participants
to the intervention groups. Moreover, most studies reported significant findings which may be
subjected to publication bias.

The characteristics of the selected studies

The study characteristics of the school-based CBT for children and adolescents were reviewed
and appraised in the following areas: 1) type of intervention and target participants, 2) parental
involvement, 3) implementation process and fidelity measures, 4) assessment of the primary
outcomes for SAD, 5) assessment of the primary outcomes for social anxiety symptoms and 6)
effects of the intervention. Appraising the above areas aimed to distinguish if there was any fre-
quent pattern in the school setting, to understand the roles of parental involvement in the CBT

programmes and whether the CBT programmes were implemented consistently and assessed
by valid and reliable assessment tools. It is important to investigate whether these factors
would affect the outcomes of the CBT [42], with an aim to assist the mental health profession-
als, the CBT service providers, and the researchers to develop an individualised treatment plan
in a school setting. The appraise and review of the the study characteristics are presented

1) Type of intervention and target participants. Three types of school-based CBT were
identified among five countries (UK, USA, Spain, Germany, Japan) for children and adoles-
cents, including Friend for Life (FRIENDS), Super Skills for Life (SSL), and Skills for Academic
and Social Success (SASS). There was a scarcity of school-based intervention for children aged
below six years. The included studies examined the effectiveness of different school-based CBT
for children aged 6–16 years. In addition, more research was conducted in the primary school
setting. School-based CBT, including FRIENDS and SSL, was found to be effective in primary
and secondary schools. SASS was used targeting at adolescents in secondary school but not in
primary school. No comparison between countries could be made for SASS as it was only
implemented in the USA. Moreover, the study conducted by Warner et al [36] was the only
study that implemented the SASS programme involving individual sessions, social events, and
peer assistants on top of other treatment components of booster sessions, teachers meetings,
and parents sessions.

2) Parental involvement. Low participation of parents was observed in two studies. Essau

et al [40] showed that only 17.1% (around 59 parents) completed all parents sessions. Warner
et al [36] reported a 59% attendance rate (around 21 parents) for two-parent sessions. How-
ever, no statistical evaluation was used to examine the association between parental attendance
and the treatment effect. Besides, no information on how parents were involved could be
found in the selected studies. In the future school-based CBT programme, it is essential to
assess the level of parental involvement with assessment tools, such as the Parental Involve-
ment in Therapy Scale (PITS), so that the association between parental involvement and the
effectiveness of school-based intervention could be further investigated.

3) Implementation process and fidelity measures. There were inconsistencies in the
implementation process and fidelity measure, limiting the generalizability of the results in dif-
ferent school settings. Table 3 shows the details of the implementation process and fidelity
measures of the selected studies. Four studies had fidelity measures, consisting of training
workshops, leader manuals, checklist of CBT content records, and attendance register. Only
two studies provided supervision on the school-based CBT, with unknown qualifications of
supervisors. Three studies did not report any implementation process.

4) Assessment of the primary outcomes for SAD. SAD was examined in only one study

[36] through a set of clinical assessments, including the administration of the Social Phobia

Diagnosis and Severity and Clinical Global Impression Scale by trained independent evalua-
tors who were blinded to treatment at pre-intervention, at 12-week post-intervention and at
6-month follow up. The Social Phobia Diagnosis and Severity is a valid and reliable assessment
for paediatric anxiety for the age of 6–17 years [43,44].

Warner et al [36] reported a significant improvement in SAD. A total of 58.8% of partici-
pants in the SASS intervention group no longer met the criteria for SAD at post-intervention
and at 6-month follow-up, with the treatment effect 58.8% and 66.6% higher than the control
group, respectively. There was a significant reduction of social phobia severity among partici-
pants in the SASS intervention group at post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up. How-
ever, there was no assessment longer than 6 months after the intervention.

5) Assessment of the primary outcomes for social anxiety symptoms. Social anxiety

symptoms were examined in all seven studies. A summary of screening tools used in the
selected studies is presented in Table 4. The majority of the studies screened the change of
social anxiety symptoms with only one screening tool, including the Spence Children’s Anxiety
Scale (SCAS) and its parents version (SCAS-P) in three studies, the Revised Child Anxiety and
Depression Scale (RCADS) in two studies, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional
Disorders (SCARED) in one study. Only one study [36] used a set of screening tools across
multiple reporters, including parents, teachers, and patients. These screening tools include
Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C), Social Anxiety Scale for Adoles-
cent (SAS-A), Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents: Parent Version (SAS-AP), and the SCAS.

Concerning the psychometric properties of the screening tools used, one study used
SPAI-C and SAS-A, which were known to be reliable measures of social anxiety of children
and adolescents [50,51,55].

The remaining six studies used other assessment tools primarily for anxiety with a subscale

of social phobia. The SCAS and SCAS-P demonstrated good reliability and validity [48,49],
and they are available in several languages, including Japanese, German, and Spanish. Two

studies conducted in Spain and the UK used RCADS, which showed good reliability and valid-
ity [47–49].

6) Effects of intervention. Effects of the school-based CBT for children and adolescents
with social anxiety symptoms are presented in Table 5. Seven studies presented intervention
effects with different statistical parameters that influence data synthesis for effect size. Five
studies reported a decrease in social anxiety symptoms at post-intervention and at 3–12 month
follow-up. Only one study [36] presented small to large effect size in various outcome mea-
sures at post-intervention.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to review the literature regarding the characteristics and the effec-
tiveness of the school-based CBT to treat children and adolescents with SAD or social anxiety
symptoms. This review identified 7 studies that primarily targeted the population with social
anxiety symptoms or SAD, compared with the previous reviews that focus on general anxiety
symptoms or anxiety disorder. In addition, some similar reviews focused on a wide range of
psychotherapies. As CBT is the first line treatment and it is more effective than other psycho-
therapy [25], it is believed that more efforts are needed to examine this type of intervention.
Moreover, it is important to separate community-delivered programmes from school-based
programmes as the circumstances of children and adolescents in schools are different from the
community settings. This systematic review, therefore, focused on school-based CBT.

The results of this review were in line with previous research, which found that CBT pro-

grammes have small effects on SAD [27,56,57]. We found that three types of school-based
intervention (FRIENDS, SSL and SASS) improved social anxiety symptoms for children and
adolescents. However, no study primarily targets at children below six years old. This could be
explained by the rare prevalence of SAD in this age group, and the early onset of social anxiety
often starts in adolescence.

Limitations of the school-based CBT

Four studies using FRIENDS, SASS and SSL found effective intervention lasted up to 6-month
follow up, and two studies (FRIENDS) at 12-month follow up [35,40]. However, these studies

did not present the effect size. Moreover, most studies were assessed and analysed by the
authors, except one study with an independent outcome evaluator [36].

There was high heterogeneity regarding the study design and fidelity measures, which may
lead to substantial bias and low external validity [58,59]. The incomplete and inconsistent fol-
low-up assessment also makes it difficult to compare between studies. Moreover, the session
length in the school-based CBT varies across studies, ranging from 40 to 60 minutes. The CBT
was also conducted with different purposes (treatment: five studies, prevention: two studies),
duration (ranging from 8 to 12 sessions), follow up period (0 to 12 months), number of paren-
tal sessions (0–4 sessions), number of booster sessions (0 to 2 sessions), levels of parental
involvement and fidelity measures.

Method of randomisation and sampling

There was insufficient information regarding the randomisation method in some studies. The
non-representative samples of the selected studies could result in low generalizability of the
findings. In addition, no study was implemented in the rural communities, which were found
to have a high prevalence rate of anxiety disorder among adolescents [60]. Besides, only one
study was conducted in eastern country.

PLOS ONESchool-based CBT for children and adolescents with SAD and social anxiety symptoms

Level of blinding

Only in one study the intervention provider was blinded, whilst one study had data collectors
blinded, and one study had the outcome assessor-blinded. Lack of blinding might result in
bias as social anxiety symptoms could be subjective.

Sample size and dropouts

Participants with different socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, cultures, and races were
involved in the selected studies. The sample size ranged from 36 to 1343 participants from 138
primary schools and 20 secondary schools. The dropout of participants at the follow-up period
was substantial in three studies, including a reduction of 90 participants (7%) [35], 61 partici-
pants (40%) [41], and 10 participants (27%) [36]. The dropout could influence the validity of
the results.

Conclusions

In summary, CBT programmes have small effects on SAD. School-based intervention
(FRIENDS, SSL and SASS) improved social anxiety symptoms for children and adolescents.
Limitations of the school-based CBT studies pertain to the non-representative samples, a lack
of blinding and high dropout rate.

Implications for practice and future research

School teachers and mental health professionals could use observation measures (behavioural
coding system) or performance-based methods (social competence tasks) [61] to examine the
social behaviour and identify social anxiety symptoms in the classroom. It is also suggested
that the outcome assessment should be conducted at the 12-month follow-up to identify long-
term effectiveness. CBT conducted in school should include fidelity measures and provide
high-quality CBT supervision. A standard training protocol of school-based CBT for teachers,
counselors, and mental health professionals should be developed.

Future research should consider a larger sample size with a robust sampling method, reli-
able and valid outcome assessment, and a blinding method when assessing the outcomes. Self-
reported outcomes should be supplemented by at least one or more objective outcome assess-
ments. A structural clinical interview can be conducted to understand children and adoles-
cents’ coexisting conditions (depression, substance use, and general anxiety symptoms) in
school. Several challenges can be foreseen in conducting CBT in schools, including a lack of
school funding for mental health interventions, an insufficient workforce with relevant qualifi-
cations [61], heterogeneity in school culture, unrecognised social anxiety symptoms of chil-
dren and adolescents, and low level of parental involvement in the intervention [62].
