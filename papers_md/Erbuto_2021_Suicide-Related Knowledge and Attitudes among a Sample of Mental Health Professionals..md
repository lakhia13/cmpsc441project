Abstract: Inadequate knowledge of the potential signs and risk factors of suicide negatively affects
the ability of healthcare professionals to recognize patients at risk of suicide. The principal aim
of the present study is to assess the attitudes and knowledge about suicide in a large sample of
mental health professionals. We examined the relationship between Suicide Knowledge and Skills
Questionnaire items and the experience of a patient dying by suicide. We also examined whether
various healthcare professionals respond differently to the items of the Impact of a Patient’s Suicide
on Professional and Personal Lives Scale. Results demonstrated that healthcare professionals who
had experienced a patient suicide reported greater skills than professionals who had not experienced
a patient suicide. However, 44% of professionals who had experienced a patient suicide felt that they
did not have adequate training on this particular issue. Among those who had experienced a patient
suicide, there was an increased tendency to hospitalize patients with suicide risk and an increased use
of collegial consultation. Concerning personal emotions, healthcare professionals reported troubled
relationships with family members and friends and the loss of self-esteem. In conclusion, better
knowledge and attitudes about suicide are necessary for suicide-prevention strategies.

1. Introduction

The knowledge of how to identify and manage suicidal patients is important in suicide
prevention. Training a range of professionals, not exclusively healthcare professionals,
is an essential strategy in suicide prevention [1,2], and evidence suggests that training
is necessary to increase knowledge about suicide in healthcare professionals [3–6]. Sev-
eral studies have highlighted the fact that only half of the mental health trainees had
received very limited training on suicide during their education [7]. Workshops proved
to be effective for improving knowledge and shifting attitudes [8], although appropriate
training, without supervised practice, does not necessarily imply that professionals obtain
essential skills to deal with suicidal patients [9]. Moreover, patients at risk of suicide often
visit primary care services rather than mental health professionals, thereby conferring an
important role for primary care physicians for suicide assessment and prevention [10]. It
has been reported that contact with primary healthcare services was highest in the year
before suicide, with an average contact rate of 80%, while at one month the average rate
was 44% [11]. Inadequate knowledge of the potential signs and risk factors of suicide

negatively affects the ability of healthcare professionals to recognize patients at risk of
suicide [12,13]. Improved knowledge and attitudes about suicide may allow healthcare
professionals to better identify patients at risk, increasing suicide-prevention efforts. We
deﬁne attitudes as a set of emotions, beliefs, and behaviors toward a particular object,
person, thing, or event [14,15].

A patient’s suicide is not a rare event for healthcare professionals. At least half of
all psychiatrists may have a patient who dies by suicide, and most professionals with
previous experience can expect another suicide [16]. A patient’s suicide usually has a
signiﬁcant impact on healthcare professionals, affecting them on both a professional and
a personal level [17]. The suicide of a patient can increase awareness of the various
factors involved in suicide risk, creating anxiety, guilt, and high levels of stress [16].
Moreover, healthcare professionals often display negative attitudes toward patients with
suicidal behaviors [18]. On the other hand, a patient’s suicide can offer an opportunity
for professional growth, providing insight on personal competencies and encouraging
consultations [19]. Regardless, healthcare professionals could beneﬁt from improved
knowledge about suicide, and training in suicide prevention may be necessary.

Based on the hypothesis that the attitudes of healthcare professionals toward people
who died by suicide and their knowledge about suicide risk inﬂuence suicide-prevention
strategies [20,21], the principal aim of the present study is to assess knowledge and attitudes
about suicide in a large sample of mental health professionals. For this purpose, we
examined the relation between Suicide Knowledge and Skills Questionnaire items [22]
and the experience of a patient’s suicide. In addition, we also examined whether various
healthcare professionals (i.e., physicians, psychologists, nurses) respond differently to the
items of the Impact of a Patient’s Suicide on Professional and Personal Lives Scale.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

A total of 670 healthcare professionals (physicians, psychologists, nurses, and educa-
tors) and medical and psychology students participated in the study (Table 1). Out of the
670 participants, 511 were female and the average was 44.89 years (SD = 13.81). Subjects
were recruited during the 16th International Symposium on Suicidology and Public Health,
which occurred in Rome in 2018. Approximately 26.7% of participants were physicians,
32.8% were psychologists, 14.2% were nurses, 15.7% were students, 4.3% were educators,
and 5% were other mental health professionals (Table 1). Participants were invited to
complete the questionnaire based on their skills and knowledge about suicide and the
impact of a patient suicide on their lives. Approximately 250 healthcare professionals did
not participate in the study Participation was voluntary and anonymous, and researchers
and those associated with the project did not know the participants’ identities. Therefore,
the information collected did not contain any identiﬁable information, and there was no
risk of attributing data to particular individuals. All participants received a comprehensive
explanation of the study procedures and goals, consistent with Helsinki’s Declaration. The
project was submitted to the university department (Department of Neurosciences, Mental
Health and Sensory Organs), which provided approval.

2.2. Measures

We administered a socio-anamnestic questionnaire to all participants that included
data on age, gender, and profession. The questionnaire also included a section reserved for
professionals who had experienced a patient suicide.

The Suicide Knowledge and Skills Questionnaire (SKSQ) [22] is a 13-item questionnaire
to assess knowledge about suicidal behaviors and perceived competence in managing
suicidal patients. The questionnaire includes two scales: the suicide knowledge subscale
with nine true or false sentences and the suicide skills subscale that estimates how conﬁdent
healthcare professionals are in their training, skills, and supervision when managing
suicidal patients. Responses are on a 5-point Likert scale that ranges from completely
agree to disagree completely. Previous studies [22,23] only reported statistics on internal
consistency and did not evaluate further the psychometric properties of the SKSQ. Both
Smith et al. [22] and Silva et al. [23] reported low internal consistency for the suicide
knowledge subscale (Cronbach’s alpha between 0.40 and 0.50), and acceptable internal
consistency for the suicide skills conﬁdence subscale (Cronbach’s alpha between 0.81 and
0.84); the low internal consistency of the suicide knowledge subscale was associated with
the miscellaneous nature of the items [22,23]. Supporting the validity of the SKSQ as a
measure of suicide-related knowledge and perceived skills, results from Smith et al. [22]
suggest that scores on both subscales are able to discriminate between health professionals
with speciﬁc training in suicide prevention and those who do not have any training. In
the present sample, Cronbach’s alphas were 0.44 for the suicide knowledge subscale and
0.84 for the suicide skills conﬁdence subscale. However, we did not treat the SKSQ as a

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8296

psychometric scale (e.g., we did not calculate and interpret total scores as an index of a
latent construct), and we analyzed only single items.

A self-report scale to assess the impact of a patient’s suicide on healthcare professionals’
professional and personal lives [24] was administered only to professionals who had
experienced a patient suicide. This scale included 18 items that focused on personal life
(e.g., personal feelings and difﬁculties with family members and friends) and professional
life (e.g., changes in clinical practice and relationships with colleagues and supervisors).
Responses were on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 = minimum impact and 7 = maximum
impact. The authors [24,25] did not develop the items as part of a psychometric scale but
used them only as part of a survey and did not perform any analysis to study the validity
or reliability of the questionnaire. In the present sample, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.89. In line
with the original studies [24,25], we did not use total scores and analyzed only responses
to single items.

To analyze the results, we converted the 5-point Likert scale responses to the suicide
skills subscale and the 7-point Likert scale responses to the Impact of a Patient’s Suicide on
Professional and Personal Lives Scale to a 3-point response range. In the ﬁrst questionnaire,
we merged the responses “strongly disagree” and “disagree” and the responses “agree”
and “strongly agree”, while in the second questionnaire we considered responses from 1 to
3 as “disagree”, responses from 5 to 7 as “agree”, and response 4 as “neither”. Since the
distribution of the scores was non-normal, non-parametric statistics were used.

3. Results

Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. On average, participants had performed
their job for 19.78 (±11.50) years. Over a third of the participants (37.31%) had experienced
the suicide of a patient during their career.

Examining the relationship between items of the suicide skills subscale and experience
of patient suicide, those who had never experienced a patient suicide were less conﬁdent
about their training and skills for handling suicidal patients (see Table 2). They were less
likely to agree with the statements: “I have received the training I need to engage and assist
those with suicidal desire”, “I have the skills I need to engage those with suicidal desire
and/or intent”, and “I am comfortable asking direct and open questions about suicide”.
However, a large percentage of those who had experienced a patient’s suicide felt that
they did not have enough training or skills: 44.3% did not believe they had received the
necessary training to engage and assist those with suicidal desire, 25.1% were not conﬁdent
about their skills to engage patients with suicidal ideation, and 18.9% were not comfort-
able asking about suicide (Table 2). To study whether participants’ years of professional
experience could affect the relationship between the experience of patients’ suicide and
the participants’ suicide skills, we performed a loglinear analysis with the experience of a
patients’ suicide as a dependent variable and variables signiﬁcant at the bivariate analyses
(i.e., training, skills, and comfort) and years of experience as independent variables. The
model ﬁtted the data adequately (Likelihood Ratio χ2 = 0.93, p = 0.63). The experience
of a patient’s suicide was signiﬁcantly associated with comfort in asking about suicide
(Odds Ratio = 2.19, p = 0.001).
In contrast, having enough training (Odds Ratio = 1.26,
p = 0.49) or skills (Odds Ratio = 1.38, p = 0.31), and years of experience (Odds Ratio = 1.02,
p = 0.73) were not signiﬁcantly associated with the experience of a patients’ suicide. What
is noteworthy here is, regardless of the experience of a patient suicide, a large proportion
of the participants did not feel that they had the training or skills to help suicidal patients,
and 60% of the total sample did not feel that they had the support and supervision that
they needed to engage with and assist those with suicidal desires.

There were no signiﬁcant associations between knowledge about suicide and the

experience of a patient suicide (see Table 3).

Regarding the impact of a patient’s suicide, there were signiﬁcant differences by pro-
fession for 7 of the 18 items (see Table 4). Regarding the impact of a patient’s suicide, 28.8%
of physicians, 37.7% of psychologists, and 41.4% of nurses reported an increased tendency
to hospitalize patients. Approximately 35.8% of physicians, 49.2% of psychologists, and
71.9% of nurses used collegial consultations or peer consultations. Approximately 7.1%
of physicians, 6.9% of psychologists, and 25.0% of nurses experienced problems in rela-
tionships with friends, while 4.0% of physicians, 14.0% of psychologists, and 28.1% of
nurses experienced problems with family. Loss of self-esteem was reported by 13.7% of
physicians, 13.3% of psychologists, and 28.1% of nurses. Finally, 8.2% of physicians, 8.6%
of psychologists, and 25.0% of nurses experienced emotional numbness (Table 4).

4. Discussion

The principal aim of the present study was to assess self-reported attitudes and knowl-
edge about suicide in a large sample of mental health professionals. For this purpose, we
examined the relationship between the Suicide Knowledge and Skills Questionnaire items
and the experience of a patient’s suicide. In addition, we also examined the association
between items of the Impact of a Patient’s Suicide on Professional and Personal Lives Scale
and different healthcare professions.

We found a signiﬁcant relationship between the experience of a patient’s suicide and
items on the SKSQ. A large proportion of the participants did not feel that they had the
training or skills to help suicidal patients, and 60% of the total sample did not feel that
they had the support and supervision needed to engage with and assist those with suicidal
desires. However, the results indicated that healthcare professionals who had experienced a
patient suicide reported greater skills than professionals who had not experienced a patient
suicide. Feeling comfortable asking about suicide was still signiﬁcant in multivariate
analysis while controlling for years of professional experience. These ﬁndings can be
explained by the fact that healthcare professionals usually receive more training in suicide
prevention after a patient suicide. Several psychiatric services offer psychological support
after a patient’s suicide, and healthcare professionals who had experienced a patient’s
suicide learned from that experience how to better manage suicide risk [26,27]. Healthcare
professionals who had experienced a patient’s suicide reported administering improved
suicide risk assessments, felt better able to ask patients questions about suicidal ideation,
and were more aware of suicide risk factors [28].

Previous studies have shown that healthcare professionals who worked with suicidal
patients had reported a better knowledge of suicide and were more likely to receive suicide-
related training [29,30]. Thus, experiencing a patient suicide may prompt healthcare
professionals to seek further training, and this training may increase the willingness of
healthcare professionals to treat patients at risk of suicide [23].

However, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference for the item “I have the sup-
port/supervision I need to engage and assist those with suicidal desire” between pro-
fessionals who had experienced a patient suicide and those who had not. Both groups felt
that they did not have the necessary support to manage suicidal patients. In particular,

44% of professionals who experienced a patient suicide felt that they did not have the
proper training on this particular issue. Our results support previous papers that have
demonstrated that only a small percentage of healthcare professionals consider them-
selves sufﬁciently trained to work with patients at risk of suicide [31,32]. In a study by
Samuelsson et al. [33] on 191 psychiatric nurses, only 25% considered themselves sufﬁ-
ciently trained for this work. In another study with a sample of 300 psychiatric staff, only
44.3% considered themselves sufﬁciently trained [31].

Finally, we examined the association between the Impact of a Patient’s Suicide on
Professional and Personal Lives Scale and the different healthcare professions. The results
showed a signiﬁcant relationship between the profession and “increased tendency to
hospitalize,” “increased use of collegial consultation”, “increased use of peer consultation”,
“disturbed relationships with friends”, “loss of self-esteem”, “disturbed relationships with
family”, “emotional numbness”, with nurses reporting the more negative impact than did
psychiatrists and psychologists. Compared to other professional ﬁgures, the more negative
impact reported by nurses might be explained by their broad education background, not
necessarily involving mental health issues and perspectives. Overall, our results show that
improved knowledge and improved attitudes toward suicide are important factors for
suicide-prevention strategies.

A study conducted by Takahashi et al. [34], in fact, has analyzed the exposure to
patients’ suicide and the consequences on nurses in terms of stress. The results have shown
that the absence of formal systems to deal with the psychological aftermaths of such an
event causes signiﬁcant distress and a higher burden on nurses.

Moreover, after a patient suicide, there was an increased tendency to hospitalize
patients with suicide risk and an increased use of collegial consultation. Concerning
personal emotions, healthcare professionals reported troubled relationships with family and
friends and a loss of self-esteem, conﬁrming the personal and professional consequences of
a patient’s suicide on healthcare professionals [35].

This study had several limitations. First, the healthcare professionals involved in the
study belonged to different professional groups. Some groups interviewed had a small
sample size. Second, the participants attended a symposium on suicide and may not
represent all healthcare professionals. Finally, the perception of being sufﬁciently trained is
not an objective measure since individuals may misjudge their competence.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, this study investigated an issue of public health interest: the prepara-
tion of healthcare professionals for assessing and treating suicidal patients. Our results
highlight the emotional and professional impact that a patient suicide can have on health-
care professionals. Our results demonstrated that a large proportion of the participants
did not feel that they had the training or skills to help suicidal patients. Overall, our
results show that increased knowledge and improved attitudes about suicide are important
factors for suicide-prevention strategies. As suggested in previous studies, developing
suicide-prevention campaigns and training seems essential for increasing the knowledge of
healthcare professionals about suicide and people at risk of suicide, their family members,
and people bereaved by suicide [36,37]. Furthermore, offering programs and training on
suicide are important for other professionals, including school personnel, researchers, and
policymakers, to improve prevention strategies to reduce suicide risk [1].
