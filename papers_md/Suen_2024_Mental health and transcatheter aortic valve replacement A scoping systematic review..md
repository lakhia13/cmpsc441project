Abstract

Objective:  We systematically review the literature on mental health symptoms before and after 
transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) and describe reported clinical associations with 
these symptoms.

Methods:  Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 
extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, we reviewed studies involving pre- 
or post-TAVR mental health assessments or psychiatric diagnoses.

Results:  Eighteen studies were included. Before TAVR, clinically significant depression 
and anxiety prevalence is 15–30% and 25–30%, respectively, with only a third of these 
meeting diagnostic thresholds. These symptoms generally improve over the year post-TAVR. 
Depression is associated with functional impairment, multimorbidity, and lower physical activity; 
few associations have been described in relation to anxiety. Inconsistent evidence finds 
depression associated with post-TAVR mortality. One notable study found persistent depression 
independently predictive of 12-month mortality, and another found depression and cognition to 
have additive value in predicting mortality risk.

Conclusions:  Mental health symptoms occur in a significant proportion of the TAVR 
population. Although symptoms tend to improve, the associations with depression, particularly 
persistent depression, call for further investigation to examine their associated outcomes. Research 
is also needed to understand the relationships between mental health conditions and cognition in 
TAVR-related outcomes.

Introduction

Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is an established treatment for aortic valve 
disease alongside surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). TAVR use has been slowly 
expanding to lower risk groups, with the growing number of studies demonstrating the 
safety and durability of TAVR bioprostheses in low-risk groups [1]. The volume of TAVRs 
performed has increased every year from 2011 to 2019 and exceeded the volume of SAVR in 
2019 (72,991 vs. 57,626) [2]. In view of the increasing volume of TAVRs being performed 
internationally and the expanding availability of this procedure, it is important to understand 
patient experiences and outcomes.

Quality of life (QOL) has long been studied in relation to TAVR. In fact, the Valve 
Academic Research Consortium recommends patient-reported measures assess disease-
specific health status and QOL as an endpoint and that this be recorded in TAVR registries 
[3]. A 2017 review of the Society of Thoracic Surgeon and the American College of 
Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy (STS/ACC TVT) registry (n = 7014) found TAVR 
was associated with improved QOL. Overall, 62% had a favorable LOS outcome at one 
year as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, yet roughly a third of 
patients had a poor outcome [4].

Cognitive outcomes after TAVR have also received considerable attention. Interestingly, 
a 2020 meta-analysis of 15 studies found a similar prevalence of incident cognitive 
impairment and incident cognitive improvement after 6 months (12% vs 11%). This review 
also found that baseline cognitive impairment was an important predictor of post-TAVR 
improvement in cognition [5], which is interesting given that baseline cognitive impairment 
is consistently associated with post-TAVR delirium [6]. The literature on post-TAVR 
delirium is even more robust than the literature on general cognitive outcomes. A 2023 
systematic review included 69 studies and found a pooled delirium rate of 9.8% after TAVR, 
but when restricting the analysis to studies that used validated delirium assessment tools 
daily for at least 2 days after TAVR, they found a 20.7% incidence [6].

Less appreciated than QOL and cognition, though, are the mental health correlates of 
TAVR, including the prevalence of depression and anxiety before TAVR, after TAVR, and 
the post-TAVR outcomes associated with baseline depression and anxiety. Drawing on 
the cardiovascular disease literature by analogy, the strong association between depression 
and poor cardiovascular disease outcomes has prompted recommendations for universal 
depression screening in that population [7]. Similarly, studies have found that depression 
is associated with lower QOL both before and after TAVR [8], and depression, especially 
persistent depression, has been found to be associated with greater risk of 1-year mortality 
after TAVR [9].

Depression, along with other mental health symptoms, could deserve similar attention in 
patients undergoing TAVR as they do in patients with other cardiovascular disease, yet 
we are not aware of any prior systematic reviews in relation to TAVR. In this scoping 
systematic review, we aim to characterize mental health symptoms—specifically depression

and anxiety—before and after TAVR and to describe the reported clinical associations with 
these psychological symptoms.

2.  Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review per the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to 
identify studies of patients undergoing TAVR in which the results of pre- or post-TAVR 
mental health assessments or psychiatric diagnoses were reported (PRISMA-ScR Checklist 
in Supplementary Table 1). This review was registered with PROSPERO prior to formal 
screening of search results ([CRD42022378589]).

Studies were identified through a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, 
Cochrane, and Web of Science in November 2022. We did not restrict the search by date, 
but relevant results could not have been published before 2002, when the first TAVR was 
performed. The search was conducted by a research librarian using database specific queries 
using the following search term list: transcatheter aortic valve replacement, mental disease, 
behavior therapy, personality, sleep, cognitive behavioral therapy, anxiety, mood, personality, 
postoperative depression, and delirium (search strategy in Supplementary Table 2).

All references were imported into Endnote and de-duplicated, yielding 961 unique articles 
for review (Figure 1). Initially, titles and abstracts were reviewed to exclude irrelevant 
articles, leaving 72 potentially relevant reports, all of which were retrieved for full-text 
review. Each full-text article was evaluated by two reviewers (divided among WS, SB, and 
VB) for inclusion using the following criteria: 1) original full-length manuscript in a peer-
reviewed journal; 2) the study reported TAVR-specific variables; and 3) pre- or post-TAVR 
mental health measures reported include depression or anxiety. We excluded articles that 
reported either QOL, cognition, sleep, or personality without also reporting on depression or 
anxiety. Disagreement on study inclusion was discussed jointly and resolved by the senior 
author. Data in the tables were entered by one reviewer and confirmed by the senior author. 
We provide a narrative review of the literature based on the nature of the included studies.

3.  Results

We have divided the 18 included studies into those that report mental health measures only 
before TAVR (Table 1), only after TAVR (Table 2), or before and after TAVR (Table 3). 
Only the TAVR cohorts from included studies are featured in the tables (funding sources 
of included studies in Supplementary Table 3). The review is divided into three sections: 
the first section (3.1) describes the epidemiology and natural history of depression and 
anxiety associated with TAVR; the second (3.2) describes depression as a predictor of TAVR 
outcomes; the third (3.3) describes predictors of depression and anxiety outcomes.

3.1  Epidemiology and Natural History

3.1.1  Depression and anxiety before TAVR—The pre-TAVR prevalence of 
instrument-defined “significant depression” ranges from 15 to 30% [9-17]. The studies that 
reported lower-end values used the mini-Geriatric Depression Scale (mini-GDS, 15.3% [10])

and the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2, 15.5% [11] and 19.6% [17]). The 
studies that found a prevalence close to 30% used either the original 30-item GDS (32% 
[15]) or the short-form GDS (33.8% [9]). One study used the Beck Depression Inventory II 
(BDI-II) to identify patients with “clinical depression” and reported a 24.6% prevalence 
before TAVR [13]. Three articles (two from the same study) reported prevalence of 
depression symptoms on the depression subscale (i.e., score ≥ 8) of the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS). In the two reports based on the same study sample, depression 
prevalence was 23.6% and 25.4% [12, 14]; the third article was an outlier, reporting a 46% 
prevalence [16].

Only one study conducted a structured assessment for psychiatric diagnoses, the Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [13], and found a 7.5% prevalence of major 
depression. This value is similar to the reported prevalence of depression by chart diagnosis 
(8.6% [9] and 5.7% [12]) and of patients on antidepressant medication (8.6% [10] or 5% 
[12]).

Fewer included studies reported the pre-TAVR prevalence of anxiety. Three articles (two 
from the same study sample) reported the prevalence of a positive anxiety subscale (i.e., ≥ 
8) on the HADS. In the two reports by Bäz et al., baseline anxiety prevalence was reported 
as 28.6% [12] and 26.8% [14]. The study by Sun et al. is again an outlier in reporting a 
much higher prevalence of pre-TAVR anxiety of 41% [16]. Regarding symptoms meeting 
diagnostic criteria, one study found an 11.0% prevalence of anxiety disorders using the 
MINI [13], although the specific anxiety disorders are not reported.

3.1.2  Natural history of depression and anxiety symptoms after TAVR—
Included studies generally found overall improvement in depression after TAVR. Two 
studies found low overall depressive symptoms at baseline, and these modest symptoms 
subsequently decreased over the months after TAVR. The first, using the BDI-II, found 
that scores decreased by about 33% over the first post-TAVR month [13], and the second, 
using the PHQ-9, found a “normal” average score at baseline, with the average PHQ-9 
score decreasing over the following 12 months [18]. In a study that used the HADS 
depression subscale, average depression scores were unchanged over the 12 months after 
TAVR [14]. However, in a separate publication on the same study cohort, patients with 
baseline depression (i.e., ≥ 8 on HADS depression subscale), were statistically improved 
at post-TAVR week 6, an improvement that persisted at 1 year [12]. Moreover, comorbid 
anxiety in this depressed-at-baseline subgroup also improved significantly from baseline. 
The study by Sun et al. was again an outlier, reporting an increasing proportion of patients 
scoring 8 or higher on the HADS depression subscale after TAVR (46%, baseline; 76%, 
1 month; 80%, 4 months; 66%, 8 months) [16]. One study reported an isolated 12.9% 
prevalence of depression based on the HADS depression subscale at an average of 15 
months after TAVR, though the time range of assessment was broad [19].

The natural history of anxiety after TAVR is not as clear, but some degree of improvement 
post-TAVR appears likely. One study found a 10% decrease in State Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(STAI-Y1) scores after 1 month, though baseline symptoms were minimal even before 
TAVR [13]. Whereas the study cohort reported in two separate reports by Bäz et al. did not

have an overall change in anxiety up to 12 months based on the HADS anxiety subscale 
[14], patients with baseline anxiety (i.e., subscale ≥ 8) were significantly improved by 6 
weeks post-TAVR [12]. The study by Sun et al. was yet again an outlier, reporting an 
increase in anxiety over 8 months (41%, baseline; 73%, 1 month; 77%, 4 months; 73%, 8 
months) [16]. A final study reported an isolated 12.9% anxiety prevalence an average of 15 
months after TAVR [19].

Using a claims database, one study, which excluded patients with a record of either 
depression or anxiety in the 6 months before TAVR, found a 19% 1-year cumulative 
incidence of new anxiety or depression after TAVR [20].

3.1.3  Depression and anxiety in relation to cardiac rehabilitation—Five studies 
reported mental health in relation to cardiac rehabilitation [21-25]. Of these, two studied the 
change in mental health symptoms pre–post rehabilitation. One of these found a significant 
improvement in depression, assessed by the PHQ-9, which decreased from a mean of 4.3 
on admission to a mean of 2.3 at discharge (p < 0.01), as well as an increase in the 
mean positive affect, assessed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [21]. In this 
same study, negative affect remained low, and anxiety symptoms, assessed by the 7-item 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), did not change from their relatively low 
pre-rehabilitation mean of 3.4. The other study that reported pre–post rehabilitation change 
in mental health symptoms found only a trend of decreasing depression and anxiety scores 
on the HADS, yet anxiety symptoms were low upon entering rehabilitation, with a mean of 
4.4 on the HADS-A [22].

The other three studies reported longitudinal course of mental health symptoms after 
discharge from cardiac rehabilitation. The first of these found that moderate to severe 
depression on the GDS remained relatively stable from discharge (moderate 18%; severe 
13%) to 18–24 months (21%; 17%, respectively) after cardiac rehabilitation [23]. The 
second study reported minimal depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline, 3 months, 
and 6 months after cardiac rehabilitation, with median scores of HADS depression and 
anxiety subscales of 2 and 3, respectively [24]. The third also reported low levels of 
depression and anxiety in both the rehabilitation and home groups at all time points [25]: 
in the rehabilitation cohort, the HADS depression subscale decreased from a median of 2 
pre-TAVR to 1 at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after rehab, with the comparison home 
cohort reporting nearly identical scores. HADS anxiety subscale scores were also similar 
between rehabilitation and home cohorts, decreasing from a median of 6–7 pre-TAVR to a 2 
at the same time points up to 12 months.

3.1.4  Cross-sectional associations with depression and anxiety—Four studies 
reported clinical associations with depression. Baseline depression was associated with a 5% 
or more greater likelihood of several clinical conditions (Supplementary Figure 1) as well as 
lower ejection fraction (mean 52% vs 57%) [9, 12]. Conversely, depression was associated 
with a lower rate of peripheral arterial disease (3% vs 14%) [12]. A separate study found 
that a post-TAVR depression, defined by ICD-10 diagnosis, was associated with female sex 
(55.3% vs 41.5%, p < 0.001) and younger age (76.8 vs 78.3, p < 0.001) [26], and a final

study found depression to be associated with reduced habitual physical activity both before 
and after TAVR [15].

A study by Bäz et al. was the only one to evaluate cross-sectional clinical associations with 
baseline anxiety [12]. Baseline anxiety was associated with more than 5% greater likelihood 
of angina (34% vs 29%), COPD (38% vs 25%), and a NYHA class > II (74% vs 65%).

3.2  Depression as a predictor of TAVR outcomes

The most studied outcome associated with baseline depression is mortality (Supplementary 
Table 4). Although studies have reported inconsistent results, three of the four largest studies 
found a significant association between depression and mortality. In the prospective study by 
Drudi et al. (n = 657), pre-TAVR depression (short-form GDS ≥ 2) was associated with an 
increased risk of 1-month mortality (OR 2.1) and a trend of 12-month mortality (OR 1.3) 
[9]. Persistent depression (i.e., depression at baseline and at 6 months) predicted 12-month 
mortality in multivariable models (OR 2.8). The second positive study used a large clinical 
database and found that an ICD-10 depression diagnosis was associated with greater risk of 
mortality over 5 years post-TAVR versus those without diagnosis [26]. This study also used 
propensity-score matching, accounting for demographics and comorbidities associated with 
risk of depression and mortality (n = 2049 in each arm) and found a significantly higher 
mortality rate in depression: 21.4% vs 16.8% (p = 0.002). The third positive study, using 
a TAVR registry of 884 patients, reported mortality over a median follow-up of 2.9 years 
[17]. Adjusted models found depression (PHQ-2) and cognitive dysfunction (Mini-Cog) 
independently predictive of mortality (HR 1.5 and 1.3, respectively) and the co-presence 
of depression and cognitive dysfunction associated with an even greater mortality risk (HR 
2.1). The remaining three studies did not find an association between depression and either 
6-month (n = 150) [10] or 12-month (n = 144 [12] or 755 [15]) mortality.

Studies have also investigated depression as a predictor of functional outcomes. Whereas 
patients without baseline depression experienced improved physical and mental QOL 
through 6 months post-TAVR, baseline depression was, at the very least, not associated 
with worsening of mental QOL 6 months after TAVR [10]. The study by Sathananthan 
et al. found no association between baseline depression and change in physical activity 
from baseline to 12 months. In a single study, anxiety was not found to be associated with 
12-month mortality (n = 144) [12].

3.3  Predictors of depression and anxiety outcomes

Habitual physical activity predicted mental health outcomes: higher baseline activity (i.e., 
greater than median activity level) was associated with lower prevalence of depression 12 
months later per the short-form GDS (21% vs 32%, p < 0.002) [15]. Conversely, individuals 
with activity level below the median were more likely to have depression both at baseline 
and at the 12-month assessment (20% vs 7%, p < 0.001). Moreover, patients with low 
activity levels were less likely to remain depression-free at both assessments (48% vs 64%, p 
< 0.001), strongly implying the importance of physical activity in mental health outcomes.

In the only intervention trial included, which aimed to improve mood after TAVR, Edwards 
et al. found that patients randomized to brief in-hospital cognitive behavioral therapy or

to the control arm experienced equivalent improvement in depression and anxiety from 
baseline to 1 month [13]. This is likely due to the low prevalence of diagnosis-level 
depression and anxiety at baseline (7.5% and 11.0%, respectively, per MINI).

4.  Discussion

The pre-TAVR prevalence of depressive symptoms based on depression rating scales is 
reported to be 15–30%, but this rate is roughly three times higher than the prevalence of 
major depression based on chart diagnosis, antidepressant medication use, or structured 
interview. The prevalence of clinically significant anxiety symptoms is 25–30%, which is 
similarly three times higher than anxiety diagnoses as reported per structured interview [13].

Symptoms of depression and anxiety generally improve over the month following TAVR, 
including among patients with elevated baseline symptoms [12] (excepting an outlying study 
[16]). A similar tendency for improvement over time has also been reported after acute 
coronary syndrome, a condition coined as “cardiac blues” [27]. The transient nature of the 
early symptoms could be explained by the acuity of the distressing event itself, which abates 
the further one is temporally removed from it.

This early symptom improvement after TAVR generally persists through the first year. 
In fact, the spontaneous improvement of pre-TAVR symptoms is of such a magnitude 
that the one trial of brief in-hospital cognitive behavioral therapy failed to demonstrate 
efficacy, as nearly equivalent improvement occurred in both the study and control arms 
[13]. Future studies aiming to improve mental health recovery after TAVR should consider 
restricting recruitment to patients who have elevated baseline psychiatric symptoms. 
Similarly, one cannot exclude that the improvements in mental health symptoms among 
patients completing cardiac rehabilitation were largely spontaneous as well. New-onset 
anxiety or depression has also been reported to occur in about a fifth of patients after TAVR 
[20].

Most concerning of the identified associations is between depression and mortality: 
depression that persisted for 6 months was associated with the strongest association with 
increased risk of mortality in adjusted models [9]. The distinction between transient and 
persistent depression is clinically relevant and deserves investigation for its clinical import 
in future studies. There also appears to be an additive effect of comorbid depression 
and cognitive dysfunction [17]. As one would expect based on findings from many 
other settings, depression in TAVR cohorts is associated with a variety of functional 
limitations (frailty, reduced activity level, impaired activities of daily living), chronic 
medical conditions (heart failure, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD), female 
sex, and younger age. The associations between depression and both female sex and younger 
age is consistent with research in cardiovascular disease cohorts [28], and these groups of 
patients with aortic valve disease deserve heightened vigilance for depression.

Although not a focus of this review, the role of sleep in TAVR populations has received 
limited investigation [29, 30] and represents an opportunity for future studies, both to 
characterize the burden of sleep disturbances as well as its impact on clinical outcomes

including delirium and other mental health conditions. Sleep in the postoperative setting 
after TAVR is understandably poor, though it appears to be less disrupted than after 
SAVR [30]. Studies have also found a very high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing 
in advanced aortic stenosis, ranging from 71% to 94% [31-34]. The impact of sleep 
disturbance in older adults is broad, increasing the risk of hypertension, cardiovascular 
disease, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and mortality [35, 36].

One finding of particular interest was the association between lower level of physical 
activity and depression [15]. Whereas the causal relationship between these two cannot 
be deduced from this observational study alone, one suspects a bidirectional relationship 
in which reduced physical activity and depression reinforce one another. This could also 
suggest a potential opportunity for addressing depression by way of interventions that 
increase overall physical activity. In the general population, exercise has not only physical 
benefits but also appears to have meaningful antidepressant efficacy for major depression 
[37], and a recent systematic review of 20 trials concluded that cardiac rehabilitation reduces 
both anxiety and depression symptoms in patients after myocardial infarction [38].

Although we are unaware of a similar review on the mental health considerations of 
SAVR cohorts or non-AVR cohorts of advanced AS patients, several studies of TAVR 
patients have included SAVR patients as well. Some of these report AVR groups separately, 
thereby allowing them to be included in this review [9, 19-22, 30], whereas others report 
aggregate results of mixed AVR cohorts [39, 40]. In general, such studies suggest that 
TAVR and SAVR cohorts have similar depression and anxiety prevalence [9, 19, 39, 40], 
although one study showed that the relative risk of depression and anxiety is lower with 
TAVR compared to SAVR particularly in the first 3 and 6 months after the operation [20]. 
When interpreting such distinctions, one should consider that the SAVR population in the 
community is roughly a decade younger than the TAVR population, with mean ages around 
70 and 80, respectively, as reported in several studies included in this review [20-22]. 
The advanced age of TAVR cohorts also bears consideration as late-life depression, and 
depression in cardiovascular cohorts in particular [41], may have unique risk factors and 
clinical correlates. Another relevant comparison is that cardiac rehabilitation is associated 
with similar improvement of depression and anxiety in both TAVR and SAVR cohorts [21, 
22].

How closely depression in TAVR cohorts resembles depression in other cardiovascular 
populations remains unclear. For instance, the prevalence of diagnosable depression in 
coronary heart disease is 15–30% [42] and in patients with heart failure is roughly 30% [43]. 
These rates are not only higher than those found in this review of TAVR patients but also 
appear to be more persistent over time. One suspects that the systematic differences across 
cardiovascular populations are likely to influence mental health symptoms, as well as their 
associations with other risk factors and outcomes.

Whereas mental health symptoms have been evaluated in many studies, there are several 
gaps in the literature. First, mental health symptoms have not been studied for their potential 
associations with a range of TAVR-related outcomes of functional and medical morbidity, 
as they have been in other cardiac cohorts such as those undergoing coronary artery bypass

graft surgery. As such, whereas depression has been associated in cross-sectional analyses 
with functional limitations and medical conditions and, inconsistently, in longitudinal 
analyses with mortality, the current TAVR literature does not allow us to determine whether 
depression has a similar clinical importance in TAVR populations as it has in cardiovascular 
disease cohorts. The finding that persistent depression predicts higher mortality risk 
deserves replication and further investigation. Second, the relationships between depression 
and cognitive impairment, including delirium, deserve focused investigation, including 
for potential interactions in relation to TAVR outcomes. Third, psychiatric diagnoses in 
TAVR cohorts should be characterized using structured interviews. Finally, race/ethnicity of 
study samples was seldom reported across included studies; future research should report 
race/ethnicity consistently and consider the role of race/ethnicity on study objectives and 
outcomes.

We acknowledge the following limitations to this review. TAVR technology and indications 
have evolved significantly over the past decade, so these changes could affect individual 
study cohorts in a way that we are unable to ascertain. Next, clinical judgment played 
a role in each study regarding whether each patient pursued TAVR or SAVR, and we 
cannot account for the potential bias that this introduced in individual studies. However, 
in general, older, frailer patients are more likely to pursue TAVR than SAVR, thereby 
inadvertently enriching the morbidity of TAVR study samples. With one exception [13], 
the included studies are all observational, so causality cannot be inferred. Also, included 
studies are of diverse types, and we are not aware of a quality assessment instrument that 
offers an equitable or interpretable assessment across study types. Thus, we have elected 
not to assess the quality of included studies in a formal manner. Finally, although we used 
MeSH headings to maximize inclusivity, our search may have failed to include all eligible 
studies; also, we have focused our search on the more common mental health conditions 
of depression and anxiety and, accordingly, this review does not cover other psychiatric 
conditions such as psychosis or posttraumatic stress disorder.

Among patients undergoing TAVR, baseline depressive and anxiety symptoms are present in 
15–30% and 25–30% of patients, respectively, but symptoms meeting diagnostic thresholds 
appear to be roughly a third of these values. Baseline depressive and anxiety symptoms 
tend to improve over time. Inconsistent data suggests that depression is associated with 
mortality in TAVR cohorts, but persistent depression and the combination of depression and 
cognitive impairment have been associated with higher risk of mortality. Ultimately, the 
impact of mental health symptoms on important TAVR-related outcomes deserves further 
investigation.
