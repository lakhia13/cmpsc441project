Abstract

Objective: Maternal mental disorders have been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes such as low birthweight 
and preterm birth, although these links have been examined rarely among Australian Aboriginal populations. We aimed 
to evaluate the association between maternal mental disorders and adverse perinatal outcomes among Aboriginal births.

Methods: We used whole population-based linked data to conduct a retrospective cohort study (N = 38,592) using 
all  Western  Australia  singleton  Aboriginal  births  (1990–2015).  Maternal  mental  disorders  were  identified  based  on 
the International Classification of Diseases diagnoses and grouped into six broad diagnostic categories. The perinatal 
outcomes evaluated were preterm birth, small for gestational age, perinatal death, major congenital anomalies, foetal 
distress, low birthweight and 5-minute Apgar score. We employed log-binomial/-Poisson models to calculate risk ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals.

Results: After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and pre-existing medical conditions, having a maternal mental 
disorder in the five years before the birth was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, with risk ratios (95% con-
fidence intervals) ranging from 1.26 [1.17, 1.36] for foetal distress to 2.00 [1.87, 2.15] for low birthweight. We found 
similar associations for each maternal mental illness category and neonatal outcomes, with slightly stronger associations 
when  maternal  mental  illnesses  were  reported  within  1 year  rather  than  5 years  before  birth  and  for  substance  use  
disorder.

Conclusions:  This  large  population-based  study  demonstrated  an  increased  risk  of  several  adverse  birth  outcomes 
among Aboriginal women with mental disorders. Holistic perinatal care, treatment and support for women with mental 
disorders may reduce the burden of adverse birth outcomes.

Introduction

Mental health problems, both symptoms and disorders, are 
more  prevalent  in Australian Aboriginal  and Torres  Strait 
Islander (hereafter Aboriginal) than non-Aboriginal popu-
lations, with around a four-fold elevated risk of any mental 
health  problems  and  up  to  10  times  greater  risk  for  sub-
stance  use  disorders  (Nasir  et  al.,  2018;  O’Leary  et  al., 
2013;  Ogilvie  et  al.,  2021).  Moreover,  limited  evidence 
suggests a high prevalence or risk of mental health disor-
ders in Aboriginal mothers (Bowen et al., 2013; Lima et al., 
2019;  Owais  et  al.,  2020).  The  higher  burden  of  mental 
health problems in the Aboriginal population is a legacy of 
the  post-colonial  history  of  Australia  and  the  associated 
ongoing  effects  of  intergenerational  trauma,  interpersonal

and structural racism, socio-economic deprivation and sys-
tematic discrimination, and the greater burden of physical 
health conditions (Ban et al., 2012; Dudgeon and Walker, 
2022; Kelaher et al., 2014; Menzies, 2019; Shepherd et al., 
2017). Maternal mental health problems have been associ-
ated with several adverse perinatal outcomes such as pre-
term birth and low birthweight (Montagnoli et al., 2020), 
which are more common among the Aboriginal than non-
Aboriginal  population  (AIHW,  2021;  Ford  et  al.,  2018; 
Smylie et al., 2010).

Despite  the  higher  burden  of  mental  health  problems 
among  Aboriginal  women  and  their  potentially  serious 
impacts  (Owais  et  al.,  2020;  Pierce  et  al.,  2020),  scarce 
empirical evidence exists about the link between maternal 
mental health problems and perinatal outcomes. A study in 
Western Australia (WA) examined a range of perinatal and 
child outcomes among births to Aboriginal and non-Abo-
riginal  women  with  alcohol  use  disorder  (O’Leary  et  al., 
2020). It highlighted that maternal alcohol use disorder was 
significantly associated with a greater risk of small for ges-
tational age (SGA) and preterm birth (for both populations) 
and congenital anomalies and foetal alcohol syndrome (for 
Aboriginal women only). Although the study provided crit-
ical evidence, it was limited to alcohol use disorder and did 
not evaluate perinatal mortality. Meta-analyses and system-
atic  reviews  in  the  mainstream  population  also  show  that 
women  with  mental  health  problems  are  1.5–1.9  times 
more  likely  to  have  a  preterm  birth,  low  birthweight  and 
perinatal  death  (Adane  et  al.,  2021;  Simonovich  et  al., 
2021; Staneva et al., 2015), although the majority of studies 
have only focused on maternal anxiety and depression. The 
underlying  mechanisms  linking  maternal  mental  health 
problems and perinatal outcomes are not fully understood 
but are likely to be complex, vary by disorder and involve 
altered  intrauterine  (e.g.  elevated  cortisol  levels)  and 
behavioural  (e.g.  a  reduction  in  the  mother’s  ability  or 
attention to gauge what should or should not be done during 
pregnancy)  pathways  (Aktar  et  al.,  2019;  Pearson  et  al., 
2012).

A  better  understanding  of  the  relationship  between 
Aboriginal maternal mental health disorders and perinatal 
outcomes can guide public health policies, prevention strat-
egies  and  clinical  practices  to  target  health  equity 
approaches. Accordingly, this study sought to comprehen-
sively examine the relationship between a range of mental 
health disorders among Aboriginal women before or during 
pregnancy and the perinatal outcomes of their offspring.

Methods
Study design and data source

A  retrospective  population-based  cohort  study  was  con-
ducted using all WA singleton Aboriginal births from 1990 
to 2015. Seven datasets obtained from routinely linked WA 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 57(10)

databases were used, namely the Hospital Morbidity Data 
Collection  (HMDC),  Mental  Health  Information  System 
(MHIS),  Midwives  Notification  System  (MNS),  WA 
Register  of  Developmental  Anomalies, 
the  Derived 
Aboriginal  Status  Flag  and  the  WA  Registry  of  Births, 
Deaths and Marriages. The MNS records the circumstance 
of all WA births (since 1980) of 20 weeks’ or more gestation 
or with a birthweight of ⩾400 g; this was used to establish 
the  study  cohort.  The  HMDC  includes  information  on 
admissions to public and private acute hospitals, public and 
private psychiatric hospitals, and private day surgeries. The 
MHIS collects data from community residential facilities, 
acute general hospitals, psychiatric inpatient units and clin-
ics and psychiatric day centres. We used the WA Registries 
of  Births  and  Deaths  data  to  supplement  the  information 
obtained  from  the  MNS  and  identity  deaths  in  the  first 
month  of  life.  The  WA  Register  of  Developmental 
Anomalies was used to identify births with major congeni-
tal anomalies. The Derived Aboriginal Status Flag is a vari-
able created by the WA Department of Health Data Linkage 
Branch  by  applying  a  validated  algorithm  (Christensen 
et al., 2014) across a wide range of administrative datasets 
to  produce  a  single  indicator  of  Aboriginal  status.  This 
algorithm was developed as part of the ‘Getting Our Story 
Right’ project to improve information about Aboriginal sta-
tus. The WA Department of Health Research Data Services 
team  linked  these  datasets  together  using  probabilistic 
matching  techniques  (Holman  et  al.,  1999)  and  securely 
transferred the data (with identifying fields removed) to the 
research team.

Maternal mental health disorders

Data  on  maternal  mental  health  disorders  were  obtained 
from  the  HMDC  and  the  MHIS.  Maternal  mental  health 
disorders  were  identified  using  ICD-10-AM  diagnosis 
codes  (International  Statistical  Classification  of  Diseases 
and  Related  Health  Problems  Tenth  Edition,  Australian 
Modification)  and  mapping  tables  for  ICD-9-AM.  These 
data were linked to the MNS. Women were considered to 
have a mental health disorder if they had a primary or addi-
tional mental health ICD diagnosis in the HMDC or MHIS 
datasets in 5 years preceding the index birth (the birth event 
included in the analysis). They were classified into broad 
diagnostic  categories  (severe  mental  disorder,  common 
mental disorder, personality disorder, substance use disor-
der  and  all  other  adulthood-  and  childhood-onset  mental 
disorders). Severe mental disorder included schizophrenia 
or  related  disorders,  schizoaffective  disorders,  psychotic 
affective  disorders  (including  bipolar  disorders)  and  psy-
chotic disorders related to substance use. Common mental 
disorder  included  non-psychotic  affective  disorders  and 
neurotic  and  stress-related  (anxiety)  disorders.  A  woman 
could have more than one singleton birth during the study 
period, and these births could vary in the maternal mental

disorder exposure status. Supplementary Table S1 describes 
the mental disorder diagnostic categories and related ICD 
codes. Women could contribute to more than one diagnos-
tic  category  if  they  received  more  than  one  psychiatric 
diagnosis  during  the  study  period.  Additionally,  women 
were grouped into those who had any mental health diagno-
sis (at least one of the above-listed disorders) or not. Based 
on  the  timing  (in  relation  to  childbirth),  maternal  mental 
health  disorders  were  considered  to  occur  in  1  or  5 years 
preceding the index birth.

Perinatal outcomes

Preterm  birth  (<37 weeks’  gestation),  SGA  and  perinatal 
death (including stillbirth and neonatal death) were the pri-
mary  outcomes  of  interest.  Neonatal  death  was  defined 
based  on  the  ‘date  of  birth’  and  ‘date  of  death’  variables 
obtained  from  the  WA  Registers  of  Births  and  Deaths, 
respectively. As we had month and year of birth informa-
tion  only,  we  created  two  versions  of  the  neonatal  death 
variable: (1) including deaths that occurred within the same 
month  and  year  of  birth  and  those  reported  in  the  month 
immediately following the birth month; and (2) including 
deaths that reported only within the same month and year of 
birth.  The  latter  was  only  used  in  sensitivity  analyses. 
Australian national singleton birthweight centiles (Dobbins 
et  al.,  2012),  which  account  for  sex  and  gestation,  were 
used to define SGA (<10th percentile). Preterm birth and 
SGA were combined to create four mutually exclusive cat-
egories: term appropriate for gestational age (term-AGA), 
term SGA (term-SGA), preterm AGA (preterm-AGA) and 
preterm  SGA  (preterm-SGA).  Other  outcome  variables 
were  major  congenital  anomalies,  low  birthweight,  low 
Apgar score at 5 minutes (low Apgar-5) and foetal distress 
(listed  as  a  complication  of  labour  and  delivery).  Low  
birthweight  and  low  Apgar-5  were  defined  as  birth-
weight <2500 g  and  Apgar  score <7,  respectively.  Each 
outcome variable was dichotomised into ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

Covariates

Parity at the index birth (0, 1 and ⩾2), maternal age (<20, 
20–24, 25–29, 30–34 and ⩾35 years), socioeconomic sta-
tus  (SES),  area  of  residence  (metropolitan,  inner  region, 
outer  regional,  remote  and  very  remote),  marital  status 
(never  married,  married  and  other),  year  of  birth  (1990–
1997,  1998–2005  and  2006–2015),  pre-existing  diabetes 
(yes/no), hypertension (yes/no) and asthma (yes/no) were 
included as covariates. Area of residence was determined 
based  on  the  Australian  Statistical  Geography  Standard 
remoteness  classification  (Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics 
[ABS], 2011), which divides Australia into broad regions 
that share common characteristics of remoteness for statis-
tical use. Area-based SES disadvantage was derived based 
on the mother’s place of residence at the time of the index 

birth and measured using the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
Index  of  Relative  Socioeconomic  Disadvantage  (IRSD) 
from the Census closest to the birth (the adjacent Census 
was considered when the earlier was not available). The 
IRSD  ranks  the  relative  level  of  disadvantage  of  areas 
using  the  attributes  of  all  persons  in  each  geographical 
area and includes measures of income, educational attain-
ment, employment status, occupational skill and housing. 
Quintiles, first (most disadvantaged) to fifth (least disad-
vantaged), were determined based on the Australian dis-
tribution  of  the  small  area  values  (Pink,  2013).  While  
we  used  the  HMDC  and  MNS  datasets  to  define  pre- 
existing  medical  conditions  (diabetes,  hypertension  and 
asthma), the latter was used to identify pregnancy compli-
cations (gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and antepar-
tum haemorrhage).

Statistical analysis

We used descriptive statistics such as proportions to sum-
marise the maternal, perinatal and neonatal characteristics 
and their distributions across maternal mental health sta-
tus. A log-binomial (or -Poisson when the earlier failed to 
converge) model with clustered standard errors (account-
ing for more than one delivery per woman during the study 
period)  was  used  to  examine  the  association  between 
maternal  mental  health  disorders  and  adverse  perinatal 
outcomes. We ran a separate model for each maternal men-
tal health disorder and perinatal outcome, stratified by tim-
ing  of  exposure  (in  1  or  5 years  preceding  birth).  Risk 
ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were cal-
culated using births to women without a mental health dis-
order as a reference group. We used multinomial logistic 
regression  with  clustered  standard  errors  to  examine  the 
association between maternal mental disorders and term-
SGA, preterm-AGA and preterm-SGA (compared to term-
AGA)  and  obtained  RRs  and  95%  CIs.  Each  model  was 
adjusted  for  a  priori  identified  and  available  covariates 
(year of birth, parity, maternal age, area-based SES, area of 
residence,  marital  status,  pre-existing  diabetes,  hyperten-
sion  and  asthma).  Pregnancy  complications  were  not 
included  in  the  models  as  they  were  likely  on  the  causal 
pathway  (i.e.  intermediate  variables)  between  maternal 
mental  disorders  and  perinatal  outcomes.  For  example, 
maternal mental health problems, particularly schizophre-
nia, were found to be associated with gestational diabetes, 
which  can  increase  the  risk  of  several  adverse  perinatal 
outcomes,  including  preterm  birth  and  perinatal  death 
(Wilson et al., 2022). Thus, adjustment for gestational dia-
betes may underestimate the total causal effect of maternal 
mental disorders on perinatal outcomes.

We repeated the perinatal death models after excluding 
infant  deaths  (n = 69)  reported  in  the  month  immediately 
following the birth month as these could occur beyond the 
neonatal period. We had 3631 births (8.2%) missing data on

any  key  outcome  variables  (mainly  on  5 minute  Apgar 
score and gestational age) and 2078 (4.7%) on any covari-
ates  (notably  on  the  area  of  residence).  Births  to  women 
with missing data were less likely to have foetal distress, be 
born preterm, or be born to nulliparous and first SES quin-
tile (most disadvantaged) women. They  were more likely 
born in 2006–2015 and SGA (Supplemental Table S2). To 
account for item-level missingness, we used the Multivariate 
Imputation  by  Chained  Equations  (MICE)  imputation 
method with 50 iterations. We ran two separate imputations 
– for only covariates and all variables (including outcome 
variables)  with  missing  data.  All  covariates  used  in  the 
above  regression-based  analyses  were  included  in  the 
imputation  models.  The  imputation  was  conducted  in  
Stata  using  the  ‘mi’  command.  Finally,  we  repeated  the 
main  analyses  with  the  imputed  datasets  and  a  sample 
restricted to one randomly selected birth to women. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed using STATA version 17 
(StataCorp., 2021, College Station, TX, USA).

Ethics  approval  for  the  study  was  obtained  from  the 
Western  Australian  Department  of  Health  Human  Ethics 
Research Committee (RGS0000002808), Murdoch Univer-
sity Human Research Ethics Committee (2021/062) and the 
Western  Australian  Aboriginal  Health  Ethics  Committee 
(983). This work has been conducted as part of the Ngangk 
Yira Institute for Change (Murdoch University’s Aboriginal 
health-focused  Research  Institute,  established  and  led  by 
Aboriginal  researchers)  Maternal  and  Child  Health  Pillar 
and  followed  the  consolidated  criteria  for  strengthening 
reporting of health research involving Indigenous peoples 
(CONSIDER Statement) (Huria et al., 2019). We obtained 
endorsement from the Institute’s Elders Council. The sen-
ior author (Professor Rhonda Marriott) is a highly respected 
and experienced Aboriginal researcher who provided lead-
ership throughout the project.

Results

During  the  study  period  (1990–2015),  there  were  45,211 
Aboriginal  births  in  WA. After  excluding  multiple  births 
(n = 1044) and births with missing data on outcome varia-
bles  and  covariates  (n = 5575),  38,592  births  from  17,177 
mothers  were  available  for  all  analyses  except  for  low 
Apgar-5,  which  had  a  smaller  sample  (n = 38,458)  due  to 
further missing data on this variable.

Nearly a quarter of births (24.2%) were to women under 
20 years, about 30% were to nulliparous women, and over 
half (54.5%) were to most disadvantaged women according 
to  their  area-based  socioeconomic  measure.  The  propor-
tions of preterm birth, SGA and perinatal death were 14%, 
17% and 2%, respectively (Table 1). About 19% of births 
were  to  women  with  at  least  one  mental  health  disorder 
reported in 5 years preceding the birth, with approximately 
9% reported in the year preceding the birth. Substance use 
and  common  mental  disorders  were  the  most  prevalent 

Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 57(10)

mental health disorders reported in 1 and 5 years preceding 
the birth (see Supplemental Figure S1 for the details).

There  were  distinct  differences  in  the  distribution  of 
most demographic and perinatal characteristics across any 
maternal  mental  health  disorder  (reported  in  1  or  5 years 
preceding  the  birth).  Notably,  the  proportion  of  births  to 
multiparous  (⩾2),  women  living  in  the  metropolitan  area 
(Perth) and women with any pre-existing diabetes or asthma 
were higher for women with any mental health disorder in 
1 or 5 years preceding the birth. Additionally, women with 
any mental health disorder (reported in 1 or 5 years preced-
ing  the  birth)  were  more  likely  to  have  adverse  perinatal 
outcomes such as perinatal death, preterm birth, low birth-
weight or SGA, but less likely to be younger or live in very 
remote areas (Table 1).

Table 2 shows the associations between maternal men-
tal disorders (diagnosed in 1 or 5 years preceding the birth) 
and primary perinatal outcomes. Births to women with any 
mental health disorder in 5 years preceding the birth had a 
44%  to  52%  increased  risk  of  being  preterm,  SGA,  or 
dying  in  the  perinatal  period,  compared  with  births  to 
women  without  a  history  of  mental  health  disorders.  By 
category,  the  maternal  mental  health  disorders  that  were 
consistently  associated  with  these  perinatal  outcomes 
included  severe  mental  disorders,  common  mental  disor-
ders  and  substance  use  disorders.  We  found  similar  but 
slightly  stronger  associations  for  a  diagnosis  of  a  mental 
health disorder reported in the year preceding the birth and 
the primary perinatal outcomes, with a statistically signifi-
cant  association  between  maternal  personality  disorders 
and preterm birth.

Births  to  women  with  any  mental  disorder  (in  5 years 
preceding the birth) were more likely to be preterm-SGA 
(RR = 2.63, 95% CI = [2.21, 3.13]) than term-AGA relative 
to births to women without a mental disorder. They were 
also  more  likely  to  be  preterm-AGA  (RR = 1.69,  95% 
CI = [1.56, 1.83]) or term-SGA (RR = 1.78, 95% CI = [1.65, 
1.91])  than  term-AGA  relative  to  babies  born  to  women 
with no mental disorder. We found similar association pat-
terns across maternal mental disorder categories (reported 
in  1  or  5 years  preceding  the  birth)  and  stronger  associa-
tions for maternal mental disorders occurring in one year 
preceding the birth and preterm-SGA. The strongest asso-
ciation was found between maternal substance use disorder 
(reported in the year preceding the birth) and preterm-SGA 
(RR = 4.20, 95% CI = [3.32, 5.31]) (Table 3).

We also found associations between any maternal men-
tal health disorders (reported in 1 or 5 years preceding the 
birth) and all secondary perinatal outcomes (major congen-
ital anomalies, low birthweight, low Apgar score at 5 min-
utes  and  foetal  distress),  although  the  strength  of  the 
association varied across the outcomes (RRs ranged from 
1.18 to 2.00) and was consistently elevated for any mental 
health disorders reported in the year preceding the birth and 
low  birthweight  (Table  4).  While  substance  use  disorder

datasets (Supplemental Tables S3 and S4) or after exclud-
ing  infant  deaths  reported  in  the  month  immediately  fol-
lowing  the  birth  month  (data  not  shown).  The  results  of 
additional  analyses  (restricted  to  one  birth  per  woman) 
were not substantially different from the primary analysis 
results,  although  some  of  the  estimates  were  less  precise 
(Supplemental  Tables  S5  and  S6).  We  also  found  similar 
results when using a binary outcome (yes/no) variable that 
captured any of the adverse perinatal outcomes of interest 
(Table S7).

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study, we found statistically 
significant  associations  between  most  types  of  maternal 
mental  health  disorders  and  a  range  of  adverse  perinatal 
outcomes (preterm birth, SGA, perinatal death, major con-
genital anomalies, foetal distress, low birthweight and low 
Apgar  score)  among  babies  born  to  Aboriginal  women. 
Overall, the associations did not vary substantially by the 
types of maternal mental disorder and perinatal outcomes, 
although  they  were  slightly  stronger  in  cases  where  the 
maternal  mental  health  contact  was  proximal  to  the  birth 

(i.e. diagnosed in the year preceding the birth) and for sub-
stance  use  disorder. Additionally,  our  study  demonstrated 
consistently  stronger  associations  for  almost  all  maternal 
mental disorders and preterm births with poor foetal growth 
compared to births with other gestational age and growth 
combinations, providing additional evidence for the causal 
claim (Lewis et al., 2015).

The impacts of depression and anxiety problems during 
pregnancy on perinatal outcomes, particularly on low birth-
weight  and  preterm  birth,  have  been  well  studied  in  the 
general  population.  Our  effect  estimates  for  the  associa-
tions between common mental disorders (including depres-
sion and anxiety) and low birthweight and preterm birth are 
comparable  with  the  extant  findings  among  studies  of 
mainstream populations (Ding et al., 2014; Ghimire et al., 
2021;  Grigoriadis  et  al.,  2018).  However,  this  is  the  first 
comprehensive study to show the effect of maternal mental 
health  disorders  across  the  diagnosis  spectrum  for  the 
Australian Aboriginal population – thereby expanding from 
the  existing  limited  evidence  focusing  only  on  substance 
use disorders (Adane et al., 2022). These findings broadly 
underscore  the  need  for  further  research  (to  establish  the 
evidence  base  and  elucidate  the  underlying  mechanisms)

and suggest that targeted perinatal mental health interven-
tions that provide appropriate support to Aboriginal moth-
ers will improve perinatal outcomes.

We  also  demonstrated  a  heightened  risk  of  perinatal 
mortality for women with mental health disorders (includ-
ing severe, common and substance use disorders), particu-
larly when Aboriginal women had these conditions reported 
around  the  time  of  pregnancy  (in  the  year  before  birth). 
These  findings  extended  the  detrimental  effect  of  poor 
maternal  mental  health  beyond  early  life  morbidity  out-
comes and are consistent with the results of our previous 
systematic review and meta-analysis (Adane et al., 2021), 
which included 28 studies. In contrast to our study, a recent 
study in the state of Victoria, Australia, did not find signifi-
cant  associations  between  severe  maternal  mental  illness 
and  stillbirth  or  neonatal  death  (Edvardsson  et  al.,  2022). 
This could be due to variations in the study population and 
control group. While the current study included only sin-
gleton births to Aboriginal women and used women with-
out  any  mental  health  disorders  as  a  reference  group,  the 
Victorian study included all singleton births to Aboriginal 
and  non-Aboriginal  women.  The  latter  also  used  women 
without  severe  mental  illness  as  a  control  group,  which 
could  involve  women  with  other  mental  health  disorders. 
Our findings on SGA, congenital anomalies, low 5-minute 
Apgar score and foetal distress are consistent with the pre-
vious  literature  showing  associations  between  severe 
maternal  mental  illness  and  foetal  distress,  anomalies  or 
low  Apgar  score  (Edvardsson  et  al.,  2022;  Etchecopar-
Etchart  et  al.,  2022;  Heun-Johnson  et  al.,  2019;  Zhong 
et al., 2018); and between major depression, bipolar or sub-
stance  use  disorder  and  SGA  (Mei-Dan  et  al.,  2015; 
O’Leary  et  al.,  2020).  However,  investigations  of  this 
nature  are  rare  in Australian Aboriginal  populations,  sug-
gesting the need for more well-designed prospective stud-
ies  to  replicate  our  finding  and  strengthen  the  evidence 
base.  What  cannot  be  elucidated  in  the  current  data  is 
whether Aboriginal women who are seen by public mental 
health services are more likely to be given a mental health 
diagnosis and what cultural and contextual considerations 
were made in this process. Furthermore, the extent to which 
Aboriginal women who present with mental health disor-
ders receive evidence-informed interventions and treatment 
is unknown. Given the plethora of literature describing the 
impact  of  racism  and  unconscious  bias  within  health  ser-
vices, including mental health services, on access to appro-
priate services, diagnosis and treatment, it is likely this is an 
unaccounted-for factor in our examination of both mental 
health and perinatal outcomes (Kelaher et al., 2014; Peek, 
2021; Talamaivao et al., 2020).

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (including 
five  studies  of  1114  women  with  a  personality  disorder  
and  8,527,780  control  women)  reported  a  greater  risk  of 
preterm birth, low birthweight and low Apgar score (pooled 

ORs ranging from 2.0 to 2.6) for women with a personality 
disorder (Marshall et al., 2020). In line with this, we showed 
an  association  between  maternal  personality  disorder  and 
some perinatal outcomes (preterm birth and foetal distress). 
But  the  association  with  our  other  key  perinatal  out-
comes, including low birthweight and Apgar score, did not 
reach  statistical  significance  –  perhaps  due  to  the  small 
sample sizes.

Our analysis included all WA Aboriginal singleton births 
during  the  study  period,  which  minimised  selection  and 
response biases, provided statistical power to evaluate rela-
tively  rare  perinatal  outcomes  (e.g.  perinatal  death)  and 
enhanced the generalisability of our findings. Unlike most 
previous  studies,  we  have  comprehensively  assessed  the 
full spectrum of maternal mental health disorders based on 
standard assessment and classification. The study also had 
some  limitations.  We  used  administrative  data,  which  is 
prone  to  misclassification  and  other  errors.  Our  mental 
health data sources (HMDC and MHIS) may not capture all 
mental health cases, particularly less severe cases that did 
not result in a diagnosis as well as women who sought men-
tal health care through their general practitioner, Aboriginal 
Medical Service and private practitioners including private 
psychologists  and  psychiatrists.  Further,  these  diagnoses 
are based on clinical records and assessments that are then 
entered into the database not diagnostic interviews and val-
idated  measures  of  mental  health  diagnoses.  This  means 
women with mental health disorders could be misclassified 
and reduce the strength of the association between maternal 
mental  disorders  and  perinatal  outcomes.  Although  we 
have  adjusted  for  a  range  of  factors,  we  have  no  data  on 
smoking during pregnancy, alcohol consumption, obesity, 
pharmacological treatments in pregnancy for mental health 
disorders and the level of antenatal and mental health care, 
which are major issues for individuals with mental health 
disorders  (Ben-Sheetrit  et  al.,  2018;  Scott  and  Happell, 
2011). We lack data on whether the preterm birth is due to 
spontaneous  labour  or  medically  indicated  and  statistical 
power to examine the dose–response relationship (if any) 
between maternal mental health disorders and the severity 
of preterm birth. We had limited statistical power for some 
mental health disorders (e.g. personality disorder) and neo-
natal  outcomes  (e.g.  perinatal  death)  and  did  not  reach  a 
definitive conclusion in these cases.

Generally, most of the study effect sizes are in the small 
to moderate range and likely, at least partly, due to the clus-
tering  of  adverse  maternal  risk  factors  among  women  
who  experience  poor  mental  health  disorders  (Gibberd 
et al., 2019; Vermeulen-Smit et al., 2015). However, given 
the  prevalence  of  mental  health  conditions  is  high  in  the 
Aboriginal  population  in  general  and  in  women  during  
their  perinatal  period  (Ogilvie  et  al.,  2021;  Owais  et  al., 
2020;  Page  et  al.,  2022),  these  findings  have  important 
impli cations  and  relevance  for  public  health  prevention.

Furthermore, what is evident is structural barriers to access 
to mental health care over the perinatal period that urgently 
need  to  be  addressed  (Bhat  et  al.,  2020;  Denison  et  al., 
2014).  This  includes  specific  perinatal  mental  health  ser-
vices  such  as  Mother  Baby  Units  (Galbally  et  al.,  2019). 
The impact of maternal mental health on preterm birth and 
low  birthweight  is  of  interest  as  these  are  critical  public 
health  issues  in  the Aboriginal  population  (AIHW,  2021) 
and are well-known indicators of health and development 
outcomes  across  the  life  course  (Wolke  et  al.,  2019). 
Therefore,  overall  integrated  prevention  of  mental  health 
problems and early identification, holistic, trauma-informed 
antenatal care, support and treatment for mental health that 
is also culturally sensitive and safe for Aboriginal women 
are urgently required to improve women’s health and well-
being and their pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (Howard 
and Khalifeh, 2020; Reibel et al., 2015; Reibel and Walker, 
2010). Such culturally sensitive wrap-around services (co-
designed and community-led) have been shown to improve 
the  rate  of  antenatal  care  attendance,  preterm  birth  and 
breastfeeding among the First Nations Australians (Kildea 
et  al.,  2021).  Cultural  safety  requires  employing  more 
Aboriginal  health  and  mental  health  workers,  increasing 
the  cultural  competency  of  non-Aboriginal  health  practi-
tioners and developing health service policies in collabora-
tion with Aboriginal peak bodies and the local communities 
(Upton et al., 2021).

Conclusion

In  this  large  population-based  retrospective  cohort  study, 
we  found  negative  associations  between  maternal  mental 
disorders across the diagnostic spectrum and perinatal out-
comes  after  adjustment  for  sociodemographic  factors  and 
pre-existing comorbid conditions. The size of the associa-
tions did not considerably vary when examined by the types 
of maternal mental disorders. The effect sizes were of the 
small  to  moderate  range  and  were  slightly  stronger  for 
mental  health  disorders  reported  around  pregnancy  and 
substance use disorders. Prevention and early identification 
of Aboriginal  women  with  mental  health  disorders  using 
culturally  validated  tools,  provision  of  holistic  antenatal 
care, access to culturally sensitive and safe mental health 
treatment and support for Aboriginal women may improve 
adverse perinatal and later life outcomes.
