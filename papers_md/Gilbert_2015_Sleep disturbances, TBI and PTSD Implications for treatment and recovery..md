Abstract

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and sleep problems 
significantly affect recovery and functional status in military personnel and Veterans returning 
from combat. Despite recent attention, sleep is understudied in the Veteran population. Few 
treatments and rehabilitation protocols target sleep, although poor sleep remains at clinical levels 
and continues to adversely impact functioning even after the resolution of PTSD or mild TBI 
symptoms. Recent developments in non-pharmacologic sleep treatments have proven efficacious 
as stand-alone interventions and have potential to improve treatment outcomes by augmenting 
traditional behavioral and cognitive therapies. This review discusses the extensive scope of work in 
the area of sleep as it relates to TBI and PTSD, including pathophysiology and neurobiology of 
sleep; existing and emerging treatment options; as well as methodological issues in sleep 
measurements for TBI and PTSD. Understanding sleep problems and their role in the development 
and maintenance of PTSD and TBI symptoms may lead to improvement in overall treatment 
outcomes while offering a non-stigmatizing entry in mental health services and make current 
treatments more comprehensive by helping to address a broader spectrum of difficulties.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of sleep disorders in the general population (Ohayon, 2007) has gained much 
attention in recent years, as problems with sleep have been linked to increased psychological 
sequelae (Vandekerckhove & Cluydts, 2010); increased health problems, particularly 
cardiovascular health (Lofaso et al., 1996); impaired immune function (Gamaldo, Shaikh, & 
McArthur, 2012); and even increased mortality (Li, Sato, & Yamaguchi, 2013). The impact 
of sleep disturbances is now recognized as being wide spread, affecting individuals across 
age groups, ethnicities, and degrees of health status.

Given the prevalence of sleep difficulties in other neurologic, medical, and psychiatric 
conditions, it is not surprising that sleep problems are common in individuals with traumatic 
brain injury (TBI), including those with mild (m)TBI1. Overall, approximately 40–65% of 
individuals with mTBI report symptoms of insomnia (Beetar, Guilmette, & Sparadeo, 1996; 
Dikmen, McLean, & Temkin, 1986). The etiology of these sleep problems is still under 
investigation, though recent research has implicated neurobiological factors such as 
impairment in the functioning of neural circuits involved in sleep-wake regulation 
(Faraguna, Vyazovskiy, Nelson, Tononi, & Cirelli, 2008; Saper, Chou, & Scammell, 2001). 
Moreover, there is a wide range of sleep-wake dysfunctions that emerge from TBI other than 
insomnia, including hypersomnia and circadian rhythm abnormalities (Ayalon, Borodkin, 
Dishon, Kanety, & Dagan, 2007). It is also not clear to what extent restorative sleep is 
related to successful recovery in individuals with TBI or whether there is a cumulative 
impact of the severity of TBI on the severity of sleep disorders. What is known is that poor 
sleep may exacerbate symptoms of TBI (Ouellet & Morin, 2007), impact the individual’s 
ability to cope with these symptoms (Lew et al., 2009), increase neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(depression, anxiety and apathy) post-injury (Rao, McCann, Han, Bergey, & Smith, 2014), 
and inhibit complete participation in rehabilitation treatments (Worthington & Melia, 2006).

1Throughout the review we refer to TBI and mTBI as both are of importance in this discussion. As elaborated on in this review, there 
might be overlapping and distinct sleep symptoms along the spectrum of TBI severity. As such, we attempt to be as inclusive as 
possible of the studies that examine TBI with relation to sleep regardless of the severity of the patients in the studies. Therefore, we 
wanted to present the readers with the definitions of TBI and to clarify the conceptual definition of both TBI and mTBI. DoD/VA 
Common Definition: TBI is a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of 
an external force that is indicated by the onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the 
event: any period of a loss of or decreased level of consciousness; any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the 
injury; any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (feeling dazed, confused, disoriented, thinking slowly, etc.); neurological 
deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be 
transient; and intracranial lesion (DOD, 2009). Definition of mild TBI by Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee of the Head Injury 
Interdisciplinary Special Interest Group of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine: A patient with mTBI is a person who 
has had a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function, as manifested by at least one of the following: any period 
of loss of consciousness; any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident; any alteration in mental state at the 
time of the accident (e.g., feeling dazed, disoriented, or confused); and focal neurological deficit(s) that may or may not be transient, 
but where the severity of the injury does not exceed the following: loss of consciousness of approximately 30 minutes or less; after 30 
minutes, an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13–15; and posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) not greater than 24 hours (ACRM, 1993).

PTSD is another major psychiatric disorder with poor sleep being one of its principal 
symptoms. In PTSD, disturbed sleep is part of the diagnostic criteria, with insomnia being a 
symptom of alterations in arousal and reactivity (Cluster E), and nightmares as part of the re-
experiencing symptom cluster (Cluster B) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 
Consequently, individuals with PTSD tend to present with extremely poor, fragmented, and 
variable sleep quality as measured by self-report (van Liempt, 2012). As with TBI, it is not 
clear to what extent the severity of sleep disturbance maintains the psychopathology of 
PTSD given that poor sleep is associated with increased anxiety, irritability, and deficient 
coping (K. Babson et al., 2011; Pietrzak et al., 2010; van Liempt, 2012). Recently it has 
been reported that poor sleep independently predicts the development of depression 
(Baglioni et al., 2011; Buysse et al., 2008; Jackson, Sztendur, Diamond, Byles, & Bruck, 
2014; Peppard, Szklo-Coxe, Hla, & Young, 2006; Szklo-Coxe, Young, Peppard, Finn, & 
Benca, 2010), PTSD (Bryant, Creamer, O’Donnell, Silove, & McFarlane, 2010; Gehrman et 
al., 2013; Gerhart, Hall, Russ, Canetti, & Hobfoll, 2014; Kobayashi & Mellman, 2012; 
Koffel, Polusny, Arbisi, & Erbes, 2013; Spoormaker & Montgomery, 2008; Swinkels, 
Ulmer, Beckham, Buse, & Calhoun, 2013; Wright et al., 2011), changes in post-deployment 
depression and PTSD symptoms (Wright et al., 2011), suicide risk in both clinical and non-
clinical populations (Pigeon, Pinquart, & Conner, 2012; Ribeiro et al., 2012; and for a 
review see Woznica, Carney, Kuo, & Moss, 2014), and is more related to low satisfaction 
with life and post-deployment community integration than other symptoms of PTSD (Kark, 
Stavitsky, Deluca, Lafleche, & Bogdanova, 2013). Furthermore, there is some evidence that 
poor sleep likely impacts the efficacy of evidence-based psychotherapy for treatment of 
PTSD (Nappi, Drummond, & Hall, 2012). This evidence is based on the fact that restorative 
sleep is necessary for the consolidation of emotional memories (Payne, Chambers, & 
Kensinger, 2012; Payne & Kensinger, 2011; Stickgold & Walker, 2007; Walker, 2010) and 
generalization of fear extinction (Pace-Schott et al., 2009; Pace-Schott, Verga, Bennett, & 
Spencer, 2012) - cognitive processes that are the foundation of most evidence-based 
treatments for PTSD (van Liempt, 2012).

Given the nature of the recent conflicts, with high rates of physical and psychological 
injuries due to blast exposures and multiple tours of duty, returning Veterans are often 
present with co-occurring TBI and PTSD (reviewed in Bogdanova & Verfaellie, 2012). 
Three of the largest studies evaluating OEF/OIF/OND Veterans report 5–7% of Veterans 
have probable co-morbid mTBI/PTSD, and in those with mTBI, the rate of co-morbid PTSD 
is between 33% and 39% (Carlson et al., 2011). Little is known about the overlap or 
differences between PTSD and TBI with respect to sleep. Few studies have compared 
individuals with co-occurring PTSD and TBI to those with TBI or PTSD only, to evaluate 
sleep quality and to determine the differential contribution of these distinct yet overlapping 
conditions to sleep impairment. One recent study examined PTSD vs. TBI in returning 
combat Veterans and found no differences between diagnostic groups (PTSD vs. TBI) with 
the exception of increased arousals among patients with PTSD and greater slow wave sleep 
(SWS) among those with TBI (Capaldi, Guerrero, & Killgore, 2011). These results suggest 
some sleep problems in PTSD and TBI might be distinguishable between the two 
conditions.

The overlap between TBI and PTSD combined with other confounding deployment- and 
post-deployment-related factors, present significant methodological challenges, which make 
it difficult to conduct research and to interpret the findings in this population. A recent 
prospective study explored the role of sleep as a mediating factor in the development of 
mental health symptoms (TBI, PTSD and depression) in a large sample (29,640) of US Navy 
and Marine Corps men (Macera, Aralis, Rauh, & MacGregor, 2013). Sleep problems 
mediated the association between TBI and the development of PTSD and depression. The 
results suggest that sleep problems may be an early indicator of risk for PTSD or depression 
in TBI. Further, there is evidence that sleep problems can be considered a separate post-
deployment health problem, distinct from PTSD, TBI, and depression (Maguen, Lau, 
Madden, & Seal, 2012). These and other research findings highlighted in this review, despite 
their methodological limitations, provide future research directions and suggest that early 
identification and treatment of sleep disturbance may potentially prevent the development 
and improve the outcome of mental health disorders, such as PTSD and depression.

This review is intended to 1) provide the latest information on sleep as it relates to the 
pathophysiology and psychopathology of PTSD and TBI, particularly in military personnel 
and Veterans returning from more recent Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring 
Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) conflicts; and 2) to discuss how sleep 
impacts recovery, course of treatment and outcome in these individuals. Sleep problems are 
prevalent among OEF/OIF/OND Veterans and are reported to be among the primary 
complaints (Faestel, Littell, Vitiello, Forsberg, & Littman, 2013; Hoge et al., 2008; McLay, 
Klam, & Volkert, 2010; Wallace et al., 2011). Veterans returning from combat present with a 
variety of sleep disturbances that are not limited to insomnia and include circadian rhythm 
disorders, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and even possibly Rapid Eye Movement (REM) 
Behavior Disorder (Mysliwiec, Gill, et al., 2013; Mysliwiec, McGraw, et al., 2013). Since 
poor sleep may exacerbate psychological suffering related to combat-related physical (i.e., 
mTBI) and psychological (i.e., PTSD) trauma and given the evidence that sleep may 
moderate the efficacy of behavioral treatments for these conditions, it is important to 
understand the etiology of sleep disorders in this population.

While trauma-focused PTSD treatments have led to some improvements in sleep, nearly half 
of PTSD treatment positive responders report residual sleep problems, despite relief in other 
symptom domains (Schoenfeld, Deviva, & Manber, 2012; Zayfert & DeViva, 2004). The 
emergence of sleep as a distinct post-deployment factor (Maguen et al., 2012) highlights the 
need to address sleep disturbances in the clinical screening process and to develop sleep-
specific treatment protocols. Moreover, sleep treatment has the potential to provide a non-
stigmatizing entry into mental health services by focusing on a topic that Veterans may not 
consider to be ‘mental health treatment’, thereby maximizing engagement in treatment 
(Epstein, Babcock-Parziale, Herb, Goren, & Bushnell, 2013). For example, a recent case 
study found that pre-empting PTSD treatment with sleep-focused intervention facilitated 
successful entry into exposure-based therapy for PTSD (Baddeley & Gros, 2013). Although 
to date there is a paucity of studies examining the efficacy of sleep treatment for Veterans 
with mTBI and PTSD, the few recent treatment outcome studies in PTSD have shown a 
positive impact of sleep treatment on PTSD symptoms (Casement & Swanson, 2012; 
Germain et al., 2012; Nakamura, Lipschitz, Landward, Kuhn, & West, 2011; Nappi et al.,

returning Veterans with comorbid TBI and PTSD.

SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND PTSD

Sleep disturbance is one of the core features of PTSD (Calhoun et al., 2007; Dagan, Zinger, 
& Lavie, 1997). Approximately 70% of patients with PTSD have co-occurring sleep 
problems (K. A. Babson & Feldner, 2010). PTSD has been associated with reduced sleep 
efficiency, increased sleep latency, increased sleep fragmentation, and greater night-to-night 
variability in sleep (Breslau et al., 2004; Calhoun et al., 2007; Habukawa, Uchimura, Maeda, 
Kotorii, & Maeda, 2007; Mellman, Kulick-Bell, Ashlock, & Nolan, 1995; Straus, 
Drummond, Nappi, Jenkins, & Norman, 2015). Sleep difficulties in the Veteran population 
are linked to a variety of poor mental health and socioeconomic outcomes. For example, one 
recent study found that poor sleep quality was associated with PTSD, panic disorder, 
depression, suicidal ideation, and risky drinking behavior in Iraq/Afghanistan Veterans 
(Swinkels et al., 2013). Other studies have reported similar poor outcomes in Veterans with 
sleep difficulties including lower quality of life and more severe fatigue, pain, PTSD, and 
depressive symptoms compared to those without sleep difficulties (Lang, Veazey-Morris, & 
Andrasik, 2014; Wallace et al., 2011). Ribeiro and colleagues (2012) reported an association 
between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation in a sample of 311 military personnel. 
Specifically, sleep disturbances were found to be predictive of shorter time to suicide (57% 
loss of survival time) in Veterans in Veterans Health Administration care (Pigeon, Britton, 
Ilgen, Chapman, & Conner, 2012). Investigating the relationship between sleep disturbances 
and suicide is important given the high rates of reported sleep disturbances in Veterans 
Health Administration users (Mustafa, Erokwu, Ebose, & Strohl, 2005) and in returning 
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans (Hoge et al., 2004; Neylan et al., 1998; Seelig et al., 2010; Wallace 
et al., 2011); as the rate of suicide is not entirely attributable to a PTSD diagnosis (Lewis, 
Creamer, & Failla, 2009). This information may help with suicide risk identification and 
prevention methods as well as early and effective sleep-focused interventions for Veterans at 
high risk for suicide.

Sleep disturbance itself may be a risk factor for development of PTSD following exposure to 
trauma (Bryant et al., 2010; Gehrman et al., 2013; Gerhart et al., 2014; Kobayashi & 
Mellman, 2012; Koffel et al., 2013; Spoormaker & Montgomery, 2008; Swinkels et al., 
2013; Wright et al., 2011). A longitudinal investigation of sleep and trauma-related distress 
found that initial sleep problems predicted increased PTSD and depression at 6 month 
follow-up, whereas initial PTSD and depression did not predict increased sleep problems 
(Gerhart et al., 2014). A longer follow- up study similarly found that pre-deployment sleep 
complaints uniquely and incrementally predicted PTSD and depression up to two years after 
deployment, even after controlling for baseline psychiatric symptoms and negative 
emotionality characteristics (Koffel et al., 2013). These findings suggest that pre-trauma 
sleep disturbance predicts later development of PTSD following exposure to trauma, even 
after controlling for pre-existing psychopathology. Sleep disturbances may also mediate the 
effect of mTBI on the development of PTSD and depression and may be an early indicator 
of risk for depression and PTSD in blast exposed OEF/OIF/OND Veterans (Macera et al., 
2013). These findings highlight the importance of pre-deployment sleep symptom screening

procedures, which could allow for early identification of Veterans with pre-deployment sleep 
problems, and facilitate prospective post-deployment care and health planning.

Sleep problems are particularly common in returning Veterans with PTSD compared to 
those without PTSD or trauma history (N. Orr et al., 2010). A recent review of deployment-
related insomnia in military personnel provides a thorough overview of how sleep problems 
develop in military personnel and Veterans and are perpetuated by the deployment 
experience (Bramoweth & Germain, 2013). Mellman and colleagues (1995) evaluated sleep 
quality among combat Veterans with PTSD and found that the most commonly reported 
sleep-related symptoms were recurrent awakenings, threatening dreams, thrashing 
movements while sleeping, and waking up startled or in a panic. One recent study by 
Mysliwiec and colleagues (2013) found an increased rate of comorbid diagnoses of 
insomnia and OSA in US military personnel returning from deployment presenting to a 
sleep clinic. In this retrospective cross-sectional study sleep disorders were diagnosed in 
88.2% of subjects with 62.7% meeting diagnostic criteria for OSA and 63.6% for insomnia. 
Those with comorbid insomnia and OSA were more likely to meet criteria for PTSD and 
depression (Mysliwiec, McGraw, et al., 2013). Wallace and colleagues (2011) characterized 
sleep quality in OEF/OEF/OND Veterans with PTSD and insomnia (with and without 
mTBI). Fifty-six percent of the PTSD group reported severe insomnia and 44% reported 
moderate insomnia. Both groups (PTSD vs. mTBI) reported severe difficulties with sleep 
initiation, maintenance, early awakenings, and daytime fatigue, while daytime sleepiness 
was greater in the PTSD-mTBI group. When compared to the PTSD-mTBI insomnia group, 
the PTSD group showed worse sleep continuity measured by actigraphy (ACT) (sleep 
efficiency, nighttime awakenings, and fragmentation index). These data suggest that, while 
both groups reported similar insomnia severity, patients with PTSD might be experiencing 
more sleep quality difficulties while the PTSD-mTBI patients might be suffering from a 
differential set of difficulties resulting from a complex interplay between insomnia and 
hypersomnia.

Sleep Discrepancies in PTSD: Current Issues

While subjective sleep complaints are a core feature in PTSD, previous studies have been 
unable to consistently corroborate subjective sleep complaints (i.e., self-report 
questionairres, sleep diaries) with objective sleep measurements (i.e., polysomnography 
[PSG], ACT) (Germain, Hall, Shear, Nofzinger, & Buysse, 2006; Pillar, Malhotra, & Lavie, 
2000; Woodward, Bliwise, Friedman, & Gusman, 1996). One issue might be that PSG 
studies typically rely on only 1 or 2 nights of data collection, which is problematic if 
symptom severity is intermittent or highly variable. Indeed, recent evidence suggests greater 
intraindividual variability of sleep in military-related PTSD, relative to primary insomnia 
patients and healthy controls (Straus et al., 2015). Further, it has been suggested that many 
patients with PTSD may sleep better in a PSG laboratory because they feel safer or more 
protected under the observation of research staff compared to their home environment, 
which compromises the ecological validity of the data (Germain et al., 2006; Khawaja, 
Hashmi, Aftab, Westermeyer, & Hurwitz, 2014). In line with this theory, results from a small 
pilot study revealed a relationship between in-home PSG-measured sleep disturbances and 
subjective sleep problems in a sample of adult crime victims with PTSD (Germain et al.,

2006). While PSG is the gold standard for objective sleep measurement, it is also costly and 
might not be the most practical or ecologically-valid method to examine sleep in the PTSD 
population.

While the ambulatory nature of actigraphic monitoring allows for more ecologically-valid 
data collection and prolonged sleep recording compared to PSG, the relationship between 
ACT and self-reported sleep quality also remains equivocal (for a review see Khawaja et al., 
2014). For example, prior work reported a significant relationship between sleep diary and 
ACT total sleep time (TST), but sleep diaries underestimated the number of sleep 
awakenings compared to ACT (Westermeyer et al., 2007). These findings suggest that ACT 
and diary data may align on some but not all measures of sleep quality. In a recent CBT-I 
intervention study for chronic PTSD that used both ambulatory PSG and ACT, the treatment 
group showed post-treatment improvements in both PSG-measured TST and self-reported 
sleep symptoms, compared to the waitlist group (Talbot et al., 2014). The PSG data were 
only based on one night of data collection and there were no significant improvements in 
continuous ACT-measured sleep to corroborate the PSG data or self-reported sleep 
improvements. More research is necessary to understand the accuracy of PSG and ACT-
measured sleep in the PTSD population.

Although the disparities between objective and subjective sleep data are often considered a 
source of measurement error, it has also been suggested that the difference between 
objective and subjective sleep measurements, or sleep discrepancies, might capture clinically 
meaningful correlates of psychiatric status (Williams, Kay, Rowe, & McCrae, 2013). Prior 
work has been unable to demonstrate a relationship between sleep discrepancies and PTSD 
status (Kobayashi, Huntley, Lavela, & Mellman, 2012), which is thought to reflect sleep 
misperceptions in PTSD (Dagan et al., 1997; Klein, Koren, Arnon, & Lavie, 2003; 
Kobayashi et al., 2012). Indeed, “paradoxical insomnia”-a relatively new diagnosis that first 
appeared in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders - 3rd Edition (ICSD-3; 
American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014)- is characterized by quantifiable discrepancies 
between objective and subjective sleep measurements. While paradoxical insomnia is 
relatively rare amongst civilians with insomnia (5%), a recent study reported paradoxical 
insomnia in 17.2% of a large cohort of active duty military personnel with sleep disorders 
(Mysliwiec, McGraw, et al., 2013). Further, results of a recent study reported underestimated 
self-reported TST compared to ACT TST, which offers new evidence for PTSD-related 
paradoxical insomnia (Ghadami, Khaledi-Paveh, Nasouri, & Khazaie, 2014). These findings 
highlight the importance of utilizing objective sleep measures in the military population, 
without which paradoxical insomnia would go undetected.

Despite the prevalence of paradoxical insomnia, individuals with PTSD do likely suffer from 
objective insomnia. However, the experience of true insomnia related to acute PTSD may 
give rise to enduring thought patterns about sleep that eventually manifest as subjective 
insomnia in chronic PTSD (Dagan et al., 1997). A recent PSG study demonstrated 
fragmented and reduced REM sleep in PTSD patients with relatively proximate trauma 
exposure compared to unaltered REM sleep in the chronic or ‘distal’ PTSD patients, even 
after controlling for depression (Mellman, Kobayashi, Lavela, Wilson, & Hall Brown, 2014). 
Sleep state misperceptions in paradoxical insomnia might be especially common for

returning Veterans as they reintegrate into a safe sleeping environment after maintaining 
high levels of nocturnal vigilance during deployment (Mysliwiec, McGraw, et al., 2013). 
Further, a recent neuroimaging study reported a link between decreased subjective sleep 
quality and reduced cortical and frontal grey matter volume in Gulf War Veterans without a 
current psychiatric diagnosis, which may suggest an association between frontal lobe 
integrity and the capacity to experience sleep as restorative (Chao, Mohlenhoff, Weiner, & 
Neylan, 2014). These findings provide potential neural evidence to corroborate the theory of 
dysfunctional cognitions and thought patterns about subjective sleep quality. Further work is 
necessary to 1) understand the prevalence and clinical implications of sleep discrepancies or 
‘paradoxical insomnia’ in returning Veterans with and without PTSD, 2) investigate if these 
discrepancies arise during the shift from acute (or ‘proximal’) PTSD to chronic (or ‘distal’ 
PTSD), and 3) develop early and effective interventions to alleviate sleep misperceptions 
that might arise in military-related chronic PTSD.

Neurobiological Correlates of Sleep in PTSD

Neuroimaging studies are beginning to explore the brain-behavior link in individuals with 
PTSD and have recently reported neurobehavioral correlates of sleep disturbance in those 
with PTSD. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies have found hyperactivation of 
the amygdala and impaired medial prefrontal cortex function in patients with PTSD 
(Germain, Buysse, & Nofzinger, 2008; Hughes & Shin, 2011). Specifically, patients with 
PTSD show hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to threat-related stimuli, which 
exaggerates the fear response (Germain et al., 2008; Hughes & Shin, 2011; Patel, Spreng, 
Shin, & Girard, 2012). Activation of the medial prefrontal cortex, which is critically 
involved in fear extinction, might be impaired in PTSD subjects compared to trauma-
exposed controls (Liberzon & Sripada, 2008). With regard to sleep, investigators have found 
both hypo and hyperactivation of specific brain regions in individuals with PTSD during 
sleep. For example, Germain and colleagues (2013) found that OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with 
PTSD experience elevated neural activity during wakefulness and REM sleep in the REM-
generating and arousal regions of the brainstem. Results showed hyperactivation of the brain 
in arousal-related regions involved in REM sleep regulation (midbrain reticular formation 
left and right locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, pedunculopontine, laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, 
cerebellum) as well as limbic structures involved in emotion and memory processing 
(hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, insula, and thalamus).

Nightmares in PTSD may be facilitated by the hypoactivity of the dorsal medial prefrontal 
cortex, which modulates the activity in subcortical limbic regions, such as the amygdala, 
during REM sleep (Germain et al., 2008; Germain et al., 2013). In a similar vein, earlier 
studies found that symptomatic awakenings in those with PTSD were preceded by REM 
sleep, suggesting that arousal may intrude upon the sleep state via increased amygdala 
activity or impaired medial prefrontal cortex function (Mellman, Bustamante, Fins, Pigeon, 
& Nolan, 2002; Mellman et al., 1995). An electroencephalographic study by Cohen and 
colleagues (2013) compared sleep architecture between combat Veterans with and without 
PTSD and found no difference between measures of central arousal (beta and gamma 
activity) between groups. The authors suggest that central arousal might be indicative of 
primary insomnia whereas hyperarousal symptoms in PTSD might reflect increased

autonomic and limbic activity and/or dysfunction in sleep-related memory or emotional 
processing. The results from this study also revealed that, in combat-exposed Veterans 
without PTSD, REM and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep sigma activity was 
positively correlated with level of combat exposure and NREM sigma activity was 
negatively correlated with PTSD avoidance symptoms. The authors concluded that these 
data suggest the possibility of a sleep architecture-related marker of resilience to PTSD 
(Cohen et al., 2013).

In 2013, van Liempt and colleagues reported the results of a study investigating 
Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and sleep dysfunction in Veterans with PTSD 
compared to trauma-exposed and healthy controls (van Liempt et al., 2013). The group 
collected objective and subjective measures of sleep quality as well as cortisol, 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and melatonin levels. While no difference in sleep 
architecture was found between the 3 groups, the PTSD group experienced more nighttime 
awakenings, which were positively correlated with ACTH levels. ACTH and cortisol were 
also inversely related to slow wave sleep and ACTH was found to be an independent 
predictor of SWS in those with PTSD. The authors suggest that fragmented sleep in PTSD 
might be associated with increased corticotrophin-releasing hormone, which inhibits SWS. 
The authors did not find evidence of phase shifts in circadian rhythms of cortisol, ACTH, or 
melatonin in Veterans with PTSD. Of note, a recent study by the same group found a strong 
relationship between sleep fragmentation and blunted growth hormone secretion in PTSD, 
both of which might negatively impact sleep-dependent memory consolidation (van Liempt, 
Vermetten, Lentjes, Arends, & Westenberg, 2011). Together, the foregoing studies provide 
evidence for dysregulation of arousal centers of the brain related to sleep disturbances in 
PTSD.

The HPA axis is a neurohormonal feedback loop that functions as part of the stress response 
system and regulates other biological processes including mood and emotions, digestion, 
and physical activity. Among the more important and most easily measurable hormones 
released through the HPA axis is cortisol, which can serve as an index of HPA activity and 
marker of circadian rhythms; the release of which is activated by the feedback loop initiated 
by the corticotrophin-releasing hormone secreted by the paraventricular nucleus of the 
hypothalamus. The release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus is 
influenced by the sleep/wake cycle in addition to having an endogenous circadian rhythm. 
Studies have found that upon awakening, there is an immediate rise in cortisol, known as the 
cortisol awakening response (CAR), which reaches its peak approximately 30 minutes 
following awakening (Fries, Dettenborn, & Kirschbaum, 2009) and demonstrates gradual 
decline throughout the day (Clow, Thorn, Evans, & Hucklebridge, 2004; Pruessner et al., 
1997; Wilhelm, Born, Kudielka, Schlotz, & Wust, 2007). This response is sensitive to a 
variety of inter-individual differences, including stress, health status, awakening time, and 
the morningness/eveningness of the individual (Bailey & Heitkemper, 2001; Brigitte M. 
Kudielka, Buchtal, Uhde, & Wust, 2007; B. M. Kudielka, Federenko, Hellhammer, & Wust, 
2006; Pruessner et al., 1997; Randler & Schaal, 2010; Wust, Federenko, Hellhammer, & 
Kirschbaum, 2000). However, despite these inter-individual differences, the CAR 
demonstrates within-individual stability (Hucklebridge, Hussain, Evans, & Clow, 2005; 
Pruessner et al., 1997; Wust et al., 2000).

In so far as the cortisol response and associated HPA axis activity is an intrinsic part of 
circadian rhythms and is associated with sleep wake activity, it is expected that in 
individuals with disturbed sleep or altered sleep-wake rhythms these mechanisms would 
demonstrate significant modulation. However, the results of the studies examining the 
relationship between the CAR and sleep efficiency have been inconsistent. Some studies 
have reported no difference between subjective measures of sleep quality and cortisol at 
awakening (Zhang et al., 2011), while others have found a relationship between sleep 
duration and sleep disturbances and morning cortisol levels (Backhaus, Junghanns, & 
Hohagen, 2004; Kumari et al., 2009). Others have reported an association between poor 
sleep and evening cortisol levels (Rodenbeck, Huether, Ruther, & Hajak, 2002; A. N. 
Vgontzas et al., 2001). The implication of these equivocal findings is that it is likely that the 
inter-individual differences and the methods of measuring cortisol (i.e., CAR, diurnal 
cortisol slope) may result in inconsistent results. Moreover, the majority of these studies 
measure sleep quality by using conventional sleep measures such as sleep efficiency, 
duration, and sleep onset latency.

Dysfunction of the HPA axis has been repeatedly implicated in PTSD (de Kloet et al., 2006; 
Drake, Roehrs, & Roth, 2003). Particularly, the suppression of the HPA axis in PTSD has 
been reported, with less variability (fewer peaks and troughs) in the diurnal cortisol cycle in 
individuals with PTSD (Yehuda, 2002). Recently, Wahbeh and Oken (2013) reported lower 
cortisol across the entire day (wake, 30 minutes after waking, and bedtime) in combat 
Veterans with PTSD compared to combat Veterans without PTSD. Patients who develop 
PTSD following exposure to trauma show a sharp increase of cortisol immediately following 
the traumatic event followed by tapering to low basal cortisol levels over the course of a few 
months into the chronic phase of PTSD (Pervanidou & Chrousos, 2010). Pervanidou and 
Chrousos (2010) have posited that the initial spike in cortisol and subsequent low basal 
cortisol state in the presence of progressive norepinephrine levels characterizes the 
development and maintenance of PTSD, respectively. In concordance with these findings, it 
has been reported that symptom severity in chronic PTSD is negatively correlated with 
cortisol levels (Olff, Guzelcan, de Vries, Assies, & Gersons, 2006). Future work is needed to 
elucidate the role of HPA response in the development and maintenance of PTSD in 
returning service members, with the possibility that HPA function might interact with TBI 
status.

Prior work has also found reduced plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—a 
neuroprotective growth factor that directly influences sleep need (Faraguna et al., 2008)—in 
PTSD patients, relative to healthy controls (Dell’Osso et al., 2009). Dysregulation of BDNF 
might adversely affect neuroplasticity, cognition, and memory in PTSD (Deppermann, 
Storchak, Fallgatter, & Ehlis, 2014; Kaplan, Vasterling, & Vedak, 2010). Chronic stress and 
cortisol elevation are linked with BDNF down-regulation in regions of the brain such as the 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Gourley, Kedves, Olausson, & Taylor, 2009) and the 
hippocampus (Rasmusson, Shi, & Duman, 2002)—regions critical in the regulation of 
physiological arousal and memory, respectively. Re-exposure to a fear-conditioned context 
reduces BDNF expression in the hippocampus, which could possibly hamper hippocampal-
based fear extinction learning (Rasmusson et al., 2002). These results demonstrate a link 
between BDNF, stress, and cognition. In regards to sleep, animal work has demonstrated

Conclusion

increased wakeful daytime exploration is associated with increased cortical BDNF 
expression and increased slow-wave activity during subsequent sleep, compared to rats 
awake for the same amount of time but not exploring (Huber, Tononi, & Cirelli, 2007). 
BDNF regulation seems to be important in the link between daytime cognition and activity 
with the normal drive for sleep. Future work is needed to disentangle the possible interaction 
between BDNF regulation, sleep drive and intensity, and cognition in PTSD.

Sleep problems are prevalent in returning Veterans with PTSD. Sleep problems pose a risk 
factor for the development and maintenance of PTSD and have substantial impact on 
psychosocial functioning and recovery from PTSD. Furthermore, impaired sleep might also 
impede upon the effectiveness of clinical treatments for PTSD, the mechanisms for which 
will be further elaborated on in the following section. Sleep neuroimaging studies have 
demonstrated regional activation differences between individuals with and without PTSD 
and have demonstrated increased limbic activity during sleep, which may serve as a marker 
for nightmares and increased arousal in PTSD that is different in patterns of arousal in 
insomnia. Results of studies investigating the possible link between HPA-axis dysfunction 
and sleep in PTSD have been largely equivocal, although the link between both PTSD and 
sleep-related HPA-axis circadian activity is well established. New evidence suggests a link 
between BDNF function, sleep, and cognition in PTSD, but this emerging line of inquiry 
remains open. Research on sleep problems in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, especially those with 
PTSD, is beginning to explore the complexity and correlates of these coexisting disorders. 
However, there is more work to be done as it is imperative that we hone sensitive sleep 
measures in order to elucidate the neural and behavioral connection between sleep 
disturbance and PTSD development and maintenance, and the impact of sleep on outcomes 
in PTSD.

Impact of poor sleep on cognition in PTSD

Individuals with PTSD often complain of memory difficulties that have been hypothesized 
to be related to hippocampal dysfunction in these individuals (Bremner, 2007). The work of 
Vasterling and colleagues (2002) supports the association between PTSD and neurocognitive 
and intellectual performance deficits, citing increased problems with learning, memory, and 
attention in Vietnam Veterans with PTSD. Other studies have similarly found that in other 
cohorts of individuals with PTSD, difficulties in attention, learning, and verbal memory are 
also present (Bremner et al., 1995; Marx, Doron-Lamarca, Proctor, & Vasterling, 2009; 
Samuelson et al., 2006; Vasterling et al., 2012; Vasterling et al., 2002). Few studies have 
examined the circumscribed relation between sleep and cognitive function in individuals 
with PTSD. The potential role of sleep disturbance on PTSD has been peripherally 
addressed previously in work examining the role of sleep in learning and emotional memory 
consolidation (Nishida, Pearsall, Buckner, & Walker, 2009; Stickgold, Hobson, Fosse, & 
Fosse, 2001; Stickgold & Walker, 2005) or by demonstrating that even short periods of sleep 
such as daytime naps can diminish impulse control (i.e., reactivity to anger and fear inducing 
stimuli (Gujar, Yoo, Hu, & Walker, 2011). Yoo, Gujar, Hu, Jolesz and Walker (2007) 
demonstrated the mechanisms for how disturbed sleep can exacerbate and maintain PTSD 
symptoms by showing that sleep deprivation can enhance negative emotional response by

disrupting connectivity between the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortices, a pathway 
that modulates emotional responsivity. However, few studies have examined specific 
components of cognitive difficulties in PTSD, including attention, executive function, and 
learning, with respect to poor sleep. One recent study by Brownlow, Brown, and Mellman 
(2014) demonstrated a relationship between sustained attention, verbal memory, and 
objectively measured sleep in PTSD. Interestingly, a full night’s sleep (approximately 7 
hours or greater) mitigated attention errors in PTSD.

Sleep problems and associated cognitive deficits may have an impact on treatment outcome 
in PTSD. Evidence-based treatments for PTSD, such as cognitive processing therapy or 
prolonged exposure treatment, have strong learning components involving attention and 
memory consolidation processes. Furthermore, extinction of conditioned fear responses, 
which is related to consolidation of emotional memories, is also an important part of 
psychotherapeutic interventions aimed at alleviating PTSD. Individuals with PTSD have 
impaired extinction of conditioned fear responses and impaired recall of the extinction 
(Blechert, Michael, Vriends, Margraf, & Wilhelm, 2007; Milad et al., 2008; S. P. Orr et al., 
2000; Wiseman-Hakes et al., 2013). Given the evidence that sleep—and particularly REM 
sleep—plays an important role in memory consolidation, including that of emotional 
memories (Bennion, Mickley Steinmetz, Kensinger, & Payne, 2013; Hu, Stylos-Allan, & 
Walker, 2006; Payne et al., 2012; U. Wagner, Gais, & Born, 2001; U Wagner, Hallschmid, 
Rasch, & Born, 2006), and that sleep promotes generalization of extinction memory (Pace-
Schott et al., 2009), it is important to consider the impact of poor sleep on treatment 
outcome in individuals with PTSD.

Overall, the impact of sleep on cognitive functioning is well studied, although due to the 
multiple etiologies of poor sleep and distinct methodologies of studying sleep, the 
conclusion of whether poor sleep has a long-term impact on cognitive function is equivocal. 
Additionally, the neurobiological mechanism behind the interaction between poor sleep and 
cognition has yet to be elucidated. However, what is clear from a multitude of studies is that 
there is an association between sleep and daytime cognition and consolidation of memories, 
particularly emotionally salient ones. Individuals impacted by PTSD are already vulnerable 
to cognitive deficits and are at high risk for poor sleep. Therefore, in individuals with PTSD, 
the additional impact of poor sleep on their everyday function coupled with the loss of 
benefits associated with restorative sleep is particularly burdensome. In addition to 
impacting their everyday function, poor sleep may also have a negative effect on 
psychotherapeutic treatment in those with PTSD.

Conclusion

Management and Treatment of Sleep Problems

Pharmacologic treatments—A thorough review of the pharmacologic treatments of 
sleep problems is beyond the scope of this paper and was recently reviewed by Richey and 
Krystal (2011). Briefly, the current first line of pharmacologic treatment for insomnia are the 
benzodiazepine-receptor agonists medications: zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone. The 
main advantage of these medications over the traditional benzodiazepine drugs is their 
relatively shorter duration, fewer side effects, and low abuse potential (Richey & Krystal,

2011). However, despite the general improvement in efficacy these medications are not 
consistently effective and have significant side effects including headaches, anxiety, and 
sleepiness (Krystal, Erman, Zammit, Soubrane, & Roth, 2008). For example, the most 
common prescribed of these, zolpidem, has not demonstrated consistent effectiveness in 
sleep maintenance, but is generally helpful in sleep initiation (Rosenberg, 2006). Other 
pharmacologic treatments for insomnia have included tricyclic antidepressants as well as 
serotonergic agents such as trazodone, but most medications have not been thoroughly 
investigated in randomized controlled trials and can have significant side effects.

Prazosin is an alpha-1 antagonist that has been used pharmacologically to treat PTSD-
related sleep disturbances and nightmares. Prazosin’s mechanism of action has been 
stipulated to be the attenuation of noradrenergic function during REM sleep, thereby 
reducing nightmares and related complaints of insomnia (Raskind et al., 2003; Ross, Gresch, 
Ball, Sanford, & Morrison, 1995). Studies have shown that prazosin-related improvement in 
sleep is accompanied by improvements in other daytime symptoms of PTSD (Boynton, 
Bentley, Strachan, Barbato, & Raskind, 2009; Germain et al., 2012; Raskind et al., 2007; 
Raskind et al., 2003; Raskind et al., 2002; Taylor & Raskind, 2002). A recent randomized 
control trial of prazosin in returning Veterans with PTSD showed favorable results with 
reported improvements in nightmares, overall sleep quality, global function, and PTSD 
symptoms (Raskind et al., 2013). However, substantial residual symptoms remained, 
suggesting that adjunct treatment was needed.

In addition to prescription medication, over-the-counter pharmacologic sleep enhancers 
include melatonin, which is a naturally occurring hormone that is endogenously produced by 
the pineal gland and is important in regulation of circadian rhythms by initiating the 
feedback circuitry of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Melatonin has been explored as a 
hypnotic, but a number of randomized trials have failed to find evidence of efficacy (Richey 
& Krystal, 2011). Overall, although short-term effects of pharmacotherapy on sleep 
problems and particularly insomnia are well documented, the long-term benefits are 
unknown, and long-term use may be associated with multiple adverse effects (Gillin & 
Byerley, 1990). Some have suggested that pharmacologic sleep agents may negatively 
impact neural recovery/neuroplasticity in patients recovering from TBI (Larson & Zollman, 
2010). Moreover, it has been recently suggested that biological treatments might be the most 
efficacious for short sleep duration insomnia, while insomnia with normal sleep duration 
might respond better to psychological treatment (A. Vgontzas & Fernandez-Mendoza, 
2013). While some antidepressants prescribed for PTSD might activate BDNF pathways, 
further research is needed to develop agents that selectively target BDNF function, which 
have the potential to alleviate cognitive and sleep symptoms in PTSD and TBI (Kaplan et 
al., 2010). More clinical studies are necessary to understand the efficacy of BDNF-
enhancing interventions, such as exercise, and combined pharmacological-behavioral 
approaches (Chen, Ivy, & Russo-Neustadt, 2006; Kaplan et al., 2010).

Non-pharmacologic treatments—The treatment and management of sleep disturbance 
has primarily utilized pharmacologic approaches that have the potential for side effects and, 
in some medications, development of tolerance over time. As sleep disturbances occur for a 
variety of reasons, including mood difficulties, behavioral factors such as poor stimulus

control, aging-related changes, pain, and other medical conditions, effective and consistent 
pharmacologic treatment has been difficult to achieve. There is also a growing body of 
evidence for effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive and 
behavioral treatments, for sleep disturbance in PTSD (Schoenfeld et al., 2012). Given the 
complexity and multitude of underlying psychological factors that commonly accompany 
sleep disturbance (Espie et al., 2012), including behavioral intervention in the treatment plan 
may be beneficial for patients with comorbid PTSD and mTBI (polytrauma for the Veteran 
population). The current practice guidelines developed by the Standards of Practice 
Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend using psychological 
and behavioral interventions for the treatment of chronic primary insomnia (Standard) and 
secondary insomnia (Guideline) (Morgenthaler et al., 2007). As of 2012, no guidelines 
specific to treatment of sleep disorders following mTBI have been established (Marshall et 
al., 2012). Recommendations for sleep disorders have been adopted from current practice 
guidelines outside of the TBI field. Practice guidelines for incorporation of sleep 
interventions into management of PTSD are yet to be established (Germain et al., 2013), 
however, the PTSD algorithm of the Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard 
South Shore Program has proposed treatment guidelines outlining that sleep evaluation and 
treatment should be the first step in assessing and treating PTSD (Bajor, Ticlea, & Osser, 
2011).

In terms of non-pharmacologic treatments, psychotherapeutic interventions for insomnia 
have gained momentum in the recent years with the increase of evidence for their efficacy. 
Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) is a psychotherapeutic treatment that 
has shown efficacy in treating poor sleep particularly in insomnia (Edinger, Wohlgemuth, 
Radtke, Marsh, & Quillian, 2001; Galuszko-Węgielnik, Jakuszkowiak-Wojten, Wiglusz, 
Cubala, & Landowski, 2012; Morin et al., 2006) by targeting maladaptive thoughts and 
behaviors associated with maintaining the cycle of poor sleep. Specifically, the goal of CBT-
I is to target factors that maintain insomnia over time including sleep-related anxiety, 
maladaptive or sleep-interfering behaviors, and the resultant dysregulated sleep drive 
(Mitchell, Gehrman, Perlis, & Umscheid, 2012). CBT-I uses stimulus control, sleep 
restriction, and cognitive restructuring to change sleep-related behaviors and thoughts that 
maintain poor sleep. The treatment is usually administered over the course of 4–8 sessions, 
with significant improvements often around sessions 3 or 4 (Edinger & Means, 2005; 
Mitchell et al., 2012). Overall, randomized control trials have found that CBT-I has medium 
to large effects in reducing insomnia, in comparison to placebo treatments such as wait-list 
and sleep hygiene programs, that are maintained post-treatment (Sanchez-Ortuno & Edinger, 
2012), but unstandardized treatment adherence across protocols complicate the evaluation of 
CBT-I treatment outcome (Matthews, Arnedt, McCarthy, Cuddihy, & Aloia, 2013). 
Recently, the favorable efficacy of CBT-I in Veterans and implementation feasibility by VA 
providers has already been reported (Karlin, Trockel, Taylor, Gimeno, & Manber, 2013). In 
comparison to pharmacologic treatments trials compared CBT-I to zopiclone, zolpidem, 
temazepam, and triazolam and overall, found that CBT-I is at least as effective in treating 
insomnia when compared to these medications (Mitchell et al., 2012). Furthermore, CBT-I 
efficacy is likely more durable than that of medication (Mitchell et al., 2012).

In the Veteran population, CBT-I has been used to treat PTSD-related sleep disturbances. In 
a multi-component treatment study, those with PTSD demonstrated post-treatment 
improvements in their sleep onset latency, awakenings, sleep efficiency, and self-reported 
sleep quality in response to CBT-I (Ulmer, Edinger, & Calhoun, 2011). However, the nature 
of the sleep disturbances in individuals with PTSD is substantially different than those 
experienced by other individuals with sleep problems (see the PTSD and sleep section) and 
consequently some investigators have aimed at tailoring sleep treatments to sleep 
disturbances experienced by those with PTSD.

Imagery rehearsal therapies (IRT) are aimed at modulating post-traumatic nightmares by 
decreasing their frequency and severity through “rescripting” of nightmare content (Kellner, 
Neidhardt, Krakow, & Pathak, 1992; Kellner, Singh, & Irigoyen-Rascon, 1991) and were 
first shown to be an effective treatment for nightmares in individuals with PTSD by Krakow 
and colleagues (2001). There are several different protocols for imagery rehearsal in the 
PTSD population including Exposure, Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy (Davis & 
Wright, 2006), Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (Krakow & Zadra, 2006), and Imagery Rehearsal 
and Exposure Therapy (Long et al., 2011). Regardless of specific protocol, the main 
components of each of these treatments are similar and include: psychoeducation, narratives 
about selected nightmares, and imaginal rehearsal of new dreams, as well as some forms of 
exposure to the selected nightmares. Over the years, empirical evidence for the efficacy of 
IRT has been growing and has been shown to reduce nightmare frequency in US Army 
Veterans (Moore & Krakow, 2007) and female sexual assault victims (Krakow et al., 2001). 
A recent meta-analysis confirmed that IRT reduces nightmare frequency and improves sleep 
quality in a variety of trauma-related study samples and protocols (Casement & Swanson, 
2012). On the contrary, the largest study to date, conducted in Vietnam era Veterans did not 
find IRT to be effective, compared to an active control condition (Cook et al., 2010) 
therefore, the efficacy of IRT in Veterans with PTSD is still not fully determined. Further, a 
recent review of the current evidence base for IRT in PTSD revealed a lack of higher-level 
study designs and methodological inconsistencies across treatment protocols, none of which 
have been compared directly (Harb et al., 2013). These studies highlight the limited data 
supporting the efficacy of IRT for the treatment of PTSD.

Others have combined IRT and CBT-I treatments or components of each of these cognitive 
behavioral therapies in order to target both the PTSD-related nightmares as well as the 
general sleep dysregulation that is especially prevalent in the Veteran population. Studies of 
combined treatment have varied from group treatments to individual therapies and have 
found significant effect sizes in improvement of nightmares, sleep quality, and PTSD 
symptoms (Davis & Wright, 2006; Germain, Shear, Hall, & Buysse, 2007; Krakow et al., 
2001; Nappi et al., 2012; Ulmer et al., 2011). Overall, these studies demonstrate a greater 
improvement in overall sleep quality than IRT alone (Casement & Swanson, 2012). 
Furthermore, at least one study comparing a behavioral intervention for sleep and 
nightmares found that the behavioral treatment was comparable to prazosin in reducing 
insomnia severity and PTSD-related daytime symptoms in Veterans with PTSD (Germain et 
al., 2012). Another recent study reported improved subjectively and objectively measured 
sleep and a reduction in PTSD symptom severity and PTSD-related nighttime symptoms in 
OEF/OIF/OND combat Veterans with PTSD following 4 sessions of combined CBI-I/IRT,

compared to a waitlist control group (Margolies, Rybarczyk, Vrana, Leszczyszyn, & Lynch, 
2013). A recent case report described that treatment of insomnia in a Veteran patient with 
CBT-I improved sleep and facilitated entry into exposure therapy for PTSD (Baddeley & 
Gros, 2013). The preliminary results of this case study also highlight the importance of 
investigating the most efficacious order of evidence-based psychotherapies, particularly in 
comorbid insomnia and PTSD.

Conclusion

Treatment of sleep disorders has relied on pharmacologic management for many years. More 
recently other methods of treating sleep disorders have gained attention, particularly with 
sleep problems gaining recognition for their prevalence and the long-term efficacy and side 
effects of pharmacologic agents remaining in question. Behavioral treatments of insomnia 
are promising, particularly for individuals with insomnia related to mood and anxiety 
disorders including individuals with PTSD. For Veterans returning from the OEF/OIF/OND 
arenas, sleep problems are especially prevalent and are often co-occurring with both PTSD 
and mTBI (Wallace et al., 2011). These young Veterans are particularly encumbered by the 
mood, cognitive, and health difficulties that are associated with PTSD and without the 
additional burden of sleep problems. Behavioral treatments of PTSD do not address sleep as 
a primary target, yet sleep difficulties may be an important barrier for good treatment 
outcome (Nappi et al., 2012). This area of research is currently lacking in the literature, 
particularly as it pertains to PTSD.

SLEEP DISTURBANCES FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

Sleep and circadian disturbances in TBI

Daytime sleepiness and nighttime sleep disturbance are common following TBI (Baumann, 
2012). Common post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances (SWDs) include; poor nocturnal 
sleep quality, hypersomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired daytime vigilance, and 
circadian rhythm phase shift (Ayalon et al., 2007; Baumann, 2012; Baumann, Werth, 
Stocker, Ludwig, & Bassetti, 2007; Kempf, Werth, Kaiser, Bassetti, & Baumann, 2010; 
Ponsford, Parcell, Sinclair, Roper, & Rajaratnam, 2013). Objective sleep studies have shown 
that patients with TBI exhibit reduced sleep efficiency, increased wakefulness after sleep 
onset, increased sleep onset latency, alterations in sleep architecture (less REM sleep, more 
time in “light” NREM sleep), and report more frequent insomnia (Baumann et al., 2007; 
Collen, Orr, Lettieri, Carter, & Holley, 2012; Mathias & Alvaro, 2012; Ponsford et al., 2012; 
Shekleton et al., 2010). Reports have shown that 25–81% of post-acute TBI patients suffer 
protracted or even permanent SWDs or other sleep disturbances (Mathias & Alvaro, 2012), 
regardless of localization, severity of, or time since, the TBI (Baumann et al., 2007; 
Castriotta et al., 2007; Kempf et al., 2010). Not only is the prevalence of sleep problems in 
TBI patients significantly higher than in the general population (Mathias & Alvaro, 2012), 
these sleep problems are chronic and have been shown to persist at 6 months and up to 5 
years post-injury (Beetar et al., 1996; Fogelberg, Hoffman, Dikmen, Temkin, & Bell, 2012; 
Kaufman et al., 2001; Kempf et al., 2010; Masson et al., 1996; Stulemeijer et al., 2006; 
Tham et al., 2012; Watson, Dikmen, Machamer, Doherty, & Temkin, 2007).

There is a lack of understanding regarding the temporal relationship between primary brain 
injury and the subsequent emergence and maintenance of SWDs. SWDs are common during 
the acute TBI phase, as evidenced by objectively and subjectively measured hypersomnia 
and reduced sleep efficiency (Chiu, Lo, Chiang, & Tsai, 2014) and can persist up to 5 years 
post-injury (Masson et al., 1996). However, many of the long-term follow-up studies are 
based on subjective sleep measures, thus, it is possible that protracted sleep complaints are 
related to sleep state misperceptions following the initial experience of objective sleep 
problems (Orff, Ayalon, & Drummond, 2009). Prior work has also demonstrated that the 
spectrum of mild to severe TBI patients is affected by objectively measured chronic SWDs 
(Verma, Anand, & Verma, 2007). The type of brain injury (e.g., diffuse, focal) might 
influence the type and severity of SWD (Orff et al., 2009). Recent animal work has shown 
hypersomnia during the first week following induction of diffuse TBI, however post-
traumatic hypersomnia did not develop into chronic sleep disturbance (Rowe, Harrison, 
O’Hara, & Lifshitz, 2014). These data suggest that hypersomnia following diffuse TBI (e.g., 
blast exposure) does not necessarily develop into persistent sleep problems. A recent study 
by Ponsford and colleagues (2013) demonstrated that poor sleep quality and daytime 
sleepiness increases with time since injury in older TBI patients relative to younger TBI 
patients, suggesting an interaction between sleep disturbances, aging, and time since injury 
in TBI. These findings highlight the importance of considering the course of sleep 
disturbances in TBI in Veterans across the life span as Veterans age. Future work is needed 
to understand the relationship between injury severity and type and the development and 
persistence of SWDs.

A recent meta-analysis using data from 21 studies (n=1706) examined twenty-one years of 
TBI and sleep literature (1990–2011) (Mathias & Alvaro, 2012). The group reported that in 
studies that used objective sleep measures in conjunction with formal diagnostic criteria; the 
prevalence of sleep disturbances was 53%. Compared to the prevalence reported in the 
general population, the TBI group was found to be significantly more likely to experience 
sleep disturbances and was more than 12 times more likely to have diagnosed sleep 
disorders. The authors also reported several challenges to the clinical utility of these studies 
due to differences in criteria, which may explain the wide range of sleep disturbance 
incidences described in the literature. In similar vein, a survey by the Armed Forces Health 
Surveillance System found that sleep disorders were among the most common sequelae 
following TBI in the active duty Armed Forces service members between the years 2000–
2012 (AFHSC, 2013). Farrell-Carnahan, Franke, Graham, and McNamee (2013) recently 
found that in a sample of 114 returning Veterans with blast-induced mild traumatic brain 
injury, 77% reported subjective sleep difficulties. The foregoing findings highlight the need 
for standardized criteria and sleep measures to allow for more meaningful comparisons 
across studies and more powerful meta-analytic reviews.

It is the general consensus in the literature that SWDs can be considered primary to TBI and 
are not solely attributable to secondary physical or psychological symptoms (Beetar et al., 
1996; Clinchot, Bogner, Mysiw, Fugate, & Corrigan, 1998; Fichtenberg, Millis, Mann, 
Zafonte, & Millard, 2000; Ouellet, Beaulieu-Bonneau, & Morin, 2006; Ponsford et al., 2012; 
Tham et al., 2012). The most comprehensive of these studies was conducted in 2007 by 
Baumann and colleagues, who investigated the risk factors and biomarkers for posttraumatic

SWDs at 6 months post injury by obtaining neuropsychiatric and lab data, computerized 
tomography, sleep latency tests, PSG, and ACT from 65 patients with TBI at 4 days and 6 
months post injury (Baumann et al., 2007). New onset SWDs were found in 72% of the 
patients and 60% of those patients had a SWD that could not be attributed to any specific 
cause (e.g., restless leg syndrome, OSA, behaviorally induced insufficiency sleep syndrome, 
depression) other than the TBI itself (Baumann et al., 2007). The cumulative impact of 
multiple brain injuries may also increase the severity of sleep disturbances. For example, 
Bryan (2013) reported that, compared to a single TBI and no TBI, multiple TBIs were 
associated with an increased risk for and severity of sleep difficulties in male service 
members in Iraq. Together, these findings suggest the effect of TBI on SWDs is cumulative 
and potentially causal.

Mild TBI patients, who comprise 70–90% of the treated TBI population (Cassidy et al., 
2004), have been shown to have a higher rate of SWDs than those patients with more severe 
head injuries (Mahmood, Rapport, Hanks, & Fichtenberg, 2004; Orff et al., 2009; Ouellet et 
al., 2006; Parcell, Ponsford, Rajaratnam, & Redman, 2006). While TBI patients are 
generally susceptible to SWDs regardless of the severity of the head injury, one longitudinal 
study suggested that those with mild injuries are more likely to report symptoms of insomnia 
whereas those with more severe injuries are more susceptible to hypersomnia (Masson et al., 
1996). Parcell, Ponsford, Rajaratnam, & Redman (2006) collected sleep diary data and 
found that individuals with TBI reported more nighttime awakenings, longer sleep onset 
latency, lighter (fragmented) sleep, and a change in bedtime (either earlier or later) 
compared to their pre-injury levels. This study also reported that those patients with milder 
brain injuries, amongst a mixed severity control sample, reported more nighttime 
awakenings. While some studies (Mahmood et al., 2004; Parcell et al., 2006) have found 
subjective sleep quality to be more severely impaired in mTBI compared to severe TBI, a 
recent study by Ponsford and colleagues (2013) did not replicate these findings. The authors 
suggest their findings might be explained by the fact that their mTBI group did not have 
higher anxiety or depression compared to the moderate and severe TBI group, suggesting the 
role of psychiatric symptoms contributing to increased sleep disturbance in mTBI. It is 
important to note that inconsistencies in the literature regarding the prevalence and severity 
of sleep disturbances across the TBI spectra, as in PTSD, may also reflect sleep state 
misperceptions (for a review see Orff et al., 2009).

In mTBI there is also evidence, albeit inconclusive, of circadian rhythm sleep disorders 
(CRSDs) (for a review see Orff et al., 2009). Ayalon and colleagues (2007) utilized PSG, 
ACT, temperature and melatonin data, as well as morningness/eveningness to measure the 
prevalence of CRSDs in 42 mTBI patients with complaints of insomnia. The authors 
reported a significantly higher incidence of CRSDs in the mTBI sample when compared to 
the prevalence amongst people attending sleep clinics with complaints of insomnia (36% vs 
10%). Based on ACT data, 8 of the patients exhibited delayed sleep phase syndrome and 7 
exhibited an irregular sleep-wake pattern. True to the clinical definitions, when compared to 
normative sleep-wake times, the data showed that the delayed sleep phase patients 
experienced delayed sleep onset (Mean = 2:33 am, Standard deviation = 76 mins) and offset 
times (Mean=11:57 am, Standard deviation =127 mins) while irregular sleep-wake pattern 
patients classically exhibited a disorganized and variable sleep and wakefulness episodes

(day-to-day onset and offset variability > 2 hours). The incidences of delayed and irregular 
sleep phase were nearly equal in the mTBI sample, whereas amongst CRSD patients in sleep 
clinics rates are typically 85% and 2%, respectively (Dagan & Eisenstein, 1999). However, 
the authors note that patients with advanced or delayed sleep phase can exhibit normal sleep 
durations if allowed to choose their sleep schedule, which might mean that circadian shift 
disorders can go undetected if only sleep duration-related variables are examined out of the 
context of sleep pattern. While Ayalon and colleagues (2007) detected a significantly higher 
incidence of CRSDs and distinct temperature and melatonin profiles amongst the mTBI 
sample, Steele, Rajaratnam, Redman, and Ponsford (2005) reported no difference in sleep 
timing or melatonin onset in a sample of 10 TBI patients when compared to age and gender 
matched controls. However, the discrepant results between these two studies might be due to 
the fact that the majority of those from the latter study presented with moderate TBI. 
Moreover, anecdotally, one earlier case study published by Quinto, Gellido, Chokroverty and 
Masdeu (2000) describes the presence of new-onset delayed sleep phase syndrome at 4 years 
post mTBI. Despite a limited number of studies, these findings highlight the possibility of 
CRSDs following TBI.

While many TBI patients experience sleep disturbance, others report wake-related 
complaints such as fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, and hypersomnia (Baumann et al., 
2007). Schreiber and colleagues (2008) reported increased daytime tiredness and a tendency 
to fall asleep during the day in a group of 26 mTBI patients compared to healthy matched 
controls. Kempf and colleagues (2010) followed a cohort of mixed severity TBI patients and 
reported that 67% of the patients who had endorsed sleep disturbances at 6 month post-
injury continued to experience excessive daytime sleepiness, hypersomnia, fatigue, and 
decreased vigilance at 3 years post-injury. In fact, fatigue and hypersomnia increased at 3 
years post injury and persisted up to 5 years post-injury (Bushnik, Englander, & Wright, 
2008; Kempf et al., 2010). It has been reported that 20–33% of mTBI patients reported 
increased levels of fatigue compared to pre-injury levels (Englander, Hall, Stimpson, & 
Chaffin, 1992; Middleboe, Andersen, Birket-Smith, & Friis, 1992; Stulemeijer et al., 2006). 
It is not clear if wake-related complaints are the result of nocturnal sleep disturbance or a 
direct result of neuronal injury.

Recent works suggests biomarkers, such as relative cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, are 
potentially sensitive measures of sleep and wake anomalies in TBI. Stocker and colleagues 
(2014) used [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to compare glucose 
metabolism during wakefulness, REM sleep, and NREM sleep in Veterans with a history of 
blast exposure without current concussive symptoms, relative to Veterans without a history 
of blast exposure. After controlling for PTSD symptoms, results revealed hypometabolism in 
limbic regions and visual cortices during wake and REM sleep in blast-exposed Veterans, 
despite similar PSG profiles and PSQI scores as the non-blast exposed group. Such findings 
suggest that there might be metabolic dysregulation during REM sleep and wake indicative 
of functional impairments in chronic blast-induced TBI—beyond stress or sleep symptoms
—that would otherwise go undetected using standard sleep measures.

Conclusion

Page 20

There are numerous possible refractory and protracted sleep disturbances in TBI, including 
hyposomnia, hypersomnia, and circadian dysrhythmia. Prior work has established a direct 
association between disturbed sleep and TBI beyond co-occurring psychological symptoms 
(Baumann et al., 2007). The mTBI population, which accounts for the majority of the TBI 
population, might be most affected by the sleep disturbances, compared to moderate and 
severe TBI. It is unclear how sleep disturbance severity interacts with the type and severity 
of brain injury as well as time post-injury. Further, the effects of head injury on sleep 
disturbance are cumulative, which is particularly problematic for returning Veterans with 
repetitive blast-induced mTBI. However, as in the PTSD literature, the inconsistent reports 
of the prevalence of SWDs in TBI might arise from sleep discrepancies between objective 
and subjectively measured sleep in TBI, suggesting sleep state misperceptions. More 
research is necessary to understand how objective and subjective measures can best 
characterize the incidence and persistence of SWDs across the spectrum of TBI severity. 
Further longitudinal studies and meta-analytic reviews with standardized sleep measurement 
criterion are also needed to delineate the complex temporal relationship between TBI and 
SWDs.

Pathophysiology of mTBI and relation to sleep

The prevalence of both sleep and arousal related complaints following TBI appear to be 
directly attributable to damage to sleep-regulation centers and arousal networks in the brain. 
Although these networks are mutually inhibitory, they are nonetheless distinct and it is 
important to investigate sleep and arousal related dysfunction both together and separately in 
the context of brain injury. In order to parse apart the factors underlying the complex 
relationship between sleep and TBI we briefly review the pathophysiology of mTBI in 
relation to sleep and arousal networks.

There are two types of traumatic brain damage; primary and secondary. Primary traumatic 
brain injury occurs at the moment of physical trauma and refers to the immediate 
mechanical load on the brain during rapid acceleration, deceleration, direct impact, 
penetration, and/or blast wave (Maas, Stocchetti, & Bullock, 2008). Primary damage affects 
the brain on both the tissue and cellular levels. Diffuse axonal injury, the most common form 
of primary tissue injury, results from rapid rotational acceleration of the brain that causes 
dynamic shearing of white matter tracts as well as tensile and compression strain (Johnson, 
Stewart, & Smith, 2013; Kan, Ling, & Lu, 2012). Other types of primary damage can 
include focal contusions, hematomas, and edema (Kan et al., 2012). Diffuse axonal injury is 
also of particular interest as it is common across the TBI severity spectrum (Johnson et al., 
2013).

Following the impact of the trauma, primary injures can induce a cascade of secondary 
complications, which are associated with a myriad of biochemical processes including 
excitotoxicity, inflammation, free radical generation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, 
hyperglycolysis, hyperglycemia, gene activation, neurotransmitter release, and calcium 
mediated damage (Johnson et al., 2013; Kan et al., 2012). Secondary damage can induce 
dysfunction at the mitochondrial level (Johnson et al., 2013; Kan et al., 2012; Maas et al.,

2008). While the frontal lobes are the most susceptible to TBI-related injury (Dombovy, 
2011; Marquez de la Plata et al., 2011), cortico-spinal strain and shear can inflict injury 
upon more distant, subcortical brain regions (Baumann, 2012). One of the most commonly 
affected areas following a TBI is the corpus callosum (Morey et al., 2013). Some have 
speculated that damage to the callosal fibers, which may aid in synchronization of 
interhemispheric connectivity during REM and NREM sleep (Bertini et al., 2004; 
Buchmann et al., 2011; Nielsen, Montplaisir, & Lassonde, 1992) and regulate the 
modulation of timing of REM sleep (Nielsen et al., 1992), contributes to disrupted sleep-
wake processes.

Sleep promoting regions of the brain are still under investigation, however, the preoptic area 
including the ventrolateral (VLPO) and median (MNPO) preoptic areas have been shown to 
contain sleep-promoting neurons (Gong et al., 2004; D. McGinty et al., 2004; Sherin, 
Shiromani, McCarley, & Saper, 1996). The neurons in these regions are active during 
(NREM) sleep and are inactive during wakefulness (Suntsova, Szymusiak, Alam, Guzman-
Marin, & McGinty, 2002; Szymusiak, Alam, Steininger, & McGinty, 1998; Takahashi, Lin, 
& Sakai, 2009). Lesion studies of the VLPO and MNPO have demonstrated a marked 
reduction in overall quantity and quality of sleep (Lu, Greco, Shiromani, & Saper, 2000; D. 
J. McGinty & Sterman, 1968). The VLPO and MNPO are thought to promote sleep by 
inhibiting arousal regions during sleep. Their nuclei release the inhibitory neurotransmitter 
gamma-aminobutyruc acid and the inhibitory neuropeptide galanin and innervate brain areas 
that function in arousal including the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, and the hypothalamic 
orexin/hypocretin neurons (Gaus, Strecker, Tate, Parker, & Saper, 2002; Saper, Fuller, 
Pedersen, Lu, & Scammell, 2010; Saper, Scammell, & Lu, 2005; Sherin, Elmquist, 
Torrealba, & Saper, 1998). This inhibitory interaction functions similarly to a flip-flop 
switch (Saper et al., 2001), by which a transition from wakefulness to sleep and vice versa is 
produced when the system is pushed into one direction or the other. However with neuronal 
loss or damage on either side of the switch, the result may be less stability in the inhibitory 
mechanisms of the switch, thus resulting in more transitions between sleep and wakefulness 
(i.e., frequent awakenings) (Chou et al., 2003). For example, some have suggested that age-
related cell loss in the VLPO results in sleep fragmentation and increased daytime sleepiness 
due to weakening of the flip-flop switch (Saper, Cano, & Scammell, 2005).

It has been postulated that fatigue-related symptoms following TBI might have specific 
neurobiological underpinnings (Belmont, Agar, Hugeron, Gallais, & Azouvi, 2006). The 
wake promoting neurotransmitter hypocretin (orexin) is produced by a distinct set of 
neurons in the posterior hypothalamus (Baumann, 2012) and plays a crucial role in 
sustaining arousal, and preventing flip-flop between sleep-wake transition states (Saper, 
Scammell, et al., 2005) and fatigue-related symptoms following TBI may be due to damage 
to the system sustaining arousal via the “flip-flop” switch (Belmont et al., 2006). Low 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin (orexin) has been reported in patients following TBI 
(Baumann et al., 2009; Baumann et al., 2005). While hypocretin (orexin) levels recovered in 
some patients at 6 months post-TBI, some patients showed only a partial recovery. 
Moreover, the reported low levels of CSF hypocretin at 6 months post injury were associated 
with excessive daytime sleepiness (Baumann et al., 2007).

Conclusion

As mentioned earlier, a growing body of evidence suggests dysregulation of BDNF in TBI 
and PTSD (for a review see Kaplan et al., 2010). There is evidence that upregulation of 
BDNF reduces the impact of secondary injury following TBI (Kaplan et al., 2010). 
However, there might be decreases in BDNF with increased time since injury, resulting from 
tissue loss over the first year post-injury (Schober, Block, Requena, Hale, & Lane, 2012). 
Previous work suggests a causal link between BDNF expression during wakefulness and 
subsequent slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep (Faraguna et al., 2008). SWA is a 
sensitive marker for sleep need and NREM sleep intensity, as evidenced by increased SWA 
following prolonged daytime activity (Faraguna et al., 2008). Further, exogenous application 
of BDNF to one hemisphere in awake rats is associated with increased SWA during NREM 
in sleep the BDNF-injected hemisphere relative to the contralateral hemisphere and vehicle 
injection group (Faraguna et al., 2008). Given the foregoing findings, it is possible that 
downregulation of BDNF in chronic TBI or PTSD (or an interaction of the two) could 
decrease NREM sleep intensity and/or drive for sleep initiation.

Despite a multitude of secondary complications associated with TBI, it appears that SWDs 
may be linked to the neuronal injury itself, while psychiatric co-morbidities such as 
depression may serve as additional risk factors for post-traumatic SWDs (Baumann et al., 
2007; Kempf et al., 2010). Incongruent findings between studies and wide ranges of SWD 
incidences reported in the literature may be due to heterogeneous methodologies including 
variability of: measures and methods used to obtain the data, sample size, and proportion of 
TBI severity groups within mixed samples (Baumann et al., 2007). Inconsistent findings and 
reported discrepancies in prevalence of mild and severe TBI, particularly by studies using 
subjective (self-report) sleep measures, may also be due to varying levels of anxiety, 
depression, or patient’s self-insight, as patients with mTBI may have increased awareness of 
post-injury health complications and may be more likely to report sleep disturbance as an 
injury-related problem (Tham et al., 2012). Moreover, studies that collapse data from the 
mixed severity samples may lack sensitivity to detect the differences in sleep disturbance 
presentation between mild, moderate, and severe TBI. Finally, mixed findings of sleep 
disturbances in TBI may reflect the differential neuronal injury profiles resulting from 
variable sources of insult (i.e., blast, motor vehicle accident, etc). Overall, research suggests 
that sleep and arousal deficits are clearly present in individuals with TBI regardless of 
severity, and there are likely neurobiological underpinnings to these difficulties that need to 
be investigated further in order to elucidate the mechanism of recovery and to improve 
outcomes in TBI.

Impact of sleep on cognition in TBI

In individuals with TBI, cognitive deficits are among the most frequently reported symptoms 
regardless of severity of the injury (Senathi-Raja, Ponsford, & Schonberger, 2010; Heidi 
Terrio, Nelson, Betthauser, Harwood, & Brenner, 2011). In mTBI, decrements in 
performance are found in processing speed, working memory, attention, memory, and 
executive functioning immediately post-injury (Frencham, Fox, & Maybery, 2005), but 
problems often decrease with time after injury (Brenner et al., 2010). Despite the evidence 
that performance on cognitive measures improves over time after mTBI, subjective

complaints remain (Senathi-Raja et al., 2010; Heidi Terrio et al., 2009) raising the possibility 
that traditionally used objective measures may not be able to capture the subtle difficulties 
experienced by individuals with mTBI (Brenner, 2011). Additionally, it has been postulated 
that although cognitive performance among individuals with mTBI may not be substantially 
different than those without TBI, they may require more functional resources to complete 
tasks, such as requiring larger areas of their cortex for task completion (Van Boven et al., 
2009).

Sleep difficulties in those with mTBI may further impact their cognitive functioning and 
may contribute to the variability in cognitive performance, which may also explain the 
reported discrepancies in the literature discussed earlier in this review. Individuals with TBI 
are particularly vulnerable to sleep difficulties, and some evidence suggests that those with 
mTBI may be at even greater risk for sleep disturbances compared to more severe TBI, due 
to greater self-insight and therefore may present with increased vulnerability to sleep deficits 
associated with psychological and emotional factors (Bloomfield, Espie, & Evans, 2010). 
Indeed, at least one study examining whether sleep difficulties exacerbate deficits in 
sustained attention following TBI found that when individuals with TBI were separated into 
good and poor sleepers, based on both subjective and objective measures of sleep, poor 
sleepers performed significantly worse on measures of sustained attention (Bloomfield et al., 
2010). A large proportion of individuals coming from the OEF/OIF/OND combat arenas 
present with both PTSD and mTBI and approximately 40% of PTSD-mTBI Veterans report 
severe sleep disturbances (Wallace et al., 2011) as well as cognitive problems (Schiehser et 
al., 2011; Spencer, Drag, Walker, & Bieliauskas, 2010). Therefore, the examination of the 
relation between their cognitive difficulties and sleep problems is particularly important. 
Kark and colleagues (2013) examined the relationship between sleep, PTSD symptom 
severity, daily cognition, and quality of life in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with exposure to 
blast and current cognitive complaints. Veterans with PTSD had worse sleep on both 
subjective and objective measures of sleep quality and poor sleep was related to worse self-
reported daily cognition, poorer community integration, and reduced satisfaction with life.

Cognitive deficits, namely attention, concentration, and executive dysfunction, are the 
primary complaints of individuals with TBI. There is evidence that these deficits may be 
exacerbated by poor sleep, however few studies have examined the association between poor 
sleep following TBI and cognition. It is also unclear how severity, type, and number of brain 
injuries might contribute to objective and subjective cognitive impairments differently. 
Future work is needed to not only understand how poor sleep perpetuates poor cognition, but 
also how cognitive impairment might effect sleep (e.g., elevated stress related to adverse 
functional consequences of executive dysfunction).

Conclusion

Sleep interventions in TBI

Studies of pharmacologic treatment in TBI have mostly focused on treatment of fatigue and 
daytime somnolence associated with moderate to severe TBI. One study examined 
individualized treatment of patients with TBI that involved either pharmacologic or 
behavioral treatment and found that effective treatment optimized recovery and outcomes for

adults with chronic TBI. Notably, the authors did not specify the modality of treatments used 
(Wiseman-Hakes et al., 2013).

There is a paucity of studies examining the efficacy of treatments aimed at alleviating sleep 
difficulties and fatigue in individuals with TBI. One single-case experimental design study 
found that CBT-I reduced nocturnal sleep difficulties in one individual with TBI (Ouellet & 
Morin, 2007). A recent study examining the impact of sleep interventions in a small group 
of moderate to severe TBI (n=10) and 2 mTBI patients, found that individualized sleep 
interventions that included sleep hygiene recommendations, pharmacological interventions 
and/or treatments for sleep apnea, was associated with improvements in insomnia severity, 
depression symptoms, speed of cognitive processing, and language functions (Wiseman-
Hakes et al., 2013). As with other individuals with sleep difficulties, long term use of 
pharmacologic agents for sleep is not generally recommended and is particularly not 
recommended for individuals with TBI due to side effects such as impaired daytime 
alertness and cognitive function that could prove an additional burden (Flanagan, 
Greenwald, & Wieber, 2007; Larson & Zollman, 2010). Further careful consideration is 
required for treatment of sleep in comorbid TBI and PTSD, since some traditionally 
prescribed PTSD medications may further exacerbate the TBI- and/or treatment-related 
cognitive problems. One study examined the effect of melatonin on sleep and daytime 
alertness in comparison to amitriptyline. This study found no improvement in sleep quality 
with either treatment, but found that melatonin had a greater effect on daytime alertness than 
amitriptyline (Kemp, Biswas, Neumann, & Coughlan, 2004). Another study recently 
reported that relaxation treatment in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with mTBI was an acceptable 
milieu by both patient and provider, although the Veterans preferred a combination of 
relaxation and pharmacologic treatment (Epstein, Babcock-Parziale, Haynes, & Herb, 2012).

There is emerging evidence for the therapeutic utility of novel non-invasive neuromodulation 
interventions, such as low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in sleep disorders. Therapeutic effects 
of LLLT using red light-emitting diodes (LED) on sleep were demonstrated in healthy adults 
(Zhao, Tian, Nie, Xu, & Liu, 2012) and patients with insomnia (Xu , Wang, Ta, & Li, 2001; 
Xu, Wu, Wang, Shang, & Li, 2002). We are aware of one pilot study reporting improved 
sleep and PTSD symptoms following the red/near infra-red LED treatment in patients with 
chronic moderate TBI and comorbid PTSD (Bogdanova et al., 2014). The study results 
suggest that sleep structure (ACT recordings) can be changed by transcranial LED treatment 
in patients with chronic TBI, as sleep efficiency increased one week post-LED treatment and 
was maintained at 2-month follow-up. LED is a non-invasive, portable and relatively 
inexpensive neuromodulation treatment with potential to reduce multi-symptoms in patients 
with TBI and associated comorbidities, such as sleep disturbance and PTSD. More research 
and randomized controlled studies are needed to investigate specific LED effects on sleep 
and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in this population.

Treatment with bright light to improve daytime function and alertness has been suggested in 
TBI, but there were no published studies evidencing its efficacy (Ponsford et al., 2012). A 
recent study evaluated efficacy of short wavelength (blue) light therapy on fatigue in patients 
with TBI who self-reported fatigue and/or sleep disturbance (Sinclair, Ponsford, Taffe, 
Lockley, & Rajaratnam, 2014). Researchers reported that the high-intensity blue light

Conclusion

therapy resulted in reduced fatigue and daytime sleepiness during the treatment phase, with a 
trend toward baseline levels 4 weeks after the treatment. The authors concluded that the light 
therapy appears to be effective in alleviating fatigue and daytime sleepiness following TBI.

Taken together these and other preliminary findings suggest that novel photobiomodulation 
therapeutic approaches have the potential to reduce sleep disturbance in patients with TBI 
and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Sleep disturbance presents significant problems for the returning Veterans with TBI and 
associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities, such as PTSD and depression. Given that sleep 
plays an important role in the physiologic processes underlying neural recovery (Parcell, 
Ponsford, Redman, & Rajaratnam, 2008), it is critical to identify and treat sleep disorders in 
patients with TBI early in order to promote and facilitate their recovery. As we discussed 
earlier, pharmacologic management has been the main treatment option for sleep disorders 
for patients with insomnia and other neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. There is 
limited evidence for treatments specifically aimed at alleviating sleep disturbance in TBI or 
TBI with PTSD. Recent studies suggest that novel neuromodulation treatments, such as LED 
or light therapy, can improve sleep in TBI, and may potentially provide a safe and non-
invasive non-pharmacological treatment for patients with TBI and associated 
neuropsychiatric comorbidities.

CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

There is currently a need for research to identify best practices for treatment of patients with 
mTBI and associated comorbidities, such as PTSD and sleep disturbance (Report of VA 
Consensus Conference, 2010). An interdisciplinary team approach can provide the necessary 
resources for diagnosis and treatment of multiple comorbidities in this population (Institute 
of Medicine, 2011). Future efforts should focus on the development of new treatment 
protocols and multi-modal treatment programs that could be individually tailored to better 
serve the patient’s individual needs.

One of the challenges in treatment planning for returning Veterans with TBI, PTSD, and 
sleep difficulties is determining the optimal timing for treatment of each of the multiple 
health issues. The argument in favor of early treatment of cognitive dysfunction may be 
based on the premise that TBI–related cognitive deficits may diminish treatment response to 
PTSD interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral treatment or exposure therapy (Bogdanova 
& Verfaellie, 2012). Alternatively, PTSD treatment may become a priority for patients with 
more severe PTSD symptomatology, since problems with impulse control and emotion 
regulation may affect patient’s ability to engage in cognitive treatment (Bryant & Hopwood, 
2006). Moreover, there is a possibility that PTSD interventions may also help to improve 
sleep but in most cases sleep problems remain at clinical levels (Belleville, Guay, & 
Marchand, 2011; Galovski, Monson, Bruce, & Resick, 2009; Zayfert & DeViva, 2004) even 
after successful PTSD treatment. However, if sleep problems do indeed stand in the way of 
successful recovery from PTSD and mTBI, then sleep may become the principal target of

treatment, possibly preceding the start of intervention targeting the primary symptoms for 
each condition. Future clinical trials may provide a much needed evidence base.

Another key issue to consider is treatment accessibility. Providing treatment to patients in 
rural locations might be possible utilizing web-based treatment paradigms. Though limited, 
there is emerging evidence that web-based CBT with automated support may be effective in 
improving the sleep and associated daytime functioning of adults with insomnia (Espie et 
al., 2012). Tele-health protocols specifically targeting sleep difficulties in Veterans with 
multiple comorbidities should be developed and implemented. Three recent research reports 
demonstrate that up to eight weekly sessions of telephone-delivered CBT-I (Arnedt et al., 
2013) or five weeks of computerized CBT-I (Vincent & Walsh, 2013) or six weeks of 
unsupported, internet-delivered self-help CBT-I (Lancee, van den Bout, van Straten, & 
Spoormaker, 2012) can improve sleep in adults with chronic insomnia. It would be also 
important to evaluate whether such protocols can be utilized in treating active duty military 
personnel. For example, one recent study reported efficacy of a behavioral intervention for 
insomnia in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans that involved one in-person and three telephone 
sessions as well as electronic delivery components (Epstein et al., 2013). The authors 
reported large effect sizes for pre- to post-treatment decrease in insomnia severity and sleep 
improvements were maintained at 3-months post-treatment.

Further research is needed to develop treatment programs that would optimize outcome and 
increase adherence to the treatment, which presents significant challenge for Veterans with 
mTBI/PTSD and their providers (Sayer et al., 2009). PTSD symptoms, such as emotional 
dysregulation and avoidance may significantly limit and disrupt the treatment of sleep or 
cognitive problems. Web-based treatment programs, as well as integrated programs 
implemented in primary care clinical settings, might be easier for Veterans to handle. 
Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate efficacy of such programs in Veteran 
population.

While there is currently much interest in potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and 
prognosis of outcome in TBI, this area is still under development. Research is needed to 
develop methods for identification of predictors and moderators of natural recovery and 
treatment outcomes in Veterans with TBI and multiple comorbidities, such as sleep problems 
and PTSD, so that treatment programs can be optimized to fit the patient’s needs. Future 
research efforts can elucidate the neural bases of sleep interventions and the mechanisms of 
change underlying the efficacy of sleep treatments, and inform the future treatment programs 
development.

SUMMARY

TBI and PTSD are currently in the spotlight as problems impacting the current wave of 
Veterans returning from the OEF/OIF/OND combat arenas. However, neither condition is 
specific to this group of Veterans as both have been endemic to combat and non-combat 
Veterans through generations. More recently, sleep has gained the attention of researchers 
and clinicians from a variety of disciplines, being recognized as bi-directionally related to 
multiple psychological and medical conditions, as well as mortality. While sleep problems

have been shown to impact quality of life and functional status on many levels, including 
psychological, cognitive, and physical functioning, it is also understood that sleep can be 
disrupted by multiple physical and psychological conditions.

Sleep is among the primary symptoms of PTSD and TBI, and one of the mediating factors 
affecting the level of severity and treatment outcome of both conditions. Despite its high 
prevalence, few treatments and rehabilitation protocols target sleep as a primary symptom; 
although in many cases even after the resolution of mTBI or PTSD, poor sleep remains at 
clinical levels (Belanger, Morin, Langlois, & Ladouceur, 2004; Clum, Nishith, & Resick, 
2001; Kramer, Booth, Han, & Williams, 2003; Wittmann, Schredl, & Kramer, 2007) and 
continues to impact daily functioning and quality of life (Belanger, Morin, Langlois, & 
Ladouceur, 2004; Clum, Nishith, & Resick, 2001; Kramer, Booth, Han, & Williams, 2003; 
Wittmann, Schredl, & Kramer, 2007).

One of the key problems in sleep research is that sleep is not a stable state, and sleep need 
and drive vary significantly between individuals, especially those with neurologic and 
neuropsychiatric disorders. As a result, the research on sleep, which is limited by the nature 
of the sleep state and sleep measurement (i.e., objective vs. subjective reporting; inter-
individual and within-individual differences), has resulted in many inconsistencies among 
studies and a lack of consensus on a variety of sleep-related issues, including treatment 
recommendations. Future research efforts should target the development of sleep-focused 
interventions and multi-modal treatment programs adjustable to the specific needs of 
patients with multiple comorbidities, such as TBI, PTSD, depression, and sleep disturbance.

Research suggests that sleep is necessary for the consolidation of memories and is important 
for cognitive, psychological, and physical functioning, which leads to the main point 
presented in this review: evaluation and treatment of sleep problems in TBI and PTSD 
should become an integral part of clinical management of these disorders. Although the 
treatment of sleep problems has long been rooted in pharmacology, more recently developed 
non-pharmacologic interventions have proven effective in treating sleep, and may become 
efficient clinical tools to improve daily functioning, treatment outcome, and quality of life in 
individuals with TBI and PTSD.

Highlights

Poor sleep may impact recovery and treatment outcome in Veterans 
with PTSD and TBI

Sleep difficulties are a risk factor for the development and maintenance 
of PTSD

TBI patients can suffer permanent sleep problems regardless of injury 
severity

Sleep-focused interventions could augment current TBI and PTSD 
treatment protocols

We review physiological mechanisms and treatment of sleep problems 
in TBI and PTSD
