Objective. To assess communication skills training at Nordic pharmacy schools and explore ways for
improvement.
Methods. E-mail questionnaires were developed and distributed with the aim to explore current
practice and course leaders’ opinions regarding teaching of patient communication skills at all the
11 master level Nordic (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) pharmacy schools. The
questionnaires contained both closed- and open-ended questions.
Results. There was a variation of patient communication skills training among schools. In general,
communication skills training was included in one to ﬁve courses (mode 1); varied in quantity (6-92
hours); had low use of experiential training methods; and had challenges regarding assessments and
acquiring sufﬁcient resources. However, some schools had more focus on such training.
Conclusion. The results show room for improvement in patient communication skills training in most
Nordic pharmacy schools and give insights into how to enhance communication skill building in
pharmacy curricula. Suggestions for improving the training include: early training start, evidence-
based frameworks, experiential training, and scaffolding.
Keywords: patient communication skills training, pharmacy students, Nordic countries

INTRODUCTION

Efficient pharmacist-patient communication about
medicines improves patient’s adherence to medicines, in-
creases patient’s quality of life and drug knowledge, and
clariﬁes misunderstandings around medicine use.1-4 How-
ever, studies from community pharmacies worldwide found
patients receiving limited counseling with many not receiv-
ing any counseling at all, pharmacists using inappropriate
questioning techniques, and patients receiving a patient cen-
tered-care that is not optimal.5,6 In the Nordic setting, studies
report of a similar pattern. Swedish researchers found that
50% of the dispensing encounters between pharmacists and
patients lasted for only 10 seconds or less when it came to
medical issues.7 In Denmark, 26% of the pharmacist-patient
encounters had no communication about the medicines at
all.8 Norwegian patients reported only being informed about
the use of medicines in 50% of the cases.9,10 In Iceland, phar-
macists seldom gave patients evidence-based information.11

Finnish studies on counseling found communication
rates between 18% and 80%, depending on the kind of
medicine dispensed, and patients reported being coun-
seled in 46% of their visits.12-14 Thus, the public, regu-
lators/policymakers, and Nordic pharmacy educators
have strong reasons to develop and strengthen pharmacy
students’ patient communication skills.

Examples of communication skills are asking ques-
tions, actively listening, empathizing and explaining.15,16
Patient communication skills training, ie, types of training
to develop necessary skills for communication, inﬂuence
the quality and outcomes of health care professionals’ pa-
tient encounters.17 A health care professional’s communi-
cation skills are not only a matter of common sense or
personality traits, rather, they are skills that can be taught
and learned.17-19 The pharmacy education is an important
factor inﬂuencing pharmacist-patient communication.20
According to the World Health Organization, the Interna-
tional Pharmaceutical Federation and the Accreditation
Council for Pharmacy Education, pharmacy schools should
prepare student pharmacists for their future professional life
as counselors.21,22 The European Union (EU) lists two coun-
seling requirements in their directive of professional quali-
ﬁcations. The EU requires a pharmacist trained and working

24

in the EU to be able to “provide information and advice
on medicinal products as such, including on their appro-
priate use” (Article 45); “give personalized support for
patients who administer their medication” (Article 45);
and requires pharmacists to complete six months of
training or pharmacy practice experience (PPE) in a hos-
pital or community pharmacy (Article 44).23 Personal-
ized support for medicine use is in line with a global
trend in pharmacy practice with an increased focus to-
ward new and intensiﬁed ways of using pharmacists’
clinical and pharmacotherapeutic knowledge in the de-
livery of cognitive health care services; also, in such
services, good communication skills are vital.

Traditionally, and still in many parts of the world,
pharmacy education curricula have a strong focus on
natural science24,25 and are designed to support the role
of developing, manufacturing and distributing medi-
cines, rather than on social science and on the anticipated
future role of pharmacists as clinical counselors. Never-
theless, pharmacy schools worldwide have implemented
patient communication courses in their curriculum to
increase students’ competence in this ﬁeld.26-31 Studies
in North America, United Kingdom and Ireland have
attempted to describe the overall curriculum content.27-31
In 1986, the varying levels of involvement from schools in
communication skills training and an unstructured ap-
proach toward teaching those skills were shown in the
United Kingdom and Ireland.27 Similar results were found
in the United States in 1990 with large variations of con-
tent, teaching methods and time devoted to patient com-
munication skills training.28 In 2000, a survey distributed
to pharmacy schools in the US found that more formalized
assessment methods were needed.29 This was still a prob-
lem in 2006, when the necessity for standardizing the
assessment methods was further prompted.30 In 2013,
Schwartzman and colleagues found that didactic training
with lectures dominated communication skills training
in Canadian and American pharmacy schools, and that
student communication skills were assessed by written
examinations.31

Understanding the state of patient communication
education is one factor in improving pharmacists’ coun-
seling practice. The state of patient communication
skills training in Nordic countries is not well-documented,
yet there are few studies that have identiﬁed struggles in
counseling practice. Community pharmacists in Nordic
countries share a common culture where newer cognitive
health care services are beginning to be offered in pharma-
cies and hospitals. The objectives of this study were to
assess communication skill-building in pharmacy curricula
in Nordic pharmacy schools and to ﬁnd ways for improve-
ment. This study’s authors explored current practice and

course leaders’ opinions regarding teaching of patient com-
munication skills.

METHODS

Two email questionnaires were developed and distrib-
uted to all the 11 Nordic pharmacy schools responsible for
educating master degree pharmacy students (five years of
study in the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway and Sweden). Questionnaire 1 was sent to de-
partment heads and/or program coordinators, and ques-
tionnaire 2 was sent to course leaders identified by
questionnaire 1. In a cover letter, respondents were asked
to only include mandatory courses with an explicit focus
on communication with patients and/or other health care
professionals, including theoretical and/or practical ver-
bal or non-verbal communication skills, and competence,
including self-reflection. The above excluded teaching
about academic writing or presentation skills. The respon-
dents were told that they will receive the questionnaire
results. Each pharmacy school’s curriculum was reviewed to
ensure that all relevant courses were reported, including
course descriptions available online. Up to ﬁve repeat emails
were sent to non-responders. Data were collected between
March and November 2015. Ethical approval was not
needed according to Nordic regulations. However, the study
was registered at the Norwegian Centre for Research Data
(data protection ofﬁce for research for Norwegian universi-
ties), and informed consent were collected and data were
stored conﬁdentially.

The two questionnaires contained both closed and
open-ended questions. They were developed based on
two existing questionnaires from medical and physiother-
apy communication skills education32-34 and adapted to
the pharmacy education. The questionnaire design was
developed by the authors (including pharmacy school as-
sociate professors from three of the Nordic countries) after
reviewing prior studies of pharmacy schools.27-30 Ques-
tionnaire 1 contained six questions. Questionnaire 2 con-
tained ﬁve sections with a total of 21 questions that were
both closed and open-ended (Table 1). The two question-
naires were pretested on a pharmacy professor (involved in
communication training) and reviewed by a professor from
a medical faculty in Norway (involved in similar studies
and communication training from the medical education).
Summary of data and simple descriptive statistical
analysis was done in SPSS software (SPSS 22.0 for Win-
dows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Structuring of the open-
ended questions was done in NVivo qualitative data analysis
software (Version 10, 2012, QSR International Pty Ltd.,
Cheshire, UK). All authors read the free-text responses.

responses was chosen, and responses were categorized
according to the main sections from questionnaire 2 (Table
1). In, addition a review of the formal course objectives was
done based on available information on the schools’ home-
pages or provided by the respondents.

RESULTS

All 11 pharmacy schools completed questionnaire 1.
In questionnaire 2, 29 relevant courses were identified
and responses were received from 26 (characteristics of
the study population are listed in Table 2). The results are
presented on an aggregate level for all Nordic schools
and course types: pharmacy practice experience course
(PPE), communication as a stand-alone course (CSC),
other courses (OC, ie, pharmacotherapy, interdisciplinary,
social and/or clinical pharmacy courses). The courses were
categorized to provide a better description of the training

in addition to the PPE required by the European Union
(EU).23 Examples are given of individual schools to dem-
onstrate varying teaching practices. Quotations exemplify-
ing the free text answers are found in Appendix 1.

All schools taught communication skills with most
offering it at the end of the program year (median in year
4) (Table 3). None of the schools taught communication
skills during the entire duration of the curriculum. Within
each curriculum, the range of courses was 1-5 (mode 1).
Overall, the PPE is the predominant period of patient
communication skills training. Four schools had patient
communication skills training as CSC, also mentioned in
the course name. Seven schools had communication skills
training integrated in OC. Four schools used all three course
types (PPE, CSC and OC). One school in Finland reported
using the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Medication
Counseling and Behavior Guidelines Empowerment and

Concordance theoretical framework for their communication
curriculum. Patient communication laboratories were avail-
able at two schools in Finland. Table 3 shows the number of
hours of teacher-led communication education.

A review of the course objectives showed many
having no connection between objectives and course
content with learning outcomes. OC and PPE course
objectives often mention communication without fur-
ther explanation or specification, eg, “Central aspects
considering. . .communication are discussed. . .custo-
mer communication.” In PPE courses, a common learn-
ing outcome was “to be able to give rational information/
and in dialog identify medicine use related problems.”
Some learning outcomes were more patient focused:
“guide and empower patients in order to give them the
maximum beneﬁt of their medicines.” The clinical phar-
macy courses often focused on “executing a medicine use
review.” In two CSC courses, the main focus of both
objective and learning outcomes was on communication
skills and how they affect the use of other pharmacy skills.
Three schools reported employing individuals who
were responsible for coordinating patient communication
skills training throughout the curriculum. The most com-
mon educational background of faculty teaching commu-
nication
formal
communication education (ie, a university education in
communication science and/or communication skills edu-
cation/training) (17 courses). Six schools had professors,
associate and assistant professors with formal training in

pharmacy without

training was

patient communication skills (3 of 4 courses within a CSC,
1 of 12 PPE, and 3 of 10 OC). In general, respondents
expressed that more faculty who teach “communication”
would be beneﬁcial and some felt that the PPE tutors did
not have sufﬁcient competency to assess/give feedback on
communication skills. Two also mention their own lack
of competency in the area, for example, that they as phar-
macists lacked patient communication education. Res-
pondents responsible for courses involving faculty with
clinical experiences reported that this facilitated training.
In the free text answers related to general information
about the communication training and resources needed,
many respondents identified the PPE course with patients
in real life as a great opportunity for student learning. Re-
spondents having a patient communication course arranged
before the first part of practical training praised this because
they felt it eased the transition to practice. Further, some
respondents here mentioned problems with engaging and
motivating students on the topic, as well as making them
realize the importance of communication skills training for
their future professional life. A few reported that students
did not perceive it as “science.” One respondent shared
how she/he had managed to engage the students and that
until today, the students did not question the relevance of
patient communication skills training. Many respondents
mentioned a desire for a greater focus on communication
skills training, for example, longer courses, more practical
training, better ways of transferring communication theory
into practice, and time for students to reﬂect on communi-
cation skills and the professional role. Further, teaching,
what they perceived as too large classes (more than 30
students) made it difﬁcult to individualize the training to
ensure that all students received sufﬁcient training and
feedback. Common barriers were time and money. In the
free text answers, few respondents were satisﬁed with the
current status. Nearly all respondents said they planned to
expand and/or restructure the communication teaching.
Some schools planned to introduce the training earlier, re-
structure their course into several minor parts, increase
focus on interdisciplinary training, and use better resources
such as virtual pharmacies and/or training centers.

Advising, informing and listening are skills taught at
all schools (Table 4). Less represented skills and topics
were health literacy, communicating with children about
medicines (except in CSC) and motivational interviewing
technique (except in CSC). On average, each school of-
fered 24 different skills and/or topics (range 8-31). In
Finland, one school devoted 92 hours of teacher-led com-
munication skills training and covered 31 skills; other
schools devoted less time (10-15 hours) but still covered
20 skills. Topics and skills to teach were chosen by a more
formalized approach, ie, by a core content analysis among

teachers, students and pharmacists working in practice
about relevant topics and skills, or informally by the
teachers themselves (topics believed in some way to im-
prove communication skills).

Patient communication skills training was taught via lec-
tures at all schools (Table 5). Fewer schools (range 3-7) used
more experiential (interactive/practical) training methods, such
as video recording, role play, and simulated patients. Two
schools used computer simulations. Practical training with real
patients occurred during the PPE and was used by all schools.
In median, 12 teaching methods were in use at each school
(range 3-14). The most commonly used textbook was “Com-
munication Skills in Pharmacy Practice‐A Practical Guide for
Students and Practitioners” by Beardsley and colleagues,35
used by four schools in ﬁve PPE courses and one CSC course.

The most common way of providing feedback to
students was through pharmacy tutors during the PPE
period and the least used methods were feedback by
self-evaluation and video recording (Table 6). In median
2, different feedback methods were used at each school
(range 1-6). None of the schools reported assessing stu-
dents’ overall development of patient communication
skills during training across the courses/years.

Reflected in the free text answers, some respondents
found it challenging to find teaching methods that re-
flected practice and that also engaged students. Respon-
dents using role play said that role play was a good
learning experience for the students, especially when it
was followed with group discussions. Others, however,
mentioned difficulties with this method as some students

did not take it seriously. Other methods used include
employing an actor to mimic real situations and combin-
ing several teaching and assessment methods. In the free
text many respondents reported they would welcome us-
ing more experiential teaching methods such as role play,
theater, simulation, actors, video recording, e-learning
(ie, online self-directed learning modules) and focus
more on patient cases in the education. In the free text,
some also mentioned a desire for more individualized
training in one-on-one situations and better adapted phys-
ical resources, eg, a training pharmacy.

Different assessment methods, in median 2, were
used per school (range 1-5). Assessment by a reflective
essay was a common assessment method (Table 7). One

school used objective structured clinical examinations
(OSCE) as a summative assessment method. Some re-
spondents mentioned assessment (summative and forma-
tive, ie, feedback) as a challenging area both regarding
ﬁnding good and quality- assured assessment methods,
and time, money and competence for executing the as-
sessments. Respondents would further develop assess-
ment methods in an ideal world by using OSCE.

DISCUSSION

This is the first study mapping current practice
and course leaders’ opinions on communication skills
training at Nordic pharmacy schools. This study can serve
as a basis for future research, development and improvement

of communication skills training. The most common way
of patient communication skills training was through
PPE. There is considerable variation of patient commu-
nication skills training among schools, both among Nor-
dic countries and within the pharmacy schools in each
country. Some of these variations were on the number
of hours of teacher-led training (6 to 92 hours), the avail-
ability of communication training as standalone courses
(offered at four schools), interdisciplinary training (two
schools), use of experiential teaching methods, number of
courses aside from the required PPE per school (range 2-5),
assessment methods, and use of patient communication lab-
oratories. Schools that devote more teaching hours use more
experiential teaching methods. The identiﬁed pattern of
communication training are similar to those identiﬁed by
previous studies eg, less focus on experiential teaching
methods, lack of standardized assessment methods and use
of written examinations .27-31

Figure 1 shows possible strategies to enhance com-
munication skills training that were identiﬁed from pre-
vious research. The ﬁgure is an interpretation of the
results on how they may be connected/scaffolded and
used to improve students’ learning communication skills.
The results reflect varying prioritization of the topic
at different schools and countries and could both mirror

pharmacists’ (current and traditional) work cultures in their
respective countries and type of university (small, big, new,
old, etc.). Finnish pharmacy schools devote the most num-
ber of hours to training and provide the most number of
patient communication laboratories. This may be because
Finland has the “strictest” legislation of communication in
pharmacies as the country only allows pharmacists (and not
pharmacy technicians) to counsel on medicines, and con-
sequently, many pharmacists work there.36 Despite this, Fin-
land still has difﬁculties with varying counseling practice.12-14
In Norway, where almost all students who have graduated
from a pharmacy school work in pharmacies, some schools
have invested more time in patient communication training.
In Denmark and Sweden (historically), many pharmacists
work in the pharmaceutical industry

None of the pharmacy schools spread the commu-
nication skills training over all five years of education.
Training occurs at a relatively late stage at several
schools. This results to missed opportunities in provid-
ing additional training for students for skills develop-
ment by repetition and rehearsing of communication
skills.17,29,31,37,38 Early placement of the practical train-
ing, such as an early introductory PPE in the curriculum,
has been shown to help students to better grasp the the-
oretical knowledge in Finland.39,40

An evidence-based framework, either consensus-
skill based or outcome based, has been recommended
for a health care professional’s communication curricu-
lum.16,17,41 This framework should be ﬂexible to ﬁt each
patient meeting. Students need an evidence-based frame-
work and a toolbox of communication skills to pick
from.17 There is no consensus among Nordic pharmacy
schools on what skills and issues to teach. A recent state-
ment from health care professionals (including pharma-
cists) calls for such a uniﬁed approach and argue that it is
necessary and possible.16 Hyva¨rinen reported that each
profession has its own discipline speciﬁc communication
skills, which should be emphasized when developing a pa-
tient communication skills curriculum.42

Didactic and experiential teaching methods were
identified. Many of the courses include different teaching
methods, and as earlier studies have shown, communica-
tion training can be performed in different ways.26,28 Lec-
tures are the most common form of teaching and students
practice with real patients in PPE. Few schools use expe-
riential teaching methods; only three schools use video
recordings and mainly in a CSC. This is in line with earlier
ﬁndings from American and Canadian pharmacy schools
where lectures were the primary mode of delivery.31 No
comprehensive study regarding pharmacy education com-
pares different learning methods or curricula concerning
effectiveness.26,31 At medical schools, models for curricula
design and experiential learning such as role play, simu-
lated patients, and video recording have been shown to be

effective.17,43,44 They could possibly be effective for phar-
macy students as well, and could hence be interesting to
develop, evaluate and use more in pharmacy schools.

Observation, feedback, self-directed learning and
skill assessment are essential components in helping stu-
dents learn patient communication skills.17,19,45 In this
study, feedback and a summative judgement are often
conducted by PPE tutors (typically pharmacy em-
ployees/community pharmacists). They often lack train-
ing in communication skills, according to a Swedish
study.46 Consequences can be variable assessment of stu-
dents based on subjective judgments. To receive the full
potential of the patient communication skills training
package, faculty members and preceptors must have rel-
evant skills and have completed training themselves.17
Pharmacy preceptors play an important role in the educa-
tion of pharmacy students’ practical pharmacy training.
Previous studies in Sweden showed that preceptor train-
ing is important for the students’ outcome of the course
regarding level of reﬂection achieved at the end of the
PPE.47 Faculty and preceptors should be trained in a wide
variety of teaching methods, theories and knowledge
about student attitudes toward learning such skills eg,
by increasing their theoretical knowledge but also by par-
ticipating in different experiential training sessions. This
can be done through short programs/workshops, local
networks, online training materials, in-house training.17
Faculty should also support students to self-directed
learning. Studies suggest that scaffolding could be used

to form self-directed learners, since scaffolding aligns
progressive development of skills by using formative
feedback and summative assessments with the goal of
helping students be more independent learners toward
the end of their education.19 Blended training format,
a mix of e-learning and in-class experiential teaching with
feedback, could be an attractive teaching format to im-
prove students’ communication skills and as a way to
streamline resources.48 None of the schools assess the over-
all development and the summative assessment methods
appear not focused on assessing actual communication
skills with patients (or actors). There is no consensus on
more formal summative assessment methods. This was
further conﬁrmed in the free-text answers as a difﬁcult area
and where improvements are needed. These ﬁnding are in
line with previous studies, which found a shortage of val-
idated instruments for assessing patient communication
skills training of pharmacy students.26,29-31

All but one respondent identified a need to increase the
patient communication skills training. They listed several
organizational barriers such as lack of resources, money and

time for advancing the education. This is reflected in the
reported amount and type of patient communication educa-
tion. For example, schools devoting 6-15 hours of commu-
nication skills training probably only manage to teach
students communication skills superficially and not in
a one-on-one learning situation. One explanation for these
discrepancies could be that pharmacists traditionally have
been taught to manufacture medicines. It seems as if many
curricula are lagging behind. Schools would need to allocate
another resource. It can be challenging to increase and re-
structure communication education in an already crowded
curriculum, balancing it to mirror current and future work
practice. One could argue that a strategy might be to work
on the attitudes and awareness of the topic’s importance in
achieving rational medicine use in the society among key
faculty members and other decision makers. Many students
will, during their professional life, encounter patients daily
at pharmacies, municipalities (nursing homes, at the GPs)
and hospitals in the Nordic countries. Therefore, pharmacists
need well-developed communication skills to transfer
their clinical competence to patients. Limited training

in patient communication skills is one reason for the
scarce communication on medicines in Nordic pharmacy
practice.7-14

The questionnaire was not anonymous (respondents
were identified), which might have resulted in socially
desirable answers. Some schools also offer different vol-
untary courses with elements of communication training;
those were excluded from the study. In general, respon-
dents found it difficult to report the amount of teacher-led
training and it was missing for some courses. In addition,
different interpretations of which courses to include
might have been present among the participants, as many
courses contain little training or fragments. This might
have led to an under- or over-reporting of courses.

Questions can be raised on how much time, re-
sources, and type of teaching methods are needed to raise
good counselors for pharmacy practice. More research is
needed to measure different educational interventions
and impact of curriculum designs on pharmacist practice
and patient outcomes. A case study of successful patient
communication curricula could give insight into best
teaching practice.

CONCLUSION

Nordic pharmacy schools need to restructure their
communication skills training to help students and future
pharmacists improve their communication skills so they
can provide effective patient care.

Course Content
General Information about the Patient Communication Skills Training and Resources

“. . .the students don’t consider this SCIENCE! They seem to think that science is only natural science. . . which is not true. . . of
course. . .whenever a good communication teacher has given a brilliant lecture, the students tended to say ‘well, this is just common
sense.’” (Respondent 3)

“We have succeeded in motivating students: at the beginning/. . ./ we had to constantly explain how important the course was,

nowadays this is not required, the course is widely seen as necessary.” (Respondent 26)

“Students need more training, ﬁrst in a safe environment, then with real patients.” (Respondent 20)
“Communication skills should be focused upon to a much greater extent than they are and from an earlier point in time. The way

our course is structured is not optimal. Several hours of quite passive listening crammed into two days is not enough and is
counterproductive. One-on-one exercises in smaller groups spread over a few days with a summing up of the most important moments
for the whole class is one option. In situ assignments after agreement with certain pharmacies is another–this would require time,
energy, dedication, and trust. But it is worth it.” (Respondent 4)

“Large groups vs not enough resources. New teaching methods should be implemented. The majority of the students are young,
starting to ﬁnd their professional identity and their own work reﬂection abilities. It is possible to achieve that, but requires work, time
and peace and quiet. Students would beneﬁt from personal mentoring and calm small groups. That is not possible now (too large
groups!).” (Respondent 26)

“I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to have enough knowledge to teach communication skills to students.” (Respondent 25)

Teaching Methods

“Feedback and again more feedback. Find good teaching methods so that students take the subject seriously. Getting students to
understand the difﬁculties and the need to talk and discuss communication. Many think that it is not a university subject and ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to take the subject seriously. Going in with the setting ‘no one to teach me how to talk to customers.’” (Respondent 7)
“In an ideal world we would have actors as customers/patients, as then we could really practice with complicated cases (angry,

hostile customers, challenged customers, elderly, children, etc.). In an ideal world, we would also always have a trained
communication skills teacher present (now she only meets the students once in a group meeting).” (Respondent 8)

Assessment of Patient Communication Skills Training

“Communication skills /. . ./ constitute many different skills. It is very difﬁcult to assess the students for all these skills. As well,

few pharmacy tutors have the competence to evaluate communication skills.” (Respondent 5)

“The assessment would need to be quality assured further. Supervisors’ opinion (pharmacy tutor) is today almost the only one.

Which is a little vague and would have to be strengthened.” (Respondent 23)
