## What is persistent depressive disorder?


Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is a form of chronic depression. The term combines two earlier diagnoses — dysthymia and chronic major depressive disorder.

Like other types of depression, people with PDD may experience feelings of deep sadness and hopelessness. While these symptoms are present in all forms of depression, in PDD they may persist for many years.

The constant nature of these symptoms means that the condition may interfere with school, work, and personal relationships. However, a combination of medication and therapy can be effective in treating PDD.


## Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder


The symptoms of PDD are similar to those ofdepression. However, the key difference is that PDD is chronic, with symptoms occurring on most days for at least2 years.

Many doctors use the symptoms listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to diagnose PDD. This manual is published by theAmerican Psychiatric Association. The PDD symptoms listed in the DSM-5 include:

- depression almost every day for most of the day

- having a poor appetite or overeating

- difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep

- low energy or fatigue

- low self-esteem

- poor concentration or difficulty making decisions

- feelings of hopelessness

## Diagnosing persistent depressive disorder


To make an accurate diagnosis, your doctor will first perform a physical examination. They will also order blood tests or other laboratory tests to rule out possible medical conditions that may be causing your symptoms.

If your doctor believes you have PDD, they’ll likely refer you to a mental health professional forfurther evaluationand treatment.

For a diagnosis, adults must have symptoms of PDD nearly every day for2 or more years. For children or teens, they must experience a depressed mood or irritability most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 1 year.

Your doctor will ask you certain questions to assess your current mental and emotional state. It’s important to be honest with your doctor about your symptoms. Your responses will help them determine whether you have PDD or another type of mental health condition.


## Treating persistent depressive disorder


Treatment for PDD typically consists ofmedicationand psychotherapy.

Medical professionals may recommend various types of antidepressants to treat PDD, including:

- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft)

- tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline (Elavil) and amoxapine (Asendin)

- serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) and duloxetine (Cymbalta)

You may need to try different medications and dosages to find an effective solution for your specific situation. This requires patience, as many medications take several weeks to take full effect.

Talk with your doctor if you continue to have concerns about your medication. Your doctor may suggest changing dosage or medication.

Never stop taking your medication as directed without speaking with your doctor first. Stopping treatment suddenly or missing several doses may cause withdrawal-like symptoms and make depressive symptoms worse.

A combination of medication and psychotherapy is themost effectivemethod for treating PDD.

Medical professionals will commonly suggest taking part inpsychotherapyorcognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

Psychotherapy, which may be referred to as talk therapy, typically involves sessions with a mental health professional. These can happen either in person or remotely viaphone or video calls. You may also participate in group sessions.

CBT focuses on your actions and behaviors in addition to your thoughts and emotions. In CBT, you will work to identify and deal with what is causing your depression. This will include talking with mental health professionals to help you accept your symptoms and establish safe coping habits for PDD.
