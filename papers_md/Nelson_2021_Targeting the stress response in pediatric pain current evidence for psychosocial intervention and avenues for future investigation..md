Targeting the stress response in pediatric pain:
current evidence for psychosocial intervention and
avenues for future investigation

Abstract
Nonpharmacological treatments for chronic pain in youth have been identified as first-line treatments over and above medication.
Therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction have shown good efficacy in reducing the
psychological correlates (eg, anxiety, depression, and stress) and social or behavioral sequelae (eg, limited physical activity and lack
of school engagement) associated with pediatric chronic pain. However, minimal research has examined the physiological
mechanism(s) of action for these interventions. A recent review (Cunningham, et al., 2019) emphasized the need for objective (ie,
physiological) assessment of treatment response in pediatric pain populations. The current review adds to this literature by
identifying the physiological stress response as a particular target of interest in interventions for pediatric pain. Research indicates
that youth with chronic pain report high rates of psychological stress, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and exposure to adverse
childhood experiences (abuse/neglect, etc). In addition, a host of research has shown strong parallels between the neurobiology of
pain processing and the neurobiology of stress exposure in both youth and adults. Interventions such as narrative or exposure
therapy (eg, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy) and mindfulness-based or meditation-based therapies have shown
particular promise in alleviating the neurobiological impact that stress and pain can have on the body, including reduction in allostatic
load and altered connectivity in multiple brain regions. However, no study to date has specifically looked at these factors in the
context of pediatric pain treatment. Future research should further explore these constructs to optimize prevention in and treatment
of these vulnerable populations.

mented in receiver operating characteristic analysis trials.40

been found to optimize or outperform the pharmacological
impact on these outcomes by addressing the psychological and
social aspects of pain-related disability, such as decreased pain
tolerability, decreased social interaction, and increased functional
impairment and fear of pain.22 Emerging research has started to
indicate that these nonpharmacological interventions, much like
the above noted classes of medication, may directly and indirectly
modify nervous system sensitivity.17 However, the literature on

Aspects of neurological

physiological stress response and pain processing in youth76
are highlighted in Figure 1. The HPA axis (depicted in red) is one
of the primary moderators of the neuroendocrine and neurobi-
ological stress response, comprising the hypothalamus, pituitary
gland, and adrenal cortex and releasing adrenal hormones (eg,
epinephrine/norepinephrine) and corticosteroids (eg, cortisol) in
response to stress.32,76 Major brain areas implicated in the stress
response and pain processing (depicted in green) include the
prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and locus coeruleus
(LC).20,76 Finally, constructs representing the broader impact of
stress on neurobiology (depicted in blue) include, as mentioned
above, increased AL.71,78

3. Stress—the great arbiter of homeostasis or
allostatic load

Stress has been well established as an inciting factor of
homeostatic disruption and neurobiological dysfunction in youth
and adults.5,13,66 Primary neurobiological processes involved in
the stress response also have been concretely identified and
involve several aspects of the neurological system, including the
HPA axis,32 brain structures that help regulate the HPA axis and
manage emotional aspects and interpretation of stressful
events,9,20 and, more globally, AL.19,44 For a comprehensive
review of the neurobiological impact of stress, refer to the study
by Nelson, et al., 2020.76 In short, stress exposure effects include
changes in brain structures in conjunction with dysregulation of

Measures of

the neurobiological stress response (eg,
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal [HPA] axis and autonomic ner-
vous system) have been proposed to be unique predictors of pain
chronicity in youth76 given the frequent occurrence of psycho-
logical stress (herein referred to as “stress”), posttraumatic stress
symptoms (PTSS),77,85 and adverse childhood experiences
(ACEs; abuse, neglect, violent/conflictual home environment,
parent/guardian separation or divorce, etc.28) documented in
pediatric pain populations.75,77,79,80 Outside of pain, a large body
of research highlights the malleability of the stress response and
the ensuing “wear and tear” that stress can impose on the
nervous system, most notably in youth (vs. adults).19,44,59,66,67,69
Thus, modification of the stress response may decrease pain
chronicity and impairment in vulnerable and affected youth; this
hypothesis remains untested. Several
interventions exist that
address the unique biopsychosocial (BPS) correlates of stress in
youth. Some of these interventions have not been performed in
trauma-focused cognitive-
pediatric pain populations (eg,
behavioral

therapy
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and biofeed-
back.8,11,62,64 However, only a few of
these studies have
these interventions in
specifically examined the efficacy of
modifying the physiological stress response. Furthermore,
evidence suggests that many youth with chronic pain do not
respond to treatment (eg, decrease in disability or increase in
adaptive coping) after engaging in traditionally used psychosocial
therapies (eg, CBT).16,103 One reason for such treatment failure
may be that currently accepted interventions for chronic pain do
not adequately target the stress response as a major factor in pain
maintenance. However,
this hypothesis remains untested.
Accordingly, the aims of the current review are to (1) propose
for psychosocial
the stress response as a unique target
intervention to alleviate chronic pain and (2) outline new avenues
for treatment that may enhance outcomes (eg, disability or pain
intensity) through more directly and comprehensively targeting
the stress response. Across both aims, we identify salient gaps in
the literature and propose avenues for future research.

or longer in the absence of a primary medical
underlying neurobiology of chronic pain is frequently conceptu-
alized as the product of central sensitization, which is the increase
in activity and responsiveness in nociceptive pathways in the
central and peripheral nervous systems after a painful event.43,53
However, up to 50% of youth with chronic pain fail to report a
recognizable inciting incident for their chronic pain50 for a number
including when minor injuries and unknown or

undiagnosed disease processes (eg, rare disease) are involved.
The diagnostic conceptualization of pediatric chronic pain is often

the HPA axis. The HPA axis is a primary stress response system
involving the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands20
and is a system commonly measured as part of the larger
construct of AL (see below). Key biomarkers reflecting HPA axis
functioning are levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol and
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).9 Regulation of the HPA axis is,
in part, controlled by the hippocampus.32 Results from several
studies indicate that prolonged glucocorticoid release in re-
sponse to stress exposure can lead to decreased hippocampal
volume.9,32,67 Other areas affected by prolonged or significant
stress and pain include (but are not limited to) the amygdala,
prefrontal cortex (PFC), and LC. The amygdala is part of the fear
network and shares connectivity across brain regions.72 Re-
search indicates that in response to stress, dendrites in the
amygdala expand, which causes increased activity in the
area.70,72 In the PFC, endocannabinoids are partially responsible
for dampening or blocking the stress response in the HPA axis.39
Remodeling can occur in the PFC in response to stress but can
be alleviated after the source of stress is removed.69,70,72 Finally,
chronic sources of stress have been shown to induce changes in
the physiology and function of the LC, such as dendritic growth
by exposure to corticotropin-releasing factor after HPA axis
activation.6

Across these processes, the experience of varying degrees
and types of stress (eg, psychological stress, abuse, or toxic
stress) has been associated with a host of health-related issues in
adulthood,
including obesity, cancer, diabetes, and chronic
pain.2,9,12,29,59,65 However, research on the impact of stress on
health-related functioning and disease susceptibility in youth is
limited, although ongoing. One of the more prominent health
conditions being proposed as related to or exacerbated by stress
in pediatric populations is chronic pain.1,56,76,78 The first

increased C-
reactive protein92,111), and altered connectivity in brain structures
implicated in the stress response (as described above).76 The
experience of chronic pain may, in fact, fall under the category of
“toxic stress” or significant or prolonged exposure to stress, with
the neurobiological stress re-
accompanying activation of
sponse,102 given the lengthy average duration of experienced
pain and functional disability in these youth.1,45,75 That is, chronic
pain may not only be initiated or exacerbated by stress exposures
but also be itself a form of
toxic stress with consequent
neurobiological effects. Exposure in childhood to toxic stress,
such as trauma or ACEs, has been linked to lifelong conse-
quences for physical and mental health through the neurobio-
logical correlates described above (eg, AL and HPA axis
dysfunction)101,102 and is an important consideration in the
context of long-term outcomes in youth with chronic pain.

4. Psychosocial intervention and chronic pain—what
is the current evidence?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report
in 2016 that outlined best practices for chronic pain treatment.22

In this report, nonpharmacological treatments, most notably
psychosocial interventions such as CBT, were identified as first-
line treatments for chronic pain in youth.22 Cognitive-behavioral
therapy has been found to be beneficial for chronic pain through
targeting decreased levels of activity in relation to emotional
distress and functional disability (eg, behavioral activation) and
addressing altered cognitions surrounding the pain experience
(eg, reframing catastrophizing pain thoughts).26 More recently,
mindfulness-based interventions such as MBSR and acceptance
and commitment therapy have shown promise in addressing
cognitive and behavioral aspects of the pain experience11,52,64,93
by focusing on observing one’s present state in a nonjudgmental
manner.37 Although there is societal demand for nonpharmaco-
logical treatments, their fidelity and quality still need to be defined.
Multiple articles have reviewed the efficacy of psychotherapy in
the treatment of pediatric pain (eg, Palermo, et al., 2010; Fisher,
et al., 2014; and Eccleston, et al., 2014), with heaviest focus on
randomized clinical trials using CBT interventions, biofeedback,
and relaxation training.30,31,89 Results of
these systematic
reviews and meta-analyses generally reveal a significant positive
effect of interventions on pain intensity and functional disability.
Individual studies on the efficacy of psychosocial
interventions
also have shown a strong short-term positive impact on
psychological (eg, anxiety, depression, fear of pain, and pain
catastrophizing) and social (eg, peer engagement and school
attendance)
factors commonly observed in pediatric pain
patients.16,25,48,57,60,103 Efforts to examine the impact of com-
bining physical training with psychosocial intervention have also
begun, with promising results.47,49 However, research indicates
that a significant subset of youth fails to respond to traditional
psychosocial
interventions geared towards alleviating chronic
pain.15,103,105 Initial factors identified as barriers to successful
treatment
include patient anxiety and other psychological
symptoms and parent factors, such as pain history and pain
catastrophizing.14,15 However,
few studies have objectively
examined changes (or lack thereof) that may occur in aspects
of neurobiological pain processing (eg, HPA axis dysregulation:
cortisol/DHEA and autonomic nervous system function: E/NE) in
intervention. Consequently, data are
response to psychosocial
limited as to whether traditional targets of intervention, including
psychological impairment (eg, anxiety and depression), disability,
and pain intensity, contribute to or are representative of
physiological or neurobiological changes in the individual. A
recent review emphasized the need for the objective assessment
of pain treatment outcomes17 and identified several brain
mechanisms to consider, including those involved in the attention
network, cognitive control
(eg, prefrontal cortex), nociceptive
processing (eg, thalamus and insula), and the fear network and
emotional processing (eg, amygdala and hippocampus).17 Re-
search assessing the responsiveness of these areas, including
areas intrinsic to the physiological stress response, to available
psychosocial interventions for pain remains limited.

history of trauma or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that
may be relevant to consider in the context of treating youth with
chronic pain. One of the most robust interventions for children
and adolescents is TF-CBT.61,74 Trauma-focused cognitive-
behavioral therapy operates under the framework “PRACTICE,”
which represents several common tenets across typical CBT
therapies, such as psychoeducation and parenting skills (P),

4

relaxation training (R), affective modulation (A), and cognitive
coping (C). Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy also
includes elements of intervention specifically catered to trauma,
including gradual emotional and cognitive exposure to the trauma
(eg, asking the child to name the trauma directly: “when I was
abused” vs “when that thing happened to me”), trauma narrative
construction and processing (T), and in vivo mastery of the trauma
(I). The goal of engaging trauma-exposed children and adoles-
cents in therapy with emotional exposure and narrative work is to
desensitize them to the fear or distress that they associate with
memories or situations connected to the trauma (eg, seeing
the traumatic
people or going places that remind them of
event).61,74 Talking through specific details of the event in the
form of a narrative can also help correct negative or inaccurate
thoughts or beliefs about the traumatic experience (eg, “I could
have done something to stop it”) that may be perpetuating the
fear or distress.21,74 Evidence indicates that pediatric interven-
tions that include a trauma narrative lead to greater reductions in
trauma-related fear and general anxiety as well as parent-related
distress relative to treatments that do not include a trauma
narrative component.21 Recent studies among traumatized youth
also indicate that narrative therapy, whether as part of TF-CBT or
independently, produces more robust and stable treatment
outcomes, including reductions in PTSD symptoms and im-
provements in sleep, when compared with treatment as usual.91

5.1. Mindfulness

One of the other major categories of intervention geared towards
addressing the impact of stress and trauma is mindfulness-based
interventions. As mentioned above, the basic tenet of mindful-
ness is teaching individuals to observe their experience in a
nonjudgmental manner37 and has been used successfully in the
context of chronic pain. In the context of trauma, similar to TF-
CBT and narrative or exposure work, mindfulness practice can
lead individuals to view their traumas or stress with kindness and
nonjudgment rather than fear or avoidance.7 This is exemplified in
one of the tenets of MBSR that teaches “stress 1 resistance 5
suffering.”36 Most often studied in traumatized or highly stressed
adults, an abundance of evidence suggests that mindfulness can
lead to sustained improvement in mood and PTSS and increases
in resilience.33,51 Preliminary work in traumatized or at-risk
pediatric populations also indicates that MBSR leads to greater
feelings of competence with stress management and enhanced
self-awareness.42

6. Neurobiological perspectives on stress-focused or
trauma-focused interventions

Given that the neurobiological areas of interest described above
(eg, HPA axis dysregulation: cortisol/DHEA, sympathetic nervous
system dysregulation: E/NE, and altered brain connectivity) are
proposed mechanisms of pain,76,78,107 they may also be
considered as intervention outcomes to be assessed through
objective measurement (eg, saliva assay, urine analysis, and
functional magnetic resonance imaging) over the course of
treatment. The functioning of the HPA axis is already studied in
the context of psychosocial
intervention. Generally, HPA axis
dysfunction can manifest as dysregulated glucocorticoid release,
sleep disruption, blood pressure issues, and immunosuppres-
sion.19,32 Admittedly, evidence has been inconsistent on the
ability of psychosocial interventions to target HPA axis dysregu-
lation through normalized cortisol or DHEA levels. In the context of
PTSD, a recent review indicated that certain trauma-focused

PAIN Reports®

interventions, including TF-CBT, prolonged exposure (PE), and
eye-movement desensitization reprocessing, performed on
adults with PTSD, are effective in mitigating dysregulation in
basal cortisol
levels and the cortisol awakening response in
certain subsamples; however, more broad results from these
studies remain mixed.86,99,100 In youth particularly, evidence
suggests that certain aspects of HPA axis functioning (eg, basal
cortisol
levels) may be indicative of who may be more or less
responsive to TF-CBT113 and MBSR63 and, moreover, may be a
more reliable measure of treatment response than subjective
measures such as psychological questionnaires.63 This latter
finding supports the rationality of efforts to objectively measure
treatment response through biological measures such as saliva
assay rather than rely on traditional pain measures such as (self-
reported) disability and pain intensity.

As discussed above, changes in brain structures, such as the
hippocampus, amygdala, PFC, and LC, have been shown to take
place in conjunction with exposure to stress and the ensuing
dysregulation of the HPA axis.6,39,69,70,72 However, few studies
have directly measured functional connectivity in these brain
regions preintervention and postintervention. Findings from the
few relevant studies, mostly in adults, suggest
that certain
exposure-based trauma interventions (eg, PE) enhance connec-
tivity in the amygdala and hippocampus.114 These enhanced
connections may improve an individual’s inhibition, memory
encoding and retrieval, and ability to re-evaluate threats.114 Some
adult studies have also observed volumetric changes in the
amygdala54 and decreased activation of the PFC3 after certain
psychotherapies (eg, eye-movement desensitization reprocess-
ing and exposure-based interventions). Evidence in the context of
stress-related disorders generally indicates that trauma-focused
interventions are more effective at producing brain changes than
basic cognitive-behavioral or supportive psychotherapy without
an exposure component.3

More global outcomes of stress on the body that may be
influenced by interventions include AL. As described above, AL is
a construct that represents the multisystem wear and tear and
long-term vulnerability to illness or disease that repeated or
prolonged stress can impose.66 Once present, AL is maintained
through continued exposure to stress and consequent health-
related behaviors, such as disrupted sleep, poor nutrition, and
sedentary behaviors or reduced physical exercise.66,68,70 Several
studies, predominantly in adults, highlight the responsivity of AL,
individual
measured through a multifactorial composite of
mechanisms, to psychosocial
intervention. For example, pre-
liminary evidence suggests that MBSR or CBT can help mitigate
AL after significant or prolonged stress exposure.87,97 Comple-
mentary interventions such as yoga or tai chi also have shown
preliminary effectiveness in their ability to mitigate AL.18,97
However, our current understanding on how psychosocial
interventions and AL may interact is lacking, and more research
in both pediatric and adult populations is needed.

7. Implications for future pediatric pain interventions

A stress-focused or trauma-focused approach to intervention
may be the logical next step in optimizing psychosocial
intervention for these youth. This argument is further strength-
ened by preliminary evidence suggesting that youth with chronic
pain and PTSD experience decreased response to non–trauma-
focused CBT intervention.77 Applying a trauma-focused lens to
chronic pain intervention may include adapted elements of
trauma therapies (eg, TF-CBT and narrative exposure) or
streamlining care to mindfulness-based strategies. A strong

body of research indicates that the nature of pain memories is

highly predictive of
Accordingly, youth with chronic pain may benefit from the general
framework of TF-CBT adapted to apply to the context of pain.
This could include psychoeducation about BPS aspects of stress
or trauma and chronic pain (P), relaxation training (R) and affective
modulation (A) put into the context of pain and pain-related
distress, and cognitive coping (C) applied to pain catastrophizing
and fear of pain. Trauma-focused aspects of the intervention,
including trauma narrative construction and processing (T) and in
vivo mastery of the trauma (I), may involve constructing and
processing a narrative surrounding a particularly stressful or
intense pain memory. Working with youth, with or without a
history of other stressful experiences, to deconstruct or build a
narrative surrounding their memory of pain (eg, examine cognitive
biases and emotions surrounding the event) as one would a
traumatic memory may contribute to desensitizing the strong
emotional or fear-based response to pain that many youth
experience.104 In this context, regulation of the HPA axis through
trauma-focused or narrative work may optimize overall health and
sleep patterns, which could then mitigate AL,97 alter connectivity
in various brain areas affected by stress,76 and decrease the
associated pain response.38,90 Longitudinally, these interven-
tions may also protect the individual
from known effects of
chronic toxic stress, including AL and increased risk for poor
health and early death.96,101,102 More research in pediatric pain
populations is needed that implements objective measures (eg,
functional magnetic resonance imaging and saliva assay), in
conjunction with traditionally measured pain outcomes (eg,
disability and pain intensity), to assess the neurobiological effects
of interventions on the stress response and on pain.

Although mindfulness-based approaches have been studied in
adult chronic pain populations and show promise in the treatment
of chronic pain,62,64,94,98,108 these types of interventions have been
examined only recently in pediatric pain populations.11,52,58,109
Minimal research has specifically examined the ability of mindful-
ness practice to directly affect the neurobiological processes (eg,
altered functional connectivity and AL) common to the experiences
of both stress and pain in youth. Based on the strong evidence in
adults that mindfulness-based practice can have a host of
protective effects on psychosocial and neurobiological function-
ing,7,27,33,36 this intervention may be an important choice to
optimize treatment in youth with chronic pain who report stress or
trauma exposure. In fact, in light of the proposed categorization of
chronic pain as an instigator or form of toxic stress, mindfulness-
based approaches may be a more effective intervention choice
than basic CBT approaches for chronic pain rehabilitation in youth
with or without a trauma history. However, to date, no study has
directly examined this nor the potential implications of combining
aspects of mindfulness within the CBT framework for pediatric pain
management.10 In these contexts, more research is needed,
particularly treatment studies that
incorporate neurobiological
mechanism and outcome measurements, to determine the most
effective interventions for these vulnerable youth.

8. Conclusions

A host of
research has identified strong overlap between
neurobiological correlates of stress and of pain.76,78 In addition,
evidence suggests that youth with chronic pain report high rates
of ACEs,41,79,80 PTSS,77,85 and general psychological stress56,75
when compared with the general population or to matched
nonpain peers. However, research remains limited on how a
history or ongoing experiences of stress or trauma may influence

for pain management

the manifestation of chronic pain (eg, neurobiology) in youth or the
course of and response to treatment.
In parallel, evidence
indicates that a subset of youth with chronic pain fail to respond
to traditional psychotherapy
(eg,
CBT).46,103 Given that stress-exposed youth are at increased
risk for altered brain connectivity, HPA axis activation, and AL,
trauma-focused therapies, such as TF-CBT, narrative exposure,
or mindfulness-based interventions, may be more appropriate
interventions for youth experiencing chronic pain than current
therapies. Specifically, these intervention approaches, above and
beyond traditional modalities, may better interrupt any ongoing
stress response and directly target and desensitize the emotional
response, memories, and neurobiological mechanisms sur-
rounding the experience of stress and maintenance of pain.

9. Future directions

randomized clinical

Research is only just beginning to elucidate links between stress
and pain in youth. Currently, we do not have evidence
demonstrating the extent to which the overlap in neurobiological
mechanisms of stress and pain contributes to one another,
particularly in youth. Studies are needed to confirm the existence
of these associations. However, given the preliminary evidence
that stress-based neurological processes may be implicated in
pain chronicity,76,78 modifying existing psychosocial treatments
to acknowledge and actively address stress histories and their
sequelae is critical. For example,
trials
performed with CBT vs TF-CBT or MBSR in these youth are an
important next step. Preassessments and postassessments with
brain imaging and neuroendocrine biomarkers (eg, salivary
cortisol) should be conducted to confirm the impact of these
interventions at the biological
level. Evidence is also currently
unclear on which stress-based neurobiological mechanism(s)
(eg, AL or altered brain connectivity) may be the optimal
intervention target(s), especially given their strong associations
and bidirectional effects on each other. Future research should
pursue this line of inquiry because such information will inform the
development of therapeutic approaches that maximize effective-
ness and enhance decision-making around best methods for
assessing treatment outcomes. Alternative and complementary
measures of physiological effects of stress, such as telomere
attrition and DNA methylation,73,88,95 also should be explored in
this context. The results from these studies may inform the
development of new research and treatment avenues with the
goal of optimizing care for these vulnerable youth.
