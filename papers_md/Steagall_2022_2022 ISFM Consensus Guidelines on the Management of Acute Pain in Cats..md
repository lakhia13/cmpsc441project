Practical relevance:  Increases in cat ownership worldwide mean more cats are 

requiring veterinary care. Illness, trauma and surgery can result in acute pain, and 
effective management of pain is required for optimal feline welfare (ie, physical 
health and mental wellbeing). Validated pain assessment tools are available and pain 
management plans for the individual patient should incorporate pharmacological and 

non-pharmacological therapy. Preventive and multimodal analgesia, including local 
anaesthesia, are important principles of pain management, and the choice of analgesic 

drugs should take into account the type, severity and duration of pain, presence of comorbidities and 
avoidance of adverse effects. Nursing care, environmental modifications and cat friendly handling are 
likewise pivotal to the pain management plan, as is a team approach, involving the cat carer. 
Clinical challenges:  Pain has traditionally been under-recognised in cats. Pain assessment tools are not widely 
implemented, and signs of pain in this species may be subtle. The unique challenges of feline metabolism and 
comorbidities may lead to undertreatment of pain and the development of peripheral and central sensitisation. 
Lack of availability or experience with various analgesic drugs may compromise effective pain management. 
Evidence base:  These Guidelines have been created by a panel of experts and the International Society  
of Feline Medicine (ISFM) based on the available literature and the authors’ experience. They are aimed  
at general practitioners to assist in the assessment, prevention and management of acute pain in feline 
patients, and to provide a practical guide to selection and dosing of effective analgesic agents.

Introduction 

The feline population has grown significantly 
in  recent  years,  with  a  current  estimate  of 
around  70  million  pet  cats  in  the  USA  and 
Canada.1,2  These  individuals  will  require  vet-
erinary care and the majority undergo at least 
one  surgery  (ie,  elective  neutering)  during 
their lifetime. Others will have medical condi-
tions or trauma requiring hospitalisation, diag-
nostic  examinations,  intravenous  treatments 
and  palliative  care.  Effective  acute  pain  man-
agement  is  required  in  most,  if  not  all,  of  the 
above  scenarios  and  must  be  an  integral  part 
of  feline  practice.  Pain  has  a  negative  impact 
on feline welfare. It is a basic requirement that 
each  feline  practitioner 
performs  pain  assess-
ment  during  every 
physical examination, 
in addition to record-
ing  the  temperature, 
respiration 
pulse, 
(TPR) and conducting 
a  nutritional  assess-

Feline Practitioners

ment. This requires proficient recognition and 
management of pain in cats, aspects of which 
are species-specific.  

Our  knowledge  of  feline  pain  management 
has  progressed  over  recent  years.  Review  arti-
cles have been published on different aspects of 
pain management in cats.3–6 Moreover, there are 
now three scales with reported validity for acute 
feline pain assessment that take into considera-
tion  facial  expressions  and  the  cat’s  unique 
behaviour.7–10 All three provide clinical guidance 
on the need for analgesia when a cut-off value  
is  reached.  However,  rescue  interventions  may 
be  administered  even  when  the  cut-off  is  not 
reached  if  the  veterinarian  feels  that  the  cat 
could be in pain. The advent of valid pain assess-
ment systems has improved our ability to recog-
nise and assess pain in the clinical setting. It has 
also  led  to  more  robust  research  and  clinical 
studies,  and  provided  more  objective  outcome 
measures for approval of feline-specific drugs.

Figure 1  Feline friendly handling techniques should be  
used for every interaction with cats. This will ensure  
optimal healthcare by reducing the cat’s stress, improving  
personnel safety and providing a positive outcome for the 
patient, client and veterinary team. After observation of the 
cat’s normal behaviour, the patient is calmly approached  
and stroked, and the painful area is gently palpated.

We no longer rely on extrapolation of scien-
tific  information  from  dogs  for  analgesic   
techniques  and  dosage  regimens  in  cats.  The 
published  literature  contains  several  feline-
specific  pharmacokinetic–pharmaco dynamic 
studies involving analgesics. Opioids and non-
steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs) 
with market authorisation specifically for cats 
are now available to the feline practitioner, and 
cat owners have come to expect safe and effec-
tive  pain  relief  for  their  pets.11,12  Historically, 
however, 
feline  pain  management  was 
neglected.13  Thankfully  this  attitude  has 
changed  and  advancements  continue  to  be 
made,14  but  there  are  still  areas  for  improve-
ment.  For 
example,  pain  assessment 
is  not  commonly  performed  in  the  clinical   
setting and validated pain assessment tools are 
not widely implemented in small animal prac-
tice.15 Many veterinarians do not administer or 
prescribe analgesics to cats after discharge and 
following routine procedures (eg, neutering).16  
Here,  the  International  Society  of  Feline 
Medicine  (ISFM)  provides  its  first  guidelines 
on  acute  pain  management  using  current   
evidence-based  information  and  expert  con-
sensus.  The  Guidelines  identify  areas  where 
critical research is needed and emphasise pain 
management  as  a  key  component  of  feline 
welfare.  Throughout,  the  utility  of  a  multi-
modal  and  preventive  analgesic  approach  is 
highlighted,  involving  non-pharmacological 
and  pharmacological  therapy,  cat  friendly 
handling  techniques,  and  respect  and  empa-
thy for feline patients. 

Cats are unique 

and so is their 

behaviour, 

especially 

when fear, 

anxiety and 

stress are 

present in  

the hospital 
setting.

Figure 2  The hospital environment has an influence on  
the patient’s pain experience. A cat ward should be a quiet 
and comfortable area, considering the specific needs of  
this species. A hospital cage equipped with a cardboard  
box provides an elevated area where the cat can perch  
(‘a safe place’). Simple enrichment measures, such as this,  
can improve the hospital experience and reduce stress.

Assessment and recognition  
of pain in cats 

Principles of pain assessment 
Cats are unique and so is their behaviour, espe-
cially when fear, anxiety and stress are present 
in  the  hospital  setting.  The  assessment  and 
treatment of pain is only one part of the pain 
management ‘puzzle’; every manipulation and 
physical  examination  should  be  performed 
using cat friendly handling techniques (Figure 
1).17 Pain management is not only about giving 
an analgesic drug: the emotional needs of the 
hospitalised cat must be considered (Figure 2), 
and  the  individual  itself  should  always  be 
treated with respect and empathy. 

Pain  assessment  is  the  first  step  towards 
appropriate  treatment.  Failure  to  recognise 
pain is likely the primary cause of inadequate 
treatment  (oligoanalgesia;  ie,  undertreatment 
of  acute  pain).16  Recognition  of  pain  requires 
understanding of this species’ reactions with-
in  a  hospital  setting.  Signs  of  pain  may  be   
subtle and misinterpreted; for example, when 
a cat simply reduces movement and ‘freezes’ 
due to fear. However, the veterinary care team 
and  owners,  too,  can  be  trained  to  improve 
their  pain  assessment  skills  and  several   
websites  are  available  for  this  purpose.18–20   
Used  in  isolation,  physiological  variables  are 
not  reliable  in  acute  pain  assessment,  since 
they  can  be  affected  by  disease,  fear  and 
stress.21–23  However,  appetite  may  be  a  ‘pain 
indicator’, as painful individuals generally do 
not eat.24

termed 

Overall, acute pain assessment is subjective, 
although subjectivity and bias can be reduced 
with specific guidelines and assessment tools 
(see  later).  In  cats,  and  other  animals,  all 
assessments  depend  on  the  observations  of   
a  veterinary  professional  or  carer  and  hence 
are 
‘observer-related  outcomes’. 
Assessment  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to, 
observation  of  posture,  general  behaviour, 
comfort  with  interactions,  activity,  attitude, 
body  position  and  facial  expressions.  In  con-
junction with this, a dynamic and interactive 
approach is recommended, usually involving 
greeting  the  cat  while  performing  gentle   
palpation  of  the  wound  and/or  suspected 
painful area. This is an important step, other-
wise  evoked  pain  may  be  overlooked;  it 
should be possible to palpate around surgical 
wounds without a strong reaction from the cat 
if pain is well controlled (Figure 3).

tive  period  may  be  indicative  of  pain.  For

Figure 3  Clinical pain assessment incorporates 1) observations of posture, general behaviour, 
comfort, activity, attitude, body position and facial expressions, and 2) a dynamic and 
interactive approach involving greeting the animal and performing gentle palpation of the 
wound/painful area. The response elicited during touch and palpation may help with clinical 
decisions and with determining the sensory–discriminatory domain of pain (intensity, location 
and duration). (a) A healthy cat is examined prior to surgery. After observing the cat’s  
normal behaviour, the cage is opened, and the patient is gently approached and stroked.

Figure 4  (a) A cat with abdominal pain following 
ovariohysterectomy. The cat is depressed, immobile and 
silent. The patient has squinted eyes and is in a hunched-up 
position with head down. (b) A cat with abdominal pain 
secondary to constipation. The eyes are partially closed 
(‘feigned sleep’), the ears are pulled apart (ie, distance 
between the tips of the ears is increased when compared 
with a non-painful cat), and the muzzle is retracted 
backwards (whiskers are straight, not loose and curved).  
(c) Periodontal disease, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, 
causes pain, inflammation, dysphagia, chronic haemorrhage 
and weight loss. Painful cats with severe oral disease  
(eg, requiring multiple dental extractions) have decreased 
food intake, increased pain scores and present distinct 
behaviours such as reduced attention to surroundings and 
spending more time lying down, compared with pain-free 
cats with minimal periodontal disease. Following dental 
extractions, this cat scores 9/10 using the Feline Grimace 
Scale and requires the administration of opioids for pain 
relief. (d) A cat with abdominal pain can contract or extend 
its pelvic limbs and/or contracts its abdominal muscles 
(flank) spontaneously. These cats may be in dorsolateral 
recumbency with facial expressions of pain. (e) A tense and 
depressed cat in severe pain after sternotomy. This patient 
is sitting up due to intense discomfort, reluctant to move 
and not attentive to the surroundings. The cat received a 
score of 8/10 using the Feline Grimace Scale, indicating  
the need for analgesia. The cat remained uncomfortable  
and bothered by all bandages, catheters and nursing needs, 
despite infusions of opioids, ketamine and lidocaine, and  
the administration of NSAIDs and intercostal nerve blocks. 
This demonstrates that pain can be challenging to treat  
in some cases. The cat finally improved and analgesic 
infusions were tapered down before patient discharge.

(Figure 5). These individuals usually have an 
interest in their surroundings and respond to 
stroking.  Eating  and  grooming  are  normal 
behaviours  that  should  be  present  in  the   
postoperative  period  in  comfortable  cats. 
When  a  cat  is  painful,  these  behaviours  may 
quickly disappear. It is important to note that

assessment. 

Pain  assessment  is  best  performed  on  a   

regular  basis.  However,  the  cat  should  not  be 
disturbed while it is eating, grooming, playing 
and/or  sleeping.  The  frequency  of  assessment

should be determined based on the pain sever-
ity noted on the first assessment after surgery or 
trauma, the cat’s response to analgesic adminis-
tration  or  non-pharmacological  intervention 
and clinical judgement. Cats may be evaluated 
as soon as 30–45 mins after the end of surgery 
and then every hour in the initial postoperative 
period, depending on the an algesic drugs and 
techniques used. Assess ment should be contin-
ued  to  ensure  comfort  and  until  the  patient  is 
discharged.26  After  discharge,  assessment  can 
continue at home with 
cat  carers  trained  to 
look for signs of pain.  
A detailed review of 
feline 
acute  pain 
assessment  is  avail-
able elsewhere.5 

Frequency of pain assessment  
Patient status, type of surgery or medical condi-
tion,  pain  severity,  hospitalisation,  individual 
responses to analgesia, age, temperament, illness 
and residual anaesthetic effects will all dictate the 
frequency of pain assessment.

Pain assessment tools 
The use of pain assessment tools allows a con-
sistent,  practical  and  more  objective  approach 
to  pain  evaluation.  In  a  busy  clinical  setting 
when  several  team  members  participate  in 
pain  assessment,  use  of  a  structured  tool 
reduces inter-observer variability.  

There are now three user-friendly pain assess-
ment tools with reported validity in cats (Table 
2): the Glasgow composite measure pain scale-
feline,7  the  UNESP-Botucatu  multi dimensional 
feline pain assessment scale short form (Table 3) 
and the Feline Grimace Scale.7–9,24,28–32 The chal-
lenges  facing  us  are  how  to  disseminate  this 
information,  how  best  to  incorporate  these 
tools/systems into practice and how to train the 
veterinary  clinic  team.  Facial  expressions  are 
incorporated  into  all  three  of  these  acute  pain 
assessment  tools;  the  Feline  Grimace  Scale 
(felinegrimacescale.com)  is  based  entirely  on 
facial  ‘action  units’  (Figure  6).8,29,30,33  These 
scales provide a cut-off/intervention score that 
suggests administration of analgesia is required 
(Table  2).  Guidance  to  assist  the  veterinary 
nurse  or  technician  in  advocating  for  their 
patient, and the clinician with decision-making, 
is a clear benefit of using pain assessment tools. 
If  the  cat  receives  rescue  intervention(s),  pain 
assessment  is  repeated  after  30–45  mins  to 
ensure that treatment has been effective. 

Limitations and factors affecting  
pain assessment/recognition 
The  advent  of  novel  pain  assessment  systems 
has improved our ability to recognise and treat 
pain in cats. However, these instruments have 
not fully eliminated potential confounding fac-
tors  and  bias.  Temperament  (fearful,  shy,  etc), 
the administration of some drugs (eg, sedatives 

The use of pain assessment 

tools allows a consistent, 

practical and more  

objective approach

may still be evaluated using the

observation of posture, comfort 
and facial expressions. Treatment 
of pain should be performed 
using a multimodal approach, 
based on the observer’s 
interpretation of how painful the

or  tranquillisers)  and  illness  can  still  pose   
challenges  during  pain  assessment.34–37  Fear 
and  anxiety  may  bias  pain  assessment  due  to 
changes in posture, comfort and facial expres-
sions.38 For example, pain assessment can be a 
challenge  in  unsocialised  cats  in  trap–neuter– 
return programmes (Figure 7). The administra-
tion  of  ketamine-based  protocols  produces  a 
confounding effect early in the recovery period 
and  may  falsely  increase  pain  scores,  which 
could  lead  to  unnecessary  administration  of 
rescue  analgesia.39  Residual  anaesthetic  and 
drug  effects  may  also  bias  pain  assessment. 
Pain  may  be  difficult  to  differentiate  from 
drug-induced dysphoria (see box). 

Pain  scores  may  be  influenced  by  the   
gender,  training,  cultural  background  and   
language of the observer, demonstrating that 
pain  assessment  is  not  an  exact  science  and 
differences  may  be  expected.34–36  It  has  been 
found that females and those with more train-
ing will provide higher pain scores than males 
and  those  with  minimal  training.13,34,36  Feline 
pain  assessment  should  be  integrated  into   
the veterinary curriculum in conjunction with 
cat friendly handling techniques. 

Cat  carers  should  be  considered  part  of  the 
‘team’  when  it  comes  to  pain  management. 
Client  education  regarding  pain  behaviours 
(what to expect and how to proceed) is impor-
tant  and  could  lead  to  early  intervention  by 
prompting  the  client  to  seek  veterinary  atten-
tion.5 For example, cat owners can identify spe-
cific  behavioural  alterations  up  to  3  days  after 
castration  or  ovariohysterectomy.42  A  decrease 
in  overall  activity  level  and  playfulness,  an 
increase  in  the  amount  of  time  spent  sleeping, 
and altered locomotion were reported by these 
owners.42 ISFM has produced a Cat Carer Guide 
to  acute  pain  in  cats  (see  page  30).  Finally,  the 
Feline Grimace Scale can be used reliably by cat 
owners, veterinary nurses and students, provid-
ing  the  first  feline  acute  pain  assessment  tool 
that  may  be  used  in  the  home  environment33 
and  by  non-veterinarians,  thereby  paving  the 
way towards better feline welfare.

If pain is suspected based on surgery and/or the presence of a medical con-
dition,  the  administration  of  analgesics  such  as  an  opioid,  or  NSAID  (if  not 
given  within  the  previous  24  h),  is  recommended  (ie,  ‘analgesic  challenge’).   
If pain behaviours subside it confirms that pain was present. No changes or 
worsening of these behaviours could indicate dysphoria. At this time adminis-
tration  of  a  sedative  is  recommended.  The  use  of  opioid  antagonists  could 
also be part of treatment; however, analgesic effects may also be antagonised, 
and the cat could become painful if other analgesic modalities are not in place. 
Butorphanol has been administered as an alternative to naloxone for the rever-
sal of opioid agonists, as it may preserve analgesia better than the latter.40 

A  ‘troubleshooting  dysphoria’  algorithm,  with  recommended  treatment 
steps  for  dealing  with  a  dysphoric  cat,  is  available  in  the  supplementary 
material  (see  page  24),  reproduced  from  the  AAFP  Feline  Anesthesia 
Guidelines published in 2018.41

Treatment of pain – principles 
and considerations 

(Table  4).44 

Failure  to  recognise  and  adequately  treat 
acute  pain  is  known  as  oligoanalgesia. 
The  lack  of  analgesic  administration  to  a 
painful  cat  may  lead  to  the  development  of 
peripheral and central sensitisation,16,43 which 
in turn can reduce the nociceptive threshold to 
non-noxious  and  noxious

to  chronic  or

(ie,  persistent  postoperative 
pain),  leading  to  disability 
and  a  negative  impact  on 
quality  of  life.  A  similar   
scenario may occur in cats;43 
for  example,  after  onychec-
tomy (Figure 8).

Understanding  the  principles  of  acute  pain 
management  aids  in  the  development  of   
an  effective  analgesic  strategy  and  can 
mitigate  or  prevent  oligoanalgesia  and 
adverse  outcomes  in  cats,  a  species  in  which 
analgesic administration has historically been 
neglected. 

Feline drug metabolism and elimination: 
impact on analgesia 
Drug  metabolism  and  elimination  are  differ-
ent in cats compared with other species. This 
has  a  significant  influence  on  drug  choice, 
dose and dosing intervals of analgesics. Drugs 
that  are  eliminated  by  metabolic  conjugation 
(ie,  glucuronidation,  sulfation  and/or  glyco-
sylation) are usually excreted more slowly in 
cats  than  in  humans  or  dogs.47  Examples 
include  acetylsalicylic  acid,  acetaminophen 
(paracetamol),  carprofen,  ketoprofen  and 
morphine.  Deficient  glucuronidation  has  sig-
nificant  effects  on  phenolic  compounds  such 
as  acetaminophen,  resulting  in  life-threaten-
ing  methaemoglobinaemia  due  to  oxidative 
injury  to  erythrocytes,  anaemia  and  Heinz 
body  formation.47,48  The  clearance  of  carpro-
fen is significantly slower in cats than in dogs  
(ie,  the  drug  has  a  much  longer  elimination 
in  cats).49  The  deficient  UDP- 
half-life 
glucuronosyltransferase  (UGT)  pathways  in 
cats may also be responsible for reduced mor-
phine glucuronidation in cats. Cats eliminate 

morphine  at  a  similar  rate  to  dogs;  however, 
they  produce  lower  concentrations  of  mor-
phine-3-glucuronide,  and  do  not  produce 
morphine-6-glucuronide, an active metabolite 
responsible for analgesia in humans.50  

Conversely, drugs that primarily undergo oxi-
dation are often eliminated more rapidly in cats 
compared with dogs. Examples include meloxi-
cam,  piroxicam,  buprenorphine  and  meperi-
dine (pethidine). The major route of elimination 
of  meloxicam  in  cats  is  via  the  gut  (faeces), 
which is similar to dogs; the main pathway of 
meloxicam biotransformation is oxidation.51,52  
Drugs  that  are  excreted  unchanged  into 
urine and/or bile such as gabapentin have sim-
ilar elimination half-lives in dogs and cats.47 

Feline comorbidities 
The presence of comorbidities must be consid-
ered in the treatment of pain. As many as 40% 
of  cats  over  10  years  of  age  have  chronic   
kidney disease (CKD).53 Drugs or metabolites 
that require healthy kidney function for excre-
tion  may  accumulate  in  cats  with  CKD. 
Therefore,  doses  and  dosing  intervals  may 
require adjustment and this will be based on 
clinical experience, the patient’s response and 
pain assessment. The effects of drugs may not 
in  addition  to 
be  predictable  because, 
decreased  renal  elimination  in  the  face  of 
CKD, azotaemia increases blood–brain barrier 
permeability,  which  can  result  in  a  more 
enhanced drug effect. A classic example is the 
metabolism  of  ketamine  by  the  liver  into  the 
active  metabolite  norketamine,  which  is 
excreted  by  the  kidneys  in  its  active  form 
along with ketamine itself. Ketamine and nor-
ketamine  accumulation  may  occur,  with 
potential prolonged anaesthetic effects in cats 
with  urethral  obstruction  or  kidney  dysfunc-
tion. Metabolic acidosis in cats with CKD can 
alter the biodisposition of ketamine, resulting 
in  accumulation.  Outcomes  may  depend  on 
dose  since  accumulation  does  not  appear  to   
be  a  problem  with  the  administration  of   
subanaesthetic  (anti-hyperalgesic)  doses  of 
ketamine  given  by  infusion  (10  µg/kg/min) 
as  a  component  of  a  postoperative  analgesic 
regimen  after  feline  subcutaneous  urethral 
bypass when renal function is improving.27 

Overall, best practice with respect to anaes-
thesia and analgesia is particularly important 
in cats with comorbidities. The administration 
of fluid therapy will correct dehydration and 
electrolyte and acid–base abnormalities while 
maintaining  adequate  renal  blood  flow  dur-
ing  anaesthesia  and  supporting  drug  excre-
tion.  In  some  cases,  the  administration  of  a 
minimum effective dose of an NSAID can be 
considered  for  normovolaemic  cats  with   
stable  renal  disease  (International  Renal 
Interest Society [IRIS] stage I or II) undergoing

Principles of acute pain management

Preventive analgesia  
Preventive analgesia refers to all types of perioperative techniques and efforts to decrease postoperative pain. 
Analgesic treatment is administered at any time and for any duration needed for pain relief in the periopera-
tive period. (Note that ‘pre-emptive’ analgesia refers to the administration of analgesics prior to surgery.) 

Multimodal analgesia  
Multimodal  analgesia  is  the  administration  of  two  or  more  analgesic  drugs  with  different  mechanisms  of  action.  These  drug   
combinations may have a synergistic effect, allowing use of lower doses for each class and consequently preventing treatment-
induced adverse drug reactions.55,56 Multimodal analgesia may also include non-pharmacological techniques such as applica-
tion of cooling/cold therapy. 

surgery  with  a  strong  inflammatory  compo-
nent (eg, multiple dental extractions, fracture 
repair, large excisions) once blood pressure is 
controlled  and  there  is  no  risk  of  intraopera-
tive  haemorrhage.  Ideally,  the  cat  should  be 
eating and drinking after anaesthetic recovery 
before the administration of an NSAID.54 

Building an analgesic plan 
Building  an  effective  analgesic  plan  relies  on 
two fundamental principles: preventive analge‑
sia and multimodal analgesia (see box above).   
The  first  step  of  acute  pain  treatment 
involves  the  administration  of  opioids,  local 

anaesthetics and NSAIDs. The second step of 
treatment  involves  the  administration  of   
adjuvant analgesics.57 Further therapy should 
focus  on  analgesia  and  comfort,  while  min-
imising adverse drug reactions and preventing 
deleterious  endocrine  and  physiological 
responses.  Additional  steps  of  equal  impor-
tance  include  anxiolysis  and  muscle  relax-
ation,  antiemetics  and  non-pharmacological 
therapy,  which  should  be  incorporated  when 
needed

Treatment  will  be  determined  by  the  type, 
location,  severity  and  expected  duration  of 
stimuli, and whether the cat is an inpatient or 
outpatient.  The  analgesic  plan  will  be  based 
on these key concepts, which can be referred 
to  using  the  acronym  ‘TELLS’  (Table  5  and 
Figure  11).  For  example,  acute  visceral  pain 
associated with elective procedures (eg, feline 
neutering)  may  be  treated  effectively  with 
NSAIDs,  opioids,  alpha‑2  agonists64,65  and 
local  anaesthetic  techniques  (eg,  intratesticu-
lar,  incisional,  intraperitoneal  or  transversus

elsewhere.67,68 
<  Opioid  of  preference,  depending  on  the  type  of  surgery/ 
painful condition For example, full agonists of µ-opioid receptors 
(eg, methadone, fentanyl) provide dose-dependent analgesia and 
are  preferred  for  moderate  to  severe  pain.  Buprenorphine  (a   
partial µ-opioid agonist) can be used for mild to moderate pain  

as  part  of  a  multimodal  analgesia  protocol.  Butorphanol  and   
nalbuphine  (agonist–antagonist  opioids)  provide  limited  analge-
sia (see below discussion of ‘Opioids’). 
<  Potential for use of NSAIDs If there are no contraindications 
for  the  administration  of  NSAIDs  (eg,  meloxicam,  ketoprofen, 
robenacoxib),  these  drugs  are  excellent  analgesics  and  should 
be included in the analgesia strategy for almost all forms of acute 
perioperative pain because surgery results in inflammation.  
<  Requirement  for  adjuvant  analgesics  Adjuvant  analgesics 
(ketamine,  gabapentinoids,  tramadol,  etc)  are  administered  for 
the treatment of severe acute pain and prevention of persistent 
postoperative pain, especially if NSAIDs are contraindicated.  
<  Duration  of  acute  perioperative  pain  Acute  perioperative 
pain often lasts beyond the duration of the cat’s hospital stay and 
routinely  requires  transitioning  from  parenteral  to  oral  or  trans-

antagonists  (eg,  ketamine,  amantadine)  and 
gabapentinoids.  

The expected duration and severity of pain 
also  determines  which  analgesic  drugs  are 
best suited for each individual patient. In cats 
with  prolonged  moderate  to  severe  pain,   
pain  management  can  be  performed  with 
intermittent  doses  of  buprenorphine66  or 
methadone. Alternatives include constant rate 
infusions (CRIs) of opioids and/or ketamine. 
Specific  classes  of  analgesics  are  discussed 
below.

treatment may affect the frequency and route 
of  administration.  Hospitals  without  after-

in the box above.  

Treatment of pain – analgesic 
drugs 

Opioids 
Opioids  are  commonly  used  analgesics  for 
acute  pain  in  cats.14,69  By  binding  to  opioid 
receptors  located  within  the  peripheral  and 
central  nervous  system  they  decrease  the 
release  of  excitatory  neurotransmitters, 
hyperpolarise  the  neuronal  post-synaptic  cell 
membrane,70–73  inhibit  Ca2+  influx  in  afferent 
sensory  neurons,  and  activate  the  descending 
inhibitory  pathways.  The  net  result 
is 
an  antinociceptive  effect,  thus  producing   
analgesia.

Behav ioural changes (eg, fear, anxiety, vocalisation, 
dysphoria)  can  be  observed  when  unnecessarily 
high doses of opioids are given in the conscious cat 
and  were  the  basis  for  the  term  ‘morphine   

At  high  doses,  opioids  evoke  a  sympathetic 
response  in  cats  that  is  mediated  by  autonomic 
centres  in  the  brain,  spinal  cord  and  adrenal 
glands.81  This  produces  mydriasis  and  increases   
in  blood  pressure  and 
heart  rate  (which  may   
be  observed  with  high 
doses during surgery and 
confused  with  nocicep-
tive  stimulation),  as  well 
as adrenal vein hormone 
levels  (ie,  nor adrenaline,

and  met-enkephalin81).

ity  and  analgesic  efficacy.  Opioids  can  be 
given  by  a  variety  of  routes  and  can  reduce 
the  minimum  alveolar  concentration  (MAC) 
of volatile anaesthetics, potentially improving 
cardiopulmonary  function  during  general 
anaesthesia.74 However, their ability to reduce

MAC  in  cats  when  administered  parenteral-
ly75,76  or  epidurally  is  lower  than  in  dogs.   
For  example,  high  doses  of  remifentanil 
reduce  isoflurane  requirements  by  a  maxi-
mum of 25% in cats,77,78 compared with 79% in 
dogs.79 In cats, additional anaesthetic sparing 
can  be  achieved  with  the  inclusion  of 
ketamine infusions.80

Vomiting and nausea commonly occur, 
particularly with IM or SC route. Opioid-
induced hyperthermia occurs more 
frequently with the use of high doses  
of hydromorphone, either alone or in 
combination with other anaesthetic drugs. 
Increases in temperature are generally mild 
to moderate and are self-limiting (<4 h)

Should not be administered IV due to 
histamine release with potential skin 
reactions and hypotension. Duration  
of analgesia is short-lived and dose-
dependent. Licensed for IM injection  
in European countries, including the UK 

Has NMDA receptor antagonistic effect, 
which may be helpful to treat peripheral 
and central sensitisation. Minimal vomiting 
and nausea when compared with 
hydromorphone and morphine 
administration. Higher doses are used for 
OTM administration, whereas lower doses 
are given IV. Licensed for use in cats in  
the UK, Canada, Italy and some other 
European countries

Low doses are used for analgesia, 
whereas high doses may also provide 
some (15–20%) anaesthetic-sparing effect 
with potential simultaneous sympathetic 
activation.  
Plasma concentrations are highly variable 
with use of transdermal patches (human 
formulations) of fentanyl in cats. Analgesia 
is variable and may be suboptimal. Apply 
fentanyl patch 18–24 h prior to noxious 
stimuli

Low doses are used for analgesia, 
whereas high doses may also provide 
some (15–20%) anaesthetic-sparing effect 
with potential simultaneous sympathetic 
activation. Loading doses of remifentanil 
are not required if started 15 mins prior to 
surgical stimulation. May contribute to 
opioid-induced hyperalgesia; however, 
this has not been confirmed in cats.  
Does not require hepatic metabolism;

Table 6 presents suggested dosage regimens 
for  commonly  used  opioid  analgesics,  with 
comments  on  their  clinical  relevance,  advan-
tages and disadvantages. Choosing an opioid 
analgesic is dependent on the patient’s signal-
ment,  temperament,  comorbidities,  degree  of 
pain  intensity  and  required  sedation  level, 
and is also determined by the planned proce-

dure,  the  pharmacology  of  the  opioid  itself 
(onset, magnitude and duration of action) and 
what  the  clinician  has  access  to  in  their  loca-
tion. Kittens and young cats may require more 
frequent  opioid  dosing.  One  study  showed 
that age can influence thermal antinociception 
produced  by  opioids  in  cats.88  Specifically, 
hydromorphone  provided  a  shorter  duration 
and  smaller  magnitude  of  antinociception  in 
cats of 6 months of age than in the same indi-
viduals at 9 and 12 months of age.88

in cats in the UK, Canada, Australia and 
other countries. The high-concentration 
formulation is FDA-approved in the USA

Provides appropriate analgesia when used 
in a multimodal protocol for orchiectomy. 
Does not provide adequate analgesia when 
used as a sole analgesic for routine surgical 
procedures. Higher doses do not provide 
additional analgesic benefit. Large inter-
patient variability in analgesia has been 
reported. May be a better alternative than 
naloxone when reversing (0.02–0.05 mg/kg 
IV) pure opioid receptor agonists due to its 
ability to preserve some antinociception

May be a substitute for when butorphanol 
is unavailable. Minimal research has been 
performed to evaluate effectiveness for 
acute pain management. Dose to provide 
analgesia is yet to be determined

Fast administration of 0.04 mg/kg IV can 
produce depressed mentation and dullness 
(B Simon, personal observations). 
Administer slowly in small increments every 
60 s and to effect. Analgesia will be reversed 
and other analgesic techniques and drugs 
must be considered if pain is an issue

*Doses, drugs and routes of administration presented in this table are suggestions and not exhaustive. Individual variability should be appreciated 
and opioids are better administered as part of multimodal analgesia. The analgesic effects may be variable depending on the type of pain, age, 
breed, surgical procedure, anaesthetic duration and route of administration. Clinical judgement is important. Veterinarians should consult drug labels

Routes of administration 
Traditionally,  opioids  are  administered  by   
the  intramuscular  (IM)  or  intravenous  (IV) 
route.  The  onset,  magnitude  and  duration  of 
analgesia  are  influenced  by  the  route  of 
administration, which should be chosen on an 
individual basis.89 The IV route provides reli-
able  analgesia  and  a  rapid  onset  of  action.   
The subcutaneous (SC) route of administration 
provides  less  pain  on  injection  than  the  IM 
route;90  however,  depending  on  the  drug, 
dosage and formulation, large variations in the 
magnitude  and  duration  of  antinociception 
may  be  observed.82–84  For  example,  analgesia 
may be suboptimal after the SC administration 
of  recommended  doses  of  buprenorphine  or 
hydromorphone  in  cats.84  In  contrast,  a  high-
concentration  formulation  of  buprenorphine 
(1.8 mg/ml; Simbadol, Zoetis) is approved by 
the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  and 
provides up to 24 h of mild to moderate pain 
relief  following  SC  administration  (Table  6).85 
This  formulation  is  also  effective  when  given 
to cats by the IV or oral transmucosal (OTM) 
route  (off-label  administration),  both  provid-
ing up to 8 h of analgesia.85 The OTM route is 
a  non-invasive  alternative  to  parenteral 
administration. It bypasses the first-pass effect 
in  the  liver,  leading  to  higher  bioavailability 
when  compared  with  oral  administration. 
Variations in analgesia may still occur via the 
OTM route, and thus the IM or IV route is pre-
ferred  when  possible  for  acute  postoperative 
pain management.82  

In cats, plasma drug concentrations follow-
ing  application  of  a  transdermal  fentanyl 
patch  (a  human  product)  are  highly  variable 
and may fail to produce analgesia.91,92 A trans-
dermal matrix patch of buprenorphine failed 
to produce thermal antinociception, with high 
plasma  concentration  variability  of  the  drug, 
in a preliminary study of pharmacokinetics in 
cats.93  

Epidural  administration  of  opioids  alone 
(eg,  morphine  or  buprenorphine94)  provides 
effective  control  of  visceral95  and  somatic96 
pain, with few adverse effects97–99 and without 
changes  in  proprioception.  The  bladder 
should be gently expressed before anaesthetic 
recovery  to  avoid  the  rare  but  reported  side 
effect  of  urinary  retention  after  the  adminis-
tration  of  epidural  morphine.96,100  Regardless 
of which analgesic drugs are administered, an 
empty  bladder  may  improve  comfort  during 
the early recovery period.

Adverse drug reactions 
Some  opioids  may  produce  adverse  effects, 
which  are  drug-,  dose-  and  route-dependent 
(Table  6).  Nausea  and  vomiting  (Figure  12), 
gastro     esophageal 
hyperthermia, 
dysphoria,  mydriasis  (Figure  12),  sedation, 
vagally induced bradycardia, and respiratory 
depression  with  mild  hypercapnia  may 
be  observed  following  the  administration  of 
opioids.  Antiemetics  (maropi-
tant, ondansetron), prokinetics 
(metoclopramide),  and  acu -
puncture101  can  minimise  or 
treat some of the adverse gas-
trointestinal (GI) effects associ-
ated  with  the  administration 
of  opioids.102–105  These  GI 
adverse effects can be avoided 
by  choosing  methadone,  fen-
tanyl  or  buprenorphine.  The 
administration  of  epidural 
opioids  provides  effective 
long-term  analgesia  with  few 
side  effects.98,99  Naloxone  or 
butorphanol  may  be  adminis-
tered to effect when antagonis-
ing  opioid-induced  adverse 
effects.  Analgesia  may  also   
be  decreased  or  antagonised   
in  this  scenario  and  other   
analgesic techniques should be 
in place or considered. 

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  
NSAIDs are used extensively in cats for their 
analgesic,  anti-inflammatory  and  antipyretic 
effects, and are crucial in the control of post-
operative pain. After any contraindication for 
their  use  has  been  ruled  out  (GI  disease, 
NSAID intolerance, unmanaged renal disease, 
hepatic  disease,  coagulopathies,  hypovol -
aemia and hypotension, concurrent NSAID or 
corticosteroid  administration),  NSAIDs  are 
highly effective for the treatment of acute pain 
in cats as part of a multimodal approach.106–114 
Recommended NSAID regimens for manage-
ment of acute pain in cats are summarised in 
Table 7.  

Adverse effects (GI irritation, protein-losing 
enteropathy and nephrotoxicity) are reported 
when recommended doses or dosing intervals 
are not adhered to, or if NSAIDs are adminis-
tered  in  combination  with  corticosteroids. 
Anorexia,  inappetence,  diarrhoea,  vomiting 
and  depression  are  usually  the  first  signs  of 
toxicity,  and  treatment  should  be  stopped 
immediately  if  any  of  these  occur.  However, 
omitting  NSAIDs  because  of  fear  of  adverse 
effects is not recommended and may serious-
ly compromise pain management.  

Dosing  should  be  based  on  lean  body 
weight  and  cats  should  be  normovolaemic

NSAID  administration  and  this  should  be 
considered on a case-by-case basis.115 

Meloxicam  and  robenacoxib  have  good 
palatability, which facilitates treatment compli-
ance,113,117 and once a day dosing also increases 
the  likelihood  of  the  cat  receiving  the  pre-
scribed medication. Injectable formulations are 
used  in  the  perioperative  period  and  can  be 
administered IV (off-label use) or SC, depend-
ing on the drug used and country. Oral admin-
istration  usually  follows  in  the  postoperative 
period  and  home  environment.  Many  studies 
have  shown  that  different  perioperative 
NSAIDs  usually  perform  similarly  in  terms   
of analgesic efficacy and duration of effect (ie, 
non-inferiority or comparison trials).110,111,113 

The  timing  of  NSAID  administration  is  a 
controversial  subject.  NSAIDs  can  generally 
be  administered  preoperatively  for  routine 
neutering  of  healthy  cats,  especially  if  blood 
pressure  is  monitored  and  cats  are  normo -
volaemic.  For  longer  procedures,  fluid  thera-
py  may  be  indicated,  blood  pressure  should 
be monitored, and the risks and benefits relat-
ed  to  the  timing  of  NSAID  administration 
need  to  be  taken  into  consideration.107  The

comorbidities  such  as  CKD  was  discussed  in 
the  earlier  section  ‘Feline  drug  metabolism 
and elimination: impact on analgesia’. 

Local anaesthetics  
Local anaesthesia provides excellent analgesia 
by preventing transduction and transmission 
of  nociceptive  signals  from  the  periphery  to 
spinal  and  supraspinal  centres.118  Compared 
with other antinociceptive drugs, local anaes-
thetics  are  unique  in  providing  complete   
analgesia.  Locoregional  anaesthesia  is  an 
important  part  of  multimodal  analgesia  and 
should  be  incorporated  into  a  pain  manage-
ment  plan  whenever  possible.  Anaesthetic 
maintenance and recovery are usually smooth 
when these techniques are integrated into the 
plan. Other advantages of locoregional  anaes-
thesia  include  low  cost,  accessibility  in  all 
countries,  muscle  relaxation,  decreases  in 
injectable  and  volatile  anaesthetic  require-
ments,  and,  in  turn,  improved  cardiopul-
the 
monary 
effects of long-acting local anaesthetics extend 
into the postoperative period, and reduce the 
requirements  for  other  drugs.121,123  Recently,

approved for use in cats undergoing onychec-
tomy in the USA and may provide postopera-

*The duration of a block may vary depending on the block, technique, site of injection,

perioperative pain, particularly during ortho -
paedic procedures or hindlimb amputation. In 
cats, the spinal cord and dural sac terminate at 
the  first  (S1)  and  third  (S3)  sacral  vertebra, 
respectively,  while  the  end  of  the  conus 
medullaris  is  located  within  the  sacral  canal 
(Figure 13).128 These anatomical features make 
the  risk  of  intrathecal  drug  administration 
more likely compared with dogs.128  

Sacrococcygeal  epidural  anaesthesia  has 
been  used  as  an  alternative  to  lumbosacral 
epidural  injections  for  cats  with  urethral 
obstruction (Figure 14).129,130 A sacrococcygeal 
technique  using  bupivacaine  or  bupiva-
caine/morphine  reduced  propofol  require-
ments  and  extended  the  time  to  rescue   
analgesia  in  these  cats.129  Anatomical  and 
ultrasonographic studies have shown that the 
depth  of  needle  insertion  for  sacrococcygeal 
epidural anaesthesia is approximately 0.6 cm 
in cats, whereas the distance between skin and 
the ligamentum flavum is 1 cm 
at the lumbosacral space.131 The 
epidural  space  is  small  in  cats 
but  the  technique  can  provide 
excellent  perioperative  analge-
sia  and  be  performed  safely.

lation  has  been  used  off-label  for  incisional 
anaesthesia (see later).124 

Commonly  used  local  anaesthetics  are  pre-
sented in Table 8.118,125 Local anaesthetic toxicity 
can  result  in  severe  neurological  signs,  cardio -
respiratory  collapse  and  death.  There fore,   
calculation  of  doses,  which  must  always  be 
accurately drawn up into syringes, is particular-
ly important in cats due to their small size, espe-
cially with bupivacaine due to its cardiotoxicity. 
Accidental intravascular administration can be 
avoided  by  applying  negative  pressure  to  the 
syringe  plunger  before  injection118,125  and 
repositioning  the  needle  if  blood  is  obtained. 
The  most  serious  adverse  effect  reported  for 
local  anaesthetics  is  cardiac  arrest  and  intra-
venous  administration  of  lipid  emulsion  may 
reverse bupivacaine-induced toxicity.127

Selected local and regional 
anaesthetic techniques 
Several  local  anaesthetic  tech-
niques  have  been  reported  in 
cats,  including  sophisticated   
ultrasound-guided  techniques, 
allowing  a  better  understand-
ing  of  anatomical  landmarks, 
and improved safety and effica-
cy. These Guidelines provide an 
overview of easy-to-use, select-
ed  techniques  with  immediate 
application  in  feline  practice 
(Table 9).

Topical local anaesthesia 
The  administration  of  topical  anaesthesia  is 
simple  and  effective.  In  one  study  of  cats 
undergoing radical mastectomy, topical appli-
cation  of  2  mg/kg  bupivacaine  in  30  ml  of 
saline 0.9% via impregnated gauze decreased 
pain scores at 4 h postoperatively.133 
Although  placing  an  intravenous 

catheter may seem a minor pro-
cedure,  it  should  be  remem-
bered that each painful pro-
cedure a cat undergoes can 
have  an  additive  effect 
and, 
therefore,  every 
opportunity  should  be 
taken  to  decrease  pain

Incisional and intraperitoneal analgesia  
The  World  Small  Animal  Veterinary 
Association  (WSAVA)  Global  Pain  Council 
recently  published  an  evidence-based  review 
on  incisional  (Figure  16)  and  intraperitoneal 
(Figure 17) techniques.137 Readers are referred  
to  that  resource  for  a  detailed  discussion  of 
indications  and  recommendations  for  use,   
as  well  as  limitations.  These  techniques   
should be incorporated into multimodal pain 
management.132,138–143

Figure 17  Intraperitoneal administration of local anaesthetic 
is performed before ovariectomy/ovariohysterectomy and 
other abdominal procedures. Local anaesthetics with a longer 
duration of action (ie, bupivacaine) are used, and the solution 
is divided into three parts, which are ‘splashed’ over the right 
and left ovarian pedicles and at the caudal aspect of the 
uterine body (arrows) using a 3 ml syringe. The solution is 
quickly absorbed by the peritoneum. A technique involving 
injecting bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) at the ovarian suspensory 
ligaments and vessels, uterine body and incisional 
subcutaneous tissues has also been described;132 it resulted 
in lower postoperative pain scores compared with a control 
group and was most beneficial in larger cats (>2.7 kg).

Figure 18  Intratesticular block. 
The needle is inserted into the 
centre of the testis and 0.1–0.25 
ml of local anaesthetic is 
injected per testicle (a; b [needle 
A]). During injection the testis 
will become firm. The 
intratesticular injection can be 
combined with subcutaneous 
incisional infiltration, which is 
applied bilaterally at the scrotum 
(b [needle B]). The higher volume  
is used for larger testes while  
the lower volume is administered 
in kittens (c). Images (a) and (c)

Intratesticular block 
Intratesticular  anaesthesia  is  a  simple  tech-
nique  that  may  decrease  sympathetic  and 
haemodynamic  responses  during  feline  cas-
tration (Figure 18).120,144,145 It can be combined 
with  incisional  anaesthesia  for  complete 
antinociception  (Figure  18b  [needle  B]).  This 
technique should be performed under general 
anaesthesia or deep sedation, as injection and 
distension of the testicle can be painful.  

Dental blocks 
There are many blocks that can be used for a 
variety  of  dental  and  oral  procedures  includ-
ing  extractions,  oral  mass  removal,  biopsies, 
maxillectomy and mandibulectomy. Injections 
are  performed  using  25–27  G  needles  and   
volumes  of  lidocaine  of  0.1–0.3  ml  at  each 
nerve;25,125,146  however,  the  total  dose  guide-
lines  (mg/kg,  Table  8)  must  be  adhered  to.   
The final injectate volume will depend on the 
number of dental blocks to be performed. Care 
must be taken to carefully track the amount of 
drug  administered,  especially  when  injecting 
at multiple sites. 

The  infraorbital  nerve  block  is  shown  in 
Figure 19 (needle A) and Figure 20. The max-
illary nerve courses through the inferior peri-
orbita and enters the infraorbital canal, where 
it  becomes  the  infraorbital  nerve.147,148  The 
needle  should  be  inserted  with  caution  into 
the infraorbital canal, no further than 4–5 mm,  
to avoid the risk of penetration of the eyeball,

Adjuvant analgesic drugs 

<  Alpha-2 agonists are useful in the periop-
erative  period  for  premedication/sedation/ 
chemical  restraint153  as  they  also  provide   
muscle  relaxation  and  some  analgesia. 
Sedation/anxiolysis  may  reduce  the  overall 
‘pain  experience’.  Drugs  with  higher  specifi -
city  for  the  alpha-2  adrenergic  receptors 
(medetomidine  and  dexmedetomidine)  are 
preferred  over  xylazine.  Alpha-2  agonists 
should not be used as ‘stand-alone’ analgesics, 
but rather incorporated into multimodal pro-
tocols. However, their use should be reserved 
for  cats  with  stable  cardiovascular  function. 
Antagonists  of  alpha-2  adrenergic  receptors 
(eg,  atipamezole)  should  always  be  available 
for drug reversal and may be required during 
prolonged recoveries or when cardiovascular 
collapse is observed. 
<  Metamizole (dipyrone) is a phenolic com-
pound  and  atypical  NSAID  with  COX-1  and 
some  COX-2  anti-inflammatory  activity.154 
The drug has potent analgesic effects that may 
be  due  to  central  inhibition  of  the  COX-3 
enzyme.155  Activation  of  the  opioid  and 
cannabinoid  systems  is  also  a  possible 
mechanism  of  action  for  metamizole.156  This   
is  a  popular  analgesic  drug,  particularly  in 
South  America,  where  it  has  been  used  for 
perioperative  pain  management  in  dogs  and 
cats  undergoing  ovariohysterectomy.154,157,158 
In cats, the pharmacokinetics of the two major 
metabolites  of  metamizole  were  described 
after  IV,  IM  and  PO  administration  (25 
mg/kg).  Salivation  and  vomiting  were 
observed  in  four  and  two  (out  of  six)  cats   
after  IV  and  IM  administration,  respective-
ly.159  However,  a  further  study  did  not 
report  these  adverse  effects  after  IV  metami-
zole  (25  mg/kg  q8,  12  or  24  h).  Indeed,  the 
administration  of  metamizole  did  not

produce  any  clinically  relevant  effects  on 
Heinz body formation, biochemical profile or 
oxidation  markers 
in  cats  undergoing 
ovariohysterectomy,  although  neither  did  it 
have  an  additional  analgesic  effect 
in 
this  study  in  cats  receiving  injectable  tra-
madol.158  In  another  investigation,  metami-
zole  induced  sialorrhoea  when  administered 
orally  (drops)  in  the  home  environment  to   
cats  following  ovariohysterectomy;  rescue   
analgesia was required for some cats receiving 
either  12.5  mg/kg  q12h  or  25  mg/kg  q24h, 
showing  that  unimodal  therapy  (similar   
to  meloxicam)  may  not  induce  adequate   
analgesia.154 
<  Gabapentin  binds  to  voltage-gated  calci-
um channels, but other mechanisms of action 
have  been  identified  including  activation  of 
the  descending  noradrenergic  inhibitory  sys-
tem.160  The  drug  has  high  bioavailability  in 
cats (90–95%) following oral administration of 
10 mg/kg; peak plasma concentrations occur 
at  between  45  mins  and  2  h,  and  elimination 
half-lives were reported to be between 3 and  
4 h.161,162 Repeated dosing did not affect termi-
nal  half-life  and  other  pharmacokinetic 
parameters.161  

Transdermal  administration  of  drugs  is  an 
attractive  alternative  to  oral  dosing  in  cats. 
The choice of base used to mix drugs with is 
important  since  it  must  be  able  to  permeate 
feline  skin.  One  study  showed  no  significant 
transdermal  absorption  of  gabapentin  when 
compounded with ethoxydiglycol solvent and 
a  transdermal  base  (Lipoderm;  Professional 
Compounding  Centers  of  America).161 
However,  another  study  showed 
that 
gabapentin in the proprietary base Lipoderm 
did  result  in  measurable  plasma  concentra-
tions.163  The  authors  of  the  latter  study  cau-
tion  that  their  investigation  involved  a  small 
number  of  cats  and,  because  grooming  was 
allowed, uptake may have occurred transmu-
cosally. More studies using different transder-
mal creams, concentrations, doses and dosing 
intervals are needed. 

There  is  limited  information  on  the  use  of 
gabapentin for acute pain management.35,55,164 
In one study, gabapentin (50 mg, PO, admin-
istered 12 h and 1 h before surgery) in combi-
nation  with  buprenorphine  produced  similar 
postoperative analgesia when compared with 
meloxicam and buprenorphine in cats under-
going  ovariohysterectomy.35  Further  studies 
are  thus  still  required  to  investigate  the

analgesic properties of gabapentinoids in cats. 
Gabapentin (50 or 100 mg, PO) is important in 
attenuating stress and fear responses in client-
owned and cage-trap community cats under-
going transportation and veterinary consulta-
tion, and remains a valuable component of a 
holistic  approach  to  feline  pain  manage-
ment.60,165 
<  Ketamine  produces  anti-hyperalgesic 
effects  at  subanaesthetic  doses  by  non- 
competitive  and  non-specific  antagonism  of 
NMDA  receptors.57,166  These  receptors  are 
important  in  excitatory  and  sustained  neuro-
transmission  in  the  dorsal  horn  of  the  spinal 
cord.  NMDA  receptors  are  involved  in  the 
development and maintenance of central sen-
sitisation (Table 4) and cumulative depolarisa-
tion.  Therefore,  ketamine  is  used  to  prevent 
and  treat  hyperalgesia  and  allodynia  in  cats 
with  major  injury  and  in  those  undergoing 
surgery for its anaesthetic- and opioid-sparing 
effects.55,80  Cats  that  undergo  long-term 
therapy  (days)  must  be  hospitalised  during 
treatment  and  pain  should  be  monitored 
appropriately. Suggested dosing is as follows: 
an  intravenous  loading  dose  of  0.15–0.3 
mg/kg  followed  by  an  infusion  of  2–10 
µg/kg/min.  
<  Tramadol  is  a  synthetic  weak  opioid   
agonist  and  a  serotonin  and  noradrenaline 
reuptake  inhibitor  (dual  action)  analgesic 
drug. The injectable formulation is commonly 
used  in  some  countries,  especially  in  South 
America, whereas in North America, Oceania 
and most countries in Europe the drug is only 
available in an oral formulation. However, its 
low  palatability  (bitter  taste)  has  precluded   
it  from  becoming  a  popular  perioperative 
analgesic in cats. Cats may salivate profusely 
after drug administration and treatment com-
pliance can be poor. Moreover, there is signif-
icant  inter-patient  variability  in  analgesic   
efficacy  and  adverse  effects  of  tramadol  in 
cats.  Injectable  formulations  of  tramadol   
(2 –4  mg/kg  IM)  are  often  combined  with   
acepromazine  or  dexmedetomidine 
premedication.167,168  

for 

Based on the pharmacokinetics of tramadol 
in  cats,  a  dosage  of  4  mg/kg  q6h  PO  has   
been  recommended  as  part  of  a  multimodal 
analgesic  plan.169  However,  tramadol  has 
failed  to  produce  clinical  analgesia  in  some 
studies,  and  pain  assessment  should  always 
be performed.167 The risk of serotonin toxicity 
is  a  concern  when  tramadol  is  administered 
with  serotonin  inhibitors  (eg,  fluoxetine  and 
trazodone),  monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors   
(eg,  selegiline)  and  tricyclic  antidepressants 
(eg, clom ipramine). Clinical signs of serotonin 
syndrome  include  increased  neuromuscular 
activity,  tachycardia,  fever,  tachypnoea  and 
agitation.170

Analgesic shortages and 
unavailability: opioid-free  
or opioid-sparing techniques 

Opioids  are  included  in  the  WSAVA  list  of 
essential  medicines  for  cats  and  dogs,  and   
considered  ‘core  medicines’.171  Nevertheless, 
veterinarians commonly face opioid shortages 
or  do  not  always  have  access  to  this  class  of 
drug due to strict regulatory and bureaucratic 
constraints, and/or where medicines labelled 
for human use are rarely allowed to be admin-
istered  to  veterinary  patients.  These  con-
straints  affect  the  ability  of  veterinarians  to 
treat  feline  pain,  and  this  could  represent  a 
major  issue  for  feline  welfare  if  surgical  and 
medical procedures are performed with limit-
ed or no perioperative analgesia.  

‘Opioid-free anaesthesia’ (OFA) is a practice 
that excludes perioperative administration of 
opioids  and  uses  non-opioid,  multimodal 
analgesic  techniques.  ‘Opioid-sparing  anaes-
thesia’  is  a  less  restrictive  technique  where 
small amounts of opioids are used (ie, single 
and/or low doses of opioids perioperatively). 
Both  techniques  are  now  being  studied  in 
human  medicine  to  avoid  or  reduce  opioid-
induced adverse effects, including respiratory 
depression and death.172–174 Although adverse 
effects are different between humans and cats, 
the study of feline OFA is integral to overcom-
ing opioid shortages in the future and reduc-
ing opioid-induced adverse effects (vomiting, 
dysphoria,  hyperthermia,  etc).  There  is  also   
an  urgent  need  to  provide  humane  solutions 
for  pain  management  in  sterilisation  pro-
grammes,  which  have  often  been  performed 
without the use of analgesics.  

The  veterinary  literature  on  the  subject  is 
scant,  particularly  in  cats.  In  one  study,  an 
injectable 
using 
ketamine–midazolam  and  dexmedetomidine, 
intraperitoneal bupivacaine and postoperative 

anaesthetic 

protocol 

administration  of  meloxicam  did  not  provide 
optimal  postoperative  analgesia  in  more  than 
half  of  the  studied  population.175  Side-by-side   
comparisons  were  not  performed  between  an 
opioid-based  analgesic  group  and  an  OFA 
group,175 and the question of ‘can we attenuate 
or  ameliorate  acute  pain  without  opioids?’ 
remains. Certainly, opioid analgesics with mar-
ket  authorisation  for  cats  are  critical  to  avoid 
opioid drug shortages and improve feline wel-
fare. This issue is best addressed by involving 
multiple stakeholders including, but not limit-
ed to, governmental bodies, industry, regulato-
ry agencies and veterinary professionals. 

Knowledge gaps and challenges 

There is still a need for better understanding of 
feline behaviour related to pain as well as tech-
niques  for  long-term  pain  management  in  the 
acute setting so that cats can be discharged to 
their  owner  with  analgesics  that  continue  to 
work in the home environment and are easy for 
owners  to  administer.  Opioid-free  anaesthetic 
techniques  and  the  role  of  gabapentinoids  are 
important to investigate. Little is known about 
paediatric  analgesic  needs,  warranting  further 
studies in this age group. There is also a need 
for  safety  and  efficacy  studies  of  in  vivo  loco -
regional anaesthetic techniques to bridge the gap 
between in vitro studies and clinical practice. A 
major gap remains to be filled in the veterinary 
curriculum regarding feline analgesia and there 
must be a concerted effort to implement the use 
of pain assessment tools in feline practice.

SUMMARY points

<  The 2022 ISFM Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Acute Pain in Cats provide up-to-date information on the 
unique features of feline anatomy, physiology and pharmacology in relation to analgesia, as well as on pain assessment 
tools and novel analgesic drugs and techniques. 

<  Principles of pain management include preventive analgesia and multimodal analgesia, incorporating 

pharmacological and non-pharmacological options. The use of cat friendly handling techniques, anxiolysis and 
nursing care are central to appropriate pain management.  

<  In addition to local anaesthetics, NSAIDs and opioids, adjuvant analgesics should be considered depending on the 

individual and its needs.  

<  The future is bright for feline pain management with the potential automation of acute pain assessment tools that could 
allow cat owners to detect pain in the home environment, the licensing of new analgesic drugs for perioperative pain 
control and studies on novel analgesic drugs and techniques. 

<  Gaps in knowledge and challenges remain, but the good news is that these can be addressed with  

research support, educational opportunities and an enthusiastic group of feline advocates.
