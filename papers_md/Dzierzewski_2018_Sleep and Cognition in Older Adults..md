Synopsis

Increased age is associated with normative declines in both sleep and cognitive functioning. While 
there are some inconsistencies in the literature, negative sleep changes are associated with worse 
cognitive functioning. This negative relationship holds true across normal sleeping older adults, 
older adults with insomnia, older adults with sleep disordered breathing, cognitive healthy older 
adults, and older adults with dementia. There are mixed results regarding potential benefits of 
sleep treatments on cognitive functions; however, this line of research deserves added attention as 
the potential mechanisms of action are likely distinct from other interventions to improve 
cognition.

Introduction

This paper will review the growing literature examining sleep and cognitive functioning in 
older adults. The main focus will be on normal, age-related cognitive changes, as opposed to 
neurodegenerative disease processes. Age-related cognitive changes are the result of 
developmental maturation. These cumulative, long-term processes are universal or nearly 
universal, and are resistant to efforts to reverse the change.1,2 Investigation into cognitive

aging has found a general cognitive decline experienced with increasing age,3–5 which has 
been demonstrated to be pervasive, affecting many sub-domains of cognition including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

reaction time

sensory processing

attention

memory

reasoning

executive functioning

While much is known regarding developmental changes in cognitive functioning, 
comparatively little is known regarding sleep’s relationship to late-life cognitive functioning.

Sleep represents an intriguing individual difference variable as it may relate to late-life 
cognitive functioning. Sleep has demonstrated consistent age-related changes as a result of 
developmental maturation. Interestingly, many of these developmental changes parallel the 
age-related changes observed in cognitive functioning. For example, slow wave sleep (SWS; 
Stage N3) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep both decrease with advanced age.6 In 
addition to these normal, developmentally appropriate changes in sleep, older adults also 
experience an increased prevalence of both insomnia and sleep disordered breathing.7–9 
Figure 1 depicts general age-related changes in cognitive functioning and general age-related 
changes in sleep. The parallel changes in sleep and cognition with age, coupled with 
anecdotal reports of disturbed cognitive abilities following poor sleep, have resulted in 
research efforts focused on examining sleep and cognition in older adults. This paper 
summaries the literature for normal sleeping older adults, older adults with insomnia, and 
older adults with sleep disordered breathing.

Sleep and Cognition in the ‘Normal Sleeping’ Older Adult

Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Cognition

Several large-scale epidemiological studies have garnered information regarding habitual 
sleep duration and/or difficulty and cognitive functioning in older adults. In a study of over 
3000 older adults, long sleep duration was associated with worse overall/global cognitive 
functioning, while no association with short sleep duration and cognitive functioning was 
observed.10 In a similar study of over 5000 adults, sleep duration was associated with verbal 
fluency and list memory, such that both long and short sleep duration were associated with 
poorer performance.11 In a sample of community-dwelling older women, sleeping less than 
5 hours per night was associated with poorer global cognition and poorer performance 
across many of the individual indicators of cognitive functioning (i.e., verbal memory, verbal 
fluency, working memory) when compared to women sleeping 7 hours or more per night.12 
The authors of these studies suggest that sleep duration may be related to cognitive 
functioning through changes in sleep architecture, fragmentation, quality, and neurological 
conditions.10,11 The relationship between self-reported retrospective recall of habitual sleep 
duration and cognitive functioning has been confirmed through meta-analysis demonstrating

deleterious effects of both long and short sleepers on multiple domains of cognitive 
functioning in older adults.13

Polysomnography (PSG)-Measured Sleep and Cognition

Investigation into the relationship between PSG-assessed sleep and waking cognitive 
functioning has provided mixed results. It has been reported that longer sleep onset latency 
(SOL) is related to poorer verbal memory and executive functioning, while higher total wake 
time (TWT) is related to lower psychomotor speed and memory in normal sleeping older 
adults.13 However, in another investigation, SWS was unrelated to performance on a Simple 
reaction time (RT) task, Continuous Performance task, and attention test in good sleeping 
older adults14. As such, it appears additional research is need to further explicate the 
relationship between PSG-measured sleep and cognitive functioning in older adults without 
a sleep complaint.

Actigraphy-Measured Sleep and Cognition

It appears that there is a relationship between objective, naturally occurring sleep measured 
with actigraphy and cognitive performance. In a study of nearly 3000 older community-
dwelling women, actigraphy-measured sleep [sleep efficiency(SE), SOL, wake after sleep 
onset (WASO), and napping] was associated with an increased risk of poorer general 
cognition and executive performance.15 However, total sleep time (TST) was not related to 
cognitive functioning, which led the authors to conclude that “it is disturbance of sleep 
rather than quantity that affects cognition.”15 In a different, but complementary vein, 7 
nights of actigraphy were used to compute sleep/wake patterns in 144 community-dwelling 
older adults. It was reported that older adults who displayed many shifts from rest to activity 
performed worse on composites of executive functioning, memory, and speed than elderly 
with more consistent rest-activity patterns.16 The scarcity of research examining actigraphy-
measured sleep and cognition in older adults preclude any definitive conclusions from being 
drawn.

Sleep Deprivation and Cognition

Generally speaking, short-term total sleep deprivation has a “significant deleterious effect 
across most cognitive domains”, including attention, working memory, processing speed, 
short-term memory, and reasoning – with smaller effects being observed for tasks of greater 
complexity.17 Webb and Levy18 and Webb19 conducted experiments to examine potential 
age differences in cognitive response to sleep deprivation. In both experiments, older adults’ 
and younger adults’ performance on a variety of cognitive tasks were compared following 2 
nights of sleep deprivation. It was reported that older adults showed greater deterioration 
following sleep deprivation than did the younger adults in vigilance, visual search, reaction 
times, word detection, addition, anagrams, and objects uses.18,19 Jones and Harrison20 
summarized the extant sleep deprivation work nicely by stating “neurocognitve studies 
present many inconsistencies, task classification is often ambiguous and, in the absence of 
any unifying explanation at the level of cognitive mechanisms, the overall picture is one of a 
disparate range of impairment following sleep loss.”20

Sleep Restriction and Cognition

Bliese and colleagues21 examined age-related changes in reaction time/attention after 
modest sleep restriction. Interestingly, older adults displayed less pronounced effects of 
sleep restriction on their reaction times than younger adults. However, 62 was the oldest 
adult included in the study, so aging effects must be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, the 
authors suggest that older adults may have “expended more effort across days” which could 
have resulted in blunted differences.21 The experimental evidence regarding the sleep-
cognition relationship gained through studies employing sleep restriction methodology have 
consistently yielded results indicating an impact on vigilance, which may be blunted in older 
adults.21 Regarding potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between sleep 
restriction and cognitive functioning, Banks and Dinges22 summarized the evidence by 
suggesting there is no “definitive evidence of what is accumulating and destabilizing 
cognitive functions over time when sleep is regularly restricted.”22

Sleep and Learning

As opposed to examination of the negative consequences of poor sleep (or sleep loss), some 
researchers have investigated the potential benefits of sleep gained. In this line of research, 
participants are allowed to sleep while manipulating the timing of cognitive testing/training 
to either allow sleep to occur following testing or not in order to examine any effects of post 
training sleep on subsequent testing. The majority of this research has been conducted with 
younger adults, and with findings indicating optimized performance following sleep. Tucker 
and colleagues trained 16 healthy older adults in a finger tapping sequencing task and found 
that older adults performed significantly better following sleep than 12 hours of not sleeping, 
suggesting sleep-dependent motor skill performance in the elderly.23 Interestingly, older 
adults showed similar rates of improvement as was found in younger samples; however, 
specific sleep characteristics did not correlate with next day’s performance (in contrast, 
Stage 2 sleep and sleep spindle activity does correlate in younger adults). The authors 
concluded that sleep in the elderly does optimize motor skill learning; however, it may do so 
differently than in younger adults.23

Sleep and Cognition in the Older Adult with Insomnia

Older adults are at an increased risk for both insomnia and experiencing negative changes in 
cognitive functioning. Given the comorbidity of insomnia and cognitive dysfunction in older 
adults, researchers have attempted to understand the role of insomnia in predicting cognitive 
functioning in a variety of samples (e.g., cognitively intact older adults and older adults 
experiencing cognitive decline or dementia). Furthermore, a small number of studies have 
examined the effect of behavioral interventions for insomnia on cognitive outcomes. A 
sample of representative studies is presented below that illustrates these different 
approaches.

Insomnia Status and ‘Normal’ Cognitive Aging

The association between insomnia and cognitive performance in younger and middle-aged 
adults is well-established, with impairments in working memory, episodic memory, and 
some aspects of executive functioning.24 However, less is known about the association

between insomnia diagnosis and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults 
who are not experiencing cognitive decline or dementia. To date, insomnia and cognitive 
functioning has been examined in older adults with insomnia through cross-sectional designs 
with matched-healthy controls25,26 or using comparisons across insomnia sub-types.27

Overall, in contrast to healthy controls, insomnia status was associated with worse 
performance on a subset of cognitive tasks. Specifically, participants with insomnia 
performed significantly worse on memory span, integration of visual and semantic 
dimensions, and executive functioning tasks.26 Interestingly, the insomnia groups performed 
better than healthy controls on the simple attending task.25 The better attentional 
performance on simple attending did not persist for complex attending, perhaps reflecting 
the higher arousal that is characteristic of individuals diagnosed with insomnia.28 This 
higher arousal may be beneficial for unambiguous stimuli but a hindrance for complex tasks 
requiring more cognitive resources.25 In addition to differences in cognitive performance 
dependent on the presence or absence of insomnia, performance also appears to differ 
depending on the type of insomnia complaint. Specifically, Ling et al. found only early 
morning awakening was associated with significantly worse cognitive performance in the 
executive functioning domain. No association was found between difficulty initiating sleep 
or difficulty maintaining sleep across the following cognitive domains: attention, verbal 
memory, visuospatial ability, and executive functioning.27 Refer to Table 1 for differences in 
cognitive functioning between older adults with and without insomnia.

Overall, across the reviewed studies examining cognitive performance in cognitively-intact 
older adults with insomnia, insomnia status and specific characteristics of insomnia (early 
morning awakening) appears to be associated with worse cognitive performance. However, 
the poorer performance of the individuals with insomnia is not consistent across all cognitive 
domains or across all tasks within cognitive domains. Consequently, despite a trend towards 
worse cognitive performance associated with insomnia status, the existing body of evidence 
is too small and inconsistent to arrive at a broad conclusion.

Insomnia and Cognitive Decline/Dementia Diagnoses

In comparison to research that has examined insomnia and cognitive performance in 
cognitively healthy older adults, more work has been done to explore the role of insomnia in 
predicting cognitive decline or dementia status. Despite the greater breadth of research with 
cognitively impaired older adults, the association between insomnia and cognitive decline 
and/or dementia status remains unclear.

A minority of studies identified a negative association between insomnia and cognitive 
decline or dementia.29,30 Specifically, older adults with long-term insomnia and long-term 
use of hypnotics had a two-fold risk of developing dementia during a three-year follow-up 
period compared to healthy controls.29 Controlling for hypnotic use, similar results were 
found with long-term insomnia predicting an increased risk for cognitive decline at a three-
year follow-up for older adults with insomnia compared to healthy controls.30 These results 
point to the importance of considering the duration of the insomnia complaint as a predictor 
of cognitive function, as long-term, rather than concurrent sleep complaint, was associated 
with cognitive decline.30

Conversely, another sub-section of studies found a positive association between insomnia 
symptoms and cognitive performance.31,32 Using a longitudinal design, Jaussent et al. 
(2012) found that complaints of awakenings during the night and total number of insomnia 
complaints at baseline predicted a decreased risk for cognitive decline during a 8-year 
follow-up period.31 Additionally, a cross-sectional approach with older adults with dementia 
residing in assisted living facilities showed that individuals with insomnia symptoms 
performed significantly better on the MMSE compared to those without insomnia 
symptoms.32 Of note, neither of these studies assessed the duration of the insomnia 
complaint.

Despite a sub-set of studies showing negative and positive associations between insomnia 
and cognitive decline or dementia, a greater number of studies have found no association. 
Employing longitudinal and cross-sectional designs, with and without comparison groups, 
and various approaches to insomnia and cognitive evaluations, insomnia was not associated 
with cognitive decline33–35 or dementia status in many studies.36 Given these discrepant 
findings, one could conclude that insomnia status does not predict cognitive decline in older 
adults. However, it is more likely that the equivocal findings result from methodological 
differences in research approaches. Please see Table 2 for a summary of the relationship 
between insomnia and cognitive decline/dementia status in older adults.

Insomnia Treatment and Cognitive Functioning

In addition to examining cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between insomnia and 
cognitive outcomes, a small number of studies have investigated whether the treatment of 
insomnia leads to an improvement in cognitive performance (see Table 3).25,37 In one such 
study, an insomnia intervention was employed with community-dwelling older adults with 
insomnia.25 The insomnia intervention consisted of sleep restriction, cognitive restructuring, 
sleep hygiene, bright light exposure, body temperature manipulations, and structured 
physical activity. Following treatment, sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency were 
significantly improved in the treatment group compared to the waitlist group. Treatment was 
also associated with improved performance on complex vigilance tasks and worsened 
performance on simple vigilance tasks compared to the waitlist control. A possible 
explanation for the performance differences on simple versus complex tasks following 
treatment, is that improved sleep results in a reduction of arousal levels to normal,25 
resulting in slower performance on simpler tasks.

An additional study employed a Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) approach 
with a sample of community-dwelling older adults who were cognitively intact and 
diagnosed with insomnia.37 Individuals in the treatment group showed a significantly greater 
decrease in wake time after sleep onset following treatment compared to the information-
only control group. However, the treatment group did not show significantly better 
improvement in cognitive performance across three cognitive domains (episodic memory, 
working memory, abstract reasoning) compared to the control group. The authors posited 
that the null findings might be due to the short follow-up period – 4 weeks after the start of 
the intervention. Allowing more time post-intervention for the sleep treatment to take effect 
might have enabled detection of effects on cognitive performance.

Sleep and Cognition in the Older Adult with Sleep Disordered Breathing 

(SDB)

The estimated prevalence of both SDB and cognitive impairment increases with age.38,39 
Moreover, individuals with SDB show cognitive changes similar to those associated with 
aging.40 Recent research has posited that SBD and advanced age act independently to impair 
cognitive functioning, with the combination of both SBD and advanced age leading to 
cognitive impairments above and beyond either factor alone.40

While some studies have found an association between SDB and impairments in global 
cognitive functioning,41,42 not all cognitive domains appear to be equally affected. Instead, 
the domains of vigilance, executive function, and memory are particularly implicated.43 The 
impact of SDB on all three of these cognitive domains has been observed among both 
community and clinic based populations with different neuropsychological tests (Table 4). 
SDB in older adults has been found to impair:

•

•

vigilance44,45

attention46,47,48,49

reaction time50

executive functioning47, 51, 52

problem-solving53

verbal recall52,54,55

non-verbal recall53

episodic memory51

Although relatively few studies have examined the longitudinal impact of SDB on cognitive 
performance in order adults, preliminary evidence suggests that SDB can contribute to 
relevant long-term changes. For example, one study found that SDB was associated with a 
decline in global cognitive functioning over three years.41 Similarly, another study of 
community dwelling adults found that SDB was associated with a decline in attention 
abilities over eight years.56

The long-term impact of SDB may also influence the onset and course of certain 
neurological disorders. Older individuals with SDB have earlier rates of both mild cognitive 
impairment and dementia.57,58 Evidence also suggests that older adults with neurological 
disorders might be more vulnerable to the negative cognitive effects of SDB.45 For example, 
SDB can exacerbate cognitive impairments in older adults with dementia.59 The possible 
role of SDB in the development of neurological disorders has led researchers to examine the 
possible pathways contributing to impairments in cognitive functioning.

Several mechanisms through which SDB contributes to cognitive decline in older adults 
have been proposed. Evidence suggests that high levels of hypoxemia, an abnormally low 
level of oxygen in the blood, may play a prominent role. Yaffe and colleagues found that 
hypoxemia was associated with an increased risk of future mild cognitive impairment and

dementia.58 In addition, increased hypoxemia is associated with greater impairment in 
global cognitive functioning, as well as declines in specific cognitive domains.44,60 
However, other studies have found no association between hypoxemia and impaired 
cognition.41,55 As a result, both sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness have 
been proposed as alternative mechanisms through which SDB may lead to cognitive 
dysfunction.61 For example, excessive daytime sleepiness caused by SDB, was associated 
with a decline in global cognitive functioning.41 Despite these findings, the relative 
contribution of both sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness to cognitive 
impairment remains poorly understood.

While relatively strong evidence supports an association between SBD and cognitive decline 
in older adults, not all findings support this association. One study found that although both 
SDB and aging are independently associated with cognitive deficits, age did not interact 
with SDB to make those cognitive deficits worse.62 Other studies report similar findings. 
Boland and colleagues found no evidence for an association between either mild or 
moderate forms of SBD and cognitive functioning in verbal learning and short-term recall, 
psychomotor efficiency, or verbal fluency.63 Similarly, other research found no association 
between SDB and performance on broad standardized cognitive tests.64,65 Studies that found 
no association between SBD and cognitive impairment in older adults contain several 
methodological differences. First, they lacked comprehensive measures of cognitive 
functioning or relied on single measures of global functioning.63 Cognitive impairments in 
older adults with SDB may be subtle and may not be readily identified by general/global 
cognitive measures. Secondly, several of the studies that found no association between SDB 
and cognition used home polysomnography,65 which has been shown to differ from lab 
polysomnography, particularly for adults with severe SDB.66 Finally, several studies finding 
no associations between SDB and cognitive performance only included participants with 
mild to moderate SDB,63,64 suggestive of a dose-response relationship between SDB 
severity and cognitive performance.

While the findings are somewhat inconsistent, overall, current research suggests that SDB 
adversely impacts cognitive performance in older adults. Cognitive impairments are 
particularly pronounced in the domains of attention, executive function, and memory. These 
findings are largely consistent with research examining the influence of SDB in young and 
middle aged adults.67,68

SDB Severity and Cognitive Performance

Research has explored whether the severity of SDB [as indexed by the apnea-hypopnea 
index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI)] is related to the level of cognitive 
impairment in older adults. Studies have found that greater AHI and RDI were associated 
with poorer global cognitive functioning,42 as well as adverse outcomes on specific 
cognitive domains such as:

•

memory54

However, one study examining older adults with mostly mild to moderate SDB, found no 
association between SDB severity and cognitive functioning,63 suggesting there may be a 
threshold at which SDB exerts an increasingly negative impact on cognition. Further 
research investigating SDB severity and cognitive impairment is warranted.

SDB Treatment and Cognitive Performance

Given the nature of cognitive dysfunction in older adults with SDB, as well as the 
association between SDB and neurological disorders, the influence of SDB treatment on 
cognitive functioning in older adults has been the subject of recent interest. The most 
common treatment for SBD is positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. While PAP has been 
shown to decrease some of the primary sequelae of SDB, such as sleep fragmentation and 
nocturnal oxygen saturation, several studies suggest possible benefits of PAP treatment on 
cognitive performance.

Two studies report improvements in many areas of cognitive functioning following 3 months 
of PAP treatment.54,71 Improvements were demonstrated in the following domains:

•

•

•

•

•

•

episodic memory

short-term memory

executive functioning

attention

psychomotor speed

non-verbal delayed recall

Despite optimism about the potential benefits of PAP on cognition, some studies have shown 
more limited and uneven benefits of PAP treatment. For example, Kang and colleagues 
found that short-term PAP treatment was associated with gains in executive functioning but 
no other cognitive domains.72

Preliminary evidence suggests that cognitive gains observed with short-term PAP treatment 
might be maintained over time. PAP treatment over the course of 10 years is associated with 
better memory, attention, and executive functioning.51 The long-term benefits of PAP 
treatment may also extend to older adults with neurological disorders. Preliminary 
examination of long-term PAP use among individuals with Alzheimer’s disease found that 
treatment can slow cognitive deterioration.73 Another recent study reported that PAP 
treatment may delay the age of onset of mild cognitive impairment.57

Although the influence of PAP treatment on cognitive outcomes seem promising, 
noncompliance with the treatment remains prevalent in the general population, as well as 
among older adults.74 Limited compliance may severely limit the benefits of PAP treatment

on cognitive abilities. Older adults who complied with treatment (average use of 8.5 h/night) 
displayed greater cognitive abilities compared to individuals who were non-compliant (3.9 
h/night).54 One hypothesis about PAP compliance is that older adults who notice cognitive 
gains in readily observable domains such as attention and memory, may be more likely to 
comply with PAP treatment.54

Although preliminary evidence demonstrates improved cognitive outcomes for older adults 
treated with PAP, further research is needed to confirm these findings and better understand 
which cognitive domains are impacted. In addition, future research should examine whether 
other forms of SDB treatment, such as weight loss, oral appliance therapy, positional 
therapy, and surgical treatments might lead to similar cognitive gains.

Unifying Theories and Mechanisms

There are several informative hypotheses concerning sleep and cognitive functioning. These 
hypotheses include: the controlled attention hypothesis,75 neuropsychological hypothesis,
17,20,76 vigilance/arousal hypothesis,77,78 and wake state instability hypothesis.79–81 These 
various theories about the role of sleep processes in regulating and maintaining cognitive 
functioning may not be mutually exclusive.17 The controlled attention and vigilance/arousal 
hypotheses are essentially parallel descriptions of the same phenomena. Many higher order 
cognitive functions may rely on the appropriate levels of attention and arousal. It has been 
suggested that impairment of the prefrontal cortex may cause decrements in attention and 
vigilance.82 In sum, sleep appears to impede arousal/vigilance/attention and prefrontal 
functioning, potentially through instability of the neurobiological systems responsible for 
attentional and sleep drives. Please refer to Table 5 for a description of each sleep-cognition 
theory. In addition to the above referenced sleep-cognition hypotheses, there are many 
suspected mechanisms involved in the sleep-cognition relationship in late-life. These 
mechanisms are graphically depicted in Figure 2.

Conclusions and Future Directions

Sleep and cognitive functioning appear to be related in late-life; however, the exact nature of 
this relationship has yet to be discerned. Future investigations should continue to investigate 
the gamut of sleep-cognition relationships. Important questions remain concerning: (1) The 
role of normal sleep changes in normal cognitive aging, (2) The role of pathological sleep 
changes on the development of dementias, and (3) The utility of treating sleep disorders on 
improving cognitive functioning, warding off unwanted cognitive decline, and slowing the 
course of neurodegenerative diseases. An intriguing prospect for future study is to examine 
the additive impact of treating sleep disorders in conjunction with focused cognitive 
interventions. Perhaps the combination of interventions that focus on different pathways of 
change may have a synergistic effect and result in more pronounced cognitive 
improvements. Increasing our knowledge of the ways in which sleep may impact late-life 
cognitive functioning could have far reaching benefits.

Key Points

Sleep and cognitive functioning both demonstrate negative changes with 
advanced age.

Though the relationships are not without uncertainties, sleep appears to be 
related to cognitive functioning within good sleeping older adults, older adults 
with insomnia, and older adults with sleep disordered breathing.

Both insomnia and sleep apnea may be associated with cognitive decline and 
dementia.

Treatment of sleep disorders may provide cognitive benefits in late-life. 
Additional research is warranted.

Interview indicating either problem 
most of the time: trouble falling asleep 
or waking up too early and not falling 
asleep again.

Pfeiffer’s Short Portable Mental Status 
Questionnaire (SPMSQ), ≥ 2 errors on the 
SPMSQ classified as cognitive decline.

Patients with insomnia diagnosis and 
prescribed hypnotics > risk for dementia 
during the 3-year follow-up compared to 
controls.

Insomnia associated with increased risk of 
cognitive decline for men, independent of 
depression and comorbid with depression. 
Insomnia associated with increased risk of 
cognitive decline for women when 
insomnia was comorbid with depression.

Interview and questionnaire: difficulty 
initiating sleep, awakenings during the 
night, early morning awakening, 
insomnia severity.

Johns Hopkins Alzheimer’s Disease 
Research Center questionnaire.

Self-report questionnaire assessing 
“usually having trouble falling asleep 
or waking up far too early and not 
going back to sleep.”

Interview assessing difficulty falling 
asleep, staying asleep, or both.

Positive Associations

Incident cognitive impairment defined as 4-
point reduction in Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), 4-point reduction in 
Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT), and 
14-point reduction in the Isaacs Set Test 
(IST) scores.

Number of insomnia complaints and 
difficulty with awakenings during the 
night were negatively associated with 
MMSE cognitive decline during follow-
up. No associations found for BVRT or 
IST.

Severity of dementia was classified based on 
MMSE scores (mild = MMSE > 20; 
moderate = MMSE 11–19; severe = MMSE < 
10).

Participants diagnosed with insomnia 
performed the best on the MMSE 
compared to those without sleep 
disturbance or those with insomnia and 
daytime sleepiness.

No Associations

Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument 
(CASI); cognitive decline was defined as a ≥ 
9-point drop in the CASI.

Insomnia not associated with greater risk 
for dementia diagnosis or cognitive 
decline.

Incident cognitive impairment defined as an 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≤ 
21.

No sleep problems associated with 
increased risk for incident cognitive 
impairment 2/10-year follow-ups.

Clinical interview: at least 1 symptom 
(difficulty falling asleep, staying 
asleep, early morning awakening) 
occurring at least 3 times/week.

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); 
Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). 
Participants with MMSE < 24.0 were 
evaluated for dementia by expert panel

Insomnia Interview Schedule and 
Sleep Impairment Index: onset, 
maintenance, termination insomnia.

Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis was made 
according to NINCDS/ADRDA and DSM-IV 
criteria.

Insomnia diagnosis was not associated 
with cognitive impairment

Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease did 
not differ from the healthy comparison 
group in terms of the frequency of onset, 
maintenance, termination insomnia 
symptoms.

Cognitive Measure

Results

DSM-IV criteria, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index, Sleep Disorders Questionnaire. 
Polysomnography and sleep diaries were also 
employed.

Simple and complex sustained attention 
assessed via computer. Outcomes: 
lapses, false-positive responses, and 
reaction times.

DSM-IV-TR, ICSD-2 verified by self-report 
questionnaires and clinical interview. 
Polysomnography and the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index were also employed.

Neuropsychological tests assessed three 
cognitive domains: episodic memory, 
working memory, abstract reasoning

Compared to the waitlist control, 
insomnia intervention group showed 
increased reaction time for simple 
vigilance task and reduced reaction 
time for complex vigilance task.

Insomnia intervention was not 
associated with greater improved 
cognitive performance compared to 
information-only control.

Theories on the Link Between Sleep and Cognition.

Table 5

Name

Description

Reference

Controlled attention

Monotonous tasks are most affected by sleep loss due to the amount of top-down control needed to 
sustain attention while more complex/difficult tasks are intrinsically motivating (i.e., bottom-up control).

31

Neuropsychological

Sleep loss results in focal impairment in functions subserved by the prefrontal cortex (i.e., executive 
functions), beyond any impairment in attention or vigilance.

17,20,76

Vigilance/arousal

Attention, which is needed for the performance of many other cognitive tasks, is mediated by arousal – a 
common correlated feature of disturbed sleep.

77,78

Wake-state instability Cognitive deficits observed as a result of sleep loss occur due to the interaction of the drive to maintain 

79–81

alertness and the homeostatic drive to initiate sleep.

Please note that the above theories are not mutually exclusive, but rather attempt to explain similar phenomena in different ways.
