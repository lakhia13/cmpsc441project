Background:  Chronic testicular pain (orchialgia) has been defined as intermittent or constant unilateral 

or bilateral testicular pain that lasts 3 months or longer, significantly interfering with daily activities, and 

prompting the patient to seek medical attention. In many instances, the etiology of the pain is not identified. 

The contribution of psychological factors is unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the categories 

of mental health (MH) diagnoses that are most frequently associated with orchialgia and determine if a 

correlation exists between MH diagnoses and orchialgia.
Methods:  A  retrospective  review  was  performed  to  identify  all  adult  patients  within  the  San  Antonio 

Military Health System with a new diagnosis of orchialgia from January 2005 to April 2015. Patients with 

acute pathology or recent inguinal/scrotal surgery were excluded. A comparative cohort of all men presenting 

with hydroceles within the same timeframe was obtained. The presence of coexisting MH diagnoses in both 

cohorts was then determined.
Results:  Four  hundred  and  forty-four  men  met  the  inclusion  criteria  for  orchialgia,  with  133  men 

presenting  with  hydroceles.  The  incidence  of  orchialgia  increased  significantly  over  the  study  period 

(P=0.001). MH diagnoses in the study population did trend upward over the years, but not significantly 

(P=0.063). MH diagnoses were not significantly higher in the cases compared to the controls (21.6% vs. 

18.8%,  P=0.479).  The  prevalence  of  anxiety  was  twice  as  high  in  the  cases  (9%  vs.  4.5%),  though  not 

significantly (P=0.075). The prevalence of all MH diagnoses was significantly higher than in the general US 

population based on National Institute of Mental Health statistics.
Conclusions:  The  incidence  of  orchialgia  rose  significantly  over  time,  but  it  was  not  significantly 

associated with MH diagnoses. These results may also be skewed by the overall higher percentage of MH 

diagnoses in the study population than in the general population.

Introduction

Chronic testicular pain, also known as chronic orchialgia, is 

a common presenting complaint to the urologist. Chronic 

orchialgia has been defined as an intermittent or constant, 

unilateral or bilateral testicular pain that lasts three months 
or longer. This pain should also significantly interfere with 
the daily activities of a patient, so as to prompt him to seek 
medical  attention  (1).  Appropriate  evaluation  of  chronic 
orchialgia  has  been  previously  studied  in  the  military

setting (2). Current management ranges from conservative 
management (scrotal support, NSAIDs, rest, nerve blocks) 
to  surgery  (microsurgical  denervation,  epididymectomy, 
orchiectomy). All modalities attempt to address anatomic 
and  physical  causes  for  pain  with  varying  degrees  of  
success (3). As the etiology of the pain is not identified in 
many instances, it may not be addressed by current medical 
and surgical practice (4). 

Chronic  pain  affecting  various  parts  of  the  body 
has  become  a  more  prevalent  complaint  with  possible 
psychological  significance.  In  some  instances,  these  pain 
syndromes can be attributed to depressive conditions (5). 
Conversely, conditions such as chronic back pain have been 
shown  to  be  a  predisposition  to  psychologic  conditions. 
Many  patients  with  orchialgia  often  demonstrate  a 
strong  clinical  depressive  abnormality  on  psychological  
testing  (6).  In  more  recent  literature,  there  is  evidence 
that  antidepressants  may  help  with  the  management  of 
chronic  orchialgia,  further  reinforcing  this  potential  
relationship (3). The purpose of this study was to determine 
if  there  is  a  statistically  significant  association  between 
mental health (MH) diagnoses and orchialgia. 

Methods

Database search

The  study  was  approved  by  the  Brooke  Army  Medical 
Center Office of the Institutional Review Board. Consent 
was waived as the data was provided to the investigators in 
a  de-identified  format.  Data  sources  were  the  outpatient 
military electronic health records systems known as CHCS 
and  AHLTA.  The  Armed  Forces  Health  Longitudinal 
Technology Application (AHLTA) is the primary electronic 
medical record (EMR) used by the Department of Defense 
(DoD) for outpatient care. It was implemented in January 
2004,  but  not  in  widespread  use  at  military  treatment 
facilities (MTFs) until 2005. The Composite Health Care 
System  (CHCS)  is  an  older  medical  informatics  system, 
now  only  used  to  book  appointments,  order  laboratory 
or radiology studies and review results. The retrospective 
review  was  performed  by  searching  CHCS  for  adult 
patients  within  the  San  Antonio  Military  Health  System 
with an initial entry of the ICD-9 code 608.9 (unspecified 
disorder  of  male  genital  organs),  from  January  2005  to 
April  2015.  The  search  was  performed  by  an  AHLTA 
database  administrator.  Patients  with  an  accompanying 

entry of the codes 608.20 (torsion of testis), 604.9 (orchitis 
and  epididymitis),  and  878.2  (open  wound  of  scrotum 
and  testis  without  complication),  were  excluded.  Patients 
with an entry of the CPT codes 55250 (vasectomy), 55040 
(hydrocelectomy),  54840/54830  (spermatocelectomy), 
55530 (varicocelectomy), or any of the 6 codes indicating 
a hernia repair within the 3 months leading up the 608.9 
code  were  also  excluded.  The  records  of  the  remaining 
patients were then searched within the AHLTA database, 
to  confirm  that  the  diagnosis  was  actually  testicular  pain 
with  a  duration  longer  than  3  months.  A  comparative 
cohort was then obtained, by searching CHCS for patients 
with  a  new  entry  of  the  ICD-9  code  603.9  (hydrocele 
not  otherwise  specified).  Hydroceles  were  selected  as 
a  common  presenting  diagnosis  in  the  same  general 
anatomic  area  as  orchialgia,  but  with  no  associated  pain 
and  a  low  likelihood  of  psychological  distress  attributed 
to the diagnosis. Both cohorts were then searched for the 
prevalence of MH diagnoses. All of the patients identified 
to have a MH diagnosis had an entry of at least one of the 
following  seven  ICD-9  codes:  300  (anxiety  unspecified), 
300.02  (generalized  anxiety  disorder),  311  (depressive 
disorder not classified elsewhere), 296.3 (major depressive 
affective  disorder),  309.24  (adjustment  disorder  with 
anxiety),  309.28  (adjustment  disorder  with  mixed  anxiety 
and  depressed  mood),  and  309.81  (post-traumatic  stress 
disorder). The ICD9 codes in this study population were 
grouped  into  4  for  purposes  of  the  analysis  as  follows: 
anxiety (300, 300.02), depression (311, 296.3), adjustment 
disorder  (309.24,  309.28),  and  post-traumatic  stress 
disorder (309.81).

Statistical analysis

Categorical  data  was  summarized  using  percentages  and 
analyzed  using  Chi-Squared  tests  or  Fisher’s  exact  test, 
whichever  was  most  appropriate.  Means  and  standard 
deviations or medians and inter-quartile ranges were used 
as  summary  statistics  for  continuous  variables  and  were 
analyzed using Student’s t-test and ANOVA or Wilcoxon’s 
Test,  whichever  was  most  appropriate.  Significance  for 
results was established when P values were less than 0.05. 
Comparisons  between  the  study  data  and  NIMH  survey 
data  were  performed  using  Wilson’s  approximation  of 
the  exact  limits  for  a  binomial  distribution  to  determine 
exact 95% confidence intervals. All statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS v 22.0 (IBM).

Results

Patient characteristics

A total of 500 men were identified by ICD-9 code alone. 
After applying the exclusion criteria, 444 men were included 
in  the  study  population,  with  133  in  the  control  cohort. 
Demographic data collected was age, branch of service, and 
enlisted versus officer. Mean age in the orchialgia cohort 
and controls was 32.4±7.9 and 31.2±8.8 years respectively. 
Both  cases  and  controls  were  predominantly  serving  in

respectively,  with  enlisted  service  members  making  up 
379  (85.4%)  and  115  (86.5%)  of  the  cases  and  controls 
respectively.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  MH 
diagnosis  based  on  enlisted  vs.  officer  status  (P=0.748); 
branch  (P=0.622);  or  age  (P=0.161).  The  incidence  of 
orchialgia  increased  significantly  over  the  study  period 
(P=0.001) (Figure 1). There was a higher prevalence of MH 
diagnoses  in  the  later  years  of  the  study,  but  this  did  not 
reach statistical significance (P=0.063) (Table 1). 

MH diagnoses

The  overall  prevalence  of  one  or  more  MH  diagnoses  in 
both groups was 21%, with 44.6% of the patients having 
one  diagnosis,  29.8%  with  two  diagnoses,  and  25.6% 
with  three  or  four  diagnoses.  The  prevalence  of  a  MH 
diagnosis  was  not  significantly  higher  in  the  orchialgia 
group  than  in  the  hydrocele  group  (21.6%  vs.  18.8%; 
P=0.479). The prevalence of anxiety was twice as high in 
men  with  orchialgia  (9.0%  vs.  4.5%),  though  it  did  not 
quite reach significance (P=0.075) (Table 2). The prevalence 
of adjustment disorder and PTSD were also higher in the 
orchialgia group, but not significantly. The percentage of 
patients with depression was equal in both groups (11.0% 
vs. 11.3%; P=0.938). The prevalence of all MH diagnoses 
was higher than in the general male population in the US

Discussion

The exact scope of the problem is somewhat unclear, but 
current reports of chronic orchialgia presentation include 
38.8%  of  male  chronic  pelvic  pain  patients  localizing 
their  pain  to  the  scrotum  (7),  and  chronic  scrotal  pain 
occurring  in  4.8%  of  men  presenting  to  an  outpatient  
urologist  (8).  Furthermore,  it  is  a  condition  that  can  be 
difficult  to  manage.  In  a  recently  published  integrated 
review  of  the  literature,  Quallich  concluded  that  the 
research  into  chronic  testicular  pain  lags  behind  other 
chronic pain syndromes, such as in comparison to female 
chronic  pain.  She  also  found  that  the  3  most  commonly 
referenced articles for orchialgia are over 20 years old (9).

There  are  several  papers  that  recommend  a  similar, 
progressive  approach  for  management  (1,6).  These 
algorithms begin with determining any identifiable causes 
for  pain  and  treating  accordingly.  However,  25–50%  of 
orchialgia  cases  are  of  unknown  etiology  (10).  In  this 
scenario, management begins with a trial of ‘conservative 
management’  that  may  include  NSAIDs,  scrotal  support, 
possible antibiotic use, rest, or some combination thereof. 
Alternative  medical  therapies  such  as  biofeedback,  have 
also  been  tried  both  alone  and  as  an  adjunctive  measure 

to  other  treatment  modalities,  with  some  success  (11).  If 
the  patient  fails  conservative  management  then  the  next 
recommendation  is  for  spermatic  cord  blocks  in  clinic  or 
with anesthesia. Should these fail, the final steps are surgical 
(microsurgical denervation, epididymectomy, orchiectomy), 
or  neuromodulation.  Microsurgical  spermatic  cord 
denervation is emerging as a relatively low risk procedure 
resulting  in  complete  pain  resolution  in  as  high  as  80% 
of  well-selected  patients  (12).  This  procedure  also  avoids 
the potential adverse psychological effects of orchiectomy, 
which additionally does not guarantee relief of pain (success 
ranges from 20–73%) (3). This entire process may not only 
fail to address the complaint, it may also take many months 
and result in the frustration of both patient and physician. 
In  a  recent  study  involving  the  Israeli  Defense  Forces, 
the average chronic scrotal pain patient had an average of 
5.3  visits,  with  one  patient  logging  27  visits  (13).  In  the 
military  setting,  this  time  can  have  a  significant  impact 
on  the  patient’s  ability  to  train  or  deploy.  Additionally, 
chronic  orchialgia  has  been  the  most  cited  reason  for 
medical  discharge  in  the  US  Army  (14).  Any  additional 
management strategies may aid in a timelier return to duty 
and conservation of limited military resources.

There is a growing body of literature that suggests a link 
between urologic pain and MH disorders. In a commonly 
cited  article,  Schover  showed  that  in  male  patients 
with  genital  pain,  a  psychologist  was  able  to  diagnose 
56%  with  somatization  disorder  and  27%  with  major

depression (15). Ching et al. found that 14% of orchialgia 
patients  had  psychiatric  or  behavioral  issues  and  9% 
had  identifiable  life  stressors  (16).  These  findings 
have  resulted  in  treatment  strategies  that  incorporate 
management  of  psychologic  conditions  for  chronic 
orchialgia.  Many  recommend  the  addition  of  tricyclic 
antidepressants,  as  they  have  been  shown  to  be  effective 
in the management of chronic pain conditions to include 
orchialgia  (2,16,17).  Sinclair  was  able  to  find  through  a 
prospective  trial  that  66%  of  patients  on  nortriptyline 
had a greater than 50%  reduction  in their  symptoms (3). 
Some  advocate  a  multidisciplinary  approach  advocating 
treatment  of  identifiable  underlying  behavioral  health 
issues  and  potential  management  of  psychosomatic  pain  
disorders (1,18).

As  there  was  no  statistically  significant  relationship 
between the diagnosis of orchialgia and any MH disorders 
included  in  this  study,  management  of  these  patients 
exclusively  by  the  urologist  may  be  warranted.  However, 
a  few  factors  can  be  considered  cause  for  involvement  of 
a  MH  professional.  First,  it  is  possible  that  patients  who 
are  more  likely  to  present  with  somatic  complaints  like 
orchialgia  are  less  likely  to  present  for  evaluation  and 
treatment for explicit MH complaints, even if psychological 
symptoms are present, due to a primary focus on physical 
rather than psychological symptoms of distress. Thus, while 
these patients may actually reach diagnostic criteria for a 
MH  disorder,  they  would  not  have  a  previous  diagnosis 
listed.  Second,  while  the  culture  around  evaluation  and 
management  of  MH  disorders  in  the  military  population 
has  evolved,  there  still  exists  concern  that  being 
diagnosed  with  a  MH  disorder  could  have  career-related 
consequences.  This  may  have  also  influenced  the  rate  at 
which patients with orchialgia would present for treatment 
of MH complaints. Third, there are psychological factors 
that  contribute  to  health-related  concerns  that  do  not 
meet diagnostic criteria for a MH diagnosis. For example, 
patients  with  orchialgia  may  be  more  likely  to  engage  in 
maladaptive pain-related cognitions which exacerbate pain 
intensity and duration but do not contribute to overall levels 
of more generalized MH complaints. If this were the case, it 
could indicate that while patients with orchialgia may have 
a less psychologically adaptive response to pain than others, 
they are not necessarily more likely to be diagnosed with a 
MH disorder. 

One  concerning  finding  of  this  study  is  the  higher 
prevalence of MH diagnoses compared to the general US 
male  population.  This  statistically  significant  difference 

was  demonstrated  in  both  control  and  orchialgia  groups. 
This, however, is consistent with previously published data 
obtained  from  Veterans  Health  Administration  (VHA) 
databases. Trivedi et al. reported a 25.7% overall prevalence 
of any mental illness among patients assigned to a primary 
care  provider  within  the  VHA  system,  with  a  significant 
co-occurrence  among  the  diagnoses  of  PTSD,  anxiety, 
depression, and substance use disorder (19). Additionally, 
there was an increasing prevalence of MH diagnoses towards 
the  end  of  the  review  period.  One  important  factor  that 
may  explain  these findings  is  the  timeframe  incorporated 
into  the  review.  During  this  time,  the  United  States  was 
engaged  in  combat  operations  in  Afghanistan  (Operation 
Enduring Freedom 2001–2014) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi 
Freedom  2003–2011,  Operation  New  Dawn  2010–2011). 
Other published reports have also shown an increase in the 
prevalence of MH diagnoses over the progression of these 
conflicts  (20,21).  This  baseline  higher  prevalence  of  MH 
diagnoses in the military population may have impacted the 
lack of statistical significance of our findings. 

There  was  a  significant  increase  in  the  diagnosis  of 
chronic  testicular  pain  from  year  to  year  throughout  the 
study. This trend follows the increasing prevalence of MH 
diagnoses  over  the  same  timeframe  and  may  represent  a 
correlation between the two. This also could be related to 
the aforementioned combat operations and the associated 
exposure to stressful environments. However, based on our 
study design, the significance of this finding is unclear. 

This retrospective review was done over a 10-year period 
of  time  with  a  large  number  of  patients  through  a  single 
electronic medical record system. A significant limitation 
of the study is that the findings are based on the accuracy 
of  the  ICD-9  codes  entered  into  the  system  by  a  variety 
of  DoD providers.  However,  this  common  EMR  allowed 
review of the patients’ records to confirm the diagnosis of 
chronic testicular pain and exclude patients diagnosed with 
pain from other etiologies such as posttraumatic, infectious, 
post-surgical, etc. Additionally, another potential weakness 
is that although hydroceles may not generally cause pain, 
the  psychological  impact  on  the  patient  is  unknown  and 
may have affected the results. 

This  is  the  first  study  to  investigate  the  possible  link 
between MH diagnoses and chronic orchialgia in military 
patients.  Although  there  was  an  increased  prevalence 
of  anxiety  in  patients  with  orchialgia,  this  did  not  reach 
statistical  significance.  Continued  research  is  necessary 
to  further  elucidate  the  role  of  psychological  factors  in 
the  presentation  of  orchialgia.  Future  research  should

independently evaluate patients presenting with orchialgia 
both for symptoms of MH disorders that may not have been 
previously diagnosed as well as for pain-related cognitions 
contributing to a less-adaptive response pattern.

Conclusions

In  this  study  population,  orchialgia  was  not  found  to 
be  significantly  associated  with  the  presence  of  a  MH 
diagnosis. Though there were twice as many orchialgia than 
hydrocele  patients  with  anxiety,  the  relationship  did  not 
meet statistical significance, possibly due to the overall low 
prevalence of anxiety. The incidence of orchialgia began at 
levels  similar  to  prior  reports  in  civilian  populations,  but 
then rose significantly over the study timeframe, possibly 
related  to  the  unique  occupational  hazards  of  the  study 
population. These results may also be skewed by the overall 
higher percentage of MH diagnoses in the study population 
than in the general population.
