Abstract
Objective  Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with increased rates of mental disorders, particularly depression, 
anxiety and binge-eating disorder. GLP-1 receptor agonists are a novel class of pharmacological agents for obesity and T2D. 
We aimed to describe participants’ experiences of GLP-1 receptor agonists on their mental health.
Methods  Qualitative,  individual,  semi-structured  interviews  were  conducted  in  nine  participants  who  were  prescribed 
GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity and/or T2D. Mental health status was measured at time of GLP-1 recep-
tor agonist initiation and assessed again at 12–16 weeks when the semi-structured interview took place. Data were analysed 
using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results  Three main themes were generated from the analysis: (1) acceptance of negative side effects for long term physical 
health benefits; (2) reflections on the diverse impact on mental health; (3) reduced appetite and increased control of eating 
behaviours.
Discussion  Overall, participants with obesity and/or T2D described a positive impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on their 
mental health, especially perception of improved control of eating behaviours. This suggests GLP-1 receptor agonists should 
be further studied for their potential effectiveness for treatment of binge-eating disorder.

Introduction

Glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  receptor  agonists  are  a 
class  of  drugs  developed  initially  for  treatment  of  type  2 
diabetes (T2D) and then obesity, by mimicking the incretin 
effect  which  includes  glucose-dependent  increased  insu-
lin  secretion  and  improved  glycaemic  control,  and  induc-
ing  weight  loss  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  [1].  Obesity 
and T2D are both major global health challenges [2] with

obesity being the main modifiable risk factor for T2D [3]. 
People with both obesity and T2D have a 7-fold increased 
risk of mortality compared to those with neither condition 
[4].

Obesity and T2D are strongly associated with mental dis-
orders. Obesity has a bidirectional relationship with depres-
sion [5] and is associated with higher rates of anxiety [6]. 
Individuals with T2D are also at increased risk of depres-
sion  [7]  and  anxiety  [8];  this  comorbidity  is  associated 
with reduced adherence to diabetic treatment and self-man-
agement  [9]  and  poorer  glycaemic  control  with  increased 
risk  of  diabetes  complications  [10].  Obesity  and  T2D  are 
also  associated with  binge-eating disorder  (BED).  BED  is 
defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth edition (DSM-5) by frequent, recurrent epi-
sodes of binge-eating characterised by eating, in a discrete 
period  of  time,  an  amount  of  food  that  is  definitely  larger 
than  what  most  people  would  eat  in  a  similar  period  of 
time under similar circumstances, causing marked distress,

occurring at least once a week for 3 months, and without any 
compensatory behaviour [11]. A literature review of studies 
in four Latin American countries reported a prevalence of 
BED  of  16–51.6%  among  obese  people  attending  weight 
loss programs [12]; whilst World Health Organisation Men-
tal  Health  Surveys  found  that  people  with  BED  were  3–6 
times  more  likely  to  be  obese  compared  to  those  without 
[13]. Studies have reported a point prevalence of up to 25% 
in T2D, versus 1.4% in the general population [14] and hav-
ing BED increases the risk of incident T2D by 6.5-fold [13].
Recently,  evidence  has  emerged  demonstrating  benefits 
of GLP-1 receptor agonists in other medical conditions e.g. 
polycystic ovarian syndrome [15] and mental disorders. For 
example,  liraglutide,  a  GLP-1  receptor  agonist,  improved 
cognitive function in n = 19 patients with major depressive 
disorder  (MDD)  or  bipolar  disorder  in  a  pilot  randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) [16], whilst a systematic review and 
meta-analysis  reported  a  pooled  reduction  in  depressive 
symptoms with GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to other 
antidiabetic therapies [17].

GLP-1 receptor agonists have known satiety-promoting 
effects due to central action of the neuropeptide GLP-1 [1], 
with  reduced  activation  of  appetite-  and  reward-related 
brain areas in response to food [18]; thus, they were hypoth-
esised as a treatment for BED [19, 20]. An open-label RCT 
in n = 44 patients with obesity and subclinical binge-eating 
found  a  greater  reduction  in  binge-eating  at  12  weeks  in 
liraglutide  versus  control  (diet  and  exercise)  groups  [20]. 
Another open-label RCT observed that dulaglutide (another 
GLP-1 receptor agonist) led to greater reduction of binge-
eating behaviour compared to gliclazide in people with T2D 
and BED [21].

Aims

The aim of this study was to describe experiences of self-
administering  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  and  its  perceived 
impact on mental health in patients with obesity and/or T2D.

Methods

Design

This  was  a  qualitative  study  using  individual  semi-struc-
tured  interviews.  The  Consolidated  Criteria  for  Reporting 
Qualitative  Studies  (COREQ)  checklist  were  followed, 
which is found in the supplementary material (p6).

Setting

The  study  was  carried  out  in  two  settings.  One  was  the 
public  funded  National  Health  Service  tier  3  weight  man-
agement  programme  in  an  inner-city  teaching  hospital 
in  south-east  London,  United  Kingdom  (UK).  In  the  UK, 
weight  management  services  are  organised  in  a  four-tier 
model: community based, primary care, medical therapies 
and surgical interventions. The tier 3 programme is deliv-
ered by a multidisciplinary team including specialist weight 
management dietitians, physiotherapists, psychologists and 
obesity physicians over one year [22]. Participants took part 
in a programme using a gradual calorie reduction or a very 
low-calorie  diet.  Participants  with  obesity  and  pre-diabe-
tes  were  prescribed  subcutaneous  liraglutide  titrated  from 
0.6 mg to 3 mg once daily over two months [22]. In the UK, 
liraglutide is approved for obesity treatment in patients with 
BMI > 35 kg/m2 and non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) 42–47 mmol/mol) and at high risk of 
cardiovascular disease.

The second setting was in two community diabetes ser-
vices  in  south-east  London,  UK,  which  consist  of  consul-
tant  diabetologists,  primary  care  physicians  with  a  special 
interest in diabetes, diabetes specialist nurses and dieticians. 
Patients with T2D were prescribed either oral semaglutide 
(titrated up from 3 mg to 14 mg once daily), subcutaneous 
semaglutide (titrated from 0.25 mg to 1 mg once weekly), 
or subcutaneous liraglutide (titrated from 0.6 mg to 1.8 mg 
once daily) over one month. In the UK, GLP-1 receptor ago-
nists are approved as third line treatment for patients with 
T2D with a BMI of ≥ 35 kg/m2 and specific psychological 
or other medical problems associated with obesity; or with 
a BMI < 35 kg/m2 if insulin therapy would have significant 
occupational  implications,  or  weight  loss  would  benefit 
other obesity-related comorbidities [23].

Participant selection and recruitment

Potential participants were identified from these services and 
invited to participate if they were being newly commenced 
on these medications during the study period (18/09/2022–
04/05/2023).  Eligibility  criteria  were:  being  prescribed  a 
GLP-1 receptor agonist for management of either for obe-
sity or T2D; being at least 18 years of age; capacity to con-
sent; able to converse and read in fluent English.

Acta Diabetologica (2025) 62:731–7421 3Participants

Twenty-five patients consented to be contacted by a member 
of the research team, of which 13 consented to take part in 
the study prior to initiation of the GLP-1  receptor agonist 
and completed baseline questionnaires. Of these, four were 
lost to follow-up and nine participants took part in the inter-
view 12–16 weeks after treatment.

Participant characteristics

Demographic data including age, ethnicity, and gender were 
collected  at  baseline.  Weight  (kg)  and  BMI  (kg/m2)  were 
recorded prior to initiation and after 12–16 weeks of treat-
ment  with  GLP-1  receptor  agonist;  HbA1c  levels  (mmol/
mol)  were  also  recorded  for  participants  with  T2D.  Men-
tal health status was collected at baseline and 12–16 weeks 
of  treatment.  Three  screening  questionnaires,  the  Patient 
Health  Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9)  [24],  Generalised  Anxi-
ety  Disorder-7  (GAD-7)  [25]  assessment  and  Eating  Dis-
order Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) [26] were used 
for  symptoms  of  depression,  anxiety  and  eating  disorders 
respectively.  The  PHQ-9  asks  9  questions  on  depressive 
symptoms  mapped  onto  DSM-5  criteria  for  major  depres-
sive  disorder  (MDD)  [11];  each  item  scores  from  0  to  3, 
giving a final score of 0 to 27. Higher scores reflect greater 
severity  and  a  cut  off  of  10  represents  caseness  for  MDD 
[27]. The GAD-7 is a screening tool and severity measure 
for generalised anxiety disorder. Each item is scored from 
0  to  3,  giving  a  range  of  scores  of  0  to  21;  higher  scores 
indicate  a  greater  severity  and  a  threshold  of  10  has  high 
sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of generalised anxi-
ety  disorder  [25].  The  EDE-Q  is  a  28-item  questionnaire 
adapted from the clinician-based interview Eating Disorder 
Examination, designed to assess the range and severity of 
disordered  eating  using  four  subscales  (Restraint,  Eating 
Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern) and a global 
score [26].

Data collection

Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 
participants 12–16 weeks after starting GLP-1 receptor ago-
nist, to explore experiences of the impact on mental health. 
The  semi-structured  nature  of  the  interviews  allowed  for 
open-ended  questions  to  be  asked,  designed  to  elicit  dis-
cussion,  which  were  guided  by  an  interview  schedule,  to 
ensure  the  interviews  were  systematic  and  comprehensive 
[28]. Interview topics included: overall experience of taking 
the medication; side effects experienced; change in physical 

733

health; mental health; general wellbeing; eating behaviours 
and binge-eating.

The  interview  schedule  was  developed  through  discus-
sion  with  healthcare  professionals  including  a  clinician 
working in a tier 3 obesity service, a diabetes physician, and 
a psychiatrist specialising in diabetes and mental health, as 
well as a member of the public with lived experience of tak-
ing a GLP-1 receptor agonist (see supplementary material 
p3). A  pilot  interview  to  gauge  the  comprehensibility  and 
flow of the interview questions was conducted prior to the 
commencement  of  formal  interviews  with  this  member  of 
the public.

Interviews  were  conducted  by  one  researcher  virtually 
using  the  video-conferencing  software  Microsoft  Teams. 
With  informed  consent,  interviews  were  audio-recorded 
and  automatically  transcribed  using  Microsoft  Teams 
on  encrypted  devices,  with  corrections  to  the  transcrip-
tion  made.  Identifiable  information  was  removed  from 
transcripts.

Data analysis

Interview transcripts were analysed using reflexive thematic 
analysis to identify, analyse and report patterns within the 
data. Two authors carried out the analysis, following Braun 
and  Clarke’s  guide  involving  the  steps  of:  1  familiarisa-
tion of data; 2 generation of codes; 3 combining codes into 
themes; 4 reviewing themes; 5 determining significance of 
themes; 6 reporting of findings [29].

A  combined  deductive/inductive  approach  was  used  to 
explore  the  data  according  to  the  research  aims,  in  addi-
tion to identifying further themes suggested from the data 
itself. An audit trail was kept to establish the confirmability 
of our findings. Clinical data including changes in physical 
health measures (weight, BMI and HbA1c), and their men-
tal health symptomatology screening, were used to describe 
the study sample and give context to the experiences of the 
individual participants.

Study team and theoretical perspective

The  study  was  conducted  by  a  cross-disciplinary  team, 
with expertise in psychology (MB), diabetes (KI, PSG, AP) 
and  psychiatry  (KI,  AP).  AP  is  a  clinical  academic  doc-
tor, specialising in endocrinology, and received training in 
qualitative  research;  MB  is  a  chartered  psychologist  with 
recognised expertise in qualitative methods; KI is a senior 
clinical academic in liaison psychiatry specialising in diabe-
tes and obesity; PSG is a consultant diabetologist and obe-
sity physician.

Results

Participant characteristics

Individual  participant  characteristics  are  described  in 
Table 1. Of the nine participants, the majority were female 
and of white ethnicity. The mean (standard deviation) age 
of participants was 57 (8) years. Five participants were pre-
scribed  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  for  obesity  management; 
four for T2D. The participants on average lost 5.4 (5) % of 
their body weight from baseline to follow-up. BMI reduced 
by  a  mean  of  2.7  (3)  kg/m2.  The  four  participants  treated 
for T2D had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 17 (6) mmol/
mol.  Individual  participant  change  in  PHQ-9,  GAD-7  and 
EDE-Q scores are shown in Table 1.

Themes

Analysis  resulted  in  the  generation  of  three  overarching 
themes  related  to  experiences  of  patients  taking  GLP-1 
receptor agonists (Fig. 1).

Quotations from the participants are presented using best 

exemplars to illustrate the themes.

We included the gender and indication for GLP-1 recep-
tor agonist for the participant in the descriptor of each quote.

Theme 1: Acceptance of negative side effects for 
long term physical health benefits

Most participants described significant weight loss follow-
ing treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Concurrently, 
many  reported  a  change  in  their  appearance,  including  in 
face shape and clothing size.

“The weight is slowly coming off…two months after 
taking  it  I’d  lost  10  kilos…a  year  ago,  I  bought  an 
emergency suit because nothing fitted…today it hangs 
like a sack.” (P1, male, obesity).
“My trousers have started falling down. I have to keep 
adjusting my belt…One day my face ID on my phone 
stopped working…my face ID isn’t recognising me.” 
(P2, male, obesity).

Participants  with  T2D  described  improved  blood  glu-
cose  control  and  reduction  in  HbA1c  values  at  medical 
appointments.  One  participant  with  obesity  reversed  their 
prediabetes.

“I went from [a HbA1c of] 47 to 35. So I’m no longer 
prediabetic.” (P1, male, obesity).

In some cases, this allowed reduction in dose of other medi-
cations such as insulin which they had often been taking for 
many years. This was viewed as very positive as it indicated 
better diabetes control.

“I came off the Novorapid [short-acting insulin]…and 
there’s  a  kind  of  instant  effect  of  the  weight  coming 
down.” (P9, female, diabetes).

Several  participants  reflected  on  improvements  in  a  range 
of  physical  health  issues  including  breathlessness,  back 
pain, frequent urination and urine infections, sleep, and skin 
problems.

“I ran for a bus…a year ago I couldn’t have walked 
to the end of my street without needing a break…I’m 
certainly feeling healthy.” (P1, male, obesity).
“The breathlessness - it’s just gone…Whereas before 
just going to the bathroom or kitchen…I’d be puffing 
and panting.” (P2, male, obesity).

Many participants experienced gastrointestinal side effects 
including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, 
acid reflux and constipation, which varied in severity.

“All  of  a  sudden  I  started  vomiting.”  (P3,  female, 
obesity).
“It’s  horrendous…Every  time  I  think  of  food,  I  feel 
sick to my stomach…It was unbearable at first.” (P8, 
female, diabetes).

Negative  side  effects  typically  improved  over  time,  with 
many  participants  having  no  or  minimal  side  effects  at 
12–16 weeks. Side effects often temporarily worsened when 
the dose was uptitrated.

“Every time I went up a little bit I would feel nauseous 
for like a week and then it would settle down.” (P9, 
female, diabetes).

Universally, participants were willing to tolerate these side 
effects for improvements in physical health including their 
weight.

“I’m quite happy to put up with it to keep this weight 
going down.” (P5, female, obesity).

Some  participants  described  initial  concerns  about  self-
injecting  and  their  ability  to  tolerate  the  needles,  particu-
larly those who were not self-administering insulin already. 
In most cases they found the injections to not be a problem 
upon initiation.

Fig. 1  Generated themes from thematic analysis

“One of my original concerns was would I be able to 
tolerate injections every day.” (P1, male, obesity).
“They’re  the  tiniest  little  things…You  don’t  feel 
them.” (P4, female, obesity).
“I’m used to it… It’s basically the same [as insulin].” 
(P9, female, diabetes).

Several participants expressed a desire for increased avail-
ability  of  the  medication  to  other  people,  and  were  aware 
that the funding was only for a limited period.

“I really appreciate the program. And I hope it’s some-
thing that is more widely available soon. It can make a big 
difference.” (P1, male, obesity).

“I’m their poster boy now. There’s no doubt that I’ll be 
paying  for  it  after  those  two  years…I  wish  everyone  that 
needed it could access it.” (P2, male, obesity).

Some participants favourably compared GLP-1 receptor 
agonists with other treatment options such as bypass surgery 
for obesity.

“I  think  it  really  helped  me.  I  helps  you  lose  weight 
faster…I could say maybe it will be better than the bypass 
surgery.” (P3, female, obesity).

Theme 2: reflections on the diverse impact on 
mental health

The  majority  of  participants  noticed  an  improvement  in 
their general wellbeing and increased hopefulness after hav-
ing struggled with their condition for many years.

“It’s  had  a  positive  effect…I  feel  more  hopeful.”  (P9, 

female, diabetes).

Several  patients  reported 

in  mood, 
including  patients  who  felt  depressed  prior  to  starting  the 
medication.

improvements 

“My general mood is so much better.” (P2, male, obesity).
This  was  reflected  by  a  large  reduction  in  their  PHQ-9 
score of 17 points and accompanied by significant improve-
ments  in  physical  health:  P2  lost  over  11%  of  their  body 
weight.

One participant described reduced hopelessness and sui-

cidal ideation.

“I  think  I’m  less  depressed…I  don’t  have  such  kind 
of low mood…I was having some suicidal ideation…
thoughts of ‘what’s the point’, that kind of pointless, 

Acta Diabetologica (2025) 62:731–7421 3 
hopeless type of thinking. And I don’t have that any-
more.” (P9, female, diabetes).

Some participants described increased resilience, ability to 
cope and self-control with negative emotions following ini-
tiation of a GLP-1 receptor agonist.

737

Interestingly,  however,  this  participant’s  PHQ-9  score 
increased from 6 to 10: when individual items were exam-
ined, mood stayed the same with the change in score sec-
ondary  to  increased  fatigue  and  change  in  appetite.  They 
had a reduction in HbA1c from 67 to 60 mmol/mol. Another 
participant  also  described  reduced  psychological  distress 
but had an increase in PHQ-9 score (P3).

Other participants discussed reduced anxiety levels sec-
ondary to better control of blood glucose and/or food intake.

“Being  able  to  eat  and  not  really  having  to  worry 
about it because it’s [the medication] doing it for me. 
It’s taking all the worry out of the food going in.” (P8, 
female, diabetes).

This participant had a corresponding large reduction in their 
GAD-7 score of 10 points and a drop in HbA1c from 84 to 
68 mmol/mol.

One participant who suffered from borderline personal-
ity disorder (BPD) experienced a significant improvement 
in their mental health such that they were discharged from 
their psychiatry team.

“My community mental health team signed me off… I 
had been due to start DBT [dialectical behaviour ther-
apy], and even before my assessment appointment, I 
was kinda like I’m not sure I actually need this any-
more.” (P2, male, obesity).

This  was  confirmed  by  their  reduction  in  PHQ-9  score  of 
17  points  and  of  their  GAD-7  score  by  7  points,  with  an 
associated weight loss of over 11%. Importantly, they noted 
that  these  mental  health  improvements  had  not  occurred 
when they had achieved this level of weight loss in the past 
through other means e.g. strict dieting; thus, there appeared 
to  be  an  additional  direct  psychological  effect  of  GLP-1 
receptor agonists, rather than the weight loss per se.

Several  participants  reported  improvements  in  self-
esteem,  self-confidence  and  body  image,  which  was  not 
always explained by weight loss, as similar changes in con-
fidence had not been experienced in previously successfully 
weight loss methods.

“[I’m]  feeling  like  I’m  a  worthy  person…and  I 
deserve  my  place  on  Earth…My  confidence  is  defi-
nitely  improved…Again,  it  wouldn’t  have  improved 
at this point when I’ve lost weight before.” (P2, male, 
obesity).

“Someone in the group accused us of excluding every-
one else and the reality is we didn’t…When I first read 
that message, it bothered me, but I was able to let go of 
it really quickly and kind of not let it affect me.” (P2, 
male, obesity).

One participant with a history of depression experienced a 
new episode of depression during the study with an associ-
ated increase in PHQ-9 of from 15 to 20 points despite an 
initial  sense  of  increased  resilience.  Of  note,  the  score  at 
baseline  prior  to  initiation  of  GLP-1  receptor  agonist  was 
already in the moderately-severe depression range.

“It  felt  when  I  was  initially  taking  the  medication…
when  I  was  feeling  down…  I  felt  an  initial  ability 
to  process  and  cope  better  and  quicker.  (P7,  male, 
diabetes)

Improvements in social and interpersonal relationships were 
described,  often  related  to  an  improvement  in  the  partici-
pants’ overall mood and social confidence.

“I’ve got a great relationship with my children…But 
I would say that’s improved actually…We’re having 
more fun…[I feel] a little bit more sociable…a little 
bit more outgoing.” (P9, female, diabetes).

However, some participants reported no subjective change 
in their mental state, particularly if they had no concerns at 
baseline.

“I feel exactly the same. I think after being so unwell 
mentally two and a bit years ago, I think I’d notice.” 
(P4, female, obesity).

Interestingly, these two participants actually had reductions 
in their PHQ-9 score. P4’s PHQ-9 score reduced from 16 to 
4 i.e. from moderately severe depression to minimal symp-
toms, and was the only participant to not lose weight dur-
ing the study, with an increase of 7 kg; P6’s PHQ-9 score 
reduced from 12 to 4, i.e. from moderate depression to mini-
mal symptoms and despite a large reduction in HbA1c from 
84 to 62 mmol/mol.

Theme 3: reduced appetite and increased control of 
eating behaviours

The  most  consistent  theme  emerging  from  the  interviews 
was changes in eating behaviours. All participants described 
reduced appetite due to increased satiety. This led to a sig-
nificant reduction in portion sizes, as well as long periods 
without eating, due to lack of hunger.

“I  just  lost  appetite.  I  don’t  even  feel  hungry  in  the 
whole  day.  Sometimes  I  forget  about  eating.”  (P3, 
female, obesity).
“My dinner size has gone down by half.” (P8, female, 
diabetes).

Some participants described relying on other external cues 
to  eat,  or  forcing  themselves  to  eat  as  they  did  not  feel 
hungry.

“I have to listen to my body for other cues that I need 
to eat, because I can quite happily go out, have a full 
active  day,  and  not  feel  the  need  to  eat  at  all.”  (P1, 
male, obesity).

Participants were overall extremely positive about the appe-
tite-supressing  effect  of  the  medication,  which  was  what 
they were hoping for.

“I’m really enjoying the appetite suppressant element 
of it.” (P9, female, diabetes).

In some cases, the reduced appetite was initially attributed 
to nausea or abdominal pain, though the low appetite per-
sisted once side effects wore off.

“I can feel that I’m eating too much, and then it makes 
me feel like I want to be sick.” (P6, female, diabetes).

In most cases, the types of foods eaten did not change, and 
specifically “healthier” foods were not chosen; rather it was 
quantities that were reduced.

“I’m still eating exactly the same, just less.” (P5, female, 

obesity).

In  a  small  number  of  participants,  food  choices  were 
altered  to  minimise  nausea  and  reflux,  and  in  some  cases 
this led to less healthy food choices.

“It  basically  feels  like  morning  sickness…you  just 
want to eat bland food.” (P9, female, diabetes).
“the quality of my food went down…much more choc-
olate, more carb-based things.” (P9, female, diabetes).

The majority of participants reported reduced cravings and 
snacking in between meals. This was often experienced as 
a  psychological  effect  rather  than  simply  due  to  reduced 
hunger.

“It’s eliminated cravings.” (P1, male, obesity)

“I  don’t  snack  as  much  now….Crisps,  pringles,  that 
would be a craving…I don’t even touch them now.” 
(P8, female, diabetes).

Participants  who  previously  engaged  in  comfort  or  stress 
eating  experienced  reductions  in  these  behaviours.  They 
discussed having increased mindfulness around eating and 
being more intentional when making decisions about food 
choices.

“There’s  less  kind  of  temptation  to  eat  in  the  eve-
ning…whereas before I could be tempted to pick and 
watch a bit of telly and eat some food.” (P9, female, 
diabetes).
“The  mindfulness  of  like  ‘I  don’t  really  want  that, 
you know, what are you getting it for?’” (P4, female, 
obesity).

These reductions in cravings and in emotional eating were 
associated with a decrease in scores in the EDE-Q scores, 
e.g. P9 and P4 had reductions of 2.8 and 1.3 points respec-
tively. Although  this  was  usually  accompanied  by  weight 
loss, P4 was the only participant to gain weight (7 kg) dur-
ing the study. However, this participant had a slower dose 
titration due to their heart failure, so took longer to reach the 
maximum dose; as a result, they stopped taking the medica-
tion prior to the follow-up interview as they felt it was not 
effective.  Interestingly,  they  described  reducing  cravings 
whilst on the medication which then returned after stopping.
Many participants felt they had increased control of their 
eating behaviours and could make better choices regarding 
the food they ate and the quantities they consumed.

“I felt I had more control over my eating…I felt I was 
better able to make choices.” (P7, male, diabetes).
“It’s taken my 74 years to learn what portion control 
can really look like.” (P5, female, obesity).

Two  participants  reported  obsession  with  food  prior  to 
starting a GLP-1 receptor agonist, one of whom was diag-
nosed with BED. Both described previously struggling with 
constant  ruminations  about  food,  even  just  after  finishing 
a  meal,  which  improved  dramatically  with  treatment,  and 
P2’s BED remitted. They reported reduced drive to eat, in 
addition to less physical hunger.

Acta Diabetologica (2025) 62:731–7421 3“It’s  removed  the  ‘I  am  starving’  half  an  hour  after 
I’ve  eaten,  that  I’ve  had  all  my  life…I’ve  never  not 
felt hungry in a way…I could sit down and eat a meal 
and then by the time you’re sort of finished talking I 
knew  I  was  hungry  again…I  can  think  right  back  to 
childhood,  I’ve  always  felt  hungry  and  just  thought 
it’s cause I’m a greedy pig.” (P5, female, obesity).
“I’ve  lived  with  binge-eating  disorder  for  like  25 
years…Literally overnight, when I started taking it, it 
was like a switch had been turned off in my brain and 
all my thoughts about food vanished…So the binge-
eating has gone completely. I’ve not had a single binge 
episode in all that time.” (P2, male, obesity).

This was reflected in their EDE-Q scores which reduced by 
3.5 and 0.7 points for P2 and P5 respectively.

Discussion

We  examined  the  experiences  of  patients  with  obesity  or 
T2D attending medical weight management or community 
diabetes service respectively, who were prescribed a GLP-1 
receptor  agonist,  with  respect  to  changes  in  their  mental 
health including eating behaviours.

We  observed  three  main  themes.  The  first  pertained  to 
physical health effects, with participants reporting an over-
all positive experience of taking the medication, finding that 
the improvements in weight and blood glucose control out-
weighed the gastrointestinal side effects; some found taking 
GLP-1 receptor agonists to be transformational. The second 
demonstrated a range of mental health impacts of the medi-
cation, with some participants experiencing improvements 
in mood, anxiety, confidence, self-esteem and interpersonal 
relations, whereas others felt no different in these regards. 
The third, and most ubiquitous theme, was a change in eat-
ing  behaviours,  both  physical,  with  reduced  appetite  and 
increased  satiety,  as  well  as  psychological,  with  increased 
control of eating, and reduction in cravings, comfort eating 
and food obsession.

Comparing  the  obesity  and  diabetes  sub-cohorts,  the 
overall experience appeared to be more positive for those 
being treated for obesity, who were often delighted with the 
effect  of  the  treatment  and  wished  for  greater  availability 
of the medication. This may be because the physical health 
benefits (i.e. weight loss) in this group were more obvious 
than the improved blood glucose levels seen in the diabetes 
group. In addition, the majority of participants felt the most 
beneficial aspect of the medication was the increased con-
trol of eating behaviours, which was of more importance to 
the obesity cohort in view of the primary aim of the medi-
cation being weight loss. Interestingly, participants did not 

739

report specifically on quality-of-life improvements, includ-
ing for example change in sexual function which has been 
demonstrated previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists [30].
The  strengths  of  this  study  include,  to  our  knowledge, 
that this is the first study to qualitatively describe the expe-
riences of patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists with 
respect  to  mental  health  and  eating  behaviours.  Only  one 
qualitative  study  has  been  conducted  to  date  investigat-
ing  patients  taking  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  [31],  which 
focussed on reasons for adherence to the medication. Sec-
ond,  our  sample  was  diverse  in  terms  of  ethnicity,  gender 
and socioeconomic status and for being set in the public sec-
tor and in the inner city. Third, the study is unique in also 
using validated questionnaires for mental disorders common 
in obesity and T2D to standardise the baseline mental health 
characteristics of the participants and attempt to substanti-
ate and further interpret the subjective experience of change 
in  mental  health  with  change  in  scores.  Fourth,  involving 
the  public  in  the  development  of  the  topic  guide  ensured 
the research was more relevant to the needs and preferences 
of patients affected by obesity and T2D. Finally, collecting 
biomedical as well as qualitative data allowed interpretation 
of subjective experiences in the context of changes in physi-
cal health parameters.

There are several important limitations. First, the small 
sample  size  was  secondary  to:  (a)  a  national  shortage  of 
GLP-1 receptor agonists during the study period [32] with 
pharmacy availability issues; (b) a paucity of computer liter-
acy in the patient population, meaning several potential par-
ticipants were unable to use MS Teams for the interviews; 
and (c) a slow return to usual care post-Covid-19 pandemic. 
Thus,  this  could  be  considered  an  exploratory  study,  with 
further data required for definitive conclusions to be drawn. 
Second,  we  did  not  assess  adherence  to  medication  in  the 
sample; for example, P5 only took liraglutide for 1 month 
due to logistical issues, whilst P4 stopped just prior to the 
follow-up  appointment  due  to  perceived  lack  of  efficacy. 
Some  participants  may  have  been  reluctant  to  report  poor 
adherence  to  maintain  social  desirability.  Finally,  dura-
tion of follow-up was only 12–16 weeks; a longer follow-
up period would be useful to identify long-term effects of 
GLP-1  receptor  agonists  on  mental  health  and  effects  of 
newer,  perhaps  more  efficacious  GLP-1  receptor  agonists 
at higher doses  which  have since  been approved e.g. sub-
cutaneous semaglutide (up to a dose of 2.4 mg weekly), or 
dual  gastric  inhibitory  polypeptide  (GIP)/GLP-1  receptor 
agonists e.g. tirzepatide, approved for T2D and undergoing 
appraisal currently by the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) for obesity.

Our findings suggest that most experienced improvement 
in  mental  health  but  not  necessarily  secondary  to  weight 
loss. This may in part be due to a positive perception of the 

Acta Diabetologica (2025) 62:731–7421 3740

relative ease of weight loss with the medication. However, 
it additionally raises the possibility of a direct brain effect 
of GLP-1 receptor agonists that could target mental disor-
ders common in obesity and T2D. Participants were able to 
distinguish  between  a  physical  effect  e.g.  reduced  hunger, 
from  a  psychological  effect,  namely  change  in  cognitions 
(reduced thinking about food) and affect (reduced anxiety). 
Landmark preclinical studies using animal knockouts have 
demonstrated that GLP-1 receptors in the brain are capable 
of controlling food intake and body weight, in addition to 
the  hypophagic  effects  of  endogenous  GLP‐1  via  periph-
eral  GLP‐1  receptors  [33].  Data  suggest  the  requirement 
of  GLP‐1  receptors  in  both  the  vagal  afferents  as  well  as 
the brain for the full effects of GLP‐1 receptor agonists on 
energy  balance,  with  the  hypothalamus  being  the  primary 
downstream  target  of  peripherally  administered  GLP‐1 
receptor  agonists.  An  RCT  in  obese  patients  found  that 
GLP-1 receptor activation by the agonist exenatide reduced 
brain  responses  on  functional  MRI  to  food  cues  in  appe-
tite- and reward-related brain areas including the insula and 
amygdala, correlating with reductions in food intake [18]. 
Furthermore,  a  systematic  review  demonstrated  beneficial 
effects of GLP-1 in reward system-related disorders pertain-
ing to both drugs of abuse and palatable foods [34]. These 
findings are in keeping with pilot clinical studies showing a 
beneficial effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on binge-eating 
[20,  21]  and  confirms  the  need  for  larger  clinical  trials  of 
this class of drugs in BED.

Despite not being a primary aim of the study, by collect-
ing participant characteristics we saw clinically significant 
improvements  in  physical  health  (weight  and  HbA1c),  of 
similar magnitude to that seen in trials of GLP-1  receptor 
agonists in obesity [35] and T2D and overweight [36, 37]. 
This suggests our sample was representative of those who 
could benefit from GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Although this was an unselected sample of participants 
with  respect  to  mental  illness,  nearly  all  participants  had 
clinically significant depressive symptoms and anxiety. This 
is  in  keeping  with  the  known  association  between  obesity 
and  T2D  and  psychiatric  illness. Although  the  purpose  of 
the  study  was  not  to  conduct  quantitative  analyses,  ques-
tionnaire data showed a trend towards reduction in PHQ-9, 
GAD-7 and EDE-Q scores (Table 1), which were clinically 
significant  given  that  change  scores  of  5,  4  and  0.57  are 
considered  the  minimal  clinically  important  differences 
in  PHQ-9,  GAD-7  and  total  EDE-Q  scores  respectively 
[38–40].  We  would  therefore  recommend  powered  quan-
titative  studies  investigating  changes  in  psychiatric  symp-
toms pre- and post-treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
In  particular,  studies  investigating  whether  patients  would 
tolerate negative side effects for mental health benefits are 
warranted, as this was not specifically found in our study, 

though universally participants accepted the side effects for 
physical health benefits.

Implications

This  study  adds  to  growing  evidence  that  GLP-1  receptor 
agonists  have  a  positive  effect  on  mental  health,  and  thus 
could  be  a  particularly  good  treatment  option  for  patients 
with  obesity  and/or  T2D  with  comorbid  psychiatric  ill-
ness. It remains unclear whether these drugs are beneficial 
in people with anxiety or depression who do not also have 
obesity or T2D, which also warrants further investigation. 
Our study importantly suggests that the beneficial effects on 
mental  health  were  not  entirely  explained  by  weight  loss; 
thus, there may be a direct brain effect leading to improved 
mood. Our study concurs with previous data regarding the 
efficacy  of  GLP-1  receptor  agonists  in  binge-eating  disor-
der,  as  demonstrated  by  the  remission  of  the  patient  with 
BED at baseline. We therefore hypothesise that this class of 
medication could be repurposed for BED, and larger scale 
clinical trials should be planned to investigate this.

Conclusion

This  study  highlights  the  wide-ranging  impacts  of  GLP-1 
receptor agonists on mental health outcomes. Findings have 
highlighted the potentially beneficial effect on mental health 
and the potential to be repurposed for BED.
