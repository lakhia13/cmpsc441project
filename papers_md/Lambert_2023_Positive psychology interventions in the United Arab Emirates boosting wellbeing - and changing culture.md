Abstract
As the science of wellbeing has grown, universities have adopted the challenge of prioritizing the wellbeing of students. Positive
psychology interventions (PPIs), activities designed to increase the frequency of positive emotions and experiences, which help
to facilitate the use of actions and thoughts that lead to human flourishing, are being increasingly used worldwide. Known to
boost wellbeing and a number of other variables, it nonetheless remains unknown whether their use can influence other variables
in non-Western cultures. In this study, we determined the impact of PPIs on a variety of wellbeing outcomes. The 6-week PPI
program was conducted in the United Arab Emirates on Emirati university students (n = 120) who reported more positive
emotion and overall balance of feelings that favored positivity over time relative to a control group. Yet, there was no effect
found on negative emotions, life satisfaction, perceived stress, fear of happiness, locus of control, or somatic symptoms, and no
effect on levels of collectivism or individualism. Our findings nonetheless support the use of PPIs in higher education as they
show an increase in the experience of positive emotion, with this in itself bringing positive life outcomes, and no negative impact
on culture. Our findings serve to build a foundation for understanding for whom PPIs work best - and least - around the world.

Academic institutions are increasingly being held accountable
for the wellbeing of their students (Baik et al., 2019;
Hernández-Torrano et al., 2020). Rates of mental illness and
psychological distress peak in young adulthood and resist a
return to pre-university levels (Bewick et al., 2010; de
Girolamo et al., 2012; Macaskill, 2013). A way to improve
this is via positive psychology interventions (PPIs), which are
strategies to facilitate the actions, thoughts and emotions con-
ducive towards wellbeing. These can be deployed in many
settings, including universities. Yet, these strategies are often
derived from Western contexts and may be counterproductive
in that their promotion may undermine cultural values, which
in themselves contribute to wellbeing in non-Western nations.
Further, there is increasing interest in the specificity of such

interventions; overall, they work, but at a more granular level,
they may not work in the same way or as effectively for ev-
eryone. This study, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
addressed this line of inquiry; while PPIs are known to in-
crease wellbeing and decrease illbeing, it was of interest to
see whether they had the same impact in a non-Western na-
tion, as well as what changes they had on levels of individu-
alism, locus of control, and other variables.

Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs)

PPIs are the empirically validated activities designed to in-
crease the frequency of positive emotions and experiences,
as well as perceptions of life satisfaction. These targets com-
prise the standard means of understanding wellbeing (Parks &
Biswas-Diener, 2013) and PPIs facilitate the use of actions
and cognitions that lead to it. The range of PPIs is vast (e.g.
Walsh et al., 2016; Woodworth et al., 2016) and can include
acts of kindness (Curry et al., 2018), goal pursuits (Klug &
Maier, 2015), and imagining time as scarce (Layous et al.,
2018). Meta-analyses show that PPIs reliably improve the
experience of positive emotion and life satisfaction; they also
decrease negative emotionality in a sustainable manner

relative to control groups, with changes lasting up to one year
post-intervention (Bolier et al., 2013; Carr et al.,2020 ;
Chakhssi et al., 2018; Hendriks, Schotanus-Dijkstra et al.,
2020; Weiss et al., 2016). PPIs also protect against stress
and attenuate symptoms of mental illness and emotional dis-
tress (Layous et al., 2014; Riches et al., 2016; Shin &
Lyubomirsky, 2016; Taylor et al., 2017). More broadly, great-
er wellbeing lends itself to many positive outcomes, i.e., pro-
social action (Rand et al., 2015; Son & Wilson,2012 ), better
relationships (Mehl et al., 2010; Richards & Huppert, 2011),
stronger academic performance (Howell, 2009; Suldo et al.,
2011), and workplace productivity (Krekel et al., 2019) as
examples.

PPIs and Culture

While personality factors have been the most widely studied
variable of “intervention fit” to date (i.e., Mongrain et al.,
2018; Schueller, 2010, 2012; Senf & Liau, 2013), culture
and religion also influence wellbeing (e.g., Ngamaba &
Soni, 2018; Ye et al., 2015). In fact, scholars encourage pos-
itive psychology to consider wellbeing from diverse cultural
views (Diener et al., 2018; Wong & Roy, 2017), especially in
the Middle East/North Africa region where the literature is
scant (Lambert et al., 2015; Rao et al., 2015). Reviews none-
theless show that the dissemination of PPIs is growing glob-
ally (Hendriks, Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2018; Kim et al.,
2018), with one third of PPI studies now occuring in non-
Western countries (Hendriks, Warren et al., 2018). Still,
Hendriks et al. (2020) found these studies reported far higher
effect sizes or no efficacy. Much can be attributed to their low
quality; yet, that cultural factors might be at work remained a
possibility. This variability is not exceptional: even Western
replication studies are not always successful in showing the
same outcomes (e.g. Mongrain & Anselmo-Matthews, 2012).
In non-Western nations, these imported PPIs also come
with their unacknowledged individualistic and democratic
values (Bermant et al., 2011; Christopher & Hickinbottom,
2008; Joshanloo, 2013; Yakushko & Blodgett, 2021), and
use as the norm, WEIRD participants (i.e., Western,
Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic), limiting their
generalizability to other parts of the world (Hendriks, Warren
et al., 2018; Henrich et al., 2010). Western notions of individ-
ualism are intertwined in seemingly benign activities intended
to increase wellbeing by acting on an autonomous self, e.g.,
self-efficacy, self-esteem, self-worth (Foody et al., 2013;
Hendriks, Warren, et al., 2018; Wong & Roy, 2017;
Yakushko & Blodgett, 2021). This ‘self’ focus is often at odds
with an interdependent self (Brewer & Chen, 2007;
Hashimoto & Yamagishi, 2013). Assumptions around the de-
sire for and, universality of happiness are also rife (see Lutz &
Passmore, 2019) despite the fact that many cultures do not
explicitly pursue happiness. Joshanloo et al. (2014, 2015)

reveal that in segments of Muslim populations (and else-
where), there is a fear of happiness. A UAE study (Lambert,
Passmore, & Joshanloo, 2019) confirmed that participants in-
deed held these beliefs, which were minimized through PPI
use. This latter study, as well as another conducted in Kuwait
(Lambert, Passmore, Scull et al., 2019) nonetheless tested the
effects of eight and 14 week long PPI programs, both of which
were successful in increasing the balance of positive affect and
reports of life satisfaction.

Correlates of Wellbeing

While measures of positive and negative feelings as well as
life satisfaction, that is, a subjective, cognitive judgement or
belief about one’s life (Diener et al., 2009), often comprise
how wellbeing is construed and the standard outcomes in most
studies, other variables are also of interest; we examine cul-
tural dimensions, locus of control, somatization, and stress.

Culture

Hofstede’s (2001) cultural dimensions classify nations on the
dimensions of power distance (acceptance of class inequality),
masculinity (competitiveness, assertiveness), uncertainty
avoidance (valuing order and tradition), and individualism
(the extent to which individuals are expected to follow per-
sonal interests over those supported by the group). With re-
spect to the latter, the UAE is described,

“The United Arab Emirates, with a score of 25 is con-
sidered a collectivistic society. This is manifest in a
close long-term commitment to the member ‘group’,
be that a family, extended family, or extended relation-
ships. Loyalty in a collectivist culture is paramount, and
over-rides most other societal rules and regulations”
(Hofstede Insight, n.d.).

Higher collectivism and lower individualism remain the
norm in the UAE (Alteneiji, 2015; Engin & McKeown,
2017; Willemyns, 2008; Wright & Bennett, 2008). Yet,
Hills and Atkins (2013) noted that although values and behav-
ioral norms across UAE workplaces converged with Western
work norms, cultural groups reverted to their personal values
outside of work. As culture shapes social relationships, obli-
gations, decisions, goals, and the development of the self, and
individuals themselves select aspects of the culture that suit
them best, there is great variance (Akkus et al., 2017; Steele &
Lynch, 2013; Steel et al., 2018), requiring measures of adher-
ence to such values.

Such nuances include (Triandis, 2001; Triandis & Suh,
2002): (1) Horizontal Individualism, where individuals desire

Curr Psychol (2023) 42:7475–7488

7477

to be unique and value individual autonomy, but view them-
selves as equal in importance to others and prefer not to stand
out (e.g. Sweden, Denmark, Norway); (2) Vertical
Individualism, where individuals strive to behave autono-
mously, and the notion of competition relative to others is
prioritized (e.g. USA, UK, France); (3) Horizontal
Collectivism, where individuals perceive themselves to be in-
terdependent with, and equal to others in status and where
sociability is prized (e.g. Brazil, Latin America); and (4)
Vertical Collectivism, where hierarchy is valued, preference
is for in-group goals, and duties as well as obligations are
prioritized (e.g. India, Japan, Korea). The descriptions account
for the degree to which cultures value equality (i.e., horizon-
tality) or hierarchy (i.e., verticality), while espousing a focus
on the self or others.

Higher scores in vertical individualism are associated with
lower wellbeing (i.e., Humphrey et al., 2020; Zalewska &
Zawadzka, 2016). Oishi’s (2000) study of 39 nations revealed
that horizontal individualism was positively associated with
life satisfaction, while vertical collectivism showed the oppo-
site. Orientations have an effect on social dynamics which
influence wellbeing. For example, a study in South Korea
and the USA showed that pro-self individuals endorsed verti-
cal individualistic values more strongly, while prosocial indi-
viduals endorsed more horizontal collectivistic values (Moon
et al., 2018). Another study across Chinese and US cities
showed that vertical individualism drove stigmatizing atti-
tudes in the workplace (Rao et al., 2010). Further, employees
who held horizontal collectivism values were more resilient
against the impact of incivility and discrimination compared
to those who held horizontal individualism values (Welbourne
et al., 2015). As cultural orientations amplify wellbeing, we
examine them here.

Locus of Control

Locus of control (LOC; Rotter, 1966) is also of interest. Those
with an internal LOC see themselves as responsible for their
outcomes and rely on their abilities to commit to goals. They
are motivated by internal rewards, such as pleasure, interest,
and achievement. In contrast, those with an external LOC
believe their outcomes are determined by fate, luck, or other
people, pursuing indirect action, such as gaining influence,
and blaming others when things fail. LOC differences have
varied outcomes. Externals may be at greater risk for depres-
sion and stress (Afifi, 2007; Griffin, 2014; Quevedo & Abella,
2014; Verme, 2009). Internals show greater goal progress and
stronger performance as they believe effort drives the pursuit
(Hortop et al., 2013; Kirkpatrick et al., 2008). This generates
stronger emotional wellbeing (Hortrop et al., 2013). Indeed,
internal LOC tends to be related to greater wellbeing (e.g.
Knappe & Pinquart, 2009; Moore, 2007; Oladipo et al.,

2013). Given its relevance for wellbeing, we examine it in
the present study.

Physical Health

Also included is somatization, psychological distress
expressed through physical ailment, which appears as a key
construct in the Arab world (Al Busaidi, 2010; Al Gelban,
2009; El-Rufaie, 2005; Hamdan, 2009). Studies in Saudi
Arabia (Becker, 2004) and Egypt (Alsaleem & Ghazwani,
2014) found that the prevalence of somatization to be compa-
rable to international rates, while Wilkins et al. (2018), who
studied somatization in a Qatar hospital, found that younger
females and non-national Arab patients had twice as many
complaints. It may be more socially acceptable and less stig-
matizing to report ailments in this way (Wang et al., 2015).

Evidence supports the notion of wellbeing contributing to
physical health (Diener et al., 2017; Ong et al., 2018). The use
of PPIs as a means to boost wellbeing have been successful in
minimizing self-reported limitations in physical health
(Lambert et al., 2015), with positive correlations between the
experience of positive affect and fewer reported health symp-
toms (Pettit et al., 2001; Pressman & Cohen, 2005). Physical
health is related to mental health (Ryff et al., 2006; Ryff &
Singer, 2008) and positive emotions mitigate the physiologi-
cal and cognitive effects of negative emotions and stress
(Frederickson et al., 2000; Segerstrom & Miller, 2004).
Greater wellbeing also enables individuals to engage in better
health behaviors (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005; Veenhoven,
2008).

Perceptions of Stress

Finally, university students experience significant stress dur-
ing their academic years (Al Ghailani et al., 2018; January
et al., 2018; Syed et al., 2018) and receive fewer supports
(Arnett, 2006; Lambert, Abdulrehman et al., 2019). Stress
relates negatively to life satisfaction and subjective wellbeing
(Civitci, 2015; Coccia & Darling, 2016; Karaman et al.,
2018). As PPIs attenuate stress, depression, and anxiety, as
well as increase wellbeing, i.e., positive emotion and life sat-
isfaction (Bolier et al., 2013; Carr et al., 2020; Hendriks et al.,
2020; Weiss et al., 2016), they may be helpful with the strains
of university life.

The Present Study

This quasi-experimental study evaluated changes in subjective
wellbeing after participating in a 6-week PPI program relative
to a control group. It examined the impact of such a program
on aspects of wellbeing including locus of control, cultural
orientation, reports of somatic symptoms and stress. We

hypothesized that there would be a significant Time by
Condition interaction, such that those in the treatment condi-
tion would indicate greater positive changes over time in com-
parison to those in the control condition.

Method

Participants

Participants were students at the first author’s former institu-
tion and the site of where ethics approval was granted. A total
of 120 participants were used in the analysis (78% female),
with 50 non-participants in the control condition and 70 par-
ticipants in the treatment condition. Of those in the treatment
condition, 21 participants (30%) provided data at all three time
points. Of those in the control condition, 29 participants (58%)
provided data at all three time points. The majority of partic-
ipants (68%) were from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and all
were Emirati national citizens. Most participants (83%) were
reportedly between the ages of 18 and 29 years old, but ages
ranged from less than 17 years old to greater than 60 years old.

Procedure

A call for participation was sent across the College of
Humanities and Social Sciences student body; those interested
self-registered for the program, while non-participating stu-
dents attending psychology classes taught by the first author
were assigned to the control group. Four renditions of the
multi-component positive psychology intervention program
were run during the 2018–2019 academic year. As recom-
mended (i.e. Mangan et al., 2020), each 6-week iteration
was deliberately commenced a few weeks into the term to
avoid capturing an overly optimistic start of term or unnatu-
rally stressed exam period. Each iteration involved identical
weekly sessions that lasted 1.5 h for six weeks, and was de-
livered by the primary author. Each session included a short
lesson on the topic, group discussion, insight oriented ques-
tions, and positive psychology interventions to complete in
the class and practise in the week. No incentives were given
for participation and participants gave informed consent.
Measures were taken online before, after, and three months
post-treatment. Analyses was conducted by the remaining au-
thors. The topics covered and PPIs used are noted in Table 1.

Measures

As English was the institutional language of instruction in which
all students studied, scales were given in their English version. A
total of seven scales were administered, which included;

Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE; Diener
et al., 2009, 2010). The 12-item SPANE measures positive feel-
ings (SPANE-P; the summation of six items; α = .91), negative

feelings (SPANE-N; the summation of six items; α = .86), and
the balance between the two (SPANE-B; calculated by
subtracting the total score on the negative sub-scale from the total
score on the positive sub-scale; α = .91). Participants are present-
ed with a list of emotions (e.g. pleasant, unpleasant, happy, sad)
and asked to rate how often they have experienced those feelings
during the past 4 weeks on a 1 (Very rarely or never) to 5 (Very
often or always) Likert scale. The SPANE has good reliability
and validity (Diener et al., 2010), as well as high factor loadings
for the SPANE-P and SPANE-N. The construct validity of the
overall SPANE is good, with moderate to very high correlations
with other measures.

Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985).
The 5-item scale (α = .86) assesses an individual’s overall
judgment of satisfaction with their life as a whole (Pavot &
Diener, 2008). Items (e.g., “I am satisfied with my life”, “If I
could live my life over, I would change almost nothing”) are
rated on a 7-point scale with end points of 1 = strongly dis-
agree and 7 = strongly agree. Scores range from 5 to 35, with
the neutral point at 20. The SWLS has high internal consis-
tency (0.79 and higher), while test-retest reliability and con-
vergent validity is also high (Pavot & Diener, 1993).

Academic Locus of Control Scale (ALCS; Trice, 1985).
The ALCS is a 28-item scale (α = .70) to measure students’
perceptions of the internal or external control they have over
their educational outcomes. Lower scores indicate a more in-
ternal locus of control, while higher scores suggest a more
external locus of control. Sample items include, “There are
some subjects in which I could never do well” and “I feel I
will someday make a real contribution to the world if I work
hard at it” (reversed). Trice (1985) reported internal consisten-
cy for the scale to be .70.

The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (Cohen, Kamarck, &
Mermelstein, 1983) is a 10-item scale (α = .82) measuring
the perception of stress in the past month and degree to which
situations in one’s life are appraised as unpredictable and un-
controllable. The scale is well used with a review showing it
had good statistical properties (Lee, 2012) and was valid for
use among undergraduate students. Items (e.g. “In the last
month, how often have you been upset because of something
that happened unexpectedly”) were scored on a0 (Never) to 4
(Very Often) scale.

The Somatic Symptom Scale - 8 (SSS-8; Gierk et al., 2014)
assesses somatic symptom burden by an 8-item self-report
scale (α = .68). Respondents rate how much they are bothered
by symptoms within the last seven days on a 5-point scale
(1 = Not at all, 5 = Very much). Items include stomach prob-
lems, back pain, sleep trouble, etc. It has high internal consis-
tency and content validity.

Individualism and Collectivism Scale (Singelis et al., 1995;
Triandis & Gelfland, 1998): These 16 items include 4 subscales
(4 items each) which capture aspects of collectivism and individ-
ualism; this includes vertical (VC; α = .86) or horizontal (HC;

α = .79) collectivism (seeing the self as part of a group and
willing to accept hierarchy and inequality versus perceiving all
members as equal) and vertical (VI; α = .71) or horizontal (HI;
α = .73) individualism (seeing the self as independent and
accepting that inequality exists, or that equality is the norm).
The scale distinguishes between the orientations and asks respon-
dents how they perceive the importance of the group/self with
respect to it. The scale and its broader construct have been fre-
quently used in the field of cross-cultural consumer psychology
(e.g. Shavitt et al., 2006; Shavitt & Barnes, 2020).

Fear of Happiness Scale (FHS; Joshanloo, 2013; Joshanloo
et al., 2014). The 5-item scale (α = .86) captures the stable
belief that happiness is a sign of impending unhappiness.
Each item is rated on a 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly
agree) scale, and a total score is made up of the sum of all 5
items. The measure is considered reliable (Joshanloo, 2013)
and with good statistical properties (Joshanloo et al., 2014,
2015). An example item includes, “I prefer not to be too joyful
because usually joy is followed by sadness.”

Results

Multilevel modeling (MLM) was used1; this was necessary as
data at each time point (level 1; L1) were nested within

1 Sensitivity analyses were run using repeated measures ANOVA to examine
the Condition x Time interaction for each of the dependent variables. Results
were largely consistent with the MLM findings reported in the main text,
except there was an additional interaction showing a treatment effect for neg-
ative affect. Specifically, the treatment group’s negative affect statistically
significantly decreased from Time 1 to Time 2 and increased from Time 2 to
Time 3, whereas the control group’s negative affect increased from Time 1 to
Time 2 and did not statistically significantly change from Time 2 to Time 3.
However, these findings involved listwise deleting 70 cases, and we therefore
feel more confident in the MLM results reported in the main text.

persons (level 2; L2). Condition was considered an L2 vari-
able as it differed across individuals. Multilevel modeling
allowed us to use data from all participants, even if they were
not able to complete all three measurement. Each dependent
measure was run with a separate two-level model. Time (L1)
was centered and coded such that −1 = pre-treatment, 0 = im-
mediately post-treatment, and 1 = 3-month post-treatment.
Condition was coded such that 0 = Control and 1 =
Treatment condition. We first ran an intercepts-only model
to obtain an intraclass correlation for each dependent mea-
sures, which ranged from .52 to .76. The equations below
are an example of the intercepts-only model used to test the
positive emotions outcome.

Level 1: SPANE-Pij = β0j + eij.
Level 2: β0j = γ00 + u0j.
At Level 1, the positive affect score (SPANE-P) on occa-
sion i for person j is a function of the mean SPANE-P score for
person j (β0j), and a residual term around person j’s mean (eij).
At Level 2, the mean SPANE-P score for person j (β0j) is a
function of the grand mean for SPANE-P across all persons in
the sample (γ00), and an intercept residual term signifying
person j’s deviation from the grand mean (u0j).

We tested each model for random intercepts and random
slopes using a cut-off of p = .10 to determine whether to in-
clude random effects (Nezlek & Mroziński, 2020). Each mod-
el was built beginning with the intercepts only model above,
which displayed significant between-person residual variance
in the intercepts for all dependent measures. Thus, random
intercepts were included in all subsequent models, which
allowed for the intercepts to vary by person.

We then tested a model that included effects of the L1 Time
variable. This model tested whether fixed or random slopes
were more appropriate for the predictor. Random slopes allow
the slope of Time to vary by person, whereas fixed slopes hold

7480

the slope of Time consistent across people. Time was the only
L1 variable and therefore the only variable that was tested for
random slopes and only for a linear effect. Equations for the
model of positive emotions (which had a random slope for
Time) are shown as an example.

Level 1: SPANE-Pij = β0j + β1j(Time) + eij.
Level 2: β0j = γ00 + u0j.
β1j = γ10 + u1j.
In this model, at Level 1, a person’s SPANE-P score is now
also a function of slope of Time (β1j(Time)). At Level 2, an
individual’s slope of Time (β1j) is a function of the average
slope (γ10), and the individual’s residual variance around the
average slope (u1j).

Next, the Condition (L2) variable was added to the model.
For those models with random slopes, a cross-level
(Condition x Time) interaction was tested in addition to the
main effects of Condition and Time that were tested for all
outcomes. The main term of interest was the Time x Condition
interaction, which tests the extent to which the effects of time
were moderated by condition. A statistically significant Time
x Condition interaction would indicate that participants in one
group changed over time differently than participants in the
other group, indicating treatment efficacy if this difference
favored the treatment group. The main effects of Condition
do not speak to treatment efficacy, but an overall difference
between groups when scores at the three measurement time
points were averaged within each group. Such differences
may reflect different baseline starting points. Also, a main
effect of Time would indicate an overall change over time
on the outcome for both groups. Variables that were analyzed
using random slopes – and tested for a Time x Condition
interaction – included satisfaction with life, positive emotions,
balance of emotions, and horizontal collectivism, as these out-
comes exhibited statistically significant variance in individ-
uals’ slopes for Time.

The formula below is an example of the equations testing a

cross-level interaction for SPANE-P scores.

Level 1: SPANE-Pij = β0j + β1j(Time) + eij.
Level 2: β0j = γ00 + γ01(Condition) + u0j.
β1j = γ10 + γ11(Condition) + u1j.
In this model, Condition effects are added to Level 2, such
that the mean of an individual’s score on SPANE-P is now
also a function of the expected score change between treat-
ment conditions (γ01(Condition)). The slope of an individ-
ual’s SPANE-P score is now also a function of the expected
effect of Condition on the slope of Time (γ11(Condition)).

For all models that used fixed slopes (those testing negative
emotions, somatic symptoms, locus of control, fear of happi-
ness, perceived stress, horizontal individualism, vertical indi-
vidualism and vertical collectivism), tests of the cross-level
interactions were contraindicated. Since these outcomes did
not exhibit statistically significant variance in individuals’
slopes for Time, the treatment Condition could not moderate

the effects of Time, rendering no treatment efficacy with re-
spect to these outcomes. These models were still tested for
main effects of Condition and Time, but because these tests
do not speak to treatment efficacy, they are not discussed in
detail. Results from these models are in Table 2.

Positive Emotions

The final model for SPANE-P consisted of random intercepts
and random slopes to test the effects of Time, Condition, and
the Time x Condition interaction on positive emotions. There
were no statistically significant main effects of Time or
Condition on positive emotions, but there was a significant
Time x Condition interaction (b = 1.15, SE = 0.47, 95% CI
[0.21, 2.09], p = .017). Investigation of the simple slopes re-
vealed that those in the treatment condition showed a statisti-
cally significant, positive simple slope for Time (b = 0.77,
SE = 0.35, p = .028). This indicates that those in the treatment
condition increased in self-reported positive emotions over
time. In contrast, there was no statistically significant simple
slope for Time in the control condition (b = −0.38, SE = 0.32,
p = .248). Overall, there was a treatment effect for positive
emotions. Table 3 shows regression coefficients from the final
model for positive emotions (SPANE-P).

Balance of Emotions

The final model for balance between positive and negative
emotions consisted of random intercepts and random slopes.
There were no main effects of Time or Condition on the bal-
ance of emotions, but there was a statistically significant Time
x Condition interaction (b = 2.33, SE = 0.84, 95% CI [0.67,
4.02], p = .007). Simple slopes analyses revealed that those in
the treatment condition showed a statistically significant, pos-
itive simple slope for Time (b = 1.37, SE = 0.62, p = .030).
This indicates that those in the treatment condition increased
in the balance of emotions, showing a preponderance of pos-
itive relative to negative emotions over time for the treatment
group. In contrast, in the control condition there was no sta-
tistically significant effect of Time on SPANE-B scores (b =
−0.97, SE = 0.57, p = .093). Table 3 shows regression coeffi-
cients from the final model for balance of emotions.

Satisfaction with Life and Horizontal Collectivism

The final models for satisfaction with life and horizontal col-
lectivism consisted of random intercepts and random slopes.
There were no statistically significant Time x Condition inter-
actions in either of these models, indicating that the treatment
did not impact participants’ satisfaction with life or horizontal
collectivism over time. There were no statistically significant
main effects of Time or Condition on these dependent
measures.

Discussion

This study contributes to the growing literature on PPIs and
supports their effectiveness on certain aspects of wellbeing.
Our hypothesis was partially supported, with participants in
the PPI program reporting more positive emotion and an over-
all balance of feelings that favored positivity over time in
comparison to the control group. This is not insignificant;
the frequency of positive emotion contributes to beneficial
outcomes. Posited by the Broaden and Build model
(Fredrickson, 2006), the accumulation of positive emotions

leads to greater cognitive flexibility and broader perceptions
of possibility, as well as the building of physical, social, cog-
nitive and psychological resources. As examples, the experi-
ence of positive emotion facilitates a resumption of pre-stress
levels of functioning (Fredrickson et al., 2000), health-
promoting actions such as not smoking, partaking in physical
activity, and eating more healthily (Blanchflower et al., 2012;
Grant et al., 2009), and longevity (Pressman & Cohen, 2012;
Zhang & Han, 2016). Positive emotions also boost resiliency
(Cohn et al., 2009), stimulate better decision-making
(Chuang, 2007) and a sense of agency with which to make
changes in life (Chang et al., 2017). Their experience also
appears to reduce psychosomatic health symptoms
(Karampas et al., 2016), although we did not observe that
change in this study. A recent review explored the effects of
PPIs on positive emotions specifically (Moskowitz et al.,
2021), showing they were one of the key pathways through
which physical and psychological health could be influenced.
At the same time, contrary to hypotheses, there was insuf-
ficient evidence that the PPI program affected participant’s
life satisfaction, perceived stress, locus of control or somatic
symptoms. This is curious as a previous study done in the
UAE using the same program did show changes to life satis-
faction (i.e. Lambert, Passmore, & Joshanloo, 2019); the only
difference being that participants were Arab nationals of
neighboring countries and not UAE nationals. Another study
in neighboring Kuwait (i.e. Lambert, Passmore, Scull et al.,
2019) also showed changes to life satisfaction, but only in
university students, and not secondary school students. It
should be noted that in these two studies, facilitators had a
pre-existing relationship with participants, which was not the
case here, and which may have impacted findings (i.e. Durlak

7482

Curr Psychol (2023) 42:7475–7488

et al., 2011; Stockings et al., 2016). Too few studies exist to
determine whether these findings are indicative of a cultural
nuance in life satisfaction, an artifact of the study conditions,
or whether the population studied is too young to report sig-
nificant life changes.

The nature of the life satisfaction measure may also have
affected our findings. Morrison et al. (2011) found that re-
spondents used factors such as employment, health, or stan-
dard of living to assess this question when overall living con-
ditions were good, but more likely to use perceptions of soci-
etal success when their life conditions were difficult or when
collectivist norms were evident. While wellbeing measures
continue to be expanded to account for non-Western concep-
tualizations (i.e., Lambert et al., 2020); the inability to gener-
ate significant findings may have been its casualty. Similarly,
Hendriks et al. (2018) suggest that the mere effect of being
observed, known to treatment group participants, may have
led them to respond in socially desirable ways and conform to
the norm (McCambridge et al., 2014). This tendency has been
noted in collective societies where the tall poppy syndrome,
i.e., not wanting to stand out by making one’s self or life
appear better than those of others (Diener & Biswas-Diener,
2019; Lalwani et al., 2006), may have led to more conserva-
tive reports of life satisfaction.

Finally, the absence of impact may well reflect just that.
While the majority of published studies show PPI efficacy, the
science is still building around questions of specificity; that is,
for whom for such interventions work best and least, as well as
reasons why. A greater number of studies conducted in non-
Western countries as well as those showing a lack of efficacy
can be useful in addressing these questions. The positivity bias
can be a limiting factor in understanding the granular nature of
such interventions; such exceptions may signal important in-
formation that would benefit the field as a whole (Hicks et al.,
2015; van Assen et al., 2014).

At last and central to our inquiry, we found insufficient
evidence of effect on collectivism or individualism levels.
Decrease in vertical individualism and increase in horizontal
individualism have been shown to be conducive to wellbeing
(e.g., Rao et al., 2010; Welbourne et al., 2015). Yet, changes
in individualism may suggest influence of PPIs on partici-
pants’ cultural values themselves, which may be perceived
as undesirable. Our study found no such changes. This finding
pertaining to these specific cultural dimensions, and the lack
of effect on life satisfaction, may be due to a smaller sample
undergoing an intervention over a short period of time. Based
on power analysis, to detect a small-medium effect size
(f = .15), 120 participants are needed, which is the total sample
size of our study, but some conditions fell short of 60 partic-
ipants. We recommend that future studies incorporate a min-
imum of 60 participants per group to detect such effects.

In sum, it appears that at least in short interventions, PPIs
increase positive emotions, but we found insufficient evidence

about whether they impacted the cultural dimensions of col-
lectivism and individualism. However, this research is worthy
of future investigation because if additional research finds that
PPIs do not shift cultural values, it may be a tool that univer-
sities worldwide can deploy to counter negative emotional
states over longer timeframes.

Future Directions and Limitations

One of the strengths of this study is that it was not limited to a
one-time intervention but spread across six weeks with a
follow-up three months post-treatment in relation to a control
group. Still, our study could have benefitted from a longer
analysis as tracking longitudinal changes relative to more fre-
quent PPI use may have showed changes to somatization and
stress, but most importantly to culture, particularly as it in-
volves a set of deeply engrained, internalized set of beliefs
and values, which may be resistant to short-term changes in
behavior (Akkus et al., 2017; Steele & Lynch, 2013; Steel
et al., 2018). Another strength was the timing of the interven-
tion program. In semester long programs, participants often
record poorer outcomes at the conclusion due to final exams
and class assignments, with interventions serving to “stop the
drop” (Mangan et al., 2020). In prior studies (i.e., Lambert,
Passmore, & Joshanloo, 2019), the first author observed that
students tended to report being highly optimistic at the start of
term, only for their mood to drop once classes began, while in
other cases, they may have felt the need to save face and
project an image of perfection and happiness, common in
collective cultures where one’s social reputation is primary
(Han, 2016), and where impression management tends to oc-
cur more frequently in surveys (Riemer & Shavitt, 2011).
Although our data was collected away from these high and
low temporal points, it is unclear what extraneous variables
like term dates have on this or other studies.

Another limitation includes the preponderance of female
participants. The university has fewer male students and their
small numbers may have influenced our findings; indeed,
studies show that females tend to score more highly in hori-
zonal collectivism and lower in vertical individualism
(Kurman & Sriram, 2002; Lalwani & Shavitt, 2013; Nelson
& Shavitt, 2002). A further limitation is that the lack of ran-
dom assignment to conditions prevents firm causal conclu-
sions; future research should conduct a randomized control
trial. We also took an exploratory approach by examining
treatment effects across a wide range of outcomes, without
controlling the Type 1 error rate. Future research is needed
to confirm that PPIs reliably boost positive emotions and emo-
tional balance, and that our findings are not a statistical arti-
fact. Finally, we did not track program compliance; thus, do
not know if program benefits covary with dosage. Future re-
search should explore this possibility.

Curr Psychol (2023) 42:7475–7488

While there remains work to do in discovering how PPIs
impact non-Western participants, including on other cultural
dimensions, such as power distance, masculinity, and uncer-
tainty avoidance, ours considered this very question. While
we did not find significant effects for many of the outcomes,
the findings that are only intermittently statistically significant
are still useful in helping establish the boundary conditions for
PPIs across cultures. This work can aid in documenting which
outcomes are likely affected by PPIs in the UAE, but also
serve to build a repository of information used to facilitate
the personalization of PPI treatment, a growing trend (Perna
et al., 2018) where the empirical grouping of PPIs can allow
predictions to be made in terms of which have the most value
to consumers (Layous & Lyubomirsky, 2014). Necessarily
knowing for whom they are not effective helps to build such
specificity (Baños et al., 2016).

Further, in no case did the treatment group show worse
change over time than the control group, suggesting that
PPIs are acceptable within the UAE context. Regardless, it is
unknown if the lack of effect is due to the length of the inter-
vention or sample size; still, preliminary results suggest that
PPIs can reliably boost positive emotions whilst preserving
culture. While many universities teach remedial skills to cope
with stress, depression and anxiety, few take a positive ap-
proach to building wellbeing (Lambert, Abdulrehman et al.,
2019; White, 2016). Promoted in positive education (Green
et al., 2011), an offshoot of positive psychology, the imple-
mentation of such programs through student affairs, counsel-
ling services, or as curricula is a growing trend setting students
on a path to present and future success.

Conclusion

Offering PPIs in a university setting may be a route to
strengthening wellbeing and countering the underutilization
of mental health services, particularly in the region (Heath
et al., 2016; Sewilam et al., 2015). They may also provide
universities with the tools to boost wellbeing that are non-
stigmatizing and inexpensive, as well as treatment and preven-
tion focused. These could remedy high levels of depression,
anxiety and stress frequently reported by students (Al
Ghailani et al., 2018; January et al., 2018; Syed et al., 2018).
As students return to campus post COVID-19, institutions
may consider offering wellbeing skills to smooth this transi-
tion and promote wellbeing. Such interventions can also help
students gain the long-term benefits of wellbeing, such that
relationship, health, employment and performance benefits
can be realized. Most importantly, as our findings suggest,
these interventions can be used outside the cultural contexts
for which they were designed and allay fears of undermining
wellbeing, while paradoxically trying to build it.
