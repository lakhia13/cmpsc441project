Abstract 
Background:  Skills training is believed to be essential in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and is also offered as 
a standalone intervention. There is a need to better understand each skills module’s separate contribution to treat‑
ment outcomes. Several assessment instruments are available, but none of them provides specific information about 
patients’ perceived ability to use skills promoting distress tolerance. The aim of the present study was to develop and 
evaluate the psychometric properties of a Swedish adaptation of the General Self‑Efficacy scale (GSE) for skills use in 
distress tolerance – the Self‑Efficacy in Distress Tolerance scale (SE‑DT).

 407) 
Methods:  Cross‑sectional and longitudinal data were gathered in a non‑clinical (NC) community sample (n 
and a clinical psychiatric (CP) sample (n 
 46). Participants in the NC sample were asked to complete a set of 19 self‑
report instruments, including the SE‑DT, and 45 participants repeated the assessment after 2 weeks. The patients in 
the CP sample filled out a subset of eight instruments; twenty patients repeated the assessment after completing a 
treatment intervention including mindfulness skills and distress tolerance skills or emotion regulation skills.

Results:  The analyses showed that the SE‑DT is unidimensional with high internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
alpha 
divergent validity, demonstrating positive correlations with general self‑efficacy and self‑compassion, and nega‑
tive correlations with difficulties in emotion regulation, psychiatric symptoms, and borderline symptoms. The SE‑DT 
showed sensitivity to change, when pre‑ and post‑treatment assessments were compared (Cohen’s d 

 .74). The SE‑DT also showed good convergent and

Discussion:  This is preliminary evidence that the SE‑DT has adequate to good psychometric properties, supporting 
the use of a total sum score. The results indicate that the SE‑DT can adequately measure the construct of self‑efficacy 
with regard to dealing with distress and emotional crises. The instrument enables continued investigation of stan‑
dalone skills training and the specific contribution of distress tolerance skills to treatment outcomes in DBT. Further 
studies are needed to investigate whether these results are valid in other populations. In addition, the field would 
benefit from a common definition of distress tolerance.

Introduction
Difficulties  in  emotion  regulation  are  considered  a  core 
feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD), trigger-
ing dysfunctional behaviors such as suicide attempts and 
self-harm  [26,  32].  Dialectical  behavior  therapy  (DBT) 
is  a  comprehensive  treatment  that  targets  these  behav-
iors,  helping  BPD  patients  increase  behavioral  control 
and build a life worth living [32]. In addition to receiving

individual  therapy  and  telephone  coaching,  patients 
participate  in  a  skills  training  group  where  they  learn  a 
wide range of skills grouped into four modules: emotion 
regulation,  mindfulness,  interpersonal  effectiveness,  and 
distress  tolerance  (DT)  [31].  In  recent  years,  the  use  of 
skills has been suggested as a key mechanism of change 
in DBT; for example, more frequent use of skills is asso-
ciated  with  less  frequent  self-harm  and  dropout  [6,  38, 
51].  For  some  BPD  patients,  a  standalone  skills  training 
group may be an effective intervention [37]. This may be 
the case in particular if higher risk patients are excluded 
[35]. Further, it has been reported that a standalone skills 
training group can be implemented across several differ-
ent clinical settings and populations [54]. In some cases, 
individual  online  skills  training  may  be  a  convenient 
treatment  format  in  preparation  and  while  waiting  for 
standard DBT (i.e., DBT programs that include all treat-
ment modes) (Vasiljevic S, Isaksson M, Wolf-Arehult M, 
Oster C, Ramklint M, Isaksson J. Brief internet-delivered 
skills  training  based  on  DBT  for  adults  with  borderline 
personality  disorder  –  a  qualitative  study.  Submitted). 
However,  additional  research  on  standalone  skills  train-
ing  is  needed,  with  improved  research  methodology; 
for  example,  it  is  important  to  improve  the  assessment 
of  skills  [54].  Valid  and  reliable  assessment  instruments 
are  also  a  prerequisite  for  investigating  if  and  how  dif-
ferent  skills  modules  are  associated  with  treatment  out-
come  and  dropout  in  standard  DBT.  Although  DBT  is 
clearly  effective  as  a  treatment  for  BPD,  only  about  40% 
of  patients  are  clinically  recovered  on  general  measures 
of psychopathology [9] and dropout rates are about 20% 
[33]. Thus, there is a need to improve the treatment.

Currently,  there  are  several  well-known  and  evaluated 
instruments  available  for  the  assessment  of  DBT  skills. 
Linehan and colleagues developed the Dialectical Behav-
ior  Therapy  Ways  of  Coping  Checklist  (DBT-WCCL), 
assessing coping via  DBT skills, as well as  dysfunctional 
behaviors  [39].  However,  this  instrument  involves  only 
general assessment of skills use and is not able to differen-
tiate  between  skills  from  different  modules.  In  addition, 
emotion  regulation  skills  have  often  been  assessed  with 
the  Difficulties  in  Emotion  Regulation  Scale  (DERS  [8, 
19];), interpersonal skills with the Inventory of Interper-
sonal Problems (IIP [30];), and DT skills with the Distress 
Tolerance  Scale  (DTS  [50];).  However,  these  question-
naires assess self-perceived problems, rather than the use 
of  effective  DBT  skills.  The  following  items  can  exem-
plify  this:  “When  I’m  upset,  I  have  difficulty  focusing 
on  other  things”  (DERS)  and  “My  feelings  of  distress  or 
being  upset  scare  me”  (DTS).  In  contrast,  mindfulness 
skills  have  been  assessed  with  instruments  such  as  the 
Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS [2, 44];), 
demonstrating a more direct way of investigating the use 

of  mindfulness  skills:  “When  I’m  doing  something,  I’m 
only  focused  on  what  I’m  doing,  nothing  else”  (KIMS). 
Thus,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  additional  instruments 
focusing on the assessment of skills use related to differ-
ent skills.

The skills from the DT module may be the most diffi-
cult to assess, since there is no conclusive consensus on 
how to conceptualize or assess DT [28]. It has been sug-
gested  that  DT  represents  an  individual’s  ability  to  han-
dle uncomfortable emotion states and sensations [53]. In 
DBT,  DT  is  defined  in  a  more  precise  way  as  the  ability 
to  accept  (tolerate)  distress  when  it  is  unavoidable  and 
to handle emotional crises in an effective way [31]. BPD 
pathology  has  been  reported  to  be  associated  with  low 
DT and difficulties in emotion regulation [21]. However, 
it has also been reported that BPD patients who exhibit 
high DT are at greater risk of engaging in serious suicidal 
behaviors,  i.e.,  in  some  cases  it  is  possible  that  a  strong 
ability to tolerate distress enables the patient to perform 
otherwise unsustainable behaviors [1]. In other words, it 
seems that DT can sometimes be functional, and at other 
times dysfunctional. In particular, DT strategies become 
dysfunctional when they are performed instead of effec-
tive  emotion  regulation  and  problem  solving  (the  fail-
ure  to  use  emotion  regulation  and  problem  solving  may 
very well be the main cause of distress in the first place). 
Interestingly,  it  has  been  suggested  that  DT  lies  at  the 
intersection  of  emotion  and  self-control,  and  that  lower 
willpower self-efficacy predicts subsequent distress intol-
erance [56]. It has also been suggested that DT is a trait-
like construct, not likely to change over time [24].

A  problem  when  assessing  DBT  skills  is  that  patients 
are not familiar with these skills prior to treatment; ask-
ing  patients  about  something  they  do  not  yet  under-
stand  can  make  pre-treatment  assessments  difficult. 
In  addition,  it  is  difficult  to  compare  patients  receiving 
treatment-as-usual  with  patients  receiving  DBT  if  we 
investigate  something  that  patients  learn  about  in  DBT 
(e.g., DBT skills). Therefore, researchers have underlined 
the importance of not using DBT-specific terminology in 
assessment instruments [6, 38]. Another solution to this 
problem  is  to  ask  patients  indirectly  about  their  ability 
to use skills, that is, to assess their perceived self-efficacy 
(SE).

SE refers to an individual’s belief in their ability to per-
form a specific behavior when confronted with a certain 
problem, and rests on the premise that an individual only 
engages in a behavior if they believe in their own ability 
to  perform  the  behavior  and  in  the  possibility  that  the 
behavior  leads  to  a  desired  goal  [3].  During  psychother-
apy, SE may determine what challenges the patient takes 
on  and  how  much  they  strive  to  achieve  a  goal  [5].  In 
general,  SE  has  been  associated  with  positive  affect  and 

Alfonsson et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2022) 9:23

high life satisfaction [27, 34], and has been described as 
having  a  predictive  role  in  health-promoting  behaviors 
[49]. According to Bandura [3], SE differs between differ-
ent areas of life, i.e., one and the same person can report 
a  high  level  of  SE  in  one  area,  but  a  low  level  of  SE  in 
another.  Unsurprisingly,  high  SE  in  one  area  is  believed 
to  be  generalizable  to  similar  areas,  as  specific  underly-
ing skills can be relevant to several areas [3]. It has been 
suggested that SE consists of a general inherent belief in 
one’s  own  ability  that  is  expressed  within  a  broad  spec-
trum of life’s various domains, rather than a belief in one’s 
ability  within  a  defined  area  [55].  However,  a  domain-
specific assessment of SE may be a stronger predictor of 
specific behaviors than an assessment of general SE [36]. 
A  change  in  domain-specific  SE  during  psychotherapy 
might also be easier to detect than changes in general SE. 
Indeed,  our  clinical  experience  shows  that  patients  may 
report different SE levels in different areas. For example, 
a patient may report a high level of SE when it comes to 
supporting other people in distress and suggesting skills 
to use in such situations, while reporting major difficul-
ties  in  applying  the  same  expertise  to  themselves,  i.e., 
reporting  a  low  level  of  SE  regarding  DT  skills  in  their 
own  life.  Patients  may  also  report  a  high  level  of  SE  in 
working  life,  even  though  their  private  life  is  character-
ized  by  a  low  level  of  SE,  as  well  as  repeated  self-harm 
and suicidal behaviors.

Since DBT includes skills training in a group format, it 
offers an excellent opportunity to improve SE levels. The 
reason  is  that  SE  is  enhanced  in  group  settings  where 
patients  see  other  patients  master  difficulties  similar  to 
those  they  are  experiencing  themselves  [4].  SE  is  also 
associated  with  positive  psychotherapeutic  outcome  in 
other psychiatric disorders, including substance use [22], 
social  phobia  [18],  and  anxiety  disorders  [13].  Skills  use 
and SE have independently been associated with less fre-
quent self-harm in BPD patients [6].

A  commonly  used  measure  of  general  SE  is  the  Gen-
eral  Self-Efficacy  scale  (GSE  [47];)  which  is  a  10-item 
self-report questionnaire with good to excellent psycho-
metric properties that has been used in many studies and 
countries  [34].  Previous  studies  indicate  that  the  GSE 
is  unidimensional  with  an  average  Cronbach’s  alpha  of 
.86  [45].  Evaluations  of  the  Swedish  version  of  the  GSE 
have shown comparable results [14, 36]. The wording of 
the  GSE  items  is  possible  to  understand  without  having 
attended  DBT  skills  training:  No  matter  what  comes  my 
way, I’m usually able to handle it. The developers of the 
GSE recommend that the scale is adapted to the specific 
area  of  interest  [46].  Importantly,  studies  conducted  in 
several countries have shown that focusing on general SE, 
rather than specific SE, decreases the instrument’s sensi-
tivity [34].

In  summary,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  assessment 
instruments  focusing  on  the  use  of  DBT  skills  from 
different  skills  modules.  This  will  enable  us  to  bet-
ter  understand  each  skills  module’s  separate  contribu-
tion  to  treatment  outcome  and  dropout  in  standalone 
skills  training  and  skills  training  in  standard  DBT.  Sev-
eral  instruments  related  to  specific  skills  modules  or 
the entire skills training are available, but to our knowl-
edge  none  of  them  provides  specific  information  about 
patients’  perceived  ability  to  use  skills  to  deal  with  dis-
tress and emotional crises. Assessment of SE in DT could 
therefore  make  an  important  contribution  to  future 
treatment  studies.  The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to 
develop  and  evaluate  the  psychometric  properties  of  a 
Swedish adaptation of the GSE for skills use in DT – the 
Self-Efficacy  in  Distress  Tolerance  scale  (SE-DT).  We 
hypothesized  that  the  SE-DT  would  show  satisfactory 
to  high  internal  consistency  and  test-retest  reliability, 
and  a  factor  structure  indicating  a  single  scale.  Further, 
we  hypothesized  satisfactory  convergent  and  divergent 
construct  validity  when  the  SE-DT  was  compared  with 
other instruments, such as positive correlations with the 
GSE and self-compassion and negative correlations with 
psychiatric  and  BPD  symptoms.  The  SE-DT  was  also 
hypothesized to show a significantly lower mean value in 
a  clinical  psychiatric  (CP)  sample  than  in  a  non-clinical 
(NC) community sample, and to be sensitive to treatment 
change in a CP sample after participation in a brief skills 
training program.

Methods
Procedure and participants

Data  for  psychometric  analyses  were  collected  in  a  NC 
community  sample,  using  a  set  of  19  online  self-report 
instruments,  and  a  CP  sample,  using  a  subset  of  eight 
self-report  instruments.  Participants  in  the  NC  sample 
were  recruited  via  convenience  sampling  using  a  web-
site  specifically  designed  for  gathering  participants  for 
scientific  research  and  advertisements  on  social  media 
platforms.  Interested  participants  signed  up  for  more 
information  and  then  received  an  e-mail  with  a  link 
to  more  information  about  the  study.  Those  who  chose 
to  participate  were  asked  to  sign  an  informed  consent 
form and fill out the study instruments and background 
variables  online.  Two  weeks  after  the  first  assessment,  a 
subsample  (n = 45)  filled  out  the  questionnaires  a  sec-
ond time, for test-retest analysis. Participants in the NC 
sample were offered remuneration in the form of a movie 
ticket  voucher  for  each  assessment.  All  data  were  col-
lected anonymously. In total, 407 people participated and 
filled out the instruments. The background variables are 
presented in Table 1.

Participants  in  the  CP  sample  were  recruited  at  two 
sites:  a  general  psychiatric  outpatient  clinic,  primar-
ily  treating  patients  with  depression,  anxiety  disorders, 
and  personality  disorders,  and  the  BPD  unit  at  Psychia-
try  Northwest  in  Stockholm,  treating  patients  with  full 
or sub-threshold (fulfilling four diagnostic criteria) BPD. 
During  new  patients’  initial  appointment  with  a  psychi-
atrist  or  a  psychologist,  health  professionals  routinely 
asked  them  to  participate  in  diagnostic  interviews,  as 
well as to fill out a standard battery of self-report instru-
ments.  Diagnosis  was  based  on  the  Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) [48] and the Struc-
tured  Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-IV  Axis  II  Personality 
Disorders,  borderline  criteria  (SCID-II)  [17].  Patients 
were  informed  about  the  study  during  the  diagnostic 
evaluation.

A total of 30 patients at the general psychiatric outpa-
tient  clinic,  of  whom  26  (87%)  were  female  and  4  (13%) 
were male, chose to participate, signed an informed con-
sent  form,  and  completed  the  instruments  in  a  baseline 
assessment.  For  22  of  these  patients,  the  mean  number 
of fulfilled BPD criteria was four; the remaining patients 
had  depression  or  anxiety  disorders.  The  patients  with 
BPD-typical  symptoms  and/or  self-harm  were  offered 

to  participate  in  a  standalone  full-scale  skills  training 
group,  including  24  sessions,  or  a  standalone  brief  skills 
training group, including eight sessions (focusing only on 
mindfulness skills and DT skills), depending on in which 
group started next and the treatment goals of the patient. 
Twenty  patients  agreed  to  start  treatment  and  filled  out 
the  questionnaires  again  in  a  second  assessment  after 
completing the skills group.

Sixteen patients at the BPD unit, thirteen female (81%) 
and  three  male  (19%),  chose  to  participate.  The  mean 
number of fulfilled BPD criteria was four. Seven of these 
patients  participated  in  one  of  three  treatment  options: 
a standalone full-scale skills training group, including 24 
sessions,  a  DBT  program  with  both  skills  training  and 
individual therapy (6–12 months), or emotion regulation 
group  therapy  (ERGT  [43];)  including  16  sessions.  They 
filled  out  the  questionnaires  both  before  and  after  com-
pleting  treatment.  Standalone  skills  training  and  ERGT 
were offered to patients with less severe and subthreshold 
BPD,  whereas  the  DBT  program  was  offered  to  patients 
with more severe problems and self-harm.

In  total,  there  were  46  patients  in  the  CP  sample  and 
27 of them provided data for the sensitivity analysis. The 
patients in the CP sample were between 18 and 54 years 
old, with a mean age of 28.15 years (SD = 7.8).

The self‑efficacy scale for distress tolerance

The  SE-DT  assesses  a  person’s  perceived  SE  in  dealing 
with  distress  and  emotional  crises,  focusing  on  the  use 
of  effective  skills  and  avoiding  dysfunctional  and  impul-
sive behaviors with negative consequences (such as self-
harm)  or  doing  things  one  later  regrets.  The  SE-DT  is 
an adaptation of the GSE [47]. The adaptation was made 
by the fourth and last authors, changing or adding some 
words  in  the  ten  items  to  ensure  that  the  scale  would 
assess  the  specific  domain  in  question  (see  Table  2). 
Like  the  original  scale,  the  SE-DT  consists  of  ten  items 
rated  on  a  4-point  Likert  scale,  ranging  from  1  (“not  at 
all  true”)  to  4  (“exactly  true”).  The  scale  is  hypothesized 
to be unidimensional and generates a sum score, ranging 
from 10 to 40. A higher score indicates a higher level of 
perceived SE.

Instruments

The Borderline Symptom List – short version (BSL-23) is a 
self-report questionnaire targeting experiences and emo-
tions that are typical of BPD patients [10]. In the BSL-23, 
patients  are  asked  to  assess  23  items  with  regard  to  the 
preceding  week  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale,  ranging  from 
0  (“not  at  all”)  to  4  (“very  strong”).  A  total  mean  score 
between  0  and  4  is  used  in  evaluations,  where  a  higher 
score indicates stronger BPD symptoms. A mean score of 
2.05 (SD = 0.90) has been reported among BPD patients

and  the  internal  consistency  for  the  instrument  is  high, 
with a Cronbach’s alpha of .94–.97 [10]. These results are 
comparable to those of the original scale (BSL-95 [11];). 
In  addition,  comparisons  between  pre-  and  post-treat-
ment  assessment  scores  showed  improvements  with  a 
large effect size for the BSL-23 (d = 0.47) after 3 months 
of  inpatient  DBT  [10].  These  psychometric  properties 
have  been  replicated  in  several  studies,  investigating 
different  translations  of  the  BSL-23  [25].  In  the  current 
study, the alpha value of the BSL-23 was .92.

The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is 
a 36-item self-report questionnaire and was developed to 
measure difficulties with emotion regulation. The original 
version of the scale has shown good psychometric prop-
erties [19], as has the shortened 16-item version (DERS-
16 [8];). Patients are asked to assess the items with regard 
to the preceding week on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging 
from 1 (“almost never”) to 5 (“almost all the time”). The 
DERS-16  generates  a  sum  score  that  ranges  from  16  to 
80,  where  a  higher  score  indicates  more  difficulties  in 
emotion  regulation.  The  DERS-16  has  demonstrated 
excellent internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 
.92–.94 [8, 20]. In the current study, the alpha value of the 
DERS-16 was .95.

The  General  Self-Efficacy  scale  (GSE)  was  developed 
as a self-report instrument, using ten items to assess, on 
a 4-point Likert scale, a person’s general belief that they 
can perform a difficult task and cope with adversities in 
life [47]. Thus, the total score of the GSE ranges from 10 

to 40; higher scores indicate a greater sense of general SE. 
The GSE is available in over 30 languages and the original 
Swedish version of the GSE was developed by Koskinen-
Hagman,  Schwarzer,  and  Jerusalem  (http:// userp age. fu- 
berlin. de/ ~health/ selfs cal. htm). Both the original version 
[45]  and  the  Swedish  version  [14,  36]  of  the  GSE  have 
been reported to have good psychometric properties. In 
the current study, the alpha value of the GSE was .92.

The Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) includes 25 
items  and  assesses  both  anxiety  (10  items)  and  depres-
sion  (15  items)  during  the  preceding  week  on  a  4-point 
Likert scale, ranging from 1 (“not at all”) to 4 (“a lot”). The 
scale  generates  a  total  mean  score,  ranging  from  1  to  4, 
with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety and 
depression. It is a short version of the original version of 
the  HSCL  [15]  and  has  shown  adequate  psychometric 
properties [16, 41]. In the current study, the alpha value 
of the HSCL-25 was .95.

The  Self-Compassion  Scale  –  short  form  (SCS-SF) 
includes  12  items,  assessing  a  person’s  ability  to  hold 
their  feelings  of  suffering.  It  encompasses  three  uncom-
passionate  and  three  compassionate  approaches,  such 
as  showing  kindness,  rather  than  being  harsh  on  one-
self,  recognizing  the  shared  human  experience  of  being 
imperfect,  and  focusing  on  one’s  mindful  experience  in 
the  moment  [42].  The  items  are  rated  on  a  5-point  Lik-
ert  scale  ranging  from  1  (“almost  never”)  to  5  (“almost 
always”). The scale generates a total mean score ranging 
from 12 to 60, with higher scores indicating higher levels

of self-compassion. The SCS-SF is a short version of the 
original instrument [40]. In a Swedish sample with older 
adults [12], acceptable internal consistency was reported 
(Cronbach’s  alpha:  .68),  while  the  internal  consistency 
was good in the current study (alpha value = .88).

Analyses

Data were screened for outliers and the data distribution 
for each variable was inspected. No outliers were identi-
fied,  and  all  distributions  were  normal  –  except  that  for 
the  HSCL-25,  which  had  a  positive  skew.  The  HSCL-25 
data  were  therefore  inverse-transformed  (1/x)  before 
analysis, but since this did not affect the results, the origi-
nal data were used in all analyses.

The  factor  structure  of  the  SE-DT  was  investigated 
through  explorative  factor  analysis  using  principal  com-
ponent  analysis  with  promax  rotation  [52].  Associations 
between  variables  were  assessed  with  Spearman’s  rho, 
internal  reliability  with  Cronbach’s  alpha  and  test-retest 
with  intra-class  correlation,  using  a  two-way  mixed 
effects  model  with  absolute  agreement.  Correlation 
matrices  were  calculated  with  polychoric  correlations 
since the data were ordinal-scaled. Using polychoric cor-
relations estimates latent variables more accurately than 
their  ordinal  expressions.  Bartlett’s  test  of  sphericity  [7] 
was  used  to  check  that  the  correlation  matrix  was  not 
random, and a KMO statistic [23] above .50 was required.
Comparisons  between  groups  were  made  with  inde-
pendent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests, depending on 
the data structure and measures of effect were calculated 
with Cohen’s d, pooled to correct for differences in sam-
ple size. A p value < .05 was regarded as the significance 
threshold in all analyses.

Results
Factor structure

The  exploratory  factor  analysis  suggested  a  one-factor 
solution with an eigenvalue of 5.83 that explained 58.28% 
of the variance. All items had factor loadings of between 

.70 and .83 on this single factor. It was the only solution 
with an eigenvalue above 1, so no further factor analyses 
were conducted.

Construct validity

The  mean  score  and  standard  deviation  for  each  instru-
ment are presented in Table 3. The correlations between 
the  SE-DT  and  the  other  instruments  were  significant 
and  in  the  hypothesized  directions  (Table  4),  i.e.,  analy-
ses showed a strong positive correlation with general self-
efficacy  (GSE)  and  a  moderate  positive  correlation  with 
self-compassion (SCS-SF), whereas there were moderate 
negative correlations with difficulties with emotion regu-
lation (DERS-16), psychiatric symptoms (HSCL-25), and 
BPD symptoms (BSL-23).

Reliability

internal  reliability  of 

The 
the  SE-DT  was  high 
(alpha = .92)  with  inter-item  correlations  ranging  from 
.40  to  .67.  All  items  correlated  moderately  (r = .63–.78) 
with  the  scale  total  and  no  deletion  of  items  would 
improve  the  internal  consistency  markedly.  The  test-
retest reliability was ICC = .74.

Difference between the non‑clinical and the clinical 
samples

The  mean  value  of  the  SE-DT 
in  the  CP  sam-
lower 
(M = 16.63,  SD = 4.28)  was  significantly 
ple 
(t(432) = 8.97, p < .001, d = 1.45) than that in the NC sam-
ple (M = 27.11, SD = 5.97). In the CP sample, the DERS-
16 was significantly negatively correlated with the SE-DT 
(rho = −.46,  p =  .02);  the  BSL-23  also  showed  a  nega-
tive  correlation,  but  it  was  not  significant  (rho = −.27, 
p = .15).

Sensitivity to change

Participants  who  completed  a  brief  or  a  full-scale  skills 
training  group  (n = 27)  reported  a  significant  improve-
ment  in  SE  in  regard  to  DT  (t(19) = 4.89,  p = .001, 
d = 0.82),  when  comparing  the  SE-DT  scores  before 
(M = 16.63,  SD = 4.28)  and  after  (M = 22.52,  SD = 5.40) 
treatment.  However,  there  were  no  statistical  improve-
ments  in  scores  for  emotion  regulation  measured  with 
the  DERS-16  (t(19) = 1.23,  p = .24,  d = 0.31)  or  border-
line  symptoms  measured  with  the  BSL-24  (t(19) = 1.37, 
p = .18).

Discussion
The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  evaluate  the  psy-
chometric  properties  of  the  SE-DT,  assessing  a  person’s 
perceived  ability  to  handle  distress  caused  by  emotional 
crises. The SE-DT focuses on the use of effective behav-
iors  (skills),  as  opposed  to  dysfunctional  behaviors  with 
negative consequences (such as self-harm) or which one 
regrets [31]. It is designed to facilitate the investigation of 
DT  skills’  specific  contributions  to  treatment  effect  and 
dropout in, for example, standalone skills training groups 
and  skills  training  in  full-scale  DBT  programs.  Over-
all,  the  SE-DT  showed  adequate  to  good  psychometric 
properties, displaying a single-factor structure with high 
internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and mod-
erate to strong correlations with other psychiatric instru-
ments,  in  the  hypothesized  directions.  The  moderate 
correlations  with  some  psychiatric  instruments  indicate 
that  these  instruments  have  a  moderate  and  expected 
partial  overlap  with  the  SE-DT,  but  that  they  measure 
different  constructs.  The  SE-DT  therefore  displays  an 
adequate divergent validity when comparing instruments 
that assess variables relevant to psychiatric problems. The 
strong  correlation  with  the  GSE  indicates  good  conver-
gent  validity,  while  the  fact  that  the  correlation  was  not 
perfect suggests that the GSE cannot completely replace 
the SE-DT, and that the SE-DT adds important informa-
tion  in  investigation  of  the  specific  SE  in  DT.  Overall, 
these  results  are  in  line  with  previous  investigations  of 
the  original  GSE,  indicating  that  it  is  a  reliable,  homo-
geneous, and unidimensional scale [45]. In addition, the 

SE-DT  could  identify  differences  between  a  NC  com-
munity  sample  and  a  CP  sample  with  BPD  patients  and 
patients  with  borderline  features,  with  lower  scores  on 
the  SE-DT  in  the  CP  sample.  This  result  was  expected, 
since it is known that SE typically shows a negative asso-
ciation  with  psychiatric  problems  such  as  depression, 
anxiety, and self-harm [6, 36]. The SE-DT also showed an 
ability to detect improvements in patients’ belief in their 
ability to tolerate distress after a brief skills training. This 
result  is  in  accordance  with  several  treatment  studies, 
reporting  that  skills  training  can  improve  BPD  patients’ 
ability to perform skillful behaviors [37], and that higher 
levels  of  SE  are  associated  with  less  frequent  self-harm 
[6]. Interestingly, the SE-DT seemed to be more sensitive 
to change than other instruments used to evaluate skills, 
such as the DERS-16 and the SCS-SF. The reason for this 
could  be  that  it  is  more  complicated  or  takes  longer  to 
learn  how  to  regulate  specific  emotions  or  develop  self-
compassion  than  to  deal  with  distress  and  emotional 
crises,  i.e.,  the  SE-DT  might  be  able  to  detect  change  at 
an earlier stage in the treatment process. However, these 
results  must  be  replicated  in  a  treatment  study  where  a 
single  treatment  program  is  evaluated.  In  the  present 
study,  patients  from  different  treatment  interventions, 
targeting the improvement of emotion regulation and/or 
DT  skills,  were  included.  The  results  are  therefore  diffi-
cult to interpret with regard to this question.

As  expected,  the  SE-DT  (measuring  domain-specific 
SE)  showed  the  strongest  association  with  the  GSE 
(measuring general SE). This does not come as a surprise, 
since  the  two  scales  share  similar  item  formulations. 
However,  a  domain-specific  instrument  like  the  SE-DT 
is  believed  to  be  a  stronger  predictor  of  specific  behav-
iors  such  as  effective  DT  skills.  In  addition,  the  aspects 
separating the two instruments might prove to be of par-
ticular importance in treatment studies where a domain-
specific instrument is expected to show higher sensitivity 
to change than an instrument assessing general SE. Inves-
tigating  this  assumption  further  would  require  a  study 
comparing  the  SE-DT  and  the  GSE  in  a  clinical  sample 
during an evaluation of a treatment intervention.

The  positive  association  between  the  SE-DT  and  self-
compassion (SCS-SF) was also in line with expectations, 
since  self-compassion  involves  showing  warmth,  under-
standing,  and  kindness  to  oneself,  in  particular  in  times 
of difficulties and suffering [40], which could strengthen 
the  belief  in  one’s  own  ability  to  handle  difficulties. 
Indeed, self-compassion has been suggested to protect a 
person’s  SE  in  face  of  failures,  and  results  have  shown  a 
positive association between the two variables [29].

The negative association between the SE-DT and diffi-
culties  in  emotion  regulation  measured  with  the  DERS-
16  [8]  was  only  moderate,  even  though  both  DT  and 

 Alfonsson et al. Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation            (2022) 9:23

emotion  regulation  represent  important  skills  in  DBT. 
However, a  person  can deal effectively  with distress and 
emotional  crises,  for  example,  by  distracting  themself, 
without  necessarily  knowing  how  to  regulate  specific 
emotions. When levels of distress are high, it is difficult 
to  be  mindful  of  the  emotion  and  making  a  decision  on 
how to regulate it.

The  SE-DT  was  negatively  associated  with  the  HSCL-
25  (depression  and  anxiety)  and  the  BSL-23  (symptoms 
of  BPD)  in  the  non-clinical  sample. This  was  unsurpris-
ing,  given  that  people  with  psychiatric  problems  would 
be expected to show low ability to handle distress. How-
ever,  it  may  be  surprising  that  the  correlation  between 
the  SE-DT  and  the  BSL-23  was  not  significant  in  the 
clinical  sample.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  clinical  sam-
ple was small and the analysis may have lacked statistical 
power  to  detect  weak  correlations.  Another  explanation 
could be that the association is non-linear and therefore 
levels  out  when  one  has  reached  a  certain  level  of  BPD 
symptoms.  Explorative  post-hoc  analyses  of  non-linear 
associations  between  the  variables  were  all  non-signifi-
cant. Again, the small sample size resulted in low statisti-
cal power for these analyses. Further, there may be other 
variables,  such  as  the  ability  to  regulate  emotions  (see 
also  above),  that  are  more  important  in  explaining  why 
some patients remain at high levels of borderline-typical 
problems. This needs to be further investigated in much 
larger samples.

The adaptation of the scale from the GSE to the SE-DT 
was  made  by  two  of  the  authors.  There  was  no  consul-
tation with any outside specialists in this process, which 
might be a limitation worth noting. Also, the self-selected 
community  sample  and  the  small  CP  sample  cause  dif-
ficulties  in  interpreting  and  generalizing  the  results  in 
the  current  study. There  is  always  a  risk  of  bias  in  stud-
ies  with  self-selected  participants  and  it  is  difficult  to 
say  how  this  may  have  affected  the  current  evaluation. 
However,  the  data  distributions  were,  with  some  excep-
tions,  satisfactory  and  there  were  no  signs  of  floor  or 
ceiling  effects.  Most  of  the  variables,  including  emotion 
regulation, are relevant in the normal population and col-
lecting  data  from  NC  community  samples  is  therefore 
adequate. In spite of the small size of the CP sample, the 
results  were  significant  when  comparing  groups,  as  well 
as  pre-  and  post-treatment  assessments.  However,  the 
results of this study should be replicated in larger clinical 
samples.  Research  investigating  both  BPD  patients  and 
patients with other diagnoses reporting self-harm would 
add valuable knowledge to this research field. In addition, 
since  the  CP  sample  consisted  mostly  of  female  partici-
pants,  efforts  should  be  made  to  include  male  patients. 
Nevertheless,  these  limitations  are  less  problematic  in  a 
psychometric  evaluation  than  for  example  in  evaluation 

of treatment efficacy. Lastly, the research field would ben-
efit  from  a  common  definition  of  DT  and  an  analysis  of 
the  advantages  of  using  domain-specific  SE  instruments 
(compared with general SE instruments) when investigat-
ing changes in treatment studies.

Conclusion
The  present  study  provides  preliminary  evidence  for 
the  usefulness  of  a  scale  assessing  self-efficacy  in  dis-
tress  tolerance,  showing  it  to  be  a  valid  and  reliable 
instrument and indicating that the total score should be 
recommended for use. Future research should focus on 
evaluating  the  scale  in  a  larger  clinical  sample,  includ-
ing  male  patients  and  patients  with  different  diagno-
ses, preferably investigating the scale’s ability to detect 
change.  In  particular,  the  aim  should  be  to  investigate 
distress tolerance skills’ specific contributions to treat-
ment outcome and dropout in standalone skills training 
and skills training in dialectical behavior therapy.
