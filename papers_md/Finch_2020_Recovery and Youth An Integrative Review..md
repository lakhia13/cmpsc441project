RECOVERY  AND YOUTH: 
AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW

Although rates of alcohol and other substance use disorders in adolescents have been  
estimated for decades, little is known about the prevalence, pathways, and predictors of  
remission and long-term recovery among adolescents. This article provides an integrative 
review of the literature on youth recovery. A final selection of 39 relevant articles was grouped  
into five sections: treatment outcomes, special emphasis populations, recovery-oriented  
systems of care, families, and non–abstinence-based approaches. The review recommends  
more adolescent research in three basic areas: more research about medication-assisted 
treatment and recovery as well as harm reduction approaches for adolescents; expansion 
of research on recovery practices for youth who do not receive treatment due to personal 
choice or societal disparities; and more life course research, which may begin with adolescent  
participants and extend across the life span. Additionally, the authors suggest the recovery 
capital model for adolescents and the neuroscience of addiction may provide additional  
precision and direction for the study of youth recovery.

INTRODUCTION 

Recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD) or 
other substance use disorder (SUD) is an evolving 
concept. This article reviews youth recovery, as 
little is known about the prevalence, pathways, and 
predictors of remission and long-term recovery 
among adolescents and how these may contrast 
with recovery in emerging and older adults. 
Although much of the literature on alcohol or other 
substance use in youth has focused on prevention, 
adolescents can and do develop AUD or other 
SUD. Data reported by the annual National Survey 

on Drug Use and Health showed nearly 1 million 
youths (ages 12 to 17) needed treatment for AUD 
or SUD in 2018, although only 83,000 of them 
received services in a treatment center.1 

Historian William White has suggested that the 

recovery movement began in the late 1990s with 
an extraordinary cultural and political mobilization 
supported by the Recovery Community Services 
Program of the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) 
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment.2 White

identified  the  2001  Recovery  Summit  in  St.  Paul,  
Minnesota, which launched Faces and Voices of  
Recovery, as a milestone in the recovery advocacy  
movement. The recovery movement impacted  
research literature as well. Kaskutas, Witbrodt,  
and Grella conducted a Google Scholar search  
dating  to  1959  and  found  a  significant  increase  
from 2001 to 2012 in the number of articles about  
alcohol or other substance use with “recovery” in  
the  title.  The  American  Psychiatric  Association  
then  released  the  fifth  edition  of  its  Diagnostic  
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  
(DSM-5) in 2013, which revised the diagnostics  
for SUD, creating a range of symptoms from  
mild to moderate to severe. This revision helped  
shift the perception of SUD as existing along a  
continuum of severity rather than as a distinct  
positive or negative diagnosis, which was intended  
to impact how practitioners treated SUD and how  
researchers studied it. 

In the midst of the burgeoning recovery 
advocacy movement, SAMHSA’s Center for 
Substance Abuse Treatment convened the first 
National Summit on Addiction Recovery in 
2005 to create one of the first definitions of 
recovery: “Recovery from alcohol and drug 
problems is a process of change through which 
an individual achieves abstinence and improved 
health, wellness, and quality of life.”4 In 2011, 
SAMHSA broadened this definition even more by 
removing the mention of abstinence as a criterion 
for recovery: “a process of self-directed change 
through which individuals improve their health 
and wellness, live self-directed lives, and strive 
to reach their full potential.” These were only two 
of nearly a dozen definitions to come. According 
to Ashford and colleagues, at least 10 relevant 
definitions of recovery emerged between 2005 
and 2017, from which their own Recovery Science 
Research Collaborative (RSRC) highlighted three 
as the “leading definitions of recovery”: SAMHSA 
in 2011, the American Society of Addiction 
Medicine in 2013, and the Betty Ford Institute 
Consensus Panel in 2007.5(p180)  Guided by these 
statements, the RSRC crafted its own definition: 
“Recovery is an intentional, dynamic, and 

relational process that involves sustained efforts to 
improve multiple aspects of wellness, and which 
may vary by individual, social, and experiential 
contexts.”5(p183)  In an effort to be more holistic and 
inclusive, similar to SAMHSA’s 2011 description, 
the RSRC made no mention of reducing or 
abstaining from alcohol or substance use. 
Along the same lines, none of the major  
efforts  to  conceptualize  recovery  have  specified  
age or developmental concerns, which creates  
the impression that either the definitions were  
intended for adults, or the drafters considered  
adolescent recovery to be indistinguishable from  
adult recovery. In most instances, youth recovery  
simply has not been addressed in the definitional  
literature. Over the last decade, however, addiction  
neuroscience has shown that alcohol or other  
substance use during adolescence has a substantial  
impact on brain development. According to the  
National Institute on Drug Abuse: “The fact that  
this critical part of a teen’s brain [the prefrontal  
cortex] is still a work in progress puts them at  
increased risk for trying drugs or continuing to  
take them. Introducing drugs during this period of  
development may cause brain changes that have  
profound and long-lasting consequences.” (p10)  
In addition, youths under age 18 cannot legally  
drink alcohol without parental supervision or use  
cannabis in states where recreational use is allowed,  
must be enrolled in school, and are considered  
minors and thus legally dependent on parents  
or guardians. For youths in recovery, therefore,  
the developmental, legal, and familial context  
fundamentally differs in ways that render adult-
based  conceptualizations  of  recovery  insufficient. 
Adolescent treatment and recovery support 
programs expanded at the same time as definitions 
of recovery were being adopted, and the youth data 
from both the annual National Survey on Drug 
Use and Health and the Monitoring the Future 
studies have shown precipitous drops in virtually 
every indicator of alcohol or other substance-
related disorder—including youth meeting the 
criteria for SUD, youth needing treatment, and 
youth receiving treatment. The number of youths 
ages 12 to 17 who needed treatment—a key

indicator of potential referrals—was nearly 2.3 
million in 2002, but by 2018, the number had 
fallen to 946,000.1 

The reason for the decline in adolescents with  

SUD is uncertain, but the recovery movement  
no doubt played a role by spurring programs  
that reduced recidivism and provided tertiary  
prevention. AUD and SUD, though, have persisted,  
as have the treatment and recovery support gaps.  
Despite the efforts to define and potentially quantify  
the  recovery  process,  the  specific  phenomenology  
of youth recovery has remained diffuse. Although  
substantial literature on adolescent AUD and  
SUD and treatment outcomes has arisen over the  
last 20 years, this review of the youth recovery  
literature has been complicated by inconsistent  
conceptions of the ages bounding “youth”; the  
definition, genesis, and life course of adolescent  
recovery; and the outcomes that are deemed  
successful. There exists a tapestry from which to  
divine an understanding of adolescent recovery, but  
a coherent typology has been elusive. This article  
thus uses other topics in the Recovery From AUD  
featured topic series as an organizational guide.  
As most of the issue’s subtopics are not exclusively  
youth-focused, this article brings adolescence to  
the forefront, discussing (1) t  reatment outcomes,  
(2)  special emphasis populations, (3) r  ecovery-
oriented systems of care, (4) f  amilies, and (5)  non– 
abstinence-based approaches. This article concludes  
with a call for a clearer and more focused definition  
of recovery from AUD and SUD for adolescents, as  
well as more prospective and longitudinal research  
on sustained recovery and its impact on individual  
young people and society. 

METHODS 

This article provides a thorough and current 
review of the literature supported by 
representative references, utilizing an integrative 
review approach.7 The methodology reflects the 
topic series’ guidelines to review AUD among 
youth with a focus on recovery and within a limit 
of 50 references. Having three authors minimized 
potential bias, and each person conducted an 

independent review of articles. Multiple meetings 
were held discussing search criteria, findings, and 
selection. The process was emergent, iterative, 
and reflexive, and it considered prior reviews 
looking at similar issues. The authors ultimately 
decided the best organizing frame was from the 
topic series itself. Other frames emerged and were 
considered, but the topics from the journal itself 
ultimately worked best for consistency and clarity. 

Problem Identification 
This review was initially conceived as an 
exploration of the prevalence, pathways, and 
predictors of remission and long-term recovery 
among not only adolescents, but also emerging 
adults, commonly understood as the population 
ages 18 to 25. It also was intended to address 
not only recovery support services but also 
early interventions. After multiple conceptual 
discussions and after receiving consent from the 
editors, the authors agreed to focus on youths 
ages 12 to 18, the life phase usually referred to as 
adolescence. The literature and prevalence data 
on emerging adults (ages 18 to 25) are robust and 
worthy of their own review, but including that 
age group in this review could have drowned 
out the focus on adolescents. Although the life 
phase of transitional-age youth (ages 16 to 24) 
includes minors and youths transitioning from 
state custody and foster care, including that entire 
group also necessarily adds emerging adults, thus 
creating similar issues. As the adolescent age 
group is fundamentally different from emerging 
adults in a number of ways, including legal 
status, brain development, recovery capital, and 
family involvement, the authors felt a study of the 
trends and gaps in the literature on adolescents 
was needed. The scope also was narrowed 
to focus on the recovery process rather than 
the early intervention and treatment outcome 
literature  highlighting  specific  treatments  (such  as  
multidimensional  family  therapy  or  motivational  
interviewing). This allowed the review to approach 
recovery as part of the treatment process as well as 
distinct from it. As treatment was not the focus of 
this review, the only treatment articles considered 

3 

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020 
 
 
 
for this review incorporate investigations into 
specific factors that influence the recovery process. 
Treatment studies exploring treatment outcomes 
and/or effectiveness per se were considered 
beyond the scope of this review. 

Literature Search 
Articles were included if they explored 
problematic alcohol and drug use or AUD and 
recovery among adolescents. As the adolescent life 
phase is understood differently in the literature— 
sometimes containing 18-year-olds and sometimes 
not—this review included articles focused on 
people age 18 and younger. Articles were included 
if they explicitly mentioned recovery or expanded 
on facets of the recovery process, such as personal 
or environmental characteristics that support 
recovery, broadly defined. Such topics included 
abstinence, sobriety, mutual aid, relapse, and 
alternative peer groups. Studies were excluded that 
focused solely on treatment outcomes, screening, 

or prevention. The year of publication was not 
considered when determining eligibility. 
A systematic search was conducted in 

November 2019 of published studies in PsycINFO 
and PubMed (see Figure 1). These databases 
represent curated repositories of health, social 
science, and medical/clinical literature. Databases 
were searched for major themes of alcohol and 
recovery among adolescents. Based upon journal 
guidelines, articles must have explicitly included 
alcohol use in order to be considered for the study. 
Due to the conceptual ambiguity of recovery, 
additional terms commonly used in the field over 
the past few decades were included: relapse, 
remission, self-help, sobriety, and abstinence. 
Targeted searches also incorporated the key words 
“alternative peer group” and “recovery high 
school.” After the removal of duplicates, the search 
resulted in 2,490 unique articles (specific search 
strings available upon request).

Data Evaluation 
Two authors independently reviewed half of the  
articles’ titles and abstracts, and the lead author  
randomly  reviewed  articles  for  fidelity.  In  the  initial  
screening, the full text of any ambiguous article  
was reviewed by multiple authors until a consensus  
was reached. After screening, 102 articles were  
identified  as  relating  to  youth  recovery. 

Data Analysis 
Authors independently reviewed the 102 articles 
identified to create broad categories based on 
the variables and/or context studied (e.g., mutual 
aid, adolescent peer group, relapse). Due to the 
complexity and breadth of the literature, authors 
independently reviewed and coded articles for 
key themes and identified one to two main foci. 
The authors then met and refined the list of key 
themes. With a unified list of foci, authors again 
reviewed and coded articles. More than 20 major 
topics and 53 subtopics were identified. Because of 
the limited space and the range of topics, authors 
chose to organize the major topics to mirror 
those covered in the topic series. The 23 primary 
categories were thus grouped into five sections 
for review: treatment outcomes, special emphasis 
populations, recovery-oriented systems of care, 
families, and non–abstinence-based approaches. 
The description and rationale for each of those 
sections is discussed earlier. 

After reaching an agreement on the conceptual 

framework, two authors independently identified 
which of the 102 articles to include in the literature 
review. This process included assessing articles on 
individual characteristics as well as considering 
the breadth of articles reviewed. Individual 
study characteristics included sample size for 
quantitative studies, credibility enhancements 
such as triangulation in qualitative work, 
publication year, recovery focus, and implications 
of findings. Macro-level considerations included 
representing a range of authors, study designs, 
distribution across topic areas, and conceptual 
frames. Upon completion, those two authors met 
to reach a consensus, and the lead author then 
independently assayed the articles to approve of 

the  final  selection  of  39  for  inclusion,  a  number  
within the journal’s preferred limit of 50 total 
citations  (Table  1). 

RECOVERY AS A 
TREATMENT OUTCOME 
Until relatively recently, adolescent recovery from  
AUD or other SUD has been researched mostly  
as part of a linear model of addiction treatment.  
Recovery was understood to be abstinence-based,  
and adolescent recovery usually was assumed  
to include some form of treatment. Indeed, most  
researchers have viewed adolescent recovery as  
the result of successful treatment rather than a  
distinct phenomenon. If recovery programs were  
studied at all, they were seen as aftercare, or  
continuing care, to sustain the gains of treatment.  
Articles examining treatment outcomes and  
relapse thus account for the majority of the articles  
about recovery and youth. Treatment outcomes  
(e.g., abstinence, symptom reduction) were  
identified traditionally as the dependent variable,  
as opposed to the growing body of research  
studying recovery itself as the dependent variable.  
Instead of viewing recovery as its own construct,  
the following articles represent those studies   
that evaluated treatment outcomes as a proxy   
for  recovery. 

Treatment outcome articles cover myriad 

modalities, including both specialty (i.e., treatment 
centers, hospitals) and non–specialty treatment 
(i.e., doctor’s offices, emergency rooms, support 
groups). Within the context of recovery from a 
treatment lens, longitudinal treatment outcome 
studies provide insight into adolescents’ behavior 
post-treatment and the variables that impact 
abstinence or relapse. For the purpose of this 
review, articles researching treatment modalities 
were included if they focused on treatment 
in a recovery context. This means the study 
emphasized how the recovery process supported 
treatment instead of whether a singular treatment 
modality was effective, with the locus being the 
aspects of recovery rather than the components 
of treatment.

There is much research evaluating potential 
mediators and moderators of treatment outcomes, 
such as social skills and cognitive abilities. 
Brown and colleagues, for example, studied 
adolescents’ behavior for 4 years post-treatment, 
and their findings elucidate variables impacted 
by the developmental transition from adolescence 
into young adulthood, which may uniquely 
impact treatment outcomes.8  Other literature 
explored internal factors, such as coping skills, 
developmental and neurocognitive considerations, 
and psychosocial factors.9-11 

Due to the social and environmental pressures  
faced by adolescents, the development of positive  
psychosocial skills can be an essential element  
in treatment, as such skills have been associated  
with  avoiding  relapse.9,11  From a developmental  
perspective, coping skills and neurocognitive  
abilities were found to distinctively impact  
adolescents’  relapse.12  These  factors  were  more  
salient for adolescents with lower intellectual  
abilities, whereas other factors may be more  
salient for those with average or above-average  
intellectual  abilities.12  According  to  Latimer  
and colleagues, an adolescent with at least one  
protective factor (e.g., social connectedness, goal  
directedness, peer abstinence), who completed  
long-term treatment followed by continuing care,  
was more likely to achieve successful outcomes  
compared to those with fewer protective factors.11 
External factors, such as one’s environment 
or social influences, can also impact treatment 
outcomes. Peer affiliation and influence have 
been shown to play critical developmental roles 
in adolescents’ post-treatment behaviors. When 
adolescents return to their previously held social 
groups and support systems following treatment, 
they can be faced with contradicting desires 
to abstain from alcohol and other substance 
use while simultaneously maintaining their 
relationships with substance-using peers.13 
Among adolescents who relapsed post-treatment, 
Cornelius and colleagues found social pressure, 
withdrawal, and negative affect to be the most 
common factors.14 

Continuing care has been highlighted in 
the literature as supporting treatment gains 
and preventing relapse. Kaminer and Godley 
suggested that, because adolescents were less 
likely than adults to remain abstinent after 
one treatment episode, evaluating continuing 
care was essential.15  Cavaiola and colleagues 
highlighted the importance of continuing care 
as part of the recovery process in an early 
article published 30 years ago.16  While still 
emphasizing abstinence and relapse prevention, 
Cavaiola et al. evaluated an array of factors 
impacting post-treatment continuing care among 
adolescents to provide a more holistic view of 
recovery, including integration into mutual aid, 
relapse prevention and relapse management, 
relationships, resistance and denial, grief and 
loss issues, self-esteem issues, family treatment 
issues, and dual diagnosis.16 

The complex nature of recovery has led to 
divergence in how researchers have approached 
relapse and abstinence for youth. It is critical to 
note the discrepancies in definitions of “relapse” 
and the subsequent impact on the evaluation 
of treatment outcomes and recovery for young 
people.17  Relapse and relapse prevention are 
multifaceted phenomena closely associated 
with treatment outcomes; yet, the field has been 
moving away from seeing recovery as requiring 
abstinence. Chung and associates, for example, 
implemented a trajectory analysis to demonstrate 
how a return to use does not necessarily indicate 
an adolescent is not in recovery or reducing their 
problematic behavior.18  As of late, the nascent 
body of literature dedicated to harm reduction 
has highlighted the differences between 
abstinence, reducing use, and using less harmful 
substances as the dependent variables in research 
studies. Although there have been few studies 
of harm reduction for youths, Kaminer and 
colleagues found that the relationship between 
abstinence as a post-treatment goal and long-
term success is stronger than if the goal is harm 
reduction.19  A substantial number of studies have 
been designed through a treatment outcome lens,

which defaults to “recovery” if an adolescent is 
abstinent. In essence, for youth, recovery has 
been studied more as an emergent latent variable 
than as its own designated entity. 

SPECIAL EMPHASIS 
POPULATIONS 
Differences in relapse and relapse prevention 
among subpopulations of adolescents form 
a subset of the literature viewing adolescent 
recovery through a treatment outcome lens. The 
recovery process post-treatment had a different 
trajectory based upon various factors, such as the 
intersectionality of an adolescent’s recovery and 
cultural identity, including gender, race, and/or 
ethnicity. Populations highlighted here include 
students and adolescents with co-occurring 
disorders or traumatic experiences. 

Although evaluating co-occurring 

disorders in adolescence can be problematic 
due to diagnostic criteria that often exclude 
people under age 18, there is a small body of 
literature that studies the impact of psychiatric 
comorbidity on relapse and treatment outcomes. 
Psychiatric symptoms have been found to 
influence post-treatment relapse among 
adolescents with AUD or other SUD and a 
co-occurring Axis I diagnosis.20 Sterling and 
colleagues found engagement during treatment 
to be essential for adolescents with co-occurring 
disorders, because abstinence during the first 
year was associated with reduced substance use 
and symptoms of mental health disorders after 
3 years.21  The authors suggested mental health 
symptomology should not be excluded when 
evaluating the treatment outcomes and recovery 
process of adolescents with co-occurring 
disorders, especially given that positive 
mental health outcomes during treatment were 
associated with long-term recovery benefits.21 

Research evaluating the relationship between 
a high incidence of alcohol and other substance 
use for adolescents with trauma histories is 
growing, but the literature is still limited. The 
contribution or impact of lifetime trauma on an 

adolescent’s substance use or on the treatment  
process has been studied, but how trauma  
relates to an adolescent’s recovery has not been  
examined. For example, the relationship between  
social anxiety disorder and lifetime trauma, as  
studied by Pagano and colleagues highlighted  
the  indirect  influence  of  trauma  on  peer  support 
systems and boundary setting in the treatment  
process.22 

Similar to other subpopulations, the prevalence 

of alcohol or other substance-related disorders 
for adolescents based on gender, race, and/or 
ethnic identity has been studied at length. Limited 
literature, however, is available to explain the 
impact of these identities on recovery. Research 
has evaluated post-treatment behaviors that 
have been impacted by an adolescent’s culture. 
For example, although there are differences in 
spirituality and religiosity levels between Black 
and White adolescents receiving treatment for 
AUD or other SUD, the findings suggested that 
religiosity was a predictor of 12-step-related 
behaviors but not of treatment outcomes.23 In the 
same study, a significant gender disparity was 
found in that women were more likely to take the 
actions outlined in the 12 steps.23 

Another unique consideration for this age 
group is the status of student. As most states 
require people under age 18 to be enrolled in 
school, studies have not compared recovery 
processes for student versus nonstudent 
adolescent samples. There is little research, 
though, studying the impact of recovery on young 
people’s academic outcomes. In one such study, 
a neuropsychological test battery evaluating five 
key domains was used as a proxy for academic 
outcomes by evaluating cognitive functioning.24 
During early abstinence from heavy episodic 
drinking, adolescents’ prospective memory, 
cognitive switching, inhibition task accuracy, and 
visuospatial abilities developed significantly.24 
It can be surmised that due to the relatively 

small number of adolescents in recovery, it 
could be prohibitively challenging to study 
sample sizes that result in statistically significant 
findings. Although prevalence of alcohol and

other  substance  use  among  specific  adolescent  
subpopulations, such as LGBTQ+ youth, is well  
documented, there are virtually no articles on  
the impact of various identities on long-term  
recovery for youth or how recovery may impact  
the identities youth hold. Based on the literature, it  
is  clear  that substance misuse among adolescents  
varies among subpopulations. There is, however,  
scant literature detailing the impact of a youth’s  
cultural intersectionality on the youth’s recovery  
process.  

RECOVERY-ORIENTED 
SYSTEMS OF CARE 
Recovery-oriented systems of care (ROSC) 
arose out of the shortcomings of the linear, acute 
care model of addiction treatment. ROSC is 
an umbrella concept that represents the entire 
network of formal and informal relationships and 
organizations that foster individual, familial, and 
community recovery processes over time.2(p497) 
Further explanation and elaboration of ROSC can 
be found elsewhere in this topic series. Although 
empirical evidence is mounting for adults, there 
is scarce literature exploring ROSC for youth. 
The few studies that have investigated adolescent 
systems have considered continuing care, mutual 
aid, peer groups, school programs, and technology. 
A key aspect of ROSC is the continuum of care. 

Continuing care, frequently cited as “aftercare,” 
has been situated as following treatment. Like 
traditional treatment outcome studies, most 
continuing care research has studied maintenance 
of treatment gains. The locus of ROSC, however, 
has been the recovery support systems and 
processes themselves rather than simply indicators 
of treatment success. One long-term outcome study 
followed a treatment group, a waitlist group, and 
a community control group over 5.5 years post-
treatment and found that involvement in continuing 
care among the treatment group was positively 
associated with improved treatment outcomes.25 
As smartphones have taken an ever-more 

pervasive place in adolescent communication, they 
also have begun filling a role in continuing care. 

A recent randomized controlled trial found that 
voluntary recovery support provided via phone 
by other youths had direct and indirect effects.26 
Continuing care was directly associated with 
increased involvement with pro-recovery peers 
and recovery management activities. It also was 
indirectly linked to reductions in alcohol and 
substance use and problems as well as increased 
remission. Incremental dose effects were also 
found—for every 10% increase in support call 
completion, recovery activities increased by 
nearly one activity.26 In similar fashion, Kaminer, 
Burleson, and Burke compared in-person and 
brief phone continuing care with no continuing 
care through a randomized design.27 Findings 
indicated that continuing care in general slowed 
the occurrence of post-treatment alcohol use and, 
for girls, maintained treatment gains; phone-
based continuing care was also as effective as 
in-person models.27 More structured, manualized 
continuing care for adolescents, called assertive 
continuing care, also surfaced as an impactful 
model for adolescents.15  Although there is 
evidence that continuing care plays a key role in 
supporting recovery among adolescents, additional 
investigation into the moderators of both 
participation and effect are called for. 

Another  emergent  youth-specific  element  is  the  

incorporation of digital technology in recovery 
supports. Along with the previously mentioned 
studies utilizing phones for their financial and 
geographic  flexibility  in  continuing  care,
Dennis and colleagues investigated and found 
smartphone  apps  to  be  feasible  and  efficacious  for  
recovery monitoring and support among youth.
The scale of benefits received from peer-based 
and technology-based support merits further 
investigation.

The recovery-oriented systems of care model 
emphasizes communities, especially peer recovery 
support services. Historically, one of the most 
common continuing care recommendations for 
adolescents has been to attend mutual aid groups, 
such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics 
Anonymous.30 Fellowships based on a 12-step 
approach appear to provide a supportive social

context for adolescents in recovery.33  Attendance 
and involvement in 12-step fellowships, 
specifically particular aspects such as meeting 
with a sponsor outside of meetings and verbal 
participation in meetings, have predicted positive 
recovery outcomes for adolescents over and above 
simple attendance, which also has been positively 
associated  with  outcomes  over  time.28,30,33  Other  
underlying mechanisms of 12-step benefits have 
included general social support and providing 
support to others.28,34,35  In combination with 
mutual aid, participation in religious services 
also was found to positively impact adolescent 
recovery.28,36  Expansion  of  youth-specific  12-
step communities has been identified as a way to 
increase youth recovery support.28,30,33 

ROSC, of course, is not limited to mutual aid 
groups. A youth model perhaps best aligned with 
ROSC is the alternative peer group, which began 
in the early 1970s. Although more evidence of 
effectiveness is needed, alternative peer groups 
(APGs) have been described in the literature 
as a model that integrates recovering peers, 
prosocial activities, and evidence-based clinical 
practices.32  Key elements of the APG model 
include psychosocial education, case management, 
social functions, community recovery support, 
family support, and counseling.32  A unique 
and key component of APGs is their focus on 
developmentally appropriate recovery support 
services for adolescents. 

In reviewing the available evidence presented 
for youth recovery within ROSC, including APGs, 
recovery capital (RC) has surfaced as a useful frame 
for classification of supports and may help target 
specific systems or characteristics to foster youth 
recovery. Recovery capital is the breadth and depth 
of resources that persons can access to support their 
recovery across ecological levels.37 The recovery 
capital for adolescents model (RCAM) highlights 
the importance of understanding youth-specific 
recovery processes across four main domains of 
capital: human, financial, social, and community.38 
The utility of RCAM was supported among APG 
participants such that RCAM identified specific 
recovery assets and barriers for youth as well 

as reflected the four recovery capital domains 
previously validated for adults.31,32,38 

The review also yielded evidence of specific 
systems or domains of recovery capital situated 
within a ROSC paradigm that support youth 
recovery. Recovery high schools, for example, 
are specifically designed for students recovering 
from a substance use disorder. Although they 
have been a resource for adolescents since the late 
1970s, they have only begun to be systematically 
empirically evaluated.39 A recent systematic 
review found only one rigorous study to date 
evaluating recovery high schools40—indicating 
a significant need for further investigation. 
These institutions of continuing support for 
youth are dynamic and vary widely in regards to 
enrollment, fiscal stability, governance, staffing, 
and organization; however, the tailored supports 
appear to benefit adolescents’ recovery and 
academic performance.39,41 

Criminal justice institutions also present 
a system in which changes in practice can be 
more supportive for youth recovery. Evidence 
of the role of social support, religious service 
attendance, and service to others among youth 
who have been involved with criminal justice 
institutions indicated that providing a supportive 
recovery environment reduces the risk of relapse, 
incarceration, and violent crime.34,35 

FAMILIES 

The  family  context  has been  identified  as  a  
significant component in the etiology and  
progression of adolescent alcohol and substance  
use for decades.42  Addiction has been commonly  
referred to as a family disease. Like most  
adolescent recovery research, though, the focus has  
been entrenched in the acute addiction treatment  
paradigm.  Jaffe,  for  example,  identifies  family  
therapies as a key treatment modality for youth.43 
The familial relationship, however, can be 

especially complex for adolescents seeking 
recovery, because they often have parents who also 
engage in problematic drinking or use.16  Despite 
the acknowledgement of how critical family is

for adolescents seeking recovery, there remains a 
significant gap in the research literature focusing 
on  recovery  specifically.  Possible  explanations  
include but are not limited to the feasibility of 
family-based research studies. Including additional 
family participants in the research design 
increases cost and demands for methodological 
rigor. Future investigations into mechanisms of 
youth recovery are needed to better understand 
the familial context, as well as to situate families 
within the ROSC and recovery capital frames. 

NON–ABSTINENCE-
BASED APPROACHES 
As ROSC has emerged out of the gaps of acute 
care models, non–abstinence-based approaches 
to recovery have facilitated a new organizing 
paradigm surrounding multiple pathways of 
recovery.5  Although the concept of multiple 
pathways is not new, the exploration of harm 
reduction and medication-assisted treatment 
(MAT) and recovery is relatively recent. Shifting 
the focus to outcomes such as quality of life, 
personal relationships, life satisfaction, and 
improved cognition has presented new avenues 
for investigation and understanding treatment 
effectiveness. This new paradigm has particular 
implications for adolescents.44 

Although the line between abstinence-based 

treatment and abstinence-based recovery has 
become less distinct over time, the lines between 
MAT and medication-assisted recovery have 
always been blurry. White said: 

The historical stigma attached to 
methadone and the broader arena of 
medication-assisted treatment has denied 
MAT patients the status of recovery and left 
them isolated from mainstream community 
life and existing in limbo between cultures 
of addiction and cultures of recovery. . . . 
At the very core of this stigma is the deeply 
imbedded idea that recovery from opioid 
addiction does not begin until the day the 
use of medications like methadone and 
buprenorphine ends. Recovery from no 

other chronic health condition rests on such 
a proposition.45(p6) 
The limbo may be even more profound for 
adolescents. Levy and colleagues suggest MAT 
might be effective in the treatment of opioid 
use disorder for adolescents;46 however, Feder, 
Krawczyk, and Saloner found that only 2% of 
adolescents in treatment for heroin and opioid 
use received MAT, compared to 26% of adults.47 
Beyond the long-standing philosophical issues 
about prescribing medications to treat AUD 
or other SUD, there are also concrete legal 
barriers in both national and state statutes that 
make it difficult for physicians to prescribe 
some medications such as methadone or 
buprenorphine to minors.48 

Additional consideration is needed given 
the legal repercussions of harm reduction for 
adolescents—namely, that consumption of 
alcohol and cannabis is illegal for those under 
age 21—as well as the neurocognitive variables 
for the still-developing adolescent brain.19 
Moreover, although De Sousa found that MAT, 
particularly disulfiram, reduced number of 
drinking days,49  Kaminer and colleagues found 
no evidence that harm reduction motivations 
for AUD yield more desirable outcomes 
than abstinence-based motivations among 
adolescents.19  Empirical evidence of non– 
abstinence-based approaches for young people 
is scant. Future research should explore if these 
approaches are safe and effective for youths. 

DISCUSSION 

In a speech delivered at the UCLA/Betty Ford  
Institute Annual Recovery Conference in 2012,  
historian William White said: “People are  
entering recovery younger and younger, and yet  
little information exists about living a life in  
recovery that begins at age 15 or 25 rather than  
45 or 55.” (p495)  This review has shown White’s  
comments largely still hold. Recovery from AUD  
or other SUD remains a complex and challenging  
concept to define and thus to study, and this is  
even more evident for recovery that begins in

adolescence. Steps have been taken, however, 
to distinguish recovery for people under age 18 
from recovery in adulthood. 

Early efforts to research youth recovery 
viewed it as the result of successful treatment. 
Recovery for adolescents was understood to 
be abstinence-based and usually was assumed 
to include some form of treatment. Studies 
suggested the post-treatment recovery process 
had a different trajectory based upon various 
person-level factors, including the adolescent’s 
cultural identity, student status, trauma history, 
and co-occurring disorders. Most of these 
studies, though, still viewed adolescent recovery 
through a treatment outcome lens. 

The recovery-oriented systems of care 
approach shifted the structural and empirical 
locus to the recovery process itself, and it 
moved away from a program-level orientation 
to a systemic one. Although many studies 
of aftercare, or continuing care, still remain 
situated in a treatment outcome frame, the 
attention has gradually progressed to specific 
components of successful recovery for youth. 
Studies of adolescent ROSC, though still 
relatively small in number, have considered 
adolescent continuing care, mutual aid, peer 
groups, and school-based programs—as well 
as the impact of smartphone technology on 
youth recovery. Addiction also has long been 
understood to be a “family disease,” and there 
have been a few attempts to understand family 
systems in recovery. 

Recovery increasingly has been presented as 

not requiring abstinence, and non–abstinence-
based approaches to recovery have generated 
more attention in the field. The idea of multiple 
pathways to recovery has included paths without 
specialty treatment. Harm reduction and 
MAT approaches for youth have produced few 
empirical studies while getting more support 
philosophically. Traditional outcomes, such as 
relapse or even reduced days of use, have been 
supplanted by variables such as quality of life, 

personal relationships, life satisfaction, and 
improved cognition. 

The arc of the recovery paradigm has been 

moving from acuteness to chronicity, from 
programmatic to systemic, from pathology to 
wellness, from exclusivity to accessibility, from 
homogeneity to diversity, and from selectivity 
to inclusivity. Diagnosis and treatment of 
AUD and SUD have shifted away from seeing 
recovery as a linear progression toward 
abstinence to understanding recovery moving 
along a continuum, which may not necessitate 
complete abstinence. Indeed, alcohol and other 
substances have even been removed from recent 
definitions of recovery to allow room for non– 
substance-related addictions—as supported by 
neuroscience suggesting similar brain activity 
for substance and non–substance-related 
addictions. The turn toward a “big tent” or 
“many roads” approach for recovery has benefits, 
such as mitigating stigma and facilitating healthy 
lives for millions of people. At the same time, the 
unique properties of recovery from AUD or other 
SUD have become harder to glean, especially as 
sobriety becomes less of a goal. As adolescents 
fundamentally differ from adults, it is essential 
to determine when the “big tent”/“many roads” 
concept—established by and for adults—will 
help youth and when it will not. 

FUTURE RESEARCH 

A clear organizing framework is missing 
from the extant adolescent recovery literature. 
Promising work in this area includes the seminal 
article by Brown and Ashford around creating a 
“recovery science”50  and an article by Finch and 
Frieden that provides a synthesis of how classic 
developmental theories form a foundation for 
recovery high school environments and culture.51 
It is hoped that a theoretical model will emerge 
from suggested future research to explain 
behavior change and maintenance, remission, 
and sustained recovery for young people.

Harm Reduction and Medication-
Assisted Recovery 
As harm reduction continues to gain legitimacy 
as a model of recovery, more evidence is needed 
to understand how ongoing substance use may 
impact neurological as well as psychosocial 
development of adolescents. This review also 
has shown that more research is needed on how 
psychopharmacological drugs impact a developing 
brain differently from an adult brain, and how 
those differences implicate medication-assisted 
recovery. Both exploratory and effectiveness 
studies can guide the discussion away from 
passionate debates toward grounded understanding 
and evidence-informed program development. 

Expanding Beyond a Treatment 
Outcome Paradigm 
The prevalence data have shown that although the 
number of youths with AUD or other SUD has 
been declining steadily over the last 2 decades, 
large numbers of adolescents with SUD or co-
occurring disorders still do not have access 
to treatment and/or do not receive treatment. 
Although most of those youths likely do not 
get into recovery as adolescents, many do, and 
they are not being captured in the literature on 
recovery as a treatment outcome. One byproduct 
of widening the umbrella for people in recovery 
should be the subsequent broadening of who gets 
included in programs and studies. 

Recovery Capital for Adolescents 
More studies also are needed for investigating 
various support modalities for youth, including 
recovery residences, recovery high schools, 
alternative peer groups, mutual aid groups, and 
family systems, and how different combinations 
of components may be needed for different people 
and diverse populations. The nascent work on the 
recovery capital model for adolescents38 offers  
great promise in explaining disparities of access 
to certain types of recovery support, as well as 
which factors may benefit one young person 
more than another. The recovery capital model 
in combination with a clearer comprehension of 
adolescent neuroscience of addiction will better 
tune  the  field  of  youth  recovery. 

Recovery Across the Life Span 

Finally, recovery research in general needs 

more life course studies. Recovery begun in 
adolescence cannot be fully understood until 
adulthood. Although retrospective studies 
can provide some data on origination of AUD 
and SUD and the pathways of recovery, better 
precision is needed. Prospective, longitudinal, 
and life course research, beginning in youth and 
continuing at regular intervals, is the only way to 
fully appreciate the complex and cascading nature 
of recovery across the life span. 

LIMITATIONS 

Disparities 
Regarding the wider umbrella, adult studies of 
recovery have considered disparities around 
intersectional identities and social class in 
treatment and recovery. Much of the discourse 
about MAT, harm reduction, and abstinence-based 
recovery has revolved around racial disparities in 
the mental and behavioral health system. Youth 
of color “have less access to, and lower quality of, 
behavioral health services compared to their White 
counterparts.”52(p22)  These disparities and their 
impact on adolescent recovery trajectories need 
more exploration. 

Neither “youth” nor “recovery” has a commonly 
accepted definition. Although the authors were 
diligent in using the literature to frame both for the 
purpose of this review, it is possible that defining 
either concept differently would have taken the 
review in divergent directions. 

In making choices to study adolescents and 
the recovery process, this review did not include 
studies of emerging adults (ages 18 to 25) and 
transitional-age youth (ages 16 to 24), unless youth 
age 18 and younger were explicitly included in the 
sample. Although this allowed the authors to focus 
on adolescents, there may have been studies of 

13 

Alcohol Research: Current ReviewsVol 40 No 3 | 2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adults whose recovery began in their youth, which 
were not reviewed. 

Similarly, in line with the journal’s focus on 
alcohol, the review required alcohol and recovery 
to be main components in the literature search, 
which may have left out articles on SUD that did 
not explicitly mention alcohol. The language used 
in extant literature guided the findings. In studies 
related to recovery and young people, AUD and 
SUD often were discussed in one category instead 
of referencing alcohol and various substances in 
their own capacity. Hennessy and Fisher provide 
an example of how future studies could review 
literature related to broader substance use and 
recovery among young people.53 

Though population effects are considered here, 

the review does not fully explore the diversity 
of adolescent recovery experiences based on 
intersecting identities or social class. This is 
due in large part to the lack of diversity in both 
adolescent recovery support programs and in 
research studies. 

Finally, while using this topic series’ 
own categorizations as an organizing frame 
allowed for conceptual consistency, it can be 
acknowledged that different reviewers may 
have arrived at a different heuristic typology. 
No review of adolescent recovery at this stage 
should be considered definitive, and this review 
is no exception. Rather, the intent was that this 
integrative review would be well designed, 
thorough, and an accurate representation of the 
field to date. 

CONCLUSION 

As the recovery movement has become established 
and access to recovery has broadened, the need 
to explain and study how the concept of recovery 
pertains  specifically  to  adolescents  has  increased.  
This integrative review considered studies of 
youth and recovery across (1) treatment outcomes, 
(2) special emphasis populations, (3) recovery-
oriented systems of care, (4) families, and (5) 
non–abstinence-based approaches. Although this 

review found that the literature on adolescent 
recovery has grown, the authors make the 
following recommendations: 
• More research is needed about the impact and 
effectiveness of medication-assisted recovery 
and harm reduction. 

• The field of adolescent recovery needs to widen 
its scope of practice and research beyond youth 
who have received treatment to include those 
who have not received treatment due to personal 
choice or societal disparities. 

• The literature would benefit from more 
prospective and life course research. 

Research must not lose sight of the unique 
properties of either adolescent development or 
recovery from alcohol or other substance-related 
disorders, and there is great promise in the recovery 
capital model for adolescents and the neuroscience 
of addiction to provide more precision and direction 
to the field of recovery and youth.
