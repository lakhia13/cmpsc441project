## Leading cause of death


View this page as a PDF.

Suicide is death caused by injuring oneself with the intent to die. A suicide attempt is when someone harms themselves with any intent to end their life, but they do not die because of their actions.

Many factors can increase the risk for suicide or protect against it. Suicide is connected to other forms of injury and violence. For example, people who have experienced violence, including child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence have a higher suicide risk. Being connected to family and community support and having easy access to healthcare can decrease suicidal thoughts and behaviors.1


## Serious public health problem


Suicide rates increased approximately 36% between 2000–2022. Suicide was responsible for 49,316 deaths in 2023, which is about one death every 11 minutes.2The number of people who think about or attempt suicide is even higher. In 2022, an estimated 12.8 million adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.7 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.5 million attempted suicide.3


### Suicide affects people of all ages.


In 2023, suicide was among the top 8 leading causes of death for people ages 10-64. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-34.2


### Some groups have higher suicide rates than others.


Suicide rates vary by race/ethnicity, age, and other factors, such as where someone lives. By race/ethnicity, the groups with the highest rates are non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native people followed by non-Hispanic White people.2Other Americans with higher-than-average rates of suicide are veterans, people who live in rural areas, and workers in certain industries and occupations like mining and construction.14Young people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual have higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behavior compared to their peers who identify as heterosexual.5Read more about these suicide disparities and why they exist on theHealth Disparities in Suicide webpage.


## Far-reaching impact


Suicide and suicide attempts cause serious emotional, physical, and economic impacts. People who attempt suicide and survive may experience serious injuries that can have long-term effects on their health. They may also experience depression and othermental healthconcerns.6

Suicide and suicide attempts affect the health and well-being of friends, loved ones, co-workers, and the community. When people die by suicide, their surviving family and friends may experience prolonged grief, shock, anger, guilt, symptoms of depression or anxiety, and even thoughts of suicide themselves.67

The financial toll of suicide on society is also costly. In 2020, suicide and nonfatal self-harm cost the nationover $500 billionin medical costs, work loss costs, value of statistical life, and quality of life costs.


### Suicidal behavior also has far-reaching impact.


There were 49,266 suicides among individuals ages 12 and older  in 2023. But suicides are just the tip of the iceberg. For every suicide death*, there were about:

- 10 emergency department visits for self-harm**

- 48 self-reported suicide attempts in the past year***3

- 325 people who seriously considered suicide in the past year***3
