Purpose: Informal caregivers constitute a vulnerable population group that has forsaken their activities and life projects with the sole 
purpose of caring for a dependent individual without receiving any form of compensation in return. Emotionally, this population has 
been neglected by both the state and family members, exacerbating distress levels among them. The objective is to analyze the impact 
of  emotional  coping  strategies  on  the  experiences  of  distress  and  emotional  burden  among  adult  informal  caregivers  tending  to 
hospitalized individuals.
Sample and Methods: The role of emotional coping strategies in caregiver burden and psychological distress was examined in 460 
informal  adult  caregivers  from  Guayaquil,  Ecuador,  who  participated  in  an  online  survey.  The  instruments  used  included  the 
Depression,  Anxiety,  and  Stress  Scale  (DASS  21),  the  Zarit  Burden  Inventory  (ZBI),  and  the  Emotional  Coping  Questionnaire 
(Cuestionario de Afrontamiento Emocional). The analysis involved a multiple regression to iteratively select variables, aiming to build 
a simpler and more explanatory model.
Results: Employing multiple regression analysis with a stepwise model selection procedure, it was found that 16.5% of the variance 
in depression, 19.5% of the variance in anxiety, 19.8% of the variance in stress, and 32% of the variance in burden were predicted by 
specific coping strategies. Additionally, the impact of burden was estimated by the participants’ gender, with greater burden observed 
among males due to societal role expectations.
Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of emotional coping in the experience of informal caregivers and suggests that 
psychological interventions should focus on developing adaptive strategies to manage the stress and emotional burden associated with 
caregiving.
Keywords: anxiety, depression, stress, emotion regulation, emotional overload, cognitive emotion regulation

Introduction
A  caregiver  is  a  person  who  provides  assistance  or  care,  formally  or  informally,  to  someone  who  needs  help  with 
activities of daily living. The main difference between informal and formal caregivers is the emotional bond between the 
caregiver and the person receiving care. In developing countries, it is more common for family members or friends with 
emotional ties to the person they care for to take on the role of informal caregiver to assume the responsibility of caring 
for  patients  due  to  the  lack  of  support  from  the  healthcare  system.1,2  They  are  not  paid  for  their  services.  Formal 
caregivers, on the other hand, are paid professionals who may or may not have a personal connection.3

Home care has now been promoted as a more affordable alternative for the health of the patient and to avoid the strain 
on  the  family,  which  has  led  to  a  considerable  increase  in  the  role  of  Informal  caregivers,4  who  are  typically  family

members and feel a strong sense of responsibility for the person they are caring for. They are motivated by affection and 
a desire to help, and they often do not have set schedules for their caregiving duties. They may also feel like they cannot 
give  up  their  caregiving  role,  even  if  they  need  to.  This  can  lead  to  feelings  of  stress,  burnout,  and  resentment.  It  is 
important for informal caregivers to take care of themselves and to seek support from others.5

Based on studies related to the socio-demographic aspect of the informal caregiver, it has been demonstrated that the 
role of caregiver is predominantly taken by women (more than 80%), whose caregiver is directly related to them.6,7  In 
Ecuador, informal caregivers are mostly women (83.2%) and dedicate between 1 and 15 hours a day to caregiving.8  In 
addition, they are the ones who most commonly present overload due to this unpaid work.9 The work of caregivers, being 
a  service  that  is  provided  in  the  private  sphere  and  individually,  does  not  typically  receive  recognition  by  the  wider 
society. However, the recognition that caregivers generally need to receive comes from the environment of the dependent 
person,  which  allows  them  to  manage  the  frustration  that  this  work  entails,  especially  if  they  do  not  receive  positive 
feedback  from  the  person  being  cared  for.10  Only  the  main  informal  caregiver  of  severely  disabled  people  in  Ecuador 
receives the Joaquín Gallegos Lara Bonus (240 USD per month).11

Informal caregivers often assume this role without the necessary knowledge and skills about the caregiving condition 
and how it should be coped with in order to make positive progress, becoming more prone to emotional distress because 
of all the sudden and drastic changes in their lifestyle.12  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the 
health care system, and one of the most notable changes has been the increase in younger caregivers who have less time 
and energy for  caregiving.13  In  the  context of  the  caregiver,  overload  can  be understood  as  a  state of  excessive  stress, 
emotional and physical exhaustion that negatively affects their mental and physical health, due to the excessive demands 
that a caregiver must face and that impair their own quality of life.14  The repercussions of overload are compounded by 
the  emotional  state,  particularly  by  stress,  anxiety  and  depression  (also  known  as  psychological  distress),15  which  can 
lead  to  physical  problems  such  as  headaches,  chronic  fatigue  and  sleep  cycle  disturbances;  and  in  socioeconomic 
problems  of  the  caregiver  such  as  isolation  or  readjustment  of  social  life,  resignation  from  a  job,  abandonment  of 
a partner, changes in future plans if the caregiver is the spouse or a child, and role reversal in the case of children caring 
for their parents.16

The role of the informal caregiver can be stressful and overwhelming, and it is crucial that the caregiver has resources 
and strategies to cope with this overload. Coping, refers to the mental and behavioral efforts a person takes to deal with 
events  that  are  considered  too  demanding  or  overwhelming  for  their  internal  and  external  resources.17  Therefore  is 
necessary understand these survival mechanisms to help informal caregivers cope with the demands of providing care.18
Coping  strategies  are  classified  as  adaptive  and  maladaptive.  Adaptive  strategies  focus  on  managing  the  conflict, 
promoting  the  caregiver’s  adaptation  to  the  conflict.  On  the  other  hand,  maladaptive  strategies  focus  on  avoiding  the 
conflict and its consequences.19  It is important to note that coping is used regardless of its nature, but it is the caregiver 
who has a subjective preference for a certain coping strategy or style. Sandín & Chorot, propose a classification of basic 
coping  strategies  that  focus  on  problem-solving  (FPS;  active  confrontation  and  resolution  of  concrete  problems.), 
negative  self-focus  (NSF;  Attention  on  negative  thoughts  about  oneself.),  positive  reappraisal  (PR;  Finding  positive 
meaning  in  negative  situations.),  open  emotional  expression  (OEE;  Talking  about  feelings  and  emotions  with  others.), 
avoidance  (AV;  Avoid  or  minimize  stressful  thoughts  or  situations.),  seeking  social  support  (SSS;  Seek  help  and 
emotional support from others.) and religion (RLG; Finds comfort and meaning in religious beliefs and practices).20

Each  coping  strategy  may  have  different  consequences,  depending  on  the  situation  and  the  person  using  it  and 
explains why some caregivers thrive while others struggle.21  For example, the problem-solving strategy (FSP) may be 
effective in addressing immediate problems,22  while avoidance (AV) may be useful in managing stress or anxiety in the 
short-term.23 However, avoidance may also have negative long-term consequences, as it may limit the caregiver’s ability 
to cope and solve problems.24  In conclusion, it is important for informal caregivers to be aware of the different coping 
strategies and learn how to use them flexibly to manage the emotional overload associated with their role. Identifying the 
most effective strategies in different situations can help caregivers improve their quality of life and provide better care for 
the people they care for.25

To  date,  few  studies  have  examined  variables  that  allow  us  to  understand  the  relationship  between  specific  coping 
strategies (SCS) and caregiver distress and burden. Most studies focus on: isolated factors that contribute to increasing

caregiver burden,  (eg, higher sense  of  coherence  is associated  with a reduced risk  of burden.26),  analyzing  the general 
impact  of  coping  strategies  on  burden.27  Those  that  study  how  specific  strategies  act  on  caregivers  either  relate  them 
only28  or  establish  their  impact  on  mental  health  in  general.29  The  importance  of  this  study  is  evident  in  the  current 
context,  marked  by  the  growing  number  of  informal  caregivers  who  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  care  of  people  with 
disabilities or chronic illnesses. However, this role can be extremely stressful and have a negative impact on the mental 
and  emotional  health  of  caregivers.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  to  accurately  identify  coping  strategies  and  sociodemo-
graphic  variables  that  can  predict  psychological  distress  and  overload  in  these  caregivers  of  Ecuador.  Understanding 
these coping mechanisms is essential to design effective interventions and supports that help them cope with the demands 
of providing care in non-weird30  (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) population on these under-
studied aspects. This proposes a new approach to addressing the well-being of informal caregivers.

The results of this study will provide a foundation for the development of programs aimed at improving emotional 
coping  strategies,  which  can  help  informal  caregivers  to  more  effectively  manage  the  stress  and  emotional  overload 
inherent  in  their  role.  These  programs  could  range  from  individual  or  group  therapy  to  relaxation  and  meditation 
techniques,  as  well  as  other  strategies  designed  to  strengthen  the  mental  and  emotional  health  of  informal  caregivers. 
Ultimately, this study has the potential to contribute not only to improving the quality of life of informal caregivers and 
the people they care for, but also to alleviating the burden on the health care system and promoting a more compassionate 
view of health care in society.

Materials and Methods
Participants
460 informal caregivers aged 18 years and older who were not paid for caregiving participated in the study. The age groups 
were evenly distributed, with 195 participants (42.391%) aged 18–29 years, 83 participants (18.077%) aged 30–39 years, 89 
participants (19.348%) aged 40–49 years, 73 participants (15.870%) aged 50–59 years, and 20 participants (4.348%) aged 
60 years and older. Of the participants, 288 identified themselves as women (62.609%) and 172 as men (37.391%).

Data were collected through a targeted Google Form survey administered to informal caregivers in the hospitalization rest 
rooms for family members in several hospitals in Guayaquil. Leveraging the efficient and secure of digital forms,31,32 rigorous 
participant selection was implemented to ensure alignment with research objective and inclusion criteria (age ≥ 18 years, non- 
remuneration for caregiving). Prior to accessing the survey, participants received comprehensive information about the study’s 
objectives and eligibility requirements. The survey design gave priority to the autonomy of the participants. In particular, no 
time limit was imposed for participants to make the decision to participate in the study. This was to ensure that participants 
could deliberate about their participation. The type of sampling was convenience sampling.

The sample was analyzed using G*Power software.33  The analysis yielded 100% statistical power for the six linear 
regression  models  from  the  effect  sizes  found  in  the  study.  All  procedures  performed  in  the  present  study  were  in 
accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Scientific  Council  of  Ecotec  University,  adhering  to  the  1964  Declaration  of 
Helsinki and its subsequent amendments.

Materials
Sociodemographic data were collected using an ad hoc questionnaire that included questions about age, sex, age of the 
person  under  care,  educational  background,  relationship  with  the  person  under  care,  and  number  of  children.  The 
questionnaire  was  developed  in  accordance  with  the  safety  guidelines,  and  no  questions  were  asked  that  could  be 
considered sexually suggestive or explicit.

The  Depression,  Anxiety  and  Stress  Scale34  was  used  to  evaluate  the  emotional  states  of  depression,  stress,  and 
anxiety.  The  Spanish  adaptation  of  the  DASS  2135  was  used  in  this  study.  The  DASS  21  is  a  self-report  measure  that 
consists of 21 items, each of which is rated on a four-point Likert scale (0 to 3). The DASS 21 has been shown to have 
high  internal  consistency  in  Spanish-speaking  populations,  with  Cronbach’s  α  values  of  0.93  for  depression,  0.86  for 
anxiety, and 0.91 for stress.36  The internal consistency range across the DASS21 subscales (Depression, Anxiety, Stress) 
in this study, with α values around 0.83, indicates robust internal consistency within each measured construct.

The  Questionnaire  for  Emotional  Coping  (Cuestionario  de  Afrontamiento  Emocional)20  was  used  to  assess  coping 
strategies. The CAE is a self-report measure that consists of 42 items, each of which is rated on a five-point Likert scale 
(0 to 4). The CAE assesses seven coping strategies: problem-focused coping (FSP), negative self-focus (NSP), positive 
reappraisal  (PR),  overt  emotional  expression  (OEE),  avoidance  (AVD),  seeking  social  support  (SSS),  and  religion 
(REL).37  Higher  scores  on  a  coping  strategy  indicate  greater  use  of  that  strategy.  The  CAE  has  been  shown  to  have 
good internal consistency, with Cronbach’s α values ranging from 0.64 to 0.85. In this study, the CAE subscales (FSP, 
NSP,  PR,  etc.)  demonstrated  exceptional  internal  consistency,  with  α  values  surpassing  0.86,  indicating  excellent 
reliability for these ability measures.

The Zarit Burden Interview Scale (ZBI)38 was used to assess caregiver burden. The Spanish version of the ZBI39 was 
used in this study. The ZBI is a self-report measure that consists of 22 items, each of which is rated on a five-point Likert 
scale  (0  to  4).  The  ZBI  has  been  shown  to  have  high  internal  consistency  in  Spanish-speaking  populations,  with 
a  Cronbach’s  α  value  of  0.92.  The  ZBI  assesses  three  domains  of  caregiver  burden:  overload,  competence,  and 
dependence.  Overload  refers  to  the  physical,  emotional,  and  financial  burden  of  caregiving.  Competence  refers  to  the 
ability of the care recipient to perform activities of daily living. Meanwhile, dependence refers to the need for the care 
recipient  for  help  with  activities  of  daily  living.  The  overall  internal  consistency  range  in  this  study,  as  indicated  by 
measures  such  as  McDonald’s  ω  and  Cronbach’s  α,  spanned  from  0.74  to  0.95.  This  range  suggests  good  to  excellent 
internal consistency.

Prior  to  data  collection,  the  questionnaire  was  piloted  10  informal  caregivers.  For  more  information  about  internal 

consistency of all the instruments, see Supplementary data 1.

Procedure
Data collection was carried out through a Google form that was provided to participants whose family members or caregivers 
were hospitalized in hospitals in the city of Guayaquil. The form indicated that this was an investigation to understand the 
factors that influence the emotional states of informal caregivers. The data was collected by students of the “Caring for the 
Caregiver” linkage project, which began in October 2022 and ended in January 2023. This was part of the research project 
“Strategies for emotional self-care”. Furthermore, continuous real-time monitoring by the investigators during data collection 
identified potential ineligibility and ensured respondents’ accurate understanding of the survey questions.

The data was anonymized, and informed consent was mandatory and the survey incorporated a crucial safeguard to 
ensure informed participant and their right to withdraw at any time. A dedicated question explicitly asked participants to 
agree to participate in the study and only those who actively consented gained access to the full survey. This deliberate 
design not only strengthened the informed consent process but also established a foundation for participant engagement 
throughout the study.

Analysis
Data analysis was conducted using the free software Jeffreys’s Amazing Statistics Program.40 The internal consistency of 
the DASS21, CAE, and ZBI was calculated for the sample. Subsequently, several multiple regression models were tested 
using a stepwise selection method. This method was used because of the limited information on the influence of coping 
strategies on the presence of states of depression, anxiety, stress, on informal caregiver overload.

Results
Descriptive Statistics and Sex Differences
Table  1  summarizes  the  descriptive  statistics  and  Pearson  correlations  between  the  variables  analyzed.  The  socio-
demographic  variables  of  the  sample  that  presented  significant  results  (p  <  0.05)  were  included  in  the  analysis. 
Regarding  gender  differences,  it  was  determined  that  in  the  sample  these  are  significant  at  the  level  of  perception  of 
overload and dependence on the person under care, with men being the ones who perceive these situations more. At the 
same time, the male participants had fewer children than the women.

Multiple Linear Regression Models
Six  stepwise  multiple  linear  regression  models  were  conducted  to  identify  variables  that  predict  the  occurrence  of 
caregiver overload, caregiver competence, caregiver dependence, depression, stress, and anxiety. As shown in Table 3, 
the models included the following variables: For the models of depression, anxiety, and stress: the seven factors of the 
CAE  and  the  following  sample  variables:  age  and  the  number  of  children  of  minors.  For  overload:  the  seven  coping 
strategies  assessed  by  the  CAE,  the  scores  on  the  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  subscales  of  the  DASS21,  and  the 
following sample variables: age and the number of children of minors.

Discussion
Before analyzing the predictive value of emotional coping on symptoms of caregiver distress and caregiver overload, we 
analyzed the descriptive statistics and identified sex differences in relation to emotional states. Women in non-caregiver 
samples  have presented  significantly higher  anxiety than  men,7  on the contrary,  in our  results,  men have  more  anxiety 
than  women.  This  may  be  related  to  the  fact  that  in  some  cultures  men  are  not  skilled  or  trained  to  care  for  another 
person.41  Particularly, Ecuadorian culture is strongly influenced by male chauvinism, a set of beliefs and behaviors that 
promote male dominance and female subordination.42 This is reflected in media, religion, and education, perpetuating the 
unequal  political  dynamics  between  genders.43  Significant  differences  at  the  sex  level  are  also  found  in  the  states  of 
caregiving overload and dependence, with men reporting higher levels than women. This is consistent with findings from 
other studies, such as the one conducted by Sharma et al.44 However, they consider the variance to be small. With respect 
to  depression,  the  gender  differences  in  signs  of  depression  are  reduced,  similar  to  what  was  found  in  the  study  by 
Pinquart  &  Sorensen.45  These  results  explain,  as  more  men  step  into  caregiver  roles  due  to  shifting  demographics, 
traditional  assumptions  about  caregiver  roles  and  responsibilities  are  being  challenged,  demanding  a  more  nuanced 
approach to providing effective support. In short, men’s experience of caregiving has not been adequately explained.

After presenting the descriptive statistics, we analyzed the predictive value of several sociodemographic variables and 
the  SCS  on  psychological  distress  and  caregiver  burden.  The  resulting  models  showed  that  emotional  coping  played 
a predominant role in the prediction of depression, anxiety, stress, and overload. Models composed exclusively of SCS 
factors predict 16.5% of the variance in depression, 19.5% of the variance in anxiety, and 19.8% in stress. This means 
that the inclusion of the other demographic variables only improves the predictive value of the models by less than 1%. 
On  the  Zarit  factors,  coping  strategies  manage  to  predict  32.2%  of  overload,  19.5%  of  competence,  and  22%  of 
dependence. Therefore, sociodemographic variables and distress only explain 7%, 6.5%, and 3% respectively.

Among the emotional coping strategies investigated, open emotional expression emerges as a significant predictor in the 
Zarit  overload  and  anxiety  models,  while  negative  self-focus  appears  as  a  significant  predictor  in  the  distress  models 
(Depression, Anxiety and Stress), ie, these coping strategies are enhancers of distress and overload states. However, it was 
detected that problem-solving focus and religion serve as protective factors, the former for signs of overload and the latter in 
the  case  of  stress.  Previous  studies  have  reported  the  relationship  between  negative  self-focus  with  anxiety,  stress  and 
depression.46–49  Nevertheless, they have been detected only in non-caregivers’ sample and caregivers of brain-injured and

mentally ill patients. While these specific coping strategies may be more prevalent in certain groups (eg, non-caregivers and 
mental caregivers) we have proven that they are effective for caregivers, regardless of the specific situation.

Open  emotional  expression,  as  assessed  by  the  CAE,  can  be  a  difficult  coping  strategy  for  caregivers.  While  some 
studies  have  shown  that  it  can  be  beneficial  in  reducing  isolation  and  improving  relationships,50  particularly  when 
communication  is  focused  on  problem-solving,51  other  studies,  including  our  own,  have  found  that  it  can  lead  to 
caregiver overload.52,53  This is because caregivers may not receive adequate support when they express their emotions, 
which  can  lead  to  feeling  unheard  and  unsupported.  Especially  due  to  toll  of  caregiving,  caregivers‘wishes  can  be 
undervalued by the family, who prioritize the patient’s needs.

The  results  of  this  study  suggest  that  emotional  coping  plays  a  significant  role  in  the  experience  of  depression, 
anxiety, stress, and overload symptoms in informal caregivers. This is not surprising, as caring for another person can be 
a significant emotional burden, especially when there is a family bond involved. In addition to coping, we also analyzed 
other  variables  that  could  predict  the  emotional  symptoms  of  caregivers.  We  found  that  age  is  directly  related  to 
dependence  on  overload,  but  is  a  protective  factor  against  depression  symptoms.  Additionally,  the  number  of  children 
explains less anxiety, although its predictive value is very low.

Conclusion
This  study  sheds  light  on  the  crucial  role  of  emotional  coping  for  informal  caregivers,  highlighting  the  significant 
challenges they face in managing the emotional burden of caregiving. Our findings reveal that neglecting these strategies 
can have detrimental consequences for both the caregiver’s well-being (burden and distress), as a result, the quality of 
their  care  suffers.  Therefore,  prioritizing  interventions  that  equip  caregivers  with  adaptive  and  contextualized  coping 
strategies  is  essential  like  proactive  problem-solving  and  reliance  on  faith,  and  avoiding  unhelpful  approaches  like 
negative self-focus and open emotional expression. This could involve skill-building workshops on stress management 
and emotional regulation, alongside robust support groups and readily accessible mental health services. By investing in 
the emotional well-being of informal caregivers, we can not only improve their quality of life but also ensure they can 
continue to provide vital care for loved ones in need.
