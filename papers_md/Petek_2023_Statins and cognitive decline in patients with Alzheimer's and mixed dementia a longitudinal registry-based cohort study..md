Abstract 
Background  Disturbances in brain cholesterol homeostasis may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD). Lipid‑lowering medications could interfere with neurodegenerative processes in AD through cholesterol 
metabolism or other mechanisms.

Objective  To explore the association between the use of lipid‑lowering medications and cognitive decline over time 
in a cohort of patients with AD or mixed dementia with indication for lipid‑lowering treatment.

Methods  A longitudinal cohort study using the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/Dementia Disorders, linked 
with other Swedish national registries. Cognitive trajectories evaluated with mini‑mental state examination (MMSE) 
were compared between statin users and non‑users, individual statin users, groups of statins and non‑statin lipid‑
lowering medications using mixed‑effect regression models with inverse probability of drop out weighting. A dose‑
response analysis included statin users compared to non‑users.

Results  Our cohort consisted of 15,586 patients with mean age of 79.5 years at diagnosis and a majority of women 
(59.2 %). A dose‑response effect was demonstrated: taking one defined daily dose of statins on average was associ‑
ated with 0.63 more MMSE points after 3 years compared to no use of statins (95% CI: 0.33;0.94). Simvastatin users 
showed 1.01 more MMSE points (95% CI: 0.06;1.97) after 3 years compared to atorvastatin users. Younger (< 79.5 
years at index date) simvastatin users had 0.80 more MMSE points compared to younger atorvastatin users (95% 
CI: 0.05;1.55) after 3 years. Simvastatin users had 1.03 more MMSE points (95% CI: 0.26;1.80) compared to rosuvasta‑
tin users after 3 years. No differences regarding statin lipophilicity were observed. The results of sensitivity analysis 
restricted to incident users were not consistent.

Conclusions  Some patients with AD or mixed dementia with indication for lipid‑lowering medication may benefit 
cognitively from statin treatment; however, further research is needed to clarify the findings of sensitivity analyses.

Background
The brain houses about a quarter of the cholesterol pre-
sent  in  the  body,  making  it  the  richest  cholesterol-con-
taining  organ  [1].  The  essential  role  of  brain  cholesterol 
is reflected in its involvement in numerous physiological 
processes such as maintaining membrane integrity, neu-
rotransmission  and  synaptogenesis  [2].  A  dysregulation 
of  brain  cholesterol  homeostasis  may  be  involved  in  the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease [2] through interfer-
ence with the amyloidogenic Aβ pathway [3], impairment 
of cerebral blood flow [4], and other mechanisms [5]. On 
the  other  hand,  the  association  of  peripheral  hypercho-
lesterolemia and cognition is complex. Peripheral hyper-
cholesterolemia  in  midlife  has  been  linked  to  cognitive 
decline and AD in late-life [6, 7] through different mech-
anisms [7–10]. Moreover, genetic polymorphism of brain 
cholesterol  transporter  ApoE4  and  several  additional 
genetic  factors  implicated  in  lipid  metabolism  could  be 
relevant to AD pathogenesis [11, 12]. In contrast, periph-
eral  hyperlipidaemia  in  late  life  is  a  marker  of  a  better 
general health and cognition [13, 14].

The possible cognitive  effects of HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitors  or  statins,  which  are  used  in  cardiovascular 
disease  prevention,  have  sparked  extensive  research  in 

the  last  few  decades.  Based  on  their  pharmacokinetic 
characteristics,  statins  can  be  divided  according  to  their 
structure  (fungus-derived  or  synthetical),  lipophilicity, 
metabolism,  bioavailability,  potency  and  binding  to  dif-
ferent  proteins  and  transporters  [15].  The  multi-layered 
effects  of  statins  on  cognition  are  translated  through 
numerous  neurodegenerative  processes  in  a  choles-
terol-dependent  as  well  as  independent  (´´pleiotropic´´) 
manner [15, 16]. Statins seem to interfere with the amy-
loidogenic cascade [17] and phosphorylation of tau [18], 
provide  beneficial  vascular  factors  through  endothelial 
function  and  clearance  of  neurotoxic  substances  [19], 
decrease neuroinflammation and oxidative stress as well 
as promote neuronal survival and plasticity, synaptogen-
esis and neurotransmission [16].

The  overall  cognitive  effects  of  statins  are  likely  con-
nected to a complex interaction of factors, related to the 
patient’s  characteristics,  integrity  of  blood–brain  barrier 
permeability  [20],  characteristics  of  statins  [18],  time  of 
treatment, dosages as well as critical time windows in the 
pathogenesis of dementia [21, 22] (Fig. 1).

Despite  the  extensive  number  of  observational  cohort 
studies  and  some  clinical  trials  on  statins,  their  abil-
ity  to  prevent  dementia  or  ameliorate  cognitive  decline 

Fig. 1  Interaction between the patient’s and medication’s characteristics potentially influence the cognitive effects of statins. Two separate 
cholesterol pools in the body are thought to be connected to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), central and peripheral. The brain penetration 
of statins has been attributed to different factors linked to BBB crossing (lipophilicity of a statin, chemical structure, molecular weight and size 
of the molecule, different transporters and their genetic polymorphisms). The structure of the barrier itself additionally influences the permeability 
of statins and is affected by aging, neurodegenerative processes and possibly, peripheral hypercholesterolemia. The overall cognitive effects 
of statins are likely a result of their central and peripheral actions and are connected to the time of intervention in life and the pathogenesis of AD. 
Moreover, an interaction of comorbidities and comedication, a sufficient time of treatment and dosages are important. In midlife, protective effect 
of statins against AD could be achieved through lowering the metabolic risk of hyperlipidaemia. BBB blood–brain barrier, AD Alzheimer’s disease

after disease onset is still unclear. A number of mild and 
reversible  short-term  cognitive  adverse  effects  [23,  24] 
contributed to a warning for the labelling of statins by the 
US  Food  and  Drug  Administration.  However,  numerous 
large systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not con-
firmed these adverse cognitive effects [25–29] and some 
suggested that the use of statins may lower the risk of AD 
[25, 30–33]. Clinical trials generally reported a null effect 
[34–36] but were commonly underpowered or used less 
robust cognitive evaluation tools. Comparably less infor-
mation is available regarding the effect of statins on cog-
nitive  decline  in  patients  with  established  AD  [37–40]. 
Epidemiological  biases  inherent  to  observational  design 
or a heterogeneous design of studies partly explain these 
discrepancies [41].

The  aim  of  our  study  was  to  evaluate  the  association 
between  statin  use  and  cognitive  decline  over  time  in  a 
large  cohort  of  patients  diagnosed  with  AD  or  mixed 
AD  dementia.  We  hypothesized  that  statins  that  cross 
the  BBB  would  be  associated  with  less  cognitive  decline 
evaluated  with  mini-mental  state  examination  (MMSE) 
in these patients.

Methods
Study design and registries

We  performed  a  longitudinal  cohort  study  of  patients 
with  AD  or  mixed  dementia  and  indication  for  lipid-
lowering treatment, registered in the Swedish registry for 
dementia (SveDem). SveDem is a nationwide quality-of-
care  registry,  established  in  2007  [42].  All  memory  clin-
ics  and  78  %  of  primary  care  centres  in  Sweden  report 
to  SveDem  [43].  From  this  registry,  we  obtained  demo-
graphic information (age, sex, living arrangements), date 
and  care  unit  of  registration,  type  of  dementia  diagno-
sis  and  cognitive  status  of  the  patients  (MMSE  scores) 
at  baseline  and  follow-ups.  The  date  of  the  dementia 
diagnosis  in  SveDem  was  set  as  the  index  date;  61%  of 
patients had only one entry, 26% had two, 8% had 3 and 
5%  had  more  than  3.  In  total,  80,004  individual  patients 
with dementia were registered in SveDem between 2007 
and 2018. All patients were followed until death, emigra-
tion or end of follow-up (16 October 2018).

All patients with a missing MMSE score at index date 
were  excluded  from  the  analyses.  Only  patients  diag-
nosed  with  hyperlipidaemia  (ICD-10  codes  from  E78.0 
to E78.6 obtained from the the Swedish National Patient 
Registry  (NPR),  see  below)  in  the  preceding  10  years 
before  the  index  date  or  those  with  a  prescription  of 
statins (ICD-10 code C10 obtained from the Swedish Pre-
scribed  Drug  Registry  (PDR),  see  below)  in  the  preced-
ing 6 months before the index date were included in the 
analyses. Furthermore, the top 1% of statins users sorted 
by averaged defined daily doses (DDD) were excluded as 

well,  assuming  that  their  consumption  data  was  falsely 
high  and  that  these  individuals  bought  medication  that 
they did not consume. Figure 2 shows the patient selec-
tion  flowchart:  15,586  individuals  were  included  for  the 
main analysis.

Exposures

The  exposure  drug  use  was  extracted  for  every  SveDem 
entry.  Drug  use  was  defined  from  the  PDR  as  either 
the  average  DDD  during  the  6-month  period  preced-
ing  each  SveDem  entry  date  or  simply  as  a  categorical 
variable  (yes/no)  during  the  same  period  (time-updated 
exposure).  Time-updated  exposure  means  that  pres-
ence/absence  and  dose  of  statins  was  examined  in  each 
6-month  period  leading  up  to  each  measurement  of 
MMSE  (baseline  or  follow-up).  Individual  patients 
starting  their  statin  treatment  after  the  index  date  were 
excluded  from  the  analyses  because  cognitive  decline 
could have affected prescription. All other patients were 
included  in  the  analyses  as  non-users.  DDD  is  defined 
by the World Health Organization as the assumed aver-
age  maintenance  daily  dose  of  a  medication  for  its 
primary  indication  in  adults  [44].  One  DDD  of  simvas-
tatin  is  equivalent  to  30  mg  of  simvastatin  or  20  mg  of 
atorvastatin.

Medication use

Medication  use  with  their  corresponding  ATC  codes 
were collected from the PDR that was established in 2005, 
which  includes  all  prescription  medication  dispensed  at 
Swedish  pharmacies  [45].  Lipid-lowering  medications 
included  simvastatin,  pravastatin,  fluvastatin,  rosuvasta-
tin, pitavastatin, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic 
acid  and  derivates  and  other  non-statin  lipid  lowering 
medications.  Comedications  were  calculated  as  time-
updated  exposures  (yes/no)  during  the  6-month  period 
preceding  the  index  date.  Comedications  were  selected 
based on known relevance for patients with dementia and 
included cardiac drugs, vasoprotectives, platelet aggrega-
tion  inhibitors,  anticoagulants,  antipsychotics,  anxiolyt-
ics, hypnotics, antidepressants, cholinesterase inhibitors, 
memantine  and  vitamin  D  (Appendix).  Assumption  on 
the  adherence  was  made  based  on  the  collection  of  the 
medication at the pharmacy.

Comorbidities

Comorbidities  were  obtained  with  their  corresponding 
ICD-10  codes  from  the  NPR  and  were  coded  dichoto-
mously up to 10 years before index date. NPR covers all 
diagnoses from in-hospital and specialist clinics. Comor-
bidities were selected based on their known relevance for 
cognition in patients with dementia and included diabe-
tes  mellitus,  arrythmia,  heart  failure,  atrial  fibrillation,

diovascular  disease,  ischemic  heart  disease,  respiratory 
disease,  stroke,  anaemia,  liver  disease,  malignancy  and 
obesity (Appendix).

Covariates

Covariates  that  were  considered  included  age  at  base-
line,  sex  (male/female),  residency  (living  with  another 
adult/alone/nursing  home/missing),  type  of  dementia 
diagnostic unit (special memory clinic/primary care cen-
tre) and calendar year of dementia diagnosis, all at index 
date. We selected the covariates that are likely associated 
with  cognitive  functions  or  the  probability  of  receiving 
statins,  based  on  previous  research  and/or  our  clinical 
knowledge.

The linkage of data from the forementioned registries—
SveDem, Swedish National Patient Registry, and Swedish 
Prescribed  Drug  Registry—was  allowed  by  the  personal 
identification  number  of  each  Swedish  citizen.  Patient 
identification  was  pseudonymized  and  blinded  to  the 
researchers.

Outcome

The main outcome was cognitive decline, evaluated with 
MMSE points.

Statistical analysis

The data were described in terms of mean and standard 
deviation  (SD)  for  continuous  variables  and  as  positive 
counts (percentages) for categorical variables.

Linear  mixed-effects  regression  models  with  random 
intercept  and  slope  were  used  to  investigate  the  change 
in  MMSE  scores  over  time  and  to  detect  differences 
between statin users and non-users. The model included 
statin  use  and  time  from  index  date  as  continuous  vari-
ables and an interaction between drug use and time. Fol-
lowing our previous work in SveDem [46], a linear trend 
over time was assumed and the model allowed for a ran-
dom  intercept  and  random  slope  for  each  patient.  This 
model  is  referred  to  as  the  crude  model.  In  an  adjusted 
model,  comedications,  comorbidities  and  other  covari-
ates  were  included  in  the  model  mostly  as  categorical 
variables.  Only  age,  MMSE  scores  and  calendar  year  at 
index  date  were  treated  as  continuous  variables.  Fully 
adjusted models included clinical and demographic char-
acteristics  (MMSE  score  at  baseline  and  age  at  diagno-
sis,  year  of  diagnosis,  sex,  residency,  comorbidities  and 
comedications).  Inverse  probability  weighting  was  used 
to  account  for  the  potential  effects  of  general  attrition 
from those lost to follow-up due to dropout. For this pur-
pose, a logistic regression model was fitted to the data to 
estimate the probability of dropping out within the sub-
sequent  year.  Dropout  was  defined  as  the  last  observed

MMSE score without death or study end occurring in the 
subsequent year. For more details, see Handels et al. [47].
The  analyses  were  repeated  for  selected  drug  groups 
where  drug  use  was  defined  as  yes/no  during  the 
6-month  period  before  each  SveDem  entry  date  and  in 
subgroups defined by gender and age. We split the cohort 
at the mean age at index date (79.5 years) to create sub-
groups of younger and older patients. We compared indi-
vidual  statin  users.  We  considered  two  approaches  to 
divide  the  statins  regarding  their  functional  properties: 
firstly,  lipophilic  (simvastatin,  atorvastatin,  fluvastatin, 
lovastatin and pitavastatin) or hydrophilic groups (rosu-
vastatin,  pravastatin)  [48].  Moreover,  we  classified  them 
into fungus-derived (simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin) 
or synthetic statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, 
rosuvastatin, pitavastatin) [15]. Finally, we compared sta-
tin  users  to  non-statin  lipid-lowering  medication  users. 
To  evaluate  the  association  between  the  comparison 
groups  after  3  years,  we  calculated  a  theoretical  linear 
extrapolation based on the mixed effect models.

Multiple  imputations  of  MMSE  scores  [47]  and  inci-
dent  users  models  were  two  additional  models  we 

performed  as  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  check  the  robust-
ness of our results. The first model deals with bias arising 
from missing MMSE scores at follow-ups and the second 
addresses  the  length  of  treatment  as  confounding.  Inci-
dent  users  were  defined  as  drug  users  who  did  not  take 
out  any  drug  prescription  of  statins  during  12  months 
before  6-month  period  preceding  each  SveDem  entry 
date. Table 1 shows the design of the study.

The  cluster  robust  sandwich  estimator  was  used  to 
estimate  standard  error  of  the  estimations  and  two-
sided  p-values  were  reported.  All  analyses  were  con-
ducted  using  STATA  version  16.1  (StataCorp,  College 
Station, TX).

Patients with AD and mixed dementia who had hyperlipidaemia were included in the study. Outcome was cognitive decline, evaluated with MMSE points. Linear 
mixed-effects regression models with inverse probability of drop out weighting were used.

Main analysis included comparison of statin users to non-users of statins which included information on average defined daily dose (DDD) of statins in the 6-month 
period preceding index date.

Secondary analyses consisted of comparisons between simvastatin vs atorvastatin, simvastatin vs rosuvastatin users, lipophilic vs hydrophilic statin users, fungal 
vs synthetic statin users and non-statin lipid lowering medication users vs statin users, using a dichotomous (yes/no) use of medications in the 6-month period 
preceding index date.

All analysis was stratified on gender and mean age of the cohort at index date (79.5 years). Sensitivity analysis included multiple imputations of MMSE and incident 
users.
1 Lipophilic statins: simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin
2 Hydrophilic statins users: pravastatin, rosuvastatin
3 Fungal statins (type 1): lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin
4 Synthetic statins (type 2): atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin

The  average  time  of  follow-up  was  0.86  (SD  =  1.40) 
years  and  average  number  of  MMSE  follow-ups  for  a 
patient  with  measures  of  MMSE  was  1.61  (SD  =  0.97). 
The  average  decline  per  year  of  the  cohort  was  −1.20 
points MMSE (95% CI: −1.32; −1.09). The average cogni-
tive  decline  observed  among  6113  patients  with  at  least 
two MMSE measurements was −2.61 points (SD = 4.57).
Statin users were more commonly male (44 % vs 33.5 
%,  p  <  0.001),  younger  (78.7  vs  80.7  years  at  baseline, 
p < 0.001) and had a better cognitive status at baseline 

(21.3  vs  20.8  MMSE  points,  p  <  0.001),  compared  to 
non-users  of  statins.  As  expected,  there  was  a  higher 
prevalence of comorbidities in the former compared to 
the  latter  group,  such  as  hypertension,  cardiovascular 
disease, liver disease and diabetes mellitus. Statin users 
were  more  likely  to  be  prescribed  co-medication,  such 
as  antithrombotics,  antihypertensives,  antidiabetics  or 
psycholeptics.  More  detailed  information  is  presented 
in Tables 2 and 3.

The sensitivity analysis revealed that a majority of our 
cohort had used statins at some point in time. Overall, 
844  patients  were  incident  users  of  statins.  Compared 
to  incident  simvastatin  users  (n  =  557),  incident  ator-
vastatin  users  (n  =  267)  had  a  lower  baseline  MMSE 
(20.5  vs  21.4  points,  p  =  0.01)  and  less  commonly 
received  their  dementia  diagnosis  at  special  memory 
clinic  (60.3  %  vs  78.8  %,  p  <  0.001).  (Supplementary 
table 7).

Cognitive decline in different treatment groups
Statin users compared to non‑ users of statins

Statin  use  was  associated  with  a  slower  cognitive 
decline over time compared to no use of statins. After 
taking an average of 1 DDD of statins for a year, statin 
users had 0.21 more MMSE points (95% CI: 0.12; 0.32) 
compared  to  non-users.  There  was  a  dose-response 
effect.  After  3  years  of  taking  an  average  1  DDD  of 
statins,  statin-treated  patients  had  0.63  points  more 
MMSE  points  (95%  CI:  0.33;  0.94)  (Table  4,  Fig.  3). 
These  results  were  consistent  in  subgroup  analysis 
and  when  considering  imputed  missing  MMSE  values 
and  analysis  restricted  to  incident  users  (Supplemen-
tary table 6) and in subgroup analyses (Supplementary 
table 1). We conducted post hoc analyses stratifying by 
dementia  type  (Alzheimer  or  mixed  dementia;  results 
not shown) with similar results to those presented for 
the whole group.

Simvastatin users compared to atorvastatin users

Simvastatin  users  exhibited  a  slower  cognitive  decline 
over  time,  compared  to  atorvastatin  users  (0.35  more 
MMSE  points  per  year  of  follow-up,  95%  CI:  0.03;  0.67 
and 1.01 more MMSE points after 3 years, 95% CI: 0.06; 
1.97) (Table 4, Fig. 4).

When stratifying analyses for gender and age, the pro-
tective association for cognition of simvastatin compared 
to  atorvastatin,  was  only  statistically  significant  in  the 
participants  aged  <79.5  years  (which  was  the  mean  age 
of  the  total  sample).  Younger  users  of  simvastatin  had  a 
slower decline of MMSE (0.28 points more per year, 95% 
CI:  0.03;  0.54,  and  0.80  points  more  after  3  years,  95% 
CI:  0.05;  1.55)  compared  to  younger  atorvastatin  users 
(Table 5).

This  protective  association  was  statistically  signifi-
cant in multiple imputations of MMSE model but not in 
incident users (0.56 less MMSE points per year, 95% CI:

-1.13; 0.01) (Supplementary table 6). We conducted post 
hoc analyses stratifying by dementia type (Alzheimer or 
mixed  dementia):  in  mixed  dementia,  simvastatin  use 
was  associated  with  1.57  more  MMSE  points  MMSE  at 
3 years (95% CI 0.79; 2.34) while results were not signifi-
cant for the Alzheimer group (0.49 more points MMSE at 
3 years; 95% CI -0.76; 1.76).

Simvastatin users compared to rosuvastatin users

Simvastatin users had a slower MMSE decline, compared 
to  rosuvastatin  users  (0.35  more  MMSE  points  per  year 
of  follow-up,  95%  CI:  0.09;  0.61,  and  1.03  more  MMSE 
points after 3 years, 95% CI: 0.26; 1.80) (Table 4, Fig. 5).

In subgroup analysis, these results remained statistically 
significant in women and younger patients (Supplementary 
table 2).

The  associations  remained  protective  when  imputing 
missing  MMSE  values.  However,  incident  simvastatin 
users  had  a  faster  decline  of  MMSE  compared  to  inci-
dent rosuvastatin users (1.63 less MMSE points per year 
of  follow-up,  95%  CI:  -3.18;  -0.07  and  4.77  less  MMSE 

points after 3 years, 95% CI: -9.46; -0.07) (Supplementary 
table 6).

Lipophilic statin users compared to hydrophilic statin users

We did not find significant differences in MMSE decline 
in  lipophilic  statin  users  (simvastatin,  atorvastatin,  fluv-
astatin users) (Table 4) or when considering imputed val-
ues  of  missing  MMSE,  compared  to  hydrophilic  statins 
users  (rosuvastatin,  pravastatin  users).  However,  it  was 
faster  in  incident  users  of  lipophilic  statins  (1.32  less 
MMSE points per year, 95% CI: -2.46; -0.18), and 3.84 less 
points  after  3  years,  95%  CI:  -7.28;  -0.41),  compared  to 
hydrophilic statins (Supplementary table 6). These analy-
ses were not statistically significant in sub-analysis of age 
groups and sex (Supplementary table 3).

Fungal statin users compared to synthetic statin users

Use of fungal statins (simvastatin, pravastatin users) was 
not  associated  with  a  difference  in  MMSE  decline  com-
pared to synthetic statin users (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, 
fluvastatin  users)  (Table  4).  In  a  subgroup  analysis,  the

DDD is defined by the World Health Organization as the assumed average maintenance daily dose of a medication for its primary indication 
in adults. Yearly visit 1 represent the first MMSE measurement (baseline)

MMSE decline was slower in younger fungal statin users 
(0.26  more  points  per  year,  95%  CI:  0.03;  0.49,  and  0.73 
more  points  after  3  years,  95%  CI:  0.05;  1.42)  (Supple-
mentary  table  4).  However,  the  decline  was  faster  when 
analysing  only  incident  fungal  users,  compared  to  inci-
dent  synthetic  users  (0.61  points  less  per  year,  95%  CI: 
-1.19;  -0.04,  and  1.83  points  less  after  3  years,  95%  CI: 
-3.55; -0.12) (Supplementary table 6).

Non‑statin lipid‑lowering medication users compared 
to statin users

We  did  not  observe  a  significant  difference  in  MMSE 
decline  between  non-statin  lipid  lowering  medication 
users, compared to statin users (Table 4).

In  some  subgroup  analyses,  users  of  non-statin  lipid 
lowering  medication  had  a  slower  MMSE  decline  (Sup-
plementary table 5).

Discussion
In  this  longitudinal  Swedish  registries-based  observa-
tional study of patients with AD or mixed AD dementia, 
we  discovered  a  dose-dependent  cognitive  benefit  over 
time  in  statin  users  compared  to  non-users  of  statins. 
Additionally, we discovered a slower MMSE decline over 

time  in  patients  taking  simvastatin,  compared  to  either 
atorvastatin or rosuvastatin users. Younger users of simv-
astatin had a slower MMSE decline compared to younger 
atorvastatin  users.  We  did  not  observe  a  difference  in 
MMSE decline depending on lipophilicity. Incident users’ 
analysis  revealed  inconsistent  findings  which  could  be 
potentially  explained  with  time-dependant  non-linear 
association  between  effect  of  statins  on  cognitive  pro-
cesses or through differences and selection of these users.

Different statins

Simvastatin  was  the  most  used  statin  in  Sweden  when 
our  data  was  collected.  Accordingly,  this  makes  com-
parisons among different statins or groups difficult, often 
lacking  enough  power.  A  beneficial  role  of  simvastatin 
in  early  dementia  is  biologically  plausible,  when  there 
are  high  levels  of  neuroinflammation  as  this  lipophilic 
statin  readily  crosses  the  BBB  and  could  exert  various 
neuroprotective  properties,  such  as  protection  against 
tau  hyperphosphorylation  and  mediation  of  brain  cho-
lesterol  homeostasis  [18].  Research  on  animal  models 
of AD further support the beneficial effects of simvasta-
tin  on  cognition  through  different  mechanisms  [49,  50]. 
Clinical  trials  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  AD

reported  a  neutral  [35]  or  a  beneficial  effect  of  simvas-
tatin  [51],  using  MMSE  as  a  cognitive  outcome.  Find-
ings  were  limited  by  relatively  short  trial  duration  and 
low  number  of  participants  and  were  therefore  possibly 
underpowered.  To  our  best  knowledge,  our  study  is  the 
first  observational  study  to  compare  cognitive  decline 
between different statins in patients with established AD 
and mixed dementia. A careful adjustment for comedica-
tion in general and cholinesterase inhibitors in particular 

is important, as our group previously discovered a small 
long-term beneficial effect on cognition in AD and mixed 
dementia  patients  treated  with  cholinesterase  inhibitors 
[46].

In our study, the analysis including only incident users 
showed  an  opposite  association.  A  possible  explanation 
to  inconsistent  results  of  incident  user  design  may  be 
related to a temporally dependent biphasic effect of statin 
therapy  on  cholesterol  metabolites,  as  shown  in  a  study

Fig. 5  Cognitive decline, evaluated with change in MMSE scores over time, in simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin users. Linear mixed‑effects 
regression model, adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and co‑medication, with inverse probability weighting. Yearly visit 1 
represent the first MMSE measurement (baseline)

which included asymptomatic patients at risk of AD [52]. 
In this study, statins initially reduced cholesterol metab-
olites  in  the  cerebrospinal  fluid,  reaching  a  nadir  at  6–7 
months,  followed  by  a  return  to  baseline  and  an  over-
shoot at two years. Moreover, several differences between 
incident  users  compared  to  all  users  exist  which  could 
partly  contribute  to  the  discrepancies.  The  individual 
characteristics of incident users, such as baseline MMSE 
differences,  or  a  possible  selection  of  these  smaller 
groups of patients through individual physicians’ prefer-
ences,  might  have  influenced  their  cognitive  trajectories 
which could not be accounted for in adjusted models.

Lipophilicity and chemical characteristics (fungal 
or synthetic statins)

Several  biochemical  characteristics  of  statins  probably 
influence  the  functional  effects  of  statins  on  cholesterol 
metabolism  and  cognition.  Statins  with  a  higher  lipo-
philicity  (e.g.,  simvastatin,  atorvastatin,  fluvastatin)  may 
cross the BBB more easily compared to more hydrophilic 
statins  (rosuvastatin,  pravastatin)  [18].  Additionally,  the 
size  and  orientation  of  a  statin  molecule  may  influence 
the  BBB  permeability  of  statins  which  explained  a  low 

ability  of  a  lipophilic  atorvastatin  to  cross  the  BBB,  due 
to  its  large  size  [18].  In  our  study,  we  did  not  observe  a 
difference  in  cognitive  decline  when  comparing  users 
of  lipophilic  to  hydrophilic  statins  in  most  models  and 
subgroup  analyses.  However,  MMSE  decline  was  faster 
in  incident  users  of  lipophilic  statins.  Due  to  foremen-
tioned  Swedish  prescription  patterns,  the  comparisons 
in our study were driven by simvastatin and atorvastatin 
users compared to rosuvastatin users. To the best of our 
knowledge,  we  are  not  aware  of  another  observational 
study  which  compared  cognitive  decline  between  lipo-
philic and hydrophilic statin users in AD patients.

Fungal statins (simvastatin and pravastatin) differ from 
the synthetic statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvasta-
tin) in several functional characteristics. Synthetic statins 
were  shown  to  form  more  interactions  which  leads  to  a 
stronger inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and a higher 
potency  [53].  Moreover,  fungus-derived  statins  were 
observed to have a high permeability through the blood–
brain  barrier  and  cause  a  reduction  of  cholesterol  levels 
as well as lower a burden of neurofibrillary tangles in ani-
mal models [54]. In our study, this comparison between 
fungal  and  synthetic  statins  was  driven  by  simvastatin

and  atorvastatin  users,  so  this  classification  did  not  add 
further  information.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no 
previous  studies  compared  cognitive  decline  in  AD  or 
mixed  dementia  patients  among  fungal  and  synthetic 
statins.  A  recent  cohort  study  comparing  different  inci-
dent  statin  users  found  a  higher  risk  of  AD  in  fungal 
statins  compared  to  synthetic,  as  well  as  higher  risk  in 
lipophilic  statins  compared  to  hydrophilic  statins;  how-
ever, the risk was reduced in sensitivity analysis [55].

Non-statin lipid-lowering medications

The confidence intervals for this comparison were broad 
and  did  not  reach  statistical  significance.  However, 
MMSE decline was slower in some subgroups of non-sta-
tin lipid-lowering medications (men and younger users). 
Statins and other hypolipemics, such as gemfibrozil, rep-
resent  another  interesting  comparison  group  since  they 
are both prescribed for hyperlipidaemia, therefore dimin-
ishing indication bias, and could exhibit cognitive effects 
through different metabolic pathways. Gemfibrozil atten-
uated amyloid burden as well as neuroinflammation and 
improved  the  memory  in  AD  mouse  models  through 
activation of PPAR-alpha in a recent study [56], but our 
study was probably underpowered for this comparison.

Statin dose, potency, treatment length and time window 
for intervention

The  dose,  potency  or  duration  of  treatment  have  been 
recognized  as  important  factors  when  evaluating  the 
effects of statins on cognition. Most work has been done 
on  evaluating  these  factors  in  the  prevention  of  demen-
tia or AD [32, 33, 57]. A dose-response was observed in a 
large cohort study which included only AD patients [58]. 
In our study, a dose-effect was observed when comparing 
statin users and non-users. The prediction model showed 
a benefit after 3 years, which is an estimated brain cho-
lesterol  turnover  rate  in  adults,  but  most  of  the  data  in 
our cohort aggregates towards earlier follow-ups. A time 
window  of  intervention  with  statins  regarding  the  neu-
ropathogenesis  of  dementia,  or  life  course  of  a  patient, 
might  exist  as  the  neurodegenerative  pathological 
changes of AD begin decades prior to clinical symptoms 
[59]. The protective effect of statins could be achieved in 
a  long-term  amelioration  of  brain  vascular  burden,  res-
toration of disturbed central cholesterol homeostasis and 
neuroprotective  effects,  possibly  in  preclinical  [60]  or 
early stages of AD [61, 62].

Statin use compared to no use of statins

An  extensive  evaluation  of  the  possible  role  of  statins 
in  preventing  dementia  has  been  performed  in  the  last 
two  decades  [25,  26,  32,  33,  41,  63–65]  but  comparably 
less  studies  included  patients  with  already  established 

AD  [25,  31,  38–41,  64].  Clinical  trials  of  statin  use  in 
AD  patients  did  not  report  a  clear  benefit  to  ameliorate 
cognitive decline [38, 40, 64]. Observational cohort stud-
ies of patients with AD and a various follow-up ranging 
from 10 months to over 10 years, reported a slower [61, 
66–68]  or  similar  [69]  cognitive  decline  in  statins  users 
compared to non-users. Findings from our analysis com-
paring statin use to no use which imply a possible dose-
dependent beneficial role of statins in patients with AD is 
in accord with many of these previous studies. However, 
comparing  statin  users  and  no-users  introduces  several 
important biases.

Importantly, hyperlipidaemia is an indication for statin 
use  in  midlife  and  represents  a  risk  factor  for  dementia 
and AD. On the other hand, low cholesterol level in late 
life  has  been  recognized  as  a  measure  of  frailty  or  pro-
dromal  stage  of  dementia,  particularly  AD  [70].  These 
facts  can  lead  an  indication  bias  when  comparing  users 
to  non-users.  Secondly,  clinicians  might  be  less  likely  to 
prescribe  statins  to  older  patients,  especially  those  with 
pre-existing  cognitive  decline,  frailty,  or  comorbidities 
since the risk of possible side effects and diminished life 
expectancy outweighs the benefit of medication. Further-
more, cognitive impairment could lead to a discontinua-
tion of statins or drop-out from study, which would lead 
to  a  false  beneficial  association  [41,  71].  Older  patients 
who receive statins for their hypercholesterolemia could 
naturally possess a lower risk of dementia or reflect a bet-
ter cognitive trajectory [72], leading to reverse causation.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths and limitations. We can 
report associations but are not able to draw the conclu-
sions  on  causality.  This  study  was  meant  as  an  explora-
tory analysis which requires confirmation. We considered 
a variety of comorbidities and comedications in our mod-
els;  however,  a  few  important  covariates  were  not  avail-
able  for  our  analysis,  such  as  cholesterol  levels,  ApoE 
status  and  possible  genetic  polymorphisms  specific  for 
different  populations  [73].  However,  we  addressed  this 
issue  with  a  selection  of  a  population  with  indication 
for treatment and used multivariate adjusting to balance 
the differences between the groups as well as performed 
several sensitivity analyses. Patient adherence to medica-
tion  was  indirectly  assumed  based  on  the  dispensation 
of  medication  at  pharmacies.  There  was  a  considerable 
number  of  drop-out  participants  and  missing  values  on 
MMSE. MMSE was the only measure of cognitive decline 
in our study and is less robust to detect cognitive changes 
in different cognitive domains. We chose to only include 
observed  MMSE  scores  in  the  analyses  to  limit  the  risk 
of  creating  false  data  with  imputation  but  there  is,  of 
course,  a  risk  of  selection  bias.  We  restricted  the  study

population  to  those  individuals  with  drug  use  at  index 
date  to  ensure  that  we  can  follow  a  statin  user’s  cogni-
tive  decline  from  the  beginning.  The  results  from  the 
sensitivity  analyses  considering  multiple  imputations  of 
MMSE are in line with our main findings and confirmed 
our choices. However, the results of analysis on incident 
users  were  not  consistent.  Another  important  strength 
of our study lies in carefully selected statistical methods. 
Use of linear mixed modelling with multiple imputation 
is  currently  regarded  as  a  superior  method  to  account 
for  the  attrition  bias  [72].  We  considered  a  reasonably 
long follow-up and performed a large, population-based 
study. We examined the use of statins before dementia to 
explore the reverse causality of cognition influencing the 
adherence or use of statin but cannot completely exclude 
this problem with our current methods.

Conclusions
Our  population-based  exploratory  cohort  study  of 
patients  with  AD  or  mixed  dementia  adds  to  a  grow-
ing body of evidence that statins are not detrimental for 
cognition.  Moreover,  statins  might  exhibit  a  long-term 
cognitive  benefit  these  patients  who  have  indication  for 
lipid-lowering  treatment.  However,  our  findings  war-
rant  a  confirmational  study.  We  believe  that  our  find-
ings should further encourage clinicians to select eligible 
patients  with  dementia  to  benefit  from  prevention  of 
their  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  disease  with 
statins.  Further  research  of  the  pathogenesis  of  demen-
tia is warranted. Acknowledging dementia as a complex, 
multifactorial  syndrome  where  different  pathogenic 
processes  and  risk  factors  are  at  play  at  different  stages 
of  dementia,  it  would  be  plausible  to  examine  the  com-
bined  effects  of  several  medications  affecting  different 
metabolic  pathways  in  well-defined  subtypes  of  demen-
tia. Moreover, the role of lipid metabolism dysregulation 
to  the  pathogenesis  of  AD  should  be  further  explored, 
taking  the  genetic  factors  into  consideration.  Further 
research is needed to decipher the non-consistent results 
in  incident  statin  users,  where  time  since  prescription 
may be an important factor.
