Abstract

This review of controlled studies of marital and family therapy (MFT) in alcoholism treatment
updates our earlier review (XXXXXXX). We conclude that, when the alcoholic is unwilling to
seek help, MFT is effective in helping the family cope better and motivating alcoholics to enter
treatment. Specifically, both Al-Anon facilitation and referral and spouse coping skills training
(based on new findings) help family members cope better; and Community Reinforcement and
Family Training (CRAFT) promotes treatment entry and was successfully transported to a
community clinic in a new study. Once the alcoholic enters treatment, MFT, particularly
behavioral couples therapy (BCT), is clearly more effective than individual treatment at increasing
abstinence and improving relationship functioning. New BCT studies showed efficacy with
women alcoholics and with gay and lesbian alcoholics; and BCT was successfully transported to a
community clinic, a brief BCT version was tested, and BCT was adapted for family members
other than spouses. Future studies should evaluate: MFT with couples where both members have a
current alcohol problem and with minority patients, mechanisms of change, transportability of
evidence-based MFT approaches to clinical practice settings, and replication of MFT outcomes of
reduced partner violence and improved child functioning.

INTRODUCTION

Over 35 years ago the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)
hailed marital and family therapy as “one of the most outstanding current advances in the
area of psychotherapy of alcoholism” (Keller, 1974, p. 161). This NIAAA report also called
for controlled studies to test these promising methods.

In 1976, Steinglass (1976) reviewed family treatment studies reported between 1950 to
1975. He concluded that there were few such studies, very little evidence demonstrating the
efficacy of family treatment, and significant methodological shortcomings in most studies.

In 1989, McCrady (1989) in her update to Steinglass’s earlier review concluded that there
was still a paucity of well-controlled research in this area. McCrady noted that clinically
popular family disease and family systems approaches had little or no empirical support, and
that behavioral approaches which had relatively more empirical support were virtually
unused in clinical practice.

In 1995, reviewing studies between 1972 to 1993, Edwards and Steinglass (1995) concluded
that family therapy was effective in motivating alcoholics to enter treatment, marginally
more effective than individual alcoholism treatment once the drinker had sought help, and
modestly beneficial in supporting aftercare and relapse prevention. They found no data on

cost-effectiveness of family treatment or on the impact of gender of the alcoholic patient in
that studies included mostly male patients.

In 2003, O’Farrell and Fals-Stewart (2003) presented a comprehensive review through
mid-2002 of 38 controlled studies of marital and family therapy (MFT) in alcoholism
treatment. They concluded that, when the alcoholic is unwilling to seek help, Al-Anon
facilitation and referral help family members cope better; and Community Reinforcement
and Family Training promotes treatment entry but the Johnson intervention does not. They
also concluded that once the alcoholic enters treatment, MFT, particularly behavioral
couples therapy (BCT), is clearly more effective than individual treatment at increasing
abstinence and improving relationship functioning. Finally, they called for future studies of
MFT with women and with minority patients, mechanisms and processes of change, and
transportability of evidence-based MFT approaches to clinical settings.

This paper reviews studies of the effectiveness of MFT in alcoholism treatment. It updates
the O’Farrell and Fals-Stewart (2003) review (referred to below as “the 2003 review”). It
covers studies reported between 2002 and mid-2010 that compared MFT with one or more
comparison conditions.

This paper presents study results of MFT for two main stages of change to (a) improve
family coping and/or initiate change when the alcoholic individual is unwilling to seek help
or (b) aid the alcoholic’s recovery once the individual has sought help. We also discuss the
current status of issues raised by the earlier reviews and suggest future directions for
research. Finally, we consider the implications of outcome research for clinical practice by
marriage and family therapists and summarize our final conclusions.

Potentially relevant studies were identified in several ways: (a) searching bibliographies of
prior review articles (Powers, Vedell, & Emmelkamp, 2008; Stanton, 2004; Velleman,
Templeton & Copello, 2005): (b) performing database searches through April 2010 of
PsycINFO, Current Contents, Social Sciences Citation Index, PUBMED, Project CORK,
ETOH, and Dissertation Abstracts Online; and (c) searching the bibliographies of all articles
identified by the first two steps.

Studies were included in this review if they met the following criteria. First, studies had to
evaluate one or more treatment groups, in which spouses and/or other family members of an
alcoholic adult were involved in treatment efforts to (a) improve family coping and/or
initiate change when the alcoholic individual was unwilling to seek help or (b) aid the
alcoholic’s recovery once the individual had sought help. Second, studies had to include a
comparison group, either a wait-list control group, an individually-based treatment without a
family-involved component, or an alternative family treatment method. Third, in most
studies cases were randomly assigned to treatment and comparison conditions, but as with
prior reviews, a few quasi-experimental studies without random assignment were included.
Finally, we required objective outcome data in one or more of five categories: (1) alcohol
consumption or alcohol-related problems by the alcoholic person, (2) alcoholism treatment
entry or attendance, (3) couple or family adjustment, (4) individual adjustment for the
alcoholic person (i.e., unrelated to alcohol use), and (5) individual adjustment for the spouse
or other family member.

In describing study results below, unless stated otherwise, outcomes described as favoring a
treatment over a comparison group mean that the difference between the treatment and
comparison groups reached statistical significance in the original study. Similarly, outcomes
described as showing improvement from before to some time point after treatment mean that
the difference between the outcome scores before and after treatment reached statistical
significance in the original study.

HELPING THE FAMILY AND INITIATING CHANGE WHEN THE ALCOHOLIC

RESISTS TREATMENT

The studies reviewed in this section evaluated treatment in which spouses or other family
members of an alcoholic adult took part in efforts to (a) improve family members’ coping
and well-being or (b) initiate change when the alcoholic individual was unwilling to seek
help.

Helping the Family

Spouses and other family members often experience many stressors and heightened
emotional distress caused by the negative consequences of the alcoholic’s drinking. Two
approaches try to help family members cope with their emotional distress and concentrate on
their own motivations for change rather than trying to motivate the drinker to change. These
are efforts to help the family member use the concepts and resources of Al-Anon, or to teach
specific coping skills to deal with alcohol-related situations involving the drinker.

Al-Anon and the Twelve-step Family Disease Approach—This twelve-step
program is the most widely used source of support for family members troubled by a loved
one’s alcohol problem. Al-Anon advocates that family members detach themselves from the
alcoholic’s drinking in a loving way, accept they are powerless to control the alcoholic, and
seek support from other Al-Anon members (Al-Anon Family Groups, 1981).

The first controlled studies of the 12-step family disease approach were a major
development cited by the 2003 review. These studies showed improvement in concerned
others’ functioning following Al-Anon Facilitation Therapy (AFT; Nowinski, 1999) or
referral to Al-Anon that was greater than in a waitlist control group (Dittrich & Trapold,
1984; Barber & Gilbertson, 1996; Rychtarik & McGillicuddy, 1998) and equivalent to other
family-involved treatments (Rychtarik & McGillicuddy, 1998; Miller, Myers, & Tonigan,
1999). No new studies of the Al-Anon twelve-step family disease approach have been done
since the 2003 review.

Coping Skills Therapy—Zetterlind, Hansson, Aberg-Orbeck and Berglund (2001)
randomly assigned 39 spouses of alcoholics who were not in treatment to coping skills
therapy, group support, or a one-session information only control group. Results at 12-
month follow-up (cited in the 2003 review) showed that spouses in all 3 groups had reduced
emotional distress and improved coping strategies; and that spouses who got coping skills
therapy and group support had greater decreases in emotional distress than did the
information only control group. Results at 24-month follow-up (Hansson, Zetterlind, Åberg-
Örbeck & Berglund, 2004) indicated that improvements at 12-month follow-up were
maintained at 24-months. However, the 3 groups had similar outcomes at 24 months.
Spouses above the Swedish mean on emotional distress at baseline showed less
improvement in the information group than in the two therapy groups combined.

Rychtarik and McGillicuddy (2005) published complete results of a study that had been
cited in the 2003 review based on conference presentations (Rychtarik & McGillicuddy,
1998, 2002). This study randomly assigned 171 women with male alcoholic partners who
were not in treatment to manual-guided coping skill training, a manual-guided Al-Anon
facilitation program, or a waiting-list control group. Follow-up assessments were conducted
post-treatment, and 6 and 12 months post-treatment. On a role-play observational measure
of coping skills, skill training therapy was better than Al-Anon facilitation and both
treatment groups were better than the wait-list control. Spouses in both treatment groups
reported less depression and anxiety than those in the wait-list control. Partner drinking

decreased from pretreatment to follow-up in both of the active treatment conditions.
However, for partners with a history of relationship violence, drinking improved in the
coping skills treatment condition but worsened in the Al-Anon facilitation condition.
Finally, spouses who got coping skills therapy received less violence from their male
partners in the year after treatment than did women who got Al-Anon facilitation therapy.
Thus, coping skills training may be particularly beneficial for women experiencing physical
violence from a partner with alcohol dependence.

Copello et al. (2009) studied a primary care intervention for family members affected by the
alcohol or drug problem of a close relative. They randomized 143 family members to
receive a full or brief version of a manualized intervention based on the stress-strain-coping-
support model of addiction and the family (Orford et al., 1998). The full intervention had a
self-help manual plus 5 individual sessions to help the family member identify sources of
stress, provide information about substances, explore coping behaviors, and consider and
enhance social support. The brief version had one session with the provider who introduced
the therapy and provided the self-help manual. Brief and full intervention groups both
improved significantly in psychological symptoms and coping behaviors from baseline to 12
weeks later, but the two interventions did not differ significantly on symptom or coping
outcomes. The authors concluded that a self-help manual delivered by a primary care
professional may be as effective for family members as several face-to-face sessions with
the professional.

Other Approaches to Helping the Family—Son & Choi (2010), noting the difficulty
Koreans have in expressing anger, developed a manualized cognitive-behavioral anger
management treatment to promote anger expression and anger management for family
members of patients with alcohol use disorders. They systematically (but not randomly)
assigned 39 family members to receive anger management and 24 to a control group. Pre-
post scores on the Korean Anger Expression Inventory indicated that family members who
received the anger management program improved more in healthy anger expression than
those in the control group.

An Australian study (Halford, Price, Kelly, Bouma & Young, 2001) randomly assigned
61women whose husbands drank heavily but were not currently in alcohol treatment to (a)
supportive counseling, (b) stress management, or (c) alcohol-focused couple therapy
(AFCT) plus stress management. Wives’ reports of their own stress, their husbands’ alcohol
consumption, and relationship functioning were assessed at pre- and post-treatment and at 6-
month follow-up. All three treatments showed a reduction in women’s stress, with trends for
somewhat greater stress reduction in stress management and AFCT than in supportive
counseling. None of the treatments produced clinically significant improvements in men’s
drinking or couples’ relationship functioning. The authors caution that their study may have
had inadequate statistical power. They also note that only 6 of 21 women assigned to AFCT
actually engaged their husband in couple therapy and these 6 couples completed and
benefited from their therapy. This is not surprising, given that AFCT is usually studied when
the alcoholic has already sought help, not as a method for engaging treatment resistant
alcoholics.

Initiating Change in the Alcoholic

The 2003 review examined 4 methods with a primary goal of initiating change in the
treatment resistant alcoholic in addition to helping the spouse or family member cope better.
These include Unilateral Family Therapy, the Johnson Institute Intervention, Pressure to
Change, and Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT).

Unilateral Family Therapy—Unilateral Family Therapy (UFT; Thomas et al, 1993) as
reviewed in 2003 had limited empirical support, an extended 6-month course, and no
treatment manual available. As such, UFT was judged not ready for replication or
widespread use. No new studies of UFT have been done since the 2003 review.

Johnson Institute Intervention—The Johnson Institute Intervention, the popular family
confrontation approach (Johnson, 1986), as reviewed in 2003 had shown a treatment
engagement rate of 25–30% in 2 studies (Liepman et al, 1989; Miller et al, 1999). The
reason for these disappointing findings is that most families who started the intervention
process did not go through with the family confrontation meeting. The 2003 review
suggested that until data show that this confrontational approach is effective in motivating
treatment entry, treatment programs should consider using more effective alternative
methods (see CRAFT below). No new studies of the Intervention approach have been done
since the 2003 review.

Pressure to Change—The Pressure to Change approach, as reviewed in 2003, did better
than wait-list control on initiating change in the drinker in 3 small randomized trials (Barber
& Crisp, 1995; Barber & Gilbertson, 1996, 1998). However, the modest rate of treatment
entry (31% across the 3 studies) is less than half of that obtained in the CRAFT studies. No
new studies of this approach have been done since the 2003 review.

Community Reinforcement and Family Training—Community Reinforcement and
Family Training (CRAFT; Smith & Meyers, 2004), as reviewed in 2003, had the strongest
evidence base of methods to initiate change. Across 4 randomized trials (2 for alcoholics and
2 for drug abusers - Kirby et al. 1999; Meyers et al. 2002; Miller et al. 1999; Sisson & Azrin
1986), the average treatment engagement rate for CRAFT was 68% (range from 59%–86%)
which was significantly and substantially higher than comparison groups of Al-Anon
Facilitation Therapy or Al-Anon referral (0%–29%) or the Johnson intervention (22%).
Thus, CRAFT was judged to be a more effective alternative to engage substance abusers in
treatment than popular confrontational or detachment approaches.

One new study of the CRAFT approach has been done since the 2003 review. The Santa Fe
County CRAFT Project (Dutcher et al., 2009) examined whether CRAFT could be
successfully transferred from a controlled research setting to a community treatment center.
Their study included liberal participant selection criteria and a wide range of family
members, including a majority of mothers and spouses. Engagement rates of 55% – 65%
were similar to those found in previous controlled studies suggesting that CRAFT could be
successfully transferred to a community treatment agency.

Conclusions About MFT When the Alcoholic Is Unwilling to Seek Help

In terms of MFT to help the family when the alcoholic is unwilling to seek help, more
studies of various methods to increase coping skills of family members have appeared since
the 2003 review. These include more complete results (Hannson et al, 2004; Rychtarik &
McGillicuddy, 2005) of 2 earlier studies along with 3 new studies (Copello et al, 2009;
Halford et al, 2001; Son & Choi, 2010).

A major development at the time of the 2003 review was the first controlled studies of the
12-step family disease approach showing improvement in concerned others’ individual
functioning after Al-Anon Facilitation (AFT) or referral to Al-Anon. Although no further
studies of Al-Anon have appeared since the earlier review, more complete results of the
Rychtarik study (Rychtarik & McGillicuddy, 2005) suggest that AFT may be less effective
than coping skills training when intimate partner violence (IPV) is involved. Specifically,

coping skills therapy led to less IPV than AFT in the year after treatment; and for spouses
with a history of IPV, husbands’ drinking improved in coping skills and worsened in AFT.
Given the widespread use of AFT and Al-Anon, and the 50–65% past year prevalence of
IPV among alcoholics (Stuart, O’Farrell & Temple, 2009), more research is needed to
replicate potential differential effects of AFT and coping skills therapy when IPV is
involved.

Similar to conclusions drawn in the 2003 review, all the MFT methods studied to date to
help the family of the treatment resistant alcoholic have resulted in reduced emotional
distress in the concerned others relative to baseline or a waitlist control group. At this time,
stronger evidence is needed before we can conclude in favor of a particular approach.
However, we can suggest the 3 approaches that seem most promising. All are manualized.
All are products of careful development within a consistent, well-established conceptual
framework. All have promising efficacy evidence in at least one controlled study. All need
further research and clinical application. The first is Rychtarik’s coping skills therapy. The
second is Al-Anon Facilitation and referral to Al-Anon. The third is the 5-step coping skills
intervention developed by Copello, Orford and their colleagues in the UK (Copello et al.,
2009) for use in primary care settings.

In terms of MFT to initiate change when the alcoholic is unwilling to seek help, only one
new study has appeared since the 2003 review. This is the CRAFT implementation study
(Dutcher et al., 2009) which showed treatment engagement rates for CRAFT in a
community treatment setting were comparable to those obtained in earlier well-controlled
trials. This study supports CRAFT as a successful intervention for community-based use by
a wide range of clinical providers. Consistent with conclusions from the 2003 review,
continued research supports CRAFT as an effective method to engage alcoholics in
treatment that is preferable to confrontational or detachment approaches. Replication of
Dutcher et al.’s research is needed, but their initial study suggests that dissemination of
CRAFT to community facilities is possible.

No new research on the Johnson Institute Intervention has appeared since the 2003 review.
Therefore, consistent with conclusions of the 2003 review, we suggest that until data show
that this confrontational approach is effective in motivating treatment entry, treatment
programs should consider using more effective methods such as CRAFT. A Relational
Sequence for Engagement (ARISE), an alternative method developed to overcome problems
with the Intervention, has shown promise (Landau et al., 2004) but controlled studies are
needed.

MFT TO AID RECOVERY WHEN THE ALCOHOLIC HAS SOUGHT HELP

The studies reviewed in this section evaluated treatment in which spouses or other family
members of an alcoholic adult were involved in treatment efforts to aid the alcoholic’s
recovery and help the family after the alcoholic had sought treatment. As with the 2003
review, this section will focus on Behavioral Couples Therapy, Family Systems Therapy,
and other MFT approaches. Building on the 2003 review, we examined whether new studies
have addressed the recommendation of the earlier review. Specifically recommended were
(a) studies evaluating MFT with a broader group of patients including women and minority
patients, (b) studies of the transportability of evidence-based MFT approaches to clinical
practice settings, and (c) studies of mechanisms and processes of change underlying MFT.
We also examined new MFT studies that used expanded outcome domains (e.g., IPV, child
functioning) as well as other studies including those with “negative results” showing MFT
outcomes were not superior to comparison group outcomes.

Behavioral Couples Therapy

Behavioral couples therapy (BCT) sees the alcoholic patient together with the spouse or
cohabiting partner to build support for abstinence and to improve relationship functioning.
BCT assumes that spouses can reward abstinence, and that alcoholic patients from happier,
more cohesive relationships with better communication have a lower risk of relapse. BCT
has two main components: alcohol-focused interventions to directly build support for
abstinence; and relationship-focused interventions to increase positive feelings, shared
activities, and constructive communication. Two main BCT programs guide much of current
research on BCT. The 2 BCT programs differ in their alcohol-focused interventions but are
fairly similar in relationship-focused methods.

McCrady’s Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy (ABCT) program uses a method called
“alcohol-focused spouse involvement” (McCrady & Epstein, 2008; Noel & McCrady,
1993). It involves teaching the spouse specific skills to deal with alcohol-related situations.
The spouse is taught how to reinforce abstinence, decrease behaviors that trigger drinking,
decrease behaviors that protect the alcoholic from naturally occurring adverse consequences
of drinking, assertively discuss concerns about drinking-related situations, and respond to
help the drinker in drink refusal situations

The Counseling for Alcoholics’ Marriages (CALM) Project BCT program (O’Farrell, 1993;
O’Farrell & Fals-Stewart, 2006) uses a “recovery contract” as the main alcohol-focused
method. In the CALM BCT recovery contract, the couple completes a daily “trust
discussion” in which the patient states an intent to stay abstinent that day (in the tradition of
one day at a time). The couple agrees not to discuss drinking or drug use at other times, to
mark that they had the discussion on a calendar provided, and to end it with a statement of
appreciation to each other. If disulfiram or another medication is part of the contract, it is
taken during the trust discussion. If the recovery contract includes 12-step meetings, urine
screens or other recovery supports, these also are marked on the calendar.

Evaluating BCT With A Broader Group of Patients

BCT with women alcoholic patients: Four studies of BCT with women alcoholic patients
have appeared since the 2003 review at which time there were no such studies. McCrady
and colleagues (McCrady, Epstein, Cook, Jensen & Hildebrandt, 2009) randomized 102
heterosexual alcoholic women to McCrady’s alcohol behavioral couple therapy (ABCT)
program or to alcohol behavioral individual therapy (ABIT). During 6 months of treatment,
women increased their percentage of days abstinent and decreased their percentage of days
of heavy drinking, with significantly greater improvements in ABCT than in ABIT.
Differences favoring ABCT were maintained during the 12-month follow-up.

Fals-Stewart and colleagues (Fals-Stewart, Birchler & Kelley, 2006) randomized married or
cohabiting female alcoholic patients (n = 138) and their non-substance-abusing male
partners to 1 of 3 equally intensive interventions: (a) the CALM BCT program plus
individual-based treatment (BCT), (b) individual-based treatment only (IBT), or (c)
psychoeducational attention control treatment (PACT). During treatment, groups did not
differ on drinking frequency, but BCT showed significantly more improvement in dyadic
adjustment than IBT or PACT. During the 1-year follow-up, compared with those who
received IBT or PACT, BCT had (a) fewer days of drinking, (b) fewer drinking-related
negative consequences, (c) higher dyadic adjustment, and (d) reduced partner violence.

Schumm and colleagues (Schumm, O’Farrell & Muchowski, 2008) randomized married or
cohabiting female alcoholic patients and their non-substance-abusing male partners to either
of two equally intensive interventions: (a) the CALM BCT program plus individual-based
treatment (BCT), or (b) individual-based treatment only (IBT). Results for 41 women to date

from this study in progress support the superiority of BCT over IBT. These preliminary
results showed that women who received BCT maintained their abstinence during the 1-year
follow-up better than those who received IBT.

Schumm and colleagues (Schumm, O’Farrell, Murphy & Fals-Stewart, 2009) conducted a
naturalistic study of IPV before and in the first and second year after the CALM BCT
program with disulfiram for 103 married or cohabiting alcoholic women, and used a
demographically matched non-alcoholic comparison sample. IPV prevalence decreased
significantly from 68% in the year before to 31% in the year after BCT, and remitted
patients had 22% IPV prevalence which did not differ from the comparison sample. Results
for the second year after BCT were similar to the first year. Thus IPV decreased after BCT,
with remitted patients showing IPV reductions to the level of a non-alcoholic comparison
sample. These findings replicate previous research among men with alcoholism.

Finally, when treating women alcoholic patients, as high as 40–60% of them may have a
male partner with an alcohol or substance problem. These dual problem couples in which
both the male and female member have a current alcohol or other substance use problem
have typically been excluded from studies of BCT which relies heavily on support for
abstinence from the partner. Two recent BCT studies have included some dual problem
couples. First, in the McCrady et al (2009) study of BCT with women alcoholic patients
reviewed above, 13% of the sample had male partners with a current alcohol use disorder.
Given the small numbers, the impact of dual problem status on outcome was not examined.
Second, O’Farrell et al (2008) included a select group of dual problem couples in which
both members agreed to work together in BCT to pursue a goal of mutual abstinence.
Results showed similar positive outcomes in terms of days abstinent for these dual problem
couples in which both members wanted to change as for couples with only one alcoholic
member. However, both of these studies had a very small number of select, presumably
highly motivated male partners in the dual problem couples. Thus, studies are needed to test
the efficacy of BCT with dual problem couples.

BCT with gay and lesbian alcoholic patients: Fals-Stewart and colleagues (Fals-Stewart,
O’Farrell & Lam, 2009) randomized gay (n = 52) and lesbian (n = 48) patients with alcohol
use disorder (AUD) and their non-substance-abusing same-sex relationship partners to
equally intensive interventions consisting of (a) the CALM BCT program (BCT) plus
individual-based treatment (IBT) or (b) IBT only. This study reported two separate trials,
one with gay male participants and one with lesbian female participants. For both gay and
lesbian patients with AUD, those who received BCT had a significantly lower percentage of
heavy drinking days during the year after treatment than patients who received IBT only. In
addition, both gay and lesbian couples who received BCT reported higher levels of
relationship adjustment at the end of treatment and in the year after treatment than those who
received IBT only. Thus, the response of gay and lesbian couples with an alcoholic member
to BCT was consistent with what has been observed with heterosexual couples.

BCT for male alcoholic veterans with comorbid combat-related PTSD: Rotunda and
colleagues (Rotunda, O’Farrell, Murphy & Babey, 2008) compared outcomes after the
CALM BCT program with disulfiram for 19 dually-diagnosed patients with combat-related
PTSD and a substance use disorder (SUD, primarily alcohol dependence) and 19 patients
with SUD only. Both PTSD and non-PTSD patients showed good compliance with BCT,
attending a high number of BCT sessions, taking disulfiram, and going to AA. Finally, both
PTSD and non-PTSD groups improved from before BCT to immediately after and 12-
months after BCT showing increased relationship satisfaction and reduced drinking. Extent
and pattern of improvement over time were similar whether the patient had PTSD or not.
Although the sample size is quite small and the study is not a randomized trial, the present

results suggest that BCT may have promise in treating patients with comorbid SUD and
combat-related PTSD.

Increasing Transportability of BCT To Clinical Practice Settings—The 2003
review recommended studies of the transportability of evidence-based MFT approaches to
clinical practice settings. BCT has a relatively strong evidence base among MFT approaches
for treating alcoholism, but in 2003 no studies of transporting or disseminating BCT had
appeared. This section describes an initial study which has successfully implemented BCT.
We also have included in this section studies that, while not directly examining the
dissemination process, attempt to overcome barriers to dissemination and implementation by
decreasing cost to deliver BCT, expanding the pool of patients suitable for BCT, and
developing new uses for BCT.

BCT implementation and dissemination: O’Farrell, Richard and el-Guebaly (2010)
successfully transported the CALM BCT program from Boston where it has been researched
to a community clinic in Calgary. On-site BCT training in Calgary was followed by
telephone consultations biweekly for 6 months. A quasi-experimental evaluation compared
outcomes of (a) 38 alcoholic patients who received BCT plus Treatment-as-Usual (TAU)
with (b) 33 alcoholic patients who received TAU only. The latter group were referred to the
BCT program but did not enter it due to logistics or refusal. At baseline the 2 groups were
quite similar on demographics, substance use, relationship problems, and extent of comorbid
mood or anxiety diagnoses. Results at 6-months follow-up showed patients treated in BCT,
when compared to patients who got TAU only, had significantly more time abstinent from
alcohol and drugs, higher scores on the Global Assessment of Relationship Functioning
scale, and greater likelihood of staying together rather than being separated. Implementation
of BCT was considered successful because BCT had better outcomes than individual-based
TAU as expected from controlled trials of BCT, and because the BCT program in Calgary
that began in 1998 continues to the present.

Brief BCT – brief treatment and cost-effectiveness: Fals-Stewart and colleagues (Fals-
Stewart, Klostermann, Yates, O’Farrell & Birchler, 2005) examined the clinical efficacy and
cost-effectiveness of 6-session brief relationship therapy (BRT), a shortened version of 12-
session standard BCT (S-BCT), with alcoholic male patients (N = 100) and their
nonsubstance-abusing female partners. Participants were randomized to: (a) BRT, (b) S-
BCT, (c) individual-based treatment (IBT), or (d) psycho-educational attention control
treatment (PACT). S-BCT and BRT patients had equivalent post-treatment and 12-month
follow-up heavy drinking outcomes. At 12-month follow-up, heavy drinking and dyadic
adjustment outcomes for BRT patients were superior to those of patients who received IBT
or PACT. BRT was significantly more cost effective than S-BCT because BRT produced
equivalent outcomes to S-BCT at lower cost.

Behavioral family counseling – BCT for non-spousal dyads: Many patients live with a
family member other than a spouse. To expand the pool of patients suitable for BCT,
O’Farrell and colleagues developed a Behavioral Family Counseling (BFC) intervention
based on the CALM BCT program (O’Farrell, Murphy, Alter & Fals-Stewart, 2010). They
randomized substance-dependent (mostly alcoholic) patients (N=29) living with an adult
family member other than a spouse to equally intensive treatments consisting of either (a)
BFC plus IBT or (b) IBT alone. BFC patients remained in treatment significantly longer
than IBT patients. BFC patients improved significantly from baseline to 3- and 6-month
follow-up on all outcomes studied, and had a medium effect size reflecting better primary
outcomes of increased abstinence and reduced substance use than IBT patients. These pilot

study results show BFC is a promising method that merits further study in larger scale,
controlled trials.

BCT to promote aftercare: Recent work on new uses for BCT was based on earlier
successful use of a behavioral contract with a family member to reinforce aftercare
attendance (Ahles, Schlundt, Prue & Rychtarik, 1983; Ossip-Klein, Vanlandingham, Prue &
Rychtarik, 1984). O’Farrell and colleagues (O’Farrell, Murphy, Alter & Fals-Stewart, 2007,
2008a, 2008b) developed a brief family treatment (BFT) intervention for alcoholic patients
in inpatient detoxification to promote aftercare treatment post-detox. BFT consisted of
meeting with the patient and a family member with whom the patient lived to review
aftercare plans for the patient. A phone conference was used when logistics prevented an in-
person family meeting. Results showed that BFT patients were more likely than comparison
group patients to enter a continuing care program after detoxification in a quasi-
experimental (O’Farrell et al, 2007) and in a randomized study (O’Farrell et al., 2008a).

O’Farrell et al. (2008b) successfully transferred BFT to routine clinical practice after their
research project ended. They trained a newly hired staff person to continue providing BFT.
By monitoring key process benchmarks derived from the earlier research studies to ensure
ongoing fidelity in delivering BFT, they ensured that a high proportion of patients had their
families contacted and included in planning the patients’ aftercare.

Mechanisms and Processes of Change Underlying BCT—The 2003 review
recommended studies of mechanisms and processes of change underlying MFT because
such studies had not appeared at the time of the earlier review. Thus, despite the fairly
robust literature on the efficacy of MFT (especially BCT) in alcoholism treatment, little was
known about the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of BCT. Only limited progress
has been made on this front. Conceptualizations of the possible mechanisms and two
preliminary studies addressing this topic have appeared.

Conceptualizations of mechanisms of change underlying BCT: McCrady et al. (2009)
described three major mechanisms for BCT’s positive impact on drinking and relationship
outcomes. First, BCT produces increases in the reinforcing qualities of the relationship that
may provide greater incentives for continued abstinence. Second, BCT leads to greater
partner support for change efforts. Third, improved conjoint problem solving around
alcohol-related and other life problems may lead to improved outcomes.

Similar ideas come from a meta-analysis of controlled studies comparing BCT with IBT for
alcoholic couples (Powers et al., 2008). BCT was superior to IBT on relationship adjustment
at the end of treatment and at each time point thereafter during the follow-up period. On
drinking outcomes, BCT and IBT did not differ at the end of treatment (with both treatments
showing substantial improvement), but BCT did have more days abstinent at time points
thereafter during the follow-up period. Powers et al concluded that “BCT appears to
improve relationship satisfaction first that later leads to reduced drinking and drug use” (p.
961), thus explicating a potential theoretical mechanism of action of BCT, namely,
improved relationship functioning. By reducing relationship distress (which is viewed as a
major contributor to substance use and relapse) and promoting relationship behaviors
conducive to abstinence (e.g., daily trust discussion, partner encouraging AA attendance),
BCT builds relationship support for substance use reduction (O’Farrell & Fals-Stewart,
2006).

Preliminary studies of mechanisms of change underlying BCT: McCrady and colleagues
(McCrady, Hayaki, Epstein & Hirsch, 2002) tested hypothesized predictors of change in
BCT treatment for 68 male alcoholics. Results supported the hypothesized importance of

relationship functioning in drinking outcomes after BCT. In the 6 months after treatment,
men’s ability to remain abstinent was predicted by the quality of the pretreatment marital
relationship, and the intensity of their drinking (i.e., drinks per drinking day) was predicted
by the degree of their marital happiness immediately after treatment. Further, greater use of
relationship-related skills during BCT was associated with less intense drinking if the men
drank after treatment.

O’Farrell and colleagues (O’Farrell, Murphy, Stephan, Fals-Stewart & Murphy, 2004)
examined IPV before and in the two years after BCT for 303 male alcoholic patients. (For
details see section on IPV immediately below.) Structural equation modeling (SEM) was
used to examine the mechanisms through which involvement in BCT was associated with
IPV outcomes. SEM indicated that greater BCT treatment involvement (attending BCT
sessions and using BCT-targeted behaviors) was related to lower violence in the 2 years
after BCT. BCT-targeted behaviors consisted of Alcohol-focused BCT behaviors (e.g., daily
verbal reinforcement of abstinence, and refraining from conflict about drinking) and
Relationship-focused BCT behaviors (e.g., shared activities and constructive
communication) targeted by BCT..

SEM mediation analyses further indicated the best model fit was obtained with the causal
chain flowing from BCT involvement to improved relationship functioning, to reduced
problem drinking, and then finally to reduced partner violence. “Thus, … the most adequate
fit to the data was provided by a model in which BCT treatment affects relationship
functioning, which in turn affects problem drinking, which in turn affects partner violence”
(O’Farrell et al., 2004, p. 213).

These two preliminary studies of mechanisms underlying BCT outcomes (McCrady et al.,
2002; O’Farrell et al., 2004)) both provide support for the hypothesized role of improved
relationship adjustment and increased relationship support for drinking reduction. These
results for BCT are encouraging because research often has not supported hypothesized
active ingredients and mechanism of change for other evidence-based alcohol treatments
(e.g., Longabaugh et al., 2005). However, both studies fall short of methods recommended
for analyzing mechanisms of change in treatment outcome studies (Baron & Kenny, 1986;
Holmbeck, 1997; Longabaugh & Wirtz, 2001). For example, neither study is a randomized
trial, and the McCrady study did not conduct formal mediational analyses. Thus, although
some preliminary work has been done, there continues to be a need for studies of
mechanisms and processes of change underlying efficacious MFT methods.

BCT and IPV Outcomes—IPV is a major problem among alcoholic patients. Past year
prevalence of IPV ranges from 50–65% for alcoholics seeking treatment with typical rates
greater than 60% (O’Farrell et al, 2004; Schumm et al, 2009). The likelihood of male-to-
female IPV among these patients is considerably higher on days of drinking or drug use
compared with days of no use (Fals-Stewart, Golden & Schumacher, 2003). Since the 2003
review, studies of BCT for both male and female alcoholics have included naturalistic
studies showing dramatic reductions in IPV after BCT, and randomized studies showing
greater IPV reductions after BCT than after individual treatment.

Naturalistic studies of impact of BCT on IPV outcomes: O’Farrell et al. (2004) published
complete results of a study that had been cited in the 2003 review based on unpublished
data. This study examined IPV before and in the two years after the CALM BCT program
with disulfiram for 303 married or cohabiting male alcoholic patients, and used a
demographically matched non-alcoholic comparison sample. IPV prevalence decreased
significantly from 60% in the year before to 24% in the year after BCT, and remitted
patients had 12% IPV prevalence which was identical to the comparison sample. Results for

the second year after BCT were similar to the first year. Thus IPV decreased after BCT, with
remitted patients showing clinically significant IPV reductions to the level of a non-
alcoholic comparison sample.

Turning to IPV among women alcoholic patients, Schumm et al. (2009) conducted a
naturalistic study of IPV before and in the first and second year after the CALM BCT
program with disulfiram for 103 married or cohabiting alcoholic women, and used a
demographically matched non-alcoholic comparison sample. IPV decreased after BCT, with
remitted patients showing IPV reductions to the level of a non-alcoholic comparison sample,
directly replicating findings for male alcoholic patients. (Section above on BCT with women
alcoholic patients has more details on the Schumm et al. 2009 study.)

The findings of dramatically reduced IPV associated with abstinence after the CALM BCT
program with disulfiram have been replicated in three naturalistic studies. These consist of 2
studies with male patients, the O’Farrell et al. (2004) study and an earlier study by O’Farrell
and Murphy (1995), and the Schumm et al. (2009) study with female patients.

Randomized trials comparing IPV outcomes of BCT versus individual-based
treatment: The naturalistic studies of IPV reductions after BCT raise important questions.
These studies have all included daily partner-observed disulfiram, raising the question of
whether BCT without disulfiram would also reduce IPV. Given the relatively low usage of
disulfiram in alcoholism treatment, this is important. Further, a naturalistic study cannot
determine whether reductions in IPV observed are causally linked to BCT. Two randomized
trials of the CALM BCT program without disulfiram, one with male and one with female
patients, address these issues.

Among married or cohabiting male substance abusing patients (75% with a diagnosis of
alcohol dependence), Fals-Stewart and Clinton-Sherrod (2009) randomized 207 men to
either the CALM BCT program (without disulfiram) or individual-based treatment only
(IBT). BCT had lower levels of IPV and substance use at 12-month follow-up than IBT.
Moreover, treatment assignment was a significant moderator of the day-to-day relationship
between substance use and IPV. Likelihood of male-to-female IPV on days of male
partners’ substance use was lower among couples who received BCT compared with IBT.
This finding that BCT reduced risk of violence better than IBT on days of patients’
substance use is important. It suggests that those who receive BCT do not have to rely solely
on abstinence to be protected from IPV, which is good since relapse rates are high. Although
the mechanism underlying this result was not examined, we speculate that methods taught in
BCT protected women against IPV. Specifically, in BCT couples agree not to engage in
angry touching and this agreement is reviewed at each BCT session. Also, if the patient
relapses, women partners are taught not to argue with the patient when he is intoxicated, to
use time-outs when conflicts escalate, to develop a safety plan if they felt threatened, and to
avoid striking, pushing, or shoving out of frustration.

Turning to female alcoholic patients, Fals-Stewart et al. (2006) randomized married or
cohabiting female alcoholic patients (n = 138) to (a) the CALM BCT program (without
disulfiram), (b) individual-based treatment only (IBT), or (c) psychoeducational attention
control treatment (PACT). Patients who received BCT versus those who received IBT or
PACT reported fewer days containing episodes of IPV, in terms of both male-to-female and
female-to-male IPV in the year after treatment. BCT also had better drinking and
relationship outcomes that may have accounted for less IPV in BCT patients, but formal
mediational analyses were not presented. (Section above on BCT with women alcoholic
patients has more details on the Fals-Stewart et al. 2006 study.)

These two randomized trials are the first studies to show that BCT or any type of MFT is
better than individual treatment at reducing the high levels of IPV among individuals
seeking alcoholism treatment. More work is needed to understand the mechanisms
underlying these results. Replication is needed of the finding that BCT produced lower risk
than IBT of IPV on a day when the patient drinks.

BCT, Child Adjustment, and Parent Training—As noted in the 2003 review, Kelley
and Fals-Stewart (2002) conducted the first study examining the impact of BCT on the
children of alcoholic fathers undergoing BCT. Results showed that BCT improved
children’s functioning in the year after the parents’ treatment more than did individual-based
treatment or couple psychoeducation. Further, only BCT showed reduction in the number of
children with clinically significant impairment.

The Kelley and Fals-Stewart results are important. Children living with parents whose
alcoholism is severe enough to seek treatment have more serious adjustment problems than
children from demographically similar homes without parental alcoholism (e.g., Burdzovic
Andreas, O’Farrell & Fals-Stewart, 2006). The children may need help, but most parents
who enter alcoholism treatment are reluctant to allow their children to be involved in any
type of counseling (Fals-Stewart, Kelley, Fincham & Golden, 2004). Two new studies
attempt to increase the benefits of BCT for children by identifying children who may benefit
more from BCT and by adding parent training to BCT.

Kelley and Fals-Stewart (2007) examined whether BCT had greater benefits for
preadolescent than for adolescent children of alcoholic fathers (N=131) who received BCT
and were followed for a year after BCT. Results showed that the association between
parents’ functioning (i.e., fathers’ sober days and parents’ dyadic adjustment) and children’s
adjustment (as rated by mothers, fathers, and children’s teachers) was stronger for
preadolescents than for their adolescent siblings. Kelley and Fals-Stewart argue that BCT,
which reduces paternal drinking and improves couple functioning, may serve as an
important preventative intervention for preadolescents and a way to benefit these children
without identifying or treating then directly. In contrast to younger children, adolescents
who exhibit behavioral difficulties may need direct intervention to address problem
behaviors.

Lam and colleagues (Lam, Fals-Stewart & Kelley, 2008, 2009) examined whether adding
parent skills training to BCT for the alcoholic father had more benefits for the couple’s
preadolescent children. Their pilot study randomized 30 alcoholic fathers to equally
intensive (a) parent training with BCT, (b) BCT (without parent training), or (c) individual
treatment (without couples-based or parent skills interventions). Children did not attend
therapy sessions. Parents completed measures of their own parenting and of child
externalizing and internalizing behaviors at pretreatment, post-treatment, 6- and 12-month
follow up; children completed self-reports of internalizing symptoms at each assessment.
Because this was a small sample pilot study, analyses not only tested statistical significance.
They also examined whether clinically meaningful effect sizes (i.e., r ≥ .20) were observed
for the magnitude of improvements and for the extent of differences between treatment
conditions. Only parent training participants reported clinically meaningful (i.e., either
statistically significant or met the effect-size cut-off) improvements on parenting practices
and all child measures throughout the 12-month follow up. Further, parent training showed
better child outcomes and more positive parenting practices than BCT or individual
treatment alone, as indicated by the effect size cut-off. The very promising results observed
for parent training plus BCT argue strongly for replication with a larger sample and explicit
analyses testing hypothesized mediators of child outcomes.

Other Studies of BCT Including “Negative Results” Studies—McCrady and
colleagues (McCrady, Epstein & Kahler, 2004) provided 18-month follow-up results for
their study comparing methods to maintain change after alcohol behavioral couples therapy
(ABCT; described at start of section on BCT above). They randomized 90 men with alcohol
problems and their female partners to either (a) ABCT, (b) ABCT with relapse prevention
techniques (RP/ABCT), or (c) ABCT with interventions encouraging Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) involvement (AA/ABCT). Couples were followed for 18 months after
treatment. Across the 3 treatments, there were no differences in drinking or marital
happiness outcomes between groups, contrary to the expectation that the two maintenance-
enhanced treatments would yield better outcomes. Results at 6-month follow-up (McCrady,
Epstein & Hirsch, 1999), which were included in the 2003 review, were similar to these 18-
month follow-up results. However, the somewhat low follow-up completion rates (73%
versus the current standard of 90%) may have affected results by retaining less severe
patients in all 3 conditions, thus reducing the likelihood of finding group differences. Also,
another study noted in the 2003 review found a main effect of more days abstinent for
adding RP sessions to BCT, as well as a severity by treatment interaction such that
alcoholics with more severe marital and drinking problems benefited more from the added
RP sessions (O’Farrell, Choquette & Cutter, 1998).

Nattala et al (2010) randomized 90 male alcohol-dependent patients admitted for 3 weeks at
an inpatient facility in India to either (a) dyadic relapse prevention (DRP), (b) individual
relapse prevention (IRP), or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). In DRP, which was based on
BCT treatment manuals from the U.S., both the patient and a family member (75% spouses)
planned and rehearsed how the dyad could work together to prevent relapse. In IRP,
intervention also focused on preventing relapse but only the individual patient took part.
Participants had monthly follow-up visits to encourage progress (using methods consistent
with the study treatment they received) and to collect outcome data for 6 months after
discharge from the treatment center. Results for this 6-month period showed that DRP
consistently performed better than TAU on all of the outcomes (reduction in quantity of
alcohol, drinking days, and number of days with dysfunction in family, occupational, and
financial dimensions). DRP participants also reported a significant reduction in the quantity
of alcohol, drinking days, and family problems, compared with IRP. Study authors
concluded that their findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of Western-based family
oriented intervention for alcohol-dependent patients in India.

Vedel, Emmelkamp and Schippers (2008) conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing
stand-alone BCT (n = 30; 10 45–60 minute sessions) with individual Cognitive-Behavioral
Therapy (CBT; n = 34; 10 90 minute sessions) in community treatment centers for Dutch
male and female alcoholics and their partners. Drinking and relationship functioning
measures were collected at intake, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Results showed
both BCT and CBT significantly decreased drinking behavior from before to after treatment,
but BCT was not found to be significantly better than CBT (although a small to medium
effect size favored BCT over CBT). Marital satisfaction of the spouse increased significantly
after treatment in BCT but not in CBT, with a large effect size favoring BCT over CBT. At
6-month follow-up, BCT and CBT did not differ on drinking or marital outcomes.

Study authors conclude: “Stand-alone BCT is as effective as CBT in terms of reduced
drinking and … more effective in terms of enhancing relationship satisfaction. However,
BCT is a more costly intervention, given that treatment sessions lasted almost twice as long
as individual CBT sessions” (Vedel at al., 2008, p. 280). The suggestion that BCT is less
cost-effective than CBT is based on the 90-minute BCT sessions used in this study, whereas
many other studies have used 50–60-minute BCT sessions (e.g., O’Farrell et al., 1998) the
same as used for CBT. Further, the low follow-up completion rates (67–75%) may have

affected the results. The quality and fidelity of BCT in this study is not known because
fidelity ratings were not provided. Addiction counselors may have delivered a higher quality
CBT, the standard treatment in Dutch addiction centers, as compared to the newer BCT
treatment with which they were less familiar. Finally, the BCT format studied is somewhat
unclear given that the authors say they used both the CALM BCT method and McCrady’s
ABCT method, despite the fact that these two models have some important differences.

An Australian study described above (Halford et al. 2001) showed “negative results” for
BCT. Alcohol-focused couple therapy (AFCT) based on the CALM BCT model was
compared with supportive counseling or stress management for women whose husbands
drank heavily but were not currently in alcohol treatment. All treatments eased the wife’s
emotional distress, but neither AFCT or the other treatments improved the man’s drinking or
the couple’s relationship. The lack of impact of AFCT is not surprising when one considers
that AFCT/ BCT has always been studied when the alcoholic has already sought help, not as
a method for engaging treatment resistant alcoholics. The 6 of 21 women assigned to AFCT
who actually engaged their husband in couple therapy completed this therapy and benefited
from reduced drinking and happier relationships. This study suggests BCT may have limited
usefulness when the alcoholic refuses to change or enter treatment with the spouse. In such
cases, CRAFT to promote treatment or Al-Anon to help the family may be better options as
already described above.

A study by Walitzer and Dermen (2004) has frequently been cited as showing “negative
results” for BCT. This study randomized 64 male problem drinkers to 1 of 3 conditions: (a)
drinking reduction treatment for problem drinkers only (PDO), (b) alcohol-focused spouse
involvement (AFSI), or (c) AFSI + BCT focused on relationship enhancement. Drinkers
whose spouses were included in treatment (i.e., AFSI and the AFSI + BCT conditions
combined) evidenced fewer heavy drinking days and more abstinent/light drinking days in
the year following treatment, relative to PDO clients. The combination of AFSI + BCT did
no better than AFSI alone on these drinking outcomes. Treatment conditions did not differ
on relationship satisfaction.

Based on these findings, some have concluded that “BCT did not work” in this study. This
conclusion does not seem warranted when drinking outcomes are considered for two
reasons. First, terminology should be considered. BCT for alcoholism has typically meant
the combination of alcohol-focused interventions to support reduced drinking plus
relationship-focused interventions to enhance relationship satisfaction. Walitzer used BCT
to mean the relationship enhancement aspects of BCT only. Second, when the authors did
supplementary analyses using separate pairwise contrasts between treatment conditions, they
found significantly fewer heavy drinking days for AFSI + BCT than for PDO. This should
be interpreted as “BCT works” in that BCT (with a combined focus on drinking reduction
and relationship enhancement) produced better drinking outcomes than individual treatment.

However, the failure of BCT to enhance marital satisfaction is noteworthy. One explanation
noted by study authors is that the couples in this study were not maritally distressed at
baseline. The Walitzer study was different from other BCT studies in two ways, low severity
alcohol problems and relatively satisfied relationships. It was the only BCT study that
included only low severity alcohol problems (described as “early stage problem drinkers”
with low levels of alcohol dependence, “not alcoholics”). Perhaps the safest conclusion is
that the benefit of BCT with low severity problem drinkers (especially those with relatively
satisfied relationships) has received little attention, and the Walitzer study raises questions
as to whether its efficacy extends to this subgroup.

Family Systems Therapy

Page 16

Family Systems Therapy (FST) has incorporated many core concepts of family systems
theory into models of the alcoholic family system (Steinglass, Bennett, Wolin & Reiss,
1987; Rohrbaugh, Shoham, Spungen & Steinglass, 1995). Therapy focuses on the
interactional rather than the individual level. FST uses a variety of techniques to affect
interactions within the family. Greatest emphasis is put on identifying and altering family
interaction patterns that are associated with problematic alcohol use. FST can be applied to
couples therapy or whole family therapy.

FST has not been studied as extensively as some other approaches. The Couples Alcoholism
Treatment (CAT) study (Shoham, Rohrbaugh, Stickle & Jacob, 1998), which was covered in
the 2003 review, was a major outcome study of FST. The CAT study randomly assigned 75
alcoholic patients to 20 scheduled sessions over a 4- to 5-month period of either cognitive-
behavioral couple therapy (CBT; Wakefield, Williams, Yost & Patterson, 1996) or family-
systems couple therapy (FST; Rohrbaugh et al., 1995). Couples were followed for a 12-
month follow-up period.

The first article on the CAT study (Shoham et al., 1998) examined retention in treatment for
the 63 couples with a male alcoholic patient. Although they did not find main effect
differences in retention between the two treatments, they did find an interesting moderator
effect. Couples high on pretreatment measures of demand-withdraw interaction (a pattern in
which the wife demands and the husband withdraws) attended fewer sessions and more
often failed to complete CBT, whereas demand-withdraw interaction made little difference
in FST. Shoham suggested that the alcoholic husband in such couples withdrew from a high-
demand CBT therapy in the same way he tended to withdraw from a demanding wife. CBT
in this study was “a high demand cognitive-behavioral therapy that focused primarily on the
partners as individuals” and FST was “a low demand systemic treatment focused on the
partners as a couple” (p. 572). Shoham acknowledged that the CBT used may not represent
less demanding behavioral approaches such as motivational interviewing (Miller &
Rollnick, 1991) or other BCT methods (e.g., Project CALM; Rotunda & O’Farrell, 1997).
These intriguing findings merit further study. If replicated and extended to outcomes beyond
retention in treatment, these results could have important implications for matching couples
to treatments. Two new articles on the CAT study have appeared since the 2003 review.

In a second article from the CAT study, Karno, Beutler and Harwood (2002) found that
patients treated in CBT had significantly better drinking outcomes than patients in FST
during the 4- to 5-month treatment period. They further examined interactions between
patient attributes and therapist interventions on drinking outcomes. Patients high in
emotional distress did best when their therapy addressed emotional experiences, and the
converse was observed for patients low in distress. Patients high in reactance had better
drinking outcomes when their therapy was nondirective, and patients low in reactance
improved more with directive therapy. In contrast to the interactions between patient
attributes and the therapy process, the interactions between patient attributes and treatment
model (CBT versus FST) were not reliable predictors of alcohol use. Limitations to the
Karno et al (2002) results include (a) the measure of drinking outcome was a non-standard
measure constructed for the study; (b) only 63% of the intent to treat sample (N=75) were
included in the analyses due to extensive missing data; and (c) outcomes during the 12-
month follow-up period were not examined.

In a third article from the CAT study, Kuenzler and Beutler (2003) examined whether FST
or CBT couples alcohol treatment benefited patients’ partners. They found that partners in
FST reduced their alcohol use more than partners in CBT during the 4- to 5-month treatment
period, while conversely partners in CBT improved their overall functioning (on the GAF

Axis V scale from the DSM-III-R, American Psychiatric Association, 1987) more than
partners in FST. On self-rated psychiatric symptoms (Derogatis, 1983), FST and CBT did
not differ and both showed little improvement. Further, aptitude by treatment interactions
similar to those examined for patients by Karno et al (2002) did not produce significant
results for partners’ outcomes. Limitations include non-standard alcohol use measure and
lack of follow-up results as already noted. Another concern is that only the subsample of
partners (67% of the intent to treat sample of 75) who were drinking at intake were included
in analyses.

Other MFT Approaches

The UK Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT, 2005a) was a large, multi-site, well-controlled
randomized clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of social behavior and network
therapy (SBNT), a new treatment for alcohol problems, with that of motivational
enhancement therapy (MET) considered to be a proven therapy. Patients (N=742) with
alcohol problems were assigned to treatment sessions over an 8–12 week period (3 MET
sessions vs 8 SBNT sessions). Outcome data were collected at 3- and 12-months after study
entry. Results showed that both groups reported statistically significant reductions in alcohol
consumption, dependence, and problems, and better mental health related quality of life over
12 months. Between groups there was only one significant difference in outcome; the SBNT
group showed significantly better physical health at three months. This one isolated
difference was considered probably due to chance by study authors based on the number of
statistical comparisons made. Cost analyses (UKATT, 2005b) showed that both therapies
saved about 5 times as much in expenditure on health, social, and criminal justice services as
they cost to deliver. Neither net savings or cost-effectiveness differed significantly between
the two therapies. Also, the UKATT trial failed to find any patient-treatment matching
effects (UKATT, 2007).

Considering overall results of the UKATT trial, study authors concluded that SBNT and
MET were equally effective and equally cost-effective. They said “The combination of a
sample size large enough to detect small differences and the lack of significant differences
leads to positive conclusions about the value of both of these treatments for alcohol
problems” (UKATT, 2005b. 549). They interpreted these findings as providing support for
the effectiveness of SBNT, which they saw as performing as well as the established MET
method. Notably, the UKATT trial is the first large scale effectiveness trial of an MFT-
inspired intervention (i.e., SBNT). The results are encouraging as the authors note.

Caution should be exercised when considering the SBNT results. First, the authors did not
report whether SBNT actually increased social network support for drinking change as
planned. They also did not report if changes in social network were related to outcomes.

Second, a different interpretation of the UKATT findings is that neither treatment
produced clinically significant improvements (Luty & Carnwath, 2008). Project
MATCH (Project Match Research Group, 1997), the U.S. multisite trial on which
UKATT was based, showed patients with 80–90% days abstinent at 3- and 12-
month follow-up, whereas esponding data from UKATT were 43–46% days
abstinent. Further, UKATT patients who drank consumed 18–19 drinks per
drinking day at 3- and 12-month follow-up.

Third, based on other studies of MFT examined in the present review, it might have been
expected that SBNT would have shown better outcomes than MET. SBNT aims to promote
positive social support for a change in the patient’s drinking behavior by involving network
members in treatment sessions with the patient. A strength of SBNT is its flexibility in
including a broader array of network members than partners and in allowing the therapist to
pursue network support in varied ways. However, this SBNT flexibility may reduce the

consistency and concreteness of social support for drinking change that characterizes social
support interventions that do show better outcomes than individual treatment. For example,
as described above, BCT support for abstinence includes a daily trust discussion with the
partner and tracking AA meetings attended on a calendar. In a further example, Litt and
colleagues (Litt, Kadden, Kabela-Cormier & Petry, 2007) showed that a network support
intervention (mainly encouraging and tracking AA attendance) increased support for
patients’ abstinence and led to better drinking outcomes than an individually-focused case
management treatment.

Conclusions About MFT to Aid Recovery When the Alcoholic Has Sought Help

This section considers the current status of issues raised by the 2003 review. It also
summarizes other key conclusions about the current state of outcome research on MFT to
aid recovery when the alcoholic has sought help

First, the 2003 review recommended studies evaluating MFT with a broader group of
patients including women and minority patients. Clear progress has been made on this
recommendation. Four studies of BCT with women alcoholics have appeared since the 2003
review at which time there were no such studies. Three were randomized clinical trials
(RCT) showing better drinking outcomes for BCT than for individual treatment (Fals-
Stewart et al., 2006; McCrady et al., 2009; Schumm et al. 2008) and the fourth was a
naturalistic study showing substantial reductions in IPV after BCT (Schumm et al., 2009).
These 4 studies, which show a very similar pattern of results to those found for male
alcoholics, come from 3 groups of investigators and use somewhat different BCT protocols,
suggesting the findings are fairly robust. Two other studies are also relevant to this
recommendation. An RCT showed for the first time that BCT produced better drinking and
relationship outcomes for gay and lesbian alcoholics (Fals-Stewart et al., 2009). A small
uncontrolled trial showed promising results for BCT with alcoholic male veterans with
comorbid PTSD (Rotunda et al., 2008). However, studies of BCT or other MFT with
minority group patients have not yet appeared in the literature.

Second, the 2003 review recommended studies of the transportability and dissemination of
evidence-based MFT approaches to clinical practice settings. At the time of the 2003 review
there were no such studies. Some initial progress has been made on this recommendation.
An initial study (O’Farrell, Richard et al., 2010) transported the CALM BCT program to a
community clinic in Calgary. Implementation of BCT was considered successful because
BCT had better 6-month follow-up outcomes than individual-based TAU in a quasi-
experimental evaluation, and because the BCT program in Calgary that began in 1998
continues to the present. Other studies attempted to overcome barriers to dissemination and
implementation. To decrease the cost to deliver BCT, a brief 6-session BCT was developed
that showed equivalent positive outcomes to the longer more costly 12-session version
(Fals-Stewart, Klosterman et al, 2005). To expand the pool of patients suitable for BCT, it
was adapted for use with family members other than spouses, and the resulting behavioral
family counseling had better outcomes than individual treatment (O’Farrell, Murphy et al.,
2010). To develop new uses for BCT, it was adapted to successfully promote aftercare post-
detox (O’Farrell et al., 2007, 2008a, 2008b).

Third, the 2003 review recommended studies of mechanisms and processes of change
underlying MFT. Only limited progress has been made on this front. Two preliminary
studies of mechanisms underlying BCT outcomes (McCrady et al., 2002; O’Farrell et al.,
2004)) both provide support for the hypothesized role of improved relationship adjustment
and increased relationship support for drinking reduction. However, both studies fall short of
methods recommended for analyzing mechanisms of change in treatment outcome studies
(Baron & Kenny, 1986; Holmbeck, 1997; Longabaugh & Wirtz, 2001).

Fourth, as noted in the 2003 review, BCT produces better primary outcomes of reduced
drinking and increased relationship satisfaction than individual treatment. The BCT
secondary outcomes of reduced IPV and improved child adjustment, which were introduced
in the 2003 review, have been studied further in the interim. The findings of dramatically
reduced IPV associated with abstinence after the CALM BCT program with disulfiram have
been replicated with male alcoholic patients (O’Farrell et al., 2004) and extended to female
patients (Schumm et al., 2009). Two randomized trials of the CALM BCT program without
disulfiram, one with male (Fals-Stewart & Clinton-Sherrod, 2009) and one with female
(Fals-Stewart et al., 2006) patients, found less IPV in the year after treatment for BCT than
for individual treatment. Moreover, BCT reduced risk of IPV on days patients drank better
than IBT, suggesting that those who receive BCT do not have to rely solely on abstinence to
be protected from IPV, and possibly that BCT taught women how to prevent IPV when the
husband drank (Fals-Stewart & Clinton-Sherrod, 2009). Improvements in child adjustment,
as noted in the 2003 review, are greater after BCT than individual treatment (Kelley & Fals-
Stewart, 2002); and BCT had greater benefits for preadolescent than for adolescent children
(Kelley & Fals-Stewart, 2007). Building on these results, a pilot study showed that adding
parent skills training to BCT for the alcoholic father had more benefits for the couple’s
preadolescent children than BCT alone (Lam, Fals-Stewart & Kelley, 2008, 2009),
promising results that clearly merit replication.

Fifth, family systems therapy (FST) was the focus of 7 studies in the 2003 review, but there
have been no new FST studies since then. New FST empirical papers have been limited to
additional analyses of the Couples Alcoholism Treatment (CAT) study, which compared
cognitive-behavioral couple therapy (CBT) with family-systems (FST) couple therapy. The
first CAT study article (reviewed in 2003) reported that FST had better treatment retention
than CBT for couples with more seriously disturbed communication patterns (Shoham et al.,
1998). Additional CAT study articles reported that FST, compared with CBT, had less
favorable patient drinking outcomes (Karno et al, 2002), greater reductions in partners’
alcohol use, and less improvement in partners’ overall functioning (Kuenzler & Beutler,
2003). Finally, Steinglass (2009) has creatively combined FST and motivational
interviewing to provide a systemic-motivational model for treatment of alcoholism;
controlled studies of this approach are needed.

FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

This section suggests directions for future research. The following suggestions for future
research are recommended.

1. Studies are needed that evaluate MFT with a broader group of patients. Although
clear progress has been made in RCTs with women alcoholic patients, there have
been no studies with samples that include a large proportion of minority group
patients. There is also a need for research on MFT for couples in which both the
male and female member have a current alcohol or other substance use problem.
Also, research is needed to determine whether MFT improves treatment for
problem drinkers as it does for alcoholism. Finally, alcoholic patients with
substantial psychiatric comorbidity, such as PTSD or chronic mental illness (e.g.
Mueser et al, 2009), have received little attention in the MFT literature and should
be studied.

2. Studies are needed to investigate the transportability and dissemination of

evidence-based MFT approaches to clinical practice settings. Although some initial
progress has been made, there is a great deal of work to be done.

3. Studies of mechanisms and processes of change underlying effective MFT methods

are needed. Only limited progress has been made on this front to date.

4. Studies are needed that expand outcome domains and interventions beyond the
primary focus of reduced drinking and increased relationship satisfaction. Child
adjustment and IPV are two “secondary outcomes” that need further attention.
Related to child adjustment, studies are needed to replicate initial studies showing
that child adjustment is improved after BCT, and that adding parent training to
BCT improves child outcomes further than BCT alone. Related to IPV, studies are
needed to replicate the finding of greater IPV reduction for BCT than individual
treatment and to examine the treatment interventions and processes of change that
protect a couple from IPV even when the patient is drinking.

A CLINICIAN RESPONDS

I am a practicing clinician and a clinical researcher. I was a clinician first, and a researcher
second. In 1978, after working solely as a clinician for a few years, I established the
Counseling for Alcoholics’ Marriages (CALM) Project, known as Project CALM, at a VA
substance abuse treatment program in the Boston area. Project CALM started as a research
clinic to conduct outcome studies of behavioral couples therapy (BCT) for alcoholism and
drug abuse. However, for the past decade or more, Project CALM has been a treatment
program, not a site for outcome studies. In the Project CALM treatment program, we have
applied what we learned in our earlier research studies in a clinically flexible manner.

Many believe that results from research studies do not hold up when new treatments are
applied to routine clinical practice because research studies use carefully selected patients
and have ideal conditions. However, this has not been our experience. BCT works well
under routine clinical conditions when it is applied flexibly to meet any special needs of the
patients or circumstances of the clinical setting. This has been our goal at Project CALM in
recent years.

In the Project CALM treatment program, most patients who seek help are offered treatment
with few exceptions (unlike the sometimes extensive exclusion criteria used in outcome
studies). The BCT sessions couples receive typically include the core elements described in
a BCT treatment manual (O’Farrell & Fals-Stewart, 2006). However, for experienced BCT
therapists, the manual serves more as a reference guide than a session by session
prescription. Therapists or trainees new to BCT are encouraged to follow the manual until
they master it. The number of BCT sessions and the duration of treatment is determined
flexibly based on the needs of each patient. Typically patients attend from 12 to 20 weekly
conjoint BCT sessions followed by periodic check-ups or more extended relapse prevention
sessions for as long as deemed clinically needed. It is not uncommon for patients with more
severe problems to attend BCT and couples-based aftercare for a few years. The majority of
patients attend AA or other 12-step meetings. Many patients also attend individual substance
abuse or mental health counseling, usually delivered by counselors other than the person
providing BCT. A sizeable minority of patients include recovery medication (e.g.,
acamprosate, disulfiram or naltrexone) as part of their BCT Recovery Contract.
Psychotropic medications for comorbid mental health problems also are commonly used
because many patients in this setting have complex comorbid psychiatric and medical
problems.

MFT clinicians who wish to use evidence-based approaches in their work with alcoholic
patients and their families will find some promising methods in this review. These
approaches include Al-Anon facilitation and coping skills training to help families cope
better, CRAFT to encourage alcoholics to enter treatment, and BCT to support abstinence

and repair relationships for alcoholics who have sought help. None of these approaches is
currently in widespread use. To assist MFT practitioners with gaining further information,
titles in the reference list that may be especially useful in describing these clinical methods
have been marked with a double asterisk. One of the advances since the 2003 review is that
detailed treatment manuals are now available for each of the MFT methods that has research
support for use with alcoholics and their families. Specifically, these treatment manual
citations are the following.

•

•

•

•

Al-Anon facilitation (Nowinski, 1999)

Coping skills training (Rychtarik, McGillicuddy & Duquette, 1995)

Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT; Meyers & Wolfe, 2004;
Smith & Meyers, 2004)

Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT; McCrady & Epstein, 2008; O’Farrell & Fals-
Stewart, 2006)

How is a practicing MFT or an MFT student supposed to learn to do these evidence-based
treatments for alcoholism? Can an MFT learn these treatments from a book? Training that is
available in these approaches consists of isolated workshops, not a systematic, high quality,
sustained training program or organization devoted to teaching and fostering implementation
of these treatment methods. Although such programs and organizations exist for some
adolescent family-involved substance abuse interventions for adolescents (see paper in this
issue by Rowe and Liddle), they are not yet available for evidence-based MFT for
alcoholism in adults.

Training in evidence-based approaches for MFT students and clinicians is needed. One
obstacle is that the most appropriate venue for such training is not entirely clear. Should this
training be done in MFT masters or doctoral programs that already have a full curriculum, or
in specialized institutes or continuing education programs? Another obstacle is that three of
the four evidence-based approaches (CRAFT, coping skills training, BCT) are behavioral
approaches while the vast majority of MFT clinicians have strong training and allegiance to
a family systems approach. Unfortunately, a family systems approach to treating alcoholism,
while influential on a conceptual level, has not been formalized in a manualized treatment
and shown in repeated empirical tests to be effective.

This paper has documented effective MFT approaches for use with alcoholics and their
families. Studies of MFT to help the family and encourage the alcoholic to enter treatment
may generalize well to MFT office practice. However, most studies of MFT to aid the
alcoholic who has sought treatment were conducted in alcoholism treatment settings or in
university-affiliated research clinics. None of the studies were done in MFT office practice
settings, so we do not know if the results of the studies reviewed here would generalize to
the typical practice of marriage and family therapists. In alcoholism treatment settings and in
research projects focused on alcoholism, participants are aware that alcoholism will be
addressed in the therapy. In such settings, participants have at least some recognition of the
alcohol problem and at least tacit readiness to address the problem. In MFT practice, clients
often do not recognize and may not be ready to address the alcohol problem. Therefore, the
MFT approaches described in this paper may work in the MFT office practice setting only if
clients have some readiness for changing the alcohol problem or if the MFT practitioner is
able to help clients develop such problem recognition and readiness for change.
