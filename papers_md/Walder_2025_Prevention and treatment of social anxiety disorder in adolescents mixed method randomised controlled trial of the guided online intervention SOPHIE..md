Social anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent in adolescents and negatively impact their social 
and academic functioning, highlighting the need for effective low-threshold interventions. This 
randomised controlled trial evaluated the guided online intervention SOPHIE for adolescents (N = 133; 
11–17 years) with social anxiety disorder (SAD; treatment) or subclinical social anxiety (indicated 
prevention) compared to care-as-usual control condition and qualitatively explored their experiences. 
Outcomes were assessed at baseline, mid-intervention (4 weeks), post-intervention (8 weeks) and 
5-month follow-up and analysed using linear mixed-effects models. SOPHIE did not significantly 
reduce social anxiety symptoms post-intervention but showed a significant between-group effect at 
follow-up (d = 0.67, 95%CI [0.32;1.02]). Subgroup analyses by diagnostic condition showed a significant 
between-group effect at follow-up in the subclinical social anxiety (d = 1.53, 95%CI [1.74;0.41]) but not 
in the SAD condition. Social functioning significantly improved at post-intervention and follow-up, 
with medium to large effects (post: d=-0.73, 95%CI [-1.08; -0.37]; follow-up: d=-0.32, 95%CI [-0.66; 
0.02]). Qualitative interviews post-intervention revealed that participants found the intervention 
beneficial, although some found exposure exercises challenging and desired additional support. 
Very heterogeneous needs emerged regarding the guidance provided during the programme. Low-
threshold online interventions for adolescents with social anxiety may be effective, particularly as an 
indicated prevention approach.

Adolescence represents an important period in the development of social anxiety disorder (SAD), with a mean 
age  of  onset  of  14  years1.  In  population-based  adolescent  samples,  the  point  prevalence  of  clinician-assessed 
SAD-criteria is 2.6%, while up to 50% report subclinical levels of social anxiety symptoms2–7. If left untreated, 
SAD has a high likelihood of persisting into adulthood and may lead to the development of other disorders as 
well as lower social and academic functioning8–12. Highly scalable, low-threshold intervention programs, such 
as online interventions, could be a promising strategy to prevent such negative long-term consequences and to 
address the care gap that is especially pronounced in adolescents13.

Online interventions have shown small but significant effects in reducing anxiety symptoms in adolescents 
with  an  anxiety  disorder14–16  but  research  on  online  delivered  prevention  is  still  inconclusive.  In  face-to-
face  settings,  meta-analytic  evidence  has  shown  that  indicated  transdiagnostic  interventions  yield  small  but 
significant effects in reducing anxiety symptoms among adolescents at risk for several anxiety disorders17. In 
online settings however, even though some studies found a small significant reduction in subclinical anxiety 
symptoms, meta-analytic results on universal and targeted prevention programmes could not confirm this18,19. 
Low participation and high dropout rates and challenges regarding the implementation and sustaining use of 
online interventions in adolescent studies may contribute to these low effects. Human support in the form of

guidance may help to address these issues20,21 as guided interventions based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 
(CBT)  have  often  demonstrated  to  be  more  effective  in  adolescent  samples  than  unguided  self-help  or  other 
psychological interventions22.

Next to human guidance, tailoring interventions specifically to SAD may yield better outcomes as adolescents 
with SAD symptoms benefited more from SAD-specific content than from interventions focusing on anxiety in 
general23–28. Such interventions specifically designed for SAD could target mechanisms involved in developing 
and maintaining SAD. Etiological models of social anxiety29–32 propose overlapping factors that contribute to 
maintaining SAD and form the basis of SAD-specific interventions. These include cognitive processes such as 
negative  social-evaluative  cognitions  and  self-focus  during  social  situations,  as  well  as  behavioural  processes 
such  as  avoidance  behaviours  beforehand  and  safety  behaviours  during  social  interactions33.  Randomised 
controlled  trials  (RCT)  investigating  online  interventions  based  on  such  models,  specifically  the  Cognitive 
Model of Social Phobia by Clark and Wells and the Cognitive-Behavioural Model of Anxiety in Social Phobia by 
Rapee and Heimberg, in clinical adolescent samples with SAD showed significant reductions in social anxiety 
and improvements in social functioning34–36. None of these RCTs has specifically targeted subclinical levels of 
social anxiety.

Previous research on the evaluation of online interventions is mainly based on RCTs. Integrating qualitative 
elements  in  RCTs  could  offer  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  intervention’s  impact  and  the 
contextual factors influencing its efficacy. Further, it offers the possibility to involve adolescents’ voices thereby 
democratising  inputs  to  research37,38.  A  previous  RCT  included  a  qualitative  evaluation  of  adolescents’ 
experiences  with  an  online  intervention  for  SAD:  Adolescents  appreciated  the  autonomy  when  working 
through the modules at their own pace and the flexibility in contact with the person providing guidance39. They 
considered the exposure exercises to be the most challenging but also the most helpful ones. These qualitative 
results were reported separately from the quantitative efficacy results36,39 although a combined discussion could 
provide a more integrated understanding of the effects40.

Overall, initial studies suggest positive effects of online interventions on adolescents with SAD, but evidence 
on those with subclinical symptoms is limited. There is little qualitative research on adolescents’ experiences 
of  using  such  interventions.  Thus,  the  primary  aim  of  this  RCT  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  an  online 
intervention  called  SOPHIE41  developed  to  reduce  subclinical  social  anxiety  (i.e.,  indicated  prevention)  and 
SAD (i.e., intervention) by targeting the psychological mechanisms postulated by the Clark & Wells’ Cognitive 
Model30  (i.e.,  self-focused  attention,  negative  automatic  thoughts  during  a  social  event,  and  pre-  and  post-
event processing of this situation, as well as safety behaviour and avoidance) by comparing the effects of the 
intervention group with those of the care-as-usual (CAU) control group on social anxiety symptoms at post- 
(primary outcome; 2 months after randomisation) and follow-up (5 months after randomisation) assessments. 
Secondary outcomes included remission of SAD diagnosis, generalised anxiety, depression, self-esteem, quality 
of life, level of functioning, and social anxiety assessed by guardians. Further, the participants’ experiences of 
using the SOPHIE program were explored through qualitative interviews.

Results
Participants
Recruitment of adolescents aged 11 to 17 years started in August 2021 and ended in August 2023 due to regulatory 
reasons. Last assessment was in March 2024. Recruitment of participants with subclinical social anxiety resulted 
in a lower sample size than targeted even though a comprehensive recruitment plan was followed. The SAD-
group sample size was increased from the planed sample size of N = 56 to N = 80 participants, to account for 
dropouts  and  incomplete  assessments42.  In  total,  164  participants  provided  informed  consent  or  assent.  Of 
these, 133 completed baseline assessments and were randomised to the SOPHIE intervention or CAU group. 
Additionally,  117  guardians  completed  assessments  at  least  once.  The  CONSORT  flow  diagram  (see  Fig.  1) 
illustrates the progression of participants while baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. There were no 
significant differences between study groups in terms of demographic, clinical, or outcome variables.

During  the  intervention  period,  n = 18  (intervention  group:  n = 9;  CAU  group  n = 9)  adolescents  received 
weekly  or  biweekly  psychotherapy,  n = 5  (intervention  group:  n = 5;  CAU  group  n = 0)  adolescents  were 
supported by psychosocial professionals (e.g., social workers), and n = 5 (intervention group: n = 3; CAU group 
n = 2) adolescents were medicated with psychotropic drugs. For the intervention group, Table 2 provides details 
on adherence rates, amount of guidance, any reported negative effects due to the intervention and participants’ 
overall satisfaction with the intervention.

Missingness and dropout analysis
The  percentage  of  missing  values  on  the  primary  outcome  (SPIN)  was  27%  and  on  secondary  outcomes 
28%  in  total.  Telephone  interviews  had  higher  missingness  (44%  at  post-assessment  and  53%  at  follow-up). 
Demographic  variables  and  baseline  assessments  did  not  predict  missingness  at  mid-,  post-,  or  follow-up 
assessments supporting missingness at random (MAR). Only younger age at baseline was significantly associated 
with  missingness  at  follow-up  (β = 0.27,  p < 0.05).  Adolescents  in  the  CAU  control  group  tended  to  complete 
more assessments, but the difference was only significant at post-assessment (X2

(1) = 6.04, p < 0.05).

Efficacy analysis
Mean  SPIN  scores  over  time  are  shown  separately  for  both  study  groups  (SOPHIE  vs.  CAU)  and  diagnostic 
conditions (SAD vs. subclinical) in Fig. 2. Observed and estimated means of primary and secondary outcomes 
of the linear mixed-effects models from baseline to post-intervention are reported in Table 3. Table 4 displays 
intercept and estimates of the linear mixed-effects models on primary and secondary outcomes for time and 
group interaction from baseline to post and corresponding between and within group effect sizes. Observed and

estimated means at follow-up are reported in Table 5, and coefficients derived of the linear mixed-effects models 
and effect sizes are displayed in Table 6.

The  primary  outcome  (SPIN  score  at  post-assessment)  did  not  differ  significantly  between  the  two  study 
groups.  However,  the  SOPHIE  group  had  significantly  lower  SPIN  scores  compared  to  the  CAU  group  at 
follow-up (p < 0.001; Table 6) with a medium to large between-group effect size. Subgroup analyses were run for 
both diagnostic condition SAD and subclinical social anxiety. For the SAD condition, there was no significant 
difference  between  the  intervention  group  and  the  control  group  at  post-  and  follow-up  assessment.  For  the 
subclinical condition, no significant difference was found at post-assessment, however, the intervention group

Fig. 2.  Observed mean SPIN scores and their 95% confidence intervals at all assessment points divided by 
diagnostic condition and study group.

Remission  of  SAD  in  the  clinical  group  yielded  no  significant  differences  between  the  intervention  and 
control condition at post- and follow-up assessment (p ≥ 0.118). In the clinical intervention group, 63% of the 
adolescents met diagnostic criteria for SAD at post-assessment and 80% at follow-up; in the clinical CAU group, 
74% at post-assessment and 65% at follow-up.

The  sensitivity  analyses  using  the  per-protocol  sample  (i.e.,  participants  who  completed  baseline,  mid-
intervention,  and  post-intervention  assessments  for  the  post-assessment  model,  and  all  four  assessments  for 
the follow-up model) generally supported the ITT results. At follow-up, the SPIN scores differed significantly 
between the SOPHIE and CAU conditions (p < 0.001). In contrast to the ITT analyses, a significant difference 
between  study  conditions  was  also  observed  at  post-assessment  (p = 0.032).  Subgroup  analyses  by  diagnostic 
condition yielded the same results pattern as in the ITT-analysis (see Supplementary Table 2).

Qualitative analysis
Out of N = 32 eligible adolescents, n = 17 participated in the qualitative interview. For this sample, information 
on demographic and intervention usage is provided in supplementary Table 1. Four main summary domains 
were identified, detailing adolescents’ experiences with the intervention: (I) therapeutic relationship, (II) factors 
contributing to or preventing engagement with the intervention, (III) adolescents’ reflection on their symptom 
and  behaviour  changes,  and  (IV)  adolescents’  evaluation  of  the  SOPHIE  intervention  content.  Definitions, 
subdomains and examples are described in Table 7. The relationship with the e-coach varied greatly (i.e., domain 
I). Some adolescents found it supportive, others perceived it as impersonal like a chatbot, or even as stressful 
and uncomfortable because they assumed that their progress in the intervention was observed. E-coaches were 
also  seen  as  providing  a  clear  structure  that  helped  some  adolescents  to  make  progress.  Additionally,  some 
adolescents appreciated the format of remote support, without the need to visit a therapist.

Adolescents discussed further factors contributing to their engagement with the intervention (i.e., domain 
II). Awareness of the problem and motivation to change played key roles, especially in the early phase of the 
intervention. Interest in the content and personal improvements acted as motivators to continue. Structure of 
the program, including reminders by e-coaches or parents, or module structure, were perceived as helpful to

plan and organise the use of the intervention over the eight weeks. The most common barrier to engagement 
was lack of time or forgetting.

When adolescents reflected on changes in their symptoms and behaviour (i.e., domain III), their responses 
diverged:  some  reported  symptomatic  improvement,  others  noted  partial  improvement  but  felt  that  more 
time was needed, and some reported no improvement or worsening of their problems. Some noticed tangible 
improvements in daily life, while others struggled, especially with behavioural tasks such as exposure exercises. 
Although  they  could  understand  the  importance  of  doing  exposure  exercises,  many  found  it  challenging  to 
implement them independently and some indicated that they would need additional support.

The content of the intervention (i.e., domain IV) was generally understandable and relevant. Some felt seen 
and understood because of examples and videos that were targeted to them (i.e., problems, age group). Younger 
adolescents sometimes struggled to understand the psychoeducational content but could seek help from their 
parents. Exercises were generally regarded as helpful and suitable although some found it difficult to adapt them 
to their own lives and thus did not engage in them.

Discussion
The primary aim of the RCT was to evaluate the efficacy of the online intervention SOPHIE in reducing social 
anxiety in adolescents. While no significant difference between the intervention and control group was found 
post-intervention in social anxiety, a significant difference emerged at 3-month follow-up with a medium to 
large effect size. Subgroup analysis showed significant differences with a large effect size for the subclinical group 
(i.e., indicated prevention) at follow-up but not for the SAD group (i.e., treatment). Secondary outcomes, such 
as depression, general anxiety, social fear and avoidance, and quality of life, showed significant improvement 
post-intervention with small to large effect sizes. However, these improvements were not sustained to follow-up. 
The intervention group significantly improved in level of social (but not role) functioning at post- and follow-up 
assessments with small to medium effect sizes. Guardians reported no significant changes in their child’s social 
anxiety.

Table 4.  Results from the linear mixed-effects models from baseline to post and between- and within-
group effect sizes displayed in cohen’s d. Notes: All linear mixed-effects models included the baseline value 
of investigated outcome value as a fixed covariate and a random effect of participants. SPIN = Social Phobia 
Inventory; PHQ-9 = 9-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire; GAD-7: 7-item version of the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder; SAS-A = Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents; KIDSSCREEN = quality of life

Anxieties in Childhood and Adolescence.

Adolescents in the intervention group were interviewed to gain information on their experiences using the 
SOPHIE programme. In the qualitative analysis four main topics were explored (1) therapeutic relationship, (2) 
factors that contributed to and prevented engagement with the intervention, (3) reflections on symptom and 
behaviour change, and (4) adolescents’ evaluation of the SOPHIE intervention content.

The non-significant intervention effect on social anxiety after the intervention is inconsistent with previous 
online  intervention  studies  in  adolescents  with  SAD34–36.  However,  social  anxiety  was  significantly  reduced 
at  follow-up  suggesting  a  delayed  response.  One  possible  explanation  is  that  adolescents  may  require  more 
time than an eight-week intervention period to practice the learned strategies and to implement the acquired 
knowledge and skills to everyday life25,43. This aligns with previous evidence that cognitive and behavioural gains 
from anxiety treatments in adolescents continue to develop after the intervention period and can show a delayed 
response26,44. A further explanation for the delayed response could be drawn from the Cognitive Model of Social 
Phobia30 which posits that social anxiety is maintained by mechanisms such as avoidance behaviour29. In this 
study,  avoidance  behaviour  significantly  decreased  at  post-intervention  but  not  at  follow-up  suggesting  early 
reductions may have led to later symptom reduction. This temporal pattern, in which changes in maintaining 
mechanisms precede social anxiety symptom changes, has been observed in another study,45. Thus, targeting the 
proposed mechanism in interventions might be needed to facilitate subsequent improvements in social anxiety.
Notably,  the  significant  difference  in  social  anxiety  at  follow-up  was  mainly  driven  by  the  reductions  in 
the  subclinical  but  not  in  the  clinical  group.  This  is  in  line  with  previous  research  on  indicated  prevention 
of  social  anxiety  symptoms  in  face-to-face  settings,  specifically  in  group  formats46.  In  contrast,  indicated 
prevention  delivered  online  showed  significant  small  effects  for  depressive  but  not  for  anxiety  symptoms  in 
meta-analyses19,47. This inconsistent evidence may partly be due to varying recruitment strategies in identifying

adolescents at risk for the development of a mental disorder and that social anxiety symptoms specifically are 
poorly recognised by affected adolescents and their social context2,48,49 resulting in heterogenous samples with 
different needs, problem awareness and treatment motivation50.

The  clinical  SAD-group  showed  only  little  improvement  in  this  study.  This  may  be  due  to  high  rates  of 
comorbidities and impaired functioning that characterized our clinical sample. Consequently, some participants 
may have been too burdened to benefit from a guided self-help approach with a focus on social anxiety. This 
may  also  explain  the  rather  low  SAD-remission  rates  found  in  our  study  and  a  similar  online  intervention 
for  adolescents34.  These  participants  may  require  more  intensive  treatments  addressing  multiple  problems. 
Additionally, some adolescents participated simultaneously in psychotherapy in a face-to-face setting, suggesting 
a need for a coordination of these interventions using blended formats51.

Adolescents were primarily enrolled through their guardians, highlighting their essential role in adolescents’ 
help-seeking behaviour52. However, guardians reported no significant changes in social anxiety at all assessment 
points,  unlike  adolescents.  This  may  be  explained  by  discrepancies  generally  found  between  adolescent  and 
guardian reports, particularly pronounced in internalised disorders53–55.

The SOPHIE-intervention led to positive effects on social functioning. This effect is in line with previous 
RCTs  of  online  interventions  for  SAD  in  adolescents  that  also  reported  significant  improvements  in  global 
functioning post-intervention29,34,35. In this study, social but not role functioning increased significantly at both 
post-intervention  and  follow-up,  suggesting  a  generalisation  effect  on  adolescents’  social  environment.  This 
highlights that the intervention may have differential effects on everyday life and may be especially relevant for 
the social behaviour of adolescents. Unchanged role functioning may indicate that improvements in academic 
and vocational functioning takes more time to manifest, emphasizing the importance of early interventions to 
prevent negative long-term impacts56.

Although  significant  differences  in  depression,  general  anxiety  and  quality  of  life  were  found  at  post-
assessment, these effects have attenuated until follow-up. Additional interventions targeting specific disorders 
or a transdiagnostic approach may be warranted to improve these effects over the long term, particularly in the

presence of comorbidities57. These results are in line with other studies on online interventions for adolescents 
that demonstrated no significant effects of anxiety-focused interventions on depression and quality of life58.

Adolescents experienced the SOPHIE-intervention as beneficial and supportive but challenging like previous 
qualitative  results  in  context  of  online  interventions  for  adolescents  with  SAD39.  Exposure  exercises  were 
perceived as the most difficult ones. Thus, guidance could be specifically intensified during the planning and 
implementation of these exercises. This would support adolescents at the right time without generally restricting 
their autonomy. This seems especially relevant because some adolescents felt controlled and pressured by the 
regular  weekly  guidance,  suggesting  the  need  for  varied  guidance  formats.  The  effect  of  letting  adolescents 
choose their preferred guidance format at the start of the intervention could be investigated in future studies 
e.g.,59.

Most adolescents noticed initial improvements in symptoms during the intervention but needed more time 
for implementing it to their everyday lives, which is consistent with efficacy results on social anxiety that were 
only significant at follow-up. If content was not directly relevant to their situation, they reported implementing 
it less often or not at all. Additional guidance on demand could be helpful to support to better tailor the exercises 
and modules to the very specific needs of the participants i.e.,39. This may improve the implementation of online 
interventions and their efficacy. To this aim, future research could make use of techniques such as the think-aloud 
method to explore adolescents’ real-time use of the intervention to gain more detailed user-led information on 
their specific needs60,61.

These results should be interpreted considering some limitations. The sample was a self-selected group of 
adolescents who had expressed an interest in the SOPHIE intervention which may limit the generalisability of 
the results. In addition, the targeted sample size for the subclinical group was not reached. Nonetheless, post 
hoc power analyses indicated that the study still had sufficient power to detect effects in the overall, clinical and

Factors contributing 
to or preventing 
engagement with 
the intervention

This main theme encompasses the experienced or 
non-experienced qualities of the relationship with the 
e-coach (the person conducting the guidance in the 
SOPHIE programme).

This subtheme contains experiences of stress and 
burden. By looking at completed exercises and 
commenting on them or giving feedback, the e-coach 
made adolescents feel guilty or pressurised, they were 
afraid of disappointing the e-coach if they do nothing/
something wrong. Furthermore, adolescents explain 
that they did not know how to interact (are they 
expected to write back/not?).

Emma (17. 02): “I found it a bit uncomfortable, (…) I hadn’t worked on a module for a week 
because I was really stressed, I still had school and so that week, I didn’t think about it at all, it 
was a bit stupid, and then I got a message from the e-coach saying (…) I haven’t completed one, I 
totally had the feeling of pressure, oh god I’ve forgotten something, I hope they still like me.”
Nora (16.02): “Mmh, well, I didn’t really answer because it always made me very nervous to know 
that someone was looking at what I was working on.”

In this subtheme, e-coaches are described as warm, 
supportive and understanding. Adolescents felt seen 
and recognised that they are being addressed personally 
(emotional component). E-coaches give feedback, 
answer questions, explain how to proceed and are 
perceived as helpful (structuring component). This 
structuring goes beyond reminders.

Emily (16.05): “I thought it was good because you could write the e-coach all the time. They 
replied pretty quickly and gave me tips. I thought that was good. So, I also thought it was good 
that everyone was supported during the time and that they didn’t just say ‘yes, go through the 6 
modules and if you have any questions well that’s too bad, but we can’t help you’, but that you were 
supported, that you could always turn to the e-coach, yeah.”
Lea (17.07): “Ehm, so I found that helpful. (Alessja: Mhm) And I found it nice that a person tells 
you that you can continue [with the next module] and not just an automatic message. I found that 
a more personal thing.”

This subtheme captures the experience of having “no” 
relationship. Adolescents perceived the interaction 
as impersonal and wonder whether it is a Chatbot/
artificial intelligence. They perceive no contact person 
(as compared to face to face, for example).

This main theme contains factors that contribute 
to or prevent adolescents from engaging with the 
intervention. In contrast to adherence that assesses 
engagement with a predefined (amount of content), 
this theme encompasses subjective factors that support 
adolescents’ engagement with the intervention

Emma (17.02): “Well, I didn’t really see a relationship if I’m honest, I didn’t know exactly, I didn’t 
want to answer because I didn’t want to cause anyone any stress, so yes, I thought it was a bit, they 
always wrote me the same thing and then I thought it was a bit like a bot, like a not a person or 
something.”

Problem awareness 
and motivation 
to change (initial 
Engagement)

In this subtheme, adolescents recognize their problems, 
symptoms or challenges and would like to learn how to 
handle these situations differently with support of the 
intervention.

Anja (16.06): “Ehm I just realised that I have social anxiety and that it would be cool to try to do 
something about it. And then I realised that there was this study and the things on the videos 
applied to me and I thought it was a good opportunity to start something.”
Emma (17.02): “Ehm, so mainly my fears, firstly that I can’t participate verbally and then that I 
might be afraid to show myself to others, that I’m afraid of what others might think about me and 
to find out what’s going on in my body and why I’m afraid, what’s causing it.”

Interest in the 
content/topic 
supports engagement

This subtheme entails adolescents interested in the 
programme, the topics or research as a reason to engage 
with the intervention (not necessarily linked to own 
situation).

Anja (16.06): “Ehm I just wanted to try it out and see if it helps me [and] I was interested - I don’t 
know.”
Sophie (15.05): “Ehm honestly, I was just curious about what was still to come. As for the ending, 
the way it ends, so to speak.”

Experienced 
self-efficacy leads 
to continuing 
engagement

This subtheme contains recollections of symptom 
improvements due to the SOPHIE programme. 
Adolescents experience themselves as self-effective 
with the support of the programme and motivated to 
experienced symptom change and indicate this as the 
reason to keep using it.

Design, structure and 
reminders support 
engagement

This subtheme entails references to the module-
based structure (one per week), the reminders by 
the e-coaches or parents support that supported 
adolescents’ engagement with the intervention

Nora (16.03): “Mmh, I usually worked on one [module] every week, so I usually had time to 
realise that the modules really help, and I always found it very interesting to learn about anxiety 
and that motivated me to keep going.”
Lea (17.07): “I would also say that I saw a small improvement, that also motivated me to keep 
going.”

Emily (16.05): “[I liked] that you could actually click through the programme every week and you 
could write down things that you noticed or that happened every week and then you could see 
them again and then see whether you got better at them or whether they stayed the same.”
Lara (11.10): “Mostly my mum also told me that I still had to do it or sometimes I was told by my 
e-coach so I received a message and it said that I still forgot to do one module or something.”

Online delivery 
promotes autonomy 
and flexibility

In this subtheme, adolescents appreciate the anonymity 
and independence an online intervention holds for 
them. Some adolescents mention the fact that they 
do not have to meet a person or travel anywhere, 
others appreciate that the programme is at no cost, the 
freedom to decide for themselves which exercises they 
want to do, the time flexibility and the sustainability 
(the intervention can continue to be used after official 
completion).

Other commitments 
and lack of time 
prevents engagement

In this subtheme, adolescents describe that they did not 
use or forgot to use the online programme due to exam 
stress, too little or no time, or other leisure activities 
such as holidays.

Elin (15.03): “I went to a therapist, but it didn’t work properly because I didn’t feel comfortable 
with the person. And then I thought I’d try it myself first. And that it was still somewhat guided, I 
thought that was a very good option.”
Sara (16.11): “I found it very interesting that it’s an online programme and you don’t have to go 
somewhere and see a therapist or anything like that. And yeah, I thought it was good that different 
exercises were offered, and you didn’t always have to try them all.”

Anna (16.10): “I just, I think I had almost no time two weeks before the end because there was 
so much going on. At school and everything. And I don’t know, maybe I could have divided it up 
differently or something, I had the feeling that I should do something, but at the same time I didn’t 
find any time.”
Elin (15.03): “I’m a very forgetful person, which means I forget a lot. Even things that I actually 
know I still have to do.”

Adolescents reflect

and behaviour 
changes

Adolescent 
recount observable 
implementations in

Continued

In this main theme, adolescents reflect on possible 
subjective changes in their behaviour and symptoms.

In this subtheme, adolescent recount observable 
implementations in their daily life. They describe 
how they apply content (e.g. strategies, exposure 
exercises) in their everyday life; thereby, this theme is 
focused on implementation and not on understanding 
psychoeducational content.

Emma (17.02): “I was able to come up with my own phrases [words of encouragement] and I also 
got input on what I could use for phrases. I was able to recall [them] in my head the moment the 
panic raised. I thought that was really cool that I was sitting there in class and when the panic 
started, I sayed to myself ‘I’m enough and I can do it! And if not, there are other opportunities, no 
stress, it’s all good’.”
Mia (15.07): “Ehm. So, it certainly worked well for me to plan situations like that [exposure 
exercises] and then put them into practice. It also helped to know, okay, now I’m going to do this 
and setting a date also helped.”

Difficulties 
implementing 
changes in daily life

This subtheme contains accounts of adolescents of 
difficulties in implementing what they had learnt in the 
intervention into their everyday lives. Some adolescents 
also indicate that they would need additional support.

Subjective Symptom 
Change

This subtheme captures adolescents’ reflections on their 
subjective changes in symptoms

Personal problem(s) 
worsened or remain 
unchanged

This subtheme contains accounts of adolescents who 
report a lack of improvement or worsening of their 
symptoms or problems.

Personal problems 
ameliorated

In this subtheme, adolescents describe subjective 
improvement in symptoms or report on fewer 
problems.

Anja (16.06): “The SOPHIE-programme definitely gave me some tips. I don’t know if I’m good at 
applying them because it’s sometimes difficult to think clearly in this situation. But I definitely got 
some tips.”
Linn (15.05): “I thought the fear pyramid was quite good, because you could show yourself what 
you are actually most afraid of and what is the worst thing for you. Ehm, but it was just a bit too 
difficult to put into practice, especially alone, I’d say. Because you are not able to ask questions.”

Louise (16.10): “Certainly on the one hand a few messages that I took away from the modules, 
e.g., thinking of a [safe and happy] place, but I think the whole programme, hadn’t helped me that 
much personally. I think it helped that I became clearer about what I could do better and that I 
now know what to do next and how to work on it. So I think it has helped me indirectly, maybe 
that I now have this motivation to change something and yes, even if the exercises didn’t work for 
me personally, I do think that it has triggered something in me that I want to improve.”

Mia (15.07): “Ehm, I have two main problems, so to speak. One is giving presentations and 
standing in front of the class and speaking up and the other is talking to new people or generally 
starting conversations with strangers. And yeah, I think starting conversations and getting to 
know strangers has got better now and with the presentations, I haven’t had the chance to try it out 
yet because we haven’t had any presentations at school yet. But I think it will certainly get better.”

Adolescents think 
they need more 
time to experience 
significant change

Adolescents’ 
evaluation 
of SOPHIE 
intervention content

In this subtheme, adolescents explain that they need 
more time before an improvement could take place.

Anja (16.06): “I have the feeling that it did get better. But I also have the feeling that I need more 
time so that I can apply the things from the programme even more (…) and have the confidence 
to do the things.”

This main theme captures adolescents’ reflections on the 
SOPHIE intervention content.

Psychoeducational 
content was received 
as instructive, 
informative, 
understandable.

In this subtheme, adolescents report that videos, audios 
and texts were understandable, and that it was helpful 
to them to learn more about the topic. They report that 
content helped them understand their challenges and 
situation better.

Psychoeducational 
content was not 
relevant, too 
theoretical or not 
understandable for 
adolescent.

This subtheme contains descriptions of adolescents that 
the psychoeducational intervention content was not 
relevant to them and their situation. A few adolescents 
also report that they had difficulties to understand it.

Exercises and 
practical applications 
were experienced as 
helpful and suitable

This subtheme captures adolescents’ descriptions of how 
they found the exercises and strategies useful, helpful 
and applicable for themselves.

Exercises and 
practical applications 
were experienced 
as not suitable for 
adolescent’s specific 
life situation.

In this subtheme, adolescents report that they cannot 
use the proposed exercises in their everyday life. In 
contrast to implementation difficulties, they don’t 
indicate to need additional support, but rather that the 
exercise does not fit their everyday life (e.g. the duration 
of the relaxation exercise is too long).

Emily (16.05): “I thought it was good that there were videos in between so you could watch them 
again, then you understood what you had read. I thought it was very good that I could recognise 
myself a bit in the videos. That they were adolescents and not adults.”
Lea (17.07): “Ehm, so certainly a lot of people feel like me. And that if you keep at it, there are 
possibilities to change.”
Lucie (16.05): Ehm so in any case I got more information and examples from others of what 
[social anxiety] can look like and how you can observe it in yourself and that’s definitely made me 
a bit more confident. And I know better how to deal with it.”

Noah (16.04): “Mmh, I just had difficulties that I didn’t need it [the information] for myself 
because, as I said, I made progress relatively quickly at the beginning and developed further in that 
sense and yeah then you just didn’t do it [the programme] somehow.”
Interviewer to Neele: “If you didn’t understand something, could you ask your parents?”
Neele (11.00): “Exactly, my parents were usually able to help me, or they googled it. And if that 
didn’t work, then I went to my e-coach. But mostly my parents knew the solution.”

Louise (16.10): “I thought that was good, so if I really made an effort and wrote in the logbook, 
then it stuck [in my mind]. And that’s why I think it’s good. I also thought it was good to look back 
and remember things. I think if nothing had happened after the exercise, I would have forgotten it 
even quicker than I have now.”
Interviewer: “So, the anxiety pyramid was the thing that helped you the most, why would you say 
it was so helpful?”
Neele (11.00): “Yes, I was able to make a timetable and write down very specifically that I would 
do it this way and that way. And that’s what it said on the timetable, then I must do it like this.”

Mia (15.07): “So these exercises took quite a long time and you have to be able to apply them very 
briefly in these [social] situations, there wasn’t enough time for me to be able to do them. Ehm 
exactly, that was certainly the difficulty.”
Emma (17.02) on relaxation exercises “Yes, exactly. It was always about 10 minutes long and I 
really haven’t had that much time recently, especially with exams and school, so I’ve never really 
found time to lie down or sit down for 10 minutes and listen to it. I think I’m also a very impatient 
person and then I didn’t really manage to pick myself up and say sit down now, I pushed it to the 
back of my mind and only did it once or twice, which was a bit of a shame.”

subclinical group at follow-up. Despite this, the limited sample size may have constrained the ability to detect 
smaller effects that could emerge in a larger sample with more participants exhibiting subclinical symptoms. 
Importantly, the use of a clinical interview to exclude participants with a past and present diagnosis of a SAD 
to define the subclinical group represents a methodological strength, and future research should aim to better 
recognise adolescents with subclinical levels of social anxiety and investigate larger-scale SAD-specific prevention 
programs. As the intervention effects only became evident at the time of the 5-month follow-up, no conclusions 
can be made about longer-term improvements and the full impact of the intervention; to evaluate this a longer 
follow-up  period  in  future  studies  is  needed.  Adolescents  in  the  qualitative  study  were  mostly  committed  to 
the intervention, thus limiting the in-depth exploration of barriers to intervention engagement. Future studies 
could capitalise on the strengths of mixed-method approach and look even more in-depth at the experiences 
of adolescents, especially those who make less use of the intervention. Moreover, the investigation of various 
means of support for adolescents before and during the usage of the intervention (e.g., by including modules 
tailored to their needs, personalised formats of guidance)36 may further increase the efficacy of intervention. 
Additionally,  introducing  exposure  exercises  early  during  the  intervention  could  be  beneficial,  particularly 
considering decreasing adherence over time46.

Conclusion
This study adds to previous evidence on the efficacy of disorder-specific online interventions for social anxiety 
based  on  conceptual  models  such  as  the  cognitive  model30  and  supports  the  longer-term  efficacy  of  online 
interventions  for  social  anxiety,  particularly  for  subclinical  social  anxiety.  It  further  suggests  new  avenues  to 
personalise  future  interventions.  Leveraging  online  interventions  has  the  potential  to  substantially  improve 
mental health in adolescence and beyond.

Method
Study design
This RCT investigated the effects of the online intervention SOPHIE compared to a care-as-usual (CAU) control 
group  in  adolescents  with  subclinical  social  anxiety  or  SAD.  The  trial  had  a  2 × 2 × 4  design:  experimental 
condition  (SOPHIE  vs.  CAU),  diagnostic  condition  (SAD  vs.  subclinical  social  anxiety),  and  repeated 
assessments (baseline, mid-intervention at four weeks, post-intervention at eight weeks, and follow-up at five 
months after randomisation). Qualitative interviews were conducted post-intervention with participants in the 
intervention condition.

The  trial  was  registered  in  clinicaltrials.gov  (date  of  first  registration:  04/03/2021;  registration  number: 
NCT04782102)  and  was  conducted  following  the  declaration  of  Helsinki.  It  was  approved  by  the  Ethics 
Committee of the Canton Bern in March 2020 and the amendment to implement the qualitative study in May 
2022 (CEC Bern, Project ID 2020–02501). Detailed information (except for the qualitative interview) is provided 
in  the  study  protocol41.  The  trial  further  included  assessment  on  potential  mediators  and  moderators  of  the 
effects of the intervention which will be published separately.

Participants
Sampling strategy
A self-selected sample of participants was recruited in the German speaking countries (Switzerland, Germany, 
Austria, Liechtenstein) from August 2021 to August 2023. To reduce self-selection bias and support the sampling 
of adolescents with subclinical social anxiety, a recruitment strategy was established to distribute information 
about social anxiety, SAD and the possibilities of digitally offered help among three target groups: adolescents, 
their caregivers and their professional network. All information and promotional materials were adapted to the 
target groups’ needs and brought to them by different means of communication. Adolescents were targeted by 
advertisements on social media channels (i.e., Instagram and TikTok), school visits, workshops, flyers and posters 
in buildings frequented regularly by adolescents (e.g., youth centres). Caregivers were targeted by information 
postings in educational magazines, newsletters from parents’ associations, internet forums and advertisements 
on Google. The professional network adolescents are embedded in (i.e., teachers, social workers, school mental 
health specialists, therapists and primary physicians) was informed by collaborations with partner organisations, 
workshops and information talks given by the first and last authors.

Participants for the qualitative interviews were recruited from the intervention group of the RCT beginning 
in  July  2022,  following  receiving  ethical  approval  for  the  qualitative  component  of  the  study.  After  this  time 
point,  36  adolescents  were  randomised  to  the  intervention  group.  Of  these,  4  withdrew  consent  prior  to  the 
post-intervention assessment, leaving 32 eligible participants. All 32 were invited to participate in the qualitative 
interviews, and 17 participated. See the supplementary material for an analysis of differences between adolescents 
who participated in the interview and those who did not.

Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria required participants to be 11 to 17 years old, understand German, have access to a device 
connected to the Internet, and score 16 or higher on the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). This threshold was 
chosen following previous research62. Exclusion criteria were a known diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, 
acute suicidality at baseline, and a past diagnosis of SAD for the subclinical group. All participants who consented 
and were randomised to the intervention group were eligible for the qualitative interview.

Procedure
Informed consent (14 to 17 years) and informed assent with guardian consent (11 to 13 years) were obtained. 
Baseline  assessment  included  questionnaires  and  a  diagnostic  telephone  interview.  Participants  were  then 
randomly allocated to the intervention or CAU group via stratified block randomisation based on diagnostic 
status (SAD vs. subclinical social anxiety). Randomisation parameters (number of groups, allocation ratio (1:1), 
and block size) were set up by the first author using Qualtrics embedded in the last baseline assessment. The 
study team and participants were informed of their group allocation after randomisation. Participants filled in 
questionnaires  three  times  (four  weeks,  eight  weeks,  five  months)  after  randomisation.  Post-,  and  follow-up 
assessments also included a diagnostic telephone interview with interviewers blinded to the study condition. 
Participants were allowed to seek additional mental health support.

Online intervention SOPHIE
The eight-week online intervention SOPHIE is based the Cognitive Model of Social Phobia30 adapted to specific 
needs  of  adolescents29  and  existing  evidence-based  online  interventions  for  adults  with  SAD63–69.  It  consists 
of  8  modules41:  introduction  and  goal  setting,  six  modules  dedicated  to  the  maintaining  mechanisms  of  the 
Cognitive Model30including negative automatic thought processing, self-focused attention, and avoidance and 
safety behaviour, and a final module with a short repetition and outlook. Adolescents were guided by trained and

supervised graduate students in Psychology41. For more information of the development of the intervention and 
a detailed description of the modules, please consider the study protocol41.

Care-as-usual (CAU) control condition
Participants in the CAU group were only contacted regarding assessments and received access to SOPHIE after 
the follow-up assessment. They received no specific intervention and were free to access all kinds of support 
services. The use of other support services was assessed at post-assessment.

Materials
Primary outcome
The  self-report  scale  Social  Phobia  Inventory  (SPIN;  original  English  version70;  German  version71)  is  an 
internationally  used  and  recommended70  continuous  measure  assessing  3  dimensions  of  social  anxiety  (i.e., 
fear,  avoidance,  and  physical  symptoms).  In  each  of  the  17  items,  symptoms  of  the  past  week  are  rated  on  a 
5-point Likert scale (scored from not at all (0) to extremely (4); total range: 0–68)72. An example item is “I avoid 
talking to people I don’t know”. In adolescent samples, the SPIN has shown good psychometric properties to 
detect subthreshold and threshold SAD73,74 and demonstrated good test-retest reliability (r = 0.81) and internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.89)74 and evidenced good convergent and discriminant validity75. The SPIN value 
at post-assessment was defined as the primary outcome.

Secondary outcomes
Self-report measures  At baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up, general anxiety symp-
toms were assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)76,77 depressive symptoms with the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 for Adolescents (PHQ-A)78 fear and avoidance with the Social Anxiety Scale for Adoles-
cents (SAS-A)79,80 quality of life with the KIDSCREEN-1081, and self-esteem with the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale 
(RSES)82.

The GAD-7 questionnaire (original English version83; German adolescent version76) measures self-reported 
frequency of anxiety symptoms with 7 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale scored from not at all (0) to nearly 
every  day  (3)  (total  range  0–21).  An  example  item  is  “Feeling  nervous,  anxious  or  on  edge”.  In  adolescents, 
the questionnaire has demonstrated good psychometric properties with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
α = 0.91) and construct validity77.

The  PHQ-A  (original  adolescent  English  version78,84;  German  version85)  assesses  frequency  of  depressive 
symptoms over the last 2 weeks in adolescents with 9 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale from not at all (0) 
to nearly every day (3) (total range 0–27). A sample item is “Little interest or pleasure in doing things”. This 
self-report questionnaire shows good psychometric properties for detecting depression in adolescents78,84 and a 
pooled Cronbach’s α = 0.86 across the life-span86.

The SAS-A (original English version79; German version87,88) measures fear of negative evaluation and social 
avoidance in adolescents with 18 items answered on a 5-point Likert scale from not at all (1) to all the time (5) 
(total range 18–90). A sample item is “I worry about what others say about me“. The measure has shown good 
validity and reliability in both clinical and nonclinical samples and the internal consistency for the total scale 
was Cronbach’s α = 0.9179,80.

The KIDSCREEN assessments were simultaneously developed in different European countries and languages 
including German89. The KIDSCREEN-10 assesses health-related quality of life with 10 items answered on a 
5-point Likert scale rated from never/not at all (1) to always/extremely (5) (total range 1–50). A sample item is 
“Have you felt fit and well?”. The scale has demonstrated good psychometric properties and reported a Cronbach’s 
α = 0.8281.

The RSES (original English version82; German version90) assesses self-esteem in 10 items on a Guttman scale 
rated from strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (3) (total range 0–30). A sample item is: “On the whole, I am 
satisfied with myself ”. In this study the adolescent version of the questionnaire was used. This version has shown 
good psychometric properties with a Cronbach’s α = 0.8191.

Clinician-rated  interviews  Adolescents  were  assessed  for  past  and  current  mental  disorders  at  baseline  ac-
cording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 with the Diagnostic Interview for Mental 
Disorders for Children and Adolescents(German: Kinder DIPS;)92,93. At post-intervention and follow-up, only 
the section for SAD and diagnoses met at baseline were assessed. Global functioning was assessed at baseline, 
post-intervention and follow-up with the Global Functioning Social and Role Scale, a structured interview yield-
ing a score from 1 to 10 for each subscale94,95.

Adherence  Adherence was operationalised through the extent to which the online intervention was used. The 
number of finished modules, of completed exercises, and the time spent in the online intervention were recorded 
automatically.

Guardian  report 
If  guardians  provided  their  e-mail  address,  they  rated  their  child’s  social  anxiety  with  the 
Parents’ Questionnaire on Social Anxieties in Childhood and Adolescence (German: Elternfragebogen zu sozialen 
Ängsten im Kindes- und Jugendalter (ESAK); range 0–54)96 at baseline, mid-treatment, post-intervention and 
follow-up.

Assessment of negative effects and satisfaction with intervention
Negative effects of the intervention were assessed post-intervention with the Inventory for recording negative effects 
in  psychotherapy  (INEP)97,98  and  satisfaction  with  the  intervention  with  the  Client  Satisfaction  Questionnaire 
(CSQ-8; mean value between 1–4)99.

Demographic information
Adolescents  reported  their  age,  gender,  nationality,  native  language  and  living  situation  during  the  baseline 
telephone  interview.  Socioeconomic  status  was  measured  with  the  Social  Affluence  Scale  (range  0–12)100,101. 
Guardians reported their level of education, employment status and living situation during their first assessment.

Qualitative interview
The  qualitative  assessment  consisted  of  a  semi-structured  interview.  The  questions  covered  topics  that  were 
based on the stages adolescents move through when participating in an intervention study: awareness of their 
problems and of digital help, consideration of and expectations towards study participation, and experiences 
during the intervention102,103. Regarding the intervention, helpfulness of individual modules and experiences 
with guidance were explored. Questions were open-ended, but the interviewer could provide a structured scale 
(i.e., from very helpful to not at all helpful) as a starting point for a more detailed discussion. The final interview 
guide can be found in the supplementary material.

Analysis
Sample size
The  initial  sample  size  was  determined  in  two  a-priori  analyses  (SAD-group  and  subclinical  group)  for  the 
primary research question in G*Power104 based on an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach and repeated measures 
analyses  of  variance  (ANOVA).  The  analysis  for  the  SAD  group  was  based  on  small-to-moderate  effect 
sizes  (Cohen’s  d =.35)105,106  and  the  analysis  for  the  subclinical  anxiety  group  on  a  small  effect  size  (Cohen’s 
d =.20)47,107–109.  We  assumed  an  α-level  of  5%,  a  power  of  80%,  and  a  correlation  between  measurements  of 
r = 0.4. The targeted sample size was N = 222 including n = 56 adolescents with SAD and n = 166 adolescents with 
subclinical social anxiety.

As the targeted sample size for the entire sample and the subclinical anxiety group was not reached, post hoc 
power analyses were conducted using G*Power. The parameters matched those of the a priori analysis, with an 
alpha level of 5% and an assumed correlation between repeated measures of r = 0.40. For the main analysis (effect 
size d = 0.67, N = 133), the calculated power was 0.97. Similarly, the power was 0.99 for the SAD group (d = 1.21, 
n = 93) and 0.99 for the subclinical anxiety group (d = 1.53, n = 40).

Efficacy analysis
All  participants  were  analysed  using  the  ITT  approach.  Baseline  differences  were  assessed  with  Chi-square 
tests  for  nominal  data  and  independent  t-tests  for  continuous  data.  Patterns  of  missingness  in  primary  and 
secondary outcomes were visually inspected. The possible influence of demographic variables, study condition, 
and baseline assessments on missingness was analysed with Chi-square tests for binary predictors and logistic 
regressions for continuous predictors.

The  primary  outcome,  difference  of  social  anxiety  symptoms  between  study  groups  at  post-assessment, 
was analysed using linear mixed-effects models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation with the lmer 
function of the lme4 package110 in R (version 2023.12.1 + 402). Linear mixed-effects models were selected because 
they account for irregular assessment timepoints and dependencies in longitudinal data and provide unbiased 
estimates under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, using maximum likelihood estimation111–113. In the 
final model, time (baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention), intervention condition (SOPHIE, CAU), and 
interactions were specified as fixed effects. Baseline SPIN value was added as a fixed covariate, and participant 
was included as a random effect to allow for between-person variation. The same model was used to analyse 
intervention effects on secondary outcomes (i.e., general anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, quality of 
life, self-esteem, and guardians’ rating of social anxiety). Follow-up effects were analysed using the same model 
with all four assessment timepoints included. The SPIN model for post- and follow-up effects was first computed 
with all participants and then separately in subgroup analyses with participants of the clinical group and the 
subclinical group. Remission of SAD diagnosis was only assessed in the clinical group, and Chi-square tests were 
used to compare intervention and control groups at post- and follow-up assessments.

Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary outcome SPIN using a per-protocol sample. 
For the post-assessment model, the per-protocol sample (n = 77) included participants who completed all three 
assessment timepoints: baseline, mid-intervention, and post-intervention. For the follow-up model, participants 
(n = 57) had to complete all four timepoints: baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. We 
used the same models as described above for these analyses.

Qualitative data collection and analysis
The qualitative interview was conducted after the intervention with adolescents from the SOPHIE study group 
via  telephone.  Individual  interviews  were  audio-recorded  and  afterwards  transcribed  verbatim.  A  reflexive 
thematic analysis (RTA) approach was chosen due to its flexibility to explore the full range of experiences and 
to  account  for  subjectively  perceived  realities114,115.  For  this  study,  a  contextualist  standpoint  was  adopted, 
allowing  us  to  interpret  adolescents’  experiences  within  their  social  contexts.  A  reflexive,  iterative  analysis 
process  was  followed,  where  themes  were  co-constructed  based  on  participant  experiences,  aiming  for  a 
nuanced understanding of central ideas and concepts114,116. Following the six steps of RTA, authors NW and 
DH familiarised themselves with the data and coded text parts that reflected experiences of participants during

and with the intervention. Both authors discussed and reviewed initial codes to develop first possible themes. 
Subsequently, the full transcripts were re-coded with the identified themes and subthemes, leading to further 
adjustments  to  the  themes.  A  thematic  map  was  created  and  discussed  with  the  research  team.  During  the 
theme  review  process,  we  found  that  the  interview  data  was  not  sufficiently  rich  to  develop  themes  united 
by a central concept or idea that were not solely reflecting the topics of the interview guide. Thus, instead of 
overinterpreting  or  presenting  underdeveloped  themes115,117,118we  focused  on  creating  themes  with  a  shared 
topic and common points expressed by participants in relation to this topic. This approach led to sub-domains 
of similar experiences, which we consolidated into domain summaries exploring different facets of each topic. 
Finally, both authors coded the transcripts again. Domains and sub-domains were exemplified with quotes from 
the transcripts using pseudonyms for quotation presentation. All quotes were translated from (Swiss) German 
and minimally altered to enhance clarity while preserving meaning.

Researcher reflexivity  Authors NW and DH conducted the analysis. NW led this RCT as part of her doctoral 
dissertation  thereby  providing  extensive  familiarity  with  the  study  and  the  SOPHIE  programme.  DH  was  a 
Psychology master student new to the project and exclusively handled qualitative data. Both approached the 
data inductively. Nonetheless, NW acknowledged that her involvement in the study might have influenced her 
perception of adolescents’ experiences with the intervention. Furthermore, the interviews were conducted by 
telephone without video conferencing. This way of data collection might have influenced the data richness; some 
adolescents provided only very brief responses, and even after probing further questions, they did not provide 
much more content. For adolescents with social anxiety, discussing personal experiences over the phone might 
be challenging, and for the interviewer, the lack of nonverbal cues may have influenced the understanding of 
their statements.
