Physical activity interventions have recently become a popular strategy to help postmenopausal women prevent and manage obesity.
The current systematic review evaluates the efficacy of physical activity interventions among overweight and obese postmenopausal
women and sheds light on the behavioral change techniques that were employed in order to direct future research. Method. Five
electronic databases were searched to identify all prospective RCT studies that examine the impact of physical activity on adiposity
indicators, physical capacity, and/or mental health outcomes among healthy, sedentary overweight, and obese postmenopausal
women in North America. The behavior change technique taxonomy was used to identify the various strategies applied in the
programs. Results. Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The findings showed that adiposity indicators and physical capacity
outcomes significantly improved following long-term interventions; however, mental health outcomes showed nonsignificant
changes. Furthermore, 17 behavior change techniques were identified with the taxonomy across all trials. The intrapersonal-level
techniques were the most common. Conclusion. Physical activity interventions had a positive effect on adiposity measures and
physical capacity. Future research should focus on testing the effectiveness of physical activity interventions on mental health and
incorporate strategies at the individual and environmental level to maximize the health impact on the population.

1. Introduction

Overweight/obesity is one of the most widespread health
problems on a global scale [1] and the most significant con-
tributor to poor health, exceeding both undernutrition and
infectious diseases [2]. The issue has become a primary
concern for public health officials and practitioners as more
than 50% of Canadians and Americans are classified as either
obese or overweight [3, 4]. In recent years, the prevalence
of obesity and overweight has remained stable except among
middle aged and older women; trends have continued to rise
for this group [3]. In North America, the prevalence of obesity
is higher among middle aged women (40–59 years old),
followed closely by 60-year-old and older women (39.5% and
35.4%, resp.) [5]. The North American Menopause Society [6]

noted that by 2025 the number of postmenopausal women is
projected to increase substantially, and those who are over-
weight and obese will presumably need additional clinical
care and weight intervention. Evidently, this subpopulation
requires attention in order to understand and prevent such
prospective trends.

Various health-related consequences have been associ-
ated with excessive body weight. Overweight and obesity can
have adverse effects on nearly every aspect of health from
contributing to chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis [7]
to interfering with sexual function [8], breathing [9], mood
[10], and social interactions [11]. More specifically, Yatsuya et
al. [12] found that the hazard ratio of stroke increased with
higher levels of body mass index (BMI) among obese black
and white women (1.10, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (0.97,

1.24); 1.25, 95% CI (1.07, 1.46), resp.). Among older women,
more severe vasomotor symptoms (e.g., night sweat and
hot flashes) during the menopause transition and post-
menopausal phase are experienced as BMI increases [6].
Overweight and obese postmenopausal women also expe-
rience increased risk for type II diabetes, breast cancer,
coronary heart disease, and depression. For instance, a meta-
analysis of 18 cohort studies [13] found that the relative risk
of type II diabetes for obese men and women compared
to normal weight individuals was 7.19 (95% CI (5.74, 9.00))
and for overweight men and women was 2.99 (95% CI
(2.42, 3.72)). Based on a pooled analysis of 7 cohort studies
[14], the relative risk of breast cancer among overweight
postmenopausal women was 1.26 (95% CI (1.09, 1.46)). A
longitudinal study by Li et al. [15] found that the relative risk
of coronary heart disease was 3.44 (95% CI (2.81, 4.21)) for
women who were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
) and sedentary
(exercise < 1 hr/wk), 2.48 (95% CI (1.84, 3.34)) for women
who were active but obese, and 1.48 (95% CI (1.24, 1.77))
for women who had a healthy weight but were sedentary
compared to the normal BMI and physically active group.
Even modest weight gain (8 to 20 pounds) during adulthood
was associated with 27% (95% CI (12% to 45%)) increased risk
of coronary heart disease compared to women with a stable
weight after adjusting for physical activity and other cardio-
vascular risk factors. Based on a meta-analysis of longitudinal
survey studies [16], the pooled odds ratio for the association
between obesity at baseline (time 1) and increased depression
at follow-up (time 2) was 1.55 (95% CI (1.22, 1.98)). The status
of overweight at baseline also increased the risk of onset of
depression at follow-up (odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI (1.07, 1.51)).
According to Rosano et al. [17], the major risks associated
with being overweight tend to be experienced by those
who drastically gain weight during midlife adulthood. Body
weight in women tends to steadily increase from the late
20s to 60 years of age with the greatest increase in weight
occurring shortly after menopause or during the 5th decade
[18]. The increase in weight during the menopause stage and
beyond is most harmful for women [19]. Therefore, many
overweight sedentary postmenopausal women experience
negative effects such as high blood pressure and the afore-
mentioned conditions, which can elicit other serious health
problems [20].

Engaging in regular moderate physical activity is strongly
associated with better physical and psychological health
outcomes and has been shown to reduce negative effects
associated with overweight and obesity [21, 22]. For example,
physical activity was found to reduce abdominal fat and total
percentage of body fat even without changes in body weight
[23]. A study by McCullough et al. [24] found that mild or
intense physical activity may reduce the risk of breast cancer.
Furthermore, a review by Paluska and Schwenk [25] reported
that physical activity was associated with reduced depressive
and acute anxiety symptoms.

Wen et al. [26] found that even small changes or adjust-
ments in health behaviors can have an impact on overall
health. Based on their cohort study, individuals in the low
activity group who exercised for an average of 92 minutes per
week (95% CI (71.0, 112.0)) or 15 minutes a day (SD = 1.8)

had a 14% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio
0.86, 95% CI (0.81–0.91)) and a 3-year longer life expectancy
compared to the inactive group. The benefits were found for
all age groups (20–39, 40–59, and ≥60) and for both men and
women. A meta-analysis conducted at the Harvard School
of Public Health [27] found that as little as 150 minutes (2.5
hours) of physical activity a week can significantly reduce the
risk of heart disease by approximately 14% among adult men
and women. About 300 minutes (5 hours) a week reduced
the risk of heart disease including heart attacks, angina, and
bypass surgeries by 20% compared to adults who did not
engage in physical activity. The study also found that physical
activity had a significantly stronger effect in reducing the risk
of heart disease in adult women (33%) compared to adult men
(22%). The benefits associated with minimal behavior change
in terms of physical activity are abundant, and such changes
are deemed crucial in the prevention and treatment of obesity.
Sustained physical activity is necessary to achieve health
benefits. According to Peterson and Ward-Smith [18], short-
term benefits of physical activity among overweight and
obese women are limited to less fatigue and increased cardio-
vascular fitness as opposed to weight loss, whereas the long-
term effects of physical activity are weight loss and improved
physical fitness to help overweight and obese women achieve
an ideal weight and standard of living [18]. Some studies
have also documented that long-term physical activity signif-
icantly improves psychological functioning [28]. A review by
Folkins and Sime [29] found that long-term physical activity
improved self-confidence and self-esteem in male and female
children and adults. Adult men who were subjected to a
long-term intervention demonstrated reduced mental stress
[30] and reduced Type A behaviors (i.e., competitive and
aggressive behaviors) [31]. However, consensus for the partic-
ular effects of long-term physical activity on postmenopausal
populations is less clear because a synthesis of the research
is yet to be provided in the literature. Evaluating the efficacy
of long-term (≥6 months) physical activity interventions
among both overweight and obese postmenopausal women
is warranted.

The current systematic review will evaluate the efficacy
of physical activity interventions on adiposity indicators,
physical capacity measures, and mental health outcomes
among sedentary overweight/obese postmenopausal women.
Another goal of the review is to identify the various behav-
ioral change techniques that were employed in the interven-
tions to help inform future research and interventions that
target this growing population.

2. Methods

2.1. Data Sources and Search Strategies. Five electronic data-
bases, MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, Psy-
cINFO, and Web of Science, were searched for relevant
studies from the past 10 years. Reference lists of all included
studies were searched for further relevant studies. The search
terms included obesity terms and physical activity terms as
well as filters for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), human
subjects, English articles, adult females, and being published
between January 2005 and June 2015.

2.2. Inclusion Criteria. Articles were selected based on several
inclusion criteria.

2.2.1. Types of Studies. Published RCTs providing ≥6 months
of follow-up data after randomization were included. Inter-
ventions that were less than 6 months were excluded because
previous researches have used a 6-month cut-off when evalu-
ating metabolic, biochemical, haematological, and muscular
change from physical activity interventions [32, 33].

2.2.2. Types of Participants. Studies were included if the sam-
ple is comprised of postmenopausal women living in Canada
or the United States because the current levels of physical
activity are very much alike. Based on Canadian statistics, it
was revealed that fewer than 20% of Canadians do enough
exercise [34]. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [35], less than 20% of Americans meet the aer-
obic and muscular activity recommendations. Furthermore,
participants had to be overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25.0),
sedentary, healthy, and capable of completing the physical
activity program. Studies were included if the sample was
comprised of postmenopausal women and men, provided
that the findings were reported separately for women. Studies
were excluded if the participants had a major medical disor-
der or condition such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or
recovering from a stroke.

2.2.3. Types of Interventions. All studies had to contain
a physical activity intervention component. Studies that
included several groups, diet-only, diet and physical activity,
physical activity-only, and the control study arm, were only
included if the results of physical activity-only versus the
control group were provided. Diet-only interventions were
excluded. All types of physical activity interventions such as
walking, bicycling, aerobics, stretching, yoga, and resistance
training were included while studies with rehabilitation
physical activity were excluded.

2.2.4. Types of Outcome Measures. The outcomes included
various adiposity, physical capacity, and mental health mea-
sures. The adiposity indicators include body weight, total
and percentage of fat mass, lean body mass, intra-abdominal
and subcutaneous fat, and waist and hip circumference. The
physical capacity measures include physical performance,
maximal fitness, and pedometer reading. Finally, the mental
health outcomes include anxiety, depression, stress, and
quality of life. Biochemical outcomes such as level of oxidative
stress, C-reactive protein, low- or high-density lipoprotein,
and levels of vitamin D were excluded because the literature
vastly covers this domain with meta-analyses [36, 37].

2.3. Study Selection. Initially, titles were reviewed to ascertain
the potential fit to the inclusion criteria. If the relevance was
doubted during the title review, a subsequent assessment was
conducted. The list of potential articles was further shortened
by reviewing abstracts and performing detailed evaluations of
Sections 2 and 3 of each remaining article (see Figure 1 for the
progressive flow of the study exclusion process). Decisions

for inclusion were made and verified by one reviewer (AB).
If multiple articles were published from the same sample,
the article with the most detailed report for each type of
physical activity was included and the other reports were only
included if they provided new analyses for different outcome
variables.

2.4. Data Extraction

2.4.1. Risk of Bias. The Cochrane Collaboration tool from the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
[38] was employed to assess the risk of bias for each study. The
items in the Cochrane risk of bias assessment include ran-
domization, allocation concealment, blinding of participants
and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete
data, and selective reporting. In addition, the risk of bias for
the time of year in which the training took place, trainer
qualifications for administration of the intervention, and the
suitability of recruitment was assessed using the Cochrane
Criteria.

2.4.2. Outcome Data. One researcher (AB) extracted the data
for all outcome measures on adiposity, physical capacity, and
mental health. Outcome variables were assessed by a wide
variety of measures. The adiposity indicators were relatively
homogeneous and measured the variable distinctly (i.e.,
weight, BMI, and circumference, each measuring body size
or mass). Similarly, the physical capacity measures distinctly
evaluated capability (i.e., maximal fitness, speed, and perfor-
mance). The mental health outcomes, however, covered an
assortment of variables (i.e., stress, anxiety, depression, and
quality of life).

2.4.3. Technique Taxonomy. Interventions that are designed
to change behavior, such as increasing physical activity
among postmenopausal women, are often versatile and
incorporate a number of interacting techniques [39]. When
strategies are not clearly described or labelled, challenges
for replication and application arise [40, 41]. Indeed, current
reporting of techniques in published articles is generally poor
and frequently omits details making it difficult to analyze
and synthesize [42]. According to Michie et al. [43], the lack
of such information reduces the reliability and usefulness
of the research. To deal with the difficulty, Michie et al.
[41, 43, 44] established a comprehensive list of technique
classifications based on past behavior change interventions
and psychology. The taxonomy is useful for identifying and
coding the various methods and techniques applied in any
intervention. It provides a system for researchers and clini-
cians to report interventions in a reliable and universal style.
The international behavior change technique taxonomy was
applied to the RCTs to identify and summarize the common
and/or unique techniques involved. The use of the taxonomy
will help describe weight loss program interventions and has
the potential to expand weight control study methodologies
to improve results, as well as permitting better analyses of
multiple studies. Applying the taxonomy to obesity interven-
tion programs among postmenopausal women, according to

our knowledge, has not been undertaken. It is an essential
segment in the current review paper because experts in
intervention design and training are pushing for standardized
reports to ease the practices necessary for synthesis in
research [45]. To reduce coding biases, two researchers (AB
and HSL) extracted the data and coded each intervention
technique separately based on Michie’s taxonomy system [41].
Any discrepancy in coding was discussed and reviewed until
consensus was reached.

2.5. Data Analysis. First, the findings from the RCTs were
summarized in Table 1. The results for the adiposity indica-
tors, physical capacity measures, and mental health outcomes
that were reported in two or more of the trials were subjected
to a more thorough observational analysis described in the
next section. Finally, the technique taxonomy was applied
to each RCT in order to effectively analyze the intervention
methods.

3. Results

The search identified 378 potential articles and, following a
review of the titles and abstracts, only 136 met the inclusion
criteria. Examination of Sections 2 and 3 prompted the exclu-

sion of 127 articles. As a result, 9 articles from five RCTs
remained that met the inclusion criteria. Three articles were
from the Dose Response to Exercise (DREW) study [46–48],
two articles were from the Physical Activity for Total Health
(PATH) study [49, 50], two articles were from the Nutrition
and Exercise for Women (NEW) study [51, 52], one article
was from the Women on the Move through Activity and
Nutrition (WOMAN) study [53], and one article was from
the Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention
(ALPHA) study [54] (see Table 1 for a summary).

3.1. Overall Description of Studies

3.1.1. Participants. The studies evaluated a total of 1,669 par-
ticipants from five different samples. The mean age across all
samples was 58.8 (range from 57 to 61 years). The five studies
included only female participants. The mean BMI across all
studies was 30.5 (range 29.2 to 31.8). Across all five studies, the
samples consisted mostly of non-Hispanic white women. In
four studies, the majority of the samples were highly educated
with at least some college education. In terms of employment,
29%, 50%, and 69.5% of women reported working full time in
three of the studies, while in two studies they did not report
statistics on employment.

3.1.2. Intervention Location. Most RCTs were conducted in
the United States (𝑛 = 4) and one was conducted in Canada.
All studies were carried out in metropolitan centers.

3.1.3. Study Design. All studies were parallel-group RCTs (i.e.,
each participant was randomly assigned to a study arm, and
all the participants in each study arm either received or
did not receive the intervention) allowing for comparison
of physical activity-only intervention against a control or
waitlist group. One intervention [51, 52] had comparisons
between several groups including physical activity-only, diet-
only, diet and physical activity, and a control group; the
methods and results pertaining to diet-only and diet and
physical activity groups were excluded in the analysis to focus
solely on the efficacy of physical activity-only groups versus
the control.

3.1.4. Intervention Duration and Intensity. The modal dura-
tion of intervention was 12 months (𝑛 = 3), ranging from 6 to
48 months. Intervention effects are summarized for end-of-
trial comparisons only. Any follow-up prior to the end of the
study is not part of the evaluation since the long-term effects
are of interest.

Intensity of contact with interventionists varied across
intervention groups and ranged from 1 to 4 times a week
for the duration of the intervention. One study stopped
contact after 24 months due to lack of funding [53]. The
participants associated with the program that ceased training
were expected to continue to follow the physical activity guide
on their own for the remaining 24 months of the program.
High-intensity contact interventions were primarily exercise
classes or training groups with a specialized trainer such as
an exercise psychologist or physiologist.

3.1.5. Description of Intervention Techniques. All of the trials
(𝑛 = 5) had comparable physical activity programs as they
all applied some form of aerobics exercise at a moderate-to-
vigorous intensity (refer to Table 1 for details). Three studies
required physical activity that persisted for 45 minutes for 5
days per week, one study required physical activity 4 days a

week with varying durations, and one study did not indicate
how many days per week but rather indicated a minimum
of 150 minutes per week (see Table 2 for a summary of the
means). Each RCT measured moderate-to-vigorous intensity
physical activity equivalent to a 3.0 or greater Metabolic
Equivalent of Task (MET) level, based on the Compendium
of Physical Activities [55]. Less than 3.0 MET refers to light
physical activity (such as standing, using a computer, and
light walking), 3.0–6.0 MET is moderate physical activity
(including heavy cleaning, brisk walking, or light sport), and
>6.0 MET aligns with vigorous physical activity (such as
hiking, jogging, or shovelling). Each study encouraged the
participants to use an assortment of equipment to activate
different muscle groups and prevent injury.

3.2. Observational Study Results

3.2.1. Risk of Bias. The trials did not show a high risk of bias
on any of the items of the Cochrane Collaboration tool nor
for the additional biases considered (the season in which the
training took place, trainer qualifications for administration
of the intervention, and the suitability of recruitment), which
suggests that the interpretation of the results should not be
affected by the study design and implementation methods.

3.2.2. Effects of Interventions. Please refer to Table 3 for the
details of each analysis and reported results.

Adiposity Outcomes. Adiposity was measured with various
indicators including body weight, BMI, percentage of fat
mass, lean body mass, intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat,
and waist circumference. Based on the 9 articles reviewed,
participants who were part of a long-term intervention
program lasting 6 months or more showed a significant
decrease in body weight, total percentage of body fat, BMI,
intra-abdominal fat, subcutaneous fat, waist circumference,
and hip circumference compared to the control group. There
was no significant change in lean body mass. The DREW
study [46–48] was the only RCT with various physical activity
intervention groups. The 3 physical activity intervention
groups differed by exercise dose per week. The study found

that, regardless of the dose, a decrease in waist circumference
was found compared to the control group and the dose of
exercise had an incremental effect on the result. However,
there was no significant difference in weight or body fat
percentage across the three physical activity intervention
groups. Each physical activity dosage group significantly
differed in weight from the control group. The NEW study
[51] ran secondary analyses to further explore how different
doses of exercise impacted adiposity measures. They found
that women in the highly active group (≥196 min/week) lost
most of the weight by the end of the trial relative to the
intermediate active group (154–196 min/week), low active
group (<154 min/week), and the control group. The same
incremental effects were found for BMI, waist circumference,
and percentage of body fat. Even minimal doses of exercise
showed a benefit on adiposity indicators compared to no
physical activity and weight loss is likely to be greater for
those who were engaged in larger doses of exercise.

Physical Capacity Outcomes. Physical capacity was measured
with parameters such as physical performance, maximal fit-
ness (or VO2 max, a measure of endurance) and pedometer
reading. All of the RCTs demonstrated improved physical
capacity by the end of the trials. Specifically, participants in
the physical activity intervention showed improved maximal
fitness, lower walk times to complete the 400 meter, and
increased pedometer readings compared to the control group.
According to the DREW study [46], there was a signifi-
cant difference in mean maximal fitness response (tread-
mill testing) for all pairwise comparisons (i.e., the process
of comparing groups in pairs to judge which of the two
demonstrated greater improvement) per treatment groups
(low, moderate, and high dose groups) except the low versus
moderate dose groups. This demonstrates that the dose of
exercise incrementally improved maximal fitness compared
to the control group, and, as expected, the highest dosage pro-
duced the largest effect while the low and moderately active
groups did not differ from one another. Measures of physical
capacity significantly improved with long-term interventions
≥6 months.

Mental Health Outcomes. Depression, anxiety, and stress were
included in two studies [49, 52] as the mental health out-
comes; these constructs were assessed with validated surveys.
The Brief Symptom Inventory [56] was used to measure
anxiety and depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale [57]
was used to measure stress. Overall, the various RCTs showed
no significant difference between the physical activity group
and the control group on anxiety, depression, and stress. In
addition, quality of life was included in three studies [47,
49, 52] and also represented a dimension of mental health.
Quality of life was measured with the Short Form Health
Survey (SF-36) which includes measures of physical and
mental health [58]. Bowen et al. [49] and Imayama et al. [52]
both reported nonsignificant results in quality of life at the
end of the intervention for the physical activity group and the
control group. However, Martin et al. [47] found that treat-
ment groups, specifically the moderate and high dose physical
activity groups, indeed showed significant improvements on

all subscales of quality of life, with the exception of physical
quality of life subscale measuring bodily pain, compared to
the control group. This finding suggests that moderate and
high doses of physical activity may be required for improving
quality of life outcomes among postmenopausal women.

3.2.3. Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy. The results
from the behavior change technique taxonomy are displayed
in Table 4. To summarize, several techniques were identified
and labelled with the corresponding taxonomy in brackets.
For instance, interventionists demonstrated how to use the
equipment in the training facility (instructions on how to
perform a behavior/modelling of behavior) so that the partici-
pants could carry out the physical activity tasks. Daily activity
logs were documented by the participants to self-monitor
(self-monitoring of behavior). The activity logs were submitted
weekly for review and follow-up with staff (others monitoring
with awareness). The trainer evaluated the number of calories
to be expended each week and provided the information
to the participant during training, or general
feedback
regarding progress was provided at meetings (feedback on
behavior/social support practical). The heart rate monitor
and/or pedometer was used at each training session to ensure
that the intensity of the workout was ideal (biofeedback/self-
monitoring of behavior/others monitoring with awareness).
The facility training was always supervised (others monitoring
with awareness). In terms of rewards, triannual intervention
group activities such as hikes were used to drive motivation
(social reward) and incentives such as water bottles or
monetary compensation were guaranteed when milestones
were reached (material reward/incentive). Regular individ-
ual or group meetings were held to discuss goals (goal
setting behavior/goal setting outcome). Interventionists also
provided feedback on progress toward goals (feedback on
behavior/review behavior goals) or discussed how to conquer
barriers when needed (problem solving coping planning). Also
individualized phone calls or meetings were conducted to
examine, ensure, and promote adherence to the program
(social support general/discrepancy between current behavior
and goal standard). Finally, participants were asked to devote
time and effort to the intervention in order to make sure that
the controlled conditions were met (commitment).

The RCTs included in this review evidently employed a
number of behavioral change techniques. Each trial used a
very similar collection of techniques. The RCTs employed
17 of the 85 possible behavioral change techniques from
the technique taxonomy [41]. As observed, some of the
techniques were labelled with 2 or more of the universal codes
because some strategies consist of overlapping and highly
interacting techniques. Many techniques coincided greatly
and often lead to coding one technique with a cluster of codes
(see [41] for details on technique clustering).

4. Discussion

The current systematic review evaluated the impact of phys-
ical activity on adiposity indicators, physical capacity mea-
sures, and mental health outcomes among sedentary over-
weight and obese postmenopausal women. Consistent with

previous findings in the general population and adult women
[59, 60], adiposity outcomes and physical capacity improved
significantly with long-term aerobic interventions compared
to a control group. Four out of the five RCTs showed a
significant decrease in body weight and percentage of fat mass
for those in the intervention group compared to the control
group. Two of the RCTs examined BMI during follow-up;

BMI significantly decreased compared to the control group.
In the studies that examined changes in intra-abdominal fat,
subcutaneous fat, and waist circumference, the findings also
showed a significant decrease in relation to the control group.
Three of the studies looked at lean body mass and found that
long-term aerobic physical activity did not have a significant
effect. This finding was not surprising because resistance

Journal of Obesity

17

training, which was not employed in any of the trials in
this review, is ideal for building lean muscle. For example,
Willis et al. [61] demonstrated that overweight and obese
adults who participated in an 8-month resistance training
program significantly increased in lean body mass compared
to the aerobics training group. Conversely, the aerobics
training group significantly reduced total body mass and fat
mass compared to the resistance training group. In terms
of the physical capacity measures, fitness level, as measured
by treadmill tests for maximal fitness, relative fitness, and
power output, significantly improved among the intervention
group compared to the control group. Results of this review,
therefore, clearly call for physical activity interventions for
postmenopausal women to assist in reduced adiposity and
improved physical capacity.

In line with a review conducted by Warburton et al. [62],
the results also revealed an incremental relationship between
dose of physical activity and change in adiposity indicators
and physical capacity measures. As physical activity dose
increased, adiposity measures including weight, percentage
of body fat, and waist circumference significantly decreased
(BMI was found marginally significant). Furthermore, only
one study found that, at the end of the 6-month intervention,
body weight and percent of body fat did not significantly
decrease for any of the physical activity dose groups (low,
moderate, and high) compared to the control group. Yet, waist
circumference significantly decreased for each dose group
compared to the control group and an incremental effect
was found. This finding might be due to the fact that the
intervention was 6 months in duration and, according to
previous research, 6 months or less is relatively short term for
changes in body mass and other biochemical responses [63].
Two of the RCTs looked at mental health outcomes
including depression, anxiety, and stress. According to these
studies, the mental health outcomes did not differ signifi-
cantly by treatment condition at the end of the 12-month
intervention period. The finding does not reflect the results
from previous studies with alternative populations [64] (e.g.,
overweight adults with type II diabetes and adults recovering
from stroke). Research has shown that physical activity
indeed improves self-reported levels of stress, anxiety, and
depression in these populations [65–67]. Yet, this is not what
we found. Imayama et al. [52] proposed that the participant’s
preference for type of physical activity could have affected the
results because if walking on a treadmill was not their pre-
ferred activity, it may have impacted the self-report responses
on mental health outcomes. Furthermore, participants in the
trials reported relatively low levels of depression and anxiety
at baseline which may have caused a “basement effect” (also
known as the floor effect). This effect is often established in
research when participants report low levels on a measure
at baseline and also at follow-up. Consequently, it becomes
difficult, if not impossible, to find significant improvement
on the measure (in this case depression and anxiety) since
the subjects initially reported little to no symptoms. Finally,
mental well-being is typically influenced by a number of
factors and physical activity may not necessarily improve
every aspect of an individual’s life to facilitate a change in
depression, anxiety, and stress scores. Rather, physical activity

may help improve more immediate consequences such as
mood or affect, and future work should explore this realm
of mental health. Given that there is a limited number of
studies that looked at mental health outcomes, future research
should continue to investigate the effects of physical activity
on stress, anxiety, and depression since there is not enough
evidence to reliably infer and draw conclusions.

Interestingly, one study found that the control group of
stretchers significantly improved on depression scores [49].
This finding provides evidence for the value of stretching and
breathing techniques in physical activity programs. Previous
research explored the impact of yoga and stretching on state
and trait anxiety [67] and on depression [68]. The literature
demonstrates that stretching has a positive impact on various
mental health outcomes. Improvement on mental health out-
comes may have been significant for the intervention group if
this type of activity was incorporated in the training sessions.
On the other hand, if the control group did not incorporate
an intervention that is typically used to treat symptoms of
depression and anxiety, group differences may have been
observed on the mental health outcomes.

Quality of life was also examined and considered a
dimension of mental health. In line with a recent systematic
review and meta-analysis [69], weight loss was not signif-
icantly associated with overall quality of life. Specifically,
Warkentin et al. [69] found that weight loss might be asso-
ciated with modest improvements in the physical aspect of
quality of life,but not the mental health aspect. Similarly,
McCarroll et al. [70] found that adult endometrial cancer
survivors, who were assigned to a weight loss intervention to
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, demonstrated that
quality of life had no correlation to weight loss. However,
a recent study by Rothberg et al. [71] found that a greater
reduction in BMI after the physical activity intervention
significantly improved quality of life measures and individual
differences appeared to influence the strength of the associa-
tion. Participants with a lower baseline BMI, greater decrease
in BMI from baseline to follow-up, and poorer baseline
quality of life score demonstrated greater improvements in
quality of life at follow-up.

The current review tends to share the contradictory
nature of the findings from previous work. Two of the studies
[49, 52] reported nonsignificant results on quality of life by
treatment condition and one study [47] found remarkable
results. Namely, Martin et al. [47] found that the dose of
physical activity had an effect on self-reported quality of life.
More explicitly, the social quality of life subscales (social
functioning and role limitation) demonstrated significant
improvement among moderate and high physical activity
dose groups compared to the control group. The remaining
two subscales for social quality of life (vitality and men-
tal health) demonstrated a significant improvement for all
physical activity groups (low, moderate, and high) compared
to the control group. In terms of the physical quality of
life subscales, both physical functioning and role limitations
improved significantly among moderate and high physical
activity dose groups compared to the control group. The
physical quality of life subscale measuring general health
perceptions significantly improved for all doses of physical

18

activity groups compared to the control group. Lastly, the
physical quality of life subscale measuring bodily pain did not
show significant results for any groups. These findings may
suggest that higher doses of physical activity are necessary
for improving quality of life outcomes. Future research is
required to understand such inconsistencies.

The Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults
suggest that 150 minutes of physical activity per week is the
minimum requirement [72]. All five RCTs met this criterion.
The results demonstrate that the requirement of 150 minutes
per week of physical activity is a suitable guideline for the
samples of postmenopausal women included in this review.
In general, the findings indicate plausible efficacy of long-
term physical activity interventions. To further strengthen
the evidence base, future research should include a meta-
analysis of the effectiveness of physical activity on various
outcomes, focusing particularly on those that have impli-
cations for mental health. Such prospective research will
help develop a better understanding of physical activity
interventions among sedentary overweight and obese post-
menopausal women.

4.1. Classification of Behavior Change Techniques. The clas-
sification of strategies from the behavior change technique
taxonomy [41] was applied to standardize the intervention
content across the RCTs and identify the different assortment
and levels of intervention techniques. The findings revealed
that the techniques were largely focused on two levels: the
individual (intrapersonal) and the social aspect (interper-
sonal) of behavior change. The techniques used to change
the subject’s behavior included intrapersonal strategies to
help educate and increase knowledge, teach new skills, and
develop competence, whereas the interpersonal techniques
were employed to help promote social support and encourage
adherence to the program. Indeed, the two levels of tech-
niques are crucial in improving physical activity behavior
among postmenopausal women as they evidently helped
produce positive effects on adiposity and physical capacity.

Other techniques may have been applied in the inter-
ventions, but the content was either not transparent or the
description was too brief. Michie et al. [43] have emphasized
the importance of reporting details and the taxonomy is
simply a system to help accurately document the intervention
content. Nevertheless, similarities and differences across
the interventions were uncovered based on the taxonomy
analysis. The interventions centered their techniques on
instruction, education, modelling, feedback, and rewards.
Techniques such as manipulating or restructuring the envi-
ronment (physical or social) or targeting emotions were not
used in any of the interventions.

The Social Ecological Model of Health Behavior devel-
oped by McLeroy et al. [73] is a behavior change framework
which emphasizes that a variety of sources influence specific
health behaviors and they do so by interacting with one
another. The framework has been used to understand and
identify the relevant sources for behavior-specific interven-
tions such as smoking cessation [74, 75] and healthy eating
[76]. The model includes five main sources or levels of influ-
ence on health behaviors: the intrapersonal (characteristics

of the individual including skills, attitudes, and develop-
mental history), interpersonal (social networks and support
systems), organizational (institutional and organizational
cultures, rules, and regulations for operation), community
(relationships among organizations, institutions, and other
networks), and public policy (local, provincial, and national
laws). Ample research proposes that multilevel interventions
that incorporate various levels from the Social Ecological
Model are ideal for improving large-scale or population-wide
health problems such as obesity [77].

Multilevel models lead to more substantial and sustained
changes in health behaviors compared to single-level or
dual-level interventions because they provide opportunity for
maximal behavior change [78, 79]. According to the World
Health Organization [1], health behaviors improve when
environments and policies support healthy choices and indi-
viduals are motivated and educated to make those choices.
Educating people to make healthy choices when environ-
ments are not supportive may not be effective in making
behavioral change because the environment provides norms,
rules, and resources to behave in a particular way [73, 80].

The environmental approach seems to be growing in
physical activity intervention research. For example, a study
by Carlson et al. [81] found that environmental features and
psychosocial measures of self-efficacy and social support
are associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
among older adults. Specifically, those who reported a high
level of support to exercise from family and friends had
on average 56 minutes of more physical activity per week
compared to those who reported low social support. As
well, environments that were reported as having pleasing
aesthetics were associated with increased physical activity by
roughly 30 minutes per week compared to areas reported as
having undesirable aesthetics. Negative perceptions of safety,
traffic, and distances from exercise facilities were found to
reduce physical activity by about 18 minutes per week [82].
Chaudhury et al. [82] found that environmental aesthetics
such as smooth walking surfaces (trails and parks around the
community), plenty of benches for comfort and breaks, safety
and security, and peer support (partners for activities) were
found to be associated with increased physical activity regard-
less of population density in the neighbourhood. Evidently,
social and environmental aspects should be considered by
interventionists. In order to truly drive physical activity
intervention research forward, environmental levels should
be integrated in research.

Several countries have reported major health improve-
ments from implementing a multilevel approach focusing on
people, policy, and environment such as Brazil [83] and Costa
Rica [84]. Supporting a person-environment approach seems
to be the gold standard in intervention research. To advance
physical activity intervention research and build from the
current systematic review, these multilevel approaches could
serve as models for testing the effectiveness of physical
activity interventions in North American postmenopausal
populations.

4.2. Strengths and Limitations. The main strength of this
review is the comprehensive and meticulous search of five

Journal of Obesity

19

databases and the synthesis of available evidence from
RCTs of physical activity interventions among sedentary
postmenopausal women in Canada and the United States.
The findings, however, may only generalize to the contexts
in which the studies have been conducted. Researches in
different countries, cultural settings, and postmenopausal
women with serious health conditions require a separate
investigation. Different clinical populations tend to have
specific characteristics that require tailored interventions
especially if the subjects are unable to walk themselves to
a facility for training. Some clinical populations may suffer
from fatigue or have priority treatment groups like patients
battling cancer. A systematic review by Knols et al. [85]
examined the benefits of physical activity in cancer patients.
The review found statistically significant results favouring
even small doses of walking and strengthening exercises
(free weights and isokinetic machines) on body fat, lean
body mass, bone mineral density, muscle strength, walking
distance, and self-reported outcomes including fatigue, psy-
chological well-being, mood, and quality of life. The findings
revealed that low levels of physical activity (whether carried
out in a rehabilitation program or at home) are effective
in improving the physical and psychosocial functioning of
patients with breast cancer both during medical treatment
and after it. Zanuso et al. [86] also suggested that intervention
research among some clinical populations should focus on
not only the effect of aerobic exercise itself, but also the effect
of exercise intensity. Prospective research should therefore
investigate postmenopausal women with health conditions as
they may require different interventions and evaluations.

A second strength is that

the adiposity indicators
and physical capacity tests were objectively measured and
recorded with sophisticated instruments such as a scale to
measure body weight, ultrasounds to measure fat mass, intra-
abdominal fat, and subcutaneous fat, a treadmill test to
measure fitness, and a pedometer to measure steps.

A limitation is that the mental health outcomes were
measured with self-report methods. Issues and restrictions
with self-reported outcomes have been flagged in the lit-
erature [87] and may have had an impact on the results.
Additionally, very few trials (𝑛 = 2) examined the impact of
physical activity on diverse mental health outcomes among
postmenopausal women and future research should explore
this avenue to understand the implications of physical activity
on mental well-being.

Sisson et al. [48] noted that, after running individual-level
analyses, a fair amount of individual variability in response
to maximal fitness became apparent. They found that the
volume of training and age played a role on maximal fitness
results. Stratified sampling by BMI, age, or ethnic group
was also not carried out for any of the outcome measures.
Individual variability such as differences in cultural or ethnic
groups may exist, but this information was not included in
the original RCTs. Sublevel analyses ought to be carried out
in future work.

The methodological quality of some of

the studies
demonstrated room for improvement as judged by the
Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias [38].
Many of the RCTs did not report methods for blinding

of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors. Half of
the studies failed to report the process for concealing the
allocation of participants and how the allocation was masked
throughout the trial period. The missing content was not
judged to be a high risk; however, future reports should
improve the coverage of this content. Likewise, the particular
behavioral change techniques employed in the interventions
to support and increase physical activity were described with
little details. The consistent lack of information tends to
hinder the reliability and usefulness of intervention stud-
ies because such details are required for replication and
application elsewhere [43]. The missing information also
creates a challenge for reliably translating and interpreting the
various techniques in secondary research such as systematic
reviews [41]. Though the potentially omitted information is
a limitation, this expected circumstance provides a learning
opportunity for future intervention reports where all relevant
details should be provided.

Lastly, the inclusion criterion to select and investigate
RCTs presents another restraint. Although the review of RCTs
is a reliable means to establish efficacy, the effectiveness
of physical activity interventions among postmenopausal
women was not examined. Consequently, it was not possible
to study the effects of the environment since the environ-
ments were highly controlled during training. Based on the
notion that environment and policy are key in maximal
behavior change and maintenance, prospective work should
focus on investigating the effectiveness of such multilevel
intervention models.

5. Conclusion

The current systematic review evaluated the efficacy of phys-
ical activity interventions on adiposity indicators, physical
capacity measures, and the mental health outcomes of stress,
anxiety, and depression among sedentary overweight/obese
postmenopausal women. The other goal of the review was to
identify the various levels of behavioral change techniques
that were employed in the interventions to determine the
common techniques and guide prospective research and
application in alternative settings.

The findings showed that addressing the intrapersonal
and interpersonal levels of behavior change improved physi-
cal activity levels which led to a number of positive outcomes
on adiposity indicators and physical capacity measures.
Future research should explore physical activity interventions
among postmenopausal women in terms of a multilevel
model going beyond the combination of intrapersonal and
interpersonal sources. Although the literature does not com-
prise many studies on physical activity interventions among
postmenopausal women and certainly no studies that follow a
multilevel approach, this is recommended as the direction for
future work. Given that multilevel models take a combination
of both individual- and environmental-level intervention
techniques to maximize change in health behaviors among
populations, this framework would seemingly work well for
physical activity programs geared toward postmenopausal
populations. In turn, the issue of overweight and obesity
among postmenopausal women may, in due course, subside.
