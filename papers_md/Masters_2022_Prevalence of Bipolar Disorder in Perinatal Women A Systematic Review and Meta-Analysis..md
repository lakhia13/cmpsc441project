Abstract

Objective:  To estimate overall prevalence of bipolar disorder (BD) and the prevalence and timing 
of bipolar-spectrum mood episodes in perinatal women.

Data Sources:  Databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, ClincalTrials.gov) 
were searched from inception to March 2020.

Study Selection:  Included studies were original research in English that had (1) populations 
of perinatal participants (pregnant or within 12 months postpartum), aged ≥ 18 years, and (2) a

screening/diagnostic tool for BD. Search terms described the population (eg, perinatal), illness (eg, 
bipolar disorder), and detection (eg, screen, identify).

Data Extraction:  Study design data, rates, and timing of positive screens/diagnoses and mood 
episodes were extracted by 3 independent reviewers. Pooled prevalences were estimated using 
random-effects meta-analyses.

Results:  Twenty-two articles were included in qualitative review and 12 in the meta-analysis. In 
women with no known psychiatric illness preceding the perinatal period, pooled prevalence of BD 
was 2.6% (95% CI, 1.2%–4.5%) and prevalence of bipolar-spectrum mood episodes (including 
depressed, hypomanic/manic, mixed) during pregnancy and the postpartum period was 20.1% 
(95% CI, 16.0%–24.5%). In women with a prior BD diagnosis, 54.9% (95% CI, 39.2%–70.2%) 
were found to have at least one bipolar-spectrum mood episode occurrence in the perinatal period.

Conclusions:  Our review suggests that the perinatal period is associated with high rates of 
bipolar-spectrum mood episodes and that pregnant and postpartum women represent a special 
risk population. This review may help to inform clinical care recommendations, thus helping to 
identify those who may have bipolar disorder to connect them with needed care.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a serious mental illness with significant health ramifications for 
patients, their families, providers, and the health care system.1–4 In the general population, 
prevalence estimates of bipolar-spectrum disorders are 2%–3%.5 Perinatal women (those 
pregnant or within 1-year postpartum) may be at increased risk for bipolar-spectrum mood 
episodes.6–11 The reasons for increased bipolar-spectrum mood episode occurrence during 
the perinatal period are multifactorial and include (1) overlap between peak reproductive 
years and BD onset, (2) hormonal and physiological changes accompanying pregnancy, and 
(3) stress related to childbirth and parenting.6–8,12,13

BD is a risk factor for perinatal suicide, postpartum psychosis, and infanticide.11–18 
Despite the association between untreated or inadequately treated perinatal BD and poor 
neurodevelopmental and psychosocial outcomes in offspring,11–17 detection, diagnosis, and 
effective treatment remain elusive. For example, BD may be misdiagnosed as unipolar 
depression and treated with unopposed antidepressant medications, potentially precipitating 
mania and/or suicidality.19–21 Prior systematic reviews6,12 demonstrate increased risk of 
bipolar-spectrum mood episode recurrence in perinatal women with preexisting BD and poor 
outcomes with lack of treatment. However, to date, no systematic reviews have estimated the 
overall prevalence of BD or bipolar-spectrum mood episodes in perinatal women without a 
known BD diagnosis preceding the perinatal period.

In this review, we systematically evaluated the studies measuring rates of BD during 
pregnancy and the postpartum period. The goal of this review was to examine (1) the 
prevalence of BD in perinatal women and (2) the prevalence and timing of bipolar-spectrum 
mood episodes in the perinatal time period. The synthesis of these data could help to inform 
clinical care and screening recommendations specific to BD.

METHOD

Data Sources and Search Strategy

Page 3

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a literature review of the following databases: PubMed, 
Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, and ClincalTrials.gov. Search terms included 
keywords describing the population (eg, perinatal, pregnancy, postpartum), illness of interest 
(eg, bipolar disorder), and screening processes (eg, screen, identify). A complete description 
of our search strategy may be found in Supplementary Appendix 1. Articles were limited 
to those published in peer-reviewed journals that were available in English through March 
2020. Additional articles were identified via the reference sections of eligible articles. 
Our study protocol was registered with Prospero (#CRD42020172166). The University of 
Massachusetts Chan Medical School Institutional Review Board determined this study to not 
require human subject research review.

Study Selection

The initial search, as defined by the aforementioned criteria, yielded 4,052 records. After 
removing duplicates, two independent reviewers (G.A.M., J.H.) reviewed titles and abstracts 
to assess first-pass eligibility, excluding 2,786. Supplementary Appendix 2 illustrates the 
full PRISMA study identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion process. Independent 
reviewers (G.A.M., J.H., L.X.) reviewed the 177 full-text articles for final study eligibility. 
Any inconsistencies between the reviewers were resolved through discussion and consensus. 
Eligibility criteria included the following: (1) study population of perinatal people (pregnant 
or within 12 months postpartum), aged ≥ 18 years; (2) use of screening/diagnostic tool(s) 
validated in the perinatal population to detect BD; and (3) accessible article and relevant 
data. Articles were also included if they included populations with preexisting psychiatric 
diagnoses (eg, unipolar depression, anxiety disorders, BD), as long as a screening/diagnostic 
tool to detect BD was used as a part of the study, and/or if the population were on 
psychotropic medications before, during, or after pregnancy. Articles were excluded if 
(1) participants were recruited based on an unrelated medical condition that secondarily 
assessed psychiatric symptoms, (2) screening/diagnostic assessment was conducted outside 
of the perinatal period, and (3) BD prevalence was not reported. After final review and 
consensus, 22 articles were included in the qualitative review and 12 in the meta-analyses 
(see Supplementary Appendix 2 for details). Full details, including study population 
specifics, tools used, prior diagnoses, and treatments, are available in Supplementary 
Appendix 3.

Data Extraction

Data extraction began on June 8, 2020. Eligible articles were extracted by 3 independent 
reviewers (G.A.M., J.H., L.X.), with inconsistencies resolved through consensus. Extracted 
data were entered into REDCap.22,23 Articles were examined for key study elements, 
including (1) study design and population, (2) screening/diagnostic tools, and (3) rates and 
timing of positive BD screens, diagnoses, mood symptoms, and/or episodes.

Quality Assessment

Page 4

Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black checklist,24 
which evaluates study design in 5 areas: (1) reporting, or design specifics; (2) external 
validity; (3) bias; (4) confounding; and (5) power. We modified the checklist to exclude 
items that were not applicable or were not able to be assessed, as has been done previously 
(Supplementary Appendix 4).25,26

Study quality was assessed and recorded during data extraction, with inconsistencies 
resolved through consensus. For each study, an overall quality percentage score was 
calculated (total points awarded divided by total points possible). Quality scores were used 
to examine overall trends in extant study quality and to conduct subanalyses.

Data Reporting

We differentiated the study populations into two categories for analyses: (1) participants 
with no known psychiatric illness preceding the perinatal period (henceforth referred to 
as “no psychiatric history preceding the perinatal period”) and (2) participants with BD, 
based on diagnostic interview, or probable BD, based on a validated screening tool to detect 
bipolar disorder (eg, the Mood Disorder Questionnaire [MDQ]), preceding the perinatal 
period (henceforth referred to as “BD preceding the perinatal period”). Some studies 
also examined participants with a history of any mood disorder, including a history of 
either bipolar or unipolar depression. The heterogeneity of these groups was too high for 
these studies to be included in the meta-analyses and thus they were included only in 
the qualitative review. Of note, most articles did not ask about gender and instead made 
assumptions, based on pregnant or postpartum status. Therefore, we refer to participants in 
these studies as women, acknowledging that people who do not identify as women can also 
be childbearing persons.

We examined rates of BD prevalence and timing of bipolar-spectrum mood episodes across 
study populations. In studies that reported more than one prevalence value (eg, used more 
than one scoring methodology), the rates were reported separately. BD was measured as 
either an overall prevalence or mood episode occurrence/recurrence. Prevalence of BD was 
operationalized as women identified via diagnostic or screening tools that measure bipolar-
spectrum mood episodes, past or current (eg, the MDQ) over all women screened across 
included studies. BD mood episode occurrence/recurrence was operationalized as women 
experiencing a “current” bipolar-spectrum mood episode occurring during the perinatal 
period, as determined by either (1) diagnostic interview (eg, current mood episode on 
the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV [SCID]) or (2) symptoms occurring 
concurrently that correspond with established thresholds on validated instruments (eg, 10+ 
score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]27 or 8+ score on the Highs 
scale28). Mood episodes were reported both collectively and by subgroup (hypomanic/
manic, depressive, mixed). Symptom clusters reported in studies that were “subthreshold,” 
or not meeting aforementioned criteria, were not included.

Meta-Analysis

Page 5

Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the following: (1) 
overall BD prevalence and bipolar-spectrum mood episode occurrence in women with no 
psychiatric illness preceding the perinatal period and (2) bipolar-spectrum mood episode 
occurrence during the perinatal period among women with BD. When more than one rate 
was available in a study (eg, by use of different scoring methods), the more conservative 
value was used in analyses. Pooled prevalence and 95% CIs were calculated following 
methodology previously published by Barendregt et al,29 in which the inverse variance 
method and double arcsine transformation were used, and resultant values were transformed 
back to the original proportion format for presentation and interpretation. We used random-
effects models to calculate pooled prevalence rates because the studies included varied 
by design and quality. A fixed-effects model was also run as a sensitivity analysis. Meta-
analyses were conducted using MetaXL version 5.3 (EpiGear International).

RESULTS

Description of Studies

A total of 22 observational studies met inclusion criteria (Supplementary Appendix 2). 
Most were conducted in obstetric settings (63.6%)30–39,41–44 and detected BD using 
diagnostic instruments (77.3%),30,32,35,37–50 including the SCID (68.2%),30,32,37–48,50 the 
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 9.1%),35,47 and the Alcohol Use 
Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-IV (AUDADIS-IV, 4.5%).49 
Less than a third (31.8%) used the MDQ screening instrument to identify potential 
BD.30,31,33,34,36,40,51 Studies consisted of women who were pregnant (13.6%),34,42,48 
postpartum (40.9%),30,31,33,35,37,40,43,44,51 or both (45.5%).32,36,38,39,41,45–47,49,50 Eleven 
studies examined the prevalence of BD in women with no psychiatric history preceding the 
perinatal period.30–37,43,49,51 Most studies did not distinguish between sex and gender and 
appeared to assume gender identity or expression.

Quality Assessment

The mean quality rating was 73.7% (range, 45.5%–92.9%) (Supplementary Appendix 3). 
The main study design limitations included (1) insufficient reporting of potential or actual 
adverse events (eg, suicidality was reported without description of study plan to address 
and/or follow-up), (2) limited or no description of participants lost to follow-up and/or the 
effects on results, and (3) inadequate description of the confounders and/or adjustment for 
said variables in analyses.

Prevalence of BD in Women With No Psychiatric History Preceding Perinatal Period

In the studies that used the MDQ to screen for BD in women with no psychiatric history 
preceding the perinatal period (studies = 6), prevalence ranged from 3.3% to 25.5% 
(Table 1).30,31,33,34,36,51 Studies that used diagnostic tools estimated rates from 0% to 
2.9%.32,35,37,43,49

Most studies examined rates in the postpartum period only or across both pregnancy and 
postpartum; only 2 studies32,34 examined rates in pregnancy alone (Table 2).

Among studies that evaluated rates of BD in women with no psychiatric history preceding 
the perinatal period (studies = 11, people = 6,325),30–37,43,49,51 no statistically significant 
differences were observed in the random- or fixed-effects models; therefore, only the 
random-effects output is reported. Prevalence of BD was 2.6% (95% CI, 1.2%–4.5%; Table 
3, Figure 1). When restricted to studies with higher quality scores (≥ 70%, studies = 6, 
people = 4,218), the prevalence was 4.5% (95% CI, 2.9%–6.4%). The heterogeneity of 
prevalence estimates was high (I2 = 92%, I2 = 81% in higher quality). In studies that used 
the MDQ (studies = 6, people = 2,848), 30,31,33,34,36,51 the pooled prevalence was 4.8% 
(95% CI, 3.1%–6.9%). When restricted to studies using the MDQ with higher quality scores 
(studies = 5, people = 2,694), prevalence was 4.9% (95% CI, 2.9%–7.4%). In studies that 
used diagnostic interviews to diagnose BD (studies = 5, people = 3,477),32,35,37,43,49 the 
pooled prevalence was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.0%–2.3%). Four of the 5 studies in this group were 
of poorer quality; thus, pooled prevalence based on quality could not be calculated.

Bipolar-Spectrum Mood Episode Occurrence

Sixteen studies reported on bipolar-spectrum mood episode occurrence among pregnant 
and postpartum women, including depressive, manic/hypomanic, and/or mixed episodes. 
30–39,41,44–46,50,51 Measurement tools and methodologies varied greatly; the most common 
tools used to measure mood episodes were the EPDS and the SCID mood modules. All 
studies that examined mood episodes looked at depressive episodes and some also looked 
at hypomanic (4 studies), manic (3 studies), or mixed episodes (2 studies) (Table 1). Five 
studies examined occurrence of depressive episodes among women with BD as compared to 
individuals with unipolar depression. 30,31,33,36,46

Bipolar-Spectrum Mood Episodes in Women With No Psychiatric History Preceding the 
Perinatal Period

Among women with no psychiatric history preceding the perinatal period, the rate of 
bipolar-spectrum mood episodes was higher than the overall rate of BD.37,38,51 For example, 
Pingo et al37 found that 31.6% of women (n = 57) screened positive for hypomania and 
17.5% for a mixed episode during the perinatal period, while 0% had a BD diagnosis 
via SCID. The pooled prevalence rate of mood episodes (studies = 10, people = 4,473) 
occurring during the perinatal time period was 20.1% (95% CI, 16.0%–24.5%) (Table 
3, Figure 2). When restricted to studies with higher quality scores (studies = 6, people 
= 3,520), the prevalence was 16.1% (95% CI, 12.4%–20.1%). The estimate in pregnant 
women (studies = 2, people = 744) was 22.0%; the prevalence in postpartum women (studies 
= 8, people = 3,754) was 18.0%.

Bipolar-Spectrum Mood Episodes in Women With BD Preceding the Perinatal Period

In women with BD preceding the perinatal period (studies = 7, people = 2,814), 54.9% 
(95% CI, 39.2%–70.2%) had at least one bipolar-spectrum mood episode occurrence in the 
perinatal period. All studies included in this estimate had quality ratings above 70%. The 
prevalence of episodes was 51.4% in pregnant women (study = 1, people = 53) versus 54.8% 
in postpartum women (studies = 6, people = 2,240).

Comparing Depressive Episodes Rates in Women With and Without BD

Eight studies compared rates of depressive episodes in women with and without BD (people 
= 4,238); in 6 of 8 studies, depressive episodes were higher in women with BD than in those 
without.30–33,36,39,44,46 When prevalence rates were compared (studies = 3, people = 2,287), 
women with probable BD (via positive MDQ) were 6.5 times (95% CI, 2.0%–20.8%) 
more likely to have a depressive episode than those without probable BD (via negative 
MDQ).30,33,36

DISCUSSION

Bipolar disorder is exacerbated during pregnancy and the postpartum period and is 
associated with adverse outcomes.6,12 Estimating the prevalence of BD and bipolar-
spectrum mood episodes occurring in the perinatal period is critical to inform guidelines 
to adequately detect, assess, and treat BD. We found that, in women both with and without 
known psychiatric illness preceding the perinatal period, bipolar-spectrum mood episode 
occurrence in the perinatal period exceeded expected estimates.5,52,53 Our review and 
analyses of the limited extant literature on this group suggest that pregnant and postpartum 
women are at greater risk for bipolar-spectrum mood episodes during the perinatal period 
than previously thought.

Though our meta-analyses estimated that the rate of BD in women with no psychiatric 
history preceding perinatal period was 2.6%, our pooled prevalence rates also estimated that 
20.1% of these people were estimated to have had manic/hypomanic, mixed, or depressive 
episodes in the perinatal period. This discrepancy may well represent women with index 
episodes occurring for the first time during the perinatal period who will go on to have 
lifelong illness. In fact, this is expected; in addition to the psychosocial and physiologic 
stresses that occur in the perinatal period that may trigger mood episodes, peak fertility and 
birthing years overlap with the established age at onset range for BD. Additionally, it is 
to be expected that at least some of the women who were found to have a mood episode 
during the perinatal period, though had no diagnosis previously, were misdiagnosed or never 
diagnosed. Further, as our estimates include at least some data based on screening tools, 
some of these mood episodes are expected to be false-positives (likely at least 2% based on 
MDQ specificity).54

Still, the prevalence of BD in the general population and women outside of the perinatal 
period is not 20% but rather around 2%–3%.5 It is well-known that as many as 1 in 7 
women will experience a depressive episode in the perinatal period,55,56 many of whom 
will not meet criteria for another psychiatric illness before or after that time. Though surely 
some of these BD-spectrum episodes represent women who already had undiagnosed BD 
or who will go on to have lifelong illness, we may also be seeing women with episodes 
more circumscribed to the perinatal period itself. Prior studies57,58 have documented and 
discussed this phenomenon; however, it is considerably less understood than discrete 
depressive episodes in this period. Further, just as depressive episodes can occur as part of 
various psychiatric disorders, BD symptoms may occur as part of other psychiatric illnesses 
(eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder). It is important 
that future work examine how detection and management of BD and related symptoms may

need to be tailored for the perinatal population and its unique risk factors, challenges, and 
illness manifestations.

We also found that women with a known BD diagnosis preceding the perinatal period had 
a heightened risk of bipolar-spectrum mood episode occurrence/recurrence in pregnancy and 
the postpartum period. When compared with women with unipolar depression in our data, 
women with BD preceding the perinatal period had a substantially higher risk for depressive 
episode occurrence. This phenomenon has implications for treatment and monitoring of 
patients with known BD. If borne out in other studies, it also could be potentially useful in 
distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Council on Patient Safety in 
Women’s Health Care and other organizations recommend that obstetric and other front-
line providers screen for BD in the perinatal period prior to initiating pharmacotherapy 
for depression.59,60 Wisner et al44 found that 1 in 5 perinatal women with symptoms of 
depression (via EPDS) were likely to have BD. Given our findings that bipolar-spectrum 
mood episodes are more common in the perinatal time period and occur in both pregnancy 
and postpartum, strategies to improve screening and treatment may consider expanding 
to include universal screening for BD as part of their clinical guidance and workflow 
adaptations, alongside existing recommendations to universally screen for depression.60–63 
There are brief validated tools that can be administered alongside those for depression in 
prenatal and postpartum visits.64,65 Further, algorithms exist to help providers use screening 
tool results to inform subsequent assessment and treatment planning.66 Some clinical 
settings are starting to employ these. However, we also recognize that recommendations 
for increases in screening need to be considered in the larger clinical context, including 
feasibility, resources, and provider capacity to respond to a screen.67 As processes are put in 
obstetric practice to conduct universal depression screening, including BD in these protocols 
may be indicated and become more tenable.

In addition, screening for and detecting undiagnosed BD among women presenting 
with depressive symptoms before starting treatment is important because antidepressant 
monotherapy can precipitate mania and/or suicidality.19,20 Women with undetected BD 
or BD that is misdiagnosed as unipolar depression may be prescribed unopposed 
antidepressants preceding pregnancy, putting them at higher risk for a BD episode during 
the perinatal period. Conversely, women with BD on preexisting or newly prescribed mood 
stabilizers should be at decreased risk of a BD episode. This is an important area that 
merits further exploration. While a subset of our studies included women on psychotropic 
mediations, it was beyond the scope of this study to examine the protective or promoting 
effects of medications on the rate of BD mood episodes.

Our review also suggests that future recommendations may consider screening for BD 
and/or relevant symptoms more than once during pregnancy or postpartum. For example, 
screening in the first trimester may detect preexisting BD, while screening later in the 
postpartum period may detect new onset illness. This suggestion is supported by our finding 
of high pooled prevalences of episodes in both pregnancy and the postpartum period, 
indicating that mood onset can occur anytime in the perinatal period. Further, individual

studies like that of Sharma et al47 support this notion of screening more than once. They 
followed incident BD diagnoses that were diagnostic conversions from major depression. 
Of women previously diagnosed with unipolar depression, they found that 6.5% (n = 146) 
converted to BD in the perinatal period.

Further work is needed to establish the ideal time(s) to screen for BD and bipolar-spectrum 
mood episodes. The vast majority of the studies included in our meta-analyses enumerated 
episodes across the entire perinatal period or only postpartum. While there are nuanced 
differences seen among individual studies between pregnancy and the postpartum period, 
our meta-analyses yielded quite similar rates between pregnancy and postpartum. The 
limited studies in our review examining episode occurrence in pregnancy only indicated 
that this time period is critical to consider for illness onset/recurrence. More studies need 
to examine women that are currently pregnant to estimate differences in risk between 
pregnancy and the postpartum period. Further, our findings have implications for women of 
child-bearing age outside of the perinatal period. Future studies assessing prevalence of BD 
in people of child-bearing age who are not pregnant or postpartum in parallel to those who 
are pregnant or postpartum are necessary to help elucidate some of the risks specific to the 
perinatal period itself.

Our work provides a synthesis of the extant research describing aggregate overall and 
current mood episode prevalence rates of BD in perinatal women. It also indicates that 
significant gaps in the literature remain and further studies specific to BD in the perinatal 
period are necessary to make estimates more robust. Many studies that otherwise met 
all inclusion criteria and may have yielded useful information to contribute to prevalence 
estimates were excluded. For example, we excluded 25 because they did not address BD, 
despite an ability to do so (eg, used the SCID but reported data only on depression and 
anxiety). It appears that examining BD in the perinatal period has not been prioritized in 
studies in the ways that perinatal depression or anxiety have been.9 Bipolar-spectrum mood 
episodes other than depression need to be examined more thoroughly to provide more robust 
estimates in the perinatal time period.

Future work can help to address the specific design limitations seen in many studies in this 
review, such as including greater efforts to understand the characteristics of participants lost 
to follow-up and exploring and including confounders that may be pertinent risk factors 
for BD, including substance use and family history. Additionally, prospective efforts should 
strive to be more inclusive of other perinatal people, or those that do not identify as women, 
to estimate rates in other perinatal populations. Most studies included did not make mention 
the gender identities of their participants.

This review has many strengths, including its novel contribution to the field on an 
understudied area. It encompasses a comprehensive reference search. Data review and 
extraction were completed using multiple reviewers for scientific rigor. Limitations of this 
review include its small sample size and heterogeneity across studies, such that the pooled 
prevalence rates should be interpreted with caution. As aforementioned, pooled prevalences 
were estimated from diagnostic and screening tools, the latter of which likely inflated

articles from many disparate geographic areas were included.

CONCLUSION

Perinatal mental health conditions, including BD, are now cited as one of the leading 
obstetric complications in the US and are a preventable cause of maternal mortality.59,68 
This review suggests that recognizing the potential for BD and BD-spectrum mood episodes 
in the perinatal period is important, given the prevalence estimates in this population and 
the associated morbidity and mortality of untreated illness. It also emphasizes the need for 
more population-based and prospective studies to corroborate our findings and draw further 
conclusions to build on this study and elucidate the extent to which BD affects the perinatal 
population. This review may inform clinical care and screening recommendations, such that 
all perinatal women are screened for BD at least once. Such screening may improve the 
identification of women at risk and connect them to the best clinical care possible.

Clinical Points

•

•

•

Perinatal mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD), are now 
cited as one of the leading obstetric complications in the US and are a 
preventable cause of maternal mortality. However, there are no current studies 
that aggregate BD rates from multiple data sources.

In perinatal women, particularly those who present with symptoms of 
depression, providers should consider screening for BD. Rates of BD-
spectrum mood episodes may be higher than in the general population and 
than previously estimated.

Providers should always screen for BD before initiating antidepressant 
pharmacotherapy.
