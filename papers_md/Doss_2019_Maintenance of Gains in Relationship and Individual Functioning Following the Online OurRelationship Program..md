Abstract

In the United States, more than 40% of marriages end in divorce and more than one third of intact 
marriages are distressed. Unfortunately, only a minority of couples seek couple therapy to improve 
their relationships. Online interventions, with their increased reach and reduced costs, offer the 
potential to improve relationships nationwide. The online OurRelationship program has been 
shown in previous nationwide studies to improve relationship and individual functioning. The 
present study examined whether initial gains in the OurRelationship program were maintained in 
the following year and whether the extent of maintenance varied across important demographic 
and individual factors. In this study, 151 distressed heterosexual couples (302 individuals) who 
were randomized to the OurRelationship program were assessed 3 and 12 months following the 
intervention. Initial gains in relationship satisfaction, relationship confidence, and negative 
relationship quality were maintained through 12 months; positive relationship quality significantly 
improved over follow-up. Furthermore, couples maintained their initial gains in depressive 
symptoms, perceived health, work functioning, and quality of life; anxious symptoms continued to 
significantly decrease over follow-up. Finally, there was no evidence that historically underserved 
groups – racial/ethnic minorities, lower income couples, or rural couples – experienced greater 
deterioration. In fact, Hispanic couples reported continued improvement in relationship confidence 
and negative relationship quality in the 12 months following the program. The ability of the 
OurRelationship program – an eight-hour, primarily self-help program – to create long-lasting

Introduction

Relationship distress is a pervasive and intractable issue. Without intervention, dissatisfied 
couples on average will continue to struggle or deteriorate (Baucom, Hahlweg, & Kuschel, 
2003). Furthermore, the negative effects of relationship dissatisfaction reach beyond the 
romantic dyad. Individuals who are unhappy in their relationship report worse mental health 
(Whisman, 2007), worse physical health (Robles, Slatcher, Trombello, & McGinn, 2013), 
and poorer functioning both socially and at work (Whisman & Uebelacker, 2006). Children 
of distressed couples are likewise negatively impacted by relationship distress (e.g. O’Leary 
& Vidair, 2005). In order to combat the many negative effects of relationship distress, couple 
therapy has been widely validated in the literature, but underutilized by distressed couples. 
Meta-analyses of couple therapy report medium effect sizes (e.g. d = 0.585; Shadish & 
Baldwin, 2005); however, only 19% of intact couples seek therapy (Whisman, Beach, & 
Snyder, 2008), and prior to divorce, fewer than 40% of couples seek therapy (Johnson et al., 
2002).

To increase the reach of evidence-based couple interventions, scholars have developed 
online programs adapted from validated, in-person approaches. A meta-analysis of flexibly-
delivered relationship education (RE) courses revealed that blended programs, which 
combine both self-directed methods such as workbooks or audio recordings with traditional 
methods such as phone calls or classes with an educator or paraprofessional, are effective in 
improving relationship quality (d = 0.43) and increasing communication skills (d = 0.72; 
McAllister, Duncan, & Hawkins, 2012). However, these interventions have not targeted 
distressed couples.

Due to lower burden on professional time, blended and self-help programs have the capacity 
to reach more distressed couples than can traditional therapy alone. Indeed, a survey of 
cohabiting, engaged, or married heterosexual individuals indicated that both distressed and 
non-distressed individuals preferred a relationship-focused website as the most likely source 
of help seeking in the future, more so than going to couple therapy together or doing a DVD 
and workbook with their partner (Georgia & Doss, 2013). Therefore, it is critical that 
researchers work to develop online programs that suit the needs of distressed couples. One 
such program, the OurRelationship program, is an 8-hour long web-adapted version of 
Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT; Christensen, Wheeler, Doss, & Jacobson, 
2014) that combines online modules and videoconferencing calls with a paraprofessional 
coach. A nationwide randomized controlled trial showed that, compared to couples in a 
waitlist control group, the program produced medium effects in relationship functioning 
(e.g., satisfaction d = 0.69) and smaller effects in individual functioning such as depression

(d = 0.50) and perceived health (d = 0.23) by the end of the program (Doss et al., 2016). 
However, it is unclear how these changes are maintained over follow up.

Maintenance of Gains in In-Person Couple Interventions

Changes over follow-up—Following couple therapy, there is evidence of both 
maintenance and deterioration of gains. In the largest study of in-person couple therapy to 
date comparing IBCT to traditional behavioral couple therapy (TBCT), participants reported 
large gains in relationship satisfaction during treatment (within group Cohen’s d = 0.86; 
Christensen et al., 2004). However, analyses of change during the first two years following 
therapy revealed participants in both groups experienced an initial steep decline in 
satisfaction (a loss of 3.8 DAS points for IBCT and a loss of 5.9 DAS points for TBCT) 
followed by a gradual increase in satisfaction during the remainder of the 2 year follow-up (a 
gain of 2.7 DAS points in IBCT and 2.5 DAS points in TBCT), with IBCT showing 
significantly but not dramatically better maintenance than TBCT (Christensen, Atkins, 
Baucom, & Yi, 2010; Christensen, Atkins, Yi, Baucom, & George, 2006). Across studies, a 
meta-analysis of marriage and family therapy reported an average effect size of d = 0.52 
over follow-up, slightly smaller than d = 0.65 at post-treatment (Shadish & Baldwin, 2003).

While these results are generally promising for couple therapy, many couples do not have 
the time or means to afford a lengthy course of in-person treatment. Brief, RE or assessment 
and feedback interventions for couples have also been evaluated over follow up and show 
mixed results. One meta-analysis of experimental studies reported improvements in both 
relationship quality (d = 0.31) and communication (d = 0.45; Hawkins, Blanchard, Baldwin, 
& Fawcett, 2008) over 3–6 month follow-ups. Eighty two percent of RE programs with 
follow-up durations of at least a year indicated that couples were able to maintain their 
relationship satisfaction (Halford & Bodenmann, 2013). Since these reviews were published, 
several other notable studies of RE have been published. Couples in the Marriage Checkup, 
a brief assessment, feedback, and skills building intervention reported significantly greater 
intimacy (d = .36) and non-significant improvements in satisfaction and acceptance 18 
months after the initial intervention (Cordova et al., 2014). Additionally, a four-year follow-
up of couples in the Couple CARE program, a DVD-based relationship education program, 
found significant intervention effects on relationship satisfaction at 6 months (d = 0.47), but 
not at 12 months or later (Halford et al., 2017).

There have been limited studies of the long-term effects of RE programs on individual 
functioning – and the existing studies yield mixed results. The Couple CARE program did 
not significantly improve mental health compared to the control group either during the 
intervention or over four-year follow up (Halford et al., 2017). Likewise, in the large-scale 
Building Strong Families study, RE programs for unmarried parents had no effect on 
depressive symptoms at 36-month follow up (Wood et al., 2012). However, in the large 
Supporting Healthy Marriage study, women but not men reported significant decreases in 
psychological distress compared to the control group at 30-month follow-up (Cohen’s d = 
−0.09; Lundquist et al., 2014).

Prediction of changes over follow-up

Understanding what predicts changes over follow-up will facilitate directing couples to the 
appropriate resources based on their initial presentation. Demographic characteristics are 
often studied as predictors of treatment outcome. For in-person therapy, being married 
longer and being employed are inconsistently associated with better outcomes at follow up 
(Baucom Atkins, Rowe, Doss, & Christensen, 2015; Baucom, Atkins, Simpson, & 
Christensen, 2009; Snyder, Mangrum, & Wills, 1993). For RE programs, a meta-analysis of 
low-income couples found participants with longer relationship length improved marginally 
more than couples with shorter relationship length. Additionally, an investigation into 
couples in the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project found that pre-treatment 
sociodemographic risk, operationally defined as less education, unemployment, or receiving 
public assistance among other indicators, did not predict gains in relationship satisfaction at 
30 months (Williamson, Altman, Hsueh, & Bradbury, 2016). A second study found that risk 
did predict satisfaction over follow-up such that high risk couples declined at a slower rate 
than low risk couples (Williamson et al., 2015).

The extent to which couples continue to improve or maintain their gains over follow-up is 
also dependent on initial levels of relationship functioning. In a sample of in-person couple 
therapy, number of steps towards divorce predicted treatment gains over follow-up such that 
more steps toward divorce was associated with a greater likelihood of being separated at 5-
years post treatment (Baucom et al., 2015). Couples who enter RE distressed have greater 
potential for improvement than initially satisfied couples; however, the results are 
inconsistent as to how this predicts changes over follow-up for couples participating in in-
person RE. A meta-analysis of RE for low-income couples found that greater percentage of 
the sample initially in the distressed range was associated with larger effects at post 
treatment (Hawkins & Erickson, 2015); unfortunately, follow-up analyses were not included. 
Recent RE studies that have examined whether initial satisfaction predicts changes over 
follow-up have yielded mixed results, with some studies showing RE was more effective for 
unhappier couples (Halford et al., 2017; Quirk, Strokoff, Owen, France, & Bergen, 2014) 
while other studies found that initial satisfaction did not moderate intervention effects 
(Trillingsgaard, Fentz, Hawrilenko, & Cordova, 2016).

Maintenance of Gains in Online Interventions

Although online interventions for relationships show promising outcomes at post treatment, 
it is unclear if those effects will be maintained over a longer period of time. However, given 
that most web-based programs have a lower intervention dose than in-person programs, it is 
possible that web-based programs will see higher rates of relapse.

Changes over follow-up—To our knowledge, the only follow-up study of online RE 
programs is for the ePREP program. In this study, couples’ initial improvements in physical 
and psychological aggression were maintained over one year follow-up (Braithwaite & 
Fincham, 2014). In online programs for individual problems, three different implementations 
of online cognitive behavioral therapy found effects were maintained for significant 
improvements for insomnia (Ritterband et al., 2017), mild to moderate depression (Ruwaard

et al., 2009), and panic symptoms (Ruwaard, Broeksteeg, Schrieken, Emmelkamp, & Lange, 
2010) for a year or more.

Prediction of changes over follow-up—To our knowledge, there are no studies that 
attempt to predict change over follow up for an online relationship focused intervention. In 
studies of online programs for individual difficulties, a meta-analyses of self-directed 
internet cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression found none of the tested 
demographic participant characteristics significantly predicted effects during the 
intervention (the meta-analysis did not examine prediction during follow-up; Karyotaki et 
al., 2017). Additionally, one study of a web-based CBT treatment for depression found that 
pre-treatment level of depressive symptoms was positively correlated with improvements 
over follow-up and medication use was negatively correlated with reduction of depressive 
symptoms during follow-up (Ruwaard et al., 2009). Unfortunately, individual participant 
characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or SES were not tested as predicting variables of 
outcomes over follow-up. Further work is need to understand if these web-based 
interventions are equally effective for all groups, especially as increased funding is directed 
towards online programs.

Current Study

The present study had two primary aims. First, we sought to examine whether gains in 
relationship functioning observed during the OurRelationship program were maintained in 
the year following the intervention. Based on follow-up results from in-person couple 
therapy and the limited body of research on online relationship and individual interventions, 
we expected that couples’ initial gains during the OurRelationship program on both 
relationship and individual variables would be maintained in the year following the 
intervention.

Second, we sought to examine whether maintenance or deterioration of program effects 
would differ across important demographic and individual characteristics. One of the 
purported advantages of online interventions is their potential for broad reach – especially to 
serve individuals who are underserved by in-person interventions. If historically underserved 
populations (e.g., ethnic or racial minorities, low-income individuals, or rural individuals) 
were less able to maintain the gains obtained in the program, it would place important 
limitations on the ability of the program to effectively serve those populations. In contrast, if 
all groups were able to maintain their gains – or if currently underserved groups 
demonstrated superior maintenance – it would point to the utility of web-based interventions 
to reduce current disparities in services available to those populations. Additionally, we 
investigated whether individuals’ initial level of difficulty in individual functioning (e.g., 
depression, anxiety) would predict their ability to maintain those gains in those domains in 
the following year.

A total of 151 heterosexual couples (302 individuals) were randomly assigned to complete 
the intervention. (An additional 149 couples were randomized to a waitlist control group but 
they were not assessed during the follow-up period [Doss et al., 2016]; thus, they are not 
included in the present study.) Eighty-one percent of couples were married, 4.2% were 
engaged, and 14.8% were cohabiting but were not engaged or married. Couples had been 
together for an average of 9.8 years (SD = 8.7 years) and most had children (74.5%). 
Participants were mostly in their 30’s (range = 21 – 65 years; M = 37.1 years; SD = 9.3 
years) and were generally representative of the United States. They largely identified as 
Caucasian, non-Hispanic (76%), with 18% identifying as African American, 10% as 
Hispanic, 2.6% as Asian American, 1% as American Indian, 1% as Pacific Islander, and 5% 
as other. Thirty percent of participants had a high school diploma or GED equivalent, 19.8% 
had an associate’s degree or vocational training, 28.8% had a bachelor’s degree, and 21.1% 
had graduate or doctoral training. Most were employed full-time (63.3%), with 11.8% 
employed part time, 11.8% as full time-homemakers, 5.1% working as full-time students, 
and 8% unemployed. Average household income was $96,439 (mdn = $65,000), with 30.9% 
of couples reporting household incomes below 200% of the national poverty line.

To be eligible for the study, couples had to in a heterosexual married, engaged, or cohabiting 
relationship (of at least 6 months duration). Furthermore, their relationship had to be 
distressed, defined as both partners scoring less than 0.5 SD – or one partner scoring less 
than 1.0 SD – below the population mean. All participants had to be between the ages of 21 
and 64 (inclusive), live in the United States, and deny moderate-to-severe levels of suicidal 
ideation and injury or fear resulting from intimate partner violence in the past three months.

Eligible couples were asked to complete approximately seven hours of online materials 
comprised of three phases. In the first phase, couples received feedback about strengths and 
weaknesses in their relationship, which was designed to help them pick a relationship 
problem on which to focus for the remainder of the program. In the second phase, couples 
developed a DEEP Understanding – or how natural Differences, hidden Emotions, External 
stress, and Patterns of communication created or exacerbated their relationship problem. 
Finally, in the third phase, couples considered which parts of the problem were more 
appropriate to accept and which were more appropriate to change; they then worked to 
develop specific solutions. Each member of the couple generally completed the online 
activities on their own; however, at the end of each phase, both members of the couples 
came together for a conversation where the program displayed what they had written. The 
online activities were supplemented by four, 15-minute calls of coach support at the time of 
enrollment and throughout the program. Coaches were graduate level students trained in the 
intervention. (See Doss et al., 2016 for a detailed description of recruitment, intervention 
procedures, and eligibility criteria).

Measures

During the follow-up period, participants were asked to complete assessments 3 and 12 
months after estimated program completion (5 and 14 months after randomization). 
Participants were paid $25 in gift cards for completing each follow-up assessment. As an 
additional incentive, following completion of their final assessment at 12 months, 
participants received emailed feedback on their responses. They were also offered the 
opportunity to schedule a call with their coach to discuss this feedback; however, very few 
couples scheduled those calls. All procedures were approved by the institutional review 
board at the University of Miami.

All participants completed baseline measures of relationship and individual functioning, and 
were re-assessed at approximately 2, 5, and 8 weeks following initial assessment, and again 
at 3- and 12-months post-intervention.

Relationship satisfaction—The 16-item version of the Couples Satisfaction Index 
(CSI-16; Funk & Rogge, 2007) was used to measure global relationship satisfaction. 
Participants rated how much they agreed with questions such as: “In general, how satisfied 
are you with your relationship?” Mean Cronbach’s alpha for each time point was 0.97 for 
the present sample (range = 0.96 to 0.98).

Positive and negative relationship quality—Participants were asked to rate four 
positive and four negative aspects of their relationship using The Positive and Negative 
Relationship Quality scale (PNRQ; Fincham & Rogge, 2010). Items were rated on a Likert 
scale from 0 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). In the present study, reliability was excellent for 
each assessment point for both relationship positives (mean Cronbach’s alpha = 0.95 [range 
= 0.94 to 0.96]) and negatives (mean Cronbach’s alpha = 0.95 [range = 0.93 to 0.97]).

Relationship confidence—A two-item version of the Confidence Scale (Rhoades, 
Stanley, & Markman, 2009) was used to measure relationship confidence: “I believe we can 
handle whatever conflicts will arise in the future,” and “I feel good about our prospects to 
make this relationship work.” In this study, reliability for each assessment point was 
excellent (Cronbach’s alpha= 0.93 [range = 0.91 to 0.96]).

Depression—The 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression 
(CES-D 10; Cole, Rabin, Smith, & Kaufman, 2004) is a well-validated measure of 
depression. Items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Scores ranged from 0 to 30, with 
scores greater than 11 considered at risk for clinical depression (Cole et al., 2004). Mean 
Cronbach’s alpha in the present sample = 0.83 (range = 0.79 to 0.85).

Anxiety—The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, 
& Lowe, 2006) is a well-validated measure of GAD based on DSM-IV symptom criteria. 
Scores range from 0 to 21, with scores greater than 9 indicating moderate anxiety. In this 
sample, the GAD-7 demonstrated excellent reliability for each time point (Cronbach’s 
alpha= 0.93 [range = 0.92 to 0.95]).

Perceived Health—Participants were asked to rate their perceived health over the last four 
weeks using a single item from the Quality of Life-Brief (WHO; WHOQOL Group, 1998): 
Responses were rated using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very 
satisfied) for the following question: “How satisfied are you with your health?” In the 
present study, scores below 4 (satisfied) were coded as indicative of problematic individual 
functioning.

Work Functioning—Work functioning was measured using the following item on a scale 
from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor): “Please rate your ability to function at work. If you do not 
work outside the home, please rate your ability to complete household tasks.” The item was 
reverse scored such that higher scores indicated better work functioning, with scores below 3 
(good) used in the present study as indicative of possible impairment in work functioning.

Quality of Life—Participants rated their subjective quality of life using a single item from 
the Quality of Life-Brief (WHO; WHOQOL Group, 1998). Responses were rated using a 5-
point Likert scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good) for the following question: “How 
would you rate your quality of life?” In the present study, scores below 4 (good) were 
considered indicative of potentially problematic individual functioning.

Missing Data

At the three-month assessment, 25% of participants had missing data and, at the 12-month 
assessment, 21% of participants had missing data. Seventeen percent of participants had 
missing data at both the three- and twelve-month assessments. A series of multi-level 
logistic regressions indicated that missing data at either of the assessments was not 
significantly related to relationship status at the beginning of the intervention (married or 
not), relationship status at the follow-up assessment (together or broken-up/separated/
divorced), amount of change during the intervention, education, race, ethnicity, income, or 
rural location. However, missing data at either three- or twelve-months assessments was 
significantly higher in those who did not complete the intervention [b = 1.811; OR = 6.119 
(2.279–16.431), t = 3.626, p < .001]. Therefore, non-completion was grand-mean centered 
and entered as a control variable in all analyses so that trajectories of change would 
represent the average change for all couples, not just those that completed the program. To 
account for the missing data, all analyses were conducted using multiple imputation and 
Full-Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML).

Data Analysis

To obtain estimates of change, we simultaneously estimated separate linear slopes of change 
during the intervention and during follow-up using piecewise (or spline) models and two-
rate coding suggested by Raudenbush and Bryk (2002). Thus, in Level 1, we centered the 
intercept at the end of the intervention and entered as predictors: a) time in weeks prior to

parameters (to determine whether intercepts or slopes varied across gender). A random 
effect was retained for the intercept only. Finally, at Level 3, non-completion of the program 
was grand-mean centered and entered as a predictor of the intercept and both slopes (so that 
estimates of change were intent-to-treat analyses, not completer analyses). Random effects 
were estimated for the intercept and both slopes. To predict amount of change, the analyses 
described above were re-run with the putative predictor entered as a predictor of the 
intercept and both slopes. Initial level of the dependent variable and education level were 
entered as predictors in Level 2; all other predictors were entered in Level 3. All predictors 
were entered into separate models.

Results

By the 12-month assessment, 84% of couples were still together and 6% of couples had 
broken-up, separated, or divorced; we were unable to determine relationship status for the 
remaining 10% of couples (n = 15 couples).

Change Over Follow-Up

The first aim of this study was to determine whether couples were able to maintain the gains 
they achieved during the intervention in the subsequent twelve months. Raw means and 
standard deviations are present in Table 1.

Relationship functioning—As reported elsewhere (Doss et al., 2016), relationship 
satisfaction, relationship confidence, and negative relationship quality all significantly 
improved during the program (all p < .001; within-group |d| = 0.64 to 0.93); positive 
relationship quality did not significantly change (within-group d = −0.01). In the twelve 
months following the program, couples experienced neither significant improvements nor 
deteriorations in the three domains that evidenced gains during the program (satisfaction, 
confidence, negatives; within-group d over follow-up = −0.11 to 0.08). However, positive 
relationship quality, which did not improve during the program, showed significant increases 
over the follow-up period (b = 0.025, t = 3.613, p < .001, within-group d = 0.17). 
Maintenance of relationship functioning variables did not significantly differ by gender. Full 
results are presented in Table 2.

Individual functioning—Consistent with previous analyses (Doss et al., 2016), 
participants experienced significant improvements during the program in depressive 
symptoms, anxious symptoms, work functioning, quality of life, and perceived health (all p 
< .001; within-group |d| = 0.23 to 0.67). In both the full sample and in individuals who began 
the program in the clinical or problematic range in these areas (as defined in the Methods 
section), participants were able to maintain their gains over follow-up in depressive 
symptoms, work functioning, quality of life, and perceived health. Furthermore, within the 
full sample, anxious symptoms continued to significantly decrease in the year following the 
program (b = −0.015, t = −2.703, p = .008, within-group d = −0.12); the pattern was the 
same for individuals who began the program with a clinical level of anxious symptoms (b = 
−.017) but did not reach significance due to the smaller sample size. Results in both the full 
sample and the sample with initial difficulties were generally similar across genders. Indeed,

the only significant gender difference was that, within the sub-sample who began the study 
reporting difficulties in quality of life, men experienced significantly more deterioration than 
women over the follow-up period (b = −0.007 t = −2.181, p = 0.030, Cohen’s d = −0.34). 
Full results are presented in Table 3.

Prediction of Changes Over Follow-Up

The second aim of this study was to determine whether maintenance of gains over follow-up 
varied as a function of race (Black or not), ethnicity (Hispanic or not), household income, 
rural location, education, and relationship length. Additionally, given previous findings that 
initial levels of difficulties predicted amount of gains during the program (Doss et al., 2016), 
we sought to determine whether values of the construct at the beginning of the intervention 
affected maintenance of gains over follow-up.

Relationship functioning—Couples where one or both individuals reported they were 
Hispanic experienced significantly larger improvements during follow-up in relationship 
confidence (b = 0.023, t = 2.963, p = .004) and negative relationship quality (b = −0.040, t = 
−2.083, p = .039). Results from the remaining analyses revealed no significant prediction of 
maintenance during follow-up across the seven predictors or four dependent variables (a 
total of 28 analyses). Predictions of change over the follow-up period are presented in Table 
4; full results for the entire models are available from the authors.

Individual functioning—Individuals who began the program with better quality of life (b 
= −0.002, t = −2.008, p = .044) and better perceived health (b = −0.006, t = −3.909, p < .
001) experienced significantly fewer gains over follow-up in those domains than those 
individuals who began the program with difficulties in these domains. None of the remaining 
prediction analyses were significant (a total of 35 analyses). Predictions of changes over the 
follow-up period are presented in Table 5; full results for the entire models are available 
from the authors.

Discussion

The results of the present study indicate that the OurRelationship program can create 
meaningful and lasting improvement for those experiencing serious relationship problems. 
Significant improvements in relationship satisfaction, relationship confidence, and negative 
relationship quality experienced during the program were maintained for at least a year. 
Notably, although positive relationship quality did not significantly improve during the 
program, it significantly improved in the 12 months following the program. Furthermore, 
initial gains in individual functioning –depressive and anxious symptoms as well as 
perceived health – were also maintained through one year; indeed, anxiety symptoms 
continued to significantly improve over follow-up. Moreover, there was no evidence that 
historically underserved groups – racial / ethnic minorities, lower income couples, or rural 
couples – experienced greater deterioration. In fact, Hispanic couples reported continued 
improvement in relationship confidence and negative relationship quality in the 12 months 
following the program. Implications of these results are discussed below.

Maintenance of Gains for 12 Months

The ability of an eight-hour, primarily self-help program to create long-lasting 
improvements in distressed relationships is notable. With only 37% of divorcing couples 
seeking help for their relationship before divorce (Johnson et al., 2002) and an additional 
31% of intact couples reporting relationship distress (Whisman et al., 2008), the 
OurRelationship program has the potential to improve the lives of many distressed couples.

Reasons for maintenance

Three aspects of the OurRelationship program may facilitate maintenance of gains in the 
year following the intervention. First, it may be that the OurRelationship program, with its 
reduced access barriers, is reaching couples earlier in the distress process – before a focused 
relationship problem infects the rest of the relationship. Indeed, our initial hypothesis was 
that the OurRelationship program would serve as a secondary prevention, intervening after 
problems developed but before serious distress ensued (Doss, Benson, Georgia, & 
Christensen, 2013). Although couples in the present study were equally distressed on a 
global measure of relationship satisfaction at pre-treatment as were couples presenting to in-
person couple therapy (e.g., Christensen et al., 2004), couples seeking relationship help 
online may be doing so in a moment of crisis rather than at the end of a prolonged period of 
distress. In support of this idea, couples in the Christensen et al. (2004) clinical trial of in-
person couple therapy had to meet distress criteria repeatedly over several weeks in order to 
qualify for the study rather than just once in the current study. In addition, couples 
presenting to the OurRelationship program but randomly assigned to the waitlist control 
group significantly improved in relationship satisfaction (within-group d = 0.28); in contrast, 
couples seeking in-person couple therapy who are randomly assigned to a control group 
generally do no experience relationship improvement (within-group d = −0.06; Baucom et 
al., 2003). Second, change may be more durable because improvements experienced during 
the OurRelationship program are achieved without extensive scaffolding from a therapist 
and occur within the more naturalistic context of couples’ homes. Finally, OurRelationship’s 
focus on developing more tolerant conceptualizations of relationship problems rather than 
on rule-governed changes may make improvements more durable. Indeed, couples in IBCT, 
the acceptance-based couple therapy on which the OurRelationship program is based, 
experienced only minimal deteriorations in the year following treatment (within-group d = 
−0.04; Christensen et al., 2006). Also supporting the durability of these types of changes, a 
brief conflict reappraisal intervention prevented declines in multiple domains of marital 
quality a year later (Finkel, Slotter, Luchies, Walton, & Gross, 2013).

Increases in relationship positives—Although most domains of relationship and 
individual functioning demonstrated maintenance in the year following the program, positive 
relationship quality significantly improved during this period. This improvement is notable 
because: a) the program included more of a focus on reducing negatives than increasing 
positives and b) positive relationship quality did not significantly improve during the 
intervention. It may be that an initial reduction in negatives (i.e., conflict about the selected 
problem, global negative relationship quality) paved the way for the global positive 
relationship quality to improve in subsequent months. If the program helped couples 
overcome their central relationship problem, it makes sense that they would then be able to

recapture some of the positives (e.g., time together, sex) they may have stopped because of 
negativity. However, it should be noted that the magnitude of the total improvement from 
pre-intervention through follow-up was very small (within-group d = 0.16), especially 
compared to the magnitude of decreases in relationship negatives during that same period 
(within-group d = −0.77); therefore, more should be done to strengthen positives aspects of 
the relationship.

Minimal Prediction of Maintenance from Baseline Characteristics

In this study, we took an exploratory approach to prediction of maintenance, conducting 63 
analyses without controlling for experiment-wide error. Analyses yielded four significant 
predictors of maintenance; based on chance alone, one would expect three significant 
predictors with Type I error set at 0.05. Therefore, the most notable finding from the 
prediction analyses was the overall general lack of significant findings.

Demographic characteristics—Results indicated that underserved groups had equal or 
superior maintenance of gains as non-underserved groups. The general lack of differential 
maintenance in the twelve months following the program mirrors the lack of differential 
change during the program for these groups (Author Citation, 2017). The one exception to 
this pattern was Hispanic couples. During the program, Hispanic couples experienced 
significantly greater gains in perceived health and quality of life but significantly smaller 
gains in relationship confidence (Author Citation, 2017). However, in the 12 months 
following the program, Hispanic couples experienced significantly greater improvements in 
relationship confidence and negative relationship quality – offsetting their smaller initial 
gains during the program.

Given that the effects of the OurRelationship program were generally not significantly 
different for underserved couples over the long term, the program has the potential to reduce 
health disparities in receipt of relationship interventions. For example, African American 
(Boyd-Franklin, 2003), low income, and rural couples (Johnson et al., 2002) are all less 
likely to receive couple therapy before getting divorced; Hispanic couples are less likely to 
receive mental health care services in general (Luca, Blosnich, Hentschel, King, & Amen, 
2015), which likely extends to receipt of couple therapy.

Initial difficulties—Maintenance of gains also tended not to significantly differ across 
initial levels of difficulties in relationship or individual functioning. For seven of the nine 
domains of functioning examined in the present study, participant’s level of distress in that 
domain was unrelated to the extent to which they were able to maintain those gains. In two 
domains –perceived health and quality of life – individuals who began the program with 
greater difficulties experienced significantly better maintenance than those with fewer initial 
difficulties.

This pattern of findings is notable because it suggests that participants who stand to benefit 
most from these programs – those with the greatest initial needs – are equally likely (or 
perhaps even more likely) to benefit from the program over the long term. Indeed, paired 
with findings that gains during the program were significantly larger for individuals who 
started the program with greater difficulties in depressive symptoms and poor quality of life

(Doss et al., 2016), relationship interventions such as the OurRelationship program seem to 
be especially indicated for individuals who have both relationship and individual difficulties. 
The present results are also consistent with a growing body of literature indicating that 
relationship interventions more broadly may be especially indicated for couples who have 
more initial difficulties or are at higher risk for developing difficulties (e.g., Halford et al., 
2017; Hawkins & Erickson, 2015).

Limitations and Future Directions

Despite the strengths of this study, there are several limitations that should be noted. The 
primary limitation is that the waitlist control group was allowed access to the intervention 
after two months (the end of the initial treatment period); therefore, there was no control 
group during the follow-up period. Therefore, it is not possible to say what the trajectories of 
change over follow-up would have looked like in the absence of the intervention. It is 
possible that waitlisted couples would have recovered on their own (without the 
intervention), that they would have continued to deteriorate over the 12-month period, or that 
they would have experienced no change. However, other studies with a mixture of distressed 
and non-distressed couples have generally found that waitlisted couples do not significantly 
change in relationship functioning over a 12-month period (e.g., Cordova et al., 2014; 
Trillingsgaard et al., 2016), suggesting that the superior outcomes observed at the end of the 
program (Doss et al., 2016) would continue to be observed as much as a year following the 
program. A second limitation of the present study is that it only utilized three assessment 
points to assess change over follow-up – precluding detailed examinations of different 
shapes of change and whether the shape of change varied by pre-treatment characteristics. 
Third, 17% of participants did not provide data at either follow-up assessment, precluding 
modeling of their changes over follow-up; furthermore, these participants were more likely 
to also have not completed the intervention. While we undertook statistical approaches to 
protect the results against bias (multiple imputation, controlling for intervention 
completion), it is possible that these statistical adjustments did not fully adjust the results for 
the missing data. Fourth, predictions of changes over follow-up were underpowered to detect 
small differences between groups; with larger samples of underrepresented groups, 
differences in maintenance of gains may be detected. Fifth, the single-item measure of work 
functioning was created for this study and likely does not fully capture functioning across a 
variety of work settings (employment, education, home) or functioning in those who are 
unemployed. Finally, this study lacked a measure of observed communication – a common 
outcome in RE programs.

In future studies, the results of the present study could be expanded in several ways. 
Although the demographic groups examined here did not generally differ significantly in 
their maintenance of gains over follow-up, this question should be explored in larger and 
more diverse samples. Furthermore, there was significant unexplained variability in follow-
up trajectories; future studies should explore predictors of maintenance of gains over follow-
up other than demographic factors. Additionally, examinations of mechanisms of 
maintenance in the year following the intervention would yield useful insights into how the 
program could be strengthened in subsequent iterations.

Conclusion

Page 14

Based on the results of this study, self-help programs like OurRelationship appear to offer an 
exciting opportunity to expand the menu of services available for distressed couples – either 
in combination with in-person services or independent from them. Traditionally, RE 
programs have been conceptualized as helping happy couples prevent relationship 
deterioration. When offered as part of pre-marital education – one of the more common 
forms of formal RE in the United States (Johnson et al., 2002) – this conceptualization likely 
holds. However, when RE is offered more broadly, approximately one quarter to one half of 
couples report their relationships are distressed or experiencing difficulties (Bradford, 
Hawkins, & Acker, 2015). Therefore, programs like OurRelationship could be offered as a 
supplement to typically group-based RE to help distressed couples focus on their pressing 
relationship problems.

Programs like OurRelationship also overcome barriers of other types of interventions for 
distressed couples. Because of their online and self-help nature, couples have more 
flexibility about when, and from where, they are completed – making it easier for couples to 
accommodate work, childcare, or other demands. Indeed, couples report seeking relationship 
help from self-help books (Doss, Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009) and from the internet 
(Georgia & Doss, 2013; Trillingsgaard, 2017) at higher rates than from in-person services. 
Additionally, because the coach calls are heavily scripted, provide supportive accountability, 
and only solidify skills/changes initiated by the self-help materials, they do not require the 
skill of a licensed therapist. As a result, programs like OurRelationship can be provided 
relatively inexpensively and delivered across state lines – two of the primary barriers to 
widespread implementation of telehealth interventions (Doss, Feinberg, Rothman, Roddy, & 
Comer, 2018).

Taken together, results of this study highlight the durability and generalizability of effects of 
the OurRelationship program. As a result, the program seems to have the potential to 
improve the lives of distressed couples on a broad scale and reduce disparities in access to 
effective relationship interventions.
