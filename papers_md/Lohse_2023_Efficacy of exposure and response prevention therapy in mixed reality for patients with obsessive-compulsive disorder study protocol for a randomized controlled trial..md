Abstract
Many patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not receive cognitive behavioral therapy with 
exposure and response prevention (first line treatment for OCD), for example, due to patients’ fear of the 
exposure and reservations of the therapists. Technology-supported exposure (e.g., exposure therapy with 
response prevention in mixed reality [MERP]) for patients with OCD may help to overcome this obstacle. Building 
upon findings of our pilot study objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, expectations of treatment 
success, feasibility, and acceptance of MERP as well as to identify possible limitations. In total, 64 outpatients 
with contamination-related OCD will be recruited and randomized to one of two conditions: MERP (six sessions 
in six weeks) and self-guided exposure therapy (six exercises in six weeks). Participants will be assessed before 
(baseline), after the six-week intervention period (post), as well as three months after post assessment (follow-up) 
regarding symptomatology (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; Y-BOCS), their subjective evaluation of MERP 
(acceptance) and sense of presence. The planned study is the first to investigate MERP in patients with OCD.

Background
Obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is  a  mental  dis-
order  characterized  by  intrusive  thoughts  (obsessions), 
and ritualized, repetitive behavior (compulsions) that aim 
to reduce negative feelings [2, 3]. It has a lifetime preva-
lence of 1–3% [4, 5], and often takes a chronic course if 
untreated  [6].  Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  with 
exposure  and  response  prevention  (ERP)  is  the  first  line 
treatment  for  OCD,  and  is  recommended  by  national 
and  international  guidelines  [7].  In  ERP  the  individual 
is exposed to stimuli, which trigger obsessions, compul-
sions  or  avoidance  behavior.  The  goal  of  ERP  is  to  con-
front  feared  objects  or  situations,  without  performing 
compulsions or avoiding the stimuli.

 Although ERP is highly effective, it is often not [8,  9] 
or  incorrectly  [10,  11]  applied.  Furthermore,  only  every 
third  therapist  or  even  less  uses  ERP  in  vivo  [9,  12]  and 
less  than  one  third  of  those  who  practice  ERP  in  vivo 
apply it according to the guidelines [12], leading to a seri-
ous  treatment  gap  –  the  difference  between  the  preva-
lence of a disorder and the treated proportion of affected 
individuals.  A  large  longitudinal  study  conducted  in  the 
United States offers insight into the prevailing treatment 
gap.  In  total,  59%  of  patients  with  OCD  were  recom-
mended  CBT  but  only  44%  received  it  [13].  According 
to a review from Kohn et al. [14] the treatment gap (i.e., 
untreated  patients)  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  estimated 
between 60% and 68% and in the United States and Ger-
many it is estimated at 59%, contributing to a rather low 
remission after treatment rate of 46.3% in Germany [15].

There  are  three  main  categories  of  treatment  barriers 
concerning  the  treatment  itself:  the  patient,  the  thera-
pist and circumstances. While patients mainly fear being 
confronted with triggering stimuli during ERP [12], there 
are  multiple  treatment  barriers  on  the  therapists  side, 
which  impede  the  application  of  ERP.  First,  conducting 
ERP  requires  additional  time  (e.g.,  travelling  to  patients’ 
home), and therapists dread cancelled appointments [12] 
or  terminated  therapy  [16–18].  Second,  negative  beliefs 
about  ERP  (e.g.,  harming  the  patient  [19–23])  may  dis-
courage  the  therapist  to  conduct  ERP.  This  dynamic 
often  promotes  hesitations  to  the  application  of  ERP  in 
the  first  place.  Lastly,  there  exist  other  barriers  such  as 
the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  encourages  social  dis-
tance  and  hygiene,  and  thereby  discourages  ERP  due  to 
a  possible  risk  of  infection  [24].  Guideline-based  treat-
ment  therefore  is  often  not  or  inadequately  applied  [15] 
and there is room for improvement. In order to increase 
the  (correct)  implementation  of  ERP  and  its  initiation, 
we need to address the obstacles associated with its use. 
One  option  to  increase  the  acceptance  and  feasibility  of 
ERP may be the use of technical supported ERP. Here, the 
structure,  mechanisms  of  ERP  and  potentially  the  high 
effects may be maintained.

Technical supported exposure response prevention 
therapy

Technical supported therapy can be used to facilitate the 
application of ERP as it can address major treatment bar-
riers of ERP in vivo: acceptability of treatment [25], a high 
variety  of  stimuli  as  well  as  improved  control  over  the 
stimuli.  Most  studies  have  been  conducted  with  virtual 
reality  (VR)  for  anxiety  disorders  (for  an  overview,  see 
Carl et al. [26]), for example, specific phobias [26, 27].

Exposure therapy in virtual reality

Through VR glasses, the individual enters a virtual envi-
ronment.  In  exposure  therapy  in  VR  (VRET)  the  indi-
vidual  is  confronted  with  virtual  three-dimensional 
presentations  of  triggering  stimuli.  This  approach  has 
been  extensively  studied  in  anxiety  disorders,  with  at 
least similar positive effects when compared to exposure 
therapy  in  vivo.  One  meta  analysis  even  found  a  small 
effect for VRET over in vivo (Cohen’s d = .35; [28]). Other 
meta  analyses  found  similar  effects  [25,  26,  29,  30]  for 
most anxiety disorders except for social anxiety disorder. 
Moreover, an early study [31] using VR for exposure ther-
apy found that anxiety – measured with subjective units 
of distress (SUD) – followed the same curve of increase 
and decrease, such as in a study with fear of flying [32], 
but the overall anxiety level was less intense in VR. Fur-
ther, emotions like anger and disgust – measured before 
and  after  the  intervention  –  elicited  by  in  virtuo  and  in 
vivo  conditions,  were  not  significantly  different  [33]. 
While the induction of fear seems similar, previous stud-
ies suggest that VRET is generally more accepted in anxi-
ety disorders in contrast to exposure therapy in vivo [34, 
35], whether this is also true for patients with OCD is still 
unclear.

Exposure and response prevention therapy in virtual 
reality for obsessive-compulsive disorder

In  OCD,  research  on  the  use  of  VR  for  ERP  (VERP)  is 
comparatively scarce, potentially due to its heterogeneity 
of  symptoms  (e.g.,  checking-,  contamination-  or  sexual 
obsessions).  A  systematic  review  and  recent  meta-anal-
ysis  on  symptom  and  emotional  response  provocation 
using  multiple  kinds  of  VR-technology,  mostly  outside 
the  context  of  ERP,  however,  supports  that  VR  environ-
ments are generally able to provoke obsessive compulsive 
(OC) symptoms such as anxiety, disgust and the urge to 
wash in individuals with OCD compared to healthy con-
trols  [36],  which  argues  for  the  feasibility  of  VERP.  This 
is supported by findings from Miegel, Bücker et al. [37], 
who  demonstrated  that  arousal  due  to  disgust  (mea-
sured with SUD) can be induced in VERP in patients with 
contamination-related  OCD.  So  far,  research  on  VERP 
for  patients  with  OCD  focused  on  investigating  feasi-
bility,  evoking  fear  of  contamination  [38]  and  observing 

Lohse et al. BMC Psychology          (2023) 11:113 Page 3 of 13

checking behavior [39–42]. Preliminary findings of VERP 
suggest  feasibility  [43,  44]  and  potential  treatment  effi-
cacy  [45],  [38]  and  [37].  One  recent  study  [46]  investi-
gated  VRET  in  patients  with  contamination  anxiety  in 
an  RCT  comparing  VRET  to  ERP  in  vivo  with  each  12 
sessions and found a large effect in the reduction of OC 
2 = .82). As findings stem from small or/and 
symptoms (ηp
non-clinical samples, they need to be replicated in a rep-
resentative randomized controlled trial (RCT). Moreover, 
Miegel, Bücker et al. [37] reported that sense of presence, 
which  represents  how  present  a  person  feels  in  a  digital 
augmented environment, was only moderate in their VR 
environment,  which  was  potentially  due  to  unrealistic 
movement (a controller was used for teleportation).

Exposure and response prevention therapy in augmented 
reality

Augmented  reality  (AR)  glasses  (e.g.,  Magic  Leap  2) 
are  much  smaller  and  lighter  compared  to  VR  glasses. 
While  looking  through  the  glasses,  individuals  see  their 
entire surrounding plus additional virtual objects that are 
projected  into  the  real  world.  In  AR,  digital  objects  are 
anchored in the physical world, meaning, the digital and 
the  real  world  are  blended.  In  other  words,  the  objects 
are “locked” in space as if they were a natural part of the 
real environment. Thus, the whole experience in AR may 
seem  more  real  and  the  individual  experiences  a  higher 
sense  of  presence,  compared  to  VR.  Also,  patients  can 
still see the therapist during ERP in AR, which might pro-
mote  equally  strong  therapeutic  relationships  compared 
to  ERP  in  vivo  predicting  a  more  favorable  treatment 
outcome  [47]  and  adherence  [48].  AR  has  already  been 
successfully  integrated  into  medical  training  [49]  and 
surgery simulation [50] and can be further used to guide 
implant placement in surgery [51].

By using AR instead of VR, realism and sense of pres-
ence could be enhanced. Realism describes the construc-
tive process behind the creation of a person’s own current 
reality,  which  is  a  crucial  element  of  sense  of  presence. 
In  AR,  sense  of  presence  might  be  improved  since  the 
individual  moves  naturally  instead  of  using  a  control-
ler.  As  sense  of  presence  determines  how  real  a  person 
feels in the virtual world, it may impact whether anxiety 
and  disgust  can  be  induced  at  a  personal  level  and  fur-
ther determine the therapy outcome. Anxiety was able to 
be  induced  in  AR  in  healthy  individuals  measured  with 
self-reported  and  physiological  parameter  [52],  though 
less  studies  are  present  for  OCD.  A  recent  study  found 
that disgust can be induced in patients with OCD in AR 
and  levels  of  sense  of  presence  were  positively  related 
with higher level of anxiety [53]. The idea is based on the 
notion that anxiety and disgust needs to be inducible, as 
ERP is based on learning adaptive behaviour in response 

to  triggering  stimuli  including  the  corresponding  emo-
tional response.

Exposure and response prevention therapy in mixed reality

Mixed reality (MR) describes the spectrum of augmented 
reality  and  virtual  experiences  and  is  commonly  used 
in  interaction  with  devices  such  as  the  HoloLens  or  the 
Magic  Leap.  It  allows  the  user  to  interact  with  real  and 
virtual objects, while seeing their own body as well as the 
real  surrounding  at  the  same  time.  MR  glasses  use  real 
time spatial mapping for merging real environments with 
digital  objects  and  interaction  with  virtual  objects  with-
out [54] and with a controller, though the stability of this 
tool without the controller is not yet established.

According to Hu et al. [55], MR has already been suc-
cessfully  integrated  into  the  medical  field  (e.g.,  risk-free 
surgery  training  [56]  and  preoperative  communication 
[57]). ERP in MR (MERP) might be especially relevant for 
the  treatment  of  psychological  disorders  such  as  OCD, 
with  its  heterogeneous  symptomatology.  In  MR,  objects 
can  be  easily  tailored  to  patients.  The  only  preliminary 
evidence  of  acceptance  of  MR  stems  from  research  on 
technology  acceptance  of  MR  in  museums  [58],  which 
notes that the technology is easy to use and highly engag-
ing.  According  to  our  current  knowledge,  to  date  there 
is just our pilot study that investigates the feasibility and 
safety of applying MERP within a clinical sample [1]. 

In this study, we included a sample of N = 20 inpatients 
with  contamination-related  OCD  [1].  During  the  inter-
vention,  all  patients  received  standard  care  on  the  psy-
chiatric ward and were randomly assigned to an add-on 
intervention  (MERP + standard  care)  or  control  group 
(standard  care  only).  Over  the  intervention  period  of 
three  weeks,  the  intervention  group  received  six  ses-
sions,  including  four  sessions  of  MERP.  For  a  detailed 
description, see Sect. 2.7.1. The pilot study [1] focused on 
safety and feasibility, thus was not powered and designed 
to  investigate  efficacy  (small  sample  size  and  add-on 
design). Overall, the pilot study demonstrated safety and 
feasibility  of  MERP  with  no  significant  symptom  dete-
rioration  in  the  intervention  group.  However,  results  on 
sense of presence and acceptance were mixed indicating 
that  technical  improvements  were  necessary.  Improve-
ment in the quality of the 3D graphics and the possibility 
of interaction in digital augmented realities are regarded 
as  crucial  for  implementing  a  high  sense  of  presence. 
We  performed  the  necessary  technical  adjustments  also 
incorporating the feedback of the therapists to investigate 
not only acceptance and feasibility but also the efficacy in 
the  present  RCT.  Based  on  patients’  feedback,  technical 
improvements  were  implemented  and  the  list  of  virtual 
contamination-related  objects  has  been  extended  (e.g., 
spray  bottle,  glass  splinter).  The  planned  RCT  will  be 

Lohse et al. BMC Psychology          (2023) 11:113 conducted  with  outpatients  in  order  to  be  able  to  draw 
more robust conclusions.

The  aim  of  the  planned  RCT  is  to  test  the  efficacy  of 
MERP  in  comparison  to  an  active  control  group  with 
regard  to  OCD  symptomatology  (Yale-Brown  Obses-
sive  Compulsive  Scale  [Y-BOCS;  [59]),  expectations  of 
treatment success (expectations of the process and effec-
tiveness of MERP) and acceptance of treatment (subjec-
tive  appraisal  rating),  and  feasibility  (Temple  Presence 
Questionnaire;  TPI;  [60])  of  the  revised  MERP  inter-
vention.  We  hypothesize  a  larger  reduction  in  both  the 
primary  outcome  (OC  symptom  reduction  according 
to  the  Y-BOCS)  and  secondary  outcomes  followed  by 
high  positive  expectation  ratings  (> 75%)  in  both  groups 
and  subjective  appraisal  ratings  (> 75%)  in  favor  of  the 
experimental group (MERP), in comparison to the active 
control  group  (self-guided  application  of  ERP).  Fur-
ther,  we  postulate  a  larger  decrease  in  depression  (Beck 
Depression  Inventory;  BDI-II  [61]),  anxiety  (General-
ized  Anxiety  Disorder  Scale-7;  GAD-7  [62]),  unwilling-
ness to remain in contact with distressing emotions (Brief 
Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire; BEAQ [63]), state 
anxiety  and  distress  (measured  during  MERP:  distress 
ratings  of  the  patient  with  Subjective  Units  of  Distress; 
SUD; [64] and physiopsychological parameter: heart rate 
[puls],  gaze  fixation  [eye-tracking]  and  skin  conductiv-
ity  [galvanic  skin  response]).  Additionally,  we  expect 
symptom  improvement  from  session  one  to  session  six 
in  a  variety  of  questions  concerning  multiple  state  sen-
sitive  dimensions  of  mental  health  (insession  question-
naire, see supplementary material C). Further, we expect 
larger  improvement  in  quality  of  life  (WHOQoL-BREF 
global item) compared to the control group. To test these 
hypotheses, we plan to conduct an RCT with two parallel 
groups,  both  receiving  active  treatment  (MERP  or  self-
guided exposure).

Methods
Design

The  present  RCT  will  be  assessor-blinded  with  parallel 
assignment  to  the  MERP  group  and  the  active  control 
group  (self-guided  exposure  therapy,  see  German  Reg-
istry  for  Clinical  Studies  [DRKS00020969]).  The  study 
includes a baseline and post assessment that takes place 
in  person,  a  follow-up  assessment  by  phone  and  an 
additional  online  survey,  which  participants  complete 
at  home  before  each  in-person  assessment  and  the  tele-
phone  interview  at  follow-up.  Participants  will  be  ran-
domized  immediately  after  the  baseline  assessment.  We 
offer  a  compensation  of  50  Euros  (total)  for  participita-
tion in all three assessments. For an overview, see Table 1.

Sample size

No evidence is available for effects of MERP in contrast 
to an active control group without therapeutic guidance. 
Thus, we could only calculate sample size approximately. 
We expect a large effect based on a meta-analysis investi-
gating VRET in anxiety disorders, which found a medium 
to large effect of VRET compared to an active psycholog-
ical  control  condition  (Hedges  g = 0.80;  [26]).  We  expect 
the effect of MERP to be even higher than in VERP since 
our  technique  is  more  advanced  and  may  induce  higher 
sense  of  presence,  which  may  have  a  positive  effect  on 
mechanisms like arousal induction [36, 65, 66].

The  power  analysis  (calculated  with  G*power;  [67]) 
determined  a  sample  size  of  64  participants  to  detect  a 
large effect (f = 0.4, α = .05, power of .80).

Recruitment

Participants  will  be  recruited  using  contact  forms  from 
previous  studies  of  our  working  group  and  through 
advertisement  (e.g.,  newspaper  articles,  OCD  support 
groups; leaflets; network of therapists; Google AdWords; 
Facebook  and  Instagram).  A  landing  page  (www.uke.de/
zwang_mr) and a flyer will be used for recruitment.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We  will  recruit  outpatients  with  OCD.  The  diagnosis  of 
OCD  will  be  confirmed  by  the  Mini-International  Neu-
ropsychiatric Interview 7.0.2 (M.I.N.I.: [68]; German ver-
sion: [69]), that is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (5th  ed.;  DSM-5)  and  the 
content of OCD (contamination-relation) will be assessed 
by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale; Y-BOCS 
[59, 70]. Further psychiatric diagnoses for in- and exclu-
sion  criteria  will  be  verified  with  the  M.I.N.I.  interview. 
Participants have to fulfill the following criteria:

Inclusion criteria

  •

the presence of contamination-related obsessions 
and compulsions

  • provision of informed consent
  • age between 18 and 80 years
sufficient command of the German language
  •
  • willingness to participate in MERP or self-guided 

exposure for six weeks

Exclusion criteria

  • a past or present diagnosis of schizophrenia or 

bipolar disorder

  • a present severe substance use disorder
  • acute suicidality
  • a severe neurological disorder associated with OCD
  • current inpatient treatment (including day care 

treatment)

Randomization and assessor blindness

The randomization will be administered by the principal 
investigator  by  using  an  online  randomization  software 
(https://miniwebtool.com/de/number-randomizer/).  The 
participants  will  be  randomized  either  to  MERP  or  the 
self-guided exposure therapy. When a participant enters 
the  study,  she/he  will  receive  the  consecutive  identifica-
tion  number.  The  participant  will  be  randomized  after 
baseline  assessment.  All  assessors  are  blinded  and  will 
not  be  informed  about  group  allocation.  Unplanned 
unblinding will be documented.

Procedure

Patients  eligibility  will  be  checked  within  a  telephone 
interview. Eligible patients will be invited for the baseline 
in-person  interview.  The  participants  receive  detailed 
information  about  the  study  and  informed  consent  will 
be provided by the interviewer. The online survey will be 
provided  before  each  interview.  Demographic  informa-
tion,  psychiatric  diagnoses  (M.I.N.I.)  and  OC  symptoms 
(Y-BOCS)  will  be  assessed  in-person.  After  the  base-
line interview (t0), participants will receive an envelope, 

which  includes  information  about  the  group  allocation. 
During the following six weeks, participants will receive 
MERP  once  a  week  or  conduct  self-guided  ERP  based 
on  a  manual  they  receive  shortly  after  the  interview  by 
the  principal  investigator.  Patients  will  be  asked  to  send 
back  the  manual  to  the  office  before  the  post  assess-
ment,  which  will  maintain  the  allocation  blinding  of 
the  interviewer.  Both  groups  will  attend  the  in-person 
post  assessment  after  six  weeks  (post  assessment;  t1) 
and  a  telephone  interview  three  months  (follow-up;  t2) 
after  the  post  assessment,  whereby  the  Y-BOCS  will  be 
administered again. Before, during and after each session 
(MERP  or  self-guided  exposure),  multiple  parameters 
(e.g.,  physiopsychological  parameter  [only  in  MERP], 
state  sensitive  questions  [see  supplementary  material  C] 
and SUD) will be assessed.

Intervention
Exposure and response prevention therapy in mixed reality

Well-trained  and  supervised  psychotherapists  in  post 
graduate  training  (master´s  degree  in  psychology)  will 
conduct the MERP. Each session will last between 60 and

and after the exposure whether it occurred (i.e., expecta-
tion violation). Each session is closed with a positive note 
and motivation for self-reward.

therapy  with 

Technical  application  of  exposure 
response prevention in mixed reality
The  MERP  is  conducted  with  mixed  reality  glasses 
(brand: MagicLeap1), which projects virtual objects into 
the  reality  –  thus  –  extends  the  reality.  The  software  is 
based  on  Game  Engine  Unity  (2020.3.22f1).  Before  the 
session,  the  therapist  can  select  objects  (see  Figs.  1  and 
2;  therapist  mode)  and  place  them  into  the  room  using 
a  controller.  Then,  the  mode  will  be  switched  into  the 
patient  mode  and  the  objects  are  locked  in  space.  The 
controller can be used by the patients to interact with the 
objects. Through the tablet, an artificial virus scan can be 
administered (green spots mark objects or places of high 
contamination) and coughing in three levels of intensity 
can  be  switched  on  and  off.  When  the  patient  touches 
objects which are recognizable contaminated (e.g., green 
spots represent a virus), the particles spread towards the 
patient’s  hands.  Physiopsychometric  parameters  such  as 
gaze fixation (eye-tracking) will be assessed with the MR-
glasses  and  electrodermal  skin  conductivity  (galvanic 
skin  response)  will  be  assessed  with  a  moodmetric  ring 
during MERP.

Self-guided exposure and response prevention therapy

The  control  group  will  conduct  self-guided  ERP  accord-
ing  to  a  manual,  which  is  based  on  the  same  structure 
as  the  therapists’  MERP  manual.  The  manual  is  divided 
into  six  exercises  –  one  exercise  for  each  week.  A  plane 
list  provides  the  option  to  note  the  selected  objects  and 
rate them in terms of expected level of distress on a scale 
from  (0)  no  distress  to  (100)  extreme  distress  for  each 
exercise. A participant will first reflect their medical his-
tory, obsessions and compulsions (comparable to session 
1 of MERP) before receiving psychoeducation in the next 
exercise (comparable to session 2 of MERP). During the 
second  exercise,  the  participants  are  asked  to  plan  their 
first  exposure  for  the  next  exercise  (comparable  to  ses-
sion  2  of  MERP).  The  participant  will  choose,  plan  and 
document  their  exposure  with  the  manual  (comparable 
to sessions 3 to 6 of MERP). The level of difficulty is sup-
posed to increase from one exposure to the next one.

Measures

Primary measure and secondary measures
Yale-brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS)

The Y-BOCS (English version [70]; German version [71]) 
is  a  semi-structured  interview  used  to  assess  OC  symp-
tom  severity.  The  Y-BOCS  consists  of  two  parts:  (1)  a

Fig. 2  Virtual objects on the floor.

90 min. The medical history is taken in the first session. 
During the second session, psychoeducation will be con-
veyed and a detailed preparation for MERP will be con-
ducted.  Part  of  the  preparation  is  to  rate  the  difficulty 
and associated distress of the objects that are available in 
the MR. The rating will be used for the next MERP and 
guides the choice of objects (supplementary material D). 
The MERP will start in session three with a medium diffi-
cult exposure, which will increase in the level of difficulty 
during the following sessions.

Before, every three minutes during and after the expo-
sure,  the  level  of  distress  (SUD)  will  be  rated  and  saved 
on  a  tablet  by  the  therapist.  Before  and  after  each  ses-
sion, the state sensitive questionnaire will be filled out by 
the  participant.  Additionally,  participants  will  be  asked

symptom  checklist  to  identify  current  as  well  as  former 
OCD  contents,  and  (2)  structured  questions  designed 
to  determine  symptom  severity.  Each  item  can  be  rated 
on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from (0) no symptoms 
to (4) severe symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 
40. Ranges of severity are: 0–7 (subclinical), 8–15 (mild), 
16–23 (moderate), 24–31 (severe), 32–40 (extreme). The 
good psychometric properties of the scale have been ver-
ified  for  the  German  version  (high  interrater  reliability 
between  r = .74  –  r = .97)  and  good  internal  consistency 
(Cronbach´s α = 0.80;[72]).

Secondary outcome measures
Obsessive compulsive inventory (OCI-R)

The  OCI-R  (English  version  [73];  German  version  [74]) 
measures the severity of OC symptoms overall and in six 
dimensions:  checking,  contamination,  ordering,  hoard-
ing,  obsessing,  and  neutralizing  [75]  with  18  items  on 
a  5-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  (0)  not  at  all  to  (4) 
extremely strong. The possible range of scores is between 
0  and  72  with  a  cut-off  score  of  21  indicating  the  likely 
presence  of  OCD. The  original  scale  as  well  as  the  Ger-
man version (used in the present study) have shown good 
to  excellent  psychometric  properties  (German  scale: 
excellent  internal  consistency  [except  for  neutralizing], 
good  convergent  and  divergent  validity  [74];  English 
scale:  high  internal  consistency  [except  for  neutralizing] 
and moderate to high test-retest-reliability [75]) also in a 
clinical sample [76].

Expectations

Expectations about the application and treatment success 
of MERP will be assessed with an adapted and extended 
version  of  the  Attitudes  Towards  Psychological  Online 
Interventions  Questionnaire  [77]  and  the  Milwaukee 
Questionnaire  [78]  (see  supplementary  material  A)  with 
a  total  score  between  0  and  64.  Expectations  of  MERP 
will be rated by both groups before and after (concerning 
another  MERP)  their  intervention.  The  scale  consists  of 
16  items  (e.g.,  “I  believe  that  MERP  is  helpful  for  wash-
ing  obsessions”)  rated  on  a  Likert  scale  ranging  from  (0) 
completely agree to (4) completely disagree and one open 
question (“What do you expect from MERP?”).

Temple presence inventory (TPI)

The  TPI  [60]  consists  of  42  items  in  its  original  version 
and  measures  sense  of  presence  based  on  eight  dimen-
sions of telepresence. The scale has also been used in the 
pilot  study  and  was  previously  adapted  to  match  MERP 
(e.g.,  one  item  of  the  perceptual  realism  subscale  was 
omitted because it did not fit to the present study). Thus, 
it consists of three scales, which assess sense of presence: 
perceptual  realism,  engagement,  and  spatial  presence 
with 15 items and is rated on an 8-point Likert scale with 

higher  values  indicating  a  higher  sense  of  presence. The 
internal  consistency  of  the  scale  has  shown  to  be  good 
[60].

Subjective appraisal rating

The  subjective  appraisal  of  MERP  and  the  self-guided 
exposure  therapy  will  be  assessed  with  a  questionnaire 
based on the scale used by Miegel, Bücker et al. [37], the 
APOI  [77]),  and  the  Technology  Usage  Inventory  (TUI; 
[79];  supplementary  material  B)  –  that  will  be  rated  on 
a  5-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  (1)  completely  agree 
to (5) completely disagree. An example of an item of the 
subjective  appraisal  is  “I  would  prefer  MERP  over  expo-
sure in vivo“ and an example of an item of the subjective 
appraisal  of  self-guided  exposure  is  „During  the  self-
guided exposure I missed the therapeutic support”.

Subjective units of distress questionnaire (SUD)

The  SUD  [64]  will  be  used  to  assess  distress  during  the 
ERP  sessions.  The  therapists  will  ask  the  patient  every 
three minutes about their current state of distress using 
a scale ranging from (0) no distress to (100) extreme dis-
tress. Higher scores indicate higher distress.

Brief experiential avoidance questionnaire (BEAQ)

The  BEAQ  [63]  assesses  experiential  avoidance,  which 
describes  the  unwillingness  to  remain  in  contact  with 
distressing  emotions. The  scale  consists  of  15  items  and 
is  rated  on  a  6-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  (1)  com-
pletely agree to (6) completely disagree. The total score is 
between  15  and  90.  A  higher  score  indicates  high  expe-
riential avoidance. The BEAQ showed good internal reli-
ability (Cronbach´s α between .8 [clinical sample] and .81 
[student  sample]).  It  has  acceptable  to  good  test-retest 
=
reliability  between  r 
 .86 
[student sample] according to Schaeuffele et al.[63].

Quality of life (global item of the quality of life-abbreviated 
version)

The  Quality  of  Life  –  abbreviated  version  (WHOQOL-
BREF) assesses quality of life [80] and is a short version 
of  the  WHOQOL-100,  with  26  items.  Only  the  global 
item will be used in the planned RCT, which concerns the 
general quality of life “How would you rate your quality of 
life?”. The question will be rated on a 5-point Likert scale 
ranging from (1) very bad to (5) very good. A high score 
indicates a high quality of life.

Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II)

The BDI-II [81] was conducted in its German version [82] 
and  assesses  symptom  severity  of  depression  (i.e.,  affec-
tive, cognitive, motivational, vegetative, and psychomotor 
components). The  self-report  scale  is  based  on  DSM-IV 
criteria [83] and contains 21-items, which are rated on a 

Lohse et al. BMC Psychology          (2023) 11:113 4-point Likert scale with differently marked anchors. The 
total  score  ranges  from  0  to  63.  The  total  scores  can  be 
interpreted  as  no  depressive  symptoms  (0–8),  minimal 
depressive  symptoms  (9–13),  light  depressive  symptoms 
(14–19),  medium  severe  depressive  symptoms  (20–28), 
and  severe  depressive  symptoms  (29–63).  The  German 
version  has  shown  a  good  internal  consistency  (Cron-
bach’s  α ≥ 0.84),  and  good  test-retest  reliability,  which 
exceeded r ≥ .75 in nonclinical samples [82].

Generalized anxiety disorder scale − 7 (GAD-7)

The  GAD-7  [62]  is  a  self-report  questionnaire,  which 
assesses generalized anxiety. It consists of 7 items, which 
are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from (0) not at 
all to (3) nearly every day. The possible range of scores is 
between 0 and 21. Scores indicate mild (5), moderate (10) 
and  severe  (15)  anxiety.  The  scale  has  good  reliability, 
as  well  as  criterion,  construct,  factorial,  and  procedural 
validity [62].

State sensitive insession questionnaire

The  state  sensitive  insession  questionnaire  (supplemen-
tary material C) assesses how the person feels during the 
present moment with 20 items on a 5-point Likert scale 
from (1) completely agree, (2) agree, (3) not sure, (4) dis-
agree  to  (5)  completely  disagree.  The  first  five  items  are 
similar to the one used in Miegel et al. [98]. Item 1 and 2 
concern meta-cognitive beliefs (e.g., “It is important that 
I monitor my thoughts”). Item 3 to 6 directly assess OC-
specific  states  (e.g.,  “I  have  obsessions  right  now”).  Item 
7  to  12  ask  for  the  emotional  state  (e.g.,  “I  am  angry”). 
Item 13 and 14 assess resistance against obsessions. Item 
15  to  16  assess  disgust.  Item  17  to  18  ask  about  dizzi-
ness  and  malaise.  Item  19  to  20  assess  self-competence 
(e.g., “I am convinced that I cannot face by obsessions and 
compulsions”).

Further assessments during MERP

During  MERP  physiopsychological  parameter  such  as 
gaze  fixation  [eye-tracking]  and  skin  conductivity  [gal-
vanic  skin  response]  will  be  assessed.  Skin  conductivity 
will  be  assessed  with  a  mood  ring  [84],  while  gaze  fixa-
tion  will  be  assessed  with  the  MR-glasses.  Violation  of 
expectancy will be assessed by different questions before 
(e.g.,  “How  likely  do  you  think  it  is  that  your  worst  fear 
actually  comes  true?”)  and  after  (e.g.,  “How  much  did 
your worst fear come true?”) each MERP. 

Statistical analyzes

To  evaluate  the  change  in  OC  and  comorbid  symptoms 
between  MERP  and  self-guided  exposure,  analyses  of 
covariance (ANCOVA) are planned with treatment as the 
between-subject  factor  (MERP  vs.  self-guided  exposure 
therapy), the difference in the scores of the outcomes (t0 

Page 8 of 13

–  t1  and  t0  –  t2,  respectively)  as  the  dependent  variable, 
and  the  baseline  score  of  each  outcome  as  the  covariate. 
Paired  t-test  will  be  applied  for  within  group  differences 
from  baseline  to  post  and  from  baseline  to  follow-up 
assessment.  First,  analyzes  will  be  conducted  with  the 
complete cases sample (complete participation at t0, t1and 
t2) and an intention-to-treat analysis will follow (ITT).

Acceptability  of  MERP  will  be  displayed  descriptively 
by means and standard deviations. Graphs will show fre-
quencies  of  approval  or  rejection  of  all  items.  To  assess 
safety  of  MERP  the  Reliable  Change  Index  (RCI)  [85] 
for  the  change  in  the  Y-BOCS  total  score  from  baseline 
to post assessment for each patient will be calculated to 
assess  meaningful  clinical  decline.  An  RCI  above  1.96 
(i.e.,  ~ 5%  level)  is  regarded  as  significant.  The  change 
of  expectation  of  MERP  at  t0  (before  randomization) 
to  t1  will  be  analzsed  with  ANCOVAs.  Differences  in 
the  scores  of  expectation  (t0  –  t1)  will  be  chosen  as  the 
dependent  variable,  and  the  baseline  score  of  treatment 
expectation  as  the  covariate.  Within  group  differences 
will  be  assessed  with  paired  t-test  from  baseline  to  post 
assessment.

As 

insession  variables,  expectancy  violation  and 
habituation  (within-  and  between  sessions)  will  be  ana-
lyzed. Items of the state sensitive insession questionnaire 
will be analyzed by linear mixed effect models similar to 
previous studies [86].

Pearson’s correlation will be calculated for the relation-
ship between sense of presence and OC symptom reduc-
tion (Y-BOCS). Further sense of presence, expectation of 
MERP and acceptance will be displayed graphically.

Effect  sizes  will  be  described  by  Cohen’s  d  (d ≈ 0.50 
small  effect,  d ≈ 0.80  medium  effect,  d > 0.80  large  effect; 
2 ≈ 0.01  small  effect, 
98)  as  well  as  partial  eta  square  (ηp
ηp

2 ≈ 0.06 medium effect, ηp

2 ≈ 0.14 large effect).

Ethical standards

The RCT will be conducted in compliance with the Dec-
laration  of  Helsinki  and  is  approved  by  the  local  ethics 
committee of the center for psychosocial medicine of the 
University  Medical  Center  Hamburg-Eppendorf,  Ger-
many (local psychological ethic committee at the center 
for  psychosocial  medicine  [LPEK-0216]).  The  authors 
declare  that  all  procedures  contributing  to  this  study 
comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national 
and institutional committees on human experimentation 
and  with  the  Helsinki  Declaration  of  1975,  as  revised  in 
2008. Furthermore, the authors assert that all procedures 
contributing  to  this  work  comply  with  the  ethical  stan-
dards  of  the  relevant  institutional  and  national  guides 
on  the  care  and  use  of  laboratory  animals.  Unexpected 
adverse  events  will  be  documented.  The  anonymous 
data will be stored for 10 years, will be used for research 
only and will be deleted in the case of revocation of the

declaration  of  consent.  Protocol  amendments  will  be 
communicated  with  study  principal,  ethic  committee 
and the Hamburgische Investitions- und Förderbank and 
adjusted in the trial registration.

Discussion
This  is  the  first  larger  study,  which  investigates  efficacy, 
acceptability, expectations and feasibility of MERP. Posi-
tive findings will support the use of MERP as an alterna-
tive treatment or supplement to ERP in vivo for patients 
with OCD and may stimulate further research with larger 
RCTs.

More  effective  treatment  options  for  OCD  are  still 
needed, since drop out rates for ERP in vivo are high [16–
18] and barriers from the side of the patients, the thera-
pists  [12,  87]  and  circumstances  [24]  are  still  present. 
Therapists  may  be  encouraged  to  broaden  their  reper-
toire of application, benefit from local administration in 
their own office and apply MERP to patients, who are too 
afraid of confrontation in vivo, since the confrontation is 
“only”  in  MR  and  may  therefore  appear  less  aversive  in 
the first place. MERP does not aim to replace ERP in vivo, 
though  may  offer  additional  insight  by  tracking  pupils 
and determining otherwise hidden avoiding behaviours.

According  to  VRET  it  can  be  assumed  that  MERP  is 
also accepted by patients with OCD [25]. Unfortunately, 
we  only  have  preliminary  evidence  for  MERP  from  the 
pilot  study  [1].  This  current  study  will  look  at  expecta-
tions of treatment success of MERP and various domains 
of  acceptance  (perceived  efficacy,  perceived  feasibility, 
perceived risk of drop out), while contrasting self-guided 
ERP in vivo.

ERP  is  an  effective  treatment  for  patients  with  OCD 
[88–92], nevertheless, working mechanisms (e.g., expec-
tancy violation and habituation; [93]) and crucial factors 
of  ERP  have  not  been  investigated  properly  in  VR  [25] 
nor  MR,  before.  Analyzing  those  factors  will  elucidate 
which ones promote efficacy of treatment and determine 
the focus of treatment improvements. Sense of presence 
is  widely  regarded  as  such  as  a  central  factor  [94],  and 
will be part of our analysis. Since research on expectancy 
violation  in  OCD  is  rare  [95,  96],  its  investigation  in  a 
controlled setting – likewise provided in MR – is advised.
Further,  we  will  investigate  the  most  common  comor-
bidities  (e.g.,  depression  and  anxiety  disorders  [97]), 
which may hinder the effectiveness of MERP. This poten-
tially  will  help  to  adjust  the  content  of  MERP  for  those 
patients  in  the  future.  Additionally,  we  will  investigate 
the  effect  of  MERP  on  central  comorbidities  and  clarify 
whether the intervention has secondary benefits.

Limitations and future studies

There are possible limitations that need to be discussed. 
First, only patients who are generally open to ERP reach 

out to this study. A clear statement whether MERP is an 
alternative  to  fearful  patients  is  not  possible,  since  the 
representativeness  of  the  sample  is  limited.  Neverthe-
less,  we  also  assess  reasons  of  patients  concerning  their 
drop-outs, which may reduce this limitation. Second, we 
will not be able to transfer findings onto other subtypes 
of  OCD  besides  contamination-related  OCD.  Though, 
future  studies  may  be  built  upon  our  findings  and  may 
extend  the  repertoire  towards  other  symptom  domains. 
Third,  patients  will  be  able  to  continue  their  outpatient 
therapy  including  ERP,  thus  symptomatic  improvement 
due  to  MERP  will  be  difficult  to  reveal.  However,  both 
groups  are  equally  allowed  to  continue  their  treatment 
and its type and amount will be assessed and considered 
in the analyzes.

One  strength  of  our  study  is  that  both  groups  receive 
active treatment, which includes exposure. Therefore, the 
mode of application will determine the efficacy. Further-
more,  our  study  facilitates  a  close  investigation  of  effi-
cacy,  acceptability,  expectations  of  MERP  and  emotion 
induction of MERP. In contrast to VR, the application of 
MR is rather intuitive and easy to learn for therapists and 
patients. Thus, we expect that positive findings may pro-
mote actual application by therapists.

If  proven  effective  and  accepted,  this  therapy  could 
facilitate  a  more  guideline  compliant  treatment  and 
future studies should discover the application for patients 
with different obsessions (e.g., checking). In general, the 
study  facilitates  knowledge,  which  can  be  used  for  the 
improvements of the intervention. Multiple variables will 
be  assessed,  which  may  explain  smaller  than  expected 
effects, and direct future research.

Trial status

The  first  participant  was  enrolled  in  March  2022.  At 
present,  30  participants  attended  their  baseline  assess-
ment.  At  the  time  of  submission  of  this  study  protocol, 
participants  were  still  being  recruited,  and  no  data  had 
been  extracted  and  analyzed  yet.  All  future  changes  to 
the  study  protocol  will  be  recorded  in  an  independent 
amendment.  SPIRIT  guidelines  were  followed  for  the 
whole article.

Timetable and research plan

The  present  study  will  be  carried  out  in  2022  and  2023. 
Recently, the pilot study ended and findings were used to 
optimize the software and study setup of this larger study. 
The recruitment has already started, and 30 participants 
have  been  randomized.  The  recruitment  and  treatment 
will  continue  till  the  end  of  2023.  This  study  protocol 
was started in June 2022 and will be handed in till spring 
2023.  During  the  second  half  of  2023  the  follow-up 
assessment  will  be  carried  out.  Thereafter,  data  will  be 
prepared  and  analyzed  for  two  additional  publications 

Lohse et al. BMC Psychology          (2023) 11:113 in  international  journals.  Personnel  resources  were  very 
high at the beginning of the study, thus the study proto-
col was submitted later.

Conclusion
This study protocol facilitates study replication for future 
studies. Since this study is the first of its kind – including 
a large sample – it will direct future research. If this study 
can  demonstrate  that  MERP  is  effective,  well  accepted 
with  positive  expectations  of  MERP  and  able  to  induce 
negative emotions, larger RCTs are needed. Through this 
study,  we  will  learn  about  which  factors  are  crucial  for 
treatment  efficacy  and  need  to  be  considered  in  future 
research.
