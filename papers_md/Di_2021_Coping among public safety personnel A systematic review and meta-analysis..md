Abstract

Public safety personnel (PSP) are routinely exposed to potentially psychologically

traumatic events (PPTEs) that, in turn, can result in posttraumatic stress injuries

(PTSI),

including burnout and increased symptoms of depression and anxiety.

However, the longitudinal impact of PPTEs on PSP coping remains unclear. Coping

can be operationalized as various strategies (i.e., behaviours, skills, thought and

emotion regulation) for dealing with stressors, which are broadly categorized as

either approach (adaptive, positive, social support) or avoidant coping strategies

(maladaptive withdrawal, avoidance, substance use). This systematic review and

meta‐analysis aims to evaluate longitudinal coping outcomes among PSP. Thirteen

eligible repeated‐measures studies explicitly evaluated coping in 1854 police offi-

cers, firefighters, and rescue and recovery workers. Study designs included

randomized‐control trials, within‐subject interventions and observational studies.

Effect sizes (Cohen's d) at follow‐up were described in 11 studies. Separate meta‐

analyses reveal small (d < 0.2) but non‐significant improvements in approach and

avoidant coping. Studies were of moderate quality and low risk of publication bias.

Heterogeneity in outcome measures, follow‐up durations, and study types pre-

cluded subgroup analyses. The current findings can inform the development and

evaluation of organizational training programs that effectively promote sustained

adaptive coping for PSP and mitigate PTSIs.

McCreary, 2019), including online resilience training modules that

have low adherence rates (Joyce et al., 2018, 2019). These findings

are also apparent in trainee paramedics (Anderson et al., 2017;

Vaughan et al., 2020) and nurses (Anderson, Black, Collins &

Vaughan, 2019). Also, coping skills obtained through resilience

training can be expected to deteriorate like other learned skills

refresher programs are likely critical for maintaining gains. Whether

due to ineffectiveness of the interventions themselves or a lack of

consistent organizational support,

the interventions mentioned

above fail to identify effective strategies that support long‐term

coping following PPTEs, which is particularly relevant for PSP.

Given mounting evidence that stigma substantially inhibits care‐

seeking for mental health challenges in these populations (Carleton

et al., 2019a, 2019b; Ricciardelli, 2018; Ricciardelli et al., 2018),

occupational training that emphasizes adaptive coping to work‐

related exposures may be better suited for initial or basic training.

While having social supports and tolerating uncertainty are critical to

resilience and handling of stress, recent evidence suggests that these

factors are also relevant to protecting PSP from adverse psycho-

logical outcomes following PPTE (Angehrn et al., 2020; Vig

et al., 2020). However, there remains a gap in the literature

surrounding which coping methods effectively mitigate PTSIs and

Of the 13 eligible studies, three were excluded from the meta‐

analysis for failing to report the means or standard deviations for

their coping outcome measures (Craun et al., 2014; Ranta, 2009), for

measuring coping at only one time point (de Terte et al., 2014), and

for reporting only a global composite coping score (i.e., no separation

of approach and avoidant subscales; Ranta, 2009). Requests for

missing data were unanswered at the time of submitting the current

review. Ultimately, ten studies were included in a quantitative meta‐

analysis.

4.2 | Meta‐analysis of approach coping

While measures of approach coping appeared to improve at follow‐

up, the improvement was a small effect and did not reach statisti-

cal significance (d = 0.18, 95% CI [−0.05, 0.18], k = 10 studies,
I2 = 0%; Figure 2). There were no significant subgroup effects noted
by study design, PSP category, or intervention category. Meta‐

regression analyses for the impact of age, sex distribution, or time

(time‐since event, duration of treatment, time to follow up) on study

effect sizes were not significant.
