BACKGROUND: Scientific investigation and documentation of equine-assisted therapy has increased over the past several years. Yet there are 
no standardized and validated tools for evidence-based measurement of processes and outcomes to assess equine-assisted interventions.
aiM: the objective of this cross-sectional survey study was to develop a standardized assessment tool for the effective measurement of equine-
assisted therapy based on the common language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework of the 
World Health Organization (WHO).
dEsiGn: cross-sectional study.
sEttinG: six equine-assisted therapy rehabilitation centers in Germany.
population: persons with indications for equine-assisted therapy.
MEthods: in a qualitative conceptual portion of the study, four semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted and analyzed with a to-
tal of 17 experts and therapists according to the aims, content, and sphere of influence of equine-assisted therapy via structured content analysis. 
Based on these findings and a linkage to the classification system of ICF, a standardized assessment tool (a general module and three specialized 
submodules) for equine-assisted therapy was developed. It was field-tested with 116 participants at six locations in a multicenter practical field 
approach and statistically analyzed via explorative factor analyses and reliability tests.
rEsults: Explorative factor analysis provided support for a three-factor structure for the general module, including psychosocial, motor, and 
mental functioning scales. for both submodules, i.e., the individual and group settings, a two-factor structure was indicated. reliability was in 
the good to excellent range for all modules.
CONCLUSIONS: A global 80-item assessment tool, divided into a general and three submodules, provides a first step toward a standardized 
icf-based assessment of the effects of equine-assisted therapy. a common language in measuring therapy outcomes could increase synchroniza-
tion and integration of equine-assisted therapy interventions into the international healthcare system. by applying the icf in multidisciplinary 
services in rehabilitation management, improved coordination and networking of all necessary services can be provided.
clinical rEhabilitation iMpact: the developed assessment tool contributes to evidence-based outcome-measurement and therapy 
monitoring of equine-assisted interventions. prospectively, it could enable cost-effectiveness analyses and comparability with other health sys-
tem interventions.

promotion  and  maintenance  of  health  are  two  of  the 

main  goals  of  physical  and  rehabilitation  medicine. 
in  this  context,  the  relevance  of  optimal  functioning  has 
increased  in  the  past  years  due  to  functioning  being  the 
third  health  indicator  (extending  the  indicators  mortality 
and  morbidity)  used  by  the  World  Health  Organization 

(WHO)  to  monitor  countries’  health  strategies.1  further-
more, functioning was set as a key indicator for rehabili-
tation because it not only describes the health status of a 
person  and  clinical  intervention  outcomes  but  also  takes 
into account the person’s “lived health” in addition to their 
biological  health.1 The  classification  of  biological  health

via  the  International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD-10) 
was  therefore  extended  with  the  classification  of  lived 
health via the usage of the International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by the WHO.1-3 
Especially  the  use  of  the  activities  and  participation  do-
mains in the ICF completed the assessment of a persons’ 
health  state  through  a  resource-orientated  perspective  on 
human functioning.1 in the past decade, the usage of the 
ICF  to  assess  and  monitor  patients’  health  components 
in  European  health  care  systems  has  greatly  increased.4 
for  clinicians,  it  serves  as  a  holistic  framework  for  evi-
dence-based  decision-making  in  medical  rehabilitation.5 
past studies have shown improved communication across 
multi-professional  medical  disciplines  within  institutions 
via implementation of the icf in clincal practice.6-8

according to fayed, cieza, and bickenbach, the usage 
of the ICF classification as a database for inter-institution-
al or international quality assurance of interventions seems 
also promising for describing, comparing, and contrasting 
international  health-related  quantitative  data.9  since  it 
serves as a uniform and comprehensive language on hu-
man  functioning,  it  became  an  international  standard  to 
describe a person’s medical and rehabilitation status over 
the past years.5

Various studies have examined the linkage and concor-
dance of existing measurement tools to icf categories in 
global health care systems and also have developed new 
application-oriented  ICF  core  sets,  concerning  a  specific 
health  condition  or  healthcare  intervention,  in  order  to 
achieve a shift from a deficit-oriented view of the patient’s 
health status to a more resource-oriented perspective.4, 9, 10 
icf applications provide an opportunity to reduce and op-
erationalize the complexity of the icf for clinical assess-
ments and research, since the icf itself contains unwieldy 
terms that can only be synchronized in socio-medical con-
texts to a limited extent.9-11

Equine-assisted  therapy  (EAT),  in  this  context,  repre-
sents  healthcare  interventions  that  are  generally  consid-
ered  to  be  supportive  for  human  functioning  in  terms  of 
preventive  and  rehabilitative  treatment.  but  it  has  only 
been fragmentarily validated scientifically as to what exact 
health-related output is generated through Eat and how it 
feeds  into  a  medical  rehabilitation  process.  Eat  intends 
to improve patient motor functions and psychological and 
social competencies. the aims of the therapy in the reha-
bilitation process  depend  on  individual  indications  (such 
as  chronic  diseases  and  disabilities)  and  can  include  im-
provements  in  neuro-motor,  sensorimotor,  psychomotor, 
or socio-motor functioning, for example.12 the term Eat 

is used to inclusively describe horse-riding therapy and as-
sociated therapy subcategories.13 the main subcategories 
are hippotherapy for patients with physical therapy indica-
tions, horse-assisted psychotherapy for patients with trau-
ma sequelae and psychiatric indications, for example, and 
horse-assisted therapy in group and individual settings, for 
the treatment of individual mental and motor skills and, in 
the group setting, to promote psychosocial and communi-
cational skills.12

Current  findings  have  led  to  the  assumption  that  EAT 
is effective but not quantifiable due to small sample sizes, 
the  large  variation  in  survey  instruments,  targeted  out-
come measures, and a lack of standardization in study de-
signs.14-17  in  their  meta-analysis,  Winkler  and  beelmann 
suggest  Eat  is  generally  effective  but  also  stress  that 
methodologically weak research designs have significant-
ly  higher  effect  strengths  in  comparison  to  qualitatively 
better studies (N=19 screened studies).17

Present gaps in this research field include systematized 
measuring  and  documentation  of  Eat;  in  this  vein,  the 
biopsychosocial approach of the icf provides a compre-
hensive basis for the systematization of therapy intentions, 
making  them  both  assessable  and  verifiable. An  ICF  ap-
plication for the assessment of Eat could provide a valid 
basis  for  comparison  and  process  monitoring  of  therapy 
outcomes integrated into a patient’s general rehabilitation 
process. additionally, the use of function-oriented assess-
ment  tools  seems  to  be  a  suitable  approach  for  holistic-
orientated  Eat  and  its  subcategories  due  to  the  strong 
association  with  the  icf  concept  of  activity.  therefore, 
as  an  important  step  for  the  professionalization  and  evi-
dence-based foundation of Eat, the objective of this study 
was  to  apply  the  icf  to  the  development  of  a  standard-
ized assessment tool to measure and document Eat and 
its subcategories using a function-orientated perspective. 
an icf-based approach to the assessment of Eat could be 
a first step in gathering reliable scientific evidence about 
Eat  outcomes  in  the  common  international  language  of 
the Who.

Materials and methods

in a preliminary part of the study, a pilot tool was construct-
ed  based  on  four  semi-structured  focus  group  interviews 
with EAT experts and therapists (N.=17) from the follow-
ing therapy disciplines: Eat in general, Eat in group- and 
individual settings and hippotherapy (Initially, there were 
also four therapists for therapy of persons with trauma se-
quelae in a separate focus group included in the study, but

they were excluded from the present investigation due to 
the sample size difficulties caused by the current coronavi-
rus pandemic). The SPSS method (“Sammeln, Prüfen, Sor-
tieren and Subsummieren” for collect, examine, sort, sub-
sume [German acronym]) of Helfferich was used to gener-
ate  suitable  interview  questions  concerning  Eat  therapy 
aims and targets in regard to the neuro-motor, sensorimo-
tor,  psychomotor,  or  socio-motor  functioning  according 
to German guidelines for EAT objectives (Supplementary 
Digital Material 1: Supplementary Text File 1).12, 18 also, 
icf terminology was used to create a connection to inter-
national health care language. Questions for mental func-
tioning were for example “What are the goals with regard 
to the areas of ‘mental functions (cognition and emotion)’ 
in therapy?” and “What changes could be observed in the 
course of therapy with regard to these goals?” The same 
moderator conducted all focus groups. focus group inter-
views were transcribed and analyzed using content-struc-
turing  content  analysis  using  the  transcription  program 
f4.19  the  MaXQda  12  software  program  was  used  for 
computer-aided qualitative data analysis.

subsequently, a comparison of the qualitative data with 
the  ICF  classification  system  was  independently  carried 
out  by  two  assessors  in  accordance  with  the  redefined 
linking rules.5 Reliability was examined based on Cohen’s 
kappa; a κ=0.49 can be interpreted as moderate observer 
agreement.20 consensus was formed between the two as-
sessors  to  create  icf-based  items.  descriptive  analyses 
showed that 80.7% of the qualitative data could be linked 
to a certain icf level, whereas links on a fourth icf level 
have been pursued (detailed classification with definition).
the  icf  research  branch  online  platform  and  the 
“ICF  in  family-friendly  language”  by  Pretis  and  Kopp-
sixt were used to formulate the items in simple, intuitive 
language.21,  22  the  icf  research  platform  contains  item 
codes  and  descriptions  of  all  icf  levels  online.  the  use 
of these descriptions for the creation of icf-based items 
supports a consistent multi-professional understanding of 
these items for health care professionals. furthermore, the 
“ICF in family-friendly language” is a validated and easily 
comprehensible icf version developed by an international 
research group from four European countries to translate 
the rather technical language of the icf into a version suit-
able for school and/or everyday use.22 simple and concise 
icf terms have been developed systematically as part of 
a larger initiative of icf implementation strategies in Eu-
rope to provide a basis for the facilitation of practical ap-
plication of icf-based data collection in diverse settings 
over the past few years.10

in addition, existing assessment instruments such as the 
dortmund self-concept Menu with the horse,23 the dy-
namic  Gait  Index  (DGI),24  the  Gross-Motor-functioning 
Measure  (GMFS),25  and  the  German  youth  institute  in-
formal  competencies  list26  were  used  as  an  orientation 
for the development of items when qualitative data could 
not be linked to the ICF. These were relevant for specific 
psychosocial  items  in  the  general  module  and  the  group 
and individual therapy submodules that were not covered 
by  the  ICF  (for  example  item  GS13.  Shows  helpfulness, 
not defined in the ICF (Supplementary Digital Material 2: 
supplementary table i, supplementary digital Material 3: 
supplementary table  ii,  supplementary  digital  Material 
4: supplementary table iii, supplementary digital Mate-
rial 5: Supplementary Table IV).

the developed pilot tool was subsequently reduced us-
ing a two-step item reduction related to the delphi method 
(Figure  1).  For  this  purpose,  the  EAT  experts  and  thera-
pists removed 20 items from the pilot tool via two separate 
rating periods within one month. the experts deleted items 
as being not observable, not relevant, not appropriate, or 
incomprehensible. they also gave open feedback, which 
was used to modify, summarize, and reformulate items to 
ensure content validity of the developed assessment tool. 
advice was given explicitly on how to formulate the icf-
based  items  in  a  simpler  and  more  intuitive  way  so  that 
they can be clearly understood among Eat professionals 
in EAT practice. For example, item G17, “Can memorize 
processes  and  tasks  in  the  therapy  and  reproduce  them 
later” for ICF b1442, Retrieval of Memory, as therapists 
regularly ask patients in EAT practice, for example, “Can 
you  tell  me,  what  we  did  in  our  last  session?” The  core 
construct  of  EAT  aims  and  targets  (with  regard  to  the 
neuro-motor,  sensorimotor,  psychomotor,  or  socio-motor 
functions)  was  thereby  retained  as  a  result  of  the  focus

groups. a preliminary test of the assessment tool was con-
ducted using expert judgment by a therapist at one of the 
participating Eat rehabilitation centers before application 
in the practical field.

Instrument

the developed pilot tool comprised a general module with 
37  items  and  three  subscales  for  individual  (18  items), 
group therapy (16 items), and hippotherapy (25 items) to 
be modified and further reduced via statistical and content-
related procedures based on the data gained of the multi-
center practical field approach. As presented in the results, 
the final assessment tool contains a general module with 
30 items, two subscales for individual therapy (12 items), 
and  group  therapy  (13  items),  and  a  submodule  for  hip-
potherapy  with  25  items.  the  modules  cover  the  scales 
“mental functions,” “psychosocial functions,” and “motor 
functions.” A unipolar ten-step Likert scale from “does not 
apply at all” to “applies fully” was used to assess therapy 
progress  change-sensitively.  only  endpoint  categories 
were verbalized.

Study design and sample

the tool was tested in practice on a sample of 116 patients, 
who had each been assessed once by their therapists using 
Questback unipark. the online survey was conducted at 
six  locations  in  different  regions  of  Germany  (February-
June 2020). All locations used the nationwide standardized 
regulations  of  the  German  curatorship  for  therapeutic 
riding.12  in  addition,  a  medical  declaration  of  no  objec-
tion was conducted to carry out the therapy. all procedures 
performed in the study were approved by the ethics com-
mittee of the German sport university cologne and in ac-
cordance with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later 
amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from 
all subjects involved (for children additionally from par-
ents and legal guardians).

Statistical analysis

the  data  were  analyzed  using  the  statistic  software  pro-
gram IBM SPSS 26. Descriptive statistics (mean±standard 
deviation) are presented here for the total scores by ther-
apy focus and were analyzed by explorative factor analy-
ses. dimensionality, construct validity, and reliability were 
also examined. to determine construct validity, intercorre-
lations of the scales were carried out. to determine facto-
rial  validity,  explorative  factor  analyses  were  performed 
using maximum likelihood (ML) factor analysis. In order 

to determine the suitability of the data for carrying out a 
factor analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure 
of sampling adequacy coefficient was employed following 
Kaiser  and  rice.27  the  number  of  extracted  factors  was 
determined using the scree test according to cattell.28 With 
regard to dimensionality, varimax rotations were executed 
to determine factor structures of the general module and 
submodules. in order to take statistical and psychological 
meaningfulness into account when interpreting the factors, 
only factor loadings over 0.50 were interpreted.29, 30 cron-
bach’s  alpha  was  determined  to  assess  reliability;  scales 
were  considered  reliable  with  values  of  α=0.70  and 
α=0.80.31  in  addition,  selectivity  and  common  variance 
were  tested.  in  terms  of  discrimination  validity,  correla-
tions of the subscales were conducted.

Results

the  sample  included  116  evaluated  patients  in  total.  of 
these,  41  were  adults  (>18  years)  and  74  were  children 
and adolescents (age range 3-17; overall range 3-69 years, 
one  unknown  due  to  incomplete  data).  The  total  sample 
included 45 men and 70 women (one unknown due to in-
complete  data).  The  subcategories  additionally  assessed 
were  EAT  in  the  individual  setting  (N.=53),  EAT  in  the 
group setting (N.=43), and hippotherapy (N.=17).

General module (G)

the  structure  of  the  general  module  was  examined  us-
ing  exploratory  factor  analysis.  Both  the  Bartlett  test  (χ2 
378=3530.46, P<0.000) and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin mea-
sure of sampling adequacy (KMO=0.923) indicate that the 
variables were suitable for factor analysis. the anti-image 
correlation showed that all items were in the range of 0.89-
0.97. the communalities ranged from 0.64 to 0.90, there-
fore more than half of the variance could be explained by 
the  extracted  factors.  the  maximum  likelihood  analysis 
with varimax rotation indicated a factor structure of three 
factors  with  inherent  values  greater  than  1.0,  which  was 
supported  by  the  elbow  criterion  of  the  scree  plot  with 
Kaiser normalization. the three-factor solution explained 
78.2% of the total variance.

The three factors present were motor functioning (scale 
1); psychosocial functioning (scale 2); and mental function-
ing (scale 3). The motor functionality subscale contained 9 
items, the psychosocial functioning subscale contained 11 
items, and the mental functionality subscale contained 8. 
the reliabilities of the individual scales are in the excellent 
range (α=0.96; α=0.96; α=0.95) and the reliability of the

overall scale of the general module is α=0.98. Since this 
uniform tool does not include an age-specific submodule 
for children and adolescents, reliability was also assessed 
separately  for  children  and  adolescents,  which  showed 
similar results to the overall sample for the three scales of 
the general module (α=0.94; α=0.95; α=0.96) and the total 
scale (α=0.97).

due  to  the  high  reliability,  a  reduction  of  the  general 
module was possible, which improved its time efficiency 
and economic implementation. in the statistical and con-
tent-related  modification,  9  items  were  dropped,  leaving 
28  of  the  original  37  items.  two  further  items  were  re-
formulated  and  were  included  for  a  prospective  second 
assessment phase. thus, the general module contained 30 
items  differentiated  into  three  subscales.  the  following 
table shows the items of the general module; the item dif-
ficulty is in the range 0.521-0.766. The corrected item total 
correlation is in the range of 0.670-0.912, as supplemen-
tary table i shows. factor loadings of the scales are in the 
range of 0.582-0.901.

Individual  setting  (GI)  and  the  group  setting  (GS)  sub-
modules

The  individual  setting  submodule  focuses  on  specific 
mental and motor functions. the group setting submodule 
serves  as  a  specialized  element  for  interactional  aspects 
in group therapy. the structures of the individual and the 
group setting submodules were both examined using ex-
ploratory  factor  analysis.  for  the  individual  setting,  the 
Bartlett test (χ2 78=602.63, P<0.000) and the Kaiser-Mey-
er-Olkin  measure  of  sampling  adequacy  (KMO=0.872) 
indicated  that  the  variables  are  suitable  for  factor  analy-
sis. for the group setting, both tests also indicate suitabil-
ity (Bartlett test [χ2 66=416.17, P<0.000], Kaiser-Meyer-
Olkin measure of sampling adequacy [KMO=0.852]). For 
the  individual  setting,  the  anti-image  correlation  showed 
that all items ranged within 0.73-0.94. the communalities 
ranged from 0.63 to 0.82. for the group setting, anti-image 
correlation showed an item range of 0.77-0.94, with com-
munalities ranging from 0.56 to 0.97. this meant that the 
majority of the variance of these variables can be explained 
by the extracted factors. the maximum likelihood analysis 
with varimax rotation indicated a factor structure of two 
factors with inherent values greater than 1.0 for both sub-
modules, which is supported by the elbow criterion of the 
scree plot with Kaiser normalization.

for  the  submodule  individual  setting,  the  two-factor 
solution explained 75.5% of the total variance. two fac-
tors were present: specific mental functioning (scale 1) and 

specific motor functioning (scale 2). The specific mental 
functionality subscale contained nine items, and the motor 
functionality subscale contained four. the reliabilities of 
the individual scales were in the good to excellent range 
(α=0.89;  α=0.95);  the  reliability  of  the  total  scale  of  the 
submodule was α=0.95. Reliability for children and ado-
lescents showed comparable results for the two scales of 
the individual setting submodule (α=0.89; α=0.94) and the 
total  scale  (α=0.95).  Due  to  the  high  reliability,  a  reduc-
tion of the instrument was also possible for improved tem-
poral–economic  implementation.  supplementary  table 
ii  shows  the  items  in  the  individual  setting  submodule; 
the item  difficulty was  in  the range  of  0.541–0.761. The 
corrected  item  total  correlation  is  in  the  range  of  0.456 
to  0.884.  In  the  statistical  and  content-related  modifica-
tion,  five  items  were  dropped,  leaving  13  of  the  original 
18 items. thus the individual setting submodule contained 
13 items differentiated into two subscales (Supplementary 
Table II). Factor loadings of the scales were in the range of 
0.601–0.824. for a prospective second assessment phase, 
two  Items  were  content-related  formulated  into  one  (see 
items 2a and 2b in Supplementary Table II),  so  the  final 
submodul Gi comprises 12 items.

for the group setting submodule, 72.3 percent of the total 
variance was explained via the two-factor solution. thus, 
two factors were present: interpersonal functioning (scale 
1) and intrapersonal functioning (scale 2), which contain 
aspects  of  communicational  and  interactional  functions. 
the  interpersonal  functioning  subscale  contained  seven 
items,  and  the  intrapersonal  functioning  subscale  con-
tained four. the reliabilities of the individual scales were 
in the good to excellent range (α=0.94; α=0.89); the reli-
ability of the total scale of the submodule was α=0.94. The 
reliability for children and adolescents nearly reflected the 
results for the two scales of the submodule group setting 
(α=0.93; α=0.89) and the total scale (α=0.94).

In the statistical and content-related modification and 
due to high reliability, five items were dropped, leaving 
11 of the original 16 items. one item of the submodule 
(item GS07) had to be removed from the statistical evalu-
ation due to the coronavirus pandemic, as close-contact 
group  therapy  (i.e.,  sitting  on  a  horse  in  pairs)  was  not 
possible  during  february-June  2020  due  to  contact  re-
strictions; it was reintroduced for a prospectuve second 
assessment  phase  because  therapists  considered  it  still 
relevant.  one  other  item  was  reduced  in  statistical  pro-
cedures but added back and completely reformulated for 
the second practical approach due to therapists’ feedback 
(Supplementary Table  III,  item  GS03). Thus,  the  group

setting submodule contained 13 items differentiated into 
two subscales.

supplementary  table  iii  shows  the  items  of  the  sub-
module for EAT in the group setting; the item difficulty is 
in the range of 0.558-0.702. the corrected item total cor-
relation is in the range of 0.556 to 0.840. factor loadings 
of the scales were in the range of 0.554-0.956.

Hippotherapy (H) submodule

the  hippotherapy  submodule  serves  as  a  specialized  el-
ement  for  the  evaluation  of  specific  physiological  and 
motor aspects. due to the fact that only 17 patients were 
evaluated, no multivariate statistical methods could be ap-
plied to this submodule. the results thus refer to a descrip-
tive factor assignment and the pairwise testing of bivariate 
item correlations, which must be interpreted with caution. 
there are two subscales for the areas of movement func-
tion and motor control function, but these do not allow for 
a  clear  assignment  of  factors.  for  this  reason,  the  num-
ber of items in this module element has not been reduced, 
but the items have been modified and reformulated solely 
based on feedback from therapists involved in the practical 
approach. this submodule contains 25 items. Multivariate 
statistics and item reduction procedures will be carried out 
in the future with a larger sample size.

The  final  configuration  of  the  assessment  tool  has  80 
items  in  total,  divided  into  four  modules.  for  statistical 
and  content-related  reasons,  sixteen  items  have  been  re-
duced  in  close  consultation  with  the  therapist  reviewers. 
four items have been reduced and newly created for a pro-
spective second practical approach. two items have been 
combined into one.

Discussion

the development of an icf-based assessment tool for the 
measurement and documentation of EAT is a first step in 
applying the function-orientation of the icf to the holis-
tic  aims  of  Eat.  using  the  icf  as  a  common  language 
to describe functional health status could contribute to in-
creasing standardization and systematization.17, 32 in medi-
cal  rehabilitation  practice,  implementation  of  the  icf  at 
the concrete item level in the form of checklists showed 
increased systematization of working in the rehabilitation 
team.33, 34

Here,  expert-led  discussions  were  used  as  a  scientifi-
cally satisfactory method to determine relevant items for 
this application of the icf. the internal consistencies for 
all modules were high. items correlated highly positively, 

which confirms the content fit of the item selection by the 
expert ratings. Varying intercorrelations were seen as evi-
dence that the scales are clearly distinguishable. this tool 
can be used as a uniform icf-based assessment across in-
dications and ages. reliability remained robust in the sub-
sample of children and adolescents in the overall sample; 
the tool can therefore be interpreted as reliable. practical 
utility  in  the  therapeutic  investigational  settings  proved 
itself to be economical in terms of time, with a reported 
duration of 5-7 minutes per assessment.

using  icf-based  assessments  could  also  serve  as  an 
interdisciplinary  language,  which  could  contribute  to  in-
creased  work  of  Eat  services  and  rehabilitations  clini-
cians in concert.33, 34 in terms of the Global disability ac-
tion Plan by the WHO (up to and including 2021), which 
pursues the objectives of strengthening rehabilitation and 
support  services,  and  also  the  collection  of  internation-
ally  comparable  research  data  on  disability  and  related 
services, the developed tool can contribute to this process 
by providing the first nuanced framework that can capture 
the effects of Eat from a health-related and functioning-
based  perspective  via  the  identified  factor  structure.35 
it  provides  a  valid  basis  for  therapy  documentation  and 
process  monitoring  in  Eat  and  could  contribute  toward 
filling the current research gap of systematized measure-
ment  of  concrete  Eat  outcomes,  long-term  effects,  and 
confounders.  these  procedures  also  contribute  to  syn-
chronize measures of Eat with those of the international 
health system and could prospectively provide reliable sci-
entific  evidence  about  therapy  outcomes  in  the  common 
international language of the Who. this tool may be used 
in  tandem  with  Eat  and  other  health  care  interventions, 
such  as  regular  physical  or  psychotherapy,  to  reach  pa-
tients’ global therapy goals. In the future, linking the EAT 
assessment tool with the icd-11 will be strived for, as the 
upcoming icd-11 also contains functioning properties to 
include aspects of the lived health (V-chapter for function-
ing assessment).1, 21

Limitations of the study

the study has some limitations that have to be considered 
in further investigations. The study was the first to apply 
the  ICF  classification  system  in  EAT  to  develop  an  as-
sessment tool for standardized outcome measurement and 
process monitoring of the different therapeutic subcatego-
ries  (individual  and  group  settings,  hippotherapy).  Mean 
values  of  the  scales  must  always  be  considered  against 
the background of a heterogeneous sample with regard to 
age  and  gender.  the  uniform  tool  does  not  discriminate

between  children  and  adults,  due  to  the  sample  size  and 
desire for linkability to the ICF classification system. De-
velopment  of  a  children’s  version  with  linkability  to  the 
ICF-CY  children’s  classification  and  comparability  with 
the uniform tool could be an additional approach. never-
theless,  reliability  for  children  and  adolescents  remained 
robust  in  the  uniform  tool.  for  the  statistical  analysis  of 
the hippotherapy submodule, the small sample size was a 
limiting factor. the current coVid-19 pandemic has also 
complicated carrying out therapies for a larger number of 
patients.

furthermore,  the  distortive  effects  of  the  external  as-
sessment by therapists cannot be excluded. Verification of 
the  factor  structure  via  a  confirmatory  structure  analysis 
will be carried out to confirm it over a larger sample size. 
also, examinations of positively correlated measurement 
errors are to be tested via confirmatory structure analysis. 
further  reliability  tests  will  also  be  carried  out,  such  as 
retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and change sensitiv-
ity. psychosocial-orientated therapies should additionally 
be measured by a multi-perspective approach (self-percep-
tion, perspectives of external assessors and parents) to be 
assessed reliably.

Conclusions

Based on a linking of qualitative research findings to the 
classification system of the ICF, a standardized global as-
sessment tool for the measurement of Eat was developed 
and  field-tested.  The  digital  assessment  tool  intends  to 
provide a basis for providing reliable systematic evidence 
about the efficacy of EAT and subcategories. Practical im-
plementation of this tool in the field of EAT should consti-
tute an important step to increase scientific evidence about 
EAT outcomes, which can be related to and classified into 
international health-related domains of the Who. interna-
tional usage of the developed tool should enable collabo-
ration of researchers and health care professionals across 
countries to collect and compare larger-scale health-related 
quantitative data in the common language of the icf. in ad-
dition, current research gaps can be reduced via increased 
systematization and building upon existing research strat-
egies. furthermore, rehabilitation processes can be deter-
mined and evaluated more precisely in multi-professional 
healthcare teams to assess and monitor patients’ function-
ing components most targeted. this includes an improved 
understanding  of  treatment  outcomes  in  the  context  of 
cost-effectiveness analyses and improved comparison with 
outcomes of other health care interventions.
