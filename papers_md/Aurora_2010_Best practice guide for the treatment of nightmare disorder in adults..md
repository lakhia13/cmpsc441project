1.0 INTRODUCTION

There has been a burgeoning literature about pharmacothera-
py and behavioral treatment of nightmare disorder in adults, but 
no systematic review has been available. The Standards of Prac-
tice Committee (SPC) of the American Academy of Sleep Medi-
cine (AASM) commissioned a task force to assess the literature 
on the treatment of nightmare disorder. The Board of Directors 
authorized the task force to draft a Best Practice Guide based on 
review and grading of the literature and clinical consensus.

2.0 METHODS

The SPC of the AASM commissioned among its members 
7 individuals to conduct this review and develop best practice 

principles. Work began in December 2007 to review and grade 
evidence in the peer-reviewed scientific literature regarding the 
treatment of nightmare disorder in adults. A search for articles 
on the medical treatment of nightmare disorder was conducted 
using the PubMed database, so that clinically relevant articles 
on the treatment of nightmare disorder could be collected and 
evaluated.  Other  databases  such  as  PsychLit  and  Ovid  were 
not  searched,  since  it  was  felt  that  these  databases  would  not 
include  clinically  relevant  material.  The  PubMed  search  was 
conducted with no start date limit until February 2008, and sub-
sequently updated in March 2009 to include the most current 
literature.  The  key  words  were:  [(Nightmares  OR  nightmare 
OR nightmare disorder OR nightmare disorders OR recurrent 
nightmares) AND (treatment OR drug therapy OR therapy)] as 
well as [Post-traumatic stress disorder AND (nightmare disor-

389

Standards of Practice Committee

der OR recurrent nightmares OR nightmares) AND treatment]. 
A  second  search  using  the  keyword  combination  “anxiety 
dreams” with no limits was also conducted in February 2010. 
“Post-traumatic stress disorder,” alone, was not a search term. 
Although  the  majority  of  studies  of  both  pharmacologic  and 
nonpharmacologic  treatments  of  posttraumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD) assess improvement of global manifestations, very few 
of these studies have isolated nightmares for evaluation of re-
sponse to intervention and may not have included “nightmares” 
as a keyword. The evidence basis for this Best Practice Guide 
includes  only  those  PTSD  studies  in  which  improvement  in 
nightmares could be specifically identified as an evaluable out-
come measure.

Each search was run separately and findings were merged. 
When  the  search  was  limited  to  articles  published  in  English 
and regarding human adults (age 19 years and older), a total of 
1428 articles were identified. Abstracts from these articles were

medications?

reviewed  to  determine  if  they  met  inclusion  criteria.  The  ar-
ticles had to have a minimum of 3 subjects to be included in the 
analysis. The articles had to address at least one of the “PICO” 
questions  (acronym  standing  for  Patient,  Population  or  Prob-
lem, provided a specific Intervention or exposure, after which a 
defined Comparison is performed on specified Outcomes) that 
were decided upon ahead of the review process (see Table 1). 
Articles meeting these criteria in addition to those identified by 
pearling (i.e., checking the reference sections of search results 
for  articles  otherwise  missed)  provided  57  articles  for  review 
and grading.

Evidence  was  graded  according  to  the  Oxford  Centre  for 
Evidence-based  Medicine  Levels  of  Evidence  (Table  2).1 All 
evidence grading was performed by independent review of the 
article by 2 members of the task force. Areas of disagreement 
were addressed by the task force until resolved. Recommenda-
tions were formulated based on the strength of clinical data and 
consensus attained via a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriate-
ness Method.2 The nomenclature for the recommendations and 
levels of recommendation are listed in Table 3. Recommenda-
tions were downgraded if there were significant risks involved 
in the treatment or upgraded if expert consensus determined it 
was  warranted.  This  Best  Practice  Guide  with  recommenda-
tions was then reviewed by external content experts in the area 
of nightmare disorder.

The  Board  of  Directors  of  the AASM  approved  these  rec-
ommendations. All members of the AASM SPC and Board of 
Directors completed detailed conflict-of-interest statements and 
were found to have no conflicts of interest with regard to this 
subject.

The  Best  Practice  Guide  endorses  treatments  based  on  re-
view of the literature and with agreement by a consensus of the 
task force. These guidelines should not, however, be considered 
inclusive  of  all  proper  methods  of  care  or  exclusive  of  other 
methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same re-
sults. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific 
care must be made by the physician, in light of the individual 
circumstances  presented  by  the  patient,  available  diagnostic 
tools, accessible treatment options, and resources.

The AASM expects these recommendations to have an im-
pact on professional behavior, patient outcomes, and, possibly, 
health care costs. These assessments reflect the state of knowl-
edge at the time of publication and will be reviewed, updated, 
and revised as new information becomes available.

3.0 BACKGROUND 

3.1 Definition

The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second 
edition (ICSD-2)3 has classified nightmare disorder as a para-
somnia usually associated with R sleep. The minimal diagnos-
tic criteria proposed by the ICSD-2 are as follows:

A.  Recurrent episodes of awakenings from sleep with recall 
of intensely disturbing dream mentations, usually involv-
ing fear or anxiety, but also anger, sadness, disgust, and 
other dysphoric emotions.

B.  Full alertness on awakening, with little confusion or dis-
orientation;  recall  of  sleep  mentation  is  immediate  and 
clear.

C.  At least one of the following associated features is present:

i.  Delayed return to sleep after the episodes
ii.  Occurrence of episodes in the latter half of the habitual 

sleep period.

3.2 Types of nightmares

Nightmares  may  be  idiopathic  (without  clinical  signs  of 
psychopathology) or associated with other disorders including 
PTSD, substance abuse, stress and anxiety, and borderline per-
sonality, and other psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia-
spectrum  disorders.  Eighty  percent  of  PTSD  patients  report 
nightmares (“PTSD-associated nightmares”).4 PTSD is a con-
dition  manifesting  symptoms  classified  in  three  clusters:  (1) 
intrusive/re-experiencing, (2) avoidant/numbing, and (3) hyper-
arousal. Nightmares are generally considered to be a component 
of the intrusive/re-experiencing symptom cluster. It is not clear 
that nightmares unrelated to PTSD coexist with features of the 
other PTSD symptom clusters, specifically hyperarousal.5 Nev-
ertheless, among nightmares, the PTSD-associated nightmare is 
the most studied. Presence of nightmares following a traumatic 
experience predicts delayed onset of PTSD. Even when PTSD 
resolves,  PTSD-associated  nightmares  can  persist  throughout 
life.3  Nightmares  can  also  be  induced  following  exposure  to 
drugs  that  affect  the  neurotransmitters  norepinephrine,  sero-
tonin, and dopamine.6 Withdrawal of R-suppressing agents, and 
drugs affecting GABA and acetylcholine, can also be associated 
with nightmares.3 Whether nightmares induced by drugs have 
long term sequelae (even after removing the offending agent) is 
not known. It is not clear if these different types of nightmares 
have a common underlying pathophysiology.

3.3 Assessment

Self-reported  retrospective  questionnaires  and  prospective 
logs are the most commonly used methods to assess nightmare 
characteristics. Though retrospective questionnaires could lead 
to underestimation of nightmare frequency due to recall bias,7 
prospective logs may overestimate the frequency of nightmares 
by increasing dream recall by an increased focus on dreams.8 
The  advantage  of  using  self-reported  questionnaires  and  logs 
are that they can distinguish nightmare frequency from distress. 
The gold standard diagnostic interview for PTSD is Clinician-
Administered  PTSD  Scale  (CAPS).9  This  scale,  which  was 
developed by the National Center for PTSD, is a structured in-
terview that assesses the frequency and intensity of 17 symp-

Practice Guide for the Treatment of Nightmare Disorder

toms using standard questions and behaviorally anchored rating 
scales, including for nightmares associated with PTSD. Several 
versions of CAPS have been used over the years10: CAPS-DX 
(formerly CAPS-1), a diagnostic version to assess PTSD symp-
tom severity over the past month or for the worst month since 
the  trauma;  CAPS-SX  (formerly  CAPS-2),  a  symptom  status 
version to measure PTSD symptom severity over the past week 
intended  for  repeated  assessments  over  relatively  brief  inter-
vals; and a combined version called CAPS. Other psychomet-
ric scales have been used including the Symptom Checklist-90 
(SCL-90),11  a  90-question  instrument  that  evaluates  a  broad 
range of psychological problems and can be used for measur-
ing patient progress or treatment outcomes, and the Symptom 
Questionnaire  (SQ),12  a  yes/no  questionnaire  with  brief  and 
simple items on state scales of depression, anxiety, anger-hos-
tility, and somatic symptoms.

Overnight polysomnography (PSG) is not routinely used to 
assess nightmare disorder but may be appropriately performed 
to  exclude  other  parasomnias  or  sleep-disordered  breathing. 
PSGs may underestimate the incidence and frequency of PTSD-
associated  nightmares  and  may  also  influence  the  contents  of 
the dreams.13 Patients with both idiopathic and PTSD-associat-
ed nightmares have increased phasic R sleep activity, decreased 
total  sleep  time,  increased  number  and  duration  of  nocturnal 
awakenings,  decreased  slow  wave  sleep,  and  increased  pe-
riodic  leg  movements  during  both  R  and  NREM  (N)  sleep.14 
PTSD-associated nightmares, though commonly reported in R 
sleep, can occur earlier in the night, during sleep onset, and in N 
sleep.15 Patients with PTSD-associated nightmares compared to 
those with idiopathic nightmares have decreased sleep efficien-
cy due to higher nocturnal awakenings,16 and a higher incidence 
of other parasomnias and sleep-related breathing disorders.

3.4 Consequences of nightmare disorder

Nightmare  disorder  is  common,  affecting  about  4%  of  the 
adult  population3  with  a  higher  proportion  affecting  children 
and adolescents. The presence of nightmare disorder can impair 
quality of life, resulting in sleep avoidance and sleep depriva-
tion,  with  a  consequent  increase in  the  intensity of  the  night-
mares.  Nightmare  disorder  can  also  predispose  to  insomnia, 
daytime  sleepiness,  and  fatigue.17-19  It  may  also  cause  or  ex-
acerbate underlying psychiatric distress and illness. Nightmare 
disorder can be associated with waking psychological dysfunc-
tion,  with  the  frequency  of  nightmares  being  inversely  corre-
lated with measures of well-being and measures of nightmare 
distress being associated with psychopathology such as depres-
sion and anxiety.20 Patients who have their nightmares success-
fully treated appear to have better sleep quality, feel more rested 
on awakening, and report less daytime fatigue and sleepiness, 
and improvement in their symptoms of insomnia.17-19

4.0 TREATMENT FOR NIGHTMARE DISORDER

The  purpose  of  this  Best  Practice  Guide  is  to  present  rec-
ommendations  on  therapy  of  nightmare  disorder.  Treatment 
modalities  for  nightmare  disorder  include  medications,  most 
prominently  prazosin,  and  several  behavioral  therapies,  of 
which the nightmare-focused cognitive behavioral therapy vari-
ants, especially image rehearsal therapy, are effective. Interest-

Standards of Practice Committee

ingly, there are no large-scale, well-controlled trials comparing 
pharmacologic with non-pharmacologic therapies.21

4.1 The following are medication treatment options for 
nightmare disorder

A variety of medications have been studied for possible ben-
efit in patients with nightmares. The studies of most medications 
assess efficacy only in the treatment of PTSD-associated night-
mares. It is unknown if treatments that demonstrate efficacy for 
PTSD-associated nightmares are also effective for idiopathic or 
drug-related nightmares, or if these therapies would work for 
patients who have bad dreams that do not fulfill ICSD-2 criteria 
for nightmare disorder, such as those that occur in the first half 
of the night or that are not associated with an awakening. Even 
if the focus is limited to PTSD-associated nightmares, there is 
an insufficient number of controlled trials to formulate rigorous 
evidence-based  guidelines  on  nightmare  disorder,22  although 
an  evidence-based  systematic  review  of  pharmacotherapy  for 
PTSD, not specifically related to improvement in nightmares, 
has been published.23 Many patients with PTSD are on multiple 
psychotropic medications, making the assessment of efficacy of 
monotherapy of any particular medication difficult. A summary 
of the volume and grade of literature is in Appendix Table 1 
and discussed in detail below.

4.1.1 Prazosin is recommended for treatment of PTSD-
associated nightmares. Level A

The rationale for the use of pharmacologic reduction of CNS 
adrenergic activity in the treatment of PTSD has recently been 
reviewed  by  Boehnlein  and  Kinzie.24  Norepinephrine  appears 
to  play  an  important  role  in  the  pathophysiology  of  PTSD-
related nightmares, arousal, selective attention, and vigilance. 
Norepinephrine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and urine are 
elevated in patients with PTSD. CSF norepinephrine concentra-
tion appears to correlate with the severity of PTSD symptoms. 
It has been proposed that the consistently elevated CNS norad-
renergic activity may contribute to disruption of normal R sleep 
and that agents that reduce this activity could be effective for 
treatment of some manifestations of PTSD, particularly arousal 
symptoms such as nightmares and startle reactions.24

Propranolol, a non-selective β-adrenergic blocker, has been in-
vestigated for treatment and perhaps prevention of PTSD.25 Para-
doxically,  β-blockers  are  often  associated  with  sleep  disorders 
including nightmares and insomnia.26 The literature review found 
no studies related to the use of propranolol or other beta-blockers 
for treatment of nightmares, even in patients with PTSD.

Prazosin is an α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist introduced 
as an antihypertensive agent. It reduces CNS sympathetic out-
flow throughout the brain. Several CNS phenomena implicated 
in  the  pathogenesis  of  PTSD  are  regulated  by  α1-adrenergic 
receptors  including  a  number  of  sleep/nightmare  phenomena, 
and  cognitive  disruption.24  In  a  placebo-controlled  study,  the 
effects of prazosin on sleep included increased total sleep time, 
increased REM sleep time, and increased mean R period dura-
tion without alteration of sleep-onset latency.27

The  data  supporting  efficacy  of  prazosin  in  the  treatment 
of PTSD-associated nightmares consist of 3 Level 1 placebo-
controlled studies,27-29 all of which are from the same group of 
investigators, and 4 Level 4 studies.30-33 Prazosin was found to 

be moderately to strongly beneficial in all the studies. Ninety-
eight  patients  were  studied.  The  3  Level  1  studies  evaluated 
10 Vietnam combat veterans (mean age 53 years),29 34 military 
veterans (mean age 56 years),28 and 13 civilian trauma victims 
(mean age 49 ± 10 years, 11/13 women)27 in placebo-controlled 
trials; all found a statistically significant reduction in trauma-
related nightmares versus placebo as measured by Item No. 2 
“recurrent  distressing  dreams”  on  CAPS  (initial  rating  4.8  to 
6.9 in the Level 1 studies; final rating after prazosin treatment 
was 3.2 to 3.6). The treatment length ranged from 3 to 9 weeks. 
All patients maintained their ongoing concurrent psychothera-
py  and  psychotropic  medications  during  the  trials.  Treatment 
was generally started at 1 mg at bedtime and increased by 1 to 
2 mg every few days until an effective dose was reached. The 
average dose was approximately 3 mg, although 1 mg to over 
10 mg were used and found to be effective, with higher doses 
used in 2 of the Level 1 studies treating PTSD-associated night-
mares in military veterans (mean of 9.5 mg/day29 and 13.3 mg/
day28). In all of the studies, prazosin appeared to be generally 
well  tolerated;  nevertheless,  the  clinician  should  monitor  the 
patient for orthostatic hypotension.

4.1.2 Clonidine may be considered for treatment of PTSD-
associated nightmares. Level C

Clonidine is an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist that suppress-
es sympathetic nervous system outflow throughout the brain. It 
is widely used to treat opioid withdrawal, in which context it 
blocks an elevated startle reaction. Clonidine shares the thera-
peutic  rationale  as  well  as  the  potential  for  postural  hypoten-
sion  of  prazosin  but  has  not  been  investigated  with  the  same 
rigor. It has been reported that low-dose clonidine increases R 
sleep and decreases N sleep, whereas medium-dose clonidine 
decreases R sleep and increases N2 sleep.34 There were 2 Level 
4 case series demonstrating efficacy of 0.2 to 0.6 mg clonidine 
(in divided doses) to reduce the number of nightmares in 11/13 
Cambodian refugees (no statistical analysis done).35,36 Follow-
up ranged from 2 weeks to 3 months with one report of a fall in 
blood pressure with increasing dose. These were from a single 
site, and 9 were also treated with imipramine. Boehnlein and 
Kinzie24  report  that  “clonidine  has  been  a  mainstay  of  PTSD 
treatment for severely traumatized refugees for over 20 years,” 
yet no randomized placebo-controlled trials of clonidine for the 
treatment  of  nightmares  or  other  aspects  of  PTSD  have  been 
reported. Despite the long history of use and the pharmacologic 
similarity  to  prazosin,  the  paucity  of  hard  data  relegates  this 
medication to a lower level recommendation.

4.1.3 The following medications may be considered for 
treatment of PTSD-associated nightmares, but the data are 
low grade and sparse: trazodone, atypical antipsychotic 
medications, topiramate, low dose cortisol, fluvoxamine, 
triazolam and nitrazepam, phenelzine, gabapentin, 
cyproheptadine, and tricyclic antidepressants. Nefazodone is 
not recommended as first line therapy for nightmare disorder 
because of the increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Level C

4.1.3.1 Trazodone

A Level 4 survey37 of 74 patients who were given trazodone 
found that it was effective in decreasing the frequency of night-

mares but also had significant side effects. Of 60 veterans pre-
scribed trazodone during an 8-week hospitalization, 72% found 
it decreased nightmares, with a fall from an average occurrence 
of 3.3 nights per week to 1.3 nights per week (p < 0.005). The 
dose ranged from 25 to 600 mg, with a mean of 212 mg. Sixty 
percent (36/60) of those who tolerated trazodone therapy com-
plained of the following side effects (decreasing order of fre-
quency): daytime sedation, dizziness, headache, priapism, and 
orthostatic hypotension Nineteen percent of the original sample 
(14/74) discontinued the drug because of side effects (priapism, 
daytime sedation, more vivid nightmares, severe dry mouth and 
sinuses).  Only  1  subject  was  not  on  additional  psychotropic 
medications  (mostly  antidepressants,  but  also  antipsychotics 
and pain medication).

4.1.3.2 aTypicaL anTipsychoTic medicaTions: oLanzapine, 
risperidone, and aripiprazoLe

Olanzapine is an atypical neuroleptic which has been shown 
to be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar ma-
nia.  It  was  used  in  a  small  uncontrolled  case  series38  (Level 
4 evidence) of 5 patients with combat-related PTSD resistant 
to  treatment  with  SSRIs  and  benzodiazepines  because  of  re-
ports  that  it  improved  sleep.  The  authors  reported  rapid  im-
provement after 10-20 mg olanzapine was added to the current 
psychotropic  treatment  regimen. There  was  no  quantification 
of medication effect and no long-term follow-up. No adverse 
events were seen.38

Risperidone  is  an  atypical  antipsychotic  medication  that 
demonstrates  significant  α1-noradrenergic  antagonism.39  Two 
Level  4  case  series40,41  showed  moderate  to  high  efficacy  of 
risperidone in treating patients with PTSD-related nightmares. 
The 6-week results of an open-label, flexible dosage (1 to 3 mg/
day)  trial40  of  17 Vietnam  combat  veterans  showed  a  statisti-
cally significant fall in the CAPS score of recurrent distressing 
dreams (p = 0.04) with a reduction in the proportion of diaries 
documenting  trauma  dreams  (38%  to  19%,  p  =  0.04).  Many 
of these patients were taking others medications as well (anti-
depressants, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics). A retrospective 
study41 of 10 adult burn patients on pain medications reported 
that  all  subjects  experienced  improvement  in  nightmares  (no 
quantitative  analysis  done),  as  well  as  other  distressing  acute 
stress  symptoms,  1-2  days  after  starting  risperidone  (0.5  to  2 
mg;  average  1  mg).  Neither  study  reported  side  effects,  and 
there was no long-term follow-up.

There is a Level 4 case series42 on the effect of aripiprazole 
with CBT or with sertraline in 5 patients suffering from com-
bat-related PTSD. Aripiprazole, 15 to 30 mg at bedtime, result-
ed in significant improvement but not total resolution of sleep 
disturbances such as nightmares in 4/5 cases. The patient who 
did  not  respond  stopped  the  medication  because  of  agitation 
and inability to sleep. Duration of follow-up was not specified.

Practice Guide for the Treatment of Nightmare Disorder

portedly reduced nightmares in 79% of patients, with full sup-
pression in 50%. The final dosage for 91% of full responders 
was 100 mg/day or less, but the range was 12.5 to 500 mg/day. 
Follow-up ranged from 1 to 119 weeks. Nine patients discontin-
ued treatment due to side effects, which included urticaria, eat-
ing cessation, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe headaches, 
overstimulation/panic, emergent suicidal ideation, and memory 
concerns.

4.1.3.4 Low-dose corTisoL

Low-dose cortisol (10 mg/day, either in the morning or half 
at noon and half in the evening) was found to have medium-
to-high benefit with low side effects in 3 civilians with PTSD 
in a Level 4 study for 1 month.44 There was a significant re-
duction in the frequency of nightmares but not intensity in 2 
subjects; there were no data on nightmare effect for the third 
subject. One of the patients was also on mianserin and chlor-
prothixene. There were no reported side effects and no long-
term follow-up.

4.1.3.5 FLuvoxamine

Two Level 4 case series45,46 showed moderate-to-high effica-
cy in 42 patients with up to 300 mg fluvoxamine. One study46 
of 21 Vietnam veterans reported a statistically significant fall 
in the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) level of “dreams 
about  combat  trauma”  but  a  non-significant  fall  in  the  rating 
of  “bad  dreams”  from  the  Stress  Response  Rating  Scale  at 
10  weeks.  No  side  effects  were  noted  in  the  study.  The  pa-
tients were on no other psychoactive medications. The second 
study45 of 24 Dutch WWII Resistance veterans reported a qual-
itative decrease in nightmares in 12 subjects. No further details 
were  given.  Of  note,  12  subjects  dropped  out  of  the  trial,  9 
due to gastrointestinal problems and worsening of sleep, and 
3 for physical complaints not related to fluvoxamine. Follow-
up ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. Some of the patients were on 
benzodiazepines.

4.1.3.6 TriazoLam and niTrazepam

In a 3-day Level 2 cross-over study47 comparing the hypnotic 
efficacy of triazolam versus nitrazepam in 40 patients with “dis-
turbed sleep,” 0.5 mg triazolam was found to be superior to 5 
mg  nitrazepam  in  terms  of  objective  measures  of  sleep  dura-
tion and quality. However, both drugs were equally effective at 
reducing the number of subjects who noted unpleasant dreams, 
from 23 prior to medication administration to 1 subject for ni-
trazepam  and  2  subjects  for  triazolam.  Each  drug  was  given 
for just one night and the measure of nightmare frequency was 
limited.  There  was  no  difference  in  side  effects,  which  were 
considered  minor  and  consisted  of  difficulty  concentrating  in 
the morning and morning sedation.

4.1.3.7 pheneLzine

4.1.3.3 TopiramaTe

A Level 4 case series43 studied the efficacy of topiramate in 
35 civilians who suffered from PTSD primarily due to physical 
assault or unwanted sexual experience. Dosage titration began 
at  12.5  to  25  mg  daily  and  was  increased  in  25  to  50  mg  in-
crements  every  3  to  4  days  until  a  therapeutic  response  was 
achieved  or  the  drug  was  no  longer  tolerated. Topiramate  re-

Two Level 4 studies48,49 studied phenelzine as a single medi-
cation  in  a  total  of  26  military  veterans. The  dosage  in  these 
studies ranged from 30 to 90 mg. One study48 with 5 subjects 
found that phenelzine eliminated nightmares entirely within 1 
month with long-term follow-up up to 18 months later. Three 
of  the  5  subjects  were  nightmare-free  without  medication. 
The other study49 demonstrated a fall in an average “traumatic

dream” severity scale in 21 veterans from just above moderate 
(2.2/4) to just below moderate (1.8/4), a change that reflected 
an improvement of 18%, but just missed the level of statistical 
significance (p = 0.05). Six patients stopped treatment within 8 
weeks because of a lack of improvement. Treatment was ulti-
mately discontinued in the remaining subjects because the ini-
tial improvement was minor or short-lived or reached a plateau 
felt  to  be  sufficiently  unsatisfactory  to  justify  a  change  to  an 
alternate medication. Reported side effects included dizziness, 
drowsiness, and malaise. Although not specifically stated, the 
ability of phenelzine to reduce R sleep was cited. As an MAOI, 
phenelzine can cause a hypertensive crisis if taken with sym-
pathomimetic  medications  or  with  high  tyramine-containing 
foods.50

4.1.3.8 GabapenTin

There is a Level 4 study51 of 30 veterans with PTSD that used 
adjunctive gabapentin at 300-3600 mg/day, most of whom were 
on antidepressants with some on antipsychotics and anxiolytics. 
The results showed a medium to high effect, with 77% of pa-
tients showing a moderate or greater improvement in insomnia, 
and most of those subjects noting a decrease in the frequency 
and/or intensity of nightmares over a follow-up period of 1 to 
36 months (this response was not quantified in the paper). The 
mean dosage for patients with moderate or marked clinical im-
provement was 1344 ± 701 mg, and for those with mild or no 
improvement it was 685 ± 227 mg. Sedation and mild dizziness 
were the most commonly reported side effects.

4.1.3.9 cyprohepTadine

The  evidence  for  cyproheptadine,  which  has  serotonin 
antagonism  properties,  consists  of  3  Level  4  papers  with 
conflicting  data.52-54 A  small  case  series52  of  4  veterans  with 
combat-related PTSD, who were said to be representative of 
“about 80” patients treated with effective doses ranging from 
16-24  mg,  reported  that  cyproheptadine  eliminated  night-
mares  in  3  patients  on  doses  ranging  from  2-6  mg  nightly. 
When  effective,  it  generally  took  effect  within  a  few  days. 
The  proposed  mechanism  of  effect  was  through  increasing 
serotonin levels by blocking feedback inhibition. Long-term 
follow-up was not reported. A retrospective review54 of psy-
chiatric  records  of  patients  who  received  cyproheptadine  as 
treatment  for  nightmares  provided  incomplete  information. 
Only  9  patients  whose  responses  varied  from  “complete  re-
mission” to decreased intensity and frequency were described 
in  detail,  and  the  total  number  of  records  reviewed  was  not 
reported. Four of 16 patients studied at a VA PTSD treatment 
center reported cyproheptadine to be effective but there was 
no change in report of nightmare presence and intensity over 
a one-month period at a dose of 4-8 mg in any of the 16 sub-
jects. All but 2 of the 16 patients were taking a wide variety of 
other psychotropic medications. Side effects included drowsi-
ness, irritability, hallucinations, nausea, headache, and wors-
ening of nightmares.53

4.1.3.10 TricycLic anTidepressanTs

There was 1 Level 4 study55 of 10 Cambodian concentration 
camp survivors treated with tricyclic antidepressants for PTSD. 
Nightmares ceased in 4/10 and improved in another 4/10 with

no worsening of nightmares and no reported side effects. Unfor-
tunately, they were all on different regimens, including imipra-
mine as monotherapy (75 mg-125 mg; 3 subjects), imipramine 
(150 mg) with phenelzine alone or phenelzine and doxepin and 
amitriptyline (2 subjects), amitriptyline (100 mg) with doxepin 
(1  subject),  and  doxepin  alone  (50-100  mg,  4  subjects).  The 
2  subjects  who  did  not  have  any  improvement  in  nightmares 
were either on doxepin 100 mg or imipramine (150 mg) with 
doxepin  (150  mg),  phenelzine  (30  mg  bid),  and  amitriptyline 
(100 mg). Although follow-up occurred at 1 year, the paper did 
not detail the length of treatment with each medication. In addi-
tion to medication, the patients also had monthly clinic visits to 
discuss ways to handle stress.

4.1.3.11 neFazodone

There  are  3  Level  4  studies  that  evaluated  nefazodone  as 
monotherapy in a total of 39 patients. An open-label 12-week 
clinical and sleep EEG study of 12 male veterans treated with 
nefazodone (mean dosage 441 mg) demonstrated significantly 
fewer  nightmares  (30%  fewer  at  12  weeks)  and  sleep  prob-
lems. There were no changes in polysomnographic variables 
compared to baseline.56 An additional study of 10 Vietnam-era 
veterans  (dosage  500-600  mg/day)  reported  improvement  in 
nightmares  (as  measured  by  a  decrease  in  the  IES-R  night-
mare  assessment  from  3.5  to  2.1,  p  =  0.003)  in  response  to 
nefazodone.57 A third uncontrolled study of 17 civilians with 
PTSD with a mean nefazodone dose of 386 ± 192 mg/day re-
ported a 58.3% response rate for nightmares on the Structured 
Interview  for  PTSD  (SIP)  after  2  weeks  of  treatment  and  a 
50%  response  rate  at  week  12.58 This  drug,  now  only  avail-
able in generic form, must be used with caution and careful 
monitoring,  as  cases  of  hepatic  failure  have  been  associated 
with  nefazodone.59 The  following  side  effects  were  noted  in 
the studies: bitter taste, increased appetite, drowsiness, head-
ache, dry mouth, dizziness, and hypersomnia.

4.1.4 Venlafaxine is not suggested for treatment of PTSD-
associated nightmares. Level B

This assessment is based on 1 Level 1 study60 of venlafax-
ine ER (37.5 to 300 mg/d) with 340 subjects treated for PTSD 
(combination of combat-related and non-combat related). This 
study  was  a  pooled  analysis  of  2  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled  trials  assessing  response  (via  CAPS-SX17)
at  12  weeks  of  therapy. The  study  showed  no  significant  dif-
ference between the effects of placebo and venlafaxine ER in 
the CAPS-SX17 item Distressing Dreams. No side effects were 
noted in the study, and there was no long-term follow-up. Al-
though venlafaxine did not result in a greater improvement in 
nightmares than did placebo, it resulted in statistically signifi-
cant improvement in 13 other PTSD symptoms when compared 
with placebo.

4.1.5 No recommendation is made regarding clonazepam 
because of sparse data.

This  assessment  is  based  on  only  1  Level  2  study61  of  6 
veterans  with  PTSD  and  may  be  revised  if  more  data  be-
come  available.  The  study  was  a  randomized,  single-blind, 
placebo-controlled,  crossover  clinical  trial  which  found  that 
clonazepam was largely ineffective for treatment of sleep dis-

395

turbances associated with combat-related posttraumatic stress 
disorder. Although  1  to  2  mg  of  clonazepam  at  bedtime  im-
proved  problems  with  sleep  initiation  and  maintenance,  the 
differences were not statistically significant and there was no 
improvement in nightmare intensity or frequency. Side effects 
were indiscernible from placebo, and there was no long-term 
follow-up.

4.2 The following are non-pharmacological treatment 
options for nightmare disorder

The etiology of nightmares is suggested to be multifacto-
rial and may be influenced by psychological factors to a great 
extent. There is an immense literature demonstrating efficacy 
of psychotherapeutic interventions for PTSD, including trau-
ma-focused  Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  (CBT).  Trauma-
focused CBT, particularly IRT, has been shown to be effective 
treatment for sleep-related issues in PTSD as summarized in 
a  systematic  review62  and  2  meta-analyses63,64  that  included 
36  RCTs  related  to  disturbed  sleep  in  PTSD  patients. These 
studies focused on general sleep characteristics in PTSD and 
not  specifically  on  nightmares.  The  discussion  that  follows 
addresses the efficacy of those treatments for nightmares. Al-
though  some  treatments  were  only  studied  on  patients  with 
PTSD, it is possible that these treatment modalities would also 
be effective in patients with idiopathic nightmares or disturb-
ing dreams that do not fulfill ICSD-2 criteria, as illustrated by 
the efficacy of IRT in a diverse patient population. Appendix 
Box  1  summarizes  the  non-pharmacological  therapies  avail-
able to the practitioner for patients suffering from nightmare 
disorder.

4.2.1 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) 

CBT is psychotherapeutic approach that focuses on distort-
ed/dysfunctional  thoughts,  emotions,  and  behavior  through  a 
goal-oriented,  structured  and  time  limited  procedure.  CBT  is 
often  used  as  a  broad  term  for  a  number  of  psychotherapeu-
tic  and  behavioral  techniques  tailored  to  uncover,  alter,  and 
correct distortions of cognition and behavior in an individual. 
Some of the early interventions used basic CBT principles65,66 
effectively to manage nightmares until more effective and spe-
cialized CBT techniques targeting the symptoms of nightmares 
evolved. The documented variants of CBT that are specifically 
focused  on  treatment  of  nightmares  include  Image  Rehearsal 
Therapy and its modifications, Lucid Dreaming Therapy, Sleep 
Dynamic Therapy, Self-exposure Therapy, and Systematic De-
sensitization. CBT also includes an IRT variant, Exposure, Re-
laxation and Rescripting Therapy.

4.2.1.1 imaGe rehearsaL Therapy (irT) is recommended For 
TreaTmenT oF niGhTmare disorder. LeveL a

Image Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) is a modified CBT technique 
that  utilizes  recalling  the  nightmare,  writing  it  down,  chang-
ing the theme, story line, ending, or any part of the dream to a 
more positive one, and rehearsing the rewritten dream scenario 
so  that  the  patient  can  displace  the  unwanted  content  when 
the  dream  recurs.  IRT  acts  to  inhibit  the  original  nightmare, 
providing a cognitive shift that empirically refutes the original 
premise of the nightmare.67 This technique is practiced for 10-
20 minutes per day while awake.

Practice Guide for the Treatment of Nightmare Disorder
This recommendation is based on 1 Level 1,67 1 Level 2,68 
1 Level 3,69 and 7 Level 4 studies.65,70-75 Although the Level 1, 
Level  2,  and  Level  3  studies  are  from  a  single  site,  the  data 
are  sufficiently  compelling  to  merit  a  Level  A  recommen-
dation.  The  Level  1  study67  demonstrated  that  IRT  is  a  brief, 
effective,  well-tolerated  treatment  for  chronic  nightmares  as-
sociated with PTSD. This RCT of 168 women with moderate-
to-severe PTSD symptoms demonstrated that IRT significantly 
improved  disturbing  dreams,  sleep  quality,  and  posttraumatic 
stress symptoms (60% reduction) and the effect was maintained 
at 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations compared to control 
group. However, there was a high drop-out rate (32%) and the 
control group was a wait-list control [see footnote on page 398] 
and blinding for treatment was not possible.

A Level 2 study68 demonstrated sustained reduction of night-
mare  frequency  at  30  months  in  2  groups  of  10  patients  each 
treated  for  chronic  nightmares  with  CBT.  The  initial  3-month 
data were reported in an earlier Level 2 study76 but were not con-
sidered separately as this longer-term report superseded the ear-
lier reference. As part of CBT, 1 group learned IRT and the other 
group recorded the nightmares in a diary for 1 month. At 3-month 
follow-up the IRT group had a 72% reduction (p < 0.006) in night-
mare frequency (7.2/month to 2.0/month) compared to a 42% re-
duction (p < 0.02) in frequency (9.4/month to 5.0/month) noted in 
the recording-only group. Interestingly the study showed that the 
IRT group also had substantial decrease in anxiety, somatization, 
hostility, and total distress scores on the SCL-90 and SQ when 
compared with the recording-only group (no p-value given). The 
subsequent addition of imagery rehearsal and rescripting to the 
first group that used only nightmare recording did not produce 
further decrease in symptoms at 30-month follow-up. The initial 
effects of these 2 individual techniques appeared to be the most 
potent in reducing nightmares.

In a Level 3 study69 of 58 subjects with chronic nightmares, 
IRT  demonstrated  a  clinically  meaningful  and  significant  de-
crease  in  nightmare  frequency  with  long-term  follow-up.  At 
18  months,  68%  of  the  remaining  53  subjects  no  longer  met 
criteria for nightmare disorder. This study is a follow-up from 
a prior Level 2 study77 of 58 subjects with nightmare disorder 
who were not screened for psychiatric illness and likely repre-
sented both idiopathic and PTSD-associated nightmare disorder 
(personal communication from the author).

Additionally there were 7 other Level 4 studies,65,70-75 com-
prising  187  subjects,  that  indicated  strong  benefits  for  IRT  in 
the management of nightmares in patients with PTSD-associ-
ated and idiopathic nightmares. These were mainly case series 
or studies with few subjects and with either no control group or 
no blinding. 

IRT appears to be effective in the management of nightmares 
exhibited  in  patients  with  PTSD  as  well  as  idiopathic  night-
mares. This was generally a well-tolerated treatment although 
there was 1 report72 of a subject who developed paradoxical hy-
perarousal with an increase in nightmare frequency (although 
this  could  also  represent  the  natural  progression  of  the  disor-
der). This may indicate the potential for this type of treatment 
to induce an exacerbation of PTSD symptoms during the thera-
peutic  process.  It  is  important  to  mention  that  several  of  the 
higher-level data are from a single-site or contributions associ-
ated with a particular expert in the field. Additional high level

studies from different sites demonstrating the effectiveness of 
treatment are limited.

4.2.1.5 seLF-exposure Therapy may be considered For TreaTmenT 
oF niGhTmare disorder. LeveL c

4.2.1.2 Lucid dreaminG Therapy (LdT) may be considered For 
TreaTmenT For niGhTmare disorder. LeveL c

A  variant  of  IRT,  the  cognitive-restructuring  technique  of 
LDT  allows  one  to  alter  the  nightmare  story  line  during  the 
nightmare itself by realizing that one is dreaming or being “lu-
cid” during the nightmare.

This  recommendation  is  based  on  1  Level  378  (16  subjects 
in the treatment arms) and 1 Level 4 study79 (5 subjects). The 
Level 3 study demonstrated that at 12-week follow-up, 2 hours 
of  individual  LDT  counseling  (p  =  0.0002)  was  more  effec-
tive than 2 hours of group LDT (p = 0.02) instruction although 
both showed a statistically significant fall in the frequency of 
nightmares when compared with baseline. The wait-list control 
group (p = 0.30) did not demonstrate a statistically significant 
reduction. A  Level  4  case  series  of  5  patients,  with  either  id-
iopathic or PTSD nightmares, showed alleviation of recurrent 
nightmares  at  1  year  when  lucid  dreaming  was  added  to  the 
subjects who were initially trained in progressive muscle relax-
ation and guided imagery.

Low grade evidence suggests LDT may be helpful. Howev-
er, it may have only limited applicability in terms of availability 
and incorporation of treatment.

4.2.1.3 exposure, reLaxaTion and rescripTinG Therapy 
(errT) may be considered For TreaTmenT oF pTsd-associaTed 
niGhTmares. LeveL c

Exposure,  Relaxation  and  Rescripting  Therapy  (ERRT)  is 
a specialized treatment modality targeting anxiety, which may 
manifest  as  physiological,  behavioral,  and  cognitive  dysfunc-
tion.  The  treatment  involves  psychoeducation,  sleep  hygiene, 
and  progressive  muscle  relaxation  training.  Exposure  proce-
dures such as writing out and rescripting the nightmares, home-
work assignments, problem solving, and coping strategies are 
intended to help deal with the nightmares. This form of treat-
ment is similar to IRT except for type of exposure utilized.

This assessment is based on 1 small Level 4 study.80 ERRT 
was  found  to  decrease  the  frequency  and  severity  of  trauma-
related  nightmares  in  4  subjects  at  3-  and  6-month  follow-up 
evaluations.

4.2.1.4 sLeep dynamic Therapy may be considered For TreaTmenT 
oF pTsd-associaTed niGhTmares. LeveL c

Sleep Dynamic Therapy is an integrated program combining 
standard  clinical  sleep  medicine  instructions  including  sleep 
quality and sleep hygiene with psychotherapeutic interventions 
using principles of CBT like stimulus control, IRT, etc. A sam-
ple protocol of this treatment includes conveying 6 educational/
therapeutic principles (including sleep quality assessment with 
behavioral  deconditioning,  sleep  hygiene,  stimulus  control, 
IRT,  education  on  3  defining  posttraumatic  stress  symptoms, 
and physiologic assessment) in weekly 2-hour sessions. 

This  assessment  is  based  on  1  Level  4  pilot  study75  of  66 
PTSD subjects without a control group that demonstrated im-
provements in insomnia and nightmares at the 12-week follow-
up with a significant reduction in the Nightmare Severity Index 
(Cohen d = 1.09, p < 0.0001).

Self-exposure  Therapy  is  a  variant  of  CBT  that  utilizes  a 
technique  of  “graded  exposure.”  The  patient  is  instructed  to 
make  a  hierarchical  list  of  anxiety-provoking  events/dreams. 
The  patient  is  then  instructed  to  move  through  the  situations 
on the list at his or her own rate, starting with lowest anxiety 
situation until the fear/anxiety has decreased. The exposure is 
done on a daily basis with documentation in a journal of his or 
her experiences.

This  recommendation  is  based  on  1  Level  2  and  1  Level  3 
study  of  patients  with  idiopathic  or  PTSD  related  nightmares. 
The Level 2 RCT81 involved 206 subjects randomized to 4 weeks 
of (a) self-exposure treatment at home (n = 83), (b) self-relax-
ation treatment at home (n = 61), and (c) a wait-list control group 
(n = 62), all instruction coming from a treatment manual received 
in the mail. Self-exposure therapy (p < 0.0005) was better than 
self-relaxation therapy or wait-list control for reducing nightmare 
frequency. The limitations of the study included a high drop-out 
rate (17%) and the fact that the nightmare intensity was not great-
ly reduced after 4 weeks of self-exposure, which may indicate the 
need for longer treatment duration. In a Level 3 open random-
ized study82 involving 20 subjects with recurrent nightmares, 10 
each were randomized to a correspondence-based self-exposure 
therapy trial and a control group. At the 4-week follow-up, the 
self-exposure group had significant improvements in nightmare 
frequency and intensity (p < 0.001), and the benefit was main-
tained at the 4-year follow-up. This small study had no drop-outs 
and the subjects served as their own controls.

4.2.1.6 sysTemaTic desensiTizaTion is suGGesTed For TreaTmenT 
oF idiopaThic niGhTmares. LeveL b

Systematic  Desensitization  is  a  type  of  behavioral  therapy 
that  uses  the  principle  of  gradually  exposing  the  patient  to 
what he fears. This technique is also called “graduated expo-
sure therapy.” The patient is trained to cope and manage the 
stressors gradually before the patient is actually exposed to the 
feared object or situation.

This  recommendation  is  based  on  1  Level  1,  1  Level  2, 
and 1 Level 4 study. The Level 1 study83 compared Progres-
sive Deep Muscle Relaxation (PDMR) (11 subjects) with sys-
temic  desensitization  (10  subjects)  and  wait-listed  controls 
(11  subjects).  Although  both  intervention  groups  showed 
similar decrease in frequency of nightmares, at 25-week fol-
low-up the desensitization group (p < 0.026) showed signifi-
cantly greater reduction in nightmare intensity compared to 
the relaxation group (see PDMR section for details). A Level 
2  8-week  randomized  control  study84  randomly  assigned  29 
subjects  to  a  Systemic  Desensitization  treatment  group  (10 
subjects),  a  continuous  self-recording  group  (9  subjects), 
and a nightmare-related discussion placebo treatment group 
(10 subjects). The short-term Systemic Desensitization treat-
ment  was  found  to  produce  favorable  changes  in  frequency 
(p  <  0.01)  and  rated  intensity  of  the  nightmares  (p  <  0.01). 
However, follow-up nightmare information was available for 
only 65% of the subjects. 

The Level 4 study73 involved 36 subjects with chronic night-
mares, of whom 14 received 1 single treatment instruction of 
desensitization with progressive muscle relaxation and 14 with

rehearsal  of  changed  nightmares.  Eight  were  excluded  after 
intake. All subjects were contacted via telephone at 4 months 
and 7 months. Both the treatment groups showed a decrease in 
frequency of nightmares (p < 0.0001).

Although  the  studies  are  multicenter  and  well-designed, 
demonstrating  statistical  significance,  more  data  on  larger 
groups of subjects with lower drop-out rates would be helpful 
to fully understand the usefulness of this technique.

4.2.2 Progressive Deep Muscle Relaxation Training is 
suggested for treatment of idiopathic nightmares. Level B

Progressive Deep Muscle Relaxation (PDMR) involves tens-
ing and releasing the muscles, one body part at a time, to bring 
about a feeling of physical relaxation and reduction in anxiety 
and stress.

This  recommendation  is  based  on  1  Level  1  study83  of  32 
females self-referred with complaints of nightmares. They were 
randomly assigned to PDMR training, systemic desensitization, 
and wait-list controls. Both treatments reduced nightmare fre-
quency  by  80%  in  20/21  subjects  (p  =  0.001  compared  with 
wait-listed controls), and 12 of these subjects had total elimi-
nation of symptoms. The treatment groups showed greater de-
crease in nightmare frequency compared to wait-listed controls 
(p < 0.001) at week 15. After week 25, although the effect on 
frequency of nightmares was favorable and consistent, the de-
sensitization group had a more favorable effect on intensity (p < 
0.026) of the nightmares, especially favoring the earlier-treated 
group (p < 0.046) over the later-treated wait-listed controls in-
dicating improved benefit with longer duration of treatment.

The  data  for  PDMR  based  on  this  1  small  study  is  statis-
tically  compelling.  However,  further  research  is  warranted  to 
validate these findings.

4.2.3 Hypnosis may be considered for treatment of PTSD-
associated nightmares. Level C

Hypnosis  or  Hypnotherapy  is  a  trance-like  state  of  mind. 
Hypnosis  creates  a  state  of  deep  relaxation  which  helps  the 
mind  to  concentrate  intensely  on  a  specific  thought,  memory, 
feeling, or sensation without distractions and making the per-
son  open  to  suggestions  that  can  be  used  to  change  certain 
thought or behavior.

This  recommendation  is  based  on  2  Level  4  studies.  In  a 
small case series85 involving 10 patients with nightmares treat-
ed with hypnosis, 71% had improvement or were symptom-free 
at  18  months  and  67%  at  5-year  follow-up. Another  Level  4 
case  series86  involving  3  subjects  showed  that  brief  hypnotic 
therapy of 1 to 5 sessions were found to be beneficial for repeti-
tive nightmares.

4.2.4 Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing 
(EMDR) may be considered for treatment of PTSD-associated 
nightmares. Level C

Eye  Movement  Desensitization  and  Reprocessing  (EMDR) 
is a specialized psychotherapeutic intervention integrating ele-
ments from psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, 
experiential, and body-centered therapies.87,88 The principle is to 
induce the processing of disturbing memories and experiences 
by stimulating neural mechanisms that are similar to those ac-
tivated  during  REM  sleep.  An  8-phase  approach  is  employed 

Practice Guide for the Treatment of Nightmare Disorder

using bilateral eye movements, tones, and taps to identify and 
process the disturbed memory and past experience, current trig-
gers, and positive experiences to formulate insight and adaptive 
behavior in patients suffering from traumatic experience.

This recommendation is based on 2 Level 4 studies89,90 ad-
dressing its efficacy in treating nightmares. A case series90 of 83 
veterans with PTSD (including nightmares) compared EMDR 
with Relaxation training and Biofeedback at initial evaluation, 
hospital admission at 2 months or later, and 90 days after ad-
mission. This was an in-house program evaluation study (con-
ducted at a VA-hospital-based inpatient PTSD program) rather 
than an experiment and was based on patient self-report. The 
EMDR subjects did better than controls and the other 2 treat-
ment groups in all variables including nightmares (p < 0.01). 
The  second  cohort  study89  reported  on  7  subjects  who  had 
nightmares and PTSD symptoms for at least 3 months after be-
ing assaulted or kidnapped. They were treated with 5 EMDR 
sessions.  EMDR  improved  PTSD  symptoms  and  quality  of 
sleep.  This  study  did  not  specifically  address  the  quality  and 
frequency of nightmares in these patients, but addressed recur-
rent nightmares as part of sleep quality which showed improve-
ment (p = 0.003).

4.2.5 The Testimony method may be considered for treatment 
of PTSD-associated nightmares. Level C

The Testimony method is a brief variant of a trauma expo-
sure  technique.  Trauma  survivors  are  invited  to  tell  the  story 
of their traumatic experiences and document them in a written 
format with the help of the therapist.

In a Level 3 case-control trial91 in a community setting, 206 
Mozambican  civil  war  survivors  were  sorted  into  a  case  and 
a  non-case  group.  The  case  group  of  137  subjects  was  ran-
domized  to  an  intervention  group  and  a  control  group.  One 
60-minute  session  of  Testimony  intervention  was  performed 
with each subject, although 7 cases required a second session. 
The nightmare impact (NITE) scores indicated significant re-
duction in anxiety dreams (p < 0.01) at post-intervention and 
11-month  follow-up. Although  this  study  was  designed  as  a 
case-control study, the local circumstances interfered with the 
design, especially with controlling the intervention in a small 
rural community. 

4.2.6 No recommendation is made regarding Individual 
Psychotherapy because of sparse data.

Individual  psychotherapy  refers  to  a  treatment  intervention 
between a patient and a therapist, who is usually a psychiatrist, 
psychologist, or an individual with specialized training in psy-
chotherapeutic techniques such as therapeutic alliance, psycho-
analysis, etc. The therapy may focus on issues that are current or 
in the past along with associated thoughts, experiences, behav-
iors, and interactions and their role in the patient’s life.

This assessment is based on a single Level 4 case series92 of 
3 veterans with PTSD and recurrent nightmares who responded 
well to individual psychotherapy. The therapeutic principle fo-
cused on understanding of the individual’s war experiences and 
how  they  were  represented  in  each  individual’s  postwar  life. 
The  literature  describes  high-level  effectiveness  of  this  treat-
ment modality in case reports and descriptive treatment proto-
cols. RCTs and comparative studies are unavailable.

5.0 AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

There  is  a  wealth  of  data  about  pharmacological  and  be-
havioral interventions for the treatment of nightmare disorder, 
yet a great majority of the research focuses on management of 
individual  patients  and  case  reports. Thus,  there  is  paucity  of 
research  with  randomized  controlled  trials  and  Level  1  stud-
ies.  In  addition,  consistency  in  nightmare  metrics  would  im-
prove the ability to compare results among trials. There is also a 
need for investigations to determine if different approaches are 
necessary  for  idiopathic  versus  PTSD-associated  nightmares. 
Emphasis  should  be  placed  on  trials  directly  comparing  vari-
ous pharmacotherapy and behavioral techniques, combination 
treatments with medication and psychotherapy, and duplication 
and verification of results on a broader scale involving multi-
center or registry approaches. 

FOOTNOTE FROM PAGE 395

This refers to a group of people in the waiting list scheduled 
to get the intervention in the future, who serve as the control 
group  while  the  active  group  receives  the  intervention.  This 
method  is  usually  used  in  psychotherapeutic  outcome  trials. 
Usually  everyone  receives  the  intervention  by  the  end  of  the 
study.

Practice Guide for the Treatment of Nightmare Disorder

Appendix Box 1

Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  [CBT]:  is  a  psychotherapeutic  approach 
that  focuses  on  distorted/dysfunctional  thoughts,  emotions,  and  behavior 
through a goal oriented, structured and time limited procedure. CBT is often 
used  as  an  umbrella  term  for  a  number  of  psychological  and  behavioral 
techniques tailored to uncover, alter, and correct distortions of cognition and 
behavior in an individual. CBT includes Image Rehearsal Therapy; Systemic 
Desensitization;  Lucid  Dreaming  Therapy;  Sleep  Dynamic  Therapy; 
Exposure, Relaxation and Rescripting Therapy; and Self-exposure Therapy.

Imagery Rehearsal Therapy [IRT] (Recommended) Level A: is a modified 
CBT technique that utilizes recalling the nightmare, writing it down, changing 
the theme, story line, ending or any part of the dream to a more positive one, 
and rehearsing the rewritten dream scenario so that the patient can displace 
the unwanted ending when the dream recurs. IRT acts to inhibit the original 
nightmare,  providing  a  cognitive  shift  that  empirically  refutes  the  original 
premise of the nightmare. This technique is practiced for 10-20 minutes per 
day while awake.

Lucid Dreaming Therapy (May be Considered) Level C: is a cognitive 
restructuring  technique  and  a  variant  of  IRT  that  allows  one  to  alter  the 
nightmare  story  line  during  the  nightmare  itself  by  realizing  that  one  is 
dreaming or being “lucid” during the nightmare. 

Exposure,  Relaxation  and  Rescripting  Therapy  [ERRT]  (May  be 
Considered) Level C: is a specialized treatment modality targeting anxiety, 
which may manifest as physiological, behavioral and cognitive dysfunction. 
The  treatment  involves  psychoeducation,  sleep  hygiene,  and  progressive 
muscle  relaxation  training.  Exposure  procedures  such  as  writing  out  and 
rescripting the nightmares, homework assignments, problem solving, and 
coping strategies are intended to help deal with the nightmares. This form of 
treatment is similar to IRT except for type of exposure utilized.

Sleep Dynamic Therapy (May be Considered) Level C: is an integrated 
program combining standard clinical sleep medicine instructions including 
sleep quality and sleep hygiene with psychotherapeutic interventions using 
principles of cognitive behavioral therapy like stimulus control, IRT, etc.

Self-exposure Therapy (May be Considered) Level C: is a variant of CBT 
that utilizes a technique of “graded exposure.” The patient is instructed to 
make  a  hierarchy  list  based  of  the  severity  of  anxiety  provoking  events/
dreams. The patient is then instructed to move through the situations on the 

hierarchy at his or her own rate, starting with lowest anxiety situation on the 
list until the fear/anxiety has decreased. The exposure is done on a daily 
basis with documentation in a journal of his or her experiences.

Systematic Desensitization (Suggested) Level B: is a type of behavioral 
therapy that uses the principle of gradually exposing the patient to what he 
or she fears. This technique is also called “graduated exposure therapy.” 
The patient is trained to cope and manage the stressors gradually before 
the patient is actually exposed to the feared object or situation.

Progressive  Deep  Muscle  Relaxation  [PDMR]  (Suggested)  Level  B: 
involves tensing and releasing the muscles, one body part at a time, to bring 
about a feeling of physical relaxation and reduction in anxiety and stress.

Hypnosis or Hypnotherapy (May be Considered) Level C: is a trance-
like state of mind. Hypnosis creates a state of deep relaxation which helps 
the mind to concentrate intensely on a specific thought, memory, feeling, or 
sensation without distractions and making the person open to suggestions 
that can be used to change certain thought or behavior.

Eye  Movement  Desensitization  and  Reprocessing  [EMDR]  (May  be 
Considered) Level C: is a specialized treatment modality targeting anxiety, 
which may manifest as physiological, behavioral and cognitive dysfunction. 
The treatment involves psycho-education, sleep hygiene and progressive 
muscle  relaxation  training.  Exposure  procedures  such  as  writing  out  and 
rescripting the nightmares, home work assignments, problem solving, and 
coping strategies are intended to help deal with the nightmares. This form of 
treatment is similar to IRT except for type of exposure utilized.

The Testimony Method (May be Considered) Level C: is a brief variant of 
a trauma exposure technique. Trauma survivors are invited to tell the story 
of their traumatic experiences and document them in a written format with 
the help of the therapist.

Individual Psychotherapy (No recommendation): refers to a treatment 
intervention between a patient and a therapist, who is usually a psychiatrist, 
psychologist or an individual with specialized training in psychotherapeutic 
techniques such as therapeutic alliance, psychoanalysis etc. The therapy 
may focus on issues that are current or in the past along with associated 
thoughts,  experiences,  behaviors,  and  interactions  and  their  role  in  the 
patient’s life.
