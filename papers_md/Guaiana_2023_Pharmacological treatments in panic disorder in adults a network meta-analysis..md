Background

A B S T R A C T

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes. The main symptoms involve
bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness and breathlessness.
Other recognised panic attack symptoms involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (the
sensation that the world is unreal). Panic disorder is common in the general population with a prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of
panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

Objectives

To  compare,  via  network  meta-analysis,  individual  drugs  (antidepressants  and  benzodiazepines)  or  placebo  in  terms  of  efficacy  and
acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.

To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and
acceptability.

To  rank  drug  classes  for  panic  disorder  (selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs),  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors
(SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and benzodiazepines (BDZs) and placebo) according to
their effectiveness and acceptability.

To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis.

Search methods

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, CENTRAL, CDSR, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and PsycINFO to 26
May 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people aged 18 years or older of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed
panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. We included trials that compared the effectiveness of antidepressants and benzodiazepines
with each other or with a placebo.

Data collection and analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous
data and continuous data as risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD): response to treatment (i.e.
substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), total number of dropouts due
to any reason (as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability: dichotomous outcome), remission (i.e. satisfactory end state as defined
by  global  judgement  of  the  original  investigators:  dichotomous  outcome),  panic  symptom  scales  and  global  judgement  (continuous
outcome),  frequency  of  panic  attacks  (as  recorded,  for  example,  by  a  panic  diary;  continuous  outcome),  agoraphobia  (dichotomous
outcome). We assessed the certainty of evidence using threshold analyses.

Main results

Overall, we included 70 trials in this review. Sample sizes ranged between 5 and 445 participants in each arm, and the total sample size per
study ranged from 10 to 1168. Thirty-five studies included sample sizes of over 100 participants.

There is evidence from 48 RCTs (N = 10,118) that most medications are more effective in the response outcome than placebo. In particular,
diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam showed the strongest effect, with
diazepam,  alprazolam  and  clonazepam  ranking  as  the  most  effective.  We  found  heterogeneity  in  most  of  the  comparisons,  but  our
threshold analyses suggest that this is unlikely to impact the findings of the network meta-analysis.

Results from 64 RCTs (N = 12,310) suggest that most medications are associated with either a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to placebo.
Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower dropout rate compared to placebo and were ranked as the most tolerated of all
the medications examined.

Thirty-two  RCTs  (N  =  8569)  were  included  in  the  remission  outcome.  Most  medications  were  more  effective  than  placebo,  namely
desipramine, fluoxetine, clonazepam, diazepam, fluvoxamine, imipramine, venlafaxine and paroxetine, and their effects were clinically
meaningful. Amongst these medications, desipramine and alprazolam were ranked highest.

Thirty-five  RCTs  (N  =  8826)  are  included  in  the  continuous  outcome  reduction  in  panic  scale  scores.  Brofaromine,  clonazepam  and
reboxetine had the strongest reductions in panic symptoms compared to placebo, but results were based on either one trial or very small
trials.

Forty-one  RCTs  (N  =  7853)  are  included  in  the  frequency  of  panic  attack  outcome.  Only  clonazepam  and  alprazolam  showed  a  strong
reduction in the frequency of panic attacks compared to placebo, and were ranked highest.

Twenty-six RCTs (N = 7044) provided data for agoraphobia. The strongest reductions in agoraphobia symptoms were found for citalopram,
reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam, compared to placebo.

For the pooled intervention classes, we examined the two primary outcomes (response and dropout). The classes of medication were:
SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs.

For the response outcome, all classes of medications examined were more effective than placebo. TCAs as a class ranked as the most
effective, followed by BDZs and MAOIs. SSRIs as a class ranked fifth on average, while SNRIs were ranked lowest. When we compared classes
of medication with each other for the response outcome, we found no difference between classes. Comparisons between MAOIs and TCAs
and between BDZs and TCAs also suggested no differences between these medications, but the results were imprecise.

For the dropout outcome, BDZs were the only class associated with a lower dropout compared to placebo and were ranked first in terms
of tolerability. The other classes did not show any difference in dropouts compared to placebo. In terms of ranking, TCAs are on average
second to BDZs, followed by SNRIs, then by SSRIs and lastly by MAOIs. BDZs were associated with lower dropout rates compared to SSRIs,
SNRIs and TCAs.

The quality of the studies comparing antidepressants with placebo was moderate, while the quality of the studies comparing BDZs with
placebo and antidepressants was low.

Authors' conclusions

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

In terms of efficacy, SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine), TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs may be effective, with little difference between classes. However, it
is important to note that the reliability of these findings may be limited due to the overall low quality of the studies, with all having unclear
or high risk of bias across multiple domains. Within classes, some differences emerged. For example, amongst the SSRIs paroxetine and
fluoxetine seem to have stronger evidence of efficacy than sertraline. Benzodiazepines appear to have a small but significant advantage
in terms of tolerability (incidence of dropouts) over other classes.

Pharmacological treatments in panic disorder in adults: a network meta-analysis

Why is this review important?

People with panic disorder are profoundly impacted by this condition, often experiencing challenges with work, education and social or
family life. We wanted to evaluate which medications, if any, are the most effective and safe. In particular, we aimed to assess whether
the network meta-analysis findings were valid enough to identify the best medications, in order to improve care. These analyses have also
generated suggestions for future research to reduce key uncertainties in the evidence.

Who will be interested in this research?

The research in this Cochrane Review will interest:

- people who decide policy, and influence decisions about the prescription of medications for panic disorder;

- people who prescribe these medicines to people with panic disorder;

- people with panic disorder;

- those who support and care for them.

What did we want to find out?

We wanted to find out how well antidepressants, benzodiazepines and azapirones work to improve panic disorder symptoms in adults
(i.e. people aged 18 years or older).

We wanted to know how these medications affect:

- the symptoms of panic disorder;

- dropout from studies, as a measure of the side effects of medication;

- recovery: no longer meeting the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder;

- response or remission: scores on a scale indicating an important reduction in panic or no longer experiencing panic;

- reduction in the frequency of panic attacks;

- reduction in agoraphobia (fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help would not be available if things go wrong).

What did we do?

We searched electronic databases and study registers to find all relevant studies. We only included randomised controlled trials (a type of
study in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) that compared treatment with antidepressants,
benzodiazepines, azapirones and placebo in adults with a diagnosis of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. We only included
studies in which the patients and clinicians did not know which treatment they received. We included 70 studies in our review with a total
of 12,703 participants. The date of our search was 26 May 2022.

What does the evidence from the review tell us?

- We found that most medications may be more effective in the response outcome than placebo. In particular, diazepam, alprazolam,
clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam showed the strongest effect. Also, most medications were
either associated with a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to placebo. Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower dropout
rate than placebo and were ranked as the most tolerated of all the medications examined.

-  Most  medications  may  have  been  more  effective  than  placebo  in  remitting  the  symptoms  of  panic  disorder  and  their  effects  were
clinically meaningful. In terms of the reduction in panic scale scores, brofaromine, clonazepam and reboxetine seem to have the strongest

reductions in panic symptoms compared to placebo, but the results were based on either one trial or very small trials. For the frequency
of panic attacks outcome, only clonazepam and alprazolam showed a strong reduction in the frequency of attacks compared to placebo.
The strongest reductions in agoraphobia symptoms were found for citalopram, reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam,
compared to placebo.

- If we consider the classes of medications together (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors  (SNRIs),  tricyclic  antidepressants  (TCAs),  mono-amine  oxidase  inhibitors  (MAOIs)  and  benzodiazepines),  all  classes  of
medications examined were more effective than placebo. TCAs as a class ranked as the most effective, followed by benzodiazepines and
MAOIs. SSRIs as a class ranked fifth on average, while SNRIs were ranked as the lowest.

- If classes of medication are compared with each other for the response outcome, no difference is found between classes. For the dropout
outcome, benzodiazepines were the only class associated with a lower dropout than placebo, and they were ranked as first in terms of
tolerability. The other classes did not show any difference in dropouts compared to placebo.

- It is important to note that, while the quality of the studies comparing antidepressants with placebo was acceptable, the quality of the
studies comparing benzodiazepines with placebo and antidepressants was low. This may limit the certainty of our results.

- Our review has limitations as it is based on short-term studies.

What should happen next?

- Almost all the studies examined in this network meta-analysis were of short duration. For benzodiazepines, there has been considerable
debate about whether they can be used in the long term given their propensity for abuse and the possible risk of tolerance. More research
on their long-term effects (i.e. longer than eight weeks and maybe up to one year) is needed.

-  It  will  be  important  to  systematically  assess  the  efficacy  of  medications  compared  to  talking  therapies,  perhaps  in  a  network  meta-
analysis. Data for depression seem to show that psychotherapies can lead to a more sustained effect. The same may apply to anxiety
disorders in general and panic disorder in particular and this needs to be investigated.

Description of the condition

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid
onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes (APA 2013a). The main
symptoms involve bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain,
sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness
and  breathlessness.  Other  recognised  panic  attack  symptoms
involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad
or dying, and derealisation (sensation that the world is unreal) (APA
2013a).

Panic  disorder  first  entered  diagnostic  classification  systems  in
1980 with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of  Mental  Disorders  -  3rd  edition  (DSM-III),  following  observations
that  patients  with  panic  attacks  responded  to  treatment  with
imipramine, which is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) (Klein 1964).
To diagnose panic disorder, further conditions must be met relating
to the frequency of attacks, the need for some attacks to come on
‘out of the blue’ rather than in a predictable, externally triggered
situation,  and  exclusions  where  attacks  are  attributable  solely  to
medical  causes  or  panic-inducing  substances,  notably  caffeine.
DSM-IV  also  requires  that  at  least  one  attack  has  been  followed
by: a) persistent concern about having additional attacks; b) worry
about  the  implications  of  the  attack  or  its  consequences;  or  c)  a
significant change in behaviour related to the attacks (APA 1994).
The core features of panic attacks remained unchanged in DSM-5
(APA 2013a), but in DSM-5 panic disorder and agoraphobia are no
longer linked and are now coded as two diagnoses (APA 2013b).

Panic  disorder  is  common  in  the  general  population;  it  occurs  in
1%  to  4%  of  people  (lifetime  prevalence)  (Bijl  1998;  Eaton  1994;
Kessler  2012).  In  primary  care  settings,  panic  has  been  reported
to  have  a  prevalence  of  around  10%  (King  2008).  This  is  because
common  mental  disorders  are  more  often  dealt  with  in  primary
care  (King  2008).  Women  and  previously  married  people  have
consistently elevated odds of panic (Kessler 2006). There seems to
be some weak association between unemployment and retirement
and the likelihood of suffering from panic disorder (Kessler 2006).
Its  cause  is  not  fully  understood  and  there  are  probably  several
reasons why panic occurs. Biological theories incorporate the faulty
triggering  of  an  inbuilt  anxiety  response,  possibly  a  suffocation
alarm.  Evidence  for  this  comes  from  biological  challenge  tests
(lactate and carbon dioxide trigger panic in those with the disorder)
and from animal experiments and neuroimaging studies in humans
that  show  activation  of  fear  circuits  in  the  brain,  such  as  that
involving  a  part  of  the  brain  called  periaqueductal  grey  matter
(Gorman 2000).

About  one-quarter  of  people  with  panic  disorder  also  have
agoraphobia  (Kessler  2006).  Agoraphobia  is  defined  as  anxiety
about  being  in  places  or  situations  from  which  escape  might  be
difficult  or  embarrassing,  or  in  which  help  may  not  be  available
in  the  event  of  having  a  panic  attack  (APA  2013a).  The  presence
of  agoraphobia  is  associated  with  increased  severity  and  worse
outcome (Kessler 2006). There are several risk factors that predict
the  development  of  agoraphobia  in  people  with  panic  disorder:
female  gender,  more  intense  dizziness  during  a  panic  attack,
cognitive  factors,  dependent  personality  traits  and  social  anxiety
disorder (Starcevic 2009).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Panic  disorder,  with  or  without  agoraphobia,  co-occurs  very
frequently  with  other  psychiatric  disorders,  such  as  drug
dependence,  major  depression,  bipolar  I  disorder,  social  phobia,
specific  phobia  and  generalised  anxiety  disorder  (Grant  2006).  It
is estimated that generalised anxiety disorder co-occurs in 68% of
people with panic disorder, whilst 24% to 88% of people with panic
disorder have major depression (Starcevic 2009).

Description of the intervention

includes  psychological  and  pharmacological
panic  disorder 
interventions,  often  used 
in  combination  (Furukawa  2007;
Watanabe  2009).  The  main  pharmacological  treatments  used  in
panic  disorder  are  antidepressants  and  benzodiazepines  (BDZs).
Azapirones,  gabapentinoids,  anticonvulsants,  beta-blockers  and
inositol have also been studied but are not a focus of this review.

treatment 

The 

Historically, pharmacological interventions for panic disorder have
been  based  on  the  use  of  older  antidepressants,  such  as  mono-
amine  oxidase  inhibitors  (MAOIs)  and  tricyclic  antidepressants
(TCAs)  (Bruce  2003).  MAOIs  and  TCAs  are,  however,  burdened
by  severe  adverse  effects,  such  as  dietary  restrictions  (to  avoid
hypertensive  crisis)  for  MAOIs,  and  anticholinergic  (e.g.  memory
problems  and  confusion)  and  arrhythmogenic  (heart  rhythm
problems)  effects,  and  overall  poor  tolerability  for  TCAs  (Wade
1999).  Benzodiazepines  (BDZs),  particularly  high-potency  ones,
have  been  used  as  a  safer  alternative  in  panic  disorder  (Stein
2010),  although  they  may  work  less  effectively  in  the  long  term
(NICE 2011). Recent guidelines, for example APA 2009, NICE 2011,
BAP  2014  and  Katzman  2014,  consider  newer  antidepressants,
such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the
serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, as first-line
treatment for panic disorder, due in part to their more favourable
adverse effect profile over the older antidepressant groups (MAOIs
and  TCAs).  A  meta-analysis  comparing  SSRIs  and  TCAs  in  panic
disorder showed that SSRIs are as effective as TCAs, and are better
tolerated (Bakker 2002), although other studies showed a possible
overestimation of the efficacy of SSRIs over older antidepressants
in panic disorder (Anderson 2000; Otto 2001).

BDZs  have  a  higher  incidence  of  dependence  and  withdrawal
reaction  when  compared  to  antidepressants  (Wade  1999),  and
they  may  not  be  effective  in  treating  panic  disorder  that  occurs
together with depression (Ballenger 1998). In spite of these caveats,
it  appears  that  BDZs  continue  to  be  widely  prescribed  for  the
treatment of panic disorder (Bruce 2003).

How the intervention might work

Antidepressant  drugs  augment  the  function  of  the  monoamines
serotonin and noradrenaline. Serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs)
promote the transmission of the neurotransmitter serotonin across
brain  synapses.  They  most  notably  do  it  in  the  part  of  the
brain called the dorsal raphe nucleus (Briley 1993). They prevent
reuptake of serotonin into nerve terminals by inhibiting serotonin
transporters,  thus  allowing  more  serotonin  to  be  available
for  neurotransmission.  In  panic  disorder,  imaging  studies  have
revealed reduced expression of the 5H1A serotonin receptor (Nash
2008), which has an inhibitory function, so the increased serotonin
throughput may in part serve to overcome this deficit of inhibition.
Noradrenergic antidepressants can similarly increase transmission

of the catecholamine noradrenaline. Some antidepressants, such
as  the  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI)  drugs
(e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine) and TCAs, can enhance both serotonin
and noradrenaline transmission by inhibiting both transporters.

BDZs  moderate 
neurotransmitter  system,  which  is  the  brain’s  main  inhibitory
neurotransmitter.  They  activate  the  GABA-A  BDZ  receptor.  This
receptor  complex  contains  a  chloride  channel,  opened  by
agonists,  which  ultimately  reduces  anxiety  and  creates  sedation.
The  BDZ  binding  site  communicates  only  indirectly  with  the
channel,  meaning  that  BDZs  are  safer  than  their  predecessors,
the  barbiturates.  It  is  known  through  imaging  studies  that  the
inhibitory  GABA  system  is  deficient  in  panic  disorder  (Cameron
2007; Malizia 1998), thus the ability of BDZs to activate the GABA-A
BDZ receptor can counteract this. It is likely that both monoamine-
based systems and GABA-based systems converge, allowing both
antidepressants and BDZs to have efficacy in panic disorder despite
their differing actions on neurotransmitter systems. One possibility
is via serotonergic neurones that modulate GABA input to the part
of the brain called periaqueductal grey matter.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Why it is important to do this review

Types of studies

People  with  panic  disorder  are  profoundly  impacted  by  this
condition  often  experiencing  challenges  engaging  with  work,
education  and  social  or  family  life.  These  challenges  not  only
impact people with panic disorder but also have substantial social
and economic costs (Batelaan 2007). A recent German study found
that  60%  of  societal  costs  associated  with  panic  disorder  were
due to productivity losses and absences from work (Brettschneider
2019). Therefore further information on the safety and effectiveness
of pharmacological interventions has the potential to benefit both
people with panic disorder and society.

Pharmacological  treatments  are  widely  used  in  clinical  practice
to  treat  panic  disorder.  To  our  knowledge,  the  last  meta-analysis
specifically  focused  on  benzodiazepines  for  panic  disorder  was
published in 1991 (Wilkinson 1991), and the last two meta-analyses
focusing  on  antidepressants  for  this  condition  were  published
more  than  10  years  ago  and  seven  years  ago  (Bakker  2002  and
Andrisano  2013,  respectively).  Standard  pair-wise  meta-analyses
of  psychopharmacological  interventions  in  panic  disorder  have
been  published  within  Cochrane  (Bighelli  2016;  Bighelli  2018;
Breilmann 2019; Imai 2014). Other reviews have been published on
combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in panic disorder
(Furukawa 2007; Watanabe 2009). However, given the complexity of
the condition, it is very important to carry out a comprehensive and
comparative  evaluation  of  the  main  pharmacological  treatment
options  within  the  framework  of  a  network  meta-analysis  (NMA).
NMAs  produce  estimates  of  the  relative  effects  between  any  pair
of  interventions  in  the  network,  and  usually  yield  more  precise
estimates than a single direct or indirect estimate (Higgins 2019).

We  wanted  to  evaluate  which  treatments,  if  any,  are  the  most
effective  and  safe.  In  particular,  we  aimed  to  assess  whether
the  NMA  findings  are  of  sufficient  validity  to  help  patients,
mental  health  professionals  and  policymakers  identify  the  best
pharmacological treatments for panic disorder, in order to improve
clinical  practice  and  patient  care.  These  analyses  also  generate
suggestions for future research to reduce key uncertainties in the
evidence base.

We  included  double-blind  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  of
the included drugs (see Types of interventions), either compared to
one another or to placebo, in the acute treatment of panic disorder.
We excluded trials in which drugs were used as an augmentation
strategy  for  any  other  psychotropic  drugs.  For  trials  that  had
a  cross-over  design,  we  only  considered  results  from  the  first
randomisation  period.  Cluster-randomised  trials  were  included
only if intracluster correlation coefficients were reported. If a study
was  reported  as  double-blind,  we  included  it;  any  risk  of  bias
associated with implementing this procedure informed our risk of
bias assessment.

We excluded the following:

• Relapse prevention trials.
• Studies  in  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  panic  disorder  where
the  effects  of  treatments  were  measured  after  panic  attacks
had been induced (for example with CO2 inhalations or lactate
infusions).

• Studies  concurrently  administering  psychosocial  therapies

targeted at panic disorder.

• Studies comparing psychosocial interventions.
• Quasi-randomised trials.

Types of participants

The  fundamental  assumption  underpinning  a  network  meta-
analysis is that of consistency/transitivity (Caldwell 2005; Cipriani
2013). We assumed that any patient who met the inclusion criteria
below was, in principle, equally likely to have been randomised to
any  of  the  eligible  interventions  examined  in  this  review,  that  is,
that they are 'jointly randomisable' (Salanti 2012).

Participant characteristics

People aged 18 or older, of either sex, with a primary diagnosis of
panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis was according to any of the following criteria: DSM-III-R;
DSM-IV or the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition
(ICD-10); DSM-5. We did not include studies using operationalised
criteria  before  DSM-III  because  their  conceptualisation  of  panic
disorder is substantively different.

Comorbidities

When  the  study  eligibility  focused  on  agoraphobia  rather  than
panic disorder, and was operationally diagnosed according to the
above-named  criteria,  and  when  we  could  safely  assume  that  at
least some of the patients experienced panic disorder as defined
by  the  above  criteria,  we  included  the  study.  Considering  that
over  95%  of  patients  with  agoraphobia  seen  clinically  also  suffer
from  panic  disorder  (Goisman  1995),  we  planned  to  investigate
the effect of their inclusion in a subgroup analysis. However, this
subgroup analysis was not possible as all studies included people
with agoraphobia.

We  excluded  trials  in  which  all  participants  had  a  concurrent
primary  diagnosis  of  any  psychiatric  disorder  other  than  panic
disorder  or  agoraphobia  when  the  focus  was  not  the  treatment
of  panic  disorder.  We  excluded  trials  in  which  participants  had  a
serious concomitant medical illness.

Setting

Inpatient, outpatient and primary care.

Subset data

We did not include trials that provided data on a relevant subset of
their participants (e.g. a study that included a subset of participants
meeting the criteria for panic disorder).

Types of interventions

We  only  included  studies  where  medications  were  used  at  a
therapeutic  dosage.  We  defined  therapeutic  doses  as  doses  that
are  indicated  for  panic  disorder  by  any  of  the  North  American,
European  or  Japanese  regulatory  agencies.  Where  such  were
not  available,  we  followed  the  same  dose  ranges  as  for  major
depression (for antidepressants) and generalised anxiety disorder
(for benzodiazepines).

placebo.  This  could  be  a  potential  source  of  heterogeneity  or
inconsistency (or both).

Types of outcome measures

We included studies that met the above inclusion criteria regardless
of whether they reported on the following primary and secondary
outcomes, which were pre-defined at the protocol stage (Guaiana
2020). We chose continuous and dichotomous data as they provide
complementary data.

Primary outcomes

• Response  to  treatment  (i.e.  substantial  improvement  from
baseline  as  defined  by  the  original  investigators).  We  used
the  following  definitions  of  response:  “much  or  very  much
improved” according to the Clinical Global Impression Change
Scale;  more  than  40%  reduction 
in  the  Panic  Disorder
Severity  Scale  score;  or  more  than  50%  reduction  in  the  Fear
Questionnaire Agoraphobia Subscale. When multiple measures
were used, we gave preference to the most global measure.
• Total number of dropouts due to any reason (as a proxy measure

of treatment acceptability).

Secondary outcomes

according to the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale. When
multiple measures were used, we gave preference to the most
global measure.

Scale (1 to 7) and Clinical Global Impression Change Scale (1 to
7).

• Frequency  of  panic  attacks  per  unit  of  time  (ex.  days,  weeks,

months..., as recorded, for example, by a panic diary).

• Agoraphobia symptom (as measured, for example, by the Fear
Questionnaire,  Mobility  Inventory  or  behavioural  avoidance
test).

When  more  than  one  scale  was  available  in  the  paper,  we  gave
preference in the following order:

• Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) > Panic and Agoraphobia
Scale (PAS) > Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised (ASI-R) > Anxiety
Sensitivity Index (ASI) > Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQ) >
Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ) > other scales specific for

only.

-  Global 

• Panic frequency > panic severity > other scales specific for panic

attacks only.

Once  the  scale  was  chosen,  if  both  self-  and  observer-rated
assessments were available, we gave preference to the latter. The
actual measure entered into the meta-analysis is indicated at the
top of the listings in Characteristics of included studies.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Ovid MEDLINE databases (2014 to 26 May 2022) (Appendix 2);
• Ovid Embase (2014 to May Week 2 2022);
• Ovid PsycINFO (2014 to May Week 2 2022).

We  searched  the  trial  registers  ClinicalTrials.gov  and  the  World
Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
(apps.who.int/trialsearch)  via  CCMDCTR  and  CENTRAL  in  the
Cochrane Library.

We applied date restrictions to the searches of MEDLINE, Embase,
PsycINFO  and  CENTRAL  for  the  following  reason:  Cochrane
Common  Mental  Disorders  relocated  to  the  University  of  York
in  2016  and  the  group's  Specialised  Register  (which  previously
included RCTs from these databases) fell out of date at this time. We
conducted the additional searches to account for this period from
2014 onwards.

We applied no further restrictions on date, language or publication
status to the searches.

Searching other resources

Two  review  authors  independently  checked  the  reference  lists  of
all included studies, non-Cochrane systematic reviews and major
textbooks of affective disorders (written in English), for published
reports and citations of unpublished research. We also conducted
a citation search via the Web of Science (included studies only) to
identify additional works. We also contacted experts in the field.

Data collection and analysis

For  details  about  who  performed  the  original  systematic  review
tasks among the authors please see Bighelli 2016, Bighelli 2018 and
Breilmann 2019.

Timing of outcome assessment

Selection of studies

All  outcomes  were  short  term:  we  defined  this  as  acute-phase
treatment, which normally lasted two to six months. When studies
reported more response rates at different time points within two to
six months, we gave preference to the time point closest to three
months (i.e. 12 weeks).

Hierarchy of outcome measures

When  several  possible  outcome  measures  were  reported  for  the
same  outcome,  we  used  the  primary  outcome  according  to  the
original study.

Search methods for identification of studies

Trials  that  included  at  least  two  of  the  interventions  were
eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  review.  We  searched  for  all  possible
comparisons  formed  by  the  interventions  of  interest,  as  defined
above.

Electronic searches

We  searched  the  following  databases  using  relevant  subject
headings (controlled vocabulary) and search syntax appropriate to
each resource (all years to 26 May 2022).

• Cochrane  Common  Mental  Disorders  Specialised  Register

(CCMDCTR) (all available years) (Appendix 1);

• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2022,

Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library;

At least two review authors independently screened the titles and
abstracts  of  all  studies  we  identified  as  a  result  of  the  search
and  coded  them  as  'retrieve'  (eligible  or  potentially  eligible/
unclear) or 'do not retrieve'. We retrieved the full-text study reports/
publications  and  two  review  authors  independently  screened
them and identified studies for inclusion; they also identified and
recorded reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies.

The  two  review  authors  resolved  any  disagreement  through
discussion  or,  when  required,  through  consultation  with  a  third
member of the review team. We identified and excluded duplicate
records and collated multiple reports related to the same study so
that  each  study  rather  than  each  report  is  the  unit  of  interest  in
the review. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to
complete a PRISMA flow diagram and a Characteristics of excluded
studies table (Moher 2009).

Data extraction and management

We  used  a  data  collection  form,  piloted  on  at  least  one  study  in
the review, to extract study characteristics and outcome data. Two
authors from the review team extracted study characteristics and
outcome data from the included studies.

From  each  included  study  we  extracted  data  on  the  following
study, intervention and population characteristics that may act as
possible effect modifiers.

• Methods:  study  design,  randomisation  (individual  or  cluster),
total duration of study, number of study centres and location,
study setting, withdrawals and date of study.

• Participants: number, setting, sex, diagnostic criteria, presence
or absence of medical and psychiatric co-morbidities, presence
or absence of elderly participants, percentage of patients with
agoraphobia, percentage of patients with baseline depression,
inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

• Interventions: medication dose, medication dose range, use of

rescue medication.

• Outcomes:  primary  and  secondary  outcomes  specified  and
collected,  and  time  points  reported.  Where  possible,  we
extracted data at the arm level, not summary effects.

• Notes:  sponsorship/funding  for  trial,  and  notable  conflicts  of

interest of trial authors.

We compiled a table of important trial and patient characteristics
and visually inspected the similarity of factors we considered likely
to modify treatment effect.

We noted in the Characteristics of included studies table if outcome
data were not reported in a usable way. We resolved disagreements
through  consensus  or  by  involving  a  third  person.  One  review
author  transferred  data  into  Review  Manager  5  (Review  Manager
2014), WinBUGS or OpenBUGS software. We double-checked that
data were entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the
systematic review with the study reports. A second review author
spot-checked  study  characteristics  for  accuracy  against  the  trial
report.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

To assess risk of bias in RCTs, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool
(Higgins 2011).

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each
included study. We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by
involving another author.

For each trial, we assessed the following domains:

• sequence generation;
• allocation concealment;
• blinding of participants and personnel;
• blinding of outcome assessors;
• incomplete outcome data;
• selective reporting.

We  judged  each  domain  as  being  at  a  low,  high  or  unclear  risk
of  bias.  We  also  extracted  relevant  text  that  underpinned  our
judgement and presented this in the risk of bias tables.

We  decided  to  include  sponsorship  bias  because  of  the  high
number  of  sponsored  studies.  Scientific  literature  on  depression
shows some level of sponsorship bias (Cristea 2017), which may be
applicable to anxiety.

Measures of treatment effect

Dichotomous data

For  binary  outcomes,  we  estimated  the  risk  ratio  (RR)  and  its
95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. It has

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

been shown that a random-effects model has good generalisability
(Furukawa 2002), and that a RR is more intuitive than an odds ratio
(OR) (Boissel 1999). Furthermore, ORs tend to be interpreted as RRs
by clinicians (Deeks 2000). This may lead to an overestimation of
the impression of the effect (Higgins 2019).

Continuous data

(1) Summary statistics

Different  studies  used  varied  panic  rating  scales,  therefore  we
used the standardised mean difference (SMD) to pool continuous
data. We interpreted the magnitude of SMDs using standard rules
of  thumb  (Cohen  1992).  If  all  included  studies  used  the  same
instrument, we used the mean difference (MD).

(2) Endpoint versus change data

Trials  report  results  with  a  combination  of  endpoint  means  and
change  from  baseline  means  of  assessment  rating  scales.  We
preferred  to  use  endpoint  data,  which  typically  cannot  have
negative values and are easier to interpret from a clinical point of
view. If endpoint data were unavailable, we extracted the change
from  baseline  data  in  separate  analyses.  If  we  used  the  MD,  we
pooled results from change from baseline and endpoint data in the
same analysis.

Considering that clinical trials for panic disorder are usually small,
and that data distribution is difficult to assess for studies with small
samples, in this review we gave priority to the use and analysis of
dichotomous  variables  both  for  efficacy  and  acceptability.  Where
outcome data or standard deviations (SDs) were not recorded, we
asked  authors  to  supply  the  data.  When  only  the  standard  error
(SE)  or  t-statistics  or  P  values  were  reported,  we  calculated  SDs
according to Altman 1996. In the absence of data from the authors,
we  calculated  the  mean  value  of  known  SDs  from  the  group  of
included  studies  according  to  Furukawa  2006.  We  checked  that
the original SDs were properly distributed, so that the imputed SD
represented the average.

Relative treatment rankings

We estimated the mean rank (and their 95% CrIs) for all treatments.

Unit of analysis issues

Cluster-randomised trials

In  cluster-randomised  trials,  groups  of  individuals  rather  than
individuals  are  randomised  to  different  interventions.  If  we
identified  cluster  placebo-controlled  randomised  trials,  we
appropriately analysed these data by taking into account intraclass
correlation coefficients to adjust for cluster effects. Where trialists
had not adjusted for the effects of clustering, we attempted to do
this  by  obtaining  an  intracluster  correlation  coefficient  and  then
following  the  guidance  given  in  chapter  16.3.4  of  the  Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).

Cross-over trials

Cross-over trials are trials in which all participants receive both the
control  and  intervention  treatment  but  in  a  different  order.  The
major  problem  is  a  carry-over  effect  from  the  first  phase  to  the
second phase of the study, especially if the condition of interest is
unstable (Elbourne 2002). As this is the case with panic disorder, we
included randomised cross-over studies but only used data up to
the point of the first cross-over.

Studies with multiple treatment groups

Multi-arm studies where the same medication at different doses is
compared remained intact with no adjustments to the numerator
or  denominator  of  the  shared  intervention  group.  We  accounted
for the correlation between the effect sizes from multi-arm studies
using the approach suggested in Higgins 1996 and Dias 2013a.

Dose-ranging studies

We  also  included  dose-ranging  studies,  where  different  doses  of
the same medication are compared to each other, and pooled the
different  dose  arms,  considering  them  to  be  one  as  long  as  they
were within the standard range (see above).

Dealing with missing data

We tried to contact the study authors for all relevant missing data.

(1) Dichotomous outcomes

We  calculated  response,  or  remission  on  treatment,  using  an
intention-to-treat  analysis  (ITT).  We  followed  the  principle  'once
randomised,  always  analysed'.  Where  participants  left  the  study
before the intended endpoint, we assumed that they would have
experienced the negative outcome. When dichotomous outcomes
were not reported but the baseline mean and SD on a panic disorder
scale  were  reported,  we  calculated  the  number  of  responding  or
remitted participants according to a validated imputation method
(Furukawa 2005). We analysed the validity of the above approach
by  sensitivity  analysis.  If  necessary,  we  contacted  the  authors  of
studies to obtain data or clarification (or both).

(2) Continuous outcomes

Concerning continuous data, the CochraneHandbook for Systematic
Reviews  of  Interventions  recommends  avoiding  imputation  of
continuous data and suggests using the data as presented by the
original authors (Higgins 2019). Where ITT data were available, we
preferred ITT to 'per-protocol analysis'. If necessary, we contacted
the authors of studies to obtain data or clarification (or both).

(3) Skewed or qualitative data

Where  available  we  presented  skewed  and  qualitative  data
descriptively.

We  considered  several  strategies  for  skewed  data.  If  papers
reported a mean and SD and there was also an absolute minimum
possible  value  for  the  outcome,  we  divided  the  mean  by  the  SD.
If  this  was  less  than  2,  then  we  concluded  that  there  was  some
indication  of  skewness.  If  it  was  less  than  1  (that  is  the  SD  was
bigger than the mean) then there was almost certainly skewness.
If  papers  had  not  reported  the  skewness  and  simply  reported
means,  SDs  and  sample  sizes,  we  used  these  numbers.  Because
there is a possibility that these data may not have been properly
analysed, and can also be misleading, we conducted analyses with
and without these studies. If the data have been log-transformed
for  analysis,  and  the  geometric  means  are  reported,  skewness
will  be  reduced.  This  is  the  recommended  method  of  analysis  of
skewed  data  (Higgins  2019).  If  papers  used  non-parametric  tests
and described averages using medians, they could not be formally
pooled  in  the  analysis.  We  followed  the  recommendation  in  the
CochraneHandbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  that
results of these studies be reported in a table in our review, along
with all other papers (Higgins 2019). This means that the data will

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

not be lost from the review and the results can be considered when
drawing conclusions, even if they cannot be formally pooled in the
analyses.

(4) Missing statistics

When only P or SE values were reported, we calculated SDs (Altman
1996). In the absence of supplementary data after requests to the
study  authors,  we  calculated  the  SDs  according  to  a  validated
imputation method (Furukawa 2006). We examined the validity of
these imputations in the sensitivity analyses.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We  assumed  a  homogeneous  between-study  variability  across
studies  (Lu  2004).  We  based  the  statistical  assessment  of
heterogeneity  in  the  entire  network  on  the  magnitude  of  the
heterogeneity standard deviation parameter, Tau2, estimated from
the  model  and  the  95%  prediction  interval  for  the  relative
treatment effects.

Inconsistency  can  be  considered  an  additional 
layer  of
heterogeneity,  which  can  occur  in  networks  of  evidence.  It  can
occur  when  there  is  a  discrepancy  between  a  direct  and  indirect
estimate of treatment effect. We conducted node-splitting analyses
to  identify  in  greater  detail  inconsistencies  in  the  network  (van
Valkenhoef 2016). We conducted these analyses on the two primary
outcomes:  response  to  treatment  and  total  dropouts  for  any
reason.

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings
is  influenced  by  the  nature  and  direction  of  results.  These  are
described  in  Section  10  of  the  CochraneHandbook  for  Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019). We examined small-study
effects in the network, including publication bias, through network
meta-regression  (Chaimani  2012);  see  the  Sensitivity  analysis
section below for further details.

Assessment of transitivity across treatment comparisons

Transitivity  characterises  a  network  of  interventions  when  the
distributions  of  potential  effect  modifiers  (as  described  above)
are balanced across all pair-wise comparisons. Transitivity can be
interpreted  as  the  extension  of  the  clinical  and  methodological
heterogeneity across the network of different comparisons, and is
necessary to ensure a valid network meta-analysis. We evaluated
transitivity in this review as follows:

• We  assessed  whether  the  included  interventions  were  similar
when  they  were  evaluated  in  RCTs  with  different  designs;  for
example,  whether  antidepressants  were  administered  in  the
same way in studies comparing antidepressants to placebo and
in those comparing antidepressants to benzodiazepines.

• We compared the distribution of the potential effect modifiers

across the different pair-wise comparisons.

Data synthesis

We  conducted  random-effects  network  meta-analyses  (NMAs)
comparing three or more interventions across a network of studies.
NMAs  combine  together  both  direct  (interventions  compared  in
trials) and indirect evidence (interventions not compared directly
in  trials  but  part  of  the  network)  (Higgins  2019).  We  conducted

all  NMAs  in  a  Bayesian  framework,  and  took  into  account  the
correlations  induced  by  multi-arm  trials,  using  WinBUGS  1.4.3
(Winbugs 2012) or OpenBUGS (Lunn 2009). We used standard non-
informative priors based on published WinBUGS code (Dias 2013a).

We initially considered three possible models:

• A  class  (lumped)  model  (i.e.  antidepressants  (ADs)  and
benzodiazepines  (BDZs)  were  compared  with  each  other  and
with placebo).

• An individual treatment model (i.e. all ADs and BDZs listed in the
'Types of interventions' section were compared with each other
and with placebo).

• A  hierarchical  model  (class-effects)  where  we  included  both

class and treatments.

We concluded that it was feasible to conduct individual-effects and
class-effects models. We initially compared goodness of fit statistics
of these models. We measured goodness of fit of the model to the
data by the posterior mean of the residual deviance. This is defined
as the difference between the deviance for the fitted model and the
deviance for the saturated model, where deviance measures the fit
of the model to the data points using the likelihood function. We
assessed convergence using two chains and based on the Brooks-
Gelman-Rubin diagnostic tool in WinBUGS.

Where neither individual-effects nor class-effects models fitted the
data adequately, we explored potential sources of heterogeneity,
inconsistency and risk of bias.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Subgroup analyses are often exploratory in nature and should be
interpreted cautiously: firstly, because they often involve multiple
analyses  leading  to  false-positive  results,  and  secondly  because
these  analyses  lack  power  and  are  more  likely  to  result  in  false-
negative  results.  Therefore,  we  explored  heterogeneity  using  the
following  covariates  in  the  network  meta-analyses  for  the  two
primary outcomes.

• People with panic disorder without agoraphobia versus people

with panic disorder and agoraphobia.

• Date: we included the publication year as a continuous variable,
centred on the mean date. An earlier review noted evidence of
attrition  bias  in  earlier  studies  of  benzodiazepines  (Breilmann
2019).  Design  and  statistical  analyses  of  clinical  trials  have
changed over time; we therefore assessed if this was a source of
heterogeneity.

• Placebo  response:  related  to  the  earlier  point,  Breilmann
2019  found  that  trials  of  benzodiazepines  may  underestimate
placebo response rates. In addition, the onset of action differed
between  interventions  (e.g.  SSRIs,  TCAs,  benzodiazepines)
included  in  the  network.  Therefore,  this  may  be  a  source  of
heterogeneity  in  placebo  response  that  may  impact  on  the
network.  We  included  placebo  response  as  a  random  effect,
allowing response rates to differ by intervention.

Sensitivity analysis

The  following  sensitivity  analyses  were  planned  a  priori.  We
examined  whether  the  results  changed  and  checked  for  the
robustness of the observed findings using the following.

• Excluding trials with imputed response rate.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Excluding studies using an ad hoc outcome scale versus studies
using a validated scale, such as the Panic Disorder Severity Scale
(PDSS),  Clinical  Global  Impression  Severity  Scale,  and  Clinical
Global  Impression  Change  Scale  (for  response  and  remission
outcomes only).

• Conducting  bias-adjustment  models  for  the  two  primary

outcomes (Dias 2013b). The following models were fitted:
◦ Bias adjustment: an initial exploration of the data suggested
there may be differences between small and large studies. To
estimate the influence of small-study effects on the network
meta-analyses, we examined the association between effect
estimates  and  their  variance  (small  studies  usually  have
larger  variances).  We  also  investigated  the  impact  of  high
risk  of  bias  for  each  of  the  domains  of  the  Cochrane
risk  of  bias  tool.  Analyses  were  conducted  on  the  primary
outcomes using WinBUGS. We assessed the magnitude of the
bias  parameter  along  with  its  95%  credible  intervals  (CrIs).
The  impact  on  relative  effects  estimates  and  between-trial
standard deviation were also examined.

◦ Bias  arising  from  missing  data:  as  we  have  noted  above,
trial  analyses  of  missing  data  may  have  resulted 
in
bias.  Therefore,  we  aimed  to  estimate  the  magnitude  of
'informative  missing  parameters'  and  assess  the  impact  of
adjusting for these effects in the network meta-analyses. We
proposed to conduct sensitivity analyses for the two primary
outcomes.  However,  data  were  not  reported  in  sufficient
detail to enable us to conduct these sensitivity analyses.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence

We created summary of findings tables for the primary outcomes:
response and total number of dropouts.

Currently,  two  methods  for  evaluating  confidence  in  the  results
of  an  NMA  have  been  recommended  in  the  CochraneHandbook
for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions:  CINeMA  (CINeMA  2017;
Nikolakopoulou  2019)  and  GRADE  working  group  approaches
(Puhan  2014).  However,  only  frequentist  NMA  estimates  are
compatible with CINeMA software. The complexity of our analyses
required  modelling  to  be  conducted  in  a  Bayesian  framework.
Therefore,  we  were  unable  to  use  the  CINeMA  approach  in
our  review.  There  are  also  potential  limitations  with  the  Puhan
2014  approach,  noted  in  a  recent  paper  (Phillippo  2019).  Since
confidence ratings are based on individual pairwise comparisons,
rather  than  the  network  as  a  whole,  applying  this  method  could
have  potentially  generated  logically  incoherent  judgements  in
some contexts.

We  therefore  used  threshold  analyses  to  explore  the  impact  of
potential biases and evaluate the confidence in our NMA estimates
(Phillippo 2018; Phillippo 2019). We conducted threshold analyses
at  the  contrast  level  (Phillippo  2019).  We  judged  a  clinically
important  effect  to  consist  of  OR  =  0.67  or  OR  =  1.50  compared
with  placebo  for  both  primary  outcomes.  Some  concerns  about
imprecision  were  indicated  by  a  95%  CrI  exceeding  0.67  or  1.50,
depending on effect direction. Major concerns about imprecision
were  indicated  by  a  95%  CrI  exceeding  both  0.67  and  1.50.  We
estimated  invariant  intervals  where  any  changes  (at  the  contrast
level) within this threshold would not impact our conclusions on
the precision of our NMA estimates.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

To assess the impact of risk of bias, we conducted meta-regression
analyses to examine whether each of the domains of the risk of bias
tool were associated with the outcome.

To  assess  the  impact  of  heterogeneity,  we  compared  whether
findings  based  on  95%  CrIs  led  to  different  conclusions  than
analyses  based  on  95%  prediction  intervals  (PIs),  which  capture
heterogeneity not taken into account by CrIs. That is, we examined
when the 95% CrI was within the invariant interval and the 95% PI
extended beyond the invariant interval.

In terms of incoherence, where inconsistency between direct and
indirect evidence was identified in our analyses, we assessed the
extent to which the conclusions were likely to be robust to these
data issues.

Similarly,  if  indirectness  was  identified  we  assessed  the  likely
impact  on  our  conclusions  based  on  the  estimated  invariant
intervals. However, indirectness was not identified in any analyses.

We formally checked the presence of publication bias with visual
inspection of funnel plots in the head-to-head published Cochrane
Review (Bighelli 2018).

Description of studies

Results of the search

Searching  and  selection  of  studies  has  been  done 
in
the  previous  Cochrane  head-to-head  comparison  reviews  on
antidepressants  and  benzodiazepines  in  panic  disorder  (Bighelli
2016),  antidepressants  versus  placebo  in  panic  disorder  (Bighelli
2018)  and  benzodiazepines  versus  placebo  in  panic  disorder
(Breilmann  2019).  This  NMA  includes  all  the  studies  selected  in
those reviews. We carried out two new searches on 1 February 2021
and 26 May 2022. No new studies in addition to the ones already
included  in  the  previous  Cochrane  head-to-head  comparison
reviews were found after the two new searches.

The  number  of  records  identified  by  the  searches  was  3677  and
3199 remained after de-duplication. We excluded 3013 references
after assessment of titles and abstracts. We retrieved 186 full-text
articles  for  full  inspection.  Of  these,  116  studies  were  excluded.
Finally,  70  trials,  including  12,703  participants,  were  included  in
the review. See Figure 1 for a PRISMA flow diagram (Moher 2009)
depicting the study selection process.

Included studies

Duration of the intervention

We included 70 trials in this review (see Characteristics of included
studies and Figure 1).

Intervention duration ranged from 4 to 24 weeks.

Outcomes

Sample sizes

The sample sizes ranged between 5 and 445 participants in each
arm. Total sample size per study ranged from 10 to 1168. Thirty-five
studies had sample sizes of over 100 participants.

Setting

A total of 29 trials enrolled only outpatients, three trials enrolled
only inpatients, and both inpatients and outpatients were enrolled
in three trials. For the remaining 35 trials, the setting was unclear.

Thirty-three  trials  were  conducted  in  the  USA,  four  in  the
Netherlands,  two  in  Italy,  four  in  Canada,  three  in  Brazil,  two  in
China,  two  in  the  UK,  four  in  Japan  and  one  in  Finland;  13  trials
were multinational and two did not provide information about the
country.

Participants

Fifty  trials  reported  data  on  response  rates,  while  the  number
of  dropouts  for  any  reason  was  reported  in  64  trials.  Thirty-six
trials reported on remission rates, 37 trials reported data on panic
symptoms, 40 on frequency of panic attacks and 25 on agoraphobia
outcomes.

Excluded studies

There  are  116  excluded  studies.  The  most  common  reason  for
exclusion was that participants did not meet our inclusion criteria
for panic disorder (51 studies). The next most common reason for
exclusion  was  not  meeting  our  study  design  criteria  (31  studies),
then  comparator  not  meeting  our  inclusion  criteria  (13  studies).
Intervention inclusion criteria were not met in 15 studies, one study
was  conducted  in  a  population  that  did  not  meet  our  inclusion
criteria and, finally, five studies did not provide sufficient data to be
included in our review (see Characteristics of excluded studies and
Figure 1).

The proportion of women ranged from 40% to 90%. The mean age
of participants ranged from 32 to 46 years.

Risk of bias in included studies

Interventions

trials 

included 

two  arms,  while 

Fifty-two 
the  remaining
studies  had  three  arms.  Eight  trials  included  a  comparison
between  antidepressants  and  benzodiazepines,  15  between
individual  antidepressants  and  two  trials  between  individual
benzodiazepines. Fifty-five trials had a placebo arm.

Allocation

Selective reporting

Allocation  concealment  and  random  sequence  generation  were
rarely  reported 
in  sufficient  detail.  For  random  sequence
generation, we rated only four studies at low risk of bias. We rated
all other studies at unclear risk of bias. For allocation concealment,
we  rated  only  five  studies  at  low  risk  of  bias.  We  rated  all  other
studies at an unclear risk of bias.

Blinding

We judged 26 studies at low risk of bias for blinding of participants
and personnel. We judged two studies to be at high risk of bias. All
the other studies had unclear risk of bias.

We judged 27 studies to be at low risk of bias for selective reporting.
We judged 24 studies to be at high risk of bias. We judged all the
other studies to be at unclear risk of bias.

Other potential sources of bias

We  judged  eight  studies  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias.  We  judged  35
studies to be at high risk of bias. All the other studies were at unclear
risk of bias. The most common reason for studies to be at high risk
of bias was potential or actual sponsorship bias.

Effects of interventions

We  judged  14  studies  at  low  risk  of  bias  for  blinding  of  outcome
assessment  and  one  study  at  high  risk  of  bias.  We  judged  all  the
other studies to be at unclear risk of bias.

See:  Summary  of  findings  1  Summary  of  findings:  response  at
end  of  treatment;  Summary  of  findings  2  Summary  of  findings:
dropout at end of treatment

Incomplete outcome data

We  judged  17  studies  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias  for  incomplete
outcome data. We judged 24 studies to be at high risk of bias and
all the other studies to be at unclear risk of bias.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Figure 4.   Network plot for response outcome (node size and edge width weighted by sample size)

Table  1  summarises  the  model  selection  process.  We  began  by
fitting  the  two  models  proposed  in  our  protocol:  an  individual-
effects  model  of  antidepressants  and  benzodiazepines  and  a
class-effects model that included individual medications but also
allowed  clustering  between  treatments  from  the  class.  Neither
model fitted the data well, therefore we assessed goodness of fit
for individual-effects models with a covariate for publication date,
adjustment for baseline risk and bias adjustment for small studies
models.

The model that included a covariate for publication date did not
substantially improve goodness of fit. However, models adjusting
for baseline risk or small-study effects fitted the data better than
either  the  individual-effects  or  class-effects  models.  However,
the  bias  adjustment  model  had  a  lower  between-study  standard
deviation  (SD  0.28,  95%  CrI  0.05  to  0.50)  than  the  baseline  risk
model (SD 0.54, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.78). The bias adjustment model

(mean  =  108.6)  also  had  a  lower  total  residual  deviance  than  the
baseline  risk  model  (mean  =  112.4);  we  therefore  selected  this
model for our main results.

We ran models for an initial 50,000 iterations and confirmed that the
model  had  reached  convergence.  We  discarded  the  initial  50,000
iterations and ran the model for 100,000 further iterations.

transitivity:  node-splitting  analyses  and

Consistent  with  the  protocol,  to  aid  model  selection  we  first
explored  the  potential  for  inconsistency  (transitivity)  between
direct and indirect evidence using node-splitting analyses.

There  was  evidence  of 
inconsistency  for  the  brofaromine–
fluvoxamine-placebo  loop  (brofaromine  versus  placebo,  P  =
0.001; fluvoxamine versus placebo, P = 0.008; brofaromine versus

fluvoxamine,  P  =  0.001).  For  further  details,  please  see  Appendix
3.  This  is  consistent  with  the  residual  deviances  in  the  standard
NMA model, which also suggested that these trials were outliers.

In addition, threshold analyses found that the NMA findings were
sensitive  to  imprecision  in  the  comparison  between  brofaromine
and fluvoxamine (see Figure 5).

Figure 5.   Forest plot for threshold analysis on response Medications: 1 = placebo, 2 = fluoxetine, 3 = sertraline, 4 =
venlafaxine, 5 = fluvoxamine, 6 = clomipramine, 7 = imipramine, 8 = paroxetine, 9 = moclobemide, 10 = citalopram,
11 = desipramine, 12 = clonazepam, 13 = adinazolam, 14 = alprazolam, 15 = escitalopram, 16 = diazepam, 17 =
buspirone, 18 = reboxetine, 19 = etizolam, 20 = ritanserin

Given  these  issues  with  the  brofaromine-fluvoxamine-placebo
evidence  loop,  we  excluded  these  studies  (Van  Vliet  1993;  Van

Vliet 1996) from the main analysis. In addition, we also identified
problematic residual deviances for another study (Schweizer 1992),

with  only  five  participants  and  100%  events  in  one  arm;  we
therefore also excluded this study from the main analyses.

observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses or did not report the
method of incomplete outcome data management.

Of course, it is never possible to affirm the transitivity assumption
with  certainty.  However,  the  above  measures  have  helped  to
explore  transitivity  and  to  minimise  the  potential  for  violation  of
this assumption.

Meta-regression analyses

The main purpose of the meta-regression analyses was to identify
potential  prognostic  factors  associated  with  treatment  effect,
which  may  contribute  to  the  risk  of  intransitivity.  We  planned  to
assess the impact of three covariates in meta-regression analyses
(presence of agoraphobia, publication date and placebo response
rate).  It  was  not  possible  to  assess  the  impact  of  agoraphobia
as all studies included participants with this condition (see Table
2).  In  addition,  we  planned  to  adjust  for  small-study  effects  in  a
sensitivity analysis, but due to poor fit for the models proposed in
the protocol this model became our main analyses.

There  may  be  a  strong  association  between  the  variance  in
individual  studies  and  response,  but  the  credible  intervals  were
wide  (beta  -1.20,  95%  CrI  -2.59  to  0.46).  The  bias  estimate  also
suggested that there is likely some variation in effect due to small
study bias (Kappa 1.41, 95% CrI 0.15 to 2.98). However, there was a
lot of variability in estimating this parameter.

There  was  a  strong  association  between  effect  estimates  and
placebo response rates with a tight CrI (beta -0.79, 95% CrI -1.02 to
-0.40). However, the heterogeneity estimate was a little higher than
for the no covariate model (SD 0.57, 95% CrI 0.39 to 0.81).

Publication  date  was  not  associated  with  effect  estimates  (beta
-0.03,  95%  CrI  -0.06  to  0.04)  and  had  a  limited  impact  on
heterogeneity  (no  covariate  model  SD  0.50,  95%  CrI  0.28  to  0.79;
covariate model SD 0.45, 95% CrI 0.23 to 0.74)

Sensitivity analyses

We  also  identified  several  methodological  factors  that  may
contribute to intransitivity. These are explored below.

See Summary of findings 1 for more information.

Main results

Although we focus on the findings of the model adjusting for small-
study effects, comparisons between medications and placebo for
the model adjusting for baseline risk are also provided in Table 3.

Most medications were more effective than placebo. The following
medications  were  effective  and  95%  CrIs  did  not  cross  the
equivalence range:

• diazepam (RR 0.65, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.96; mean rank 3, 95% CrI 1

to 15);

• alprazolam (RR 0.68, 95% CrI 0.39 to 0.92; mean rank 4, 95% CrI

1 to 11);

• clonazepam (RR 0.71, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.94; mean rank 6, 95% CrI

2 to 13);

• paroxetine (RR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.64 to 0.97; mean rank 11, 95% CrI

6 to 16);

• venlafaxine (RR 0.84, 95% CrI 0.60 to 0.97; mean rank 11, 95% CrI

4 to 17).

The  following  medications  were  more  effective  than  placebo  but
95% CrIs crossed the equivalence range:

• escitalopram (RR 0.78, 95% CrI 0.39 to 1.03; mean rank 8, 95%

CrI 1 to 18);

• fluoxetine (RR 0.78, 95% CrI 0.43 to 1.00; mean rank 8, 95% CrI

2 to 17);

• adinazolam (RR 0.82, 95% CrI 0.49 to 1.00; mean rank 9, 95% CrI

2 to 17);

• imipramine (RR 0.82, 95% CrI 0.40 to 1.09; mean rank 9, 95% CrI

2 to 18);

• clomipramine (RR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.57 to 0.99; mean rank 11, 95%

CrI 4 to 17);

• fluvoxamine (RR 0.86, 95% CrI 0.53 to 1.05; mean rank 12, 95%

CrI 3 to 18);

1) Excluding trials with imputed response rates

• citalopram (RR 0.87, 95% CrI 0.57 to 1.02; mean rank 12, 95% CrI

Excluding  four  trials  with  imputed  response  rates  did  not  impact
on goodness of fit. For example, the individual-effects model had a
very high total residual deviance (mean 117, from 98 data points),
indicating a poor fit with the data. Excluding these studies also did
not reduce heterogeneity (SD 0.57, 95% CrI 0.33 to 0.90).

2) Excluding studies using an ad hoc outcome scale versus studies
using a validated panic scale

Most  trials  did  not  use  a  validated  panic  scale,  therefore  we
excluded  30  trials  in  the  sensitivity  analyses,  leaving  only  21
included  studies.  Total  residual  deviance  remained  high  (mean
53.46, from 48 data points) and heterogeneity slightly increased (SD
0.58, 95% CrI 0.12 to 1.25).

Threshold analysis

Risk of bias: meta-regression analyses did not find an association
between effect estimates and domains (attrition bias and outcome
reporting bias) judged to potentially be at risk of bias.

Imprecision:  imprecision  of  findings  was  of  potential  concern;
95%  CrIs  crossed  our  a  priori  determined  equivalence  range  for
most  comparisons  (e.g.  escitalopram  versus  placebo,  fluoxetine
versus placebo, adinazolam versus placebo). There were particular
concerns  about  imprecision  for  three  comparisons  (desipramine
versus  placebo,  buspirone  versus  placebo,  ritanserin  versus
placebo) since the 95% CrIs crossed the equivalence range in both
directions.

However, threshold analyses suggested that the NMA findings were
robust to imprecision for most comparisons. Although the findings
were  sensitive  to  imprecision  for  the  following  comparisons  (see
Figure 5), this imprecision is unlikely to impact on effect estimates
for other medications in the network as they were both based on
one small RCT and not directly compared with other medications:

• etizolam versus placebo: OR 0.28 (95% CrI 0.01 to 5.69); RR 0.58

(95% CrI 0.03 to 1.43);

• reboxetine versus placebo: OR 0.46 (95% CrI 0.10 to 1.86); RR 0.77

(95% CrI 0.24 to 1.19).

Heterogeneity:  for  the  following  comparisons  the  prediction
interval  (PI),  but  not  the  credible 
interval,  crossed  our  a
priori  equivalence  range,  suggesting  a  potential  concern  about
heterogeneity:

• fluoxetine versus placebo (OR 0.50, 95% PI 0.19 to 1.22);
• sertraline versus placebo (OR 0.60, 95% PI 0.24 to 1.51);
• venlafaxine versus placebo (OR 0.58, 95% PI 0.29 to 1.20);
• fluvoxamine versus placebo (OR 0.61, 95% PI 0.26 to 1.52);
• clomipramine versus placebo (OR 0.61, 95% PI 0.28 to 1.28);
• imipramine versus placebo (OR 0.53, 95% PI 0.17 to 1.65);
• paroxetine versus placebo (OR 0.59, 95% PI 0.31 to 1.22);
• adinazolam versus placebo (OR 0.54, 95% PI 0.23 to 1.26);

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• sertraline versus paroxetine (OR 0.90, 95% PI 0.36 to 2.26);
• paroxetine versus alprazolam (OR 0.61, 95% PI 0.23 to 1.55).

However,  the  threshold  analysis  indicated  that  heterogeneity
was  unlikely  to  impact  on  the  NMA  findings.  Prediction  intervals
remained  within  the  invariant  intervals  for  all  three  comparisons
(see Figure 5).

Indirectness: we identified several factors that may impact on the
directness of the evidence:

• In some studies, the placebo arm had more dropouts than the

active treatment arm.

• Different  methodology  is  used  in  newer  studies  compared  to

older studies.

• Some studies have used validated measures, while some others

have used clinician judgement.

• Some medications, for example etizolam, are not widely used in

practice.

Incoherence  (transitivity):  node-splitting  analyses  found  evidence
of  incoherence  for  the  brofaromine-fluvoxamine-placebo  loop.
However,  since  studies  within  this  evidence  loop  were  excluded
from  the  main  analyses  there  were  no  longer  concerns  about
potential incoherence.

Small-study  effects:  we  found  evidence  of  small-study  bias.  The
base-case  models  proposed  in  our  protocol  all  fitted  the  data
poorly.  However,  analyses  adjusted  for  the  magnitude  of  the
variance of individual studies substantially improved model fit. This
suggests that findings from studies with larger sample sizes (and
smaller  variances)  may  have  differed  from  smaller  studies  (and
larger variances). However, it is unclear whether the NMA findings
were impacted by any residual bias.

Dropout

Figure  6  presents  a  network  plot  for  each  individual  treatment
compared  with  placebo  and  other  interventions.  Nodes  were
weighted  by  the  number  of  studies  and  width  of  the  edges  was
weighted by the inverse of the variance. Sixty-four RCTs, including
12,310 participants, were included in the NMA. Results from Figure
6 are commented on below.

We fitted two models: one that included individual antidepressants

medications but also allowed clustering between treatments from
the  class.  Neither  model  fitted  the  data  well,  for  example  total
residual deviance was much higher than the number of data points
(see Table 4). Therefore, we selected the model with adjustment for
small-study effects for the main results.

We ran models for an initial 50,000 iterations and confirmed that the

may contribute to the risk of intransitivity. We planned to assess the
impact of three covariates in meta-regression analyses (presence
of  agoraphobia,  publication  date  and  placebo  response  rate).  It
was not possible to assess the impact of agoraphobia as all studies
included participants with this condition (see Table 2). In addition,
we planned to adjust for small-study effects in a sensitivity analysis,
but  due  to  poor  fit  for  the  models  proposed  in  the  protocol,  this
model became our main analyses.

Meta-regression  analyses  were  only  possible  for  the  association
between  effect  estimates  and  the  size  of  variance  in  individual
studies.  There  was  a  strong  association  between  the  variance
for  included  trials  and  the  effects  (beta  -1.07,  95%  CrI  -1.77  to
-0.38;  kappa  =  0.71,  95%  CrI  0.09  to  1.55).  There  was  a  more
precise estimate of small-study bias for dropouts, with both lower
and  upper  credible  interval  suggesting  substantial  bias.  When
comparing  the  smallest  to  the  largest  study  the  exaggeration  of
effect is estimated to be 3.207 on a logOR scale and 24.705 on an OR
scale. As above, this is potentially an overestimate of the likely bias
as  reflected  by  relatively  wide  credible  intervals.  However,  even
at the lower credible interval there is a strong suggestion of bias
(exaggeration  can  vary  between  3.61  and  184.69  on  an  OR  scale
based on credible intervals).

It was not possible to conclude anything regarding the association
between  the  other  covariates  and  effect  estimates.  All  the  meta-
regression  models  crashed  for  this  outcome.  The  likely  causes  of
these problems were a number of studies with zero events as well
as other studies with a very low number of events. Therefore, we
fitted  models  with  a  continuity  correction  (adding  0.5  to  all  cells
in  the  2  x  2  table  in  studies  with  no  events  in  either  intervention
or  control).  We  also  fitted  models  with  varying  priors  for  the
heterogeneity parameter (a minimally informative prior with large
variance  compared  with  an  informative  prior  for  mental  health
studies). It was not possible to run either of these models. We then
excluded studies from the analyses where there were zero events
either  in  the  intervention  or  control  group.  However,  there  still
remained a number of studies with a small number of events and
this model also failed to run.

Main results

Most medications were either associated with a reduced or similar
proportion of participants who dropped out, compared to placebo
(see Table 5).

There  was  a  reduction  in  dropout  rate  compared  with  placebo
for  the  following  medications  and  95%  CrIs  did  not  cross  the
equivalence range or invariant range:

• sertraline (RR 1.00, 95% CrI 0.80 to 1.30; mean rank 13, 95% CrI

7 to 18);

• paroxetine (RR 1.07, 95% CrI 0.92 to 1.07; mean rank 15, 95% CrI

10 to 19).

For one medication, there was an increased dropout rate compared
with placebo that did not cross the equivalence range:

• buspirone (RR 1.83, 95% CrI 1.14 to 3.34; mean rank 21, 95% CrI

18 to 21).

Several  medications  had  a  reduced  dropout  rate  compared  with
placebo, and 95% CrIs crossed the equivalence range but not the
invariant range:

• reboxetine (RR 0.40, 95% CrI 0.13 to 1.17; mean rank 3, 95% CrI

1 to 15);

• escitalopram (RR 0.68, 95% CrI 0.38 to 1.08; mean rank 6, 95%

CrI 2 to 15);

• imipramine (RR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.63 to 1.12; mean rank 8, 95% CrI

4 to 15);

• citalopram (RR 0.88, 95% CrI 0.62 to 1.20; mean rank 9, 95% CrI

5 to 17).

There  was  no  difference  in  dropout  rate  compared  with  placebo
for  the  following  medications,  however  95%  CrIs  crossed  the
equivalence range but not the invariant range:

• clonazepam (RR 0.92, 95% CrI 0.63 to 1.22; mean rank 10, 95%

CrI 5 to 18);

• clomipramine (RR 0.96, 95% CrI 0.74 to 1.24; mean rank 11, 95%

CrI 6 to 17);

• fluvoxamine (RR 1.16, 95% CrI 0.85 to 1.63; mean rank 17, 95%

CrI 9 to 20);

• adinazolam (RR 1.19, 95% CrI 0.87 to 1.68; mean rank 17, 95% CrI

9 to 20).

For two medications compared with placebo, 95% CrIs were wide
and crossed the equivalence range in both directions but not the
invariant range:

• desipramine (RR 0.63, 95% CrI 0.14 to 1.73; mean rank 5, 95% CrI

1 to 20);

• fluoxetine (RR 1.13, 95% CrI 0.62 to 1.94; mean rank 16, 95% CrI

5 to 20).

For one medication compared with placebo, the 95% CrI crossed
the  equivalence  range  in  both  directions  and  also  crossed  the
invariant range:

• etizolam (RR 0.39, 95% CrI 0.01 to 2.69; mean rank 2, 95% CrI 1

• alprazolam (RR 0.46, 95% CrI 0.33 to 0.65; mean rank 3, 95% CrI

• diazepam (RR 0.50, 95% CrI 0.23 to 0.91; mean rank 3, 95% CrI

There  was  no  difference  in  dropout  rate  compared  with  placebo
for  the  following  medications  and  95%  CrIs  did  not  cross  the
equivalence range or invariant range:

• venlafaxine (RR 0.99, 95% CrI 0.80 to 1.21; mean rank 12, 95% CrI

6 to 18);

Threshold analysis

Risk  of  bias:  we  were  unable  to  assess  the  association  between
effect  estimates  and  the  impact  of  risk  of  bias.  Therefore,  it  is
unclear the extent to which our findings are sensitive to domains
(attrition  bias  and  outcome  reporting  bias)  where  a  substantial
proportion of studies were rated at a high or unclear risk of bias.

Imprecision:  NMA  findings  were  not  sensitive  to  imprecision
for  any  comparisons,  with  the  exception  of  etizolam  versus

imprecision substantially impacted on the effect estimates for other
medications in the network.

• venlafaxine versus placebo (OR 0.98, 95% PI 0.58 to 1.68).

Heterogeneity:  there  was  evidence  of  substantial  heterogeneity.
For the following comparisons 95% prediction intervals extended
beyond  the  equivalence  range  in  both  directions,  whilst  95%
credible  intervals  were  within  the  equivalence  range,  potentially
indicating major concerns with heterogeneity:

However, the threshold analysis indicated this heterogeneity was
unlikely  to  impact  on  the  NMA  findings  (Figure  7).  For  both
comparisons 95% PIs remained within the invariant intervals.

identified
Incoherence 
incoherence  between  direct  and  indirect  evidence  for  several
comparisons.  However,  the  NMA  findings  were  sensitive  to
incoherence for two comparisons:

• Desipramine  versus  placebo:  direct  estimates  crossed  the
invariant threshold (log OR -2.30, 95% CrI -4.40 to -0.77) but not
indirect estimates (log OR 1.30, 95% CrI -1.60 to 4.90) or network
estimates (log OR -1.5, 95% CrI -2.90 to -0.23). This incoherence
may reflect the instability of estimates in an evidence loop based
on  two  small  trials:  desipramine  versus  placebo  (N  =  56)  and
desipramine versus fluoxetine (N = 22).

• Fluoxetine  versus  placebo:  indirect  estimates  crossed  the
invariant threshold (log OR -1.60, 95% CrI -3.60 to 0.08) but not

direct estimates (log OR 0.48, 95% CrI -0.38 to 1.40) or network
estimates (log OR 0.04, 95% CrI -0.72 to 0.81). This incoherence
may  partly  be  explained  by  small-study  effects,  since  the
fluoxetine versus placebo estimate was based on a larger trial
(N = 180), whereas head-to-head trials between fluoxetine and
other  medications  were  mainly  based  on  small  trials:  versus
imipramine (N = 18), citalopram (N = 42), desipramine (N = 22),
mirtazapine (N = 30). Therefore, the bias-adjusted analyses may
have reduced the impact of the incoherence in these estimates.

Reporting  bias/small-study  effects:  we  found  evidence  of  small-
study  bias,  therefore  our  main  findings  are  based  on  a  model
adjusting for this potential bias. The base-case models proposed in
our protocol all fitted the data poorly. However, analyses adjusted
for  the  magnitude  of  the  variance  of  individual  studies  led  to
an  acceptable  model  fit.  This  suggests  that  findings  from  studies
with larger sample sizes (and smaller variances) may have differed
from smaller studies (and larger variances). However, it is unclear
whether the NMA findings were impacted by any residual bias.

We began by fitting both individual-effects and class-effects models
but  neither  fitted  the  data  well  (see  Table  6).  Given  the  limited
differences  between  the  individual-level  and  class-level  models,
we  focused  on  the  individual-level  model.  High  deviances  (>  2)
were  observed  for  five,  mostly  small,  studies  (Black  1993;  GSK
1994/04;  Klosko  1990;  Nair  1996;  Pohl  1989b).  Removing  these
studies  improved  the  fit  of  the  model.  In  addition,  the  between-
study standard deviation was 0.22 (95% CrI 0.02 to 0.42). Since the
removal of outliers led to an acceptable fit, we selected this model
for further analyses.

Table  7  summarises  the  NMA  findings  on  remission.  Most
medications were more effective than placebo:

• desipramine (RR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.29 to 0.97; mean rank 2, 95% CrI

1 to 13);

• alprazolam (RR 0.65, 95% CrI 0.44 to 0.84; mean rank 2, 95% CrI

1 to 5);

• fluoxetine (RR 0.77, 95% CrI 0.46 to 0.96; mean rank 5, 95% CrI

1 to 13);

• clonazepam (RR 0.76, 95% CrI 0.53 to 0.92; mean rank 5, 95% CrI

1 to 11);

• diazepam (RR 0.74, 95% CrI 0.43 to 0.96; mean rank 5, 95% CrI 1

to 13);

• fluvoxamine (RR 0.77, 95% CrI 0.50 to 0.95; mean rank 6, 95% CrI

1 to 12);

• imipramine (RR 0.79, 95% CrI 0.57 to 0.94; mean rank 7, 95% CrI

• paroxetine (RR 0.88, 95% CrI 0.71 to 0.97; mean rank 10, 95% CrI

Two medications probably were more effective than placebo, but
the 95% CrIs crossed our equivalence range:

• sertraline (RR 0.86, 95% CrI 0.68 to 1.01; mean rank 9, 95% CrI 3

to 15);

• escitalopram (RR 0.92, 95% CrI 0.65 to 1.09; mean rank 12, 95%

• fluoxetine RR 0.80 (95% CrI 0.46 to 1.04);
• sertraline RR 0.86 (95% CrI 0.75 to 1.09);
• paroxetine RR 0.86 (95% CrI 0.61 to 1.03);
• venlafaxine RR 0.87 (95% CrI 0.68 to 1.00);
• escitalopram RR 0.92 (95% CrI 0.58 to 1.14);

• citalopram RR 0.98 (95% CrI 0.0.65 to 1.18).

Three medications may be no different from placebo, but there was
considerable  uncertainty  about  these  estimates  as  the  95%  CrIs
crossed our equivalence range in both directions:

• citalopram (RR 0.97, 95% CrI 0.73 to 1.15; mean rank 13, 95% CrI

• clomipramine (RR 1.01, 95% CrI 0.83 to 1.16; mean rank 15, 95%

CrI 9 to 16).

Sensitivity analysis

Most  trials  did  not  use  a  validated  panic  scale,  therefore  this
sensitivity analysis, excluding unvalidated scales, included only 15
trials and 12 medications:

• clonazepam RR 0.20 (95% CrI 0.01 to 0.88);
• alprazolam RR 0.56 (95% CrI 0.24 to 0.89);
• imipramine RR 0.78 (95% CrI 0.45 to 1.04);

Effect  estimates  for  the  remaining  treatments  did  not  differ
substantially  from  the  main  analyses  for  most  treatments.  There
were  two  exceptions:  in  the  main  analyses  there  were  four  trials
of clonazepam and only one small trial (N = 24) in the sensitivity
analyses  (Valenca  2000),  which  had  a  very  high  placebo  non-
response rate (90%) that may have led to an overestimate of the
effectiveness  of  clonazepam.  In  addition,  fluvoxamine  was  less
effective compared to placebo in the sensitivity analysis compared
with the main analyses. One trial was excluded from the sensitivity
analysis (Hoehn-Saric 1993); this was a relatively small trial (N = 50)
and had a very high placebo non-response rate (84%), which may
have led to an overestimate of the effectiveness of fluvoxamine in
the main analyses.

Figure 10.   Network plot of intervention comparisons included in network meta-analysis of panic scales (endpoint)

Studies  reported  change  from  baseline  and/or  endpoint  scores,
therefore we analysed these data separately. We fitted two models:
one that included individual antidepressants and benzodiazepines
and  a  class-effects  model  that  included  medications  but  also
allowed clustering between treatments from the class. Both models
fitted the data well, therefore we selected the simpler individual-
effects  model  for  both  change  from  baseline  (between-study
standard deviation 0.63, 95% CrI 0.33 to 1.30) and endpoint data
(between-study standard deviation 0.46, 95% CrI 0.29 to 0.82) (see
Table 8). Below we summarise the NMA endpoint data but for more
details and change from baseline data, see Table 9.

Compared  with  placebo  there  was  a  large  reduction  in  panic
symptoms  for  the  following  interventions,  however  they  were  all
based on either one trial or a few small trials:

• brofaromine SMD -3.78 (95% CrI -5.02 to -2.55), mean rank 1 (95%

CrI 1 to 2);

• clonazepam SMD -2.36 (95% CrI -3.27 to -1.45), mean rank 2 (95%

CrI 1 to 3);

• reboxetine SMD -1.03 (95% CrI -2.13 to 0.08), mean rank 3 (95%

CrI 2 to 10).

Compared  with  placebo  there  were  medium-to-large  imprecise
reductions in panic symptoms for these interventions:

• clomipramine  SMD  -0.68  (95%  CrI  -1.38  to  0.03),  mean  rank  5

(95% CrI 3 to 9);

• alprazolam SMD -0.48 (95% CrI -1.19 to 0.24), mean rank 6 (95%

CrI 3 to 11).

Compared  with  placebo  there  were  small  reductions  in  panic
symptoms for these interventions:

• adinazolam SMD -0.18 (95% CrI -1.00 to 0.63), mean rank 8 (95%

CrI 4 to 12);

• imipramine SMD -0.28 (95% CrI -1.03 to 0.47), mean rank 7 (95%

CrI 3 to 12);

• venlafaxine SMD 0.30 (95% CrI -0.39 to 0.99), mean rank 12 (95%

CrI 7 to 12).

• fluvoxamine SMD -0.17 (95% CrI -0.79 to 0.45), mean rank 8 (95%

Figure  11  presents  a  network  plot  for  each  individual  treatment
compared  with  placebo  and  other  interventions.  Nodes  were
weighted by the number of studies and the width of the edges was
weighted by the inverse of the variance. Forty-one RCTs, including
7853 participants, were included in the NMA.

We fitted two models: one that included individual antidepressants
and  benzodiazepines  and  a  class-effects  model  that  included
medications but also allowed clustering between treatments from
the class. Both models fitted the data well; we therefore preferred
the  individual-effects  model  as  the  more  complex  class-effects
model was not found to fit the data any better (see Table 10).

Examining  the  network  plot,  there  was  one  study  of  midazolam
compared  with  placebo  with  only  five  participants.  Given  the
very  large  effect  size,  and  lack  of  connection  to  other  nodes  in
the  network,  we  excluded  this  study  from  the  individual-effects
model.  This  led  to  a  much  better  fit  compared  with  the  main
individual-effects  model,  and  total  residual  deviance  remained

acceptable  (mean  88.04,  from  90  data  points).  We  therefore
selected this sensitivity analysis for the main results. The between-
study standard deviation was 2.72 (2.06 to 3.69).

Main results

Compared  with  placebo,  only  two  medications  were  associated
with  a  reduction  in  the  frequency  of  panic  attacks  that  did  not
include zero in the 95% credible intervals (see Table 11):

• desipramine: MD -4.60 (-10.55 to 1.33), mean rank 2 (95% CrI 1

to 14);

• clonazepam: MD -3.76 (-7.61 to -0.03), mean rank 3 (95% CrI 1 to

12);

• alprazolam: MD -2.58 (-4.79 to -0.43), mean rank 6 (95% CrI 2 to

12).

Compared with placebo, several medications were associated with
a reduction of at least one panic attack, but with wide 95% credible
intervals:

• venlafaxine: MD -1.28 (95% CrI -3.93 to 1.37), mean rank 9 (95%

CrI 3 to 15).

Compared with placebo, several medications were associated with
either no reduction or less than one panic attack, but with wide 95%
credible intervals:

• clomipramine:  MD  -0.96  (95%  CrI  -4.06  to  2.15),  mean  rank  10

(95% CrI 3 to 15);

• fluoxetine: MD -0.71 (-6.30 to 4.89), mean rank 10 (95% CrI 1 to

16);

• imipramine: MD -0.71 (-6.43 to 5.03), mean rank 10 (95% CrI 1 to

16);

• adinazolam: MD -0.33 (-3.75 to 3.08), mean rank 11 (95% CrI 3 to

16);

• diazepam: MD -0.66 (-7.67 to 6.35), mean rank 11 (95% CrI 1 to

16);

• fluvoxamine: MD 0.06 (95% CrI -3.46 to 3.55), mean rank 12 (95%

CrI 4 to 15).

• reboxetine: MD -3.54 (-8.57 to 1.50), mean rank 4 (95% CrI to 1 to

• paroxetine: MD -1.97 (95% CrI -4.22 to 0.27), mean rank 7 (95%

We removed two small studies (Van Vliet 1993; Van Vliet 1996) with
high deviances (> 3) that were clear outliers and represented a risk
to transitivity assumption.

Individual-effects and class-effects models both fitted the data well
for both endpoint and change from baseline; we therefore selected
the  individual-effects  model  for  both  datasets  (see  Table  12  for
further details). The results below are for endpoint data (for further
details and change from baseline data, see Table 13).

There  were  three  medications,  in  comparison  with  placebo,
associated  either  with  negligible  change  or  a  small  increase  in
agoraphobia  symptoms.  However,  in  each  case  the  95%  credible
intervals for these estimates were very wide:

CrI 5 to 14).

2. Pooled intervention classes

Data  for  individual  interventions  were  insufficiently  precise  to
compare across active interventions. Therefore, we also conducted
analyses  on  pooled  intervention  classes  (SSRIs,  SNRIs,  TCAs,
MAOIs,  benzodiazepines),  comparing  the  effectiveness  of  these
intervention classes with placebo and one another. We limited our
analyses to the primary outcomes of response and dropout.

Response

Figure  14  illustrates  the  network  of  comparisons  included  in  the
NMA. The bias adjustment model best fitted the data, therefore we
based  our  estimates  on  this  model  (see  Table  14).  The  between-
study  standard  deviation  was  0.25  (95%  CrI  0.04  to  0.44).  All
intervention  classes  were  effective  compared  with  placebo  (see
Table 15):

• SSRIs: RR 0.83 (95% CrI 0.63 to 0.96), mean rank 5 (95% CrI 2 to 6);
• SNRIs: RR 0.85 (95% CrI 0.63 to 0.97), mean rank 5 (95% CrI 1 to 6);
• TCAs: RR 0.82 (95% CrI 0.57 to 0.96), mean rank 4 (95% CrI 1 to 6);

• BDZs: RR 0.78 (95% CrI 0.52 to 0.95), mean rank 3 (95% CrI 1 to 6).

There was no difference between the following classes, with all 95%
CrIs remaining within the equivalence range:

• SNRIs versus SSRIs: RR 1.01 (95% CrI 0.86 to 1.21);
• TCAs versus SSRIs: RR 0.98 (95% CrI 0.81 to 1.13).

There was no difference between the following classes, although
the 95% CrIs crossed the equivalence range:

• TCAs versus SNRIs: RR 0.97 (95% CrI 0.75 to 1.16);
• MAOIs versus SSRIs: RR 0.95 (95% CrI 0.74 to 1.10);
• BDZs versus SSRIs: RR 0.94 (95% CrI 0.74 to 1.08);
• MAOIs versus SNRIs: RR 0.94 (95% CrI 0.69 to 1.14);

• MAOIs versus TCAs: RR 0.97 (95% CrI 0.75 to 1.19);
• BDZs versus TCAs: RR 0.96 (95% CrI 0.75 to 1.17).

There was also no difference between the following classes, but the
95% CrI crossed both sides of the equivalence range:

Dropout

Figure  15  illustrates  the  network  of  comparisons  included  in  the
NMA for dropout. The bias adjustment model best fitted the data,

therefore we based our estimates on this model (see Table 16). The
between-study standard deviation was 0.38 (95% CrI 0.22 to 0.58).

Figure 15.   Network diagram comparing medication classes with placebo and one another for dropout (node size
and edge width weighted by sample size)

Benzodiazepines  (BDZs)  were  the  only  treatment  where  dropout
was less likely than with placebo (see Table 17):

• BDZs: RR 0.63 (0.45 to 0.83), mean rank 1 (95% CrI 1 to 2);
• SSRIs: RR 1.01 (0.85 to 1.22), mean rank 5 (95% CrI 2 to 7);
• SNRIs: RR 0.97 (0.73 to 1.33), mean rank 4 (95% CrI 2 to 7);
• TCAs: RR 0.89 (0.67 to 1.14), mean rank 3 (95% CrI 2 to 6);

• MAOIs: RR 1.06 (0.58 to 1.80), mean rank 6 (95% CrI 1 to 7).

BDZs  were  associated  with  a  reduced  risk  of  dropout  compared
with the following treatment classes:

• SSRIs: RR 0.51 (0.35 to 0.73);
• SNRIs: RR 0.55 (0.32 to 0.92);
• TCAs: RR 0.63 (0.41 to 0.92).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

There were differences in the risk of dropout (although the 95% CrIs
crossed the equivalence range) for the following treatment classes:

versus placebo and in the fluoxetine versus placebo comparisons,
mostly due to the effect of small studies.

• BDZs versus MAOIs: RR 0.60 (0.32 to 1.07) - favours BDZs;
• TCAs versus SSRIs: RR 0.88 (0.66 to 1.12) - favours TCAs.

There was no difference in the risk of dropout (although the 95% CrI
cross the equivalence range) for the following treatment classes:

• SNRIs versus SSRIs: RR 0.96 (0.71 to 1.33).

It was unclear whether there was a difference in the risk of dropout
for  the  following  treatments  (95%  CrIs  crossed  the  equivalence
range in both directions):

• MAOIs versus SSRIs: RR 1.05 (0.58 to 1.76);
• TCAs versus SNRIs: RR 0.91 (0.61 to 1.31);
• MAOIs versus SNRIs: RR 1.10 (0.56 to 1.93);
• MAOIs versus TCAs: RR 1.20 (0.69 to 1.97).

Summary of main results

1. Individual interventions analysis

There  was  evidence  from  48  RCTs  (N  =  10,118)  that  most
medications  may  be  more  effective  in  the  response  outcome
than  placebo.  In  particular,  diazepam,  alprazolam,  clonazepam,
paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam
showed  the  strongest  effect,  with  diazepam,  alprazolam
and  clonazepam  ranking  as  the  most  effective.  Escitalopram,
imipramine,  fluvoxamine,  citalopram  and  sertraline  are  more
effective  than  placebo,  but  the  results  are  imprecise,  given  the
wider 95% CrIs. Desipramine, buspirone, ritanserin, etizolam and
reboxetine  do  not  seem  to  be  more  effective  than  placebo,  but
the  95%  CrIs  were  very  wide.  Heterogeneity  was  found  for  most
comparisons,  but  our  threshold  analyses  suggest  that  this  is
unlikely to impact the NMA findings. Out of the included trials, only
21 used a validated panic scale. The sensitivity analysis conducted
on the studies using a validated panic scale showed a slight increase
in  heterogeneity.  In  terms  of  ranking,  diazepam,  alprazolam  and
clonazepam ranked as most effective, followed by fluoxetine and
adinazolam. Paroxetine, venlafaxine and clomipramine ranked the
lowest.

Results from 64 RCTs (N = 12,310) suggest that most medications
were either associated with a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to
placebo. Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower
dropout  rate  compared  to  placebo  and  were  ranked  as  the  most
tolerated of all the medications examined. No difference in dropout
rate was found for venlafaxine, sertraline and paroxetine compared
with  placebo.  Buspirone  was  associated  with  a  higher  rate  of
dropouts and was ranked as the least tolerated medication. While
reboxetine,  escitalopram,  imipramine  and  citalopram  showed  a
reduction  in  dropout  rates  compared  to  placebo,  the  effects
are  imprecise  due  to  the  wide  95%  CrI.  Similarly,  clonazepam,
clomipramine,  fluvoxamine,  adinazolam,  desipramine,  fluoxetine
and  etizolam  did  not  show  any  difference  in  dropout  rates
compared to placebo, but the effects are imprecise due to the wide
95%  CrI.  The  dropout  outcome  showed  evidence  of  substantial
heterogeneity. Also, we identified incoherence in the desipramine

Thirty-two  RCTs  (N  =  8569)  were  included  in  the  remission
outcome.  Most  medications  seemed  to  be  more  effective  than
placebo, namely desipramine, fluoxetine, clonazepam, diazepam,
fluvoxamine,  imipramine,  venlafaxine  and  paroxetine,  and  their
effects  were  clinically  meaningful.  Amongst  these  medications,
desipramine and alprazolam were ranked the highest; fluoxetine,
clonazepam, diazepam, fluvoxamine and imipramine were ranked
in  the  middle;  venlafaxine  and  paroxetine  were  ranked  lowest.
Sertraline and escitalopram were more effective than placebo, but
their  effects  are  imprecise  due  to  the  wide  95%  CrI.  Citalopram,
buspirone  and  clomipramine  may  not  be  more  effective  than
placebo, but the 95% CrIs were very wide, indicating considerable
uncertainty.  Most  studies  did  not  include  a  validated  panic
scale.  However,  sensitivity  analysis,  including  studies  using  a
validated  panic  scale,  did  not  differ  substantially  from  the  main
analysis,  except  for  clonazepam,  the  effect  of  which  may  have
been  overestimated  by  a  high  placebo  non-response  rate,  and
fluvoxamine, which was less effective than placebo, compared to
the main analyses.

Thirty-five  RCTs  were  included  (N  =  8826)  for  the  continuous
outcome reduction in panic scale scores. Brofaromine, clonazepam
and  reboxetine  had  the  strongest  reductions  in  panic  symptoms
compared  to  placebo,  but  the  results  were  based  on  either  one
trial or very small trials. Clomipramine, imipramine and alprazolam
showed  evidence  of  a  reduction  in  panic  scale  scores  compared
to placebo, but the reductions showed a high level of imprecision.
Venlafaxine,  fluvoxamine,  paroxetine  and  adinazolam  showed
small  reductions  in  panic  scale  scores  compared  to  placebo.
Brofaromine  ranked  the  highest,  followed  by  clonazepam  and
reboxetine,  while  clomipramine,  imipramine  and  alprazolam  had
an intermediate ranking. However, these results are either based
on small trials or are imprecise. Venlafaxine, fluoxetine, paroxetine
and adinazolam showed the lowest ranking as they reduced panic
symptoms to a minor extent.

Forty-one RCTs are included (N = 7853) in the frequency of panic
attack  outcome.  Only  clonazepam  and  alprazolam  showed  a
strong  reduction  in  the  frequency  of  panic  attacks  compared
to  placebo,  and  were  ranked  as  highest.  Fluoxetine,  reboxetine,
paroxetine,  sertraline  and  venlafaxine  tended  to  reduce  panic
attacks,  but  the  CrIs  were  wide.  Weak  effects  were  found  for
clomipramine,  adinazolam,  imipramine,  desipramine,  diazepam
and  fluvoxamine.  Ranking  is  difficult  to  interpret  for  most
medications,  other  than  clonazepam  and  alprazolam,  due  to
imprecision.

Twenty-six  RCTs  (N  =  7044)  provided  data  for  agoraphobia.
The  strongest  reductions  in  agoraphobia  symptoms  were  found
for  citalopram,  reboxetine,  escitalopram,  clomipramine  and
diazepam, compared to placebo. Smaller effects were observed for
alprazolam, fluvoxamine, desipramine, paroxetine and imipramine
compared  to  placebo,  with  imprecise  results.  Negligible  or  small
effects  were  found  for  buspirone,  adinazolam  and  ritanserin,
compared to placebo, and the results were imprecise. Citalopram
and reboxetine were ranked as the highest in terms of reduction
in agoraphobia, while escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam
were ranked as less effective.

2. Pooled intervention classes

The two outcomes examined were the primary outcomes (response
and  dropout).  The  classes  of  medication  examined  were:  SSRIs,
SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs.

For  the  response  outcome,  all  classes  of  medications  examined
(SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, BDZs) seem to be more effective than
placebo.  TCAs  as  a  class  ranked  as  the  most  effective,  followed
by  BDZs  and  MAOIs.  SSRIs  as  a  class  ranked  fifth  on  average,
while  SNRIs  were  ranked  as  the  lowest.  However,  differences  in
rankings  do  not  reflect  substantial  differences  in  effectiveness
between  these  classes.  If  classes  of  medication  are  compared
with each other for the response outcome, no difference is found
between  classes.  Comparisons  between  MAOIs  and  TCAs  and
between  BDZs  and  TCAs  also  suggested  no  differences  between
these medications, but the results were imprecise.

For  the  dropout  outcome,  BDZs  were  the  only  class  associated
with  lower  dropout  compared  to  placebo,  and  they  were  ranked
as first in terms of tolerability. The other classes did not show any
difference in dropouts compared to placebo. In terms of ranking,
TCAs  are  on  average  second  to  BDZs,  followed  by  SNRIs,  then
by  SSRIs  and  lastly  by  MAOIs.  BDZs  were  associated  with  lower
dropout  rates  compared  to  SSRIs,  SNRIs  and  TCAs.  BDZs  were
also associated with lower dropout rates compared to MAOIs, but
the  results  were  imprecise  due  to  the  wide  95%  CrIs.  Similarly,
TCAs  were  associated  with  lower  dropout  rates  than  SSRIs,  but
the results were also imprecise due to wide 95% CrIs. SSRIs were
associated with the same risk of dropout as SNRIs, but the results
were  imprecise  due  to  the  wide  95%  CrIs.  It  was  not  possible  to
determine whether MAOIs were associated with a higher or lower
dropout compared to SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs, due to the 95% CrIs
crossing  the  equivalence  range  in  both  directions.  For  the  same
reason,  it  was  also  not  clear  whether  TCAs  were  associated  with
higher or lower dropout compared to SNRIs.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

The  patient  populations  of  the  included  studies  were  highly
selected.  For  example,  most  studies  excluded  patients  with
psychiatric  co-morbidities  or  patients  with  intake  of  other  drugs,
although panic disorder is highly comorbid with other psychiatric
disorders  (e.g.  drug  dependence,  major  depression,  bipolar  I
disorder,  social  phobia,  specific  phobia  and  generalised  anxiety
disorder)  (Grant  2006;  Preti  2016).  The  analysed  population  is
therefore  probably  not  fully  representative  of  patients  usually
seen  in  routine  practice,  and  the  results  of  this  review  may  not
automatically  apply  to  the  general  population.  Also,  although
the  studies  included  in  the  review  were  carried  out  in  different
countries  from  several  continents,  the  majority  of  studies  were
conducted in the USA and Europe and thus may be not transferable
to Asia, Africa and other regions of the world. Finally, the validity
of  the  outcome  used  to  measure  severity  of  panic  disorder  may
be  a  further  limitation.  Panic  disorder  is  a  multifaceted  disorder,
typically  characterised  by  panic  attacks  and  avoidance,  both  of
which  deteriorate  the  afflicted  person's  functioning,  but  the  two
may be compensatory of each other (e.g. when one is completely
agoraphobic,  one  may  be  free  of  panic  attacks).  More  recent
measures of panic disorder severity (e.g. the Panic Disorder Severity
Scale) take into account all of these aspects, but older studies often
focused on one aspect of the disorder and thus may have neglected

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

the other aspects. Our review was only able to synthesise what was
measured in the original studies.

For  the  antidepressant  versus  placebo  studies,  the  majority
of  RCTs  provided  data  for  the  primary  outcomes  specified  in
the  protocol,  allowing  us  to  include  a  considerable  number
of  studies  and  participants  in  the  analyses.  It  was  therefore
possible  to  generate  useful  information  on  the  efficacy  and
acceptability  of  antidepressants  in  comparison  with  placebo.  In
terms of applicability, considering the high number of studies and
participants,  we  can  argue  that  this  population  may  reflect  in  a
satisfactory way the characteristics of people with panic disorder
seen  in  'real-world'  settings,  despite  the  well-known  limitations
of  all  randomised  studies  that  should  always  be  acknowledged.
One limitation to generalisability may also be connected with the
exclusion of studies in which regular use of benzodiazepines was
allowed, since this practice might be common in real-life settings.

For  the  BDZs  versus  placebo  studies,  the  completeness  and
applicability  may  have  been  limited  by  various  factors.  Some
analyses  were  underpowered  (e.g.  number  of  participants
experiencing at least one adverse effect) because only a few studies
provided  appropriate  data  for  these  outcomes.  Moreover,  we  did
not  investigate  other  side  effects  of  BDZs  (cognitive  impairment,
risk  of  falls,  tolerance,  dependence,  less  optimal  reaction  time,
risk  of  dangers  when  using  instruments,  etc.),  which  may  have
limited  the  applicability  of  our  findings.  It  is  important  to  point
out the implications and consequences of longer BDZ use. A recent
population-based  study  reported  a  significant  excess  of  hospital
attendance for falls, fractures, long-term care admission and death
over a one-year follow-up period in continuous BDZs users relative
to  intermittent  users  after  a  180-day  index  period  (Davies  2022).
Unlike  the  issue  of  short-term  tolerability,  these  aspects  of  BDZ-
related adverse outcomes in the long term cannot be addressed in
the present review using data from randomised trials with a median
of  only  eight  weeks'  treatment.  Nevertheless,  in  younger  adults
not  at  immediate  risk  of  the  adverse  outcomes  described  above,
especially  those  with  no  history  of  substance  misuse,  BDZs,  with
their  good  short-term  tolerability  and  rapid  onset  of  action,  may
well have a useful role in the initial or short-term management of
panic disorder, when antidepressants may not be practicable after
initial management of panic disorder. However, it is worth noting
that  the  findings  presented  in  this  review  may  be  limited  by  the
low  quality  of  the  trials  comparing  BDZs  to  placebo  and  BDZs  to
antidepressants.

The 
and
benzodiazepines are not sufficient to comprehensively address the
objectives.  The  majority  of  studies  enrolled  a  very  small  number
of  participants  and  did  not  provide  data  for  all  the  outcomes
specified  in  the  protocol.  Only  short-term  data  on  acceptability
and adverse effects of antidepressants and benzodiazepines were
available. Clinically, this is a major limitation as long-term use of
benzodiazepines  is  controversial  due  to  concerns  about  adverse
psychological  and  physical  effects,  physical  dependence  and
withdrawal.  Similar  concerns  have  been  raised  about  long-term
exposure to antidepressants, in particular the SSRIs.

Quality of the evidence

The quality of the studies varied depending on the comparisons,
and was usually low or unclear.

For  the  studies  comparing  antidepressants  with  placebo,  the
overall methodological quality of the included studies was unclear.
No  study  showed  an  overall  low  risk  of  bias.  The  majority  of
studies showed mixed features, with a large prevalence of unclear
risk  of  bias  in  different  domains;  however,  this  may  reflect  a
lack of exhaustive reporting rather than clear evidence of bias. In
general,  confidence  in  the  estimates  of  effect  ranged  from  'low'
to  'moderate'  for  most  of  the  outcomes  assessed.  Study  findings
were generally quite precise, with small confidence intervals and
a high number of participants. Reasons to downgrade the quality
of the evidence were primarily due to limitations in the included
studies and inconsistency (heterogeneity between studies' results).
In agreement with this judgement, we argue that, for the primary
outcomes,  treatment  estimates  may  be  considered  quite  robust,
and  further  research  is  unlikely  to  change  our  confidence  in  the
estimate of effect.

For  the  studies  comparing  benzodiazepines  with  placebo,  the
overall  methodological  quality  of  the  included  studies  was  poor.
We  rated  all  studies  as  having  an  unclear  risk  of  bias  in  at  least
three  domains.  In  addition,  the  majority  of  the  studies  had  a
high  risk  of  bias  in  at  least  one  domain,  including  a  high  risk
of  attrition  bias  and  high  risk  of  bias  for  blinding  of  participants
and  physicians.  These  potential  biases  are  a  major  threat  to
the  validity  of  the  studies  included  in  this  review.  Most  studies
with  a  high  risk  of  attrition  bias  reported  unequal  dropout  rates
between  the  treatment  groups,  with  higher  rates  in  the  placebo
groups.  Furthermore,  participants  in  the  placebo  group  dropped
out  early  in  trials  comparing  benzodiazepines  and  placebo.  The
missing  data  are  thus  clearly  not  completely  random,  resulting
in  a  high  risk  of  an  underestimation  of  the  placebo  effect  and
therefore  of  an  overestimation  of  the  treatment  effect,  because
in  the  last  observation  carried  forward  analyses  participants  are
included with higher values in the placebo group, without taking
into  account  that  symptoms  usually  decline  over  time  (e.g.  due
to  the  natural  course  of  the  disorder,  regression  to  the  mean,
etc.).  Furthermore,  the  bias  may  be  reinforced  by  censorship  of
participant data at protocol violation in the first weeks, which was
a standard procedure accepted by the regulatory authorities in the
past.

For the studies comparing antidepressants with benzodiazepines,
the  overall  methodological  quality  of  the  included  studies  was
poor.  No  study  showed  an  overall  low  risk  of  bias.  The  majority
of  studies  showed  mixed  features,  with  a  large  prevalence  of
an  unclear  risk  of  bias  in  different  domains,  which  seems  to
reflect  a  lack  of  exhaustive  reporting  rather  than  clear  evidence
of  bias.  In  general,  the  confidence  in  the  estimate  of  effect
appeared  to  range  from  'very  low'  to  'moderate'  for  most  of  the
outcomes assessed. This judgement is primarily due to limitations
in  the  included  studies  (high  dropout  rates),  imprecision  (wide
confidence  intervals)  and  inconsistency  (heterogeneity  between
study  results).  In  accordance  with  that,  any  estimate  of  effect
should be considered very uncertain, and further research is very
likely  to  change  the  estimate  of  effect  and  thus  the  degree  of
confidence in its applicability in routine clinical practice.

Potential biases in the review process

Several potential biases have been identified in the review process.

The search and selection of the studies was done in the previous
Cochrane  head-to-head  comparisons  on  panic  disorder  (Bighelli

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

2016; Bighelli 2018; Breilmann 2019), as this NMA includes all the
studies selected in those reviews and no new studies.

Several  possible  limitations  of  this  review  should  be  highlighted
for all the studies. Some limitations are intrinsically related to the
actual  process  of  retrieving,  collecting,  selecting  and  extracting
data. In order to reduce the potential bias of this complex process,
two  review  authors  independently  worked  on  each  of  these
steps.  It  has  been  highlighted  that  two  independent  extractors
are  overall  more  reliable  than  extraction  performed  by  a  single
author  followed  by  verification  by  a  second  author.  We  applied
the  same  process  for  the  risk  of  bias  assessment.  Furthermore,
disagreements were always discussed with a third author. Another
relevant  problem  concerns  the  'systematic'  nature  of  the  search.
We chose to include only randomised studies as they provide the
strongest level of evidence available. In this type of review there is
some risk of publication bias, which means that negative studies
may not have been published. Although the search was thorough,
it  is  possible  that  we  may  not  have  identified  some  unpublished
studies, considering that there are no shared procedures to perform
this  kind  of  search.  It  is  expected  that  the  analysis  of  published
literature  only  would  lead  to  overestimation  of  the  efficacy  of  a
given intervention. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that some
included  studies  were  funded  by  the  pharmaceutical  industry,
and this may again introduce an overestimation of the efficacy of
interventions.

For  the  antidepressant  versus  placebo  comparisons,  we  formally
checked  the  presence  of  publication  bias  with  visual  inspection
of  funnel  plots  in  the  head-to-head  published  Cochrane  Review
(Bighelli  2018).  Regarding  the  primary  outcome,  'Failure  to
respond',  a  visual  inspection  of  the  funnel  plot  suggested  that
some studies with a low number of participants favouring placebo
against  TCAs  may  be  missing,  and  this  may  have  led  to  an
overestimation  of  the  efficacy  of  TCAs  compared  to  placebo.  For
the primary outcome, 'Total dropouts', a visual investigation of the
funnel plot suggested that some small  studies favouring  placebo
against  SSRIs  might  be  missing,  and  this  might  have  led  to  an
overestimation of the acceptability of SSRIs.

For the benzodiazepines versus placebo comparisons, we formally
checked  the  presence  of  publication  bias  with  visual  inspection
of  funnel  plots  in  the  head-to-head  published  Cochrane  Review
(Breilmann 2019). The funnel plots are indicative of the presence of
publication bias, and we identified only one unpublished trial for
inclusion in the review. Most of the included studies were published
more than 15 years ago, and the availability of information on the
licensing  procedures  of  these  drugs  is  very  limited.  Considering
that  for  some  individual  benzodiazepines  only  one  study  was
included, we think that it is rather likely that there are some other
unpublished trials.

For  the  antidepressants  versus  placebo  comparisons,  the  impact
of unpublished literature on the results of this review is uncertain,
however it is expected that an analysis of only published literature
would lead to overestimation of the efficacy of a given intervention.
We  did  not  check  this  formally  with  a  funnel  plot  analysis  in  the
Cochrane  head-to-head  review  (Bighelli  2016),  as  fewer  than  10
studies contributed to any analyses, thus making the funnel plot
methodology less informative.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

This  NMA  review 
is  based  on  the  Cochrane  head-to-head
comparisons on panic disorder published in previous years (Bighelli
2016;  Bighelli  2018;  Breilmann  2019).  The  Cochrane  head-to-
head review on antidepressants versus placebo in panic disorder
showed  that  antidepressants  as  a  group  are  more  effective  than
placebo, although the evidence was of low quality (Bighelli 2018).
Antidepressants  as  a  class  were  less  tolerated  than  placebo.  The
Cochrane  head-to-head  review  on  BDZs  versus  placebo  showed
that  BDZs  as  a  group  are  more  effective  than  placebo,  although
the  evidence  was  of  low  quality  (Breilmann  2019).  BDZs  as  a
class  were  more  tolerated  than  placebo.  The  Cochrane  head-
to-head  review  on  antidepressants  versus  BDZs  showed  that
antidepressants  as  a  class  were  not  more  or  less  effective  than
BDZs  (Bighelli  2016).  Remission  rates  showed  a  benefit  for  BDZs
compared  to  antidepressants,  but  the  effect  was  very  small  and
close  to  no  difference.  In  terms  of  tolerability,  the  review  found
evidence  suggesting  a  benefit  for  benzodiazepines  compared  to
antidepressants  when  looking  at  the  number  of  dropouts  due
to  any  cause.  The  methodology  in  this  NMA  allowed  us  to  rank
treatments,  which  was  an  advantage  compared  to  the  Cochrane
head-to-head  comparisons.  In  line  with  the  previous  Cochrane
head-to-head  meta-analyses,  antidepressants  and  BDZs  seem
effective compared to placebo. However, we found that some BDZs
ranked  higher,  if  compared  to  placebo,  in  terms  of  efficacy  and
tolerability,  except  for  remission  where  desipramine  ranked  as
high as alprazolam. For class comparisons, the head-to-head NMA
comparing antidepressants and BDZs did not show any difference
(Bighelli 2016). Our NMA, instead, ranked TCAs as the class with the
strongest  effect,  compared  to  placebo.  However,  in  line  with  the
Bighelli 2016 review, our NMA found no difference between classes
of medications for response outcomes. For tolerability outcomes,
in line with Bighelli 2016, BDZs were ranked as the most tolerated
class of medications for panic disorder.

Two other NMAs have been published on panic disorder (Chawla
2022; Du 2021). To our knowledge, these are the only other NMAs
published on the topic.

Du  2021  is  based  on  42  trials  comparing  antidepressants  and
BDZs (a lower number compared to our NMA), all published, and
also  included  single-blind  trials,  unlike  our  review.  This  review
did not adjust for small-study bias. Du and colleagues concluded
that  escitalopram  and  venlafaxine,  as  well  as  BDZs,  are  effective
choices for panic disorder. The findings of Du and colleagues are
similar  to  this  review,  although  they  compared  BDZs  as  a  class
with  other  individual  antidepressants.  We  also  found  that  most
antidepressants and BDZs were more effective than placebo, and
also  found  no  substantial  differences  between  these  medication
classes.

Chawla  2022  is  based  on  87  trials,  a  higher  number  of  trials
compared  to  our  NMA.  This  is  likely  explained  by  Chawla  and
colleagues'  broader  inclusion  criteria.  Our  review  only  included
monotherapy  of  antidepressants  and  BDZs  whereas  Chawla  and
colleagues  included  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy,  and
included further medication classes (azapirones, beta-blockers). A
further difference was that our review only included double-blind
trials, while Chawla and colleagues also included single-blind trials.
However, it should be noted that reporting of blinding was unclear
in  many  studies,  so  the  impact  of  this  inclusion  criterion  on  the

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

results  is  unclear.  Apart  from  the  studies  that  Chawla  included
but  were  ineligible  for  our  review  as  per  our  eligibility  criteria,
there  was  one  unpublished  study  that  we  had  missed  that  they
had  included  (Pfizer  2008).  By  contrast,  some  studies  seemed  to
be  eligible  as  per  their  study  protocol  but  were  not  included  in
their review. Whereas our current review adjusted for small-study
bias, the review by Chawla and colleagues did not. Given the large
number  of  small  studies  included  in  this  NMA,  and  the  potential
risk of bias identified, this is an important advantage of our current
review.  Chawla  and  colleagues  conclude  that  SSRIs  provide  high
rates of remission, with sertraline and escitalopram associated with
a  higher  remission  and  low  risk  of  adverse  events.  However,  the
authors  pointed  out  that  the  studies  had  moderate  to  very  low-
certainty levels of evidence, mostly as a result of within-study bias,
inconsistency  and  imprecision  of  the  findings  reported.  They  did
not recommend BDZs as first-line treatments due to the potential
risk of adverse events. They found that BDZs were more effective
than SSRI and SNRIs, whereas our review did not find substantial
differences  between  these  medication  classes.  This  difference  in
findings is probably accounted for by the bias adjustment used in
our analyses; in our unadjusted analyses we found similar effects to
Chawla and colleagues. We feel that the methodology used in our
review, such as limiting to double-blind studies and adjusting for
small-study effects, makes our findings more robust.

Implications for practice

This  Cochrane  Review  seems  to  suggest  that  selective  serotonin
reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs),  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake
inhibitors  (SNRIs)  (venlafaxine),  tricyclic  antidepressants  (TCAs),
mono-amine  oxidase  inhibitors  (MAOIs)  and  benzodiazepines
(BDZs)  may  be  effective,  with  little  difference  between  classes  in
terms of efficacy. However, it is important to note that the reliability
of these findings may be limited due to the overall low quality of
the  studies,  with  all  trials  rated  unclear  or  high  across  multiple
domains.

Within classes, some differences emerged. For example, amongst
the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine seem to have stronger evidence
of efficacy than sertraline. Benzodiazepines appear to have a small
but significant advantage in terms of tolerability (assessed by the
incidence of dropouts) over other classes over the time period of
the studies (median eight weeks).

Existing  guidelines  (Katzman  2014;  Baldwin  2014;  Andrews  2018)
and other systematic reviews on panic disorder (Chawla 2022; Du
2021)  favour  SSRIs  and  sometimes  the  SNRI  venlafaxine  as  first-
line treatment. In light of this, our findings bring up two issues for
clinicians to consider:

1. Amongst  SSRIs,  are  paroxetine  and  fluoxetine  preferable  to
sertraline  and  citalopram/escitalopram  on  the  basis  of  the
finding  of  slightly  better  efficacy?  However,  paroxetine  is
known  to  be  associated  with  difficult  withdrawal  and  is  a
strong  mechanistic  CYP2D6  inhibitor,  while  fluoxetine  and
its  metabolite  nor-fluoxetine  inhibit  a  range  of  important
cytochrome  (CYP)  enzymes,  increasing  the  likelihood  of  drug
interactions.  In  contrast,  sertraline  is  a  substrate  of  multiple
CYPs but a strong inhibitor of none and is not noted for problems
on withdrawal, so these benefits might offset the slightly weaker
evidence of efficacy.

2. BDZs  performed  well  on  efficacy  and  tolerability  in  the  time
frame examined here (4 to 24 weeks with a median of 8 weeks),
but  most  guidelines  advise  that  they  are  not  used  as  first-
line treatment. The British Association of Psychopharmacology
guidelines state that BDZs "will usually be reserved for the further
treatment of patients who have not responded to at least three
previous  treatments"  (Baldwin  2014).  Thus,  while  the  findings
for  BDZs  were  positive  in  terms  of  efficacy  and  tolerability  in
the  short  term,  the  limitation  that  we  could  not  examine  the
consequences  of  longer-term  use,  despite  there  being  well-
characterised  concerns,  means  that  the  evidence  reported  in
this  Cochrane  Review  is  insufficient  to  override  the  many
current treatment guidelines that suggest that BDZs may be a
less  desirable  choice  overall  than  SSRIs  and  SNRIs.  Moreover,
guidelines  encourage  prescribers  and  patients  to  keep  using
antidepressants as prophylaxis for periods of at least six months
to two years after response (Andrews 2018; Baldwin 2014; Cleare
2015; Katzman 2014).

Finally,  while  some  guidelines  recommend  other  drugs  such  as
buspirone, gabapentin and mirtazapine, there is a lack of positive
randomised evidence to support these drugs in panic disorder.

Another important point to bear in mind is the relationship between
pharmacological  treatments  and  psychotherapy  in  panic.  The
evidence  for  depression  points  in  the  direction  of  the  superiority
of  psychotherapy  (alone  or  in  combination  with  medications)
in  the  long  term  (Furukawa  2021).  It  will  be  important  not  to
discount the relevance of psychotherapy and its combination with
pharmacotherapy in the treatment of panic disorder.

Implications for research

Threshold  analyses  found  that  the  network  meta-analysis  (NMA)
results  were  relatively  robust  to  the 
impact  of  potential
biases.  Future  randomised  studies  may  not  add  much  to  our
overall  findings  comparing  all  medications  to  placebo  and
comparing  medication  classes.  However,  some  uncertainties
remain.  Comparisons  of  individual  medications  are  still  very
imprecise.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  networks  themselves
might not be fully mature, adding another layer of uncertainty to
the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  review.  In  addition,  few  studies
measured quality of life and social functioning.

An  important  limitation  of  this  NMA  is  the  fact  that  there  have
been limited studies in the past 15 years. Most clinical drug trials
of panic disorder date back to the 1980s and 1990s and there are
not many recent trials on panic. Research methodology may have
become more refined over time. It will be highly desirable to carry
out  new  trials  on  antidepressants  and  benzodiazepines  in  panic
disorders, possibly comparing them to novel treatments. A search
of ClinicalTrials.gov (2 March 2023) showed that there are very few
ongoing  clinical  studies  on  pharmacological  treatment  in  panic
disorder.

A  further  limitation  is  that  almost  all  the  studies  examined  in
this  NMA  were  of  short  duration.  This  may  have  had  some
implications  for  the  long-term  efficacy  in  a  clinical  setting  of  the
medication examined. For the BDZs, there has been a considerable
debate  about  whether  they  can  be  used  in  the  long  term  given
their  propensity  for  abuse,  possible  risk  of  tolerance  (Horowitz
2021),  and  the  existence  of  withdrawal  symptoms  (Allison  2003).
Some  authors  advocate  against  the  long-term  use  of  BDZs  in

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

any  case  (Horowitz  2021).  Nonetheless,  other  authors  have  been
more  open  to  the  idea  of  using  BDZs  in  case  other  treatments,
such  as  antidepressants,  fail  and  when  the  likelihood  of  abuse
is  low  (Hirschtritt  2021;  Silberman  2021).  Experts  belonging  to
the  International  Task  Force  on  BDZs  talk  about  a  "bias"  against
BDZs  (Silberman  2021):  they  say  that  the  evidence  that  BDZs
are  likely  to  be  abused  in  any  case,  that  they  create  tolerance
or  are  dangerous  in  overdose,  does  not  match  the  beliefs  many
clinicians  have  against  them  (Silberman  2021).  Antidepressants
seem  to  have  a  lower  propensity  for  abuse  (Fluyau  2022),  but
are also associated with withdrawal symptoms that can be severe
and possibly worse than BDZ withdrawal (Fava 2019). Their use is
not devoid of problems, as they may even worsen the conditions
they  are  supposed  to  treat  (Fava  2020).  Studies  where  BDZs
and  antidepressants  are  assessed  in  the  long  term  (i.e.  longer
than  a  year)  are  needed  for  anxiety  disorders,  as  the  efficacy
of  medications  in  anxiety  disorders  is  less  established  for  longer
durations.  BDZs  may  be  an  alternative  for  people  who  do  not
respond to antidepressants and/or psychotherapy.

Another  important  question  is:  are  BDZs  more  helpful  and  less
risky  in  the  long  term  if  they  are  only  taken  intermittently  (i.e.  a
few  times  per  week,  as  needed)  as  rescue  medications?  Studies
where regular versus intermittent use of BDZs in anxiety disorders
is compared will be particularly useful to guide the clinician to the
optimal course of treatment.

Finally,  it  will  be  important  to  systematically  assess  the  efficacy
of  medications  compared  to  psychotherapy,  perhaps  in  a  NMA.
Data  from  depression  seem  to  show  that  psychotherapies  can
lead  to  a  more  sustained  effect.  The  same  may  apply  to  anxiety
disorders in general and panic disorder in particular and needs to
be investigated. Psychotherapy can be a valid first-line alternative
or add-on treatment in panic disorder (Papola 2022), and needs to
be compared to medications in future research trials.

Dropouts: fluvoxamine group 29/93 (31.2%), placebo group 29/95 (30.5%).
There are high dropout rates in each arm. Reasons for leaving the study ear-
ly are relatively balanced between the 2 groups (see table 1). Quote: "Conclu-
sions were based on the last observation carried forward (LOCF) to the end of
the study analyses for the intention to treat population (all patients random-
ized to double-blind treatment who provided some on-drug efficacy data)".
However, the tables do not report the number of analysed participants.

The primary outcome is clearly reported in the methods, quote: "The primary
efficacy measurement, the DPAI, was designed to identify panic attacks". How-
ever, the DPAI scores are not reported in the text and tables. All other measure-
ments are reported.

Quote: "The authors thank Drs. R.I.H. and A.M. who were at Solvay Duphar for
their help in providing statistical assistance and a thorough review of the man-
uscript". A risk of sponsorship bias cannot be excluded.

considering dropouts for ineffectiveness. In the "statistical analysis" para-

Quote: " [...] we predicted that treatment with fluvoxamine would be more ef-
fective than placebo in reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks".
However, it is not clear which exactly is the primary outcome and how it was
assessed. Mean scores and SDs are clearly reported for the baseline assess-

Quote: "Out of 69 initial subjects, 57 subjects completed the study and 12
subjects dropped out. A higher rate of drop out was observed in the placebo
group compared with the other three groups. A chi-square analysis on these
dropout frequencies was significant. Separate chi-squares on each pair of
groups showed significant differences in between the placebo and alprazolam
groups, the placebo and PCT groups and the placebo and waiting-list groups.
Those who dropped from the study where compared with study completers
on major pre-treatment variables. Since all the placebo subjects dropped from
the study before completion of 3 weeks of treatment, endpoint analysis were
not conducted. (...) Since the placebo group had a disproportionate number of
dropouts, it is reasonable to argue that analysis of end state functioning that
includes only study completers represents a distortion of results. Given the
reasons and the rapidity with which most subjects dropped from the study, it
is likely that, at time of study withdrawal, dropouts maintained their pretreat-
ment low end state functioning status."

Dropout rates: venlafaxine arm 55/175 (31.4%); placebo arm 43/168 (25.6%).
Dropout rates are high in both arms and reasons for leaving the study early are
apparently balanced, according to Figure 1.

Quote: "The primary analysis population for efficacy variables was the in-
tent-to-treat (ITT) population". However, as reported in Figure 1, the ITT popu-
lation does not match with participants randomly assigned at baseline. Quote:
"Patients in the ITT population were those who had a baseline PAAS evalua-
tion and at least 1 double-blind, on-therapy evaluation of the primary effica-
cy variable during visits 3 to 10 and within 3 days of stopping the study med-
ication before taper". This is consistent with an 'as treated' analysis. In the ITT
population, imputations were performed with a LOCF approach.

The primary outcome measure is defined as "the percentage of patients free of
full-symptom panic attacks as measured with the Panic and Anticipatory Anxi-
ety Scale (PAAS)", however the precise time point of interest is not clearly spec-
ified. All relevant data are clearly reported in the text and tables.

Quote: "This clinical trial and analysis were sponsored by Wyeth Research, Col-
legeville, Pa". No other details on the role of funder in planning and conducting
the study are provided.

Only ITT population reported. There are inconsistencies in the reported N. Da-

balance in dropouts among the groups (drug 1 = 7, drug 2 = 12, placebo = 20).
Quote: "During the first 3 weeks of the study, 4.2% of the CT alprazolam, 14.3%
of the XR alprazolam and 14.7% of the placebo recipients dropped out of the
study after beginning medication from the total ITT group of 209 patients".
"However, there was a significantly higher dropout rate, probably because of
effectiveness, in the placebo group compared with the CT or XR groups".

The only information reported about dropouts is that 1 participant in the
placebo group was withdrawn from the study at week 8 because of lack of
efficacy. Other reasons for withdrawal are not discussed. Thus it is not clear
whether the 2 groups are still comparable or not after the dropout.

Data imputation is not clearly discussed, however apparently only completers
were analysed (consistent with 'per protocol analysis').

Selective reporting (re-
porting bias)

High risk

The measures of the primary outcome are not clearly specified and mean
scores for the scales are graphically reported in figures and only partially re-
ported in the text.

Other bias

Low risk

It is unlikely that sponsorship bias could have influenced the results.

the Dutch Foundation of Phobic Disorders, and the Laboratory of Biological
Psychiatry of the University Hospital Utrecht, head Mr A Klompmakers".

Appendix 1. Cochrane Specialised Register

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

The  Cochrane  Common  Mental  Disorders  Group  (CCMD)  maintains  an  archived  controlled  trials  register  known  as  the  CCMDCTR.  This
specialised register contains over 40,000 reference records (reports of RCTs) for anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, eating
disorders, self-harm and other mental disorders within the scope of this Group. The CCMDCTR is a partially studies-based register with
more than 50% of reference records tagged to around 12,500 individually PICO-coded study records. Reports of studies for inclusion in
the register were collated from (weekly) generic searches of key bibliographic databases to June 2016, which included: MEDLINE (1950
onwards), Embase (1974 onwards), PsycINFO (1967 onwards), quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of studies were also sourced from international trials registries,
drug  companies,  the  handsearching  of  key  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  other  (non-Cochrane)  systematic  reviews  and  meta-
analyses. An example of the core MEDLINE search is displayed below.

Records were screened for reports of RCTs within the scope of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group. Secondary reports of RCTs
were tagged to the appropriate study record.

The CCMDCTR-Studies Register was searched for a suite of panic reviews on condition alone.
Condition = panic
Records were manually screened for drug therapy trials.

The CCMDCTR-References Register was searched using a more sensitive set of free-text terms to identify additional untagged/uncoded
reports of RCTs. A further search was conducted to identify drug therapy trials for ‘Anxiety Disorders Not Otherwise Specified’ (ADNOS),
which may include a subset of participants with panic disorder.

The search of the CCMDCTR was conducted at several different time points, across a suite of associated panic reviews:

• Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults (all years to 26 March 2014, 11 September 2015 and 29 May 2018)
• Antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults (all years to 11 September 2015)
• Antidepressants versus placebo for panic disorder in adults (all years to May 2017)

Hence, for this review, the search in January 2021 was date-limited (2014 onwards).

While  conducting  our  systematic  review  of  antidepressants,  benzodiazepines  and  azapirones  to  treat  panic  disorder,  we  identified
inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in the network meta-analyses. We judged it important to explore the sources of this
inconsistency. This required a substantial addition to the methods proposed in the original protocol. Therefore, we updated our protocol
to outline the methods we planned to use to quantify and explore this inconsistency. For example, we had originally proposed to conduct
global tests of inconsistency to guide whether to use more intensive methods (node-splitting). However, since we were concerned about
potential inconsistency, we decided to conduct node-splitting and did not conduct global tests of inconsistency.

The protocol stated that bias-adjustment models would be conducted as sensitivity analyses. However, given the poor fit of standard
models, results from bias-adjustment models were reported as the main analyses as they fitted the data much better.

The protocol stated that we would not include studies using DSM-III criteria. However, since the other Cochrane pairwise meta-analyses
on which this NMA is based have included studies using DSM-III criteria, we decided to include these studies.

In addition, we had proposed to conduct sensitivity analyses where different doses were treated as separate nodes. However, given the
large number of meta-regression analyses and sensitivity analyses conducted we chose not to do this.

We initially planned to include studies with no useable data, but since these studies could not be entered in the analysis we decided to
exclude them.
