was positively related to ASD (pooled OR = 1.19 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.36)) and ADHD (pooled OR 
= 1.20 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.38)) in offspring. In the subgroup analysis, organophosphorus pesticides 
(OPs) (pooled OR = 1.14 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.24)), pyrethroid (pooled OR = 1.40 (95%CI: 1.09 to 
1.80)), and maternal age ≥30 years old (pooled OR = 1.24 (95%CI: 1.10 to 1.40)) increased the 
risk of ASD in offspring. Maternal organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) exposure was a risk factor 
for ADHD in offspring (pooled OR = 1.22 (95%CI: 1.03 to 1.45)).

Conclusion:  Maternal pesticide exposure increased the risk of ASD and ADHD in offspring. 
Moreover, OPs, pyrethroid, and maternal age ≥30 years old were found to be risk factors affecting 
children’s ASD. Maternal exposure to OCPs increased the risk of ADHD in offspring. Our 
findings contribute to our understanding of health risks related to maternal pesticide exposure and 
indicate that the in utero developmental period is a vulnerable window-of-susceptibility for ASD 
and ADHD risk in offspring. These findings should guide policies that limit maternal exposure to 
pesticides, especially for pregnant women living in agricultural areas.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
are two common neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) [1] characterized by learning 
challenges, as well as social and adaptive deficiencies that can persist throughout life. In 
recent years, the incidence of ASD and ADHD has been increasing globally. ASD has been 
demonstrated to affect roughly 3.14% of children and adolescents in the United States [2] 
and 2.64% of the general population [3], whereas ADHD has a significant influence on 
approximately 5.29% of school-age children [4] and 2.5% of adults [5]. It is difficult for 
children with both disorders in mastering adaptive skills necessary in adulthood [6], which 
places them at increased risk for employment difficulties and mental problems later in life 
[7].

Genetic [8, 9] and enviromnental [10, 11] factors are the key factors in the development 
of ASD and ADHD. Pesticides, a prevalent environmental contaminant, are applied to 
agricultural lands to protect crops from insects and weeds, boost crop yields, and protect

forests [12]. A wide range of pesticides is used worldwide and some pesticides have 
cumulation toxicity and can cross the placental barrier [13, 14], posing a threat to the fetus’ 
health and potentially increasing the risk of ASD and ADHD in offspring [15, 16]. Rauh 
et al. [17] discovered that chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure was negatively related to the risk 
of ADHD. Another study also found that children aged 4-5 years old exposed to pesticides 
during pregnancy were more likely to develop ASD [18]. However, on the contrary, other 
studies found that exposure to OCPs such as p,p′-DDE, and imidacloprid during pregnancy 
were not related to ASD and ADHD in children [19, 20]. Different types of pesticides can 
have different effects on offspring neurodevelopment including direct effects of pesticide 
exposure on fetal development and indirect effects through, for example, maternal factors 
which can act as catalysts for pesticide exposure effects on fetal neurodevelopment. There is 
an increasing trend in maternal age worldwide [21], and several population studies indicated 
that older maternal age increased the risk of ASD in offspring [22–24]. Overall, conclusions 
regarding the correlation between pesticides and ASD or ADHD were inconsistent, which 
might be influenced by the sample size, heterogeneous exposure, and outcome assessments. 
Considering the inconsistency and limitation of reported studies, in our study, a meta-
analysis was conducted to systematically estimate whether maternal pesticide exposure was 
correlated with ASD and ADHD in offspring.

In this study, we comprehensively and systematically compiled epidemiology data presently 
accessible to examine the correlation between pesticide exposure during pregnancy and ASD 
and ADHD in children. Moreover, subgroup analyses were performed to explore impacts 
of pesticide category and potential confounding factors including maternal age, window of 
exposure as well as type of assessment on children’s ASD and ADHD.

2.  Materials and methods

2.1.  Search strategy

Our meta-analysis was refined under the guideline of PRISMA [25]. Five databases 
including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, and PsycINFO were retrieved for 
all original studies published before August 30, 2022. The final search formula was as 
follows: (pesticides OR insecticides OR insect repellents OR organophosphorus pesticide 
OR organochlorine pesticide OR organophosphorus OR organochlorine OR chemical pest 
control OR fungicide OR herbicide OR insecticide OR molluscacide OR molluscicide 
OR rodenticide OR carbamate OR pyrethroid OR agricultural chemical) AND (autism 
spectrum disorder OR asperger syndrome OR autistic disorder OR autism OR ASD OR 
Attention Deficit Disorders with Hyperactivity OR attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
OR attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder OR attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder OR 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder OR ADHD).

2.2.  Study selection and eligibility criteria

Two reviewers separately retrieved studies using the search formula and extracted the 
relevant data from the included articles. Disagreements were thoroughly explored until 
consensus was reached. The criteria included in our study were as follows: (1) High-quality 
population studies, such as cohort studies and case-control studies; (2) ASD or ADHD

was treated as the outcome variable; (3) Outcome was diagnosed using clinical evaluation 
or self-report questionnaires. Specifically, ADHD was determined from the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 10 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM)-III, III-R, IV, and ASD was derived from DSM-III, III-R, IV, Autism 
Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised 
(ADI-R) diagnosis; (4) Results were shown as Odds Ratio (OR), Risk Ratio (RR) or Hazard 
Ratio (HR). Exclusion criterion was as follows: (1) Irrelevant studies; (2) Meta-analysis, 
review, comments, protocol or case report or books; (3) Animal or cell studies; (4) About 
treatment and method; (5) About postpartum or adult exposure; (6) Low (<6) Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale (NOS) score.

2.3.  Data extraction

The following characteristics from studies were included (Table S1, Table S2): author, 
publication year, country, study design, number of participants, maternal age, children’s age, 
neurodevelopment assessment, sample assessment, pesticides name, adjusted OR with 95% 
confidence interval (CI), and NOS score. The results will be converted to OR based on the 
solution provided by Shor et al. [26] when the results were presented as HR values. RR 
value was approximately equal to the OR value because of the low prevalence of ASD and 
ADHD [27]. In addition, we standardized the logarithmic conversion to log10 according to 
Liu et al. [28].

2.4.  Assessment of the risk of bias

NOS was used as the scoring system [29], which consists of three main parts: selection 
and comparability of study populations, a third component for determining outcomes in 
cohort studies, and exposure in case-control studies. In the NOS scoring system, 0-3 was 
considered as the low-level study, 4-6 as the medium level, and 7-9 as the high quality.

2.5.  Meta-analysis

In the analysis of ASD and ADHD, heterogeneity was measured by I2 statistic. When 
I2 was greater than 50%, a random effects model was used, while a fixed effects model 
was used when it was less than 50% [30]. Since the heterogeneity of ASD was found 
to be high, a random effects model was chosen for future analysis of ASD. Subgroup 
analyses were carried out on the ASD-related data, with maternal age (30 years old as 
cut-off), types of pesticide, window of exposure and types of sample assessment as the main 
subgroups presented. A subgroup analysis based on type of pesticide was conducted on the 
ADHD-related studies. A sensitivity analysis was also completed to check whether each 
article had a significant impact on the final results. Publication bias in articles was detected 
by using Begg’s test [31], trim and fill method [32], and funnel plot. All analyses in tins 
study were performed using Stata version 15 (College Station, TX, USA) and R (version 
4.2.2) in sensitivity analysis.

3.1.  Search results

Page 5

949 articles were retrieved through the search strategy, and 339 records remained after 
removing the duplicates (Fig. 1). After screening the title, abstract, and the methodology, 
277 records were excluded. Additional five studies were identified by hand-searching. 
Finally, 19 studies were included in our analysis, including seven on ADHD [17, 20, 33–37] 
and 11 on ASD [19, 38–47], as well as one study [48] describing both disorders.

3.2.  Study characteristics

From the 12 ASD-related studies, a total of 107,752 individuals were selected for our 
study (Table S1), with 24,761 of them diagnosed with ASD. Among included articles, 
seven [19, 39, 40, 42, 44, 46, 47] were case-control studies, and the remaining five studies 
[38, 41, 43, 45, 48] were cohort studies. These studies were conducted in four countries: 
USA (n=8), Finland (n=2), Jamaica (n=1), France (n=1). Seven [19, 38, 39, 43–45, 48] 
used quantifiable values as indications of exposure, including three maternal serum samples 
[19, 39, 44] and four maternal urine samples [38, 43, 45, 48]. The remaining five [40–
42, 46, 47] used approximated exposure levels assessed using the pesticide use report 
(PUR), socioeconomic status (SES) questionnaire, environmental exposure questionnaire, 
and department of environmental conservation (DEC) database. In these included studies, 
we investigated four categories of pesticides including OPs (chlorpyrifos, glyphosate), OCPs 
(p,p’-DDE), pyrethroid, and carbamates (imidacloprid).

From the eight ADHD-related studies, a total of 5,029 individuals were selected for our 
study with 974 were diagnosed with ADHD (Table S2). Among included articles, six were 
cohort studies [17, 20, 33, 35, 37, 48] and two were case-control studies [34, 36]. The eight 
articles included were conducted in five countries: USA (n=3), Denmark (n=2), Finland 
(n=1), Norway (n=1), South Africa (n=1). Four of the included articles collected maternal 
serum samples [17, 20, 33, 34] while the other studies used maternal urine samples [35–37, 
48]. The relevant studies included two categories of pesticides, three [20, 33, 34] focused on 
OCPs and five [17, 35–37, 48] on OPs. The NOS scores (Table S3, Table S4) of the included 
studies ranged from 6 (moderate) to 8 (high).

3.3.  Study findings from systematic review: associations of maternal pesticide exposure 
with ASD and ADHD in offspring

ASD:  Of 12 studies that assessed pesticide exposure, four studies reported significant 
positive associations with ASD. Shelton et al. found that maternal exposure to OPs show 
a positive correlation with ASD in children (pooled OR = 1.60 (95%CI: 1.02 to 2.51)) 
[46]. Exposure to pyrethroids was more likely to have a higher prevalence of ASD in 
Hicks et al.’s study (pooled OR = 1.37 (95%CI: 1.06 to 1.78)) [41]. However, Lyall et al. 
demonstrated that maternal exposure to p,p’-DDE was not significantly associated with ASD 
in offspring (pooled OR = 0.90 (95%CI: 0.57 to 1.42)) [44].

ADHD:  Of eight studies that assessed pesticide exposure, two studies reported significant 
positive associations with ADHD. Rauh et al. found that maternal exposure to CPF was

positively related to ADHD in children (pooled OR = 6.50 (95%CI: 1.09 to 38.69)) [17]. 
Dalsager et al. similarly concluded that maternal CPF exposure was significantly related 
to ADHD in children (pooled OR = 1.83 (95%CI: 1.13 to 2.96)) [35]. Whereas Strom et 
al. found that maternal exposure to p,p’-DDE did not correlated with ADHD in offspring 
(pooled OR = 0.91 (95%CI: 0.30 to 2.67)) [20].

3.3.1  Maternal pesticide exposure and children’s ASD: Twelve studies were included to 
determine whether maternal pesticide exposure was related to ASD in offspring. The pooled 
OR was 1.19 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.36) using random effect model (I2 = 72.1%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 
2a). The funnel-plot and Begg’s rank test indicated that the potential publication bias existed 
in included studies (p = 0.014, Fig. 2b). Then the trim-and-fill method was used (four studies 
filled), which showed that the significance of the association did not change indicating the 
reliability of our results (pooled OR = 3.10 (95%CI: 2.71 to 3.61) (Fig. S1). However, the 
high heterogeneity across the studies indicated the necessity for subgroup analysis. We used 
four subgroups as the main analysis including pesticides category, maternal age, window of 
exposure and method of exposure assessment.

3.3.2.  Maternal pesticide exposure and children’s ADHD: The Q-test results showed 
insignificant heterogeneity (p = 0.241 and I2 = 22.0%) across the included studies and then 
a fixed effects model was used. The pooled OR between maternal exposure to pesticides 
and children’s ADHD was 1.20 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.38) (Fig. 2c). These results indicated 
that maternal pesticide exposure was positively related to ADHD. In addition, the Begg’s 
funnel-plot and Begg’s rank test (p = 0.511) indicated no publication bias (Fig. 2d).

3.3.3.  Subgroup analysis for ASD and ADHD—Four subgroup analysis were 
conducted in ASD-related studies for: pesticides category, maternal age, window of 
exposure, and type of sample measurement. Subgroup analysis for pesticide category was 
performed in ADHD-related studies.

3.3.3.1.  Pesticides category and children’s ASD: Eleven included studies were grouped 
by pesticides category to clarify whether pesticide exposure during pregnancy was related 
to ASD in children. One study did not specify the type of pesticide [40] and was excluded 
from subgroup analysis. A total of four major categories of pesticides were included in these 
studies: OPs [43, 45–48], OCPs [19, 39, 44], pyrethroid [38, 41] and carbamates [42, 46, 
47]. OPs included CPF, glyphosate and DAP measured by serum and urine. OCPs included 
p,p’-DDE, and carbamates included imidacloprid. Maternal exposure to OPs (pooled OR 
=1.14 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.24)) and pyrethroid (pooled OR = 1.40 (95%CI: 1.09 to 1.80)) 
were positively related to ASD in offspring (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the OCPs and carbamates 
pesticide categories revealed no significant associations.

3.3.3.2.  Maternal age and children’s ASD: Nine studies were included to determine 
whether maternal age was correlated with ASD in offspring. Three articles were excluded 
since they did not include maternal age [41, 42], or maternal age could not precisely be 
determined [40]. Women in five studies [19, 38, 43, 45, 46] were no less than 30 years old, 
and the remaining four studies had maternal ages younger than 30 [39, 44, 47, 48]. Pesticide 
exposure in pregnant women no less than 30 years old was positively related to ASD in their

children (pooled OR = 1.24 (95%CI: 1.10 to 1.40)) compared to those younger than 30 years 
old (Fig. 3b). The results suggested that maternal age >30 years old increased the risk of 
ASD in children after pesticide exposure during pregnancy.

3.3.3.3  Window of exposure and children’s ASD: Four studies conducted the association 
of pesticides exposure and ASD in offspring according to the window of exposure [46]. 
Second and third trimesters were considered in two studies [38, 45]. Lyall et al.’s study only 
included the second trimester [44]. Results indicated that maternal pesticide exposure during 
the third trimester was positively related to ASD in offspring (pooled OR = 1.56 (95%CI: 
1.01 to 2.40) (Fig. S2).

3.3.3.4  Types of sample assessment and children’s ASD: Twelve studies were included 
in determining the association between the type of sample assessment and ASD in 
offspring. Five studies [40–42, 46, 47] used estimated exposure values, including PUR, 
SES questionnaire, environmental exposure questionnaire, and DEC database. Seven studies 
used GC/MS methods to detect levels of pesticides in serum [19, 39, 44] and urine [38, 43, 
45, 48] samples to assess pesticide exposure. Estimated (pooled OR = 1.19 (95%CI: 1.00 
to 1.42)) and measured (pooled OR = 1.19 (95%CI: 1.03 to 1.38)) values both revealed the 
effect of pesticide exposure in the development of ASD in children (Fig. S3).

3.3.3.5.  Pesticides category and children’s ADHD: Eight studies were included in the 
subgroup analysis based on types of pesticides for children’s ADHD. Three studies explored 
the relationship between maternal OCPs exposure and ADHD in offspring [20, 33, 34], and 
five studies focused on maternal OPs exposure [17, 35–37, 48]. Maternal OCPs exposure 
were positively associated with ADHD in offspring (pooled OR = 1.22 (95%CI: 1.03 to 
1.45) (Fig. 4).

3.4.  Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analyses were performed using the “leave-one-out ‘ approach. Omission of any 
study did not affect association between pesticide exposure and ASD (Fig. S4a). The result 
of sensitivity analysis showed that the overall estimate changed to nonsignificant when An et 
al.’s or Dalsager et al’s studies were excluded (Fig. S4b).

4.  Discussion

In our meta-analysis, 19 studies were summarized to clarify the correlation of maternal 
pesticide exposure with ASD and ADHD in offspring. Random effects model in ASD and 
fixed effects model in ADHD were used to conduct the quantitative synthesis. The findings 
revealed that maternal pesticide exposure was positively related to ASD and ADHD in 
children. Subgroup analysis indicated that maternal OCPs exposure increased the risk of 
ADHD in children. Maternal OPs and pyrethroid exposure during pregnancy or pregnant 
aged >30 years old was risk factors for ASD in offspring.

These findings are consistent with studies that showed that maternal pesticide exposure 
leads to an increase in ASD-related symptoms [49–51]. It is known that pregnancy is a 
critical period for fetal neurodevelopment, which is also the susceptible time window of

chemical exposure. During this period, certain pesticides such as OPs pass through the 
placental barrier and can directly affect fetal neurodevelopment [52, 53]. We found certain 
types of pesticide such as maternal OPs and pyrethroid exposure were positively associated 
with ASD in offspring. The potential mechanisms associated with maternal exposure to 
OPs and pyrethroids in the development of ASD in offspring were reported in previous 
animal and cellular studies. Maternal CPF exposure led to changes in the Prostaglandin E2 
(PGE2) pathway inducing oxidative stress, which may result in the occurrence of ASD-like 
behaviors [54]. In addition, glyphosate also showed a significantly correlation with ASD 
in offspring potentially regulated through upregulating soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) 
expression [55] and alterations in subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis [56]. Prenatal 
exposure of mice to pyrethroids inhibits angiogenesis and led to an increase in blood-brain 
barrier permeability [57]. These findings might help to explain the potential mechanisms 
by which maternal exposure to OPs and pyrethroids might increase the risk of ASD in 
offspring.

We found that maternal age had a great impact on the association of maternal pesticide 
exposure and ASD in children. The risk of ASD was higher in offspring whose mothers 
were older than 30 years of age at pregnancy. The potential reason is that older pregnancies 
may make the offspring more susceptible to hypoxia, which is a risk factor for ASD 
[58]. In addition, due to increased exposure time. higher levels of environmental toxins 
accumulated in older mother’s germ cells, resulting in an incidence in the levels of de novo 
mutations and epigenetic alterations [59], which was potentially detrimental to the fetus’s 
neurodevelopment. The heterogeneity was high in the subgroup of maternal age less than 
30, which was derived from the study of von Ehrenstein et al [47]. The measurement of 
pesticide exposure in their study was based on CA-PUR, where dietary and occupational 
pesticide exposure were not included which may underestimate the total exposure dose. 
Other studies used serum and mine samples to evaluate the exposure level, which more 
accurately reflected internal pesticide levels.

The subgroup analysis revealed that maternal pesticide exposure during the third trimester 
increased the risk of ASD in children. The third trimester is a critical period for 
neurodevelopment such as synapses [60, 61], and exposure to pesticides during this period 
may lead to neuroinflammation, which impairs synapse formation and neurotransmitter 
receptor formation. It is worth noting that maternal pesticide exposures by trimesters are 
correlated. Specific types of pesticides including organochlorine pesticides can accumulate 
in human tissues, reaching their maximum concentration in late pregnancy, which may 
explain the increased risk of ASD development in the third trimester. In addition, the 
limited number of studies that included pesticide exposure for each trimester may reduce 
the statistical power to detect trimester-level differences in the development of ASD in 
offspring. Adequate studies of time-varying associations are necessary before conclusions 
can be drawn about the critical window of exposure associated with increased risk of ASD.

In addition to types of pesticides, maternal age and window of exposure that affected 
the development of ASD in offspring, we found that the methods for measuring pesticide 
exposure varied in the type of exposure assessment. The results measured by the biomarker 
method and estimated by PUR and questionnaire both suggested that maternal pesticide

exposure positively correlated with ASD in offspring. Further studies with consistent high 
quality internal exposure assessment methods are warranted for the association.

The findings related to ADHD are consistent with previous studies that maternal exposure to 
pesticides is associated with the development of ADHD in offspring [62, 63]. Pesticide 
exposure-induced neuroinflammation with the reduced volume of cortical brain areas 
could be a risk factor in the development of ADHD [64–66]. Specific pesticides such as 
organochlorine could impair GABAergic neurodevelopment in mice, leading to deficits 
in neuronal differentiation and synaptic development [67]. However, the mechanisms 
associated with OCPs are not well investigated and more studies are needed for further 
exploration.

Our study has the following strengths. Firstly, we are the first to find that maternal age >30 
years old and pyrethroids increased the risk of ASD in offspring. Secondly, we standardized 
the calibration methods and units, which guaranteed the accurate evaluation of the statistics. 
Thirdly, we performed a trim and fill approach in studies with publication bias to evaluate 
the effect of publication bias on the result, which ensured the accuracy of results. Finally, 
107,752 participants were included in the ASD studies and 5,029 participants in ADHD 
studies, which ensured sufficient statistical power when conducting meta-analysis. However, 
some limitations still existed in our study. Firstly, pregnancy is a critical window period for 
neurodevelopmental abnormalities, but the effects of postnatal exposure cannot be ignored. 
Although many studies have controlled for postnatal variables, we could not rule out 
the possibility of postnatal bias in our study. Secondly, although we have included four 
major categories of pesticides, other types of pesticide such as acaricidethe, fungicides and 
rodenticide were not included in the studies used in our meta-analysis. We will conduct 
these analyses when adequate studies including these types of pesticides are available in the 
future.

5.  Conclusion

In conclusion, our findings showed that pesticide exposure during pregnancy was positively 
related to ASD and ADHD. OPs, pyrethroid exposure, and maternal age >30 years old were 
risk factors for children’s ASD. In addition, maternal OCPs exposure increased the risk 
of ADHD in offspring. Further research should integrate epidemiological and experimental 
studies to clarify basic mechanisms in the development of ASD and ADHD. The findings 
indicate that maternal pesticide exposure should be avoided, especially for older pregnant 
women in agricultural areas, to protect early brain development in offspring.

Necessary measures should be taken to protect gravida from pesticide 
exposure.
