for bipolar disorder

Abstract 
Background:  Although a growing body of literature highlights the potential benefit of smartphone-based mobile 
apps to aid in self-management and treatment of bipolar disorder, it is unclear whether such evidence-based apps are 
readily available and accessible to a user of the app store.

Results:  Using our systematic framework for the evaluation of mental health apps, we analyzed the accessibility, 
privacy, clinical foundation, features, and interoperability of the top-returned 100 apps for bipolar disorder. Only 56% 
of the apps mentioned bipolar disorder specifically in their title, description, or content. Only one app’s efficacy was 
supported in a peer-reviewed study, and 32 apps lacked privacy policies. The most common features provided were 
mood tracking, journaling, and psychoeducation.

Conclusions:  Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in the current digital environment for individuals seeking an 
evidence-based, clinically usable app for bipolar disorder. Although there have been academic advances in devel-
opment of digital interventions for bipolar disorder, this work has yet to be translated to the publicly available app 
marketplace. This unmet need of digital mood management underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation 
system of mental health apps, which we have endeavored to provide through our framework and accompanying 
database (apps.digitalpsych.org).

Background
With  the  rise  of  digital  tools  and  applications,  smart-
phone  apps  offer  promising  tools  to  augment  support 
and  self-management  for  individuals  with  bipolar  disor-
der  (BD).  With  a  prevalence  rate  of  > 1%  of  the  world’s 
population,  patients  who  need  chronic  illness  manage-
ment  may  not  have  access  to  subspeciality  clinics,  and 
primary  care  providers  are  increasingly  comfortable 
working  with this patient population,  provided  support-
ive  technology  to  facilitate  monitoring  and  follow-up. 
(Rowland  and  Marwaha  2018).  Studies  have  suggested

that, as of 2019, smartphone ownership among individu-
als  with  bipolar  disorder  exceeds  75%  (Hidalgo-Mazzei 
et al. 2019; Young et al. 2020), and there is evident inter-
est  in  app  use  among  individuals  with  BD,  with  40%  of 
young  adults  with  bipolar  disorder  having  used  an  app 
for symptom management and 79% of those not using an 
app wanting to try (Nicholas et al. 2017).

The feasibility and preliminary efficacy of mobile inter-
ventions  for  bipolar  disorder  have  been  validated  in  a 
variety  of  settings,  with  programs  including  a  personal 
digital  assistant  (Depp  et  al.  2010),  weekly  text-services, 
and  other  short-message  based  interventions  demon-
strating  evidence  of  benefit  (Bopp  et  al.  2010).  There 
is  a  robust  literature  base  of  both  internet-based  and 
smartphone-based  interventions  supporting  self-man-
agement  strategies  for  ongoing  monitoring,  education,

and maintaining hope (Gliddon et al. 2017). Smartphone 
apps  can  enable  both  active  (user-inputted)  and  pas-
sive  (automatically  collected)  data  collection  to  aid  in 
BD  diagnostics,  advance  evidence-based  treatments  like 
social  rhythm  therapy,  and  self-management  (Torous 
and  Powell  2015).  Software  applications  such  as  Mood 
Rhythm  and  MONARCA,  for  example,  use  sensors  and 
self-assessments in order to gain data about sleep, social 
activity, and mood to provide more information for both 
the  patients  and  their  clinicians  (Matthews  et  al.  2016). 
In  a  6-month,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  single-
blind,  parallel  group  trial  utilizing  MONARCA,  bipolar 
patients  who  used  the  app,  in  comparison  to  those  who 
did not, had fewer symptoms of mania, highlighting that 
both  active  and  passive  data  collection  may  meaning-
fully  augment  conventional  treatment  (Faurholt-Jepsen 
et  al.  2015).  A  study  involving  smartphone-based  moni-
toring  systems  in  conjunction  with  wrist  worn  acceler-
ometers  demonstrated  adequate  usability  and  feasibility 
(Faurholt-Jepsen  et  al.  2019a).  Indeed,  digital  phenotyp-
ing—deriving metrics like location and activity patterns, 
social  phone  utilization,  and  symptom  change—are 
emerging  as  mobile  target  interventions  for  BD  (Huck-
vale  et  al.  2019).  These  metrics  may  help  elucidate  digi-
tal biomarkers to detect both diagnostic mood status and 
symptom change (Ortiz and Grof 2016), ultimately facili-
tating the potential for early relapse detection (Jacobson 
et al. 2019; Faurholt-Jepsen et al. 2019b). Survey studies 
have indicated that individuals with bipolar disorder are 
interested in and open to using apps for illness manage-
ment,  including  apps  with  automatic  data  collection  to 
complement  traditional  user-inputted  metrics  (Daus 
et  al.  2018).  Digital  phenotyping  is  the  latest  promising 
avenue  of  exploration,  adding  to  the  robust  base  of  lit-
erature  supporting  the  efficacy  of  and  receptiveness  to 
smartphone interventions for BD.

However,  these  promising  research  findings  may  not 
translate into widely available apps that patients and cli-
nicians can use as tools today if these digital tools are not 
available to an end user of the app store. While a search 
on the app store yields numerous results with the “bipo-
lar” search term, it is unclear whether order in returned 
search is at all associated with app quality or clinical util-
ity.  Since  the  last  systematic  review  of  publicly  available 
apps for BD in 2015, which highlighted serious concerns 
around privacy, evidence, engagement, and potential for 
harm,  it  is  unknown  if  the  landscape  has  meaningfully 
changed  in  response  to  emerging  research  about  the 
potential of digital interventions for BD, and whether an 
average  app  store  user  is  now  more  able  to  access  qual-
ity, research-supported apps (Nicholas et al. 2015). Other 
excellent recent reviews have focused on the evidence for 
bipolar  disorders  apps  based  on  the  research  literature, 

but what is available and being offered to patients today 
in the public app marketplace is likely different than the 
subject  of  this  review  (Bauer  et  al.  2020).  We  intend  to 
address this lacuna in the existing literature: while recent 
work by our team and others has thoroughly investigated 
the  potential  of  apps  in  research  settings,  far  less  atten-
tion has been paid to what an app store end user is able 
to  find  and  access.  Advances  in  digital  health  research 
are promising, but without widespread translation to the 
broader public their impact is limited. We thus sought to 
examine  the  safety,  relevance,  and  clinical  utility  of  the 
apps that are most readily available for lay person seeking 
tools for BD, which is also understudied when compared 
to  technology  for  anxiety,  depression,  and  other  mental 
health conditions.

In  the  absence  of  strict  oversight  to  help  guide  users 
find appropriate tools in the app store, we have proposed 
an  enduring  and  reproducible  framework  to  guide  the 
evaluation  and  assessment  of  mobile  health  apps  (Hen-
son et al. 2019; Lagan et al. 2020). The framework is based 
on  the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s  app  evalu-
ation  model  which  has  been  well  studied  and  utilized 
(Martinengo  et  al.  2019;  Cohen  et  al.  2020;  Bergin  and 
Davies  2020;  Ondersma  and  Walters  2020;  Levine  et  al. 
2020). The framework comprises 105 different questions 
examining app accessibility, origin, functionality, privacy, 
features,  and  clinical  foundation,  ultimately  providing 
a  comprehensive  picture  of  app  quality  and  utility.  Each 
question  in  the  framework  corresponds  to  a  principle 
in  the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s  app  evolution 
model but now is reduced to a reproducible data point or 
number to encourage transparency and cultural respect. 
Seeking  to  identify  the  attributes  of  the  most  accessible 
apps  for  bipolar  disorder,  we  applied  this  framework  to 
the 100 top-returned apps on the Apple iOS store, inves-
tigating  a  wide  array  of  their  features  along  with  corre-
spondence to evidence-based principles of BD treatment 
and self-management.

Methods
Beyond  appearing  in  the  search,  there  was  no  inclusion 
criteria for app analysis, as an objective of this study was 
to  assess  the  features  of  the  most  readily  available  and 
easily findable apps for a layperson. On February 20, 2020 
the  term  “bipolar”  was  entered  into  the  iOS  app  store. 
Of  the  first  107  returned  apps,  nine  were  not  usable  (5 
required  an  access  code;  2  were  unavailable  in  English; 
2 became unavailable over the course  of the study). The 
remaining  98  apps  were  downloaded  onto  an  iPhone 
6  and  iPhone  8  for  complete  assessment.  Apps  that 
were not free to download were purchased by raters for 
analysis.

Each  app  was  assessed  by  at  least  two  raters  (AMR, 
ANR,  EL,  SL).  Apps  were  evaluated  based  on  our  pre-
viously  established  105  question  framework  created  in 
conjunction  with  the  American  Psychiatric  Association 
(APA). These 105 questions are based on the APA’s App 
Evaluation Model, with questions sorted into six catego-
ries:  Origin,  Functionality,  and  Accessibility  (31  ques-
tions);  Inputs  and  Outputs  (15  questions);  Privacy  and 
Security  (14  questions);  Evidence  and  Clinical  Founda-
tion  (8  questions);  Features  and  Engagement  Style  (31 
questions);  and  Interoperability  and  Data  Sharing  (6 
questions).  The  questions  are  all  objective  and  can  be 
coded  with  a  binary or  numeric answer. The  framework 
employed  thus  promotes  comprehensive  user  testing 
while minimizing subjectivity and providing transparent 
assessment  results.  The  ratings  for  each  individual  app 
are available upon request, and the apps suitable for men-
tal  health  and  wellness  use  are  included  in  the  database 
which  can  be  accessed  at  https ://apps.digit alpsy ch.org/
Apps.

All  raters  underwent  a  1-h  training  in  order  to  com-
plete  the  framework  questions.  Interrater  reliability  was 
assessed  using  Cohen’s  kappa  statistic  (McHugh  2012). 
Following  the  training,  the  majority  of  raters  demon-
strated very good interrater reliability (defined as a kappa 
value of above 0.75), with an average kappa of 0.84 across 
the  first  five  apps  rated.  Discrepancies  between  the  two 

raters  were  initially  addressed  one-by-one  in  discussion 
and used to clarify the description of each question, and 
subsequently  rectified  by  a  second  look  at  the  source  of 
the  discrepancy  (either  app  store  information,  privacy 
policy,  or  in-app  features  and  functionality).  All  train-
ing  materials  have  now  been  published  online  alongside 
the database, enabling any interested user to undergo the 
training and become an app rater. The resulting data was 
analyzed with descriptive statistics.

Results
Of  the  first  107  bipolar  disorder  related  apps,  nine  (8%) 
were  inaccessible  without  an  access  code  or  unavailable 
in  English,  and  thus,  a  total  of  98  iOS  bipolar  disorder 
apps were evaluated with our framework (Fig. 1).

In  the  iOS  Store,  apps  returned  on  a  search  bipolar

reflects  that  the  top  returned  apps  are  not  necessar-
ily  patient  facing  or  relevant  to  an  individual  with

bipolar  disorder.  Only  56  apps  (57%)  explicitly  men-
tioned  bipolar  disorder  in  their  app  description,  title, 
or content.

Origin and accessibility

The  framework’s  questions  around  origin  and  accessi-
bility  offer  a  comprehensive  picture  of  who  can  down-
load  and  access  the  app,  including  considerations  like 
availability across different platforms, cost, offline func-
tionality, last update, app size, and availability in differ-
ent languages.

Of  the  98  apps  top  returned  iOS  apps,  35  apps  were 
also  available  on  the  Google  Play  store.  72  apps  were 
free  to  download,  although  41  of  these  apps  required 
an in-app purchase or required a subscription to access 
the full swath of content. Of the 22 apps that were not 
free  to  download,  the  minimum  cost  was  $0.99  USD 
and the maximum cost was $49.99 USD with a median 
cost  of  $1.99.  Sixty  six  apps  did  not  require  an  active 
internet  connection  after  download  and  could  be 
accessed  offline,  while  32  apps  required  internet  con-
nection after download to access content.

Many of the apps were infrequently downloaded and 
not  currently  updated,  prompting  concern  given  that 
lack  of  update  in  the  last  180  days—a  metric  associ-
ated  with  lower  app  quality  (Wisniewski  et  al.  2019a). 
Only  38  apps  had  been  updated  in  the  last  180  days 
in  the  iOS  Store,  with  10  apps  still  in  the  first  version. 
The  average  rating  for  analyzed  apps  was  4.2  in  the 
iOS store and 4.0 in the Google Play store. 44 apps had 
over 20 reviews in the iOS store and 23 apps had over 
20 reviews in the Google Play store. The fact that more 
than  half  of  the  apps  available  on  iOS  had  fewer  than 
20  reviews  suggests  that  apps  returned  on  search  for 
BD  may  not  be  widely  downloaded  (the  iOS  app  store 
does not provide direct data on number of downloads). 
The  average  app  size  was  47.5  MB  in  the  Apple  Store 
and 20.6 MB in the Google Play store, and 20 apps were 
available  in  at  least  one  other  language  in  addition  to 
English,  with  the  majority  (n = 19)  of  these  offering 
Spanish functionality.

Regarding  app  origin,  only  two  apps  were  affiliated 
with  a  university  or  healthcare  organization,  and  both 
were treatment guideline apps intended for physicians. 
None  of  the  top  100  apps  had  government  affiliation, 
although several governmental organizations, including 
the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  and  Department 
of  Defense,  have  ventured  into  the  mental  health  app 
space and developed apps (Owen et al. 2018). None of 
the apps that had been assessed in research studies for 
effectiveness at BD management or treatment appeared 
in the top 100.

Inputs and outputs

Questions  about  inputs  and  outputs  help  illustrate  the 
kind  of  data  that  each  app  collects  and  returns  to  the 
user. The most common inputs among the 98 apps ana-
lyzed were surveys (n = 48), diaries or user inputted text 
entries  (n = 38),  geolocation  (n = 9),  and  camera  (n = 9). 
Six  of  the  apps  that  collected  geolocation  data  from  a 
user’s  phone  were  mood-tracking  apps,  while  two  were 
apps with a peer support or community forum. The most 
common  outputs  were  notifications  (n = 49),  summaries 
of data (n = 41), graphs of data (n = 40). 8 apps provided a 
link to formal care or coaching within the app itself.

Privacy and confidentiality

Privacy policies were available to the public in 66 of the 
98 apps, through either a link from the app store descrip-
tion or within the app itself. 27 apps (40.9%) of apps with 
privacy  policies  mentioned  the  disclosure  of  users’  per-
sonal information to third parties. Although several apps 
included  features  that  prompted  users  to  enter  personal 
health  information  such  as  medication  tracking  (n = 5) 
alongside  identifying  data,  only  one  app  claimed  to  be 
HIPAA compliant.

Clinical foundation

Questions  about  clinical  foundation  assess  each  app’s 
veracity  of  claims,  support  in  peer-reviewed  studies, 
and potential to cause harm. 93 apps in our analysis pro-
vided what they claimed, while 5 apps did not meet their 
claims,  failing  to  offer  the  features  that  were  advertised 
in  their  app  description.  One  app’s  description  read,  for 
example, “stimulate vital areas of the brain and heal natu-
rally…prepare yourself for Coronavirus!” despite provid-
ing  no  psychoeducation  or  links  to  information  about 
COVID-19  (Brainwaves  Psychological  2020).  Another 
claimed to provide meditation and yoga, but instead pri-
marily served as a game without offering comprehensive 
meditation modules.

Only  one  app  had  supporting  feasibility  and  efficacy 
studies,  with  7  Cups  of  Tea  backed  by  one  feasibility 
study (Baumel and Schueller 2016) and two efficacy stud-
ies  (Baumel  et  al.  2018;  Baumel  2015),  none  of  which 
involved  participants  with  bipolar  disorder  specifically. 
Although  another  app,  Daylio,  was  the  subject  of  an 
article  in  JMIR’s  mHealth  (Chaudhry  2016),  the  arti-
cle  offered  an  in  depth  description  of  the  app  without  a 
supporting feasibility or efficacy study and thus was not 
included in our analysis.

12  apps  were  rated  as  capable  of  causing  harm  to 
a  user.  11  of  these  potentially  harmful  apps  offered 
unmoderated  forums  or  information  that  was  trigger-
ing and not aligned with current treatment guidelines. 

Lagan et al. Int J Bipolar Disord            (2020) 8:39

One app, for example, encouraged users to “break the 
silence on your hopelessness and depression by speak-
ing  up  in  a  small  way  and  using  a  background  that 
reflects  your  inner  misery  and  despair”  and  provided 
phone  wallpapers  with  messages  including,  “I  disap-
point  myself ”  and  “I  don’t  like  what  I’m  becoming” 
(Wallpapers  2020).  The  other  app  was  a  “bipolar  test 
and  personality  quiz”  that  offered  users  a  “test”  for 
bipolar  disorder  (Bipolar  Test  2020).  The  questions, 
however,  did  not  align  with  the  clinically-validated 
Mood  Disorder  Questionnaire  (MDQ)  and  even  if  a 
user  obtained  a  result  confirming  they  were  at  high 
risk of BD, the app provided no links or references and 
did not direct users to a medical professional or other 
resources.

Features and engagement style

Mood-tracking, journaling, and psychoeducation were 
the  most  common  features  offered  by  apps  returned 
in  the  search  for  bipolar  disorder.  43  apps  offered 
mood-tracking, 41 apps provided a platform for journ-
aling,  and  19  apps  provided  psychoeducation  about 
either  BD  specifically  or  coping  strategies  and  treat-
ments  more  broadly.  The  most  common  engagement 
style  was  through  user-generated  data  (n = 44),  gami-
fication  (n = 23),  and  peer  support  (n = 13).  Features 
varied  significantly  as  a  function  of  cost  (χ2 = 15.982, 
p = 0.042), with apps that were totally free more likely 
to offer screeners or assessments, and apps with either 
up-front costs or in-app purchases more likely to pro-
vide meditation and mindfulness (Table 1, Fig. 2).

Discussion
Our  analysis  reveals  that  a  simple  app  store  search  may 
not be sufficient for an individual seeking to find an app 
suitable to BD education, management, or treatment, as 
many  apps  in  the  top  100—including  paid  apps—were 
irrelevant  or  raised  concerns  that  warrant  a  cautious 
approach to app selection.

Some apps offered harmful or misleading content. The 
order  that  the  search  returned  apps  was  not  indicative 
of  clinical  utility,  as  some  misleading,  stigmatizing,  and 
dangerous apps appeared before apps with features suit-
able to BD management and treatment. One app encour-
aged  users  to  “break  the  silence  on  your  hopelessness 
and depression by speaking up in a small way and using 
a background that reflects your inner misery and despair”

and provided phone wallpapers with messages including, 
“I  disappoint  myself ”  and  “I  don’t  like  what  I’m  becom-
ing”  (Wallpapers  2020).  Another  app’s  description  read, 
“stimulate vital areas of the brain and heal naturally…pre-
pare yourself for Coronavirus!” despite providing no psy-
choeducation  or  links  to  information  about  COVID-19 
(Brainwaves Psychological 2020). One app offered no fea-
tures besides downloadable stickers of an “unpredictable 
bipolar  bear”  depicted  in  cartoon  imagery  (The  Bipolar 
Bear Bonacorso 2020).

Only  one  app  that  appeared  in  the  search  had  support-
ing  feasibility  and  efficacy  studies,  and  even  those  peer-
reviewed  publications  did  not  involve  individuals  with 
Bipolar Disorder, instead focusing on the app’s ability to mit-
igate  symptoms  of  depression.  While  the  overtly  incorrect 
claims by some apps are a serious area of concern, even sub-
tler claims made by commercial apps, such as “manage your 
symptoms of Bipolar Disorder!” should be approached cau-
tiously given the lack of evidence across all returned apps.

Another  challenge  was  that  some  apps  offered  what 
appeared  to  be  evidence-based  interventions,  but  upon 
closer inspection were likely not. For example, thirteen apps 
claimed to offer peer support in some form; nine of them, 
however, did so via unmoderated forums, where users were 
able to post and view content posted on a public forum, or 
the  “moderators”  did  not  intervene  until  after  a  comment 
was  reported.  One  mood  tracking  app,  for  example,  auto-
matically  published  all  mood  and  diary  entries  to  a  public 
newsfeed and required an in-app purchase in order to access 
a  private  diary  that  would  not  be  published  (Moodtrack 
Social Diary 2020). In all of these apps, the risk of triggering, 
non  clinically-useful  content  was  concerning. The  concept 
of  peer  support  was  also  defined  loosely.  While  certified 
peer  specialists  have  been  shown  to  improve  treatment 
outcomes  across  a  range  of  mental  health  conditions  (Fel-
ton et al. 1995), no apps we reviewed utilized certified peer 
specialists,  instead  defining  “peer”  to  be  anyone  else  using 
the app. Integrating peer specialist support into technology 
is a continuing area of research, with preliminary evidence 
of both feasibility and efficacy, but our analysis reveals that 
these advances in peer specialist technology research have 
yet to be translated to the area of publicly available BD apps 
(Fortuna et al. 2018).

The lack of privacy policies and specifically and the lack 
of  HIPAA  compliant  apps  further  underscores  the  neces-
sity  of  a  cautious  approach  to  app  selection.  Previous  lit-
erature  has  highlighted  the  numerous  risks  around  data 
disclosure of behavioral data by mental health apps (Bauer 
et al. 2017). Our  study of  98 BD apps  found  that  32.7% of 
apps did not have a privacy policy readily available to users 
either through the App Store or in the app itself. Moreover, 
of the apps with a privacy policy, the average reading grade 
level was 12.1 (SD 2.5), with only 7 apps having a grade level 

of 9th grade or lower and 34 apps having a collegiate read-
ing grade level or higher. While privacy and security remain 
important features to users (Dehling et al. 2015), the lack of 
transparent  policies  that  require  college-level  literacy  indi-
cate the need to improve the state of privacy and transpar-
ency among BD apps.

Comparison with prior work

This  study  builds  upon  numerous  prior  efforts  in  the 
area of mental health apps, allowing an analysis of poten-
tial  changes  in  the  space.  Compared  to  the  review  of 
BD  apps  in  2015  by  Nicholas  et  al.,  we  employed  fewer 
search terms, utilizing only “bipolar” instead of “bipolar,” 
“manic depression”, “mood swings”, and “mood.” By using 
this singular search term, our objective was to assess the 
apps  that  would  be  most  readily  accessible  for  an  indi-
vidual  searching  for  a  BD  app.  When  including  the  top 
98  returned  apps  in  our  analysis,  we  found  that  43%  of 
apps did not even mention Bipolar Disorder in their app 
title,  description,  or  content.  Like  Nicholas  et  al.,  we 
found  symptom  monitoring  tools  such  as  mood-track-
ing and journaling to be most common among reviewed 
apps;  in  contrast  to  the  2015,  review,  however,  we  iden-
tified  13  apps  providing  community  or  peer  support—a 
significant  increase  from  the  4  such  apps  five  years  ago. 
Another  major  improvement  is  around  privacy  policies. 
A striking finding from Nicholas et al. was that only 18 or 
82 apps had a privacy policy—a figure that has noticeably 
advanced, with 66 of the 98 apps we reviewed now pos-
sessing a privacy policy. Our team has done smaller app 
evaluation studies were we looked at the top 10 apps for 
bipolar disorder as returned by an app store-search (and 
other  conditions),  but  results  here  are  different  as  they 
seek  to  quantify  the  state  of  the  field  beyond  the  high-
lights of the app stores (Wisniewski et al. 2019b; Mercu-
rio et al. 2020).

In  terms  of  evidence-based  apps,  however,  the  com-
mercial  app  space  has  not  significantly  progressed:  as 
in  the  2015  review  by  Nicholas  et  al.,  we  identified  just 
one app supported by feasibility or efficacy studies. This 
finding  suggests  that  research  around  digital  tools  for 
Bipolar Disorder has not been translated into many evi-
dence-based,  clinically  relevant  apps  on  the  app  store. 
As  the  need  for  digital  resources  becomes  increasingly 
urgent in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the app 
store content most available to end users is of the utmost 
importance.

Overall,  while  our  analysis  demonstrates  that  some 
strides  have  been  made  in  the  landscape  of  apps  for 
bipolar  disorder  since  2015,  a  noticeable  gap  between 
research  and  practice  is  still  present.  Despite  the  body 
of research highlighting the potential of apps to support 
individuals  with  bipolar  disorder,  such  research  has  yet

to be translated to the publicly available app marketplace, 
where  only  one  app  that  appears  in  a  user’s  search  for 
“bipolar” is backed by supporting studies. Although there 
is  evidence  that  individuals  with  bipolar  disorder  are 
interested  in  apps  with  automatic  data  collection  to  aid 
in  symptom  management,  few  of  the  apps  utilized  pas-
sive  data  (Daus  et  al.  2018).  And  while  the  effectiveness 
of peer support has received growing attention, available 
“peer support” apps have yet to progress beyond a poten-
tially triggering community forum model. If the potential 
of  technology  is  to  be  fully  harnessed,  research-backed 
apps must be made available to the public, and a compre-
hensive app evaluation system is urgent in light of limited 
regulation from the app stores.

Limitations

This study employed a single search term, “bipolar,” as we 
sought  to  analyze  the  most  immediately  accessible  apps 
for  a  layperson  seeking  BD  resources  in  the  app  store. 
Utilizing  this  limited  search  term,  however,  prevented  a 
full perusal of apps that may be relevant for an individual 
with  bipolar  disorder;  it  is  possible  that  mood-tracking, 
mindfulness,  and  other  tools  for  self-management  may 
not  explicitly  reference  BD  at  all  but  nonetheless  offer 
clinical benefit. For example, the app HealthRhythms was 
designed to target bipolar disorder but does not return in 
any  search  for  the  term  (Measure  Health  2020).  Recog-
nizing the limited scope of this work, we view our analy-
sis  as  a  marker  of  the  current  state  of  the  field  and  call 
for better processes in finding a relevant, clinically usable 
app  via  the  app  store  for  an  individual  seeking  resource 
for  Bipolar  Disorder. This  review  is  just  one  component 
of our broader effort to link clinicians and patients with 
safe,  effective  apps.  Our  database  of  mental  health  apps 
enables  users  to  filter  and  find  apps  based  on  desired 
characteristics  and  thus  connects  individuals  to  tailored 
tools  more  effectively  than  a  simple  app  store  search 
(Nicholas et al. 2015).

Additional  limitations  arise  from  individual  differ-
ences  in  the  algorithm  that  determines  which  apps 
appear in what order on an iOS store search. The algo-
rithm in fact changes daily, as a search a week later con-
ducted on the same phone yielded the same apps but in 
a  slightly  different  order.  A  growing  body  of  literature 
highlights the rampant turnover characterizing the app 
space,  with,  for  example,  a  clinically  relevant  app  for 
depression  becoming  available  every  2.9  days  (Larsen 
et al. 2016). Given the dynamic nature of the app store, 
and  the  increasing  focus  on  developing  technology  to 
support mental health (Monteith et al. 2016), it is pos-
sible that clinically relevant apps for BD have emerged 
in between drafting and publication of this study.

Conclusion
Despite  both  the  continued  proliferation  of  mental 
health  apps  and  promising  research  around  the  efficacy 
of  smartphone  apps  for  management  and  treatment  of 
bipolar disorder, our study highlights how it remains dif-
ficult  for  an  individual  seeking  a  relevant  app  for  BD  to 
find  an  appropriate  tool  in  the  app  store.  The  primary 
shortcoming is that users must wade through irrelevant, 
misleading, and even potentially dangerous apps to find a 
relevant one. The lack of privacy protection and transpar-
ency around user data, along with the lack of supporting 
evidence among available apps and potential for mislead-
ing content, all raise concerns about the most accessible 
public  facing  apps  and  highlight  the  need  for  a  way  to 
evaluate apps beyond app store metrics.

We  employed  a  framework  for  app  assessment  that 
is research based and entirely reproducible, paving the 
way  for  future  analyses  of  health  apps  and  providing  a 
tool  to  help  clinicians,  patients,  and  the  wider  public 
reap the benefits of digital health. All of our results are 
available to the public on our database that is informed 
by our evaluation model. Recognizing the limitations of 
this  study,  we  regularly  update  our  database  to  reflect 
the changing nature of available apps and emergence of 
new  ones.  We  encourage  crowd-sourcing  and  collabo-
ration  around  app  evaluation  in  order  to  provide  clar-
ity amidst the profusion of available apps for end users, 
ultimately equipping them to make an informed choice 
around an app to help them meet their goals.
