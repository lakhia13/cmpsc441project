Abstract
Purpose of Review  This review presents new research pertinent to youth suicide prevention with a focus on suicide risk 
screening; therapeutic interventions, including Crisis Lifeline services; the identification of proximal risk or warning signs; 
and guidelines for youth discussions of suicide-related concerns on social media.
Recent Findings  Universal screening for youth suicide risk is feasible in healthcare settings, identifies previously unrecog-
nized risk, and has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of suicide attempts. Recent large scale intervention 
trials have neither identified new effective treatments nor ways to make current treatments more effective. In other recent 
studies, however, youth and parents have independently identified suicidal communications, withdrawal from people and/or 
usual activities, and sleep problems as acute warning signs.
Summary  Universal screening for youth suicide risk is recommended in healthcare settings. It identifies previously unrec-
ognized risk at a reasonable cost. Regarding therapeutic interventions, additional research is needed to identify subgroups 
of youth that may benefit from specific interventions and to personalize these interventions for improved effectiveness in a 
way that is feasible and scalable in real world settings. Finally, research has identified acute or proximal warning signs for 
adolescent suicide attempts, and widescale dissemination of this information is recommended..

  Introduction

Designated a national priority in the United States nearly a 
quarter century ago [1], suicide prevention continues to be 
a public health imperative. Suicide is currently the second 
leading  cause  of  death  among  youth  in  the  United  States 
[2], and, as is evident in Fig. 1, the number of adolescents 
reporting suicidal thoughts and behaviors has risen signifi-
cantly  over  the  past  20  years  [3]. This  is  particularly  pro-
nounced for identifiable subgroups such as Black youth, for 
whom the suicide rate has increased sharply (54% between 
2018 and 2022) [4]. Despite substantial effort, we have been 
unable to move the youth suicide rate downward in a sig-
nificant and sustained manner. Suicide is widely considered

to  be  a  preventable,  albeit  frustratingly  intractable,  public 
health problem.

Many  scientists,  including  clinical  investigators,  are 
working  to  inform  the  development  and  implementation 
of evidence-based suicide prevention strategies. Facilitated 
by  funding  from  federal  agencies  (e.g.,  National  Institute 
of Mental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion)  and  private  foundations  (e.g.,  American  Foundation 
for  Suicide  Prevention),  the  breadth  of  initiatives  under 
investigation  are  consistent  with  the  wide  angled  public 
health  approach  described  in  Suicide  Prevention  Resource 
for  Action:  A  Compilation  of  the  Best  Available  Evidence 
[5]. These range from more universal prevention strategies, 
implemented in school, community, and healthcare settings, 
to more targeted clinical interventions for youth at high risk.
In this review, we focus on recently published research 
that meaningfully informs our collective efforts to prevent 
youth suicide. These studies focus on the screening and rec-
ognition of youth at risk for suicide in healthcare settings; 
therapeutic  interventions  provided  in  multiple  settings  as 
well as the more broadly available Crisis Lifeline services;

and  the  identification  of  warning  signs  of  acute  proximal 
risk for suicide (applicable across school, community, and 
healthcare settings); We also present a new area of research 
investigation  involving  the  development  of  guidelines  for 
youth discussions of suicide-related issues on social media.

Youth Suicide Risk Screening in Healthcare 
Settings

Youth suicide risk screening has the potential to save lives 
when implemented as one component of a clinical pathway 
that includes further assessment and referral for treatment. 
There is a growing evidence base regarding the strength of 
available suicide risk screening instruments (e.g. [6, 7]), and 
a consensus that universal screening for youth suicide risk 
can be effectively implemented in emergency departments 
and other healthcare settings [8].

The evidence in support of youth suicide risk screening 
in  healthcare  settings  has  grown  substantially  since  early 
studies demonstrating the feasibility of universal screening 
and  the  ability  of  screening  to  detect  previously  unrecog-
nized risk [9, 10]. Until recently, however, most studies of 
screening  instruments  were  either  cross-sectional,  report-
ing screen sensitivity and sensitivity in terms of concurrent 
suicidal  ideation  (e.g.  [9]),  or  they  reported  outcome  data 
only on those who screened positive, limiting the possibil-
ity  of  examining  predictive  validity  (e.g.  [11]).  With  the 
relatively recent and large-scale NIMH-funded Emergency 

Department  Screening  for Teens  at  Risk  for  Suicide  (ED-
STARS) study, we now have a wealth of data enabling us to 
explore, prospectively, the suicide attempt outcomes associ-
ated with positive and negative screens [6].

Emergency  Department-Based  Suicide  Risk  Screening. 
Two  recent  ED-STARS  research  reports  are  particularly 
notable due to this study’s prospective research design and 
large,  geographically  diverse  sample.  Brent  et  al.  (2023) 
compared the predictive validity of the Ask Suicide Screen-
ing  Questions  (ASQ  [9]),  and  the  Computerized Adaptive 
Screen for Youth Suicide Risk, (CASSY [6]) in relation to 
suicide  attempt  outcomes  within  three  months  of  adoles-
cents’  ED  visits  [7].  The ASQ  is  a  4-item  self-report  sur-
vey  with  a  positive  screen  defined  as  a  positive  response 
or  nonresponse  to  any  one  or  more  items. The  CASSY  is 
a  computerized  adaptive  screen  that  includes  three  of  the 
ASQ  items  and  additional  items  that  vary  depending  on 
responses  to  prior  items  (mean  of  11  items  per  youth).  In 
the  ED-STARS  validation  study,  2,740  youth  completed 
screenings  and  follow-ups.  The  performance  of  the  ASQ 
and  CASSY  (e.g.,  sensitivity,  specificity)  did  not  differ 
significantly  for  patients  who  did  not  present  with  behav-
ioral health chief complaints [7]; however, the CASSY per-
formed significantly better for adolescents with behavioral 
health chief complaints. A choice between these two screen-
ing  instruments  requires  balancing  several  considerations. 
The ASQ  has  the  advantage  of  being  in  the  public  sector 
and readily available, whereas the CASSY requires comput-
erized  tablets  and  a  licensing  agreement  (cost).  Given  the 

Current Psychiatry Reports (2025) 27:500–5081 3 
502

growing number of adolescents presenting to medical emer-
gency  departments  with  behavioral  health  and  psychiatric 
concerns, the greater strength of the CASSY with this group 
may  be  an  important  consideration. As  noted  in  the  Blue-
print for Youth Suicide Prevention [8], other tools such as 
the triage version of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS [12]), have previously documented validity 
and are also available.

  The  cost  of  universal  suicide  risk  screening  is  a  criti-
cally important issue for healthcare systems. A recent cost 
analysis of adolescent suicide risk screening in the ED was 
completed  with  the  large  and  geographically  diverse  ED-
STARS sample [13]. When the CASSY was used as a uni-
versal screen for all adolescent ED patients able to complete 
a  self-report  survey,  the  cost  of  screening  per  adolescent, 
including  the  cost  of  mental health  follow-up  evaluations, 
was  $5.77  per  adolescent.  This  micro-analysis  considered 
site-specific personnel and resource costs from the time of 
the adolescent’s admission through their discharge or hospi-
talization, making the findings reasonably generalizable to 
other self-report screening tools. [It did not include the cost 
of CASSY software or program integration with electronic 
health  record.]  When  analyzed  only  for  those  adolescents 
who presented with non-psychiatric chief complaints (ado-
lescents who would not routinely be screened and receive 
mental  health  evaluations,  as  needed),  the  cost  was  only 
$2.60 per adolescent. Given that suicide is the second lead-
ing cause of death among adolescents, suicide risk screen-
ing would seem to be a justifiable service, particularly given 
the relatively low cost demonstrated in this study.

Therapeutic Interventions

Comprehensive  meta-analytic  [22,  23]  and  systematic 
review [24, 25, 26] studies published in the past decade high-
light existing interventions for youth with suicidal ideation 
or behavior that vary in treatment modality, targets, as well 
as evidence base supporting their effectiveness. A persistent 
challenge  concerning  intervening  with  adolescents  at  risk 
for suicide is that few psychosocial interventions have dem-
onstrated to be effective [22, 27, 28]. To date, the treatment 
with most empirical support is Dialectical Behavioral Ther-
apy (DBT-A) [29, 30], although even this well-established 
intervention  showed  benefits  that  were  not  sustained  over 
time [29]. Yet, the prevalence of adolescent suicidal ideation 
and behavior clearly make them a treatment priority. In this 
section, we summarize recent randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) in which the primary focus was prevention of sui-
cidal ideation or suicidal behavior.

First, an RCT involving adolescents, ages 12–18, hospi-
talized for suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts assessed 

the  efficacy  of  a  brief  therapist-delivered  intervention  (As 
Safe As  Possible  or ASAP),  a  safety  plan  mobile  applica-
tion  (BRITE  app),  and  their  combination  (ASAP + BRITE 
app) [31]. The therapist delivered ASAP was grounded in an 
MI framework, focused on safety planning and skill acquisi-
tion,  while  the  BRITE  app  included  a  personalized  safety 
plan  along  with  emotion  regulation  and  distress  tolerance 
skills.  Moreover,  as  part  of  the ASAP  and/or  BRITE  app, 
adolescents and their caregivers received two brief follow-
up calls. Adolescents (n = 240) were randomized to one of 
four  groups: ASAP  with  BRITE  app,  BRITE  app, ASAP, 
or  treatment  as  usual  (TAU).  There  were  no  differences 
between the two interventions, either alone or together, and 
TAU  on  suicide  attempts,  suicidal  ideation,  non-suicidal 
self-injury, or suicidal events. In further moderation analy-
ses, adolescents who were hospitalized for suicide attempts 
and assigned to BRITE app had a lower rate of follow-up 
suicide attempts. Taken together, the results were nuanced, 
suggesting that BRITE may lower suicide attempt risk for a 
subset of youth with recent attempts.

A  second  RCT  was  carried  out  nationwide  via  online 
recruitment with 565 adolescents, ages 13–16, with non-sui-
cidal self-injury (NSSI) within the prior month and recent 
negative  views  of  the  self.  In  this  study,  youth  were  ran-
domized to the web-based Project SAVE (Stopping Adoles-
cent Violence Everywhere), a 30-minute self-administered 
single-session intervention drawing on elements of CBT, or 
to a 30-minute active control program with supportive ther-
apy [32]. Project SAVE was perceived as acceptable; how-
ever, there were no group differences for the pre-registered 
outcomes of 3-month NSSI frequency or suicidal ideation 
or  for  post-intervention  self-reported  likelihood  of  future 
NSSI. Although  adolescents  randomized  to  Project  SAVE 
reported post-intervention improvements in self-hatred and 
desire  to  stop  future  NSSI,  overall  results  suggested  that 
improvements in longer-term suicidal and non-suicidal self-
injury  outcomes  may  require  additional  or  more  intensive 
approaches.

A comparative effectiveness trial of a brief suicide crisis 
intervention based on Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Ado-
lescents (IPT-A-SCI) for children and adolescents (N = 309) 
with  depression,  anxiety,  or  suicidal  ideation/behavior 
showed  no  difference  between  the  brief  IPT-A-SCI,  treat-
ment as usual or waitlist on outcomes of interest including 
suicidal  ideation,  depression  symptoms,  or  anxiety  [33]. 
Youth were recruited in an outpatient depression and suicide 
clinic,  and  this  intervention  included  5  weekly  50-minute 
sessions and 4 follow up personal emails. Sessions focus on 
the development of a safety plan, evaluating interpersonal 
relationships,  development  and  practice  of  coping  strate-
gies, and relapse prevention [33].

Current Psychiatry Reports (2025) 27:500–5081 3Finally, we describe two pilot studies exploring adjunc-
tive  interventions  integrating  follow-up  contacts  during 
high-risk care transitions. In the first pilot using a sequential 
multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), 80 adoles-
cent inpatients [34] were first randomized to a Motivational 
Interview-Enhanced  Safety  Plan  (MI-SP),  either  alone  or 
with daily post-discharge supportive text messages. Adoles-
cents were re-randomized two weeks after discharge to an 
added booster call or to no call. Adolescents who received 
supportive text messages showed improved safety plan use, 
self-efficacy to refrain from suicidal action, and coping by 
support-seeking, as did youth randomized to booster calls. 
Supportive texts were also associated with lower intensity 
of  daily  suicidal  urges  and  greater  coping  self-efficacy. 
Though needing additional empirical support, text messag-
ing could offer a promising follow-up strategy and extend 
interventions, such as safety planning.

The  second  pilot  RCT  examined  a  text-based  interven-
tion  for  parents  of  adolescents  seeking  ED  services  for 
suicidal ideation or attempts ([35], under review). The auto-
mated text messages included two types: messages encour-
aging parents to follow through with recommendations for 
their  adolescent  (e.g.,  restricting  lethal  means)  and  mes-
sages supporting parents’ own well-being (e.g., coping tips). 
Parents (n = 120) were randomized to a control group or an 
intervention group consisting of one or both types of mes-
sages. These preliminary findings supported the feasibility 
and acceptability of this intervention and pointed to its posi-
tive  impact  on  parental  engagement  in  suicide  prevention 
activities  and  lowering  post-ED  suicide  attempts  among 
adolescents. The unique focus on caregivers highlights the 
potential  of  low-burden  parent-facing  interventions  as  an 
additional  strategy  for  lowering  youth  suicidal  behavior 
during high-risk periods.

Altogether, there have been notable recent efforts toward 
building a stronger evidence-base for suicide-specific inter-
ventions  for  youth.  Nevertheless,  while  demonstrating 
feasibility and acceptability, none of the recent large-scale 
RCTs  reviewed  showed  an  impact  on  suicidal  ideation  or 
attempts, and the two pilot trials require replication.

As  the  field  looks  toward  addressing  gaps  in  treatment 
approaches for adolescents at risk for suicide, we pose four 
recommendations.  First,  while  recognizing  the  limitations 
of  existing  interventions,  it  may  be  that  some  treatment 
approaches, while not effective across the board, may in fact 
be beneficial for some youth. Though relatively infrequently 
tested  in  the  suicide  prevention  literature  [36],  examining 
treatment moderators as part of RCTs could avoid prema-
turely  discounting  interventions  that  do  not  show  over-
all  effects  and  may  inform  how  to  personalize  treatments 
[36].  For  example,  while  the  mobile  BRITE  app  did  not 
lower the suicide attempt risk overall, it was beneficial for 

503

those with recent attempts [31]. Second, as suicidal youth 
are  not  homogeneous  with  respect  to  risk  profiles  [37]  or 
time-varying  changes  in  risk  states  [38],  a  related  consid-
eration  is  to  test  adaptive  interventions  that  specify  how, 
when,  and  for  whom  interventions  should  be  delivered. 
While  this  section  described  pilot  work  seeking  to  inform 
an adaptive intervention for youth at risk for suicide [34], 
large-scale  studies  will  be  necessary  to  guide  progress  in 
this area. Third, studies summarized in this section suggest 
a shift toward more scalable interventions that rely on tech-
nology to extend their reach [31, 34] or increase access to 
stand-alone support [32]. Nevertheless, caution is needed to 
scrutinize  potential  limitations  of  technology-based  inter-
ventions,  as  such  approaches  may  not  necessarily  lead  to 
lasting improvement [32] or benefit all teens [31]. Finally, 
as we work to improve the effectiveness of preventive inter-
ventions, it is critically important to simultaneously address 
implementation issues, such that interventions are designed 
with features that improve intervention access and eventual 
uptake in real-world settings.

Crisis  Lifeline.  The  988  Crisis  Lifeline  is  a  nationally 
accessible  service  that  offers  live  support  via  call,  chat  or 
text options. This service is considered to be a critical com-
ponent of current suicide prevention efforts [39]. A recent 
study of Lifeline chatters’ views of the Lifeline’s perceived 
effectiveness  revealed  that  39%  of  chatters  were  minors 
[40] and 71.4% were 24 years old or younger. Two-thirds of 
chatters found the service helpful and nearly half reported a 
decrease in suicide-related concerns related to their chatting 
experience. Compared to adults, minors had a significantly 
higher odds of finding the chat helpful [40]. This converges 
with  evidence  from  a  2022  study  that  analyzed  data  from 
crisis  texters  and  found  that  the  majority  (i.e.  76%)  were 
under 25 years old [41]. Highlighting the potential value of 
crisis support, 31% of texters 13 years or younger reported 
that they had no additional sources of help for their current 
crisis. Additionally, Hispanic, Black, and Native Hawaiian 
or Other Pacific Islander texters had lower rates of getting 
help from a therapist or doctor. Those who self-identified as 
belonging to a sexual or gender minority group and those 
reporting more than one race represented a greater propor-
tion  of  texters  compared  to  the  general  population.  These 
findings  highlight  the  potential  benefit  of  the  crisis  tex-
ting resource for youth in general as well as for systemati-
cally  marginalized  groups,  indicating  its  important  role  in 
advancing health equity. Additional research is needed that 
examines the effectiveness in relation to youth mental health 
and behavioral outcomes.

Identification of Proximal Risk or Warning 
Signs

Researchers  have  begun  to  identify  the  signs  of  proximal 
risk for suicidal ideation and behavior in adolescents – those 
which  are  present  during  the  24-hours  or  less  prior  to  the 
suicidal  experience.  Most  prior  research  on  youth  suicide 
risk factors focused on distal or moderate- to short-term risk 
factors that occur in the months and years prior to a suicide 
attempt [14]. Although these studies provided information 
about  who  is  at  greatest  risk,  they  did  not  help  us  under-
stand when a youth may be at greatest risk [15, 16], which 
is critically important to caregivers, school personnel, and 
healthcare  providers  who  face  the  stressful  challenge  of 
recognizing  acute  risk  in  time  for  potentially  life-saving 
interventions.

A  number  of  recent  studies  of  proximal  risk  in  adoles-
cents  have  focused  on  risk  for  suicidal  ideation  and  used 
technological  advances  such  as  ecological  momentary 
assessments (EMA) and daily monitoring (e.g. [17]). Czyz 
et  al.’s  particularly  noteworthy  study  focused  on  the  pre-
diction  of  next  day  suicidal  ideation  among  adolescents 
following  psychiatric  hospitalization  for  suicide  risk  [18], 
which is a high-risk time with observed variability in day-
to-day suicidal thinking [17, 19]. In this study, adolescents, 
who  had  been  hospitalized  for  acute  suicide  risk,  com-
pleted  daily,  text-based,  surveys  for  four  weeks  following 
hospitalization. Using machine learning methods, the best-
performing  model  for  the  prediction  of  next-day  suicidal 
ideation was comprised of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, 
burdensomeness and suicide coping self-efficacy. Both risk 
factors  over  time  (e.g.,  cumulative  risk  factor  means  over 
days) and proximal risk factors (e.g., past day experiences 
as  compared  to  mean  experiences)  were  important.  More-
over,  several  combinations  of  risk  factors  were  related  to 
next-day suicide ideation, with suicide ideation duration as 
the  most  potent  factor.  Czyz  et  al.  identified  a  reasonably 
good predictive model that did not include suicidal ideation, 
which  may  be  important  clinically  given  that  some  youth 
do not disclose suicidal thoughts. This study highlights the 
promise  of  machine  learning  to  identify  short-term  risk 
for suicidal ideation. It should be noted, however, that the 
sample was small (n = 78) and primarily comprised of White 
adolescents, such that replication is warranted.

Moving  beyond  proximal  risk  for  suicidal  thoughts 
to  proximal  risk  for  suicide  attempts,  recent  research  has 
identified the 24-hour warning signs for adolescent suicide 
attempts  [20].  In  this  study,  1,094  adolescents,  recruited 
from  geographically  diverse  pediatric  emergency  depart-
ments  in  the  U.S.,  completed  bi-weekly  text  message  sur-
veys  for  18  months.  These  adolescents  presented  to  the 
emergency departments with a wide range of psychiatric and

nonpsychiatric presenting problems and were invited to par-
ticipate in this prospective, community-based study if they 
had one or more suicide risk factors (e.g., depression). Ado-
lescents who reported a suicide attempt during this follow-up 
period were interviewed regarding their thoughts, feelings/
emotions, and behaviors/events during the 24-hours prior to 
their attempt (case period) and a comparison prior 24-hour 
period  (control  period).  Their  parents  also  participated  in 
interviews reporting on adolescents’ behaviors and experi-
ences  during  these  periods.  Interview  data  were  available 
for  105  adolescents  who  reported  suicide  attempts.  Using 
a  within  subject  (case-crossover)  design,  suicidal  commu-
nications, withdrawal from activities, and sleep disturbance 
emerged as key behavioral warning signs (Table 1). Addi-
tional  affective,  cognitive,  and  behavioral  warning  signs 
emerged  from  adolescent  interviews  and  included,  among 
others, self-hate, rush of feelings, emotional pain, less rage 
toward others, suicidal rumination, anger and hostility, per-
ceived burdensomeness, and serious conflict with parents.

These  recent  studies  of  proximal  risk  for  adolescent 
suicidal  ideation  and  suicide  attempts  provide  important 
information  for  caregivers,  school  personnel  and  health-
care providers. Although replication of these studies is war-
ranted,  particularly  with  more  diverse  samples  of  youth, 
we  now  have  evidence-based  information  to  disseminate 
regarding  proximal  risk  for  suicidal  ideation  and  suicide 
attempts among adolescents. A next challenge for our field 
will  be  learning  how  we  can  effectively  help  caregivers 
and clinicians identify these warning signs and respond in 
ways that are associated with positive outcomes for youth. 
It may be that the 24-hour behavioral warning signs for sui-
cide attempts, including suicidal communications and with-
drawal  from  others  and  activities,  are  most  useful  in  this 
regard  due  to  the  difficulty  of  observing  the  adolescents’ 

Current Psychiatry Reports (2025) 27:500–5081 3thoughts  and  feelings.  Regarding  warning  signs  for  sui-
cidal  ideation,  whereas  the  combination  of  EMA  or  daily 
monitoring and methods for extraction of clinical data from 
electronic  medical  records  has  led  to  promising  machine 
learning prediction models, these are not yet usable for the 
practical identification of acute risk in clinical settings. As a 
next step, we need to figure out how to extend these methods 
beyond the research context and make them usable for those 
who interact with youth. Finally, more frequent assessment 
of risk factors and machine learning techniques may open 
the door to adaptive interventions [21], which acknowledge 
that risk is multifactorial, and that youth may benefit from 
different interventions at different times.

Social Media Guidelines for Youth 
Discussions of Suicide-Related Concerns

The  potential  benefits  of  social  media,  including  connec-
tion and identity exploration, align with the developmental 
tasks of adolescence [42]. Nevertheless, social media may 
also heighten feelings of being left out and be a vehicle for 
cyberbullying  and  interpersonal  conflict  [43].  Youth  may 
also  be  exposed  to  harmful  pro-suicide  and  pro-self-harm 
content on social media [44], such as content encouraging 
suicide and self-harm or content that does not adhere to safe 
communication  guidelines  (such  as  descriptions  of  meth-
ods),  which  could  contribute  to  suicide  contagion/social 
transmission effects for some youth [45, 46].

The  relationship  between  social  media  use  and  suicide 
was  recently  studied  in  a  psychological  autopsy  study  of 
35 adolescents who died by suicide. According to the study 
informants (primarily parents and other next-of-kin), youth 
benefitted from support and recovery stories, but may have 
been  harmed  by  dependence,  harmful  comparisons,  trig-
gers/imitation,  cyberbullying,  and  cultivation  of  a  “sui-
cidal identity” [47]. The only time informants drew a direct 
relation  between  social  media  and  the  teen’s  suicide  was 
for  youth  who  had  been  cyberbullied,  with  cyberbullying 
including the encouragement of suicidal behaviors, unsolic-
ited proposals, or sexual coercion. Although there is no way 
to know whether these factors had any role in these adoles-
cents’ suicides, these informants’ perspectives may provide 
important clues.

Social  media  use  is  associated  with  positive  and  nega-
tive  experiences  for  youth  with  recent  suicidal  ideation 
and  attempts,  who  have  reported  the  benefit  of  accessing 
mental health and coping resources as well as the harm of 
excessive  friendship  expectations  [48].  In  a  recent  effort 
to  maximize  the  benefits  while  minimizing  the  harms,  an 
Australian-based  program  called  #chatsafe  was  created  to 
serve as a guide for safe peer-to-peer communication about 

505

suicide  on  social  media.  Developed  using  feedback  from 
youth  and  suicide  prevention  experts  [49],  the  guidelines 
address a variety of issues, including, among others, what to 
consider before sharing your own thoughts/experience with 
suicidal behavior and responding to someone who may be 
experiencing suicidal thoughts/behaviors [49]. In a prelimi-
nary study testing the acceptability, feasibility and safety of 
a social media campaign using #chatsafe guidelines, there 
were no serious adverse effects. Moreover, youth and young 
adults reported improvements in their willingness to inter-
vene  against  suicide,  perceived  self-efficacy,  confidence, 
and safety when communicating on social media about sui-
cide. The #chatsafe guidelines and social media campaign 
are currently being tested in an RCT [50] assessing impact 
on young people’s safety and confidence when talking about 
suicide online.

Recommendations for the social media industry to pro-
mote  help  and  prevent  suicide  include  the  importance  of 
restricting  self-harm  and  suicide  related  content  by  clear 
policies [51]. In a survey completed by 23 suicide preven-
tion  professionals  and  43  young  people,  participants  pro-
vided feedback on a range of social media considerations. 
There was moderate agreement about the industry using arti-
ficial intelligence (AI) to identify users at risk and promote 
helpful resources and strong support for legal requirements 
to  provide  education  about  communicating  safely  online 
in schools [51]. Many social media platforms already have 
community guidelines [52, 53, 54], which prohibit content 
promoting suicide, self-injury or eating disorders and users 
are directed to contact a helpline or reach out to a friend if 
they search for “suicide” related terms on some platforms.

Conclusions

We have a growing evidence base to inform youth suicide 
prevention  strategies;  however,  further  research  is  needed 
to  strengthen  the  effects  of  our  emerging  preventive  strat-
egies,  tailor  and  improve  them  for  identifiable  subgroups 
of  youth  at  risk,  and  to  feasibly  implement  them  in  real 
world healthcare and community settings. Fortunately, the 
funding of suicide prevention research has grown substan-
tially in recent years [55], including for high priority needs 
such as understanding and preventing Black youth suicide 
among Black youth [56, 57, 58]. Other subgroups of minori-
tized youth, such youth who identify as sexual and gender 
minorities (SGM; [59]) face unique stressors and are also at 
elevated risk, warranting further focused research [60]. We 
still need to understand which preventive strategies -- from 
screening  to  treatment  to  crisis  response  services  --  work 
best for which subgroups of youth, as well as which can be 
disseminated widely and implemented feasibly in different

settings,  enabling  us  to  address  substantial  mental  health 
disparities.

Further research to inform youth suicide prevention is an 
urgent priority. Research alone, however, will not enable us 
to reach our suicide prevention goals. We also need to focus 
on the translation of research to policy and practice. This is 
likely  to  require  developing  and  nurturing  active  working 
partnerships  among  researchers,  healthcare  professionals, 
healthcare  and  public  policy  changemakers,  insurers,  and 
leaders in pertinent youth-serving settings and institutions.
