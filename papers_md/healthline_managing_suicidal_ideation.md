Suicide can run in families. Youmay be more likelyto try to take your own life if someone in your family has already done so.

- a substance use problem

- a mental disorder or stress condition

- chronic pain, terminal illness, or another medical situation in which you might feel hopeless

- attempted suicide before

- job or financial difficulties

Being under the influence of drugs or alcoholmay also increase your riskfor suicidal ideation and going through with the act.


## Passive suicidal ideation


Passive suicidal ideation is when a person desires deathbut has no specific planto take their life.

If you’re experiencing passive suicidal ideation, your fantasies may involve dying in your sleep or having a fatal accident. You may believe that the world would be better off without you.

You shouldn’t take passive suicidal ideation lightly. It’s impossible to predict who’s likely to act on these thoughts. That’s why anyone who expresses passive suicidal ideation should be considered at risk for suicide.

Even if passive suicidal ideation appears to be fleeting, the risk of a suicide attempt is very real. The line between passive and active suicidal ideation is blurry. The transition from one to the other can happen slowly or suddenly, and it’s not always obvious to the casual observer.

While someone might admit to wishing to die, they may deny making plans to do so. Warning signs that suicidal ideation has become active include giving away possessions, getting affairs in order, and saying goodbye to loved ones.

No one could ever predict with 100 percent certainty if someone will or will not take their own life. Even trained medical professionals can’t predict who will take their life. This is why you need to take threats or thoughts of suicide seriously.

See your doctor or psychiatrist for a careful evaluation and to get appropriate treatment.


## Medications and suicidal ideation


Researchershave linkedantidepressantswith an increase in suicidal thoughts in some instances. Children and adolescents areat increased riskof this. However,more high quality, long-term studies are neededto confirm this link, if it exists.

If you begin having thoughts of suicide while taking an antidepressant, contact your doctor immediately. They can work with you to safely adjust your treatment plan.


### Questions you may be asked


When you see your doctor, they’ll ask you many questions so they can assess the severity of your situation. Some questions your doctor may ask include:

- How long have you had thoughts of suicide?

- Do you have a history ofdepression?

- How far have your thoughts of suicide gone? Have you come up with a plan?

- Are you taking any medications? If so, what are they?

- Do you use alcohol or drugs? If so, how often?

You should also expect your doctor to ask you to take a questionnaire. Your answers will help your doctor evaluate your mental health and develop a course of treatment.


## How is suicidal ideation treated?


Your doctor will treat your depression according to the severity of your condition.

You doctormay prescribeantidepressants or anti-anxiety medication. These can help you manage your symptoms. You should also expect your treatment plan to include talking to a psychologist or counselor.

Ask your doctor or psychologist about ways to find additional support. They can recommend a support group. They may also have recommendations for how to get help if you use alcohol or drugs that may be contributing to your challenges.

If your risk of suicide is high, you may need to stay in an inpatient treatment facility. This is for your safety. You can receive your treatment at the facility and you won’t have access to items you may use to commit suicide.


## How can you prevent suicidal ideation?


Knowing your triggers for depression and suicidal ideation can help you avoid or better manage these triggers in the future.

Here are some strategies:

- Keep track of situations you find stressful and how you handle them.

- Keep a journal to help you understand and manage your feelings.

- Find ways to relieve stress, such as physical activity or talking with a friend.

- Seek help at the first signs of depression.

- Call 911 if you’re having thoughts of suicide.

Your outlook for depression or suicidal thoughts will improve with a strong network of friends and family.

Talking with others about the challenges you’re facing may help. Physical activity can alsohelp reduce depression, even if it is simply taking a walk outside.

Since there is no way to 100% accurately predict who will act on their thoughts, suicidal ideation should be taken very seriously, whether it is passive or not.

Treatment for suicidal ideation is available and can be successful. Ask for help if you need it.
