Summary

Background: We evaluated a team-based program of exercises for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia 
(PDA) in primary care. 

Methods: 419 patients with PDA (mean age 46.2 years, standard deviation 14.4 years; 74% female) were included in this 
cluster-randomized, controlled intervention trial. The patients were blinded with respect to their group assignment at baseline. 
Patients in the intervention group (36 primary-care practices, 230 patients) underwent a 23-week exercise program combined 
with case management, while patients in the control group (37 practices, 189 patients) received standard care. Symptoms of 
anxiety (according to the Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI) at six months were the primary endpoint. Patients were followed up at six 
months (n = 338, 81%) and at twelve months (n = 318, 76%). The analysis was by intention to treat. 

Results: Symptoms of anxiety improved to a significantly greater extent in the intervention group (p = 0.008). The intergroup dif-
ference in the reduction of the BAI score (range: 0–63) was 3.0 points (95% confidence interval [−5.8; −0.2]) at six months and 
4.0 points [−6.9; −1.2] at twelve months. In the intervention group, there was a significantly greater reduction in the frequency of 
panic attacks (p = 0.019), in avoidant behavior (p = 0.016), and in depressiveness (p<0.001), as well as a greater improvement 
of the quality of treatment (p<0.001).

Conclusion: In primary-care patients who have panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, a team-based exercise program 
combined with case management can improve symptoms to a greater extent than standard primary-care treatment.

P anic  disorder  with/without  agoraphobia  (PDA)  is 

associated with decreased quality of life of those af-
fected  (1)  and  increased  health  care  costs  (2).  In 
Germany,  the  prevalence  of  panic  disorder  in  primary 
care  is  approximately  5%  (3,  4).  Even  though  it  is  a 
 comparatively  common  condition,  panic  disorder  is  fre-
quently overlooked and not treated (5). For most patients 
with  panic  disorder,  the  general  practitioner  is  the  first, 
and  often  the  only,  contact  (6).  Cognitive  behavioral 
 therapy  and  antidepressants  are  effective  first-line 
 therapies (7, 8).

Previous  studies  used  collaborative  care  models 
(adaptions of Wagner’s chronic care model [9, 10]) to 
improve treatment in the primary care setting. These 
models  typically  comprise  systematic  monitoring, 
collaboration between the primary care provider and 
the specialist/therapist as well as psychiatric counsel-
ing (9, 11). A systematic review with meta-analysis on 
the  effect  of  collaborative  care  for  patients  with 
anxiety disorders in the primary care setting showed

The clinical perspective

General practitioners can treat patients with panic disorder with/without agoraphobia 
using an easily accessible and effective treatment program, comprising elements of 
cognitive behavioral therapy: psychoeducation, interoceptive and situational anxiety 
exposure exercises, and relapse prophylaxis. In the Jena-PARADIES study, inter-
oceptive exposure exercises (body exercises) were exceptionally well accepted. 
These can be introduced by the general practitioner in a controlled fashion and are 
in general easily performed by patients. Situational exposure exercises are typically 
indicated in patients with concomitant agoraphobia; however, this strategy was less 
consistently implemented during our study. The treatment program was carried out 
using an outpatient case management strategy: Practice nurses (MFA) in the GP 
practices regularly contact patients by phone to record the symptom and treatment 
progress using a checklist (structured clinical monitoring). The MFA basically acts as 
the “extended arm“ of the general practitioners. In this role, they support the con-
tinuity of the treatment and thus are instrumental to the success of the treatment 
strategy presented here. Neither the general practitioner nor the MFA offer compre-
hensive psychotherapy services. However, severe or complex clinical conditions 
and lack of success of the program can be easily identified by the general practi-
tioner. These patients should then be referred to a specialist.

that  collaborative  care  was  superior  to  treatment  as 
usual  (TAU)  (effect  size  for  all  anxiety  disorders: 
standardized  mean  difference  [SMD]: 0.35;  95% 
 confidence interval: [0.14; 0.56]; effect size for panic 
disorder:  SMD: 0.59;  [0.41;  0.78])  (12). Apparently, 
anxiety  patients  prefer  psychotherapeutic  interven-
tions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to 
pharmacotherapy (13). CBT contributes to long-term 
clinical improvements too (14).

In  Germany,  waiting  times  for  psychotherapeutic 
treatment  to  become  available  can  be  up  to  several 
months (15). Thus, a low-threshold treatment offering 
adapted  to  the  general  practitioner  (GP)  practice 
 setting  seems  to  be  a  suitable  option  to  bridge  the 
waiting time (16). The aim of this study was to evalu-
ate the effects of a team-based intervention with case 
management  in  patients  with  panic  disorder  in  a 
 primary  care  setting.  It  was  hypothesized  that  this 
 intervention results in a significantly greater improve-
ment of symptoms of anxiety after six months com-
pared to treatment as usual.

Anxiety  DIsordErS)  was  a  cluster-randomized  inter-
vention  study  with  a  two-arm  parallel  group  design 
(intervention group versus TAU control group) (17). 
To  prevent  contamination  of  control  group  patients, 
GP practices were the randomization units (clusters).
Patients were screened by the teams of the partici-
pating GP practices, using the Overall Anxiety Sever-
ity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) (18) and the panic 
modules  of  the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ) 

(19).  The  general  practitioner  invited  patients  with 
suspicious  scores  for  a  diagnostic  interview  during 
which the patient’s eligibility for participating in the 
study was verified using validated ICD-10 check lists 
(ICD, International Classification of Diseases) (20).

Only adult patients diagnosed with PDA (ICD-10: 
F41.0 or F40.01) were included in the study. The ex-
clusion criteria were as follows: suicidality, psychotic 
or  substance-related  disorders,  severe  physical  im-
pairments,  pregnancy  or  ongoing  anxiety-specific 
psychotherapy.  The  general  practitioners  were 
 responsible for including eligible patients and obtain-
ing their informed consents to study participation.

Randomization
After  a  three-month  recruitment  period  for  each 
 practice, cluster randomization of the GP practices was 
performed (allocation ratio 1:1).

Interventions
The  practice  team–supported  exposure  training  com-
prised  evidence-based  elements  of  CBT  (psychoedu-
cation,  interoceptive  and  situational  anxiety  exposure 
exercises)  (21)  as  well  as  intervention  elements  from 
the chronic care model (22).

Intervention  group  patients  received  a  therapy 
companion  book,  providing 
information  about 
 psychoeducation and how to perform the exercises, as 
well as exposure log sheets. Four structured GP visits 
were scheduled in a 23-week period; during the first 3 
visits,  an  introduction  into  the  CBT  elements  was 
given.  Starting  from  the  second  GP  visit,  patients 
were  encouraged  to  independently  perform  anxiety 
exposure  exercises  at  least  twice  a  week.  To  ensure 
current symptoms of anxiety are monitored at regular 
intervals and to enhance treatment adherence, check-
list-based telephone monitoring was carried out by a 
nurse of the GP practice (23). In case of suboptimal 
monitoring results, the general practitioners could ar-
range for additional patient contacts and/or adaptions 
to be made to the exercise plan. Patients in the control 
group received standard therapy, i.e. guideline-based 
psychosocial or psychopharmacological treatment (6, 
24).

The  general  practitioners  were  free  to  administer 
whatever treatment they deemed necessary and make 
referrals at their own discretion.

Endpoints
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  clinical  severity  of  the 
anxiety  symptoms  measured  using  the  Beck  Anxiety 
Inventory (BAI) (25). The patients used this instrument 
to rate how severely affected they had been by 21 typi-
cal  symptoms  of  anxiety  (range  0–63)  during  the  last 
week.

Secondary endpoints included
●  number  and  severity  of  panic  attacks,  measured 
using  2  items  (A1,  A2)  of  the  panic  and  agora-
phobia scale (PAS) (26)

●  patient  evaluation  of  the  medical  care  received,

Measurements were performed at baseline (T0), at 
6-month  follow-up  (T1)  and  at  12-month  follow-up 
(T2). Patient-side baseline variables were reported by 
the patients or by their general practitioners.

Sample size calculation
With  a  standard  deviation  of  the  BAI  of  11  (2),  a 
 standardized effect size of 0.35 (i.e. a BAI mean differ-
ence  of  3.85  points)  could  be  demonstrated  with  a 
power of 80% in a patient-randomized study with 130 
patients per treatment group, using the t test. Assuming 
an intracluster correlation of 0.07 (2) and a cluster size 
of 6, a design effect of 1.35 (correction factor for sample 
size  adaption  with  cluster 
randomization)  was 
 calculated. When in addition a dropout rate of 20% was 
assumed,  222  patients  from  37  practices  per  treatment 
group were required.

 intervention effects, linear mixed models (LMMs) and 
generalized LMMs, taking the hierarchical data struc-
ture into account (maximum likelihood method), were 
adapted (29). Fixed-effects estimators are reported with 
95% confidence intervals. The statistical test for clini-
cal  improvements  referred  to  the  interaction  between 
the  factors  treatment  group  and  time  (two-sided 
α = 0.05).

Using  the  “clinical  significance“  approach  (30), 
 dichotomous measures for response to treatment and 
for  remission  were  calculated.  “Response“  was 
 defined as a statistically reliable BAI score decrease. 
“Remission“ was defined as a BAI score decrease below 
the weighted midpoint between the empirical BAI score 
distribution in our sample (T0) and a comparable patient 
sample without anxiety disorders (30, 31).

The data on remission after 12 months were used to 

calculate the number needed to treat (NNT).

Results
Course of the study
The Figure shows the CONSORT flowchart. The medi-
an  cluster  size  was  6  (interquartile  range  [IQR]  4–7). 
Altogether, 219 patients (53.2%) were included prior to 
practice  randomization.  The  6-month  follow-up  was 
 responded  to  by  175/230  (76%)  patients  of  the  inter-
vention  group  and  by  163/189  (86%)  patients  of  the 
control  group;  the  12-month  follow-up  by  168/230 
(73%) and 150/189 (79%), respectively (dropout analy-
sis in the eTables 1 and 2).

Study participants
The two treatment groups were similar with regard to 
practice  and  patient  characteristics  (Tables  1a  and  b). 
Prior  to  the  intervention,  341  patients  (82%)  experi-
enced  up  to  3  panic  attacks  weekly  (eTable  3),  73 
(18%)  experienced  4  or  more  attacks  weekly. The  se-
verity of these panic attacks (eTable 4) was rated by 96 
patients (24%) as mild or moderate and by 226 (55%) 
as  severe  or  extremely  severe.  Comorbid  depression 
was observed in 143 patients (35%).

Conduct of the intervention
Data on the conduct of the scheduled GP visits were ob-
tained  from  199/230  patients  (87%).  These  data 
showed that 129 (65%) patients received all 4 GP visits, 
152 (76%) at least the first 3 GP visits (which informed 
about the CBT elements), 168 (84%) at least the first 2 
GP visits, and 17 (9%) no visit at all (information about 
dropouts provided in eTable 5).

A median of 10 practice nurse monitoring activities 
(IQR:  6–10)  was  performed.  The  mean  consultation 
time was 27.4 minutes (standard deviation [SD]: 5.8; 
range: 15–45) and practice nurse monitoring time 8.2 
minutes (SD: 3.5; range: 2–30). The mean duration of 
the total intervention (up to GP visit 4) was 157 days 
(IQR: 140–196).

Statistical analysis
Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were performed using 
the  SAS  9.4  software  package.  For  the  analysis  of 

In the control group, the patients had a median of 4 
GP  visits  during  the  intervention  period  (IQR:  3–6). 
The general practitioners of the control group patients

usually provided the following interventions:
●  exploration of psychosocial problems
●  recommendation  not  to  avoid  anxiety-triggering 

stimuli (72%), and 

● prescription  of  selective  serotonin 

reuptake 
 inhibitors  (SSRIs)  (62%),  benzodiazepines,  as 
required,  (40%)  and/or  tricyclic  antidepressants 
(18%) (24).

Analysis of the primary endpoints
The ITT analysis (Table 2) showed at 6-month follow-
up  in  each  of  the  two  groups  a  significant  decline  in 
mean anxiety severity (BAI, range: 0–63) (intervention 
group:  −8.5  [−10.3;  −6.6],  control  group:  −5.4  [−7.3; 
−3.4];  raw  data  listed  in  eTable  6).  Between  the 
6-month  follow-up  and  the  12-month  follow-up,  this 
trend continued in a weakened form. A significant inter-
action  of  the  factors  group  and  time  (p = 0.008)  con-
firmed  that  the  intervention  group  had  seen  stronger 
improvements  compared  to  the  control  group.  The 
group differences in mean BAI scores were as follows: 
after  6  months  −3.0  [−5.8;  −0.2]  and  after  12  months 
−4.0  [−6.9;  −1.2].  The  location  of  the  GP  practice 
(urban versus rural [stratification variable]) had no sig-
nificant  effect  (p = 0.93). A  sensitivity  analysis  based 
on multiple imputation (see eMethods) confirmed these 
results.

As  shown  by  explorative  analyses  of  individual 
BAI score changes, patient response to treatment was 
more  frequently  observed  in  the  intervention  group 
(i.e. decrease of the BAI score by at least 10.3 points). 
After  6  months,  this  occurred  in  the  intervention 
group in 59 patients (37%) and in the control group in 
46 patients (31%); after 12 months in 66 (42%) and 
45  (32%)  patients,  respectively.  Likewise,  remission 
of  symptoms  (i.e.  decrease  of  the  BAI  score  to  less 
than  11.1  points)  was  significantly  more  often  ob -
served in the intervention group. After 6 months, this 
was  noted  in  the  intervention  group  in  44  patients 
(27%) and in the control  group in  19 patients  (13%); 
after  12  months  in  54  patients  (34%)  and  23  patients 
(16%), respectively. The NNT was 6.

Analysis of secondary endpoints
In both groups, the number of panic attacks was found 
reduced  (eTable  7);  the  decrease  was  significantly 
greater in the intervention group compared to the con-
trol group (p = 0.019). Likewise, the intervention group 
showed  greater  improvements  with  regards  to  agora-
phobic  avoidance  behavior  (MI),  depression  (PHQ-9) 
and perceived quality of care (PACIC) compared to the 
control  group  (Table  2). The  severity  of  panic  attacks 
was reduced in both groups (eTable 8, p = 0.13). Intake 
of psychotropic medications was reported by 55% of pa-
tients (eTable 9); there was no difference in this  respect 
at the 12-month follow-up between the two groups.

Discussion
In  patients  with  panic  disorder  with/without  agora-
phobia, practice team–supported exposure training led

to  a  more  pronounced  reduction  in  anxiety  symptoms 
compared  to  treatment  as  usual.  The  mean  anxiety 
 levels improved in both groups during the intervention 
period from severe to moderate. Differences in anxiety 
reduction between the groups were minor to moderate, 
largely  comparable  with  effect  sizes  of  measures  of 
anxiety  observed  in  collaborative  care  studies  with 
specialist  involvement  (12,  32,  33).  The  effects  re-
mained stable over a period of 12 months. This could 
indicate  that  patients  in  the  intervention  group  learnt 
health-related behavior and self-management strategies 
which stabilized the progress made (34).

Based on the 12-month remission data, an NNT of 
6 was calculated. This indicates a rather good effect of 
the intervention (35) and is comparable to results of 
similar studies (13). The improvements with regard to 
avoidance behavior and depression achieved in the in-
tervention  group  were  statistically  significant.  This 
may have  facilitated  the  interaction  between  general 
practitioner  and  patient  and  improved  treatment 
 adherence by the patient (36).

In an earlier study where general practitioners had 
been  trained  in  anxiety  treatment,  no  effects  on  the 
clinical  endpoints  was  noted  (2).  The  treatment  ef-
fects observed in our study are comparable with those 
in  studies  on  stepped  care  or  collaborative  care 
 models for anxiety disorders in a primary care setting, 
all of which involved a psychologist/psychotherapist 
and/or  other  healthcare  professionals  to  perform  or 
monitor  the  intervention  (13,  32,  33,  37).  Our  study 
shows  the  practice  team–supported  interventions  are 
feasible.  Offering  low-threshold  interventions  in 
 primary  care  may  help  to  optimize  patient  safety, 
quality  of  care  and  access 
to  evidence-based 
 treatments. Future studies should investigate whether 
GP  practice-based  interventions  are  associated  with 
changes  in  acceptance  of  primary  medicine  or  psy-
chotherapeutic services offered.

Compared  to  other  studies,  patients  here  showed 
good  treatment  compliance  (37,  38).  Additional 

 analyses  of  individual  BAI  score  changes  demon-
strated  that  in  the  intervention  group  remission  of 
symptoms of anxiety was achieved in approximately 
one  third  of  the  patients.  Since  this  is  twice  as  high 
compared  to  the  control  group,  it  is  reasonable  to 
 assume  that  the  intervention  was  effective.  Future 
studies 
should  evaluate  patient  characteristics 
 associated with the acceptance and benefit of the in-
tervention to facilitate decision-making for individual 
treatments.  Based  on  the  reduced  amount  of  follow-
up  data  on  pharmacotherapy  and  on  the  limited 
quality  of  patient  self-reporting,  we  do  not  believe 
that  the  intervention  had  an  effect  on  the  treatment 
with psychotropic medications.

Strengths of the study
 In a large sample of patients receiving primary care, an 
intervention  was  evaluated  which  empowers  and  en-
courages  patients  to  independently  perform  exposure

Key messages

●  Panic disorder is a common condition in GP practices.
●  General practitioners can successfully treat panic disorder patients with individually adaptable, behavioral therapy-oriented exer-

cises.

●  Practice-based case management ensures the implementation of the treatment and enables continuous monitoring of symptoms 

over time. General practitioners can directly responded to it.

●  Interoceptive exposure exercises (so-called body exercises) are better suited for use in a GP practice setting than situational 

 exposure exercises.

●  Practice nurses (MFA) are as the “extended arm“ of the general practitioners reliable partners in the treatment triangle doctor-

 patient-nurse.

exercises  (21).  To  ensure  transferability  of  its  results, 
the study was conducted in single-GP practices or small 
group practices which are typical for the German pri-
mary care setting, accounting for the largest portion of 
healthcare services provided (39).

Disadvantages of the study
 The  open  recruitment  of  about  half  of  the  patients 
could have introduced selection bias. However, this ap-
pears unlikely because no significant differences with 
regard  to  socioeconomic  and  clinical  baseline  data 
were found between patients who were included before 
and  after  practice  randomization.  In  the  intervention 
group,  the  proportion  of  missing  follow-up  data  was 
higher  compared  to  the  control  group,  but  altogether 
still similar to that in other studies on CBT-based inter-
ventions in primary care (13). The LMM analyses help 
to  avoid  an  overestimation  of  the  effects.  In  addition, 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on multiple 
imputation of missing data points which confirmed the 
results of the primary analysis. Even though the BAI is 
a generic measure of anxiety, it can be used to assess 
symptoms typically associated with panic disorder; its 
validity and sensitivity to change have been proven in 
the primary care setting (31, 37). The reliability of the 
BAI was excellent in our sample. Waiting times for the 
intervention should not have affected symptom sever-
ity: On the one hand, the general practitioners in both 
the  clinical  care 
groups  were  familiarized  with 
 guidelines;  on the  other,  patients of  the  control group 
benefited from participating in the study because they 
received well organized GP care and increased clinical 
attention (40).

Conclusion
GP practice teams (GP and practice nurse) can success-
fully  treat  patients  with  PDA  using  elements  of  CBT 
and  continuous  case  management.  The  intervention 
was  carried  out  in  small  GP  practices  which  are  the 
mainstay of primary care delivery in Germany. In this 
setting, resources are often limited and the implemen-
tation of complex collaborative care models is challen-
ging.

eMETHODS 

Detailed description of the methods
Study design and subjects
Jena-PARADIES  (Patient  Activation  foR  Anxiety  DIsordErS) 
was  a  cluster-randomized  intervention  study  with  a  two-arm 
 parallel  group  design  (intervention  group  versus  treatment-as-
usual(TAU)  control  group)  (17).  To  prevent  contamination  of 
control group patients, GP practices were the randomization units 
(clusters).  

Patients were screened by the teams of the participating GP 
practices,  using  the  Overall Anxiety  Severity  and  Impairment 
Scale (OASIS) (18) and the panic modules of the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ) (19). The general practitioner invited pa-
tients with suspicious scores for a diagnostic interview during 
which the patient’s eligibility for participating in the study was 
verified using validated ICD-10 check lists (20). 

Only  adult  patients  with  PDA  (ICD-10:  F41.0  or  F40.01) 
were  included  in  the  study.  The  exclusion  criteria  were  as 
 follows:  suicidality,  psychotic  or  substance-related  disorders, 
severe  physical  impairments,  pregnancy  or  ongoing  anxiety-
specific  psychotherapy.  The  general  practitioners  were 
 responsible  for  including  eligible  patients  and  obtaining  their 
informed consents to study participation.

Randomization
After a three-month recruitment period for each practice, cluster 
randomization  of  the  GP  practices  was  performed  (allocation 
ratio  1:1).  The  randomization  list  was  computer-generated  and 
not  known  to  the  study  team. The  randomization  was  stratified 
according to practice location (urban versus rural). This stratifi-
cation was made to account for the regional differences in access 
to specialist care. Three month after the first patients of a practice 
had been enrolled in the study—or earlier, if in the practice four 
patients  had  already  been  recruited—the  practices  were  ran -
domized  (retrieval  of  allocation  status  from  a  centrally  stored 
electronic  randomization 
the 
 allocation status to the practice team). At baseline examination, 
patients were not informed (blinded) about the allocation status 
of their GP practice.

Training of the practice teams
To  facilitate  patient  recruitment  and  to  harmonize  the  standard 

treatment (TAU) provided by the various GP practices, the prac-
tice teams (the general practitioner and the practice nurse [Medi-
zinische Fachangestellte, MFA]) received a basic training of 2.5 
hours  duration  at  the  time  of  inclusion  in  the  study.  The  basic 
training relied on recommendations from clinical guidelines (6). 
It comprised the use of the diagnostic instruments and the formal-
ities of the patient inclusion procedure which were developed ac-
cording to good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines. The practice 
nurses  were  specifically  trained  to  conduct  the  screening  of 
 patients  in  the  waiting  room  of  the  GP  practice.  Practice  teams 
 allocated  to  the  study’s  intervention  arm  received  in  addition  a 
3-hour training how to conduct the study-related intervention and 
detailed treatment manuals.

team–supported  exposure 

Interventions
The  practice 
training  comprised 
 evidence-based  elements  of  CBT  (psychoeducation,  interocep-
tive  and  situational  anxiety  exposure  exercises)  (21)  as  well  as 
 intervention elements from the chronic care model (22). Interven-
tion group patients received a therapy companion book, provid-
ing information about psychoeducation and how to perform the 
exercises, and exposure log sheets. During a period of 23 weeks, 
4 structured GP visits were scheduled; in the first three visits, an 
introduction  to  elements  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  was 
given.  Starting from  the  second  GP  visit,  patients  were  encour-
aged to independently perform exposure exercises at least twice a 
week. To assess current symptoms of anxiety at regular intervals 
and  to  enhance  treatment  adherence,  the  practice  nurse  carried 
out  checklist-based  telephone  monitoring  (23).  In  case  of  sub -
optimal  monitoring  results,  the  general  practitioners  could 
 arrange  for  additional  patient  contacts  and/or  adaptions  to  be 
made to the exercise plan. Patients in the control group received 
treatment as usual, i.e. guideline-based psychosocial or psycho-
pharmacological treatment (6, 24). The general practitioners were 
free to administer whatever treatment they deemed necessary and 
make referrals at their own discretion.

Endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  clinical  severity  of  the  anxiety 
symptoms  measured  using  the  Beck  Anxiety  Inventory  (BAI) 
(25).  The  patients  used  this  instrument  to  rate  how  severely

 affected they had been by 21 typical symptoms of anxiety (range 
0–63) during the last week. The BAI is a standard instrument for 
measuring the intensity of symptoms of anxiety; it can be used to 
measure the typical symptoms of a panic disorder. The BAI has 
good  psychometric  features;  its  validity  and  sensitivity  to 
changes have been proven in a primary care setting too (31, 37). 

The secondary endpoints included
● number  and  severity  of  panic  attacks,  measured  using  2 
items  (A1,  A2)  of  the  panic  and  agoraphobia  scale  (PAS) 
(26)

● agoraphobic avoidance behavior, measured using the mobil-

ity inventory (MI), “alone“ subscale (27);

● depression measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire, 

depression subscale (PHQ-9) (19);

● patient  evaluation  of  the  medical  care  received,  measured 
using  the  Patient  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness  Care 
(PACIC) (28).

Measurements were performed at baseline (T0), at 6-month 
follow-up  (T1)  and  at  12-month  follow-up  (T2).  Patient-side 
baseline  variables  were  reported  by  the  patients  or  by  their 
 general practitioners.

Sample size calculation
With  a  standard  deviation  of  the  BAI  of  11  (2),  a  standardized 
 effect  size  of  0.35  (i.e.  a  BAI  mean  difference  of  3.85  points) 
could  be  demonstrated  with  a  power  of  80%  in  a  patient-
 randomized  study  with  130  patients  per  treatment  group,  using 
the t test. Assuming an intracluster correlation of 0.07 (2) and a 
cluster  size  of  6,  a  design  effect  of  1.35  (correction  factor  for 
sample size adaption with cluster randomization) was calculated. 
When in addition  a dropout rate of  20% was  assumed,  222 pa-
tients from 37 practices per treatment group were required.

Statistical analyses
The statistical analyses were performed using the software SAS, 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The baseline character-
istics of the study participants and additional variables were de-
scribed  using  relevant  descriptive  statistics.  The  statistical  tests 
were performed as two-sided tests; the significance level was set 
at  α = 0.05.  The  primary  hypothesis  test  (regarding  the  primary 
endpoint BAI) was regarded as confirmatory. All other statistical 
tests were exploratory in nature. The statistical analyses followed 
the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle (“analyzed as randomized“). 
For  the  analysis  of  intervention  effects,  linear  mixed  models 
(LMMs)  and  generalized  LMMs,  taking  the  hierarchical  data 
structure  into  account  (maximum  likelihood  method),  were 
adapted (29). These models can correctly take missing data points 
into account; they deliver unbiased parameter estimates for data 
missing at random. (29). The patients nested in the GP practice 
were  included  in  the  LMM  (which  had  been  adapted  for  the 
 primary analysis) as random factors; the practice location (urban 
versus  rural),  the  treatment  group  (intervention  versus  control), 
the time of measurement (baseline [T0] versus 6-month follow-

up  [T1]  versus  12-month  follow-up  [T2])  as  well  as  the 
 interaction  between  the  factors  “treatment  group”  and  “time  of 
measurement” were included as fixed factors. Fixed-effects esti-
mators are reported with 95% confidence intervals. The statistical 
test for clinical improvements referred to the interaction between 
the factors treatment group and time. To find out whether missing 
data  had  influenced  the  result  of  the  primary  analysis,  we 
 performed a sensitivity analysis based on multiple imputation of 
missing data points. The secondary endpoints were analyzed in a 
similar way: LMMs or generalized LMMs were adapted in such a 
way that the patients nested in the GP practices were included as 
random  factors,  while  the  treatment  group  (intervention  versus 
control), the time of measurement (baseline [T0] versus 6-month 
follow-up  [T1]  versus  12-month  follow-up  [T2])  as  well  as  the 
interaction  between  the  factors  “treatment  group”  and  “time  of 
measurement” were included as fixed factors. The corresponding 
explorative tests for clinical improvements again referred to the 
interaction between the factors treatment group and time.

Using  the  “clinical  significance“  approach  (30),  dichoto-
mous  measures  for  response  to  treatment  and  for  remission 
were  calculated.  “Response“  was  defined  as  a  statistically 
 reliable BAI score decrease. “Remission“ was defined as a BAI 
score  decrease  below  the  weighted  midpoint  between  the 
 empirical BAI score distribution in our sample (T0) and a com-
parable patient sample without anxiety disorders (30, 31). The 
data  on  remission  after  12  months  were  used  to  calculate  the 
number needed to treat (NNT).

Sensitivity analysis
To test whether missing data influenced the result of the primary 
analysis and thus to verify the robustness of this analysis, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis which substituted the missing data 
using  a  multiple  imputation  method.  With  this  method,  the 
 missing  data  points  on  the  primary  endpoint  (BAI)  were  esti-
mated  using  the  least-squares  method.  The  multiple  imputation 
was performed based on the input variables age, sex, education 
(year),  partnership  status  (living  alone  versus  with  a  partner), 
presence  of  comorbid  agoraphobia  (yes  versus  no),  practice 
 location  (urban  versus  rural),  as  well  as  individual  scores 
 obtained at all time points of the questionnaires BAI, mobility in-
ventory (MI), Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS, Items A1 und 
A2), Patient Health Questionnaire (depression subscale, PHQ-9), 
EuroQoL  (EQ-5D),  and  Patient  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness 
Care (PACIC). Altogether, 5 datasets were imputed. The result of 
the  sensitivity  analysis  supported  the  findings  of  the  primary 
analysis: The reduction in the mean BAI scores was greater in the 
intervention group compared to the control group. The difference 
between the treatment groups with regard to the mean BAI score 
was  at  6-month  follow-up  (T1)  −2.8  points  (95%  CI:  [−5.3; 
−0.2]) and at 12-month follow-up (T2) −3.6 points [−6.4; −0.7]. 
As in the primary analysis, a significant interaction of the factors 
“treatment group” and “time of measurement” was found in the 
sensitivity analysis (p = 0.026).
