Abstract
The post-discharge period is an extremely vulnerable period for patients, particularly for those discharged from inpatient 
children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Poor discharge practices and discontinuity of care can put children 
and youth at heightened risk for readmission, among other adverse outcomes. However, there is limited understanding of the 
structure and effectiveness of interventions to facilitate discharges from CAMHS. As such, a scoping review was conducted 
to identify the literature on discharge interventions. This scoping review aimed to describe key components, designs, and 
outcomes of existing discharge interventions from CAMHS. Nineteen documents were included in the final review. Discharge 
interventions were extracted and summarized for pre-discharge, post-discharge, and bridging elements. Results of this scoping 
review found that intervention elements included aspects of risk assessment, individualized care, discharge preparation, com-
munity linkage, psychoeducation, and follow-up support. Reported outcomes of discharge interventions were also extracted 
and included positive patient and caregiver satisfaction, improved patient health outcomes, and increased cost effectiveness. 
Literature on discharge interventions from inpatient CAMHS, while variable in structure, consistently underscore the role 
of such interventions in minimizing patient and family vulnerability post-discharge. However, findings are limited by inad-
equate reporting and heterogeneity across studies. There is a need for further research into the design, implementation, and 
evaluation of interventions to support successful discharges from inpatient child and adolescent mental health care.

Introduction

Discharge from psychiatric inpatient care can be a time of 
vulnerability for patients due to the complexity of instruc-
tions,  transitions  between  care  providers,  and  shifts  in 
responsibility of those involved [1–3]. These risks may be 
even more pressing for the pediatric age group, a demo-
graphic more likely to experience the onset of mental illness 
than any other age group [4]. In the United States, pediatric 
mental health admissions have increased approximately 50%

in the past fifteen years [5] and a doubling of emergency 
department visits related to suicidal attempts and suicidal 
ideation  among  youth  during  2007–2015  [6].  Existing 
research has shown preventable adverse events, risk of sui-
cidality, and readmissions are heightened during the post-
discharge period [2, 7–11]. Inadequate discharge practices 
can contribute to disjointed care coordination, greater risk 
of relapse, and poorer patient health outcomes [12].

Inpatient psychiatric admission can pose considerable 
stress for the patient and their family [13–15], and readmis-
sions can introduce further personal and health care costs 
[16, 17]. Readmission may reflect the quality of inpatient 
care, discharge planning, and aftercare provided in the men-
tal health care system [18]. Readmission rates for children 
and youth have been shown in the literature to range from 
12–65% in the year following discharge [19–21]. The 30-day 
unplanned readmission rate for children with a mental health 
presentation has been calculated to be higher (8%) for those 
with a non-mental health presentation (6.2%) [22]. Col-
lectively, these findings suggest an urgent need to examine

interventions to reduce readmissions and support youth in 
the post-discharge period.

interventions for children and adolescents (< 18 years old) 
receiving inpatient mental health care?

Discharge interventions are defined as single or multi-
faceted interventions involving personal contact between 
the patient and their care team (i.e. hospital staff, commu-
nity workers, service providers) that aim to prevent or solve 
anticipated problems in subsequent outpatient or post-dis-
charge care, facilitate continuity of care, and reduce adverse 
events  post-discharge  [23–26].  Discharge  interventions 
have been evaluated to some extent in both child and adult 
inpatient and outpatient settings [9, 26, 27]. However, the 
effectiveness of these interventions has not been extensively 
described or evaluated in the child and adolescent mental 
health care services (CAMHS) [28]. Systematic reviews 
examining transitional interventions or discharge planning 
from inpatient to outpatient settings have limited their inclu-
sion criteria to the adult population (> 18 years old) [29–32] 
or have focused primarily on interventions taking place in 
vocational or educational settings [28]. A recent scoping 
review identified discharge planning as a core component 
of transitions from CAMHS [33], yet there is limited litera-
ture reviewing the components of interventions facilitating 
successful discharges from inpatient CAMHS and whether 
current interventions are effective.

To address this gap, this scoping review aims to explore 
literature on interventions that facilitate discharges from 
inpatient CAMHS. Specifically, this review will (1) describe 
the key components and (2) identify outcomes of existing 
discharge intervention from inpatient CAMHS. Through 
this review, we hope to identify knowledge gaps in inpatient 
CAMHS discharge interventions described to-date.

Methodology

This review follows the scoping review framework outlined 
by Arksey and O’Malley [34], and further refined by Levac 
et  al.  [35].  The  PRISMA  extension  for  scoping  reviews 
(PRISMA-Scr)  checklist  [36]  was  used  in  the  reporting 
of the results. The six steps of the framework are further 
described below.

Stage 2: identifying relevant studies

Search strategies were drafted by a research librarian (FI) 
using subject heading and text word terms based on the key 
concepts of the research question, and then further refined 
through discussions with other members of the research 
team (KC, AC). Terms for the concept of discharge included 
intervention, aftercare, and transition. Terms for the concept 
of mental health care included mental health and psychiat-
ric combined with services, recovery and hospital. Terms 
focusing on youth were also included. Once the initial search 
was finalized in Medline (Ovid), it was translated for the 
following additional databases, Embase (Ovid), PscyINFO 
(Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Applied Social Sciences 
Index and Abstracts (ProQuest). The results included all 
articles published up until the date of the search (May 30, 
2019). The full search strategy for Medline is available in 
Online Resource 1.

A grey literature search was conducted using Google 
Advanced and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Tech-
nologies in Health search tool, “Grey Matters” [38] using the 
search terms listed above. Additional studies were identified 
through hand-searching of reference lists of eligible articles 
not included or not captured by electronic databases.

The research team came to consensus on inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for study articles. To be included in the 
review, studies needed to (1) describe a discharge interven-
tion; (2) be inclusive of a child and adolescent population 
(< 18 years old) with a primary mental health and/or addic-
tion concern or diagnosis; and (3) be conducted in an inpa-
tient hospital setting. Interventions that were exclusively 
based  in  the  emergency  department  or  forensic  settings 
were excluded from this review as these settings may offer 
greater variability in the admission process. For instance, the 
majority of pediatric mental health emergency department 
visits end in discharge rather than admissions [39]. Due to 
resource constraints, documents that were not available in 
English were also excluded.

Stage 1: identifying the research question

Stage 3: study selection

This scoping review aims to explore what is known from 
the  literature  about  interventions  facilitating  discharges 
from  inpatient  CAMHS.  Discharge  interventions  were 
defined as interventions at any point of the care pathway 
that aimed to support patients with anticipated issues once 
discharged from inpatient services [31, 32, 37]. The research 
question guiding this scoping review was: what are the dis-
charge components, designs, and outcomes of discharge 

Title and abstract review

Article screening was conducted in a two-stage process. Two 
researchers (AC and CD) first pilot tested the eligibility cri-
teria on a random sample of 30 articles. Discrepancies were 
identified and minor changes were made to the eligibility cri-
teria to ensure clarity and consistency in the review process. 
Using Covidence software [35], two reviewers (AC, CD) 
then independently evaluated the title and abstracts to the

inclusion criteria, and a third reviewer (KC) was consulted 
for conflict resolution. All study methodologies (experi-
mental, quasi-experimental, observational studies) and non-
research studies (review articles, dissertations documents, 
conference papers) that described discharge interventions 
for inpatient CAMHS were included. Title and abstracts of 
gray literature were not reviewed at this stage due to lack of 
abstracts and the length of documents. Studies focusing on 
populations ≥ 18 years with a primary diagnosis of autism 
spectrum disorders, developmental disorders, or intellectual 
disorders and without a primary diagnosis of a mental ill-
ness were excluded. While often concurrent with mental 
disorders, the unique needs of this population and how they 
may present for admission may require interventions that are 
distinct from those with a primary mental illness diagnosis 
[40, 41].

Full‑text review

Full-text review of the selected peer-review articles and gray 
literature documents were subsequently screened by review-
ers AC and CD for eligibility using the inclusion criteria. 
KC was consulted in the event of a conflict for resolution. 
Conference abstracts and posters were excluded given insuf-
ficient detail provided for extraction.

Stage 4: charting the data

Two reviewers (AC, CD) developed a data-charting form 
to determine the data to extract with additional review by 
KC. This data-charting form was updated in an iterative 
manner. Data extraction included document characteristics 
(i.e., author, title, document type, country of origin, set-
ting), research question, aims and objectives, sample size 
and description, study design, methods, intervention service 
providers, description of intervention and its components, 
outcomes, evaluative measures, results, and future direc-
tions. For non-studies, it was specified where some catego-
ries were not applicable. The reviewers extracted data from 
two randomly selected articles to ensure reliability of the 
content entered in the data-charting form. The remaining 
articles were divided, and the reviewers performed inde-
pendent data extraction.

Using the scoping review’s research question as a guide, a 
directed content analysis approach was used to organize and 
analyze the data [42]. During this iterative process, duplicate 
components or characteristics were removed, and categories 
with the same content were merged. This process facilitated 
the process of identification and classification of discharge 
intervention components.

Stage 5: collating, summarizing, and reporting 
results

To provide an overview of the target population, intervention 
provided, and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was conducted, 
a process which entailed reviewing the documents and com-
ponents of discharge interventions described. Arskey and 
O’Malley’s [34] descriptive-analytic approach was used to 
help identify patterns and themes among discharge interven-
tion components. The research team engaged in an iterative 
process of reviewing the interventions, removing duplicate 
components or characteristics, and collapsing content with 
similar components. The included documents’ methodologi-
cal quality or risk of bias were not critically assessed given the 
aims of this scoping review.

To address our first research question regarding interven-
tion structure, this paper adapted a taxonomy for discharge 
interventions originally described by Hansen et al. [43] and 
since replicated in other peer-reviewed articles examining 
discharge interventions [24, 44]. Hansen et al. [43] described 
single interventions which fell into three temporal categories: 
pre-discharge (interventions taking place prior to hospital 
discharge), post-discharge (interventions supporting patients’ 
post-hospital discharge), and bridging (interventions that begin 
prior to discharge and support patients through different care 
settings). This taxonomy was applied to organize the inter-
vention components of this scoping review along a temporal 
continuum.

To address the intervention components themselves, the 
NICE guideline was utilized. NICE highlights a pathway for 
discharge from inpatient mental health services to community 
or care home support [45]. The pathway highlighted seven 
components: caregiver and patient involvement, discharge 
planning, psychological interventions, peer support consid-
eration, planning of care to support discharge, follow-up sup-
port, and reduction of readmissions. These NICE principles 
were reviewed by the research team and used as an overarching 
framework to identify and organize components of the dis-
charge interventions in this scoping review.

Outcomes reported by the papers identified were analyzed 
and grouped according to the Triple Aim Framework. This 
framework was developed by the Institute for Healthcare 
Improvement as an approach to optimizing health system 
performance [46]. The framework is based on the following 
three aims: (1) improving the individual experience of care; 
(2) improving the health of populations; and (3) reducing per 
capita costs of care for populations [46].

Results

Database and grey literature searches resulted in a total 
of 3597 scholarly titles and 26 documents. After remov-
ing duplicates, 3585 titles and abstracts were screened, 
for which 110 documents met criteria for full-text review. 
Figure  1  displays  the  screening  and  exclusion  process 
in greater detail. In total, 17 scholarly articles and two 
grey literature documents, consisting of a published pres-
entation and dissertation, were included and eligible for 
extraction.

Table 1 features the extracted characteristics of docu-
ments included for final review. Articles were published 
between 1972 and 2018, with 37% (n = 7) of papers pub-
lished prior to 2000. The majority of articles (84%) were 
published in North America (nine from USA, seven from 
Canada), and the remaining three articles were from New

Zealand, Germany, and the UK. Of the 17 academic arti-
cles included, most (63%) were descriptive reports. There 
was  significant  clinical  heterogeneity  reflected  among 
studies: there were three mixed-method studies, two ran-
domized controlled trials, one feasibility study, and one 
validation study. The majority of articles included a broad 
spectrum of mental health conditions, including psychotic, 
bipolar, depressive, anxiety, substance-related and addic-
tive, personality, and conduct disorders. These discharge 
interventions predominately took place in child and ado-
lescent psychiatric units, with a few studies involving the 
emergency  department,  mobile  clinics,  schools  and/or 
community agencies.

Discharge intervention structures

Discharge interventions reported in the reviewed literature 
were varied in structure, owing to a lack of standardization

of the terms “discharge intervention” and the diversity in 
settings and populations across projects. Most discharge 
interventions (n = 9) were structured as a standalone pro-
gram  [47–54].  These  programs  were  longitudinal,  mul-
ticomponent, and often featured a multidisciplinary team 
that was responsible for supporting patient discharge. Four 
programs described bridging aspects with case management, 
clinical services, discharge planning and referrals to outpa-
tient community resources to maintain continuity of care for 
the patient [47–50]. Two programs supporting patients in 
maintaining clinical stability, improving family functioning, 
and building vocational and social skills through therapy 
and counselling [51, 52]. Another two papers described pro-
grams which provided care coordination between the hospi-
tal, family, and school to support the child’s transition back 
to school after discharge [53, 54].

Other discharge interventions (n = 3) described discharge 
tools or strategies for professionals to facilitate the dis-
charge process. These interventions included feasibility of 
a safety planning smartphone application [55], motivational 
interviewing at the time of discharge to identify barriers to 
attending outpatient appointments [56], and narrative dis-
charge letters, collaboratively prepared by the health care 
team and patient to facilitate reflection and communication 
[57].

The roles of different health professionals in the discharge 
process were also highlighted in the reviewed literature. For 
example, some articles (n = 2) described a designated role 
or position that provided the discharge intervention. Clev-
erley et al. reviewed the role of Transition Support Workers 
(TSW) in the transition from hospital to community [58]. 
TSWs function as case managers, assist with discharge plan-
ning, system navigation, individual and family therapy, and 
client advocacy [58]. Leung described a similar role, the 
Senior Therapist, who held responsibilities in case manage-
ment and facilitating family interviews, therapeutic sessions 
with the patient and crisis intervention, and arranging fol-
low-up services [59].

Question 1: key components of discharge 
interventions

Publications were reviewed for commonalities in compo-
nents. Based on the interventions classified in each temporal 
category of Hansen and al.’s taxonomy, five papers were 
classified as pre-discharge interventions [48, 55–57, 59], 
four were post-discharge interventions [52, 60–62], and ten 
were bridging interventions [33, 47, 49–51, 53, 54, 63–65] 
(see Table 2). Core components of the interventions (see 
Table 3), described further below, were identified as: (1) risk 
screening and assessment, (2) individualized care, (3) client

discharge preparation, (4) community linkage, (5) psychoe-
ducation, and (6) follow-up support. 

Risk screening and assessment

Several interventions (n = 5) described an intake process 
with discussions at time of admission that allowed the health 
care team to gather information on the accommodations 

necessary for the patients during hospitalization and post-
discharge. This meeting was described as a part of the intake 
of clients or patients in the intervention, with the goal of 
reducing readmission [60]. Meetings covered topics such as 
client issues and conflicts with family or other community 
agencies [62] and their “medical, therapeutic, vocational, 
social, recreational, and housing needs” [49]. Stelzer et al. 
described an interdisciplinary intake meeting exploring cli-
ent issues and conflicts [62]. The assessment process in the 
Transition Program described by Drell et al. was key to other 
interventions to assess suitability for early discharge, provid-
ing adequate community support [48]. Other interventions 
were designed such that participants previously identified as 
a high risk would be referred as a candidate for the program 
[64]. Patients’ needs were then reassessed in an iterative 
manner throughout the course of intervention [48, 60, 62, 
64].

Individualized care

Structuring the intervention to the needs of the patient was 
discussed as a means of encouraging rapport and adherence. 
Many authors (n = 5) discussed the task of case management 
in tailoring treatment and discharge plan to the patients’ 
needs [50, 58–60, 65]. Interventions included personalized 
goal-setting tools and identifying barriers to services that 
would allow the healthcare team to then determine safety 
plans [64], work with them toward identified goals [54], or 
possible solutions in the discharge plan [47, 48, 58]. For the 
models that focused on early discharge, individualized treat-
ment plans were developed for the patients in collaboration 
with other health professionals and services [60, 63]. Two 
studies included elements of advocacy to ensure patients had 
appropriate and preferred care for that patient and family 
[58, 63]. Ensuring smaller patient caseloads per staff allowed 
for greater flexibility in tailored services.

Client discharge preparation

Numerous papers (n = 7) described an element of discharge 
planning, which is defined as the coordinated process of sup-
porting the client from hospital and into the community [27]. 
The approach to discharging the client in these interventions 
was presented in a variety of different forms. Bobier et al. 
described a narrative discharge letter that the team wrote in 
collaboration with the client for its therapeutic value [57]. 
Roles such as the Transition Support Worker or community-
based case manager worked within the care team to spear-
head the discharge planning process [58, 63]. Chiappetta 
et al. described an intervention that used motivational inter-
viewing to explore post-discharge obstacles and solutions 
and allowed for better individualization of resources [56]. 
Similarly, other tools, such as the Preparedness Assessment 

1 3European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2022) 31:857–878 

869

Tool, has been used in monitoring preparedness and inform-
ing post-discharge coordination [64]. This discharge process 
could also involve multidisciplinary input and welcomed the 
involvement of the family and client. Roy and Helt described 
organized opportunities for patients and family members to 
raise issues and concerns that they faced during the post-
discharge period and could cover several broad topics, such 
as health, recreational activities, basic needs, finances, and 
employment [61]. Gregory et al. described a smartphone 
application which reviews safety planning around time of 
discharge [55].

Community linkage

Many articles (n = 8) emphasized the involvement of com-
munity agencies or services within their intervention. Sev-
eral authors referenced that health professionals would assist 
the clients or patients in identifying resources and making 
referrals to community agencies [47, 50, 58, 63]. Furedy 
et al. and Lurie et al. integrated exposure to community 
services, vocational counselling, and supporting patients in 
building skills that would support them in post-discharge 
community  integration  [51,  52].  Wasylenki  et  al.  also 
described the maintenance of those relationships with the 
community, even keeping a list of doctors and psychiatrists 
in caring for them [49]. Weiss et al. described a “Connect 
and Reflect” program where adults may consistently check 
in with a student recently discharged to promote greater con-
nectedness in school [53].

Psychoeducation

A number of interventions (n = 8) also included psychoe-
ducation for both the patient and the parent to ensure that 
they were adequately supporting post-discharge. Services for 
clients were focused on building coping strategies, manag-
ing emotions [47], and self-management skills [61]. Several 
interventions included parental involvement, and interven-
tions delivered psychoeducation through parent psychother-
apy groups [53, 54, 56, 64], peer-to-peer support [47, 61], 
supportive therapy [58, 63], problem-solving and awareness 
[61].

Follow‑up support

Lastly,  seven  post-discharge  or  bridging  interventions 
described an element of follow-up support to ensure con-
tinuity  of  benefits  the  intervention  provided  and  reduce 
readmission. Furedy et al. described weekly team meetings 
discussing the progress on the problems they had identified 
during admission and crisis [51]. Hennessy also arranged 
post-discharge care through two in-person meetings and 
phone calls, each time monitoring the patient’s hope and 

resources [64]. Leung described crisis intervention as a fol-
low-up service for the patient and family [59]. Therapeutic 
groups were held by Lurie et al. and Stelzer et al. weekly to 
discuss post-hospital adjustment [52, 62]. Phone calls were 
also another means of following-up with patients [49, 62]. 
White used face-to-face therapy, group support, phone calls, 
and continuity of provider to ensure patient follow-up [54].

Question 2: discharge intervention outcomes

Outcomes were classified as described in the methods sec-
tion using the Triple Aim Framework [46] (see Table 4).

Patient experience

Most studies (n = 9) used qualitative measures to capture 
patient, family, or provider satisfaction of the intervention 
itself [48, 50, 51, 53, 57–59, 62, 65]. Bobier et al. captured 
specific feedback regarding the format and utility of their 
letter intervention [57]. Their study asked youth, “What did 
you think about the amount of information packed in the let-
ter?” and “Was the language and style of the letter useful for 
you?” Articles commented on the positive feedback received 
from participants on the intervention’s format or delivery 
[57], increased socialization and cohesion among partici-
pants [52], and overall positive reception of the interventions 
from the participant and/or their parent [48, 58, 59, 62, 65].
Other studies used quantitative measures to assess the 
uptake of an intervention into clinical practice or a patient’s 
preparation  around  discharge.  Hennessy  explored  the 
potential association of a patient’s preparedness at time of 
discharge with future readmission through a Preparedness 
Assessment Tool [64]. A feasibility study by Gregory et al. 
measured the prevalence of smartphone ownership and the 
youths’ interest in downloading the ‘Be Safe’ smartphone 
application [55]. Patient compliance with follow-up outpa-
tient appointments following the interventions was another 
captured outcome, suggesting effectiveness of this inter-
vention in facilitating outpatient care and patient motiva-
tion to attend appointments [48, 56]. Furedy et al. used case 
notes, patients’ ratings, and staff observations of behavioral 
changes to address suicidal or assaultive behavior to dem-
onstrate positive impact of the behavior modifications in the 
interventions [51].

Population health

Population health outcomes specifically related to adher-
ence to care (including disease-specific outcomes), patient-
reported health and quality of life, and self-care skills. Such 
outcomes were captured in thirteen studies. Baker et al. used 
the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-
2), Children’s Depression Inventory Self-Report (CDI-2

SR),  Adolescent  Alcohol  and  Drug  Involvement  Scale 
(AADIS), and the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales 
for Children and Adolescent (HoNOSCA), and prelimi-
nary results of these measures showed reductions in overall 
anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder-related symptoms, 
panic, depressive symptoms, and reductions in the number 
of clients meeting the organization’s high-risk criteria [47]. 
Ougrin et al. utilized the Strengths and Difficulties Question-
naire (SDQ), the Self-Harm questionnaire, the Children’s 
Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), and Goal Attainment 
Score (GAS), with no significant differences found in symp-
tom and functioning outcomes between the discharge inter-
vention and usual care groups [65]. Boege et al. also used the 
CGAS measure and found increased scores in both interven-
tion and control groups, with significant within-group com-
parisons CGAS scores, indicating improvement in patients’ 
clinical level of functioning before and after the discharge 
intervention [60]. The discharge intervention described by 
White et al. also resulted in improved clinical functioning in 
their intervention focused on improving CAMHS inpatient 
discharges among youth re-entering intensive school ser-
vices, as measured by the Child and Adolescent Functional 
Assessment Scale (CAFAS) [54].

Effectiveness of discharge interventions were assessed 
through a number of outcome indicators, including com-
pletion of intervention [63], number of community refer-
rals or placements made [48, 49], involvement in post-dis-
charge services or community [47, 56, 64, 65], emergency 
department visits or readmission [47–51, 58, 62–64], and 
number of other adverse effects, such as medication side 
effects, school or occupational disciplinary action, risky and 
impulsive behaviors, and encounters with law enforcement 
[64]. Results of interventions demonstrated increased num-
ber of patients involved in post-discharge services [47, 63, 
64], decreased emergency department readmissions [47], 
increased patients having a planned post-discharge follow-
up [56] and increased number of patients with a community 
referral [47–49]. In the time-limited hospitalization model 
described by Roy and al., the majority (96%) of patients 
successfully completed the intervention, with only 2% of 
participants readmitted to the unit [63]. Ougrin et al. evalu-
ated reintegration into community through post-discharge 
outcomes of study participants, such as increased attend-
ance in the community, decreased unemployed days, and 
increased days spent in education, or in training [65].

System cost

The third aim outlines costs to the healthcare system. Cost 
outcomes of discharge interventions were captured as cal-
culations of cost effectiveness [65], costs of health services 
[60], length of stay [48, 50, 60, 63], or total days spent in 
psychiatric  inpatient  treatment  [65].  Boege  et  al.  found 

significantly lower total healthcare costs of their “home 
treatment  brings  inpatient  treatment  outside”  discharge 
intervention compared to usual care, factoring in length of 
stay, costs of hospitalization, therapy, and services [60]. 
Ougrin et al. used the CGAS and quality-adjusted life-years 
to evaluate cost effectiveness, calculating a probability of 
at least 50% that a supported discharge service is more cost 
effective than usual care, irrespective of willingness to pay, 
in addition to decreased inpatient days at six months follow-
ing randomization [65]. Several other studies also measured 
length of stay as an outcome of their intervention [48, 50, 
56, 63, 65]. Cameron et al. found that the Bridge Program 
resulted in reduced length of stay in the Young Adult Pro-
gram (YAP) by almost 2 weeks (from 8.5 to 6.5 weeks) at 
the time of evaluation [50]. Doherty et al. reported that their 
bridging program was able to successfully deliver a treat-
ment program restricting length of stay to 28 days, with a 
range of 1–71 days [63].

Discussion

We identified 17 peer-reviewed articles and two grey litera-
ture documents for the review the components and settings 
of existing discharge interventions for inpatient children and 
adolescents in CAMHS, and their outcomes. All articles and 
documents discussed the promise and benefit of discharge 
interventions. Many interventions featured multiple compo-
nents which assisted the discharge process for youth being 
discharged from inpatient CAMHS, including, a thorough 
assessment of the child’s needs [48, 49, 60, 62, 64], tailor-
ing resources and services to needs and preferences [47, 48, 
50, 58–60, 63–65], hospital discharge planning [55, 57, 58, 
61, 63, 64], community linkage [47, 49–53, 58, 63], fam-
ily education and support [47, 53, 54, 56, 58, 61, 63, 64], 
and a protocol in place for follow-up [49, 51, 52, 54, 59, 
62, 64]. These discharge interventions demonstrated posi-
tive improvement in patient experiences or health outcomes 
[47–65]. Outcomes were identified across the dimensions 
of the Triple Aim, with the majority focused on population 
health outcomes.

This review highlights variability in the format, struc-
ture, and content of discharge interventions for inpatient 
youth attending CAMHS. The transitional discharge pro-
grams described by Furedy et al. [51] and Wasylenki et al. 
[49] were not specifically limited to pediatric populations 
and  younger  participants  may  have  therefore  been  sub-
jected to topics less applicable or relevant for their post-
discharge experience. However, the majority of included 
studies described interventions catered towards a pediatric 
or youth population with a range of mental health comor-
bidities at intake. The length of interventions ranged from 
over the patient’s admission course, time of discharge, and 

1 3874

several weeks-months of post-discharge support. The length 
of interventions varied depending on individual patient need. 
The diversity of the health professionals providing these 
interventions underscores the multidisciplinary nature of 
discharge planning—a process that involves a comprehen-
sive understanding of patient and family needs. Existing lit-
erature on discharge interventions highlight the important 
role of discharge interventions in transitioning and preparing 
patients for life beyond the hospital [2, 24, 27, 66–69]. This 
review provides a better understanding of how discharge 
interventions  improve  pediatric  outcomes.  Specifically, 
results of the reviewed documents reported interventions 
to be beneficial in improving patient clinical functioning 
and self-sufficiency, caregiver skills, post-discharge service 
attendance, as well as minimizing societal costs [47–51, 
53–56, 58, 60–65]. This is reflective of present literature, as 
highlighted in the article by Fontanella et al., who discussed 
the impact of discharge planning and timely aftercare on 
effectiveness of inpatient care and reducing readmissions 
[19]. The outcomes of this review also suggest discharge 
interventions were relevant and appreciated by the patient 
and their families, which may further support their reintegra-
tion to community post-discharge.

The interventions described in this scoping review were 
organized using existing frameworks that were created for 
different populations and settings. For instance, Hansen 
et  al.’s  [43]  taxonomy  of  interventions  using  the  three 
domains (i.e., pre-discharge, post-discharge, bridging inter-
ventions) was originally created to evaluating studies reduc-
ing rehospitalization within 30 days, and most of the studies 
included tested a single-component intervention. It proved 
challenging to adopt for the CAMHS discharge interventions 
included in this review, given the multicomponent nature 
of some discharge interventions. Bridging interventions 
often featured numerous different components that would 
have taken place before and/or after discharge (e.g., dis-
charge planning, patient education). It should be noted that 
the taxonomy used was merely used to broadly categorize 
discharge interventions and that there exists a diverse range 
of interventions within each individual domain itself. The 
development of future standardized protocols or frameworks 
for discharge interventions from CAMHS may contribute 
towards a more refined analysis of intervention components.
The features and components identified in the discharge 
interventions reviewed share a number of similarities with 
the effective discharge planning framework components 
identified by Yam et al. [70]. Their delphi study identified 
the needs of a structured, systematic, coordinated hospital 
discharge system to ensure smooth transition from hospi-
tal to community [70]. Yet, our review also highlighted the 
lack of standardized discharge protocols and subsequent 
evaluation, and that research to implement such frameworks 
is still in its early stages [31, 65, 70]. A report by Health 

Quality Ontario promotes standardization for transitional 
care of complex patients [71]. The document “Adopting a 
Common Approach to Transitional Care Planning: Help-
ing Health Links Improve Transitions and Coordination of 
Care” outlines discharge principles in three categories of 
transitional care: pre-transition practices, transition plan-
ning practices, and assessing post-transition risk and acti-
vating post-transition follow-up [71]. These principles align 
with our scoping review results—a priority on individual-
ized, patient-centered care that also includes patient and 
caregiver involvement, coordination of continuing care to 
other resources or services, community relationships, and 
optimized timing and location of health care services.

The findings of this review provide the foundation for the 
engagement of stakeholders (i.e., youth, families, and clini-
cians) to determine clinically meaningful outcomes by which 
to  evaluate  transition  interventions.  What  is  considered 
“clinically meaningful” may be variable upon the perspec-
tive but generally takes into account the factors, condition, 
population, and benefits and risks of present interventions 
[72, 73]. Such outcomes for this pediatric population may 
include other patient-oriented factors impacting long-term 
functioning, relationships, or quality of life. The transition 
from inpatient to outpatient care in CAMHS has been high-
lighted as a complex process, with timely care related to 
multiple patient-, hospital-, and community-level character-
istics [74]. As described by Fontanella et al., having previous 
experience of outpatient mental health care or connections 
with mental health providers is a strong predictor of link-
age to timely outpatient care [74]. Discharge interventions 
reported in this review described a designated role or pro-
gram that coordinated and advocated for such relationships 
with outpatient care and within their community [50, 58, 
59].

This review may support the design and implementation 
of effective discharge interventions for children and youth 
and encourages a critical examination of present initiatives 
for possible innovation. It may also provide the necessary 
foundation and scope for future research involving discharge 
interventions for CAMHS inpatients.

Future directions and implications

Limited guidelines and protocols in approaching discharge 
interventions may contribute to significant heterogeneity 
among the clinical sample, settings, intervention, and out-
comes. A number of identified articles were descriptive in 
nature and lacked proper research design, which unfortu-
nately limited the depth of analysis and conclusions drawn. 
Moreover, it precluded the authors’ abilities to conduct a 
deeper systematic review of the interventions identified. Dif-
fering definitions of a “discharge intervention” among stud-
ies and articles created further ambiguity during analysis. 

1 3European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2022) 31:857–878 

875

Future studies thus ought to be clearer as to what the dis-
charge process entails and how decisions about discharge are 
made. Literature searches for discharge interventions may 
also be adapted to focus on criteria excluded in this review, 
such as emergency department settings, or for populations 
with developmental disabilities. These populations may have 
unique additional supports and resources and warrant a sepa-
rate search and scoping review.

Researchers may also explore more rigorous methods 
(e.g., randomised controlled trials) to evaluate the impact 
of discharge interventions. Future research is needed to 
understand the elements of a good discharge intervention 
design, given that existing literature is limited in this area, 
particularly from the point of view of patients and/or car-
egivers. Integrating both discharge intervention elements 
and post-discharge timing elements may also effectively 
minimize adverse events once out of hospital and could be 
better examined under developing frameworks of discharge 
optimization [75].

Ultimately, our findings encourage a more rigorous evalu-
ation of discharge interventions and the tools used to define 
and assess discharge interventions for children and youth. 
Researchers would benefit from increased collaboration with 
stakeholders, particularly patients and their caregivers, and 
including their input in both the design and evaluative stages 
of these projects [76].

Limitations

This review has a number of limitations. First, the literature 
search was limited to the English language, which may have 
excluded articles that would have otherwise met eligibility 
criteria. Secondly, many interventions described a broader 
population, often describing a wide ranging population with-
out providing further details to the sample’s age distribution 
or describing a “youth” or “school-aged population” without 
formally or explicitly stating the ages of the sample [49, 53, 
54]. Consequently, the research team was required to make 
assumptions that these were pediatric populations. Thirdly, 
among the discharge interventions described in this review, 
the majority included were descriptive in nature. While there 
are some studies with promising findings, only a few of these 
have been evaluated, and even fewer in a controlled setting. 
Additionally, we faced difficulties in discerning which inter-
ventions described were truly “discharge” interventions, 
owing to the variability of intervention descriptions. Sev-
eral authors provided limited detail on their discharge pro-
tocol or how discharge decisions were made, which created 
challenges for the team when trying to organize and group 
interventions. More dated studies of this review provided 
poorer descriptions of population, study measures, or incom-
plete reporting of outcomes. Poor study population descrip-
tors and broad study settings without subgroup analysis for 

different age groups or settings may mean that the stated 
outcomes may be less applicable to children and youth in 
the psychiatric setting.

Conclusion

This scoping review presented evidence on the components 
and  outcomes  of  discharge  interventions  from  inpatient 
CAMHS settings. Common elements among interventions 
included risk assessment, individualized care, discharge 
preparation,  community  linkage,  psychoeducation,  and 
follow-up support. Promising outcomes included positive 
patient and caregiver satisfaction, improved patient health 
outcomes,  and  increased  cost  effectiveness.  Despite  the 
diversity among populations, goals, and outcomes of inter-
ventions, these components facilitate successful discharge 
processes and reduce likelihood of readmissions among chil-
dren and adolescents with psychiatric illnesses. Present find-
ings are limited by across-study heterogeneity, inadequate 
reporting, and lack of controlled study design. Findings may 
be used to promote the need for a deeper systematic analy-
sis of the outcomes of discharge interventions and a further 
evaluation of the elements supporting successful CAMHS 
discharges.
