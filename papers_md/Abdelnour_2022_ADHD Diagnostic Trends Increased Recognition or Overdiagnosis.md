Abstract

The prevalence of Attention 
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) has seen a consistent 
rise in recent years. These 
numbers spark a debate over 
the reason for the observed 
trends, with some concerned 
about over diagnosis and over 
prescription of stimulant 
medications, and others raising 
the issue of diagnostic disparities, 
particularly in underrepresented 
populations. In this paper we 
look at both sides, starting with 
the history of ADHD and its 
diagnostic criteria changes, from 
early concepts of alterations in 
attention and hyperactivity in 
the 19th and 20th century, to its 
introduction in the Diagnostical 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM), and its 
evolution into how it is defined 
today. The general broadening 
of ADHD diagnostically over 
time plays a role in the increased 
prevalence over the years, but it 
is not the only reason. Increased 
awareness of physicians and 
the public is also believed to 
play a big role, particularly in 
underrepresented minorities and 
women. However, there continues 
to be disparities in detection of 
ADHD in these groups. There 
are significant consequences to 

a patient’s social, interpersonal, 
and professional life when 
ADHD is left unrecognized and 
untreated. Thoughtful evaluation, 
accurate diagnosis, and adequate 
treatment can make a big 
difference.

Case History

Agatha has been struggling 
with school work since starting 
college in the fall. She always 
had difficulty paying attention 
in certain subjects, but did fairly 
well in high school. Lately she 
has been feeling more anxious 
because her study habits that 
worked throughout high school 
no longer seem to be effective. 
She feels completely inundated by 
the sheer volume and difficulty of 
her current assignments. She finds 
herself constantly procrastinating, 
regularly feeling guilty about her 
inability to adhere to deadlines. 
Problem sets are riddled with 
careless errors and papers contain 
numerous typos and grammatical 
errors. Sometimes, especially after 
doing poorly on an exam, guilt and 
anxiety about school become so 
high that she simply shuts down 
and avoids doing any work for 
the rest of the day. She has seen a 
lot of ADHD content on TikTok 
recently, and wonders if she may 
have ADHD herself. Her college

friend has offered her Adderall, and while she hasn’t 
taken it without a prescription, she wonders if she may 
benefit from it.

Introduction

The past couple of decades have seen a continuous 

increase in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) diagnoses. National population surveys 
reflect an increase in the prevalence from 6.1% to 
10.2% in the 20-year period from 1997 to 2016 
and experts continue to debate and disagree on the 
causes for this trend.1 On the one hand, while there 
are children whose diagnoses are irrefutable and 
undeniably require treatment, some experts worry 
about the risk of overdiagnosis and subsequent over 
prescription of stimulants and other psychotropics. 
Like with most psychotropic medications, treatment 
consideration needs to be carefully weighed with 
regards to potential adverse outcomes. For stimulants 
there is also concern for diversion and misuse of the 
medication for performance enhancement rather 
than for treatment. On the other hand, diagnostic 
disparities and underdiagnosis exist in various 
communities, including women and underrepresented 
minorities, as seen with Agatha. In this article, we aim 
to better understand the debate about the growing 
number of those affected by reviewing how ADHD 
morphed into the diagnosis we know today, and the 
variability and disparities observed.

The Basics

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder that globally affects 5% 
- 7.2% of youth and 2.5% - 6.7% of adults.2-4 Recent 
estimates indicate that prevalence is even higher in 
children in the United States (U.S.), around 8.7% or 
5.3 million.5 Although it has long been conceptualized 
as a disorder of childhood, up to 90% of children 
with ADHD continue to experience symptoms into 
adulthood.6 Obtaining a diagnosis in adulthood is also 
possible, as in one study, 75% of adults with ADHD 
were not previously diagnosed in childhood.7 While in 
childhood the male to female ratio is 4:1, the ratio is 
closer to 1:1 in adults.8

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is 
thought to be caused by a combination of factors: 
genetic, neurobiologic, and environmental. Twin 

468 | 119:5 | September/October 2022 | Missouri Medicine

studies show that ADHD is highly hereditable (60-
70%), and scientists have identified a number of genes 
believed to underlie vulnerability to the disorder.9 
This includes genes that regulate the expression of 
Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor, which plays a 
role in learning and memory, as well as those involved 
in modulation of the brain’s dopaminergic system.9 
Environmental risk factors like perinatal complications 
and toxic exposures are also believed to play a role.9-10 

ADHD is a clinical diagnosis, which is 
accomplished through questionnaires, clinical 
interview, and in some cases, neuropsychiatric testing. 
While neuroimaging studies suggest a potential 
correlation between ADHD and white matter volume 
abnormalities in cortico-striatal pathways and the 
prefrontal cortex in study samples, biomarkers are not 
currently sensitive enough to assist with diagnosis.

The treatment for ADHD is often a combination 

of medication, skill building, and psychotherapy. In 
the 1930s, Charles Bradley, MD, noticed a drastic 
improvement in children’s behavior and school 
performance after administration of amphetamine 
sulfate—a drug he was hoping would help treat 
headaches. That serendipitous discovery led to 
the development of other stimulants, a class of 
medications that is still considered the gold standard 
and first line ADHD treatment. Pharmacologic 
therapy is reported to be effective in up to 70% of 
cases, yet the benefits are not without risk.11 The most 
common side effects are decreased appetite, anxiety, 
nausea, headaches, and in children in particular, 
concern about tolerance, weight loss, and insomnia. 
Data on long-term stimulant use also remains limited. 
A recent literature review found long-term use to be 
generally safe, but authors did advise providers to use 
caution when prescribing stimulants to pre-school 
age children, adolescents at high risk of abuse, and 
children with tics and psychosis.12 

There are also many non-pharmacological 
modalities of treatment for ADHD, including 
behavioral parent training and mindfulness-based 
attention training.13-14 Psychotherapy, especially 
cognitive behavioral techniques, has also been 
shown to be quite effective.11   Finally, a newer non-
pharmacological approach, neurofeedback, has 
some benefits, though clinical application remains 
logistically challenging. More research is required into 
its efficacy.15

ADHD: Changes in Diagnostic 
Criteria Over Time

To understand its diagnostic trends, it is important 

to consider the origins of ADHD and its diagnostic 
criteria. In the Eighteenth century, Sir Alexander 
Crichton wrote one of the earliest documented clinical 
descriptions of a disorder in attention in his 1798 
book On Attention and its Diseases. He described 
“morbid alterations” of attention that “render 
[individuals] incapable of attending with constancy to 
any one object of education.”16 Although not globally 
recognized and treated at the time, his observations 
bear striking similarities to modern descriptions of the 
inattention domains of ADHD. 

In the early 1900s, British physician Sir George 
Frederic Still described a number of children with a 
“defect of moral control.”17 Although more similar 
to the modern concepts of conduct disorder (CD) or 
oppositional disorder (ODD), his description identified 
a number of features typically seen in ADHD like 
impulsivity and impaired frustration tolerance. Later, 
in the 1930s, physicians Kramer and Pollnow wrote 
about children with “hyperkinetic disease of infancy”, a 
syndrome that more closely resembled modern ADHD 
descriptions including both hyperactivity, emotional 
excitability and impulsivity, and inattention.17 

shift in focus towards attention deficit as the defining 
feature of the disorder. The publication of the DSM-
III in 1980 gave rise to the diagnosis of “attention 
deficit disorder,” or ADD, a term that remains part 
of popular vernacular to this day. The DSM-III also 
introduced a cutoff for the number of symptoms to 
earn the diagnosis, as well as age at onset, symptom 
duration, and exclusion of confounding psychiatric 
disorders and substance use. 

The label ADHD that we know and use today 

first appeared in 1987 with the DSM-III-R, and 
combined both inattention and hyperactivity 
domains into one diagnosis. Then, the DSM-
IV iteration divided the diagnosis into three 
subtypes: predominantly inattentive, predominantly 
hyperactive-impulsive, and combined type. The 
release of the DSM-V in 2013 saw the definition 
of ADHD broaden significantly. The changes are 
summarized in Table 1. One such change allowed 
for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD to 
coexist, which was not the case in previous iterations. 
Given the high comorbidity between ADHD 
and ASD, it is clear that this change, along with 
others (Table 1), contributed to the rise in ADHD 
prevalence, as it added a large group of children who 
were previously excluded.18

ADHD made its first appearance in the Diagnostic 

Clearly, the evolution of the diagnostic criteria 

and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or DSM) 
in 1968, as “Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood.” 
As the name implies, the emphasis was on overactivity 
and distractibility. In the years that followed, and with 
subsequent editions of the DSM, there was a clear 

accounts for some of the rise in ADHD. In fact, 
Polanczyk and his collaborators have done a lot 
of work on ADHD epidemiology—and they 
have consistently demonstrated that the observed 
variability in prevalence rates across various studies

Table 2. Example of questions clinicians can ask when assessing for ADHD. Adapted from  “Integrative Treatment 
for Adult ADHD: A Practical, Easy-to-use Guide for Clinicians” by Ari Tuckman (New Harbinger Publications, 2007). 
Broader questions can often elicit more information and will allow clinicians to explore more in depth than a 
memorizable check-list.

Could you describe how it feels when you have to sit through a long movie or meeting? 

(cid:43)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:83)(cid:73)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:3)(cid:52)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)

Tell me how you did with being attentive in class in middle school compared to other students? 

What is your experience when you try to read or focus on work for an extended period of time? 

Have you ever made a mistake on an exam or at work that could have easily been prevented? 

Do you often lose things like your keys or cell phone? If so, what do you do to keep track of them? 

How likely are you to remember to do a task without writing it down (make a phone call, water the plants, do 

the laundry etc..) 

What happens when you have a lot of tasks to do and need to get them all done? 

Tell me about your ability to focus on things you like and want to do as opposed to harder less exciting things. 

Do your friends and family ever ask you if you are paying attention to them? Do you feel you need to ask them 

to repeat something? Do you sometimes pretend you heard the conversation but actually didn't? 

Do you ever feel the urge to say whatever is on your mind right there and then, sometimes interrupt people? 

Does it ever get you in trouble with others? For example, losing friendships, or having difficulties with your boss? 

Do you drink coffee? If so, how much and how do you notice it affects you?

your diagnosis. A few things to consider include: Is the patient late? Have they missed any appointments before this one? Does the 
patient talk fast and is difficult to interrupt? Do they forget the question you asked and often ask you to repeat things? Are they 
constantly fidgeting or moving around? Do you see piles of papers in their bag, or on zoom, a mess behind them? 

(cid:3)

was attributed largely to differences in measurement 
of outcomes, namely the criteria  used to diagnose 
ADHD and the inclusion or exclusion of functional 
impairment.19-20

The changing criteria only makes clinical 

diagnosis more difficult. In the absence of biomarkers, 
diagnosis is made by signs and symptoms. Some 
helpful questions for screening by clinicians are 
suggested in Table 2. However, this leaves a lot 
up to the clinician, and may lead to under and 
over diagnosis. Due to the overlapping nature of 
psychiatric symptoms, ADHD is often missed, 
and patients end up with inaccurate psychiatric 
diagnoses and medication regimen. This latter point 
is important as we now know ADHD has high rates 
of psychiatric comorbidities, such as behavioral 
aberrances (52%), anxiety (33%), depression 
(17%), and autism (14%). While this may lead 
to overdiagnosis, more likely than not, ADHD 
can be misdiagnosed as a result, and subsequently 
inadequately treated.21 Screening tools have been 
developed and validated for detection of ADHD in 
adults such as WHO’s Adult ADHD Self Report 

470 | 119:5 | September/October 2022 | Missouri Medicine

Scales or ASRS and many clinicians will ask for 
reports from schools and loved ones as well.22 
Referring to neuropsychiatric testing is also an option, 
though it is expensive and not required to make the 
diagnosis.

ADHD: Increased Awareness, 
Increased Prevalence

Outside of simply diagnostic changes, studies 

have provided other explanations for the rise in 
ADHD, including increased awareness and familiarity 
of physicians and the public with the diagnosis, 
geographic location and cultural differences, as well as 
other public health related factors such as improved 
access to care.23 ADHD has even earned its own 
Awareness Month as of October of 2004. A quick 
search on Google Trend shows a steady increase in 
ADHD-related searches throughout the years, with 
popularity in March 2022 at the highest it has ever 
been (Figure 1).

ADHD has also become prominent in popular 
culture. Characters with problems in attention and 
hyperactivity can be found all over early literary works 

SCIENCE OF MEDICINE

Figure 1. Google search trends for the term “ADHD”, from 2004 to present

- physician Heinrich Hoffman wrote short stories 
in the mid-1800s featuring characters like “Fidgety 
Philip” and “Johnny Look-in-the-Air,” the names of 
which alone indicate hyperactivity and inattention 
as core features of the characters.24 Today, a number 
of movies and television characters have ADHD as 
part of their plotline and defining features - from 
Barney Stinson on “How I Met Your Mother,” to Phil 
Dunphy on “Modern Family,” and even Bart Simpson. 
Social media has also propelled ADHD into popular 
awareness, as it has taken over platforms like TikTok 
and Twitter. As of May 2022, the hashtag #adhd has 
11.4 billion views on TikTok. Many people credit 
these platforms with helping them realize they had the 
diagnosis and subsequently seeking treatment for it. 
However, as is always the case with the internet and 
social media, misinformation about ADHD is fairly 
prevalent. A recent study has found that more than 
half of ADHD content on TikTok was misleading, 
most of them posted by non-health care providers.25 
That same study however did show that content posted 
by health care providers was overwhelmingly more 
accurate and useful to consumers.25

ADHD and Undertreatment

While there is concern from rising ADHD 
diagnoses, a U.S. national survey reported in 2006 
that only 11% of adults with ADHD were being 
treated for it. This is critical as deficits in organization 
and time management can lead to major educational, 
professional, or financial problems, with higher drop-
out rates, higher unemployment rates, and lower 
income attainment in adults with ADHD.26 Deficits 
can also have major interpersonal implications, with 
higher rates of divorce documented in adults with 
ADHD, for example.27 People with untreated ADHD 

are also at elevated risk of substance use, car accidents, 
unintentional injuries, depression, anxiety, and 
suicide.28 In other words, underdiagnosis has significant 
implications, far beyond inability to focus.

Some have raised concerns over non-medical use of 
stimulants. Non-medical use is most studied in student 
populations, where medications can function as 
either a cognitive enhancer, or are used recreationally. 
However, while some studies reported non-prescribed 
use of stimulants in about 7% of college students, 
most of the misuse was in the setting of attentional 
difficulties impairing the student’s ability to succeed in 
class.29 This is a possible indication that said student 
has undiagnosed ADHD, and not a desire to use the 
medication to get ahead.  More importantly, a recent 
review has found that pharmacological treatment 
of ADHD was associated with a decreased risk of 
substance use, not the opposite.30

Disparities in ADHD Diagnosis 
in Minoritized Populations

Any discussion of ADHD diagnostic trends would 

be incomplete without a review of disparities among 
minoritized population. Increasing awareness of these 
disparities might be contributing to the increase in 
rates of diagnosis. Over the past 20 years, available 
literature showcases the presence of pervasive disparities 
in ADHD diagnosis related to both race and gender. 
For instance, between 2004-2006, Black students were 
more likely than their White counterparts to have 
ADHD symptoms (12% vs. 7% respectively), but were 
less likely to have received a diagnosis (9% vs. 14% 
respectively).31 During the following decade, rates of 
diagnosis among Black individuals grew at a rate 3 
times higher than among White individuals.32 Similar 

                                     Missouri Medicine | September/October 2022 | 119:5 | 471  

SCIENCE OF MEDICINE

trends have been seen among girls, who demonstrated a 
3 times higher increase in diagnosis rates than boys over 
the past two decades.32-33  In fact, with regard to gender, 
experts have attributed changes in DSM-IV diagnostic 
criteria to recent diagnostic trends. Following changes 
that placed increased focus on inattention, rather than 
hyperactivity, there was a correspondingly significant 
increase in ADHD diagnosis among females.34 
Specifically, between 1991 and 2008, diagnosis rates 
increased by a factor of 5.6 in girls compared to 
only 3.7 in boys.35 In other words, knowing girls and 
underrepresented groups are more likely to have missed 
diagnoses, and even present with different symptoms, 
patients and clinicians might be asking more questions 
as a result. The rise might be due to the fact that these 
groups are just simply finally diagnosed, rather than 
over-diagnosed.

Even still, the data suggests we still are missing 
groups and underdiagnosing ADHD for many. To 
date, recent findings indicate that ADHD continues 
to be less frequently diagnosed in youth who are 
Black Indigenous and Persons of Color (BIPOC) 
and female, compared to those who are White and 
male, even after controlling for potential confounders 
such as socioeconomic status and adverse childhood 
experiences.36-37 Girls continue to be diagnosed at older 
ages than boys and tend to endorse higher levels of 
perceived stress.38 Reasons for these disparities stem 
from a multitude of systems level factors, however 
racial and gender bias is likely to play a major role. 
For example, diagnosis of any mental illness, especially 
ADHD, depends on individual interpretations of 
behavior and the way that a clinician integrates 
multiple informant reports from parents, caregivers, 
and teachers. Studies have found that clinicians tend 
to be more responsive to White parents who solicit 
an ADHD diagnosis and treatment for their child 
compared to BIPOC parents.39 Further, BIPOC youth 
with ADHD are disproportionately more likely to be 
misdiagnosed with ODD or CD.40-41

ADHD manifests differently across gender, as there 

may be stronger social pressures for girls to sit quietly 
compared to boys. In fact, studies show that boys have 
historically been more likely to exhibit hyperactivity 
and disruptive behaviors, prompting earlier detection 
of the disorder, compared to those with inattentive 
symptoms, a group that most often includes girls.42 
Interestingly, other studies have indicated there to 
be no true difference in level of hyperactivity across 

472 | 119:5 | September/October 2022 | Missouri Medicine

gender, rather a bias among teachers leading to under-
recognition of hyperactive symptoms among girls.43 
While some are concerned about the overdiagnosis 
of ADHD, there are still many groups who are 
underdiagnosed and unaccounted for in the data. 
Ultimately, focusing on the idea of “overdiagnosis” 
among providers may be harmful, particularly for these 
populations, as this may present additional barriers to 
them receiving appropriate care.

Conclusion 

ADHD is not a new phenomenon, however 

its prevalence has increased significantly in the 
recent years. Given changing diagnostic criteria and 
increasing awareness of the disorder in marginalized 
populations, especially individuals of color and females, 
this finding is not surprising. The general public has 
become increasingly more aware of ADHD through 
the media and social media. People are more likely 
to bring up their concerns to a physician, which in 
turn might prompt more numbers of people to be 
diagnosed. While some may argue that the increase 
is concerning and due to intentional feigning of 
symptoms in order to gain access to stimulant 
medication or test accommodations, the evidence 
suggests these groups have a negligible impact on 
diagnostic trends. In fact, as medical providers, focus 
on the idea of “overdiagnosis” may instead be harmful, 
create additional barriers to care, and add to the 
stigma towards their requests for help. It is important, 
instead, to approach patients holistically, and with 
an understanding of both the risks of treatment 
and undertreatment in mind. For those who have 
been struggling with unrecognized ADHD, there 
are significant impacts to mental health, social life, 
and work life. Thoughtful diagnosis and subsequent 
treatment can make all the difference.
