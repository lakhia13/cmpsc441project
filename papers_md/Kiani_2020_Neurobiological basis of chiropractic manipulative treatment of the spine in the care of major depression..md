Abstract. Background and aim:  Major  depressive  disorder  is  associated  with  an  autonomic  nervous  system 
imbalance. All the symptoms of depression (high cortisol, high adrenalin, insomnia, agitation, anxiety) can 
probably be attributed to over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system. We performed this review in 
order to highlight the possible links between chiropractic intervention, its potential molecular effects and its 
possible outcomes on patients with depression. Methods: We performed a literature search for all the relevant 
manuscript regarding the effects of chiropractic and depression on the autonomic nervous system. Results: 
Chiropractic  care  and  spinal  manipulation  regulate  the  autonomic  nervous  system  at  peripheral  level  and 
its projections to the central nervous system. In particular, they may activate the parasympathetic system to 
counterbalance the activity of the sympathetic system. Vagal parasympathetic stimulation is also considered 
an effective therapy for major depression as it releases neurotrophins essential for anti-depressive therapies, 
including  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  and  nerve  growth  factor.  Conclusion:  Chiropractic  and  spinal 
manipulative therapies along with vagal nerve stimulation may therefore be regarded as treatment options for 
depression. (www.actabiomedica.it)

Introduction

Autonomic nervous system in depression

Major  depressive  disorder  (MDD)  is  the  fourth 
main  cause  of  disability  worldwide,  according  to  the 
World  Health  Organization  (1).  It  causes  severe 
mental  distress  and  dysregulation  of  the  autonomic 
nervous  system  and  the  neuroendocrine  system.  Au-
tonomic  functional  imbalance  associated  with  loss  of 
vagal or parasympathetic activation and over-reactivity 
of  the  sympathetic  system  are  regularly  observed  in 
MDD (2). These dysfunctions may contribute to co-
morbidities of MDD like early coronary artery disease 
and osteoporosis (1). The main symptoms of MDD in-
clude anxiety, continuous depressed mood, anhedonia, 
poor concentration, feelings of guilt, loss of appetite, 
insomnia and frequent suicidal thoughts (3).

The  autonomic  nervous  system  consists  of  two 
systems, sympathetic and parasympathetic, which usu-
ally have opposite effects on tissues, so that an increase 
in one system’s activity concurrently decreases the oth-
er  system’s  activity  in  a  very  precise  control  of  tissue 
function (4). 

The  sympathetic  nervous  system  predominantly 
enhances  the  activity  of  effector  organ  through  cat-
echolamines  like  dopamine,  adrenalin  and  noradren-
alin  release  at  neuroeffector  junctions,  whereas  the 
parasympathetic  nervous  system  is  concerned  with 
conservation  of  vegetative  energy  and  facilitation  of 
processes  like  digestion  and  rest,  lowering  the  heart 
rate and enhancing gut motility (5).

2

Most depressive symptoms such as high cortisol, 
anxiety,  insomnia,  high  adrenalin  and  agitation  can 
be  attributed  to  changes  in  the  sympathetic  system. 
Autonomic control along with interoceptive feedback 
predominantly  contribute  to  emotional  processing. 
The activity of sympathetic nerves increases under the 
influence of physical or emotional trauma. Failure to 
re-establish  homeostasis  over-exposes  the  subject  to 
chronic  stress  (6).  This  dysregulation  leads  to  intol-
erance  of  the  emotional  and  physiological  stressors 
linked to trauma, prompting dysfunctional behaviors, 
like depression (5).

In MDD, autonomic function is assessed by ana-
lyzing blood pressure regulation, gastric motility, pupil 
variations, skin conductance and heart rate variability 
(7). Recent research has shown an association of MDD 
with genetic and non-genetic factors like biochemical 
alterations, affective trauma, stress, viral infections and 
abnormal  brain  development  (8-10).  Early  research 
showed a reduction in parasympathetic function dur-
ing  MDD.  In  2007,  Rottenberg  critically  reviewed 
this evidence of parasympathetic dysregulation during 
depressive disorders in a cross-sectional meta-analysis 
that covered 13 studies (11). More recent studies re-
port an association of MDD with lowered heart rate 
variability. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nerv-
ous systems both affect heart rate and low frequency 
fluctuations in heart rate variability (12).

Other  autonomic  functions  such  as  pupil  varia-
tions are controlled by the sympathetic and parasym-
pathetic branches. Indeed, pupil light reflex is used to 
detect autonomic imbalance. Interestingly, changes in 
pupil fluctuations have been reported in persons suf-
fering from MDD (13).

Another study explored the functions of different 
branches of the autonomic nervous system for insights 
into the role of sympathetic and parasympathetic sys-
tem modulation in MDD. Untreated MDD patients 
and controls matched for age, gender and body mass 
index  were  evaluated  for  heart  rate  variability,  blood 
pressure  variability,  baroreflex  sensitivity,  skin  con-
ductance,  pupil  unrest  index,  respiration  and  pupil 
diameter.  The  results  showed  a  substantial  difference 
between  the  pupil  diameter,  pupil  unrest  index,  skin 
conductance  and  its  fluctuations  between  untreated 
MDD patients and controls (7).

Latvala et al. performed a longitudinal study re-
cruiting more than 1 million men and established that 
blood pressure and heart rate may help predict MDD. 
In a follow-up study over 45 years, the risk of depres-
sive disorders increased by up to 6% in individuals with 
a resting heart rate of more than 82/min with respect 
to those having a heart rate of less than 62/min (14).

A fundamental neurotransmitter for MDD onset 
is serotonin. Serotonin regulates emotional and behav-
ioral  responses. The  serotonin  transporter  is  involved 
in transporting excess serotonin from the synaptic cleft 
to presynaptic neurons and in the regulation of sero-
tonin concentrations and activity, with significant an-
tidepressant effects. Significant alterations in serotonin 
transporter  availability  have  been  reported  in  MDD 
patients  (15).  The  correlation  between  serotonin  and 
autonomic  nervous  system  activity  is  demonstrated 
by  serotonin  precursor  levels  (tryptophan),  depletion 
of which may lower heart rate variability and enhance 
other depressive symptoms (16).

Numerous studies have revealed that plasma con-
centrations  of  norepinephrine  are  elevated  in  MDD 
patients.  Norepinephrine  is  a  neurotransmitter  and 
its  plasma  concentrations  usually  reflect  sympathetic 
nervous  system  activity.  Elevated  plasma  concentra-
tions  of  norepinephrine  among  depressed  patients 
suggest enhanced activity of the sympathetic nervous 
system  (17).  This  was  confirmed  in  a  study  on  a  co-
hort  of  17  depressed  patients  and  36  controls.  These 
observations were also supported by other studies that 
established  an  association  between  increased  plasma 
concentrations  of  norepinephrine  and  severe  depres-
sion  or  elevated  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  ac-
tivity,  suggesting  an  increase  in  sympathetic  nervous 
system  activity  (17).  Furthermore,  increased  norepi-
nephrine and epinephrine levels stimulate proinflam-
matory  cytokines.  The  resulting  neuroinflammation 
may cause neurotoxic changes in the brain of patients 
affected with depression (18).

Similarly, high sympathetic nervous system tone 
in  MDD  is  associated  with  a  high  risk  of  mortality 
from  cardiovascular  dysfunction.  In  fact,  the  activity 
level of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system is raised 
in MDD patients and may be considered as a key play-
er in the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
in MDD. Increased activity of the sympathetic nerv-

A.K. Kiani, P.E. Maltese, A. Dautaj, et al.ous system may also play a role in depression-related 
weight  loss,  because  the  sympathetic  nervous  system 
is an important constituent of neuroendocrine systems 
involved in the regulation of energy metabolism (19).

In 1984, Nemeroff and co-workers found elevated 
concentrations of corticotropin-releasing factor in cer-
ebrospinal fluid of MDD patients, leading to the sug-
gestion that elevated activity of this factor in the central 
nervous  system  could  explain  hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal hyperactivity in MDD (20), leading in turn to 
increased sympathetic nervous system activity (17).

All  this  evidence  supports  a  strong  relation  be-
tween  the  autonomic  nervous  system  and  depres-
sion.  Hence  autonomic  regulation  at  peripheral  level 
through manipulative adjustments and spinal massage 
may have a positive effect on patients suffering from 
MDD.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth 
factor as key modulators in depression

According to the neurotrophic hypothesis, there is 
a significant association between MDD with reduced 
neurotrophin expression and aberrant neurogenesis in 
different parts of the brain (3). Many clinical and pre-
clinical studies have proposed that several neurotroph-
ic  factors,  such  as  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor 
(BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), are involved 
in the pathogenesis of MDD. These neurotrophic pro-
teins contribute to the survival and plasticity of sero-
tonergic, dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the 
central nervous system (21).

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is an important 
neuronal growth factor that regulates neuronal matu-
ration,  neurogenesis,  synaptic  plasticity  and  survival. 
Reduced BDNF levels have been observed in the pre-
frontal  cortex  and  hippocampus  of  stressed  animals, 
suicidal subjects and depression patients. A recent re-
view established the role of BDNF in numerous neu-
rological  and  psychiatric  disorders.  Inadequate  levels 
of  BDNF  can  be  improved  by  treatment  with  anti-
depressants and physical therapy in depressed patients 
and animal models (22).

Nerve growth factor is another important neuro-
trophin  recognized  for  its  role  in  the  survival  of  cho-
linergic  and  sympathetic  neurons  in  the  basal  fore-

3

brain. Dysfunction of NGF may lead to depression in 
stressed and peripheral-nerve-damaged animal models 
(3).  Nerve  growth  factor  acts  as  a  modulator  of  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and contributes to 
maintaining the neuroendocrine and immune systems. 
Many studies have observed functional abnormalities of 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in MDD (23).
Lower  NGF  levels  were  observed  in  the  hip-
pocampus  of  suicidal  individuals  than  in  healthy 
controls.  In  line  with  this,  NGF  proved  to  have  an-
tidepressant properties, while acute and chronic stress 
reduced NGF expression in the mouse, shrew and rat 
hippocampus, an effect that is reversed by antidepres-
sant treatment. These observations suggest the possi-
bility of a new strategy for the prevention and treat-
ment  of  MDD  consisting  in  increasing  BDNF  and 
NGF levels in the corresponding brain regions (3).

Chiropractic manipulative therapy stimulates the 
release  of  various  neurotrophins,  and  some  of  them, 
like BDNF and NGF, are essential for the treatment 
of depression. Non-noxious mechanical stimulation of 
the skin leads to release of NGF in rats, thereby pro-
moting neuron survival and function. Thoracic spinal 
manipulative  therapy  stimulates  different  responses 
related to the sympathetic nervous system, the hypo-
thalamic-pituitary axis and the endocrine system. The 
theory of an association between spinal manual therapy 
and spinal cord neuroplasticity is being explored and 
several studies have shown such a connection. Chiro-
practic therapy works on the nervous system, stimulat-
ing it to release various chemicals and hormones that 
regulate  blood  pressure  and  flow,  calm  the  brain  and 
reduce inflammation (24).

Similarly,  vagal  nerve  stimulation  may  influence 
cell  differentiation  and  survival  through  BDNF  ex-
pression,  which  is  low  in  most  mood  disorders  like 
MDD, and antidepressant treatments increase its lev-
els.  The  efficacy  of  vagal  nerve  stimulation  might  be 
explained by the hypothesis of an link between mono-
amines  and  neuroplasticity  mechanisms.  As  the  hip-
pocampus has rich serotonergic and noradrenergic in-
nervation, changes in neurotransmitter concentrations 
may affect regional plasticity (25). A study by Revesz 
et al. showed that vagal nerve stimulation enhances cell 
proliferation  in  the  hippocampus  and  dentate  gyrus 
regions,  whereas  acute  medication  with  conventional

neurogenesis (26).

ments, and spinal manipulative therapy in relation to 
autonomic functions (31).

The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression states 
that  expression  of  neurotrophic  factors  (i.e.  BDNF 
and its receptor, TrkB) in brain circuits linked to mood 
regulation  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  effects  of 
stress  and  antidepressants,  whereas  the  neurogenesis 
hypothesis states that increase in expression of neuro-
trophins by antidepressant treatment may stop or even 
reverse  the  neuronal  loss  associated  with  depression 
(27).

Another study explored the effects of chronic va-
gal nerve stimulation on hippocampal neurogenesis in 
a bulbectomized mouse depression model, and showed 
that  vagal  nerve  stimulation  prevented  loss  of  differ-
entiated proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus while 
sham stimulation showed no such effect (28). Interest-
ingly,  chronic  treatment  (21  days)  with  conventional 
antidepressants  increased  the  expression  of  BDNF 
and TrkB mRNAs in the hippocampus. The same in-
crease in BDNF and TrkB mRNA expression in the 
hippocampus and cortex has also been observed after 
acute (3 hours) vagal nerve stimulation (27). However, 
it would be ill-conceived to draw conclusions on the 
basis  of  changes  in  BDNF  mRNA  or  protein  levels, 
while ignoring factors like release, proteolytic cleavage 
and translation (29).

Furthermore, vagal nerve stimulation may influ-
ence several brain regions, neurotransmitters and sig-
nal  transduction  mechanisms  affected  by  traditional 
antidepressant medications. Substantial improvements 
in MDD can be observed after 3-12 months of vagal 
nerve stimulation therapy (27,30).

Chiropractic therapy and autonomic nervous system

The  parasympathetic  nervous  system  regulates 
the  upper  cervical  region,  so  a  cervical  manipulation 
or  adjustment  results  in  a  parasympathetic  response 
(lowering  of  heart  beat,  reduction  of  blood  pressure, 
pupil constriction) (4), whereas manual adjustment of 
spinal  regions  with  significant  sympathetic  innerva-
tion, i.e. the upper thoracic and lumbar regions, pro-
duces a sympathetic response (heart beat stimulation, 
blood pressure increase, pupil dilation). Many studies 
have explored chiropractic cranial and vertebral adjust-

Interestingly,  depression  seems  to  be  correlated 
with  pain  probably  because  of  their  common  neu-
rological  pathways.  In  fact,  50-65%  of  patients  with 
chronic  pain  are  also  diagnosed  with  depression.  For 
instance, autonomic dysfunction is linked to tension-
type headache (TTH) and depression. Spinal adjust-
ments for TTH stimulate a parasympathetic response 
and  improve  TTH  and  associated  mental  disorders 
like  depression  (18,32).  One  study  recruited  TTH 
patients and tested the benefits of manual adjustment 
on depression and anxiety. The results confirmed that 
vertebral  manipulative  techniques  were  very  effective 
in improving TTH and depression (33). An interest-
ing case report of a 44 year-old teacher showed long-
lasting relief from TTH and MDD after chiropractic 
manipulative therapy. These effects are a first clue link-
ing  chiropractic  therapy  for  pain  with  treatment  for 
MDD (18).

Parasympathetic vagal nerve stimulation in major 
depression

The  vagal  nerve  is  located  in  the  cervical  region 
between the jugular vein and the carotid artery. About 
85% of the cervical vagal nerve consists of unmyelinat-
ed, slow-conducting, afferent C fibers with projections 
to the brain. Stimulation of the vagal nerve is consid-
ered a treatment option for severe depressive disorders. 
It  is  performed  with  bipolar  electrodes  on  the  vagus 
nerve in the left cervical region. Since 2005, more than 
3000 preclinical and clinical research studies exploring 
the effects of vagal nerve stimulation in depression and 
epilepsy have been published (25).

The first studies by Bohning and colleagues into 
the effects of vagal nerve stimulation on the brain of 
treatment-resistant  depression  patients  revealed  that 
acute  stimulation  activates  brain  regions  affected  by 
MDD, like the amygdala, parieto-occipital cortex, bi-
lateral  orbitofrontal  cortex,  left  temporal  cortex  and 
hypothalamus (34). Further studies revealed significant 
blood flow changes in many brain regions involved in 
MDD, like the anterior insular cortex, inferior frontal 
gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior 
and frontal orbital cortices, after vagal nerve stimula-

A.K. Kiani, P.E. Maltese, A. Dautaj, et al.tion.  Later  studies  showed  that  subacute  vagal  nerve 
stimulation  decreases  regional  cerebral  blood  flow  in 
subcortical and cortical regions like the amygdala and 
increases regional cerebral blood flow in the left infe-
rior frontal gyrus (35).

A study by Nahas and colleagues linked brain im-
aging studies and found that acute vagal nerve stimu-
lation  initially  activates  the  right  medial  prefrontal 
gyrus but after 30 weeks of stimulation this activation 
switches  to  deactivation  of  the  right  medial  prefron-
tal gyrus, coinciding with improvement in depressive 
symptoms.  A  similar  activation-deactivation  switch-
ing  pattern  was  found  in  the  right  anterior  insular 
cortex.  The  authors  therefore  established  a  correla-
tion between attenuated depression and activation of 
the right anterior insular cortex. They also observed a 
significant correlation between early activation of the 
right anterior insular cortex and severity of depression 
(36,37).

Likewise,  Conway  and  colleagues  conducted 
brain  imaging  studies  in  patients  with  treatment-re-
sistant depression undergoing vagal nerve stimulation. 
After 3-12 months of stimulation, the images showed 
a response in 9 out of 13 patients, while and 5 out of 
13 patients no longer show clinical signs of depression 
(38).

Animal  studies  have  demonstrated  that  vagal 
nerve  stimulation  increases  serotonergic  and  noradr-
energic neurotransmission in brain areas that are criti-
cal for mood regulation, like the amygdala, hippocam-
pus  and  prefrontal  cortex  (39).  Chronic  vagal  nerve 
stimulation has also been demonstrated to be involved 
in  neuronal  birth,  neuroplasticity,  migration,  survival 
and synaptogenesis. Both long- and short-term vagal 
nerve stimulation increases the length of dendrites and 
hippocampal neuronal complexity (25,40).

Finally,  there  have  also  been  long-term  studies 
into  the  effects  of  vagal  nerve  stimulation  on  major 
depression. Fifty-nine patients followed up for 2 years 
showed  an  increase  in  response  rate  from  31%  at  3 
months to 44% at 24 months. The remission rate was 
about 25% after 2 years. Most patients who responded 
well  after  3  months  maintained  their  good  response 
after  2  years  (37,41).  In  a  subsequent  larger  cohort 
study with 205 patients, 76.7% maintained their good 
response  from  3  to  24  months.  Interestingly,  65%  of 

5

those who did not respond at 12 months began to re-
spond  well  to  vagal  nerve  stimulation  at  24  months 
(42). In another study, 91 out of 160 patients received 
transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation for 3 months; 
69 of them first received 1 month of sham stimulation, 
then 2 months of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimula-
tion. After 1 month, patients receiving transcutaneous 
vagal nerve stimulation showed a significant reduction 
in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores as com-
pared to the patients that received sham stimulation. 
By  the  end  of  the  first  month,  27%  patients  receiv-
ing transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation were found 
to be good responders. This improvement in response 
continued for a further 2 to 3 months (43).

In conclusion, vagal nerve stimulation acts on the 
same  brain  regions,  signal  transduction  mechanisms 
and neurotransmitters as conventional antidepressants, 
and has similar effects, which however take longer to 
manifest.

Conclusion

Major depression may depend largely on imbal-
ances in autonomic nervous system activity. All symp-
toms of depression, such as high cortisol, high adrena-
lin, insomnia, agitation and anxiety, can be attributed 
to  excessive  activity  of  the  sympathetic  system.  Fur-
thermore,  neuroendocrine  factors 
like  dopamine, 
BDNF and NGF have roles in the pathophysiology of 
MDD. Although not yet definitely confirmed, chiro-
practic therapy and vagal nerve stimulation may pos-
sibly regulate the autonomic nervous system through 
activation  of  the  parasympathetic  nervous  system, 
reduction of sympathetic nervous system activity, and 
synthesis of neuroendocrine factors. In this review we 
show evidence that MDD may be a symptom of auto-
nomic imbalance and that chiropractic manipulation, 
spinal manipulative therapy and vagal nerve stimula-
tion,  which  elicit  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic 
responses, may improve autonomic imbalance and the 
symptoms of MDD.
