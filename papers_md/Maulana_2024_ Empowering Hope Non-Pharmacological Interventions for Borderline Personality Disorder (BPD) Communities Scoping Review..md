Aim:  Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  is  defined  by  impulsive  behaviour  and  instability  in  interpersonal  relationships,  self- 
image, mood, and emotions. BPD can be prevented and treated using a mix of medication and psychotherapy. Non-pharmacological 
interventions are essential for maintaining stable interpersonal interactions in individuals with BPD.
Goal:  The  literature  review  tries  to  identify  different  methods  of  non-pharmacological  management.  Psychotherapy,  particularly 
tailored to aid in the recovery from emotional disorders in individuals with BPD. The methodology employed is a scoping review that 
integrates papers from Semantic Scholars, Pubmed, and CINAHL databases. The keyword utilised is PICO.
Outcomes:  Four  pieces  of  literature  aligned  with  the  research  goals  based  on  the  literature  review  results.  Three  articles  discuss 
therapies that focus on cognitive processes, such as mindfulness therapy, schema therapy, Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT), and 
therapy groups that incorporate supplementing with Omega-3.
Conclusion: Non-pharmacological therapies for patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) can enhance good psychosocial 
outcomes, dialectical effects, and decrease emotional instability.
Keywords: borderline personality disorder, intervention, psychosis

Introduction
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterised by signs of impulsivity and instability in interpersonal relation-
ships, self-image and mood and emotional affect. BPD typically presents in early adolescents, but can be diagnosed in 
early adulthood, and manifests in a variety of life situations.1,2

Impulsivity and emotional Impulsivity and emotional dysregulation in people with BPD often lead to vulnerability to 

rule-breaking behaviours such as self-harm.3

People  with  BPD  tend  to  have  doubts  about  their  personal  identity,  such  as  life  values,  goals  and  even  sexual 
orientation,  if  there  is  a  recurrence  of  BPD  in  times  of  stress.  If  there  is  a  relapse  of  BPD  during  a  stressful  period, 
psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions may occur.3 The prevalence of BPD is not known for certain, but 
it is estimated to occur in 2% of the general population, about 10% as an outpatient, and 20% as an inpatient.

Approximately 10% of BPD patients are seen as outpatients, and 20% are known to be treated by psychiatrist.4
According to Raharja et al,5  both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are essential for enhancing individual healing 
with  borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD).  Target  therapy  from  pharmacotherapy  aims  to  achieve  physiologically 
perfect  condition  of  the  patient,  especially  the  working  part  of  the  brain.  Meanwhile,  BPD’s  strategy  is  to  overcome 
interpersonal connection difficulties through psychotherapy.5  BPD  is also  a multimodal therapy, namely therapy which 
refers to therapy communication, and is a non-pharmacological intervention which really needs to be done.

According to Soler et al,6  an effective BPD intervention combines Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) methodol-
ogies,  positive  psychology,  context-based  skills,  group-based  approaches,  and  participant  feedback.  Another  tendency 
focuses  on  psychological  techniques,  such  as  mentalization-based  therapy  (MBT),  which  aims  to  improve  emotional 
understanding and interpersonal interactions. A meta-analysis found that, while individual studies of these therapies differ, 
techniques such as DBT and MBT have showed promise in treating BPD symptoms.7 Additionally, research is expanding 
into  mindfulness  and  compassion-based  therapies,  suggesting  that  these  interventions  help  in  addressing  emotional 
dysregulation, a core issue in BPD.3  From the information above, BPD intervention combines BT, positive psychology, 
and  participant  feedback.  Consequently,  nurses  as  one  competent  health  personnel  non-pharmacological  approaches, 
necessary Find out what therapies can be done for handling clients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

Methods
The scoping review analysis method was utilized in this investigation. A scoping review is a form of literature review used to 
systematically map a certain topic. The main objectives of conducting a study using the scoping review method are to examine 
the scope and nature of research activities, assess the importance of conducting full systematic observations, summarize and 
share research findings, and identify any research deviations in existing literature. When researching nursing interventions/ 
non-pharmacological interventions for patients with borderline personality disorders, the researcher utilized databases such as 
EBSCO,  PubMed,  and  Semantic.  The  search  terms  included  borderline  personality  disorder  OR  BPD  OR  borderline 
personality AND nursing nonpharmacological OR intervention AND treatment OR therapy OR intervention OR best practice.

Criteria for Eligibility
Full papers  in English  and  Indonesian,  free  full-text  publications,  research  articles specifically  Randomized Controlled 
Trials (RCT), published within the last 5 years (2017–2022).

Data Selection Process
Researchers  utilized  a  prism  diagram  to  choose  papers.  Selecting  articles  using  Prisma  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  Article 
selection results are decided by keywords, inclusion criteria, and the title abstract of the articles.

Extracting and Analysing Data
Author,  year  of  publication,  location  study,  title,  population,  objectives,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  intervention, 
results/significance, and limits research based on the collected publications are all included in the manual data extraction 
and analysis procedure in Table 1. The acquired data is predicated on standards. The entire English/Indonesian article is 
the specified inclusion. The study is a controlled trial that is randomised, with a maximum of five years (2017–2022) and 
focuses on the group-focused literature about borderline personality disorder (BPD).

Results
Various  interventions  can  be  implemented  for  groups  of  individuals  with  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD).  The 
literature  review  discusses  four  articles  that  are  up  part  of  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  interventions.  One  article 
examines omega-3, another one focuses on Schema Therapy (ST), a third article covers Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 
(CBT),  and  a  fourth  item  delves  into  dialectically  connected  therapy.  All  publications  were  analysed  using  the 
Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) approach, and their feasibility was evaluated using JBI.

Discussions
Cognitive Therapy
Schema Therapy (ST)
Schema therapy (ST) is a structured therapeutic approach provided by trained therapists following a specific protocol. In the 
case of the dominant group schema therapy (PGST), patients attend 2 group sessions per week in the first year, with up to 
12 individual sessions available upon request. During the second year, a Schema Therapy (ST) group was conducted weekly

from the 13th to the 18th month, bi-weekly from the 19th to the 21st month, and monthly from the 22nd to the 24th month. 
Additionally, up to 5 individual Schema Therapy (ST) sessions could be requested.

The results indicate that IGST is more efficacious and has greater treatment retention compared to TAU and PGST. 
The results suggest that IGST is the most favourable format for ST, leading to sustained improvements in BPD severity 
post-treatment.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
Cognitive  Behavioural  Therapy  (CBT)  is  an  individualised  therapy  consisting  of  three  initial  sessions  focusing  on 
breathing  training  for  anxiety,  safety  planning,  and  psychoeducation  about  trauma  and  PTSD.  This  is  followed  by 
9–13 sessions of cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying and correcting erroneous thoughts or beliefs.

Contribute to that feeling of discomfort. Cognitive restructuring is used to address thoughts and beliefs that stem from 
ordinary life and trauma.10  The results indicate that in Study 1, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) led to a significant 
improvement in PTSD symptoms, depression, and self-reported physical health. In Study 2, participants in CBT experienced a 
significant  increase  in  PTSD  symptoms,  post-traumatic  cognition,  and  depression,  with  those  in  CBT showing  a  greater 
improvement in PTSD symptoms. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is viable and acceptable 
for  those  with  Severe  Mental  Illness,  Borderline  Personality  Disorder,  and  PTSD,  and  is  linked  to  a  reduction  in  PTSD 
symptoms. This aligns with the study. DBT, or dialectical behavioral therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is  a 
mindfulness approach backed by general care standards that cover awareness, emotional control, discomfort tolerance, and

concentrated marine fish oil, with a daily 
dose of 4 capsules. Compliance with 
treatment The study was monitored by 
pill counts and self-report, as well as by 
acid quantification fat gas 
chromatography in erythrocytes. while 
the research was taking place, medicines 
antipsychotics or mood stabilizers are 
not permitted for consumption. 
However, all patients were offered 7 
sessions of needs-based psychological and 
psychosocial intervention, along with 
research follow-up interviews at baseline, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

Predominantly group scheme therapy 
(PGST), 2 group sessions per week 
provided in year 1, with a maximum of 12 
individual sessions available upon request 
patient. In year 2, the Schema Therapy 
(ST) group is given once per week in 
months 13 to 18, once per 2 weeks in 
months 19 to 21, and once a month in 
months 22 up to 24, with a maximum of 5 
individual Schema Therapy (ST) sessions 
available upon request. 
For Individual Group Schema Therapy 
(IGST) 2 sessions (1 individual and 1 
group) per week sent in year 1. In the 
first 6 months of year 2 (month 13 to 18), 
the frequency of both individual and 
group ST was biweekly. On months 19 to 
21, the ST group was given once every 
two weeks. and individual ST is given 
monthly. In months 22 to 24, both are 
offered monthly. The ST group was 
closed and provided by 2 therapists. For 
IGST, mostly patients have individual 
therapists besides themselves group 
therapist. All ST therapists have a mental 
health license health professionals trained 
in individual ST for BPD. Treatment as 
Usual (TAU) is the optimal psychological 
treatment available on site. 
The most frequently offered is dialectical 
behavioral therapy, with an intensity that 
corresponds to Schema Therapy (ST)

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in 
Individuals with Severe Mental Illness and 
Borderline Personality Disorder 
M. Alexandra Kredlowa, Kristin L. 
Szuhanya, Stephen Loa, Haiyi Xieb, 
Jennifer D. Gottliebc, Stanley D. 
Rosenbergb, and Kim T. Mueserc 
Year: 201710

A total of 108 people participated in 
Study 1, where the current analysis 
examined 27 individuals who met criteria 
for BPD, 15 were randomized to CBT and 
12 to TAU. 
A total of 201 individuals participated in 
Study 2, in which the current analysis 
examined 55 individuals with BPD, of 
whom 29 were randomized to CBT and 
26 to the Brief intervention

To determine feasibility, tolerability and 
effectiveness behavioral therapy (CBT) 
program for post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) in individuals with 
severe mental illness (SMI) for 
individuals with borderline personality 
disorder (BPD).

Study 1: 
CBT improved significantly more in PTSD 
symptoms, depression, and self-reported 
physical health 
Study 2: 
participants in CBT and Brief improved 
significantly in PTSD symptoms, 
posttraumatic cognition, depression, and 
overall functioning, with those in CBT 
gaining significantly more PTSD 
knowledge, and having slightly greater 
improvements in PTSD symptoms. CBT 
for PTSD is feasible and tolerable in 
individuals with SMI, BPD, and PTSD, and 
is associated with profound 
improvements PTSD symptoms and 
related outcomes

Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT): 
CBT is provided on an individual basis 
format and consists of three sessions that 
teach breathing training for anxiety, 
planning safety, and psychoeducation 
about trauma and PTSD, followed by 
9–13 sessions cognitive restructuring (ie, 
identifying and correcting erroneous 
thoughts or beliefs) contributing to 
disturbing feelings). Cognitive 
restructuring is applied to thoughts that 
arise from everyday life as well as 
thoughts and beliefs related to trauma. 
Programs include handouts, worksheets, 
and homework tailored to individual 
needs with severe mental illness 
Treatment as Usual (TAU): The client 
continues to receive usual services from 
community mental health. 
Intervention Brief: Respiratory retraining 
and psychoeducation about trauma and 
PTSD, and utilizing video to facilitate 
discussions about PTSD, but does not 
involve cognitive restructuring

interpersonal effectiveness. DBT intervention was conducted in Guillén’s research11 by having group discussions on several 
techniques,  such  as  psychoeducation,  validation,  acceptance,  problem  resolution,  and  management  contingencies.  The 
family’s  function  in  this  method  is  crucial  to  the  success  of  DBT.  In  order  to  measure  each  person’s  negative  emotional 
changes, the effectiveness of DBT was then evaluated in this study using the Level of Expressed Emotion Scale (LEE-S). 
Between before treatment and after maintenance, there was a drop as a result.

For instance, the LEE-S instrument’s components disturbance (intrusiveness) decreased on average by 2.94 SD. can

Therapy Involving Ingestion Supplement
Omega-3
Administering lipid supplements Omega 3 plays a role in modulating neurotransmitters in the system of depressed individuals, 
including malfunctioning neurotransmitters, as a non-pharmacological therapeutic. Amminger et al8 conducted research invol-
ving the administration of a 0.5-gram supplement in yellow gelatin capsules. This product includes potent marine fish oil with 700 
mg of EPA, 480 mg of DHA, and 7.6 mg of vitamin E. The recommended dosage is 4 capsules daily. Coconut oil was selected as a 
placebo due to its lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and its little effect on n-3 PUFA metabolism. The capsule placebos 
were meticulously designed to closely resemble the active medication in both appearance and taste. They also contain significant 
levels of vitamin E, equivalent to n-3 capsules, and 1% fish oil to replicate the taste. Compliance with study therapy is assessed 
using pill counts, self-reports, and acid quantification. Analyze fats in red blood cells using gas chromatography.

Participants  are  prohibited  from  taking  antipsychotics  or  mood  stabilizers  during  the  research.  The  trial  results 
indicated  a  notable  rise  in  scores  in  the  n-3  PUFA  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  Omega-3  polyunsaturated 
fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have been shown to be useful in treating depressive disorders both 
on  their  own  and  in  combination  with  other  therapies.  Another  study  by  Chang  et  al12  supports  the  effectiveness  of 
omega-3s in alleviating symptoms of major depression in individuals with severe major depressive disorder.

Conclusion
Non-pharmacological  therapies  for  patients  with  Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD)  are  beneficial  in  providing 
emotional stability related to psychotic symptoms like depression. The non-pharmacological interventions outlined in this 
research  primarily  focus  on  cognitive  therapy,  which  can  be  administered  by  healthcare  professionals.  Based  on  the 
research results, several non-pharmacological interventions are effective for treating patients with borderline personality 
disorder,  such  as  cognitive  therapy,  schema  therapy  (ST),  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT),  and  therapy  involving 
ingestion  supplemental  intake  (Omega  3).  Implementing  these  therapies  can  help  patients  improve  their  emotional 
regulation abilities and overcome harmful behaviours.
