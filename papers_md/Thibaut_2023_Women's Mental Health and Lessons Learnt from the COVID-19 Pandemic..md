KEY POINTS

(cid:1) Most pregnant women have asymptomatic or midly symptomatic COVID-19 disease but
about 10% of them may present with severe disease. Preterm delivery, low birth weight
may be observed in COVID 1 women. All these uncertainties have increased the risk of
anxiety and/or depression or even PTSD in pregnant women. Prescription of contracep-
tion and medical abortions should be maintained during pandemics.

(cid:1) Even if men were at higher risk of death and severe COVID-19 disease, the risk of long

COVID is two times higher in women as compared to men.

(cid:1) Anxiety, depression, and PTSD are more prevalent in women (especially in health care
professionals), however, longitudinal studies will be necessary to conclude if there was
only a transient increase of psychological symptoms due to a particularly stressful situa-
tion or if this will last in the long term.

(cid:1) Females, young aged, and low- and middle-income countries have been the most

affected by COVID 19-related mental health fallouts and economic crisis.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis that rapidly impacted
every country around the globe in a matter of few weeks. Initially, the United Nations
(UN) Director General drew attention to certain populations who will be the most
impacted by the pandemic adversities namely, those living in poverty and in conflict
zones, the elderly, children, and importantly frontline health workforce. The former
UN Women Executive Director emphasized that women are at the highest risk as
they represent the majority of health workers, in addition to being already burdened

by their essential roles as parents and caregivers to other family members.1 Devel-
oping countries were hit the hardest with the pandemic and its related fallouts, which
extended to impact every sphere of lives. Importantly, the pandemic is not just a health
crisis; it also brings drastic social and economic costs. The pandemic and its adverse
impact continue to hit hard, and it is projected to drive up to 40 million people into
extreme poverty across sub-Saharan Africa, with African women and girls being hit
the hardest.2 Our article will review the specific impact of COVID-19 pandemic on
women and also the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on women in different
parts of the world capturing experiences from developed and developing countries.

THE SPECIFIC SITUATION OF PREGNANCY

The pandemic has been particularly distressing to pregnant women. Most pregnant
women with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. They
often present with fever and cough and less often with myalgia and chill. Ma and col-
leagues3 have conducted a metaanalysis in 19,884 individuals with confirmed COVID-
19. The pooled percentage of asymptomatic infections was 54.1% in pregnant women
as compared to 40.5% in the general population. Yet, Vouga and colleagues4 reported
9.9% of severe COVID-19 disease in a cohort of 926 pregnant women positive for
SARS-CoV-2. In these pregnant women, risk factors for severe COVID-19 were pul-
monary comorbidities, hypertension, and diabetes. Symptomatic COVID-19 pregnant
women were also more likely to experience hospitalization (RR 5.4), intensive care unit
admission (RR 1.5), intubation and mechanical ventilation (RR 1.7), and even death.5
Maternal death due to all causes was 11.3% in pregnant women as compared with
6.4% in non-pregnant hospitalized women.6

The adverse outcomes most often reported in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2
infection were preterm delivery and low birth weight.7 Other obstetric complications
include stillbirth, miscarriage, preeclampsia-like syndrome, fetal growth restriction,
coagulopathy, premature rupture of membranes and postpartum hemorrhage, all of
which remained rare.7,8 The severity of maternal disease was associated with a higher
risk of cesarean section, preterm delivery and requirement of neonatal intensive care
unit.

Maternal–fetal transmission was considered low during SARS-CoV-2 maternal
infection; rate of SARS-CoV2 positive test in neonates born to mothers with COVID-
19 was 8% in6; 2.9% in4 and 6% in9 respectively and two neonates died. Respiratory
symptoms were observed in these COVID-positive neonates. Vivanti and colleagues10
described a case of congenital COVID-19 infection associated with neurological
symptoms following neonatal viremia and transplacental transmission. Magnetic reso-
nance imaging showed bilateral lesions of the neonate brain white matter. The risk of
bipolar disorders or schizophrenia during adolescence remains unknown after expo-
sure to SARS-CoV2 during pregnancy.

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through breast milk remains unclear. The World
Health Organization (WHO) considers that the benefit of breastfeeding is higher than
the potential risk of maternal transmission whereas the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention recommends temporary separation of the newborn from a mother
with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.7

All these uncertainties may have contributed to increased levels of stress which may
in turn increase the risk of mental health problems in pregnant women and, of preg-
nancy terminations. Indeed, high levels of posttraumatic stress (43%), anxiety and
depression (31%), were reported in 6894 pregnant women from 64 countries,11 while
86% were somewhat or very worried about medical care and their future babies. A

pooled prevalence of 25% to 30% for depression and 34% to 42% for anxiety was
reported in pregnant women during the pandemic12 (prevalence two times higher in
pregnant vs nonpregnant women).13,14; Berthelot and colleagues15 have compared
1258 women recruited online during the pandemic with 496 pre–COVID-19 pregnant
women and reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (OR:1.94).
Previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income were risk factors for elevated distress
and psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.15,16 In contrast, several
studies have reported a lower prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or PTSD
in pregnant woman during the first lockdown compared to nonpregnant women or
prepandemic rates.17,18

It is also of upmost importance to note that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated
with major disruptions in access to essential health services including family planning,
mental health services, and perinatal health services.19 Furthermore, the notable
limited access to women-specific critical services may have resulted in riskier home
births and an increase in maternal mortality.20 In addition, it is reported that institu-
tional deliveries dropped below prepandemic levels in 6 out of 10 sub-Saharan African
countries.21

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries had limited access to sex-
ual and reproductive health services, and social stigma on sexuality was observed in
certain communities. During the pandemic, the United Nations Population Fund esti-
mated that 12 million women in 115 countries have lost access to birth control and 1.4
million unplanned pregnancies might have occurred during the pandemic. Moreover,
abortion was considered as non-essential in many countries during the lockdown pe-
riods.22 These social factors have increased the risk of psychiatric symptoms in
women.

Women at Increased Risk of Psychiatric Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

COVID-19 disease was associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of both
anxiety and depressive symptoms in the general population. Most studies have re-
ported a gender effect in the increased prevalence of psychological distress, anxiety,
and depressive symptoms or loneliness during the lockdowns but most studies were
conducted in Europe, China, and North America, were cross-sectional and based on
self reports23(female gender was a risk factor)24; (OR 1.48 for women and anxi-
ety).25–27; Finally, in a review of 2020 Western European and North American studies,
females were more affected than males for major depressive and anxiety disorders
respectively (29.8% vs 24% and 27.9% vs 21.7%).28 In contrast several studies did
not report any gender effect.29

In developing countries, mental ill-being has been, and continues to be a major fallout
of the pandemic. This comes as a result of the direct pandemic-related adversities,
which challenges human coping and adaptation, and heightens the sense of threat, un-
certainty, and negative expectations. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided
evidence that females, young aged and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
were the most affected by COVID 19-related mental health fallouts.30 A study of the
mental health impact of COVID-19 in 7 Arab countries reveals that COVID-19 traumatic
stress significantly contributes to increased mental distress. This effect correlates with
population density and economic status.31 Ethiopia’s Amhara reported high levels of
anxiety and depression with a three-fold increase compared to prepandemic levels.32
Similarly, there are heightened levels of depression and anxiety among women when
comparing pre to postpandemic studies in Pakistan.32,33

A significantly higher prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder was observed in

women (7%–53.8%).23

Suicide rate in Japan increased by 16% especially in females and younger individ-
uals after the first lockdown.34 Dube´ and colleagues35 have reported increased rates
for suicide ideation (10.8%), suicide attempts (4.7%), and self-harm (9.6%) during the
COVID-19 pandemic as compared to prepandemic studies. Women and ethnic minor-
ities were at higher risk of suicide ideation during the pandemic.

Women at Increased Risk of Addictive Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Historically, women have used tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs less often than men.
The gradual change of societal role of women over time and lessening of social taboos
have led to a gradual increase in the frequency and amount of psychoactive substance
use in women, particularly in Europe and North America.36 Even if 50% of adults did
not report any change in alcohol and/or tobacco consumption during the COVID-19
pandemic, women and past-year harmful alcohol users had a higher risk of change
in alcohol and/or tobacco use.37 In most studies, women reported more emotional
distress38–40 and a higher risk of drinking prevalence was observed in women in
some studies.38,39,41,42 In contrast several studies did not report any gender effect
or even higher risk in men.40,43,44 Currie45 reported a slight increase in illicit substance
use (13.4%) while Malandain and colleagues43 reported a decrease in 27.8% of cases
without any gender effect.

Malandain and colleagues43 reported an increase in internet use (gambling, cybersex
(4%–24%), creation of new social networks) in 14.4% of cases without any gender effect
as well as an increased risk of behavioral addictions. In contrast, Huang and colleagues46
have reported a higher increase in internet use in women as compared to men. Grubbs
and colleagues47 reported a trend downwards for problematic pornography use in
men without any change in women (already low users). Furthermore, women were 1.6
times more likely than men to lose control on diet and 2.3 times more likely to increase
smartphone use. No gender effect was reported for videogaming.48

Gender Inequalities

The pandemic has increased the inequality between men and women. The con-
straints, lockdowns, and other measures enforced in order to contain the spread of
the disease have drastically impacted all aspects of human lives and livelihoods, ed-
ucation, domestic life, economic wellbeing, traditional gender roles and overall health,
interlocking life spheres which are inevitably affecting mental wellbeing directly and
indirectly as discussed in Fig. 1.49 Women were more likely to take care of children
because of closed schools and adapt their job with reduced working hours and lower

income. They have more often insecure jobs and jobs with lower social security
coverage. They were also more affected by lockdown-related closures, reduced
work and job losses in the hotels, restaurants, services, and retail. According to the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,50 women accounted for 55% of the 20.5 million
jobs lost and at a faster rate than men in April 2020. Notably, the limited access to
health services and increased partner violence were also contributing factors.51,52

It is noteworthy that 85% of women in Africa (58% of self-employed population in
Africa) are employed informally with no employment security or benefits, which makes
women the most vulnerable sector to be laid off by employers.53 Lessons learnt from
previous epidemics, such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 showed that
women suffered more income losses as a result of such crisis. The direct effect of
the crisis, in addition to the preventive measures (which included travel restrictions),
severely impacted women’s livelihoods and economic security. In Yemen 1:5 people
live in conflict zones and express high need for mental health and psychosocial sup-
port.54,55 On the other hand, in South Sudan, it was estimated that around 5 million
people were affected by the ongoing prepandemic humanitarian emergency in the
country representing one of the largest mental health gaps in the world, which got
even worse with the COVID outbreak.56 The UN urged for mental health care to be
incorporated into all Governments’ COVID- 19 national response.

COVID-19 Disease and Gender Differences

Interestingly, a study based on health records from US hospitals reported that a recent
diagnosis of mental disorder increased the risk for COVID-19 infection. The strongest
effects were observed for depression (OR 7.6) and schizophrenia (OR 7.34), especially
in women and African-Americans.57

In Western Europe and North America, men represented a slight majority of corona-
virus deaths (52%–58%). The largest proportion of deaths (male-to-female ratio) in
confirmed cases was observed in Taiwan, Denmark, Thailand, Tunisia, and Albania
(ratio>2).58 For every 10 female intensive care admissions (ICU) there were 17 male
ICU admissions and 15 male confirmed deaths. The highest death ratio observed in
men could be partly explained by pre-existing cardio-vascular or metabolic diseases,
a higher prevalence of alcohol abuse, or tobacco smoking. Women are also more
likely to follow hand hygiene practices, which may decrease infection risk.59 Finally,
sex chromosomes, sex hormones may contribute to the differences in the immune re-
sponses observed between males and females.60

Long COVID occurred in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-
CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 (symptoms may appear
following initial recovery from an acute infection or persist from the initial infection). Symp-
toms last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by another diagnosis. The most
common symptoms are fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction. Being a
female is a risk factor for long COVID. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with COVID-
19 experience persistent symptoms following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.61 Long
COVID was more frequently observed in women (10.6%) as compared to men
(5.4%).62 An estimated 15.1% continued to experience symptoms at 12 months. Huang
and colleagues63 reported that 3/4 of patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive had at least one
symptom at 6 months of follow-up, the percentage was higher in women (fatigue, muscle
weakness, and sleep difficulties, OR 1.33; anxiety and/or depression, OR 1.80).

Health Care Professionals

Worldwide, more than 70% of front-line health workers and essential service staff are
women (including nurses, midwives, social workers, employees in pharmacies,

6

Thibaut & ELNahas

cleaning, canteens, child or elderly care, grocery retail, laundry, and so forth). Women
were, therefore, more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, sustained distress, and
higher workload levels as compared to the general population.64,65 In Italy and Spain,
66% and 72% of health workers SARS-CoV-2 positive were women vs. 34% and 28%
men respectively.32 Many women required smaller-sized N95 masks than those made
available to them, which was a matter of safety and put them at higher risk of SARS
CoV-2 infection.66 Shortages of personal protective equipment was also observed
in many sectors and increased the infectious risk in women.

Health care professionals were at higher risk of psychological distress compared to
the general population. Higher risk of insomnia, PTSD, depression, anxiety and burn
out were observed during and after the pandemic peak64,67; especially in female front-
line workers (47.1% for insomnia, 33% for depression, and 16.3% for PTSD respec-
tively).68 Risk factors were lack of rest (for insomnia), death of friends or relatives
(for depression) and personal COVID-19 status (for PTSD). In a survey conducted in
Pakistan among healthcare workers, more than 35% and around 50% showed sub-
stantial symptoms of depression and anxiety respectively, notably young women.69
The societal norms and structures stating that women assume caregiving roles are
increased during pandemics.70 This resulted in a high workload level in female health
care professionals. Health care professionals had also encountered higher social
isolation and discrimination.71 In addition there were insufficient specialized services
to detect and manage anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and to give advice to
health workers without stigmatization. Yet, longitudinal studies will be necessary to
conclude if there was only a transient increase of psychological symptoms due to a
particularly stressful situation or if this will last in the long term.

Increased Violence Against Women

An increase of 25% to 30% in intimate partner violence was observed during the
COVID-19 pandemic.72,73 Like many parts of the world, the Arab States and Sub
Saharian Africa witnessed a staggering surge of domestic violence in different parts
of both regions including Tunisia, South Africa, Jordan, Egypt, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria
and many more as compared to pre-pandemic figures. Kenya, Yemen, Morocco,
Egypt, and Tunisia have reported an increase in domestic violence (Fig. 2).74

All male psychiatric diagnoses were associated with an increased risk of domestic
violence against women (alcohol and mostly substance use disorders were associ-
ated with the highest risk).75,76

Likewise, increased verbal and physical aggression was reported toward caregivers in
China, Italy, France, and Singapore.77 Violence during pandemics is even more complex
including prevent women from accessing health or social services, inability for women to
escape or call social services, increased risk of being put on the streets without shelters.78

According to estimates by the UNFPA,22 the COVID-19 pandemic may result in two

million cases of female genital mutilation.

Gendered adversities extended to become a witnessed gender-based violence with
reported incidences of online violence faced by many women when they used smart-
phones, the Internet, social media platforms, and emails. This type of gendered
violence took several forms as for instance: cyberbullying, sexual harassment, zoom
bombing, social media harassment, threats, and so forth. The negative consequences
of this escalating form of gendered violence are expected to impact women and girls
negatively in several ways limiting their access to online services, use of helplines and
other information systems, hindering their education and employment opportunities,
and minimizing women’s participation as active digital citizens.79 Sixty percent of
women across nine Arab states reported experiencing online violence during the
pandemic. Moreover, two-thirds of 100 East African women journalists reported that
online harassment had increased during the pandemic.53 Importantly, health services
provided to survivors of gender-based violence continued to be disrupted, with health
facilities repurposed into quarantine centers.

Impact on Education

Over a 100 million girls in developing countries struggle to access proper education. In
the wake of COVID-19, the closure of thousands of schools was part of confinement
measures taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus, there are deep concerns that
this will exacerbate gender gaps in education and lead to increased risk of sexual
exploitation, early and unintended pregnancy, child abuse, child labor, and forced
early marriage in some societies. In Kenya, the dropout of girls has tripled (3.2% to
9.4%).21 This will result in a rollback on previous preemptive measures taken during
the previous years to narrow the gender disparity in education.

SUMMARY

It is quite obvious that women and girls are facing multiple challenges as a result of the
pandemic, a situation which requires a multipronged response. In order to achieve
this, women’s participation and leadership in pandemic response planning is critical.
Unfortunately, data compiled by53 monitoring women’s representation and leadership
in COVID-19 taskforces, showed that women are significantly underrepresented or
notably excluded from the assemblies assigned to this purpose, even at the national
levels. The adversity of the COVID-19 pandemic is not a thing of the past, it continues
to teach us lessons as we witness the red flags of long-haul COVID; with a long list of
somatic, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. The pandemic remains a
public health emergency of international concern and it is yet too early to cease efforts
on combating it as declared by the COVID-19 Emergency Committee of the WHO. Tel-
ehealth services, insurance coverage should be increased. Prescription of contracep-
tion and medical abortions should be maintained during pandemics. The development
of novel vaccines and therapies must include pregnant and breastfeeding women.
Emergency aid should be gender-based as proposed by the World Health Organiza-
tion to take into account existing economic gender disparities.19 Countries national
preparedness and response to this pandemic is now stemming from an enhanced un-
derstanding of the impact of a global crisis on mental health, and how this impact is
gender-specific. We need to turn our lens to mental health. It is quite obvious that
women mental health care service stands out as an essential component of the na-
tional preparedness and response to disease outbreaks. Mental wellbeing and effec-
tive coping with crisis now being recognized as an integral part of the immediate,

8

Thibaut & ELNahas

short-term and long-term of national public health strategy, which yet need to be
gender-responsive.

We learnt a lesson: Women Mental Health matters-this is what we learnt. Putting
women first in mental health support should be part of the holistic approach aiming
to curb the post-pandemic adversities. As front-liners and key mobilizers in the com-
munity, fostering women mental well-being is a way to empower them to pursue their
roles and improve their lives.
