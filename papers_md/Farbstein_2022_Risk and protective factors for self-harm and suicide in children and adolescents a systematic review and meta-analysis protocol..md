ABSTRACT
Introduction  Self- harm and suicide are major public 
health concerns among children and adolescents. Many 
risk and protective factors for suicide and self- harm have 
been identified and reported in the literature. However, 
the capacity of these identified risk and protective factors 
to guide assessment and management is limited due to 
their great number. This protocol describes an ongoing 
systematic review and meta- analysis which aims to 
examine longitudinal studies of risk factors for self- harm 
and suicide in children and adolescents, to provide a 
comparison of the strengths of association of the various 
risk factors for self- harm and suicide and to shed light on 
those that require further investigation.
Methods and analysis  We perform a systematic search 
of the literature using the databases EMBASE, PsycINFO, 
Medline, CINAHL and HMIC from inception up to 28 
October 2020, and the search will be updated before the 
systematic review publication. Additionally, we will contact 
experts in the field, including principal investigators whose 
peer- reviewed publications are included in our systematic 
review as well as investigators from our extensive 
research network, and we will search the reference lists 
of relevant reviews to retrieve any articles that were 
not identified in our search. We will extract relevant 
data and present a narrative synthesis and combine the 
results in meta- analyses where there are sufficient data. 
We will assess the risk of bias for each study using the 
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and present a summary of the 
quantity and the quality of the evidence for each risk or 
protective factor.
Ethics and dissemination  Ethical approval will not be 
sought as this is a systematic review of the literature. 
Results will be published in mental health journals and 
presented at conferences focused on suicide prevention.
PROSPERO registration number  CRD42021228212.

INTRODUCTION
Suicide  and  self- harm,  defined  as  any  act 
of  self- poisoning  or  self- injury,  regardless 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This systematic review will examine data about risk 
and  protective  factors  for  suicide  and  self- harm 
in  children  and  adolescents  only  from  longitudinal 
studies, thus avoiding issues of temporality that ex-
ist in cross- sectional studies.

 ⇒ We will perform a thorough and systematic search 
including several databases from health and mental 
health  fields,  searching  reference  lists  of  previous 
systematic  reviews  and  contacting  key  authors  in 
the field.

 ⇒ Using the broad definition of self- harm (as opposed 
to differentiating between suicide attempt and non- 
suicidal  self- injury)  may  create  challenges  in  syn-
thesising the data as its definition in each study may 
be different, but on the other hand will prevent us 
from missing important evidence on the subject.
 ⇒ Examination of all identified risk and protective fac-
tors  for  self- harm  and  suicide  in  children  and  ad-
olescents simultaneously in one systematic review 
will  allow  comparison  of  the  importance  of  each 
factor.

 ⇒ This  systematic  review  will  only  include  studies 
published  in  the  English  language  and  therefore 
may  overlook  risk  and  protective  factors  that  are 
unique to individual countries or parts of the world.

of  the  motivation1  among  adolescents  and 
young  people,  are  of  major  public  health 
concern.  Acts  of  self- harm  are  known  to 
be  highly  prevalent  in  adolescents.  Inter-
national  community- based  studies  estimate 
that approximately 10%–30% of adolescents 
self- harm,2  3  and  1%–10%  report  to  have 
made a suicide attempt at least once in their 
life.4–7  These  numbers  are  even  higher  in 
specific  at- risk  populations,  such  as  those 
with  psychiatric  disorders,  most  notably

depression and anxiety.6 Most worryingly, self- harm and 
suicide  attempts  are  some  of  the  strongest  predictive 
factors  for  completed,  or  death  by,  suicide,8  9  which  is 
now ranked as the second most common cause of death 
among  those  aged  10–24  years  old,  surpassed  only  by 
accidents.10

Due to their great importance, many efforts have been 
undertaken  to  prevent  self- harm  and  suicide  attempts 
among  adolescents.  For  example,  a  large  international 
study examining school- based intervention programmes 
for suicide prevention has shown that empowering youth 
and  teaching  coping  skills  result  in  decreased  suicidal 
ideation and suicide attempts.11 There have been recent 
advances in our understanding of precursors12 and treat-
ment13 of self- harm in young people. However, the iden-
tification  of  adolescents  at  risk  of  self- harm  and  suicide 
attempt  remains  difficult.  Various  studies  and  meta- 
analyses  have  been  undertaken  in  an  attempt  to  shed 
light on specific risk factors for self- harm and suicide in 
this  population.  Pre- existing  externalising  (eg,  conduct 
problems) and internalising symptoms (eg, depression or 
anxiety) of psychopathology have been demonstrated to 
be significant risk factors for suicidal behaviour.14 15 Other 
risk  factors  include:  sociodemographic  factors,  such  as 
age,16  gender,  sexual  orientation,  transgender  status 
and  socioeconomic  status17  18;  stressful  life  events,  most 
notably,  childhood  abuse19  20;  familial  factors,  including 
familial  psychopathology,  family  dysfunction,  family 
conflict  and  perceived  parental  support21–26;  school- 
related factors such as academic performance and school 
attendance27 28; biological factors such as genetic predis-
position,  changes  in  brain  structure  and  function,  and 
inflammatory status29–31; and social factors including peer 
relatedness, bullying perpetration and victimisation, and 
social media use.16 26 32–36 Some studies have examined the 
relationship between self- harm or suicidal behaviour and 
specific  emotions,  such  as  hopefulness  and  self- esteem 
and emotional lability.16 34 37 38

While  these  studies  are  of  great  importance  in 
elucidating  the  risk  factors  for  self- harm  and  suicidal 
behaviour,  their  clinical  utility  is  limited.  Such  a  large 
number  of  risk  factors  is  likely  to  be  overwhelming  for 
the  clinician  meeting  an  adolescent  in  the  emergency 
department,  and  in  the  primary  care  setting,  and  thus 
not a helpful guide for the psychiatric examination. Addi-
tionally,  many  systematic  reviews  and  meta- analyses  take 
into account both cross- sectional studies and longitudinal 
studies.18  27  36  39  40  Cross- sectional  studies  may  be  highly 
informative about the associations between various expo-
sures  and  outcomes.  However,  risk  or  protective  factors 
that  are  examined  in  cross- sectional  studies  cannot 
predict future events, due to the unclear temporal prece-
dence between predictors and outcomes.

This  protocol  describes  an  ongoing  systematic  review 
and meta- analysis which will examine the evidence from 
longitudinal studies of all identified risk factors for self- 
harm and suicide in children and adolescents. This review 
will have two aims:

2

1.  To provide summary strengths of association of the var-

ious risk factors for self- harm and suicide.

2.  To  identify  risk  factors  for  self- harm  and  suicide  that 
are still debated in the literature, and thus to shed light 
on areas that are still in need of investigation.

METHODS
Our  systematic  review  protocol  follows  the  Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis 
Protocols  (PRISMA- P)  guidelines41  (online  supple-
mental file 1—PRISMA- P checklist). The reporting of the 
systematic  review  and  meta- analysis  resulting  from  this 
protocol will follow the PRISMA2020 guidelines,42 and a 
completed PRISMA2020 checklist will be submitted with 
the  publication.  The  protocol  is  registered  on  PROS-
PERO, the international register of systematic reviews (ID 
CRD42021228212).  Any  changes  to  the  protocol  will  be 
recorded on PROSPERO.

Eligibility criteria
Study population
Our  target  population  is  male  or  female  children  (ie, 
young  persons  aged  up  to  10  years)  and  adolescents 
(ie,  young  persons  aged  11–17  years  in  early,  mid  and 
late  adolescence).  The  population  must  be  under  the 
age of 18 years at the time of both exposure to the risk 
factor and outcome (self- harm or suicide). The decision 
to  choose  18  years  as  the  upper  age  limit  was  based  on 
the  fact  that  in  most  countries,  this  is  the  age  at  which 
people transition to adulthood in many aspects. First, in 
many countries, this is the age at which people complete 
school.  Second,  age  18  years  is  when  people  legally 
become  adults.  Third,  age  18  years  is  the  typical  age  at 
which the transition from child and adolescent to adult 
mental  health  services  occurs.  If  a  study  includes  both 
young persons under 18 years and young adults who are 
over 18 years, then the study will only be included if (1) 
the  average  age  of  participants  is  under  18  years  or  (2) 
more than 50% of the participants are under 18 years or 
(3)  there  is  a  subgroup  analysis  for  participants  in  the 
study meeting the criterion (1) or (2).

Types of studies to be included
We  will  include  only  quantitative  longitudinal  studies, 
either prospective or retrospective. Thus, cross- sectional 
studies  will  be  excluded.  Retrospective  studies  that 
measure  the  existence  and  extent  of  risk  factors  using 
recall will be excluded, to avoid bias which tends to result 
in the exaggeration of the relationship between the risk 
factor and the outcome measured. As we consider many 
different risk/protective factors altogether, we do not set 
a threshold of eligibility for follow- up time in this study. 
Additionally,  we  will  exclude  intervention  studies,  quali-
tative studies, case reports or series, commentaries, edito-
rials  and  conference  abstracts.  Only  papers  written  in 
English language will be included.

Farbstein D, et al. BMJ Open 2022;12:e058297. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058297Exposure and outcome variables
We  will  include  any  study  that  examines  the  relation-
ship between any risk or protective factor and self- harm 
or  suicide.  Studies  included  must  examine  self- harm  or 
suicide  as  an  outcome.  There  are  many  definitions  and 
subdivisions for self- harm in the literature. As mentioned 
above, for our study, we decided to use the UK/European 
definition of self- harm, which is: any act of self- poisoning 
or  self- injury  carried  out  by  a  person,  irrespective  of 
their  motivation.43  This  broad  definition  includes  both 
(1)  non- suicidal  self- injury:  self- inflicted  destruction 
of  body  tissues  without  any  suicidal  intent,44  and  (2) 
suicide attempt: a non- fatal self- directed potentially inju-
rious  behaviour  with  any  intent  to  die  as  a  result  of  the 
behaviour.45  Any  type  of  ascertainment  of  the  outcome 
variables is acceptable, including but not limited to self- 
report  in  questionnaires  or  interviews,  collateral  report, 
school  or  police  records  and  medical  files.  As  suicidal 
ideation is not our outcome of interest, studies that report 
on suicidal ideation as the only outcome will be excluded.

Search methods
References will be extracted from the following databases 
according to the search strategy described below:
 ► Medline—Ovid platform
 ► PsycINFO—Ovid platform
 ► EMBASE—Ovid platform
 ► HMIC—Ovid platform
 ► CINAHL—EBSCO platform

Databases  will  be  searched  from  inception,  up  to  the 
present. The first wave of literature search was conducted 
to include studies published up to 28 October 2020, and 
the  search  will  be  updated  before  the  systematic  review 
publication.

For each of these databases, a search string was devel-
oped  to  include  relevant  keywords  and  synonyms  (see 
‘search  strategy’  in  online  supplemental  file  2).  Exam-
ination  of  citation  lists  of  previous  relevant  systematic 
reviews  and  meta- analyses  will  be  conducted  to  retrieve 
any  missed  papers.  Finally,  experts  in  the  field,  which 
will  include  principal  investigators  whose  peer- reviewed 
publications are included in our systematic review, as well 
as  investigators  from  our  extensive  immediate  research 
network,35  46–48  will  be  contacted  to  identify  any  missed 
papers.

Search strategy for electronic databases
Scoping  searches  were  initially  performed  to  refine  the 
search strategy and to optimise the balance between sensi-
tivity and specificity. Search strategies were subsequently 
developed  to  include  keywords  and  specific  thesaurus 
terms for each database to include the following concepts:
1.  Self- harm and suicide.
2.  Populations under 18 years.
3.  Association terms (eg, relationship, risk factor, correla-

tion, protective factors, etc).

4.  Study designs.

Open access

To overcome linguistic variations, truncations and wild-
cards were employed when necessary. The list of keywords 
and  thesaurus  terms  was  based  on  previous  systematic 
reviews about self- harm and suicide27 35 and was discussed 
and  finalised  by  a  team  of  experts  in  the  field  of  self- 
harm research in children and adolescents, tertiary- level 
and  secondary- level  service  clinicians,  and  experts  in 
the  fields  of  systematic  reviews  and  meta- analyses.  The 
concept of ‘study designs’ was introduced in other system-
atic reviews in this field,14 and thus was employed in our 
search  as  well.  For  this  concept,  we  used  the  keywords 
and thesaurus terms recommended by the British Medical 
Journal  Best  Practice  to  identify  cohort  and  case–control 
studies,49 but expanded the search to ensure sensitivity.

Reference selection and data extraction
Our  research 
team  members, 
comprising a mixture of researchers, clinicians and clin-
ical  academics,  including  several  with  expertise  in  self- 
harm and several with extensive experience of systematic 
reviews  and  meta- analyses  including  a  senior  statisti-
cian.  Following  removal  of  duplicate  references,  a  two- 
staged screening of references is undertaken aided by a 
prespecified screening instruction document. The docu-
ment, which details the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
is  devised  as  follows:  after  producing  a  first  draft  of  the 
screening  instructions,  the  entire  team  will  screen  100 
references with each member blinded to the decision of 
the other team members. The decisions will be discussed 
together in team meetings, and any ambiguity or lack of 
clarity in the screening instruction will be addressed and 
specific clarifications added to the instructions as neces-
sary.  This  process  will  be  repeated  until  a  90%  concor-
dance rate is reached among all team members.

Due to the anticipated large number of references and 
the constraint of time and resources to conduct this large- 
scale systematic review, once ≥90% concordance has been 
reached during the initial calibration process, remaining 
references  will  be  divided  equally  between  all  team 
members.  Following  this  process,  10%  of  all  references 
will be screened by two independent reviewers and refer-
ences will be equally divided into sets and be distributed 
among all team members. Every set of references will be 
screened by one screener from the team during the title/
abstract screening stage, with a random sample of 10% of 
the  references  reviewed  by  a  second  screener,  following 
similar  approaches  in  previous  large- scale  systematic 
reviews.50–52  Agreement  rates  for  every  pair  of  screeners 
will  be  recorded  and  reported  as  per  cent  agreement.53 
If  the  agreement  rates  between  pairs  of  screeners  were 
lower than 90% within the set of 10% randomly selected 
articles,  all  remaining  articles  in  this  set  will  be  double- 
screened.  Articles  progressing  to  full- text  screening  will 
be  retrieved  and  screened  by  a  single  screener,  with  a 
random  sample  of  10%  reviewed  by  a  second  screener, 
again  similar  to  previous  approaches.50–52  If  we  identify 
more than one study, which includes the same or overlap-
ping samples, we will prioritise studies using the following

hierarchy:  largest  sample,  longest  follow- up,  adjusted 
for highest number of confounders. All discarded items 
will be recorded, including a reason for exclusion at the 
full- text  screening  stage.  These  screening  stages  will  be 
conducted using the online systematic review tool Rayyan 
(https://www.rayyan.ai/).

Data  will  be  extracted  using  a  unified  data  extraction 
form that will be drafted a priori and collaboratively with 
the  team.  This  will  be  piloted  with  the  team  and  then 
for  pragmatic  reasons  (due  to  the  anticipated  number 
of included studies), data on study characteristics will be 
extracted  by  single  reviewers,  with  a  random  subsample 
of 10% of papers will be audited by a second reviewer. All 
statistical  data  relating  to  study  results  will  be  extracted 
by two independent reviewers. The following data will be 
extracted: type of study, participant eligibility and recruit-
ment  method,  participant  description  including  age, 
gender  and  ethnicity,  diagnosis  if  applicable,  country, 
study  dates,  sample  size,  definitions  and  measures  of 
outcomes,  blinding,  duration  of  follow- up,  number  and 
type  of  predictors,  definition  and  method  for  measure-
ment of candidate predictors (eg, categories may include 
demographics,  psychopathology,  family  relationships, 
peer  relationships,  treatment  history,  etc),  timing  of 
predictor  measurement,  missing  data  and  its  handling, 
authors,  year  of  publication,  type  of  statistical  analysis, 
summary statistics and summary findings.

With  regard  to  the  summary  statistics,  we  will  collect 
effect  measures  expressing  the  association  between  risk 
factors  and  outcomes,  as  reported  in  individual  studies, 
which  are  likely  to  include  ORs,  HRs,  risk  ratios  (RRs), 
mean  difference  (MD)  and  standardised  MD  with  95% 
CIs and significant p values, or SEs where appropriate, as 
well as which covariates have been adjusted for.

Any  disagreement  over  reference  eligibility,  during 
the  title/abstract  and  full- text  screening  stages,  or  data 
extraction  will  be  discussed  between  the  two  screeners/
reviewers.  If  a  consensus  cannot  be  reached,  a  third 
screener (DO) will adjudicate.

Risk of bias assessment
The  Newcastle–Ottawa  Scale  (NOS)54  will  be  used  to 
assess  risk  of  bias  in  observational/non- randomised 
studies.  The  risk  of  bias  assessment  will  be  shared  out 
among multiple members of the research team with pairs 
of  reviewers  working  independently  applying  the  NOS. 
Separate  versions  of  NOS  are  available  for  assessing  the 
risks of bias in case–control and cohort studies, based on 
(1) the selection of study participants, for example, their 
representativeness  and  ascertainment;  (2)  the  compara-
bility between participant groups, that is, cases/exposed 
cohort or controls/non- exposed cohort; and (3) the risk 
of  bias  associated  with  the  exposures  in  cohort  studies, 
that  is,  the  ascertainment  of  exposures,  comparability 
of  exposure  ascertainment  in  case  and  controls,  and 
response rates; or outcomes in cohort studies, that is, the 
assessments of outcomes, follow- up periods and adequacy 
of follow- up of cohorts. Assessment of risk of bias will be 

4

conducted separately for case–control and cohort studies 
using the appropriate NOS versions.

Certain items of the NOS require tailoring to the specific 
systematic  review  or  meta- analysis  being  conducted.  A 
version of the NOS adapted for relevance to this research 
question has been developed and agreed a priori by the 
research  team.  In  particular,  we  determined  the  accept-
able level of loss to follow- up and acceptable methods of 
ascertainment  of  the  exposure  and  outcome  variables. 
Missing  data  within  individual  studies  (eg,  due  to  attri-
tion) will be reported and be taken into account as part of 
the quality assessment, and the level of bias it introduced 
into the findings will be considered for each study.

Finally,  the  discrepancies  between  two  reviewers 
regarding  a  study’s  risk  of  bias  ratings  will  be  resolved 
through  discussions,  if  necessary,  in  the  presence  of  a 
third  reviewer  (DO)  who  will  adjudicate  if  a  consensus 
cannot be reached.

Data presentation and statistical analysis
Where  possible,  a  meta- analysis  will  be  conducted  to 
synthesise  evidence.  Alternatively,  we  will  perform  a 
narrative synthesis without meta- analysis using the quan-
titative data of the included studies.55 Depending on the 
available data, synthesis of quantitative data may involve 
summarising  estimates  of  effect  (ie,  strength  of  asso-
ciation  in  our  context)  in  narratives  or  vote  counting 
based on the direction of the effects.56 We will calculate 
missing  outcome  data,  if  possible,  from  the  available 
data within the article to enable consistent reporting or 
potentially  to  include  them  in  the  meta- analyses.  If  this 
is  not  possible,  the  findings  will  be  reported  within  the 
narrative synthesis in qualitative manner. The findings of 
association between risk factors and self- harm outcomes 
will be grouped according to categories of outcomes (ie, 
self- harm or completed suicide). Then, for each outcome 
group,  the  association  between  the  risk  factors  and  the 
outcome will be grouped by similar risk factor concepts, 
in  line  with  clinically  meaningful  categorisation  from 
past  literature,  for  instance,  ‘existing  psychopathology’, 
internalising,  externalising  and  general 
including 
psychopathology; ‘family relationships’, including family 
dynamics, parenting styles and familial resources; ‘demo-
graphic  variables’, 
including  socioeconomic  status, 
ethnicity,  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity;  ‘peer 
relationships’,  such  as  bullying  and  victimisation,  ostra-
cism and interactions via social media; and previous self- 
harm events. The relative strength of associations between 
all identified factors with the outcome will be discussed. 
Extracted  data  about  participant  sample  characteristics, 
study  methodologies  and  a  summary  of  findings  from 
each study will be presented in a table of characteristics 
of included studies.

Random- effect  meta- analysis  will  be  conducted,  given 
the  anticipated  variation  of  sample  characteristics  and 
outcome  measures  across  studies.  There  is  likely  to  be 
variation in the statistical effect measures used across the 
literature; however, most studies are expected to compare 

Farbstein D, et al. BMJ Open 2022;12:e058297. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058297those with and without the exposure of interest when esti-
mating their association with binary self- harm outcomes 
(ie, with or without self- harm), and would use ORs, HRs 
or  RRs  to  index  such  association.  ORs  are  expected  to 
be  the  effect  measure  mostly  used  by  any  eligible  case–
control studies. Furthermore, the ORs can be easily inter-
preted  clinically.57  58  For  these  reasons,  synthesis  will  be 
conducted  using  OR  summary  statistics  to  examine  the 
pooled association between each predictor and self- harm. 
Where possible, other effect measures will be transformed 
to ORs for synthesis.

The meta- analyses will be conducted on findings from 
studies  investigating  similar  exposure  and  outcome 
variables. If a study reports multiple effects of interest, 
then we will include all the available effects. If there is 
more  than  one  reported  effect  in  relation  to  the  same 
exposure  and  outcome,  the  effect  adjusted  for  the 
largest  number  of  confounders  will  be  included.  We 
will  illustrate  the  data  using  a  forest  plot,  with  95%  CI 
and  p  value  reported.  It  is  expected  that  there  will  be 
significant  heterogeneity  between  studies.  Thus,  the  I2 
statistics will be calculated to index statistical heteroge-
neity  in  the  meta- analysis.  Finally,  publication  bias  will 
be assessed by funnel plots and Egger’s test if there are 
at  least  10  studies  within  the  meta- analysis  (Cochrane 
Handbook 13.3.5.459).

For  each  exposure  and  outcome,  an  assessment  of 
strength of evidence will be performed by applying the 
Grading  of  Recommendations  Assessment,  Develop-
ment and Evaluation (GRADE60) approach adapted for 
non- randomised studies. We will use the GRADE tool to 
assess the quality of evidence, that is, the certainty of the 
estimate  of  association  between  individual  risk  factors 
and each self- harm outcome. The GRADE tool will only 
be  applied  following  a  meta- analysis,  that  is,  when  the 
pooled  evidence  of  association  between  specific  risk 
factors and a self- harm outcome could be obtained. We 
will  use  the  95%  CI  to  assess  precision  for  the  GRADE 
tool.  If  the  95%  CI  does  not  cross  the  line  of  non- 
significance,  the  risk  estimate  will  be  considered  to  be 
sufficiently precise.

Subgroup  analyses  according  to  age  (children,  ie, 
young  persons  aged  up  to  10  years  vs  adolescents,  that 
is,  young  persons  aged  11–17  years),  gender  (female  vs 
male)  and  country  (high- income  vs  low/middle- income 
country)  will  be  conducted  if  possible.  The  quantitative 
synthesis  of  findings  will  be  based  on  meta- analyses  of 
all samples collected in the study. However, to assess the 
influence  of  risk  of  bias  of  the  individual  studies  in  the 
quantitative synthesis, we also plan to conduct sensitivity 
meta- analyses including only studies deemed to have low 
risk  of  bias  (see  Hetrick  et  al61  for  a  similar  approach). 
Studies with low risk of bias are defined by a total NOS 
score ≥7 following past reports.62 63

DISCUSSION
This  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis  will  attempt  to 
outline the risk and protective factors for self- harm and 
suicide among children and adolescents. A major strength 
of our work will be its focus on longitudinal studies. The 
exclusion of cross- sectional studies will highlight the risk 
factors and protective factors that predict self- harm and 
suicide, as opposed to those that co- occur with them.

Conducting  this  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis 
presents  various  challenges.  Although  we  have  used 
broad search terms to increase the chance of identifying 
all relevant data, there remains a chance that data could 
be missed due to the wide range of different terminolo-
gies used in different settings. Additionally, it is possible 
that suicide or self- harm may not be reported in the title 
or abstract and is omitted from the keywords if it is not a 
major outcome in the study. To reduce the risk of missing 
significant data, in addition to database searches, we will 
examine the reference lists of previous systematic reviews 
and  meta- analyses  on  the  subject  and  consult  experts 
in  the  field  (ie,  principal  investigators  of  peer- reviewed 
papers  included  in  this  review  as  well  as  investigators 
from our research network) to identify additional papers. 
An additional challenge will be the synthesis of the data. 
Besides  the  variation  in  the  level  of  bias  in  the  studies 
that needs to be accounted for, methodology may differ 
significantly  for  the  measurement  of  different  risk  and 
protective  factors.  For  example,  psychiatric  symptoms 
may  be  measured  using  various  methods:  clinical  evalu-
ation,  questionnaires  and  structured  or  semistructured 
interviews, each method with its unique features in terms 
of reliability and validity. These variations will need to be 
taken  into  account  when  synthesising  data  of  different 
studies.

The  primary  goal  of  our  work  will  be  to  describe  the 
strength  of  association  between  various  risk  and  protec-
tive  factors  and  self- harm  and  suicide  outcomes  in  chil-
dren and adolescents. We hope this work will inform the 
clinician assessing a child or adolescent in the outpatient 
clinic  or  emergency  department  regarding  important 
areas  that  need  to  be  covered  to  optimally  assess  future 
self- harm and suicide risk. The need for future research 
in  different  areas,  whether  due  to  insufficient  studies, 
poorly  conducted  studies,  or  the  lack  of  use  of  similar 
terminology  or  methodology  that  would  allow  adequate 
data synthesis and conclusions, will also be highlighted.

ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
Ethical  approval  for  this  study  is  not  needed,  since  it  is 
based on the review of published literature only. The full 
protocol and the findings of this study will be published 
in peer- reviewed journals whose major audience are prac-
titioners in child and adolescent mental health.
