Abstract

Purpose of the review:  Sexual victimization is a significant public health concern. Compared 
to heterosexual and cisgender peers, sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) individuals are at 
elevated risk for sexual victimization. Prominent theories suggest that this risk is due in part 
to the stigma SGM individuals face when navigating heteronormative cultures. The goal of this 
article is to review the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of sexual victimization in SGM 
individuals.

Recent findings:  Studies continue to show that SGM individuals—bisexual and/or gender 
minoritized in particular—are at higher risk for sexual victimization. Little work has focused on 
risk factors, though recent research continues to highlight post-victimization disparities among 
SGM individuals. Emerging studies also point to theoretically informed factors that may influence 
victimization risk and recovery, including sexual and gender-related stigma.

Summary:  To inform prevention and intervention efforts, future research would benefit from 
streamlining assessment, methodology, and dissemination practices.

Introduction

Sexual victimization is a pervasive problem worldwide. In the US, upwards of 18.3% of 
women and 1.4% of men have experienced rape in their lifetime (1). Moreover, 44.6% of 
women and 22.2% of men report sexual victimization other than rape (1). Specific groups, 
such as those identifying as sexual and gender minoritized (SGM), are at particularly high 
risk for sexual victimization (2, 3). The negative impact of victimization on subsequent

mental and physical health outcomes has been well documented (4), including among 
SGM individuals (5)••. Drawing on our knowledge of the research literature, with a focus 
on quantitative studies published from the US and Canada in the past year (2021–2022), 
we review the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of sexual victimization in SGM 
individuals. When possible, we highlight studies examining differences between SGM and 
other groups (e.g., heterosexual and/or cisgender), but also within SGM sub-groups (e.g., 
gay versus bisexual). Recommendations for future research will also be discussed.

Operationalizing Sexual and Gender Identity

According to a 2020 Gallup poll, 5.6% of US adults self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
and/or transgender (6). Sexual and gender identity are fluid constructs that evolve over an 
individual’s lifetime amidst an ever-shifting cultural backdrop (7, 8). Given the challenges 
of defining the complexities of human experiences, standard definitions are necessary to 
provide a foundation for this review.

Sexual orientation is a multidimensional construct that includes sexual attraction, sexual 
behavior, and sexual identity. Terms like lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and heterosexual 
are frequently used to refer to sexual identity but also can describe sexual attraction 
and/or behavior. Attraction and behavior, however, do not always align with how someone 
identifies. For example, during adolescence, sexual attraction is a prominent element of 
sexual orientation as many may not yet know or want to label their sexual identity, let 
alone disclose it to others (9). Sexual orientation is fluid across the lifespan (10, 11) and, 
particularly in the case of identity and behavior, may vary by social context (e.g., home, 
school, work).

Gender identity is an individual’s psychological sense of their gender (12) and is distinct 
from sexual orientation. Cisgender refers to someone for whom their sex assigned at birth 
aligns with their gender identity. Transgender is a broad term that captures the experiences 
of those whose assigned sex does not align with how they identify. Moreover, there are 
a variety of other terms used by individuals for whom the categories of male/female fail 
to capture how they see themselves, such as agender, genderqueer, gender fluid, gender 
non-conforming, and non-binary (13). Gender expression, on the other hand, involves how 
an individual communicates their gender identity to others via their appearance, clothing, or 
mannerisms (14).

Sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) is used to represent a vast array of identities and 
experiences under a single population label (15). When necessary, in this article, we use 
sexual minoritized in reference to individuals who endorse a sexual orientation other than 
heterosexual (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual) and gender minoritized in reference to individuals 
(regardless of sexual orientation) who endorse a gender identity that does not align with their 
sex assigned at birth (e.g., transgender, genderqueer, non-binary).

Theoretical Frameworks for Sexual Stigma and Minority Stress

In 2016, SGM individuals were designated as a health disparity population by the National 
Institutes of Health in recognition that this group disproportionally suffers from worse 
mental and physical health outcomes relative to heterosexual and cisgender peers. Notably,

these disparities are often exacerbated in SGM individuals who have experienced sexual 
victimization (16–18)•. This risk, both for sexual victimization and worse post-victimization 
outcomes, may be attributable, at least in part, to the stigma SGM individuals face when 
navigating a heteronormative culture.

Sexual stigma and gender minority stigma reflect the negative regard that society 
directs toward non-heterosexual and non-gender-conforming experiences, identities, 
and communities (19, 20). These stigmas are fundamentally rooted in systems that 
privilege heterosexual and cisgender individuals (19), resulting in a culture of pervasive 
heteronormativity, which assumes everyone is heterosexual and other sexual identities are 
inferior, and gender binarism, which assumes that gender only exists as a male/female binary 
and thus stigmatizes those who do not conform (20). These ways of thinking are ingrained 
in social norms, institutions, and laws, resulting in pervasive implicit and explicit culturally 
stigmatizing messages that SGM individuals are not only lower on the social ladder, but also 
justifiable targets for violence.

Societal-level manifestations of stigma affect SGM individuals in three main ways (19). 
First, enacted stigma is the direct experience of discrimination or victimization as a result 
of sexual and/or gender identity. Second, even in the absence of enacted stigma, SGM 
individuals can be affected by felt stigma, which refers to the constant worry that one 
will be victimized or discriminated against because of their identities. Third, internalized 
stigma refers to SGM individuals’ acceptance of societal-level stigma into their own self-
concept (i.e., internalized heterosexism). Minority stress theory (21–23) posits that the 
chronic stress SGM individuals experience from these stigmas perpetuate health disparities. 
Thus, minority stress can influence cognitive, affective, and interpersonal processes to “get 
under the skin” and adversely impact the mental and physical health of those chronically 
exposed (24). Awareness of this vulnerability is a critical prerequisite to understanding 
sexual victimization risk in SGM individuals as well as factors that may promote or inhibit 
post-victimization recovery.

Sexual Victimization Among Sexual and Gender Minoritized Groups

Sexual victimization includes a wide range of nonconsensual sexual experiences including 
unwanted contact, attempted rape, and completed rape (25). At any level of severity, 
perpetrators can use a variety of tactics including threats, physical force, incapacitation 
from alcohol or other drugs, or not giving one a chance to say “no” (26). Although sexual 
victimization research has historically focused on rape, it is critical to consider the full 
range of severity, as lower severity incidents like sexual harassment and touching are 
highly prevalent and more commonly endorsed than rape (27, 28). Moreover, lower severity 
victimization can serve as a form of ‘boundary testing’ and has the potential to escalate into 
more severe forms of victimization (29).

Compared to heterosexual and cisgender peers, SGM individuals report higher rates of 
sexual victimization. In a systematic review of 75 studies, Rothman et al. (2011) found 
that 43% of sexual minoritized women and 30% of sexual minoritized men experience 
sexual victimization in their lifetime (2). Across individual studies, prevalence rates tend to 
vary widely (e.g., 16–85% of sexual minoritized women, 12–54% of sexual minoritized

men) (2). This variability is likely due to heterogeneity in recruitment methods (e.g., 
convenience samples versus nationally representative samples) as well as the methods for 
assessing sexual victimization (e.g., single item versus behaviorally-specific sets of items). 
Recently published prevalence rates continue to underscore sexual victimization disparities 
for SGM individuals (30, 31, 32)•, while also showing greater severity of victimization 
in this population (32)•. In a national college sample, SGM students were more likely to 
have ever experienced sexual victimization (30.8% of sexual minoritized students, 45% of 
gender minoritized students) compared to students identifying as heterosexual (18.5%) or 
cisgender (19.6%), respectively (33)•. An emerging body of research has also identified 
heightened risk in sub-groups of SGM individuals. For instance, Grocott et al. (2021) 
found that gender minoritized students were nearly 9 times more likely to have experienced 
sexual victimization than cisgender students. In a national, non-probability sample, 80.1% 
of bisexual women and 62.7% of lesbian women reported a sexual victimization history 
relative to 44.4% of heterosexual women (34)•. Consistent with the larger literature (35)•, 
Canan et al. (2021) showed that bisexual women in particular reported higher rates than both 
lesbian and heterosexual women, though lesbian women also were at elevated risk compared 
to heterosexual peers (34)•. These studies underscore the importance of not only exploring 
differences between groups, but also within SGM populations, to help identify who might be 
especially at risk.

Sexual Victimization Correlates

A rigorous body of research has identified factors that heighten vulnerability for sexual 
victimization among (presumably) heterosexual women, including a history of childhood 
sexual abuse (36, 37), hazardous alcohol use (38), and sexual risk behaviors (39). These 
factors have also been found to predict sexual victimization among SGM individuals (40, 41, 
42)• and are consistent with minority stress theory (21–23) and a self-medication framework 
(43), which would posit that SGM individuals may be more likely to cope with chronic 
minority stress via alcohol or sex. Over time, these short-term self-regulatory attempts can 
reinforce and maintain maladaptive coping, but also inadvertently increase risk for sexual 
revictimization.

Importantly, and in alignment with minority stress theory, emergent studies suggest that 
sexual and gender identity-related stigma directly impact victimization experiences. For 
example, consistent with a stigma-based framework, the association between being a 
transgender person of color and sexual victimization severity was stronger for those with 
greater trans visibility (i.e., “people can tell I am transgender even if I don’t tell them”) 
(44)•. Other recent research has more directly considered the impact of minority stress 
on sexual victimization risk, particularly among bisexual identified individuals, as this sub-
group is at greater risk relative to both heterosexual and other sexual minoritized peers (35)•. 
For instance, bisexual women who experienced biphobia and hostile sexism in their social 
circles were more likely to report sexual victimization in the past year (45)•. Relatedly, 
sexual stigma was found to predict sexual victimization for bisexual SGM individuals, 
and to a lesser degree, lesbian SGM individuals (46)•. Notably, much of the literature 
on sexual victimization prevalence and correlates, including recent research, has relied on 
cross-sectional designs. Certainly, more longitudinal studies are needed to understand the

shared and unique risk factors that make SGM individuals - including specific sub-groups - 
more vulnerable to sexual victimization.

The Sequelae of Sexual Victimization

Within the larger literature, sexual victimization in (presumably) heterosexual populations 
has been associated with a host of mental health consequences, including depression, 
anxiety, posttraumatic stress, disordered eating, and substance use disorders (4). These 
associations also hold true for SGM individuals. For example, among sexual minoritized 
cisgender women, those who experienced rape in adulthood reported more mental health 
symptoms and more hazardous drinking than their non-victimized peers (16)•. Holmes 
et al. (2021) found a significant association between sexual victimization and disordered 
eating among bisexual cisgender women (47)•. Similarly, a secondary analysis of 27,795 
US transgender individuals indicated that past-year unwanted sexual contact was associated 
with increased risk for suicidal ideation (48)•. Sexual victimization is also associated with 
negative physical health outcomes. For instance, sexual minoritized cisgender women who 
were sexually revictimized were at increased risk for binge eating, obesity, and hypertension 
(49)•.

The reviewed literature suggests that both SGM identity and sexual victimization history 
confer independent risk for negative mental health, substance use, and physical health 
outcomes. Fewer studies, however, have explored how the link between sexual victimization 
and post-victimization consequences vary as a function of SGM identity. Theory (21, 
22, 24) posits that the chronic stress associated with SGM identities “gets under the 
skin” to contribute to mental health disparities, and for SGM individuals who experience 
sexual victimization, this can further complicate post-victimization recovery. In support of 
this notion, a study of US students found the association between sexual victimization 
and depression was greater for SGM individuals than cisgender heterosexual men (30)•. 
Similarly, in a study of Quebecois cisgender college students, sexual victimization severity 
was more strongly associated with trauma symptoms among sexual minoritized women than 
heterosexual women (50)•. Extending findings to substance use, among cisgender women 
presenting to a family planning clinic, sexual victimization was associated with heavier 
alcohol use in sexual minoritized women, but not heterosexual women (51)•.

Contrary to these recent studies, others have not found support for interactions between 
sexual victimization and SGM identity in the prediction of depressive symptoms (52)•, 
PTSD symptoms (30, 52)•, or cigarette use (51)•, such that the association between 
victimization and these outcomes did not vary by SGM identity. Moreover, in a sample 
of 60,200 US college students, unwanted sexual contact in the past year was associated with 
depression and suicidal ideation in both sexual minoritized and heterosexual students (53)•. 
Further, Norris et al. (2021) found that sexual victimization was associated with a greater 
likelihood of past month cannabis use in heterosexual women, but not sexual minoritized 
women. Thus, findings regarding how SGM identity might contribute to negative post-
victimization outcomes are mixed.

Relatedly, little is known about factors that promote resilience for SGM individuals who 
experience sexual victimization. In a national study of university students, a sense of

belonging with the campus community served as a stronger buffer against post-victimization 
depression for sexual minoritized students relative to heterosexual students (53)•. However, 
sexual victimization can negatively impact resilience factors. Consistent with a broader 
literature linking trauma exposure to deterioration of social support over time (54), sexual 
revictimization among sexual minoritized women was associated with lower social support 
(49)•. Research informed by positive psychological factors (e.g., posttraumatic growth, 
resilience, social support) is greatly needed to highlight the unique strengths of SGM 
individuals and ways that resilience can be fostered following sexual victimization (55). 
With few exceptions, sexual victimization research has yet to widely consider the role of 
stigma in contributing to disparities in post-victimization outcomes among SGM individuals 
or resiliency factors that may promote post-victimization recovery. More research is needed 
in this regard.

Implications for Research

Earlier reviews of interpersonal violence in SGM populations (56, 57) identified critical 
weaknesses in the rigor of the literature that continue to persist today. These included: (1) 
few studies that distinguish between sex assigned at birth, sexual orientation, and gender 
identity; (2) poor operational definitions, and thus, inconsistent measurement of sexual 
victimization; (3) inadequate sample sizes; and (4) reliance on cross-sectional designs. 
Echoing these weaknesses, we propose the following recommendations in light of our recent 
literature review.

Recommendation 1: Improve Assessment

Notable limitations in assessment pervade the literature and weaken methodological rigor. 
For example, many studies rely on single, self-identification items of sexual orientation 
that offer limited response options for participants to choose from (e.g., lesbian/gay, 
bisexual, heterosexual). As such, we miss out on the nuance in how SGM individuals might 
otherwise identify (e.g., asexual, demisexual, pansexual), but also in the representation of 
SGM sub-groups. For instance, ‘mostly’ heterosexual is an identity that is distinct from 
both heterosexual and bisexual and makes up the largest SGM sub-group (58), yet is 
not captured in studies when this identity is not listed (i.e., this group will otherwise 
select ‘heterosexual’ over ‘bisexual’) (59). In addition, sexual orientation contains other 
components, including sexual attraction and behavior, which may or may not align with 
sexual identity (e.g., men who have sex with men). Further, gender expression, which is how 
an individual communicates their gender identity to others via their appearance, clothing, or 
mannerisms (14), is rarely assessed or reported in sexual victimization research. This is a 
considerable limitation as identity may be serving as a proxy for gender expression, though 
gender expression may be a more proximal risk factor for stigma-related discrimination or 
victimization (44)•. Fine tuning our assessment, both in terms of identity and expression, 
will allow us to better understand the diversity of SGM experiences as well as identify SGM 
sub-groups that may be more hidden, yet at elevated risk.

Furthermore, there is a propensity in the literature to frame identity categories as predictors 
of sexual victimization and post-victimization outcomes for analytical purposes. While

this practice may capture the differences between groups (e.g., SGM versus heterosexual 
and/or cisgender), minority stress theory posits that it is the experiences associated with 
marginalized identities – not the identities themselves – that lead to disparities. It will be 
essential to move away from using identity categories as proxies of minority stress and, 
instead, measure the putative mechanisms (i.e., stigma, minority stress) as the constructs of 
interest.

Another critical issue is that the most widely utilized measures to assess sexual victimization 
were developed from a heteronormative perspective (see (60)• for exception). For example, 
the Sexual Strategies Scale (61) only assesses male-to-female perpetration and does not 
consider relationship type. Similarly, the Revised Sexual Experiences Survey (62) includes 
a range of tactics (e.g., verbal pressure, physical force, incapacitation), but does not include 
culturally-relevant tactics specific to the SGM community (e.g., threatening to expose the 
individual’s sexual or gender identity to others). Although recent efforts have been made to 
adapt this measure to include less heteronormative language (34)••, these adaptations have 
not yet been widely tested nor implemented. Measures of sexual victimization perpetration 
and victimization must also be adapted to erase heterosexist bias that presumes male-to-
female violence by assessing the perpetrator’s gender identity, sexual orientation, and 
relationship to the SGM individual. Beyond this, qualitative research exploring the nature 
and scope of sexual victimization experiences within the SGM community could help 
inform the creation of assessments better centered in SGM experiences. This necessary work 
in measurement development should be conducted and tested with feedback from the SGM 
community.

Recommendation 2: Address Contextual Factors

The study of sexual victimization in SGM populations must also account for the range of 
perpetrator types along a relationship spectrum (e.g., stranger, casual acquaintance, friend, 
romantic partner). While attention to this important contextual factor is often missing 
in sexual victimization research (63)•, it is particularly relevant for SGM individuals, 
who may be at elevated risk for victimization from those they know – particularly 
romantic partners (64). Unfortunately, research “silos” exist, as sexual victimization research 
does not typically assess the relationship context and couples-focused research does 
not typically assess sexual victimization within the relationship. Thus, it is critical that 
future research break down these “silos” by adapting existing measurement approaches 
to more comprehensively assess sexual victimization both within and outside of intimate 
relationships. As the use of these methods begin to clarify victimization across different 
relationship types, research will be better equipped to examine individual and contextual 
risk factors to understand in what situations, and for whom, these effects are most likely to 
be observed. Until these goals are met, the field will be inadequately informed to develop 
effective and culturally-relevant prevention approaches.

Recommendation 3: Eliminate Sampling Biases

Research on sexual victimization suffers from sampling biases that systematically exclude 
SGM individuals or limit examination of sub-group differences. Sampling methods either 
assume that participants identify as heterosexual and cisgender or exclude SGM individuals

for parsimony and/or concerns over sample size. While there are certainly studies that 
focus on sexual victimization in SGM individuals, such as those discussed earlier in this 
review, standard practice is to sample a specific subpopulation to the exclusion of other 
subpopulations. A related problem is the common practice to combine sexual minoritized 
individuals – across birth sex and/or sexual identity – into one group (i.e., LGB) to compare 
sexual victimization rates and post-victimization outcomes to heterosexual peers. This 
practice increases sample size and representativeness, but erases critical differences found 
even among SGM sub-groups. Together, these weaknesses make it difficult to examine 
similarities and differences in the risks and consequences of sexual victimization as well 
as the mechanisms that reinforce or maintain negative outcomes among SGM individuals. 
This is particularly problematic with respect to gender minoritized individuals, who are most 
likely to be excluded from sexual victimization research due to such sampling bias.

Collectively, these sampling methods are directly responsible for the marginalization and 
invisibility of SGM individuals in the sexual victimization research literature. Assumptions 
of heterosexuality predominate research, and thus, sexual and gender identity are rarely 
measured or reported. Consequently, SGM individuals and the unique stressors they 
experience are erased from empirical investigations of sexual victimization. To this end, 
we recommend (1) intentional efforts to oversample sub-groups of SGM individuals with 
careful consideration of gender versus sexual identity, and (2) assess and report sexual and 
gender identities to characterize the inclusion of SGM individuals in sexual victimization 
research, even when SGM individuals are not the central focus of the investigation. These 
best practices are critical to move the state of science forward to understand and address 
sexual victimization disparities.

Recommendation 4: Incorporate an Intersectional Approach

To improve the health and well-being of SGM individuals, research must consider the 
impact of intersectional identities and related experiences among SGM sub-groups (65). 
Intersectionality theory posits that multiple forms of oppression converge to create social 
conditions that facilitate discrimination (66). Thus, marginalized identities, including those 
related to sexual orientation, gender identity, and race/ethnicity, are best understood in 
combination. Given this, it is not surprising that individuals with multiple marginalized 
identities are more likely to have worse health outcomes than individuals with only one (67).

Within studies employing an intersectional approach, as noted previously, there is a tendency 
to use identity categories as predictors of negative outcomes. For example, Gilmore et al. 
(2021) found that sexual minoritized cisgender women who identified as Latinx reported 
less severe past year sexual victimization than White sexual minoritized cisgender women 
(68)•. However, to more appropriately consider intersectionality, studies that focus on the 
mechanisms of sexual victimization (e.g., stigma, minority stress) are needed rather than 
categorical indicators such as sexual orientation, gender, or race/ethnicity. Understanding 
racially, ethnically, and economically diverse SGM in the context of multiple oppressions 
(51, 68) • is a necessary step for furthering our understanding of sexual victimization risk 
and post-victimization recovery. In doing so, the field will be better positioned to develop

and implement prevention and interventions that address the unique social conditions, 
especially for SGM individuals of color and those of lower socioeconomic status.

Recommendation 5: Increase Use of Longitudinal Designs

In our review, the majority of new research published has been cross-sectional. Future 
studies must move beyond cross-sectional designs to incorporate measurement approaches 
that can more accurately capture (1) the proximal and temporal occurrences between 
relevant and unique SGM-related risk and protective factors of sexual victimization, and 
(2) developmental trajectories documenting sexual victimization and post-victimization 
outcomes over time and across the lifespan. This need could be best met with longitudinal 
panel designs, intensive longitudinal designs (e.g., daily diary or ecological momentary 
assessment), and/or measurement burst designs (e.g., longitudinal surveys with periods of 
daily diary or ecological momentary assessment). Among these, only intensive longitudinal 
designs allow for the assessment of proximal and temporal effects between variables to 
identify mechanisms of sexual victimization risks and consequences. Such designs are 
particularly well-suited to address both person-level (i.e., between-person) and situation-
level (i.e., within-person) differences. In addition, only longitudinal panel designs and 
intensive longitudinal designs are able to assess developmental trajectories to consider the 
impact of sexual victimization on short- and long-term consequences as well as what factors 
reinforce or maintain consequences over time. We encourage future researchers to build on 
intensive designs focused on post-victimization outcomes among SGM individuals to date 
(61) to identify proximal risk factors of sexual victimization (27)• among SGM individuals 
in future research. Overall, as these complexities are better understood, prevention and 
interventions can be directed at appropriate “upstream” targets.

Recommendation 6: Standardize Reporting

Lastly, standardized reporting requirements are critically needed to advance knowledge 
about the sexual victimization experiences of SGM individuals, particularly sub-group 
differences within this diverse population. For example, journals, as well as Editors of 
journals, could require reporting of sex assigned at birth, sexual identity, and gender identity 
as basic demographics in all articles. Further, standard practices should include detailed 
reporting of measurement strategies (e.g., instrumentation), particularly for sexual and 
gender identity measures. When examining sexual victimization, researchers should pay 
particular attention to reporting sexual victimization prevalence rates, including severity, in 
not just the overall sample, but also within SGM sub-groups. Journals, particularly those 
with broad readership, should request articles on this topic so that this work is not limited 
to special issues or SGM-focused journals whose readership is already aware of the critical 
need for this research.

Conclusion

SGM individuals are disproportionately impacted by sexual victimization. Our review 
of recent research in this area indicates replication of earlier results concerning higher 
prevalence rates and greater likelihood for SGM individuals to suffer from worse post-
victimization outcomes when compared to heterosexual and cisgender individuals. However, 
gaps in knowledge persist, particularly the need to understand the unique role of minority

Limitations provide opportunities for future work to move beyond establishing prevalence 
to identify risk and protective factors that will most effectively facilitate prevention and 
intervention efforts among SGM individuals.
