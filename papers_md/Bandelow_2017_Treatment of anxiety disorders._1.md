Introduction

  A nxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychi-

atric disorders and are associated with a high burden of 
illness.1-3 With a 12-month prevalence of 10.3%, specific 
(isolated) phobias are the most common anxiety disor-
ders,4 although persons suffering from isolated phobias 
rarely  seek  treatment.  Panic  disorder  with  or  without 
agoraphobia (PDA) is the next most common type with 
a prevalence of 6.0%, followed by social anxiety disor-
der (SAD, also called social phobia; 2.7%) and general-
ized anxiety disorder (GAD; 2.2%). Evidence is lacking 
on whether these disorders have become more frequent 
in recent decades.5,6 Women are 1.5 to two times more 
likely than men to receive a diagnosis of anxiety disor-
der.7
  The age of onset for anxiety disorders differs among 
the disorders. Separation anxiety disorder and specific 
phobia start during childhood, with a median age of on-
set of 7 years, followed by SAD (13 years), agoraphobia 
without panic attacks (20 years), and panic disorder (24 
years).8 GAD may start even later in life. Anxiety disor-

Anxiety  disorders  (generalized  anxiety  disorder,  panic 
disorder/agoraphobia,  social  anxiety  disorder,  and  oth-
ers) are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and are 
associated  with  a  high  burden  of  illness.  Anxiety  disor-
ders are often underrecognized and undertreated in pri-
mary care. Treatment is indicated when a patient shows 
marked  distress  or  suffers  from  complications  resulting 
from the disorder. The treatment recommendations giv-
en in this article are based on guidelines, meta-analyses, 
and systematic reviews of randomized controlled studies. 
Anxiety  disorders  should  be  treated  with  psychological 
therapy,  pharmacotherapy,  or  a  combination  of  both. 
Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  can  be  regarded  as  the 
psychotherapy with the highest level of evidence. First-
line  drugs  are  the  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibi-
tors  and  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors. 
Benzodiazepines are not recommended for routine use. 
Other treatment options include pregabalin, tricyclic an-
tidepressants,  buspirone,  moclobemide,  and  others.  Af-
ter remission, medications should be continued for 6 to 
12 months. When developing a treatment plan, efficacy, 
adverse effects, interactions, costs, and the preference of 
the patient should be considered.

ders tend to run a chronic course, with symptoms fluc-
tuating  in  severity  between  periods  of  relapse  and  re-
mission in GAD and PDA9 and a more chronic course 
in SAD. After the age of 50, a marked decrease in the 
prevalence  of  anxiety  disorders  has  been  observed  in 
epidemiological  studies.8,10-12  GAD  is  the  only  anxiety 
disorder that is still common in people aged 50 years or 
more. 
  The  current  conceptualization  of  the  etiology  of 
anxiety  disorders  includes  an  interaction  of  psychoso-
cial  factors,  eg,  childhood  adversity,  stress,  or  trauma, 
and  a  genetic  vulnerability,  which  manifests  in  neuro-
biological  and  neuropsychological  dysfunctions.  The 
evidence for potential biomarkers for anxiety disorders 
in the fields of neuroimaging, genetics, neurochemistry, 
neurophysiology, and neurocognition has been summa-
rized in two recent consensus papers.13,14 Despite com-
prehensive, high-quality neurobiological research in the 
field  of  anxiety  disorders,  these  reviews  indicate  that 
specific biomarkers for anxiety disorders have yet to be 
identified. Thus, it is difficult to give recommendations 
for  specific  biomarkers  (eg,  genetic  polymorphisms) 
that  could  help  identify  persons  at  risk  for  an  anxiety 
disorder. 
  Obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  and  post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were formerly includ-
ed in the anxiety disorders, but have now been placed in 
other chapters in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-5). There-
fore, OCD and PTSD are not discussed in this review. 

Diagnosis

A short description of the anxiety disorders is given in 
Table I. Anxiety disorders are often underdiagnosed in 
primary care.15

In DSM-5, the group of anxiety disorders has been 
expanded to include separation anxiety disorder, a di-
agnosis  the  previous  DSM  version  reserved  for  chil-
dren only.16,17 The change was based on the findings of 
epidemiological studies that revealed the unexpectedly 
high prevalence of the condition in adults.18 DSM-5 also 
introduces  selective  mutism—the  failure  of  children 
to  speak  in  special  social  situations—and  a  new  term 
called illness anxiety disorder, defined by excessive pre-
occupation and fear of having a serious medical illness. 
Illness anxiety disorder was formerly called hypochon-
driasis  in  DSM-IV  and  Tenth  Revision  of  the  Interna-

tional  Statistical  Classification  of  Diseases  and  Related 
Health  Problems  (ICD-10);  in  DSM-5,  it  is  not  classi-
fied under anxiety disorders but belongs to the Somatic 
Symptom  and  Related  Disorders  category.  In  the  cur-
rent ICD-11 Beta Draft,19 hypochondriasis is placed in 
the group Obsessive-Compulsive or Related Disorders. 
It is characterized by catastrophic misinterpretation of 
bodily  symptoms  and  is  manifest  as  obsessive  and  ex-
cessive  health-related  behaviors. The  fear  of  having  a 
serious  medical  condition  persists  despite  thorough 
medical  evaluation  and  repeated  reassurance  that  the 
patient does not suffer from the feared illness.
  Mixed  anxiety  and  depression  is  a  category  listed 
only in ICD-10 and not in DSM-5. It is often diagnosed 
in  primary  care.  Research  on  the  treatment  of  this 
disorder  is  limited.20 Adjustment  disorder  with  mixed 
anxiety  and  depressed  mood  (F43.22)  is  a  condition 
with similar symptomatology. It occurs as a reaction to 
stressful life events. 
  The  differential  diagnosis  of  anxiety  disorders  in-
cludes  common  mental  disorders,  such  as  other  anxi-
ety disorders, major depression, and somatic symptom 
disorders, as well as physical illnesses such as coronary 
heart or lung diseases, hyperthyroidism, and others. 
  Anxiety disorders often co-occur with other anxiety 
disorders,  major  depression,  somatic  symptom  disor-
ders, personality disorders, and substance abuse disor-
ders.21 For example, major depression was found to be 
highly  correlated  with  all  anxiety  disorders  in  a  large 
European  survey  (eg,  with  GAD,  the  odds  ratio  was 
33.7; with panic disorder, it was 29.4).22 Anxiety disor-
ders  were  also  strongly  interrelated:  GAD  was  highly 
associated  with  agoraphobia  (25.7),  panic  disorder 
(20.3), and SAD (13.5). 
  To determine the severity of anxiety disorders and 
to  monitor  treatment  progress,  commonly  used  rating 
scales  can  be  used,  including  the  Hamilton  Anxiety 
Scale (HAM-A)23 for GAD, the Panic and Agorapho-
bia  Scale  (PAS)24  for  panic  disorder/agoraphobia,  and 
the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)25 for SAD. 

Treatment

Box 1 contains a case vignette of the treatment of a pa-
tient with GAD.

In clinical settings, most patients seeking help suffer 
from GAD, PDA, and SAD.7 Not all anxiety disorders 
have to be treated when symptoms are mild, transient,

and  without  associated  impairment  in  social  and  oc-
cupational  function.  However,  treatment  is  indicated 
when  a  patient  shows  marked  distress  or  suffers  from 
complications resulting from the disorder (eg, second-
ary depression, suicidal ideation, or alcohol abuse). 
  Anxiety disorders can be treated mostly on an out-
patient  basis.  Indications  for  hospitalization  include 
suicidality, unresponsiveness to standard treatments, or 
relevant  comorbidity,  eg,  with  major  depression,  per-
sonality disorders, or substance abuse. 
  The  treatment  recommendations  in  this  article  are 
based on guidelines for anxiety disorders.26-28 For such 
guidelines,  a  systematic  literature  search  for  random-
ized  clinical  trials  was  performed.  Studies  were  ana-
lyzed  by  using  internationally  acknowledged  quality 
assessment  tools,  and  the  recommendations  were  re-
viewed by expert panels. 
  Patients  with  different  anxiety  disorders  show  dif-
ferent  degrees  of  health  care  utilization.  For  example, 
in the United States, 54.4% of patients with PDA, but 
only 27.3% of patients with specific phobias, contacted 
health care services in 1 year.29 Whereas patients with 
PDA often fear that they suffer from a severe somatic 

disorder, such as a myocardial infarction, and that they 
need immediate medical help, people with simple pho-
bias often have the feeling that they can cope with the 
disorder or even think it is “normal” to have a fear of 
spiders or dogs. 
  There  is  evidence  for  substantial  undertreatment 
of  anxiety  disorders.  In  a  large  European  study,  only 
20.6% of participants with an anxiety disorder sought 
professional help. Of those participants who contacted 
health care services, 23.2% received no treatment at all, 
19.6%  received  only  psychological  treatment,  30.8% 
received only drug treatment, and 26.5% were treated 
both with drugs and psychotherapy.30 Likewise, a Dutch 
study in primary care found that only 27% of patients 
with  anxiety  disorders  received  guideline-orientated 
care.31
  Patients  should  receive  “psychoeducation”  about 
their  diagnosis,  the  possible  etiology,  and  the  mecha-
nisms of action of the available treatment approaches. 
The treatment plan should include psychotherapy, phar-
macotherapy, and other interventions, which should be 
chosen after careful consideration of individual factors, 
eg,  the  patient’s  preference,  the  patient’s  history  with 

Alice,  a  48-year-old  female  dentist,  presented  to  a  psychiatrist  with  a  7-month  history  of  anxiety  symptoms, 
which included persistent feelings of restlessness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbance, fatigue, 
nausea, diarrhea, muscle cramps, and the sensation of having a lump in her throat. She was suffering from con-
stant worry that her husband could become ill or might have an accident while driving to work. Her symptoms 
resulted in frequent absenteeism, which caused significant problems at work. Her medical history was unre-
markable. The psychiatrist diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder, DSM-5 F41.1. 
Four weeks previously, Alice had been prescribed the benzodiazepine diazepam by her general practitioner, and 
initially took it as prescribed. Although it helped with her anxiety, she felt that it made her feel dull and worried 
that it would interfere with her work as a dentist. She kept thinking that she would become addicted to the drug 
and stopped the intake. 
The psychiatrist started treatment with the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Because 
the patient was sensitive to side effects, the drug was started with 37.5 mg/d for 3 days. Then, the dose was in-
creased to 75 mg/d. She reported mild nausea and fatigue; however, it was not clear whether this was due to the 
medication or to the illness. 
After another two weeks, these adverse effects resolved, and the dose was increased to 225 mg/d. The patient 
also received weekly sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy. Symptoms of GAD were resolved almost com-
pletely after 7 weeks. The psychiatrist advised Alice to continue on venlafaxine for at least 6 months. Then, the 
drug was slowly tapered, by reducing the dose to 150 mg/d for 1 month, then to 75 mg/d for another month. 
Then, after 2 weeks on 37.5 mg/d, the medication was stopped. The patient did not report relevant withdrawal 
symptoms and did no show reoccurrence of significant anxiety symptoms during a follow-up observation period 
of almost 1 year.

Panic Disorder F41.0

Panic Disorder 300.01 
(F41.0)

Anxiety attacks of sudden onset, with physical manifestations of anxiety (eg, 
palpitations, sweating, tremor, dry mouth, dyspnea, feeling  of choking; chest 
pain; abdominal discomfort; feeling of unreality, paresthesia, etc). Panic at-
tacks can arise out of the blue; however, many patients start to avoid situa-
tions in which they fear that panic attacks might occur.

Generalized anxiety dis-
order F41.1

Social Phobia F40.1

Agoraphobia 300.22 
(F40.00)

Fear of places where it might be difficult or embarrassing to escape if a panic 
attack should occur (crowds, on public transport, or in closed spaces, eg, el-
evators). Fear of being alone is also common. 

Generalized Anxi-
ety Disorder 300.02 
(F41.1)

Social Anxiety Disor-
der (Social Phobia) 
300.23 (F40.10)

Patients suffer from somatic anxiety symptoms (tremor, palpitations, dizzi-
ness,  nausea, muscle tension, etc.) and from psychic symptoms, including 
concentrating, nervousness, insomnia, and constant worry, eg, that they  (or a 
relative) might have an accident or become ill. 

Patients are afraid of situations in which they are the center of attention and 
may be criticized—eg, public speaking, visits to authorities, conversations 
with superiors on the job, or with persons of the opposite sex. They are afraid 
of appearing clumsy, embarrassing themselves, or being judged negatively.

Specific (Isolated) Pho-
bias F40.2

Specific Phobia 300.29  Phobias which are restricted to singular, circumscribed situations, often relat-
ed to animals (eg, cats, spiders, or insects), or other natural phenomena (eg, 
blood, heights, deep water). 

Mixed Anxiety and De-
pressive Disorder
F41.2

-

Simultaneous presence of anxiety and depression, with neither predominat-
ing. However, neither component is sufficiently severe to justify a diagnosis of 
anxiety or depression in itself. If the diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depres-
sion (or both) are fulfilled, then the corresponding diagnosis should be made, 
rather than mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.

Separation Anxiety 
Disorder of Childhood 
(F93.0)

Separation Anxiety 
Disorder 309.21 
(F93.0)

Inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those 
to whom the individual is attached. In ICD-10, the disorder can only be diag-
nosed in children.

Selective Mutism (F94.0)

Selective Mutism 
312.23 (F94.0)

Consistent failure to speak in social situations in which there is an expectation 
to speak (eg, school) even though the individual speaks in other situations.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective 
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors

Due to their positive benefit/risk balance, selective se-
rotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective sero-
tonin  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors  (SNRIs  are 
recommended as first-line drugs. Patients should be in-
formed that the onset of the anxiolytic effect of these 
antidepressants has a latency of 2 to 4 weeks (in some 

cases up to 6 weeks). During the first 2 weeks, adverse 
effects may be stronger. Initial jitteriness or an increase 
in anxiety symptoms may occur, which may reduce the 
patients’  treatment  compliance.  Lowering  the  starting 
dose of the antidepressants may reduce these adverse 
effects. A  review  of  studies  in  depressed  patients  sug-
gested that SNRIs may be less well tolerated than the 
SSRIs.34 However, according to clinical experience, tol-
erability may differ among patients, and it is also pos-

sible that an individual patient may experience less ad-
verse effects when switched from an SSRI to an SNRI.
Some SSRIs and SNRIs are inhibitors of cytochrome 
P450 enzymes and hence may interact with other psy-
chopharmacological drugs and medications for medical 
illnesses.35 After stopping treatment with an SSRI, with-
drawal reactions may occur. However, these are much 
less frequent and severe than the withdrawal reactions 
observed  after  terminating  benzodiazepine  treatment. 
These  adverse  reactions  may  be  more  frequent  with 
paroxetine than with sertraline or fluoxetine.36 

Pregabalin

Pregabalin is a calcium modulator, acting at the α2δ sub-
unit of voltage-gated calcium channels. The drug has se-
dating  properties.  Sleep  disorders,  which  are  common 
in patients with anxiety disorders, may improve earlier 
with pregabalin than with the SSRIs or SNRIs. Onset of 
efficacy is earlier with pregabalin than with antidepres-
sants.  Pregabalin  is  not  subject  to  hepatic  metabolism 
and  hence  does  not  interact  with  inhibitors  or  induc-
ers of cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, there have 
been  concerns  about  the  abuse  of  pregabalin  in  indi-
viduals  suffering  from  substance  abuse  and  also  with-
drawal syndromes after abrupt discontinuation.37 

Tricyclic antidepressants 

The  traditional  tricyclic  antidepressants  (TCAs)  imip-
ramine  and  clomipramine  are  as  effective  as  second-
generation antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety 
disorders. In general, the frequency of adverse events is 
higher for TCAs than for SSRIs or SNRIs. Thus, these 
drugs  should  be  tried  first  before TCAs  are  used. The 
dosage should be uptitrated slowly until dosage levels 
reach those used in the treatment of depression. TCAs 
should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  considered  to 
be at risk of suicide, due to their potential fatal toxicity 
after overdose.38

Buspirone

Buspirone,  a  5-hydroxytryptamine  receptor  1A  (5-
HT1A) agonist, has been shown in some controlled stud-
ies to be effective in the treatment of GAD. However, 
not all studies have shown superiority to placebo and/or 
equivalence to standard drugs.

Benzodiazepines

The anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines begin soon 
after oral or parenteral application. In contrast to an-
tidepressants, benzodiazepines do not lead to initial-
ly  increased  jitteriness  and  insomnia.  In  the  United 
States, 55% to 94% of patients with anxiety disorders 
are  treated  with  benzodiazepines.39  Likewise,  Euro-
pean  studies  have  shown  a  high  rate  of  long-term 
benzodiazepine  use.40  However,  benzodiazepine 
treatment  may  be  associated  with  central  nervous 
system  (CNS)  depression,  resulting  in  fatigue,  dizzi-
ness, increased reaction time, impaired driving skills, 
and  other  adverse  effects.  Cognitive  functions  may 
be  impaired,  mainly  in  elderly  patients.  After  long-
term treatment with benzodiazepines (eg, over 4 to 8 
months), dependency may occur in some patients,41-47 
especially  in  patients  predisposed  for  substance 
abuse.48  Tolerance  (resulting  in  a  patient’s  constant 
desire to increase the dose) seems to be rare.49 Thus, 
the  risks  and  benefits  should  be  carefully  consid-
ered before treatment with benzodiazepine. Current 
guidelines  do  not  recommend  benzodiazepines  as 
first-line  treatments.50 The  recommendations  to  give 
preference to newer antidepressants are not based on 
direct  comparison  studies  but  rather  on  the  known 
risks of benzodiazepines.51 

In  exceptional  cases  (eg,  severe  cardiac  disease, 
contraindications for the standard drugs, suicidality, 
and other conditions), benzodiazepines can be used 
for a limited time period. However, patients with a 
history of benzodiazepine or other substance abuse 
should  be  excluded  from  treatment.  Benzodiaze-
pines may also be used in combination with SSRIs/
SNRIs during the first weeks before the onset of ef-
ficacy of the antidepressants.52 Cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) may facilitate benzodiazepine with-
drawal.53,54 

In  singular  cases,  acute  panic  attacks  may  require 
immediate  drug  treatment.  In  that  case,  lorazepam 
melting tablets at a dose of 1.0 to 2.5 mg may be given 
as  needed  (up  to  a  dose  no  higher  than  7.5  mg/d).  It 
is usually sufficient to talk calmly with the patient and 
explain that the attack is not due to a life-threatening 
medical condition. 

In contrast to SSRIs and SNRIs, benzodiazepines do 
not treat depression, which is a common comorbid con-
dition in anxiety disorders.

Moclobemide

Moclobemide is a selective and reversible inhibitor of 
monoamine  oxidase A.  It  is  used  in  the  treatment  of 
SAD. Because not all studies have shown evidence for 
superiority to placebo, the drug is not recommended as 
first-line treatment.

Other drugs

Some  other  drugs  have  shown  efficacy  in  anxiety  dis-
orders  in  randomized  controlled  studies  but  are  not 
licensed  for  the  treatment  of  these  disorders  in  most 
countries.  Medicolegal  issues  have  to  be  considered 
whenever drugs that have not been approved for anxi-
ety indications are prescribed off label.

Agomelatine

The  antidepressant  agomelatine—which  acts  as  an  ag-
onist  for  melatonin  MT1  and  MT2  receptors  and  as  an 
antagonist  for  serotonin  5-HT2C  receptors—was  shown 
to be effective in four studies in GAD.55-58 However, the 
drug is only licensed for the treatment of major depres-
sion,  not  for  GAD.  With  agomelatine,  discontinuation 
symptoms59,60 and sexual dysfunction61 are less likely than 
with SSRI or SNRI antidepressants. Elevations of hepat-
ic enzymes occur in around 1% of treated patients.62

Quetiapine 

The  atypical  antipsychotic  quetiapine  was  shown  to  be 
effective  in  a  number  of  studies  in  GAD.  It  is  usually 
prescribed  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenic  psychoses 
in dosages between 150 and 800 mg/d. For the treatment 
of anxiety, lower doses (50 to 300 mg/day) are required. 
However,  probably  due  to  adverse  effects  such  as  the 
metabolic syndrome, the drug was not licensed for anxi-
ety disorders in most countries. In general, typical adverse 
events, such as sedation or weight gain, were less frequent 
in patients receiving lower doses.63,64 Quetiapine can only 
be used off-label in treatment-refractory patients. The on-
set of efficacy is earlier than with antidepressants. 

Vortioxetine 

A new antidepressant, vortioxetine, was investigated in 
several controlled studies in GAD. However, according 

to a meta-analysis, significant improvement for vortiox-
etine  could  not  be  demonstrated  compared  with  pla-

Some  controlled  studies  have  shown  the  efficacy  of 
an  orally  taken  lavender  oil  preparation  in  GAD  and 
mixed  anxiety/depression.66-69  It  has  yet  to  be  estab-
lished  whether  lavender  oil  is  as  effective  as  standard 
treatments. The comparison studies only used low doses 
of  the  comparators,  eg,  20  mg  paroxetine  per  day66  or 
one  tablet  of  lorazepam  0.5  mg  per  day,69  which  may 
have led to insufficient efficacy of the comparison drugs. 
Studies with Kava-kava (Piper methysticum) showed 
inconsistent results,70-72 and the extract was been with-
drawn from the market in some countries due to hepa-
totoxicity  in  some  preparations.  Valerian  extract  was 
not  effective  in  placebo-controlled  studies  in  anxious 
patients.70,73  Also,  St  John’s  wort  was  not  effective  in 
SAD.74

Some  other  phytotherapeutics  have  been  investi-
gated in individuals with anxiety conditions. Due to the 
low quality of these studies, the evidence for the inves-
tigated products is not sufficient (for a review, see Sar-
ris  et  al75).  Standardization  may  be  an  issue  in  herbal 
preparations. For example, it was shown that different 
preparations  of  St.  John’s  wort  exhibited  large  differ-
ences in the content of the putatively effective ingredi-
ents.76

Relative efficacy of drugs

In a meta-analysis of all available drug studies in anxi-
ety disorders,77 the pre-post effect sizes of the different 
drugs were determined. We simply looked at the abso-
lute difference in anxiety scale scores before and after 
treatment, without regard to the relative efficacy com-
pared with placebo. This approach makes it possible to 
include hundreds of studies in comparisons of differen-
tial efficacy of all available drugs and not only the few 
direct  head-to-head  comparisons.  From  the  patients’ 
point of view, the improvement in anxiety symptoms as 
measured by the change from baseline to end point is 
more relevant than the difference from a control group. 
  The  available  medications  for  anxiety  disorders 
showed  considerably  large  differences  in  pre-post  ef-
fect sizes. For example, the improvement achieved with 

99

the most efficacious drug (quetiapine; Cohen’s d=3.39) 
was  almost  three  times  higher  than  what  was  accom-
plished with the drug with the weakest efficacy (buspi-
rone; d=1.35). Quetiapine, however, is not licensed for 
the treatment of any anxiety disorder in most countries. 
Among  the  drugs  showing  high  effect  sizes  and  that 
are  licensed  for  anxiety  disorders  and  recommended 
by  guidelines  were  the  SSRIs  escitalopram  (d=2.75) 
and  paroxetine  (d=2.42),  and  the  SNRIs  venlafaxine 
(d=2.32)  and  pregabalin  (2.30).  Also,  some  benzodi-
azepines, eg, diazepam (d=2.46) and lorazepam (2.44), 
showed high effect sizes. However, these drugs are not 
recommended for routine treatment.

General treatment principles

Patients  must  be  informed  about  possible  adverse  ef-
fects,  interactions,  safety  warnings,  and  contraindica-
tions,  as  indicated  in  the  current  summary  of  product 
characteristics. If patients are educated about the pos-
sibility that some early side effects might later decrease 
in  intensity,  compliance  may  improve.  Patients  with 
anxiety disorders are often hesitant to take psychotro-
pic drugs because they are afraid of adverse effects. In 
particular,  patients  with  PDA  may  easily  discontinue 
antidepressants  because  of  initial  jitteriness  and  ner-
vousness. 
  Doses  for  drug  treatments  are  shown  in  Table  II. 
In around 75% of the cases, doses in the lower part of 
the therapeutic range are sufficient. In patients with se-
vere  hepatic  impairment,  a  dosage  adjustment  or  use 
of medications that are cleared primarily by the kidney 
(eg, pregabalin) may be required. 
  For  all  drugs  recommended  in  this  article,  relapse-
prevention studies in at least one anxiety disorder have 
been conducted in patients who have responded to pre-
vious open treatment with a certain drug and were then 
randomized to placebo or ongoing blind treatment with 
the same drug for periods of between 6 and 18 months. 
All  of  these  studies  showed  a  significant  advantage 
for staying on active medication when compared with 
switching to placebo. Based on the findings from these 
relapse  prevention  studies  and  clinical  experiences, 
drug  treatment  should  be  continued  for  12  months  or 
more  after  remission  has  occurred.  Given  the  chronic 
course of anxiety disorders, it is regrettable that there 
are almost no controlled studies that investigate treat-
ment periods over 12 months. To avoid withdrawal syn-

dromes,  the  dose  should  be  slowly  tapered  off  over  a 
period of 2 weeks at treatment termination. 

It  is  a  common  opinion  that  patients  treated  with 
drugs  show  immediate  relapse  after  stopping  medica-
tion, whereas gains of psychological therapies are main-
tained for months or years after treatment termination. 
This  would  offer  psychological  therapies  considerable 
advantage  over  drug  treatment.  However,  in  natural-
istic  studies  following  up  anxiety  patients,  substantial 
relapse  rates  were  also  found  years  after  CBT  treat-
ment. For example, in an analysis of eight randomized 
controlled trials on CBT for anxiety disorders, 48% of 
patients  were  still  symptomatic  after  2  to  14  years  of 
follow-up.78  On  the  other  hand,  in  relapse  prevention 
studies  in  which  treatment  responders  to  open  drug 
treatment  for  8  to  12  weeks  were  re-randomized  to 
long-term  treatment  (24  to  52  months)  with  the  same 
drug  or  to  placebo,  only  around  40%  of  patients  ran-
domized to placebo relapsed.79-83 

Drug-drug interactions

When  treating  anxiety  disorders  with  medications, 
drug  interactions  have  to  be  monitored.35  SSRIs,  such 
as  fluoxetine,  fluvoxamine,  and  paroxetine,  are  partic-
ularly  liable  to  be  involved  in  pharmacokinetic  inter-
actions,  such  as  enzyme  inhibition  in  the  cytochrome 
P450 system. Additive CNS depression may occur when 
drugs with sedating properties are combined, eg, TCAs, 
benzodiazepines,  or  pregabalin,  resulting  in  unwanted 
sedation,  drowsiness,  or  increased  reaction  time.  Ad-
ditive  effects  at  the  neurotransmitter  level  can  occur 
when medications are combined that have antagonistic 
effects on the same receptors, eg, two drugs with anti-
cholinergic effects. 

Unresponsiveness to standard treatments

Before considering a patient to be treatment unrespon-
sive, it should be ascertained that the diagnosis was cor-
rect, adherence to the treatment plan was sufficient, the 
dose  prescribed  had  covered  the  full  range,  and  there 
had been a trial period of adequate duration. When pa-
tients report previous treatment failures, it often turns 
out that a drug was only prescribed in the lowest dose 
or was stopped within the first 2 weeks due to side ef-
fects  that  occurred  in  the  initial  phase  before  the  pa-
tient could experience improvement.

Concurrent drugs may interfere with efficacy, eg, meta-
bolic inhibitors or enhancers. Psychosocial factors may 
affect response, and comorbid personality or substance 
abuse disorders are especially likely to complicate anxi-
ety disorders. When initial treatment fails, the physician 
has to decide when to change the treatment plan. There 
have been few systematic trials of treatment-refractory 
patients  with  anxiety  disorders.  If  after  treatment  at 
what is considered an adequate dose for 4 to 6 weeks 
a patient shows no response, the medication should be 
changed.  One  analysis  showed  that  the  chance  of  re-
sponding beyond the fourth week was 20% or less if no 
effect had occurred by the second week of treatment,84 
suggesting an even earlier switching of drugs. Although 
“switching studies” are lacking, many treatment-refrac-
tory patients are reported to respond when a different 
class  of  antidepressant  is  tried  (eg,  change  from  one 

SSRI to another SSRI, or to an SNRI, or vice versa). If 
partial response is seen after this period, there is still a 
chance that the patient will respond after another 4 to 6 
weeks of therapy with increased dosages. For some an-
tidepressants, the studies on a potential dose-response 
relationship  are  inconclusive,  perhaps  due  to  the  lack 
of  statistical  power  for  showing  a  difference  between 
lower  and  higher  doses.  According  to  clinical  experi-
ence, however, a trial with a higher dose in patients with 
insufficient response is warranted. 
  Elderly patients may take longer to show a response. 
Table III contains options in case of drug inefficacy or 
intolerance.  In  patients  who  are  unresponsive  to  psy-
chotropic  drugs,  the  addition  of  CBT  is  generally  rec-
ommended.85 
  A  combination  of  antidepressants  and  benzodiaz-
epines is sometimes used in treatment-refractory cases.

When all standard treatments have failed, the off-label 
use of drugs may be considered, for example, drugs li-
censed for another anxiety disorder or that are not li-
censed but have shown efficacy in clinical studies. Such 
drugs include quetiapine and agomelatine. 

Treatment of GAD in older patients

With the exception of GAD, anxiety disorders are less 
common  in  patients  over  65  years  of  age.  Therefore, 
only a few studies for the treatment of GAD have been 
performed with older patients. Controlled studies have 
shown the efficacy of duloxetine, venlafaxine, pregaba-
lin, and quetiapine in patients over 65 years old.27 In the 
elderly, an increased sensitivity to drug side effects and 
interactions  must  be  considered,  including  anticholin-
ergic  effects,  risk  of  orthostatic  hypotension  and  car-
diovascular events, risk of falling, and paradoxical reac-
tions to benzodiazepines. 

In the elderly, effect sizes for CBT tend to be some-
what  smaller  than  those  found  in  mixed-age  popula-
tions.86 A meta-analysis of studies with older adults with 
GAD showed superiority of CBT to waitlist or “treat-
ment-as-usual” conditions but not to active controls (eg, 
psychological or pill placebos).87

Treating children and adolescents

Whereas  specific  phobias,  SAD,  and  separation  anxi-
ety disorder are common in younger people, PDA and 
GAD are relatively rare. There are some randomized, 
placebo-controlled  studies  of  pharmacotherapy  for 
anxiety  disorders  in  children  and  adolescents  show-
ing  efficacy  of  sertraline,  fluoxetine,  and  duloxetine  in 
young  patients  with  GAD,  of  venlafaxine  and  parox-
etine in SAD, and of sertraline, fluvoxamine, and fluox-
etine in mixed samples, including patients with separa-
tion anxiety disorder, GAD, and SAD.88 However, little 
is known about the value of long-term treatment.89 The 
combination  of  CBT  and  sertraline  was  found  to  be 
more effective than both treatment modalities alone.90 
  There  had  been  concerns  about  increased  risk  for 
suicidal ideation (not suicides) in children and adoles-
cents treated for major depression with SSRIs (escitalo-
pram, citalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline), mirtazap-
ine, and venlafaxine.91 According to a meta-analysis, the 
risk:benefit ratio in the treatment of depressed children 
and  adolescents  seemed  to  be  most  favorable  with 

fluoxetine.92 Although suicidal ideation is less common 
in anxiety disorders than in major depression, the risks 
of pharmacological treatment have to be weighed care-
fully against the risks of nontreatment. It was reported 
that antidepressant prescriptions for children and ado-
lescents decreased substantially after European and US 
regulatory  agencies  issued  warnings  about  a  possible 
suicide risk with antidepressant use in pediatric patients 
in 2003/200493 and that these decreases were associated 
with  increases  in  suicide  rates  in  children  and  adoles-
cents (although a causal relationship is not proven).94
  For children and youths with separation anxiety dis-
order,  several  treatment  studies  exist.95  However,  no 
controlled studies on the treatment of adults with this 
disorder could be traced. 
  There is also a paucity of treatment studies for chil-
dren  with  selective  mutism.  Small  studies  have  shown 
that psychotherapeutic approaches were at least better 
than waitlist controls.96,97 One review indicated that only 
two very small placebo-controlled drug studies showed 
efficacy of the SSRIs fluoxetine and sertraline. 98 

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

For pregnant women, the risk of an untreated anxiety 
disorder must be weighed against the risk of damage to 
the unborn child as a result of treatment. A large study 
suggested  no  substantial  increase  in  the  risk  of  car-
diac  malformations  attributable  to  antidepressant  use 
during  the  first  trimester.99  However,  antidepressants 
have been associated with increased risk of spontane-
ous  abortions,  stillbirths,  early  deliveries,  respiratory 
distress,  and  endocrine  and  metabolic  dysfunctions.100 
Nevertheless, the current evidence suggests that the use 
of many antidepressants, especially the SSRIs, is favor-
able compared with exposing the mother to the risks of 
untreated depression or anxiety disorders.101 
  Likewise,  a  careful  assessment  of  the  risk/benefit 
balance has to be done when a mother is breastfeeding. 
In such cases, CBT should be considered as an alterna-
tive to medication treatment.

Psychotherapy

All  patients  with  anxiety  disorders  require  supportive 
talks and attention to the emotional problems that are 
associated  with  the  anxiety  disorder.  Psychoeduca-
tion  includes  information  about  the  physiology  of  the 

102

bodily symptoms of anxiety reactions and the rationale 
of available treatment possibilities. Many patients may 
require  formal  psychological  treatment  interventions, 
which are mostly done on an outpatient basis. 
  The  treatment  of  anxiety  disorders  by  CBT  is  de-
scribed  in  more  detail  in  the  article  by  Borza    in  this 
issue  of  Dialogues  in  Clinical  Neuroscience  (p  203).  
The efficacy of CBT for all anxiety disorders has been 
shown in a large number of controlled studies. If avoid-
ance of feared situations is a relevant factor in phobic 
disorders,  exposure  techniques  should  be  included  in 
the treatment schedule, in which patients are confront-
ed with their feared situations. 

In comparison with CBT, the evidence for psychody-
namic therapy is weaker.50 Controlled studies with psy-
chodynamic  therapy  were  markedly  fewer  in  number, 
and  of  lower  quality,  than  those  with  CBT,  and  some 
comparison studies have shown superiority of CBT. 
  For specific phobias, there are only studies with be-
havioral therapy, which should be performed as expo-
sure treatment. In the available treatment studies, it was 
shown  that  only  a  few  sessions  (eg,  one  to  five)  were 
necessary for effective treatment of specific phobias. 

In  recent  years,  many  studies  have  investigated 
psychological therapies that are performed via the In-
ternet, usually involving minimal or no contact with a 
therapist. However, at present, evidence is lacking that 
these treatments are as effective as individual CBT with 
face-to-face contact.77 Internet therapies may be an op-
tion  for  regions  in  which  psychotherapy  is  not  widely 
available or to bridge the waiting period before a “real” 
therapy is scheduled to begin. They are also less expen-
sive  than  face-to-face  psychotherapies.  However,  im-
portant issues have to be solved, including reimburse-
ment by health insurance systems, data protection, the 
problem of “remote diagnosis” without direct contact, 
assessment  of  suicidality,  and  medicolegal  aspects. 
Treatments  with  a “virtual  reality”  setting  (eg,  Gilroy 
et al102) may be a promising new approach for specific 
phobias.

Combining psychotherapy and medication

Both  psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy  have  been 
shown to be more effective than control groups. How-
ever, whereas drugs are mostly compared with placebo 
controls,  the  evidence  for  psychotherapy  in  anxiety 
disorders is mainly based on comparisons with a “wait-

list,”  a  control  method  that  was  used  in  70%  to  75% 
of the studies in adults and children.77,103,104 Because pill 
placebos have higher effect sizes than waitlist controls, 
the  effect  size  differences  between  active  and  control 
conditions  cannot  be  compared  between  psychother-
apy  and  medication  studies.  Therefore,  our  research 
group conducted a large meta-analysis of all available 
controlled short-term studies for anxiety disorders and 
compared  the  pre-post  effect  size  differences  (before 
and after treatment) between medications and psycho-
therapies.77  In  this  meta-analysis,  which  was  based  on 
studies with around 35 000 patients, medications were 
associated with a significantly higher average pre-post 
effect  size  (Cohen’s  d=2.02)  than  psychotherapies 
(d=1.22; P<0.0001). It was also found that patients in-
cluded  in  psychotherapy  studies  were  less  severely  ill 
than those recruited for medication trials.
  Moreover,  it  was  shown  that  the  average  pre-post 
effect sizes for pill placebos were of similar strength to 
the gains achieved with psychotherapies. This surprising 
finding cannot be explained by heterogeneity, publica-
tion  bias,  or  by  allegiance  effects.  However,  this  does 
not mean that psychotherapy is not helpful, as the av-
erage effect size obtained with psychotherapies is still 
strong—it only means that a placebo pill is a very pow-
erful  treatment,  at  least  for  the  first  weeks  or  months 
of treatment. Nevertheless, patients should be informed 
about the relative efficacy of the treatment options they 
are offered. 
  The meta-analysis also showed that combinations of 
psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy  had  a  relatively 
high  effect  size  (d=2.12).  However,  only  a  few  combi-
nation studies were available for this comparison, and 
some of these have not been conducted with the most 
powerful drugs.

Other treatment options

Exercise (eg, aerobic training, such as jogging 5 km three 
times  a  week)  has  been  studied  in  PDA.  However,  it 
was found that exercise was less effective than clomip-
ramine105 and no more effective than a control condition, 
relaxation.106 Thus, exercise can only be recommended as 
adjunctive treatment to standard treatments. 
  Hypnosis,  autogenic  training,  and  biofeedback  or 
complementary medicine methods such as acupuncture, 
osteopathy, or homeopathy are often recommended for 
the  treatment  of  clinical  anxiety.  However,  controlled 

103

studies fulfilling at least basic methodological standards 
are lacking.
  Although  controlled  studies  on  the  usefulness  of 
self-help groups are lacking, patients should be encour-
aged to participate if appropriate. 

from randomized controlled trials permits the formula-
tion of robust evidence-based recommendations for the 
treatment of GAD, PDA, and SAD. In most cases, drug 
treatment and CBT may substantially improve quality 
of life in GAD patients. o

Conclusions

GAD and other anxiety disorders are the most preva-
lent mental disorders. A large amount of data available

Tratamiento de los trastornos de ansiedad

Traitement des troubles anxieux

Los trastornos de ansiedad (trastorno de ansiedad gene-
ralizada,  trastorno  de  pánico/agorafobia,  trastorno  de 
ansiedad social y otros) son los trastornos psiquiátricos 
más  prevalentes  y  están  asociados  con  una  alta  carga 
de  enfermedad.  En  la  atención  primaria  los  trastornos 
de ansiedad tienen a menudo un bajo reconocimiento y 
son subtratados. La terapia se indica cuando un pacien-
te muestra un marcado distrés causado por el trastorno 
o  sufre  por  complicaciones  debidas  a  él.  Las  recomen-
daciones terapéuticas que se entregan en este artículo 
están  basadas  en  guías  clínicas,  estudios  de  meta-aná-
lisis, revisiones sistemáticas y estudios controlados ran-
domizados.  Los  trastornos  de  ansiedad  deben  ser  tra-
tados  con  terapia  psicológica,  farmacoterapia  y/o  una 
combinación de ambas. La terapia cognitivo conductual 
puede ser considerada la psicoterapia con el mayor nivel 
de evidencia. Los fármacos de primera línea son los inhi-
bidores selectivos de la recaptura de serotonina y los in-
hibidores de la recaptura de serotonina/noradrenalina. 
No se recomiendan las benzodiacepinas para un empleo 
rutinario.  Otras  opciones  terapéuticas  incluyen  prega-
balina, antidepresivos tricíclicos, buspirona, moclobemi-
de  y  otros.  Después  de  la  remisión,  los  medicamentos 
deben  continuarse  por  unos  6  a  12  meses.  Cuando  se 
desarrolla un plan terapéutico se debe considerar la efi-
cacia, los efectos adversos, las interacciones, los costos y 
la preferencia del paciente.    

Les  troubles  anxieux  (anxiété  généralisée,  trouble  pa-
nique/agoraphobie,  anxiété  sociale  et  autres)  sont  les 
troubles psychiatriques les plus prévalents et ils s’asso-
cient à une morbidité importante. Les troubles anxieux 
sont  souvent  peu  reconnus  et  peu  traités  en  soins  pri-
maires.  Le  traitement  est  indiqué  quand  ces  troubles 
causent  une  détresse  manifeste  chez  le  patient  ou 
lorsqu’il  souffre  de  complications.  Les  conseils  de  trai-
tement  donnés  dans  cet  article  sont  basés  sur  des  re-
commandations,  des  métaanalyses  et  des  revues  systé-
matiques d’études contrôlées randomisées. Les troubles 
anxieux doivent être soignés par un traitement psycho-
logique,  une  pharmacothérapie,  ou  une  association 
des  deux.  Le  traitement  cognitivo-comportemental  est 
considéré  comme  la  psychothérapie  ayant  niveau  de 
preuve le plus élevé. Les inhibiteurs sélectifs de la recap-
ture de la sérotonine et les inhibiteurs de la recapture 
de la sérotonine et de la noradrénaline sont les médi-
caments  de  première  ligne.  Les  benzodiazépines  ne 
sont pas recommandées en routine. La prégabaline, les 
antidépresseurs  tricycliques,  la  buspirone,  le  moclobé-
mide et d’autres sont d’autres traitements possibles. Les 
médicaments doivent être poursuivis 6 à 12 mois après 
la  rémission.  Lors  de  l’élaboration  d’un  plan  de  traite-
ment, il faut tenir compte de l’efficacité, des effets indé-
sirables, du coût et de la préférence du patient.
