Abstract
Stimulant medication is effective in alleviating overall symptom severity of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
yet interindividual variability in treatment response and tolerability still exists. While network analysis has identified dif-
ferences in ADHD symptom relations, the impact of stimulant medication remains unexplored. Increased understanding of 
this association could provide valuable insights for optimizing treatment approaches for individuals with ADHD. In this 
study,  we  compared  and  characterized ADHD  symptom  networks  (including  18 ADHD  symptoms)  between  stimulant-
treated  (n = 348)  and  untreated  (n = 70)  individuals  with  ADHD  and  non-ADHD  controls  (NACs;  n = 444).  Moreover, 
we  compared  symptom  networks  between  subgroups  defined  by  their  stimulant  treatment  trajectory  (early-and-intense 
use, late-and-moderate use). Stimulant-treated individuals with ADHD showed stronger associations between symptoms, 
compared with untreated individuals with ADHD and NACs. We found no differences in symptom networks between the 
stimulant treatment trajectory subgroups. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to disentangle whether the identified 
differences stem from treatment or pre-existing factors.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  a  het-
erogeneous  neurodevelopmental  disorder1,  characterized 
by  age-inappropriate  levels  of  inattention,  hyperactivity 
and/or  impulsivity  that  interfere  with  typical  development 
or functioning [3–5]. Stimulant medication, such as meth-
ylphenidate-  and  dexamphetamine-based  formulations,  is 
commonly  prescribed  to  children,  adolescents,  and  adults 
with ADHD  [6,  7],  and  has  been  widely  reported  to  alle-
viate  overall ADHD  symptom  severity  [8–12].  While  this 
approach  provides  valuable  information  about  the  global 
burden  of ADHD  symptoms  and  the  efficacy  of  stimulant 
medication  in  reducing  overall  symptom  severity,  it  may 
overlook important nuances in the underlying dynamics of 
the disorder. The network theory of psychopathology offers 
a promising framework to address this limitation by shifting 
the  focus  from  symptom  counts  to  exploring  the  intricate 
interactions  and  dependencies  between  individual  symp-
toms  [13].  Network  analysis  may  be  used  to  gain  deeper 
understanding  of  the  unique  associations  between  symp-
toms, and which (clusters of) symptoms may potentially be 
targeted in treatment of ADHD. Interestingly, thus far medi-
cation use has not been taken into account when investigat-
ing the relations between individual symptoms.

Studies  using  symptom  network  analysis  have  reported 
developmental patterns and specific symptoms that play an 
important role in ADHD symptom networks. For instance, 
symptom network analysis in children with ADHD revealed 
that  hyperactive-impulsive  symptoms  had  greater  relative 
importance compared with inattentive symptoms [14]. In a 
different study, both hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive 
symptoms were identified as central to symptom networks 
across three time points in a longitudinal sample of children 
and young adolescents with ADHD [15]. Symptoms that are 
central to the network are strongly connected to other symp-
toms and may influence, or be influenced by, the expression 
of  these  other  symptoms.  It  has  therefore  been  suggested 
that central symptoms have potential to predict clinical out-
come [15], and may be viable treatment targets in ADHD 
[16].

1   Please note that neuropsychiatric models consider ADHD to be a 
disorder. However, there is a growing acknowledgement of ADHD as 
part of neurodiversity; conceptualising ADHD as an extreme manifes-
tation of naturally existing neurodivergent ways of being, thinking and 
acting [1, 2].

However, the effects of treatment itself on symptom net-
work properties in ADHD remain unexplored. It is essential 
to increase our understanding of how the relations between 
symptoms differ between individuals with ADHD that use 
stimulant  medication,  compared  with  those  that  do  not, 
as  this  may  provide  new  leads  for  optimizing  treatment 
approaches  and  improving  outcomes  for  individuals  with 
ADHD.

Therefore,  the  present  study  aimed  to  investigate  how 
exposure  to  stimulant  medication  relates  to ADHD  symp-
tom  networks,  evaluating  the  strength  of  associations  and 
(local) network structure in stimulant-treated and untreated 
individuals  with  ADHD,  as  well  as  non-ADHD  controls 
(NACs). We  expected  that  effective  treatment  will  lead  to 
alterations  in  the  relations  between  symptoms,  potentially 
disrupting pathological connections and establishing health-
ier patterns. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to stimu-
lant treatment would be associated with a symptom network 
that is more similar to the network in NACs, compared with 
untreated individuals with ADHD.

Methods

Participants and measurements

Sample

The data used in this study were collected as part of the pro-
spective NeuroIMAGE project [17], a Dutch follow-up study 
of the International Multicenter ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) 
project  [18–20].  The  first  wave  of  this  two-site  follow-up 
study  (Radboud  University  Medical  Centre,  Nijmegen; 
Vrije  Universiteit  Amsterdam),  conducted  between  2009 
and  2012,  aimed  to  identify  genetic,  neurobiological  and 
environmental causes underlying ADHD and its course dur-
ing development. The total NeuroIMAGE sample consisted 
of 1085 Caucasian participants aged 7–29 years old. Written 
informed  consent  was  obtained  from  all  participants  aged 
12 years and older. Parents also provided written informed 
consent for participants under 18. The NeuroIMAGE study 
was approved by the medical ethical committees of the VU 
University Medical Centre and Radboud University Medi-
cal Centre (NL23894.091.08 [17]).

ADHD diagnosis was established based on outcomes of 
a semi-structured interview with parents (Kiddie – Sched-
ule  for  Affective  Disorders  and  Schizophrenia  Present 
and  Lifetime  Version,  K-SADS-PL  [21]),  complemented 
by  scores  on  Conners’  Rating  Scales  filled  out  by  several 
informants (Teacher’s: CTRS, self-rated: CAARS [22, 23]). 
This  approach  was  chosen  to  ensure  robust  categorization 
into ADHD and NAC groups, considering that a diagnostic 

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2025) 34:1917–19291 3interview with a clinician may in some cases underestimate 
ADHD symptomatology due to social-desirability bias. To 
be diagnosed with ADHD, participants were required to have 
a  minimum  of  6  symptoms  of  either  inattention  or  hyper-
activity/impulsivity  (or  5  for  participants ≥ 18  years),  that 
arose before the age of 12, were present in ≥ 2 settings and 
led to impairment. Participants were categorized as NAC if 
they had ≤ 3 symptoms (or ≤ 2 for participants ≥ 18 years). 
The following exclusion criteria applied for both the ADHD 
and  NAC  groups:  an  IQ < 70,  a  diagnosis  of  autism,  epi-
lepsy, general learning difficulties, brain disorders or known 
genetic disorders (see [17] for a more detailed description 
of diagnostic and inclusion/exclusion procedures). Partici-
pants  who  neither  met  the  criteria  for  the ADHD  nor  for 
the NAC group were classified as ‘subthreshold ADHD’ and 
were excluded from the current analyses.

Medication use

Medication  history  data  were  obtained  from  pharmacy 
records and a semi-structured interview to reconstruct life-
time history of stimulant medication use. Pharmacy records 
were  used  to  encode  medication  history,  unless  unavail-
able, in which case the semi-structured interview was used 
to reconstruct lifetime history of stimulant medication use. 
Those ADHD participants that never received ADHD psy-
chostimulants were categorized as ADHD-nostim, whereas 
ADHD participants with exposure to ADHD psychostimu-
lants were categorized as ADHD-stim.

ADHD symptoms and comorbidities

The  validated  parent-rated  Conners’  Rating  Scales  (CPRS 
R:  L  [24])  was  used  for  symptom  network  analysis,  as 
CPRS  data  was  not  used  to  establish ADHD  diagnosis  or 
determine NAC status. The CPRS consists of 80 behavioral 
statements, of which 18 describing ADHD  symptoms that 
reflect ADHD symptoms in the DSM-IV. The 18 items used 
for symptom network estimation are shown in Table 1. Par-
ents were instructed to indicate how often their child exhib-
its  each  of  the  behaviors  listed  on  a  4-point  Likert  scale 
(0 = never,  1 = occasionally,  2 = often,  3 = very  often).  For 
those participants that were using stimulant medication, the 
parents were asked to rate the CPRS based on their child’s 
behavior as it would be without medication use. History of 
comorbid  disorders  was  assessed  using  the  K-SADS-PL 
[21].

Data analysis

All analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.5) using the 
packages mgm (version 1.2–14 [25]), qgraph (version 1.9.2 
[26]), ggplot2 (version 3.4.0), and mice (version 3.14 [27]). 
For creation of the stimulant treatment trajectory groups, R 
version 4.1.2 and Matlab (version R2016a) were used. For 
descriptive  analyses,  a  significance  level  of  α = 0.05  was 
applied.

Since symptom network analysis does not allow for miss-
ing data, missing CPRS items for participants with incom-
plete CPRS  data were imputed using multiple imputation.

Symptom network construction

To  assess  the  association  of  stimulant  medication  with 
ADHD symptom interrelations, we compared symptom net-
works between NACs, ADHD-nostim and ADHD-stim par-
ticipants using moderated network models. In this approach, 
a symptom network is estimated across all participants and a 
categorical moderator variable is included in the network to 
evaluate the networks for each moderator group [28]. More-
over, we performed additional network analyses as sensitiv-
ity analyses (see Sect. “Sensitivity analyses”).

We estimated mixed graphical models (MGMs) to evalu-
ate  the  networks  of ADHD  symptoms.  In  these  networks, 
the nodes represent the 18 ADHD symptom scores assessed 
using the CPRS and the edges represent statistical associa-
tions  between  pairs  of  symptoms  while  controlling  for  all 
other variables in the network (i.e., conditional dependence 
relationships  [29,  30]).  Given  our  relatively  low  sample 
size compared to the number of included variables, we used 
LASSO  regularization  with  the  Extended  Bayesian  Infor-
mation Criterion (EBIC) to remove spurious edges (γ = 0.5 
[31, 32]). We included edges using the OR-rule and assessed 
the  stability  of  the  estimated  moderation  parameters  by 
performing  non-parametric  block  bootstrapping  analysis 
(n = 500  bootstrap  samples).  Moderation  effects  that  were 
present in 50–80% (moderate stability) or ≥ 80% (good sta-
bility) of the bootstrap samples were considered to have suf-
ficient stability for interpretation.

Local network properties

To  characterize  the  role  of  particular  symptoms  in  the 
ADHD  symptom  networks,  we  computed  two  local  met-
rics describing local network properties: node strength and 
a  local  clustering  coefficient. These  metrics  were  selected 
as they take edge weights into account [33, 34] and allow 
for two different ways to evaluate network properties. Node 
strength  reflects  the  sum  of  the  absolute  weights  of  the 
edges connected to a node [35], whereas the local clustering 
coefficient reflects the proportion of edges present between 
a node’s neighbors in relation to all possible edges (calcula-
tion adapted for weighted networks, as developed by [36]). 
Finally, we compared local network properties of the NAC, 
ADHD-nostim  and ADHD-stim  groups  by  assessing  how 
strongly correlated the local network metrics (node strength 
and local clustering coefficients) were between groups.

We  visualized  the  networks  conditioned  on  the  moderator 
groups,  using  the  Fruchterman-Reingold  algorithm,  such 
that more strongly associated nodes are plotted more closely 
together  [37].  To  facilitate  the  comparison  across  groups, 
we  fixed  the  layout  and  maximum  edge  weight  across  all 
visualizations. Edge thickness corresponded to the strength 
of associations between symptoms, with thicker edges rep-
resenting stronger associations.

Sensitivity analyses

Additional symptom network analyses

The main analysis considered the NAC, ADHD-nostim and 
ADHD-stim groups as completely separate groups, and did 
not consider that all participants in the ADHD-nostim and 
ADHD-stim groups had an ADHD diagnosis. To investigate 
a  potential  association  of  ADHD  diagnosis  with  ADHD 
symptom  interrelations,  we  conducted  an  additional  net-
work analysis comparing the NAC and total ADHD groups.
We  conducted  several  sensitivity  analyses  in  our  study. 
First,  we  included  age  (continuous)  and  sex  (0:  female; 
1:  male)  in  the  network  model  to  account  for  their  poten-
tial  impact  on  the  associations  between  ADHD  symp-
toms, given the known sex differences and developmental 
changes in ADHD type [38, 39]. Additionally, we included 
study  site  (Amsterdam,  Nijmegen)  in  the  network  model 
to  account  for  its  potential  influence  on  the  associations 
between ADHD  symptoms.  Furthermore,  we  repeated  the 
main  analysis  including  only  participants  with  complete 
CPRS data (complete cases).

Finally,  we  conducted  an  additional  network  analysis 
comparing  subgroups  defined  by  their  stimulant  treatment 
trajectory (groups defined by the community detection algo-
rithm described in Sect. “Stimulant treatment trajectories”).

Stimulant treatment trajectories

Considering  medication  use  trajectories  in  ADHD  are 
highly heterogeneous, the ADHD group was further divided 
into subgroups defined by their stimulant treatment trajec-
tory using a community detection algorithm, as previously 
described [40, 41]. The algorithm classifies participants by 
maximizing similarities within groups as well as differences 
between  groups,  until  separation  of  subgroups  no  longer 
improves with further iterations. The modularity (Q) reflects 
the separation of subgroups, with Q = 0 indicating no sub-
groups  and  Q = 1  indicating  perfect  segregation  between 
subgroups.  Lifetime  stimulant  trajectories  (mg  per  day) 
were constructed for each participant from date of birth to 

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2025) 34:1917–19291 3date of questionnaire assessment, and averaged per month. 
We extracted age of medication treatment onset, stop age, 
and  total  dose  from  the  raw  treatment  trajectories.  Treat-
ment duration, maximum daily dose, and variability (SD) of 
the dose were estimated from a generalized additive model 
(GAM  [42,  43])  fitted  to  the  raw  trajectories.  Next,  these 
variables were entered into a Louvain community detection 
algorithm [44], in order to categorize participants into mutu-
ally exclusive communities (stimulant treatment trajectory 
subgroups).

Results

Participant characteristics

From the original sample (n = 1085), 494 participants were 
classified as NAC, and 432 as ADHD participants. A total 
of  864  participants  (472  NAC,  392 ADHD)  had  complete 
CPRS  data,  and  24  participants  had > 50%  (1  NAC,  1 
ADHD) or completely missing (11 NAC, 11 ADHD) CPRS 
data.  For  38  participants  with  incomplete  CPRS  data  (10 

1921

NAC, 28 ADHD; ≤4 missing items), missing CPRS scores 
were  imputed  using  multiple  imputation. Additionally,  25 
participants  (23  NAC,  2  ADHD)  with  incomplete  stimu-
lant  medication  history  data  and  NACs  with  exposure  to 
stimulant medication (n = 15) were excluded from analysis, 
resulting in a final sample of 862 participants (444 NAC, 70 
ADHD-nostim, 348 ADHD-stim).

Table 2 shows the demographic information for the NAC 
and  total  ADHD  groups,  and  separately  for  the  ADHD-
nostim  and  ADHD-stim  groups.  The  ADHD-stim  group 
had  higher  median ADHD  sum  scores  compared  with  the 
ADHD-nostim group. Furthermore, the total ADHD group 
had  a  lower  proportion  of  females  compared  with  NACs, 
and  the  ADHD-stim  group  had  a  lower  proportion  of 
females compared with the ADHD-nostim group. In addi-
tion,  the  total ADHD  group  showed  higher  prevalence  of 
comorbid  disorders  compared  with  the  NACs.  However, 
the ADHD-nostim and ADHD-stim groups did not differ in 
terms of comorbid disorders, suggesting that comorbid dis-
orders were more common among participants with ADHD, 
regardless of the specific treatment they received. The dura-
tion of stimulant medication use in the ADHD-stim group

Symptom network analysis

Association of stimulant medication with ADHD symptom 
networks

Symptom  networks  of  the  NAC,  ADHD-nostim  and 
ADHD-stim networks are visualized in Fig. 1A-C. For all 
networks,  all  edges  were  positive,  indicating  positive  par-
tial correlations between symptoms. Network analysis com-
paring NACs, ADHD-nostim and ADHD-stim participants 
revealed 12 moderation effects, of which 11 had sufficient 
stability for interpretation (4 good stability, 7 moderate sta-
bility; Fig. 1D; Table 3). Most of the identified stable mod-
eration  effects  were  on  edges  with  hyperactive-impulsive 
symptoms,  with  7  moderation  effects  on  edges  between 
hyperactive-impulsive  symptoms,  3  moderation  effects 
on  edges  between  hyperactive-impulsive  and  inattentive 
symptoms, and one moderation effect on an edge between 
inattentive  symptoms.  Post  hoc  evaluation  revealed  that 
the strength of associations between symptoms was higher 
in  the ADHD-stim  network  compared  with  the  NAC  and 
ADHD-nostim networks (Table 3), and that the moderated 
edges  did  not  differ  between  the  NAC  and ADHD-nostim 
groups.  In  other  words,  the  identified  moderation  effects 
reflected differences between the ADHD-stim group and the 
other two groups.

Regarding local network properties (Fig. 2), mean ± stan-
dard deviation of the node strength was 0.81 ± 0.15 in the 
ADHD-stim  network  and  0.75 ± 0.16  in  the  NAC  and 
ADHD-nostim  networks.  Furthermore,  the  mean ± stan-
dard  deviation  of  the  local  clustering  coefficients  was 
0.061 ± 0.016 in the ADHD-stim network and 0.057 ± 0.015 
in  the  NAC  and ADHD-nostim  networks.  Note  that  since 
the NAC and ADHD-nostim networks did not differ, their 
local  network  properties  also  did  not  differ.  The  Pearson 
correlation coefficient between the local network properties 
of  the  ADHD-stim  and  NAC/ADHD-nostim  groups  was 
0.88  for  node  strength  and  0.93  for  local  clustering  coef-
ficients. This suggests that all groups were similar in (local) 
network structure.

Sensitivity analyses

Additional  symptom  network  analyses  Network  analysis 
comparing  the  NAC  and  total ADHD  groups  revealed  15 
moderation  effects,  however  stability  analyses  indicated 
that  none  of  the  moderation  effects  had  sufficient  stability 
for  reliable  interpretation  of  the  moderated  edges  (Online 

Resource 1). This supports the findings of the main analysis 
that the identified moderation effects reflected differences in 
symptom networks between the ADHD-stim group and the 
other two groups. The sensitivity analyses with age, sex, and 
study site included in the network model yielded all mod-
eration effects identified in the main analysis, as well as two 
additional stable moderation effects involving age and sex 
(Online Resource 2 and 3). Network analysis with complete 
cases only revealed 13 moderation effects, of which 11 were 
overlapping  with  the  moderation  effects  identified  in  the 
main analysis (Online Resource 3). Of note, the two addi-
tional  non-overlapping  moderation  effects  identified  when 
including complete cases only, had insufficient stability for 
reliable interpretation.

Stimulant  medication  use  trajectories  The  community 
detection  algorithm  yielded  three  subgroups  (Q = 0.59) 
reflecting  stimulant  treatment  trajectories  (similar  to  [40, 
41]): early-and-intense use (n = 153, 52%), late-and-moder-
ate use (n = 140, 47%), and early-and-moderate use (n = 4, 
1%). Due to insufficient sample size, the early-and-moderate 
group was excluded from analysis. Compared with the late-
and-moderate group, the early-and-intense group was char-
acterized by earlier medication treatment onset, higher total 
and  maximum  dose,  higher  variability  of  the  dose,  longer 
treatment  duration,  and  earlier  stop  age  (Online  Resource 
4–6). Network analysis comparing the early-and-intense and 
late-and-moderate subgroups revealed 2 moderation effects, 
however stability analysis indicated that neither moderation 
effects  had  sufficient  stability  for  reliable  interpretation  of 
the moderated edges (Online Resource 7).

Discussion

The  present  study  aimed  to  investigate  the  association  of 
stimulant  medication  with  ADHD  symptom  networks. 
We  identified  multiple  moderation  effects,  mostly  involv-
ing  hyperactive-impulsive  symptoms,  suggesting  stronger 
associations between symptoms in stimulant-treated ADHD 
participants  compared  with  untreated  ADHD  participants 
and NACs. This partially aligns with previous findings that 
hyperactive-impulsive symptoms had higher relative impor-
tance in symptom networks of ADHD participants [14]. In 
addition,  local  network  properties  were  highly  correlated 
across  groups,  suggesting  that  the  identified  differences 
are related to strength of symptom associations rather than 
(local) network structure. Findings were robust when taking 
into  account  age,  sex  and  study  site,  and  when  including 
complete cases only. Moreover, we found no differences in

represent the associations between symptoms while controlling for all 
other variables in the network and edge thickness represents correla-
tion  strength.  In  all  three  networks,  all  associations  between  symp-
toms  were  positive. All  moderation  effects  were  positive,  indicating 
stronger associations between symptoms in the ADHD-stim network 
compared with the NAC and ADHD-nostim networks. The maximum 
edge weight was 0.29 for the NAC, ADHD-nostim and ADHD-stim 
networks, and 0.09 for the network of moderated edges

symptom  networks  between  the  different  stimulant  treat-
ment trajectory subgroups.

In  contrast  to  our  hypothesis,  our  findings  provide  no 
evidence  for  differences  in  symptom  networks  between 
stimulant  treatment-naive  participants  with  ADHD  and 
NACs, and suggest that exposure to stimulant medication in 
the ADHD group was associated with stronger connections 

between symptoms. An explanation for our findings may be 
that untreated individuals with ADHD constitute a distinct 
subpopulation  that  presents  with  lower  ADHD  symptom 
severity and a symptom network similar to NACs, as sub-
stantiated by our findings of lower ADHD symptom severity 
in  the  ADHD-nostim  group  compared  with  the  ADHD-
stim  group.  Consequently,  this  particular  subpopulation

of  untreated  individuals  with  ADHD  may  be  less  reliant 
on  pharmacotherapy.  Longitudinal  studies  (in  medication-
naive participants) are required to disentangle whether the 
identified differences in symptom interrelations are a result 
of  stimulant  treatment  or  due  to  pre-existing  differences 
between  stimulant-treated  and  untreated  individuals  with 
ADHD. In the absence of such studies in ADHD, we propose 
two  explanations  for  our  findings  based  on  studies  inves-
tigating  treatment  effects  on  symptom  networks  in  related 
fields.  First,  the  heightened  interconnectedness  observed 
among  hyperactive-impulsive  symptoms  may  arise  as  a 
consequence of stimulant treatment. Previous studies have 
reported  that  symptom  networks  undergo  changes  follow-
ing (psychological and/or medication) treatment in various 
neuropsychiatric  populations  [45–47].  Although  different 
treatments  may  affect  symptom  networks  differently  [48], 
it is conceivable that stimulant medication may exert influ-
ence on specific associations between ADHD symptoms. A 
second, alternative explanation could be that the heightened 
interconnectedness  observed  in  the  symptom  networks  of 
stimulant-treated individuals with ADHD predates the ini-
tiation  of  stimulant  treatment,  implying  that  individuals 
with  a  more  connected  network  of  symptoms  were  more 
likely  to  be  prescribed  stimulants  in  the  first  place  and/or 
are more responsive to stimulant treatment. In other words, 
the presence of a highly interconnected symptom network 
may  correlate  with  greater  impairment  [30],  subsequently 
prompting the administration of stimulant medication.

The findings of the present study provide a first insight 
into  the  association  between  stimulant  medication  and 

symptom  networks  in  ADHD.  This  is  of  great  signifi-
cance,  considering  the  widespread  use  of  stimulants  in 
the  treatment  of  ADHD,  as  well  as  substantial  interindi-
vidual  variability  in  treatment  response  and  tolerability  of 
this  medication  [11,  49].  Currently,  there  is  a  scarcity  of 
research exploring the causal effects of treatment on symp-
tom networks in general (see [50] for a systematic review 
of network analysis in intervention studies), making further 
exploration  of  this  matter  crucial  to  enhance  our  under-
standing of the adaptability of symptom networks, specifi-
cally whether they reflect enduring traits or transient states. 
Notably,  studies  conducted  in  individuals  with  depression 
and schizophrenia found that treatment response was asso-
ciated with the strength of associations between symptoms 
as  well  as  symptom  network  changes  compared  with  pre-
treatment  [45,  46].  Hence,  future  studies  should  focus  on 
longitudinal  evaluation  of  stimulant  medication  effects  on 
ADHD symptom networks and discerning how these effects 
correspond to clinical outcomes. Furthermore, an outstand-
ing question remains how symptom interrelations in ADHD 
relate  to  functional  brain  measures.  Previous  research 
focused  mainly  on  connectivity  at  either  a  symptom  level 
[14–16, 38, 51–54] or at a neural level [55–58]. Future stud-
ies  will  move  towards  an  integrated  network  approach  as 
previously proposed [59] to investigate the complex brain-
behavior relationship in ADHD, as well as the influence of 
stimulant treatment thereon.

The findings of this study should be interpreted in light 
of some methodological considerations. First, the untreated 
ADHD  group  and  the  stimulant  treatment  trajectory

subgroups had limited sample sizes, resulting in lower sta-
bility of the estimated symptom networks [60]. Nonetheless, 
robustness  of  our  results  was  evaluated  using  sensitivity 
analyses,  which  revealed  that  the  identified  differences  in 
the  networks  across  groups  were  stable,  and  provided  no 
evidence  for  network  differences  between  participants 
with ADHD  and  NACs.  Future  research  should  make  use 
of pooled datasets to benefit from larger sample sizes and 
explore  potential  ADHD  subpopulations.  Moreover,  self-
report and parent-report ratings of ADHD symptoms have 
previously  been  found  to  differ  substantially  [38,  61], 
although there is no conclusive evidence favoring the accu-
racy of self-report or parent-report ratings in adults [62, 63]. 
For reporter consistency and because the self-report CAARS 
was  used  for  allocation  into ADHD  and  NAC  groups,  we 
considered use of CPRS data for symptom network estima-
tion most suitable. Still, given the subjective nature of the 
CPRS  ratings,  parents  of  stimulant-treated ADHD  partici-
pants  may  vary  in  their  interpretations  of  the  instructions. 
They might assess their child’s behavior based on different 
timeframes  –  off-medication days,  pre-treatment behavior, 
or a combination of both. This highlights the need for clear 
guidelines and detailed reporting on rating criteria in stud-
ies examining treatment impacts on behavior. Furthermore, 
ADHD symptom severity and presence of comorbid disor-
ders differed across groups, although stimulant-treated and 
untreated participants with ADHD did not differ in terms of 
comorbid  disorders. A  previous  found  that  the  inattentive 
and  hyperactive-impulsive  symptom  domains  in  ADHD 
were associated with other cognitive and comorbid factors 
[64],  and  the  existing  literature  presents  mixed  findings 
regarding stimulant treatment response in ADHD in relation 
to co-occurring disorders [65–68]. This highlights the need 
for  further  exploration  of  the  relation  between  symptom 
interactions, cognitive functioning and comorbidities in the 
context of stimulant treatment for ADHD. In addition, this 
study’s  sample  consisted  of  Dutch  Caucasian  participants, 
limiting  the  generalizability  of  our  findings  to  the  world-
wide population. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that 
interpretation of our findings is limited by this study’s cross-
sectional design. To make inferences about intra-individual 
medication effects on ADHD symptom interactions, longi-
tudinal  designs  such  as  single-case  experimental  designs 
(SCEDs)  are  needed,  in  which  individuals  are  followed 
across time while they receive stimulant medication [69].

In  conclusion,  the  present  study  is  the  first  to  investi-
gate  the  association  of  stimulant  medication  with  ADHD 
symptom  interrelations.  Our  findings  suggest  that  stim-
ulant-treated  participants  with  ADHD  showed  stronger 
associations  between  symptoms  compared  with  stimulant 
treatment-naive ADHD participants and NACs, and that the 
identified differences in symptom networks were related to 

strength  of  symptom  associations,  rather  than  (local)  net-
work structure. Whether the identified differences in symp-
tom  networks  are  a  result  of  stimulant  treatment  or  due 
to  pre-existing  differences  between  stimulant-treated  and 
untreated  individuals  with  ADHD,  remains  to  be  investi-
gated. Future research should focus on longitudinal evalua-
tion of stimulant medication effects on symptom networks 
in ADHD, as well as on integration of symptom-brain net-
works  to  gain  insight  in  the  relation  between  the  neural 
underpinnings and symptom interrelations in ADHD.
