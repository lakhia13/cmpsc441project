Abstract: New research points to a possible link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the
gut microbiota as many autistic children have co-occurring gastrointestinal problems. This review
focuses on speciﬁc alterations of gut microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the
mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites,
or leaky gut in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in
the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain
fatty acids (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative gut-blood-barrier is
abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients,
triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier
and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected.
Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced gut microbiota (dysbiosis).
Although the cause-eﬀect relationship between ASD and gut microbiota is not yet well established, the
consumption of speciﬁc probiotics may represent a side-eﬀect free tool to re-establish gut homeostasis
and promote gut health. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of bacterial-derived compounds as
new possible biomarkers, associated with perturbation in the phenylalanine metabolism, as well as
potential therapeutic strategies will be discussed.

1. Introduction

The microbiota-gut-brain-axis describes the bidirectional physiological connection to exchange
information between the microbiota, the gut and the brain [1]. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the largest
surface in the body, meets trillions of microorganisms separated by the gut barrier [2]. The gut barrier is
made out of the commensal gut microbiota, a mucus layer and epithelial cells connected through tight
junctions [3,4]. A healthy microbial composition is important to health, as dysbiosis is often observed
in gut-related diseases and conditions such as inﬂammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
diabetes and obesity, but also in unconventional diseases such as acne, allergy, cardiovascular disease,
stress, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) [5–12]. Dysbiosis is an altered microbial composition favouring pathogenic microbes over
beneﬁcial ones in the gut. Knowing that dysbiosis at a young age aﬀects health-status during later life,
it is important to study the life-long impacts of compromised GI functions during childhood.

In addition to dysbiosis, GI symptoms are four times more prevalent in children with ASD
compared to the normal population [13]. A wide range of GI symptoms are found in these children,
such as constipation, diarrhoea, bloating, abdominal pain, reﬂux, vomiting, gaseousness, foul smelling
stools and food allergies [1,14–19]. In addition, lower bacterial diversity found in autistic children [20,21]

could be related to the severity of GI symptoms [20]. The higher abundance of Clostridia species (spp)
in autistic individuals suggests involvement in the pathogenesis of ASD [22]. Structural changes in the
brain [23–30] and less sociable behaviours [31–34] observed in germ-free mice indicate a functional
connection between the microbiota and the brain. However, as there are major diﬀerences between the
murine and the human microbiota [35], the validity of drawing conclusions from GF mice to humans is
limited. Nevertheless, the observed behavioural changes in germ-free mice raise the question regarding
the mechanisms of action of microbiota on human metabolism.

The frequently reported comorbidity of GI problems in autistic children [1,14–19] motivated
the central question of this review: is there a connection between the gut microbiota and the central
nervous system (CNS) aﬀecting the pathology of ASD? This is an important question considering that
only approximately one third of all autistic cases could be linked to genetic causes [36]. Furthermore,
no satisfactory eﬀective treatment is available for Autism Spectrum Disorder to date. Therefore,
understanding and modulating the microbiota-gut-brain-axis may be an eﬀective and promising
way for ameliorating the disease symptoms [37]. The objective of this review is to summarize all
peer-reviewed human studies and reviews on the topic connecting gut microbiota with ASD and
suggesting metabolites, which could serve as potential biomarkers after further validation. The elevation
of 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric
acid in autistic children hinted to perturbation in the phenylalanine metabolism [38]. These metabolites
are related to the abundance of Clostridia spp which worsens autistic behaviour [38].

2. Material and Methods

In this systematic review we concentrated on the question: Is there a connection between the
gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS) aﬀecting the pathology of ASD? PubMed
databank and online books were searched on February 1st 2018. The objective was to study the
possible connection between the microbiota/microbiome and ASD. The following search parameters
and MeSH terms “Microbiome”, “microbiota”, “gut-brain-axis”, “autism”, “autistic disorder” and
“human” delivered 139 hits (Figure 1).

3. Comorbidities in Autism Spectrum Disorder

3.1. Deﬁnition

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a collective term for autism, Asperger’s syndrome and
pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise speciﬁed [40]. More male than female individuals
are aﬀected by the disease [41,42]. The prevalence of ASD was one in ﬁfty-nine children in the
United States in 2014 [43,44]. Autistic behaviour is characterized by poor communication skills, social
withdrawal, repetitive or restrictive pattern in behaviour, interests and activities and the onset of these
diagnostic features in early developmental stage [45]. Other reported behaviour are picky eating
habits [16,24,46], increased aggression [47] and anxiety [48]. Regressive autism or late onset autism
describes a subgroup of patients with initially normal development but with a gradual loss of acquired
skills in communication or social interaction [40]. Asperger’s Syndrome manifests next to social
withdrawal with superior cognitive skills. The phenotypes of ASD are heterogeneous, suggesting that
many factors play into the aetiology [27]. Both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in
ASD but most cases of ASD are idiopathic [20]. Lastly, abnormal eating habits are frequently reported
in autistic individuals, possibly leading to deﬁciencies in vitamins, minerals and fatty acids [16].

3.2. Gastrointestinal Symptoms

Several comorbidities are frequently reported in ASD children (Figure 2). GI problems are often
observed in autistic individuals [1,14–19]. In a small sample size including ten autistic children,
nine non-autistic siblings and ten healthy children severity and number of GI symptoms were found
to be signiﬁcantly higher in autistic children and their siblings compared to healthy controls [49].
Accordingly, a diﬀerent bigger study comparing 230 pre-schoolers discovered similar results. ASD
patients were suﬀering signiﬁcantly more often from GI problems than healthy controls. ASD patients
with GI symptoms were found to have more anxiety problems and other somatic complaints in addition
to less social interaction in comparison to ASD patients without GI problems [14]. Constipation was
found to be the most common GI symptom observed in autistic children. The same authors also found a
connection between rigid-compulsive behaviour and the occurrence of constipation [13]. Additionally,
GI problems in autistic children were reported to lead to more tantrums, aggressive behaviour and
sleep disturbances, further worsening the behaviour compared to autistic individuals without GI
symptoms [15]. One review suggested that altered behaviour such as aggression, self-injury or sleep
disorder observed in autistic children might be an expression of abdominal discomfort [50].

Figure 2. Co-occurring pathologies found in Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD). Red shows gut-related
comorbidities found in ASD, purple shows brain-related comorbidities and orange other comorbidities.
Chapter 3 gives more information to the mentioned comorbidities.

Autistic children show an altered metabolism and absorption of disaccharides in their gut
epithelium (Figure 2) [20,51]. The disaccharidases in the brush border of the ileum such as lactase,
maltase glucoamylase and sucrose isomaltase, were found to have lower mRNA levels and hence a
decreased gene expression [52,53]. The sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) and the
glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) transport glucose, galactose and fructose actively across the luminal
and basolateral membranes of the enterocytes. Autistic children were reported to exhibit signiﬁcantly
decreased mRNA levels of both hexose transporters in the ileum [53]. Consequently, there is a
malabsorption in the small intestine and more mono- and disaccharides enter the large intestine.
Thus, bacteria fermenting these low-molecular sugars proﬁt and outcompete bacteria degrading
polysaccharides leading to an altered microbial composition in the GI tract. Higher amounts of sugars
in the large intestine could lead to osmotic diarrhoea or these sugars could serve as substrates for the
production of gases [53]. Diarrhoea and bloating are both GI symptoms observed in ASD patients.
GI symptoms in ASD patients are known to correlate with the severity of autistic behaviour [15].

3.3. Increased Gut Permeability

An increased intestinal permeability was observed in ASD patients (Figure 2) by measuring
lactulose in blood after oral administration [15]. Autistic children as well as their non-autistic siblings
were found to have increased gut permeability compared to controls [54]. Increased gut permeability
is probably a result of decreased expression of barrier forming proteins and the elevated expression of
pore forming proteins of tight junctions. These altered expressions were found by analysing mucosal
samples from the small intestine of autistic children compared to controls [55]. Changed permeability
could lead back to lower counts of Lactobacillus strains in autistic patients, as they are associated with

Red shows gut-related comorbidities found in ASD, purple shows brain-related comorbidities and orange other comorbidities. Chapter 3 gives more information to the mentioned comorbidities.3.3. Increased Gut Permeability An increased intestinal permeability was observedin ASD patients (Figure 2) by measuring lactulose in blood after oral administration [15]. Autistic children as well as their non-autistic siblings were found to have increased gut permeability compared to controls [54]. Increased gut permeability is probably a result of decreased expression of barrier forming proteins and the elevated expressionof pore forming proteins of tight junctions. These altered expressions were found by analysingmucosal samples from the small intestine of autistic children compared to controls [55]. Changed permeability could lead back to lower counts ofLactobacillus strains in autistic patients, as they are associated with the maintenance of tight junction in the epithelial barrier of the intestines [15]. Bacterial metabolites, such as LPS, caneasily pass the intestinal barrier and cause an inflammation affecting the brain through altering cytokine levels [1]. Increased intestinal permeability was alsofound in some close non-autistic relatives ofautistic individuals,suggesting that intestinal integrity is not a consequence of ASD. Rather, increased gut permeability should be viewed as a cause, which could in combination with other environmental factors, at least partially, lead to the pathology ofASD [56]. 3.4. Alterations in the Brain The analysis of post-mortem brains of autistic patients revealed altered expression of someclaudines (CLDN) in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) of the cortex and cerebellum. Significant changes were observed in the expression of the genes of CLDN-5 and CLDN-12. These two major constituents of tight junctions were overexpressed in the cortex and cerebellum of autistic children compared to controls (figure 2). CLDN-5 is an important protein in tight junctions for cell adhesion of endothelial Autism Spectrum DisorderGastrointestinal symptoms[1,14,15,16,17,18,19]Increased permeability of the epithelial barrier in the gut [15,54,55]Decreased expression of brushborder disacchari-dases in the gut epithelium [20,51,52,53]Altered microbial composition in the gut (see chapter 5.1.)Mitochondrial dysfunction[62]Fragile X Syndrome, Rett Syndrome and tuberous sclerosis [27]Altered metabolites profile in urine and blood (see chapter 5.2.1. and 5.2.2.)Increased amounts of activated microglial cells[27,57]Altered expression of tight junction proteins in the blood brain barrier [55]Int.

the maintenance of tight junction in the epithelial barrier of the intestines [15]. Bacterial metabolites,
such as LPS, can easily pass the intestinal barrier and cause an inﬂammation aﬀecting the brain through
altering cytokine levels [1]. Increased intestinal permeability was also found in some close non-autistic
relatives of autistic individuals, suggesting that intestinal integrity is not a consequence of ASD. Rather,
increased gut permeability should be viewed as a cause, which could in combination with other
environmental factors, at least partially, lead to the pathology of ASD [56].

3.4. Alterations in the Brain

The analysis of post-mortem brains of autistic patients revealed altered expression of some
claudines (CLDN) in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) of the cortex and cerebellum. Signiﬁcant changes
were observed in the expression of the genes of CLDN-5 and CLDN-12. These two major constituents
of tight junctions were overexpressed in the cortex and cerebellum of autistic children compared to
controls (Figure 2). CLDN-5 is an important protein in tight junctions for cell adhesion of endothelial
cells in the brain. However, the protein expression of CLDN-12 was signiﬁcantly reduced in the cortex
of autistic children even though the gene was overexpressed [55]. The over-expressions of the genes
are suggestive of either a higher integrity of the BBB in autistic children or a compensatory mechanism
to uphold the integrity of the BBB. The second explanation appears more plausible, as an increased
destruction of the protein CLDN-12 could lead to an over-expression of the CLDN-12 gene and other
tight junction components such as CLDN-5. These results suggest a lower integrity of the BBB leading
to a compensatory overexpression of tight junction components.

Increased activation of microglial cells and other structural changes have also been observed
post-mortem in the brains of autistic individuals (Figure 2) [27,57]. The increase in activation of
microglial cells suggests that ASD is a pathology caused or at least accompanied by immune activation
in the brain. Inﬂammation in the brain could subsequently lead to malfunctioning synapses [27].
During inﬂammation the brain releases arginine vasopressin, a metabolite, which is known to act on
social behaviour and is a considered biomarker for ASD [27]. A structural change was the increased
weight of ASD brains possibly due to the presence of a larger number of neurons in the prefrontal
cortex [57]. Moreover, Purkinje cells are found in decreased numbers in the cerebellum of ASD
patients [43,58]. Purkinje cells produce GABA, which makes them vulnerable to the tetanus neurotoxin
produced by Clostridia tetani [43]. Elevated amounts of Clostridia spp is reported in ASD, thus could
account for decreased Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of ASD individuals.

There is a bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain including among others vagal
ﬁbers [59]. Enteroendocrine cells in epithelial barrier of the gut can sense the composition of the lumen
such as nutrients and bacterial metabolites. These cells synapse with aﬀerent vagal ﬁbres, thus directly
connecting the intestinal milieu with the brainstem [60]. Peripheral stimulation of vagal ﬁbres leads to
a dopamine release in the reward system, as was shown in vivo [61].

3.5. Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Mitochondrial dysfunction was detected in ten ASD children (Figure 2) comparing intestinal
mucosa samples of rectum und caecum with that of ten Crohn’s disease children (representing
non-autistic children with GI symptoms) and ten healthy children [62]. ASD children displayed lower
activity of the electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme complex IV and citrate synthase in mucosal
samples taken both from rectum and caecum. In addition, they also showed signiﬁcantly higher
quantity of ETC complex I in the mucosa of the caecum. The quantities of the ETC enzyme belonging
to complexes III, IV and V were only signiﬁcantly increased in the caecum [62]. The occurrence of these
changes only in the caecum and not also in rectum is intriguing. Especially so, since the rectum acts as
a transition passage, whereas the caecum inhabits many bacteria species. The authors discuss their
ﬁnding stating that the altered expression of these enzymes, all involved in the energy production, leads
to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunctions disrupt normal functioning of enterocytes
and therefore cause gut-dysmotility and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress. Increased oxidative

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 2115

6 of 28

stress results in damaged proteins and lipids in the cell and consequently causes diminished function
of enterocytes. This suggests that bacterial metabolites may aﬀect mitochondrial function in the
caecum. SCFAs produced by Clostridia species spp could enter the mitochondria and be utilized as
substrates for energy production [62]. For example, butyrate is converted into acetyl-CoA, which
then is utilized in the citric cycle for NADH production. NADH, on the other hand, is a substrate
for ETC complex I, which could be the factor elevating its activity. Additionally, gut-dysmotility
caused by mitochondrial dysfunction would explain constipation observed in autistic individuals [62].
The occurrence of many GI problems observed in autistic children could partially be explained by
gut-dysmotility. Interestingly, GI problems similar to that of autistic children have also been noted
in children with mitochondrial dysfunction [62], again suggesting a link between mitochondrial
dysfunction, GI problems and microbiota in ASD individuals.

4. Factors Inﬂuencing the Gut Microbiota

4.1. Deﬁnitions and Facts

The term microbiota describes the entirety of all bacterial, archaeal and fungal microorganisms
living on the skin, in the mouth, in the respiratory, GI and vaginal tracts [37]. As the term microbiota
describes all microorganisms living in and on humans, the term microbiome describes all the genes
expressed in all these microorganisms [50]. The highest diversity of microbiota is found in the
large intestine [17]. Approximately 1000 diﬀerent spp of bacteria are reported to live in the GI
tract [63]. Healthy gut microbiota interacts with the human metabolism by educating the immune
system, protecting against pathogenic microbes, metabolising non-digestible carbohydrates, producing
essential vitamins and antimicrobial substances, stimulating angiogenesis and importantly reinforcing
the gut barrier through increased mucine production [15,40,64–67]. The microbial composition varies
through age, diet, diseases, geography [37,68] and shared environment [34].

4.2. Developmemt and Disruptions of Microbial Colonisation in Autism

Colonisation of the GI tract with microbiota starts prenatally as microorganisms have been
detected in the placenta and meconium [17,28,69,70]. Moreover, some bacterial species of Enterococcus,
Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were found in the blood of the umbilical cord. This suggests a transfer
of microbiota from the mother to the foetus [71]. A new-born shows an instable and highly dynamic
intestinal microbiota with less microbial diversity and a dominance of the phyla Proteobacteria in the gut.
With time, the diversity and colonisation increase and the dominance in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
can be observed. [72]. First colonisers of healthy new-borns are Enterobacteria, Staphylococcus and
Streptococcus spp, which are facultative anaerobes. These bacteria consume the oxygen in the gut and
create an anaerobic environment. Following these ﬁrst colonisations strict anaerobes as Bacteroides,
Biﬁdobacterium spp and Clostridium spp can colonise the gut [72]. The composition of the microbiota
stabilises around the age of 2–3 years [17,73]. Interestingly the brain of neonates also grows from 36% to
approximately 90% of its future adult volume until the age of two. Also, the formation of new synapses
in the brain peaks between the age of three months and two years [26]. Thus, the critical window for
establishment of a healthy microbial composition falls into the same critical time window for brain
development [26]. The developing brain is sensitive to many external and internal environmental
factors. Therefore, it is postulated that changes in prenatal maternal stress level, infections or diet can
play a role in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders [71,74].

Preterm birth, mode of delivery and breastfeeding inﬂuence the gut microbial composition of
neonates. Vaginally born babies who are breastfed have the healthiest composition of microbiota.
Beneﬁcial bacteria such as Biﬁdobacteria are more abundant in these babies than pathogenic bacteria
including Clostridium diﬃcile or Escherichia coli [75]. Human breast milk promotes the growth of
Biﬁdobacterium longum [69]. Vaginally born babies have a microbiota that resembles vaginal microbiota
composition of the mother with dominance of Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Snethia spp [76]. Neonates

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 2115

7 of 28

born via caesarean section have an altered microbiota composition resembling the microbiota of
the mother’s skin with dominance of Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium spp [76,77],
Escherichia coli and Clostridium diﬃcile [78]. Exclusively breastfed infants display also richness in
Biﬁdobacterium spp, which are specialised in digesting oligosaccharides contained in human milk [76].
A study found that autistic children experienced signiﬁcantly shorter period of breastfeeding [79].
Preterm born babies possess low levels of gastric acidity, as GI functions have not fully matured.
Consequently, more pathogenic microbes survive the stomach and can colonise the intestines leading
to an accumulation of pathogenic microbiota and diminished degree of microbiome diversity in
the GI tract [6]. They display dominance in Proteobacteria and lack in the genera Lactobacillus and
Biﬁdobacterium [73].

Using information from a population-based registry with approximately 2.6 million children,
a Swedish study noted that elective caesarean births in comparison to natural vaginal delivery is
associated with a signiﬁcantly 20% higher risk of the child developing ASD [80]. In contrast, no
association was found in the sibling control analysis, so the authors concluded that there was no link
between caesarean birth and ASD at all [80]. Similarly, another cohort study from the UK with over
18,000 participants also found no association found between caesarean birth and development of
ASD [81].

Antibiotic treatment during the ﬁrst three years of life can have detrimental eﬀect on normal
microbiota establishment with long-term eﬀects [82]. It is known that many autistic children take
relatively high doses of oral antibiotics in early years of life, which could be a factor disturbing
their gut microbiota [20]. Recovery of the microbiota to the pre-treatment state is incomplete even
several months after the cessation of the treatment [37]. Early treatment of infants with antibiotics can
therefore disrupt the colonisation of gut with beneﬁcial bacteria [73]. Changes in the composition of
the microbiota could lead to a leaky gut or increased passage of metabolites such as LPS or SCFAs
through intestinal barrier [1,83], leading to the activation of an inﬂammatory response through binding
to Toll-like receptor 4 also aﬀecting the CNS [1].

Maternal infection during pregnancy can lead to a modiﬁed microbial composition as well as
an increased risk of ASD. Women were found to have a higher risk of carrying out autistic children,
when they were hospitalised due to an infection during pregnancy. Interestingly, the risk for ASD was
higher when infection occurred during a critical time window of development. Viral infections in the
ﬁrst trimester of the pregnancy and bacterial infections in the second trimester were associated with
a higher risk of birthing autistic children [27]. These data are in agreement with results obtained in
maternal immune activated (MIA) mice. Pregnant mice were injected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic
acid (poly(I:C)) to simulate viral infections. The oﬀspring displayed altered microbial composition, GI
barrier defects and behaviour similar to autistic features [5]. Elevated levels of cytokines in maternal
blood were proposed to be the causing factor as poly(I:C) is also a cytokine [5]. Elevated levels of IL-6
were found in the colon from MIA mice [5]. The cytokine IL-6 is known to alter the expression of tight
junction proteins, as it is proinﬂammatory, thus helping white blood cells to migrate through epithelial
barriers [5]. Hence, the increased gut permeability in autistic children could be a consequence of
immune activation in the GI tract [84,85]. Bacteroides, Biﬁdobacterium spp and Lactobacillus spp
create an anti-inﬂammatory milieu, whereas Clostridium spp stimulate a pro-inﬂammatory milieu [86].
Cytokines produced by microbiota aﬀected the oligodendrocytes functioning [23]. Therefore, an
inﬂammation during pregnancy can result in alteration of myelination in the brain and possibly in
behavioural changes, as observed in ASD [23].

Taken together, a higher risk for developing ASD was observed in children (i) who were born
pre-term with a very low birth-weight [69], (ii) who were born by caesarean delivery, (iii) who were
not breastfed, (iv) who underwent prolonged hospitalization, (v) who were treated with antibiotics for
a long period [16] or (vi) whose mothers had an infection during pregnancy [27].

5. Alterations in Microbial Composition and Metabolic Proﬁle in Autistic Individuals

5.1. Changes in Microbial Composition in Autistic Children

A regularly observed phenomenon in the faeces of autistic children is a signiﬁcantly decreased
ratio between the phyla Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes [49,53,76,87], which pointed to elevated numbers
of Firmicutes in contrast to decreased levels of Bacteroidetes. Conflicting data were reported by
De Angelis et al., who found in a study with thirty subjects that Firmicutes counts were lower than
Bacteroidetes in autistic children when compared to healthy controls [40]. These results, however,
were not statistically significant [40]. Moreover, the phyla Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia were also
represented in lower concentrations (Figure 3) in the faeces of ten autistic children compared to ten healthy
controls [40]. Significantly elevated bacteria in autistic children were Akkermansia muciniphila, Anaerofilum,
Barnesiella intestinihominis, Clostridium spp, Dorea spp, the family Enterobacteriaceae, Faecalibacterium
spp (especially Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), Roseburia spp, Parasutterella excrementihominis, Prevotella copri,
Prevotella oris and Turicibacter spp. Escherichia coli was significantly decreased in autistic children [40].
Other higher represented spp were Aeromonas, Odirobacter splanchnicus, Parabacteroides, Porphyromonas,
Pseudomonas, and Turicibacter sanguinis. Significantly decreased bacteria in autistic children were
Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, Oscillospira, Sporobacter, Streptococcus and Subdoligranulum. Lower
represented genera in autistic children were Collinsella spp except Collinsella aerofaciens, Enterococcus
spp, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Staphylococcus [40]. Kang et al. compared the intestinal ﬂora of
twenty autistic children with GI problems to the intestinal ﬂora of twenty neurotypical children. They
found that the signiﬁcant lower bacterial diversity found in autistic children [20,21] correlates with
the severity of GI symptoms. No major diﬀerences were detected at phylum levels; however, this
discrepancy could be a result of the parents collecting and freezing the stool samples and not the
research team. Non-autistic children had a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of the genus Coprococcus and
class Prevotellaceae compared to autistic faecal samples. Prevotella spp are commensal gut microbes,
specialised in degrading plant polysaccharides and synthesising vitamin B1. Lower abundance of
Prevotella spp could therefore result in a vitamin B1 deﬁciency. In addition, Veillonellaceae were found
in lower abundance in autistic children. Small diﬀerences were observed in Sutterella genus, being less
abundant in autistic children [20]. These data reveal a change in microbiota composition in autistic
children that may have biochemical and functional consequences on the host.

Intestinal biopsies from the caecum and the terminal ileum of twenty-three ASD children showed
signiﬁcantly increased numbers of Sutterella spp compared to nine healthy controls. Sutterella spp are
normally scarce in a healthy microbiota and were found in none of the controls, but in twelve of the
twenty-three ASD patients [88]. The microbial composition was also studied in duodenal biopsies
comparing nineteen autistic children with twenty-one healthy controls [89]. The study did not ﬁnd
any major diﬀerences between the phyla, but some alterations were observed at genus und species
levels. The genus Burkholderia was signiﬁcantly increased in autistic participants compared to controls.
The genera Actinomyces, Oscillospira, Peptostreptococcus and Ralstonia were elevated and the genus
Neisseria was signiﬁcantly under-represented in autistic children compared to controls. The genera
Bacteroides, Devosia, Prevotella and Streptococcus were also decreased. Also, lower abundances of
Escherichia coli were observed [89]. Kushak et al. could not ﬁnd major diﬀerences at phylum
level as above-mentioned studies [40,49,53,76,87]. This could be due to the fact, that all the other
studies investigated microbial composition from stool samples and not biopsies from duodenal mucosa.
The stool samples represent, by and large, microbial composition of the large intestine [90]. Kushak et al.,
on the other hand, represented microbial composition of the small intestine. Kushak’s results suggested
that microbial changes in the large intestine could have a greater impact on the pathology of ASD than
the changes in the small intestine. Therefore, a better representation of the microbial gut milieu could
be achieved by collecting mucosal samples from all over the GI tract for comparison of the microbiota
resulting in a better understanding of the inter-relationships of the microbiota functioning and the
interaction with the host.

Biopsies from the ileum and the caecum of ﬁfteen ASD children (seven controls) showed a lower
abundance of Bacteroides leading to a signiﬁcantly higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio [53]. Levels
of Clostridiales (Firmicutes) were slightly elevated in ASD group, especially the families Lachnospiraceae
and Ruminococcaceae and the genus Faecalibacterium. The class Betaproteobacteria (Proteobacteria)
was signiﬁcantly higher abundant in faecal samples of the caecum in ASD patients, within the class
Betaproteobacteria the family Alcaligenaceae was the highest abundant [53]. Concomitant with
increasing levels of Bacteroidetes the mRNA levels of SGLT1 in ileum and caecum signiﬁcantly
increased, whereas the mRNA levels of sucrase isomaltase (disaccharidase) decreased in the caecum.
With increasing mRNA levels of sucrose isomaltase a signiﬁcant decreased amount of Firmicutes was
observed in the caecum [53]. These associations may be of therapeutic interest, as they demonstrated
how bacterial composition inﬂuenced expressions of the host’s sugar transporters and enzymes to
consequently alter their nutrients’ availability. Therefore, directing the bioactive therapeutic molecules
to the small intestine or the colon may be a practical approach to circumvent systematic absorption
achieving a speciﬁc modulation of the microbiota in these organs.

Sibling control studies delivered discordant results. A Slovakian study enrolling twenty-nine
participants including autistic children, their siblings and healthy children found that the amount
of Lactobacillus spp was signiﬁcantly increased (Figure 3) in the faeces of autistic children compared
to siblings and healthy controls. Amount of Desulfovibrio and Clostridia spp were also increased,
whereas Biﬁdobacterium spp were decreased in autistic children (Figure 3) [49]. The authors associated
the severity of behavioural symptoms in social interaction, communication and restricted/repetitive
behaviour in ASD with the amount of Desulfovibrio spp present. Therefore, Desulfovibrio spp were
considered pathogenic microbes. Interestingly, non-autistic siblings of autistic children showed lower
abundance of Bacteroidetes and higher abundance of Firmicutes compared to healthy controls with no
family history of ASD [49]. Furthermore, non-autistic siblings had lower abundance of Clostridia and
Desulfovibrio spp and signiﬁcantly lower counts of Biﬁdobacterium spp compared to autistic children.
Therefore, it was postulated that the levels of bacterial spp could be the tipping factor between autistic
or healthy phenotypes [49]. In contrast, Gondalia et al. found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in microbial
composition after analysing ﬁfty-one autistic children and their ﬁfty-three non-autistic siblings [91].
Similarly, a diﬀerent study including ﬁfty-nine autistic children and forty-four non-autistic siblings
also found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the composition of the gut microbiota [92]. These data suggest
that the microbiota of siblings are similar and independent from their autistic phenotype [91], probably
as a result of the shared environment and genetic makeup [93].

Higher occurrence of Clostridium spp in the gut was associated with disease severity using the
Childhood Autism Rating score (CARs score) [15]. Signiﬁcantly higher counts of the bacterium
Clostridium perfringens were found in faecal samples of thirty-three autistic children compared to
thirteen controls. Especially the spp Clostridium perfringens producing the beta2-toxin gene was
signiﬁcantly elevated in autistic children. The authors also found a signiﬁcant relationship between
the abundance of the beta2-toxin gene and occurrence of ASD [21]. Herbicides were considered to
preserve Clostridia spp and harm beneﬁcial bacteria [94]. A review suggested that a sub-acute tetanus
infection with a Clostridium spp might be the cause of some cases of ASD. Infection with the pathogen
Clostridium tetani only occurs in dysbiotic GI tracts, as it is an opportunistic pathogen. It may be
inactive for several months until favourable conditions allow its growth. Clostridium tetani produces
tetanus neurotoxin, which crosses the intestinal barrier. Tetanus neurotoxin is then transported via the
vagal nerve to the nucleus solitarius and subsequently to the whole CNS. Tetanus neurotoxin inhibits
the release of synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters by irreversibly cleaving synaptobrevin,
a membrane-associated protein, which is important for vesicle stability. Synapses with cleaved
synaptobrevin degenerate and lower synaptic activity correlates with diminished social behaviour
found in ASD (Figure 4). Tetanus neurotoxin targets inhibitory neurons releasing GABA or glycine.
Purkinje and granular cells in the cerebellum express receptors for the neurotoxin and the purkinje

cells release GABA as neurotransmitter, making them vulnerable to the toxin. This is in line with the
observation of decreased Purkinje and granular cells in autopsies of autistic children [43].

Figure 4. Process of Clostridium tetani infection in the gut. Occurrence of the bacterium Clostridium
tetani in the GI tract of autistic population could lead to altered behaviour. [43].

The yeast Candida appears to play a role in autistic children as well. Strati et al. found signiﬁcantly
elevated abundances of the bacterial genera Collinsella, Corynebacterium, Dorea and Lactobacillus in
the faeces of forty autistic children when compared to healthy children. Lowered levels of Alistipes,
Bilophila, Dialister, Parabacteroides and Veillonella were also found in autistic children. Additionally, the
authors found the yeast Candida to be present at increased rates in autistic children. Constipation could
be associated with higher levels of Escherichia, Shigella and Clostridium cluster XVIII and lower levels of
Gemmiger and Ruminococcus [87]. Lactobacillus spp stimulate the immune system to produce IL-22. IL-17
and IL-22 together inhibited the overgrowth of Candida spp, however in autistic population, the altered
diversity of microbial community favoured the growth of Candida spp. Furthermore, Candida spp, once
established in the gut, prevented recolonization of commensal microbes [87]. Several studies found
notably higher abundance of Candida spp, especially Candida albicans in the faecal samples of autistic
children compared to healthy counterparts [15,95]. Kantarcioglu et al. investigated the abundance of
Candida spp in the gut of 415 autistic children (and 403 controls), which was elevated. Reportedly this
yeast is associated with some autistic behaviour and 60 % of the healthy population is estimated to be
asymptomatic carrier of Candida spp [95]. Normally, Candida cannot grow in the healthy microbial
environment due to the competition for space and nutrients and suppression by commensal bacteria.
However, in a dysbiotic environment as frequently observed in the autistic population, the yeast
proliferates and produces ammonia and toxins, which were reported to increase autistic behaviour [95].
Candida spp also cause malabsorption of minerals and carbohydrates potentially playing a role in the
ASD pathophysiology.

A simulation by Weston et al. showed the interdependency between the anti-inﬂammatory
genera Biﬁdobacterium and the pro-inﬂammatory Clostridia and Desulfovibrio. Biﬁdobacterium is inhibited
by lysozyme and the growth of Desulfovibrio. To some extent, Desulfovibrio thrives on metabolites
produced by Biﬁdobacterium. Growth of Clostridia is inhibited by lysozymes and by a higher abundance
of Biﬁdobacterium. The authors claimed that the growth of Clostridia in the gut with low abundances of
Biﬁdobacterium is a key risk for the development of ASD [96]. Another simulated study analysed the
microbiome coding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of glutamate and found that these enzymes
were underrepresented in autistic microbiome compared to healthy ones. Glutamate is a constituent of
the important peptide glutathione, which is an antioxidant and therefore reduces oxidative stress in

Purkinje and granular cells in the cerebellum express receptors for the neurotoxin and the purkinje cells release GABA as neurotransmitter, making them vulnerable to the toxin.

Growth of Clostridia is inhibited by lysozymes and by a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium.

the cell. This amino acid is also an excitatory neurotransmitter. An imbalance in the CNS between
excitation and inhibition has been postulated to contribute to ASD [97]. A general observed trend is
that Biﬁdobacterium spp are scarcer represented in the guts of autistic children, whereas Clostridia spp
are higher abundant [98].

Detecting altered microbial composition is especially important to understand how microbial
metabolites can modulate gut and neuronal functions. Future studies are needed to establish a possible
causation. Nevertheless, a signiﬁcantly changed microbial composition was found in the GI tracts
of autistic population pointing to a correlation between the microbiota and the occurrence of ASD.
However, some of the mentioned results contradict each other. Conﬂicting results have been found for
example for Oscillospira spp [40,89], Collinsella spp [40,87] and Parabacteroides spp [40,87]. Therefore,
conclusive evidence is yet to be established by future studies.

5.2. Altered Concentrations of Metabolites and Their Functional Consequences

5.2.1. Urinary Analysis

A study by Xiong et al. analysed urinary samples from sixty-two autistic and sixty-two non-autistic
controls. They found signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)- 3-hydroxypropionic
acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid in samples of autistic children
(Table 1) [99]. These data are in line with the proposition that 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic
acid induce autistic symptoms by decreasing catecholamine levels in the brain [38]. After oral
administration of Vancomycin and supplementation of the probiotic Biﬁdobacterium to these children
the mentioned metabolites signiﬁcantly decreased [99]. Vancomycin is an antibiotic, which is poorly
absorbed by the GI mucosa and has a great eﬀect on gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridia
spp. The decrease of 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and
3-hydroxyhippuric acid after treatment suggests that these metabolites are mostly produced by Clostridia
spp and other overgrown populations in an altered phenylalanine metabolism. The treatment showed
improved eye contact behaviour and less constipation in autistic children [99]. This ﬁnding was in line
with the observation that children with altered phenylalanine metabolism, such as phenylketonuria,
also often develop ASD [100].

Some Clostridiaceae spp are known to produce metabolites such as phenols, p-cresol and indoles,
all of which may act as toxins on the human metabolism [40]. P-cresol, which was investigated as a
possible biomarker for ASD, was elevated in the urinary [101,102] and faecal [40] samples of autistic
children (Table 1). P-cresol has an inhibitory eﬀect on the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and
thereby regulates the metabolism of the important neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain [100].
As p-cresol is only produced in the GI tract, its occurrence in the system correlated with increased
permeability of the gut. In addition, p-cresol was shown to correlate with autistic behaviour and the
severity of the disease [103].

Yap et al. compared urinary metabolite proﬁles of thirty-nine autistic children, twenty-eight
non-autistic siblings and thirty-four healthy controls using NMR spectroscopy. Autistic children were
found to excrete signiﬁcantly more N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, N-methyl nicotinic acid, and
N-methyl nicotinamide in their urine. Knowing that nicotinamide derives from tryptophan, this ﬁnding
suggested ASD-associated alterations of the nicotinamide and the tryptophan metabolism [104]. Other
signiﬁcantly elevated metabolites in the urinary proﬁle of ASD children were acetate, dimethylamine,
N-acetyl glycoprotein fragments, succinate and taurine. Signiﬁcantly lower levels of glutamate,
hippurate and phenylacetylglutamine were present in the urinary proﬁle of ASD children. Precursors
of phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate are phenylacetic acid and benzoic acid, which are both
produced by bacterial metabolism [104]. Hippurate is benzoic acid conjugated with glycine [105].
N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, N-methyl nicotinic acid, and N-methyl nicotinamide are end

This indicated that siblings of autistic children exhibited a metabolic proﬁle in between their autistic
siblings and normal controls [104].

In their urinary metabolite proﬁle of thirty autistic children Gevi et al. found major diﬀerences in
the tryptophan and purine metabolism compared to thirty non-autistic children. Other signiﬁcantly
perturbed pathways were the vitamin B6 pathway and the phenylalanine- tyrosine-tryptophan
biosynthesis, among others [101]. Additionally, increased levels of tryptophan degradation products
were found in the urine suggesting increased production of tryptophan or increased abnormal
degradation [106]. Several pathways utilize tryptophan in the human body (Figure 5).
Indican
or indolyl-lactate is produced by bacterial degradation. Through the human metabolism in the
kynurenine pathway, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid or quinolinic acid are generated. Serotonin and
melatonin are produced in another pathway from tryptophan (Figure 5). In the autistic metabolome
kynurenic acid and melatonin are found in much lower concentration and xanthurenic acid and
quinolinic acid are elevated compared to controls. The enzyme kynureninase uses vitamin B6 as
cofactor. Therefore, B6 deﬁciency explains lower concentrations of kynurenic acid and elevated levels
of xanthurenic acid and quinolinic acid in the kynurenine pathway [101]. Also, greater amounts of
indolyl-3-acetic acid and indolyl-lactate were found in the urine [101] and indole and 3-methylindole in
the faeces of autistic children [40]. Following species produce indoles: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris,
Paracolobactrum coliform, Achromobacter liguefaciens, Bacteroides spp [101] and Clostridium spp [40].
Indole is absorbed in the gut, thereafter it is oxidized and sulphated in the liver to indoxyl sulphate.
Indoxyl sulphate may lead to an accumulation of several neurotransmitters in the brain, blocking the
eﬄux transporter in the BBB [101]. A study revealed increased excretion of sulphate, sulphite and
thiosulphate into the urine in ASD. They reasoned that this ﬁnding was due to dysfunctional sulphate
transporters in the renal tube cells, hindering the reabsorption of these metabolites [104].

Figure 5. Metabolic pathways of tryptophan. The purple pathways show human metabolism of
tryptophan and the orange pathways are observed in bacterial degradation. Green surrounded boxes
show elevated metabolites and red surrounded boxes show decreased metabolites in the autistic
metabolome [101].

Other metabolites found in altered concentrations were TNF-α, free amino acids and quorum
sensing molecules (Table 1). TNF-α was found in heightened levels in the faeces of autistic children,
which correlated with the severity of GI symptoms [49]. Because increased TNF-α and IL-6 can also be
a marker of inﬂammation in the brain [1], these data re-conﬁrmed a higher level of inﬂammation in
the brains of autistic children. Circulating free amino acid levels were elevated in patients with ASD.
Glutamate especially was found in higher quantities in the faeces of autistic patients. Glutamate is
a neurotransmitter and the excess of it and can lead to apoptosis of neurons [40]. Quorum sensing
molecules such as PhrCACET1 are signal molecules exchanged between bacteria. Several Clostridium
spp synthesize PhrCACET1, which can readily cross the BBB. Clostridium spp are highly abundant in
autistic individuals, therefore, the eﬀect of PhrCACET1 should be closer investigated [107].

Accumulatively, these data showed several altered metabolites in the urinary proﬁle of
autistic children, some even with correlation to autistic behaviour such as p-cresol. The metabolic
pathways of tryptophan, purine, vitamin B6 and phenylalanine seem to be perturbed in ASD.
Combination therapy with Vancomycin and Biﬁdobacterium led to amelioration of autistic symptoms
such as improved eye contact and communication behaviour, assessed by the “Autism Behaviour
Checklist” [99].
In addition, the above therapy resulted in normalized levels of the metabolites
3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric
acid in the urine of autistic individuals [99] providing the existence of a possible link between
these metabolites and the pathology of ASD. These metabolites indicated an altered phenylalanine
metabolism in ASD. Further studies are warranted to work out the true potential of these metabolites
as possible biomarkers for ASD.

5.2.2. Blood Analysis

Elevated levels of several soluble factors including neurotransmitter were observed in the blood
of autistic patients. Serotonin levels in the whole blood were elevated in 23 % of the autistic children
(Table 2) [108]. In addition, co-occurring GI symptoms were observed in children with ASD and children
with hyperserotonaemia. However, the relationship between hyperserotonaemia and constipation
was not unequivocal in the study [108]. Serotonin serves as a major neurotransmitter in the CNS
and the gut. In the GI tract, serotonin controls motility, pain perception and GI secretion. In the
brain serotonin is responsible for regulating mood and cognition. In germ-free mice, higher levels of
serotonin were found in the hippocampus and higher levels of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin,
in the blood [73]. Known producers of serotonin are species from Candida, Streptococcus, Escherichia
and Enterococcus [72]. Another neurotransmitter found in elevated concentration in autistic children
was the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA [98]. Some Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium spp are known

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 2115 14 of 29  In their urinary metabolite profile of thirty autistic children Gevi et al. found major differences in the tryptophan and purine metabolism compared to thirty non-autistic children. Other significantly perturbed pathways were the vitamin B6 pathway and the phenylalanine- tyrosine-tryptophan biosynthesis, among others [101]. Additionally, increased levels of tryptophan degradation products were found in the urine suggesting increased production of tryptophan or increased abnormal degradation [106].

Therefore, B6 deficiency explains lower concentrations of kynurenic acid and elevated levels of xanthurenic acid and quinolinic acid in the kynurenine pathway [101]. Also, greater amounts of indolyl-3-acetic acid and indolyl-lactate were found in the urine [101] and indole and 3-methylindole in the faeces of autistic children [40].

producers of GABA [24,72,109]. Producers of another neurotransmitter, noradrenaline, are spp from
Bacillus, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Saccharomyces and Streptococcus [24,72]. Neurotransmitters produced
in the gut act upon gut epithelial cells to produce active molecules that may reach and inﬂuence the
CNS after the secretion into the periphery or by activating aﬀerent neurons.

Autistic children are also known to have signiﬁcantly lower plasma concentrations of glutathione,
homocysteine, methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (Table 2) [104]. S-adenosylmethionine acts as
an important methyldonor in the body and homocysteine is a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine,
suggesting perturbations in the sulphur metabolism. Methylation and glutathione are used to lower
oxidative stress in the cell. The methylation of nicotinic acid to N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide,
N-methyl nicotinic acid, and N-methyl nicotinamide consumes even more methyl-donor leading
to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress in cells of autistic children [104]. The excretion of
heavy metals is diﬃcult in ASD patients due to the fact that glutathione is less available and
transmethylation/transsulphuration pathways are altered [86]. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) is
mal-tolerated by autistic individuals. Mal-toleration occurs also due to insuﬃcient capability to
sulphate and thus detoxify the drug and due to the abundance of higher levels of p-cresol in autistic
children. This is in total agreement with the fact that non-autistic people with high p-cresol blood
levels are also known to be intolerant to Paracetamol [104]. The above data indicates an alteration in
the sulphur metabolism and a reduced reduction capability in the cells of autistic people owing to the
decreased levels S-adenosylmethionine and its precursor homocysteine.

Examining metabolites in serum and in red blood cells in eleven Canadian autistic children
revealed signiﬁcantly lower concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA), arachidonic acid (ARA) and lower ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in red blood cells
compared to ﬁfteen controls (Table 2). Also, signiﬁcantly lower concentrations of DHA, ARA and
linoleic acid were found in the serum [110]. Decreased fatty acids levels in patients might be a
direct result of the eating pattern observed in autistic individuals and not a cause leading to autism.
As constituents of neuronal membranes, both DHA and ARA play a role in the maturation of neuronal
networks. DHA is also important for the myelination of axons [111]. Both fatty acids are also modulator
of gene expression in the cell, which could also be a contributing epigenetic factor for ASD [110].
In conclusion, the picky eating habit observed in autistic children might be a contributing factor to ASD.
Another metabolite with altered concentration in ASD patients was thiamine-pyrophosphate (TPP).
The concentration in the plasma was signiﬁcantly decreased compared to controls. However, precursor
concentrations (thiamine and thiamine-monophosphate) were similar in both groups (Table 2) [112].
Lower concentration of TPP could result from an impaired excretion from producing cells into the
blood or an impaired uptake from the gut lumen. Indeed, over 40% of the gut microbiota are known to
produce TPP. TPP is a cofactor to many enzymes in the mitochondria, most importantly transketolase
in the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway [112]. A decreased function of transketolase leads to an
accumulation of the substrate for the oxidative pathway, which in turn inhibits the reductive pathway
of pentose-phosphate-pathway resulting in lower concentration of NADPH. Lower abundance of
NADPH leads to an increased oxidative stress in the cell [112]. Thus, decreased levels of TPP lead to a
lessened reduction capacity, as they are a cofactor of transketolase inhibiting the production of NADPH.
In summary, the reduced anti-oxidative capacity may lead to a cellular damage and a reduction of
mitochondria’s capacity to produce energy in ASD individuals. Increased amounts of LPS were
also found in the blood of autistic individuals (Table 2) [56,113]. LPS is produced by gram-negative
bacteria and exerts pro-inﬂammatory activity. Leakage through the BBB can cause inﬂammation in
the brain through activating microglia. Heightened LPS levels in autistic individuals correlated with
elevated IL-6 levels, another pro-inﬂammatory cytokine. An inﬂammation further compromises the
integrity of the BBB, facilitating the accumulation of heavy metals in the brain tissue, including the
cerebellum [20,56], thus worsening the symptoms.

5.2.3. Short Chain Fatty Acids

SCFAs, mainly butyrate, propionate and acetate [114], are produced as fermentation products
by gut bacteria [115,116]. Lower concentrations of the total amount of SCFAs are found in autistic
children [40,98], providing the evidence for a reduced fermentation capacity of the microbiota.
Nevertheless, propionate and acetate are found in higher levels in autistic children suggesting that
butyrate production is dramatically reduced [40]. SCFAs cross the BBB and inﬂuence early brain
development by modulating production of the neurotransmitter serotonin and dopamine [40]. These
acids bind to two free fatty acid receptors (FFA2 and FFA3) found in several areas of the brain [6,72,117].
The resorption of water and electrolytes in the colon is also to some degree regulated by SCFAs [40].
They also modulate the cytokine production by T-cells [62]. Positively correlated with total amount of
SCFA were Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and Biﬁdobacterium genera, while the amount of Bacteroides
spp was correlated with propionic acid in autistic individuals [40]. Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonadaceae
and Parabacteroides were positively correlated with the amount of propionate and butyrate in autistic
individuals. Alcaligenaceae is also positively correlated with propionate, whereas the Bacteroidaceae
is negatively correlated with acetate and total amount of SCFA in autistic children [118].

Intraventricular injection of propionate into rat pups caused behavioural and physiological changes
as observed in ASD [98]. An accumulation of propionic acid can lead to prolonged neurodevelopment
and seizures [16]. Clostridia spp are known to produce exotoxins and propionate and thus create an
inﬂammatory status, which might worsen autistic symptoms [87]. As mentioned before, presence of
an oxidative milieu in the cell, as seen in autistic individuals, leads among others to malfunctioning of
mitochondrial enzymes and the production of reactive nitrogen species [119]. The reactive nitrogen
species interact with propionic acid and produce 3-nitropropionic acid. This acid acts as a mitochondrial
neurotoxin, which irreversibly inhibits the function of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which
is implicated in the synthesis of NADH. Propionic acid is also converted to propionyl-CoA and
enters the citric acid cycle at the enzyme succinyl-CoA-dehydrogenase. Two enzymes which are
important to produce NADH are surpassed by 3-nitropropionic acid [119]. NADH is a substrate for
the electron transport chain and consequently for ATP production. This explains the lower activity
of ETC enzyme complex I due to reduced substrate concentration [119]. Propionate is involved in
up-regulating the cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB). CREB
regulates synaptic plasticity, memory formation and the reward system [120]. A study by Frye et al.
compared mitochondrial function of lymphoblastoid cells from autistic subjects and controls after
incubating them in propionic acid and introduction to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Propionic acid
metabolised by healthy lymphoblastoid cells exerted beneﬁcial eﬀects on the cells such as increased
respiration. Cells from autistic individuals consumed propionic acid much faster as a fuel, suggesting
a compensatory measurement for energy production. The consequence of the stronger reaction to

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 2115

17 of 28

ROS after propionic acid incubation by lymphoblastoid cells of autistic subjects was, among others,
an increased proton leakage from the mitochondria to the inter-membrane space and hence a reduced
respiratory capacity [119].

Butyrate is used as an energy source in colonocytes [62]. It is involved in regulating inﬂammatory
and oxidative state of the mucosal cells, visceral sensitivity and motility and reinforces the mucosal
barrier in the intestines. It prevents carcinogenesis and inﬂammation in the gut via its anti-inﬂammatory
properties [114]. Butyrate modulates the biosynthesis of catecholamines and neurotransmitters in the
CNS and autonomic nervous system [106]. Butyrate is said to be the most important SCFA in humans
as it exhibits neuroprotective features. It promotes memory formation and neuronal plasticity through
epigenetic modulation [121]. In some neurodegenerative models butyrate was found to ameliorate
symptoms [121]. Even if not conclusive, the above data suggest an involvement of increased acetate
and propionate and decreased butyrate in the pathophysiology of ASD.

5.3. Other Etiologies for ASD

Over one hundred genes are associated with the pathology of ASD and up to several hundred
genes are implicated in elevation of the susceptibility to ASD [38]. Most of the aﬀected genes are
implicated in synapse plasticity [122] and brain development in utero as well as during infancy [27].
Most of the diﬀering gene expression lead to an altered structure of the CNS or the enteric nervous
system [38]. ASD has been hypothesised to be linked to abnormalities of the neural crest development
during pregnancy [123]. Inoue et al. found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of autistic children,
1056 up-regulated and 517 down-regulated genes, respectively [124]. Comorbidities such as fragile X
syndrome, tuberous sclerosis or Rett disorder have also been observed in ASD patients (Figure 2) [27].
Six Japanese autistic children were compared to six healthy controls regarding microbial composition by
collecting faeces and blood. The genus Faecalibacterium was higher and Blautia lower represented in the
faeces of autistic children [124]. Moreover, there were several up- and down regulated genes in autistic
children compared to healthy ones. Interestingly some genes, which are involved in IFN-gamma
mediated pathways correlated with the diﬀering abundances of Faecalibacterium and Blautia [124].
These data are in accord with the ﬁnding that IFN-gamma is elevated in autistic children, which
suggests a chronic inﬂammation in these children.

Another aetiology for ASD-like behaviour in mice was the exposure to bisphenol A in utero.
Bisphenol A changed the DNA methylation and thus, the expression level of the gene for BDNF [125].
BDNF is important for survival of neurons, growth and diﬀerentiation of newly formed neurons as
well as new formations of synapses [72].

The data above indicates that several genes, which are involved in CNS development and
inﬂammation pathways, are altered in autistic individuals providing several targets for a better
understanding of the mechanisms involved in the disease and possible therapeutic targets.

6. Possible Therapeutic Measures Acting on the Microbiota

6.1. Prebiotics

Dietary prebiotics were deﬁned as “a selectively fermented ingredient that results in speciﬁc
changes in the composition and/or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota, thus conferring beneﬁt(s)
upon host health” [77,126].

Grimaldi et al. investigated the role of the prebiotic galactooligosaccharide (GOS) in a synthetic
colon model comparing diluted faecal samples from autistic children and controls regarding changes
in bacterial composition and metabolic proﬁle. The administration of the prebiotic led to signiﬁcant
increases in Biﬁdobacteria spp in both autistic and control models [98]. Slightly signiﬁcant increases
of the Clostridium cluster XI and decreases of Veillonellaeceae were observed only in the ASD group.
Signiﬁcant decreases occurred in Sutterella spp, Bacteroides, Clostridial cluster IX, Escherichia coli,
Veillonellaceae, Ruminococcus spp, Clostridium leptum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in autistic children.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 2115

18 of 28

Growth of Biﬁdobacteria could be stimulated by the prebiotic [98]. GOS also aﬀected SCFA production,
increasing butyrate and decreasing propionate. Thus, it is sensible to postulate that the eﬀects of the
GOS supplementation in these children were, at least partially, through the production of acetate and
butyrate [98].

Prebiotics are not widely researched as a treatment option for autistic individuals. Nonetheless,
existing data point to the fact that prebiotic treatment can cause microbial compositional alterations
in autistic children that could result in amelioration of autistic symptoms. As mentioned before,
methodologies to deliver therapeutics, such as speciﬁc SCFA or prebiotics, to the GI tract could
be envisaged to directly target the colon to reach the microbiota without the interference of the
digestive system.

6.2. Probiotics

Probiotics contain living microorganisms and are administered to promote health by stimulating
immunity, strengthening the intestinal barrier, increasing the expression of mucine, reducing the
overgrowth of pathogens and producing vitamins and antioxidants [1,127]. The most commonly used
probiotics are Biﬁdobacterium spp and Lactobacillus spp [56].

The administration of the probiotic cocktail “Children Dophilus”, containing strains from
Lactobacillus, Biﬁdobacterium and Streptococcus [49], three times a day for four months shifted
the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio towards more Bacteroidetes (Table 3). The abundances of the
genera Desulfovibrio and Biﬁdobacterium also increased in autistic children. The administration
of the probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Biﬁdobacterium infantis, Biﬁdobacterium longus,
Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus paracasei to autistic children improved
comorbid GI problems [106]. Lactobacillus reuteri on its own could reverse intestinal inﬂammation
caused by LPS [46]. Furthermore, the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri inﬂuenced the posterior pituitary
gland to produce more oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hypothalamic hormone positively inﬂuencing social
behaviour [24]. It remains to be determined whether increased levels of oxytocin in autistic children
could ameliorate their behaviour in social interactions in a well-designed experimental setting.

The administration of Biﬁdobacterium spp to mice for 8 weeks resulted in higher concentration of
ARA and DHA in their brains [117]. This altered fatty acids composition in the brain exerted a beneﬁcial
eﬀect on neurogenesis, neurotransmission and preventing oxidative stress. Learning and memory
were also positively aﬀected by these fatty acids [117]. The administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus
in mice, on the other hand, reduced corticosterone levels and thereby positively inﬂuenced anxiety
and depression. Another observed eﬀect was altered levels of GABA and its receptors throughout the
brain. These eﬀects could only be achieved with an intact vagal nerve, a fact that reconﬁrms the role of
the vagal nerve as a major route of communication between the brain and the gut microbiota [117].

Hsiao et al. treated gut permeability and altered microbial composition by oral administration of
the commensal microbe Bacteroides fragilis in MIA mice showing improvements of autistic features as
well as amelioration of deﬁcits in anxiety-like behaviour. Interestingly the probiotic also corrected
altered expression of the tight junction proteins CLDN-8 and CLDN-15 in the colon. Heightened
levels of IL-6 found in the colon of MIA mice were normalised, which led to improved gut barrier
function. A metabolite, which was found in signiﬁcantly higher levels in the serum of MIA mice
is 4-ethylphenylsulfate, which is chemically similar to p-cresol and is produced by Clostridia spp.
The authors convincingly showed that the oral administration of Bacteroides fragilis corrected serum
levels of 4-ethylphenylsulfate in MIA mice [5].

Probiotics are known to alter the microbial composition in the gut of autistic children. The experimental
evidence for the positive behavioural changes observed in MIA mice after administration of Bacteroides fragilis
raise the interesting question whether the same result also applies to humans [128].

6.3. Faecal Microbiota Transplantation

In contrast to probiotic treatment, where just some bacterial strains are supplemented, faecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT) ensures the transfer of several hundred bacterial strains. A healthy
individual donates a stool sample [79], which is normally used freshly within eight hours or within
eight weeks when directly frozen after donation [129]. FMT could potentially be problematic, as donors
could transfer opportunistic pathogens or infections to recipients. A thorough screening of donors
before donation minimises the risk but in the early stages of infections donors could be asymptomatic
and unknowingly transfer infections [130]. Despite these uncertainties, FMT is an established and
eﬃcient therapy in recurrent Clostridium diﬃcile infection [77,79,131,132].

Kang et al. studied the impact on the microbial composition and the course of GI and autistic
symptoms in eighteen autistic children after “Microbiota Transfer Therapy” [79]. The transfer followed
over a period of 7–8 weeks after oral administration of Vancomycin and bowel cleansing. The results
were impressing, because GI symptoms such as constipation, diarrhoea or abdominal pain decreased by
80%. The improvement lasted at least for eight weeks. This study showed clearly an improvement of not
only GI but also seventeen ASD behavioural symptoms assessed by the “Parental Global Impressions-III”
after FMT [79]. The main consequence of faecal transplantation was an increased bacterial diversity
and altered abundances of some bacteria such as the genera Biﬁdobacterium, Prevotella and Desulfovibrio.
This suggests that GI and behavioural symptoms in autistic children are inter-connected and trace
back to lesser microbial diversity probably through modulating metabolites [79].

Therefore, FMT is an exciting new treatment option, which could be considered for ASD patients

with dysbiosis.

6.4. Other Treatment Strategies

Amelioration of behavioural symptoms could also be reached through oral treatment with
Vancomycin, which is an antibiotic speciﬁc to bacteria such as Clostridiaceae [40]. This ﬁnding
suggests a connection between Clostridiaceae and autistic behaviour. However, the amelioration of
the symptoms did not last longer than the treatment duration [40]. This was attributed to the spore
forming capacity of these bacteria as bacterial spores can survive antibiotic treatment and proliferate
afterwards [40]. Also, a restricted gluten and/or casein-free diet seemed to positively aﬀect the social
and cognitive problems in children with ASD [40]. One hypothesis is that these food components are
metabolised to opioid-like substances and act in the CNS [106,133]. However, the evidence is rather
weak, as opioid-like substances were not found in autistic individuals. Therefore, the therapeutic value
of omitting gluten and casein free diet is limited and should only be considered if there are allergic
reactions to the abovementioned food components [86,106].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 2115

Interestingly, higher rates of ASD have been reported in people with dark skin and in regions with
limited solar irradiation. Signiﬁcantly lower levels of 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D in serum were found in
autistic children in comparison to controls. In a study vitamin D supplementation was given to rat pups
to treat ASD induced by propionic acid. The authors discovered that vitamin D has neuroprotective
features and less DNA breaks were detected in the brains of rats treated with vitamin D compared
to untreated propionic acid induced rats. These results, however, could only be obtained, when the
pups were treated with vitamin D before inducing autism. In conclusion, the study suggested that
vitamin D exhibits rather a preventive than a therapeutic eﬀect [134]. The administration of vitamin B1
to autistic children was also suggested to ameliorate symptoms due to vitamin B1 producing bacteria
Prevotella being found in lower abundances in autistic children [20].

One publication even suggested the introduction of helminths, which are parasitic worms, into the
gut ecosystem to achieve a greater diversity. One argument was that before daily hygienic measures
were introduced in our society, helminths were a normal part of the gut microbiota and the prevalence
for ASD was smaller [123]. This hypothesis was experimentally supported by the data that the exposure
of the immune activated rats to helminths resulted in less anxious behaviour [123], which is considered
to be a symptom of ASD in rodents [102]. Obviously, these treatment options were poorly documented
and are not recommended as a treatment option for ASD patients before thorough investigations.

7. Discussion and Conclusions

It remains yet to be unequivocally determined whether dysbiosis is a factor causing ASD or if the
disease is causing the microbial alterations. The mutual correlation between ASD and alterations in
the microbiota, however, has been undoubtedly conﬁrmed by many animal and human studies [124].
To further narrow down the mechanisms of disease, studies with bigger sample sizes are required,
since the works summarized in this review showed varying degrees of statistical signiﬁcance and some
results are based on small sample sizes. Our review also showed big variations of methodologies and
outcome measures calling for standardisation of the treatment regimens to achieve higher statistical
signiﬁcance and a better comparison between the study results.

This review article demonstrated significant changes in microbial composition of autistic population.
Often observed changes in ASD children were a generally decreased bacterial diversity compared
to control populations and the significantly decreased Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio [49,53,76,87].
Elevated abundances of Clostridium spp in autistic individuals correlated with the severity of autistic
behaviour [15]. An evolutionary explanation as to why the microbiota modulate our behaviour is, the
more social the host is, the more the microbes can spread through society [135].

The discovery and understanding the connection between the microbiota and ASD is especially
important to ﬁnd new treatment options for this disease. Treatment of autistic behaviour based on
microbial compositional alterations such as probiotics and faecal microbiota transfer showed promising
results in GF-mice and autistic individuals [5,46,49,79,106,117]. The administration of probiotics
resulted in improvement of comorbid GI problems [106] or stimulation of the production of oxytocin,
positively inﬂuencing social behaviour [24,136]. Especially, faecal microbiota transfers signiﬁcantly
ameliorated ASD behavioural symptoms and GI problems in autistic children [79]. For widespread
use of these treatments more studies must be conducted to ﬁnetune treatment, mode of delivery, safety,
its duration and doses.

We suggest that the reduced mRNA expressions of disaccharidases and hexose transporters in
the gut epithelium may be responsible for some of the alteration in microbial composition of ASD
patients [53]. More mono- and disaccharides entering the colon favour some bacterial species over
others and consequently lead to an altered metabolome in the gut aﬀecting the host. Such alterations
may result in diﬀerent expression levels of tight junction proteins [55] leading to comorbidities such as
increased intestinal permeability [15] and a reduced integrity of the BBB in ASD patients. As a result of
these changes, bacterial metabolites can enter and inﬂuence the CNS.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 2115

21 of 28

Signiﬁcantly lower plasma concentration of S-adenosylmethionine, glutathione [104] and
thiamine-pyrophosphate [112] in ASD provide the evidence for a perturbation in transmethylation
processes in the body and diminished reduction capability of the cell. Increased oxidative stress
in the cells leads to malfunctioning of mitochondrial enzymes and production of reactive nitrogen
species, which can interact with propionic acid and produce a mitochondrial neurotoxin worsening
the reduction capability [119]. Lower concentrations of the total amount of SCFAs are found in ASD
patients [40,98] with higher levels of propionate and indicating that butyrate production is dramatically
reduced [40]. The altering concentrations of the bacterial metabolites butyrate and propionate
are likely to play a role in the pathophysiology of autism. A new possible family of substances
with link to ASD is suggested in our review including 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic
acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid. These metabolites were increased in
the urinary proﬁle of ASD patients linking ASD to an abnormal phenylalanine metabolism. As a
consequence of treating ASD patients with an antibiotic and a probiotic, these metabolites decreased in
the urine of autistic patients. Additionally, autistic behaviour was ameliorated in the patients due to
this treatment [38]. The evidence for the predictive value of the suggested biomarkers is based on one
well conducted study only. Therefore, the eﬀectiveness of these molecules for prediction of ASD need
to be validated in independent human studies, to reconﬁrm the ﬁnding that these metabolites are part
of an autistic-behaviour-causing metabolome.

In conclusion, the correlation between changes in distinct bacterial populations and several
bacterial metabolites, and the behavioural changes related to ASD warrant further investigations into
the microbiota-gut-brain-axis aiming at in-depth examination of mechanisms leading to the pathology
of autism. We presented here several epidemiological, experimental human and in vivo studies for
the involvement of diﬀerent microbes in the ASD pathology such as Clostridia spp and highlighted
the evidence for several metabolites to be considered as possible biomarkers for ASD. Additional
independent research following standardised protocols, and enrolling well-diagnosed bigger cohorts
are urgently needed to deﬁnitely discover the interdependencies, the sequence of events leading to
ASD, and to suggest unequivocal biomarkers and eﬀective therapeutic strategies.
