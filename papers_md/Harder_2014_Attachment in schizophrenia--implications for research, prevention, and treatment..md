attachment is a promising area for elucidating psychosocial 
mechanisms  important  for  development,  prevention,  and 
treatment of schizophrenia. This report gives a short sum-
mary of studies of  attachment in psychosis.  it was found 
that dismissing and disorganized forms of attachment were 
over-represented in psychosis. evidence pointed to associa-
tions between a dismissing attachment pattern and positive 
psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and poor engage-
ment with services. Furthermore, insecure attachment was 
found  to  predict  impaired  recovery  from  negative  symp-
toms.  possible  major  risk  processes  in  development  link-
ing  dismissing  attachment  to  symptom  development  were 
externalizing and deactivation of affects and poor mental-
ization.  For  a  disorganized  form  of  attachment,  possible 
risk mechanisms were heightened stress-sensitivity and dis-
sociation.  Based  on  this  initial  evidence,  further  research 
in  attachment  in  psychosis  focusing  on  these  risk  mecha-
nisms seems warranted. in addition, the evidence supported 
a focus on attachment-related risk processes to enhance the 
prevention and treatment of psychosis.

introduction

The crucial importance of attachment for normal develop-
ment  has  long  been  acknowledged  as  attested  in  a  large 
and rapidly growing body of research.1 The developmental 
psychopathology approach and the new Research Domain 
Criteria  (RDoC)  approach,  proposed  by  the  American 
National  Institute  of  Mental  Health,    both  stress  the 
importance  of  studying  risk  development  in  domains 
important for normal development. Nonoptimal forms of 
attachment have been found to be involved in the develop-
ment of several mental disorders, such as borderline per-
sonality disorder (BPD) and depression.1 Taken together, 

this  makes  attachment  a  promising  area  for  elucidating 
psychosocial mechanisms important for the development 
of  schizophrenia.  Following  the  RDoC  approach,  the 
association between attachment and the broader psychosis 
domain, not only schizophrenia proper, will be discussed.

attachment

The core contribution of the attachment approach is the 
understanding  of  the  unique  quality  of  the  tie  between 
a parent and a child established through the infants first 
1–2  years  of  life.2  Through  attachment  relationships, 
strong  emotional  bonds  between  infants  and  primary 
caregivers  are  formed,  which  can  then  lead  the  infant 
to  experience  distress  and  separation  anxiety  when  sep-
arated.  This  distress  can  only  be  repaired  by  reunion 
with the attachment figures, not by any other caregiver. 
According  to  attachment  theory,  humans  have  an  evo-
lution-based  need  for  attachment,  which  serve  the  pur-
pose of increasing survival through securing the infant’s 
physical closeness to the caregiver and providing optimal 
conditions for the cognitive and socioemotional develop-
ment.  It  is  the  specific  qualities  of  the  attachment  rela-
tionship,  where  the  caregiver  can  serve  as  a  secure  base 
for exploration and as a safe haven for the regulation of 
distress and negative emotions, which is crucial for opti-
mal development. The infant’s experiences in attachment 
relationships  lead  eventually  to  the  development  of  an 
inner  working  model  for  affect  regulation,  exploration, 
and  interpersonal  functioning,  an  attachment  pattern, 
which tends to be relatively stable over time.

Subtypes of attachment

Three  organized  patterns  of  attachment  have  been 
described,  secure,  insecure  dismissing  and  insecure  pre-
occupied.3  These  patterns  are  understood  as  adapta-
tions  to  the  type  of  care  provided,  with  the  purpose  of

maintaining the caregiver’s protection. Secure attachment 
is characterized by adaptive affect regulation, an ability 
to be emotionally close and yet autonomous in interper-
sonal  relationships  and  high  levels  of  mentalization,  ie, 
the ability to understand mental states. This is the result 
of early interactions with caregivers, who are sensitive to 
the infant’s need for both exploration and resolution of 
distress and anxiety.

In  dismissing  attachment,  adults  tend  to  deactivate 
emotions and attention to mental states of self and other. 
They prefer to keep others at a distance, valuing achieve-
ments over close relationships. This is understood as an 
adaptation  to  early  experiences  of  consistent  rejection 
from caregivers of open expression of distress. The person 
adapts to this by over-regulation of affects and distrac-
tion strategies, eg, by focusing away from the attachment 
relationship and attending to exploration, in an attempt 
to cope with distress alone.

In  contrast,  preoccupied  attachment  is  thought  to 
develop in response to inconsistent caregiver availability. 
In order to secure the needed attention from attachment 
figures,  the  person  exaggerates  expression  of  emotions 
and keeps attention to attachment figures at the expense 
of exploration and development of autonomy. Emotions 
tend to be under-regulated, and positive feelings are often 
mixed with feelings of anger and anxiety.

In  addition  to  these  3  organized  patterns,  some  indi-
viduals develop more disorganized attachment character-
ized  by  momentary  ruptures  of  the  organized  pattern 
(unresolved type) or more profound breakdown (cannot 
classify  type).  Here,  a  strategy  to  successfully  regulate 
emotions no longer seems present, resulting in incoherent 
states of mind. Disorganized attachment has been linked 
to adverse experiences in childhood, such as frightening 
or  frightened  caregiver  behavior  or  other  types  of  dis-
rupted caregiver behaviors.

In addition to these classical subtypes of attachment, 
which are measured by the Adult Attachment Interview,3 
various  questionnaires  have  been  used  in  studies  of 
attachment  in  psychosis.4  They  use  subtypes  conceptu-
ally related to the classical subtypes for assessing attach-
ment, most importantly “attachment avoidance,”  which 
is related to the dismissing pattern and “attachment anxi-
ety”  resembling  the  preoccupied  pattern.  The  classical 
terms will be used to cover both.

Distribution of attachment in psychosis

In psychosis the dismissing type of attachment is found 
to  be  dominating,  ranging  from  48%  to  71%  compared 
with  27%  in  a  norm  group.  Preoccupied  attachment 
ranges  between  12%  and  20%  and  secure  between  27% 
and 32%, as compared with 19% and 58%, respectively, 
in a norm group.5–7 This distribution stands in contrast to 
most other mental disorders, where preoccupied attach-
ment and under-regulation of affect are dominant, as in 

1190

depression  and  BPD.8  Only  two  studies6,7  have  reported 
levels  of  disorganized  attachment  in  psychosis.  They 
found high levels (29–35%) equivalent to levels found in 
BPD whereas, in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
disorganization  is  higher  (57%).9  Thus,  dismissing  and 
disorganized  attachment  appears  to  be  important  as 
potential risk factors in psychosis.

correlates of attachment

Two recent systematic reviews have summarized the find-
ings of correlates of attachment in psychosis10 and associa-
tion with psychotic phenomena in clinical and nonclinical 
samples.11 As would be predicted by attachment theory, 
insecure forms of attachment taken together are related to 
poorer premorbid adjustment, more interpersonal prob-
lems,  and  impaired  mentalization.10  Dismissing  attach-
ment  is  robustly  associated  with  psychiatric  symptoms, 
positive and negative symptoms in psychosis. These find-
ings  are  echoed  by  findings  in  nonclinical  populations. 
Here, dismissing attachment is associated with subclinical 
psychotic  symptomatology,  paranoia,  and  endorsement 
of delusional-like experience;12 and with negative symp-
toms,  especially  social  anhedonia  found  in  3  studies11 
suggesting  a  robust  relationship.  For  attachment  preoc-
cupation, only a modest association to symptomatology 
is found in psychosis,10 whereas correlates of disorganized 
attachment in psychosis are yet to be examined. Thus, at 
present, the evidence is most strongly established for an 
association between dismissing attachment and psychotic 
symptoms.

risk Mechanisms in Dismissing attachment

Various hypotheses have been proposed concerning which 
risk processes link attachment and psychosis. Three risk 
processes  might  be  involved  in  the  association  between 
dismissing  attachment  and  psychosis,  namely  deactiva-
tion of affects and impaired mentalization involved in the 
development  of  negative  symptoms  and  externalizing 
affect regulations strategies involved in the development 
of positive symptoms.

1.  Deactivation of affects. It has been proposed that the 
over-regulation/deactivation of affects seen in dismiss-
ing attachment could be a risk mechanism underlying 
development  of  negative  symptoms.7  Negative  symp-
toms include blunted affect, anhedonia, and emotional 
and social withdrawal. Each of these symptoms could 
potentially  be  endpoints  of  severe  affective  deactiva-
tion  processes  in  a  dismissing  attachment  pattern,  in 
response to unresolved distress.

2.  Impaired  mentalization.  Impaired  mentalization  has 
been  suggested  as  linking  attachment  and  psychosis6 
and  is  more  profound  in  dismissing  attachment  than 
in  secure  and  preoccupied  attachment  in  psychosis.6 

Furthermore,  impaired  metacognitive  skills—a  con-
cept overlapping with mentalization—has been found 
to be associated with negative symptoms in schizophre-
nia.13 Impaired ability to mentalize is likely to interact 
with deactivation of affects and together these two risk 
developmental  processes  could  be  underlying  mecha-
nisms  of  the  lack  of  spontaneity  and  engagement  in 
social interaction described in negative symptomatol-
ogy. Low mentalization has also been proposed to be 
involved  in  impaired  social  functioning  and  positive 
symptoms.11

3. Externalizing strategies. Externalizing behavioral and 
cognitive strategies might be mechanisms linking dis-
missing  attachment  to  positive  psychotic  symptoms. 
A line of  indirect evidence supports this hypothesis. 
Dismissing  attachment  is  characterized  by  a  turn-
ing  away  from  attachment  towards  exploration  in 
situations of  distress. In accordance with this exter-
nalizing  affect  regulation  strategy,  infant  avoidant 
attachment  predicts  externalizing  behavior,14  which 
in turn has been found to be associated with hallu-
cinations  in  a  youth  sample.15  Externalizing  cogni-
tions  are  further  found  to  underpin  hallucinatory 
experiences.16

risk Mechanisms in Disorganized attachment

In addition to dismissing attachment, disorganized forms 
of  attachment  (unresolved  and  cannot  classify)  were 
found in one-third of persons with psychosis. Unresolved 
attachment in adults can only be assigned when experi-
ence of past trauma has been identified. Corresponding 
to this, a recent meta-analysis17 found significant associa-
tions  between  childhood  adversities  and  psychosis  with 
an overall effect of odds ratio (OR) = 2.78. The findings 
indicated a 33% reduction in people developing psycho-
sis if childhood trauma could be prevented. Within sub-
types of childhood trauma, the highest risk of psychosis 
was found for emotional abuse (OR = 3.40) and high as 
well  was  emotional  neglect  (OR  =  2.90).  Infant  disor-
ganized  attachment  status  is  closely  linked  to  trauma18 
and has in itself been proposed as the result, not only of 
overt trauma but also of “hidden trauma”19 of caregiver 
unavailability  and  interactive  dysregulation  resulting  in 
lack of regulation of fearful arousal in the infant. Thus, 
early disorganized attachment is likely to be a risk factor 
for psychosis, in line with the established emotional abuse 
and  neglect  type  of  trauma.  In  contrast,  secure  attach-
ment is an important resilience factor for resolving trau-
matic  experiences  in  childhood20  indicating  that  secure 
attachment  could  moderate  the  association  between 
trauma  and  psychosis.  As  mentioned  earlier,  correlates 
between  disorganized  attachment  and  psychotic  symp-
tomatology in psychosis are yet unexplored, but indirect 
evidence points to a possible association between disor-
ganized  attachment  and  positive  psychotic  symptoms,

with  heightened  stress-sensitivity  and  dissociation  as 
underlying risk mechanisms.

1.  Heightened  stress-sensitivity.  A  physiological  mecha-
nism  possibly  linking  disorganized  attachment  and 
trauma to psychosis is heightened stress-sensitivity, a 
vulnerability  marker  for  psychosis.  This  is  supported 
by  findings  that  the  human  brain  seems  especially 
sensitive  to  interpersonal  stress.21  Stress-sensitivity 
can  be  measured  as  altered  cortisol  reactivity  in  the 
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal  axis  in  responses  to 
stressful  experiences.  Both  hyper-  and  hypo-cortical 
reactivity  have  been  found  in  psychosis,  indicating 
altered  functioning  as  response  to  prolonged  severe 
distress.22  Furthermore,  altered  cortisol  release  pat-
terns  have  been  found  in  infants  with  disorganized 
attachment23 and in adults with childhood emotional 
maltreatment.24

2.  Dissociation.  Dissociation  can  be  understood  as  a 
mental  reaction  to  severe  distress,  which  cannot  be 
regulated  or  overcome.  The  distress  can  partly  be  a 
result  of  heightened  stress-sensitivity.  Dissociation 
is  well  described  as  a  result  of  traumatic  experiences 
in PTSD and is thus hypothesized to be present also 
in  persons  with  psychosis  and  a  history  of  trauma. 
“Hidden  trauma”  within  the  attachment  relationship 
may  also  lead  to  dissociation,  because  disorganized 
attachment  in  itself  is  described  as  an  early  form  of 
dissociation,25 and strong associations has been found 
between  disorganized  attachment  in  infancy  and  dis-
sociative symptoms at 19 years.26 In addition, dissocia-
tive symptoms are common in psychosis and have been 
associated  with  hallucination  in  PTSD  and  trauma 
and hallucinations in psychosis.27 This line of indirect 
evidence supports the hypothesis of a link between dis-
organized attachment and the development of positive 
psychotic symptoms with stress-sensitivity and disso-
ciation as underlying mechanisms.

psychosocial risk Mechanisms in psychosis—an 
attachment-Based Model

Several  possible  mechanisms  have  thus  been  proposed 
which could underlie associations between dismissing and 
disorganized  attachment  and  psychosis.  The  proposed 
developmental pathways and risk mechanisms described 
earlier are illustrated in figure 1.

As illustrated in figure 1, the quality of the infant care-
giver  attachment  relationship  most  likely  interacts  with 
parental and infant factors, as well as with various social 
factors.  If  the  attachment  relationships  lead  to  dismiss-
ing or disorganized attachment, then various risk devel-
opmental  processes  are  present,  which  can  be  involved 
in  symptom  development  in  psychosis.  The  model  only 
illustrates  the  mechanisms  discussed  in  this  report.  In 
line  with  the  developmental  psychopathology  approach

and empirical findings of multiple risk factors in schizo-
phrenia,  the  disease  is  best  understood  as  the  result  of 
multiple  developmental  pathways  caused  by  several 
interacting risk factors and disease mechanisms. Hence, 
attachment  is  only  one  of  many  bio-psycho-social  risk 
processes involved. Of particular note, secure attachment 
was found in one-third of a psychosis sample. A secure 
attachment  pattern  will  most  likely  function  as  a  resil-
ience factor, and it has been found to be associated with 
better  engagement  with  services  and  improved  recovery 
from negative symptoms.7

implications for research

The  emerging  findings  of  associations  between  attach-
ment and psychosis reported earlier support attachment 
as  a  potentially  important  concept  in  psychosis.  I  have 
pointed  to  a  number  of  risk  developmental  processes 
possibly involved, namely deactivation and externalizing 
affect regulation strategies, low mentalization, heightened 
stress-sensitivity, and dissociation. They seem promising 
areas  of  research,  which  could  potentially  improve  our 
understanding  of  socioemotional  processes  involved  in 
the development of specific symptoms and difficulties in 
psychosis.

implications for prevention and Treatment

The  emerging  evidence  for  the  role  of  attachment  for 
development  of  psychosis  has  implications  for  preven-
tion  and  treatment  of  psychosis.  Prevention  should 
include  the  promotion  of  resilience  through  facilitating 

1192

secure attachment relationships during childhood. Little 
is known directly of the role of childhood attachment for 
psychosis, but indirect evidence, as outlined earlier, sup-
ports  such  an  approach  and  warrant  further  research. 
Attachment-based  preventive  interventions  should  be 
offered where risk factors for psychosis known to be asso-
ciated with insecure attachment, in general, are present, 
such as children having a mentally ill parent, low socio-
economic  status,  childhood  interpersonal  trauma,  and 
growing up in managed care.

Turning to treatment, attachment as both resilience and 
risk factor should be part of routine assessment together 
with the assessment of adverse childhood experiences. An 
understanding  of  attachment  status  contributes  impor-
tant information on emotional and interpersonal aspects 
involved in symptom formations and recovery. Findings 
that  attachment  security  predicted  recovery  from  nega-
tive symptoms at 12 months and that increase in security 
was associated with improvement in negative symptoms 
support the importance of such an approach.7

Importantly, attachment affects the possibility of being 
engaged  in  treatment  at  all.  Greater  attachment  insecu-
rity  is  associated  with  poorer  engagement  with  services 
and  greater  likelihood  to  disengage  from  mental  health 
services.10  Specifically,  attachment  avoidance  is  associ-
ated with a reduced likelihood to seek help, poor use of 
treatment, and lower therapeutic alliance.10 Affective and 
interpersonal aspects of psychosis might thus be impor-
tant  to  address  in  attachment  informed  psychological 
therapies  to  promote  engagement  with  health  services 
and  promote  recovery.  The  attachment  perspective  is 
currently  informing  various  new  integrative  models  for 

psychotherapy  of  psychosis,28,29  but  further  research  in 
attachment informed intervention models is required.
