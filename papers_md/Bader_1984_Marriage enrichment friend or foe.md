Marriage Enrichment: Friend or Foe?
SUMMARY
Marmiage enrichment programs seem to have
particular appeal to couples who hope to
improve their relationship in their middle
years. These programs usually take the form
of a weekend retreat, and are limited to and
usually led by married couples. Marriage
enrichment programs should not be confused
with encounter groups which flourished in
the 1950s and 1%0s. Some encounter groups
deliberately used confrontation to bring anger
or fear to the surface; enrichment programs
emphasize the positive elements of the
marriage relationship and avoid cathartic
releases, which are more appropriate in a
counselling or therapy framework. Encounter
groups sometimes had negative effects on
sensitive or fragile participants, while
enrichment programs generally have a limited
but positive effect on couples. (Can Fam
Physician 1984; 30:1155-1157).

SOMMAIRE
Les programmes d'enrichissement du mariage
semblent attirer particulierement les couples d'age
moyen qui souhaitent ameliorer leurs relations
maritales. Ces programmes prennent habituellement
la forme d'une retraite de fin de semaine, sont
limites aux couples maries qui d'ailleurs les
organisent et les dirigent. On ne doit pas confondre
ces programmes d'enrichissement du mariage avec
les groupes de rencontre a la vogue durant les
annees 1950 et 1960. Certains de ces groupes de
rencontre ont utilise deliberement le methode de
confrontation pour ramener 'a la surface la peur et la
colere. Les programmes d'enrichissement, au
contraire, mettent l'emphase sur les elements
positifs de la relation maritale et evitent les
decharges emotionnelles pour se libhrer, lesquelles
sont plus approprie'es dans un cadre de counselling
ou de psychotherapie. Les groupes de rencontre ont
parfois genere des effets negatifs chez certains
participants fragiles ou trop sensibles, alors que les
programmes d'enrichissement ont plutot des effets
positifs mais limit6s chez les couples.

M ARRIAGE ENRICHMENT pro-
grams are attracting married cou-
ples who hope to improve their marital
relationships. David Mace, one of the
early leaders of the marriage enrich-
ment movement, stated that no one
knows who coined the phrase 'mar-
riage enrichment' but recalled that he
and his wife, Vera, used it in the title
of one of their books in 1952.1 Mar-
garet Arcus's2 1983 description is the
most complete. She said that "The
basic goal of marriage enrichment is to
develop the potential of the marriage
partners for mutually satisfying and
creative relationships. It is based on

CAN. FAM. PHYSICIAN Vol. 30: MAY 1984

the assumption that marriage is dy-
namic rather than a static relationship,
and that given favorable conditions
for growth, most couples can move
toward appropriating more of their po-
tential for positive relationships. Mar-
riage enrichment is intended to be pre-
ventive rather than remedial or
therapeutic" 2

Couples of all ages have attended
marriage enrichment programs, but the
movement seems to have a special ap-
peal for couples in their middle years.
Mace' has quoted such a couple as
saying: "Our marriage isn't breaking
up. We are quite sure we want to stay
married. But we have both decided
that we want our next 20 years to-
gether to be a lot better than our last 20
years have been".I He cited Lederer
and Jackson's 1968 study3 indicating
that the proportion of "stable-satisfac-
tory" marriages in the United States
does not exceed ten percent-an inter-
esting parallel to the remark, attributed
to Albert Einstein, that most people go
through life without using more than

ten percent of their intellectual poten-
tial.1 This suggests that many couples
go through married life using only a
fraction of their capacity for love and
companionship.

Developing capabilities seems to be
a worthwhile goal. Why, then, are
there so many shadowy doubts and
suspicions that marriage enrichment
causes harm instead of aiding married
couples? Perhaps the chief reason is
that marriage enrichment programs are
sometimes confused with the growth
and encounter groups which were a
by-product of the sensitivity training
groups and training laboratories of the
1950s and 1960s. Based on the
theories of social psychologist Kurt
Lewin, these short-term group experi-
ences promised participants a better
understanding of themselves, a change
in their behavior towards others, and
an improvement in their ability to
manage human relationships.
For
many, these goals were achieved, but
unskilled leadership sometimes caused
serious damage to sensitive or unstable

tric treatment, even to the point of
being hospitalized. I

What are the differences between
marriage enrichment groups and the
growth and encounter groups de-
scribed above? First, growth groups
were usually composed of individuals
having no other connection to each
other, while enrichment programs are

groups deliberately used confrontation
tactics to bring anger and fear to the
surface; enrichment programs empha-
size the positive elements of marriage
and avoid cathartic releases, which are
more appropriate in a counselling or
therapy framework.
Variations Of
Marriage Enrichment

The largest marriage enrichment
program is "Marriage Encounter",
which Father Gabriel Calvo4 brought
to North America from Spain. (The
word "Encounter" in its
title may
have caused many people to link the
program with the encounter groups de-
scribed above). By 1975, more than
200,000 couples had participated in
Marriage Encounter weekends. Protes-
tant and Jewish groups were formed,
and there are now similar "Engaged
Encounter" programs for engaged
couples .8

In the U.S., the United Methodist
Church uses the title "Marriage Com-
munication Labs" ,1 while in Canada
both the Anglican Church and the
United Church of Canada offer mar-
riage enrichment programs.

The Quakers' program, called
"Marriage Enrichment Retreats", was
begun by David and Vera Mace.'

These retreats were first held in 1962
and, like most of the enrichment pro-
grams, take place over a weekend.
Couples withdraw from their normal
lifestyle to concentrate on themselves
and their relationship. Usually seven
or eight couples attend.
If either
member of a couple cannot attend or
must drop out, then both must do so.
Both are expected to participate in the
entire weekend or it is not considered a
complete enrichment program. The
Maces also insist on the principle of
couples speaking to couples. My wife
and I took part in the Maces' first Mar-
riage Enrichment Retreat in Canada in
1974, and we found that their leader-
ship as a married couple was one of the
most valuable parts of the weekend.

Goals Of
Marriage Enrichment

Hof, Epstein, and Miller5 proposed
five goals for marital enrichment pro-
grams. These are: to increase spouses'
self-awareness and mutual empathy; to
increase their awareness of their posi-
tive characteristics, strengths, and po-
tential as individuals and as a couple;
to increase mutual self-disclosure of
thoughts and feelings; to increase inti-
macy; and to develop skills in com-
munication, problem solving and con-
resolution. Hof, Epstein and
flict
Miller admit that some marriage en-
richment programs focus on only one
or two of these goals. However, their
research indicates that many couples
report an increase in positive feelings
toward their partner and their relation-
ship as a result of participating in such
a program. If these experiences in-
crease couples' motivation to work on
their relationships, and if they reduce
the couples' resistance to change, they

can be valuable additions to skill-
oriented programs such as Guerney's
"Relationship Enhancement Pro-
gram' 6 or the "Couples Communica-
tion Program" of Miller, Nunnally,
and Wackman.7

Limitations To
Marriage Enrichment

Doherty, McCabe, and Ryder8
made several
criticisms which can
apply to many of the marriage enrich-
ment programs. "Marriage En-
counter" presents its viewpoint on the
marriage relationship as being identi-
cal with God's (i.e.,
'marriage is
God's plan'). Participants should be
cautious in accepting the adVice of any
group that identifies its approach with
divine approval.

A second problem for many groups
is that they underestimate the value of
individual growth within the marriage.
Doherty, McCabe and Ryder8 quoted
the National Marriage Encounter
Manual:
"Aloneness or loneliness;
i.e. independence or individualism, is
harmful".

are encouraged.

In contrast, Claude Guldner9 at the
University of Guelph has said a suc-
cessful family is one in which individ-
uality and a high degree of differentia-
Children and
tion
adults are able to develop their own in-
terests; this leads to a continual tug and
pull between separateness and mutual-
ity. Conflict arises only if the family
views individual expression as
a
threat.

A third limitation to marriage en-
richment is that the benefits of the
weekend may at best be temporary and
at worst illusory. The weekend often
aims at a marital 'high', especially
during the renewal of the marriage

At weekend marriage enrichment programs, "couples withdraw from their normal lifestyle to
concentrate on themselves and their relationship".

A fourth and final limitation to mar-
riage enrichment programs is
their
under-estimation of self-directed mar-
riage enrichment efforts which depend
neither on the leaders nor on the group
experience.

voiced this criticism and reported that
she and her husband had found self-
effort marriage enrichment can be suc-
cessful, at least for some couples. She
also stated that this style of marriage
enrichment is particularly valuable for
the dual career couple.2

Conclusion

In general, marriage enrichment
programs are helpful and can be rec-
ommended to patients without fear of
the harmful effects that sometimes fol-
lowed the growth and encounter
groups of the 1950s and 1960s. The
weekend retreat format and the en-
couragement of joint future planning
especially valuable for couples
are
who wish to make their marriages
more fulfilling. However, the pro-
grams do have limitations, especially
when there is insufficient emphasis on
the need for individual growth within
marriage.

Intermediate Prescribing Information

WTrasicor®
Slow-Trasicor tablets
(oxprenolol hydrochloride)
Antihypertensive Agent
Actions
TRASICOR (oxprenolol hydrochloride) is a non-cardio-
selective beta-adrenergic-receptor-blocking agent which
possesses partial agonist activity. It is used in the treatment
of hypertension.
Indications
Mild or moderate hypertension. Usually used in combination
with other drugs, particularly thiazide diuretics, however,
may be tried alone as an initial agent in those patients
whose treatment should be started with a beta-blocker
rather than a diuretic. Oxprenolol hydrochloride therapy
should start using TRASICOR (regular formulation), and
once the maintenance dosage has been established,
SLOW-TRASICOR may be substituted (see Dosage &
Administration).
The combination of TRASICOR with a diuretic and/or
peripheral vasodilator has been found to be compatible and
generally more effective than TRASICOR alone. Experience
with other antihypertensive agents has not shown evidence
of incompatibility.
Not recommended for the emergency treatment of
hypertensive crises.
Contraindications
Bronchospasm (including bronchial asthma), allergic rhinitis
during the pollen season, sinus bradycardia and greater
than first degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secon-
dary to pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure,
cardiogenic shock, anesthesia with agents that produce
myocardial depression, e.g. ether.
Warnings
a) Cardiac Failure
Special caution should be exercised when administering
TRASICOR to patients with a history of heart failure since
inhibition with beta-blockade always carries the potential
hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and
precipitating cardiac failure.
At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure,
patients should be fully digitalized and/or given a diuretic,
and the response observed closely. T4ASICOR does not
abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on the heart muscle,
however, the positive inotropic action of digitalis may be
reduced by the negative inotropic effect of TRASICOR
when the two drugs are used concomitantly. The effects of
beta-blockers and digitalis are additive in depressing A-V
conduction. If cardiac failure continues, despite adequate
digitalization and diuretic therapy, TRASICOR therapy
should be immediately withdrawn.
b) Abrupt Cessation of Therapy with TRASICOR
Warn patients against abrupt discontinuation. There have
been reports of severe exacerbation of angina and of
myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmias occurring
in patients with angina pectoris following abrupt discontinu-
ation of beta-blocker therapy. The last two complications
may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of angina
pectoris. When discontinuation of TRASICOR is planned in
patients with angina, TRASICOR should be substituted for
SLOW-TRASICOR and then the dosage should be gradually
reduced over a period of about two weeks and the patient
should be carefully observed. The same frequency of
administration should be maintained. In situations of greater
urgency, TRASICOR therapy should be discontinued in
stepwise manner under closer observation. If angina
markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency devel-
ops, it is recommended that treatment with TRASICOR be
reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily.
c) Various skin rashes and coniunctival xerosis have been
reported. A severe syndrome (oculo-mucocutaneous syn-
drome) whose signs include conjunctivitis sicca and psori-
asiform rashes, otitis, and sclerosing serositis has occurred
with the chronic use of one beta-adrenergic-blocking agent,
practolol but has not been observed with TRASICOR or any
other such agent. Physicians should be alert to the possi-
bility of such reactions and should discontinue treatment
in the event that they occur.
d) Severe sinus bradycardia may occur; in such cases,
dosage should be reduced and the use of atropine and
isoproterenol considered.
e) TRASICOR may mask the clinical signs of continuing
hyperthyroidism or its complications; therefore, abrupt
withdrawal of TRASICOR may be followed by an exacerba-
tion of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including thyroid
storm. TRASICOR does not alter thyroid function tests.
Precautions
a) In patients prone to non-allergic bronchospasm (e.g.
chronic bronchitis, emphysema), TRASICOR should be
administered with caution since it may block the bron-
chodilation produced by endogenous and exogenous
catecholamine stimulation of beta2 receptors.
b) Administer with caution to patients subject to spon-
taneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially
those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or
oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic blockers
may mask the premonitory signs and symptoms of acute
hypoglycemia. Dosage of antidiabetic drugs may need
to be adjusted.
c) Adjust dosage appropriately when used in conjunction
with other anti-hypertensive agents.
d) Closely monitor patients also receiving catecholamine-
depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine. The
added beta-adrenergic-blocking action of this drug may
produce an excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.

e) Appropriate laboratory tests should be performed at
regular intervals during long-term treatment.
f) TRASICOR should be withdrawn gradually following the
recommendation given under Abrupt Cessation of Therapy
(see Warnings).
Available evidence suggests all clinical and physiological
effects of beta-blockade are no longer present 48 hours
after cessation of medication.
In emergency surgery, effects of TRASICOR may be
reversed, if necessary, by sufficient doses of such
agonists as isoproterenol or levarterenol.
g) Usage in Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers: Not
recommended in pregnancy or lactation. Oxprenolol
hydrochloride passes into the breast milk.
h) Usage in children: Although experience is limited,
TRASICOR is not recommended for pediatric use.
i) After the active substance has diffused out of the insolu-
ble core of the SLOW-TRASICOR tablet, the empty matrix is
excreted in a softened form and may be found in the feces.
Adverse reactions
Cardiovascular:
Congestive heart failure (see Warnings); pulmonary edema,
cardiac enlargement; secondary effects of decreased car-
diac output which include: synpope, vertigo, lightheaded-
ness and postural hypotension,- severe bradycardia;
lengthening of PR interval;
Second and third degree A-V block; sinus arrest; palpita-
tions; chest pains; cold extremities; Raynaud's phenomenon;
claudication; hot flushes.
Respiratory: Shortness of breath, wheezing, bronchospasm,
status asthmaticus.
Central Nervous System: Headache, dizziness, anxiety,
mental depression, nervousness, irritability, hallucinations,
sleep disturbances, including nightmares and insomnia.
Tinnitus, weakness, sedation, vivid dreams, vertigo,
paresthesia and slurred speech.
Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, constipation, flatulence, heart-
burn, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain,
dryness of mouth.
Allergic/Dermatological: (see Warnings)
Rash (psoriasiform and exanthematic); dry skin, pruritus;
sweating.
Ophthalmological: Conjunctivitis, dry eyes, itching eyes,
blurred vision.
Miscellaneous: Impotence, decreased libido, nasal stuf-
finess, weight gain.
Clinical Laboratory: Elevated transaminases, BUN, alkaline
phosphatase and bilirubin have occurred in some patients.
Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia, and hypoglycemia have
also been reported rarely.
Symptoms and Treatment of Overdosage
Symptoms: bradycardia, congestive heart failure, hypoten-
sion, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia.
Treatment: Discontinue TRASICOR and observe patient
closely. If required, the following therapeutic measures
are suggested:
1. Bradycardia: Atropine or another anticholinergic drug.
2. Heart block (second degree or total): Isoproterenol or

transvenous cardiac pacemaker.

3. Congestive heart failure: Conventional therapy.
4. Hypotension (depending on associated factors):

Epinephrine rather than isoproterenol or norepinephrine
may be useful in addition to atropine and digitalis.
5. Bronchospasm: Aminophylline and/or isoproterenol;

or a beta2-adrenergic agonist.

6. Hypoglycemia: Intravenous glucose.
Large doses of isoproterenol can be expected to reverse
many of the effects of excessive doses of TRASICOR.
However, the complications of excess isoproterenol should
not be overlooked.
Dosage and Administration
Initial Dosage: Initiate with TRASICOR (regular formulation),
20 mg t.i.d., followed by upward titration of the dose on a
t.i.d. basis, with increases of 60 mg per day at one- to two-
week intervals until adequate control of blood pressure is
obtained.
Maintenance Dosage: Once the optimal dose has been
established, the total daily dose of TRASICOR (regular for-
mulation) may be given on a b.i.d. schedule, although no
comparison studies between the t.i.d. and b.i.d. regimen
have been carried out. Alternatively, an equivalent single
daily dose of SLOW-TRASICOR may be substituted, and
should be taken in the morning. SLOW-TRASICOR tablets
should be swallowed whole.
Usual Daily Dose: 120-320 mg, should not exceed 480 mg.
