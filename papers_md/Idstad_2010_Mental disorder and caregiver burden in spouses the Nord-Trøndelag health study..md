Mental disorder and caregiver burden in spouses:
the Nord-Trøndelag health study
Mariann Idstad*, Helga Ask, Kristian Tambs

Abstract

Background: Researchers generally agree that mental disorder represents a burden to the family. The present
study concerns the subjective burden of living with a person with mental disorder, more specifically the
association between mental disorder in the index person and subjective well-being and symptoms of anxiety and
depression in the spouse.

Methods: Data were obtained from questionnaires administered to the adult population of Nord-Trøndelag
County, Norway during the period 1995-1997. The present study is based on a subsample where 9,740 couples
were identified. Subjective burden in spouses of persons with mental disorder was compared with subjective
burden in spouses of persons without mental disorder, using analysis of variance (ANOVA). All analyses were
stratified by sex.

Results: Adjusting for several covariates, spouses of persons with mental disorder scored significantly lower on
subjective well-being and significantly higher on symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to spouses of
index persons without mental disorder. Although highly significant, the effect sizes were moderate, corresponding
to a difference in standard deviations ranging from .34 - .51.

Conclusions: Our study supports the notion that there is an association between mental disorder in one partner
and subjective burden in the spouse, but not to the same extent that have been reported in earlier studies, as our
results do not indicate that a large proportion of the spouses reach a symptom level of anxiety and depression
that reflects clinical mental disorder.

Background
The global burden of mental disorder is increasing [1].
Depression alone is reported to be one of the leading
causes of disability worldwide, accounting for 4.4% of
lost years of healthy life due to premature death or dis-
ability (DALYs) on a global basis [2] and 6.2% of all
DALYs in the European Region [1]. Prevalences for
mood- and anxiety disorders within a 12-month period
have been estimated to 9.5% and 18.1%, respectively, in
the United States [3]. Similarly, in Norway almost 10%
of the adult general population has been suffering from
a depression disorder and almost 20% from anxiety dis-
orders during a 12 month period [4]. Prevalence for
anxiety and depression in the European Region at any
point in time has been estimated to 100 million people,
corresponding to 11.5% of the population [1]. The

economic costs of affective and anxiety disorders to
society are substantial, amounting to €147 billion in the
European Region in 2004 [5].

Researchers generally agree that mental disorder
represents a burden to the caregiver and family (for
reviews, see [6-10]). The interest in caregiver burden
emerged when mentally ill patients started to be deinsti-
tutionalized [11]. Caregiver burden refers to the signifi-
cant amount of strain and difficulties experienced by the
caregiver or family of mentally ill people, including a
range of psychological, emotional, social, physical and
financial problems [6,8,12-14]. In the literature, defini-
tions distinguish between subjective and objective bur-
den [15], and this distinction has established itself as a
general guideline for researchers in the field [16]. The
former includes perceived psychological distress such as
feelings of loss, embarrassment in social situations, and
depression, whereas the latter includes the practical and
concrete problems such as reduced social and family

activities and financial difficulties. The present study
focuses on the part of subjective burden that concerns
psychological distress, observed as symptoms of anxiety
and depression and low subjective well-being.

Research on caregiver burden has traditionally focused
on relatives of individuals with severe mental disorders
like schizophrenia (for reviews, see [10,16,17]), bipolar
disorder (for reviews, see [18,19]), and dementia (for
review, see [20]). Although more disorders have been
included in recent research [21], there are few studies
on families of individuals suffering from anxiety and
depression disorders, and it has been pointed out that
there is a lack of research based on large sample sizes
and control groups [19,22-24].

The individuals classified with mental disorder in the
present study are selected on the basis of a high score
on symptoms of anxiety and depression, and having
sought professional help for mental health problems
and/or having reduced functionality as a consequence of
mental health problems. Although some of these indivi-
duals may be suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar
disorder, such cases are likely to be few, as people with
severe mental disorder tend to be underrepresented in
population based studies. It is likely that the majority of
individuals classified with mental disorder are predomi-
nately cases of anxiety and/or depression, as these are
known to be the mental disorders with the highest pre-
valence. However, as the case group may be somewhat
heterogeneous regarding type of illness, the cases will be
referred to as having “mental disorder”. The present
study investigates caregiver burden in spouses, more
specifically the association between mental disorder in
the index person and symptoms of anxiety and depres-
sion and subjective well-being in his or her spouse. As
mentioned above, the spousal symptoms of anxiety and
depression and subjective well-being represent subjective
caregiver burden in our study, and will thus be referred
to as “subjective burden”. Earlier studies on this subject
reported that living with a depressed person puts the
spouse at risk of experiencing elevated levels of psycho-
logical distress and depression and represents consider-
able strain on the marriage [23,25-30].

Studies reporting that the burden of depression is
smaller or more infrequent compared to the burden of
for example bipolar disorder [31], schizophrenia [23] or
dementia [32] may lead to a general perception that
burden is larger for the more severe psychiatric diag-
noses; however, other studies comparing the burden of
depression with the burden of schizophrenia [24] or
found similar amounts of burden.
dementia [33]
Furthermore, a study of partners of people suffering
from anxiety disorders, depression or schizophrenia did
not find any support for a relationship between strength
of burden and type of diagnosis or duration of the

illness, but rather between burden and level of impair-
ment in everyday functioning [34]. However, in this
study there was a selection bias; the spouses chosen for
participation all had partners who were undergoing
institutional treatment and thus had severely impaired
everyday functioning.

There are mixed findings in the literature regarding
the association between caregiver’s age and burden; it
has been suggested that this might be due to differences
in the intensity of the relative’s illness in each study so
that crisis conditions may produce a greater burden
regardless of age, whereas stable conditions may not
produce a great burden in elderly caregivers due to
more experience in dealing with the illness [6]. Accord-
ing to this notion, we expect elderly partners to report a
lower amount of burden than younger partners because
the individuals classified with mental disorder in the
present study are likely to suffer from anxiety and
depression disorders that tend to recur and thus make
for a fairly stable condition. In a similar vein, we expect
partners who have been married for many years to
report a lower amount of burden than do partners who
have not been married for many years.

A priori it is far from obvious that there exists a sex
difference in the strength of subjective burden. On one
hand, it is well established that women tend to suffer
from depression to a greater extent than men, which
may imply that they are more vulnerable to certain bur-
dens, but on the other hand, women also tend to have
larger social networks and receive more social support.
Some previous evidence shows that female spouses of
mentally ill husbands tend to report greater levels of
depression than vice versa (see e.g, [35]), however, one
meta-analysis focusing predominately on dementia care-
givers found small to very small gender differences [36].
The literature on caregiver burden on affective disor-
ders and spousal mental health overlaps with other lit-
erature concerning depression in couples. For example,
a recent review on health concordance within couples
[37] reported overwhelming evidence for concordant
couple mental health, especially regarding depressive
symptoms, and showed that affective contagion is one of
the explanations that are most frequently used. Assorta-
tive mating - that people tend to select life partners that
share similar characteristics as themselves - is also a
possible explanation of observed spouse similarity for
mental health [37]. Furthermore, depression in spouses
is strongly associated with marital distress, and new
models are now studying the importance of the inter-
personal aspects of depression, such as social interaction
and marital quality [38]. Unfortunately, our data do not
permit us to integrate these perspectives into our study.
Based on previous research, we hypothesize that there is
an association between mental disorder in the index

person and increased levels of symptoms of anxiety and
depression and decreased levels of subjective well-being in
the spouse, compared to couples in which the index per-
son does not suffer from mental disorder. Furthermore,
we expect elderly partners to report a lower amount of
burden than do younger partners, and equivalently, part-
ners who have been married for many years to report a
lower amount of burden than do partners who have been
married for a few years. We will also explore eventual gen-
der differences. To the best of our knowledge, the present
study is the first population based study to investigate the
association between anxiety and depression disorders in
one spouse and mental health in the other spouse within
the field of caregiver burden research.

Methods
Sample
The present study is based on data from the Nord-
Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway. Approval to
use the data was provided by the HUNT Research Cen-
tre. The population in the county of Nord-Trøndelag is
fairly representative of the Norwegian general population.
All inhabitants in Nord-Trøndelag county above the age
of 19 were invited to participate. The present study is
based on HUNT 2, the second wave of data collection,
which was carried out in 1995-97. Out of the 94,194 indi-
viduals that were invited to the study, a total of 92,936
were eligible for participation, of which 66,140 partici-
pated (71.2%). A questionnaire, Q1, was attached to the
mailed invitation and returned at the examination site. A
second questionnaire, Q2, was handed out during the
examination and returned some days after by pre-paid
mail. 57,315 of the participants (86.7%) returned Q2. The
sample is described in detail elsewhere [39].

In a subsample of HUNT 2, including 17 of the 24
municipalities in the county, data on an abbreviated ver-
sion of SCL-25 [40] were available. 51,574 persons
(62.8%) participated, and the subjects’ age ranged from
20 to 101 years (mean = 50.2, SD = 17.0). A detailed
description of the sample is available elsewhere [41]. The
governmental statistics agency, Statistics Norway, used
the 11-digit personal identification number assigned to
Norwegian citizens to identify registered couples. For the
purpose of the present study, only individuals from cou-
ples with valid data on the outcome measures symptoms
of anxiety and depression (SCL) and subjective well-being
(SWB) were included, resulting in a sample of 9,740
mixed-sex couples (48.8% of all the couples invited).
Characteristics of the sample are reported in the results.

Measures
Symptoms of anxiety and depression
Symptoms of anxiety and depression during the last two
weeks were measured by ten of the 25 items in the

Symptom Checklist-25 [40]. Four questions tap anxiety
(Suddenly scared for no reason; Feeling fearful; Faintness,
dizziness, or weakness; Feeling tense or keyed up) and six
tap depression (Blaming yourself for things; Difficulty in
falling asleep or staying asleep; Feeling blue; Feeling of
worthlessness; Feeling everything is an effort; Feeling hope-
less about future). Response categories range from “not at
all”, scored 1, to “extremely”, scored 4. This ten item ver-
sion has been observed to correlate .97 with the original
version, in an available subsample from HUNT 1 [42].
Cronbach’s alpha was .84 for men and .86 for women.
Criteria of mental disorder in the index person
The data in HUNT 2 are not informative on who meets
the criteria of a diagnosis. Thus, strict criteria including
both SCL and other information were developed in
order to identify index persons highly likely to suffer
from mental disorder. A dichotomous combined variable
(case/not case) was coded as positive if the following
two criteria were met: 1) A score of 20 (corresponding
to an average score across items of 2.0) or higher on the
SCL (range 10-40). This criterion is stricter than the
mean score of 1.75 across items commonly used as a
SCL-25 cut off score for “severe depression”. 2) A score
of 1 or higher on an indicator of mental health pro-
blems consisting of two items; “reduced functionality
due to mental health problems” (range 1-3: “A little”,
“quite a deal”, “a lot”) and “having sought professional
help for a mental health problem” (range 0-1, no/yes).
We added this criterion in order to be reasonably sure
that we would correctly identify cases of mental disorder
and avoid false positives. The choice of such a strict
combination of criteria inevitably causes some loss of
true positive cases from the case group to the non-case
group. However, this modest contamination of the non-
case group cannot substantially change the difference
between the two groups. This resulted in a total of 540
cases; 357 women and 183 men, corresponding to 2.8%
of the present sample, which is substantially lower than
regular prevalence estimates [4]. The low prevalence
rate, implying that our criteria are strict, indicates that
our case group is relatively free from false positives.

Data from a previous HUNT study taking place 11
years earlier on a crude indicator of symptoms of anxi-
ety and depression described elsewhere [42], were avail-
able for 23,095 of the HUNT 2 participants. To further
ensure that we had managed to identify cases with
severe and relatively persistent mental disorder, we
investigated whether the cases also had a high score on
anxiety/depression in HUNT 1. Even 11 years earlier the
cases on average scored 1.48 SD higher on anxiety/
depression compared to the other population.
Subjective Well-Being
Subjective well-being was measured by a three-item
indicator that has been proven reliable in previous

studies (i.e, [43]). Answers were given on a 7-point scale
ranging from “very satisfied” to “very unsatisfied”. The
questions were phrased as follows: When you think
about your life at the moment, would you say that you
are by and large satisfied with life, or are you mostly dis-
satisfied?; Would you say you are usually cheerful or
dejected?; and Do you mostly feel strong and fit, or tired
and worn out?. The items were standardized and added
as a sum score indicator. Cronbach’s alpha was .77 for
both men and women.
Control variables and confounders
The association between poor mental health in the
index person and the mental health in his or her spouse
may be confounded by a number of variables. We
adjusted for spouses’ age, education, years of marriage,
and whether the spouses were also living together with
persons under 18 years of age. Covariates also included
somatic disease and alcohol problems in both index per-
sons and spouses due to the possible confounding effect
on spousal mental health. A sum score indicator was
calculated for a number of somatic diseases including
infarction, angina, stroke, diabetes, difficulty in breath-
ing, epilepsy, cancer, other long term disease, and
impairment of motor ability, vision, hearing or somatic
illness. Alcohol consumption was measured with four
items: How many times a month do you usually drink
alcohol?; How many glasses of beer, wine or liquor do
you usually drink in the course of two weeks? (separate
responses for each category). A summative indicator
was computed in which frequency and total amount of
units were equally weighted.

Treatment of missing values
We used SPSS Missing Value Analysis (MVA), expecta-
tion maximization (EM) for imputation of missing
values in respondents with valid data for at least half of
the items. For SCL, the ten items were used as predic-
tors for each other. Likewise the SWB items and alcohol
items, respectively, were used to predict each other.
Missing values (at least one item missing) were reduced
from 15.3% to 8.9% for the SCL indicator, from 4.9% to
1.6% for the SWB indicator, and from 12.3% to 2.6% for
the alcohol consumption indicator. Regarding years of
marriage/cohabitation, valid data were available only for
married couples and not for unmarried couples, who
corresponded to 8.1% of the present sample. Missing
values were reduced to 0.1% by placing respondents
younger than 35 years in the category “married less than
10 years”, respondents 35-44 years in the category “mar-
ried 10-20 years” and respondents 45 years and up in
the category “married more than 20 years”. This classifi-
cation was empirically tested in pairs with valid data on
marital duration and gives 17% misclassification. If the
unmarried couples are similar to married couples in

terms of duration of the relationship, then 268 indivi-
duals would be misclassified according to this classifica-
tion. 2.7% of the respondents did not report level of
education and were placed in the lowest level of educa-
tion. Missing values for the variable “Living with persons
under 18 years” were placed in the category “not living
with persons under 18”.

Design and statistical analyses
The present study applies a cross-sectional design, inves-
tigating subjective burden, observed as low subjective
well-being and symptoms of anxiety and depression, in
spouses of index persons suffering from mental disorder.
Multivariate ANOVA (SPSS General Linear Models, Uni-
anova) was conducted for each of the two outcome mea-
sures, SCL and SWB. Mental disorder in the index
person was entered as a dichotomous factor (case or not
a case), adjusting for spousal age, education, years of
marriage, living together with persons under 18 years of
age, and also adjusting for somatic disease and alcohol
problems in both index persons and spouses. Because of
the double entry file structure (each participant in the
study was included both as an index person and as a
spouse), all analyses were run stratified by sex. Thus, one
set of analyses estimated the association between mental
disorder among male index persons and subjective bur-
den in their female spouses, while the other estimated
the relation between mental disorder in female index per-
sons and subjective burden in thier male spouses.

An association between mental disorder in the index
person and spousal subjective burden might vary with
the spouses’ own age, years of marriage, and whether
they are living together with persons under 18 years of
age. Accordingly, interaction terms between mental dis-
order in the index person and the spousal variables
were tested.

The SCL scores were highly skewed, and were ln-
transformed to obtain closer to normal distributions.
The dependent variables, SCL and SWB, were standar-
dized before used in the analyses. The unstandardized
regression coefficients (b) therefore show adjusted group
mean differences scaled in fractions of a standard devia-
tion (SD) for the dependent variables.

Results
Mean age was 53.4 years (SD = 14.42) for men and 50.8
years (SD = 14.26) for women. Among males, 35.9%
were in the age group 20-44 years, 45.5% in the group
45-64 years, and 18.6% in the group 65 years or more.
The corresponding percentiles for women were 43.5%,
43.7%, and 12.8%. Mean score on SCL (range 10-40)
was 11.89 (SD = 2.93) for men and 12.83 (SD = 3.65)
for women. Mean score on SWB (range 1-7) was 5.18
(SD = .86) for men and 5.09 (SD = .87) for women.

The correlation between husbands’ and wives’ loga-
rithmically transformed SCL scores was 0.16, and the
correlation between husbands’ and wives’ SWB score
was 0.26.

Analyses of variance were run consecutively with the
two outcome variables, spousal SCL and spousal SWB,
in both sex strata. Being a mental disorder case was sig-
nificantly associated with spousal scores on SCL and
SWB for both male and female spouses, and this asso-
ciation remained significant after controlling for spousal
age, education, years of marriage, living together with
persons under 18 years of age, and somatic disease and
alcohol problems in both index persons and spouses.
The nonadjusted and adjusted differences between the
groups in fractions of SDs (b) are presented in Table 1.

Interaction effects
Interaction terms were specified between the case’s
mental disorder and the spouse’s age, years of marriage,
and living together with persons under 18 years of age,
respectively. No significant interaction effects were
detected.

Discussion
The present study aimed at investigating the association
between mental disorder in the index person and spou-
sal subjective burden, based on a large, population based
sample. Because the study is based on cross-sectional
data, we cannot make causal inferences, however the
results show a clear association. Female spouses of cases
with mental disorder scored about half a SD higher on
SCL and male spouses scored about one third of a SD
higher on SCL compared to the remaining population,

and both male and female spouses scored more than
one third of a SD lower on SWB. Although highly sig-
nificant, these are moderate effect sizes. Testing for
interaction effects did not yield any significant results,
which may be due to a lack of power, as very large sam-
ple sizes are required for these kinds of analyses.

Mental disorder and subjective caregiver burden
Because the majority of mental disorders in the commu-
nity are recurrent anxiety and depressive disorders [4], it
is possible that our findings are largely attributable to
index persons with these disorders. Our results show
that the spouses of these persons report higher levels of
symptoms of anxiety and depression and lower levels of
subjective well-being compared to the other population,
and may thus support earlier studies which found that
spouses of depressed individuals are at risk of develop-
ing depression themselves [23,25-30].

As we did not have the possibility of identifying cases
of
for example bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or
dementia, we could not compare the burden of anxiety
and depression disorders with the burden of any of
these disorders. This makes it difficult to relate our
results to findings from other studies comparing the
burden of different disorders. However, it could be
argued that the moderate effect sizes found in our study
indicate that anxiety and depression disorders are not
associated with a very heavy burden, and that this lends
some support to previous results showing a smaller bur-
den associated with depressive disorders than other dis-
orders [23,31,32].

Furthermore, the cases in the present study were
selected on the basis of strict criteria reflecting recurrent
mental health problems, and our results could thus be
compared with the study which concluded that it was the
degree of impairment and not diagnosis per se that caused
burden in the spouses [34]. Even though we have probably
succeeded in identifying cases with severely impaired daily
functioning, the effect sizes were moderate.

In sum, the present study shows that there is an asso-
ciation between mental disorder in one person and
spousal symptoms of anxiety and depression. This sup-
ports the notion that mental disorder may represent a
burden to the spouse, but not to such a great extent
that has been indicated in some earlier studies (e.g,
[34]). The moderate effect sizes in the present study do
not at all imply that a large part of the spouses of the
cases reach a symptom level of anxiety and depression
that reflects clinical mental disorder. What is more, as
opposed to clinical studies, population based studies
may yield more valid results because the participants are
unaware of the study’s purpose and thus, are not
inclined to produce responses biased by being reminded
and focused on a negative aspect of their life. However,

Idstad et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:516
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/10/516

Page 6 of 7

the results show a clear association which should not be
ignored. Imperfect measurement precision and sample
selection against depressed persons may have deflated
the estimates. Furthermore, even if mental disorder on
average did not appear to be strongly related to spousal
subjective burden, it may well be in some couples.

Gender differences
It is well known in the literature that women tend to
suffer from anxiety and depression more frequently than
men. This is also true for the present study; the female
cases with mental disorder outnumbered their male
counterparts. But, interestingly, the association between
mental disorder in the index person and spousal subjec-
tive burden appears to be similar in men and women.
Although the difference in SCL score between wives of
husbands with or without mental disorder was larger
than the difference in SCL score between husbands of
wives with or without mental disorder, the moderate
effect sizes in sum show a similar pattern. This supports
earlier findings of small to very small gender differences
[36] and indicates that although more women than men
tend to suffer from anxiety and depression, the strength
of the association between mental disorder in the index
person and spousal subjective burden is similar in men
and women. It does make sense that living with a
depressed person may be associated with subjective bur-
den in the partner regardless of his or her gender.

Methodological considerations
As mentioned earlier, population based studies concern-
ing anxiety and depression disorders in one partner and
caregiver burden in the spouse are practically absent in
the literature to date. The present study is based on a
large, representative sample and the dependent variables
are based on well known, validated measures. Mental
health was measured both by SCL and SWB; these mea-
sures may be claimed to essentially represent opposite
ends of the same positive/negative affectivity dimension.
Still, applying both may yield more complete informa-
tion because SCL is mainly sensitive to the pathological
part of the affectivity distribution, whereas the SWB
scores are sensitive also to the happy part of the distri-
bution. Consequently, our study yields important infor-
mation considering mental disorder and subjective
burden in spouses. However, there are some limitations.
The data are not based on diagnoses; hence it is not
possible to safely establish whether all index persons
classified as cases actually do suffer from a clinical men-
tal disorder. Nevertheless, strict criteria used in identify-
ing individuals with mental disorder probably imply that
the vast majority of the persons classified as cases have
severe mental health problems. It is also impossible to
determine the proportion of cases who suffer from even

more serious illnesses than anxiety or depression, like
bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, but it is not likely
that more than a small fraction of individuals with such
diseases have participated in the survey. Although the
results show a significant association between mental
disorder in the index person and spousal subjective bur-
den, it is not possible to conclude about the causal
direction due to the study’s cross-sectional design.
Another limitation is the lack of validated instruments
designed to measure the extent of caregiver burden;
however, psychological distress is clearly included in the
definition of subjective burden. Likewise, we were not
able to separate couples who receive help and support
from couples who do not receive any help, thus the
association in the couples without support may be
stronger than shown by our results.

Conclusions
The present study shows that spouses of persons who
are suffering from mental disorder report significantly
higher levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression and
significantly lower SWB than do spouses of persons not
suffering from mental disorders, although the effect
sizes are moderate. This supports earlier research
regarding caregiver burden and depression in spouses.
However, our results do not indicate that a large pro-
portion of the spouses reach a symptom level of anxiety
and depression that approaches clinical mental disorder.
Moreover, the results in the present study indicate that
the strength of the association between mental disorder
in the index person and spousal subjective burden is
similar in male and female spouses. Although issues of
caregiver burden are receiving increased attention, there
is still a strong need of studies of the burden of mental
disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. Research-
ers studying mental disorder and caregiver burden in
couples should also, contrary to what our own data per-
mit, try to address alternative explanations of partner
resemblance in mental health, like assortative mating,
effects of marital quality, and circularity of symptoma-
tology in which symptoms in the spouse as a conse-
quence of symptoms in the index person in turn may
worsen the index person’s symptoms. Disentangling the
different sources of spouse resemblance would contri-

epidemiological and longitudinal studies and studies
from different cultures are needed.
