patients with psoriasis: a scoping review

Xiu- jie Zhang,1,2 Jingrong Lin,2 Li Feng,3 Minxing Ou,2 Fu- qing Gong1

ABSTRACT
Objectives  Healthcare ultimately aims to eradicate 
diseases and restore normality to people’s lives. 
However, until this is achieved for every person, there 
is a need to support and assist patients with psoriasis 
using non- pharmacological interventions. These 
‘adjuvant’ approaches have received little attention, 
whereas dermatologists and researchers strive for 
better pharmacological therapy. Here, we aimed to 
perform a scoping review to identify and catalogue non- 
pharmacological interventions for patients with psoriasis.
Design  A scoping review.
Setting  All healthcare settings.
Search strategy  EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO 
and Scopus databases were searched from their inception 
to June 2022. Irrespective of the study type, the studies 
included non- pharmacological interventions for patients 
with psoriasis. This theme was extracted from the included 
articles. Two reviewers independently screened and 
analysed the data.
Results  From 1322 initial records, 71 studies 
were identified and analysed. Non- pharmacological 
interventions for patients with psoriasis include two levels: 
organisational and individual. The organisational non- 
pharmacological interventions included the nationwide 
healthcare model (PsPSP, ProvenCare, German PsoHealth 
and Psoriasis Network, IMPROVE model and PsoWell 
clinic), innovative teledermatology models (mHealth app, 
electronic Targeted Intervention for Psoriasis study and 
therapist- guided internet- based cognitive and behavioural 
treatments) and multidisciplinary interventions. The 
individual non- pharmacological interventions included 
educational interventions (therapeutic patient education, 
psychoeducational intervention and self- management 
education), psychosocial interventions (cognitive and 
behavioural treatments, self- help and peer- to- peer 
support programmes) and others (happify and motivational 
interviewing- based training).
Conclusions  Based on previous literature, a nationwide 
healthcare model protocol was constructed for patients 
with psoriasis. This provided the direction for developing 
a new psoriasis healthcare model and a basis for 
summarising the non- pharmacological interventions 
for patients with psoriasis, which helps them adjust to 
changes in the skin disease.

INTRODUCTION
Psoriasis  is  a  common  chronic,  relapsing, 
immune- mediated 
inflammatory 
skin  condition  affecting  >125 million  people 
globally.1  2  Approximately  30%  of  patients

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This  review  included  studies  conducted  in  dif-
ferent  settings,  which  emphasised 
the  non- 
pharmacological  interventions  for  patients  with 
psoriasis.

 ⇒ It is the first scoping review on a nationwide health-

care model of patients with psoriasis.

 ⇒ A scoping review method was chosen to include dif-
ferent study designs. Therefore, it does not involve 
a detailed critical appraisal of individual studies or 
meta- analyses.

 ⇒ Considering the partial databases selected and the 
non- inclusion of grey literature, the results are used 
only as an overview of the field.

 ⇒ The study was not designed to assess methodolog-

ical quality.

with psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis, 
and the comorbid risk of developing cardio-
vascular,  chronic  kidney  and  inflammatory 
bowel diseases, malignant tumour, infection, 
metabolic  syndrome  and  a  mental  disorder

Recently, many scholars have explored the 
healthcare  model  (HCM)  for  patients  with 
psoriasis.  A  PsPSP  model  of  high- quality, 
holistic,  patient- focused  healthcare 
life-

clinic  were  established.10  11  To  promote  the 
conversion of psoriasis evidence, ProvenCare

aimed at the obstacles in the implementation 
of  evidence,  such  as  a  lack  of  standardised 
disease  severity  scores,  standardised  treat-
ment  methods  and  uniform  fees  for  non- 
pharmacological  interventions  in  electronic

German  Psoriasis  Network  (PsoNet)  was  initiated  to 
improve the quality of care in patients with psoriasis.13 An 
IMPROVE model was established in Denmark for patients 
with  psoriasis  and  articular  psoriasis  to  ensure  they  get 
the  best  care  and  eliminate  inappropriate  incentives  in 
the  current  compensation  system.9  Notably,  many  non- 
pharmacological interventions, such as multidisciplinary 
teams,6  14  15  educational 
interventions  (therapeutic 
patient  education,  psychoeducational  intervention  and 
self- management  education),2  6  14–40  psychosocial  inter-
ventions (cognitive and behavioural treatments, self- help 
and peer- to- peer (P2P) support programme)6 15 18 22 24 41–55 
and others (happify and motivational interviewing- based 
training) have proven to be effective.44 56

However, no systematic review of non- pharmacological 
interventions  for  patients  with  psoriasis  has  been 
performed. This scoping review aimed to identify various 
non- pharmacological  interventions  for  patients  with 
psoriasis by mapping existing literature in the field. It also 
provided a basis for constructing a protocol for HCM and 
summarising non- pharmacological interventions to assist 
patients with psoriasis in adjusting to changes.

METHODS
A scoping review can examine and clarify broader areas 
than that of a systematic review; therefore, it was chosen 
to  allow  for  the  inclusion  of  different  study  designs. 
Following  the  methodology  model  proposed  by  Arksey 
and O’Malley, various pieces of evidence were mapped.57 
This review follows the PRISMA- ScR guidelines58 included 
in online supplemental material 1. The other steps used 
are organised as follows.

Stage 1: identifying the research questions
This  scoping  review  aimed  to  identify  various  non- 
pharmacological interventions for patients with psoriasis 
by mapping existing literature in the field. It provides a 
basis for constructing a protocol for HCM and a founda-
tion for summarising non- pharmacological interventions 
to help patients with psoriasis adjust to changes.

Stage 2: identifying relevant studies
The  search  strategy  involved  consulting  information 
specialists, the preretrieval of databases and project team 
discussions  (online  supplemental  material  2).  EMBASE, 
PubMed,  CINAHL,  PsycINFO  and  Scopus  databases 
were chosen and retrieved from their inception to June 
2022 for publications with no language limitations. They 
covered  a  wide  range  of  subjects,  including  medicine, 
psychosociology  and  nursing.  EndNote  was  applied  to 
exclude duplicate records and incorporate the included 
literature.

Stage 3: selecting the literature
The inclusion criteria were as follows.

Population
Patients diagnosed with psoriasis by dermatologists.

2

Range of concepts
Non- pharmacological  interventions  for  patients  with 
psoriasis.

Context
Adults aged ≥18 years.

Notably,  all  articles  provided  primary  data  on  non- 
pharmacological interventions for patients with psoriasis 
from  its  inception  to  2022.  First,  to  avoid  missing  valu-
able literature, two researchers conducted three rounds 
of  assessment  that  included  reading  study  titles  and 
abstracts  to  meet  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria. 
Subsequently,  the  full  texts  of  the  studies  identified 
through  screening  were  independently  evaluated  for 
eligibility by two authors. Third, the studies were classified 
for  mapping  based  on  the  definitions  and  descriptions 
of  the  methods  provided  in  the  publication.59  Finally, 
data  extraction  was  performed  by  an  author  (a  Joanna 
Briggs  systematic  review  researcher)  using  a  structured 
form.  Another  author  verified  the  accuracy  of  the  data 
extracted from the included studies. Disagreements were 
resolved through a larger team discussion.

Stage 4: charting the data
A  total  of  71  articles  were  included  in  this  review  and 
subjected  to  data  charting.  The  data  charting  consid-
ered  the  following:  author(s),  publication  year,  country 
of  origin,  study  type,  sample  population,  sample  size, 
intervention  name,  intervention  content,  intervention 
frequency, project implementers, follow- up and outcomes 
of  non- pharmacological  interventions  for  patients  with 
psoriasis.

Stage 5: collating, summarising and reporting the literature
Non- pharmacological  interventions  for  patients  with 
psoriasis include two levels: organisational and individual. 
interventions 
non- pharmacological 
Organisational 
include  a  nationwide  healthcare  programme,  innova-
tive teledermatology models and multidisciplinary inter-
vention.  Individual  non- pharmacological  interventions 
include educational and psychosocial interventions.

Patient and public involvement
Patients  and/or  the  public  were  not  involved  in  the 
design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans 
of this research.

RESULTS
The search strategy yielded 1322 papers. After excluding 
duplicates  (n=422)  and  eliminating  829  by  a  first  pass 
through the titles and abstracts, potentially relevant liter-
ature was screened in two rounds, resulting in 71 studies 
(figure 1). The characteristics of the included studies are 
summarised  in  table  1.  The  non- pharmacological  inter-
ventions  for  patients  with  psoriasis  from  the  organisa-
tional  and  individual  interventions  are  shown  in  online 
supplemental material 3 (figure 2). Organisational non- 
pharmacological interventions include nationwide HCM,

routine care. The annual psoriasis healthcare conference 
aimed  to  establish  care  goals,  and  a  monitoring  system 
confirmed that the goal- oriented national psoriasis coor-
dination plan could improve the quality of care, reduce 
the  disease  severity  and  improve  patients’  QOL.  There-
fore, an IMPROVE model was established in Denmark for 
patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis to ensure that 
they  receive  the  best  care  and  eliminate  inappropriate 
incentives in the current compensation system.9 Natural

Different nationwide HCMs of patients with psoriasis
Recently,  many  researchers  have  explored  HCM  in 
patients with psoriasis. The PsPSP model of high- quality, 
holistic,  patient- focused  healthcare  lifestyle  and  living 
with psoriasis was established10; personal models in clin-
ical management60 and a PsoWell clinic were also estab-
lished.11  ProvenCare  management  model  in  the  USA 
was  proposed  to  promote  the  conversion  of  psoriasis 
evidence.  It  aims  to  address  obstacles  in  implementing 
evidence, such as the lack of standardised disease severity 
scores,  standardised  treatment  methods  and  uniform 
fees  for  non- pharmacological  interventions  in  elec-
tronic  health  records.12  A  national  plan  was  initiated  to 
improve the quality of care for patients with psoriasis led 
by the German PsoNet and PsoHealth.13 61 62 The patient 
burdens,  economic  impacts  and  care  barriers  were 
systematically analysed from a comprehensive care struc-
ture and process analysis. Guidelines, evaluation systems 
and  treatment  goals  were  also  developed  to  optimise

follow- up was used to collect the main treatment models 
and  disease  burden  of  patients;  medical  and  health 
departments currently use conceptual maps to determine 
patients' concerns about the disease, conduct interviews 
with relevant stakeholders to assess quantitative indicators 
of patients' concerns about outcomes and establish salary 
models for medical and health- related personnel. Canada 
recently launched the psoriasis educational website.39

Innovative teledermatology models of patients with psoriasis
The development of teledermatology provides a broader 
space  for  healthcare  in  patients  with  psoriasis.  Innova-
tive teledermatology models can encourage collaborative 
care,  and  patient  engagement  is  equivalent  to  inperson 
care  for  improving  functional  status  and  psychological 
health  in  patients  with  psoriasis.63–65  A  mobile  phone- 
based  disease  monitoring  application  for  patients  with 
psoriasis  in  combination  with  a  patient  educational 
programme was developed and applied.17 Allay mHealth 
intervention,  a  12- week  bespoke  digital  therapeutic 
intervention for patients with psoriasis, is designed as an 
adjunct to medical management of the condition, which 
may  help  patients  improve  resilience,  mood  and  beliefs 
on  their  condition  and  enhance  their  QOL.66  Using  a 
participatory design, the mHealth app supported the self- 
management of patients with psoriasis.65 67 The Electronic 
Targeted  Intervention  (eTIPs  study)  for  patients  with 

psoriasis  was  established.68  The  American  Academy  of 
Dermatology and National Psoriasis Foundation websites 
provided publicly available patient educational materials 
addressing  psoriasis.28  Consequently,  an  internet- based 
cognitive  behavioural  therapy  was  proposed,  consisting 
of  five  flexible  treatment  modules  containing  various 
cognitive and behavioural techniques focused on themes 
that patients with psoriasis often experience, such as itch, 
pain, fatigue, negative mood and social relationships.43 49

Multidisciplinary interventions for patients with psoriasis
The healthcare of patients with psoriasis requires a multi-
disciplinary  team  that  includes  dermatologists,  phar-
macists,  nurses  specialised  in  skin  care,  psychologists, 
physicians,  sports  teachers,  dieticians  and  philosophers, 
among others.6 15 34 56 67 The development and implemen-
tation  of  a  nurse- led  home  phototherapy  programme 
designed to prevent clinical inertia and support patients' 
success  in  learning  self- management  for  their  chronic 
skin  conditions  at  home  and  an  outline  study  protocol 
designed  to  evaluate  the  health  outcomes  and  clin-
ical  resource  utilisation  from  the  home  phototherapy 
programme are necessary.69

Educational interventions for patients with psoriasis
Educational programmes might positively affect the long- 
term  management  of  psoriasis.26  27  29  30  32  70  However,

programme  showed  an  increase  in  knowledge  and  self- 
expertise  in  psoriatic  disease.20  21  23  HautTief  multidisci-
plinary educational programmes may improve the QOL 
and reduce depression in patients with psoriasis or atopic 
dermatitis.15 Based on message framing, the educational 
interventions of patients with psoriasis seem more critical 
for  both  health  literacy  and  increased  patients’  knowl-
edge.6  16  71  Patients  with  psoriasis  may  need  multiple 
approaches  and  repetitions  over  time  to  become  and 
remain  literate  and  become  effective  self- managers.16 
Therapeutic  patient  education  and  self- management 
support  were  provided.23  28  Self- management  education 
included  three  sessions  of  group  classes  for  20–30 min, 
discussions,  educational  booklets  and 
telephone 
follow- up.26  The  educational  interventions  for  patients 
with  psoriasis  include  lectures  on  skin  disease  condi-
tions  (clinical  presentation,  epidemiology,  aetiology 
and  disease  burden),  lifestyle  factors  (nutrition,  sleep 
hygiene,  smoking  cessation,  substance  abuse,  practical 
philosophy,  religion  and  spirituality)  and  psychoeduca-
tion (psychodermatology and coping strategies), among 
others.33 35–38 41 72

an adjunct to conventional treatments may be particularly 
rewarding  for  patients  with  more  severe  pretreatment

and  depression  symptoms.6  18  40  42  51  52  55  CBT  includes

techniques,  relaxation,  imagery  training,  meditation, 
biofeedback and homework assignments.15 22 27 31 46 47 50 54 
After  an  8- week  systematic  psychotherapeutic  interven-
tion,  three  superordinate  themes  emerged:  enhanced 
skills,  reduced  negative

thinking and improved mental and physical health.46 An 
additional 8- week intervention with CBT combined with 
biofeedback increases the beneficial effect of ultraviolet 
B(UVB) therapy in the overall management of psoriasis, 
reduces  the  clinical  severity  of  psoriasis,  improves  the 
level of QOL and lowers the number of minor psychiatric 
disorders.50 Self- help has been found to treat emotional 
disorders in patients with psoriasis effectively.44 78 79 Self- 
help based on compassion and mindfulness is acceptable 
to  users.  It  can  reduce  feelings  of  shame  and  improve 
the QOL in patients with psoriasis.25 43 The motivational

tice.22  34  P2P  supporting  programme  allowed  patients

DISCUSSION
This scoping review analysed the contents of 71 papers with 
twofold  results:  (1)  organisational  non- pharmacological 
interventions  included  nationwide  HCM,  innovative 
teledermatology  models  and  multidisciplinary  interven-
tion,  and  (2)  individual  non- pharmacological  interven-
tions included educational intervention and psychosocial 
intervention,  which  provided  a  basis  for  formulating  a 
protocol of HCM and non- pharmacological interventions 
for patients with psoriasis.

As a refractory chronic skin disease, psoriasis has been 
the  focus  of  researchers  to  meet  long- term  healthcare 
needs  and  reduce  the  disease  burden.80  81  However, 
the  subjective  and  objective  care  needs  and  supply  of 
psoriasis  are  not  ideal.  With  the  rapid  growth  of  psori-
asis  treatment  and  healthcare- related  research,  a  large 
information network has been established.2 82–84 It takes 
approximately 10–20 years for the original evidence to be 
applied in practice, resulting in a gap between evidence 
and practice.85 Therefore, effective interventions cannot 
be applied to healthcare. In contrast, some ineffective or 
harmful interventions are still used, resulting in low effi-
ciency of knowledge transfer, poor care effects, waste of 
health resources and inequality,86 which may also be asso-
ciated  with  the  complexity  of  long- term  healthcare  for 
patients  with  psoriasis.87  According  to  the  Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research, the rudiment 
of  the  care  model  was  constructed.  With  the  patient’s 
(P)  healthcare  needs  as  the  core,  the  PSORIASIS  HCM 
was defined using a care schema (S), organisation form 
(OR),  intervention  (I),  assessment  index  (A)  and  stan-
dardisation process (S) (figure 3).

Individual 

interventions 
non- pharmacological 
included  educational  interventions  (therapeutic  patient 
intervention  and  self- 
education,  psychoeducational 
interventions 
management  education),  psychosocial 
(CBT, self- help and P2P support programmes) and others 
(happify  and  motivational  interviewing- based  training). 
Educational  interventions  for  patients  with  psoriasis  are 
becoming increasingly critical to improve health- related 
QOL,  disease  severity  and  treatment  adherence.  This 
review  included  studies  conducted  in  different  settings, 
which  emphasised  the  non- pharmacological  interven-
tions for patients with psoriasis. A scoping review method 
was used to allow the inclusion of varying study designs, 
and it did not involve a detailed critical appraisal of indi-
vidual  studies  or  meta- analyses.  Considering  the  partial 
databases  selected  and  the  grey  literature  not  included, 
the results were used only as an overview of the field.

CONCLUSION
Research  on  psoriasis  HCM  includes  the  current 
healthcare  situation  from  the  management  perspec-
tive; however, those from the physiological, psycholog-
ical  and  social  perspectives  with  patients'  healthcare 
needs as the core of the relevant research are scarce. 

This review describes HCM and non- pharmacological 
interventions for patients with psoriasis, which could 
contribute  to  developing  new  HCM.  The  HCM 
protocol,  based  on  previous  theory  and  research, 
could  provide  directions  for  care  and  policies  that 
promote the QOL of patients with psoriasis. Further

of  non- pharmacological  interventions  based  on  the 
protocol of the HCM for patients with psoriasis.
