Abstract

Background:  Mental health digital apps hold promise for providing scalable solutions to individual self-care, education, and
illness  prevention.  However,  a  problem  with  these  apps  is  that  they  lack  engaging  user  interfaces  and  experiences  and  thus
potentially result in high attrition. Although guidelines for new digital interventions for adults have begun to examine engagement,
there is a paucity of evidence on how to best address digital interventions for adolescents. As adolescence is a period of transition,
during which the onset of many potentially lifelong mental health conditions frequently occurs, understanding how best to engage
this population is crucial.

Objective:  The study aims to detect potential barriers to engagement and to gather feedback on the current elements of app
design regarding user experience, user interface, and content.

Methods:  This study  used a qualitative  design. A sample of  14 adolescents was asked to  use the app for 1 week and was
interviewed using a semistructured interview schedule. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:  Overall, 13 participants completed the interviews. The authors developed 6 main themes and 20 subthemes based on
the data that influenced engagement with and the perceived usefulness of the app. Our main themes were timing, stigma, perception,
congruity, usefulness, and user experience.

Conclusions:  In line with previous research, we suggest how these aspects of app development should be considered for future
apps that aim to prevent and manage mental health conditions.

Introduction

Background
The rise in common mental health issues among adolescents is
a  distressing  trend.  The  World  Health  Organization  has
estimated  that  20%  of  adolescents  experience  mental  health

conditions, and most of them do not receive or seek appropriate
diagnosis and care [1]. Addressing this concern is an essential
component  of  the  current  global  mental  health  agenda  [2].
Innovative solutions delivered by mental health apps (MHapps)
could represent a feasible solution to tackle this issue.

Ribanszki et al

There  is  already  a  plethora  of  mental  health  mobile  apps
available to adolescents, and the increasing use of smartphones
in  this  group  might  make  these  apps  more  acceptable  and
accessible  [3].  Studies  have  also  suggested  that  complex
app-based  mental  health  interventions  for  adolescents  are
feasible. For instance, in one study, cognitive behavioral therapy
in  the  form  of  SMS  text  messages  was  considered  useful  by
75% of the participants [4]. Moreover, significant engagement
with  MHapps  has  been  shown  in  the  past,  with  nearly
three-quarters of adolescents completing more than 80% diary
entries over the 1-week intervention period [5]. MHapps also
have the potential to reduce barriers to face-to-face help seeking,
including stigma and distress about discussing one’s own mental
health [6]. This aspect of MHapps may be appealing to young
people, given that most adolescents would not seek or pursue
help with respect to mental health through traditional routes [7].

Adolescents’ familiarity  with  mobile  devices  suggests  that
technology-based approaches would benefit them [8]; however,
it is crucial to understand how best to tailor digital interventions
to  make  them  the  most  appealing.  Tucker  and  Goodings  [9]
identified three themes that characterize most current MHapps,
as  follows:  stress-inducing  or  stress-reducing  apps,  apps  for
configuring  the  body  in  space,  and  digital  self-care  apps.
However, apps targeting adolescents likely need to expand into
other  areas  such  as  positive  focus,  customizable  features,
human-human  interaction,  and  easy  access  [3].  In  terms  of
help-seeking  preferences,  adolescents  have  also  expressed  a
desire  for  web-based,  accessible  information  and  health
interventions, which are all technology-based needs rather than
needs  that  can  be  met  via  in-person,  telephone-based,  or
paper-based services [10]. When considering communication
with providers, adolescents preferred email or text over video
communication [11].

Despite their familiarity with digital technologies, engagement
is  generally  low  and  evidence  on  the  usefulness  of  concrete
features  is  still  scarce  [12,13].  In  addition,  engagement  with
MHapps  seems  to  vary  independently  from  the  presence  of
evidence-based features [14]. This raises questions about the
clinical  effectiveness  and  safety  that  undermine  trust  in  both
users and providers [15]. Furthermore, high dropout rates are
generally associated with poor user experience (UX), whereas
the specific components of engaging MHapp design are yet to
be determined [16,17].

Objective
In  this  study,  we  seek  to  identify  the  key  preferences  and
attitudes  of  adolescents  that  future  digital  mental  health
interventions  may  need  to  take  into  account  to  successfully
reach  this  population.  For  this  purpose,  we  used  the  Thrive
mental  health  app,  which  has  an  established  evidence  base

[18,19],  to  explore  adolescents’ perceptions  of  the  potential
usability of such a tool in their everyday life. Using a qualitative
design,  we  gathered  feedback  from  a  sample  of  adolescents
through face-to-face interviews. Specifically, our goal was to
detect potential barriers to engagement and to gather feedback
on  the  current  elements  of  app  design  regarding  UX,  user
interface  (UI),  and  content.  The  long-term  aim  of  this
exploratory  study  is  to  provide  the  foundations  for  creating
digital interventions for adolescents that are equally driven by
clinical rigor and UX to help retain engagement.

Methods

Ethics and Preregistration
This research study was approved by the Roehampton University
ethics board (reference number: PSYC 18/306) and preregistered
as a qualitative protocol (reference number: TCYP171110). All
methodologies adhered to the protocol unless stated otherwise.

Participants and Procedure
We recruited a total of 8 male and 6 female participants (N=14).
Overall, 11 participants were recruited from a local secondary
school attended by approximately 1300 students at the time of
the  study.  Students  were  made  aware  of  the  study  through
combined advertisements in the school. For interested students,
the researchers gave a talk that outlined the overall purpose of
the app and explained that the study was trying to understand
what  features  of  digital  MHapps  were  most  useful  to  keep
students  engaged.  Furthermore,  3  participants  were  recruited
through their parents who were also users of the app and knew
about  the  study.  These  3  participants  were  enrolled  after  an
introductory conversation with the researchers, explaining the
details and the purpose of the study.

Participants in the school were asked to get in touch with the
lead teacher to express their interest in participating in the study.
The  teachers  assessed  whether  the  students  adhered  to  the
inclusion criteria to be a part of the study. Researchers then got
in touch with the lead teacher to schedule a meeting in person
on  school  grounds  to  interview  the  participants.  Participants
who  were  recruited  via  end  users  were  interviewed  over  the
phone.  Consent  forms  for  participants,  parents,  and  teachers
were sent out and returned via email. The information sheets
were sent via email. The participants were interviewed as soon
as  possible  after  they  had  given  their  consent  forms  and  had
used the app for at least 1 week.

All participants were asked to use the Thrive: Feel Stress Free
app (Figure 1) for 1 week as much as they liked. Participants
were asked to turn on their notifications in the app; however,
this was not enforced as a strict inclusion criterion.

Sample Size and Theme Saturation
Although our target sample size was 30, recruitment was stopped
after 13 participants had been interviewed. The reason for this
decision was twofold:

1. Owing  to  unforeseen  barriers  (school  examinations,
holidays, and teacher availability), our initial recruitment
strategy  resulted  in  13  interviews,  and  another  round  of
recruitment would have been needed to reach our intended
sample size.

2. At this stage, we decided to review our sample size estimate

by assessing theme saturation in our data.

We defined saturation as “the point during data analysis at which
incoming data points (interviews) produce little or no new useful
information  relative  to  the  study  objectives”  [20].  Using  an
approach  recently  refined  by  Guest  et  al  [20],  we  set  out  to
estimate how many additional interviews might be needed to
reach theme saturation in our data. As most novel information
is seen early in the coding process and follows an asymptotic
curve  in  qualitative  data  sets  [21],  it  is  possible  to  use  the
occurrence  of  novel  codes  in  each  subsequent  interview  to
estimate the slope of this curve and make an informed decision
about  a  new  recruitment  target  by  systematically  coding
available interviews. However, after the coding of interview 9,
it became apparent that saturation had already occurred and no
further  recruitment  was  necessary.  To  assess  the  saturation,
interviews  were  coded  by  2  of  the  researchers—JASF  and
JK—none  of  whom  took  part  in  interviewing  participants  or
transcribing interviews.

The App
We chose the Thrive app for this study because we considered
its  design  and  UX  elements  as  good  examples  of  the
state-of-the-art  development  principles  in  the  digital  mental
health field. Moreover, one of the authors (JASF) was involved
in the development of the Thrive app, which allowed us easy
access to the app for the purpose of this study.

After opening the app, participants were guided through a short
mood assessment and thought training exercise, which allowed
the app to create a customized cognitive training plan for the
user. The recommended exercise modules (and others) could
be  accessed  after  the  assessment  phase  was  complete.  The
included  modules  were  a  combination  of  guided  relaxation

https://formative.jmir.org/2021/8/e14004

techniques  and  guides  that  provided  further  background  and
recommendations  related  to  the  given  feature,  such  as
meditation,  breathing,  or  self-suggestions.  Exercises  were
explained in detail, and the users were guided through the entire
process  when  practicing  each  module.  Next  to  the  cognitive
training features, participants were able to play games, such as
Zen Garden or word puzzle, aimed to provide a more engaging
UX.  When  finished  with  the  modules,  the  app  also  provided
participants with an overview of their progress where they could
track their mood, practice, and goals. Examples of these steps
are presented in Figure 1.

Data Collection
Data were collected between January and July 2018. Owing to
unforeseen delays, such as school examinations, holidays, and
teacher availability, this was substantially longer than reported
in the protocol. Eligible participants were between the ages of
11 and 18 years, owned a smartphone, used it frequently (more
than 1 hour a day), and did not have an existing diagnosis of a
mental health condition.

During the interview, no one else was present aside from the
participant and the researcher, either in person or over the phone.
We did not interview participants as a focus group because of
the difficulty in organizing this at a convenient time.

The  sessions  were  guided  by  a  semistructured  schedule
(Multimedia  Appendix  1).  The  discussion  began  with
participants’ overall impressions of the app. For example, “what
bits of it [the app] were useful if any” or “which bits of it [the
app] did you dislike?” The schedule then proceeded to more
specific questions if not covered in the overall broad questions.
For example, “what did you think of our avatar” or “what did
you  think  of  the  journal?”  This  was  not  pilot-tested  before
commencing the interviews but was constructed by consensus
between the authors.

Participants were asked when they would engage with the app
during the day, if at all, and at which location this took place.
We asked which barriers and facilitators led them to use the app
less or more frequently. In addition, we asked participants to
list  what  they  would  change  about  the  app  to  make  it  more
interesting.  The  participants  led  the  conversation  though  the
interviewers  ensured  that  the  participants  were  prompted  to
specific  topics  if  previously  missed.  Each  interview  lasted
approximately  20-40  minutes.  No  repeat  interviews  were

conducted. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed
verbatim by SA, FO, RR, and JMB.

Analysis
The interview extracts were analyzed using inductive thematic
analysis [22]. First, interview transcripts were read carefully by
3 researchers (RR, JASF, and KJ) to identify meaningful ideas
relevant to the research topic. On the basis of this, an initial list
of relevant concepts was generated. Second, short segments of
the data, dealing with similar issues or concepts, were identified
and  grouped  together  using  provisional  codes.  At  this  stage,
researchers coded each transcript on their own and could use

different codes for any single data segment. Third, codes were
discussed  and  cross-referenced  between  the  researchers  and
collated into a common framework that allowed for candidate
themes to emerge. Finally, upon review, candidate themes were
grouped  into  main  (or  meta)  themes  that  formed  coherent
meaningful  concepts  across  the  texts.  The  main  themes  and
subthemes were then reviewed and refined using the original
transcripts and linked to participant quotes to ensure that the
final themes indeed formed a coherent pattern across the whole
data  set.  Our  analysis  resulted  in  6  main  themes  and  20
subthemes (Textbox 1).

Results

Overview
One participant was not available for the interview, so our results
included 13 interviews in total. Most participants were White
and  British  (12/13,  92%),  and  1  participant  self-identified  as
being on Asian descent.

We labeled our main themes as follows: (1) timing, (2) stigma,
(3)  perception,  (4)  congruity,  (5)  usefulness,  and  (6)  UX.
Although our aim was to treat these categories as separate, they
are  nevertheless  closely  intertwined  concepts  with  inevitable
overlaps.  The  subthemes  are  referenced  by  their  numbers  in
parentheses in Textbox 1.

Timing
All participants emphasized the importance of time constraints
when engaging with the app. Participants often described their
daily schedule as busy and stressful where they have to get on
with their work. Under these circumstances, using the app often
felt like an extra task where “you do have to make a conscious
effort  to  go  in”  (Participant  5). This  routine  usually  limited
participants to only engage with the app at home, particularly
before bed when there is nothing else left to do; however, this
also led to its own set of issues. It was frequently mentioned
that the app was not being in sync with this kind of schedule:

Generally, I was doing it more in the evenings and
by then I couldn’t, it was giving me like tasks to go
out  and  go  for  a  walk  and  things  and  I  couldn’t
because it was dark outside. [Participant 4]

The  pressure  of  having  a  busy  schedule  also  made  exercise
length  an  important  question.  In  general,  shorter  and  easily
accessible exercises were more appealing, where users could
simply  log  in  and  check  on  themselves by  noting  down  their
mood or completing a quick task. In this context, routine mood

screening  measures  before  accessing  any  particular  exercise
and longer tasks were usually seen as barriers to engagement.
Participants were already conscious of these time restraints even
before  deciding  to  log  in  and  knowing  that  they  had  enough
time to complete a task was seen as an important determinant
of engagement:

I didn’t want to go on the app for a bit because I just
thought ‘this is going to take ages now, as if I knew
I could do one that literally lasts like 4/5 minutes then
I’d just click on that. [Participant 6]

Stigma
Mental  health–related  stigma  was  one  of  the  most  frequent
themes in our data, and it is likely to have a significant impact
on engagement. Stigma primarily emerged through labels such
as weird, uncomfortable, private matter, and ashamed, which
referred  to  feelings  of  embarrassment  and  vulnerability
associated with using a mental health app. Even though these
issues  were  common  to  all,  only  1  participant  mentioned
encountering any negative remark:

There was one goal to go out for a walk and going
out randomly for a walk is a bit weird so you know I
was explaining it to them and they found it a bit silly
at first but then as I was going through it with them
and  explaining  how  it  worked  they  found  it  more
interesting...I  mean  there  was  one  member  of  my
family that still thought of it as still a bit gimmicky.
[Participant 4]

As this negative comment was unique in our data, we saw stigma
as  already  internalized,  which  was  brought  to  the  surface  by
certain situations when using the app.

Most frequently, users were cautious about openly using and/or
talking  about  the  app  among  their  family  and  friends  and  in
public, such as on public transport where the risk of being seen

Ribanszki et al

and labeled was highest. The presence of other people was also
a barrier to performing various exercises, such as deep breathing
or closing eyes, as these activities were seen as uncomfortable
in public. In general, mental health was thought of as a private
matter that belonged behind a closed door.

Thinking of mental health as a private issue also made the app
more  appealing  in  other  ways.  Participants  perceived  that  it
gave them more control over their issues without having to rely
on other people:

I know a lot of teenagers who maybe wouldn’t want
to go to a counsellor or would be ashamed of going
to a counsellor and in this way you’re kind of helping
yourself in your own way. [Participant 12]

Participants also wanted to avoid being seen as a downer who
complains about being stressed and preferred relying on an app
rather than risking social rejection.

Participants  were  also  concerned  about  their  self-perception
when  using  the  app.  Many  of  them  took  issue  with  the  term
mental health app and suggested other labels with less loaded
connotations.  Good  examples  of  such  alternative  terms  were
stress reduction or well-being (app):

I  wouldn’t  say  I  have  something  as  like  a  mental
health issue. I think it is more just being stressed, I
think  people  wouldn’t  look  at  it  the  same  way.
[Participant 13]

Some  participants  felt  that  having  any  issues  is  in  itself
problematic and question the utility of engaging with them:

I  thought,  like,  sometimes  stuff  you  didn’t  really
realise you’d thought about was there and it’s a bit
depressing to think about that. [Participant 6]

Perception
Engagement  was  also  closely  tied  to  the  way  participants
perceived the app, most frequently, to whether it was perceived
as  trustworthy.  However,  it  was  not  always  clear  what
trustworthiness  meant.  Some  participants  defined  it  as
professional:

It definitely seemed quite slick and professional rather
than a new app. It seemed like it had a backing to it.
[Participant 6]

Although others described it in contrast to other apps on the
market:

It  didn’t  say  from  the  very  start  that  this  is  some
meditation type hippie app...because you know there’s
other apps out there that come across from the very
start as that kind of thing. And you just think ‘they’re
not going to work.’ [Participant 7]

Participants  also  highlighted  a  fine  middle  ground  between
being too serious on one hand and childish on the other. Most
of  them  picked  up  on  playful design  elements,  which  were
generally considered childish, even though the app was designed
with  adults  in  mind.  One  participant  even  reflected  on  this
sensitivity to being patronized:

https://formative.jmir.org/2021/8/e14004

XSL•FO
RenderX

Teenagers  always  get  funny  about  things  being
childish. Especially like slightly younger 14-year olds.
They wouldn’t want to feel like it was for children at
all. [Participant 9]

Conversely,  participants  also  did  not  like  the  medical label
attached to the app, which may be perceived as too serious:

I think for lots of people who aren’t necessarily that
comfortable talking about mental health and all that
would  feel  almost  slightly  uncomfortable  by...when
they are gonna download it and says it is medical.
You don’t like feeling like that; like they have got a
problem. [Participant 8]

Following design, a common element was the way participants
viewed the role that an app like this should play in their daily
life. When asked about how they would describe it to a friend,
a  “use  it  only  when  you  feel  stressed”  approach  was
overwhelmingly popular:

I described it as like a self-help, meditation app that
you could use in stressful situations. [Participant 1]

Although the app itself was created with structured skill building
in mind, the default perception was that it should be used as a
quick check-in tool or quick intervention when one is anxious
or needs immediate support.

Congruity
Congruity describes some of the key areas where the design of
the app (both UX and UI) proved to be confusing or working
against its intended purpose. A common experience that seemed
off-putting  to  users  was  when  the  design  of  various  features
was  not  in  line  with  its  actual  content.  The  most  frequently
mentioned examples were the relaxation exercises; a participant
illustrated this as follows:

In comparison to the really slow breathing and stuff,
a fast-moving thing (background) just seemed really
big at the time. [Participant 6]

Along the same lines, participants also found looking at a screen
problematic right before going to sleep—one of the most popular
times to use the app—as its negative effects may do more harm
than good and missed the option of a voice-only session for this
situation.

In addition, on the UX side, participants preferred more guidance
from the app, as without it—or without preexisting knowledge
of mental health and therapeutic techniques—some sections of
the app proved too complex:

I found the meditation section kind of overwhelming
at  first.  Because  there  are  so  many  options.  And  I
found I didn’t know quite which one to start with and
then carry on with. [Participant 12]

These types of problems can be overcome by clear signposting
and well-designed user journeys; however, for some participants,
this aspect has proved confusing as well:

...when you log in it’s not as straightforward to follow
the  instructions  or  like  when  you  first  log  into  it.
[Participant 1]

Ribanszki et al

Usefulness
Going beyond content and design, the usefulness theme refers
to common patterns in participants’ subjective experiences that
either  contributed  or  hindered  effective  engagement  with  the
app. Many pointed to the positive effects of having a sense of
control when it comes to mental health. Therefore, the fact that
they  were  able  to  do  something about  their  problems  was  in
itself beneficial:

So, it felt like I was like actively going out and helping
myself...rather than me just thinking “oh my goodness
I’m just swamped,” I’m actually making an effort to
climb out of this mess. [Participant 4]

Along the same lines, exercises were also most beneficial when
users clearly understood their purpose and saw their progress:

Because you can kind of start to see if anything is like
changing. If you know what it’s trying to achieve and
how it’s trying to achieve that, then you can kind of
measure  how  it’s  working.  So,  yeah  I  think  it  was
useful to know what it’s doing and what it’s trying to
help you think about. [Participant 2]

Although having control over a problem was generally seen as
a good thing, predefined situation labels were generally seen as
a step too far. Common complaints were that these labels were
often  simply  wrong,  too  restrictive, or  not  accurate  enough,
and although predefined labels were also useful for many, the
participants suggested adding the option of having their own
labels:

I  did  like  the  idea,  but  I  felt  if  we  were  allowed  to
write our own responses instead of choosing one it
would be more powerful. [Participant 9]

Having  the  choice  of  selecting  from  predefined  automatic
thought labels also proved problematic for some users, especially
if they were already in a negative mood:

...when I was in a bad mood it would ask me what I
was thinking before I hit that bad mood and some of
them were quite extreme. So, I latched onto the quite
extreme version of what I was thinking. [Participant
4]

Others  also  described  similar  experiences  related  to  mood
questionnaires, pointing to a situation where the app might even
cause extra distress, by highlighting existing problems:

I might not even realise I’d been thinking about, like
worrying  about  doing  this  and  that.  Not  really
realising, more subconscious. And then I click on it
and I realise I actually have been doing that, and it
makes it worse as it explicitly says it. [Participant 6]

Some  users  also  developed  an  association  between  their  low
mood  and  engaging  with  the  app,  which  over  time  even
amplified certain negative states:

...when you’re in a bad mood and you just kinda don’t
say explicitly you don’t necessarily stay in that mood,
but when you click on the app, like a dark cloud or
whatever it is, I then just feel like down. [Participant

Users’ past  experiences  with  certain  exercises,  such  as
meditation,  proved  to  be  a  strong  contributor  to  the  kind  of
features they liked and visited frequently. This also underlines
the appeal of activities where users know what and why they
are doing. Beyond meditation exercises, the most valued features
were reminders, relaxation or sleep exercises, the mood tracker,
and the peer support or communication function.

UX Theme
This final theme highlights some of the emergent contradictions
and  alignments  between  current  trends  in  app  design  and
participants’ subjective experiences in 2 key areas: gamification
and personalization.

With regard to gamification, users saw games in this context as
either  neutral  or  counterproductive,  although  there  was  one
participant  who  suggested  that  games  should  be  more
competitive rather than calming. Outside of the concrete games,
users  also  did  not  make  much  use  of  other  soft gamification
features, such as the point system, whereby users were able to
unlock  new  achievements  and  earn  credits.  This  progression
system, without real tangible rewards, did not make sense to
the  participants.  Conversely,  specific  features  of  progression
systems,  with  which  participants  were  able  to  unlock  new
content  based  on  their  achievements,  were  generally  seen  as
useful  in  creating  a  sense  of  progress  and  contributing  to
engagement:

The  games  in  the  app  are  definitely  more  fun  and
enjoyable because I can feel better benefit from them
whereas with other puzzle games I just get frustrated
if I can’t do it. Whereas with on the app, I think, if I
can’t do it, I just keep going. There is no frustration
in it. [Participant 2]

Participants  valued  the  ability  to  personalize  their  own
experiences by setting their own background to creating their
own  character.  They  also  wanted  the  opportunity  to  send
personal messages to one another and did not see much value
in sending or receiving prepopulated messages:

So it would be quite nice to have that feature where
you could talk to people. Sort of like a news column,
where you could put your queries or ask the app and
you could put in your questions and they answer back
and you can do it vice versa. [Participant 10]

Discussion

Principal Findings
We aimed to understand adolescents’ preferences when engaging
with  digital  mental  health  interventions  using  semistructured
interviews. Using these data, we developed 6 main themes and
20  subthemes  that  captured  distinct  aspects  of  adolescents’
experiences  with  the  Thrive  app.  Overall,  most  themes
corresponded  well  with  previous  research  in  the  field  [7];
however, we also gained new insights for further exploration.

Adolescents saw the app as helpful. Many expressed that simply
having access to an MHapp was reassuring in itself and proved
beneficial  in  increasing  their  sense  of  self-reliance  and
containing negative moods. Time was a major factor in terms

Ribanszki et al

of  engagement.  Most  participants  reported  having  a  busy
schedule and preferred using the app in the evenings before bed
or  just  for  quick  check-ins during  the  day.  Preferred  features
also  corresponded  with  evening  use  and  underscored  results
from  previous  studies  highlighting  the  need  for  brief  and
easy-to-access features [23].

In terms of specific features and design, participants highlighted
the importance of clarity in both their user journey and available
information,  which  was  also  emphasized  in  previous  studies
[7,23]. Features seemed the most popular and engaging when
either users already had experience with similar exercises, such
as meditation, or when the purpose and goals of a given feature
were clearly defined. We believe these preferences suggest that
clarity of information likely has a direct impact on effectiveness
by providing users with a clear mental map through which they
can progress.

In  contrast  to  previous  studies  that  suggest  reward  and
progression systems as a way of facilitating engagement [23,24],
we  found  a  clear  distinction  between  helpful  and  unhelpful
progression  systems.  In  our  sample,  simple  leveling  or  point
systems were not meaningful to participants if they were not
tied  to  tangible  rewards.  Similarly,  games  did  not  facilitate
engagement  as  users  deemed  them  irrelevant  in  this  context.
This  was  unexpected  given  the  age  of  the  population  and
previous research indicating good acceptability of games in this
context [25]. Most participants endorsed the ability to unlock
new features and levels that provided them with access to new
content and exercises.

Stigma  emerged  as  a  hidden  but  important  barrier  to
engagement. Participants often expressed embarrassment and
feelings  of  weakness  related  to  mental  health.  This  concern,
although not surprising given the associated stigma in the field
[26], led many participants to use the app only in private and
question  how  the  app  was  branded  and  framed.  Participants’
reluctance  to  use  the  app  when  traveling  is  especially
problematic  when  we  consider  that  this  could  be  the  most
obvious opportunity to find the time to engage with a mental
health  app.  As  a  solution,  less  conspicuous  designs  were
suggested.

Other  barriers  mentioned  by  participants  also  converge  with
those  of  previous  research  pointing  out  the  stress-inducing
potential of these apps [9]. Specifically, some participants saw
prepopulated questions about their feelings as stress inducing.
Others  also  felt  that  engaging  with  negative  thoughts,  rather
than  ignoring  them  or  simply  letting  them  pass,  was  not
desirable. However, this seems to contradict previous findings
that praise apps for their ability to increase emotional awareness
[27,28]. This avoidance may hint at a difficulty in enduring or
accepting  any  amount  of  distress.  This  may  stem  from  an
assumption that one should not have to encounter anything that
may  be  distressing  or  difficult  in  life.  We  believe  that  this
potential  unwanted  effect  of  MHapps  deserves  further
investigation, as bringing negative thoughts into awareness is
a  fundamental  aspect  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  and
accepting this initial dip in mood is a prerequisite for effective
engagement [29].

Along the same lines, the majority of participants used the app
only for checkups and as a quick stress reduction tool in acutely
stressful  situations.  This  pattern  of  engagement  is  in  stark
contrast to the skill-based approach to improving mental health
where  users  engage  with  MHapps  to  acquire  the  skill  of
managing their distress on their own and self-soothe. Although
acute  stress  reduction  can  indeed  be  beneficial  in  certain
situations, excessive reliance on this may increase dependence
on an external source of soothing rather than reducing it. We
see this mismatch in user attitudes and intended use as one of
the key points to address in the future if MHapps are indeed to
become scalable additions to therapy.

Finally,  although  previous  studies  often  emphasized  the
importance of customizability [3] and this also emerged as a
desirable feature in our sample, given that time seems to be one
of  the  most  important  factors  influencing  engagement,  this
finding should be approached with caution. Participants may
express their desire for customizability in an interview situation,
but in reality, they may respond better to clearer design, short
interactions with the app, and easy access.

Limitations
Participants  were  only  provided  with  access  to  the  app  for  1
week  before  the  interview,  which  might  have  influenced  the
depth and detail of their experience and limited our conclusions.
However,  given  that  our  main  goal  was  to  detect  immediate,
noticeable  features  that  were  liked  or  disliked,  and  that  we
reached theme saturation in our analysis, we are confident that
this time frame was sufficient to address our question.

Another potential source of bias is the small sample size and
the convenience sample. This may mean that our participants
may  be  overly  similar  in  certain  ways,  having  similar
backgrounds and preferences, which could distort our findings.
Collecting  background  information  from  participants  would
have  enabled  us  to  reflect  on  this  aspect  in  more  detail.
Moreover,  this  information  would  have  also  helped  us  to
adequately contextualize our results. Although our focus of this
qualitative paper was to get a sense of how adolescents may
view a mental health app, more background on demographics
and other participant characteristics would have strengthened
the interpretation of our findings.

Finally, 3 participants were known to the experimenters. This
may  have  caused  some  bias  in  the  study  as  participants  may
have  been  interested  in  the  app  from  the  start  and  had  an
incentive to speak favorably. Although it was made clear that
they would be anonymous and their responses recorded by a
member  of  the  research  team  not  known  to  them,  it  is  still
reasonable  to  assume  that  there  may  be  some  bias  regarding
their experience of the app. However, we did not observe any
differences between the responses of the participants along these
lines.

Conclusions
We identified 6 main themes and 20 subthemes that captured
distinct aspects of adolescents’ experiences with the Thrive app.
Overall,  participants  preferred  convenient,  clear,  and
easy-to-access features that they could use on an ad hoc basis.
They  saw  the  app  as  a  potential  way  of  calming  themselves

when needed rather than as a tool to learn to manage their mental
health. Contrary to our initial assumptions, some specific design
elements, such as the outlook or games, were seen as childish
or useless. Furthermore, stigma emerged as a major barrier when
engaging with the app. This again points to a mismatch between

the intended purpose of the app and the way it is perceived by
its potential users. Future studies with larger sample sizes are
needed to dissect the specific preferences of specific user groups
and  to  outline  concrete  ways  to  address  these  barriers  in  the
digital mental health field.
