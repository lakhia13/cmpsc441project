Abstract: Introduction: Mental illnesses are one of the major contributors to the overall burden of
disease among the young. We investigated the predictors of emotional and behavioral problems
among in-school adolescents in the Indian context. Methods: Using stratified sampling, 1441 ado-
lescents were recruited to participate in the study in Udupi taluk. The study instruments included
a socio-demographic pro forma and the adolescent self-reporting version of the Strengths and Dif-
ficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess the emotional and behavioral problems among them. We
explored the predictors of total difficulties, as well as externalizing and internalizing problems and
gender differences. SPSS version 25 was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics, a Chi-square
test for associations, an independent t-test to explore the gender differences, correlation analysis,
and backward stepwise logistic regression for the predictors were used. Results: The mean age of
the participants was 15.31 ± 0.76. An almost equal percentage of male (49.6%) and female (50.4%)
participants provided data. Abnormal scores were highest under conduct problems (8.5%), and the
total difficulties reached 5.1%. The male participants had higher levels of conduct, hyperactivity,
peer relationship, and externalizing problems the while the female participants experienced higher
levels of emotional and internalizing problems. It was observed that there was a significant positive
relationship between age and emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems,
and total SDQ score. An older age predicted an abnormal total difficulties score and externalizing
and internalizing behaviors, while the type of school predicted the total difficulties and internalizing
behaviors. Conclusion: The age of the adolescent, their gender, and the type of school they attended
emerged as predictors of the emotional and behavioral problems among them.

1. Introduction

Mental health is enshrined in the World Health Organization’s concept of health [1,2].
While mental health conditions are prevalent in all regions of the world, accounting for one
in seven, i.e., 14%, of all mental health conditions, a staggering 75% of individuals living in
low-income and resource-constrained countries are reported to be affected [3]. As per the
National Mental Health Survey of India, which was conducted between 2015 and 2016, the
reported prevalence of mental illness among adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years
old is 7.3% [4]. Mental illnesses are one of the major contributors to the overall burden of
disease among the young, with the number of cases on the rise [3,5,6].

India is home to about 253 million adolescents. Adolescence is a period of rapid
transition, marked by pubertal, physiological, and behavioral changes. Emerging evidence

from India reports a variety of psychiatric morbidities such as depression, anxiety, stress,
and schizophrenia among adolescents. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among
children and adolescents aged between 5 and 14 was 2.6 to 35.6% [7], while 2 to 3% of
the population suffer from serious or incapacitating mental problems [8]. According to a
review conducted in 2019 based on Indian studies, the prevalence of depression ranges
between 1.2% and 21% in clinic-based studies; 3% and 68% in school-based studies; and
0.1% and 6.94% in community studies [9]. The broad range of the reported point prevalence
is attributed to methodological discrepancies among the studies. Singh, M. et al. [10]
assessed the prevalence of depression and the factors associated among school-going
adolescents aged 13–18 and showed that 40% of the adolescents were screened positive
for major depressive disorder: mild depression constituted 29.7%, moderate depression
15.5%, severely moderate depression 3.7%, and severe depression 1.1%. Bansal, V. et al. [11]
estimated the prevalence of depression among adolescents studying at public school
is 18.4%. Research shows that up to half of all mental health conditions begin during
adolescence, and this is a universal phenomenon [2,12,13]. Precursors to emotional and
behavioral problems may include immediate influences including the family, parental
warmth and control [14–17], and peer relationships [18,19]. Hostile parenting is considered
a risk factor for emotional and behavioral problems, whereas consistent parenting is a
protective factor [20]. There is emerging evidence citing gender differences as well in the
manifestation of behavioral problems, with a male preponderance towards externalizing
behaviors and a female preponderance towards internalizing behaviors [21,22]. Behavioral
problems are categorized into internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Internalizing
symptoms are those experienced by the individual, including emotional and peer problems.
Externalizing problems are behaviors aversive to others, such as behavioral problems,
conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, etc. [23]. Neglecting the issue of the rise in
mental health and behavioral difficulties among adolescents approaching maturity may
have long-lasting consequences not just for individuals but for society as a whole. This
necessitates early detection and the referral of adolescents with behavioral difficulties in
order to reduce the severity and duration of their disorders; else, it might add to the existing
burden on the health system. Schools in India are mainly divided into three types, which
includes government, private, and aided. Government schools are governed, funded,
and administrated by the state or central government. Private schools are governed,
funded, and administrated by private organizations. Aided schools are supported by
the government but are managed by private organizations [24]. In the present study,
we explored the predictors of total difficulties as well as externalizing and internalizing
problems and gender differences in all three types of schools.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Approval

Ethics clearance was obtained from the Kasturba Medical College and Kasturba Hos-
pital Institutional Ethics Committee, Manipal, India. Prior to the data collection, written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Permission to conduct the study through the schools was obtained from the Deputy
Director of Public Instructions (DDPI). Further, permission was also obtained from the
block education officers of both the Udupi and Brahmavar blocks.

2.2. Study Setting

The study was conducted in Udupi taluk, Udupi district. There are a total of 462 schools
in Udupi taluk, divided under two blocks, namely Udupi and Brahmavar, with 215 and
247 schools, respectively. Screening of adolescents aged 14–16 years old was performed
among students from government, aided, and private high schools from Udupi taluk
following parental consent and adolescent assent.

2.3. Study Design

A cross-sectional study design was adopted. To estimate a prevalence of mental health
conditions of 12.5% [4] on screening adolescents with a 95% confidence level, 15% relative
precision, and a 10% non-response rate, a minimum of 1328 students needed to be screened.
Lists of the schools in both blocks were obtained from the DDPI’s office. Stratified sampling
technique was adopted, and the schools were stratified into government, aided, and private
schools, following which proportional sampling was performed to achieve a sample size of
1328 students. Schools were selected using simple random sampling. Following permission
from the school authorities, data were collected from all the students in each classroom, as
each class was considered a cluster. Each class averaged 50–60 students in size. Overall,
1441 students provided complete data from 37 schools, including 13 government, 12 aided,
and 12 private schools from the two blocks. A screening question on their history of mental
health conditions was included in the questionnaire. Adolescents with a previous diagnosis
of psychiatric morbidity were excluded from the study. Adolescents identified with mental
health conditions during the screening were referred for further evaluation as required.

2.4. Data Collection Instruments

These included a short socio-demographic pro forma that included questions on age,

gender, type of school, area of residence, and socioeconomic status.

Screening of the high school students was carried out using the Strengths and Diffi-
culties (SDQ) Questionnaire [25]. The tool has been used in several Indian settings. The
questionnaire was translated into Kannada, the local language and is available on the
website at [26].

The SDQ (adolescent version) is a brief, 25-item behavioral screening questionnaire.
The questionnaire is scored on a 3-point scale (0–2), with “0” denoting “Not True” and “2”
denoting “Certainly True”. The questionnaire is divided into five subscales—emotional
symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer relationship problems, and pro-social
behavior. The total cutoff score for the normal category is 0–15; for the borderline category,
it is 16–19; and for the abnormal category, it is more than 20–40. For emotional problems,
the cutoff scores for the normal, borderline, and abnormal categories are 0–5, 6, and 7–10,
respectively. For conduct problems, the cutoff scores for the normal, borderline, and
abnormal categories are 0–3, 4, and 5–10, respectively. For hyperactivity, the cutoff scores
for the normal, borderline, and abnormal categories are 0–5, 6, and 7–10, respectively. For
peer problems, the cutoff scores for the normal, borderline, and abnormal categories are
0–3, 4–5, and 6–10, respectively. For prosocial behavior, the cutoff scores for the normal,
borderline, and abnormal categories are 6–10, 5, and 0–4, respectively.

The English/Kannada versions of the tool were used per the preference of the par-
ticipants. Subgroup analysis was performed to measure externalizing behaviors, which
are a composite of conduct problems and the hyperactivity/inattention domain, and in-
ternalizing behaviors were measured as a composite of emotional symptoms and peer
relationship problems.

2.5. Measurements

School-going adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16 years old were sampled. Prior
to the data collection, the project staff approached the school authorities and sought per-
mission and met the potential participants at the convenience of the school. Following this,
the participant information sheet and parental consent forms were provided to the parents
to provide informed consent. Following this, the school was visited on a predetermined
day to obtain assent from those students whose parents had agreed to provide consent. The
data collection was then completed in the classrooms at the convenience of the school. The
questionnaire was self-administered. The field staff were present to clarify any doubts that
the students had. Following the data collection, the data was cleaned and entered into a
database at the project office.

2.6. Statistical Analysis

SPSS version 25 (IBM, Bangalore, India) was used to analyze the data. Descriptive
analysis and backward stepwise logistic regression were performed to identify predictors.
The Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were performed to compare the proportions, and
significance was set at p < 0.05. An independent sample t-test was performed to assess the
gender differences in relation to the domains of SDQ. Correlation between the age of the
participants and the domains of the SDQ was also performed.

3. Results

A total of 1441 adolescents participated Table 1. A higher percentage of the adolescents
hailed from rural areas (55.3%). Almost equal percentages of male (49.6%) and female
(50.4%) participants provided data. The mean age of the participants was 15.31 ± 0.76 with
15.5% aged 14 years old, 37.2% aged 15 years old, and 47.3% aged 16 years old. About
38.2% studied at government schools, 24% were from aided schools, and 37.8% were from
private schools. The majority of the participants belonged to the below-the-poverty-line
socioeconomic category (55.9%).

Table 2 depicts the self-reported emotional and behavioral problems of the adolescents
across the SDQ domains. The internal consistency of the SDQ total difficulty score was 0.662.
On assessing the total difficulty score using the SDQ, it indicated that most adolescents
scored in the normal category, while 12.7% scored in the borderline category and 5.1% in the
abnormal category. It was observed that the majority of adolescents scored in the normal
category, while 3.1% to 17.8% fell under the borderline category. The fewest abnormal
scores were seen under prosocial behaviors (1.8%), while the most were under conduct
problems (8.5%) (Table 2).

Externalizing behaviors were assessed [27], and 8.3% of adolescents scored in the
“slightly raised” category, 3.5% in the “high” category, and 1.1% in the “very high” cate-
gory. Similarly, internalizing behaviors were assessed, and 17.3% of adolescents scored in
the “slightly raised” category, 6.4% in the “high” category, and 10.8% in the “very high”
category.

Using the Chi-square test, the type of school was found to be significantly associated
with the total difficulty score (p = 0.002) and highly significantly associated with inter-
nalizing behaviors (p < 0.0001). However, externalizing behaviors were not found to be
associated with the type of school (p = 0.07). There were no significant associations found
between urban and rural areas and the SDQ scores.

Table 3 depicts the findings of the independent sample t-test for gender differences in
relation to each of the SDQ domains, as well as externalizing and internalizing behaviors.
Emotional problems were found to be significantly higher among the female participants
(mean = 3.51, SD = 2.07, t = 4.65, p < 0.0001). The male participants scored higher compared
to the female participants in assessing for conduct problems (mean = 2.39, SD1.58, t = 2.28,
p = 0.023), hyperactivity (mean = 3.20, SD = 1.58, t = 3.06, p = 0.002), and peer relationships
(mean = 2.52, SD = 1.48, t = 2.53, p = 0.011). On testing for the mean difference in the proso-
cial scores, it was found that the female participants scored higher (mean = 8.59, SD = 1.45,
t = 4.88, p < 0.0001). The male participants scored higher in terms of externalizing behaviors
(mean = 5.59, SD = 2.80, t = 3.24, p = 0.001), while the female participants scored higher in
terms of internalizing behaviors (mean = 5.83, SD = 2.02, t = 2.02, p = 0.043). In terms of the
mean difference in the total SDQ scores, gender differences were observed; however, this
was not a significant finding. These findings indicate that the male participants had higher
levels of conduct, hyperactivity, peer relationship, and externalizing problems while the
female participants experienced higher levels of emotional and internalizing problems.

Pearson’s correlation was performed between the symptom scales, and it was found
that there was a low positive correlation overall: emotional problems were significantly
correlated with peer problems (r = 0.264, p < 0.001), conduct problems (r = 0.354, p < 0.001),
and hyperactivity (r = 0.354, p < 0.001); peer problems were correlated with conduct
problems (r = 0.340, p < 0.001), hyperactivity (r = 0.216, p < 0.001), and emotional problems
(r = 0.264, p < 0.001); and conduct problems were corelated with hyperactivity (r = 0.305,
p < 0.001). Pearson’s correlation was performed to assess the relationship between the

ages of the participants and the domains of the SDQ. It was observed that there was a
significant positive relationship between age and emotional problems (r = 0.09, p = 0.001),
conduct problems (r = 0.17, p < 0.0001), hyperactivity (r = 0.15, p < 0.0001), peer problems
(r = 0.06, p = 0.03), and total SDQ score (r = 0.16, p < 0.0001). The prosocial domain was not
significantly associated (r = 0.003, p = 0.91).

3.2. Regression Analysis

Predictors of the outcomes were assessed using backward stepwise logistic regression.
Univariate and multivariate analyses of the predictors of total difficulties and externalizing
and internalizing behaviors were performed.

The total difficulties score in the SDQ was assessed for predictors and factors, and the
age of the participants and the type of school. These were found to be significant in the
univariate analysis. These were then adjusted using multivariate analysis. The predictors
of the total difficulties that emerged again included both the age of the participants and the
type of school. In comparison with the adolescents from private schools, those in aided
schools had a higher likelihood of having a higher total difficulties score (AOR 1.65, 95% CI
(1.18–2.31), p = 0.004). These findings are depicted in Table 4.

A subgroup analysis of the externalizing and internalizing behaviors among adoles-
cents was performed. The gender of the participants emerged as a significant predictor of
externalizing behaviors. Being a male adolescent increased the odds of reporting external-
izing behaviors by 1.49 times (AOR 1.49, 95% CI (1.09–2.04), p = 0.013). On assessing the
predictors of internalizing behaviors, the gender of the participant, the age of the partici-
pant, and the type of school emerged as significant predictors. Being a female adolescent
increased the odds of reporting internalizing behaviors by 1.25 times (AOR 1.25, 95% CI
(1.01–1.56), p = 0.048). In comparison with adolescents aged 16 years old, those aged
14 years old had a lower likelihood of reporting internalizing behaviors (AOR 0.68, 95% CI
(0.44–0.89), p = 0.009). Adolescents from aided schools had a 2.09 times increased odds of
reporting internalizing behaviors (AOR 2.09, 95% CI (1.30–3.35), p = 0.002).

4. Discussion

We explored the predictors of behaviors among in-school adolescents aged 14–16 years
old. We assessed the determinants of the SDQ domains, including externalizing and inter-
nalizing behaviors, using self-reports. In brief, we found that the majority of adolescents
scored under the normal category. Borderline scores were the highest in the peer relation-
ship domain (17.8%), followed by the emotional problems domain (7.8%), while in the total
difficulties score, they constituted 12.7%. In assessing for abnormal scores, we found that
they were higher for conduct problems (8.5%) than in the other domains, and abnormal
total difficulties scores reached 5.1% among our in-school participants. In comparison, in a
study among adolescents in the Chinese context, Wang et al. found that a higher proportion
of the participants (17.9%) had a high total difficulties score [28]. Data from the Indian
subcontinent showed that more than a tenth of in-school adolescents reported abnormal
scores in the SDQ in a study by Harikrishnan, U. and Sailo, G.L. in Kollam, Kerala [29].
Nair, S. et al. in their study among in-school adolescents in Anand, Gujarat, found that 15%
of their participants had an abnormal total difficulties score [30], which was higher than our
findings. However, SDQ scores have been found to differ across India in different school
settings, as an observed total difficulties score of 8.35% was reported by Shekhawat, R. et al.
among adolescents in Jaipur, Rajasthan [31].

The predictors of total difficulties in our study were the age of the participants and
the type of school. In our study, younger adolescents aged 14 years old were less likely
to have abnormal scores. While among our participants a younger age was protective
against an abnormal score, Van Roy, B. et al. found that scores were higher among younger
participants in their study [32]. Among Chinese adolescents, abnormal scores were also
predicted by the age of the adolescents [20]. Study findings from India and other places
have reported higher family engagement and parental involvement are protective factors
for adolescent mental health [33]. However, parental involvement decreases with an
increase in age, and mental health problems increase with age [34]. This may support the
findings of the current study.

We found that the type of school also predicted an abnormal score. In our study,
we found that adolescents from aided schools reported higher total difficulty scores than
adolescents in private schools. This may be because of the scarcity of availability of school
counselors in aided and government schools [35]. Other studies in the Indian context have
confirmed similar findings [36,37].

Being male predicted higher externalizing behavior scores. In the literature, gender
has been a determinant of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Bishop, S. et al.,
in their study among Nigerian adolescents, reported that being male was associated with
aggression [38]. These findings are similar to those reported by Aboobaker, S. et al. [39]
in the Indian context and are comparable with the findings of our study. Being female, in
our study, predicted internalizing behaviors. Gutman, L. et al. argue that while female
adolescents may be less likely to engage in delinquent behavior, participation in such
behavior may undergird depression or anxiety [40]. This is determined by various social

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2024, 21, 393

8 of 10

and biological determinants. Our findings are supported by the literature from Western
settings as well [41–43].

Among the participants, gender differences were elicited in the SDQ domains. In our
study, female participants had greater emotional problems as compared to males. This
finding was comparable with those of Nair, S., who also measured that female participants
from Gujarat had higher scores in terms of emotional problems compared with male partic-
ipants [30]. This finding was also confirmed by Puwar, T. et al. [44] and Aboobaker, S. et al.
in other settings in India [37]; Wang et al. [40] in China; and Rimal, H.S. and Pokharel, A.
in Nepal [45]. Harikrishnan, U. et al. [36] reported that the age of the participants was
positively correlated with emotional problems in a study among adolescents in Tezpur,
Assam. In comparison, in data from adolescents from Norway, Van Roy et al. also found
that girls had a higher total difficulties score in comparison to their male counterparts [32].
Van Roy et al. found that male participants reported higher levels of conduct and peer-
related problems. This finding is also comparable with the findings of our study. The
prosocial scores, which measure positive attributes, were, however, higher among our
female participants, which is similar to the findings of Van Roy et al.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations

In conclusion, the in-school adolescents in this study had lower total difficulties
scores in comparison with those from similar studies in India. This may be due to higher
access to mental health services in Udupi taluk. Also, private schools with central boards
have counsellors in school. The age and gender of the participants and the types of
schools emerged as significant predictors of the total difficulties and the externalizing and
internalizing behavioral problems among them. To aid adolescents in overcoming adverse
behavioral outcomes, policies and interventions need to take a multi-pronged approach.
The school setting may prove to be an ideal resource in creating awareness and providing
life skills education to equip adolescents with. School-based mental health promotion
and prevention with early intervention may be instrumental in promoting and enhancing
mental wellbeing and strengthening individuals’ capacities to build resilience.
