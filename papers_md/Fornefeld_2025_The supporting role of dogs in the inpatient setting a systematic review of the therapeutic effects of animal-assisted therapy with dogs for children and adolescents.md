Abstract
Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is becoming increasingly popular. The possibilities and guidelines for interventions and 
methods are very diverse. Currently, published studies mainly concentrate on effects in paediatrics, outpatient therapy and 
schools. Specific recommendations for AAT in the context of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry do not exist. This 
systematic review will attempt to evaluate the existing studies in terms of their methodological quality and specify posi-
tive and negative effects, aiming to provide a decision-making aid for everyday clinical practice. A systematic literature 
search (PubMed/MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, PubPsych, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library) according to the 
PRISMA criteria resulted in 1,908 identified hits, of which 49 articles were reviewed in full text. Three raters contributed 
to the review of the articles using a criteria-guided codebook. This systematic review is listed in the PROSPERO database 
(CRD42022358909). Quality analysis was conducted using Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Five studies 
were identified. The majority of these showed deficits in quality. Therapeutic effects and positive influences on the psycho-
pathological status, interpersonal relationships and subjective well-being or attitudes towards canine-assisted therapy (CAT) 
could be identified. Current studies indicate positive therapeutic effects of CAT in the inpatient treatment of children and 
adolescents. A cautiously positive perspective is warranted, but a general recommendation for CAT cannot be given. CAT 
should be carefully considered, planned, and implemented by professionals. For the future, further randomised controlled 
studies including follow-up studies, larger subject groups and clinically evaluated interventions are necessary to validate 
the current results.

Introduction

The integration of animal-assisted services into psycho-
therapy, coaching, counselling, and guidance is experienc-
ing rapid growth. Since Levinson's pioneering efforts in 
1969 [1] to incorporate animal-assisted interventions into 
psychotherapy  for  children  and  adolescents,  there  have 
been notable advancements, changes, and developmental 
processes. In 2011—42 years after Levinson’s initiative—
animal-assisted therapy is still regarded as an "innovative 
method" [2] in the treating psychiatric or somatic disorders, 
even  though  numerous  studies  demonstrating  a  positive 
effect can be identified [2]. During this period, systematic 
reviews, beyond the initial favourable conclusions, have 
consistently critiqued the fragmented evidence concerning 
the intervention, alongside deliberations on how to address

these concerns and what recommendations could be derived 
from them [3, 4].

Now,  two  decades  later,  a  valid  question  emerges: 
whether animal-assisted therapy (abbreviated as AAT) or 
canine-assisted therapy (abbreviated as CAT) still retains 
its innovative status or if it has now undergone widespread 
scientific evaluation, becoming an integral aspect of the clas-
sical psychotherapeutic and psychiatric framework [5]. Its 
application span outpatient treatment [6–8], inpatient care 
[9–11], palliative care [12], dental visits [13] and notably, 
during examinations [14]. It is hard nowadays to imagine 
therapeutic-pedagogical work without animal-assisted work.
The incorporation of AAT and CAT extends beyond the 
realm of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry; in some 
cases, AAT and particularly CAT form an integral com-
ponent of multimodal therapy programmes. Presently, the 
imperative of offering the best possible treatment to children 
and adolescents is undeniable. How, despite its widespread 
practical  utilisation,  the  question  lingers  regarding  how 
the integration AAT within inpatient child and adolescent 
psychiatric facilities should be evaluated. This context also 
raises the issue of establishing a robust evidential foundation 
and conducting a factual risk–benefit assessment. Against 
this backdrop, the current systematic review aims to con-
solidate findings to ultimately address whether CAT exerts 
a therapeutic effect on inpatient child and adolescent psychi-
atric treatment. The results are intended to provide support 
to clinical practitioners in determining whether to employ 
or recommend CAT.

Definition

Since  2000s,  concerted  efforts  have  been  undertaken  to 
establish a robust scientific framework underpinning the 
increasingly diverse landscape of AAT [15]. The biggest 
problem in this context is the lack of differentiation from 
related terms and the synonymous use of different terms. As 
early as 2003, there were 20 different definitions and twelve 
different terms in the English-speaking world, all converg-
ing around the theme of human-animal cooperation [16]. It 
is often a matter of small nuances in the work, for example 
whether work is done together with the animal (support-
ive) or only in the presence of the animal (accompanying) 
[17] Today, the terms “canine-assisted therapy” (CAT) or 
"Animal-Assisted Therapy" (AAT) are often used in the 
English-speaking world. The former (AAT) has been estab-
lished by the European Society for Animal-Assisted Therapy 
(ESAAT) as a generally valid technical term [18]. In this 
context, therapy is understood as any professional helping 
relationship with an influence on humans and also includes 
preventive and supportive measures [19].

AAT  invariably  involves  the  triangular  interplay 
amongst the client, the animal, and the therapist. It involves 

consciously planned psychological interventions with ani-
mals for children, adolescents, adults, and older people with 
cognitive, social-emotional and motor impairments, behav-
ioural disorders, and special needs [19]. These interventions 
are meticulously planned and not happenstance occurrences 
in the presence of a Therapy Assistance Dog (TAD); instead, 
they necessitate precise implementation drive by pre-estab-
lished indications and corresponding interventions [20]. 
Modalities encompass strategies that facilitate patient-ani-
mal interaction, communication aided by the animal or tasks 
directed towards the animal. The actual implementation of 
the planned intervention is always based on a clear orien-
tation on the basis of the respective needs and resources, 
but also based on the patient's disorder [19]. The objectives 
of AAT exhibit variability contingent upon the application 
domain. Specific goals are set according to the basic profes-
sion, individual resources, needs and indication. However, 
in summary, four global goals can be identified that can be 
realised across disciplines: (1) restore, maintain, or build 
physical, cognitive, or emotional functions, (2) promote 
abilities and skills to perform activities and actions, (3) pro-
mote inclusion in the respective life situation, (4) improve 
subjective well-being [19].

Basic findings on the effects of animal‑assisted 
therapy

AATs have been extensively applied across a diverse spec-
trum of settings, including educational institutions, counsel-
ling, coaching and therapy. These interventions have under-
gone rigorous evaluation through empirical studies. In the 
following, results from clinical practice will be highlighted, 
as they seem to be particularly relevant for this context. 
Notably,  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  examin-
ing both CAT [21, 22] and AAT in a broader sense, which 
encompasses CAT [23, 24], originating from medical–thera-
peutic contexts outside this domain, such as general somatic 
care or outpatient nursing for adolescents and adults, consist-
ently establish that AAT engenders salutary and construc-
tive effects on stress, pain, and psychiatric ailments. One 
systematic review [22] will be highlighted, as the effects of 
CAT in outpatient adolescent psychotherapeutic treatment 
of adolescents (age: 10–19) have been investigated. The 
authors conclude that there is a therapeutic effect on symp-
tomatology and the severity of the main disorder. However, 
the review underscores the imperative for further investiga-
tions to substantiate these findings. It should be noted that 
the above-mentioned analyses also identified studies that 
showed no measurable positive effects. Furthermore, certain 
studies exhibit methodological deficiencies of such magni-
tude that potential positive effects could only be assessed 
within constrained limits, particularly when interventions of 
varied forms were concurrently employed, thus obfuscating

the attribution of effects to a specific intervention. The pres-
ence or absence of a measurable effect appears independent 
of the diagnosis [25], even encompassing factors such as 
whether the patient is a dog owner himself [26].

In the inpatient psychiatric treatment of adults, there are 
already several studies that highlight the positive effects, 
for example in the treatment of depression [27]. The pres-
ence of a TAD generally led to a significantly friendlier and 
less tense feeling on the ward [9]. When a TAD is present, 
patients tend to spend more time in the company of fellow 
patients. Moreover, this experience of joy and acceptance 
extends its influence on therapies wherein the TAD is not 
present [9]. The number of occupancy days in inpatient psy-
chiatric facilities for adults could be significantly reduced 
using  CAT  [9,  25].  Adults  benefiting  from  CAT  report 
heightened social interaction skills, leading to improved 
social conduct and interpersonal communication [6]. Stress-
related  physiological  parameters,  including  hearth  rate, 
blood pressure and cortisol secretion, register significant 
reductions, especially during the interactions with TADs 
[12, 28, 29], subsequently fostering cardiovascular health 
improvements [21]. Owing to this anxiolytic effect, TADs 
are employed in various contexts, such as examination set-
tings or dental treatments for individuals with anxiety disor-
ders [13, 14]. In self-evaluation, patients report that the use 
of a TAD was one of the most effective factors in inpatient 
therapy, contributing to recovery in all areas of life, even 
when there was only a significant reduction in symptoms in 
the area of anxiety [26], which also reflects the high subjec-
tive degree of therapeutic achievements. Furthermore, nota-
ble enhancements in global psychosocial functioning and 
reductions in internalised problems are documented [30].

In the field of child and adolescent psychiatry, CAT has 
been particularly well evaluated in the outpatient treatment 
of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder 
[31–33]. Robust data stem from clinical trials [4, 34, 35], 
patient and parental surveys [36] and multiple systematic 
reviews [3, 4]. In both systematic reviews [3, 4] the positive 
impression and positive tendencies became clear, especially 
in the areas of social behaviour and psychosocial interac-
tion, greater use of language and stress reduction. The TADs 
often assume roles as catalysts for speech or as facilitators 
of social initiation. However, caveats regarding methodo-
logical rigour are also acknowledged, primarily revolving 
around sample size constraints, lack of standardisation and 
protocol adherence and heterogeneity in terminologies and 
interventions employed.

The uniqueness of working with therapy‑assisting 
dogs

This work deals exclusively with the therapeutic effects of 
TADs. This focus is deliberate, given that TADs possess 

distinct skills and qualities rendering them exceptionally 
suitable for therapeutic purposes. Some of these distinc-
tive capacities are linked to their potential for Theory of 
Mind (abbreviated as ToM). Extensive evidence supports 
the  notion  that  dogs,  to  a  considerable  extent,  exhibit 
metacognition,  perspective-taking,  and  intention  attri-
bution—hallmarks of ToM. Dogs adeptly discern varied 
social cues and adeptly leverage them for their advantage 
[37, 38]. Perspective-taking also extends to interpreting 
attention states and they adeptly adjust their behaviour in 
response to a person’s state of attention, thereby evinc-
ing  their  capacity  for  recognition  [37,  38].  From  this, 
assumptions can be made about further social-cognitive 
competencies  [39– 43].  Funda  and  Dustmann  [44,  45] 
have demonstrated that there is no discernible distinction 
in ToM ability between trained and untrained TADs. All 
dogs inherently possess this capability. Nevertheless, the 
special importance of criteria-based training and further 
education should be pointed out. Certainly, training in the 
field leads to acquiring skills, knowledge of methods, legal 
frameworks, hygiene guidelines and a criteria-based analy-
sis of the situation and planning of further interventions.

Dogs are inherently well-suited for AAT owing their 
aforementioned attributes. Beyond there traits, they also 
enjoy a favourable reputation in Western culture. Moreo-
ver, their versatility is noteworthy, as they can be effec-
tively utilised across diverse settings, including indoor 
spaces devoid of designated outdoor areas such as fields or 
equine stables. The distinctive nature of CAT lies in their 
well-defined social competencies, adaptable application 
modalities and the uniformly positive response evoked by 
the presence of the dogs.

Aim of this systematic review

This  systematic  review  aims  to  answer  the  following 
research question: Is there a significant improvement in 
general mental health status or measurable effects in the 
recovery of specific mental illnesses through the use of a 
therapy assistance dog in inpatient child and adolescent 
psychiatry compared to standard therapy?

Methods

In PROSPERO, a protocol was published on 20th Septem-
ber 2022; ID: CRD42022358909. The method presented 
below follows the PRISMA guideline for systematic lit-
erature reviews [46].

Eligibility criteria

In order to be included in the present systematic review, the 
studies investigated were required to satisfy specific criteria 
concerning participants, interventions, comparison groups 
and outcomes (PICO) [47]. Studies involving children and 
adolescents up to the age of 18, without known intellectual 
disabilities and currently undergoing inpatient treatment 
within child and adolescent psychiatry for mental illnesses 
were considered. Studies exploring CAT with children and 
adolescents in forensics or paediatrics were excluded. The 
studies had to exhibit a distinct emphasis on CAT within the 
overarching psychiatric-psychotherapeutic framework. This 
systematic review is limited to CAT because it is impor-
tant to be as setting- and animal-specific as possible in the 
analysis and comparison of data. This approach is aimed at 
circumventing the confounding effects that arise from the 
amalgamation of various methods and animals across dis-
parate settings, which compromises the quality and signifi-
cance of studies and systematic reviews in the broader realm 
of AAT. Although acknowledging the limited data available, 
we consciously adopted a setting-, age-, and animal-specific 
approach to enhance precision. The measure should have 
been examined with recognised questionnaires or concepts. 
In addition, only studies with at least two measurement 
points and a total of more than ten subjects were included. 
Only journals published in English or German from the last 
ten years (01.01.2012–31.07.2022) were eligible. This time 
period seemed necessary as the scientific discourse and pro-
fessionalism has changed significantly in the last ten years. 
Further studies were integrated by cross-referencing or cita-
tions from other studies and bibliographies.

Search strategy

Before conducting the systematic literature review, a search 
strategy  aligned  with  the  PICO  criteria  [47]  was  devel-
oped. The population of children and adolescents currently 
undergoing inpatient psychiatric treatment was described 
using terms such as "child", "youth", "adoles*" or "mental 
disorder". Additionally, prominent mental disorders preva-
lent in childhood and adolescence, such as depression [48], 
were encompassed to augment the scope. Pertaining to the 
intervention, terms were selected that yielded AAT or CAT 
within the context of psychiatric and  psychotherapeutic 
treatment. Terms like "animal assisted*", "canine therapy" 
or "therapy dog" were used. As for outcomes, the focus lay 
on the general mental state or symptom-related changes 
assessed through clinically validated questionnaires. The 
comparative intervention and outcome were not included in 
the search strategy, as it would limit the search results too 
much and therefore possibly relevant studies would not be 
included. Refer to Table 1 for comprehensive details.

Data sources

For this systematic review, a wide range of national and 
international journals and scientific databases were searched. 
The international specialised databases encompassed Pub-
Med, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Library and ProQuest. This 
was supplemented by the (German) national specialist data-
base PubPsych. Furthermore, to comprehensively compile 
relevant articles, Google Scholar was also employed. Due to 
the distinctive functioning of Google Scholar, slight adjust-
ments to the search terms have to be made.

Study selection

The  results  of  the  database  searches  were  processed 
and extracted in the first step. First, the duplicates were 
removed, and the still unscreened articles were listed in 
Zotero (V6.0.22, Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and 
New Media, George Mason University, Washington DC). 
The studies were screened and selected in three stages: 
In  the  first  stage,  the  lead  author  (DF)  and  the  second 
author (UZ) independently screened all titles using 15 pre-
defined criteria outlined in a comprehensive codebook. In 
this process, mainly foreign language articles (NOT Ger-
man or English) or articles that had not been published in 

journals were rejected. In the second stage, the lead author 
(DF) and the second author (UZ) independently read the 
abstracts and evaluated them using the criteria set out in 
the codebook. In the final stage, both the lead author (DF) 
and the second author (UZ) independently engaged with 
the full text of the qualifying studies to ascertain their 
suitability for inclusion. In cases where there was uncer-
tainty about a study, the third author (OF) was consulted to 
reach consensus. A summative depiction of the total count 
of articles, categorised according to PRISMA criteria, is 
visually presented in Fig. 1.

Data extraction

The lead author (DF) and the second author (UZ) under-
took the collection of data from studies that fulfilled the 
predetermined inclusion criteria. The following methodo-
logical information and results were evaluated and trans-
ferred into a criterion-guided overview: Aim of the study, 
location of the study, study design, participant details (e. 
g. age, gender, diagnosis), characteristics of the interven-
tion (e. g. duration of CAT, control intervention) and type 
of survey (e.g. questionnaires or observation).

Results

The literature search yielded a total of 1908 hits, of which 
1249 articles remained after removing duplicates (n = 85) 
and foreign language (non-English/German) or non-scien-
tifically published (n = 574). The next step was to screen 
the titles and abstracts. A large proportion of the studies 
did not align with the criterion of full inpatient psychi-
atric treatment (n = 1037). The second prevent basis for 
exclusion pertained to deviations from intervention crite-
ria (n = 111), followed by the mismatches with the target 
group (n = 62). After this screening process of titles and 
abstracts, a reduced pool of 39 articles remained. These 
articles underwent comprehensive evaluation via full-text 
analysis. Moreover, additional ten articles were integrated 
into the full-text assessment, sourced through reference 
citations and contributions from domain experts. Regret-
tably, none of these supplementary articles were included 
in the review after qualified examination in the full text. 
Following the comprehensive review of the 39 articles, 
five  articles  emerged  as  fully  aligned  with  all  the  pre-
established inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Descriptive overview of the studies that meet 
the inclusion criteria

Five studies fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
in all aspects. The characteristics of the studies are sum-
marised in Table 2. Amongst them, two originated from 
Italy [25; 30], whilst three hailed from the United States 
of America [49–51]. In all studies, the intervention under 
investigation took place in a full inpatient child and ado-
lescent psychiatric facility and focussed on the therapeutic 
effects on the patients. Two studies also focussed on the 
therapeutic effect on the caregiver system and the guard-
ians [30,  49]. The study cohorts ranged from 34 [25] to 
94 [50] participants, with subjects’ average ages spanning 
from 11.4 [51] to 15.91 [25] years. Most studies reported 
a notably higher proportion of female participants, ranging 
from 73.4% [50] to 84.8% [51], except for one study that 
maintained gender balance [25]. One study, however, did 
not furnish comprehensive socio-demographic information 
[30]. The duration of interventions varied from a singular 
ten-minute session [51] to a pre-structured programme 
involving 45-min weekly sessions over a 12-week span 
[25]. Notably, one study omitted specification of inter-
vention duration [30]. All studies featured CAT sessions 
facilitated by adept and trained professionals in conjunc-
tion  with  TADs.  Psychological–psychiatric  care  was 
ensured through placement in the psychiatric facility. The 
overall length of stay in these psychiatric facilities ranged 

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2025) 34:3–17

from 9.1 days [49] to an unspecified range spanning two 
to twelve weeks [25,  30]. However, two studies did not 
explicitly indicate a generalised length of stay [50,  51]. 
Two studies made reference to the DSM-5 classification 
system [50, 51], whilst one study referenced ICD-9 [25]. 
Two studies refrained from specifying their diagnostic 
basis [30, 49].

In Stefanini et al. [25], the three main diagnosis groups 
were  eating  disorders  (64.7%),  affective  disorders  with 
20.6% and schizophrenia with 8.8%; 55.9% of the subjects 
had other mental illnesses. Fodstadt et al. [50] reported a 
preponderance of affective disorders (50%), followed by 
eating disorders (15.9%) and anxiety disorders (9.6%). In 
Germone et al. [51], all the subjects were diagnosed with 
Autism Spectrum Disorder, additionally they were attrib-
uted to anxiety disorders with 68.1%, depressive disorders 
with 51.1% and neurodevelopmental disorders with 29% 
(multiple responses possible). Brown et al. [49] did not fur-
nish detailed diagnostic data; the primary diagnoses therein 
encompassed depression, bipolar disorders, anxiety disor-
ders, schizophrenia, and ADHD.

To quantifiably assess the psychological effects of CAT, 
four of the five studies opted for a purely quantitative ques-
tionnaire-based survey. One study adopted a mixed-methods 
approach [49]. Four evaluated measurement instruments 
were  utilised:  The  Children  Global  Assessment  Scale 
(C-GAS; Schaffer et al. 1983), the Youth Self Report (YSR; 
Achenbach et  al. 1994), the Subjective  Unit  of  Distress 
Scale (SUDS; Wolpe 1973) and the Visual Analogue Mood 
Scale (VAMS). Additionally, one study incorporated video 
recordings and structured observations [51]. In Germone 
et al. [51], video recordings were analysed using OHAIRE 
V3 (O’Haire et al. 2013). These assessment tools were fur-
ther supplemented with diverse inquiries pertaining to satis-
faction with CAT, along with questionnaires encompassing 
hospital care and standard school attendance formats.

Quality assessment of included studies

The  Effective  Public  Health  Panacea  Project  (EPHPP) 
quality framework was selected as the method for evalu-
ating the quality of the studies incorporated in this analy-
sis. The detailed results of the EPHPP quality assessment 
are shown in Table 3. Amongst the five studies, one study 
[25] attained a “Strong” rating in the Overall Ranking, sig-
nifying the absence of weak attributes within the EPHPP 
quality assessment. Conversely, the remaining four studies 
received a “Weak” rating in the Overall Ranking, signifying 
the presence of two or more weak quality attributes. The cat-
egories of “Study Design” and “Confounders” garnered the 
highest average quality ratings. Within the “Study Design” 
category, three studies merited a “Strong” rating. Remark-
ably, two studies adhered to the gold standard employing

a  Randomised  Controlled  Trial  (RCT)  design  [25,  30]. 
Another study employed a clinical trial format with cross-
over measurements versus a control group [51]. Two out 
of the five studies secured a “Moderate” rating in this cat-
egory, as they encompassed pre-post measurements without 
a control group [49, 50]. Instances wherein a control group 
was utilised often lacked detailed description, merely being 
defined  as  “therapeutic  protocol”.  “Selection  Bias”  and 
“Blinding” emerged as the categories most prone to reflect-
ing weak characteristics. Given that only one study achieved 
a “Strong” rating, and an 80% majority received a “Weak” 
rating, it is prudent to exercise caution when interpreting the 
following findings.

child and adolescent psychiatric milieu. This assessment 
will focus three dimensions: Changes in psychopathologi-
cal conditions, changes in interpersonal relationships and 
subjective feedback on the CAT. Given the diverse array 
of services and study designs, this seems to be challeng-
ing, prompting frequent cross-referencing to relevant studies 
and frameworks. It should be noted that no long-term data 
are available that could be highlighted here. Therefore, only 
direct follow-up results are referred to.

Initial post‑intervention effects of Canine‑assisted 
therapy on psychopathological conditions: positive 
changes in affective states and behaviours

Studies presented in this review

Two of the included studies [50,  51] utilised the above-
described abilities of the TAD as an icebreaker or as a speech 
elicitor. In these instances, an unstructured interaction was 
initiated. Patients were granted autonomy to determine when 
and how the TAD would engage, along with the methods of 
approach. This allowed patients to articulate their needs and 
desires. The spectrum of interactions ranged from amus-
ing patients through performing tricks to fulfilling bonding 
needs, such as cuddling and petting. In two studies [25, 49], 
interactions between humans, dogs and patients were care-
fully structured and pre-planned. Objectives were tailored 
to individual needs and deficiencies, alongside techniques 
and interventions necessary to achieve these goals. This 
encompassed physical contact to reduce stress, shared activi-
ties like agility exercises or walks, grooming tasks, such as 
brushing and cooperative engagement in tasks or objectives, 
including practising tricks together. Following the interven-
tions, all interactions were reviewed and discussed with the 
patients. Regrettably, one study did not provide a precise 
account of how the interaction between humans and dogs 
was organised or the purpose of this interaction [30].

Certainly, all of the above-mentioned studies have their 
raison d'être, even if some of them show clear quality defi-
cits. Hence, the ensuing results will encompass not solely the 
high-quality study, but also endeavour, to outline the thera-
peutic and supplementary impacts of CAT in the inpatient 

Four studies examined the short-term effects of CAT on psy-
chopathological aspects [25, 30, 49, 50]. All of these studies 
reported slightly favourable effects, which were discerned 
through clinically assessed measurement tools (e.g. C GAS, 
Schaffer D et al., 1983).

Findings in the study with a “Strong” EPHPP quality 
assessment overall ranking

After a continuously ongoing CAT over a longer period of 
time (3 months), participants exhibited a reduction in clini-
cal severity (t(32) = 2.41; p = 0.02) and an improvement in 
school ability (t(32) = 2.25; p = 0.03) compared to the con-
trol group [25]. Simultaneously, their global functional level 
demonstrated a significant enhancement in comparison to 
the control group (t(32) = 4.57; p < 0.0001) [25].

Findings from studies with a “Weak” EPHPP quality 
assessment overall ranking

Subjects  showed  significantly  lower  levels  of  negative 
affect immediately following the intervention [49]. After 
the intervention (pre–post-comparison), adolescent partici-
pants demonstrated reduced anxiety (z = − 2.27; p = 0.02), 
anger (z = − 2.86; p = 0.004), fatigue (z = − 3.38; p = 0.001), 
sadness  (z = −  4.02;  p = 0.00)  and  tension  (z = −  3.28; 
p = 0.001) [49]. Especially in the area of tension, this result 
can be supported by another study, which could highlight a 

12

significant reduction in stress and tension after the interven-
tion (p = 0.000) [50]. The most prominent clinical effect of 
CAT appeared to be associated with the emotion of sad-
ness [49]. Across all negatively correlated domains, sub-
jects experienced reduced sadness post-CAT compared to 
pre-intervention levels (z = − 2.89; p = 0.004), concurrently 
reporting an increased sense of happiness (overall positive 
z = − 3.91; p = 0.00; happy z = − 4.11; p = 0.00) [49]. In the 
Youth Self Report, a significant decrease in internalising 
behaviours (p < 0.001) and an increase in resources and com-
petences (p < 0.0001) could be demonstrated in the pre–post-
comparison [30]. In a sample consisting of individuals with 
autism spectrum disorder, subjects exhibited heightened 
emotional expressions (e.g. facial expressions) post-inter-
vention,  surpassing  expressions  observed  in  the  control 
group (p < 0.0001). Subjects displayed increased instances 
of smiling (p < 0.0001) and laughter (p = 0.0003), accompa-
nied by reduced negative affect (defined as frowning or cry-
ing; p = 0.0042) and neutral expressions (p < 0.0001) [51].

Initial post‑intervention changes in interpersonal 
relationships (e.g. parents, employees, peers)

Four studies examine interpersonal changes [25,  30,  50, 
51]. These changes can be categorised into primary therapy 
effects, encompassing the social behaviour of subjects and 
secondary therapy effects, encompassing the social behav-
iour of the support system or parents.

Primary therapy effects in the study with a “Strong” EPHPP 
quality assessment overall ranking

In the pre–post-comparison within the CAT group, nota-
ble improvements were observed in various domains [25]. 
There was heightened participation (p < 0.0001), increased 
socialised behaviour towards adults (p < 0.0001) and peers 
(p < 0.0001) and a significant reduction in social withdrawal 
behaviour (p < 0.04) [25]. Patients engaged in more interac-
tions with the TAD (p < 0.0001) and showed more affective 
behaviour towards them (p < 0.0001) [25].

Primary therapy effects in the study with a “Weak” EPHPP 
quality assessment overall ranking

In a sample exclusively consisting of adolescents with autism 
spectrum disorder, significant increases in social interaction 
and communication were observed in the intervention group 
compared to the control group (p = 0.0001) [51]. This change 
relates especially to the adult handler (p = 0.0001) and less 
so towards other co-patients (p = 0.298) [51]. Participants 
showed more verbal interaction overall in the intervention 
group (p = 0.04), especially towards adults (p < 0.0001) [51]. 
There are also more gestures (p = 0.032) and more frequent 

eye contact (p < 0.0001), both especially towards the adult 
handler (p < 0.0001) [51]. It is worth mentioning that unlike 
the aforementioned RCT study, the impact on increased 
socialised behaviour towards adults could not be confirmed 
in the autistic sample (p = 0.0927) [51].

Secondary therapy effects in the studies with a “Weak” 
EPHPP quality assessment overall ranking

Staff members at child and adolescent psychiatric facili-
ties subjectively reported a significant enhancement in their 
general mental state [49,  50]. Nonetheless, there was no 
significant change in clinical parameters observed within a 
small sample (n = 9) [49]. Two-thirds of the support system 
reported exclusively positive effects, which they subjec-
tively attribute to their own mental state [50]. Qualitative 
interviews emphasised the therapeutic influence of CAT, 
enhancing the therapeutic environment and leading to more 
successful therapeutic endeavours [50]. This therapeutic 
effect is further illustrated by the increased acceptance and 
compliance of parents towards hospital care, therapeutic 
methods and treatment when involved in or aware of CAT. 
Additionally, it positively impacts the therapeutic alliance, 
parent behaviour and parent engagement, all of which col-
lectively contribute to overall treatment success [30].

Subjective feedback on the canine‑assisted 
therapy in the studies with a “Weak” EPHPP quality 
assessment overall ranking

Three studies have captured the subjective feedback from 
participants and other individuals involved in CAT [49–51]. 
Qualitative statements, as well as their own subjective expe-
rience or general feedback, have been documented. These 
statements serve to complement and enrich the quantitative 
data.

Participants’ qualitative feedback largely revolves around 
their personal experiences. They described themselves as 
happier, more relaxed and calmer during and after the inter-
vention [50]. The CAT is frequently described as joyful, 
enjoyable and a welcome addition to the existing therapeutic 
programme [50, 51]. For example, memories of their own 
childhood or general positive experiences with animals are 
stimulated  [50].  Caregivers  and  support  personnel  have 
noticed that patients tend to open up more about their chal-
lenges and issues in the presence of the TAD. Furthermore, 
agitated patents often find solace and tranquillity in the com-
pany of the TAD [50]. In the Likert scale survey, a signifi-
cant 77.1% of respondents expressed that they “very much 
enjoyed” the CAT, with no responses indicating dissatisfac-
tion [50]. The feedback also indicates a strong attachment 
and affection towards the TAD [50].

The average duration of the intervention in one study 
was 11.5 min (SD = 3.4), which two-thirds of the respond-
ents felt was just right. A smaller proportion of participants 
expressed a desire for a longer intervention period [50]. A 
few participants perceived the CAT as “childish” or “idiotic” 
[49]. No discernible difference was found between the CAT 
and control groups regarding negative comments about the 
intervention’s nature, the desire to discontinue the interven-
tion or the wish to leave the room (p = 0.573) [51].

Discussion

The aim of this systematic review was to comprehensively 
examine the use of CAT in inpatient psychiatric treatments 
for children and adolescents based on scientifically pub-
lished data. The primary objective was to determine whether 
the inclusion of CAT in inpatient child and adolescent psy-
chiatry leads to a significant improvement in overall men-
tal health or measurable effect in the treatment of specific 
mental illnesses compared to standard therapy. In addressing 
this, the review investigated the impact of CAT on psycho-
pathological, interpersonal, and subjective changes in the 
context of inpatient psychiatric care.

Four studies [25, 30, 49, 50] have explored the potential 
short-term effects of CAT on psychopathological aspects, 
suggesting the possibility of positive effects based on clini-
cally evaluated measurement instruments. These potential 
effects included lower levels of negative effects, reduced 
anxiety, fatigue, sadness, and tension [49, 50]. It was sug-
gested that CAT might have had a more noticeable clini-
cal impact on the experience of sadness [49]. Regarding 
longer-term effects, there was a suggestion that CAT could 
potentially be associated with a decrease in clinical severity, 
an increase in school performance and higher global func-
tioning levels [25]. Additionally, there were indications that 
CAT might have led to a modest decrease in internalising 
behaviour and a potential boost in resources and skills [30]. 
In a study involving a sample of individuals with autism 
spectrum disorder, there were hints that CAT might have 
resulted in more frequent emotional expressions [51].

These results suggest that integrating CAT into the inpa-
tient psychiatric setting may lead to an improvement of the 
psychopathological conditions, particularly in the areas of 
mood, affect, psychomotor function, attitude towards illness, 
anxiety and contact behaviour [52]. A short-term improve-
ment across six scales in the psychopathological findings is 
considered positive and supports the use of CAT as a thera-
peutic intervention in inpatient therapy alongside existing 
therapeutic methods. CAT, especially for patients with selec-
tive mutism or socially phobic behaviour, may serve as a 
useful means to encourage contact and affect in cases where 
they are limited. The therapeutic effect of CAT could also be 

beneficial for patients who exhibit agitation or impulsivity 
such as those with schizophrenia or individuals in acute cri-
sis situations. However, it’s worth noting that the majority of 
studies did not report effect sizes due to their study designs, 
making  it  difficult  to  determine  the  magnitude  of  these 
effects. Nevertheless, considering the methodological chal-
lenges and limitations, it can be concluded that CAT in the 
context of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric treat-
ment could potentially support the success of therapy with 
respect to psychopathological conditions and open doors to 
enhance the effectiveness of other therapeutic approaches.
Four studies [25, 30, 50, 51] have examined the interper-
sonal changes resulting from CAT, focussing on primary 
and secondary therapy effects. Primary therapy effects per-
tain to changes in patients' social behaviour, suggesting that 
CAT led to increased social interaction, communication 
and reduced social withdrawal and aggressive behaviour 
[25, 51]. These findings partially support the earlier find-
ings related to the improvement of psychopathological sta-
tus, particularly in terms of contact behaviour [52], at least 
in interactions with peers [25, 51]. This suggests potential 
benefits for the treatment of socially phobic or selective mut-
ism patients. Given the positive effect in reducing aggressive 
behaviour and improving psychopathological status, CAT 
may be a valuable addition to crisis treatment and manage-
ment. Secondary therapy effects pertain to changes in social 
behaviour towards the helper system (e.g. parents or staff) 
and the reaction of the helper system to this. The evidence 
indicates that there is at least a short-term subjective effect 
on the helper system when they are integrated into CAT. 
The helper system believes in the therapeutic efficacy and 
success of CAT, considering it a valuable addition to the 
existing treatment programme. This belief contributes to 
greater compliance within the helper system, particularly 
amongst parents, resulting in higher treatment satisfaction 
and increased adherence to therapy methods and the overall 
hospital stay [53]. These factors positively impact the ther-
apeutic alliance and the overall treatment success, further 
supporting the integration of CAT in inpatient care.

Three studies focussed on the subjective feedback of par-
ticipants, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative 
feedback. Participants commonly reported feeling happier, 
more relaxed and calmer during and after CAT sessions. 
They viewed the interventions as joyful, enjoyable and a 
valuable addition to existing therapeutic programmes. This 
subjective feedback aligns with the scientific evaluation of 
positive effects, laying the groundwork for additional thera-
peutic benefits. Participants indicated that they were more 
inclined to discuss problems or life difficulties in the pres-
ence of the TAD, highlighting the potential for integrating 
CAT into various aspects of inpatient care, including group 
therapy, education, and social training programmes. One 
study had a mean intervention duration of 11.5 min, which 

14 

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2025) 34:3–17

was felt to be just right by over two-thirds of the participants. 
Due to the short duration of the intervention, the use of CAT 
can be implemented quickly and easily in everyday clinical 
practice. Only a few participants perceived the interven-
tion as “childish” or “idiotic”. Overall, CAT was positively 
received by participants and was seen as providing meaning-
ful subjective benefits.

One study documented adverse events, including two 
cases of patients experiencing mental decompensation with 
acute danger to themselves and others following CAT ses-
sions, as well as one case of upper respiratory tract infection 
[50]. Causality does not seem likely to the authors of the 
study; however, it must be considered. All analysed studies 
implemented clear exclusion criteria, such as dog phobias, 
aversions to dogs or dog hair allergies. Patients had to pro-
vide separate consent for the intervention and be informed 
about less likely risks such as scratches or dog bites. It’s 
important to acknowledge that this intervention isn’t devoid 
of risks or side effects. Consequently, it is crucial to provide 
comprehensive information to underage patients and their 
legal guardians regarding all potential risks, avoiding any 
downplaying of such risks to ensure informed consent.

Strengths and limitations

A  strength  of  these  systematic  reviews  is  the  rigorous 
PRISMA  analysis  and  evaluation  process.  The  review 
involved the assessment of 1908 articles at title and abstract 
level, followed by a comprehensive review of 49 full texts 
by two reviewers (DF, UZ). In cases of conflicts, a third 
reviewer with clinical experience (OF) was consulted. This 
multi-reviewer approach, guided by predefined scientifically 
sound criteria, minimised the risk of systematic bias and 
enhanced the quality of the literature analysis. The inclusion 
of several experts (DF, UZ, OF) further bolstered the cred-
ibility of the study’s result and their interpretation, thereby 
reducing potential errors and systematic bias.

Certain limitations are inherent to the current state of 
evidence. The review outlined several qualitative deficits 
that need further exploration. AAT is a broad field with 
many methodological difficulties that need to be taken into 
account. One limitation already exists in the heterogene-
ous scientific foundation and terminology. This diversity 
and heterogeneity are also evident in the different studies 
that have been presented here. Another interesting point of 
discussion is whether single and multiple CAT interventions 
are comparable or should be assessed separately. This review 
did not specify a minimum time limit for an intervention as 
an inclusion criterion. It becomes evident that comparing a 
one-time, approximately 11.5-min intervention to a 12-week 
intervention lasting several hours has clear limitations. Due 
to the changes in the scientific foundation of AAT, we have 

limited ourselves to the period of the last ten years. Cer-
tainly, there are some studies that would in principle provide 
noteworthy results or further supportive effects but have now 
been dropped from consideration. The studies mentioned 
above often, but not always, use valid and reliable measure-
ment instruments. In some cases, it was explicitly noted that 
these instruments were not suited for use with children and 
adolescent. Additionally, each study used different measure-
ment instruments, so that there was no comparability and 
there is not enough data for a meta-analysis at the present 
time. Without robust and valid measurement instruments, 
the significance of the collected data seems to remain diffuse 
and confirms the currently poor evidence base for AAT and 
especially CAT in child and adolescent psychiatric institu-
tions. Meaningful measurement instruments specifically 
designed for evaluating AAT are completely lacking.

Many studies lack precise descriptions of test subjects, 
including information about age, background, and the con-
crete diagnosis of mental illness. Furthermore, some studies 
didn’t provide effect size due to their study design, making 
interpretation much more difficult. The studies also exhibit 
limitations  such  as  small  samples  and  a  lack  of  control 
groups in certain instances. Long-term or extended follow-
up studies are completely missing, which might be attributed 
to the relative youth of the therapy method and the inpatient 
setting. It should also be noted, the review includes papers 
from only two countries and two of the included papers are 
from the same research group.

Future research

This work has identified a substantial research gap con-
cerning the use of CAT in child and adolescent psychiatric 
treatment and its therapeutic and supportive effects within 
the inpatient therapy context. Urgent attention is needed to 
address this empirical data deficit through randomized con-
trolled trials with follow-up periods of at least six months. 
Given the challenges of collecting and analysing such data 
with inpatient settings, it might be advisable to initially 
gather further data in outpatient or day hospital settings to 
establish an evidence-based foundation for CAT in outpa-
tient care. This could potentially guide the application of 
findings to the inpatient setting.

In  order  to  enable  a  subsequent  meta-analysis,  it  is 
important that consistent, valid, and reliable measurement 
tools (e.g. questionnaires) should be utilised. Addition-
ally, it’s important to determine which mental illnesses 
are  suitable  for  CAT  and  whether  any  contraindica-
tions exist. For better comparability, concrete concepts 
and manuals should be developed and evaluated, as the 
heterogeneous design of CAT can lead to difficulties in 
comparison. It seems necessary to collect and combine

clinical experiences, best practice examples and theoreti-
cally based derivations to create an evidence-based cata-
logue of criteria for successful CAT. Many aspects of CAT 
remain unclear, such as safety precautions for humans and 
dogs, hygiene guidelines and the careful balancing of risk 
and benefit [54].

Clinical relevance

Given the identified quality deficits, the current evidence 
situation can be cautiously interpreted as positive. CAT 
could be beneficial, especially in acute settings, in cases 
involving internalising disorders (e.g. depression or anxi-
ety), with children and adolescents with selective mutism 
(where it might serve as an “icebreaker”) or for support-
ing social skills training. Moreover, here are many posi-
tive studies and case reports from various medical fields, 
such as paediatrics and dentistry. On the other hand, the 
increased use of AAT, also in child and adolescent psy-
chiatric  institutions,  is  becoming  apparent,  at  least  in 
German-speaking countries, without there currently being 
sufficient evidence on the therapeutic effect and possible 
side effects or risks of this therapeutically applied method. 
According to the current analysis, a cautiously positive 
perspective is warranted, but a general recommendation 
for CAT in inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric facil-
ities cannot be given at this stage. Until further research 
clarifies this intervention’s effectiveness, individual inter-
ventions  should  be  carefully  considered,  planned,  and 
implemented by professionals, including psychotherapists, 
psychiatrists, and specialists in CAT. These interventions 
should consider factors, such as diagnosis, compliance, 
and treatment planning, avoiding broad interventions with-
out careful consideration.
