Abstract

Recent progress has been made in our understanding of nonsubstance or “behavioral” addictions, 
although these conditions and their most appropriate classification remain debated and the 
knowledge basis for understanding the pathophysiology of and treatments for these conditions 
includes important gaps. Recent developments include the classification of gambling disorder as a 
“Substance-Related and Addictive Disorder” in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and proposed diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming 
Disorder in Section 3 of DSM-5. This chapter reviews current neuroscientific understandings of 
behavioral addictions and the potential of neurobiological data to assist in the development of 
improved policy, prevention, and treatment efforts.

INTRODUCTION

While debated, the concept of nonsubstance or “behavioral” addictions has gained traction 
as evidenced by the recent classification of gambling disorder as a “Substance-Related and 
Addictive Disorder” in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th 
edition) (DSM-5) and definition in Section 3 of DSM-5 of diagnostic criteria for Internet 
gaming disorder (IGD) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Petry and O’Brien, 2013). 
These classification and inclusion efforts have been informed by neuroscientific data. A 
current challenge exists in translating a neuroscientific understanding of these disorders into

more effective treatments. Behaviors that may involve excessive or problematic engagement 
include gambling, Internet use, and gaming. The following chapter reviews the current 
neurobiological understanding of, and discusses treatment implications with respect to, 
excessive and interfering patterns of gambling, Internet use, and gaming.

2  GAMBLING DISORDER

The reclassification of gambling disorder in the DSM-5 was based upon evidence of clinical, 
neurobiological, and other similarities between substance-use and gambling disorders 
(Potenza, 2006). Due to the recent classification and renaming of “pathological gambling” 
(PG) in DSM-IV-TR to “gambling disorder” in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 
2000, 2013; Potenza, 2014), this condition will be referred to as gambling disorder in this 
chapter despite a majority of data emanating from studies of PG.

3  NEURAL FEATURES OF GAMBLING DISORDER

Phenomenological similarities between substance-use and gambling disorders have been 
observed, leading to inclusionary criteria addressing tolerance, withdrawal, and interference 
in major areas of life functioning for these conditions. Recently, there have been various 
other reviews of neural function in gambling disorder (Leeman and Potenza, 2012, 2013; 
Meng et al., 2014). The current review will describe recent findings related to processes 
which may be beneficial for advancing treatment of this disorder.

3.1  NEUROCOGNITIVE FACETS

Neurocognitive measures allow for evaluation of possible dysfunction in a variety of 
cognitive facets and offer insight in to potential underlying neural regions of importance in 
behavioral addictions (Potenza, 2014). The evaluation of patterns of dysfunction allows for 
comparisons to healthy comparison subjects, across substance-use disorders, and various 
other populations of interest which allow for a more in-depth understanding of similarities 
and differences between these groups (Choi et al., 2014; Leeman and Potenza, 2012; Noël et 
al., 2013; Yan et al., 2014). Importantly, evaluation of neurocognitive function in PG through 
neurocognitive tasks has provided insight into the maintenance of this disorder (for review, 
see Brevers et al., 2013; van Holst et al., 2010). Together, these data inform potential 
approaches to the identification of those at risk and the development of more effective 
treatments.

3.2  ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY

Electrophysiological studies involving electroencephalogram (EEG) data and tasks designed 
to elicit event-related potentials (ERPs) offer insight into neural function linked to sensory or 
cognitive processing. To date, these methods have not been extensively used within 
individuals with PG, with existing studies frequently using gambling tasks, as described 
below.

Feedback-related negativity (FRN), an ERP component elicited through feedback related to 
subject performance, has been evaluated. Healthy comparison subjects and those with PG 
presented with similar FRN amplitudes in win and loss conditions; however, in PG subjects,

an additional FRN occurred earlier with latency and amplitude correlated with severity of 
PG (Oberg et al., 2011). In PG, blunted P3 amplitude and EEG power in theta-band activity 
were also found in response to high-risk scenarios (Oberg et al., 2011). More recently, Lole 
and colleagues (2015) found attenuated FRN and feedback-related positivity in response to 
losses and wins with no difference in P3b amplitude in response to large and small rewards 
in PG. These data suggest varied sensitivity to risk, reward, and loss in PG which can be 
evaluated through EEG.

During simulated blackjack, reward resulted in more positive reactivity in PG compared to 
healthy comparison subjects during a window after the FRN (between 270 and 320 ms); a 
difference in positivity was found within PG subjects between responses to rewards and 
losses, with no differences in healthy comparison subjects (Hewig et al., 2010). However, 
during varying loss conditions, PG subjects did not show differences in reactivity during 
conditions of near or full losses during this same window of activity, unlike healthy 
comparison subjects (Kreussel et al., 2013). When comparing occasional gamblers and PG 
subjects during a blackjack task, reactivity in these two groups differed in both low- and 
high-risk conditions during risk assessment, and PG subjects presented with greater 
negativity during reward processing (Miedl et al., 2014). Together, these studies differences 
in the electrophysiological brain correlates of reward/loss processing and suggest a need for 
additional study of cue-related craving effects on risk assessment, loss, and reward 
processing in PG.

3.3  FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks offer insight into the neural circuitry 
associated with different neuropsychological processes that may be targeted in the treatment 
of gambling disorder. These tasks permit the evaluation of the neural underpinnings of 
cognitive processes, such as decision-making or processing of monetary rewards and losses 
(reviewed in Potenza, 2014). Data from fMRI studies implicate similar brain regions in both 
substance and behavioral addictions (Leeman and Potenza, 2013; Potenza, 2013). For 
example, several studies of monetary-reward processing have identified blunted activation of 
the ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation in gambling disorder (Balodis et al, 
2012; Choi et al., 2012), resonating with findings in alcohol-, tobacco-, and cannabis-use 
disorders (reviewed in Balodis and Potenza, 2015). Below, we will highlight findings from 
fMRI recent studies not covered in recent reviews.

In a recent study examining decision-making when varying risk and ambiguity, healthy 
control participants but not those with PG showed greater striatal, insular, and prefrontal 
cortical activations during decision-making under risk as compared to ambiguity, and 
individuals with PG as compared to those without showed greater striatal activation during 
betting as compared to “safe” choices (Brevers et al., 2015). Using a different task, Miedl 
and colleagues demonstrated that processing delayed rewards during decision-making 
involves widespread, bilateral activation in PG subjects compared to left side activation of 
healthy controls. In addition, indifferent compared to sure decisions elicited greater 
widespread activation in PG versus control subjects, where sure decisions for PG subjects 
only elicited activity in the inferior parietal and superior temporal areas, and greater activity

in the cingulate gyrus, insula, and medial frontal gyrus in healthy control subjects (Miedl et 
al., 2015). Together, findings suggest a complex relationship between striatal activation and 
gambling disorder. It is likely that between-study differences in task design (e.g., delay-
discounting vs. risky choice tasks) may relate to differences in findings.

Reward type may also impact neural reactivity. Monetary and erotic rewards have been used 
in order to assess possible differences between reward types. VS activation during reward 
anticipation for erotic stimuli was lower compared to monetary rewards in PG subjects, and 
this activation was correlated to subjective ratings for erotic but not monetary rewards in PG 
subjects (Sescousse et al., 2013). Posterior orbitofrontal cortical activation was greater 
during reward outcome for PG subjects for monetary gains (Sescousse et al., 2013). 
Differences based on reward type related to stress systems as VS activation and cortisol 
levels were correlated in PG subjects in response to monetary cues (Li et al., 2014).

fMRI tasks may model aspects of electronic-gambling machines including “near-miss” 
events that occur when symbols on two of three reels match. These tasks may relate more 
closely to specific gambling behaviors compared to other decision-making tasks. During 
near-miss events, both cocaine-dependent and PG subjects showed greater reactivity in 
ventrocortical and mesolimbic areas compared to those without either diagnosis, with PG 
subjects having greatest reactivity (Worhunsky et al., 2014). During a similar task, near-miss 
events elicited activity in the insula and right inferior frontal gyrus, and increased theta-band 
oscillations in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and insula (Dymond et al., 2014). These 
data suggest task content is also relevant to activity when comparing across addictions. 
Therefore, future studies should attempt to incorporate tasks which may be more 
ecologically valid.

Resting-state fMRI studies may offer valuable insight into functional brain connectivity at 
rest. In PG subjects, the supplementary motor area and paracingulate cortex show reduced 
connectivity at rest (Tschernegg et al., 2014). The right caudate appears more involved and 
the hippocampus less involved in information integration in PG versus control subjects 
(Tschernegg et al., 2014). These data suggest differences in PG and non-PG groups in 
networks involved in self-regulation and reward processing.

3.4  STRUCTURAL MRI

Structural MRI allows for volumetric comparison of tissue structures across different 
diagnostic groups. Using this method, comparisons between PG, substance-addicted and 
nonaddicted groups may improve understanding of the neural structural under-pinnings of 
various addictions. Recently, smaller left hippocampal and right amygdalar volumes were 
found in PG versus control subjects (Rahman et al., 2014). Regional volumes were related to 
behavioral inhibition scores grouping PG subjects (Rahman et al., 2014). Additionally, 
problem-gambling subjects displayed similar gray matter volumes as did subjects with 
alcohol use disorder: lower volumes in left superior frontal cortex, bilateral precentral 
cortex, right insula, left thalamus, bilateral superior parietal cortex, and right supramarginal 
cortex (van Holst et al., 2012).

3.5  DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may assess white matter integrity. To date, two studies have 
used DTI to study PG. In PG versus control subjects, lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was 
present in the right and left genu of the corpus callosum, a pattern also seen in substance 
abuse (Yip et al., 2011). Lower FA in the corpus callosum was also seen in an independent 
study which reported widespread lower FA in PG ( Jousta et al., 2011). Together, these 
studies suggest microstructural deficits present in PG which appear not to be accounted for 
by neurotoxic effects of substances.

3.6  NEUROCHEMISTRY

Preclinical, ligand-based imaging, and molecular genetic research methods may all be used 
to inform understanding of the role of different neurotransmitters systems in PG (reviewed 
in Potenza, 2013). In this section, we will focus on recent findings from human ligand-based 
and genetic studies, with an emphasis on dopamine and serotonin (5-HT). For a discussion 
of findings from pharmacological treatment studies conducted in gambling disorder, see 
Section 5.2.

The role of dopamine in PG remains poorly understood. Dopamine has been implicated in 
substance addictions and reward processing, among other behaviors. Positron emission 
tomography (PET) permits study of neurochemical and metabolic measures. As reviewed in 
Potenza (2013), data from PET studies using [11C]-raclopride suggest that individual 
differences in dopamine release and D2/3 receptor availability are related to individual 
differences in clinical features of PG, such as positive urgency (Clark et al., 2012) and task 
performance (Linnet et al., 2012) or subjective experiences during gambling tasks (Jousta et 
al., 2012).

There have been two recent PET studies using the D3-preferring radioligand [11C]-(+)-
propyl-hexahydro-naphtho-oxazin (Boileau et al., 2013, 2014). While no significant 
differences in D3 receptor availability were found between individuals with and without PG 
(Boileau et al., 2013, 2014), significant decreases in receptor binding subsequent to 
amphetamine challenge were observed among individuals with PG (Boileau et al., 2014).

Problem-gambling severity has been linked to the serotonin system (reviewed in Leeman 
and Potenza, 2013; Potenza, 2013). A positive association between serotonin 1B receptor 
availability and problem-gambling severity (Potenza, 2013) and a genetic link between 
serotonin 2A receptors and PG have been reported; see genetic studies, below (Wilson et al., 
2013).

The relationship between dopamine and serotonin and their complementary roles in value-
adaptation and loss-chasing may be relevant to PG (Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2011). 
Other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., opioid, cannabinoid, glutamate) require consideration 
in PG.

4  GENETICS

Page 6

Polymorphisms in genes encoding for dopamine-related moieties, including DRD1 Ddel, 
DRD2 Taq I A, and DRD4 (exon III), have been reported, although negative results have 
also been reported (reviewed in Leeman and Potenza, 2013). Studies also suggest genes 
coding for the serotonin transporter, 5HTTLPR, and MAO enzymes (e.g., MAO-A, MAO-B) 
may contribute to PG (reviewed in Leeman and Potenza, 2013). An association between the 
C/C genotype of the 5-HT-2A receptor gene and PG has also been reported recently (Wilson 
et al., 2013). Below, we review findings from recent genetic studies, focusing on findings not 
covered in recent reviews (Gyollai et al., 2014; Leeman and Potenza, 2013; Yau et al., 2014).

While candidate gene studies often fail to replicate, genome-wide association studies 
(GWASs) have arguably shown more consistency, although few have been performed in PG 
(one reported to date). GWAS data collected in a community-based Australian twin sample 
identified six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as related to disordered gambling, 
four of which the authors interpreted as “theoretically relevant,” although none reached 
genome-wide significance (Lind et al., 2012). Identified SNPs included rs8064100, located 
downstream of metallothionein 1X (MT1X), previously implicated in alcohol and drug 
dependence (Lind et al., 2012).

Genetic contributions have been found to relate to the age of onset of gambling but not age 
of onset of drinking in males; however, in females, genetic contributions link to onsets of 
both behaviors (Richmond-Rakerd et al., 2014). Conversely, twin studies suggest 
nondisordered gambling engagement is equally influenced by family environmental factors 
in men and women (Slutske and Richmond-Rakerd, 2014). Recently, shared environmental 
and genetic factors have been linked to the age of gambling initiation predicting gambling 
behavior later in life (Slutske et al., 2014). Taken together, these findings suggest a 
complicated relationship between genetic contributions, environmental influences, sex, and 
gambling behaviors and disorders.

Twin studies offer valuable insight into relative genetic and environmental contributions to 
PG and co-occurring disorders. The Vietnam Era Twin Registry has demonstrated that PG 
shares genetic factors with both obsessive-compulsive classes (Scherrer et al., 2015) and 
drug addictions (Xian et al., 2014), with environmental contributions less important for the 
overlap between PG and stimulant dependence. These findings suggest the need to identify 
specific genetic factors involved in these relationships and determine the extent to which 
these may represent appropriate targets for behavioral or pharmacological interventions in 
subgroups of individuals with PG.

5  TREATMENT OF GAMBLING DISORDER

Treatment of PG involves both pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods, as 
reviewed elsewhere (Yip and Potenza, 2014). Though various treatments exist, individuals 
with PG are often unlikely to seek treatment, and those that do have high dropout rates, 
highlighting the need for enhanced efforts to get individuals into treatment settings and 
maintain their attendance (Rash and Petry, 2014).

5.1  BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT

Two recent manuscripts have reviewed nonpharmacological therapies for PG (Cowlishaw et 
al., 2012; Rash and Petry, 2014). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has arguably the 
greatest support, with one CBT treatment adapted from that demonstrating efficacy in the 
treatment of substance-use disorders and another focused on targeting irrational cognitions. 
As compared to CBT for substance addictions, CBT for PG may also target financial 
problems and financial management. Other approaches that have shown efficacy in the 
treatment of PG involve imaginal desensitization, motivational enhancement, and brief 
interventions like those that show efficacy in the treatment of substance-use disorders. 
Mindfulness-based approaches for PG have also been proposed and are beginning to be 
investigated. Active ingredients of these therapies and biological mechanisms relating to 
their efficacies have been proposed, and further research is needed to investigate how these 
treatments work and for whom they might work best (Potenza et al., 2013).

5.2  PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT

Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, dopaminergic agents, mood stabilizers, 
glutamatergic agents, opioid-receptor antagonists, and other drugs have been investigated in 
the treatment of PG (reviewed in Bullock and Potenza, 2012; Yip and Potenza, 2014). 
Arguably, the most consistent results are from studies of opioid-receptor antagonists 
(naltrexone, nalmefene), with four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showing varying 
degrees of efficacy. However, the effect size of opioid-receptor antagonists in the treatment 
of PG may be modest (Bartley and Bloch, 2013), although the medication may be most 
helpful for specific subgroups (those with familial histories of alcoholism or strong 
gambling urges). Treatment algorithms have been proposed (Bullock and Potenza, 2012) 
largely based on co-occurring disorders (e.g., lithium in the treatment of individuals with PG 
and co-occurring bipolar-spectrum disorders) and willingness to take pharmacotherapies. 
For individuals less willing to consider pharmacotherapies, n-acetyl cysteine, a dietary 
supplement with glutamatergic properties, may represent an important therapeutic 
possibility. Recently, in a placebo-controlled RCT of n-acetyl cysteine in individuals with 
PG and nicotine dependence in which all participants received a behavioral therapy for 
gambling involving CBT, motivational, and imaginal-desensitization components, active n-
acetyl cysteine was superior to placebo with respect to reducing smoking during treatment 
and reducing gambling behaviors at follow-up (Grant et al., 2014). These findings raise the 
intriguing possibility that n-acetyl cysteine may lead to greater durability of gambling-
related behavioral therapies, perhaps augmenting a “sleeper” effect that has been described 
for CBT in the treatment of substance-use disorders. However, this and other aspects of how 
behavioral and pharmacological therapies may be used conjointly in the treatment of PG 
warrant additional investigation.

6  PROBLEMATIC INTERNET USE AND IGD

The extent to which Internet use may be considered the focus of a disorder has been debated, 
with some contending that the Internet may represent a vehicle for other behaviors (e.g., 
gambling) that constitute the true diagnostic focus (Petry and O’Brien, 2013). Additionally, 
if considered a disorder, debate exists regarding the extent to which problematic Internet use

(PIU) may represent an addiction or not. Given these debates, we will use the term PIU in 
this review although other terms (e.g., Internet addiction) have been used in the literature. 
PIU may be conceptualized as involving the excessive or poorly controlled urges and 
behaviors relating to Internet use that lead to subjective distress and/or interference in major 
areas of life functioning. It is a heterogeneous construct that may include a multitude 
features relating to sexual, social networking, and gaming behaviors. Currently, IGD is 
included in Section 3 of the DSM-5 as this was determined to need more research, despite 
being considered the most well studied and interfering type of Internet use at the time of 
DSM-5 deliberations (Petry and O’Brien, 2013).

7  NEURAL FEATURES OF PIU

7.1  NEUROCOGNITIVE FACETS

Few neurocognitive studies have been used to assess PIU and IGD; however, differences in 
impulsivity have been noted. High urgency, a facet of impulsivity, has been shown to relate 
to PIU (Billeux et al., 2011). Higher self-reported impulsivity was also found in IGD and 
alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared to healthy controls and GD (Choi et al., 2014). 
Interestingly, IGD, AUD, and healthy controls displayed less compulsivity than did GD on a 
set-shifting task (Choi et al., 2014). Additional neurocognitive differences have been 
observed (see following sections). Together, these data suggest differences between IGD and 
healthy populations as well as between IGD and other behavioral addictions, and these may 
be important considerations for treatment development (Dong and Potenza, 2014).

7.2  ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY

Resting-state EEG studies are used to evaluate intrinsic neural activity which is not elicited 
through a task. In a PIU population, lower absolute beta-band and greater absolute gamma-
band activities related to disorder severity and impulsivity measures (Choi et al., 2013). In 
those with comorbid depression, increased theta and decreased alpha-band power was found 
compared to nondepressed individuals with PIU where nondepressed individuals presented 
with decreased delta- and beta-band power compared to depressed individuals (Lee et al., 
2014). These resting-state data suggest these neurobiological differences may be markers for 
PIU.

Studies evaluating ERP activity, such as a Go/No-Go or Stroop task, may reflect facets 
related to impulsivity and error processing. In a Go/No-Go task, N2 amplitude was lower in 
PIU and P3 amplitude was larger with a longer latency, and decreased activity in conflict 
detection was observed compared to healthy comparison subjects (Dong et al., 2010). 
Relative to healthy comparison subjects, an incorrect response during the No-Go condition 
elicited a decreased amplitude of error-related negativity in individuals with IGD which was 
associated with impulsivity assessed via task performance and self-report (Littel et al., 
2012). Similarly, during Stroop performance, decreased medial frontal negativity, greater 
reaction times, and response errors were found during incongruent trials in the PIU group to 
the healthy comparison subjects (Dong et al., 2011). Together, these studies suggest 
differences in impulsivity which may be evaluated through ERP tasks, and which may relate

to deficits in conflict processing and have implications for treatment development (Dong and 
Potenza, 2014).

7.3  FUNCTIONAL MRI

Reward circuitry, cognitive control, cue reactivity, and craving fMRI tasks have implicated 
some similar brain regions in PIU and substance-use disorders (reviewed in van Rooij and 
Prause, 2014; Yau and Potenza, 2015; Yau et al., 2012). In particular, mesolimbic and 
cortical regions relating to reward/motivation and behavioral control may contribute to the 
pathophysiology of PIU. A recent meta-analysis found subjects with IGD showed abnormal 
activation of the medial frontal, medial temporal, and cingulate gyrus regions in response to 
a range of cognitive tasks (Meng et al., 2014).

Studies of functional connectivity may provide insight into how brain regions interact in 
circuits. Resting-state MRI has been used to investigate task-independent functional 
connectivity between regions of the mesolimbic system. Graph-theoretical approaches have 
identified connectivity in limbic regions including the amygdala, the insula, and dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) correlated with features of PIU and IGD (Ko et al., 2015; Wang et 
al., 2015). Similarly, less functional connectivity in executive-control networks was observed 
among individuals with IGD compared to control subjects (Dong et al., 2015). These brain 
networks have been implicated in substance addictions and may contribute to the 
development and maintenance of addictive behaviors. Altered connectivity between regions 
of the default-mode network has also been observed among individuals with PIU, and degree 
of connectivity was related to PIU severity (Wee et al., 2014).

7.4  STRUCTURAL MRI

Several studies have also investigated structural abnormalities that may relate to PIU. 
Reduced regional gray matter volume has been observed in key nodes of executive-control 
networks (e.g., frontoinsular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, dlPFC, and posterior parietal 
cortex) in association with greater PIU severity (Li et al., 2015). Furthermore, these 
differences correlated with performance on the Stroop task and may, therefore, reflect 
reduced inhibitory control and cognitive efficiency. Decreased cortical thickness (Hong et 
al., 2013) has also been observed in regions of the executive-control network among 
individuals with PIU.

In light of the recent DSM categorization changes relating to conditions with addictive 
potential, comparing PIU and substance-abusing populations may provide insight into the 
most appropriate categorization of PIU. Commonalities and differences exist between the 
two groups and a better understanding of this can help improve diagnosis (Yau et al., 2012). 
For example, among both IGD and alcohol-dependent populations, negative functional 
connectivity between the dlPFC and the OFC and positive connectivity between the dlPFC 
and the ACC have been observed (Han et al., 2015). However, subjects with IGD showed 
negative connectivity between the dlPFC and regions of the temporal lobe, and the striatum, 
whereas alcohol-dependent subjects had positive connectivity. Kim and colleagues (2015) 
recently found increased regional homogeneity in the posterior cingulate cortex in both IGD

and alcohol-dependent individuals; however, regional homogeneity appeared selectively 
reduced in the superior temporal gyrus in IGD.

7.5  DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING

DTI studies have suggested poorer white matter integrity in PIU, although not consistently 
(Yau et al., 2012). In one study of adolescents, lower FA was observed in the OFC, corpus 
callosum, cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, corona radiata, and internal and 
external capsules, with FA measures in the genu of the corpus collusum inversely correlating 
with measures of anxiety and those in the external capsule relating inversely correlating with 
PIU severity (Lin et al., 2012). A separate study found lower white matter density in the 
inferior frontal gyrus, insula, amygdala, and anterior cingulate in IGD subjects relatively to 
control subjects (Lin et al., 2015).

7.6  NEUROCHEMISTRY

Several neurotransmitter systems may contribute to PIU. Of these, the dopaminergic system 
has arguably received the most research attention. Years of problematic gaming was 
negatively correlated with D2-like receptor availability in the striatum and IGD subjects 
showed decreased glucose metabolism in the OFC, insula, and limbic regions (Tian et al, 
2014). In a separate study, dopamine transporter expression in the striatum was significantly 
lower in individuals with PIU compared to healthy control subjects (Hou et al., 2012).

Beyond the dopaminergic system, other neurochemical systems have shown differences 
which may underlie PIU. Recently, lower levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and cystolic, 
choline-containing compound (Cho) levels were observed in the medial temporal cortices of 
IGD patients. Additionally, lower levels of NAA and Cho in the right frontal cortex were 
also seen, and the NAA was inversely related to Young Internet Addiction Scale scores and 
perseverative responses during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (Han et al., 2014). Further 
study of the underlying neurochemical differences among individuals with PIU is needed in 
order to guide treatment development efforts.

8  GENETICS

Genetic mechanisms underlying PIU are poorly understood and currently only preliminary 
studies exists. As with disordered gambling, relationships between PIU and the Taq1A1 
allele of the DRD2 gene (Han et al., 2007) and homozygosity of the short allelic variant of 
the 5-HTTLPR gene (Lee et al., 2008) have been associated with PIU. However, these 
studies warrant replication and verification in larger samples, and other approaches (twin 
and GWAS studies) warrant undertaking.

9  TREATMENT

Few interventions have been systematically tested for PIU or IGD. Treatment strategies may 
be particularly important for adolescents and young adults given high prevalence estimates 
among these age groups (Spada, 2014).

9.1  BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT

Behavioral treatments have yet to be systematically studied in the context of PIU. 
Preliminary studies of CBT adapted for PIU (and more specifically in certain studies of IGD 
and problematic Internet pornography viewing) has demonstrated preliminary positive 
benefits (Twohig and Crosby, 2010; Wölfling et al., 2014; Young, 2013). Such CBT 
approaches aim to help individuals examine emotional motives and identify problematic 
cognition that may prompt them to engage excessively in online activities. As with 
disordered gambling, individuals are encouraged to explore alternative ways to satisfy those 
needs (e.g., developing other recreational pursuits) and to correct maladaptive thinking 
patterns. Family therapies involving increased socialization efforts have also been examined 
in PIU (Liu et al., 2015), with preliminary reports of possible treatment-related changes in 
striatal responsivity (Han et al., 2012). Other behavioral interventions (e.g., solution-focused 
brief therapy, mindfulness-based interventions) may also be helpful given the proposed 
addiction model of PIU but their efficacy has yet to be studied directly.

9.2  PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT

Psychostimulants, opioid-receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone), antiepileptics, 
antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine), antidepressants (e.g., bupropion), and glutamate-receptor 
antagonists have explored in treatments for PIU (reviewed in Camardese et al., 2012; 
Przepiorka et al., 2014; Winkler et al., 2013). Successful treatment may link changes in 
specific domains (e.g., depression, cognitive flexibility), and as in PG, comorbidity may be 
important to consider (Przepiorka et al., 2014). Although many pharmacotherapies have 
been explored in the treatment of PIU, placebo-controlled RCTs of significant size and 
duration are largely lacking, and as is the case with PG, no medications have approval by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with an indication for treating PIU or IGD.

10  FUTURE DIRECTIONS

While much research has been conducted recently on PG, PIU, and IGD, many research 
gaps exist, with arguably greater gaps and controversies for Internet-related behaviors and 
disorders. For example, research criteria for IGD have only recently been proposed, and 
these do not cover other forms of Internet use (e.g., social networking, pornography 
viewing) that might be problematic for individuals (Rehbein and Mößle, 2013). 
Additionally, the absence of agreed-upon criteria for PIU has led to marked variations in 
reported prevalence estimates and assessment of public health impacts (Petry and O’Brien, 
2013). While treatment development efforts for PG have led to the availability of efficacious 
behavioral therapies for PG, such studies are at earlier stages for PIU. For PG, PIU, and 
IGD, no pharmacotherapy trials have led to the availability of medications with FDA 
indications for the disorders. With respect to prevention efforts, healthy levels of 
engagement in gambling, gaming, and Internet use remain discussed and/or debated. In these 
efforts, potentially vulnerable individuals should be considered, especially youth. Other 
factors should also be considered; for example, most studies of PG, PIU, and IGD have 
focused on males, and sex differences warrant consideration, particularly for specific 
Internet-related behaviors like social networking. Additionally, health disparities related to 
race/ethnicity should also be considered. In this context, neurobiological findings should be
