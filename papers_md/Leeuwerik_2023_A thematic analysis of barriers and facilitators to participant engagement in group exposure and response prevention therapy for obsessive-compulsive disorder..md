Abstract
Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the gold stand-

ard in the treatment of the obsessive– compulsive disorder 

(OCD).  It  can  be  delivered  effectively  using  an  individual 

or group therapy format. Nonetheless, a sizeable proportion 

of  people  diagnosed  with  OCD  do  not  experience  OCD 

symptom remission following ERP. Research suggests that 

participant  engagement  with  ERP  tasks  predicts  therapy 

outcomes but there is little consistent evidence across stud-

ies  on  what  predicts  engagement.  A  recent  meta- analysis 

of  participant  engagement  in  cognitive- behavioral  therapy 

for OCD found that group ERP had a comparatively lower 

dropout  rate  than  individual  ERP.  Little  is  known  about 

participant perceptions of ERP to guide an understanding 

of how the group therapy format may affect participant en-

gagement.  This  study  conducted  a  qualitative  exploration 

of what helps or hinders participants' engagement in group 

ERP. It involved thematic analysis of semi- structured inter-

view data collected at a 6- month follow- up from 15 adults 

with OCD who took part in group ERP. The study identified

five main themes that captured participants' perceived facil-

itators and barriers to engagement in therapy: ‘Group pro-

cesses’, ‘Understanding how to overcome OCD’, ‘Personal 

relevance’, ‘Personal circumstances’, and ‘Attitudes towards 

ERP’, which captured dynamically inter- related barriers and 

facilitators at the level of the client, therapist, therapy and 

social environment. Each theme and associated sub- themes 

are  discussed  in  turn,  followed  by  a  consideration  of  the 

study's limitations and implications.

Practitioner Points

•  Delivering ERP as a group treatment can benefit normalisation, provide opportunities for 
testing obsessive beliefs about intrusions, and promote engagement in between-  and within- 
session ERP by creating a sense of belonging and accountability. However, group composi-
tion needs careful consideration; facilitators should acknowledge the heterogeneity of OCD 
and give due attention to mental compulsions and imaginal exposure.

•  In group ERP, non- attendance can undermine group morale, and this should therefore be 
addressed openly and proactively. Building 1:1 time into group treatment protocols could 
provide  a  vital  opportunity  to  anticipate  and  respond  to  clients'  reservations  or  concerns 
about group ERP.

•  Client expectations, motivation, readiness to change, self- efficacy, perseverance and com-
mitment can fluctuate over the course of therapy. These psychological factors are likely influ-
enced by psychoeducation (through facilitating insight into OCD and a clear understanding 
of the treatment rationale), personal circumstances, (early) success with ERP, perceived per-
sonal relevance of (within- session) ERP, and, in the context of group ERP, group processes. 
Therapists should therefore pay close attention to all these factors throughout therapy.

•  Clients with co- occurring depression may require greater between- session support to facili-

tate their engagement in ERP.

I N T RODUC T ION

This study aimed to explore what participants perceived to be the barriers and facilitators of engage-
ment in group exposure with response prevention treatment for obsessive– compulsive disorder (OCD). 
OCD is a debilitating mental health condition, characterised by recurring intrusive thoughts, images or 
urges that cause significant distress and/or repetitive physical behaviours or mental acts aimed at pre-
venting anticipated adverse consequences and alleviating distress (APA, 2013). Exposure and response 
prevention (ERP), delivered with or without added cognitive therapy (CT) strategies, is the psychologi-
cal therapy of choice (e.g. APA, 2007; NICE, 2005). It requires clients to engage in repeated, prolonged 
exposure to obsessions while refraining from compulsions, breaking the vicious cycle of OCD through 
a process of habituation (Kozak & Foa, 1997) and/or inhibitory learning (Craske et al., 2014).

LEEUWERIK et al.

Treatment  typically  starts  with  psychoeducation  to  inform  the  rationale  for  ERP  (e.g.  Kozak 
&  Foa,  1997),  followed  by  an  individually  tailored  formulation  of  the  person's  OCD  symptoms. 
Subsequently,  sessions  focus  on  in- session  (in- vivo  and  imaginal)  exposure  to  triggers  for  obses-
sions. Home practice of ERP is considered a key treatment component to consolidate learning, to 
ensure clients take responsibility for ERP without the implicit reassurance or safety offered by the 
therapist's presence and to enable exposure to triggers in their everyday environment (e.g. Franklin 
et al., 2005).

Exposure and response prevention is the gold standard and a highly effective therapy, yet research 
suggests that 35% of people diagnosed with OCD experience no discernible change in OCD symp-
toms  following  ERP  and  approximately  50%  do  not  achieve  remission  (Öst  et  al.,  2015).  ERP  is 
anxiety- provoking by design and often perceived as challenging (e.g. Olatunji et al., 2009). The moder-
ate response rate for ERP might therefore reflect variable client engagement. The latter can be defined 
as ‘all the efforts that clients make during the course of treatment towards the achievement of changes’ 
(Holdsworth et al., 2014, p. 430). Client engagement is multifaceted and can be operationalised as: (1) 
consistent attendance; (2) completing therapy on time; (3) active participation in session; (4) conduct-
ing between- sessions tasks; (5) developing and maintaining an effective client- therapist relationship 
and (6) developing and maintaining supportive, helpful interactions with other participants (Tetley 
et al., 2011).

Within the context of ERP for OCD, relatively little is known about (some of) these different facets 
of engagement. With regard to consistent attendance and treatment completion on time, a recent meta- 
analysis  of  participant  engagement  in  cognitive- behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  for  OCD  found  a  16.6% 
dropout rate for ERP (Leeuwerik et al., 2019). The pooled risk ratio was 2.45 towards early dropout. 
Some studies have shown that early dropout from ERP is associated with poorer treatment outcomes 
(e.g. Aderka et al., 2011) so it is important to understand what predicts it. The meta- analysis found a 
pooled mean number of 13 attended face- to- face sessions of CBT (all types: ERP, CT and a combination 
of both), in line with treatment duration guidelines (APA, 2007; NICE, 2005). The pooled proportion 
of attended (face- to- face) sessions was 87%, suggesting a relatively high degree of consistent attendance. 
However, results were based on a small subset of studies, suggesting this aspect of engagement is rarely 
examined.

When  considering  active  participation  in  session  and  conducting  between- session  tasks,  research 
into ERP task engagement is too limited and varied to meta- analyse ERP task completion rates; de-
scriptively,  a  small  body  of  empirical  studies  suggests  an  at  least  satisfactory  average  mean  level  of 
engagement in home practice (Leeuwerik et al., 2019). Some studies have shown that a high level of en-
gagement in between- session ERP is required to achieve symptom remission (Abramowitz et al., 2002; 
Simpson et al., 2011; Wheaton et al., 2016). This supports the central role of home practice in ERP and 
suggests it is a key aspect of engagement to understand and address.

Relatively little is known about developing and maintaining an effective client- therapist relationship. 
A few studies have shown that the working alliance, particularly the extent to which the therapist and 
client agreed on the tasks of therapy, was positively associated with post- treatment OCD symptom re-
duction, through its effect on client adherence to ERP (Simpson et al., 2011; Wheaton et al., 2016). Even 
less is known about supportive, helpful interactions with other participants and their association with 
treatment outcomes. Group ERP, delivered with or without cognitive strategies, appears as effective as 
individual ERP therapy (e.g. Öst et al., 2015) and can increase access to treatment, provided clients feel 
able to engage in it.

Although Kobak et al. (1995) theorised early on that the group format may facilitate engagement 
in ERP through normalisation, encouragement, behavioural modelling and social learning, very lit-
tle is known about how interactions with other participants impact treatment outcomes. Leeuwerik 
et al. (2019) found a significantly lower pooled dropout rate for group CBT (13%) than individual 
CBT  (17%).  However,  results  were  inconclusive  as  to  whether  peer  support  benefitted  treatment 
completion; this warrants further exploration. A recent review of the wider literature on CBT for 
anxiety  disorders  (Luong  et  al.,  2020)  found  just  three  studies  that  examined  the  association  of

group  engagement,  i.e.  ‘active  participation,  mutual  liking,  and  collaborative  climate  within  the 
group (p. 9)’ with (residential, inpatient) cognitive (processing) therapy outcomes, for social pho-
bia  (Bonsaksen  et  al.,  2011,  2013)  and  post- traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  (Ellis  et  al.,  2014), 
respectively.  Greater  group  engagement  predicted  greater  (client- rated)  anxiety  reduction  during 
(Bonsaksen et al., 2011) and post- treatment (Ellis et al., 2014) and at one- year follow- up (Bonsaksen 
et al., 2013). Luong et al. (2020) suggest that group engagement may facilitate a sense of cohesion 
that, in turn, promotes attendance, disclosure and active participation in treatment tasks. The above- 
mentioned studies did not explore predictors of group engagement, but Bonsaksen et al. (2011) con-
cluded, from examining the engagement process over time, that sample characteristics (including 
diagnosis), treatment model and setting were likely influential.

Overall,  the  extant  literature  suggests  it  is  important  to  address  client  engagement  in  ERP  to 
benefit  treatment  outcomes.  Yet,  despite  over  40 years  of  research  into  ERP  for  OCD,  relatively 
little is known about (interactions between) predictors of (facets of ) engagement over the course of 
treatment, to guide this. Quantitative research to date has failed to establish reliable, consistent and 
robust predictors of participant engagement with ERP therapy to support clinical practice (Knopp 
et al., 2013; Leeuwerik et al., 2019; Olatunji et al., 2013). Within quantitative research, approaches 
to  identifying  predictors  of  engagement  have  tended  to  involve:  (i)  post- hoc  exploration  of  vari-
ables for which data happens to be available; (ii) brief exit interviews with participants who drop 
out to understand reasons for non- engagement; (iii) extrapolating potential predictors of engage-
ment identified in relation to other presenting problems and/or therapeutic approaches and, rarely, 
(iv) evaluation of potentially important predictors as identified in theories of engagement, e.g. the 
transtheoretical model of readiness to change (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997; Taylor et al., 2012). What 
further ails this area of research is a lack of sophisticated measurement of both quantity and quality 
of engagement with key therapeutic tasks (e.g. Tetley et al., 2011), including in the context of ERP 
for OCD (Leeuwerik et al., 2019; Wheaton & Chen, 2021). Consequently, ‘remarkably little is known 
about this issue’ (Taylor et al., 2012, p. 586) and client engagement in psychological therapy is ‘rela-
tively under- theorised’ (Holdsworth et al., p. 428).

Qualitative research is well- placed to explore participants' experience of engagement over the course 
of ERP to inform a greater understanding of potential facilitators and barriers to engaging in ERP and 
drive a more theoretically informed approach to examining and addressing engagement in ERP (Bryant 
et al., 1999; Tetley et al., 2011). However, qualitative studies of participants' experience of ERP for OCD 
are few and far between. A thematic analysis of semi- structured interviews with eight participants in a 
group or individual ERP (Lee & Rees, 2011) highlighted they experienced ERP as anxiety- provoking 
but that the structured, graded approach to treatment, psychoeducation and combination with cognitive 
strategies aided engagement. Support from fellow participants, the therapist and family and friends was 
also important. Personal motivation and courage further helped sustain engagement in ERP. However, 
this study provided only a brief account of the experience of a few participants in group ERP, lacking 
more in- depth information to guide understanding.

Marsden et al. (2018) conducted a comparative thematic analysis of semi- structured interviews with 
adults with OCD who completed individual CBT (n = 10) and eye movement desensitisation and re-
processing (EMDR) (n = 14). General life difficulties such as physical illness, housing and employment 
issues and practical issues around the timing and location of sessions, impacted participants' ability to 
get the most out of therapy (CBT and EMDR). Some participants reported that the structure of sessions 
did not provide enough opportunity to express themselves, to the detriment of the client- therapist rela-
tionship and resulting in dropout. This highlights that specific therapy characteristics have the potential 
to influence engagement.

Bevan  et  al.  (2010)  also  provided  a  comparative  thematic  analysis  of  participants'  experiences  of 
intensive  (n  =  6)  and  weekly  (n  =  6)  individual  CBT,  gathered  through  a  semi- structured  interview. 
Participants commented on the benefits of the intensive format in reducing procrastination and man-
aging anxiety raised by ERP tasks. The intensive format was also experienced as motivating, suggesting 
that (preference for) therapy format could hinder or facilitate engagement.

A I M S

Findings from the aforementioned qualitative studies of predominantly individual ERP suggest that a 
range of individual, interpersonal, therapy- specific and extra- therapeutic factors may influence engage-
ment. However, they did not offer a more in- depth consideration of what may affect (the process of) 
engagement in group ERP. Therefore, this study aimed to explore what participants perceived to affect 
their engagement in group ERP for OCD, to contribute to a more targeted approach to improving client 
engagement in group ERP to benefit outcomes for people with OCD (Barrett et al., 2008).

Design and procedure

This study involved thematic analysis of semi- structured interview data collected at a 6- month follow-
 up from 15 adults with OCD who had participated in group ERP. Study data were part of a pilot RCT 
comparing  group  ERP  (n  =  18)  to  mindfulness- based  ERP  (MB- ERP)  (n  =  19)  therapy  for  OCD 
(Strauss et al., 2015, 2018). A lived experience advisory panel consulted on the development and imple-
mentation of the pilot RCT, which received full ethical approval through the South East Coast (Surrey) 
arm of the National Research Ethics System in the United Kingdom (reference: 13/LO/1768). The pilot 
RCT was pre- registered (ISRCTN52684820. Registered on 30 January 2014).

All pilot RCT participants were invited to participate in the interview at a 6- month follow- up. The 
current study reports on the qualitative analysis of the interview data from group ERP participants only. 
All interviews, ranging from 30 to 60 min, were conducted on NHS premises by a research assistant 
and were audio- recorded. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and anonymised by the first author.

Participants

Within  England,  improving  access  to  psychological  therapy  (IAPT)  services  routinely  deliver  ERP 
for  OCD  in  line  with  National  Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence  (NICE)  guidelines  (2005). 
NICE (2005) recommend guided self- help, group and individual ERP interventions as part of a stepped- 
care approach to treating OCD.

Participants in the pilot RCT were recruited from IAPT services in an NHS mental health trust in 
the south of England. The inclusion criteria were: (i) 18 + years of age; (ii) met DSM- IV diagnostic cri-
teria for OCD (APA, 1994) based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI 6.0.0] 
(Sheehan et al., 2010); (iii) if on psychiatric medication, stable dosage for a minimum of 3 months prior 
to starting therapy; (iv) no plans to change psychiatric medication during the study and (v) had not re-
ceived any psychological therapy in the 3 months before the current study, nor planned to engage in psy-
chological therapy during the study. At the time of the study, there were concerns about the suitability/
safety of a mindfulness- based intervention for people with a diagnosis of PTSD (as anecdotal evidence 
suggested that mindfulness practice could elicit distressing flashbacks and dissociation) or a diagnosis 
of  anorexia  (as  anecdotal  evidence  suggested  that  mindfulness  strategies  regarding  choosing  how  to 
respond  to  behavioural  urges  could  be  applied  to  strengthening  to  the  ability  to  choose  to  respond 
to hunger urges by not eating). The study started shortly after DSM- 5 was published, re- categorising 
people with hoarding problems into a separate category distinct from OCD as evidence was increas-
ingly  suggesting  that  hoarding  was  distinct  from  OCD  in  terms  of  its  underlying  development  and 
maintenance mechanisms. For these reasons, people meeting diagnostic criteria for these conditions 
were not included in the study. Exclusion criteria were: (i) identified organic cause for OCD symptoms; 
(ii) a diagnosed learning disability, psychotic disorder, PTSD, anorexia nervosa, alcohol dependence or 
substance addiction; (iii) hoarding- only compulsions (see Strauss et al., 2015, 2018 for further details).

PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT IN GROUP ERP FOR OCD 
134  | 

Fifteen of the 18 participants randomly allocated to the ERP condition (with eight participants in 
one ERP group and seven in another) completed the semi- structured interview. They all had a diagnosis 
of OCD at the start of treatment (as above). The mean depression severity of the sample was in the mod-
erate range (M = 27.80, SD = 14.37), as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory- Second edition 
(BDI- II) (Beck et al., 1996). See Table 1 for further details on sample characteristics.

Interview schedule

The semi- structured Change Interview (Elliott et al., 2001) was used in the pilot RCT to explore the 
perceived acceptability and benefits of ERP and MB- ERP as it was designed to ask participants about 
their  experience  of  psychological  intervention.  This  interview  consists  of  seven  main  questions  that 
invite interviewees to reflect on therapy change processes (Questions 1 and 2), what they attribute these 
changes to (Q3), helpful and unhelpful aspects of therapy (Q4 and 6) and factors that they perceive to 
enable or hinder them in making the most of the therapy (Q5 and 7). It was therefore also well- suited 
to the aims of this study.

Intervention: Group ERP

Treatment involved 10 two- hour, weekly sessions of group ERP (delivered through two courses). The 
protocol  (Van  Noppen,  Steketee,  &  Pato:  Group  Behaviour  Therapy  [GBT]  Treatment  Manual  for 
OCD, unpublished) was adapted to incorporate recommendations for delivering ERP in line with in-
hibitory learning theory (Abramowitz & Arch, 2014; Arch & Abramowitz, 2015). Two experienced clin-
ical psychologists, one of whom was an accredited CBT therapist with OCD expertise (CS), delivered

the treatment. An expert in ERP (EF) provided supervision to both group facilitators. The first session 
provided psychoeducation about OCD and introduced the rationale for ERP. From session 2 onwards, 
participants were required to design and conduct within-  and between- session ERP tasks (i.e. home 
practice).  Participants  were  strongly  encouraged  to  complete  their  planned  ERP  tasks  at  least  daily 
between sessions and record this using worksheets. All sessions included reviewing between- session 
practice and planning ERP tasks for the following week. Session 10 reviewed the course and invited 
participants to devise a personalised plan to consolidate learning (see Strauss et al. (2015) for further 
details).

Thematic analysis

The  Change  Interview  transcripts  were  analysed  using  reflexive  thematic  analysis  (TA)  (Braun  & 
Clarke, 2006, 2019), which offers a flexible approach to identifying, analysing and reporting themes 
within the dataset, allowing for a detailed and thorough description and rich interpretation of the data. 
Reflexive TA is an organic, open approach to analysing qualitative data that follows six iterative phases 
(Braun & Clarke, 2006; 2019). All extracts that broadly pertained to client engagement were included in 
the analysis. Initial codes were applied to any participant statement on what helped or hindered their en-
gagement in group ERP, where engagement was broadly understood to include session attendance and 
course completion, within-  and between- session ERP task engagement, the client- therapist relationship, 
and interactions with other participants, i.e. adopting Tetley et al.’s (2014) operationalisation of engage-
ment. An inductive orientation to coding was used and semantic (i.e. descriptive, participant- driven) 
codes that captured ‘explicitly stated ideas' (Braun & Clarke, 2019, p. 58) were applied to the data. GC, 
a clinical psychology master's student, and TL, an experienced clinical psychologist and doctoral re-
searcher, repeatedly read (phase i) and completed the initial coding of two interviews, comparing and 
discussing their initial coding to enhance the credibility of the analysis (Archibald, 2016). GC completed 
the initial coding of the remaining transcripts (phase ii) and clustered them into initial (sub- ) themes, 
capturing both endorsing and disconfirming views across participants (Elliott et al., 1999) (phase iii). 
Decisions about the relevance and clustering of initial codes into (sub-  and higher- order) themes (phase 
iv) were reached through group consensus (GC, TL and CS) (Harry et al., 2005), ensuring that the inter-
pretation of the data followed from the initial codes and associated extracts (Elliott et al., 1999; Madill 
et al., 2000). TL completed the final two phases of the analysis, i.e. defining and naming the themes 
and writing up the analysis. QSR International's NVivo 12 software was used to conduct the analysis.

R E SU LT S

Five main themes captured participants' perceived facilitators and barriers to engagement in group ERP 
(see Table 2). The associated sub- themes are discussed further below. The theme that was specific to 
it being a group treatment, i.e. ‘group processes’, is discussed first. This is followed by a discussion of 
themes that were not necessarily specific to it being a group intervention, even if they cannot be sepa-
rated from it as participant experiences were within a group context. Pseudonyms were used to protect 
participant confidentiality.

Group processes

(fear of) opening up

Some participants felt anxious about joining a group and opening up to the other participants, who were 
‘total strangers’ (Brian). Participants were not used to talking about their OCD to other people, feared

people's reactions, or generally did not feel comfortable in group situations. However, most participants 
tolerated their anxiety, e.g. by reminding themselves it was a recommended treatment, and it generally 
decreased quickly once they got to know the other group members.

Fear of ‘catching’ other people's OCD’

Hearing about other people's OCD symptoms caused some participants some initial concerns about ‘catch-
ing other people's OCD’(Charlotte) and contributed to Sadie dropping out because: ‘I didn't think I was 
strong enough to handle the worry of taking on everyone else's situation’. Oscar expressed ambivalence 
about hearing others talk about recognisable difficulties, as it ‘is sometimes much more acutely distressing 
than it is valuable’. Mostly, however, participants highly valued sharing experiences and feeling listened to 
and understood; it helped them to normalise their own intrusive thoughts and made them feel less alone.

Belonging and accountability

Some participants described developing a sense of belonging, ‘feeling part of the group’ (Alex), and ac-
countability that motivated them to attend sessions. Anticipating group discussion about home practice 
acted ‘like a prompt’ (Alex) to do between- session ERP whilst the sense of accountability also facilitated 
within- session ERP, as described by Luke ‘you think ‘well I've got to do something to sort of keep sort 
of on the same level as everyone”. Seeing other participants struggling to engage with ERP motivated 
some participants to keep on track, e.g. ‘It makes you think to yourself ‘well you did not do it either, 
then help yourself out” (Charlotte).

(shared) therapist support

Therapist support included practical assistance and emotional support, e.g. helping participants to cor-
rectly conduct and persist with ERP tasks, talking them through their home practice, providing encour-
agement and praise. Participants positively reflected on the therapists' expertise, understanding, warmth 
or ‘pastoral care’ (Oscar), which helped them to remain engaged, e.g. ‘…they were so understanding 
[…] that really helped ‘cos otherwise I wouldn't have come back’ (Charlotte). Knowing that therapists 
were there to support them made some participants feel less alone in dealing with OCD. Participants 
perceived that therapists moved at the group's pace, showing an interest in their feelings and doubts, 
adjusting sessions to their needs. Discussing home practice and praising achievements increased par-
ticipants’ confidence in their ability to conduct ERP independently. Moreover, therapists reflected on 
shared difficulties in conducting ERP, which enabled the group to come up with solutions. However, a 
couple of participants lacked the confidence or inclination to ask the facilitators for help, which affected 
their ability to engage in ERP.

Continuity

Non- attendance of group members resulted in different group configurations for some sessions, which 
some participants found frustrating, disappointing or difficult to understand: ‘It's like, ‘If me, you, you 
and you is doing it then why is no- one else?” (Brian). One participant lamented that this resulted in some 
repetition of course content. However, some participants felt that a smaller number of attendees allowed 
more time to talk and receive individual attention from the therapists.

Individual attention

Some participants found the relative lack of individual attention from the therapists, resulting from 
the group format, challenging. They would have liked some time alone with the therapists to discuss 
problems  that  were  difficult  to  share  in  a  group,  making  therapists  aware  of  important  personal 
circumstances or feeling reassured about their difficulties. This theme reflected that not all partici-
pants felt comfortable talking in the group (‘opening up’ sub- theme) or did not wish to take up time 
to  discuss  individual  difficulties.  However,  some  participants  felt  there  was  still  ample  scope  for 
individually tailored therapy, appreciating ‘…the ability of the staff to react to your specific needs’ 
(Oscar).

Understanding how to overcome OCD

Insight into OCD

Some participants stated that psychoeducation about OCD, particularly how avoidance and compul-
sions maintained OCD, changed their perspective on their symptoms and helped them gain the resolve 
to engage with ERP tasks, as illustrated by Michelle: ‘I'm just not doing it[ritual] and that does feel bet-
ter, I still feel a little bit guilty but I'm trying to make myself realise that I'm not achieving anything by 
doing that [the rituals], it's just the OCD taking over ’.

The  group  context  may  have  helped  facilitate  such  insight,  e.g.  Charlotte  described:  “It's  been 
helpful to look at the OCD model and fit myself into it. It's also been, also helpful then to see other 
people being fit in alongside it even though they've got very different issues, to see how it all fits in 
the same model.”

Understanding the treatment rationale

Most participants found that learning how and why ERP works, including psychoeducation about the 
(self- limiting) fight- flight response, motivated them to engage in ERP, e.g. ‘… it […] made me want to 
tackle it instead of dwelling on it’ (Helen), and increased their self- efficacy‘[…] you can be like ‘oh I can 
do this thing that I find really scary and it won't always be scary”(Isabel). Psychoeducation was revisited 
throughout therapy, which helped participants get to grips with ERP: ‘…it took quite a long time to 
actually grasp what I needed to do and why’ (Charlotte).

Personal relevance

Perceived relevance of ERP for obsessions without overt compulsions

Participants with obsessions without overt compulsions experienced challenges in successfully conduct-
ing (imaginal) ERP tasks: ‘…a lot of people suffer inside their heads, so that was difficult for them [the 
facilitators], to make a situation relevant’ (Adam). This created a sense that there was not a good fit be-
tween their symptoms and the therapy: ‘I didn't really fit into their system of exposure’ (Chloe). Several 
participants described trial and error in successfully triggering intrusive thoughts: ‘[…] they suggested 
things, and I tried it and they weren't really working for me so I had to sort of keep trying different 
things’  (Luke).  These  participants  also  expressed  some  disappointment  that  the  course  gave  mental 
compulsions relatively less consideration.

LEEUWERIK et al. 
 
     |  139

Perceived relevance of within- session ERP

Some participants experienced difficulties with within- session ERP tasks because their OCD symp-
toms predominantly occurred within their home environment. This contributed to their perception that 
engaging in within- session ERP tasks was not particularly relevant, e.g. ‘it wouldn't do anything for me’ 
(Adrian). For others, the artificiality of intentionally provoking their obsessional intrusions in the ses-
sion rendered it ineffective: ‘[…] sometimes trying to provoke that anxiety, because I knew I was doing 
it for that reason, was quite tricky’ ( Jessica).

Personal circumstances

Mental health

Some participants experienced depression and anxiety and/or severe OCD symptoms, which impacted 
their ability to confront OCD, e.g. Alex stated he ‘couldn't summon the kind of strength to … take 
the illness on’. It contributed to Adam missing sessions: ‘I was disappointed with myself that I didn't 
go as much as I wanted to…maybe ‘cos I do suffer with depression’. For some participants, OCD or 
co- occurring depression and/or anxiety symptom severity did not affect their attendance but hampered 
their ability to engage with between- session ERP tasks, e.g. ‘The anxiety mixed with like depression, 
made it kind of difficult [to prevent rituals]’ (Chloe).

Other challenges

For participants with children, difficulties securing childcare contributed to missing sessions. Other 
factors, such as the clinic's central location and job flexibility made it easier for some participants than 
others to attend (day- time) sessions. Life commitments made it hard to prioritise between- session ERP 
tasks for some.

Some participants experienced stressful life events and instability, e.g. moving to a new house, which 
affected their engagement. Conversely, suitable accommodation, e.g. having privacy, facilitated engage-
ment in between- session ERP tasks for others. For some participants, life transitions preoccupied them 
and made them question the timing of the course ‘…it's quite a bad time to like do anything’ (Isabel).

Support from family and friends

Family support with childcare enabled participants with children to attend sessions. Loved ones also en-
couraged participants to continue to attend sessions, or as Charlotte described: ‘helping me to find the 
wherewithal to go to the group each week’. Some participants found it helpful to ask family members to 
remind them to do their ERP tasks.

Attitudes towards ERP

Expectations

Participants  typically  discussed  their  expectations  when  asked  the  questions  of  what  personal  re-
sources or limitations may have made it easier or harder to make use of the therapy; they perceived their

140  | 

expectations to influence their ability to make use of the therapy. For example, Freddie commented 
‘I'm actually in general a quite lazy person so I'm quite surprised that I actually did any of the tasks …
maybe it was like a belief that it could, like, improve.’ Several participants longed to be rid of OCD alto-
gether, often coupled with an appreciation this was not necessarily realistic: ‘I have an illusion that you 
can be completely fine afterwards and not have it affect you at all, but I think that's obviously not the 
case’ (Isabel) as OCD can be a ‘life- long battle’ (Brian), and ‘it's more about learning how to cope with 
it’ (Charlotte). As therapy progressed, hopes of getting better typically increased but some participants 
described that this fluctuated: […] there are always times when you are uncertain if it's the right thing’ 
(Isabel). Therapists played an important role in helping participants to know what to expect, e.g. that 
starting ERP was going to be challenging. Therapists managed expectations about remission, which 
caused Charlotte some initial anxiety: ‘I suddenly thought: ‘Oh my God, I might not be fine, I might 
not be cured”. She subsequently felt that having a more realistic perspective helped to galvanise her:‘My 
new goal was to understand what we were trying to achieve and to be able to take things away to help 
myself afterwards'.

Motivation

Many participants described an inner drive or determination to face OCD head- on and engage in 
ERP tasks. Many participants felt they owed it to themselves to succeed and no longer wanted the 
OCD to take over their lives. Other participants were primarily motivated to engage with therapy 
for the sake of their children and families, wanting to set a good example, make their family proud 
or reduce the impact that OCD had on them, e.g. ‘I'd like to show that I can change and I can make 
life easier’ (Michelle).

Readiness to change

Most participants talked about whether they felt ready to change, e.g. ‘I'm at a point in my life when 
I thought ‘Enough is enough, I'm ready to receive help” (Charlotte), with some expressing they had 
no other choice than ‘facing things head on’, e.g. ‘I was just at the end of my tether […] I had to do it’ 
(Adam). Several participants with very longstanding OCD symptoms wanted more sessions to settle 
into treatment and fully engage in between- session ERP: ‘[…] with the knowledge of this session every 
week, I think in time […] I would have got better at that’ (Alex).

Self- efficacy

Many participants expressed that a sense of self- efficacy contributed to their engagement in therapy 
and vice versa: ‘I think my confidence and being able to do things has gone up […] realising it [ERP] 
is actually not that bad’ (Luke), ‘Some things you thought were impossible … you can sort of do them’ 
(Derrick). Other participants understood the rationale for ERP but lacked confidence in their ability to 
do it: ‘I don't really believe I can follow it’ (Oscar).

Commitment and perseverance

Commitment and perseverance were considered important attributes in tolerating the distress associ-
ated with ERP, particularly when motivation was at a low ebb: ‘Having the willpower, you know you 
don't like it, if you don't have that, it would be a very difficult thing’ (Derrick). This was also related to a 
belief that ERP would work and make them feel better, i.e. the credibility of the treatment, e.g. ‘…when 

LEEUWERIK et al. 
 
     |  141

I really did not want to do the tasks […] knowing that if you do these things, things can get better, has 
made me sort of push through when things seemed a bit hard’ (Luke).

DIS C US SION

This qualitative study examined participant perspectives on facilitators and barriers to engagement in 
group ERP for OCD. The five themes related to consistent attendance, effective working relationships 
with other participants and the therapist, and within-  and between- session participation in ERP (Tetley 
et al., 2011). Perceived barriers and facilitators to engagement in group ERP appeared to broadly come 
under group therapy (the ‘group processes’ theme), general ERP therapy (e.g. ‘understanding how to 
overcome  OCD’,  ‘personal  relevance’;  'attitudes  towards  ERP')  and  extra- therapy  factors  (‘personal 
circumstances’).

The  group- specific  theme,  i.e.  group  processes,  highlighted  that  most  participants  described  a 
sense of belonging and accountability to the group, reflecting effective working relationships with 
other participants. ‘Fear of opening up’ suggested participants' confidence in social situations and 
(feelings around) disclosure of OCD symptoms (initially) affected their ability to develop good work-
ing relationships with each other. The quality and availability of (individualised) therapist support, 
and (participants' reactions to the) continuity of the group also had the potential to affect engage-
ment with the group and with ERP. Participants in Lee and Rees (2011) similarly highlighted that 
being in a group was normalising and encouraging and that therapist support benefitted participants' 
engagement in ERP. Participant reservations about being in a group were also touched on by eligible 
participants in a trial comparing individual versus group therapy who refused group ERP based on 
general social anxiety, fears about catching other people's OCD symptoms, lack of personal attention 
and/or a sense of shame about their OCD symptoms (O'Connor et al., 2005). Overall, group pro-
cesses appeared to create a unique group ‘climate’ (Tasca et al., 2006; Paquin & Kivlighan, 2016) or 
‘cohesion’ (e.g. Burlingame et al., 2018; Kobak et al., 1995) that could promote or inhibit engagement 
in ERP. While a few studies of individual ERP have demonstrated that the client- therapist working 
alliance can affect treatment outcomes through its effect on ERP task engagement, this study sug-
gests the quality of working relationships between participants may also affect outcomes through its 
impact on participants' ability to ‘do the work required in therapy’ (Tetley et al., 2011, p. 928).

A general ERP therapy factor implicated in the themes ‘insight into OCD’ and ‘understanding the 
treatment rationale’ was the extent to which psychoeducation about OCD and the rationale for ERP res-
onated with participants and made the therapy seem credible. A few quantitative studies of engagement 
have found that the pre- treatment degree of insight (De Araujo et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 2011; Tolin 
et al., 2004) affects ERP task engagement. By extension, improving insight through psychoeducation is 
likely to positively affect engagement. Psychoeducation is tied up with therapist expertise and quality of 
delivery and bears the imprint of the client- therapist working alliance. In line with current study find-
ings, a recent review of research into homework completion for ERP (with adults or children) (Wheaton 
& Chen, 2021) concluded, based on a small number of studies, that participant understanding of the 
ERP rationale and agreement with the therapist on therapy tasks appeared to predict better homework 
completion.

The  perceived  personal  relevance  of  (within- session)  ERP  also  impacted  participants'  capacity  to 
engage in it and appeared to affect their sense of belonging, ability to share and compare experiences 
and their hopes and expectation of improvement. Findings also suggested that participants with mental 
rather than overt compulsions experienced ERP as less relevant and/or effective, which affected their 
engagement. This touched on the fact that OCD characterised by mental compulsions may be more dif-
ficult to treat with (imaginal) ERP than overt compulsions (Clark & Purdon, 1993; Steketee et al., 2019; 
Whittal et al., 2010).

The  ‘attitudes  to  ERP’  (sub- )theme(s)  resonate  with  theoretical  models  of  behaviour  change  (e.g. 
Prochaska & Velicer, 1997), studies of participant engagement in psychological therapy in general (e.g. 

PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT IN GROUP ERP FOR OCD 
142  | 

Holdsworth et al., 2014) and a few quantitative studies of ERP showing that motivation (e.g. Bachofen 
et al., 1999), readiness for change and treatment expectations (see Wheaton & Chen, 2021), predicted 
(between- session) ERP practice.

Some  themes  captured  extra- therapy  factors,  e.g.  they  reflected  that  client  characteristics  such  as 
the  nature  and  severity  of  (co- occurring)  mental  health  difficulties  may  affect  engagement.  This  is 
supported by anecdotal evidence suggesting OCD symptom severity and co- occurring depression may 
be associated with poor outcomes (e.g. APA, 2013; Foa et al., 1999; Salkovskis & Westbrook, 1989) and 
a systematic review showing a reasonably consistent pattern of a positive association between severity 
of OCD, anxiety and depression and drop- out status (Knopp et al., 2013). In this study, however, par-
ticipants perceived that (co- occurring) symptom severity did not necessarily affect dropout or session 
attendance  but  affected  their  ability  to  engage  in  between- session  ERP  tasks,  in  accordance  with  a 
review by Holdsworth et al. (2014) showing that within- session engagement did not necessarily corre-
spond with between- session engagement. However, Wheaton and Chen's (2021) review concluded that 
research was equivocal as to whether OCD symptom severity at baseline predicted homework comple-
tion; this warrants further exploration.

Participants' social context, including stressful life events and changes, job flexibility, childcare com-
mitments and access to social support, also seemed to affect session attendance and between- session 
ERP task engagement, including through its impact on readiness for change, motivation, commitment 
and perseverance. Marsden et al. (2018) similarly reported that general life problems affected engage-
ment among CBT participants.

There  appeared  to  be  many  reciprocal  relationships  between  (sub- )themes.  For  example, 
‘Understanding  how  to  overcome  OCD’  appeared  to  impact  participants'  motivation  to  initiate  and 
persevere  with  ERP.  Psychoeducation  may  affect  motivation  through  increasing  insight  into  OCD 
and understanding of the treatment rationale, as well as affecting self- efficacy and expectations about 
therapy. Motivation was bolstered by support from therapists, loved ones and a sense of accountabil-
ity and belonging to the group. Participant accounts in Marsden et al. (2018) similarly suggested that 
the therapeutic alliance influenced motivation, including by creating positive treatment expectations 
through (persuasive) psychoeducation about the treatment rationale. Participant expectations, readiness 
to change and self- efficacy all seemed to fuel motivation whilst commitment and perseverance, when 
motivation was low, was influenced by self- efficacy and the perceived relevance, or suitability, of the 
therapy. This resonates with theoretical perspectives that propose motivation is shaped by treatment 
expectations  and  self- efficacy  (Drieschner  et  al.,  2004).  Participants  also  described  a  reciprocal  rela-
tionship between early success with ERP and therapy engagement, seemingly through increasing mo-
tivation, perceived self- efficacy and the credibility of the therapy. Overall, study findings support the 
notion that motivation is ‘a dynamic treatment target to enhance participation’ (Holdsworth et al., 2014, 
p. 435).

Limitations

Participants were White British and were recruited through two UK NHS IAPT services in a mental 
health trust in the South of England, which limits the transferability of results. Participants took part in 
a pilot RCT and all but one completed therapy, suggesting they were perhaps more motivated than par-
ticipants in routine group ERP. Nonetheless, their accounts reflected struggles with engagement that 
are likely to resonate with adults who seek routine treatment for OCD. It is not inconceivable that those 
who chose not to participate in the interviews (at follow- up) were the least engaged in the intervention 
or otherwise represented a unique subset of participants whose perspectives on engagement were not 
included.

The interviews were conducted by someone independent of therapy delivery but were nonetheless 
potentially  subject  to  social  desirability  bias.  The  Change  Interview  invites  participant  reflection  on 
(un)helpful  aspects  of  treatment  and  personal  characteristics  and  circumstances  that  may  influence 

LEEUWERIK et al. 
 
     |  143

engagement, but does not exhaustively probe facets of engagement. Furthermore, the interviews were 
held at a 6- month follow- up; participants' accounts may have been influenced by whether they experi-
enced sustained therapeutic gain. The time frame may also have affected recall of their therapy experi-
ence, although it may have also allowed consolidation of learning and understanding of facilitators and 
barriers to engagement.

The study explored engagement within the context of group ERP and evidently does not necessarily 
elucidate what might affect engagement in individual ERP, although the findings resonated with quali-
tative evaluations of individual ERP (combined with CT).

Research implications

The  therapeutic  alliance  has  been  researched  widely  as  a  common  factor  of  therapeutic  change  (e.g. 
Wampold,  2015).  However,  the  interactions  and  relationships  between  participants  are  not  normally 
the focal point of therapeutic exploration and change in group ERP, yet clearly can influence engage-
ment  in  ERP  and  warrant  further  research.  Capturing  ‘live’  engagement  processes,  e.g.  through  re-
cording sessions, would allow exploration of how the group climate affects engagement (Elliott, 2010; 
Rhodes, 2011).

Whilst  some  of  the  study  themes  were  specific  to  ERP,  others  were  reflective  of  group  ther-
apy,  general  therapy,  and  extra- therapy  factors,  albeit  influenced  by  ERP  therapy  characteristics; 
e.g.  accountability  to  the  group  was  informed  by  the  fact  that  therapy  required  both  within-   and 
between- session ERP. Whether client engagement in ERP is aided or hindered by specific therapeu-
tic techniques and the nature of OCD symptoms or more likely to reflect common, trans- diagnostic 
and trans- therapeutic factors warrants further investigation (Wampold, 2015). The dynamic inter-
play between group therapy, ERP, general therapy and extra- therapy factors that affect engagement 
in group ERP could be examined further by developing a grounded theory of the process of patient 
engagement  in  group  ERP  (Corbin  &  Strauss, 2015).  Quantitative  research  involving  psychomet-
rically robust and repeated measurement of ERP practice and potential predictors of engagement 
identified in this study (Holdsworth et al., 2014) could similarly elucidate the engagement process 
and its relationship with therapy outcomes.

The results could also inform the development of a measure of client engagement for research or 
clinical purposes, e.g. to measure engagement across therapy. Findings also highlight the importance of 
taking account of OCD symptoms subtypes when examining engagement.

Further exploration of the themes from this study with people who dropped out from group ERP 
is also likely to advance understanding of what hinders participant engagement. The development of a 
semi- structured interview specifically designed to probe the various aspects of participant engagement 
would also benefit research in this area.

Clinical implications

Group  composition  and  group  cohesion  need  careful  consideration  as  they  may  get  in  the  way 
of  engagement  in  ERP.  This  need  to  be  openly  addressed,  e.g.  therapists  should  anticipate  and 
discuss  anxiety  clients  may  experience  about  being  in  a  group;  disclosing  OCD  symptoms  to  the 
group may be particularly challenging for clients with ‘forbidden’ thoughts (e.g. Kobak et al., 1995). 
Non- attendance could impact on remaining participants (Paquin & Kivlighan, 2016) and must be 
addressed proactively. The extent to which participants achieve success with ERP tasks could also 
affect the morale of the group.

As within- session ERP was not necessarily experienced as effective, home treatment should be con-
sidered when required (e.g. Rowa et al., 2007), taking into account the additional resource demands in 
publicly funded health care services. Therapists need to create a positive but realistic expectancy of the

efficacy of therapy, aided by appropriate psychoeducation. Clients with co- occurring depression may 
require more between- session support, e.g. between- session phone calls or home visits, to support their 
engagement in ERP.
