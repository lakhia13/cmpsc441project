Abstract 
Background  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) imposes significant burdens on individuals, families, and health-
care systems and the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated OCD symptoms. Currently, there are no vali-
dated prevention programs for OCD, highlighting a critical gap in mental health services. This study aims to develop 
and validate the first ØCD prevention program, for at-risk adults, utilizing cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
and exposure response prevention (ERP) techniques.

Methods  A single-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the ØCD prevention program to a waitlist control 
group will be conducted. Participants, at-risk adults (18–65 years) with subclinical OCD symptoms (OCI-R score ≥ 
12), will be recruited for the study. The ØCD prevention program compresise of six online group sessions incorpo-
rating CBT and ERP techniques over three modules. The primary outcomes are OCD symptom severity (measured 
by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory- revised form; OCI-R), depression symptoms (measured by the Patient Health 
Questionnaire; PHQ-9), and anxiety symptoms (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item; GAD-7). Sec-
ondary outcomes include OCD-related beliefs, experiential avoidance, resilience, quality of life, uncertainty intoler-
ance, automatic thoughts, and distress. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, at completion of the inter-
vention, and one year later (follow-up). At follow-up, we will also analyze the OCD diagnostic incidence, using 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. We will employ a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to explore 
whether significant differences exist between groups across dependent variables. To compare the OCD incidence 
levels from the pre-test to the follow-up we will use the chi-squared test.

Discusion  The present study may contribute novel data on the efficacy of OCD prevention approaches, leading 
to the development of an evidence-based OCD prevention program that could alleviate individual and societal bur-
dens associated with OCD.

Trial registration  This trial was approved by the University Ethical Review Authority (937/ 28.11.2023) at Babeș-Bolyai 
University and is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT06262464).

Article summary
Strengths and limitations of this study

•  First  study  to  develop  and  validate  an  OCD  preven-

tion program for at-risk adults.

•  The  program  integrates  psychological  prevention 

techniques from evidence-based treatments.

• Moderate expected rates of participants dropout

Background
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most 
debilitating  mental  health  disorders,  with  considerable 
burden  on  patients,  their  families,  and  health  services 
[19]. As a psychiatric disorder, it is characterized by the 
co-occurrence  of  recurring,  intrusive  obsessions  that 
induce substantial distress, along with compulsions—rit-
ualistic behaviors aimed at relieving the distress triggered 
by  the  obsessions  but  ultimately  resulting  in  additional 
distress and impairment (American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 2013). The prevalence estimates vary from 0.7-3% in 
adults [26],Adam et al., 2011), and 0.25-0.30% in children 
(Sadler et al., 2017; [17].

OCD has both direct costs, such as medical costs [16, 
18],  as  well  as  indirect  costs,  such  as  work  absenteeism 
due  to  impaired  functionality  and  lost  opportunities  for 
career  advancement  [9].  One  UK  study  [19]  found  that 
the overall cost-of-illness of OCD rises to £5,095,759,464, 
with  an  average  annual  cost-of-illness  of  £7077  per 
person.

Worryingly,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  seems  to  have 
led  to  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  OCD.  A  system-
atic  review  [22]  found  that  both  people  with  and  with-
out  diagnosed  OCD  before  the  pandemic  experienced  a 
worsening of OCD symptoms during the pandemic. One 
study  [25]  found  that  participants  reported  significantly 
higher  OCD  scores  during  the  pandemic  compared  to 
before  the  pandemic,  as  OCD  severity  increased  on  all 
symptom  dimensions  and  the  most  pronounced  change 
was on the washing dimension. Another review (Cunning 
&  Hodes,  2021)  found  that  the  COVID-19  pandemic  is 
associated with a worsening of OCD symptoms in young 
people and that being in treatment seems to have a pro-
tective  effect,  thus  underlining  the  importance  of  main-
taining  mental  health  services.  While  we  have  multiple 
evidence-based treatments for OCD, there are currently 
no  validated  protocols  for  the  prevention  of  general 
OCD. This is a major shortcoming, seeing as an effective 
prevention  program  for  at-risk  individuals  could  consti-
tute a preemptive strike against the high associated costs 
and burden of living that come with a diagnosis of OCD. 
Former  prevention  programs  for  depression  and  anxi-
ety usually carried out for adolescents and young adults, 
have varying rates of efficacy, but are overall considered 

successful  in  reducing  psychopathological  symptoms 
incidence in time (Conley et al., 207; Werner et al., 2021).
The development and validation of an intervention pro-
tocol  for  the  prevention  of  OCD  among  at-risk  adults, 
as  presented  in  the  ØCD  prevention  program,  are  thus 
paramount.  By  advancing  OCD  preventive  approaches, 
this  study  offers  hope  for  mitigating  the  long-term  con-
sequences of OCD and reducing the associated costs and 
burden on individuals and society.

Specific contents of the ØCD prevention protocol

The  program  involves  six  sessions  and  includes  estab-
lished components of CBT [4] and ERP [11], namely: (1) 
psychoeducation  and  encouragement  to  reduce,  change, 
or eliminate anxiety-reducing rituals (1 session), (2) cog-
nitive  restructuring  by  challenging  dysfunctional  beliefs 
(2 sessions), (3) behavioral changes by prolonged, imagi-
nal  and  real-life  exposure  to  distress-provoking  stimuli 
(2 sessions), (4) addressing ways and skills to reduce rel-
evant risk factors (i.e. fear of COVID-19) and to develop 
resilience factors (i.e. resilience levels, coping skills) and 
summary and recapitulation (1 session). The six sessions 
of  the  2  weeks  program  correspond  to  three  treatment 
modules  (3  hours/module).  An  overview  of  the  content 
covered in each stage is provided in Table 1.

Aim of the present study

The  main  objective  of  the  proposed  study  is  to  develop 
and  assess  the  efficacy  of  the  ØCD  prevention  program 
in  preventing  OCD  symptoms  and  reducing  associated 
symptoms  versus  a  waitlist  control  group.  In  this  sin-
gle-blind,  superior  randomized  controlled  trial,  we  will 
evaluate  the  efficacy  of  the  ØCD  prevention  program 
compared with a waitlist. If, as we hypothesize, the ØCD 
prevention program demonstrates superiority compared 
to  a  control  group,  it  has  the  potential  to  increase  the 
variety of evidence-based intervention options for adults 
at risk of developing OCD.

We  hypothesize  that  the  ØCD  prevention  program 
will  be  superior  to  a  control  group  in  the  reduction  of 
OCD  symptoms  as  measured  by  the  Obsessional  Com-
pulsive  Inventory  –  revised  form  (OCI-R;  [10]),  depres-
sive  symptoms  (Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9,PHQ-9; 
[20]),  and  anxiety  symptoms  (Generalized  Anxiety 
Disorder-7,GAD-7;  [29]).  The  intervention  also  cov-
ers  the  cognitive  component  of  OCD,  so  we  expect  a 
reduction  in  obsessive  beliefs  (The  Obsessive  Beliefs 
Questionnaire,OBQ-44;  [24])  and  automatic  thoughts 
(Automatic  Thoughts  Questionnaire,ATQ;  Steven  & 
Phillip, 1980). We also expect a reduction in experiential 
avoidance levels (The Brief Experiential Avoidance Ques-
tionnaire; EAQ; Gamez et al., 2014), intolerance of uncer-
tainty  (Intolerance  of  Uncertainty  Scale:  IUS;  [5]),  and

Methods
Study design and ethical aspects

We  will  conduct  a  single-blind  (blinded  outcome  asses-
sors),  randomized 
(1:1),  controlled,  parallel-group, 
superiority  trial  comparing  the  ØCD  prevention  pro-
gram with a control group (waitlist) for adults at risk of 
OCD.  The  study  is  registered  on  clinicaltrials.gov  (ID: 
NCT06262464).  All  quality  and  safety  aspects  will  be 
regularly monitored by an external party: the University 

Ethical  Review  Board,  and  by  the  financing  authority  of 
the  project  (National  Authority  for  Scientific  Research). 
The  study  has  been  approved  by  the  University  Ethical 
Review  Authority  (937/28.11.2023).  Potential  protocol 
modifications will be described in detail on clinicaltrials.
gov. We used the SPIRIT reporting guidelines [6].

Participants will be asked to provide informed consent 
before  baseline  assessment.  They  will  receive  detailed 
information about the study and their right to withdraw 
from the study without the obligation to give reasons. We 
do not expect major relevant risks for participants during 
the study, or after the study is completed. The time bur-
den for the participants will be a reasonable amount. The 
data  collection  and  storage  will  be  conducted  according 
to GDPR legislation, and all personal data will be securely

stored  on  the  University’s  encrypted  servers,  following 
the set data management guidelines.

Sample size

G*Power  was  used  for  the  sample  size  calculation  and, 
following an effect size of d=0.3 with a n alpha level of α 
= 0.05 and power of 0.95, a sample size of 175 was sug-
gested. Based on this power analysis and expected drop-
out rates, we aim for 200 participants (100 per treatment 
arm).  The  Consolidated  Standards  of  Reporting  Trials 
flow chart of the trial is shown in Figure 1.

Recruitment

by agreeing to the terms and the conditions of the study. 
Participants  are  queried  about  the  criteria  for  inclusion 
and  exclusion,  following  which  eligible  individuals  are 
selected  through  randomization.  The  planned  flow  of 
participants can be consulted in Figure 2.

Therapists  are  from  the  clinical  psychology  master’s 
program.  We  recruited  four  terminal  year  students  fol-
lowing  an  introductory  meeting  on  the  purpose  of  the 
study  and  the  procedures  involved.  The  expected  time 
expenditure  for  the  therapists  will  be  9  hours  per  week. 
Before  implementation,  all  therapists  will  have  partici-
pated in a training supported by the study coordinator.

Participants are recruited online, using social media plat-
forms  to  promote  the  study.  By  clicking  the  enrolment 
link, participants read the study information section and 
the informed consent form, which can be signed digitally, 

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Participants are included if they are of legal age (above 18). 
We  include  participants  who  have  an  OCI-R  [10]  score 
at  or  above  the  cut-off  point  on  the  OCD  subscale  (≥  12).

(3) a personality disorder diagnosis, and (4) suicidal ideation.

Procedure and randomization

Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  verified  based  on 
the screening form completed by the participants. Eligi-
ble participants are randomly allocated to one of the two 

conditions in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization is conducted by 
a  member  of  the  research  team,  using  the  online  tool, 
randomizer.org.  The  allocation  sequence  is  generated 
through a computer-generated random sequence for the 
two study conditions. The following study personnel will 
remain blind to group allocation until the final data anal-
yses are completed: principal investigator, data managers, 
and outcome assessors.

Outcome measures

For  participants,  the  baseline  assessment  will  take 
place  after  randomization  and  include  a  set  of  validated 
questionnaires.

Primary outcome measures
Obsessional Compulsive Inventory ‑ Revised (OCI‑R; [10])

OCI-R  is  a  self-report  questionnaire  of  18  items,  and  it 
measures OCD symptoms across six subscales: washing, 
checking,  neutralising,  obsessing,  ordering,  and  hoard-
ing.  OCI-R  was  used  in  the  initial  screening  of  eligible 
participants,  where  the  OCD  subscale  (which  excludes 
the  hoarding  component)  was  used  to  determine  par-
ticipants  who  are  at  risk  of  developing  OCD  symptoms 
(cut  off  point  (≥  12).  For  the  present  study,  the  reduc-
tion  in  OCI-R  OCD  subscale  assessment  is  the  primary 
outcomes.

Patient Health Questionnaire‑9 (PHQ‑9; [20])

PHQ-9  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used  measures  of 
depression  and  it  is  based  on  the  diagnostic  criteria  for 
major depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual (DSM-IV; APA, 1994). Scores vary from 0 to 
27,  where  a  greater  score  indicates  more  severe  depres-
sive symptoms.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder‑7 (GAD‑7; [29])

GAD-7 measures symptoms of anxiety, based on the gen-
eralized anxiety disorder criteria in DSM-IV; APA, 1994). 
Respondents  evaluate  the  level  of  their  symptoms  over 
the  last  two  weeks  and  a  cut-off  score  greater  than  10 
indicates further evaluation is recommended.

Secondary outcome measures
Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ‑44; [24])

OBQ-44  is  a  self-report  scale  that  measures  belief 
domains  linked  to  OCD.  The  three  subscales  are  (1) 
responsibility/threat  estimation,  (2)  perfectionism/cer-
tainty, and (3) importance/control of thoughts.  Answers 
are rated on a 7-point scale (1 = “disagree very much” to 
7 = “agree very much”).

Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ; Hollon & Kendall, 
1980)

The Romanian version of ATQ [23] is a 15-item measure 
that evaluates self-reported negative thoughts. The ques-
tionnaire  was  developed  to  measure  the  most  frequent 
negative  thoughts  and  negative  self-evaluations,  typi-
cally associated with depression. Answers are rated on a 
5-point scale (1 = “not at all” to 5 = “all the time”) and the 
total score ranges from 15 to 75.

Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (BEAQ; Gamez 
et al., 2014)

The BEAQ is a 15-item self-reports questionnaire that meas-
ures  experiential  avoidance.  Items  are  rated  on  a  6-point 
Likert scale (1 = “strongly disagree” to 6 = “strongly agree”). 
Item  6  is  a  reversed  item,  and  scores  range  from  15  to  90 
points. Higher scores reflect higher experiential avoidance.

Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS; [5])

The  IUS  is  a  27-item  measure  that  evaluates  how  indi-
viduals  relate  to  uncertainty.  It  contains  items  such  as 
“Uncertainty  makes  me  uneasy,  anxious,  or  stressed”,  “A 
small  unforeseen  event  can  spoil  everything,  even  with 
the best of planning” and “When I am uncertain, I can’t 
go  forward”.  Answers  are  rated  on  a  5  points  scale  (1  = 
“not at all characteristics” to 5 = “entirely characteristic”)

General Health Questionnaire‑12 (GHQ‑12; [15])

The  GHQ-12  consists  of  12  items,  each  assessing  the 
severity  of  a  mental  issue  over  the  past  few  weeks. 
Answers are rated on a 4-point Likert scale, from 0 to 3. 
A total score of 36 can be generated, by rating the posi-
tive  items  from  0  (always)  to  3  (never)  and  the  negative 
ones from 3 (always) to 0 (never), so that a higher score 
indicate worse health.

Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA; [13])

The RSA is a 43-item measure with five factors: personal 
competence,  social  competence,  family  cohesion,  social 
support, and personal organization. Answers are rated on 
a 5-point Likert scale from 1 = “not at all” to 5 = “a lot”).

WHO Quality of Life ‑ BREF (WHOQOL‑BREF; [28])

WHOQOL-BREF is one of the most widely used assess-
ments of quality of life. In the current study, we will use 
the  global  item  of  the  instrument  (How  would  you  rate 
your quality of life), answered on a 5-point Likert scale.

Post-intervention  assessment  will  take  place  immedi-
ately  after  the  intervention  is  completed  and  will  include 
the same measures, as well as the Client Satisfaction Ques-
tionnaire-8  (CSQ-8;  [21]).  The  assessments  will  be  com-
pleted  online,  using  the  Qualtrics  platform.  We  will  also 
perform one follow-up assessment six months later, using 
the same measures and the Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM-5 to compare the OCD diagnostic incidence.

Statistical analyses
Data analysis

Demographic and clinical data will be reported as means 
and  SDs  for  continuous  parametric  data,  medians,  and 
ranges  for  non-parametric  data,  and  frequencies  and 
percentages  for  categorical  data.  Only  two  authors  will 

Cardoș et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:348 

Page 7 of 8

have  access  to  the  final  trial  dataset.  To  illustrate  par-
ticipant flow, we will report results in a CONSORT dia-
gram.  Data  analysis  will  be  conducted  using  SPSS  for 
Windows version 25. Given the anticipated dropout rate, 
mixed models will be employed as the most suitable sta-
tistical  method.  This  approach  is  well-suited  for  analyz-
ing  repeated  measures,  accounting  for  the  dependency 
between  observations  and  handling  missing  data  effec-
tively. Mixed models will be adjusted for baseline values 
of  the  repeated  measures.  Descriptive  statistics  will  be 
generated  to  summarize  the  means  and  proportions  of 
baseline clinical and demographic variables across treat-
ment  conditions,  allowing  for  the  assessment  of  poten-
tial  imbalances.  Fixed  effects  in  the  model  will  include 
time,  treatment,  and  their  interaction.  In  cases  of  miss-
ing  data,  these  variables  will  also  be  included  as  fixed 
effects. The significance of the time*treatment interaction 
p-values  for  various  outcome  measures  will  be  assessed 
using  the  Benjamini–Hochberg  procedure  (two-sided  p 
<  0.05).  Time  will  be  treated  categorically,  with  the  first 
post-baseline measurement serving as the reference cat-
egory. To address the correlation among repeated meas-
urements,  a  first-order  autoregressive  (AR  (1))  structure 
will be imposed on the residuals. Furthermore, the inter-
action  effect  between  time  and  group  will  be  explored 
by analyzing estimated marginal means at different time 
points.  We  anticipate  a  significant  interaction  effect 
between  time  and  group,  signifying  differential  changes 
in  scores  over  time  between  the  two  treatment  condi-
tions. Specifically, we expect a more pronounced decline 
in scores over time in the prevention group compared to 
the control group. To assess the statistical significance of 
improvements  in  the  treatment  conditions,  a  least  sig-
nificant difference test will be conducted with estimated 
marginal  means  to  compare  changes  between  groups. 
Linear mixed models are expected to reveal a statistically 
significant decline in the prevention condition from pre-
test to post-test, with no significant differences between 
post-test and follow-up measures. To facilitate compari-
sons  with  other  studies,  Cohen’s  d  statistic  will  be  cal-
culated  to  determine  within-group  effect  sizes.  In  cases 
where the proportion of missing data exceeds 10%, maxi-
mum likelihood imputations will be performed based on 
demographics and pretreatment scores. Additionally, the 
proportions  of  dropouts  and  diagnostic  incidence  (from 
pre-test to follow-up) in the two treatment groups will be 
compared using the chi-square test.

Discussion
According to the most recent clinical advances guide for 
OCD [12], a greater effort needs to be made at multiple 
levels  (e.g.,  education,  treatment  services  development, 

and screening of ‘at-risk’ individuals) to implement effec-
tive  strategies  for  prevention,  early  diagnosis,  and  inter-
vention.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  we  will  develop 
the  first  evidence-based  cognitive-behavioral  prevention 
program  for  OCD  for  at-risk  individuals.  The  study  will 
provide  novel  data  about  the  efficacy  of  OCD  preven-
tive strategies. Implementing the prevention program in 
normal healthcare would significantly enhance the avail-
ability of effective prevention programs to persons at risk 
of developing OCD. The potential benefits of such a pre-
vention  program  extend  beyond  individual  participants 
to encompass broader societal and research impacts. By 
intervening  early  to  prevent  the  onset  of  OCD  symp-
toms, the program could alleviate strain on mental health 
services,  reduce  healthcare  costs,  and  improve  over-
all  well-being.  Moreover,  the  research  generated  from 
implementing  and  evaluating  this  innovative  prevention 
approach could inform future interventions and contrib-
ute to advancing our understanding of OCD prevention.

Trial status

Inclusion  started  in  March  2024  and  is  expected  to  end 
in October 2024. At the time of submission, 121 partici-
pants had been randomized. Data analysis and reporting 
of results will begin when all data from the primary end-
point has been collected.
