Abstract: Depression is a major global health concern expected to worsen by 2030. In 2019, 28 million
individuals were affected by depressive disorders. Dietary and supplemental vitamins show overall
favorable preventative and therapeutic effects on depression. B vitamins are crucial for neurological
function and mood regulation. Deficiencies in these vitamins are linked to depression. Studies
on individual B vitamins show promise in improving depressive symptoms, particularly thiamin,
riboflavin, niacin, and folate. Vitamin C deficiency may heighten depressive symptoms, but its exact
role is not fully understood. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is associated with insufficient sunlight
exposure and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation for SAD shows inconsistent results
due to methodological variations. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms
of vitamins in depression treatment. Moreover, more research on SAD and light therapy’s efficacy
and underlying mechanisms involving photoreceptors, enzymes, and immune markers is needed.
Although dietary and supplemental vitamins show overall favorable preventative and therapeutic
effects on depression, dietitians treating psychiatric disorders face challenges due to diverse study
designs, making direct comparisons difficult. Therefore, this article reviews the current literature to
assess the role of dietary and supplemental vitamins in the prevention and treatment of depression.
This review found that, although evidence supports the role of B vitamins and vitamins C and D in
preventing and treating depression, further research is needed to clarify their mechanisms of action
and determine the most effective intervention strategies.

1. Introduction
1.1. Depression

Depression is one of the top causes of disease burden worldwide [1–4]. Despite
considerable advances in pharmacology and therapy techniques, the general population
prevalence of depression has not declined [5,6]. In 2019, it was estimated that depressive
disorders affected 280 million people [7]. The prevalence of depressive disorders varies
across the world, but the 12-month prevalence estimated by the World Health Organization,
World Mental Health (WHO, WMH) survey ranged from 2.2% to 10.4%, with a median
of 5% across all countries [8]. Depression is a major public health concern identified as a
national [9] and global priority [10].

While depression has been recognized as a major health burden, its definition is still
debatable [4,11]. Depression is usually described by most psychiatrists as a disorder that is
common [4,6,8,9,11], serious [8], debilitating [6,11], and potentially lethal [5,6,8,9,11], limit-
ing psychosocial functioning [4,8,9], and generally diminishing the quality of life [4,6,8,11].
Depression has been recognized as a serious life modifier and has been identified as a

contributing factor to reduced work productivity [12–14], increased substance abuse [15,16],
family dysfunction [17,18], and reduced life expectancy [5,19]. Depressed individuals may
experience one or more of the myriad symptoms that vary at different levels of inten-
sity gradually but progressively across a lifetime. However, some individuals also may
experience abrupt, sudden-onset and/or prolonged episodes of depression [20]. Addi-
tionally, most patients’ course of illness is episodic in nature, and a sense of homeostasis
is experienced between acute depressive episodes [20]. Symptoms can be specific to a
particular depressive disorder and can be categorized as neurovegetative, emotional, or
cognitive. Neurovegetative symptoms, such as changes in appetite and sleep patterns,
may follow various daily/seasonal patterns [4]. Those who suffer from depression tend to
make associations between concepts of depression such as hopelessness and worthlessness
resulting in intensified negative self-views [20].

Treatment of depression requires an interdisciplinary approach including psychologi-
cal therapy, pharmacotherapy, or both [4,21,22]. Moreover, a properly balanced diet and
appropriate supplementation are essential for optimal health. It is important to note that
vitamins are more efficiently absorbed from dietary sources rather than from supplements.
Although more than half of those affected by a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) recover
within six months, and two-thirds to three-quarters of those recover within a year, up to
27% of patients do not recover and develop a recurring depression [4,23]. Furthermore,
those who have recovered can still experience residual symptoms such as a lack of energy
and motivation [24].

1.2. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can be described as a form of recurrent depression
in which the episodes occur annually, and the severity of the episode varies [25,26]. The
prevalence of SAD is estimated to vary from 1.4 to 9.7% in Northern America and 1.3–3.0%
in Europe [25], affecting more women than men [27], with a ratio varying between 3.5:1
and 9.0:1 [25]. When SAD was initially discovered, it was defined as a syndrome in which
depression episodes developed during the fall/winter with remitting episodes during
the spring or summer that lasted for at least two consecutive years [26]. Currently, the
classification of SAD has been updated and is not considered a unique diagnostic entity;
rather, it has been classified as a type of bipolar disorder or depression known as MDD
with Seasonal Patterns in the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders [25,28–31]. The first
episode of seasonal affective disorder occurs around the age of 30, and symptoms are
closer to non-seasonal depressive symptoms such as insomnia, poor appetite, weight loss,
agitation, and anxiety [25].

The episodes of SAD are accompanied by common depressive symptoms and atypical
autonomic nervous symptoms [26].
In comparison to SAD, other forms of recurrent
depression occur throughout the year independent of the season. Furthermore, the intensity
of the symptoms varies. Although SAD has been recognized as a psychiatric disorder and
introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), its identification as a valid
and specific disorder remains controversial and the syndrome does not have a specific
diagnostic category [29]. Currently, various questionnaires such as the Seasonal Beliefs
Questionnaire (SBQ), Seasonal Health Questionnaire (SHQ), Seasonal Pattern Assessment
Questionnaire (SPAQ), and the Seasonality Assessment Form have been used to determine
whether a clinical diagnostic interview is needed [32]. The SPAQ is the most commonly
used screening tool for SAD [31].

1.3. Diet and Micronutrients as Preventive and Therapeutic Approaches

Proper nutrient intake can alleviate some of the symptoms of depression and SAD.
Supplementation of B, C, and D vitamins has been studied to alleviate depressive symp-
toms. Over the past two decades, there has been an increasing recognition of the role
of diet and dietary bioactive components as a significant modifiable risk factor in the
prevention and treatment of the wide spectrum of mood disorders including depression.

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

Dietary nutrients, particularly certain vitamins, have shown promise in the prevention and
improvement of depressive symptoms, regardless of individual self-efficacy and levels of
physical activity [33–37].

Numerous observational studies have underscored the link between poor dietary
habits and deteriorating mental health. Restricted diets including improperly planned diets
that eliminate animal products may carry the risk of deficiencies in certain vitamins and
minerals [38]. In contrast, certain nutrients have shown favorable effects by enhancing
mood, which is closely aligned with the principles of the Mediterranean diet, featuring
lean meats, fish, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and nuts. Notably, these food groups
are abundant in vitamins, suggesting a possible mediation of the relationship between
mood and dietary patterns through the intake of these essential micronutrients. Vitamins
B, C, and D have been implicated in promoting brain health and mood stability, while
deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, or vitamin D are linked to elevated risk and occurrence
of depression [33–37]. The current literature is not consistent in supporting the role of
vitamins in the prevention and treatment of mood disorders and more specifically depres-
sion. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review current studies and assess whether
B vitamin, vitamin C, and/or vitamin D supplementation is instrumental as an adjacent
treatment for depression and SAD (Table 1).

2. Methodology

The databases used to conduct this literature search were PubMed, UNF One Search
through the UNF Library, and Google Scholar. The study types included randomized
control trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies, animal studies, cohort studies,
and systematic reviews. A combination of keywords including B vitamins, vitamin C, vita-
min D, depression, seasonal affective disorder, seasonal depression, randomized control
trials, animal studies, clinical trials, winter blues, summer depression, light therapy, and
vitamin supplementation were used to find relevant studies. The effect of supplementation
of vitamins in adults 18 years of age and older with symptoms or at risk of depression
was also investigated. The inclusion criteria encompassed all randomized controlled trials,
animal studies, clinical trials, and systematic reviews investigating the role of B vitamins,
vitamin C, and vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of depression, seasonal affec-
tive disorder, and seasonal depression in adults. Exclusion criteria included non-English
publications, non-peer-reviewed articles, and studies with children as participants. Studies
whose participants had metabolic abnormalities due to medical conditions including hy-
perparathyroidism, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, Crohn’s disease, and cystic fibrosis
were excluded; studies in which the primary focus was another major psychiatric condition
such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders, were also excluded.

3. Etiology of Depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder

The causes of depression remain unclear with possible etiologies being multi-factorial

including low serotonin levels, stress, and inflammatory mechanisms. Several non-modifiable
and modifiable factors, including genetics, environmental factors (such as life events, low
social support, and financial problems), and lifestyle behaviors, including diet, may play
critical roles in the incidence of depression and anxiety [39]. Notably, the role of food intake
and dietary patterns in the development of mental diseases has been recognized [40–42].
Although difficulty regulating the neurotransmitter serotonin is believed to be responsi-
ble for balancing mood and abnormal melatonin metabolism was initially suggested as
a potential underlying mechanism, more recent studies proposed inadequate exposure
to sunlight as the main contributor to the etiology of SAD. Standard treatment includes
antidepressant medications, light therapy, and vitamin D supplementation, along with
counseling [30,31]. Both preventative and therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation
on seasonal affective disorder (SAD) have been studied.

4. Vitamins and Depression

Comparing studies in this field has proven challenging due to the diverse study designs
employed by researchers, including variations across intervention regimens (e.g., types,
dosage, frequency, and duration), participants’ demographics (e.g., age range, gender, and
health status), measured parameters, type of mood disorder, and overall study design.

4.1. B Vitamins

B vitamins are recognized as regulators of numerous immune functions, with defi-
ciencies associated with various cancers. Moreover, they are referred to as “neurotropic”
vitamins due to their neurospecific functions, playing significant roles in both the central
and peripheral nervous systems [43]. The beneficial role of B vitamins in brain health and
mood is well established [33–35] while their deficiencies (e.g., B12 or folate deficiency) have
been linked to a higher risk and incidence of depression [36]. Consequently, there are calls
for greater acknowledgment of nutritional deficiencies, or suboptimal nutrient status, as
contributors to the underlying causes of depression and other psychiatric conditions [44,45].
However, research on the effect of dietary B vitamin intake on depression has been limited.
Studies have explored both the collective therapeutic role of B vitamins and their individual
effects. Furthermore, investigations have also examined how the status of B vitamins may
affect the effectiveness of other therapeutic approaches. There is limited research on the
therapeutic effects of dietary vitamins in depression, as most studies have primarily focused
on vitamin supplementation. The primary focus of studies in the field was on the effects of
B vitamins in clinically depressed, medicated participants [44,46]. Therefore, it is difficult
to separate the direct effects of supplementation from those resulting from interactions
between B vitamins and antidepressants. Although these results provide valuable insights
into the effectiveness of B vitamins as an adjunctive therapy alongside medication, their
results cannot be conclusive when it comes to the sole benefits of B vitamin supplemen-
tation alone. Additionally, due to altered structure and function of neural architecture
in depression [47,48], it is difficult to understand the preventative effects of B vitamin
supplementation in depression.

Moreover, the difference in the baseline of the vitamins and nutrients status in general
is another factor that may influence the effectiveness of B vitamins in the treatment of
depression and other mood disorders [49]. There is increasing evidence that suboptimal
nutrient status, below clinical deficiency criteria, may be a risk factor for poor functional
status [45,50]. While it is crucial to determine whether individual B vitamins are effective,
it is also critical to consider these findings in the context of baseline nutrient status, dietary
habits, and co-administration of other nutrients as part of the intervention.

Many studies implemented a group of B vitamins as a therapeutic approach in their
studies, and this can be due to the interdependence of B-group vitamins within the methyla-
tion cycle [12,34]. The polymorphism in methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is one

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

5 of 29

of the factors determining the effectiveness of B vitamin therapy in depression. Therefore,
a combination of B-group vitamins should be more effective than supplementation with B6,
B12, or folate alone, as they are all involved in methyl metabolism.

4.1.1. Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)

Vitamin B1, also known as thiamin, plays a critical role in the function of the neu-
rological system. Thiamin deficiency has been associated with mood disorders, anxiety,
and depressive symptoms [51]. Historically, thiamin was initially named aneurin due to
its connection with “beriberi” resulting from dietary deficiency of thiamin. In developing
countries, thiamin deficiency continues to be a prevalent issue, primarily attributed to the
widespread consumption of white rice since it lacks bran which is the source of thiamin [52].
Adequate levels of thiamin in the diet during development is crucial, as a deficiency can
lead to significant cognitive impairments by the age of five, due to impaired brain develop-
ment [53]. In a cross-sectional study on 9848 adults, 4.38% were diagnosed with depression.
Vitamin B1 and B3 intake mixture were negatively associated with depression [54]. Simi-
larly, in a study on 34,700 participants, thiamine intake was strongly associated with lower
risks of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, depression, and dyslipidemia [55].

While there is a substantial body of evidence linking dietary thiamin status to neuro-
logical functions, there is a limited number of studies that have specifically investigated its
therapeutic effects in mood disorders and depression. In one study, a correlation between
poor thiamin nutritional status and an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms was
shown [56]. In this cross-sectional study involving over 1500 elderly Chinese individuals
aged 50 to 70 years, a correlation between lower levels of erythrocyte thiamine (likely
indicative of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) bound to transketolase (TKT)) and increased
severity of depressive symptoms were observed. Moreover, previous research identified a
direct correlation between thiamine deficiency and symptoms of major depressive disorder
(MDD) in a sample of 74 individuals with a history of malnutrition [57]. These results were
further supported by another study involving 118 geriatric patients [58], although no data
regarding dietary thiamine intake were provided. Supplementation of thiamin has shown
promising results in numerous studies. The therapeutic effects of thiamin supplementation
as a palliative measure for postpartum depression (PPD) look promising and may play
a crucial role in the subsequent cognitive development of the infant. In elderly women
with marginal thiamin deficiency, a six-week supplementation led to enhanced general
well-being, increased activity and energy levels, improved sleep patterns, and alleviation
of depression symptoms [59]. Moreover, Nguyen et al. reported thiamin and niacin intake
had negative trends and was observed as the most important factor negatively associated
with depression [55]. In another study, a co-supplementation of thiamin with riboflavin
and pyridoxine in geriatric patients resulted in improved depression and cognitive function
scores compared to a placebo group [60]. Moreover, the role of thiamin supplementation as
an adjuvant therapy for patients with MDD has also been studied. In a study including
patients, administration of thiamin alongside conventional treatment led to noticeable
improvements in depressive symptoms within six weeks [61]. In mouse-induced PPD,
improvement in depressive symptoms and anxiety-related behaviors, assessed through
tests such as the forced swimming test and elevated plus-maze, were observed in the
mothers following thiamin, zinc, and magnesium administration on postpartum day 3.
Additionally, there was an increase noted in the total antioxidant capacity [62]. These
findings collectively suggest that thiamin deficiency contributes to depression and that
supplementation can effectively mitigate associated symptoms.

4.1.2. Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)

The association between riboflavin and depression has been studied [40,63–65]. Previ-
ous studies have shown an inverse relationship between riboflavin and psychological dis-
orders [66,67]. Dairy products are the primary source of riboflavin. In a more recent study,
higher intake of riboflavin showed a protective effect against depression [65]. Similarly, a

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

6 of 29

cross-sectional study including adult populations showed reduced odds of depression with
the highest riboflavin intake [67]. In another cross-sectional study including psychiatric
inpatients, a significant inverse relationship between riboflavin intake and endogenous
depression was observed [66]. In a cross-sectional study on 98 female clinical nurses (45 de-
pressed), marginal riboflavin deficiency was more prevalent in depressed subjects [68]. In
this study, depression status was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory.

Additionally, a study including 6517 adolescents showed that B2 intake was inversely
associated with depressive symptoms in females but not males [40]. In an observational
study, the mental component score (MCS-12) was positively correlated with vitamin A,
vitamin C, riboflavin, and folate [43]. Moreover, a meta-analysis of six epidemiological
studies showed an inverse association between riboflavin intake and depression [69]. In a
cross-sectional study on 314 HIV–infected adults, approximately 26% of the participants
experienced depression [70]. Moreover, more than 67% of the individuals consumed B
vitamins below the estimated average requirements (EAR).

In this study, low riboflavin consumption was associated with a higher risk of depres-
sion in females but not males. While the exact mechanism remains unclear, it has been
suggested that female gonadal hormones may alter serotoninergic activity in the brain,
affecting the regulation of monoamine levels such as serotonin and leading to higher levels
of depressive symptoms [71].

4.1.3. Vitamin B3 (Niacin)

Niacin is a nutritional precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which are essential cofactors for
mitochondrial energy metabolism [72]. Niacin both plays a major role in neuroprotection
and is vital for the normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) and neuronal
development [73]. The relationship between niacin intake and depression has been studied
extensively. Altered synthesis of niacin metabolites can lead to various neuropsychiatric dis-
orders [74]. Niacin deficiency may lead to reducing oxidative phosphorylation and impairs
mitochondrial respiration [75]. The trinity of brain energy deficit, mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion, and oxidative stress might exert a role in the development of depression [76,77].
Indeed, niacin supplementation improves symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and depres-
sion [78,79]. Moreover, niacin may cure NAD deficiency [75]. Antidepressants may lead to
a decrease in niacin and NAD in patients with poor intake [80].

Nephrotic syndrome or chronic diarrhea can lead to niacin deficiency despite regular
intake [81]. However, the response to niacin therapy can be varied due to the variation
in genetic background. Niacin has also been used as a diagnostic tool. Niacin affects the
skin and is activated via the arachidonic acid–cyclooxygenase pathway. This activation can
lead to skin flushing symptoms, known as the niacin skin flushing reaction. This reaction
may indirectly reflect the level of oxidative stress in the body and could hold potential
diagnostic value in psychiatric disorders [82]. The niacin response biomarker may serve as
a schizophrenia endophenotype [83].

Additionally, the “niacin skin blunting response” has high diagnostic value in adoles-
cent patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder [84]. Moreover, niacin skin sensitivity
is elevated in adolescents at risk for psychosis [85]. In one study, thirty-eight cases of acute
episodes of depression in unmedicated adolescents and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy
controls were included, all of whom were stimulated with six concentration gradients of
niacin solution on the forearm skin, and the skin flushing area was applied as an assessment
index. The total area of redness of the skin in response to niacin was significantly lower in
the adolescent depression group than in the healthy adolescent group [83]. However, in an-
other study, when patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 16), and depression (n = 16)
were compared with healthy controls, no significant difference in skin flushing between
depressed patients and control was observed, but the difference between schizophrenic
patients and the control group was striking [86].

4.1.4. Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)

Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is frequently regarded as an ‘antistress
factor’ and plays a crucial role in the normal development of the central nervous system. It
contributes to the synthesis of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter associated with depression.
Deficiency in pantothenic acid can result in fatigue and depressive symptoms. Research
indicates a correlation between low pantothenic acid levels alongside other B vitamins’ defi-
ciency and depressive symptoms in school children aged 6–9 years [87]. Furthermore, there
is evidence suggesting that higher nutrient intake, including pantothenic acid, is linked to
improved mental health outcomes such as mood, depression, and mania scores [88]. Con-
sequently, further studies on nutrient intake, particularly pantothenic acid, are warranted
to explore its potential as a treatment option for individuals with mood disorders, anxiety,
and depression.

4.1.5. Vitamins B6, B9, and B12 (One-Carbon Metabolism)

Three B vitamins, B6, B12, and folate, are known as cofactors in one-carbon metabolism.
The essential role of these B vitamins in one-carbon metabolism may link B vitamin status
with mood [89]. It may explain why a complete spectrum of B vitamins contributes to
the interconnected cellular processes responsible for homocysteine homeostasis and DNA
methylation. Therefore, deficiencies in one or more of these vitamins may impair methyl
metabolism that may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia [90]. Elevated homocysteine is a
risk factor for not only cardiovascular diseases but also for poor mood. There is a line
of evidence supporting the link between hyper-homocysteinemia and poor mood [91].
In one study, up to 30% of depressed patients have elevated homocysteine levels [91].
Therefore, while deficiency of these vitamins may increase the risk of mood disorders,
supplementation with B group vitamins including B6, B12, and folate aimed at lowering
homocysteine levels would be expected to support improvements in mood outcomes.

4.1.6. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)

Vitamin B6, comprising pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, plays a crucial
role in mood regulation and is strongly implicated in both the onset and management of
depression [92]. The role of vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate, PLP), another B vitamin
involved in one-carbon metabolism, has also been investigated. PLP plays a crucial role
in the synthesis of neurotransmitters including noradrenaline, serotonin, and gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) [93], thus affecting mood and anxiety levels. Deficiency in this
vitamin can lead to elevated homocysteine levels, which have been associated with seizures,
migraines, and depression. Pyridoxine supplementation has been shown to lower blood
plasma homocysteine levels in patients with schizophrenia and improve accompanying
mood disorders, including minor depression [94,95]. An association between low serum
pyridoxal levels and major depression in 18 individuals exhibiting depressive symptoms
is reported [96]. PLP exhibits positive effects on overall health, mood, and cognition [33].
Moreover, in females, PLP supplementation (100 mg/day) has shown favorable effects in
improving premenstrual symptoms and depression [97].

Furthermore, higher intakes of vitamin B6 and B12 may reduce depression in older
adults [98]. A combination of magnesium (300 mg/day) and vit B6 (30 mg/day) supple-
mentation for eight weeks resulted in significantly lower Depression Anxiety Stress Scales
(DASS-42) stress subscale scores in adults diagnosed with depression [99].

4.1.7. Vitamin B9 (Folate)

The link between depression and folate deficiency is well documented [100–102]. Folate
deficiency increases the vulnerability to depression [103,104]. Moreover, folate deficiency
exacerbates depressive symptoms [102], and prolongs depressive episodes [105]. In a meta-
analysis, researchers found that individuals with depression had lower folate levels than those
without depression [106]. Consistently, in another meta-analysis, a significant association
between low folate and B12 levels and depression was observed which was also gender-

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

8 of 29

dependent: A positive association between low B12 but not folate levels and depression only
among women was observed [107]. Finally, the risk of depressive symptom relapse may also
increase in cases diagnosed with folate deficiency [108]. Several underlying mechanisms by
which folate status is linked to depression and other mood disorders have been suggested:
First, the role of folate in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is one of the major
mechanisms by which folate is connected to the depression [100–104]. S-adenosylmethionine
has a key role in the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, the neurotransmit-
ters with a strong link to depression. SAM is also one of the regulators of tetrahydrobiopterin
synthesis, a cofactor in neurotransmitter synthesis [100,105,109,110]. Folate deficiency may
lead to decreased levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, thereby creating a
neurochemical predisposition to depression. Second, elevated homocysteine levels due to
folate deficiency is another potential mechanism by which folate status may link to depression
and other mood disorders, since a strong positive correlation between elevated homocysteine
levels and the severity of depressive symptoms has been reported [91,103]. A correlation
between low serum and/or red blood cell (RBC) folate levels and elevated plasma homocys-
teine concentrations is well established. A strong correlation between low folate levels in
individuals with depressive disorders has been consistently identified. Shorvon et al. [111]
reported folate deficiency in 56% of patients with affective disorders. It was consistent with
AbouSaleh and Coppen’s [112,113] observations indicating that patients diagnosed with
major depressive disorder had significantly lower serum and RBC folate levels compared to
healthy controls. Furthermore, reduced serum folate concentrations were associated with
increased depression severity. Carney et al. [114] discovered that RBC folate levels were
notably lower in depressive patients compared to those with other psychiatric conditions.
Additionally, associations between disease severity, duration, and folate status have been
observed. A recent study by Morris et al. [115] identified low folate status in depressed
individuals aged 15–39 within a general US population sample. Finally, genetic factors
affecting folate metabolism may impact the risk of depression. Methyltetrahydrofolate
reductase (MTHFR) facilitates the conversion of methyltetrahydrofolate, thus exerting a
significant indirect impact on homocysteine remethylation. An association between genetic
factors that impair the metabolism of homocysteine and depression is reported. A link
between the C677T TT genotype of the MTHFR enzyme and depression has been reported
as the carriers of the TT genotype are 1.37 times more likely to be diagnosed with depres-
sion compared to those with the CC genotype [116]. In another study on patients with
major depression, the prevalence of the TT genotype was more than double in patients
compared to controls [117]. In another study, anxiety and depression were measured in
5948 subjects within two age-range groups (46–49 and 70–74 years old) in Norway. A strong
positive correlation between plasma homocysteine levels and increased risk of depression
was observed.

The TT genotype of the MTHFR gene was also associated with an increased risk
(69%). However, low plasma folate was correlated to depression only in 46–49-year-old
women [118]. Folate status may also influence the therapeutic outcomes. The therapeutic
efficacy of both sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and nortriptyline,
a tricyclic antidepressant, is dependent on the baseline RBC folate levels. In geriatric
depression, a higher folate status predicted a more favorable outcome, with the association
being particularly pronounced for sertraline [119]. Interestingly, antidepressant therapy
has been found to coincide with an elevation in RBC folate levels, contingent upon both
folate and vitamin B12 status. Moreover, this increase was more significant in responders
compared to non-responders [120]. The therapeutic properties of SAM alone or along with
antidepressants in the treatment of depression are well documented [121,122]. Both folate
and B12 are involved in SAM synthesis. The therapeutic effects of folate supplementation
on depression received considerable study. Folic acid exhibited antidepressant-like effects
in open-field and sucrose preference tests. Folic acid treatment effectively increased the
levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, BDNF and β-endorphin, and interleukin-6, and
homocysteine levels were also significantly suppressed by folic acid administration [123].

The antidepressant effect of folate is well documented. In chronic unpredictable mild stress-
induced Sprague–Dawley rats, folate supplementation exhibited antidepressant-like effects
in open-field and sucrose preference tests. It increased the levels of monoamine neurotrans-
mitters, and homocysteine levels were suppressed [123]. In another study, supplementation
of 15 mg of folic acid on a daily basis improved symptom relief and social adaptation
in severely depressed patients with low RBC folate levels (<200 ng/mL) compared with
control group [124]. In another study, the effect of folate was compared with trazodone;
both 50 mg of folic acid and 100 mg daily of trazodone showed comparable effects. Notably,
in this study, RBC folate levels were within normal range [125]. Consistently, in another
clinical study, supplementation with methyl folate (15 mg/day for 6 months) enhanced
the therapeutic effects of standard psychotropic treatment in 41 patients with major acute
depression or schizophrenia. The RBC folate levels were low at baseline [126]. The synergic
effect of folate with other medications has also been investigated. In a study on depressive
patients, supplementation of 0.5 mg/day of folic acid along with 20 mg/day of fluoxetine
improved the therapeutic effect of fluoxetine by 61.1% compared with fluoxetine alone in
the placebo group. In this study, a decrease of over 50% in Hamilton rating scale scores
for 93.3% of patients was observed. Moreover, folate reduced the homocysteine levels
significantly (by 20.6%) only in women [109]. In a meta-analysis of three clinical trials,
Taylor et al. found that folate may boost the effect of antidepressants by reducing Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores on average by a further 2.65 points [102]. The
effect of a combination of folic acid, B6, and B12 on symptoms of depression has been also
studied. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, supplementation of daily folic acid
(2 mg), vitamin B6 (25 mg), and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) for 1 to 10.5 years in survivors of
stroke resulted in a lower hazard of major depression compared with the placebo group
(18.4% vs. 23.3%) [127]. In summary, substantial evidence now indicates a reduction in
plasma folic acid levels, and it could be due to hyperhomocysteinemia associated with
folate deficiency among individuals with depression. However, the favorable effect of
folate supplementation on depression and other mood disorders is not clear and needs
further study.

4.1.8. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

The role of vitamin B12 in the etiology and treatment of depression has also been
investigated. Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin primarily synthesized by bacteria in
the human body. Insufficient intake of this vitamin can result in symptoms such as fatigue,
weakness, constipation, balance problems, mental fog, peripheral tingling, depression,
and cognitive impairments [128,129]. Moreover, lack of Castle intrinsic factor may lead
to vitamin B12 deficiency despite sufficient intake. It can be due to atrophic gastritis, or
AIG—autoimmune gastritis [130]. Vitamin B12, in conjunction with folate and vitamin
B6, plays a crucial role in one-carbon metabolism. Consequently, the numerous functions
associated with folate regarding depression and other mood disorders can also be extended
to encompass vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency has a major role in the etiology of
depressive symptoms [131].

Deficiency of vitamin B12 in patients diagnosed with depression has been well docu-
mented [132–135]. In a study in the Indian population, neurological problems were more
prevalent in vegetarians, with poor vitamin B12 status [135]. Pregnant women with vitamin
B 12 deficiency were more prone to depression which was accompanied with hyperho-
mocysteinemia [136]. Hyperhomocysteinemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency is one of the
key mechanisms connecting vitamin B12 to depression and other mood disorders. The
effect of supplementation of B12 in the treatment of depression has also been studied [137].
Higher consumption of vitamin B12 and B6 was associated with a lower risk of depressive
symptoms [98]. In a randomized controlled trial, daily supplementation with oral vitamin
B12 (100 mcg) and folic acid (400 mcg) resulted in an increase in cognitive function [138].
Moreover, antidepressant therapy corresponded to an elevation in red blood cell (RBC)
folate levels, with responsiveness. Folate levels in RBCs are dependent on both folate and

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

10 of 29

vitamin B12 statuses. This increase was notably more pronounced in responders compared
to non-responders [139].

4.1.9. Vitamin B7 (Biotin)

Vitamin B7 is essential for cell growth and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. In
cases of severe depression and delirium, treatment with biotin has shown improvements
in symptoms [140]. Inherited biotinidase deficiency in newborns can lead to neurological
abnormalities [141]. In a clinical trial, individuals diagnosed with depression either received
a multi-strain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus placebo for 28 days [142].
Psychiatric symptoms were improved in both groups. The number of studies on the
role of biotin in depression is extremely limited. Further research is needed to fully
understand its role in depression. The interactive effects of biotin and microbiota on
symptoms of depression have been studied. In a clinical study, 82 individuals diagnosed
with depression were randomly divided into two groups. One group received a multistrain
probiotic along with biotin treatment, while the other group received biotin alongside
a placebo for a duration of 28 days. Both groups showed significant improvement in
psychiatric symptoms. However, the probiotics group exhibited a higher abundance
of Ruminococcus gauvreauii and Coprococcus, as well as increased β-diversity. KEGG
analysis revealed heightened activity in inflammation-regulatory and metabolic pathways
within the intervention group. The authors suggested that the beneficial effects observed
with probiotic treatment combined with biotin may indicate the effectiveness of probiotic
therapy in individuals with depression [142].

4.2. Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)

Vitamin C plays a crucial role as an antioxidant in the brain and serves as a co-factor in
the synthesis of neurotransmitters including adrenaline and other neurotransmitters [143,144].
The central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to oxidative damage due to an abundant
amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids and transition metals when the levels of endoge-
nous antioxidants in CNS is relatively low [145,146]. Oxidative damage in the CNS has
strongly been associated with anxiety disorders [147], psychosocial stress [148], and de-
pression [149–152]. The need for vitamin C in excessive stress is higher to sustain normal
brain function which is due to the disproportionate utilization of nutrients during stress
responses, essential for synthesizing stress hormones, alongside higher demands for cellu-
lar energy production [153–155]. Lower plasma concentrations of antioxidants, including
ascorbate [156], α-tocopherol [157], and antioxidant enzymes [158,159] are reported in de-
pressive individuals which may explain the increased levels of lipid peroxidation in these
individuals [160,161]. The lower plasma concentrations of antioxidants are accompanied
by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation end products in patients diagnosed with anxiety
disorders [160,161]. Moreover, the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, which
regulate mood, appetite, and sleep, in chronic stress may compromise as priority shifts
towards producing survival hormones rather than those that promote stability, calmness,
and restful sleep [153,154]. The impact of vitamin C supplementation (1000 mg/day)
on stress and anxiety by assessing the effects of high-dose sustained-release vitamin C
(1000 mg) supplements in a group of 60 young adults over 14 days was assessed. The
authors suggested that supplementation of a high dose of vitamin C, but not dietary vi-
tamin C, yields anxiety- and stress-lowering effects. In another clinical study, researchers
found that chronic social isolation stress induces weight gain and depressive-like behavior,
but this effect is diminished by vitamin C [162]. In mice, depressive-like behavior and
hippocampal synaptic dysfunction induced by corticosterone promptly reversed with a
single administration of vitamin C [163].

It has been suggested that there is a potential link between clinical depression and
the onset of scurvy [164]. Depletion of vitamin C has also been linked to heightened
depressive symptoms [165]. A potential relationship between vitamin C deficiency and
depressive symptoms is proposed in a case study. A 52-year-old colon carcinoma patient

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

11 of 29

developed scurvy, accompanied by decreased appetite, fatigue, weakness, anhedonic
behavior, and depression. Subsequently, supplementation with vitamin C (1 g/day for
7 days, followed by 1.5 g/day for 7 days, orally) resolved both the scurvy and depressive
symptoms in this patient [166], consistent with findings from previous literature [167–169].
Nevertheless, gulo knockout mice deprived of vitamin C did not show any significant
change in immobility time in the tail suspension test, in contrast to gulo knockout mice
that were supplemented with vitamin C [170,171]. Although the underlying mechanisms
by which vitamin C deficiency is connected to depression are poorly understood, it has
been suggested that chronic vitamin C deficiency can result in reduced activity of the
enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase, thereby impairing the hydroxylation of dopamine (DA)
to norepinephrine (NE) and consequently lowering NE levels [171].

4.3. Vitamin D (Calciferol)

Vitamin D (calciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is obtained from (1) ultraviolet (UV)
irradiation to the skin that stimulates a conversion of cholesterol (7-dehydrocholestrol), (2)
plant-based foods in the form of D2 (ergocalciferol), and (3) animal-based foods in the form
of D3 (cholecalciferol) [172–175]. Vitamin D, upon ultraviolet exposure or dietary ingestion,
metabolizes to its active forms of calcidiol [25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D)] in the liver
and calcitriol [1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2 D)] in the kidneys and other tissues
for communication between cells and hormone signaling [172–174,176].

As a multifunctional hormone, calcitriol is involved in calcium homeostasis by promoting
calcium absorption in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract to prevent hypocalcemia tetany [172,173].
Other functions of vitamin D include reducing inflammation (anti-inflammatory), cell growth,
neuromuscular and immune function, and glucose metabolism [172]. The photochemical
conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 via UV irradiation can be influenced by
various factors including altitude, season, time and length of the day, clouds, and smog. An
average of twenty minutes per day of sun exposure provides 50–90% of the daily vitamin D
recommendation, and the remainder can be obtained from dietary sources of vitamin D [177].
Fatty fish, dairy, liver, eggs, soy, and fortified foods are good dietary sources of vitamin D;
however, the bioavailability of vitamin D from animal sources is more effective at raising
serum 25(OH)D concentrations than plant-based food sources [173,178].

A factor that may affect vitamin D efficacy includes the use of topical sunscreen and
UV–protective clothes hindering vitamin D conversion. Age may also play a role as older
adults decline in absorption rate of calciferol within the GI tract and through skin [177,179].
Darker skin pigmentation has higher melanin content which reduces vitamin D synthesis
through sunlight exposure [177,179]. Body weight, body composition, and health condi-
tions may also influence vitamin D status [179]. Gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., Crohn’s,
celiac disease, malabsorption syndrome such as lactose intolerance, and short bowel syn-
drome) have shown a negative impact on vit D absorption [177,179]. Thompson et al.
indicated that malabsorption was evident with orally administered vitamin D3 in patients
diagnosed with celiac disease, biliary obstruction, or pancreatic dysfunction [180]. Gastric
bypass surgery, liver and kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis,
histoplasmosis, and lymphoma cancer are among other health conditions that diminish
vitamin D absorption [177]. Vitamin D drug interactions may also affect vitamin D sta-
tus. Medications that activate the pregnane X receptor (PXR) can interfere with vitamin
D-responsive elements (VDRE) at DNA transcription and affect the expression of genes
that are ordinarily regulated by vitamin D [181]. Glucocorticoids, bisphosphonates, anti-
estrogens, cytostatic agents, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, and antituberculotic drugs
may also disrupt vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D functions [181].

4.3.1. Vitamin D and Depression

The association between vitamin D supplementation and depression episodes has been
extensively studied; however, the results are inconsistent. In a randomized control trial,
participants (n = 18,353) who were at risk of incident depression or recurrent depression

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

12 of 29

were given 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3 as a supplement for a period of 5.7 years. The treatment
with vitamin D3 did not result in a statistically significant difference compared with the
placebo in the incidence and recurrence of depression or clinically relevant depressive
symptoms or change in mood scores [182]. Similar results were observed in a double-blind
randomized controlled clinical trial including 152 participants supplemented monthly
with 50,000 IU vitaminD3 for six months [183]. Although lower levels of plasma vitamin
D in participants with higher depressive symptoms were reported in both studies, no
therapeutic effect of high vitamin D intake and supplementation on depressive symptoms
was observed, which was consistent with the results reported by another study where
participants presented both low levels of vitamin D and major depressive disorders [184].
In comparison, significant improvements in well-being were reported by all participants in
a randomized control trial [185]. In this study, 164 participants were randomly assigned
to two groups and received either 15 or 100 mcg/day of vitamin D for six months. The
group supplemented with 100 mcg/day of vitamin D reported higher levels of “well-being”
than the group supplemented with 15 mcg/day. Two questionaries were used to assess the
participants’ “well-being”, the first of which included a series of questions about mood,
sleeping patterns, and energy levels. The second set of questions focused on other aspects
of well-being, such as appetite, social factors, and general health. These questions were
used to assess participants’ overall “well-being” [185].

In an observational study, vitamin D-deficient individuals had 3.5 times higher odds of
developing clinically significant depression in comparison to those with sufficient vitamin
D after adjusting for confounding variables [186]. However, the beneficial effect of vitamin
D on depression was not corresponding to the recommended nutritional level defined
as RDA in previous studies while higher concentrations above RDA might have a more
significant therapeutic effect compared with the recommended level. Consistently, a
significant correlation between lower vitamin D3 levels and clinically depressive symptoms
was observed in three other studies [186–188]. Participants in these studies had similar
age groups (18 years and above) and observed a positive relationship between vitamin
D deficiency and clinically significant depression.
In spite of different outcomes, the
consistent observation throughout these studies is that while monthly supplementation or
a single high dose results in a higher mean of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a daily lower
dose maintains the levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for a longer period [182,183,187].
Additionally, in the studies where participants received a single high dose of vitamin D,
significant improvement in depression symptoms was observed, which further supports
the idea that higher doses of vitamin D above RDA might have a positive therapeutic
effect on depressive symptoms in those with insufficient levels of or deficiencies in vitamin
D [189].

The inconsistency in the results of the studies can be explained by the various sup-
plementation protocols (oral/intravenous; IV) applied and the difference in the forms of
vitamin D dosages and the frequency of administration. In a randomized control trial, pa-
tients with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were given 40,000 IU vitamin D orally per week
for 6 months, in comparison to another randomized control trial where the participants
received 1 single dosage of 150,000 or 300,000 IU of vitamin D via IV injection [185,189].
Both studies assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on SAD symptoms, but their
supplementation protocols (oral/IV) and dosage were different. As a result, higher levels
of improvement in depression symptoms were observed in the randomized control trial,
where participants received 300,000 IU and 150,000 IU of vitamin D via IV [189]. In the
study where the participants received 40,000 IU vitamin D orally per week for 6 months,
no significant improvement in depressive symptoms scores was reported [185].

Moreover, in some studies, no placebo control groups are included, and therefore, it is
difficult to interpret the results. The difference in the length of the studies, from 8 weeks
to 1 year, and variation in the general characteristics of participants (e.g., gender and age
range) are other factors that may also explain the inconsistencies in results. Limitations
reported by these studies may also contribute to the variations in the results observed

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

13 of 29

between the studies. For example, self-reported questionnaires of health behaviors and
depressive symptoms, including participants with no vitamin D deficiency or who were
not at risk of depression or had no symptoms of depression, limited information about
participant adherence, no clinical interview to establish a diagnosis of depression, no
screening for health factors that may affect vitamin D levels, and sample errors (samples
not representing the overall population) are among them [177,182–186,188,189]. Additional
confounders include socio-demographic and socio-economic status, biological and lifestyle
factors associated with depressive symptoms, and vitamin D status.

Dietary interventions have long been known as an effective tool in the prevention
and treatment of depression [184,190–192]. Prior research on the link between diet and
depression has mostly focused on minerals, foods, and food groupings rather than dietary
patterns; however, in studies, nutritional epidemiologists have proposed using a dietary
pattern approach to investigate diet–disease relationships due to the intricate interactions
between nutrients and foods [174,182,193]. Some studies have focused on the link between
dominant eating habits and depression risk, driven by food questionnaires rather than
biochemical testing [194–196]. After adjusting for confounding variables, a substantial
link was identified between depression and serum vitamin D, as well as unhealthy eating
patterns defined as under- or over-eating while having enough healthy foods to consume
each day [175,194]. Vitamin D also functions as the mediator link between a poor diet
pattern and depression [197]. Potential biomarkers, including serum concentrations of
25(OH) D, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg) in serum, are
reported to be significantly related to depression [175,194,197,198]. The correlation between
depression and unhealthy eating is prevalent [194–197]. In a case-control observational
study which included 110 depressed patients and 220 healthy individuals, serum vitamin
D, zinc, magnesium, and total antioxidant capacity were considered potential mediator
variables when evaluating the relationship between dietary patterns and depression [194].
The results showed that healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns were associated with
lower and higher odds of depression, respectively, and there was a reverse relationship
between serum vitamin D concentrations and depression after adjusting for potential
confounders [194]. The study also showed that unhealthy dietary patterns were related to
depression via altering the serum vitamin D concentration [186].

Another study has also shown that depression is inversely correlated with high pro-
tein and low fat intake and positively correlated with vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP)
concentration when interacting with two polymorphisms (rs7041 and rs4588) in the GC
gene, which encodes VDBP [199–203]. The role of the VDBP is to bind and transport
vitamin D and its metabolites; this protein is positively correlated with depression due to
the connecting effect of calcitriol on depression. Calcitriol (1,25[OH]2D3) helps to maintain
both the number of neurons and the structure of neurons through detoxification mecha-
nisms such as inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase synthesis, increasing glutathione
levels, and regulating neurotrophin synthesis, all of which are factors influencing the risk
of depression. The presence of vitamin D receptors, vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP),
and/or the 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme, which converts 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 in the
brain, may explain the effect of calcitriol on depression [195]. In this study, 265 individu-
als (126 males, and 139 females) ages 18–55 were recruited from Tehran, Iran. Using the
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) questionnaire, depression symptoms were
classified as normal, moderate depression, or severe depression [199]. Participants were
allocated into three groups: high-protein/low-fat diet, moderate-protein/moderate-fat
diet, and low-protein/high-fat diet. An analysis of two polymorphisms in the GC gene
was performed. A significant association between depression and diet was observed. The
findings showed that depression was related to both the rs7041 and the rs4588 polymor-
phism [199–202]. Moreover, an interaction between a high-protein/low-fat diet and the
rs7041 polymorphism, which has a greater prevalence in moderate and severe depression,
was observed [199–202].

4.3.2. Vitamin D deficiency and SAD

Dietary vitamin D intake is shown to not only have an inverse correlation with de-
pression severity but also may have similar correlation with SAD [31,204,205]. Low serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) have been associated with a higher likelihood of
SAD [198,199,201,205,206]. There is no strong evidence supporting the therapeutic role of
dietary vitamin D intake in patients diagnosed with SAD, yet vitamin D supplementation
may alleviate symptoms associated with SAD [188,203,207,208]. However, no studies have
found a direct link between dietary vitamin D intake and SAD [203]. Future research is
needed to examine the therapeutic role of dietary vit D intake in patients diagnosed with
SAD and whether this effect is dose dependent. The sun’s exposure is one of the major
determinants of vitamin D status and can be affected by weather, season, and the environ-
ment [177]. This seasonal factor emphasizes the link between vitamin D bioavailability and
the prevalence of SAD. Unlike depression, individuals diagnosed with SAD tend to experi-
ence vegetative symptoms seasonally, particularly during the winter [24,27,29]. This trend
has been highly associated with a reduction in light exposure during the winter [209–213].
The concept that SAD is a result of a lack of light exposure opens a window for the potential
role of vitamin D deficiency as part of the etiology [26,214]. This effect can be explained by
the role of vitamin D in serotonin synthesis. As previously described, cutaneous provitamin
D3 7-dehydrocholesterol can be converted to previtamin D3 under UVB exposure [25,215].
Vitamin D in turn activates tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) which is a neuronal-specific
enzyme responsible for serotonin synthesis in the brain [205,216]. Low levels of serotonin
are linked to depression, which could explain the cause of seasonal depression during the
autumn and winter seasons [217]. However, unlike the clear link between vitamin D status
and depression, the causal relationship between vitamin D status and seasonal depression
is still unclear and open to further discussion.

As previously explained, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can be mainly attributed
to a lack of light exposure, but regulation of the neurotransmitter serotonin and the over-
production of melatonin also play key roles in impacting symptoms of SAD. Consequently,
vitamin D is involved in the pathways of production of melatonin and is believed to play a
key role in serotonin activity, which further links serotonin, melatonin, and light exposure,
but mainly deficiency of vitamin D and SAD [218]. Therefore, it can be speculated that
insufficient levels or a deficiency in vitamin D synthesis owing to a decrease in sunlight
exposure can increase the risk of developing SAD [31].

Gender roles correlate with the prevalence of a potential impact on the etiology of
SAD, according to The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III,
1988–1994) [219–222]. In a Danish study, low levels of vitamin D were strongly correlated
with winter SAD symptoms among adolescent girls and elderly women [205]. A high
prevalence of SAD along with low vitamin D levels among the elder population from
reduced subcutaneous production, intestinal absorption in elderly adults, and limited
sun exposure was reported [219]. Vitamin D status was evaluated amongst post-stroke
depressed participants in a study that identified a clear variation in depression prevalence
during months of decreased sunlight in China (December to May) [223]. In another study
that studied the link between SAD and bipolar syndrome among 442 participants, the
results revealed a 46% prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. There was a significant difference
between the winter and summer months [224,225].

There is a significant correlation between vitamin D and SAD. However, it is unclear
whether vitamin D deficiency is the result or the cause [205,226–228]. Since there is a direct
correlation between vitamin D deficiency and decreased moods/depression symptoms, the
association between vitamin D supplementation and SAD shows potential for treatment
of symptoms [205,226–228] Maintenance of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels during the
predominantly affected seasonal increase in depressive symptoms has been explored [208].

4.3.3. Vitamin D Supplementation and SAD

Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate this association and how vitamin
D supplementation can be used as a treatment for MDD [184,227,229–232]. Results reported
from these studies are inconsistent and the evidence that vitamin D can be used as a
therapeutic tool for depression is limited. In a study by Schild et al. [231], in a double-
blind randomized control trial, female healthcare workers (n = 43) experiencing moderate
SAD symptoms were randomly assigned a supplementation of 70 IU of vitamin D or an
oral placebo over a 12-week winter season trial [231]. Data collected using the SAD and
seasonal pattern effective questionnaires identified changes in mood, weight, appetite, and
sleep, with no significant improvement in SAD symptoms. In comparison, supplementing
vitamin D via intravenous injections have shown significant improvement in the treatment
of SAD in a dose-dependent manner [190,226]. In an RCT, participants (n = 120) with
depressive symptoms were injected with different doses of vitamin D, and significant
improvements in depressive symptoms were observed [190]. In this study, the participants
were allocated into three groups; one group received an injection of 150,000 IU of vitamin
D, the second group received an injection of 300,000 IU of vitamin D, and the last group
(control) received a placebo injection [184]. Those who received 300,000 IU of vitamin
D exhibited higher levels of improvement in depression symptoms in comparison to the
group that was injected with 150,000 IU, while no significant improvement was observed
in the patients who had the placebo injection. Authors suggested that the beneficial effects
of vitamin D in SAD patients are dose dependent. Moreover, it clearly showed that vitamin
D exhibited favorable effects when given in pharmacological doses. It may also explain
why previous studies did not show the therapeutic effects of vitamin D when given in
physiological doses.

Although there is an inverse association between dietary vitamin D and the prevalence
of SAD, the association between supplemental vitamin D and the prevalence of SAD is
unclear. A strong link has been observed between depression symptoms, serum vitamin
D levels, and unhealthy eating habits [205]. Healthier eating patterns are associated with
lower levels of depression symptoms [200,207]. Despite limited investigation to assess
the link between dietary and supplemental vitamin D intake and SAD, the results are
inconclusive, while most of the evidence indicates vitamin D supplementation has little
or no effect [207,231]. Both dietary and supplemental vitamin D have been shown to
effectively increase and maintain vitamin D serum levels [208,233].

4.4. SAD Prevention and Treatments: Light Therapy

Seasonal affective disorder was recognized by the American Psychiatric Associa-
tion in 1987 [234]. The theory states that as the days get shorter during autumn- and
wintertime, especially those of northern latitudes, this can affect plasma melatonin con-
centrations that can ultimately result in symptoms that are collectively known as SAD.
Light therapy can be utilized as a treatment for therapeutic and physiological purposes,
including SAD [209,212,213,232,234,235]. Therapy using concentrated beams of ultraviolet
light was discovered in 1903, and Niels Ryberg Finsen received a Nobel Prize for it [236].
Rosenthal, one of the pioneers in the field, found that applying 2500 lux full spectrum light
in the morning or evening hours for about five to six hours a day reversed the symptoms of
seasonal depression such as fatigue, sadness, overeating, carbohydrate craving, and weight
gain in various studies [26,237–240]. Light therapy was effective after two to four days
of exposure. Authors suggested the suppressive effect of the light on melatonin can be
the underlying mechanism, but further research was needed [237]. Today, light therapy is
considered the first choice when treating SAD [209,234,241,242]. Although many studies
were conducted to improve the outcome of light therapy, whether natural light could also
be utilized as a therapeutic tool was unclear. Wirz–Justice et al. compared a one (1) hour
walk for natural light therapy vs half an hour of light therapy (2800 lux) for one week in
1995 [242]. The outcome showed the artificial light did not help with melatonin or cortisol
levels while natural light did exhibit higher melatonin secretions. Authors from this study

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

16 of 29

suggested that natural light is an alternative to artificial light. In another early study, Parto-
nen et al. [218] measured melatonin and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations before
and after exposure to cool white, fluorescent light (3300 lux) in sixteen patients diagnosed
with SAD and thirteen non–SAD individuals. They were exposed for fifteen (15) minutes or
one (1) hour in the morning. After exposure, the concentrations of melatonin and vitamin
D did not change even though there were reports of fewer depressive symptoms and a
reduction of sleepiness in the SAD group. No notable differences between the SAD group
and the non–SAD group were observed [218]. Light therapy is expected to adjust abnormal
melatonin levels initiated by inadequate sunlight which causes a shift in the timing (phase)
of circadian rhythms [238,241,243,244]. Theoretically, light therapy in the morning has the
most beneficial effect [245] since it prevents a delay in circadian rhythms. The effect of the
timing and the dose of light treatment was the focus of several studies; in a clinical study,
96 participants were exposed to a bright light of 6000 lux for one-and-a-half hours a day for
four weeks [245]. Participants received three distinctive treatments: morning light time,
evening light time, and a morning placebo time. The morning therapy was most beneficial
for complete remission compared with the other treatments. In another study, participants
were exposed to 10,000-lux light therapy for 30 min for four days at different times of
the day: morning, afternoon, and evening [243]. Two additional groups were added to
receive light therapy in the morning for two days and then two days in the evening but
also interchanged those times. The timing of light therapy did not impact the effects of
light therapy [243]. In another study, plasma melatonin concentrations in participants who
suffered from SAD were measured. Light therapy (10,000 lux) was applied for 30 min for
10–14 days [246].

The effect of the timing of light therapy (in the morning after awakening vs. two hours
before bedtime) was also examined. Morning light therapy created a melatonin rhythm
in advance, but evening light therapy only delayed the melatonin rhythm. Although the
depression ratings were alike regardless of the timing, the anti-depressant effect of the light
was significant when applied in the morning only [246]. The discrepancies in these studies
can be explained by the difference in duration, intensity, and the timing utilized in these
studies. In one study, using a full spectrum light therapy room, different applications of
light therapy were tested [247]. Participants (n = 50) diagnosed with seasonal affective
disorder received light therapy for an hour and a half to two hours a day, Monday through
Friday, for over 10 days. SIGH-SAD was used to gauge the SAD baseline throughout the
study. The results showed that individuals had decreased depressive symptoms that lasted
for thirty days [247]. This intervention supported the idea that a light therapy room can
potentially be applied in the treatment of SAD like portable bright light therapy. More
recently, in a randomized controlled trial, a cohort of 62 participants were exposed to
either BROAD light therapy 6 h per day in a room inside their home or exposed to a
10,000 lux SAD light box for 30 min per day [244]. Both methods were similarly effective,
with improved SAD symptoms among the participants. However, the authors concluded
that BROAD light therapy was less confining than standing in front of a light box for
30 min. Wavelength is also a determining factor in light therapy which has been the focus
of more recent studies [213,248–250]. Glickman et al. [248] examined short wavelengths
in blue LED and red LED light therapy with patients diagnosed with SAD. Patients were
exposed to light in the morning for 45 min over three weeks and completed the Structured
Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SIGH-SAD) survey weekly.
The narrow bandwidth blue light at 607 µW/cm2 decreased SIGH-SAD scores more than
red-light therapy considerably. In contrast, in another study, 45 participants who were
suffering from SAD received 30 min of light therapy for five days; 21 participants received
broad wavelength white light and 24 participants received narrow-band blue light; the
study showed no difference between the lights with two wavelengths [250]. A recent
systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs suggested no indication for the effectiveness
of blue-light conditions compared to inactive conditions; low intensity red-light therapy
furthermore showed no differentiation with active conditions, as did high intensity white

light. The effectiveness of blue-light therapy in the treatment of SAD lacks evidence and
more research is needed [213]. In a more recent study, Meesters et al. [250] compared
white-light treatment (n = 21) with blue-light treatment (n = 24) among 45 participants with
exposure to 30 min sessions over five consecutive days. There was no statistical significance
between the two study groups with changes in mood levels, and both white- and blue-light
methods were considered equally effective.

Although the beneficial effect of the light therapy is evident, the underlying mech-
anisms are still unclear. While the wavelength of the light therapy is still debatable,
new propositions for the mechanisms of action, including intrinsically photosensitive
retinal ganglion cell (IpRGC) photoreceptors which play a major role in the regulation of
sleep/alertness and mood, are now opening windows for further studies. A recent study
by Carmel et al. compared different light therapies with specific wavelengths in fat sand
rat models to treat SAD [250]. Bright wide spectrum (3000 lux, wavelength 420–780 nm,
5487 K) and blue (1300 lux, wavelength 420–530 nm) and red light (1300 lux, wavelength
range 600–780 nm) were applied along with various behavioral tests. Compared to red
light, intense wide-spectrum white light and blue light improved depression-like behavior
equally. The authors suggested that blue light is just as effective as wide spectrum bright
light in the treatment of SAD. Moreover, ipRGCs are intertwined with light therapy and
the core of SAD [249].

Individuals with blindness and severe visual impairment (VI) have shown a greater
risk of developing SAD [212]. Individuals diagnosed with VI are also more likely to have
issues with mood, sleep, and circadian rhythm from a deficiency of sunlight [212]. To
investigate the connection between light therapy and photoreceptors, a study examined
how light therapy affects individuals with visual impairment (VI) and blindness who
experience seasonal affective disorder [212]. Participants with blindness and VI experienced
improved mood and sleep after applying six weeks of light therapy for thirty (30) minutes
in the morning [212]. In another study, using bright light therapy with SAD individuals
through their ear canal via utilizing the photoreceptors was examined [251]. Although
it was a small cohort (n = 13), 76.9% of the patients obtained full remission on their
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) [251]. Further research is needed to reveal
the mechanisms by which photoreceptors influence the outcome of light therapy and
ultimately reduce the SAD symptoms. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), a mitochondrial
enzyme, is a key regulator of serotonin, emotion, sleep, and appetite. Recent studies
showed elevated MAO-A levels in individuals with non-seasonal major depression [252].
In one study, MAO-A levels in 24 SAD and 27 healthy individuals were examined [211].
The MAO-A levels were analyzed through a positron emission tomography (PET) scan
that was completed before treatment in the fall/winter, after treatment, and again in the
spring/summer. Bright light therapy (BLT) of 10,000 lux was applied for 30 min in the
morning over a three-week span. Similarly, healthy individuals were exposed to light
therapy with an intensity of either 10,000 or 400 lux. MAO-A levels in the healthy patients
had declined before treatment, and again in spring/summer. There was a reduction in the
MAO-A levels in response to the BLT in the SAD patients; however, the MAO-A levels in
the SAD patients were not affected by seasonal change. The healthy individuals showed
no difference from either light therapy. The authors concluded that the intensity of light
therapy is a determining factor in the results of the BLT [211]. Although the mechanisms
by which light therapy affects SAD patients are still unclear, the favorable effects of light
therapy on depression have been linked to interleukin (IL-6), which is a pro-inflammatory
cytokine that has been studied extensively [253–257]. Other pro-inflammatory cytokines
include sIL-6R, and 2IL-2R may also play a role in SAD. One study examined whether light
therapy has an immunomodulatory effect on SAD patients and examined plasma levels of
IL-6, sIL-6, and sIL-2R [210]. The study included 15 SAD patients and 15 healthy individuals.
Light therapy was applied with cool white, fluorescent light at 10,000 lux for 30 min early
in the morning for two weeks. Plasma levels for immune inflammatory markers were
evaluated before and after treatment in the fall/winter season and in March with both

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

18 of 29

groups. The immune inflammatory markers showed an increase in IL-6, IL-6 × sIL-6R, and
sIL-2R during the fall/winter season in SAD patients; nonetheless, the outcome of light
therapy for two weeks had no effect on plasma levels, while nine of the SAD patients did
benefit from light therapy [210]. Further study is needed on other immune inflammatory
markers associated with patients with SAD.

The innovation of light therapy has been one of the greatest achievements in the treat-
ment of SAD patients. The mechanisms by which light therapy reduces SAD symptoms
received considerable study. Suppression of melatonin due to insufficient exposure to
sunlight was the origin of the concept of light therapy as a therapeutic approach [245].
Afterward, other mechanisms including mitochondrial enzymes, photoreceptor pathways,
and immune inflammatory markers were proposed [210–212,249,251]. Although the fa-
vorable effect of light therapy is well documented, the timing, dose, wavelengths, and
different applications of light therapy for the treatment of SAD are still open for further
investigation [213,238,243,246–248,250].

5. Summary

Depression is a debilitating mental disorder, ranked within the top three causes of
burden of disease worldwide and expected to increase by 2030 [4,8]. Research in the field
of nutritional psychiatry has faced significant challenges in comparing studies due to
the diverse range of study designs employed by researchers. These variations include
differences in intervention regimens, participant demographics, measured parameters, and
study designs, making it difficult to draw direct comparisons. B vitamins, particularly B1
(thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folate),
and B12 (cobalamin), play crucial roles in neurological function and mood regulation. Defi-
ciencies in these vitamins have been linked to an increased risk and incidence of depression.
However, research on the therapeutic effects of dietary B vitamin intake on depression
has been limited, with most studies focusing on vitamin supplementation. Studies on
individual B vitamins such as thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate have shown promising
results in improving depressive symptoms when supplemented. Thiamin deficiency has
been associated with mood disorders, and supplementation has shown improvements
in depressive symptoms. Riboflavin intake has been inversely associated with depres-
sion, while niacin supplementation has improved symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and
depression. Folate deficiency has been linked to increased vulnerability to depression, and
supplementation has shown antidepressant-like effects.

Vitamin C, an essential antioxidant, is also implicated in mood regulation. Research
suggests that vitamin C deficiency may lead to heightened depressive symptoms and
that supplementation can alleviate these symptoms. However, the exact mechanisms
linking vitamin C deficiency to depression are not fully understood. Seasonal Affective
Disorder (SAD), categorized as a MDD with seasonal patterns, manifests through both
typical depressive symptoms and atypical vegetative symptoms. Extensive research has
explored the link between vitamin D status and SAD, suggesting that insufficient sunlight
exposure during autumn and winter may contribute to its onset. Individuals with vitamin
D deficiency are reportedly 3.5 times more prone to developing depression. Factors influ-
encing vitamin D levels include skin pigmentation (melanin), sunscreen usage, atmospheric
conditions such as cloud cover, seasonal variations, and individual characteristics such as
age, obesity, gastrointestinal disorders, dietary habits, supplement intake, and medication
interactions. Recent studies investigating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on
treating SAD have yielded inconsistent and diverse results due to variations in experimen-
tal methodologies. While some research has indicated a positive correlation between light
therapy, photoreceptor activity, and SAD, further investigation is warranted to validate
these findings across different settings. Current research endeavors focus on exploring
various aspects of light therapy, including wavelengths, dosage, and timing, to offer viable
alternatives for managing SAD effectively. Additionally, there remains a need for deeper
exploration into the underlying mechanisms of SAD, with potential avenues including

Nutrients 2024, 16, 1902

the role of photoreceptors, mitochondrial enzymes, and immune inflammatory markers,
warranting future investigation. In conclusion, nutritional approaches, including dietary
and supplemental vitamins, offer promising avenues as preventative and therapeutic tools.
B vitamins, particularly thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate, show potential in improv-
ing depressive symptoms. Vitamin C deficiency may exacerbate depressive symptoms,
while research on vitamin D suggests a link between sunlight exposure, deficiency, and
SAD. However, inconsistencies in study methodologies and a limited understanding of
underlying mechanisms necessitates further investigation. Future research should focus
on elucidating mechanisms of action and refining intervention strategies to effectively
utilize these vitamins in mood disorder management, considering individual variability in
nutrient status and dietary habits.

6. Future Directions

Research on the preventative and therapeutic impacts of dietary B vitamin intake on
depression remains relatively restricted, primarily centered on vitamin supplementation.
However, there is a critical need for more comprehensive investigations into the influence
of dietary vitamin B intake on depression at a mechanistic level and in a dose-dependent
manner. Understanding the complex mechanisms through which these vitamins interact
with neural processes could provide valuable insights into their efficacy in managing
depressive symptoms. Furthermore, exploring the role of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics
in modulating the effects of vitamins on depression represents a promising field that
warrants significant attention. Unraveling how individual genetic variations influence an
individual’s response to dietary interventions with B vitamins could help to personalize
nutritional strategies for combating depression. This interdisciplinary approach holds
promise for elucidating the complex interplay between genetics, nutrition, and mental
health outcomes. Overall, while there is evidence supporting the role of B vitamins and
vitamins C and D in the prevention and treatment of depression, further research is needed
to elucidate their mechanisms of action and to determine optimal intervention strategies.
Additionally, considering individual variations in baseline nutrient status and dietary habits
is crucial when evaluating the therapeutic potential of these vitamins in mood disorders.
