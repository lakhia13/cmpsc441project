Abstract

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 5% of children and 
adolescents globally and is associated with negative life outcomes and socioeconomic costs. 
First-generation ADHD treatments were predominantly pharmacological; however, increased 
understanding of biological, psychological, and environmental factors contributing to ADHD 
has expanded non-pharmacological treatment possibilities. This Review provides an updated 
evaluation of the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological treatments for paediatric ADHD, 
discussing the quality and level of evidence for nine intervention categories. Unlike medication, 
no non-pharmacological treatments showed a consistent strong effect on ADHD symptoms. When 
considering broad outcomes (eg, impairment, caregiver stress, and behavioural improvement), 
multicomponent (cognitive) behaviour therapy joined medication as a primary ADHD treatment. 
With respect to secondary treatments, polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a consistent modest 
effect on ADHD symptoms when taken for at least 3 months. Additionally, mindfulness and 
multinutrient supplementation with four or more ingredients showed modest efficacy on non-
symptom outcomes. All other non-pharmacological treatments were safe; clinicians might tolerate 
their use but should educate families of childrenand adolescents with ADHD on the disadvantages, 
including costs, burden to the service user, absence of proven efficacy relative to other treatments, 
and delay of proven treatment.

Introduction

With a global prevalence of approximately 5%, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by inattention, overactivity, and 
impulsivity.1 Childhood ADHD predicts the development of future mental disorders and 
substantial impairments in educational, vocational, financial, and interpersonal and relational 
domains.2–5 ADHD reduces life expectancy, increases care duties for families, undermines 
work productivity, elevates risk for crime, and is costly to the public (annual cost of illness 
for adult ADHD is more than $8000 per person).6–9 ADHD increases risk for unemployment 
and public assistance, with ADHD versus non-ADHD disparities exceeding racial and 
gender disparities.10 Therefore, remediation of paediatric ADHD is a promising avenue 
to prevent negative outcomes in adulthood and socioeconomic costs. It should be noted that 
symptoms typically recur when treatment discontinues.11 Therefore, continued research that 
expands and improves treatment options is necessary.

The heterogeneous contributors of ADHD are a function of biological and environmental 
factors, so treatments must be individualised and target both mechanisms (figure 1).12 For 
example, ADHD is highly heritable, polygenic, and linked to neurotransmitter deficiencies 
(with emerging research supporting additional biological mechanisms such as inflammation, 
nutrient deficiencies, infections, and gut dysbiosis).13–17 However, environmental (eg, 
parenting style, classroom characteristics, toxins, and nutrition) and psychological (eg, self-
management strategies, beliefs, and thinking styles) factors also influence ADHD severity, 
and are reasonable intervention targets.18–21

Personalised medicine matches people to treatments based on individual risk profiles (figure 
1). Increased recognition of factors contributing to ADHD expands treatment possibilities. 
First-generation ADHD-treatments were largely pharmacological and targeted biological 
mechanisms, including methylphendiate, which was initially discovered by accident in 
an attempt to alleviate paediatric headaches.22 CNS stimulants, and, more recently, non-
stimulants directly remediate neurophysiological dysfunction.23 However, medications 
do not target non-biological contributors that exacerbate biological risks. Additionally, 
some participants and caregivers have negative perceptions toward medications, and 
some participants cannot tolerate the side-effects or have insufficient benefits from the 
medications.24,25 Thus, non-pharmacological treatments have an important potential role 
in ADHD treatment. However, as availability of these treatments increases, questions arise 
about which are safe and efficacious, and under what circumstances they should be applied.

Herein, we summarise the extant non-pharmacological treatment literature for paediatric 
ADHD. We emphasise research using gold standard designs (ie, parallel-group randomised 
controlled trials [RCTs] and meta-analyses of RCTs) and outcomes that are meaningful 
to people with ADHD and their families.26,27 We consider benefits and disadvantages 
of available treatments and definitions of efficacy, acknowledging that ADHD symptom 
reduction is only part of the clinical objective.28,29 Since ADHD is chronic, with symptoms 
or impairments usually persisting into adulthood, practical symptom management and 
reduction of impairments that people with ADHD care about is typically the goal.

Methodological considerations

There is often confusion about the value of non-pharmacological ADHD treatments 
owing to a complex literature with several inevitable and unfortunate methodological 
complications.30 First, unlike ingested treatments, many non-ingested treatments cannot be 
fully blinded (eg, parent training, exercise, and body therapies). Sometimes face-valid shams 
are developed to promote blinding, but even these can have questionable differentiation 
from active treatment or invite confounds (eg, parents sharing strategies in sham behaviour 
therapy and non-specific cognitive training indirectly affecting targets). Second, sometimes 
non-pharmacological studies use cognitive tasks as a primary outcome. These analogue 
paradigms do not correlate with day-to-day functioning, cannot account for temporal 
or situational symptom variability, and do not usually translate into outcomes that are 
meaningful to children with ADHD and their families.31 Thus, we distinguish findings based 
on gold standard ADHD symptom measures (ie, parent and teacher reports of behaviour 
over extended periods) from cognitive task performance.

One particularly problematic confounder is that parents and teachers are sometimes involved 
or invested in non-pharmacological treatment, leading to possible measurement biases. This 
bias creates a conundrum, because parent and teacher ratings are gold standard measures of 
outcome in trials of children and adolescents with ADHD; however, these raters also are not 
fully blinded to treatment. Proposed solutions are suboptimal. Briefly sampled observations 
of child behaviour might not represent typical behaviour—particularly when a child knows 
they are being observed. Masked raters of clinical improvement often receive all information 
from an unblinded source (ie, parents, teachers, or the person with ADHD). Outcome

measurement in a setting outside the intervention’s scope (eg, teacher ratings measuring 
response to parent training) sets a stringent criterion for success (ie, generalisation to 
a secondary setting). We wonder whether these thoughtful attempts at blinding impose 
greater validity threats than possible pro-treatment biases associated with unblinded but gold 
standard raters.

Finally, we note an important red herring in this literature—large within-subjects treatment 
effects in the absence of a control group. ADHD symptoms in untreated control groups 
typically decline over the course of a study, often by a large effect size.32,33 This 
effect might be due to regression to the mean, maturation, placebo effects, or baseline 
symptom exaggeration by stakeholders trying to ensure study acceptance. Even randomised 
crossovers can have unavoidable carryover effects for non-pharmacological treatments when 
therapeutic effects build over time, have delayed onset, or show maintenance (eg, behaviour 
therapy, cognitive training, and polyunsaturated fatty acids). Because crossovers can be 
challenging to interpret in these scenarios, when stronger designs were available, we avoided 
reviewing crossover studies.

Considering these important methodological issues, we avoided studies with design 
limitations that threatened our conclusions’ validity (appendix pp 4–13). We did not 
rate each study’s risk of bias or adequacy of power but instead provide narrative 
summaries of overall evidence quality34 and extracted detailed study design data in the 
appendix (pp 15–16, 27–119). When possible, we review mechanisms of action, long-term 
efficacy, safety, and cost. We discuss non-blinded studies but comment on the differences 
between valid blinded and non-blinded ratings when appropriate. We review evidence for 
non-pharmacological interventions (see definitions in panel 1) as stand-alone treatment 
and adjunct to other interventions, and draw initial inferences about combinations of 
non-pharmacological (and pharmacological) ADHD treatments—probably the future of 
personalised medicine.28

Behaviour therapy: recommend as a primary treatment

Behaviour therapy (also called cognitive-behavioural therapy) has a large literature with 
many high quality RCTs, albeit without full blinding (appendix pp 15–16, 27–43). 
Behaviour therapy has a complex literature; attempts to summarise it have produced 
widely divergent conclusions about efficacy.23,35,36 Importantly, behaviour therapy has 
very high intervention heterogeneity—treatments are overwhelmingly multicomponent 
(often with three or more components; figure 2; appendix pp 27–43). Therefore, we 
could not reasonably organise existing packages into orthogonal subcategories, as others 
have attempted. Operant reinforcement was present in almost all behaviour therapy 
packages, as was parent training. Youth skills components are present in about half 
of all packages and cover heterogeneous topics such as social skills, problem-solving, 
organisation strategies, and metacognitive skills. A smaller minority of packages include 
teacher-directed intervention components or motivational interviewing, an engagement 
strategy with gaining popularity to overcome known barriers to behaviour therapy.37 We 
note diversity in treatment intensity, duration, setting, providers, and participant types. 
Developmentally, youth-directed cognitive components and engagement strategies are

almost always integrated into adolescent treatments, whereas childhood behaviour therapy 
models sometimes solely engage a parent or teacher to deliver operant reinforcement. 
Although no clear patterns of dose–response or component–response emerged in our 
analysis of the literature, divergent conclusions about behaviour therapy efficacy might 
be a function of intervention heterogeneity and moderating factors. Unfortunately, this 
variability offers opportunities to cull, organise, and amalgamate findings to confirm 
reviewer expectations. Providers are often left confused about whether to recommend 
behaviour therapy.

The issue of blinding is at the forefront of discussions about the efficacy of behaviour 
therapy.23,35 It is impossible to fully blind behaviour therapy participants and maintain a 
well designed study. Thus, nearly all conclusions about behaviour therapy’s efficacy hinge 
on an inference that informant biases cannot possibly be the sole driver of large and robust 
behaviour therapy effects in scores of well designed RCTs. However, some experts dispute 
this inference.

Meta-analyses of RCTs find small to medium effects of behaviour therapy on ADHD 
symptoms, small effects on academic outcomes, small to medium effects on parenting, and 
medium to large effects on organisation skills (appendix pp 120–43). However, summary 
statistics mask this literature’s heterogeneity, which has important implications for treatment 
selection. Some behaviour therapy packages are more effective for some people with 
ADHD than others, and varying treatment doses might be needed to achieve efficacy.38,39 
For example, courses of behaviour therapy packages with evidence of efficacy ranged 
from 2 h to hundreds of hours—as did courses of therapies without efficacy (appendix 
pp 27–43, 120–43). Positive response to various behaviour therapies is associated with 
parental engagement in treatment and family advantages (appendix pp 120–43). However, 
these moderators might not be relevant for youth-directed treatments. Positive response 
also is associated with female sex, concomitant medication, older age, ADHD-inattentive 
presentation, higher anxiety levels, and therapist quality (appendix pp 120–43). However, 
these moderators are treatment-specific and cannot be generalised to behaviour therapy 
broadly. Integrative and big data analyses are greatly needed to draw conclusions on which 
behaviour therapies work for whom and why. Several teams have made advancements in 
this area, but work is just beginning.40,41 Although sound treatment matching data is not yet 
available, modular behaviour therapies might allow clinicians to individualise components 
to client needs based on clinical judgment. Engagement-focused approaches that integrate 
parent and youth preferences in treatment are also emerging. These tailored, patient-centred 
treatments outperform standard behaviour therapies in research trials.41

Unlike medication trials, a minority of behaviour therapy RCTs test basic efficacy using 
gold standard ADHD symptom measures. Instead, most focus on at least one broader, but 
meaningful, outcome for people with ADHD (eg, impairment, problem-behaviour reduction, 
or parenting).26 With respect to ADHD symptoms, about half of behaviour therapy packages 
show a significant effect in RCTs. However, most studies of behaviour therapy packages find 
between-group reductions in impairment (eg, academic and social) or broader mechanisms 
such as youth strategy application (eg, homework skills and organisation), parent or teacher-
behavioural changes (eg, positivity and using consequences), and youth psychological

variables (eg, self-efficacy and social knowledge). Very few studies examine cognitive 
task performance as a mechanism—and almost none find an effect of behaviour therapy. 
These findings support theoretical assumptions that behaviour therapy probably indirectly 
improves ADHD symptoms and impairments by intervening at youth skills, environmental, 
and psychological levels (figure 1). In contrast to medication, evidence does not support 
direct effect of behaviour therapy on neurocognition. Regarding long-term efficacy, almost 
all studies examining maintenance of therapeutic effects find effects 6–12 months post-
treatment (appendix pp 120–43). The Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA) found 
almost no efficacy of childhood-delivered behaviour therapy at 3-year through 16-year 
follow-up.11,42,43 However, 3 years post-treatment, one large RCT found sustained efficacy 
of adolescent-delivered behaviour therapy and moderation by age.44 Thus, behaviour therapy 
maintenance might increase with a child’s age.

Behaviour therapy is regarded as safe; thus, safety assessments are rarely included in 
behaviour therapy RCTs. One benefit of behaviour therapy, compared with medication, 
is that it does not suppress growth and weight.45 Some individuals claim, anecdotally, that 
behaviour therapy leads to adverse behavioural events;46 however the opposite appears to 
be true (appendix pp 120–43), although more research is needed. There is no evidence for 
behaviour therapy-related decompensation, and only a handful of studies did not find any 
therapeutic effects for behaviour therapy (appendix pp 120–43), although publication biases 
might under-represent null effects.

Bigger questions about behaviour therapy’s value relate to opportunity cost (ie, whether 
to forego pharmacotherapy for behaviour therapy). In studies comparing behaviour therapy 
with medication, most evidence suggests that medication and behaviour therapy similarly 
reduce ADHD symptoms. As an exception, the MTA showed short-term advantage 
of stimulants for ADHD symptoms and impairments (appendix pp 120–43). Thus, if 
participants show a strong preference for behaviour therapy over medication, it seems 
reasonable to start with behaviour therapy and add medication as needed—particularly 
given evidence that beginning with behaviour therapy can enhance combined treatment 
or allow for lower medication doses.28,47,48 However, behaviour therapy is more costly 
and burdensome to administer than medication, particularly in community settings, and it 
might not be universally available.49 Medication might be considered first when a child or 
adolescent with ADHD needs immediate symptom reduction or when no adult (parent or 
teacher) is well positioned to consistently oversee a behaviour therapy programme. About 
two-thirds of RCTs examining the effect of adding behaviour therapy to medication found 
behaviour therapy to incrementally benefit functioning (appendix pp 120–43). Combined 
treatment produced superior gains in child symptoms (mood, disruptive behaviour, and time 
management) and parenting, and might minimise opportunity costs while capitalising on 
behaviour therapy’s advantages (combined treatment is more cost effective than behaviour 
therapy alone).29 Although there is inconsistent evidence regarding behaviour therapy’s 
effect on ADHD symptoms, it has a consistent and strong effect on a broader range 
of meaningful outcomes for children and adolescents with ADHD. Therefore, behaviour 
therapy can be recommended as a primary treatment for paediatric ADHD, but providers 
should always inform families about its relative disadvantages and benefits compared with

medication. Behaviour therapy requires consistent participant or parent effort and might not 
have a direct effect on ADHD symptoms, but typically evidences long-term maintenance.

Cognitive training: tolerate use but educate on limitations

Cognitive training (ie, digital intervention) is designed to remediate neurocognitive 
deficits presumed to underlie ADHD. Explosive growth in cognitive training was recently 
punctuated by EndeavorRx,50 a prescription cognitive training for ADHD, receiving 
clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Conformité 
Européenne (CE) mark. Similar to behaviour therapy, cognitive training has a large, robust 
literature with many RCTs and multiple meta-analyses (appendix pp 44–60). Cognitive 
training shows high heterogeneity in targeted domains (eg, working memory, sustained 
attention, and inhibitory control) and dosing features. Cognitive training can be adequately 
blinded; when considering only blinded trials, meta-analyses suggest no effect of cognitive 
training on ADHD symptoms (appendix pp 144–51). Meta-analyses permitting unblinded 
studies report variable cognitive training effects for inattention (range: 0· 03–0·64) and no 
hyperactivity or impulsivity effects. Thus, cognitive training effects appear to result from 
nonspecific effects rather than cognitive exercises.

Most RCTs of cognitive training, including EndeavorRx, do not show effects on gold 
standard ADHD symptom measures, and those that do are primarily unblinded or small per-
protocol studies that did not withstand replication using stronger designs. Very few studies 
have shown any effect on impairment. By contrast, about half of cognitive training trials 
show improvement on cognitive measures—mostly analogue tasks. When using informant 
ratings of cognition, effects were less consistent—highlighting low correlations between 
analogue task and daily life performance (appendix pp 144–51).

Overall, when weighing evidence from adequately blinded studies, research indicates no 
clear effect of cognitive training on meaningful participant outcomes (appendix pp 144–51). 
Additional work should clarify why improvements on cognitive tasks do not transfer to 
ADHD symptoms or daily life performance in adequately blinded trials. There is also little 
information on the safety of repeated cognitive training administration (eg, screen exposure 
and vision). Cognitive training might be perceived as highly palatable—particularly when 
described as a game requiring minimal parental involvement. However, with high costs 
and low efficacy, we are unable to recommend cognitive training for paediatric ADHD. 
Providers can tolerate cognitive training but should educate families on its cost and absence 
of efficacy on meaningful participant outcomes.

Neurofeedback: tolerate use but educate on limitations

Neurofeedback also has a robust literature and a tendency for its RCTs to examine 
ADHD symptoms as a primary outcome. Similar to behaviour therapy and cognitive 
training, intervention heterogeneity within neurofeedback is high. Neurofeedback can be 
adequately blinded using shams. Meta-analyses (permitting unblinded trials) conclude 
that neurofeedback has short-term efficacy on ADHD symptom ratings (appendix pp 
152–64). However, all RCTs comparing neurofeedback with sham universally show no

effects—including the large, multisite iCan study.51 Thus, considering very consistent 
recent data (2011–21) from sham control RCTs, it becomes clear that previously reported 
ADHD symptom effects resulted from nonspecific effects rather than brain wave training. 
Head-to-head comparison of different neurofeedback protocols also does not detect group 
differences (appendix pp 152–64). In mostly unblinded trials, there are inconsistent effects 
when comparing neurofeedback with behaviour therapy, cognitive training, medication, 
and biofeedback. As an adjunctive treatment, findings mirror stand-alone evaluations (only 
one, unblinded, study finds incremental benefit of neurofeedback to medication). Despite a 
absence of efficacy, neurofeedback is safe.

One benefit of neurofeedback might be that lower doses of medication are sufficient 
when combining medication and neurofeedback.51 However, almost no studies examine 
effect on impairment, and those that do find nearly no effects. Among six blinded 
sham comparison RCTs, there is mixed evidence for a direct effect of neurofeedback on 
cognitive tasks. Considering an absence of specific efficacy, potential costs, and participant 
burden associated with neurofeedback, this treatment should not be recommended. Because 
neurofeedback appears to be safe, providers can tolerate its use but should educate 
participants about its absence of specific efficacy. The same time and effort dedicated to 
more effective treatments might yield similar results at less expense or better results at the 
same expense.

Body therapies: tolerate use but educate on limitations

Body therapies are highly heterogeneous, and 11 RCTs have studied a very broad range of 
interventions, including massage, acupressure, acupuncture, auricular therapy, and vestibular 
stimulation. Blinding is impossible for some body therapies (eg, massage), but possible for 
others (eg, auricular therapy) with well designed sham. Meta-analyses are scarce (appendix 
pp 165–70). Among the seven RCTs examining ADHD symptoms (appendix pp 165–70), 
results are mixed—specifically for acupuncture and auricular therapy. Functional outcomes 
are rarely evaluated in this literature and results remain inconclusive (appendix pp 165–70). 
Most commonly, cognitive task performance is the primary outcome in body therapy RCTs, 
also with mixed results. There have been some favourable effects for body therapy using 
categorical recovery classifications (consistent with the Chinese classification of mental 
disorders52). However, given the inconsistent findings, high intervention heterogeneity, and 
variable blinding, the body therapy literature remains underdeveloped.

Thus, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about body therapies’ efficacy; more 
studies with rigorous designs are needed. Most body therapies can be tolerated with minor or 
rare side-effects (appendix pp 165–70). There appear to be no RCTs for some body therapies 
commonly marketed for ADHD (eg, chiropractic therapy). Body therapies can be costly 
and often require multiple sessions over weeks or months, raising questions of opportunity 
cost (eg, attending body therapy instead of more efficacious treatments). Some participants 
and their families might prefer body therapy for cultural reasons—eg, improvement in inner 
balance of Yin–Yang, the disruption of which is thought to contribute to ADHD within 
the Chinese Traditional Medicine (appendix p 14) framework. Some body therapies are 
appealing because they are readily available in communities (eg, massage and acupuncture),

of children with ADHD about the relative advantages and disadvantages of body therapies, 
but also acknowledge when a participant’s cultural background might support its use.

Supplementation: recommend as secondary multinutrients with four or 

more ingredients and polyunsaturated fatty acids; tolerate use but educate 

about limitations

There is a large number of RCTs examining nutrient or melatonin supplementation, with 
very high heterogeneity within the broad supplement category. Interventions included 
single supplements (amino acids, herbs, minerals, vitamin D, polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
and phosphatidylserine), melatonin, and combinations of nutrients. Therefore, we discuss 
interventions within several subcategories (appendix pp 20–26) and note variability 
even within these (eg, number of ingredients, type, and dose). As ingested treatments, 
supplements can be successfully blinded; however, not all studies have done so. A robust 
literature base exists for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with fewer studies for most 
other single nutrients, multinutrients, and vitamin D. Most supplementation RCTs use 
small samples—only PUFAs have more than one large RCT (ie, N>100; appendix pp 
75–102). Similar to neurofeedback, most supplement studies use a gold standard ADHD 
outcome; however, across subcategories, there was little consistent evidence for an effect 
of supplements on ADHD outcomes. When results were inconsistent, they often varied by 
reporter (eg, clinician, parent, and teacher).

Although not confirmed, potential benefits of supplementation include minimal side-effects, 
mitigating medication side-effects (eg, sleep disturbance and height suppression), treating 
underlying nutrient and melatonin deficiencies, and providing mechanistic support (eg, 
increased cerebral blood flow, cell membrane fluidity, antioxidant or anti-inflammatory 
properties, cellular support, and microbiome changes). Pre-treatment vitamin and mineral 
concentrations did not typically moderate response, suggesting that testing concentrations 
might not be useful. For completeness, our extended discussion of supplement subcategories 
(appendix pp 20–26) considers results from open-label intervention trials for categories 
with few or no RCTs. Overall, multinutrients combining four or more ingredients (vitamins 
plus minerals) and PUFAs were the only supplements with replicated effects on clinically 
meaningful outcomes, with multinutrients affecting impairment levels and PUFAs affecting 
ADHD symptoms. Although PUFAs have shown a consistent, small effect on ADHD 
symptoms, this effect might only emerge when taken for at least 3 months in sufficient 
doses, typically >1 g. There is also evidence to suggest that PUFAs might lower the optimal 
stimulant dose. Because the effects of multinutrients combining four or more ingredients 
(vitamins plus minerals) and PUFAs were more modest than primary treatments (eg, 
medication and behaviour therapy), we recommend them as secondary treatments (appendix 
pp 203–06). All other supplements have insufficient or inconsistent evidence of efficacy 
(appendix pp 171–202). These other supplements can be tolerated, but clinicians should 
educate families of children with ADHD on possible downsides, including insufficient 
efficacy, cost, burden of daily pill consumption, possible interaction with medication, and 
opportunity costs of forgoing primary treatments.

Dietary interventions: tolerate use but educate on limitations

Dietary interventions for ADHD have included elimination of artificial food colours, 
additives, and salicylates (ie, Feingold–Kaiser Permanente diet); removal of antigenic 
foods (ie, Elimination–Oligoantigenic diet); and following a healthy dietary pattern (eg, 
Mediterranean diet). Overall, only a handful of RCTs examined elimination diets or 
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) protocol (appendix pp 207–10). 
There are no blinded RCTs of dietary interventions, as face-valid sham diets can be 
challenging to employ. Nonetheless, elimination diets have shown evidence of improving 
ADHD symptoms compared with healthy eating advice, and the DASH diet reduces 
ADHD symptoms compared with a control diet. Dietary interventions for ADHD are safe; 
however, concerns about inadequate nutrition and participant burden exist for elimination 
diet interventions.

Overall, the nascent literature on dietary interventions requires more rigorous testing before 
this category of intervention can be recommended. Consulting uncontrolled and crossover 
studies (appendix pp 20–26), there are several interventions that might be worthy of further 
testing. For example, crossover data suggests that elimination of artificial food colours 
might hold promise but requires examination with more rigorous study designs (appendix 
pp 207–10). At this time, dietary interventions should not be recommended, but they can be 
tolerated. Providers can emphasise that there are almost no well designed RCTs on dietary 
interventions and that participant burden might be high.

Mindfulness-based interventions: recommend as secondary

There is a moderate research base on mindfulness-based interventions with nine RCTs, 
most of which focus on the reduction of ADHD symptoms or other clinically meaningful 
outcomes. Intervention heterogeneity is high, particularly due to differences in treatment 
recipients (ie, only children, only caregivers, or both) and dosing (one to 24 sessions). 
Similar to behaviour therapy, mindfulness-based interventions cannot be blinded without 
introducing additional validity threats. Thus, possible informant biases cannot be ruled out. 
Two meta-analyses of mindfulness-based interventions reported medium effect sizes for 
inattention and small effect sizes for hyperactivity and impulsivity (appendix pp 211–26). 
Parent-related improvements were the most consistent positive outcome across mindfulness-
based intervention trials (eg, parenting stress, mindfulness, and strategy use) with effects 
favouring mindfulness-based interventions in nearly all examinations (appendix pp 211–26). 
Overall, all RCTs of mindfulness-based interventions compared with no treatment show 
evidence of relative ADHD symptom reduction at post-treatment or 6-month follow-up—
although some effects were inconsistent within studies. Compared with behaviour therapy, 
mindfulness-based interventions do not show superiority for ADHD symptoms but do for 
child emotion regulation. Similarly, psychoeducation and mindfulness-based interventions 
show similar effects on ADHD symptoms, but mindfulness-based interventions show 
superiority on cognitive tasks. Mindfulness-based interventions have offered a significant 
incremental effect on ADHD symptoms when combined with non-violent resistance parent 
training (appendix pp 211–26).

Overall, more evidence is needed to draw conclusions about the effect of mindfulness-
based interventions on ADHD outcomes, but this literature is quickly growing and might 
stabilise soon. Similar to multinutrients with four or more ingredients, there is consistent
—although modest—evidence that mindfulness-based interventions affect other clinically 
meaningful outcomes, particularly parenting stress and behaviour. Future research should 
examine the safety of mindfulness-based interventions for ADHD (rarely reported).53 
Because mindfulness-based interventions show modest but consistent evidence for broad 
outcomes such as parental stress, parenting style, and youth emotional functioning, they 
can be recommended as a secondary treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD 
(appendix pp 211–26).54–59 However, practitioners should consider and provide information 
about the advantages of primary treatments (ie, medication and behaviour therapy) before 
recommending mindfulness-based interventions, and they should explain the opportunity 
costs of forgoing primary treatments.

Physical activity: recommend generally, but not as ADHD treatment

Of the 11 RCTs on physical activity for ADHD, most had very small sample sizes and 
very few considered treatment effect on ADHD symptoms or other clinically meaningful 
outcomes (appendix pp 111–13). Although there are three meta-analyses reporting small 
to medium effects of physical activity on ADHD symptoms (appendix pp 227–29), the 
methodologies of these reports have meaningful limitations. Two of the meta-analyses 
primarily relied on cognitive tasks as their measure of ADHD symptoms. One generously 
defined physical activity to include any intervention with movement, thereby including 
treatments whose primary components are categorised elsewhere (ie, hippotherapy, cognitive 
training, and behaviour therapy). One challenge in this literature is disentangling immediate 
cognitive effects of recent exercise from lasting effects of repeated exercise on day-to-day 
ADHD symptoms. It is also impossible to blind participants (and their parents and teachers) 
to whether exercise occurred. Thus, additional, better designed trials with a focus on 
meaningful participant outcomes are needed to confirm the efficacy of physical activity.

Interventions include sports, aerobic activity, and martial arts. Only one RCT examined 
physical activity’s effect on ADHD symptoms and found no effect (appendix pp 227–29). 
Most RCTs investigate the effect of physical activity on task-based cognitive measures. 
Results have been mixed and might depend on the amount of time between the exercise 
session and cognitive task administration. Reducing inflammation is a novel hypothesised 
mechanism through which exercise might improve ADHD symptoms; one study found 
mixed results of physical activity on biomarkers of body composition and inflammation 
(appendix pp 227–29).

Physical activity appears to be inferior to medication for ADHD symptoms. Compared 
with medication plus behavioural skills class, medication plus physical activity has mixed 
effects on outcomes. There is also mixed evidence for whether physical activity emphasising 
self-control (eg, martial arts) is superior to standard physical activity (with cognitive tasks 
as outcomes). Although there are insufficient scientific data to support physical activity as 
an ADHD intervention, there are broad health benefits to exercise, minimal financial costs, 
and possible acute effects on cognition. Therefore, physical activity can be generically

treatment.

Brain stimulation: tolerate use but educate on limitations

Brain stimulation is an emerging treatment for ADHD; similar to the EndeavorRx CT, FDA 
clearance and the European CE mark have been granted to the Monarch trigeminal nerve 
stimulation (TNS) device for the treatment of ADHD in children. The literature on brain 
stimulation for ADHD is very small and highly heterogeneous (appendix pp 114–19). In 
addition to TNS, the literature on brain stimulation includes RCTs of repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS), and 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Duration of tested treatments ranges from 
one to 30 sessions. Brain stimulation interventions can be adequately blinded using well 
designed shams.

The evidence in favour of TNS is based on a single small RCT (N=62), in which the 
Monarch device showed superiority over sham on gold standard measures of ADHD 
symptoms. This effect is promising but still awaits replication. For tDCs, there was no effect 
on ADHD symptoms in a trial using sham control. As expected, unblinded trials produce 
larger effects than blinded, sham trials. For example, unblinded TACS showed superiority 
to methylphenidate and unblinded rTMS was non-inferior to atomoxetine (appendix pp 
230–37). In trials integrating functional impairment measures, no significant between-group 
differences were detected for brain stimulation versus control, including in the blinded TNS 
trial. RCTs examining brain stimulation as an adjunct to other treatments find no effects. 
Mechanisms of brain stimulation are unclear; hypotheses are yet to be confirmed. Results of 
crossover studies are similar to RCTs (appendix pp 20–26).

Given the few blinded RCTs and, thus far, only unreplicated effects, there is insufficient 
evidence to recommend brain stimulation to children and adolescents with ADHD at 
present. Given the heterogeneity of tested interventions (eg, target brain region, montage, 
current, and duration), more research is needed within individual intervention types to better 
understand these treatments and to see if promising initial effects will be replicated. No or 
minor side-effects are reported; thus, brain stimulation can be tolerated as information about 
efficacy continues to emerge. However, brain stimulation cannot yet be recommended for 
paediatric ADHD given its high cost, low availability, and failure to show clear advantages 
over well established treatments.

Conclusions

Overall, no non-pharmacological treatments showed consistent strong effects on ADHD 
symptoms. Instead, several non-pharmacological treatments consistently affected broader 
outcomes that might be equally meaningful to participants, and one treatment (PUFAs) 
showed a modest effect on ADHD symptoms if consistently taken for at least 3 months.26 
Behaviour therapy is the only non-pharmacological treatment that can be considered as 
primary paediatric ADHD treatment given its effect on functional outcomes. However, 
multinutrients combining four or more ingredients, PUFAs, and mindfulness might be

considered secondary treatments (effects are consistent, but more modest). All other 
treatments have either inconsistent or insufficient evidence of effect on participant outcomes 
(appendix pp 17–19). Although there were several effective non-pharmacological treatments, 
similar to medication, these interventions remain vastly underused.60 Therefore, ongoing 
conversations are needed to educate participants and families about effective, available 
treatments. Increased use of effective treatments is a top priority for the field.

Integration of non-pharmacological treatments into ADHD care systems will help to 
maximise engagement in sustained, effective treatment that optimally fits participant values, 
goals, and presenting problems. Acknowledging the multiple biological and environmental 
factors contributing to ADHD (figure 1), we recommend combined treatment approaches 
personalised to the unique factors contributing to someone’s symptoms (panel 2). Even 
when a treatment is not yet recommendable, it might be considered if personalised factors 
indicate utility (eg, promoting physical activity in a young person with obesity, or promoting 
Traditional Chinese Medicine for a family valuing the Yin–Yang balance). Treatments 
without consistent evidence can still be leveraged to facilitate engagement in more effective 
treatments (eg, motivational interviewing to increase engagement with medication or address 
patient beliefs that might serve as barriers to behaviour therapy engagement). Similarly, 
tolerating lower value treatments that are appealing to children with ADHD or their families 
can build trust that promotes future acceptance of effective treatments.

As evidence for non-pharmacological interventions builds, the health-care sector should 
develop and evaluate sustainable system-level implementation models that promote the 
use of evidence-based primary and secondary non-pharmacological treatments, as well as 
their integration with pharmacological care. For example, there are increasing shifts in non-
pharmacological and pharmacological care to lay providers (ie, coaches, technicians, care 
coordinators, and peers), particularly in the digital era. If care implemented by a lay provider 
costs less than working with a clinician, this model might increase care availability at the 
system level. However, it remains unclear if lay providers implement non-pharmacological 
interventions with sufficient quality and efficacy. For example, recently popularised ADHD 
coaching is partially redundant with behaviour therapy approaches. Nearly no RCTs 
examine the safety and efficacy of behaviour therapy implemented by lay coaches; however, 
a coaching model might promote treatment availability if this workforce proves to be low-
cost, receives appropriate training and oversight from clinicians, and is properly regulated. 
However, some elements of coaching diverge from behaviour therapy (eg, providing ongoing 
reminders and assistance to youth vs supporting autonomy development) and might have 
adverse effects that require investigation (eg, fostering long-term dependence on the coach) 
before recommendation of these approaches.

Some treatments are marketed by profit-driven enterprises without adequate disclosure of 
their product’s failure to show meaningful efficacy or yet-to-be replicated results. With 
widespread direct-to-consumer marketing of these products on social media, clinicians 
should be prepared to provide clear, accurate information on the advantages and 
disadvantages of commercially available treatments (appendix pp 17–19) to ensure that 
participants are shepherded to appropriate care. Primary treatments should be favoured,

and opportunity costs considered, before implementing approaches with inconsistent or 
insufficient evidence.

Since our literature reviews in early 2022, several new papers were published that 
would probably have met our inclusion criteria;61,62 however, it does not appear that 
inclusion of these studies would change the conclusions of this Review. Some important 
treatment selection factors were outside this Review’s scope. Few studies examine 
developmental differences in care (ie, preschool vs childhood vs adolescence). Youth 
involvement in some treatments increases with age, which can threaten engagement 
but is crucial to supporting the transition to adult care models.63 Because behaviour 
therapy is predominantly multicomponent, we could not draw conclusions about efficacy 
of individual treatment elements. Combined treatment was also underexamined in the 
literature, as was long-term care. There is almost no research on combinations of effective 
non-pharmacological treatments (ie, PUFAs, multinutrients, or mindfulness combined with 
behaviour therapy), which is an important future direction for research. Sustained non-
pharmacological treatment can be a burdensome prospect; however, repeat administrations at 
key developmental transitions (eg, primary to more advanced schooling) might be a balanced 
approach to long-term care.

There is a tremendous need for higher quality research on non-pharmacological ADHD 
treatments. Many studies were excluded from this Review because they used designs 
with too many validity threats (appendix pp 4—13). Large-scale, well designed, parallel-
group RCTs are needed for treatments with insufficient evidence. For large but highly 
heterogeneous literature bases (eg, behaviour therapy and cognitive training), integrative 
data analysis techniques can be used to pool datasets to resolve inconsistencies and elucidate 
treatment moderators, mediators, and dose–response relationships.40,64 As the research base 
builds on what ADHD treatments work for whom and why, we will increasingly be able to 
use personalised medicine approaches to help children, young people, and their families to 
engage in treatment that works best for them. We look forward to an upcoming generation of 
research that builds the knowledge base on non-pharmacological care for ADHD.

Key messages

All non-pharmacological treatments were safe, but none showed a strong and 
consistent effect on ADHD symptom outcomes when gold standard research 
designs were evaluated

On the basis of its effect on participant and caregiver impairment, behaviour, 
and stress, (cognitive) behaviour therapy can be recommended as a primary 
paediatric ADHD treatment

Mindfulness, multinutrient supplementation with four or more ingredients, 
and polyunsaturated fatty acids can be recommended as secondary paediatric 
ADHD treatments on the basis of modest efficacy, especially on non-
symptom outcomes (eg, impairment and caregiver behaviours)

There was no effect in well controlled randomised controlled trials on 
outcomes that are meaningful to participants for cognitive training (digital 
interventions) and neurofeedback; these are not recommended at our current 
state of knowledge

There was inconsistent evidence for the efficacy of some body therapies 
(eg, acupuncture and massage) requiring stronger research, but some body 
therapies can be tolerated in the meantime, as they are safe and have general 
health benefits

There were insufficient randomised controlled trial data to draw conclusions 
about the efficacy of dietary interventions, most supplements, brain 
stimulation, physical activity, and some body therapies (eg, chiropractic), 
although there are some encouraging pilot data

Panel 1:

Operationally defined categories of non-pharmacological intervention

Behaviour therapy is an intervention directed at modifying behaviours (ie, increasing 
desired behaviours and decreasing undesired behaviours) based on social learning 
principles and other cognitive theories. These interventions include classical and operant 
contingency management, behaviour therapy (mainly through mediators such as parents 
or teachers) and cognitive behaviour therapy (eg, organisation skills training, problem 
solving strategies, social skills training, and metacognitive strategies such as cognitive 
restructuring). These treatments are usually offered in several sessions over time, through 
training the parents or teachers, the child, or both.

Cognitive training represents a non-pharmacological therapeutic approach that is distinct 
from more traditional psychological treatment approaches such as cognitive behavioural 
therapy. Specifically, rather than targeting cognitive components such as maladaptive 
patterns of thought as in more traditional cognitive therapy, cognitive training is focused 
on improving, or training, presumed underlying deficits in cognitive abilities such 
as attentional abilities, working memory, and behavioural inhibition. This training is 
accomplished through the repeated practice of the use of these abilities with progressively 
more difficult stimuli and tasks as performance improves.

Neurofeedback integrates principles of neuroscience and instrumental learning (ie, 
operant conditioning), aiming to augment one’s ability to regulate the brain’s electrical 
activity. Electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes at specific locations on the scalp 
measure the brain’s electrical activity, which is quantified and shown on a screen 
as feedback, often augmented by auditory rewards or points, to facilitate regulation 
of specific frequency bands or other electrical activity. In the most widely used 
neurofeedback protocol, slow wave power (θ band) is targeted for reduction and faster 
wave power (β band) is targeted for increase. Other cortex-oriented neurofeedback 
protocols target slow cortical potential or sensorimotor-rhythm. Newer strategies target 
deeper structures through low-resolution EEG tomography or use functional MRI or 
near-infrared spectroscopy for the feedback signal.

Body therapies include massage therapy, which involves exerting pressure on a 
participant’s body (often with a therapist’s hand); there are different types of massage 
therapy, such as Swedish massage, Thai massage, tuina, and reflexology. Acupuncture 
involves inserting thin needles through the skin on a participant’s body (including 
auricular therapy–acupuncture of the ear). Vestibular stimulation involves activation of 
the vestibular system located within the inner ear, such as through motions (eg, sit and 
squat in a swivelling chair or jump on a trampoline while rotating the body). Chiropractic 
therapy involves manual manipulation of the spine and joints.

Vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and other supplements include single nutrients or 
multinutrient interventions of four or more ingredients. Vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, 
and amino acids are all compounds required for normal physiological processes and 
growth. Since these compounds cannot be synthesised by the human body, many are 
deemed essential, meaning they must be obtained through diet or supplementation.

Herbs, as extracts, are non-essential isolated plant compounds that are thought to have 
beneficial effects on human physical and mental health and functioning.

Dietary interventions for ADHD treatment involve the modification of one’s diet, either 
by following a healthy dietary pattern (eg, Mediterranean diet), or by the elimination 
of foods (eg, top allergens such as eggs and dairy), food additives (eg, colours and 
flavours), and food components (eg, salicylates) associated with a hypersensitive reaction 
in children. The Mediterranean diet emphasises consumption of fruit, vegetables, nuts, 
grains, and fish, whereas the elimination diet, also known as the oligoantigenic diet 
or the few foods diet, restricts consumption of allergenic foods. The Feingold-Kaiser 
Permanente diet eliminates artificial food colours, additives, and salicylates.

Mindfulness-based intervention is an intervention that teaches mindfulness meditation 
techniques as the predominant treatment component that targets a clinical outcome. 
The construct of mindfulness is a complex, multi-faceted phenomenology derived from 
Buddhism that can be difficult to comprehensively define, although one commonly 
accepted definition is that mindfulness involves adopting a non-judgmental and accepting 
attitude with attention towards one’s experience in the present moment. In mindfulness-
based interventions, meditation is a practice whereby an individual can develop 
mindfulness. Mindfulness-based interventions are part of the third wave of psychological 
treatment, which emphasises acceptance and mindfulness strategies. Mindfulness-based 
interventions are commonly done in group settings. Although initial applications of 
mindfulness-based interventions were developed for adults, they have also been adapted 
to train parents and children.

Physical activity is the focus of exercise interventions; this includes physical activity with 
a self-control component (eg, martial arts) and physical activity based solely on aerobic 
exercise. Physical activity is proposed to improve ADHD symptoms by enhancing 
cognitive performance, possibly through reducing inflammation or directly influencing 
neurotransmission.

Brain stimulation is an intervention influencing brain activities (eg, changing action 
potential or spontaneous neural network excitability in targeted brain regions) via 
electric currents. These interventions include transcranial direct current stimulation 
(mainly through modulating spontaneous neural network excitability), alternating current 
stimulation, trigeminal nerve stimulation (using a battery-powered device to stimulate 
a nerve on the forehead called the trigeminal nerve), transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(inducing weak electric currents in the brain through rapidly changing magnetic field), 
and random noise stimulation (ie, the stimulation waveform is a noise signal, using a pair 
of electrodes to induce weak alternating current oscillating at random frequencies). These 
treatments are usually offered in several sessions over time, often through non-invasive 
procedures applied close to targeted brain regions.

Panel 2:

Non-pharmacological treatment selection recommendations for children 
and adolescents with ADHD

Shared decision making

Even more than with psychopharmacology, shared decision making between the provider 
and parents is desirable, and children and adolescents should join the treatment selection 
process when appropriate.

Combined treatment

Emphasise the value of combining multiple primary and secondary treatment approaches 
(figure 1) in targeting multipl mechanisms that contribute to ADHD symptoms.

Primary treatments

Clearly communicate that pharmacological treatment and multicomponent behaviour 
therapy are the two established, validated primary treatments for paediatric ADHD. 
Explain advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches (appendix pp 17–19). 
Encourage families to try at least one approach while considering the participant’s values, 
treatment goals, presenting problem profiles, and resources.

Secondary treatments

Multinutrients combining 4 or more ingredients, mindfulness, and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids showed replicated, consistent moderate effects and can be encouraged as secondary 
treatments in combination with primary treatments or if a primary treatment is not a fit 
for the participant and their family.

Engagement focused

Assess engagement barriers that might prevent access and sustained participation in 
treatments that are available locally. When there are strong threats to engagement, 
consider treatments with the highest likelihood of engaging the participant in any care, 
even if the treatment plan diverges from ideal practice. Revisit ideal practices once the 
child or adolescent is adequately engaged in care.

Participant matching

Consider factors that might contribute to an individual child or adolescent’s ADHD 
severity. Systematically assess symptoms and impairment. Match treatment to the 
mechanisms targeted by available treatments (figure 1). Consider known moderators 
of treatment for each category. Dose of treatment (eg, duration and intensity) might 
also need to be tailored to severity of presenting difficulties. Most efficacious treatment 
programmes include at least 8 weekly sessions attended by the parent and often the child 
or adolescent with ADHD.

Insufficient or inconsistent evidence: tolerate use but educate on limitations

Treatments with inconsistent evidence might work under some circumstances but not 
others. Treatments with insufficient evidence might prove to be effective once more

research is conducted. Both scenarios reduce the probability of success, but do not 
eliminate its possibility. All reviewed non-pharmacological treatments with insufficient 
or inconsistent evidence appear to be safe. Thus, providers should tolerate their use but 
emphasise the lower likelihood of success for these treatments and opportunity costs of 
using them instead of primary treatments. Treatments with inconsistent or insufficient 
evidence of effect on outcomes that are meaningful to participants and their families 
include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Cognitive training (ie, digital interventions)

Neurofeedback

Body therapies (eg, massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic interventions)

Amino acids, melatonin, herbs, single minerals, and vitamins

Dietary interventions

Physical activity

Brain stimulation (eg, trigeminal nerve and transcranial direct current 
stimulation)

Learn the costs and availability of treatments in your community

Providers should be aware of the availability and costs (financial and time) of local 
and commercial non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD, as well as the credentials 
of providers. When a treatment with insufficient or low evidence is offered locally at a 
high cost (typically by profit-driven entities), providers should be prepared to educate 
participants about costs of treatment (eg, financial, time, and burden) in relation to its 
likelihood of success. Low-cost treatments are preferable when evidence is insufficient or 
inconsistent.

Search strategy and selection criteria

References for this Review were first identified by ten separate searches of PubMed for 
each category of intervention (see appendix [pp 4–13] for search dates by category). 
Using the PICO framework (ie, population, intervention, comparator, outcome) we 
standardised search terms for population:

[(((attention defic*[Title]) OR (attention disorder*[Title]) OR (attention dysfunc*[Title]) 
OR (hyperactiv*[Title]) OR (hyper-activ*[Title]) OR (hyperkin*[Title]) OR 
(hyperkin*[Title]) OR (impulsiv*[Title]) OR (inattentiv*[Title]) OR (inattention*[Title]) 
OR (minimal brain damage[Title]) OR (minimal brain disorder[Title]) OR (minimal brain 
dysfunction[Title]) OR (adhd[Title]) OR (addh[Title]) OR (ad/hd[Title]) OR (adhs[Title]) 
OR (attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity[MeSH Major Topic]) OR (hkd[Title]))] 
and allowed intervention search terms to vary by category (see appendix [pp 2–3] for 
search syntax).

Comparator and outcome were allowed to vary across intervention category searches 
and are reported as findings in this Review. We restricted searches to papers that were 
published in English; when possible, we incorporated articles in foreign languages (eg,

Spanish and Mandarin) according to the language competencies of the research team. 
After the PubMed search, manual searches were performed by authors based on the 
reference lists of identified papers. A title and abstract search occurred first, followed 
by a full text review of papers. Inclusion criteria were: (1) full sample has a diagnosis 
of ADHD; (2) study evaluated treatment efficacy using quantitative methodology; (3) 
full sample is paediatric or reports efficacy outcomes for a paediatric subsample (all 
participants were 19 years or younger).

Within each category of intervention, we examined only randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) with appropriate statistical analyses and meta-analyses of RCTs when there 
were at least three RCTs identified within for specific interventions. Non-randomised 
observational designs were extracted and reviewed when fewer than three RCTs were 
identified. We avoided interpretation of within-subject effects in the absence of a control 
group.

We assigned narrative quality of evidence ratings using an adapted Grading 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework (appendix pp 
15–16). Strength of evidence was also rated for each treatment category, adapted from 
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Methods Guide for Comparative 
Effectiveness Reviews (appendix pp 17–19).

Figure 2: Venn diagrams representing components of behaviour therapy interventions
Operant reinforcement was present in almost all behaviour therapy packages (90·2%), as 
was parent skills training (82·4%). Youth (55·9%) and teacher (18·6%) skills training were 
less common. Youth skills training included social (30·4%), problem-solving (30·4%), 
organisation (28·4%), and metacognitive (13·7%) skills. Motivational interviewing, an 
engagement strategy, was bundled into 6·9% of packages. On average, treatments possessed 
approximately three components. Numbers indicate the number of intervention packages 
that have that component.
