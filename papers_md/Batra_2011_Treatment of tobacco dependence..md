Treatment of Tobacco Dependence

Anil Batra

SUMMARY
Background: 110 000 to 140 000 people die in Germany 
each year of tobacco-related diseases. Thus, measures 
should be taken to lower the number of persons who start 
smoking, encourage smokers to stop, and keep those who 
have stopped from starting again, in order to achieve a 
sustained benefit in public health.

Method: We present recommendations for the diagnostic 
evaluation, counseling, psychotherapy, and pharmacother-
apy of smokers, derived from the findings of current Coch-
rane meta-analyses and from the pertinent German-
 language and American guidelines.

Results: Motivational interviewing by a physician, includ-
ing a recommendation to stop smoking and counseling on 
how to do this, can reinforce a smoker’s motivation to quit. 
Behavioral therapeutic approaches support changes in 
 behavior, while medical aids such as nicotine replacement 
therapy, bupropion, and varenicline help former smokers 
overcome the initial withdrawal symptoms. Low-threshold 
measures such as self-help books, telephone counseling, 
and Internet-based cessation programs complement the 
evidence-based treatments. With a combination of medi-
cations and psychotherapeutic support, abstinence rates 
of up to approximately 40% can be achieved at the end of 
one year.

Conclusion: Smokers who decide to quit can benefit 
from their doctors’ support. Physicians should be taught 
about tobacco dependency and how to treat it as part of 
their undergraduate medical education, residency training, 
and continuing medical education.

W ith the design of highly synthetic cigarettes and 

through a sustained effort by the tobacco indus-
try  to  market  their  products  since  the  end  of  the  last 
century,  the  popularity  of  smoking  reached  its  peak. 
The special fascination of smoking for adolescents lies 
in  an  association  with  certain  socially  valued  traits 
(freedom,  autonomy,  strength)  that  is  reinforced  by 
cigarette advertising. Over time, tobacco consumption 
takes  on  social  and  psychological  functions  for  the 
smoker.  For  many  smokers,  smoking  can  ease 
 communication, justify a break from work, serve as a 
reward, curb the appetite, ward off fatigue, or suppress 
negative 
(stress,  boredom,  nervousness, 
anxiety,  depression).  The  neurobiological  effect  of 
 nicotine 
is  perceived  as  rewarding,  stimulating, 
 appetite-reducing, vigilance-promoting, or calming. Its 
multifarious  psychotropic  effects  are  traceable  to  the 
nicotine-mediated release of dopamine, noradrenaline, 
serotonin,  and  beta-endorphin.  Physical  dependence 
arises in regular smokers through an adaptation of the 
dopamingergic system and an increase in the number of 
nicotinic 
receptors.  A 
 dependent  smoker  who  stops  consuming  nicotine 
 experiences withdrawal symptoms (e1).

Learning objectives
 The learning objectives for readers of this article are:

● to  become  acquainted  with  the  techniques  of 
motivational interviewing that will strengthen the 
patient’s motivation to quit smoking; 

● to gain an overview of the available types of sup-

portive pharmacotherapy;

● to  learn  about  the  many  available  low-threshold 

aids to smoking cessation.

Tobacco  consumption  is  the  single  most  important 
preventable  risk  to  health.  Smokers  lose,  on  average, 
about ten years of life. In a long-term prospective study 
of  35 000  people,  81%  of  the  nonsmokers,  but  only 
58%  of  the  smokers,  reached  age  70;  59%  of  the

 function of smoking 
status among 
 British physicians 
(from [1])

 non-smokers,  but  only  26%  of  the  smokers,  reached 
age 80 (Figure) (1). In Germany alone, smoking con-
tributes to the premature death of 110 000 to 140 000 
people each year (2). An estimated 11% of overall mor-
tality  is  due  to  smoking,  and  6%  to  the  combined 
 effects of alcohol consumption and smoking. 

The main tobacco-associated diseases are cancers of 
the  respiratory  tract,  cardiovascular  diseases,  and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). More-
over,  other  types  of  cancer  are  also  more  common  in 
smokers. Persons with mental illnesses such as anxiety 
disorders, depression, schizophrenia, eating disorders, 
and alcohol and drug dependence are much more likely 
to be smokers than the general population (3). 

In  recent  decades,  the  combined  effect  of  primary 
prevention,  the  rising  cost  of  cigarettes,  advertising 
bans, and laws to protect nonsmokers has been to lower 
the prevalence of smoking, particularly among children 
and adolescents aged 12 to 17. In 2010, 14.2% of boys 
and 11.5% of girls aged 12 to 17 were smokers; these 
figures  are  the  lowest  since  1979  (4).  The  German 
 Federal Statistical Office has documented a nearly con-
stant prevalence of smoking among adults since 1999; 
in 2009, about 26% of the overall population aged 15 
and  above  were  smokers  (5).  Clearly,  more  effective 
measures need to be taken to improve primary preven-
tion  among  the  general  public.  Health-care  providers 
need to be more aware of the dangers of smoking, pro-
mote  tobacco  abstinence  more  vigorously,  and  offer 
treatment more often to their patients who need it.

The  following  information  and  recommendations 

 regarding the diagnostic evaluation of smokers as well 
as  motivational 
interviewing,  psychotherapy,  and 
 pharmacotherapy  for  smoking  cessation  are  derived 
from  the  current  German  and  American  treatment 
guidelines  and  from  Cochrane  meta-analyses.  The 
 current version of the American guidelines (2008) con-
tains  valuable  reference  information  on  the  scientific 
evidence for the efficacy of various treatments for to-
bacco  dependence  (6).  The  Drug  Commission  of  the 
German Medical Association recently updated its treat-
ment  recommendations  for  tobacco  depedence  (7).  In 
2008,  the  German  Society  for  Pulmonology  and 
 Respiratory Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pneu-
mologie  und  Beatmungsmedizin,  DGP)  issued  an  S3 
guideline on smoking cessation in patients with COPD 
(8,  9).  The  German  Association  for  Psychiatry  and 
 Psychotherapy (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie, 
Psychotherapie und Nervenheilkunde, DGPPN) and the 
German  Association  for  the  Study  and  Treatment  of 
Addiction  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  für  Suchtforschung 
und  Suchttherapie,  DG-Sucht)  are  currently  revising 
their  guidelines  on  smoking  cessation  (10),  which  are 
issued under the auspices of the Association of Scien-
tific  Medical  Societies  in  Germany  (Arbeitsgemein-
schaft  der  Wissenschaftlichen  Medizinischen  Fachge-
sellschaften, AWMF).

Diagnostic evaluation
Important information for the physician guiding a pa-
tient  through  outpatient  smoking  cessation  includes: 
the  extent  and  duration  of  tobacco  consumption,  the 
number of prior attempts to quit smoking, the presence 
or absence of tobacco dependence, any prior treatments 
for  smoking  cessation,  and—if  medications  are  to  be 
given  to  help  the  patient  quit  smoking—any  current 
 illnesses and medications.

two  relevant  diagnoses, 
The  ICD-10  contains 
 tobacco  abuse  (F17.1)  and 
tobacco  dependence 
(F17.2). The latter requires the presence in the past year 
of  at  least  3  of  the  6  criteria  listed  in  Box  1  (10). A 
number of authors have estimated that 50% to 60% of 
smokers are tobacco-dependent by this definition (11).

Beyond this categorization of tobacco smoking into 
two  conditions  (abuse  and  dependence),  there  are 
questionnaires  and  self-assessment  instruments  that 
enable a dimensional assessment of the severity of de-
pendence.  A  popular  one  is  the  Fagerström  Test  for 
Nicotine Dependence (FTND, 12), in which six ques-
tions are used to assess the severity of dependence on

an  overall  scale  from  0  to  10  (Box  2).  High  scores 
 reflect the appearance of physical withdrawal phenom-
ena  and  a  lower  probability  of  long-term  abstinence. 
Smokers can self-administer this test in two minutes; it 
is  recommended  for  use  in  diagnostic  assessment  as 
well as in motivational support and differential treat-
ment  planning.  Other,  less  commonly  used  question-
naires  that  address  the  urge  to  smoke  (Questionnaire 
on Smoking Urges, QSU [13]) or smoking behavior in 
adolescents  (Hooked  on  Nicotine  Checklist,  HONC 
[14]) play no more than a minor role in routine care. 

risk 

Pack-years (the product of the patient’s daily ciga-
rette consumption, in packs per day, and the duration 
of smoking, in years) are an important indicator of the 
to  health.  The  carbon 
tobacco-associated 
 monoxide concentration in exhaled air is both a good 
indicator  of  the  toxic  load  and  a  useful  means  of 
checking the patient’s compliance with a smoking ces-
sation  program.  A  suitable  apparatus  is  used  to 
measure  the  fraction  of  exhaled  air  consisting  of  CO 
molecules, in parts per million (ppm), after the patient 
takes  a  deep  breath,  holds  his  or  her  breath  for  15 
 seconds, and then exhales (smokers usually have valu-
es from 10 to 40 ppm; a value of 8 ppm is consistent 
with 
for  many 
smokers,  a  demonstrated  reduction  of  the  CO  load 
serves as a positive motivating factor for persisting in 
the effort to quit. Alternatively, the intensity of tobacco 
consumption can be assessed by measuring the carbo-
xyhemoglobin  (CO-Hb)  concentration  in  the  blood 
(smokers  have  values  of  3%  or  more  of  total  hemo -
globin; values of up to 15% are possible, and the maxi-
mum normal value is 1.8%).

Measurement of tobacco metabolites (principally coti-
nine) in the urine, serum, or saliva is useful in research 
studies but unnecessary in routine care. Physicians are ad-
vised to use a documentation system for recording the test 
findings described above; meticulous recording makes it 
more likely that treatment for smoking cessation will be 
recommended (6).

Motivational strategies for smoking cessation
Many smokers who try to quit end up resuming their 
habit. It is estimated that only 3% to 6% of those who 
try to quit actually abstain from smoking for an entire 
year or more. A physician’s mere advice to quit smok-
ing  does  indeed  have  some  effect  and  should  be  re-
peated  at  every  suitable  juncture,  but  the  abstinence 
rate cannot be appreciably raised in this way. Modern

ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Tobacco Dependence
● A strong desire or compulsion to take tobacco
● Difficulty controlling the onset, cessation, or quantity of tobacco-taking behavior 
● Withdrawal phenomena on reduction or cessation of consumption (insomnia, 
nervousness, irritability, increased appetite, depressed mood); consumption to 
alleviate withdrawal phenomena

● Tolerance: increased doses of tobacco are needed to achieve the same effect 
● Progressive neglect of other activities and interests because of tobacco use 
● Persistent use despite overtly harmful consequences

techniques of physician-patient communication, based 
on  Miller  and  Rollnick’s  conception  of  motivational 
interviewing  (15),  are  intended  to  bring  the  smoker, 
through dialogue, to the realization that the long-term 
benefits of abstinence and the harm caused by smoking 
(damaged  health,  feeling  of  dependence,  cost)  vastly 
outweigh the short-term drawbacks of abstinence (fear 
of failure, fear of weight gain, loss of the function of 
smoking  in  overcoming  feelings  such  as  boredom, 
stress,  anxiety)  and  the  benefits  of  smoking  (boosted 
social confidence, taste, rewarding effect of nicotine).

smokers  who  are  poorly  motivated  to  quit  can  be 
counseled  in  five  steps  called  “The  Five  R’s”  (6) 
(Box  3).  Motivational  interviewing  is  effective 
(RR  =  1.27,  CI  =  1.14–1.42)  (16),  with  a  12-month 
success rate of 5% to 10%.

More extensive counseling, in multiple sessions of 
at least 10 minutes each, is considered to be an effec-
tive mode of support that can be provided in a doc-
tor’s  office,  in  the  hospital,  or  even  over  the  tele-
phone. The efficacy of proactive telephone counsel-
ing  has  been  demonstrated  in  meta-analyses  (17) 
(eBox 1). 

Psychotherapy
Motivation  and  resolve  are  important  prerequisites 
for  smoking  cessation.  Every  smoker  should  be 
 advised to make his or her own effort to quit. If this 
effort fails, or if the smoker feels unable to quit with-
out  help,  then  more  extensive  techniques  based  on 

Motivation
 In the motivational interview, the smoker should 
be made aware of the advantages and disadvan-
tages of smoking and abstinence from smoking.

psychotherapy  should  be  used.  The  recommended 
 elements  of  treatment  are  derived  from  behavioral 
therapy;  there  is  inadequate  evidence  to  support 
 psychodynamically  oriented  treatments,  because  of 
the lack of relevant controlled trials. Cessation pro-
grams  are  based  on  the  premises  that  psychological 
dependency  arises  by  operant  and  classical  condi-
tioning,  and 
that  cognitive  processes,  personal 
 values, and the functionality of tobacco consumption 
play  a  major  role  in  maintaing  smoking  behavior. 
Such programs combine psychoeducation and moti-
vational 
techniques  with  behavioral-therapeutic 
 elements. Further important components are the use 
of external social aids, techniques to prevent the re-
sumption  of  smoking,  and  ways  of  dealing  with 
short-term recidivism.

These  elements  of  treatment  can  be  provided 
either  in  group  therapy  or  in  an  individual  thera-
peutic setting. In one popular model, a smoking ces-
sation group of 6 to 12 patients undergoes treatment 
together in 6 to 10 sessions consisting of two 90 to 
120 minute therapeutic units each.

Meta-analyses of the effect of psychotherapy have 
shown  that  individual  smoking  counseling  is  more 
effective  than  simple  counseling  (13.9%  vs.  10.8%, 
RR = 1.39  [CI  1.24–1.57])  (18).  Group  therapy  and 
individual counseling are the most effective types of 
treatment and are equally effective (19). Mean absti-
nence  rates  above  30%  have  been  reported  when  at 
least  8  counseling  sessions  are  combined  with 
 pharmacotherapeutic support (6).

Alternative, 

low-threshold  smoking  cessation 
including  self-help  manuals  and  online 
aids, 
 smoking  cessation  programs  based  on  behavioral 
therapy, can also be recommended. Their anonymity 
and  ready  availability  lead  some  smokers  to  prefer 
them  to  group  therapy.  The  efficacy  of  online 
 programs has been inadequately studied to date (20) 
(eBox 2). 

Supportive pharmacotherapy 
From the perspective of addiction therapy, the main 
emphasis  of  professional  support  must  lie  in  effec-
tuating  a  change  in  the  patient’s  behavior.  Early 
symptoms of nicotine withdrawal can, however, lead 
patients  to  take  up  smoking  again  soon  after  they 
quit;  their  suppression  makes  abstinence  easier  to 
maintain  in  the  first  few  weeks  after  cessation. 
 Supportive pharmacotherapy yields long-term success 

The severity of nicotine dependence
The Fagerström test for nicotine dependence 
(FTND, 12) measures the severity of dependence 
on a scale from 0 to 10 on the basis of the 
 patient’s answers to a six-item questionnaire.

Changed behavior
Changed behavior is the main prerequisite for 
long-term abstinence from smoking. Behavioral-
therapeutic smoking cessation programs are the 
most effective of all.

rates as high as 22% (compared to ca. 10% for placebo 
treatment).  When  medications  are  combined  with 
psychotherapeutic help, abstinence rates of ca. 20% 
or  up  to  30%  can  be  achieved  at  6  months  (with 
 nicotine chewing gum and varenicline, respectively). 
Medications  that  are  approved  in  Germany  for  the

include  various 
 nicotine-replacement preparations (patches, chewing

and  the  partial  nicotine-receptor  antagonist  vareni-
cline. 

tobacco  abstinence 

Medications  that  have  been  found  to  be  effective 
aids  to  smoking  cessation,  but  are  not  approved  for 
this  indication  in  Germany,  include  the  partial 
 nicotine-receptor  antagonist  cytisine  (approved  for 
this  indication  in  eastern  European  countries),  the 
tricyclic  antidepressant  nortriptyline,  and  the  anti -
hypertensive  agent  clonidine.  In  the  next  few  para-
graphs, we will summarize the main features of each 
of these medications.

Nicotine  replacement  is  intended  to  give  the 
smoker, for a limited time only, a steadily diminish-
ing dose of nicotine without the toxic substances that 
accompany  nicotine  derived  from  cigarette  smoke. 
The various products differ in the kinetics of nicotine 
release.  Nicotine  patches  yield  a  constant  serum 
 nicotine  concentration  and  thus  prevent  nicotine-
withdrawal phenomena. Nicotine chewing gum, tab-
lets, or inhalers yield a rapid increase in nicotine con-
centration and give the user a feeling of control over 
nicotine intake, but they do not adequately mimic the 
rapid nicotine release from a cigarette. Nicotine nasal 
spray  (approved,  but  not  marketed,  in  Germany) 
comes closest to doing so but, for this very reason, is 
the most likely of all smoking cessation aids to create 
dependence  itself.  Patients  with  severe  withdrawal 
symptoms  can  be  treated  with  a  combination  of 
 products, e.g., a patch together with chewing gum or 
nicotine  tablets.  Nicotine  replacement  should  be 
 provided  for  eight  to  twelve  weeks  and  gradually 
 reduced during this time. 

The  side  effects  of  nicotine  administration  are 
well  known  to  smokers  from  their  previous  long-
term consumption of nicotine via cigarettes. The in-
dividual nicotine replacement products can also have 
specific  local  side  effects  that  are  not  produced  by 
cigarette  smoking  (e.g.,  skin  irritation,  irritation  of 
the nasal mucosa, hiccups, abdominal pain). 

Supportive pharmacotherapy
Supportive pharmacotherapy helps the patient get 
through the short-term symptoms of withdrawal.

The “Five R’s” counseling algorithm
● Relevance 

 Based on knowledge of the patient’s physical condition, familial and social 
 situation, personal goals, health problems (if any), and possible prior attempts 
to quit smoking, the physician can explain to the patient how these are related 
to his or her current tobacco comsumption.

● Risks 

 Again based on the above knowledge, the physician can explain the short- 
and long-term risks that smoking poses to the patient and the impact of these 
risks on the patient’s family.

● Rewards  

 The smoker should understand and appreciate the potential personal advan-
tages of quitting smoking. 

● Roadblocks 

 Smokers who are willing to quit smoking but never actually make an attempt 
usually do so out of fear: fear of failure, fear of weight gain or depression, fear 
of withdrawal symptoms, or fear of unhappiness due to loss of the pleasant 
sensations of smoking. 

● Repetition  

 Repetition is important! At every contact with the physician, the smoker should 
be asked about his or her current motivation to quit. Repetition gradually re -
inforces the motivation to quit.

Bupropion is a monocyclic, activating antidepress-
ant  that  is  structurally  related  to  amphetamine.  It 
mimics the effect of cigarette-derived nicotine by in-
hibiting the reuptake of noradrenaline and dopamine, 
and it is thought to reduce nicotine-withdrawal mani-
festations  by  this  mechanism  as  well.  Sleep  distur -
bances are a very common side effect; common ones 
include  (among  others)  tremor,  headache,  difficulty 
concentrating, dizziness, dry mouth, and gastrointes-
tinal  complaints.  Epileptic  seizures  arise  occasion-
ally,  and  the  drug  is  therefore  contraindicated  for 
 patients  who  are  at  elevated  risk  of  a  seizure.  The 
physician must also be aware of possible interactions 
including  anti -
with  various  other  medications 
and 
psychotic

Nicotine replacement therapy
The goal of nicotine replacment is to give the

 diminishing dose of nicotine without the toxic 
substances that accompany nicotine derived 
from cigarette smoke.

of the craving for smoking and preventing a subjec-
tively positive effect of any additional  nicotine taken 
up  from  cigarettes.  Users  report  abnormal  dreams, 
sleep  disturbances,  headache,  and  nausea  as  very 
common  side  effects;  the  common  ones  are  dizzi-
ness, 
fatigue,  and  gastrointestinal  complaints. 
Vareni cline  is  contraindicated  for  use  by  pregnant 
women,  children,  and  adolescents,  as  well  as  by 
smokers  with  mental  illnesses  in  view  of  a  few 
 reported  cases  of  suicidal  thoughts  and  behavior. 
 Varenicline  can  interact  with  cimetidine,  warfarin, 
and nicotine replacement drugs.

The indication for either bupropion or varenicline 
should  be  considered  carefully  in  view  of  the  sub-
stantial  likelihood  of  side  effects.  The  patient  can 
continue to smoke in the first few weeks of adminis-
tration of either drug, while the dose is still rising. In 
this phase, most users already perceive cigarettes as 
less  satisfying  than  before,  and  accordingly  smoke 
less. The recommended duration of treatment is eight 
weeks for bupropion and twelve weeks for varenicline. 
If the treatment succeeds, but the patient remains 
in danger of taking up smoking again, all of the ap-
proved products can be given for a longer time. None 
of them are recommended for underaged or pregnant 
patients,  although  pregnant  women  who  cannot  re-
main  abstinent  without  this  kind  of  help  can  take  a 
nicotine replacement preparation under a physician’s 
supervision. Nicotine replacement therapy is always 
better than cigarette smoking! (Box 4)

and 

The  efficacy  of  these  drugs  has  been  repeatedly 
studied and evaluated in meta-analyses. The superior 
effectiveness  of  nicotine  replacement  therapy  over 
placebo  has  been  documented,  with  RR = 1.58 
(CI = 1.50–1.66) (21). The same is true of bupropion 
varenicline 
(RR = 1.69,  CI = 1.53–1.85) 
(RR = 2.31,  CI = 2.01–2.66)  (22,  23).  Even  though 
the  latter  two  drugs  seem  to  be  more  effective  than 
nicotine  replacement  therapy,  they  are  recommended 
less highly in the guidleines of the Drug Commission 
of  the  German  Medical  Association  (7)  because  of 
their  more  severe  side  effects  and  risks.  A  recent 
meta-analysis of the available data from clinical trials 
revealed  an  elevated  risk  of  cardiovascular  events 
with  varenicline  use  (OR = 1.72;  95%  CI  1.09–2.71, 
frequency  of  events  1.06%  in  the  varenicline  group 
and 0.82% in the placebo group) (24).

Treatments with no evidence of efficacy
Other  treatments  such  as  acupuncture  and  hypnosis 
are popular but are not recommended in the current 
treatment  guidelines.  Meta-analyses  of  the  use  of 
acupuncture  for  smoking  cessation  have  revealed 
long-term  abstinence  rates  no  different  from  those 
obtained with placebo treatment (approximately 8% 
for  acupuncture  versus  9%  for  placebo)  (25).  The 
data on hypnosis and hypnotherapy are so inconsis -
tent that their use cannot be recommended (6). Nor is 
there  any  recognized  proof  of  efficacy  for  other 
methods  such  as  electrical  or  electronic  cigarettes, 
various  naturopathic  and  homeopathic  medications, 
some medications that have already been mentioned 
above,  and  many  other  techniques  that  are  of  an 
 esoteric  nature  or  rely  principally  on  the  power  of 
suggestion.

Certified training programs and the 
 reimbursement of smoking cessation 
 counseling and treatment 
Even though tobacco consumption is a major direct 
or  contributory  cause  of  many  diseases,  the  com-
munication  of  information  for  the  counseling  of 
smokers  and  the  treatment  of  dependent  smokers 
who  are  willing  to  quit  have  long  been  neglected 
topics  in  medical  school  and  in  continuing  medical 
education. A  curriculum  entitled  Tabakabhängigkeit 
(“Tobacco  Dependence”)  and  certified  by 
the 
 German  Medical  Association  has  been  available 
since  2008  (e2).  This  “blended-learning”  program, 

The duration of nicotine replacement therapy
Nicotine replacement should be provided for 
 8 to 12 weeks and gradually reduced during 
 this time. 

Treatments with no evidence of efficacy
Treatments such as acupuncture and hypnosis 
are popular but are not recommended in the 
current treatment guidelines.

to 500 euros, depending on the type of course and on 
the provider; supportive pharmacotherapy for smok-
ing cessation, in accordance with the guidelines, can 
cost  up  to  300  euros.  The  long-term  efficacy  of 
smoking  cessation  is  higher  when  medical  and 
 psychological support for it are reimbursed (e4).

Recently,  there  have  been  calls  for  smoking  ces-
sation  treatment  to  be  regarded  as  part  of  the  treat-
ment  of  COPD,  which  would  imply  that  its  costs 
must  be  covered  by  statutory  health  insurance.  An 
analogous classification would also be justifiable for 
smokers  with  other  physical  illnesses  whose  course 
would  be  positively  influenced  by  smoking  ces-
sation,  as  well  as  for  pregnant  women  who  smoke 
and for persons diagnosed as tobacco-dependent.

In  Germany,  physician-provided  counseling  and 
treatment  for  the  purpose  of  smoking  cessation  are 
reimbursed  as  “individual  health  care  provisions” 
(individuelle 
IGEL-
 Leistungen),  i.e.,  they  are  not  paid  for  by  the  statu-
tory  health  insurance  carriers,  but  rather  by  the  pa-
tients directly. The carriers do contribute to the cost 
of  smoking  cessation  courses,  as  these  are  consid -
ered  preventive  measures  under  pertinent  German 
health  law  (§20  SGB  V),  but  they  do  not  pay  for 

Counseling and treatment options  
in primary care
Simple counseling strategies can also be successful; 
thus, physicians should address the issue of smoking 
with  every  smoker,  taking  a  smoking  history  (daily 
cigarette  consumption,  attempts  to  quit)  and  inquir-
ing  about  the  smoker’s  current  motivation  to  quit. 
 Instruments  such  as  the  FTND  are  useful  aids  to 
motivational  work;  motivational  interviewing  tech-
niques, 
which  increase  the  smoker’s  cognitive  dissonance 
with  regard  to  the  continuation  of  smoking  and 
 create a motivation to quit, can be conducted in brief 
sessions according to the Five R’s model. If the pa-
tient  cannot  participate  successfully  in  a  smoking 
cessation  program,  and  if  telephone  counseling,  in-
ternet-based cessation programs, and self-help litera-
ture  are  not  available,  then  weekly  contacts  with  a 
physician to discuss progress and any difficulties in 

Techniques for the counseling of smokers
Techniques for the counseling and support of 
smokers trying to quit are taught in the German 
Medical Association’s curriculum entitled 
 Tabakabhängigkeit (“tobacco dependence”).

Reimbursement of smoking cessation therapy
In Germany, physician-provided counseling and 
treatment for smoking cessation are “individual 
health care provisions.” Insurers contribute to 
the cost of smoking cessation courses but do 
not pay for medication.

combination with supportive medication might be an 
appropriate alternative. 

Persons who quit smoking can expect a long-term 
weight gain of 4 to 7 kg (e5, e6). Bupropion, vareni-
cline, nicotine-replacement therapy, and medications 
such as dexfenfluramine or fluoxetine can counteract 
weight  gain  in  the  short  term,  but  their  long-term 
 efficacy is uncertain. Weight can possibly be reduced 
over  the  long  term  by  increased  exercise  (e6).  The 
potential adverse effects of moderate weight gain are 
far outweighed by the benefits of tobacco abstinence 
(e5).

Treatment of Tobacco Dependence

Anil Batra

Case Illustration

A 46-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with 
an  acute  coronary  syndrome.  He  had  smoked  ciga-
rettes since age 17, a total of 45 pack-years, recently 
about 40 cigarettes per day. His FTND score was 8. 
He  had  made  one  previous  serious  attempt  to  quit 
smoking  (without  supportive  medication),  which 
failed when he smoked a cigarette “to test himself” 
two months later. His reasons for smoking included 
what  he  perceived  to  be  stress  reduction,  increased 
concentration,  and  relaxation  attributable  to  smok-
ing. Despite concern for his health and dissatisfaction 
with his own dependence on cigarettes, he had made 
no  further  attempts  to  quit,  because  he  feared  any 
such attempt would fail. 

Smoking cessation conseling began with detailed pa-
tient education about the available types of support. 
The  patient  decided  to  stop  smoking  and  agreed  to 
come  for  regular  follow-up  visits  over  the  ensuing 

weeks. Nevertheless, he could not quit as desired be-
cause  of  marked  nervousness,  agitation,  irritability, 
and  sleep  disturbances,  and  nicotine  replacement 
therapy was recommended. In view of his high daily 
cigarette  consumption  and  his  marked  nicotine  de-
pendence, combined treatment with a nicotine patch 
and  nicotine  chewing  gum  (4  mg)  was  prescribed, 
and this indeed reduced his craving for cigarettes. He 
succeeded  in  giving  up  cigarettes  entirely  by  his 
chosen  target  date.  In  a  subsequent  six-week  phase 
with  weekly  follow-up  visits,  he  considered  alter-
native  means  of  stress  reduction  and  relaxation,  as 
well as ways to deal with situations that might lead 
him to take up smoking again. The nicotine replace-
ment  therapy  was  successfully  tapered  over  the 
course of eight weeks of treatment, and then discon-
tinued.
