Investigating changes in mental illness stigma and
discrimination after the Time to Change
programme in England

Amy Ronaldson and Claire Henderson

Background

Between 2008 and 2019, we reported positive change relating to
mental health stigma and discrimination among the adult
population of England, supporting the effectiveness of the Time
to Change campaign.

Aims
Using data from the Attitudes to Mental Illness survey (2008/2009
to 2023), we investigated the extent to which positive changes in
stigma were sustained by 2023, 2 years after the programme’s
end in 2021.

Method

We used regression analyses to evaluate trends in outcomes.
Measures were of stigma-related knowledge (Mental Health
Knowledge Schedule (MAKS)), attitudes (Community Attitudes
toward the Mentally Ill scale (CAMI)) and desire for social dis-
tance (Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS)). We also
examined willingness to interact with people based on vignettes
of depression and schizophrenia, and attitudes toward work-
place discrimination, using data from the British Social Attitudes
Survey for comparison.

Results
CAMI scores improved between 2008 and 2023 (s.d. 0.24, 95% CI
0.16–0.31), but decreased since 2019 (P = 0.015). After improve-
ments between 2009 and 2019, 2023 MAKS and RIBS scores no

longer differed from 2009 scores, indicating decreases in stigma-
related knowledge (MAKS scores declined 7.8%; P < 0.001) and
willingness to interact (RIBS scores declined by 10.2%; P < 0.001)
since 2019. Conversely, comparison with British Social Attitudes
Survey data indicated that willingness to interact with people
with depression and schizophrenia increased gradually between
2007, 2015 and 2023, and attitudes to workplace discrimination
also improved.

Conclusions
The lasting positive changes reflect support for non-discrimin-
ation and willingness to interact with someone after a sense of
familiarity is evoked. Besides the end of Time to Change, inter-
pretations for declines in other outcomes include the COVID-19
pandemic and economic stress.

Stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness have
substantial public health impact, contributing to inequalities1 such
as poor access to mental and physical healthcare,2 reduced life expect-
ancy,3 exclusion from higher education and employment,4 increased
contact with criminal justice systems, victimisation,5 poverty and
homelessness. There is growing investment in and evidence for the
effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions, including programmes tar-
geted at the general population and/or specific groups.6

Time to change

In England, a programme against stigma and discrimination, Time
to Change,7 was delivered by the charities Mind and Rethink Mental
Illness between 2007 and 2021. Its first two phases ran from 2007 to
2011 and 2011 to 2015, and included a social marketing campaign
launched in January 2009 that was aimed at adults aged 25–44
years in middle-income groups, and work with target groups. To
evaluate Time to Change’s effect on public stigma, in 2009, mea-
sures of stigma-related knowledge and desire for social distance
were added to the pre-existing national Attitudes to Mental
Illness survey (AMI).8

Between 2009 and 2019, there were significant improvements in
stigma-related knowledge, attitudes and desire for social distance.9
Surveys of those who used mental health services showed evidence
for a reduction in direct experiences of discrimination across mul-
tiple areas of
life, particularly informal relationships, between
2008 and 2014.10

Time to Change phase 3 ran from 2016 to 2021. The social mar-
keting campaign from 2017 was aimed again at those aged 25–44
years, but in an income group overlapping but lower than before,
and focused on men’s mental health. The campaign promoted
empathy as a key mediator of the effect of contact on prejudice,11
while encouraging people to maintain contact12 (as opposed to
avoidance). In the process, the campaign delivered parasocial
(virtual) contact12 and promoted imagined contact.13 Time to
Change ended on 31 March 2021.

We previously reported positive change in stigma-related
knowledge, attitudes to mental illness and desire for social distance
from people with mental illness among the adult general population
of England between 2008 and 2019, supporting the effectiveness of
the social marketing campaign.9

Other research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic14
found an increase in desire for social distance from people with
mental illness between March 2020 and March 2022, together
with a decline in other measures designed to capture aspects of
mental health literacy.15

Study aims

We therefore investigated the extent to which the changes reported
from 2008 to 2019 were sustained by 2023, 2 years after the end of
Time to Change in England. We also wished to address a limitation
of the measures, which enquire about mental illness or mental
health problems in general, since research in other countries has

1

Ronaldson and Henderson

shown differential changes over time in desire for social distance for
depression versus schizophrenia.16 Most recently, research in the
USA suggests decreased desire for social distance from people
with depression between 2006 and 2018, but a possible slight
increase regarding people with schizophrenia, along with increased
perception of dangerousness.17 In the UK, different patterns of
change in newspaper coverage between schizophrenia and other
disorders have been observed suggesting a relative lack of improve-
ment in coverage about people with schizophrenia.18 Therefore, we
also compared attitudes and desire for social distance toward people
with depression and schizophrenia in 2023 with those available
from other time points during Time to Change, by repeating mea-
sures used in the 2007 and 2015 British Social Attitudes Survey
(BSAS).19

Method

Data source

The AMI was carried out annually in England from 2008 to 2017,
every 2 years since 2017 by Kantar TNS, and previously intermit-
tently from 1994. Approximately 1700 respondents take part. A
quota sampling frame is used to ensure a nationally representative
sample of adults (16 years or older) living in England who could
be exposed to the Time to Change campaign, and respondents are
not resampled in later surveys. Detailed information about sampling
methods20 can be obtained via the authors. Until 2019, respondents
were interviewed face to face at home, by trained personnel. Since
then, data have been collected using address-based online surveying
(https://www.kantar.com/-/media/Project/Kantar/Global/Expertise/
Policy-and-Society/Address-Based-Online-Surveying.PDF), which
offers web or paper self-completion. Measures of stigma-related
knowledge and desire for social distance were added in 2009, just
before the Time to Change social marketing campaign launched;
therefore, the baseline for attitudes is 2008, and for the other out-
comes is 2009. A detailed timeline of the AMI and the Time to
Change campaign is provided in Fig. 1.

Measures

Stigma-related knowledge

Stigma-related knowledge was measured with the first six items of
the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS),21 covering help-
seeking, recognition, support, employment, treatment and recovery
(e.g. ‘Most people with mental health problems want to have paid
employment’). The standardised total score was used. These items
were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 5
(strong agreement), with higher scores indicating greater knowl-
edge. The Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale in the current study
was 0.59. This relatively low internal consistency has been reported
previously,9 and likely reflects the different knowledge domains
measured by each item.21

Attitudes to mental illness

Attitudes to mental illness were measured with 26 of the 40 items of
the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill scale (CAMI),22
plus an item on employment-related attitudes added when the
UK Department of Health first commissioned the survey in
1994.8 The CAMI has two factors: ‘Prejudice and Exclusion’ (e.g.
‘One of the main causes of mental illness is a lack of self- discipline
and willpower’) and ‘Tolerance and Support for Community Care’
(e.g. ‘We need to adopt a far more tolerant attitude toward people
with mental illness in our society’).23 All items were rated on a
scale ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 5 (strong agreement).
‘Prejudice and
The standardised scores of

the total CAMI,

Exclusion’ and ‘Tolerance and Support for Community Care’ sub-
scales were used. Higher scores indicate less stigmatising attitudes
to mental illness. The internal consistency of the CAMI in this
data-set was 0.87 (Cronbach’s alpha) for the total scale, and 0.85
and 0.76 for ‘Prejudice and Exclusion’ and ‘Tolerance and
Support for Community Care’, respectively.

Desire for social distance

Desire for social distance was measured with the four items of the
Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS),24 which constitute
the Intended Behaviour subscale and assess desire for social distance
in terms of living with, working with, living nearby and continuing a
relationship with someone with a mental illness. These items were
rated on a scale ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 5 (strong
agreement), with higher scores indicating less desire for social dis-
tance. The total score was standardised. The internal consistency
of the four items was 0.84 (Cronbach’s alpha).

Measures from the BSAS 2007 and 2015

For the first time in the AMI, we included items used in the 2007 and
2015 BSAS conducted by the National Centre for Social Research
(https://natcen.ac.uk/british-social-attitudes). This annual survey is
designed to produce a representative sample of adults aged 18 years
or over, who are living in private households. These data were
accessed directly from the UK Data Service (https://beta.ukdata
service.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200006). We included
BSAS participants living in England who responded to vignettes of
a common mental health problem (depression) and a less common
problem (schizophrenia). This allowed us to compare desire for
social distance between 2007 (BSAS, considered to be baseline),
2015 (BSAS) and 2023 (AMI). Two different people were described,
and respondents were asked how willing they would be to interact
with them in a range of situations (e.g. spend time socialising,
move next door to). In 2007, the survey design randomly allocated
respondents to a depression or schizophrenia vignette. In 2015 and
2023, the entire sample responded. The vignettes were not labelled
‘depression’ or ‘schizophrenia’. People were asked social distance
questions for each vignette about willingness to have the person in
the vignette as a neighbour, to socialise with them, to have them
care for their children, to befriend them, to work with them and to
have them marry someone they know. In 2023 and 2015, participants
responded to these items on a five-point Likert type scale, with 1
being very willing, 2 being fairly willing, 3 being neither willing nor
unwilling, 4 being fairly unwilling and 5 being very unwilling. In
2007, participants responded on a four-point Likert type scale, with
1 being definitely willing, 2 being probably willing, 3 being probably
unwilling and 4 being definitely unwilling. Using BSAS 2015 data, we
also repeated questions assessing expectations of and attitudes toward
workplace discrimination against people with depression and schizo-
phrenia compared with a physical health comparator (diabetes).
Specifically, respondents were asked about the likelihood of people
with these conditions to be promoted, who had had repeated
periods of time off work but whose illness was now under control
through medication, and were asked whether medical history
should make a difference. Attitudes towards workplace discrimin-
ation were not measured in 2007.

Familiarity with someone with a mental health problem

Familiarity with someone with a mental health problem was mea-
sured with the item: ‘Who is the person closest to you who has or
has had some kind of mental illness?’. Responses included self,
immediate family, partner, other family,
friend, acquaintance,
work colleague, other or no-one. The response to this item was cate-
gorised into three groups: self, other or none.

Sociodemographic variables

Several sociodemographic variables were included in the analysis:
age, gender, ethnicity (Asian, Black, Other, White), socioeconomic
position and government office region. Socioeconomic position was
based on the chief income earner of each household, using the
Market Research Society’s classification system (AB, C1, C2, DE).
AB represents professional /managerial occupations, C1 represents
other non-manual occupations, C2 represents skilled manual
occupations and DE represents semi-/unskilled manual occupations
and people dependent on state benefits. Government office region is
the lowest level information on participants’ location as described
by the UK Government’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) (see
Table 1).

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics for participant demographics and crude
outcome scores were calculated and reported by survey year. All
analyses were weighted by age, gender and ethnicity, to reflect popu-
lation characteristics in England. Survey weights were taken from
the ONS. For modelling, the quota sample was treated as a probabil-
ity sample.

We used multiple regression models to evaluate patterns of
change in (a) stigma-related knowledge (MAKS scores), (b) atti-
tudes to mental illness (CAMI scores) and (c) desire for social dis-
tance (RIBS Intended Behaviour score). All models used the
standardised scores of
the measures as dependent variables,
meaning the outputs were interpreted in standard deviation units.
All the models included a fixed effect for year, using a categorical
dummy variable. We used the distributional approach to obtain
estimates for the proportion of the population whose outcomes
changed between two comparative years (i.e. 2023 and baseline,
2023 and 2019).25 This method uses the parameters of the normal
distribution and converts results from linear regression models

into corresponding proportions, using the area under the standard
normal curve. We included covariates to control for differences in
sociodemographic factors: age group, gender, ethnicity, socio-
economic position, familiarity with someone with a mental health
problem (self, other, none) and government office region. The
same analysis has been applied to previous AMI data,9,26–28
except that the government office region variable was not included
during phase 1 of Time to Change.28 Interactions between year and
sociodemographic factors (age group, gender, ethnicity, socio-
economic position, government office region) were tested to see
whether patterns of change in outcomes over time differed by
groups. The interaction terms were added separately to the initial
models and evaluated for statistical significance with a Wald test.

To compare desire for social distance (vignettes) and attitudes
toward workplace discrimination, we merged and harmonised rele-
vant data from the BSAS 2007 and 2015 with data from the AMI
survey 2023. Logistic regression models were used to assess
change between 2007, 2015 and 2023 in willingness to interact
with a person with depression (‘Stephen’) or schizophrenia
(‘Andy’). Data from 2007 acted as the reference. Because of different
response categories in 2007 versus 2015/2023, a binary outcome
variable was created; ‘1’ indicated that someone was fairly (prob-
ably) or very (definitely) willing, and ‘0’ indicated someone was
fairly (probably) or very (definitely) unwilling. Responses that
indicated someone was neither willing nor unwilling were
excluded from this analysis to facilitate comparison across years.
Sociodemographic factors common to both datasets were included
as covariates in the logistic regression models: age group, gender,
ethnicity, socioeconomic position and government office region.

Similarly, logistic regression models were used to assess changes
in attitudes toward workplace discrimination between 2015 and
2023. A binary outcome was created relating to likelihood of promo-
tion for each condition, where ‘1’ indicated that a person would be
just as likely and ‘0’ indicated that they would be slightly or much

Mental illness stigma in England

9.4% improvement in attitudes (P < 0.001). However, between
2019 and 2023, total CAMI scores declined by 3.3% (P = 0.015).
An interaction between year and both age and government region
(adjusted Wald tests P < 0.001) suggests that changes in CAMI
scores over time differ according to these sociodemographic
factors (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 available at https://doi.org/10.
1192/bjo.2024.801). Declines in scores since 2019 are most pro-
nounced in those aged 45–64 years and in those residing in
South-East England.

We also examined changes in CAMI ‘Prejudice and Exclusion’
and ‘Tolerance and Support for Community Care’ subscale scores
(see Supplementary Table 1). Scores over time are presented in
Supplementary Fig. 3. Scores on the ‘Prejudice and Exclusion’ sub-
scale showed continued increases to 2021, but in 2023, scores
returned to 2019 levels, showing only a 0.1% improvement since
that time (P = 0.949). Since 2019, scores on the ‘Tolerance and
Support
subscale decreased by 7.1%
(P < 0.001).

Stigma-related knowledge

Changes in MAKS scores (marginal estimates of the standardised
scores by year) are presented in Fig. 2. Between 2009 and 2019,
there were improvements in MAKS scores (see Table 2). Since
2019, MAKS scores have decreased by 7.8% (P < 0.001) and
results from 2023 no longer differ from 2009 scores (P = 0.153).
Interactions emerged between year and age (P = 0.012), class (P =
0.021) and region (P = 0.010) (see Supplementary Figs 4–6).
Specifically, since 2019, MAKS scores have declined in people
aged under 25 years and aged 45–64 years; in people from the AB
and C2 class groups; and in the North-East, North-West, South-
East and South-West of England.

less likely. A binary outcome was also created relating to whether
someone’s condition should make a difference to likelihood of pro-
motion, with ‘1’ indicating that they definitely/probably should
and ‘0’ indicating that they probably/definitely should not.

All analyses were performed with Stata version 17.0 for

Windows (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA).

Ethics
The King’s College London Psychiatry, Nursing and Midwifery
Research Ethics Subcommittee exempted analysis of these survey
data as secondary analysis of anonymised data.

Results

Sample characteristics

Participant demographics are reported by survey year in Table 1.
Over time, the distribution of male and female participants and
their regional distribution remains stable. Since the introduction
of remote data collection (2021), there have been changes in some
sociodemographic factors: more participants were 45 years or
older, had professional/managerial occupations and had experience
with mental health problems (self and other). In 2021 and 2023,
fewer Black respondents took part.

Attitudes to mental illness

Figure 2 depicts the change over time in total CAMI scores by plot-
ting the marginal estimates of the standardised scores by year. There
have been improvements in total CAMI scores since 2008 (see
Table 2). In 2023, participants scored 0.24 (95% CI 0.16–0.31) s.d.
units higher on the CAMI scale than in 2008, translating to a

Desire for social distance

Figure 2 illustrates the change over time in total RIBS Intended
Behaviour subscale scores (marginal estimates of the standardised
scores). Significant improvements in scores were seen between
2009 and 2019 (Table 2). Since 2019, scores have decreased by
10.2% (P < 0.001) and results from 2023 no longer differ from
2009 scores (P = 0.294). Interactions emerged between year and
socioeconomic position (P = 0.017) and government region (P <
0.001) (see Supplementary Figs 7 and 8). Declines in scores were
seen in the AB and C2 socioeconomic group and in South-East
England since 2019.

Comparison with BSAS 2007 and 2015 data

Sample characteristics for BSAS respondents in England are pro-
vided in Supplementary Table 2 (2007 N = 610, 2015 N = 1865).

Responses to each vignette item for depression and anxiety are pre-
sented in Fig. 3. Gradual increases in willingness to interact with
both Stephen (depression) and Andy (schizophrenia) can be seen
across all domains. Adjusted logistic regressions (Supplementary
Table 3) revealed that these increases were significant for all scen-
arios relating to schizophrenia, and most of the scenarios relating
to depression, with the exception of ‘move next door to Stephen’,
which did not change significantly. In both cases, the most pro-
nounced increases were seen in willingness to ‘have Andy/Stephen
provide childcare for someone in your family’ (depression 2023:
odds ratio 5.39, 95% CI 3.74–7.7; schizophrenia 2023: odds ratio
6.42, 95% CI 4.04–10.20).

In terms of workplace discrimination, proportions of partici-
pant responses from the BSAS in 2015 and the AMI in 2023 are pre-
sented in Supplementary Table 4. Adjusted logistic regressions
(Supplementary Table 5) revealed that, compared with people in

2015, people in 2023 were more likely to agree that people with
depression and schizophrenia are just as likely to be promoted.
This change was most pronounced for schizophrenia (odds ratio
2.47, 95% CI 1.97–3.11). Moreover, people in 2023 were more
likely to agree that having depression or schizophrenia should not
make a difference to likelihood of promotion.

period, and items relating to working and being friends with
people with mental illness increased marginally. Change scores
for the vignettes suggest that there have been considerable increases
in willingness to live, work and be friends with people with mental
illness, particularly in relation to depression.

Exploration of desire for social distance

To explore why we observed both decreases in RIBS Intended
Behaviour subscale scores and greater willingness to have contact
based on the vignettes representing individuals with symptoms of
depression and schizophrenia, we graphically compared items
from the RIBS Intended Behaviour subscale and the vignettes that
tapped into similar aspects of life. As both the RIBS Intended
Behaviour subscale and the 2015 and 2023 vignettes were responded
to on a five-point Likert scale, we could calculate change scores by
subtracting mean responses to each RIBS Intended Behaviour sub-
scale and vignette item in 2015 from responses in 2023 (the 2007
BSAS vignettes could not be included as the four-item response
scale precluded the calculation of change scores). These change
scores are presented in Fig. 4. Results indicate that RIBS Intended
Behaviour subscale items concerning living with or near people
illness decreased or remained the same over this
with mental

Discussion

Our results show a complicated set of changes over time. Consistent
with the surveys undertaken during the course of the Every Mind
Matters campaign from 2019 to 2022,14 the stigma measures
using questions about mental illness or mental health problems
show an increase in stigma over this period following the improve-
ments seen between 2008 and 2019, such that although attitudes are
still more positive since 2008, stigma-related knowledge and desire
for social distance began to decline before the end of Time to
Change and are the same as in 2009. In contrast, the questions
based on vignettes of men with depression or schizophrenia
showed reduced desire for social distance since 2007, which is in
in Australia from 2003/2004 to 2011.29

However, regarding schizophrenia, this contrasts to findings from
2006 to 2018 in the USA, where desire for social distance (measured

Consistent with this, the measure of stigma in relation to mental
illness in general that showed least deterioration is the Prejudice and
Exclusion subscale of the CAMI, which also reflects awareness of
rights and values of non-discrimination. In contrast, the reduction
in the Tolerance and Support for Community Care subscale score
may reflect reduced support for government spending on mental
healthcare at a time when personal taxation as a percentage of
national income is at its highest since 1948.

The decline in stigma-related knowledge since 2019 reveals
more therapeutic pessimism and less confidence in being able to
help those with mental illness. This may reflect the greater difficul-
ties in access to mental healthcare during and since the COVID-19
pandemic, as well as in self-management of mental health resulting
from reduced access to salutogenic processes during lockdowns and
inflation.

The contrast between the negative changes in the RIBS Intended
Behaviour subscale and the positive changes in response to the
vignette questions is harder to explain, as the questions are
similar. One interpretation is that the AMI survey sample report
generally more positive attitudes up to 2019 than those covered
by the BSAS, because of different sampling and/or data collection

methods. However, both the BSAS 2015 and AMI survey up to
2019 were conducted face to face, a method that may result in
more socially desirable responses.30 Hence, although the more nega-
tive attitudes found in 2021 and 2023 compared with previous AMI
results could be interpreted as resulting from this change in
methods, this does not explain the positive change seen between
face-to-face responses to the depression and schizophrenia vignettes
in 2015 and online responses to the same questions in 2023. Further,
the increase in desire for social distance measures on the RIBS
Intended Behaviour subscale after March 2020 during the evalu-
ation of Every Mind Matters was observed with an online survey
throughout.

We should therefore consider whether there has been a change
in how people respond to vignettes about individuals, such that less
desire for social distance is expressed, whereas the RIBS Intended
illness in general
Behaviour subscale questions about mental
among groups of people elicit increasingly negative responses
since 2019. The former may reflect a more lasting impact of Time
to Change, which promoted supportive contact with family,
friends and colleagues experiencing a mental health problem;31
vignettes about an individual that use their first name create a
sense of familiarity, which may generate more empathy. Further,
although causality was not directly addressed during the pro-
gramme, the messaging during Time to Change that anyone can
experience mental health problems may have affected beliefs
about heritability, and hence the question about someone with
mental illness marrying into the family that was linked to the
vignette. The responses to the RIBS Intended Behaviour subscale
may reflect a greater desire to avoid others who are unknown,
which is consistent with the decline in support for community-

based care. Although fear of contagion may have influenced
responses in 2021,
this seems less likely for 2023. However,
responses to the RIBS Intended Behaviour subscale might be
more affected than the vignette questions, and for longer, by person-
ality changes among adults identified later during the pandemic.
These include reductions in agreeableness and conscientiousness,
although these data are from the USA.32 In summary, the contrast-
ing changes in direction may reflect the fact that vignettes versus
questions about contact without vignettes capture different
aspects of stigma – that against known individuals versus that
toward groups of unknown people.

Strengths and limitations

A.R. conducted the data analysis and created the tables and figures. A.R. and C.H. drafted and
reviewed the manuscript.

We calculated sampling errors even though a quota sample was
used, which violates some statistical assumptions but allowed us
to calculate results as if the data were from a probability sample.
Although probability sampling has been used to measure single
aspects of stigma in England at one time point,19,23 no current epi-
demiological survey has allowed repeated assessment of multiple
aspects of stigma. Further, the lack of data for the BSAS items in
2019 means we cannot ascertain whether these attitudes have also
worsened since 2019, after
improving further after 2015.
However, the analysis used nationally representative datasets and
the demographic associations for attitudes are consistent with
those found using the Health Survey for England 2014 data.23,33
Although the patterns seen in the data make it plausible that
changes in mental health stigma can be somewhat attributed to
the Time to Change campaign, definitive causality cannot be estab-
lished. Although we included a significant number of confounders
in our analyses, it is possible there were unmeasured confounders
that may bias our results. A change in data collection method (i.e.
face to face up to 2019, followed by paper- and web-based comple-
tion in 2021 and 2023) may partially explain increases in stigma
seen from 2021 resulting from reduced likelihood of socially desir-
able responses. However, positive change (e.g. responses to vign-
ettes, workplace attitudes) alongside the increases in stigma
indicates that the change in data collection method probably did
not significantly affect results. A further limitation concerns the
use of mental health vignettes, which may not fully represent real-
world scenarios. However, these vignettes were based on established
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) cri-
teria, and therefore accurately reflect the main symptoms of the
mental health conditions they depict.

Implications

Our results reinforce the multifaceted nature of mental illness-
related stigma and the importance of measuring them, including
in relation to common versus less common disorders, discrimin-
ation where legislation is relevant and intended interpersonal
behaviour with versus without vignettes of named individuals. We
predict that the aspects of stigma that worsened since 2019 will
improve if and when economic conditions and access to treatment
for common mental disorders improve. However, it remains to be
seen whether the improvements seen over the course of Time to
Change can be regained in the absence of such a programme.
