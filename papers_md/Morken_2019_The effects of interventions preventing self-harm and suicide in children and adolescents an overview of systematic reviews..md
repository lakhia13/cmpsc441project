Abstract
Background: 
serious consequence and increase during the adolescent years.
Consequently, there is need for interventions that prevent such behaviour.
The objective of this paper: to evaluate the effects of interventions
preventing self-harm and suicide in children and adolescents in an
overview of systematic reviews.
Methods:
included reviews evaluating any preventive or therapeutic intervention. The
methodological quality of the included reviews was assessed
independently, and data was extracted by two reviewers. We report the
review findings descriptively. The certainty of evidence was assessed using
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE).
Moderate certainty evidence suggests that school-based
Results: 
interventions prevent suicidal ideation and attempts short term, and
possibly suicide attempts long term. The effects of community-based
interventions following suicide clusters and local suicide plans are
unknown, as are the benefits and harms of screening young people for
suicide risk.
The effects of most interventions targeting children and adolescents with
known self-harm are unknown. However, low certainty evidence suggests
that dialectical behavioural therapy and developmental group therapy are
equally as effective on repetition of self-harm as enhanced treatment as
usual.
Conclusions: 
suicide plans, prevention of suicide clusters and approaches to risk
assessment, is lacking. When such interventions are implemented, the
effects should be closely evaluated. There is also need for more research
on treatment of repeated self-harm. Further research should include long
term follow-up, and investigate possible adverse effects.
In prevention of self-harm and suicide in children and adolescents, policy
makers and health providers should consider evidence from
population-based studies with mixed-age samples, adult samples, and
studies on conditions associated with self-harm and/or suicidality, such as

  Amendments from Version 1

We wish to thank the reviewers for valuable comments on the 
manuscript. The main differences compared with the previous 
version are:

•      We describe the reason for the five-year cut-off in our search 
for systematic reviews. This cut-off is pragmatic but similarly 
practiced by others, e.g. the Cochrane Library (https://community.
cochrane.org/editorial-and-publishing-policy-resource/cochrane-
review-development/cochrane-review-updates), in considering 
that older reviews are in need of being updated. It takes time 
before a review is published, and it may be published one to 
three years after the search for primary studies. Thus, a review 
published earlier than 2012 may not include primary studies 
published the last >10 years. This has improved with time and 
new publication standards for reviews. 

•      We have made it explicit that the search-words are included 
in the IN SUM Search Strategy (extended data, reference 25) 
and that we screened providing all the references in IN SUM. We 
also provide examples of search words. IN SUM is a database of 
systematic reviews on effects of child mental health and welfare 
interventions from the following databases: Cochrane Database 
of Systematic Reviews, Campbell Library, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, 
Embase, Web of Science, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of 
Effects (DARE) and Evidence Based Mental Health. 

•      We have tried to make the introduction and discussion more 
coherent and on point about the main message, and we comment 
the implications of TAU versus other active intervention control 
groups.

•      We have added information on the importance of biological 
factors and bereavement as risk factors in the introduction and 
the summary.

•      We have added information about why including reviews 
in English, Norwegian, Danish or Swedish: we have included 
languages available to us, and guidelines developed in Sweden, 
Denmark and UK carry out extensive evidence reviews. 

•     We describe more carefully the most relevant limitations/
shortcomings of the present study.

Introduction
Self-harm 
intentional  self-poisoning  or  self-injury,  
irrespective of type of motive or the extent of suicidal intent1,2. It 
is  often  a  coping  mechanism  used  to  solve  a  difficult  situation,  
and  can  serve  functions  such  as  affect  regulation,  communicat-
ing  the  extent  of  pain,  or  self-punishment3.  While  self-harm  is  
rare  in  children  younger  than  12  years4,  it  is  prevalent  amongst 
adolescents5:  across  international  studies,  18%  between  the 
ages  of  12  and  18  report  a  history  of  one  or  several  episodes 
of  intentional  self-harm.  Prevalence  is  highest  amongst  ado-
lescent  girls,  typically  done  by  cutting,  but  self-harm  is  also 
a  problem  amongst  boys,  more  often  hitting  themselves6,7.  It 
may  be  temporary  or  more  long-lasting  in  nature6,  and  one  
episode  of  self-harm  is  a  strong  predictor  of  repetition8,9. 
When  repeated,  the  person  often  advances  to  a  combination  of  
different  methods,  increasing  the  medical  severity10.  Completed 
suicide  is  on  the  other  hand  defined  as  the  act  of  intentionally

ending  one’s  own  life11.  Suicide  is  rare  before  the  age  of  15  but 
increases  in  prevalence  through  adolescence5,  and  is  somewhat  
most  prevalent  amongst  males12.  It  is  the  most  common  cause  of 
death  in  female  adolescents,  and  the  third  most  common  cause 
of  death  in  male  adolescents  (after  road-traffic  accidence  and  
violence)5.  Self-harm  and  suicide  result  from  underlying  risk-  
and  maitaining  factors,  spanning  from  other  mental  health  prob-
lems such as depression, biological factors, exposure to traumatic  
events  or  other  difficult  circumstances  in  the  young  person’s  
environment4,13.  Furthermore,  there  are  repercussions  to  being 
exposed  to  family  and/or  friends’  self-harm  and  suicide.  Such 
exposure may contribute to self-harm and suicide in adolescents, a  
phenomenon  referred  to  as  “social  contagion”4.  Related,  the 
bereavement  process  of  survivors  after  losing  a  significant 
other  may  last  a  long  time  and  increase  the  risk  of  suicide14  and  
suicidal thoughts15.

Evidently,  self-harm  and  suicide  in  children  and  adolescents 
are  complex  and  multifaceted  phenomena.  As  prevention  likely  
warrants  a  variation  of  measures,  clinicians  and  policy  makers 
types  
are 
of preventive interventions.

the  effects  of  different 

in  need  of  knowledge 

There  are  several  reviews  with  summarized  evidence  on  effects 
of  interventions  aimed  at  preventing  (re)occurance  of  self-harm  
and  suicide.  However,  many  reviews  are  of  variable  qual-
ity,  or  outdated16–21.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  large  overlap  of 
interventions  covered  in  the  different  reviews,  making  it  dif-
ficult  for  professionals  to  sort  out  the  best  available  evidence 
needed  to  make  informed  decisions22.  Consequently,  we  wanted 
to  provide  an  up-to-date  overview  of  the  best  quality  summa-
rized  evidence  on  effects  of  all  types  of  interventions  aimed  at  
preventing self-harm and suicide.

Objective
The  objective  of  this  review  is  to  summarize  the  effects  of  
interventions  aimed  at  preventing  self-harm  and  suicide  in  
children and adolescents.

Methods
This  review  was  registered  with  the  international  prospective  
register  of  systematic  reviews  (PROSPERO;  CRD42019117942) 
on February 8 2019.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We  included  systematic  reviews  published  in  2012  and  later  
(last  date

DARE-criteria23. This five-year cut-off is pragmatic in considering 
that  older  reviews  are  no  longer  a  reliable  basis  for  updated  
evidence. A  review  published  earlier  than  2012  may  not  include 
primary  studies  published  the  last  >10  years.  Furthermore,  to

presented in Box 1.

Population:

Intervention:

Children and adolescents under 18 with 
or without an identified risk of developing 
problems involving self-harm and/or suicide, 
or those who have already developed these 
problems.

Any intervention aimed at preventing or 
reducing self-harm and suicide, including 
psychological therapy, pharmaceutical 
interventions, psychosocial interventions, 
physical activity or nutrition.

Control:

Other relevant interventions, treatment as usual 
(TAU) or wait list.

Outcome:

All outcomes evaluated in children and youth, 
including (but not restricted to) self-harm, 
completed suicide, other health outcomes, 
quality of life, function, use of health care, 
attitudes and unwanted effects of 
interventions.

We excluded systematic reviews that did not meet the criteria for 
the above-mentioned PICO:

•  Children  and  adolescents  with  other  main-diagnosis,  e.g.  
children  admitted  to  hospitals  because  of  somatic  illness  at  the  
same time as experiencing depressive symptoms.

•  Interventions  with  the  main  objective  to  prevent  other  mental 
health problems, such as depression.

•  Interventions  preventing  other  behaviours  with  no  direct  
association  with  mental  health,  e.g. 
targeting  
smoking cessation.

colleague  KTH).  Supplementing  the  references  found  in  IN  
SUM,  we  also  hand-searched  for  relevant  systematic  reviews,  in  
the following databases and organizations:

• The Norwegian Institute of Public Health

•  The  Swedish  agency  for  health  technology  assessment  and  
assessment of social services (SBU)

• The Norwegian Directorate of Health

• The Danish Health Authority

• The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

All  publications  judged  to  meet  the  inclusion  criteria  were  
retrieved  in  full  text.  Two  researchers  (ISM,  AA)  independently 
screened and assessed all full text reviews for potential inclusion. 
In cases of disagreement, we consulted a third person.

Assessment of overlap between reviews and methodological 
quality
We  sorted  all  included  reviews  by  population  and  intervention 
comparisons  (the  PICOs).  In  cases  were  more  than  one  review  
addressed  the  same  comparison  for  the  same  population,  we 
included  the  review  with  the  newest  search  date  (and  complete-
ness  of  this  search  by  considering  the  included  primary  studies) 
and  the  best  quality.  In  considering  overlap,  the  first  author  
(ISM)  extracted  this  information  from  the  reviews,  and  the  
second  author  (AA)  double-checked  the  information.  Further, 
we  assessed  the  methodological  quality  of  the  included  reviews 
based  on  a  checklist  for  systematic  reviews  (AMSTAR:  A  
to  Assess  systematic  Reviews)27.  Two

review was conducted to inform decision-making in Norway, and 
for this purpose only direct comparisons between pharmaceutical 
treatments were judged to be relevant.

The  final  decision  on  which  reviews  to  include  was  done  
through  agreement  between  two  of  the  authors  (ISM  and 
AA).  Table  1  contains  documentation  on  characteristics  of  the  
included reviews, including methodological quality.

Literature search
The  literature  search  for  this  review  was  completed  in  August 
2018  and  is  largely  based  on  IN  SUM:  a  database  of  system-
atic  reviews  on  effects  of  child  mental  health  and  welfare  
interventions24.  We  reviewed  all  references 
in  IN 
SUM.  IN  SUM  indexes  reviews  related  to  children’s  and  young  
people’s  mental  health  from  the  following  databases:  Cochrane 
Database  of  Systematic  Reviews,  Campbell  Library,  PsycINFO, 
MEDLINE,  Embase,  Web  of  Science,  Database  of  Abstracts  of 
Reviews  of  Effects  (DARE)  and  Evidence  Based  Mental  Health

indexed 

The  present  overview  of  systematic  reviews  was  developed 
following  the  principles  of  the  Cochrane  handbook26.  Two  
researchers  independently  reviewed  all  publications  indexed 
in  IN  SUM  (two  of  the  authors:  AD  or  ISM,  and/or  a  research  

Data extraction and analyses
ISM extracted data from the systematic reviews and AA checked 
its  accuracy.  As  this  was  an  overview  of  systematic  reviews, 
we  extracted  information  as  it  was  reported  in  the  systematic  
reviews,  including  any  supplementary  tables  or  appendixes.  We 
did not retrieve primary studies to provide additional information  
about interventions or results.

From  the  systematic  reviews,  we  extracted  information  about 
the  primary  studies’  populations,  characteristics  of  the  inter-
ventions  and  comparison  groups,  duration  of  the  interventions,  
follow-up  periods,  outcome  measures  and  pooled  effect  
estimates  for  each  outcome.  In  cases  were  the  effect  estimates  
were  not  pooled  in  a  meta-analysis,  we  reported  the  results  of  
each individual study for each outcome. 

We  did  not  attempt  any  reanalysis,  but  present  results  as 
reported 
including 
studies  on  both  children/adolescents  and  adult  populations,

references,  we  excluded  1242  based  on  title  or  summary,  mainly  
because  they  focused  on  other  diagnosis  or  problem-areas  than  
self-harm  and/or  suicide.  Overall,  29  full  texts  were  retrieved,  
12  were  excluded  because  they  did  not  fulfil  the  inclusion  
criteria.  Out  of  18  potentially  included  reviews,  9  were  excluded 
because of overlap (see Table 2 for excluded studies).

Figure  1  describes  the  search-process  and  the  number  of  
articles  excluded  in  each  step.  Eight  systematic  reviews1,16,17,29–33,  
including  summary  of  new  evidence  of  two  of  them34,35,  were  
consequently  included  in  the  analysis.  One  review  was  identi-
fied  after  we  had  completed  the  analysis36  and  is  therefore  not  
included in the present review of systematic reviews.

Although  the  initial  cut-off  for  age  in  our  population  was  18, 
two  of  the  reviews  included  studies  with  young  people  up  to  
2429,30.  These  were  included  because  the  upper  age  limit  used  to 
define  adolescence  in  research  on  self-harm  and  suicides  varies 
between 18 and 255.

Assessment of quality of systematic reviews
The  eight  included  systematic  reviews1,16,17,29–35  were  assessed 
for  quality  (see  Table  1).  Overall,  the  reviews  were  of  high  
methodological  quality,  even  though  some  of  the  reviews  lacked 
a  priori  design,  systematic  searches  for  grey  literature  and  
assessment  of  publication  bias.  We  appraised  three  systematic 
reviews17,30,33  with AMSTAR-scores  in  the  range  of  6–8,  and  the 
remaining  five1,16,29–32,34,35  with  AMSTAR-scores  in  the  range  of 
9–11.

Description of interventions
The  reviews  included  a  broad  range  of  interventions.  Most  of 
the  studies  included  adolescent  populations  in  the  age-range 
12  to  18,  with  some  exceptions  of  samples  including  younger  
children or young adults up to the age of 24. Preventive interven-
tions  were  either  focused  on  primary  prevention  for  mixed-age  
population  based  samples  (suicide  awareness  campaigns  and  
other  school-based  prevention  programs,  screening  for  suicide  
risk)  or  secondary  prevention  (local  approaches  following

Summary of findings
The  effects  of  interventions  are  presented  by  type  population 
(young  people  with  or  without  an  identified  risk,  or  with  
existing  self-harm,  e.g.  a  history  of  at  least  one  episode  of  
self-harm)  and  by  treatment  comparison.  Our  assessment  of  
in  
certainty  of  evidence  corresponds 
Table  3–Table  16.  For  comparisons  with  many  outcomes,  we  
report  the  main  outcomes  in  the  present  results  section.  See  
GRADE-assessments  in  Table  3–Table  16  for  the  remaining  
outcomes.

to  GRADE-tables 

The  review  authors  also  searched  for  research  on  effects  of  the 
following  interventions  (versus  treatment  as  usual  (TAU)  or  
alternative  interventions),  but  studies  on  children  and  adoles-
cents under the age of 18 were not identified. These were primary  
and  secondary  preventive  interventions  (reducing  access  to  
means,  local  suicide  plans,  local  media  reporting  of  suicides  in 
newspapers,  Internet  or  other  digital  channels,  suicide  prevention  
in  residential  custodial  and  detention  settings)29  and  interven-
tions  targeting  existing  self-harm  (assessment  in  children  and  
adolescents  at 
the  emergency  department,  psychoeducation, 
pharmacological  treatment  or  a  combination  of  pharmacological 
treatment  and  psychotherapy,  nutrition,  other  psychotherapeu-
tic  approaches  such  as  problem-solving  therapy,  psychodynamic 
therapy,  multi-systemic  therapy,  supportive  therapy,  or  other  
psychosocial  approaches  such  as  counselling,  self-management, 
respite care, assertive outreach)1,31–35.

Preventive interventions
School-based 
suicide  prevention  programs  versus  TAU,  
alternative  interventions,  wait  list  or  no  intervention.  The  
evidence  includes  13  studies  with  <337  221  children  and  adoles-
cents aged 10 to 23, as well as personnel in different local arenas  
working  with  young  people17,29.  In  one  of  the  studies,  the  
participants  (n=320  500)  were  habitants  in  a  county  in  which 
county-based  prevention  programs  were  implemented.  These  
participants  included  school  students  and  personnel  in  schools 
local  arenas.  School-based  prevention  programs  
and  other 
probably  reduce  suicidal  ideation  (RR  0.67,  95%  KI  0.48  to  
)  and  suicide  attempts  (RR 
0.93,  moderate  certainty
0.53, 95% KI 0.36 to 0.80, moderate certainty
) at three  
three  studies  
to  12  months.  Regarding  suicide  attempts, 
conclude  accordingly  at  six-  and  12-month  follow-up  period. 
This  effect  possibly  holds  at  ≥two-  and  15-year  follow-up  (low  
certainty
).  Further,  school-based  interventions  possibly 
reduce  the  rate  of  completed  suicides  at  three-year  follow-up

of  therapeutic  assessment  is  of  very  low  certainty
.  See  
Table 8.

Interventions  for  existing  self-harm:  dialectical  behaviour 
therapy  (DBT-A)  versus  TAU  or  enhanced  TAU.  The  evidence  
includes  two  studies  with  106  adolescents  between  the  age 
of  12  and  19  years  old  with  a  history  of  multiple  episodes  
self-harm31,34.  Length  of  treatment  was  19  weeks.  Follow-up  
period  was  16  weeks  and  six  months.  Based  on  the  available  
evidence,  DBT-A  has  little  or  no  additional  effect  on  repetition 
or  frequency  of  self-harm  (OR  0.72,  95%  KI  0.12  to  4.40,  low 
)  compared  to  (enhanced)  treatment  as  usual.

Interventions  for  existing  self-harm:  developmental  group  
therapy  versus  TAU.  The  evidence  contains 
three  studies 
with  487  adolescents,  12  to  17-year  olds,  referred  to  child  and  
adolescent services following an episode of intentional self-injury 
or  self-poisoning,  irrespective  of  intent31.  The  acute  treatment  
phase  was  six  weekly  sessions,  followed  by  weekly  or  biweekly 
booster  sessions  for  as  long  as  required.  Follow-up  period  was 
between  six  and  12  months.  Based  on  the  available  evidence, 
the  effects  of  developmental  group  therapy  compared  to  TAU 
are  uncertain  on  the  following  outcomes:  repetition  of  self-harm  
(six  months:  OR  1.72  95%  KI  0.56-5.24,  12  months:  OR

95%  KI  -2.76  to  3.55,  12  months:  MD  -0.93  95%  KI  -4.03  to

The  present  paper  gives  a  comprehensive  overview  of  effects 
of  interventions  aimed  at  preventing  self-harm  and  suicide  in  
children  and  adolescents.  We  found  evidence  to  suggest  that  
school-based  interventions  probably  prevent  suicidal  ideation 
and suicide attempts short term, and possibly suicide attempts long 
term.  The  effects  of  community-based  interventions  following  
suicide  clusters  and  local  suicide  plans  are  unknown,  as  are

the  benefits  and  harms  of  screening  young  people  for  suicide  
risk.  The  effects  of  most  interventions  targeting  children  and  
adolescents  with  known  self-harm  are  also  unknown.  However,  
low  certainty  evidence  suggests  that  dialectical  behavioural  
therapy  and  developmental  group 
therapy  are  equally  as  
effective  on  repetition  of  self-harm  as  enhanced  treatment  as  
usual. In general, the populations are adolescents in the age-range 
of 12 to 18 years.

Effects of preventive interventions: summary of findings 
and implications
Based  on  the  available  research,  school-based  interventions 
can  prevent  suicidal  ideation  and  suicide  attempts  short  term  
(moderate  certainty  evidence),  and  possibly  suicide  attempts 
long  term  (low  certainty  evidence),  which  should  have  obvious  
implications for policy makers.

As  regards  other  preventive  strategies,  there  is  a  general  a 
lack  of  research  on  effects  of  recommended  practices,  such  as  
approaches  to  risk  assessment  and  local  suicide  plans.  Screen-
ing  for  suicide  risk  as  primary  prevention  may  provide  the  

opportunity  of  early  detection,  and  if  precise,  offer  the  opportu-
nity  to  provide  young  people  at  risk  with  appropriate  treatment.  
However,  it  is  resource  demanding,  and  based  on  available  
research,  effects  of  screening  children  and  young  people  for 
symptoms  of  depression  and  a  history  of  self-harm  or  suicidal  
ideation  in  the  general  population  are  unknown,  given  very  low  
certainty  evidence.  Local  suicide  plans  are  a  recommended  
strategy  in  some  countries29,37.  However,  the  effects  of  such 
plans  on  preventing  self-harm  and  suicide  in  children  and  
young  people  is  yet  to  be  evaluated  in  research. Therefore,  when  
implemented,  approaches  to  risk  assessment  and  screening  
programs,  as  well  as  local  suicide  plans,  should  be  closely  
evaluated.

We  identified  no  reviews  evaluating  the  effects  of  reducing  
access  to  means  from  children  and  young  people  specifically, 
or  on  how  media  reporting  of  suicides  affects  suicide  rates  in  
children  and  young  people.  In  these  instances,  studies  on  inter-

are  associated  with  an  increase  in  suicides29.  Guidelines  on  
how  to  report  on  suicides  is  one  suggested  strategy  to  address  
the possible harms of such reporting29.

Suicide  clusters,  although  rare,  is  a  phenomenon  of  major  
concern.  When  faced  with  potential  social  contagion  following 
suicide,  communities  are  expected  to  act  to  prevent  con-
taigon  and  clustering.  However,  based  on  a  few  studies,  
the  certainty  of  evidence  for  community-based  interventions  fol-
lowing  suicide  clusters  is  very  low,  as  is  the  evidence  on  effects 
of  support-interventions  in  young  people  bereaved  or  affected 
by  a  suicide  in  their  family  or  other  network.  Even  so,  some  
recommendations  are  agreed  upon,  e.g.  provision  of  informa-
tion  to  relevant  agencies  in  the  community  and  providing  sup-
port  for  those  directly  affected  or  other  vulnerable  individuals38. 
However,  given  that  the  above-mentioned  research  is  of  very  
low  certainty,  we  suggest  that  researchers  design  appropri-
ate  observational  studies,  allowing  for  enough  observations 

pre-  and  post-implementation  of  preventive  measures  to  inform  
policy.

The  reviews  we  identified  also  searched  for  studies  targeting  
young  people  in  residential  custodial  and  detention  settings,  
but no studies were identified. Therefore, effects of interventions in 
this high-risk population are uncertain.

Effects of interventions for existing self-harm: summary of 
findings and implications
Self-harm  is  a  common  reason  for  referral  of  adolescents  in  
child  and  adolescent  psychiatric  services,  and  often  accom-
panies  other  psychiatric  symptoms  presented  in  such  settings.  
However,  based  on  the  available  evidence,  only  two  treatment  
evaluating 
comparisons 
provided  
evidence  of 
their  effectiveness  (low  certainty);  dialectical  
behavioural  therapy  and  developmental  group  therapy.  Both  
treatments  were  compared  to  enhanced  TAU  (e.g.  individual

For  remaining  interventions  targeting  self-harm,  effects  are

implications  

The  evidence  of  effects  of  organization  of  services,  such  as  
home-based  treatment  and  use  of  emergency  green  cards,  is  of  
very  low  certainty.  New  research  in  this  area  is  pertinent,  
especially for policy makers.

Limitations
A  limitation  of  overviews  of  reviews,  and  consequently  of  the 
present paper, is that the analyses are based on secondary report-
ing  of  what  the  review  authors  interpreted  and  reported  based 
on  the  primary  studies.  It  follows  that  the  primary  studies  may 
have  provided  more  information  than  what  is  reported  in  the  
reviews  we  included.  A  primary  study  investigating  e.g.  treat-
ment  attendance  would  be  relevant  to  a  clinician  wanting  to 
meet  with  a  client  struggling  with  suicidality  regularily  in  order 
to  build  a  working  alliance.  However,  if  the  review  authors  did 
not  find  such  an  outcome  from  a  primary  study  relevant,  we  
will  have  missed  this  information.  Regardless  of  this  limita-
tion,  the  reader  of  our  overview  of  reviews  could  find  a  par-
ticular  primary  study  referenced  in  the  included  review,  if  
there is need to check if the primary study investigated other rel-
evant outcomes.

It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the  present  paper  only  included 
reviews  of  studies  where  the  intervention  was  to  prevent  or  treat 
self-harm  and  suicide  in  children  and  adolescents,  with  excep-
tion  of  a  few  population-based  studies.  Self-harm  and  suicide  
are  associated  with  other  difficulties  such  as  psychosis,  depres-
sion  and  anxiety.  Therefore,  evidence  from  studies  on  chil-
dren  and  adolescents  at  risk  for  or  diagnosed  with  such  condi-
tions  may  provide  important  direction  in  decision-making  when  
faces  with  self-harm  and  suicide.  However,  in  studies  on 
these  conditions,  self-harm  and  suicide  are  rarely 
inves-
tigated  as  outcomes39–41.  An  exception

plus psychotherapy) may lead to a reduced risk for suicide40.

is 

Conclusions
Overall,  evidence  of  moderate  to  low  certainty  suggests  that  
school-based  suicide  prevention  programs  can  prevent  suicide 
and suicide attempts in young people. The effects of community- 
based  interventions  following  suicide  clusters  and  local  suicide 
plans  are  uncertain.  Furthermore,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  any 
conclusions  about  the  benefits  or  harms  of  screening  in  young  
people with or without known risk of self-harm and suicide.

When  it  comes  to  treatment  strategies  for  young  people  with 
existing  self-harm,  evidence  of  low  certainty  suggests  that  
dialectical  behavioural  therapy  and  developmental  group  therapy 
are  equally  as  effective  on  repetition  of  self-harm  as  enhanced 
treatment  as  usual  (often  individual  and/or  family  psychother-
apy).  The  effects  of  other  interventions  specifically  targeting  
self-harm  are  unknown,  because  of  lack  of  research  or  evi-
dence  of  very 
low  certainty,  and  should  be  evaluated.  
These  interventions  include  mentalization-based  psychotherapy, 
cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic therapy.

F1000Research 2020, 8:890 Last updated: 25 FEB 2020

Collectively, due to a general lack of research, and in some cases 
very  low  certainty  evidence,  the  effects  of  most  interventions  are  
unknown.  This  has  several  implications.  First  and  foremost,  
more  research  is  needed,  including  studies  on  children  younger 
than  12  years  og  age,  as  well  as  long-term  follow  up.  Second, 
when implementing recommended practice with unknown effects,  
such  as  approaches  to  risk  assessment,  practice  should  be  
closely  evaluated.  With  all  types  of  interventions,  there  is  a  
possibility  for  adverse  effects.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  be  mindful  
that  our  own  preventive  actions  or  treatment  efforts  could  
contribute  to  an  increased  risk  for  self-harm  and  suicide,  and 
both  adverse  as  well  as  beneficial  effects  should  be  evaluated.  
Third,  policy  makers  and  health  providers  should  consider  
in  decision-mak-
evidence  from  other  relevant  populations 
ing,  such  as  studies  on  adults,  as  well  as  studies  on  conditions  
associated  with  self-harm  and/or  suicidality,  e.g.  depression  and  
psychosis.

A  final  implication  worth  mentioning  is  related  to  the  scope  
of  the  present  review  of  systematic  reviews:  effects  of  interven-
tions.  In  decision-making,  knowledge  on  effects  of  interven-
tions  should  be  supplemented  with  other  relevant  research,  such  
as  therapeutic  processes  influencing  the  outcome,  as  well  as  
integrated  with  clinical  expertise  and  the  child’s  or  adolescent’s  
and caregiver’s values and preferences42,43.

Thank you very much for asking me to review the present manuscript.

This is, in summary, an interesting paper aimed to evaluate the effects of interventions preventing
self-harm and suicide in children and adolescents in an overview of systematic reviews. The authors
reported that (moderate certainty evidence) school-based interventions prevent suicidal ideation and
attempts short term, and possibly with long term effects on suicide attempts. Overall, the effects of
community-based interventions following suicide clusters and local suicide plans resulted uncertain, as
are the benefits and harms of screening young people for suicide risk. In addition, the effects of most
interventions targeting children and adolescents with known self-harm were uncertain. They added that
(low certainty evidence) dialectical behavioural therapy and developmental group therapy are equally as
effective on repetition of self-harm as enhanced treatment as usual.

The authors may find as follows my main comments/suggestions:

First, as the authors, throughout the Introduction section, correctly stated that self-harm and suicide are
associated with relevant psychosocial impairment and result from underlying factors such as other mental
health problems, exposure to traumatic events or other difficult circumstances in the young person’s
environment, they might even mention that the emotional turmoil in the case of suicide survivors of
patients died by suicide may last a long time, and in some cases, may end with their own suicide. Thus,
together with self-harm and suicide, it is fundamental to understand the bereavement process after the
suicide of a significant other to provide a proper care, reduce stigma, and improve the outcomes. In
addition, specific biological factors such as prolactin and thyroid hormone levels may be dysregulated and
significantly associated with self-harm and suicide attempts and even involved in a complex
compensatory mechanism to correct reduced central serotonin activity. The assumption that prolactin and
thyroid hormones may be associated or even predict a suicide attempt is of great importance given the
availability of such data in everyday clinical practice. Physicians of any kind as well as mental health
professionals should be aware of the importance to insert as much information possible in the
assessment of suicide and self-harm risk. Thus, given the above mentioned information, the authors
could include throughout the manuscript, some published papers regarding the mentioned topics (PMID:
24082246; 31091772; 28843902; 22748186; 12866334)

12345

.

In addition, why the authors decided to include all publications in English, Norwegian, Danish or Swedish
rather than simply including only studies in English language is a matter of debate and needs to be
specified.

Moreover, the authors should immediately present and discuss, in the first lines of the Discussion section,
their most relevant study findings. Conversely, they seem to focus with redundancy on the main
aims/objectives of the paper which have been already presented elsewhere.

Although the authors reported that the present analyses are based on secondary reporting and the
interpretation of the review authors as well as that the present report included only reviews of studies
where the population was children and young people with existing self-harm, the most relevant
limitations/shortcomings of the present study need to be more carefully described for the general
readership.

Finally, what is the take-home message of this manuscript? While the authors stated that practice should
be evaluated, and researchers should investigate harmful effects as well as beneficial effects of
interventions, they failed, in my opinion, to provide some conclusive remarks about their findings. Here,
some further details/information are needed.

topics (PMID: 24082246; 31091772; 28843902; 22748186; 12866334).

Thank you for interesting suggestions. We have added information and some of the
recommended citations in the introduction regarding the importance of bereavement as a
risk factor in prevention of suicide, as well as in the section on “Effects of preventive
interventions: summary of findings and implications”, and about biological factors as
possible risk factors in the introduction, as well as in “Effects of interventions for existing
self-harm: summary of findings and implications”.

In addition, why the authors decided to include all publications in English, Norwegian, Danish or

2) 
Swedish rather than simply including only studies in English language is a matter of debate and
needs to be specified.

We thank reviewer 2 for pointing this out, and have added information about why choosing
English, Norwegian, Danish or Swedish rather than simply including only studies in English
language. For pragmatic reasons, we have included languages available to us.
Furthermore, guidelines developed in Sweden, Denmark and UK carry out extensive
evidence reviews. Neglecting to include these would weaken the evidence base.

Moreover, the authors should immediately present and discuss, in the first lines of the
3) 
Discussion section, their most relevant study findings. Conversely, they seem to focus with
redundancy on the main aims/objectives of the paper which have been already presented
elsewhere.

We agree, and are now more focused on our main findings in the beginning of the
discussion. 

Although the authors reported that the present analyses are based on secondary reporting and

the interpretation of the review authors as well as that the present report included only reviews of

relevant limitations/shortcomings of the present study need to be more carefully described for the
general readership.

We now described more carefully the most relevant limitations/shortcomings of the present
study, including examples of what we mean, so that the limitations become more apparent.

Finally, what is the take-home message of this manuscript? While the authors stated that
5) 
practice should be evaluated, and researchers should investigate harmful effects as well as

The article evaluates the effects of self-harm and suicide prevention interventions for children and
adolescents. The rationale behind the study is sufficiently supported by different research. The
methodology provided is sufficient except it is unclear why only systematic reviews published in 2012
or later are included. It is also unclear what search terms were used for future replications.

The authors report a range of outcome measures in the results that may not be directly related to
self-harm. Such outcomes (e.g. treatment engagement) were not further commented on or
summarised. Overall, the systematic review is very comprehensive but the discussion and summary could
be more coherent and with a better flow. For instance, the authors can attempt to comment on the
implications of TAU control group versus other active intervention control groups.

Are the rationale for, and objectives of, the Systematic Review clearly stated?
Yes

Are sufficient details of the methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?

Is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Not applicable

Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results presented in the review?

Competing Interests:

self-harm or autism.

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of

·      We thank reviewer 1 for pointing out that this was unclear. This cut-off is pragmatic but similar
to that practiced by others, for example, the Cochrane Library
(https://community.cochrane.org/editorial-and-publishing-policy-resource/cochrane-review-development/cochrane-review-updates),
in considering that an older review is obsolete and no longer a reliable basis for evidence and in
need for being updated. It takes time before a review is published, consequently a review may be
published one to three years later than the search was done for primary studies. This has improved
with time and new publication standards for reviews. Thus, a review published earlier than 2012
may not include primary studies published the last >10 years. A sentence to explain this has now
been added to the manuscript.

2)    

It is also unclear what search terms were used for future replications.

·      The literature search for this review was completed in August 2018 and is largely based on IN
SUM: a database of systematic reviews on effects of child mental health and welfare interventions.
We reviewed all references indexed in IN SUM. IN SUM indexes reviews related to children’s and
young people’s mental health from the following databases: Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews, Campbell Library, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Database of
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Evidence Based Mental Health. A description of IN
SUMs searching strategy is included in extended data. We have now made it explicit that the
search-words are included in the IN SUM Search Strategy (extended data, reference 22), we
provide examples of search words, and we point out that we screened all the references in IN
SUM.

The authors report a range of outcome measures in the results that may not be directly related

3) 
to self-harm. Such outcomes (e.g. treatment engagement) were not further commented on or
summarised. 

·      Thank you for pointing this out, as research on other outcomes are often highly relevant. For
this review we included all outcomes as reported by the review authors. Effect estimates and
judgements of certainty for each such outcome is reported for all pooled estimates. However, in
line with the GRADE recommendations, we only make conclusions on outcomes judged to be of
low, moderate or high certainty. When evidence is of very low certainty, the effects of these
outcomes are considered to be too uncertain as to make any conclusions. 

 Overall, the systematic review is very comprehensive but the discussion and summary could be

4)
more coherent and with a better flow. For instance, the authors can attempt to comment on the
implications of TAU control group versus other active intervention control groups.

·      Thank you for this feedback. We have now tried to make the discussion and summary more
coherent, see introduction, discussion and summary. We have also commented on the

implications of TAU control group versus other active intervention control groups, see “Effects of

I'm not sure if the authors are aware, but our group recently published a systematic review and
meta-analysis of interventions to prevent suicide in young people - available here 
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(18)30041-5/fulltext. 
including this in your review of reviews!

It may be worthwhile
