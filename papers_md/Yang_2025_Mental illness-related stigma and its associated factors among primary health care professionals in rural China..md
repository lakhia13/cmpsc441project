Background: Primary health care professionals (PHCPs) play a key role in the
workforce of community mental health services in rural China. This study aimed
to explore the mental illness-related stigma and its associated factors among
PHCPs in rural communities.

Methods: This study collected the data from 247 PHCPs in 10 township health
service centers in Xinjin District, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China from
November to December 2023. The Mental Illness: Clinicians’ Attitudes (MICA)
was used to assess the mental illness-related stigma. Demographic and stigma-
related psychological scales were compared between PHCPs with and without
mental illness-related stigma. Correlation and binary logistic regression analyses
were performed.

Results: There were 155 PHCPs (62.8%) with mental illness-related stigma, and
the mean score of MICA was 50.68 ± 8.08. PHCPs with mental illness-related
stigma had signiﬁcantly lower mean scores of the Mental Health Knowledge
Schedule (MAKS), the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS), the 5-item
Contact Scale (CQTS), and the 5-item Contact Quality Scale (CQLS) (p=0.001,
p<0.001, P=0.041, P<0.001), and higher mean scores of the Social Distance Scale
(SDS) (p<0.001) than those without mental illness-related stigma. Binary logistic
regression analysis showed that PHCPs’ work experience (b=0.080, 95%
CI=1.002~1.170, p=0.044) and scores of SDS (b=0.169, 95%CI=1.056~1.328,
p=0.004) had signiﬁcantly positive impact on the mental illness-related stigma,
and the scores of MAKS (b=-0.082, 95%CI=0.850~0.998, p=0.045) and RIBS
(b=-0.131, 95%CI=0.783~0.983, p=0.024) had signiﬁcantly negative impact on
the mental illness-related stigma.

illness-related stigma in rural
Conclusions: The PHCPs have severe mental
China, and the associated factors include work experience, mental health
knowledge, behavioral discrimination, and social distance towards people with
mental illness. The results of this study are crucial for development of anti-stigma
intervention among PHCPs in rural communities.

1 Introduction

Stigma, which refers to the shame that individuals feel about
having a disease, as well as negative social attitudes towards illness
(e.g., stereotypes, prejudices, and attitudes) and behaviors towards the
disease (1), is a complex and pervasive phenomenon in the ﬁeld of
mental health (2, 3). Evidence shows that mental illness-related
stigma and discrimination may cause more negative impacts
among persons with mental illness than the mental illness itself (4).
It not only affects patients’ willingness to seek help and treatment but
also aggravates social discrimination against people with mental
illness (5, 6).

In rural China, because of the limited mental health
professional services, primary health care professionals (PHCPs)
(including medical staff, nursing staff, pharmaceutical staff,
technicians, etc.) are an important labor force in community
mental health services (7). Although the government has
increased its investment in the ﬁeld of mental health in recent
years, these investments face multiple challenges in practice,
including economic, cultural and medical resources, PHCPs in
rural areas may have severe mental illness-related stigma (8). In
many rural communities, there may be a lack of understanding and
awareness about mental health issues, leading to misconceptions
(including dangerousness and unpredictability) and discrimination
against those with mental illnesses. PHCPs may not have adequate
training or resources to effectively address the needs of individuals
with severe mental illnesses (9). This will affect the service attitude
and service quality of PHCPs to persons with mental illness and
their families, which is not conducive to the treatment and
rehabilitation of patients (10, 11). Moreover, the notion of
collectivism in China also lead to persons with mental illness
more easily internalize the public stigma against themselves (12).

The mental illness-related stigma among PHCPs demonstrates
signiﬁcant correlations with sociodemographic and psychological
determinants. From a sociodemographic perspective,
the
relationship between age and mental illness-related stigma reveals
context-dependent patterns. Studies indicate that older clinicians tend
to exhibit heightened stigmatization toward psychiatric disorders,
particularly toward individuals with schizophrenia, potentially
attributable to generational biases or reduced patient exposure (13).

lower educational

However, frequent clinical interactions with patients may mitigate
stigma among senior practitioners, suggesting a complex interplay
between chronological age and experiential factors (14). While
extended professional tenure itself does not necessarily correlate
with elevated stigma,
inadequate continuing education or
suboptimal patient interactions may exacerbate negative attitudes
(15). Notably, some research identiﬁes that stigmatizing attitudes
remain independent of demographic variables like gender and age,
being predominantly inﬂuenced by specialized training and clinical
experience (16). The most consistent determinant across studies is
educational attainment:
levels show strong
associations with intensiﬁed stigma. For instance, paraprofessionals
(e.g., assistants or technicians with limited formal education)
demonstrate signiﬁcantly greater stigmatizing tendencies compared
to psychologists or physicians (14). Particularly, individuals with only
primary education exhibit markedly higher stigma scores than those
with advanced degrees (17). Furthermore, studies have identiﬁed
elevated depression-related stigma among male PHCPs, which may
be associated with gender-speciﬁc stereotypes regarding mental health
issues or societal role expectations (18). Conversely, population-based
research demonstrates that females in the general population exhibit
higher levels of stigmatization toward mental disorders (19).
Regarding psychological aspects, prior research shows that the
associated factors of mental illness-related stigma of medical staff
include mental health knowledge, behavioral discrimination, social
distance, positive contact (20–22). Medical personnel may exhibit a
lack of understanding, mistrust, or even discrimination towards
patients, primarily stemming from inadequacies in their relevant
professional knowledge and clinical experience. The attitudes and
behaviors of this lack of understanding, mistrust, and even
discrimination not only aggravate the stigma of patients but also
may affect the doctor-patient relationship and the treatment effect of
patients (23). Some studies have found that although psychiatric staff
have a more positive attitude towards patients with mental illness,
they always want to keep a greater distance from patients (especially
patients with schizophrenia) (24, 25).

The existing literature exhibits three critical gaps: First, most
studies focus on the stigma experienced by patients or family
members, while neglecting the impact of healthcare providers’
own stigmatizing attitudes on service quality (26, 27); Second,

studies targeting medical professionals have mainly been conducted
in urban medical institutions or qualitative studies in rural areas,
lacking direct quantitative evidence indicating that phcp in rural
China is a unique population (28–30). Third, although factors like
mental health knowledge, behavioral discrimination, social
distance, contact, and social factors are known to correlate with
stigmatization, it remains unclear whether rural-speciﬁc structural
factors (e.g., scarcity of training resources, entrenched cultural
beliefs) modify these relationships (31, 32). Therefore, this study
aims to: (1) quantitatively assess the prevalence and severity of
mental illness-related stigma among PHCPs in rural China, and (2)
examine the associations between PHCPs’ sociodemographic and
psychological factors and mental illness-related stigma levels. We
propose the following hypotheses: (1) Mental illness-related stigma
among rural Chinese PHCPs demonstrates a high prevalence and
signiﬁcant severity; (2) Among sociodemographic factors, the older,
longer work experience and lower education level are positively
associated with higher mental illness-related stigma levels while
gender may be related to the level of mental illness related stigma;
(3) Regarding psychological factors, poorer mental health
knowledge, stronger behavioral discrimination tendencies toward
patients, greater desired social distance, and less contact quantity
and quality with individuals with mental illness are signiﬁcantly
linked to elevated mental illness-related stigma levels. The research
results will directly serve three goals: 1) Supplement the research on
stigma in the ﬁeld of mental health services in rural primary medical
institutions; 2) Provide a scientiﬁc basis for designing targeted anti-
stigmatization intervention programs; 3) Emphasize the importance
of enhancing service capabilities by reducing the mental illness-
related stigma of PHCPs, optimizing the rural mental health service
system, and ultimately improving the accessibility of treatment and
the quality of rehabilitation for patients with mental disorders.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Participants

From November to December 2023, a consecutive sample of 256
PHCPs (121 doctors, 75 nurses, 6 Psychiatric professionals, 45
others) were recruited through onsite invitations at weekly staff
meetings from 10 township health service centers in Xinjin County,
Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, China. Inclusion criteria for
participants: (1) PHCPs working full-time (>30hrs/week as deﬁned
by local health administration standards) in the township health
service centers (e.g., hospital or clinic), (2) age range 18–65 years old,
with birth dates cross-checked against government-issued ID cards,
(3) self-reported never diagnosed with from mental illness, conﬁrmed
through monthly health checkup records, and (4) Mandarin Chinese
proﬁciency to understand and cooperate with the investigation.
Exclusion criteria include: (1) incomplete questionnaire submission
(>20% missing data) as determined by real-time quality checks
during data collection and (2) current psychiatric diagnosis
documented in medical records, and (3) temporary staff or rotating
trainees with <1 months service tenure. Potential participants

were approached by trained research coordinators during pre-
scheduled 30-minute recruitment sessions, where study objectives
and procedures were explained using standardized slides.
The recruitment rate was 96.5% (247/256 eligible PHCPs), with
refusals primarily due to scheduling conﬂicts (n=8) or personal
reluctance (n=1). Participants received 30 yuanupon completion as
compensation for time spent.

Demographic data and clinical psychological questionnaires
were completed via paper-and-pencil format during scheduled
work breaks by all participants under the supervision of trained
research assistants (graduate students certiﬁed in ethical data
collection), achieving 100% response rate with no missing data.
Each questionnaire underwent dual veriﬁcation by independent
raters using a standardized checklist. All participants gave written
informed consent after receiving standardized oral/written study
information. The study was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee (HREC) of the University of Hong Kong
(No: EA2001046).

2.2 Measures

2.2.1 Demographic data

We used a self-developed demographic questionnaire to collect
including gender, age, education level,
demographic data,
occupation, work experience, marital status, family size, annual
income, whether to have contact with people with mental illness.

2.2.2 Mental illness-related stigma

The Mental Illness: Clinicians’ Attitudes (MICA) was used to
assess the mental illness-related stigma among PHCPs. The MICA
has been used to assess the attitudes of clinicians and other medical
professionals towards persons with mental illness (33). It consists of
16 items, each consisting of six options on a 6-point scale, 1 =
strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = somewhat agree, 4 = somewhat
disagree, 5 = disagree, and 6 = strongly disagree. The scores of each
item are summed to obtain the total score, ranging from 16 to 96.
We used a median of 48 as the cutoff point, deﬁned a score of 16 to
48 as having no mental illness-related stigma and 49 to 96 as having
mental illness-related stigma (34). The higher the score, the greater
the mental illness-related stigma. MICA has been proven to have
good reliability and validity among medical students and healthcare
workers (35). The Cronbach’s Alpha of the Chinese version of
MICA used in this study was 0.687.

2.2.3 Mental health knowledge

The Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS) was used
to assess participants’ stigma-related mental health knowledge
(36). The MAKS contains 12 items, and 6 items are related to
the stigma-related mental health knowledge, including seeking
help, recognition and support, employment, treatment, and
rehabilitation, and another 6 are opinions of what disease belongs
to mental illness. Each item is on a 5-point Likert scale, 1 = strongly
disagree, 2= somewhat disagree, 3= neither agree nor disagree, 4=

somewhat agree, and 5 = strongly agree. The higher the score, the
more knowledge of mental health. The scale has been proven to
have good reliability and validity among community health staff in
China (37). The Cronbach’s Alpha of the Chinese version of MAKS
used in this study was 0.700.

somewhat disagree, 4= neither agree nor disagree, 5= somewhat
agree, 6= agree, and 7= strongly agree. All items combined to get the
total score, the higher the score, the higher the quality of contact
with persons with mental illness. The Cronbach’s Alpha of the
Chinese version of CQLS used in this study was 0.870.

2.2.4 Behavior discrimination

2.2.8 Depressive symptoms

The Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS) was used to
assess participants’ behavioral discrimination related to persons
with mental illness (38). It consists of eight items, of which items 1–
4 assess the incidence of behaviors related to persons with mental
illness, including the three options “Yes”, “No” and “Don’t know”.
Items 5–8 assess the willingness to engage in behaviors related to
persons with mental illness. It is 5-point Likert scale, 1 = strongly
disagree, 2= somewhat disagree, 3= neither agree nor disagree, 4=
somewhat agree, and 5 = strongly agree. Scores from 5 to 8 items are
summed to give a total score, ranging from 4 to 20, with higher
scores indicating lower level of behavioral discrimination against
persons with mental illness. The Chinese version of RIBS has strong
consistency reliability (38). The Cronbach’s Alpha of the Chinese
version of RIBS used in this study was 0.765.

2.2.5 Social distance

The Social Distance Scale (SDS) was used to assess participants’
social distance from persons with mental illness (39). SDS contains
7 items, each item has four options: 0 = completely willing, 1 =
willing, 2 = won’t, 3 = completely not. The total scores are from 0 to
21 points, the higher the score indicates the more inclined to keep a
larger social distance with persons with mental
illness. The
Cronbach’s Alpha of the Chinese version of SDS used in this
study was 0.870.

2.2.6 Contact quantity

The 5-item Contact Scale (CQTS) was used to assess assessed
the amount of contact participants had with people with mental
illness at work (CQTS-Work), with people with mental illness in
their neighborhood (CQTS-Neighbors), with friends and relatives
of people with mental illness (CQTS-Relatives and Friends), with
non-positive contact with people with mental illness (CQTS-Non-
positive contact), and with people with mental illness at home
(CQTS-Home) (40). Each item is a 7-point Likert scale (1= no
contact at all, 7= frequent contact). The scores of all items were
summed to obtain the total score, with higher total scores indicating
illness. The
more frequent contact with persons with mental
Cronbach’s Alpha of the Chinese version of CQTS used in this
study was 0.890.

2.2.7 Contact quality

A 5-item Contact Quality Scale (CQLS) was used to assess the
contact quality between participants and persons with mental
illness in ﬁve aspects: whether the contact was equal, voluntary,
intimate, pleasant and cooperative (40). Each item was rated on a
seven-point Likert scale, 1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 3=

The 9-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-
9) was used to assess participants’ depressive symptoms. The scale
has been commonly used and is considered the most reliable tool to
screen for depressive symptoms (41, 42). Each item is assessed on
how often you have been bothered by the symptoms in the past two
weeks. There are four options, 0= not at all, 1= a few days, 2= more
than half the days, and 3= almost every day. The 9 items were added
together to give an overall score, with higher scores indicating more
severe depressive symptoms. The Cronbach’s Alpha of the Chinese
version of PHQ-9 used in this study was 0.875.

2.2.9 Anxiety symptoms

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Self-rating Scale (GAD-7)
was used to assess the anxiety symptoms of the participants, which
is a widely used scale to measure anxiety symptoms (43). It consists
of seven items, each item is assessed on how often they have the
symptoms in the past two weeks. There are four options, 0= not at
all, 1= a few days, 2= more than half the days, and 3= almost every
day. The total score was obtained by direct addition, with higher
scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms. The Cronbach’s
Alpha of the Chinese version of GAD-7 used in this study
was 0.901.

2.3 Statistical analysis

The SPSS software (version 26) was used for statistical analysis
of the data of PHCPs. 1). Data cleaning and pretreatment, the
missing value, and the mean value interpolation method were
adopted to ﬁll. 2). T-test and one-way ANOVA were used to test
whether the mental illness-related stigma differed by demographic
characteristics of the participants, and post hoc multiple tests were
performed if the results of one-way ANOVA were signiﬁcantly
different. Participants were divided into two groups (cut-off
point=48), G1= without mental illness-related stigma, and G2=
with mental illness-related stigma. T-test and Chi-square tests were
used to explore the differences in socio-demographic and
psychological scales between the two groups. 3). Pearson
correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between
mental illness-related stigma and various related factors. 4). Binary
logistic regression analysis was conducted with mental illness-
related stigma as the dependent variable and other related factors
as independent variables to explore the associated factors of mental
illness-related stigma. The positive results were included in the ROC
curve to explore the suggestive efﬁcacy of the associated factors. P <
0.05 was considered a statistically signiﬁcant difference.

3 Results

3.1 Demographic characteristics and
mental illness-related stigma of
participants

This study included 247 PHCPs (Table 1), most of them were
females (74.5%), aged 18 to 39 years old (55.1%), with junior college
degree (53.8%), and doctors (49.0%). About half of the participants
had more than 15 years of work experience (52.2%), got married
(83.4%), had a family size > 4 (58.3%), and annual income > 100000
RMB (59.5%). In addition, majority of them did not contact with
persons with mental illness in the past month (67.2%).

The mental illness-related stigma was signiﬁcantly different
among different age, education level, work experience, and
marital status groups (p<0.001, T=3.7186; p=0.034, F=3.436;
p=0.001, T=3.526; p=0.016, F=4.212). The 40–65 years group had
signiﬁcantly higher mean scores of stigma than the 18–39 years
group (p<0.001, T=3.719), and the work experience ≥15 years group
had signiﬁcantly higher mean scores of stigma than the work
experience < 15 years group (p=0.001, T=3.526). Participants with
high school/technical secondary degree had signiﬁcantly higher
mean scores of mental
illness-related stigma than those with
undergraduate degree (p=0.034, F=3.436), and the married group
had signiﬁcantly higher mean scores of stigma than the unmarried
group (p=0.016, F=4.212). In the chi-square test, age, length of work
experience, and contact history with mental
illness (within 1
month) were signiﬁcantly different between G1 group and G2
group (p=0.013, p=0.002, p=0.028).

3.2 Psychological scales of participants

Table 2 shows the psychological scales of PHCPs. In the t-test
and chi-square test, participants without mental illness-related
stigma had signiﬁcantly higher mean scores or level of MAKS,
RIBS, CQTS-Work, and CQLS than those with mental illness-
related stigma (p=0.001, p<0.001, P=0.041, P<0.001), and
participants without mental
illness-related stigma had
signiﬁcantly lower mean score or level of MICA and SDS than
those with mental illness-related stigma (p<0.001, P<0.001). There
was no signiﬁcant difference of mental
illness-related stigma
between the two groups in other variables (all p>0.05).

3.3 Correlation between participants’
mental illness-related stigma and other
variables

The results of the correlation analysis are summarized in
Table 3. The scores of MICA were signiﬁcantly positively
correlated with participants’ age, work experience, and the scores
of SDS (p<0.01), and signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with the
scores of MAKS, RIBS, CQTS-Work, and CQLS (p<0.05 or p<0.01).

10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1519527

3.4 Associated factors of the mental
illness-related stigma among participants

Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the model ﬁtted
well (Table 4), with R²=0.286 > 0.2, indicating that the results of this
calculation were reliable. The results showed that participants’ work
experience (b=0.080, 95%CI=1.002~1.170, p=0.044) and scores of
SDS (b=0.169, 95%CI=1.056~1.328, p=0.004) had signiﬁcantly
positively impact on the mental illness-related stigma. The scores
of MAKS (b=-0.082, 95%CI=0.850~0.998, p=0.045) and RIBS (b=-
0.131, 95%CI=0.783~0.983, p=0.024) had signiﬁcantly negatively
impact on the mental illness-related stigma.

The ROC curve is shown in Figure 1. Participants’ work
experience (AUC=0.630) and the scores of MAKS (AUC=0.627)
had prompt value for mental illness-related stigma, but the prompt
effect was low. Participants’ scores of RIBS (AUC=0.700) and SDS
(AUC=0.701) had high prompt effect for mental illness-related
stigma. Truncation values of work experience, MAKS, RIBS, and
SDS were 16.5, 45.5, 11.5, and 13.5, respectively (Table 5).

4 Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative study
to investigate mental illness-related stigma and its associated factors
among PHCPs in rural China. This study measured the
demographic characteristics and stigma-related psychological
scales of 247 PHCPs to explore the mental illness-related stigma
experienced by PHCPs in rural China. It is essential to reduce
PHCPs’ mental illness-related stigma, and improve the quality of
community mental health services in rural areas.

The results of this study showed that most PHCPs in rural
China had mental illness-related stigma (62.8%), consistent with
previous qualitative research on mental
illness-related stigma
among PHCPs in rural China (30), a rate signiﬁcantly higher
than that observed among healthcare providers (HCPs) in
developed countries (40%-55%) (44) — a disparity that may be
closely linked to insufﬁcient medical resources, low mental health
knowledge rates, and entrenched cultural perceptions in rural areas
(27). These ﬁndings align with the characteristic pattern of
heightened biases and misconceptions regarding mental disorders
among PHCPs (45) and are consistent with previous studies (8, 9,
30). The mental illness-related stigma is manifested not only in the
underestimation of patients’ capabilities, but also permeates clinical
practice through reduced willingness to provide services, increased
misdiagnosis rates, and treatment delays (46). This discriminatory
attitude may exacerbate patient stigma through “labeling” and
“differential treatment” (47), thereby creating a vicious cycle of
“stigma-treatment avoidance-functional deterioration” that hinders
help-seeking behaviors and rehabilitation processes (48).

In terms of social demographic characteristics, this study
illness-related
showed that PHCPs with and without mental
stigma had signiﬁcantly differences of age, work experience, and
contact history of persons with mental illness (within one month)

at 16.5 years, PHCPs exceeding this threshold exhibited a higher
risk of stigmatization, suggesting that long-term grassroots service
experience may serve as a biosocial marker for mental illness-
related stigma accumulation. Regarding age and work experience,

this result is consistent with many previous studies (13, 49). The
possible reasons may include that as the growth of the age, the social
information and ideas that individuals are exposed to will gradually
solidify (50), the traditional bias and misunderstanding on mental

illness may be more entrenched. While frequent clinical
interactions with patients may reduce mental
illness-related
stigma among experienced clinicians (14, 51), negative work
experiences may also accumulate over time, such as the treatment
difﬁculties of persons with mental illness and social discrimination,
which may aggravate their mental illness-related stigma. Similarly,
as their work experience increases, PHCPs may experience burnout,
and have reduced enthusiasm and motivation for their work (52),
which may make them be more inclined to avoid dealing with issues
related to mental illness. However, there are no correlation or even
negative correlation between age and work experience with mental
illness-related stigma in some other studies (24, 53, 54). This
paradox may stem from differences in professional roles:
specialized mental health professionals might mitigate age-related
biases through systematic training, whereas primary healthcare
professionals lack such interventions, leading to the accumulation
of traditional cognitive stereotypes with prolonged work experience
(55). On the other hand, it may be related to the differences in
regions, cultures and measurement methods. The protective effect
of educational attainment is consistent with previous studies
(14, 17), conﬁrming the “knowledge-Attitude Correction Theory”
(56), people with lower education levels may be relatively lack of
channels and ability to obtain mental health knowledge and mental
illness-related information, which is easily affected by social

prejudice, which leads to increased mental illness-related stigma.
It is worth noting that the inﬂuence of marital status may be related
to the superimposed pressure of family responsibilities and social
expectations in Chinese culture (57). Married PHCPs are more
susceptible to stigmatization cognition when fulﬁlling multiple
social roles. Although this study found no statistically signiﬁcant
gender differences, the ﬁndings require contextual interpretation
lenses. Evidence suggests that gender’s
through socio-cultural
inﬂuence on stigma often interacts with geographical factors:
rural female PHCPs may exhibit higher stigmatizing attitudes
than their urban counterparts due to reinforced traditional gender
roles, while male PHCPs might conceal biases to preserve perceived
authority (58, 59). Furthermore, female PHCPs showed higher odds
of mental
illness-related stigma reduction after contact with
mentally ill patients, suggesting gender may indirectly shape
attitudes through a “contact-cognitive modiﬁcation” pathway
(60). This mechanism remained unobserved in our study,
potentially due to low-quality mental health service contact in
rural areas—PHCPs’
interactions are often limited to crisis
intervention rather than systematic therapeutic engagement,
which may be insufﬁcient to trigger cognitive restructuring (61).
This suggests that anti-stigma interventions targeting PHCPs need
to adopt a stratiﬁed design: 1)for older individuals with low
education levels, the focus should be on cognitive restructuring,

mental illness-related stigma among PHCPs. Speciﬁcally, PHCPs
maintaining greater social distance from patients exhibit heightened
mental illness-related stigma levels, which is consistent with previous
studies (30, 64). This might stem from the fact that PHCPs may have
internalized the stereotype that “mental
illness = danger/
unpredictability” (39) and limited exposure opportunities in the
long-term social and cultural environment, ultimately leading to a
reduction in sympathy and understanding for patients (65). On the
other hand, insufﬁcient training exacerbates this relationship. When
confronted with the complexity of treatment, physicians are more
inclined to adopt defensive strategies such as referrals or restrictive
prescriptions. This decision-making model further solidiﬁes the
vicious cycle of “professional incompetence - distance maintenance
- stigma enhancement” (66). Notably, while mental health knowledge
demonstrates an inverse correlation with stigmatization (21, 22), this
relationship remains contentious: empirical evidence reveals
paradoxical patterns where knowledge enhancement may
inadvertently reinforce mental illness-related stigma, particularly
through stereotyping speciﬁc diagnoses (e.g., heightened
“dangerousness” perceptions in schizophrenia) (67) or measurement
artifacts from instrument limitations (e.g., assessing knowledge
breadth while neglecting conceptual depth) (20). Although
acquiring stigma-related mental health knowledge theoretically
enables PHCPs to better comprehend mental illness etiology and
manifestations potentially mitigating prejudice, multiple studies
paradoxically report non-signiﬁcant or even positive correlations
between knowledge levels and stigmatization (59, 64). Such
inconsistencies may stem from methodological heterogeneity across
study populations, assessment tools (e.g., conﬂating factual recall with
critical understanding), and cultural contexts. When discriminatory
behaviors are prevalent within a group, individuals may internalize
these behaviors as personal attitudes through observational learning
(68). This mechanism is evidenced by PHCPs with more severe
behavioral discrimination demonstrating higher levels of mental
illness-related stigma. In rural China, the behavioral patterns of
PHCPs exhibit a unique “protective discrimination” characteristic—
manifested through both excessive protective measures like
compulsory restraints and the use of derogatory labels such as
“lunatics” (30, 69). Notably, this paradoxical phenomenon parallels
ﬁndings from primary care studies in Chile, where healthcare workers
simultaneously engage in discriminatory triage practices while
evading responsibilities through institutional avoidance (70).
Furthermore, the contact quality and the contact quantity at work

2) for married groups, it is necessary to integrate family support
systems to reduce role conﬂicts (62), 3) develop targeted training
programs for physicians with over 16.5 years of work experience,
emphasizing strategies for the positive transformation of
negative experiences, such as burnout management and patient
communication skills (63).

In terms of psychology, the results of this study showed that the
mental illness-related stigma (scores of MICA) was signiﬁcantly
positively correlated with social distance (SDS), and negatively
correlated with mental health knowledge (MAKS), RIBS, contact
quantity (CQTS-Work), and contact quality (CQLS). The results of
the binary logistic regression analysis showed that social distance had
a signiﬁcant positive impact on mental illness-related stigma among
PHCPs, while mental
illness-related knowledge and behavioral
discrimination had negative impacts on PHCPs’ mental illness-
related stigma. However, ROC curve analysis revealed that mental
health knowledge had a lower predictive value for mental illness-
related stigma, whereas behavioral discrimination and social distance
showed higher predictive values. In this study, the cutoff values for
MAKS, RIBS, and SDS were 45.5, 11.5, and 13.5, respectively. Values
higher or lower than these cutoffs could indicate the presence of

are signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with the mental illness-related
stigma, which is consistent with the vast majority of research results
(22, 23, 71–73). However, some studies have shown that the level of
mental illness-related stigma is not related to the contact quantity (15),
and even the long-term exposure of medical staff may exacerbate the
stigma due to work stress or negative interaction experiences (30, 51,
52). We further found that the contact quality has a greater correlation
on mental illness-related stigma than the contact quantity at work,
which substantiates the core hypothesis of the Enhanced Contact
Model (ECM) proposed by Ran, which suggests that increasing the
level of positive contact should be helpful to reduce mental illness-
related stigma (22). However, current research has paid insufﬁcient
attention to the heterogeneity of contact effects. For instance, Boyd
et al. found that personal contact signiﬁcantly reduces stigma, while
the role of workplace contact remains controversial (65); Aﬂakseir
et al. further noted that only structured workplace contact (e.g.,
combined with professional training) can reduce stigma, whereas
mere frequency accumulation shows no signiﬁcant effect (74). By
distinguishing between quality and quantity dimensions of contact,
this study reveals that in primary healthcare settings, the depth of
professional interactions (such as empathetic communication and
symptom identiﬁcation training) may better infects changes in mental
illness-related stigma levels compared to contact frequency, thereby
providing a novel explanatory pathway for contradictory ﬁndings.
Speciﬁcally, reduced workplace contact frequency with persons with
mental illness heightens PHCPs’ susceptibility to stereotypes (59),
while culturally entrenched negative societal attitudes amplify
stigma through dual pathways: 1) Poor-quality interactions hinder
clinical understanding of patients’
lived experiences; 2) Limited
empathetic engagement perpetuates compassion deﬁcits (75).
These ﬁndings provide critical targets for developing targeted
intervention strategies: it is recommended to prioritize ECM-based
training programs for enhancing contact quality concurrently
establish a social distance monitoring system, and develop context-
speciﬁc knowledge assessment tools to mitigate the risk of
conceptual oversimpliﬁcation.

4.1 Limitations

This study still has several limitations that need to be noted: 1).
This study was a cross-sectional study, unable to determine the
causal relationship between variables, and further longitudinal
studies should be conducted in the future. 2). The sample size of
this study was not very big, and the PHCPs were located in a rural
area of Chengdu, China, which may not represent all rural PHCPs
in China. Future studies should include larger and more diverse
samples from different rural regions to enhance generalizability. 3).
The data were collected via self-report questionnaires, which are
susceptible to social desirability bias and may be affected by
participants’ subjective feelings and biases. These methodological
constraints could compromise the accuracy and reliability of the
ﬁndings. To strengthen validity, future research should consider
employing multiple data collection methods—such as behavioral

measures, observational studies. 4). MICA demonstrated a
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.687, falling below the recommended
threshold of 0.7. Future studies should revise the MICA scale
with cultural adaptation and validation, and incorporate
behavioral experiments or objective indicators to enhance the
validity of mental illness-related stigma assessment. 5). This study
did not address key potential confounders such as PHCPs’ burnout
levels, workplace culture, or prior mental health training, which
could inﬂuence mental illness-related stigma manifestation, future
research needs to take these factors into comprehensive
consideration. 6).The study did not explore qualitative aspects of
mental
illness-related stigma (e.g., narratives from PHCPs) or
illness types (e.g., depression vs.
differentiate between mental
schizophrenia) that may elicit varying stigma levels. Future
research should adopt mixed-methods designs combining
thematic analysis of PHCPs’ narratives with disorder-speciﬁc
stigma assessments to capture stigma heterogeneity across mental
health conditions.

5 Conclusion

This study aimed to explore mental illness-related stigma and
its associated factors among PHCPs in a Chinese rural area. The
results of the study have indicated the following: 1). The mental
illness-related stigma of PHCPs in rural areas of China is serious. 2).
PHCPs with longer work experience, greater social distance from
persons with mental illness, less mental health knowledge, and
stronger behavioral discrimination towards persons with mental
illness were more likely to have mental illness-related stigma. These
ﬁndings will improve the understanding of mental illness-related
stigma and its associated factors in PHCPs in rural China. Based on
the ﬁndings, targeted mental health training and education
programs and anti-stigma interventions should be urgently
developed for PHCPs for reducing their mental illness-related
stigma,
improving the quality of community mental health
services, and facilitating the treatment and rehabilitation of
persons with mental illness in rural area.
