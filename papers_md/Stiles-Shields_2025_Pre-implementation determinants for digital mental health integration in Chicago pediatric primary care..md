Abstract

Objective: Pediatric primary care (PPC) is a common treatment site for pediatric mental health, but it is currently unable to meet the needs of all 
teen  patients,  particularly  those  with  minoritized  identities  and/or  marginalized  experiences.  Digital  mental  health  (DMH)  low-intensity  treat-
ments (LITs) can increase mental health screening and care capacity in PPC, but how this is done successfully without burdening providers, 
patients, or families is unclear. This paper presents a pre-implementation study aimed at understanding the implementation context (PPCs in 
Chicago, IL) for a specific DMH LIT.

Method: Using a mixed-methods design, quantitative data from an online survey of providers assessed current DMH practices in PPC, and qual-
itative interviews with Pediatricians and Pediatric Psychologists examined implementation determinants for a specific DMH LIT. Quantitative 
data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and interviews were analyzed using rapid qualitative assessment.
Results: Survey reports (n ¼ 105) and interviews (n ¼ 6) indicated low current use of DMH. Providers in PPC clinics voiced multiple reasons for 
low usage and low perceived feasibility, including: Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) Inner Setting Domain (PPC 
clinic workflow, responsibility and ethical considerations, patient privacy and confidentiality), CFIR Outer Setting Domain (hospital and health-
care system factors), CFIR Innovation Domain (DMH design), and a cross-cutting theme of safety.

Conclusions: Provider-reported low feasibility for integrating DMH in PPC is a call to action to partner with interdisciplinary colleagues and iden-
tify how such settings can ethically and seamlessly deliver digital evidence-based and accessible screening and care prior to implementation.
Keywords: digital mental health, pediatric primary care, determinants, teens, mental healthcare. 

Teen mental health needs have amplified as a result of multi-
ple and overlapping endemics (Murthy, 2022). Meeting these 
needs is challenging, as most youth who qualify for a mental 
health  diagnosis  do  not  receive  treatment  (Olfson  et  al., 
2024),  and  this  treatment  gap  is  even  more  marked  for 
minoritized  youth  (Chang  &  Slopen,  2024).  These  unmet 
needs are in part driven by limited access and provider short-
ages.  As  such,  identifying  alternative  approaches  to  address 
adolescent mental health needs is essential. One possibility is 
leveraging  pediatric  primary  care  (PPC)  visits,  which  nearly 
all  children  in  the  United  States  (U.S.)  receive  annually 
(National Center for Health Statistics, 2024). PPC is a low- 
stigma  setting,  and  increasing  numbers  of  caregivers  and 
teens  are  receptive  to  regular  mental  health  screenings  and 
referrals  during  PPC  visits  (Kass  et  al.,  2023;  Stiles-Shields 
et al., 2024).

Yet, pediatricians report multiple and growing barriers to 
assessing mental health needs and connecting teen patients to 

care  (O’Brien  et  al.,  2016).  Further,  teens  with  intersecting 
minoritized  racial,  ethnic,  and  gender  identities  are  con-
fronted with disparities in PPC settings, with reduced detec-
tion  of  mental  health  disorders  and  lower  behavioral 
healthcare quality and service use, both in-person and via tel-
ehealth (Chakawa  et al., 2021; Prichett et  al., 2023; Slopen 
et al., 2024). Despite these barriers, PPC is often a frequent 
treatment  site  for  pediatric  mental  health  (Duong  et  al., 
2021; Shahidullah et al., 2023), because patients bring their 
concerns  (physical  and  emotional)  to  their  pediatricians. 
Hence,  for  PPC  to  better  serve  the  mental  health  needs  of 
minoritized  youth  who  may  have  difficulty  accessing  safe 
services elsewhere (Shahidullah et al., 2023), it is necessary to 
understand  current practices  and  contextual  factors impact-
ing the implementation of mental health supports in PPC.

Digital  approaches  are  increasingly  considered  viable  to 
improve capacity for comprehensive care for teens in PPC set-
tings.  Indeed,  integrated  digital  mental  health  (DMH)  care

has  been  proposed  as  a  strategy  to  integrate  mental  health 
services within primary care settings (Lim et al., 2024). DMH 
tools  and  interventions  have  demonstrated  efficacy  with 
pediatric  populations  (e.g.,  Fedele  et  al.,  2017),  and  teen 
patients  express  a  preference  for  DMH  screening  in  health-
care settings (Martel et al., 2021). Multiple barriers prohibit 
recommended  universal  depression  and  anxiety  screenings 
for teens in PPC (e.g., time, discomfort with topic; Acri et al., 
2018; Bose et al., 2021; Kenny et al., 2021), and DMH may 
be  particularly  poised  to  bridge  this  gap  as  a  low-intensity 
treatment  (LIT).  LITs  are  patient-facing  tools  with  demon-
strated efficacy to provide brief screening, psychoeducation, 
and/or resources—serving as a promising early step for care 
environments, such as PPC, experiencing difficulty managing 
the  screening  and  patient  care  volumes  (Lorenzo-Luaces  & 
Fite, 2024).

implicated 

Unfortunately,  several  factors  are 

in  the 
research-to-practice  gap  for  DMH  LITs  in  healthcare  set-
tings.  Pediatric  DMH  has  often  overlooked  implementation 
planning  at  the  start  of  design  (Psihogios  et  al.,  2022),  and 
has  therefore  not  included  the  perspectives  of  key  players 
(teens, caregivers, providers) into how a digital tool could fit 
into  their  lived  experience.  In  healthcare  environments, 
DMH LITs differ from traditional services and workflows— 
leading  to  poor  uptake,  engagement,  and,  often,  abandon-
ment  of  the  DMH  (Graham  et  al.,  2020).  Further,  because 
most DMH research has focused on adult healthcare settings, 
and time periods and workflows existing prior to 2020, little 
is known about current DMH implementation in PPC.

The  EPIS  Framework  and  the  Stages  of  implementation 
completion  (SIC)  both  divide  implementation  into  phases: 
pre-implementation  (exploration,  preparation),  implementa-
tion,  and  sustainment  (Aarons  et  al.,  2011;  Chamberlain 
et  al.,  2011).  Drawing  from  these  frameworks,  pre- 
implementation  activities  provide  a  critical  foundation  for 
successful integration of  a new practice or intervention into 
new  contexts  (i.e.,  uptake,  acceptability,  sustainment  of 
DMH 
into  PPC;  Alley  et  al.,  2023).  During  pre- 
implementation, there is an assessment of engagement, feasi-
bility  considerations,  and  readiness  planning  (Chamberlain 
et  al.,  2011).  These  activities  are  particularly  important  to 
promote  healthcare  equity  through  implementation  science 
and  establishing  partnerships  with  community  and  provider 
colleagues  in  their  spaces  (i.e.,  ensure  an  intervention  has 
partner  input  based  on  their  needs,  lived  experience  and/or 
values; Baumann et al., 2023). The Consolidated Framework 
for  Implementation  Research  (CFIR;  Damschroder  et  al., 
2009, 2022) provides a model for understanding the multile-
vel  factors  (i.e.,  individual,  clinic,  organizational,  and  inter-
vention)  that  impact  the  implementation  of  evidence-based 
practices  in  everyday  settings—and  has  been  commonly 
in  pre-implementation  activities  for  adolescent 
applied 
healthcare 
et  al.,  2022).  Pre- 
implementation  assessment  and  planning  informed  through 
frameworks like the CFIR better ensures that DMH integra-
tion  into  PPC  is  contextually  relevant,  feasible,  and  respon-
sive to needs of the local community.

Pre-implementation for a digital mental health low- 
intensity treatment in pediatric primary care
The current study sought to understand the implementation 
context of Chicagoland PPCs, and support the integration of 
a  specific  DMH  LIT,  the  Teen  Assess,  Check,  and  Heal 

(TeACH) System, aimed at serving the mental health needs of 
communities  that  are  systemically  excluded  from  accessible 
mental  health  resources  and  support  (i.e.,  the  West  Side  of 
Chicago, IL; Lynch et al., 2020). Shaped by input from teens 
and caregivers, the TeACH System provides: (1) brief anxiety 
screening  (via  the  Kiddie-Computerized  Adaptive  Tests  [K- 
CAT] anxiety module; Gibbons et al., 2019); (2) brief feed-
back for teens scoring with mild or greater anxiety (e.g., anxi-
ety  prevalence,  psychoeducation  [e.g.,  “Teens  from  your 
neighborhoods  have  described  this  experience  as  ranging 
from  ‘Just  feelings  of  worry  or  uneasiness.  Just  worrying 
about  the  future.’  to  ‘Anxiety  is  the  feeling  of  being  con-
stantly  worried,  stressed,  feeling  anxious  about  everything 
every day in life, about little stuff as well.’”]); and (3) freely 
accessible mental health resources teens may access on their 
own  (e.g.,  apps,  TikTok  reels/YouTube  videos  grounded  in 
evidence-based strategies). The TeACH System is one DMH 
tool among LITs that are growing in prevalence but have not 
been integrated into routine care settings (Lorenzo-Luaces & 
Fite,  2024).  As  such,  findings  from  the  pre-implementation 
activities  for  the  TeACH  System  may  inform  integration  of 
DMH LITs into PPCs, including in urban environments that 
have built systemic disparities to impact specific communities 
and residential areas (Lynch et al., 2020).

The  current  study  aimed  to  address  two  primary  pre- 
implementation  questions.  First,  what  are  the  current  needs 
and practices of clinics serving teens across the Chicagoland 
area? To address this, a necessary first step was to character-
ize current mental health screening and referral practices, as 
well  as  the  current  DMH  implementation  landscape  in 
Chicagoland PPC and medical clinics serving teens (e.g., types 
of DMH tools currently leveraged, the extent of their usage, 
and providers’ perspectives on the feasibility of these models). 
Second, what are the pre-implementation determinants rele-
vant  to  the  integration  of  a  DMH  LIT  (i.e.,  the  TeACH 
System) into specific PPCs serving teens who experience mul-
tiple and overlapping minoritized identities and/or experien-
ces?  To  this  end,  CFIR  was  used  to  elucidate  relevant  pre- 
implementation  determinants  for  the  TeACH  System  and 
similar  DMH  LIT,  broadly.  Because  previous  studies  of 
DMH determinants have been primarily focused on (1) adult 
healthcare settings, and (2) time periods and workflows exist-
ing  prior  to  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  current 
social justice movements, and declaration of a youth mental 
health crisis (Graham et al., 2020; Murthy, 2021, 2022), the 
present study was exploratory in nature. The study findings 
were intended as a first step to guide future implementation 
planning for the TeACH System, and serve as an example to 
inform broader DMH LIT-PPC integration, with the ultimate 
goal  of  increasing  access  to  mental  healthcare  resources  for 
PPC patients.

Methods
Participants
Providers  participated  in  an  online  survey  characterizing 
mental  health,  screening/referral  practices,  and  DMH  land-
scape  in  PPCs,  or  key  informant  interviews  to  provide  per-
spectives on both the TeACH System and similar DMH LIT. 
Survey  providers  were  recruited  from  emails  circulated 
through Departmental listservs and the Illinois Chapter of the 
American  Academy  of  Pediatrics.  Consistent  with  pre- 
implementation  activities  aimed  at  understanding  the  local

implementation  context,  eligibility  criteria  included  treating 
adolescent  patients  in  a  medical  clinic  located  in  the 
Chicagoland  area.  Interview  providers  were  recruited  via 
email invitations based on recommendations to reach out to 
key  opinion  leaders  in  their  settings  (i.e.,  two  PPC  clinics 
housed  in  academic  medical  centers  on  the  West  Side  of 
Chicago;  Malterud  et  al.,  2016).  These  locations  were 
selected as the initial integration sites for the TeACH System, 
and as part of a larger body of research focusing on adapting 
DMH LITs for and with teens living in communities dispro-
portionately  burdened  by  health  disparities,  violence  expo-
sure, and higher economic hardship (e.g., Stiles-Shields et al., 
2023).

Procedure
All  procedures  were  approved  by  Rush  University  Medical 
Center  and  the  University  of  Illinois  Chicago  Institutional 
Review  Boards  (IRBs).  Survey  providers  received  an  elec-
tronic link to a study consent form. After giving digital con-
sent,  survey  providers  answered  screening  items  to  ensure 
eligibility and then the survey items. To promote engagement 
while  maintaining  anonymity,  the  final  page  of  the  survey 
provided  a  link  that  enabled  providers  to  provide  contact 
information.  The  first  30  respondents  who  provided  their 
information received a $10 egift code.

Following consent, interview providers were scheduled for 
individual  interviews  conducted  via  a  HIPAA-compliant 
zoom  account.  One-hour  interviews  were  conducted  by  the 
lead  author  and  were  audio-recorded.  Interview  providers 
received a $10 online gift code for their time.

Measures
Provider survey: landscape for mental health screening, 
referral, and DMH practices
Delivered  via  REDCap  (Harris  et  al.,  2009),  survey  items 
were organized around three domains. First, clinic-level fac-
tors included: clinic type (e.g., PPC, school-based health cen-
ter),  setting  (e.g.,  medical  center),  zip  code,  primary 
languages  in  clinic,  use  of  the  interpreter  line,  populations 
served,  use  of  universal  vs.  targeted  validated  screeners, 
administration processes for screeners, use of DMH in clinic 
(i.e., use for screening or referral in past year, preferred work-
flows for screening DMH in clinic, Wi-Fi access in clinic, tab-
let presence in clinic) and individual-level characteristics (i.e., 
discipline).  Clinic  zip  code  data  were  used  as  a  proxy  for 
community  factors,  including:  (1)  Distressed  Communities 
Index (DCI); and (2) percentage of neighborhood households 
with Broadband Internet Access. While clinics typically have 
larger  catchment  areas  than  their  immediate  zip  code,  this 
variable was selected to provide a characterization of the clin-
ic’s community setting while minimizing participant burden. 
The DCI is a tool derived from the U.S. Census Bureau data 
to create a ranking by zip code to account for seven metrics 
(i.e.,  unemployment,  education  level,  poverty  rate,  median 
income, business establishments, job growth, housing vacan-
cies). Total scores range from no distress (0) to severe distress 
(100), with quintiles of well-being (prosperous, comfortable, 
mid-tier,  at  risk,  distressed;  Kesler,  2022).  Percentage  of 
neighborhood  households  with  Broadband  Internet  Access 
was  calculated  using  the  interactive  map  created  and  main-
tained by the University of Chicago’s Data Science Institute’s 
Internet  Equity 
(Map—DSI  Internet  Equity 
Initiative, n.d.)

Initiative 

Next, teens’ mental and behavioral health factors included: 
top  concerns  and  reasons  for  referral,  and  how  often  teens 
requested  confidentiality.  Finally,  provider-level  factors 
included  their  perceived  feasibility  of  integrating  DMH  in 
clinic  (via  the  Provider  version  of  the  Mental  Health 
Implementation  Science  Tools  [mhIST];  Aldridge  et  al., 
2022).  The  mhIST  assesses  mental  health  interventions  by 
implementation  domains  outlined  by  Proctor  et  al.  (2011). 
Providers  were  prompted  to  “Please  consider  the  use  of 
Digital Mental Health (DMH) to provide brief mental health 
screenings  and  referrals  to  online  tools  for  mental  health 
symptoms for teen patients in medical settings.” The mhIST 
was  used  to  assess  the  Appropriateness  (Self-Perception  of 
Effectiveness  items;  e.g.,  “Is  DMH  a  good  way  to  address 
your clients’ problems?”), Feasibility (Skills, Time, Resources 
items;  e.g.,  “Do  you  have  enough  time  to  regularly  provide 
DMH to those who need it?”), and Accessibility/Reach (e.g., 
“Would  parents  or  other  caretakers  seek  DMH  services  for 
their children if needed?”). The mhIST has demonstrated val-
idity  and  reliability  for  providers  in  international  contexts 
(Aldridge et al., 2022) and demonstrated acceptable reliabil-
ity for the current sample (αs > .70).

Provider interviews: determinants of the TeACH System, 
other DMH LITs
Interviews began with an overview of the proposed design of 
the TeACH System. Providers commented on both the TeACH 
System  and  similar  DMH  LIT  integration  into  their  PPCs. 
Questions  were  structured  based  on  CFIR  constructs 
(Damschroder et al., 2009, 2022): Compatibility (e.g., “How 
well does the intervention fit with existing work processes and 
practices in your  setting?”), Relative Priority (e.g., “To  what 
extent  might  the  implementation  take  a  backseat  to  other 
high-priority initiatives going on now?”), Available Resources 
(e.g. “Do you expect to have sufficient resources to implement 
and  administer  the  intervention?”),  Self-Efficacy  (e.g.,  “How 
confident are you that you will be able to successfully imple-
ment  the  intervention?”),  and  Champions  (“Other  than  the 
formal implementation leader, are there people in your organi-
zation who are likely to champion the intervention?”) in their 
clinics (Damschroder et al., 2009, 2022).

Data analysis
Analytic approach
An  exploratory  sequential  design  was  used  (Creswell  & 
Plano Clark, 2023), with quantitative survey data character-
izing the general practice landscape of teen mental health sup-
port  and  DMH  in  PPC,  with  qualitative  data  elaborating 
upon the determinants driving current DMH usage practices 
and perceived feasibility in two specific PPCs. We used a con-
necting  process  for  data  integration,  wherein  quantitative 
and qualitative data were analyzed independently, and find-
ings  were  integrated  at  the  interpretation  stage  to  elaborate 
upon one another (Palinkas et al., 2011).

Qualitative  analysis.  This  study  drew  from  a  pragmatist 
orientation  where  multiple  understandings  of  reality  drive 
practical  actions  to  serve  the  interests  of  the  community 
(Cornish  &  Gillespie,  2009).  Recognizing  that  positionality 
influences the design, methods, and analysis of a study and is 
connected  to  the  researchers’  personal  and  philosophical 
views,  we

We  used  rapid  qualitative  assessment  analysis  (RQA)  to 
identify  emergent  themes  from  the  interviews  (Hamilton, 
2020).  RQA  is  time-efficient  and  has  demonstrated  similar 
outcomes as thematic and in-depth qualitative analyses (Gale 
et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2018). RQA is particularly appro-
priate  for  questions  related  to  implementation  science  (i.e., 
examining implementation determinants), because it is rigor-
ous and time-sensitive, thereby allowing for more responsive 
action to real-world implementation challenges (Hamilton & 
Finley,  2019).  The  first  step  of  using  RQA  in  the  current 
study was to create a summary template with domains gener-
ated deductively based on the interview questions/CFIR and 
inductively based on transcript review. Consistent with RQA 
methods  (Hamilton,  2013),  a  practice  transcript  was  coded 
to  establish  consistency  in  use  of  the  summary  template, 
extracting key excerpts to enter into the template. The coders 
met  regularly  to  minimize  drift  and  resolve  questions.  The 
coders independently reviewed all data in the summary tem-
plate,  summarizing  key  points and  noting  emergent  themes. 
They then discussed their notes to identify and refine themes.

Quantitative  analysis.  Survey  data  were  examined  via 

descriptive analyses.

Results
Participants
The survey was completed by 105 Chicago providers serving 
teens  in  medical  clinics.  Table  1  and  Supplementary  Tables 
detail the clinic, respondent, and community characteristics. 
Survey  providers  worked  in  clinics  situated  in  communities 
with  a  high  variability  of  well-being,  ranging  from  4.2  (0 
indicates  no  distress)  to  99.1  (100  indicates  severe  distress; 
M ¼ 57.33 ± 32.71).  On  average,  71.98%  (SD ¼ 16.82)  of 
the  homes  immediately  surrounding  the  clinics  had  broad-
band  internet  access  (range:  46.10%–94.0%).  Clinics  were 
described as general pediatrics/primary care (38.1%; n ¼ 40) 
or a pediatric subspecialty clinic (e.g., endocrinology; 26.7%; 
n ¼ 28). Nearly half of clinics were described as serving spe-
cialty populations (e.g., LGBTQIþ, refugee; 48.6%; n ¼ 51). 
Providers were most often pediatricians (50.5%; n ¼ 53), psy-
chologists  (14.3%;  n ¼ 15),  or  advanced  practice  registered 
nurses (14.3%; n ¼ 15).

Four pediatricians (66.7%) and two pediatric psychologists 
(33.3%), who serve teen patients in two PPC clinics located 
on the West Side of Chicago, were interviewed. These PPCs 
are located in communities considered to be at risk (distress 
score of 75.7) and 55.6% of homes in these communities had 
broadband internet access. The sample size is justified by hav-
ing:  (1)  narrowly  defined  objectives  (Hennink  &  Kaiser, 
2022),  and  (2)  recruited  participants  with  “information 
power”  (Malterud  et  al.,  2016)  via  purposive  sampling 
(Hamilton & Finley, 2019).

Mixed-methods results
Quantitative  and  qualitative  findings  were  integrated  at  the 
interpretation stage after independent analyses. As such,  we 
present  quantitative  and  qualitative  results  alongside  one 
another  to  facilitate  their  combined  interpretation.  Further, 
we indicate throughout the results whether  data reflects the 
TeACH System specifically, or DMH LIT broadly.

ferent

Hence, safety topics are highlighted across results for each of 
these themes. Quotes are labeled below by provider type (i.e.,

Pediatric primary care clinic workflow
The PPC clinic workflow theme refers to clinic processes and 
infrastructure  logistics  related  to  the  patient  and  provider 
experience 
to  post-appointment. 
Providers  noted  several  factors  in  the  PPC  workflow  that 
would  impact  current  use  and  the  feasibility  of  DMH  LIT 
(including  the  TeACH  System)  deployment  in  this  setting, 
described as follows.

Note. CFIR ¼ Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research; DMH ¼ digital mental health. CFIR constructs and definitions detailed in 
Damschroder et al. (2009, 2022).

Survey providers indicated that DMH LITs were typically 
not  part  of  their  clinic  workflows.  Administration  of  com-
mon  self-report  mental  health  screeners  (see  Supplementary 
Table  S1)  most  commonly  occurred  using  paper  and  pencil 
(41.0%;  n ¼ 43)  or  the  electronic  medical  record  (EMR)/ 
“MyChart” (patient-facing portal for EMR; 19.0%; n ¼ 20). 
In the past year, most providers reported not using DMH to 
screen teens for mental health symptoms (63.8%; n ¼ 67) and 
about half had not referred teen patients to any type of DMH 
LIT (e.g., trying out the mindfulness app, “Calm”; 45.7%).

Providers  consistently  characterized  clinics  as  fast-paced, 
making  it  hard  to  plan  when  to  administer  the  TeACH 
System. Yet, they also recognized that there can be frequent, 
but  fragmented,  downtime  for  patients  (e.g.,  “Especially  in 
patients  that  are  seeing  residents,  because  it’s  just  sort  of, 
like, creating the system so that you can monopolize on that 
downtime,  which  is  not  necessarily  all  in  one  chunk.”  [Ped 
1]).  Some  survey  (28.6%)  and  interview  providers  recom-
mended  conducting  DMH  mental  health  assessment  or  LIT 
at home, before the appointment (e.g., “If you’re giving the 
questionnaires afterward, that means that the provider has to 
go  back  and  revisit  because  they  may  have  not  even  been 
there for that visit, or that reason, and how to deal with it” 
[Ped 3]).

The  waiting  room  was  cited  by  survey  providers  (30.5% 
preferred  waiting  room  for  DMH  screening)  and  interview 
providers as a likely spot in the workflow when teens could 
engage with DMH LITs. Yet, concerns were raised about the 
limited privacy in this mixed space: “Your issue is PHI. You 
don’t have any privacy [. . . and] you already have the stigma 
associated with mental health. . .you won’t have people want 
to  engage,  even  if  they’re  interested.”  (Ped  3).  Further,  the 
waiting  rooms  can  mix  with  specialty  clinics,  calling 
into question if specific DMH-driven screenings, such as the 
K-CAT administration in the TeACH System, is appropriate 
for all patients in this setting.

Interview providers also noted limited staff capacity, ques-
tioning  who  would  be  responsible  for  patient  follow-ups  if 
teens  screened  positive  for  mental  health  symptoms.  There 
was  disagreement  on  whether  the  responsibility  fell  on  the 
pediatrician  or  other  staff  if  the  TeACH  System  or  another 
DMH  LIT  assessed  for  mental  health  symptoms  outside  of 
typical clinic assessments (e.g., PHQ-2). Providers questioned 
how their workflow could accommodate the need for refer-
rals to care: “I don’t know if the pediatricians can be asked to 

do much more.” (Psych 2). Further, it was noted that safety 
issues can already complicate the clinic workflow at present, 
and would need to be clarified for any DMH integration: 

And, they’re like, “Oh, shoot!” they checked they are sui-
cidal. And they just walked out the door and they didn’t 
tell me that but they checked it on this paper! So, there’s 
certainly downsides, the way we currently do it. But, that’s 
the biggest thing: when you’re asking these questions, you 
need to know what the resources are going to be able to 
be. If you identify these things, we have so few resources 
in our clinic, even for anxiety, depression. (Ped 2)

There  was  also  a 

lack  of  consensus  on  specific 
“Champions,” or those who would go “above and beyond” 
to  integrate  the  TeACH  System  into  PPC.  This  may  have 
been driven by mixed enthusiasm for DMH LIT integration, 
broadly. Survey providers rated using DMH in their clinics as 
“A  little  bit”  Appropriate  (i.e.,  mhIST  self-perception  of 
effectiveness;  1.65 ± .70)  and  for  Accessibility/Reach  (1.16± 
.77), and “Not at all” for Feasibility (i.e., skills, time, resour-
ces;  .88±.86).  While  interview  providers  indicated  general 
enthusiasm  (e.g.,  “I  think  adolescent  providers  would  be 
super  excited  for  it”  [Ped  2]),  they  were  unable  to  identify 
Champions in their clinics. Some mentioned the broad possi-
bility  of  engaging  residents,  social  workers,  and/or  staff  to 
rally as champions, but that funding to support time would 
influence their enthusiasm.

Lastly,  PPC  technology  infrastructure  was  also  cited  as  a 
potential  implementation  barrier  for  the  TeACH  System. 
EMR  integration  was  supported  by  both  survey  providers 
(preference  for  MyChart  link  for  DMH  screeners,  14.3%) 
and interview providers, noting that this would influence the 
feasibility of use: “But that’s my biggest concern. It’s like they 
endorse some really concerning things, or have a big flag, and 
then  that  never  gets  to  a  clinician.”  (Ped  2).  Further,  pro-
viders noted potential challenges related to Wi-Fi service and 
difficulties of tracking devices across a potentially interrupted 
workflow.

Hospital and healthcare system factors
This theme refers to the broader healthcare and hospital eco-
system in which PPC clinics are situated, and how this system 
impacts  DMH  LIT  use  in  PPC  via  resources  and  policies. 
Survey  providers  reported  anxiety  (86.7%),  depression 

Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 2025, Vol. 50

(82.9%), and behavioral problems (58.1%) as teen patients’ 
primary concerns—and the top reasons for behavioral health 
referrals. These data were included in this theme, as respond-
ents noted that after identifying mental health needs, identify-
ing  referrals  is  difficult  due  to  a  “severe  shortage  of 
practitioners,  including  practitioners  who  accept  Medicaid 
and who are located in the patient’s catchment areas” (survey 
provider).  Interview  providers  underscored  the  lack  of 
resources  in  the  broader  healthcare  system  to  address  these 
behavioral health concerns: 

It’s  because  of  the  healthcare  system.  We  don’t  have 
enough time to see patients. We don’t have enough mental 
health.  We  don’t  have  enough  social  workers.  We’re 
stretched and we continue to take on different things. So, 
it’s not that [TeACH System] isn’t appropriate but it just 
makes  more  stress  for  the  provider  and  burnout  as  well. 
. . .The reason why you’re having to do this intervention is 
because primary care providers are having to take up the 
fight in terms of behavioral health where there should be 
behavioral health providers doing it. (Ped 2)

it’s  positive,  and  we 

Providers  went  on  to  describe  feeling  overburdened  in  this 
environment,  and  constrained  in  their  ability  to  respond  to 
mental health needs given limited resources: “What do we do 
the. . .
when 
resources. . .?”  (Psych  2).  Other  providers  acknowledged 
some existing resources built into the hospital infrastructure 
(e.g.,  collaborative  care),  but  expressed  concerns  about  fur-
ther burdening the few existing services if more patients were 
identified as needing care. Psych 1 noted: 

just  don’t  have 

But, just an anxious kid, they’re not going to pop on the 
PHQ-9,  and  let’s  say  they’re  not  like,  disclosing  in  the 
appointment . . . And now they’re like, kind of like screen-
ing positive [because of TeACH System use] . . . adding to 
the potential referral burden on collaborative care. Umm 
. . . needing resources to manage that.

The overburdened perspective may lend insight into low tar-
geted and universal mental health screening reported by sur-
vey  providers.  Despite  recommendations  for  universal 
depression and anxiety screenings for all teen patients in pri-
mary care (Walter et al., 2020; Zuckerbrot et al., 2018), uni-
versal  administration  of  the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9)  and  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder-7  (GAD-7)  was 
endorsed  by  only  52.4%  and  22.9%  of  the  sample, 
respectively.

Additionally,  interview  providers  identified  hospital  rules 
and policies that may inhibit how integration might work for 
teen patients, who might prefer communicating through text 
message.  For  example:  “It’s  hard  enough  even  to  send  an 
appointment  reminder  via  text. . .The  hospital  is  very,  they 
don’t  budge on  anything”  (Ped  2).  Further,  hospital  regula-
tory systems require a clear protocol for safety concerns that 
may  arise  in  any  type  of  mental  health  screening,  including 
through digital methods: “Your person who’s giving it has to 
be trained to deal with that situation, so that would have to 
be an LCSW, LCPC, MD, or something, or the IRB is gonna 
be like: ‘So what are you gonna do?’ And then you have to 
have a protocol in terms of if that child is positive: What are 
your next steps?” (Ped 3).

Responsibility and ethical considerations
In this theme, providers reflected on their responsibility and 
ethical  concerns  in  terms  of  how  they  respond  to  patients’ 
identified mental health needs in the context of digital assess-
ment. Providers  spoke  to  a sense  of  ethical  responsibility to 
respond to patient-reported mental health needs: “This is my 
office  so,  I  feel  personal  responsibility.”  (Ped  4).  Perhaps 
reflecting this feeling of responsibility, about a third of survey 
providers  reported  that  they  verbally  administer  mental 
health  screeners  directly  to  their  teen  patients  (32.4%; 
n ¼ 34).  Interview  providers  stated  that  mental  health 
endorsements require an immediate response, particularly for 
safety concerns related to depression: 

You can’t ask that question without addressing it. I mean, 
we  specifically  don’t  put  our  PHQ-2’s  on  MyChart.  We 
have those only in the office. And we, the physicians, ask 
the questions. We don’t even allow the MAs to do it. We 
feel like, if  a teen is  gonna divulge  that  kind of  informa-
tion,  they  need  an  immediate  response.  And  what  if  my 
MA did it, and then I missed it, and the teen goes off to 
football practice? (Ped 4)

Providers’  sense  of  responsibility  to  respond  to  patient- 
reported mental health needs intersected with their concerns 
about  broader  mental  health  resources  (see  Hospital  & 
Healthcare  System  Factors  theme),  as  the  lack  of  available 
resources limits their ability to respond to patient needs.

A  related  ethical  consideration  was  around  providers’ 
potential  responsibility  to  alert  caregivers  to  their  child’s 
mental health needs: “There’s sort of this moral question of, 
like,  you  get  information  on  any  of  those  diagnoses  which, 
with  maybe  the  exception  of  ADHD,  and  I  feel  like  maybe 
somebody  should  be  alerted,  like  a  parent.”  (Ped  1). 
However,  about  half  of  survey  providers  (46.7%)  reported 
that  their  teen  patients  have  requested  that  their  mental/ 
behavioral health symptoms not be shared with their primary 
caregiver.  How  to  manage  disclosure  was  an  unanswered 
question  for  providers,  but  it  was  noted  as  something  that 
would need to be addressed to deploy the TeACH System in 
PPC.

Teen patient rights, privacy, and confidentiality
This theme referred to data sharing, privacy, confidentiality, 
and broadly, what a teen might want control over in terms of 
sharing mental health information. Providers raised questions 
about the potentiality of teens not wanting their DMH data 
to  be  shared  with  providers  and/or  guardians  (as  noted 
above),  and  challenges  to  maintaining  teen  confidentiality. 
MyChart was one example of how something intended to be 
only  for  a  teen  patient  may  become  accessible  to  caregivers 
(e.g.,  “All  the  time,  I  have  parents  who  have  access  inap-
propriately, and then, I will you know, take away their access 
and  then  they’re  pissed”  [Ped  1]).  Similarly,  interview  pro-
viders wondered about confidentiality from caregivers in the 
waiting  room:  “The  parent’s  sitting  right  next  to  the  kid? 
Looking over their shoulder?” (Ped 4).

While  wanting  to  honor  teen’s  privacy  boundaries,  inter-
view  providers  also  noted  the  potential  benefits  of  sharing 
screening results with guardians: “it is helpful to keep them 
in the loop in certain ways that help them understand anxi-
ety,  and  how  they  can  help  support  their  kid.”  (Psych  1). 
involvement  was 
Further, 

the  question  of  caregiver

Stiles-Shields et al. 

underscored  in  the  context  of  reported  suicidality  or  sub-
stance  use:  “Sometimes  they  may  need  to  know,  right? 
Sometimes,  if  there’s  a  real  safety  concern,  with  suicide  or 
with substance use.” [Peds 1]).

Another consideration raised was around how data would 
be  managed  for  wards  of  the  state  and  children  under  the 
care  of  the  Department  of  Children  and  Family  Services  or 
“people who come to the doctor without their primary care-
giver, so they don’t want their aunt or their uncle or their fos-
ter  care,  and  all  that.”  (Ped  3).  Thus,  the  line  between 
pediatric  patient  autonomy  and  caregiver/guardian  involve-
ment was acknowledged as quickly becoming complicated in 
teen healthcare; this is an additional implementation determi-
nant that will be necessary to address for all DMH LIT inte-
gration, including the TeACH System.

TeACH System design
The DMH Design theme encompassed preferences and con-
cerns around the design, usability, and characteristics of the 
TeACH  System  (i.e.,  screening,  feedback,  referral).  Design 
considerations  were  shaped  by  factors  related  to  modality, 
language, and understanding.

Providers emphasized that teens are most likely to engage 
with content presented via social media. Consistent with the 
design  they  were  presented,  providers  recommended  social 
media  referral  options  grounded  in  evidence-based  skills 
(e.g.,  a  TikTok  reel  portraying  progressive  muscle  relaxa-
tion): “I like the idea of being able to give them resources that 
are vetted. So, I like the idea of having a set group of resour-
ces to give kids. And we know they use social media. So, of 
course, I like those” (Ped 4). They contrasted this with teen’s 
poor engagement with apps recommended in clinic (e.g., “. . .
and I say, let’s download it, and they, like, don’t, even though 
they’re with me.” [Psych 1]) They also noted that teens would 
want to see themselves represented in graphics, with a focus 
on “mak[ing] it more diverse” (Ped 3).

Providers  raised  questions  about  design  considerations 
related  to:  (1)  linguistic  diversity  (i.e.,  whether  available  in 
English and Spanish; “10% or less of our patients and fami-
lies  speak  Mandarin  or  Cantonese”  [Ped  1]);  and  (2)  what 
teen  patients  would  learn  and  understand  from  the  TeACH 
System’s screening and resources. When queried about com-
monly  assessed  symptoms  on  computerized  adaptive  tests 
(i.e., the full K-CAT yields severity scores for anxiety, mania/ 
hypomania,  oppositional  defiant  disorder,  attention-deficit/ 
hyperactivity disorder, depression, conduct disorder, suicidal-
ity,  substance  use  disorder;  Gibbons  et  al.,  2019),  it  was 
noted that: “I don’t think some of the patients would know 
what  some  of  these  things  [diagnoses]  are.  So,  you  would 
have  to  use  more  [lay]  language”  (Ped  1).  Providers  also 
expressed concern about mental health labels being placed on 
teens without learning their broader context: “I think we’re 
both aware about the risk of getting that label put on a teen. 
It carries a lot of potential, like, longer term impact that I just 
wouldn’t want. I would hate for somebody who doesn’t have 
the  ability  to,  like,  really  make  that  diagnosis,  to  see  the 
screener and, like, throw it on their chart, or something like 
that”  (Ped  2).  Further,  providers  wanted  more  information 
on  whether  the  K-CAT  (screener  for  the  TeACH  System) 
could:  (1)  differentiate  between  active  and  passive  suicidal 
ideation; and (2) include other risk assessments, such as non- 
suicidal self-injury or disordered eating.

Discussion
This  study  was  situated  at  the  pre-implementation  phase 
(Chamberlain  et  al.,  2011;  Cornish  &  Gillespie,  2009)  and 
used  a  mixed-methods  approach  to  better  understand  the 
implementation context for a DMH LIT (i.e., integrating the 
TeACH System into PPCs serving teens on the West Side of 
Chicago).  Quantitative  results  highlighted  clinic  catchment 
areas characterized by a high need for behavioral health serv-
ices,  inconsistent  use  of  universally  recommended  mental 
health  screeners,  low  usage  rates  of  DMH  in  Chicagoland 
medical  clinics  serving  teens,  and  ultimately  low  perceived 
feasibility of DMH LIT integration. In compliment, qualita-
tive findings highlighted consistent mention of the high need 
for teen behavioral health services. Qualitative results eluci-
dated multiple inner and outer setting domain-related deter-
minants  uptake  and  integration,  likely  underlying  the  low 
DMH usage and feasibility ratings from the quantitative find-
ings.  Namely,  providers  were  skeptical  of  TeACH  System 
integration  in  their  clinics  due  to  providers’  high  workload 
and hospital/clinic administrative practices that impede inte-
gration. Further, providers noted that if the TeACH System 
increased symptom identification in teen patients, they worry 
about how to support them given limited referral options out-
side  of  the  TeACH  System’s  own  referrals.  These  concerns 
also tied to questions of ethical dilemmas and complications 
around teen confidentiality that need to be addressed for any 
DMH LIT integration. In sum, the findings indicate that pro-
viders  are  eager  for  more  behavioral  healthcare  options  for 
teens,  but  recognize  multiple  barriers  that  would  impede 
DMH in successfully providing these services in their setting.

established 

The TeACH System
through  pre- 
CFIR-related  determinants 
implementation  activities  directly  informed  the  TeACH 
System’s  subsequent  iterative  design  and  implementation 
planning  for  PPC  clinics  serving  teens  on  the  West  Side  of 
Chicago. For example, the theme of DMH Design indicated 
concerns  about  digital  screenings  generating  mental  health 
labels in the absence of the broader diagnostic and psychoso-
cial  context.  Further,  the  theme  of  Hospital  &  Healthcare 
System Factors reflected concerns about screening for multi-
ple mental health disorders in the absence of broader system 
infrastructure to address the identified needs. As such, the use 
of the K-CAT as a screening tool in the TeACH System was 
limited to the anxiety module only (rather than multiple mod-
ules  assessing  additional  mental  health  domains;  Gibbons 
et al., 2019). A focus solely on anxiety while the System and 
its  integration  are  optimized  during  pilot  feasibility  testing: 
(1) aligns with  recommended anxiety screening for all teens 
in PPC (Mangione et al., 2022); (2) decreases the amount of 
time  required  for  engagement  across  busy  PPC  workflows 
(i.e., the  full K-CAT  administration is  �8 min, while  the K- 
CAT  anxiety  module  administration  is  �1 min);  and  (3) 
removes the possibility that the TeACH System will uncover 
safety-related items (e.g., suicidality, substance use) that were 
of  most  concern  to  providers,  even  with  proposed  TeACH 
System  protocols  and  support  team  presence.  This  design 
change illustrates how the assessment of pre-implementation 
determinants is a critical step for future implementation feasi-
bility. Without provider feedback, the TeACH System would 
have been delivered with screening modules that would have 
posed significant barriers for providers to respond to, which

in turn would limit its usability and long-term sustainability. 
This  study  provides  an  exemplar  for  future  deployment  of 
DMH LITs in PPC, highlighting the necessity of understand-
ing the unique contextual factors relevant to specific PPC set-
tings to promote DMH fit (Chamberlain et al., 2011; Mohr 
et al., 2017).

Broad DMH LIT integration
While the pre-implementation activities presented in the cur-
rent study were aimed at informing TeACH System integra-
tion in specific PPCs, the design and purpose of the System is 
similar  to  other  DMH  LITs  in  that  it  provides  a  patient- 
facing  tool  for  screening,  psychoeducation,  and  referrals  to 
brief interventions that may be accessed and/or completed at 
the discretion of and best time for the patient (whether in or 
outside of the healthcare setting). As such, the findings pro-
vide  a  case  example  of  pre-implementation  factors  relevant 
for DMH LITs, and may also provide a model for approach-
ing  the  integration  of  DMH  LITs  in  other  urban  pediatric 
care settings. Indeed, there have been repeated and growing 
calls  to  improve  the  reach,  uptake,  and  tailoring  of  DMH 
LITs for teen patients—particularly teens with intersectional 
and/or minoritized identities (Bounds et al., 2022). Methods 
grounded in social justice and centering lived experience and 
promoting  and  amplifying  diverse  voices  in  design,  clinical, 
and research frameworks and spaces  (Figueroa et  al., 2021, 
2022;  Friis-Healy  et  al.,  2021;  McCall  et  al.,  2022;  Ramos 
et al., 2021), are integral to creating and disseminating more 
equitable and effective DMH LITs. However, a lack of con-
sideration of the implementation of DMH has plagued pedia-
tric DMH broadly (Psihogios et al., 2022), indicating that the 
field has not only been neglecting input from teens and care-
givers,  but  also  overlooking  the  expertise  of  providers.  All 
providers in the current study were acutely aware of the sys-
temic barriers that limit effective teen behavioral healthcare. 
Traditionally  noted  barriers  to  carrying  out  recommenda-
tions for universal mental health screening, such as time (Acri 
et  al.,  2018),  were  not  identified  as  directly  prohibiting 
administration  to  teens.  In  fact,  providers  strongly  voiced  a 
feeling  of  responsibility  to  take  the  time  to  assess  mental 
health  themselves  during  teen  patient  sessions.  The  driving 
barrier  for  the  providers  in  this  study  was  a  reluctance  to 
expand mental health screening through digital delivery with-
out adequate additional resources to support teens who need 
care beyond DMH. As such, introducing DMH LITs as a first 
line of care for primary care patients will not be acceptable or 
feasible  to  providers  without  also  knowing  that  there  are 
accessible  and  timely  second  and  third  lines  of  care  for 
patients with higher needs. Coverage for patients who require 
more care than a DMH LIT may offer is likely a key determi-
nant for integration in PPC moving forward.

While  this  study  has  multiple  strengths,  it  should  also  be 
considered in light of specific limitations. First, while it was 
necessary for the goals of the study to focus on the implemen-
tation context of PPCs in Chicago, the findings may not gen-
eralize  across  diverse  geographical  contexts.  However,  the 
specificity of the current study activities might serve as a case 
example  for  pre-implementation  planning  for  other  LITs  in 
pediatric healthcare settings. Second, to broadly characterize 
the  landscape  of  behavioral  healthcare  for  teens  in  medical 
clinics,  survey  provider  participants  included  clinicians  out-
side  of  PPC  (e.g.,  subspecialty  clinics).  This  expansive  per-
spective  may  therefore  implicate  practices  less  pertinent  to 

PPC.  Further,  given  the  anonymous  nature  of  the  provider 
survey, it is unknown if there was overlap across survey pro-
vider  and  interview  provider  participation.  Third,  interview 
providers were shown design details for the TeACH System 
early  in  their  interviews,  which  may  have  influenced  their 
approach  to  considering  broader  DMH  LIT  integration. 
Finally,  while  purposive  sampling  occurred  to  recruit  pro-
viders with “information power” (Hennink & Kaiser, 2022), 
the  sample  of  interview  providers  was  relatively  small  and 
limited  to  Pediatricians  and  Pediatric  Psychologists.  While 
this study focused on the perspectives of providers in specific 
Chicago  PPCs, 
implementation  research  must  also  be 
informed by the lived expertise of teens, caregivers, and other 
PPC  providers  (e.g.,  nurses,  MAs,  administrators).  As  such, 
future research should partner with and examine the experi-
ence  of  these  other  groups  when  assessing  the  feasibility  of 
DMH in PPC.

DMH LITs stand as a potential low-cost and scalable way 
to expand mental health screening and connection to resour-
ces  for  teens  in  PPC  settings.  Yet,  a  focus  on  design  to  the 
neglect  of  implementation  has  plagued  pediatric  DMH 
(Psihogios et al., 2022). To join calls to consider implementa-
tion from DMH design to sustainment (Graham et al., 2020; 
Mohr  et  al.,  2017),  the  current  pre-implementation  study 
assessed determinants relevant to integrating a specific DMH 
LIT, the TeACH System, into PPCs serving teens on the West 
Side of Chicago. Low perceived feasibility for integration is a 
call  to  action,  rather  than  a  deterrent  for  the  use  of  digital 
tools and services for teens in PPC. For the TeACH System, 
responsive  design  and  implementation  planning  changes 
occurred to address provider concerns for upcoming evalua-
tion and optimization phases (Mohr et al., 2017). Yet, to best 
support diverse teen needs in PPC settings broadly, pediatric 
DMH LITs will need to repeatedly assess and address perti-
nent  questions  relating  to  workflow  integration,  ethics,  and 
ability  to  streamline  access  to  evidence-based,  accessible 
care–even beyond the DMH, itself.
