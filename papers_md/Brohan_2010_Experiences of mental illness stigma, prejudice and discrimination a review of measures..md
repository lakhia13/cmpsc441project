Experiences of mental illness stigma, prejudice
and discrimination: a review of measures
Elaine Brohan*, Mike Slade, Sarah Clement, Graham Thornicroft

Abstract

Background: There has been a substantial increase in research on mental illness related stigma over the past 10
years, with many measures in use. This study aims to review current practice in the survey measurement of mental
illness stigma, prejudice and discrimination experienced by people who have personal experience of mental illness.
We will identify measures used, their characteristics and psychometric properties.

Method: A narrative literature review of survey measures of mental illness stigma was conducted. The databases
Medline, PsychInfo and the British Nursing Index were searched for the period 1990-2009.

Results: 57 studies were included in the review. 14 survey measures of mental illness stigma were identified. Seven
of the located measures addressed aspects of perceived stigma, 10 aspects of experienced stigma and 5 aspects of
self-stigma. Of the identified studies, 79% used one of the measures of perceived stigma, 46% one of the measures
of experienced stigma and 33% one of the measures of self-stigma. All measures presented some information on
psychometric properties.
Conclusions: The review was structured by considering perceived, experienced and self stigma as separate but
related constructs. It provides a resource to aid researchers in selecting the measure of mental illness stigma which
is most appropriate to their purpose.

Background
Defining stigma
The classic starting point for defining the stigma of
mental illness is Goffman’s ‘an attribute that is deeply
discrediting’. The recognition of this attribute leads the
stigmatised person to be ’reduced... from a whole and
usual person to a tainted or discounted one’ p.3 [1]. This
presents stigma as the relationship between attribute
and stereotype. In Goffman’s terms, attributes can be
categorised in three main groups: 1) abominations of
the body e.g. physical disability or visible deformity, 2)
blemishes of individual character e.g. mental illness,
criminal conviction or 3) tribal stigmas e.g. race, gender,
age.

The work of Jones and colleagues built on these
categorisations with a focus on the study of ‘marked
relationships’ [2]. In this definition, stigma occurs
when the mark links the identified person via attribu-
tional processes to undesirable characteristics which

discredit him or her. They propose six dimensions of
stigma:

1. Concealability: how obvious or detectable a char-
acteristic is to others
2. Course: whether the difference is life-long or
reversible over time
3. Disruptiveness: the impact of the difference on
interpersonal relationships
4. Aesthetics: whether the difference elicits a reac-
tion of disgust or is perceived as unattractive
5. Origin: the causes of the difference, particularly
whether the individual is perceived as responsible
for this difference
6. Peril: the degree to which the difference induces
feelings of threat or danger in others

Elliott and colleagues emphasised the social interac-
tion in stigma [3]. In their definition, stigma is a form of
deviance that leads others to judge an individual as ille-
gitimate for participation in a social interaction. This
occurs because of a perception that they lack the skills

or abilities to carry out such an interaction, and is also
influenced by judgments about the dangerousness and
unpredictability of the person. Once the person is con-
sidered illegitimate then they are beyond the rules of
normal social behaviour and may be ignored or
excluded by the group.

There has been a substantial increase in research on
mental illness related stigma over the past 10 years
[4,5]. Link and Phelan note that the stigma concept has
received criticism for being too individually focused and
loosely defined. In response to these criticisms, they
define stigma as ‘the co-occurrence of its components:
labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discri-
mination’ in a context in which power is exercised p.363
[6]. Phelan and colleagues have recently investigated the
possible intersection of conceptual models of stigma and
prejudice, and concluded that the two approaches have
much in common with most differences being a matter
of emphasis and focus. They argue that stigma and pre-
judice have three functions: exploitation and domination
(keeping people down); disease avoidance (keeping peo-
ple away) and norm enforcement (keeping people in)[7].
Corrigan has proposed a framework in which stigma is
categorised as either public stigma or self stigma. Within
each of these two areas, stigma is further broken down
into three elements: stereotypes, prejudice and discrimi-
nation [8]. This is revised in the definition of Thorni-
croft et al, 2007,
in which stigma includes three
elements: problems of knowledge (ignorance or misin-
formation), problems of attitudes (prejudice), and pro-
blems of behaviour (discrimination)[9]. Sayce advocates
using a discrimination framework. Stigma is presented
as an unhelpful concept which prevents focus on the
unfair treatment experienced by mental health service
users [10].

The aim of the review is to report on survey measures
assessing aspects of mental illness stigma, prejudice and
discrimination reported by people personally affected by
mental illness. It will review the characteristics and psy-
chometric properties of the included measures and pro-
vide guidance regarding measures to be used in further
research in the area.

Measuring stigma
An existing review considers the measurement of mental
illness stigma from multiple perspectives including men-
tal health service users, professional groups (e.g. mental
health professionals or police), the general population,
families or carers of those with a mental illness and chil-
dren and adolescents [11]. The current review focuses
only on measures appropriate to people with personal
experience of mental illness and includes several mea-
sures which have been published since the previous
review in 2004. It is timely to focus on measures of the

personal stigma of mental illness as these are increasingly
being used as key outcomes in anti-stigma interventions
[12,13]. This review will focus on the personal stigma,
prejudice and discrimination associated with mental ill-
ness. For the sake of brevity, stigma will be used as an
overarching term to include elements of stigma, prejudice
and discrimination. In this review, the personal stigma of
mental illness is considered in three main ways: perceived
stigma, experienced stigma and self-stigma. Each of these
aspects is defined below:
1) Perceived stigma
Van Brakel and colleagues provide a definition of per-
ceived or felt stigma research as that in which ‘people
with a (potentially) stigmatized health condition are
interviewed about stigma and discrimination they fear or
perceive to be present in the community or society’ [14].
In the original definition, felt stigma ‘refers principally to
the fear of enacted stigma, but also encompasses a feeling
of shame associated with [the illness]’ p.33 [15]. Felt
stigma may be thought of as encompassing elements of
both perceived and self stigma. For the purposes of this
review, perceived stigma is consistent with the definition
of Van Brakel and colleagues, and does not include feel-
ings of shame, which are instead included under self-
stigma.

LeBel, highlights that perceived stigma can include

both of the following [16]:

a) what an individual thinks most people believe
about the stigmatised group in general
b) how the individual thinks society views him/her
personally as a member of the stigmatised group

For the purposes of this review, both of these ele-

ments are included as perceived stigma.
2) Experienced stigma
Van Brakel and colleagues’ definition of experienced
stigma as the ‘experience of actual discrimination and/or
participation restrictions on the part of the person
affected’ will be used in this review [14]. This is similar
to Scrambler & Hopkins, (1986), concept of enacted
stigma or ’instances of discrimination ...on the grounds of
their perceived unacceptability or inferiority’ p.33.
3) Self-stigma
Corrigan and Watson, use the term public stigma to
describe the ways in which the general public stigmatise
people with a mental illness [17]. They describe self-
stigma as the internalisation of this public stigma. An
extended definition describes it as ’the product of inter-
nalisation of shame, blame, hopelessness, guilt and fear
of discrimination associated with mental illness’ [18]. It
has also been defined as a process, either conscious or
unconscious, wherein the person with mental illness
accepts diminished expectations both for and by him or

herself [19]. Van Brakel et al, 2006, describe it as ‘feel-
ings of loss of self-esteem and dignity, fear, shame, guilt,
etc’ In this way, it is contains elements of felt stigma as
described above [15].

If self-stigma is considered as a reaction to public
stigma, then it may be appropriate to also consider mea-
sures of other reactions to public stigma under this sec-
tion e.g. energisation, righteous anger or no observable
response [17]. The coping literature overlaps with this
to a large degree, particularly with behavioural aspects
of self-stigma such as disclosure or social withdrawal
(See [20] for an overview of the coping literature and
the Stigma Coping Orientation Scales [21,22] for further
information). For the puroposes of this review these
additional measures of self-stigma were not considered.
The focus was soley on those which were described as
measuring personal stigma.

Method
A narrative literature review was conducted to identify
survey measures of the three stigma constructs. Search-
ing and data extraction was conducted by EB. The data-
bases Medline, PsychInfo and the British Nursing Index
were searched for published journal articles containing
the title, abstract or keyword terms (’mental AND ill*’
OR ‘mental AND distress’) AND (’stigma*’ OR ‘prejudi-
c*’OR ‘discriminat*’) for the period 1990-2009. After
removing duplicate papers, a total of 984 articles were
identified. The titles and abstracts of these papers were
reviewed. Papers were included if they reported on a
survey measure of perceived, experienced or self-stigma
which had been used with a sample of adults with a pri-
mary diagnosis of a mental illness. Only English lan-
guage papers were included. As the aim was to identify
measures of mental illness stigma, inclusion was not
limited based on study design as long as a survey mea-
sure of mental illness stigma was used. 48 papers met
these inclusion criteria. The reference lists of these
papers and a personal database of stigma papers were
reviewed for further papers. One systematic review of
stigma and mental health was located and the reference
list was checked [23]. The reference lists of 3 review
papers on stigma and mental illness were also checked
[6,11,24]. This resulted in the identification of a further
27 papers.

Results
From the 75 identified papers, 18 were excluded. Papers
were excluded for 4 main reasons: 1) a measure of
stigma was created especially for the study and insuffi-
cient information was presented on the content of the
measure to include 2) the paper included only a mea-
sure of a closely related constructs e.g. stigma receptivity
or a generic disability scale was used as a measure of

stigma and 3) the study reported only on qualitative or
experimental rather than survey based measures of
stigma (see figure 1).

As seen in the above figure, 57 studies were identified
in the review. In these studies, 14 measures of mental
illness stigma were used. Further data on all located stu-
dies is provided in Additional File 1. All but one of the
papers describing the development of these measures
was included in the 57 identified papers. The paper not
included was published in 1987, prior to the period for
this review [25].

Table 1 presents a summary of each measure. The
subscales of each measure were categorised as measur-
ing perceived, experienced or self-stigma using descrip-
tions in the scale development papers. In cases where a
subscale contained items which fell under more than
one construct, the subscale was placed under the con-
struct which represented the greatest number of items.
Detail is provided on the scale structure and psycho-
metric properties (where reported). The measures are
ordered by the number of studies using the measures
(final column). Table 2 presents a summary of the psy-
chometric properties of each measure, as reported in
the initial development paper. This table is a modified
version of the format suggested by Terwee and collea-
gues for reporting on the measurement properties of
health status questionnaires [26]. Terwee and colleagues
highlight a framework of quality criteria for 9 aspects of
psychometric assessment: content validity, internal con-
sistency, criterion validity, construct validity, acceptabil-
ity, reliability, responsiveness, floor and ceiling effects,
and interpretability [26]. However, sufficient evidence
was not present to use this framework consistently
across the identified measures. Criterion validity or the
extent to which scores relate to a gold standard was
excluded due to the lack of a gold standard measure of
stigma. Three additional properties based on minimal
important change (acceptability, responsiveness and
interpretability) were excluded as this information was
not included for any located measures. Therefore Table
2 focuses on 5 properties: content validity, internal con-
sistency, construct validity, test-retest reliability and
floor or ceiling effects.

Measures of perceived stigma
Seven identified measures assess aspects of perceived
stigma (PDD, SSMIS, ISE, HSS, SESQ, DSSS and DISC).
This is the most frequently addressed aspect of mental
illness stigma with 45 (79%) of the identified studies
using one of these measures. The PDD scale was most
commonly used (82% of studies) [25]. Validated versions
of this measure are available in German, Chinese and
Swedish (See Additional File 1). It measures the indivi-
dual’s perception of how ‘most other people’ view

individuals with a mental illness. Corrigan & Watson,
2002, refer to this construct as stereotype awareness. In
their measure, the SSMIS, they adapt the PDD to create
10 items for inclusion as their ‘stereotype awareness’
subscale [27]. Similarly, the ‘feelings of stigmatisation’
subscale of the SSEQ is an adapted 8 item version of
the PDD [28]. This construct is also known as stigma
consciousness [29]. The 4 item ‘public stigma’ subscale
of the DSSS also measures stereotype awareness [30].

As mentioned, stereotype awareness is only one
aspect of perceived stigma. Several of the other identi-
fied scales instead focus on personal expectations or
fears of encountering stigma i.e. a personally relevant
version of stereotype awareness. This is addressed in
HSS, ISE & DISC. The HSS investigates perceptions of
how the person feels they have been personally viewed
or treated by society. The DISC contains 4 items
which address anticipated discrimination, or the expec-
tation of being stigmatised in various aspects of life
[31]. In the 2 item perceived stigma subscale of the
ISE, one of the items addresses stereotype awareness
while the other addresses personal fear of encountering
stigma [32].

All of the measures reported on aspects of content
validity. Several measures did not report on whether the
target population had been involved in item selection
(PDD, SESQ, DSSS) so were rated as partially fulfilling
the criteria as this aspect was indeterminate. Two
(DSSS, SESQ) met the full criteria for internal consis-
tency. Four measures partially met the criteria, reporting
adequate Cronbach’s alpha but not reporting results of a
factor analysis (PDD, SSMIS, ISE, HSS). DISC did not
report on internal consistency. All measures except ISE
and DISC reported adequate construct validity. Informa-
tion on this property is not presented for these mea-
sures. Only the SSMIS and SESQ measured test-retest
reliability, with the criteria reached in the SSMIS. The
SESQ partially met the criterion (≥ 0.70) as the self-
esteem subscale was slightly below the criterion at r =
0.063. Evidence on floor or ceiling effects was not
located for any of the measures.

Measures of experienced stigma
Ten of the measures in Table 1 assess aspects of experi-
enced stigma: ISMI, CESQ, RES, DSSS, SRE, SS, ISE,
MIDUS, DISC and EDS. Twenty-six (46%) of the

Description

Interview based measure which assesses experienced discrimination resulting from mental illness and
other stigmatized identities. It asks whether discrimination has occurred, what the basis for this
discrimination was, whether discrimination occurred in 8 specific settings and the level of stress
associated with discrimination in each setting. Modified version of the Schedule of Racist Events Scale
[91]

identified studies use one of these measures. In all
scales, experienced stigma refers to either experiencing
stigma in general or a report of experiences of stigma in
specific areas of life.

The ‘discrimination experience’ subscale of the ISMI
contains 5 items which address both perceived and gen-
eral experiences of discrimination [33]. This subscale was
included under the category of experienced stigma as a
greater number of the scale items address this construct.

The CESQ ‘discrimination’ subscale asks about experi-
ences of stigma in specific areas of life [34]. In Table 1,
the CESQ ‘stigma’ subscale is also placed under the
experienced stigma construct. This decision was taken as
the majority of items refer to general stigma experiences.
The RES is based on 6 items from the SRES [35] and
5 items from the CESQ [34]. The SRES was developed
prior to the CESQ and the developers now recommend
the use of the CESQ rather than the SRES [11]

accordance with the hypothesis
4ICC or weighted Kappa ≥ 0.70
5≤ 15% of respondents achieved the highest or lowest possible scores

The 12 item ‘discrimination’ subscale of the SS asks
about general stigma experiences e.g. ‘have you been
talked down to’ and specific experiences e.g. in educa-
tion [36]. Several items also address feelings about
stigma. The ISE asks two general questions about
experiences of stigma [32]. The DSSS ‘stigma experi-
ences’ subscale contains 6 items which consider times in
which the respondent may have felt stigmatised because
of experiencing or disclosing depression [30]. The DISC
contains 32 items which address experiences of stigma

in various areas of life including work, family and men-
tal health service use [31].

Two of the identified measures (MIDUS, EDS) exam-
ined experienced stigma as well as multiple reasons for
this stigma. Both ask about the perceived reason for
poor treatment including characteristics such as mental
illness, disability, gender, ethnicity/race, age, religion,
physical appearance, socio-economic status and other
reasons. The MIDUS contains 11 items which measure
‘major discrimination’ and 11 items which measure ‘day
to day’ experiences of discrimination [37]. The EDS has
8 items which address specific areas in which stigma has
been experienced [38].

All of the measures reported on aspects of content
validity. Four did not report on target population invol-
vement in item selection (RSE, DSSS, SRE, EDS). Four
(ISMI, DSSS, SS and MIDUS) met the full criteria for
internal consistency. Three measures partially met the
criteria, reporting adequate Cronbach’s alpha but did
not conduct a factor analysis (RES, SRE, ISE). CESQ,
DISC and EDS did not report on internal consistency.
All measures except CESQ, ISE, DISC reported on con-
struct validity with adequate results. Only the ISMI and
SS measured test-retest reliability, with both reaching
the criterion level. Evidence on acceptable floor and ceil-
ing effects were not available for any measures. Of those
presenting information on this property (CESQ, RES
and MIDUS) several items were seen to violate the cri-
terion, receiving more than 15% of responses. Evidence
on this property was not provided for other measures.

Measures of self-stigma
Five of the measures assessed aspects of self-stigma:
ISMI, SSMIS, DSSS, SS and ISE. Nineteen (33%) of the
studies used one of these measures. Self-stigma contains
cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to per-
ceived or experienced stigma. All three elements were
reflected in the measures located.

Three subscales of the ISMI particularly addressed
self-stigma: alienation, stereotype endorsement and
social withdrawal [33]. These can be considered affec-
tive, cognitive and behavioural dimensions respectively.
The discrimination experience subscale was excluded as
it was considered to measure experienced stigma. The
stigma resistance subscale was also excluded. Three sub-
scales of the SSMIS measure self-stigma: stereotype
agreement, stereotype self-concurrence and self-esteem
decrement [27]. The SS contains a ‘disclosure’ subscale
which focuses on cognitive, affective and behavioural
aspects of disclosure [36]. The ISE contains 1 item on
social withdrawal [32]. Two subscales of the DSSS
address self-stigma: general self-stigma and secrecy [30].
General self-stigma includes aspects of personally rele-
vant stereotype awareness (as discussed under perceived

stigma). Secrecy addresses a similar construct to the dis-
closure subscale of the SS, and the social withdrawal
subscale of the ISMI.

All of the measures reported on content validity. The
DSSS did not report on target population involvement
in item selection. Three scales (ISMI, DSSS, SS) met the
full criteria for internal consistency. The SSMIS and ISE
partially met the criteria, reporting adequate Cronbach’s
alpha but not conducting a factor analysis. All measures
except ISE reported on construct validity to an adequate
level. The ISMI, SSMIS and SS measured test-retest
reliability, with all reaching the criterion level. Evidence
on acceptable floor and ceiling effects were not available
for any measures.

Other subscales
Several other subscales were identified in the review
including ‘stigma resistance’ in the ISMI [33], ‘positive
aspects’ in the SS [36], ‘impact of stigma’ in the ISE,
[32], ‘self-esteem’ in the SESQ [28], ‘treatment stigma’ in
the DSSS [30] and ‘stressfulness of stigma events’ in the
EDS [38]. These subscales did not clearly fit into one of
the three stigma constructs. Stigma resistance, positive
aspects and self-esteem would most closely fit with self-
stigma. Treatment stigma is measuring a related con-
struct, rather than mental illness stigma. Two other
measures of help-seeking, the stigma scale for receiving
psychological help for depression (SSRPH) [39] and self-
stigma of seeking help (SSOSH) [40], were excluded
from this review for this reason (see Figure 1). Stressful-
ness is examining the magnitude of experienced discri-
mination so would most clearly fit with this subscale.
These subscales highlight additional elements of stigma,
not covered by the perceived, experienced and self-
stigma categories, which may be useful to consider.

Discussion
This paper examined definitions of stigma, prejudice
and discrimination and presented a review of the survey
measurement of mental illness stigma. Stigma was used
as an over-arching term to incorporate stigma, prejudice
and discrimination. The review identified 14 scales
which assessed aspects of perceived, experienced and
self-stigma in 57 studies. Perceived stigma was most fre-
quently assessed in 79% of studies, followed by experi-
enced stigma in 46% of studies and self-stigma in 33%
of studies. This is in keeping with a previous review
which considered the measurement of mental illness
stigma among those with personal experience of mental
illness [11]. It found that 50% (n = 12) of studies used a
survey based measure of status loss/discrimination
(expectations), 33% (n = 8) used a survey based measure
of status loss/discrimination (experiences) and 13% (n =
3) measured emotional reactions. These categories

broadly map on to the perceived, experienced and self-
stigma categories used in this review. Although interest-
ing to see that the ranking of areas of emphasis is the
same, this should be interpreted with caution due to the
different categorisations used and as the sample includes
experimental and qualitative studies as well as those
using survey measures this underemphasises the propor-
tions for survey based measures alone (as used in this
study).

Psychometric properties were presented in this review
using an adapted version of the framework of Terwee
and colleagues [26]. No measure provides acceptable
evidence on all 5 properties. A variety of properties are
presented for each measure and judgments about the
most appropriate measure can be based considering
these properties as well as the study needs. This table
should be interpreted cautiously as reported properties
are based on those provided in the initial development
paper and those which were not identified may be pub-
lished elsewhere. Several measures including the CESQ,
ISE, DISC and EDS provided information on a limited
number of the measurement properties. These measures
cannot be recommended for use without further work
to establish these properties. Also, if not already estab-
lished (see Additional File 1) further validation is neces-
sary for all measures when used in clinical or cultural
contexts which are different from the original purpose.

Conclusions
The paper has provided an overview of commonly used
measures of personal mental
illness stigma, as a
resource to provide guidance on which measure may be
most appropriate in future research. This contributes
evidence to support the evaluation of outcomes as part
of anti-stigma campaigns or social inclusion interven-
tions, fitting with the Medical Research Council’s gui-
dance on developing
complex
interventions [41]. It builds on existing reviews by
exploring this area of stigma measurement in detail and
including recently developed measures.

and evaluating

This review has focused on survey measures. However,
as mentioned in the discussion alternative methods of
considering this topic such as qualitative and experi-
mental investigations e.g. [42,43] provide valuable mate-
rial and should be consulted by those wishing to use
non-survey based measures.

Throughout the review, stigma was categorised as per-
ceived, experienced or self stigma. These distinctions
were useful for organising the review, however many
inter-connections exist between the concepts, and there
was sometimes difficulty in judging which was the most
appropriate to use in categorising a subscale. This points
to the complex nature of stigma, as highlighted in the
introduction, and reinforces the necessary interplay of

cognitive, affective and behavioural aspects of perceived,
experienced and self stigma, in fully understanding the
individual’s position in relation to stigma.
