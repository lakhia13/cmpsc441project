Abstract
Objective: Perinatal emotional well- being is more than the presence or absence 
of depressive and anxiety disorders; it encompasses a wide range of factors that 

contribute to emotional well- being. This study compares perinatal well- being be-

tween women living in metropolitan and rural regions.
Design: Prospective, longitudinal cohort.
Participants/setting: Eight hundred and six women from Victoria and Western 
Australia recruited before 20 weeks of pregnancy and followed up to 12 months 

postpartum.
Main  outcome  measures:  Rurality  was  assessed  using  the  Modified  Monash 
Model (MM Model) with 578 in metropolitan cities MM1, 185 in regional and large 

rural  towns  MM2- MM3  and  43  in  rural  to  remote  MM4- MM7.  The  Structured 

Clinical Interview for DSM- IV (SCID- IV) was administered at recruitment to as-

sess depression, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using 

the Edinburgh Post- natal Depression Scale and the State and Trait Anxiety Scale, 

respectively.  Other  measures  included  stressful  events,  diet,  exercise,  partner 

support, parenting and sleep.
Results:  The  prevalence  of  depressive  disorders  did  not  differ  across  rurality. 
There was also no difference in breastfeeding cessation, exercise, sleep or partner 

support.  Women  living  in  rural  communities  and  who  also  had  depression  re-

ported significantly higher parenting stress than metropolitan women and lower 

access to parenting activities.
Conclusions: Our study suggests while many of the challenges of the perinatal 
period were shared between women in all areas, there were important differences 

in parenting stress and access to activities. Furthermore, these findings suggest 

that  guidelines  and  interventions  designed  for  perinatal  mental  health  should 

consider rurality.

|  INTRODU CT ION

It is increasingly accepted that emotional well- being in the 
perinatal  period  should  consider  more  than  merely  the 
presence or absence of depressive and anxiety disorders.1 
Rather, it encompasses a wide range of factors that con-
tribute to emotional well- being and are impacted by preg-
nancy and early parenting including lifestyle factors, such 
as diet, exercise and sleep, as well as stressful life events, 
partner and family support, breastfeeding and parenting 
stress.2– 5 Many of these factors are also amenable to inter-
ventions that may improve emotional well- being and may 
reduce either the likelihood or the severity of perinatal de-
pression. Equally, factors such as breastfeeding and sleep 
are frequently impacted by emerging perinatal depression, 
and  these  interactions  are  important  to  understand.6– 8 
While examining the impact of perinatal clinical depres-
sive  and  anxiety  disorders  is  critical,  many  women  have 
levels of symptomatology that do not meet DSM criteria 
for  diagnosis  of  a  psychological  disorder.  While  there  is 
research  that  is  focused  on  exploring  the  interaction  of 
these  varied  factors  potentially  associated  with  perinatal 
emotional well- being, such studies are primarily focused 
on  women  who  reside  in  metropolitan  areas.9  Including 
women who live in rural communities is important to fur-
ther  our  understanding  of  perinatal  depression  and  the 
factors associated with emotional well- being.

In  Australia,  women  in  rural  areas  represent  ap-
proximately  27%  of  births,  and  in  many  countries,  rural 
populations  may  represent  an  even  higher  proportion 
of  births.10,11  The  current  policy  and  strategic  direction 
for  service  delivery  across  Australia,  such  as  outlined  in 
Women- centred  care:  Strategic  Directions  for  Australian 
Maternity Services, articulates the principles of providing 
maternity care close to where a woman lives.12,13 However, 
in a rural setting, access to expert care in perinatal mental 
health can be limited and sometimes is non- existent.14 To 
inform policy and practice, there is a need for quality data 
to increase our understanding of how to improve perina-
tal mental health across our whole community, including 
women living rurally.

Research  outside  of  the  perinatal  period  has  shown 
women  living  rurally  during  the  child- bearing  years  are 
significantly less likely to access treatment for depression 
and anxiety.15 Research also suggests there are more bar-
riers in rural communities for women with mental rather 
than  physical  health  concerns.16  The  limited  data  avail-
able on prevalence are restricted to the postpartum period. 

What is already known on this subject:

•  Rurality is associated with more limited access 
to mental health care particularly in specialist 
areas, such as perinatal mental health

•  While  there  are  limited  cross- sectional  stud-
ies examining perinatal mental health in rural 
communities,  our  understanding  of  any  po-
tential differences for rurality in factors which 
contribute  to  perinatal  mental  health  is  very 
limited

•  Longitudinal  studies  examining  rurality  and 
depression  in  women  across  pregnancy  and 
the  postpartum  for  depression  are  limited,  yet 
given many who live in rural communities have 
increased  risk  factors  and  limited  services  for 
perinatal mental health, this research is needed

What this paper adds:

•  Across many of the associated factors that con-
tribute  to  emotional  well- being,  there  was  no 
difference  in  rural  and  metropolitan  women 
across  pregnancy  and  the  postpartum,  includ-
ing in depression

•  However, women from rural communities with 
depression  were  found  to  have  higher  parent-
ing  stress  and  also  reported  lower  access  to 
parent– infant activities. This suggests there are 
differences  in  access  and  impacts  of  perinatal 
depression in rural areas that should be consid-
ered  in  perinatal  mental  health  recommenda-
tions and care

This  has  found  that  post- natal  depression  is  higher  in 
women living in rural communities; although when socio- 
economic differences are adjusted for this, difference may 
become  less  pronounced.17– 19  Beyond  prevalence,  there 
is  little  consideration  of  the  context  or  differences  be-
tween  rural  communities.  In  the  only  systematic  review 
of perinatal depression and rurality we can find, only one 
longitudinal study was identified, and this had been un-
dertaken in Pakistan.17

There  are  a  number  of  potential  differences  experi-
enced  by  women  living  rurally  compared  with  metro-
politan  areas  in  the  identification,  access  and  treatment

for mental health in pregnancy and the postpartum peri-
od.20– 22 These may include access to specialist treatment 
and  geographical  distances  associated  with  isolation. 
Possible  differences  in  health  promoting  lifestyle  factors 
(e.g. diet, exercise, smoking, sleep and alcohol use), social 
support,  stressful  life  events  (including  family  domestic 
violence and financial hardship) and the impact of natural 
environment are all critical to perinatal mental health and 
emotional well- being. The implications of living in a rural 
environment will also differ according to the varied con-
texts and ecological heterogeneity of rural communities. 
For example, living in a remote mining area is likely to be 
a considerably different environment than living within a 
farming community, a coastal regional centre or a remote 
township.

Given the paucity of robust evidence found in the lit-
erature regarding perinatal mental health and emotional 
well- being in women living rurally, we decided to explore 
this field broadly to see where further specific studies may 
bring  additional  value.  In  this  study,  we  examine  trajec-
tories  of  women's  mental  health,  emotional  well- being, 
lifestyle and early parenting outcomes during the perina-
tal period. We aimed at assessing whether these trajecto-
ries differ by Australian geographic region, and whether 
region- specific  trajectories  impacted  by  rural  adversity 
further differ by the presence or absence of depression.

|  METHODS

2.1 

|  Sample

This  study  uses  data  from  806  perinatal  women  from  a 
prospective pregnancy cohort, the Mercy Pregnancy and 
Emotional Well- being Study (MPEWS): 578 of whom were 
recruited from two capital cities in Australia (Melbourne, 
Victoria and Perth, Western Australia) and 228 of whom 
were  recruited  from  rural  regions  mostly  in  Western 
Australia. The majority of these 228 women were recruited 
from  a  targeted  selection  of  three  WA  regions  to  ensure 
rural diversity in the sample. Specifically, these were the 
South West, Midwest and Goldfields regions of WA; each 
region  is  demographically  diverse  due  to  the  differences 
in both current and historical primary industries in each 
of  the  regions.  Women  were  recruited  before  the  20th 
week of pregnancy (i.e. early pregnancy) and followed up 
during  third  trimester,  birth,  and  6-   and  12- month  post-
partum. Women were recruited into one of three groups: 
women  taking  antidepressant  medication  in  pregnancy 
(AD exposed; n = 146), non- medicated women who met 
diagnostic  criteria  for  a  depressive  disorder  at  recruit-
ment (depressed; n = 86) and control women (n = 574). 
Further details of the study are described in the published 

study  protocol.23  Mercy  Health  Human  Research  Ethics 
Committee  and  the  WA  South  Metropolitan  Health 
Human  Research  Ethics  Committee  both  approved  this 
study,  and  all  participants  provided  informed,  written 
consent.

2.2 

|  Measures

2.2.1 

|  Mental health outcomes

At  recruitment,  the  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for 
DSM- IV  (SCID- IV)  Mood  disorders  schedule24  was  ad-
ministered. In addition, self- report symptom measures of 
depression, anxiety and stressful life events were assessed 
at recruitment, third trimester, and 6-  and 12- month post-
partum.  Depressive  symptoms  were  measured  using  the 
Edinburgh Post- natal Depression Scale (EPDS).25 This has 
been validated for use with Australian women during the 
perinatal  period.26  State  anxiety  symptoms  were  meas-
ured  using  the  state  subscale  of  the  State– Trait  Anxiety 
Inventory  (STAI).27  This  has  also  been  validated  for  use 
in Australian women in pregnancy.28 Stressful life events 
were  assessed  using  a  perinatally  adapted  Stressful  Life 
Events  Scale,  which  includes  24  common  stressful  life 
events.29 The sum of the number of life events at each time 
point was used in this study.

2.2.2 

|  Maternal lifestyle outcomes

Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality  Index  at  early  pregnancy,  third  trimester,  and 
6-   and  12- month  postpartum.  The  PSQI  consists  of  19 
items  and  is  a  self- report  measure  of  sleep,  which  can 
produce  a  global  sleep  quality  score.  Higher  scores  in-
dicate  poorer  sleep  quality,  and  a  score  greater  than 
five  has  been  used  to  indicate  poor  sleep.30  The  PSQI 
has been validated for use during pregnancy.31 Weekly 
exercise  frequency  was  assessed  at  early  pregnancy 
and  third  trimester,  and  at  6-   and  12- month  postpar-
tum.  Specifically,  women  are  asked  to  self- report  the 
number of days per week they exercised in response to 
‘Over  the  last  month,  how  many  days  per  week  would 
you  do  at  least  30  minutes  of  vigorous  physical  activ-
ity  (including  activities  such  as  walking  briskly,  riding 
a  bike,  gardening,  tennis,  swimming,  running,  etc.?)’. 
Weekly serves of fruit and vegetables and the number of 
monthly take- away meals were assessed at third trimes-
ter, and 6-  and 12- month postpartum using items from 
the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  National  Nutrition 
Survey.32  Social  support  from  a  partner  was  measured 
using  the  Social  Support  Effectiveness  Scale,  which  is 

GALBALLY et al. 
 
a 10- item self- report scale assessing the usefulness and 
timeliness  of  both  emotional  and  task  and  responsibil-
ity support provided by a partner specifically during the 
perinatal period.33 The items are summed, with higher 
scores indicating higher levels of perceived effectiveness 
of support.

2.2.3 

|  Post- partum parenting outcomes

Breastfeeding cessation data were collected at 6-  and 12- 
month  postpartum.  Breastfeeding  was  the  provision  of 
the mother's milk to the baby and could be via expressed 
milk  or  directly  from  the  mother.  At  6-   and  12- month 
postpartum, stress experienced due to the role of parent-
ing was assessed using the fourth edition Parenting Stress 
Index- Short Form (PSI- 4- SF),34 which is a 36- item index 
yielding a total score of overall parenting stress and three 
subscales  (Difficult  Child,  Parent  Distress  and  Parent– 
child Dysfunctional Interactions). Percentile scores can be 
derived from raw scores. Internal consistency of the total 
score  on  the  PSI  is  strong.35  In  this  study,  we  utilise  the 
percentile score for the total PSI.

2.2.4 

|  Region remoteness

We  used  the  Modified  Monash  Model  (MM  Model)36 
to  classify  remoteness.  This  Model  categorises  rela-
tive  access  to  health  resources  and  services  indicated 
by  both  the  geographical  region  (Australian  Statistical 
Geographic  Standard- Remoteness  Area),37  and  road 
distance  and  population  size  of  reference  cities,  towns 
and  communities.  The  MM  Model  classifies  regions  of 
Australia  as  metropolitan  areas  (MM1,  71.33%  of  the 
Australian population), regional centres (MM2, 8.99%), 
large  rural  towns  (MM3,  6.50%),  medium  rural  towns 
(MM4, 3.97%), small rural towns (MM5, 7.27%), remote 
communities (MM6, 1.17%) and very remote communi-
ties  (MM7,  0.77%).38  Due  to  smaller  numbers  in  some 
regions and similarities with respect to access to mental 
health and perinatal mental health services, we combine 
MM2  and  MM3  (MM2- MM3)  where  there  is  access  to 
specialist mental health but not perinatal mental health, 
and, separately, MM4 through MM7 (MM4- MM7) where 
local  mental  health  care  is  predominantly  delivered  in 
primary care. We compare these groups to MM1 where 
there  is  access  close  by  to  specialist  perinatal  mental 
health  care,  such  as  public  mother  baby  units.  Similar 
differences  in  access  to  specialist  maternity  and  paedi-
atric/child health exist across these three groups within 
our sample areas.

2.2.5 

|  Covariates

Maternal  age,  ethnicity,  parity,  education  and  em-
ployment  were  collected  at  recruitment  in  early  preg-
nancy. Responses for ethnicity were then coded into the 
broad  ethnicity  categories  of  the  Australian  Standard 
Classification  of  Cultural  and  Ethnic  Groups.39 
Antidepressant  type,  usage,  dosage  and  timing  dur-
ing  pregnancy  was  self- reported  by  women,  as  well  as 
obtained  from  hospital  records  at  delivery.  Perinatal 
community support was assessed using items from the 
Communities That Care Youth Survey, modified for the 
perinatal context.40 These items assessed mothers' per-
ceptions of accessibility to six common community peri-
natal resources and services (1— Very difficult to access, 
5— Very easy to access).

2.3 

|  Statistical analyses

We first provide sociodemographic characteristics for the 
women  by  grouped  MM  region  (i.e.  MM1,  MM2- MM3 
2  and 
and  MM4- MM7)  and  compare  the  groups  using  χ
ANOVA tests at each time point. Sociodemographic char-
acteristics  that  differed  between  regions  were  added  to 
models  as  covariates.  We  also  describe  the  community 
and social support characteristics of the regions.

To address the aim of this study, repeat measurement 
outcomes  for  maternal  mental  health,  lifestyle  and  post- 
partum  parenting  were  modelled  using  mixed- effects 
linear  models  for  continuous  outcomes  and  generalised 
estimating equations for binary (binomial, logit link) and 
count  (negative  binomial,  log  link)  outcomes.  Time  was 
modelled  continuously  using  follow- up  counts  (i.e.  1,  2, 
4 and 5) as an index for time, and quadratic effects were 
also  modelled  (i.e.  Time2)  for  outcomes  with  more  than 
two follow- up points of data. For each outcome, two mod-
els  were  tested  as  follows:  an  initial model  that  most  ac-
curately described the pattern of change in the outcome 
during the perinatal period by MM region (i.e. change by 
region  models),  which  included  an  interaction  term  be-
tween  the  highest  order  polynomial  of  Time  with  MM 
region, and a final adjusted model, which included fixed 
effects of rurality and depression, and adjustment for co-
variates.  In  all  models,  MM2- MM3  and  M4- MM7  were 
each  compared  with  MM1  as  the  reference  group.  Non- 
significant interactions terms were omitted prior to report-
ing and interpreting all initial and final models. In mixed 
linear models, random effects for intercept and slope were 
estimated and correlated using an unstructured error co-
variance assumption. All analyses were conducted using 
Stata 16.

3.1 

|  Sociodemographic characteristics

Across the seven MM regions, 578 (71.7%) were living in 
metropolitan  areas  (MM1),  71  (8.8%)  in  regional  centres 
(MM2), 114 (14.1%) in large rural towns (MM3), 9 (1.1%) 
in  medium  rural  towns  (MM4),  24  (3.0%)  in  small  rural 
towns  (MM5),  3  (0.4%)  in  remote  communities  (MM6) 
and 7 (0.9%) in very remote communities (MM7). Table 1 
displays the sociodemographic characteristics of the sam-
ple across the three MM region groups. The age of women 
in the sample ranged between 18 and 48, with an average 
of 32.06 (SD = 4.67), which did not vary between MM1, 
MM2- MM3  and  MM4- MM7.  The  overall  prevalence  of 
a  diagnosed  depressive  disorder  was  17.9%,  which  also 
did  not  vary  between  the  regions.  The  sample  were  pre-
dominantly  from  Oceanic  and  European  backgrounds, 

with  significantly  more  diversity  observed  in  the  MM1 
compared  with  MM2- MM3.  More  women  in  the  MM1 
compared  with  MM2- MM3  were  nulliparous,  and  more 
women  from  MM1  reported  a  university  education 
when  compared  with  both  MM2- MM3  and  MM4- MM7. 
Overall, rates of smoking and alcohol consumption were 
low  and  did  not  differ  significantly  across  the  regions. 
Although the proportion of depression was similar across 
the  groups,  the  proportion  of  women  taking  antidepres-
sants in MM4- MM7 (7.0%) was less than half that reported 
by  women  in  the  MM1  (19.7%)  and  MM2- MM3  (15.7%) 
groups; however, this apparent difference in proportions 
did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.069).

In terms of perinatal community support, women in all 
groups reported relatively easy access to mothers' groups 
and maternal and child health centres. However, on aver-
age, women living in MM4- MM7 regions reported less ease 
of access to early learning activities, such as parent– infant

with women in MM1 and MM2- MM3 regions. In terms of 
perceived  adequacy  of  social  support,  there  were  no  dif-
ferences in reported support from parents and parents- in- 
law. Overall, 56.5% of the sample reported having a parent 
or parent- in- law living close by. However, more women in 
MM4- MM7 reported having parents or parents- in- law liv-
ing within the same state, but not nearby, compared with 
more women in both MM1 and MM2- MM3 regions who 
reported  having  parents  and  parents- in- law  living  inter-
state or overseas.

health, lifestyle and post- partum parenting outcomes for 
the MM region groups, derived from the initial change by 
region  regression  models  with  the  best- fitting  modelling 
for time (i.e. linear or quadratic).

3.2.1 

|  Mental health outcomes

Figures 1a– c display region- average trajectories of depres-
sive symptoms, state anxiety symptoms and the number of 
stressful life events, respectively, and the model estimates 
are  reported  in  Table  2.  There  were  no  significant  quad-
ratic effects of Time detected in the mental health outcome 
models.  Although  average  state  anxiety  symptoms  were 
reducing by a small amount at each subsequent follow- up 
for women in all groups, depressive symptoms were stable 
across the perinatal period. In Figure 1a, average depres-
sive symptoms (EPDS) were significantly lower in women 
from  MM2- MM3  than  MM1.  These  patterns  of  mental 
health  were  not  different  after  adding  covariates  in  the 
final adjusted model. Compared with the steadily reducing 
number of stressful life events reported by women in MM1 
across the perinatal period, women in MM2- MM3 reported 
a  significantly  stronger  reduction  in  stressful  events  at 
each subsequent follow- up. In the final adjusted model for 
stressful life events, depression was associated with more 
stressful life events for women in all groups; however, this 
effect was significantly stronger in women with depression

living in MM2- MM3 than MM1. There were no three- way 
interactions  between  time  point,  region  and  depressive 
disorder,  suggesting  that  MM  region- average  trajectories 
of mental health were not significantly different between 
women with and without a depressive disorder.

|  Lifestyle outcomes

Figures  1d– h display region- average trajectories of life-
style outcomes, specifically global sleep quality, days per 
week  of  moderate  exercise,  weekly  fruit  and  vegetable 
intake,  monthly  take- away  meal  intake  and  perceived 
adequacy  of  partner  support,  respectively,  with  model-
ling estimates reported in Table  3. Global sleep quality 
became poorer between early pregnancy and 12- month 
postpartum, inclusive, for women in all groups; however, 
the  rate  at  which  sleep  quality  became  poorer  slowed, 
and  improved  between  6-   and  12- month  postpartum. 
These  patterns  of  change  in  sleep  quality  did  not  dif-
fer  by  MM  region;  however,  depression  was  associated 
with  significantly  poorer  sleep  quality.  The  number  of 
days spent exercising was steady for women in all groups 
during the perinatal period. In the final adjusted model, 
for  all  groups,  depression  was  associated  with  15%  av-
erage  reduction  in  the  weekly  rate  of  exercising  across 
the perinatal period. Weekly fruit and vegetable intake 
reduced  significantly  from  the  third  trimester  to  the  6- 
month postpartum, but the reduction weakened signifi-
cantly  to  12- month  postpartum.  This  pattern  remained 
in the final adjusted model; however, there was a signifi-
cant  time  *  MM  region  interaction,  such  that  fruit  and 
vegetable  intake  between  third  trimester  and  6- month 
postpartum  did  not  reduce  as  strongly  for  women  in 
both  MM2- MM3  and  MM4- MM7  when  compared  with 
women  in  MM1.  The  number  of  take- away  meals  per 
month increased by 95% from the baseline rate between 
third  trimester  and  the  postpartum  for  women  in  both 
the MM1 and MM2- MM3, but the initial increase slowed 
by 22% between 6-  and 12- month postpartum. Compared 
with MM1 and MM2- MM3 regions, monthly take- away 
meal intake did not increase between third trimester and 
6- month  postpartum  for  women  in  the  MM4- MM7  but 
did increase between 6-  and 12- month postpartum. This 
pattern  of  monthly  take- away  meals  did  not  change  in

Perceived social support effectiveness received from a 
partner decreased significantly between third trimester in 
to  the  postpartum  for  women  in  all  groups,  but  this  re-
duction slowed significantly in the postpartum across the 
sample.  Following  addition  of  covariates,  these  patterns 
in  social  support  effectiveness  did  not  differ  in  the  final

significantly by MM region and depression.

|  Post- partum parenting outcomes

Figure  1i,j  display  region- average  trajectories  of  breast-
feeding  cessation  and  parenting  stress,  respectively,  and 

the  model  estimates  reported  in  Table  4.  The  odds  of 
breastfeeding  cessation  increased  significantly  between 
6-   and  12- month  postpartum  for  women  in  all  groups, 
remaining significant in the final adjusted models. There 
were no differences in these significantly higher odds by 
MM region and depression. For parenting stress, the ini-
tial change model by region showed no significantly dif-
ferent trajectories between MM regions. In fact, parenting 
stress increased significantly, on average, for women in all 
groups.  In  the  final  adjusted  model,  the  sample- average 
increase  in  parenting  stress  between  6  and  12 months 
remained,  and  depression  was  a  significant  predictor  of 
higher parenting stress across the sample. In addition, av-
erage parenting stress across the postpartum was signifi-
cantly  higher  for  women  in  the  MM2- MM3  region  than 
in  the  MM1  region.  Overall,  parenting  stress  trajectory

|  DISCUSSIO N

This study compared women from metropolitan areas (i.e. 
MM1)  with  women  from  two  distinct  rural  regions  (i.e. 
MM2- MM3: Regional Centres and large rural towns and 
MM4- MM7: Medium and small rural towns, and remote 
and very remote communities) within a pregnancy cohort 
study using the same protocol including measures of men-
tal health, lifestyle and parenting. Comparing these three 
groups showed that at recruitment, there was no difference 
in the prevalence of those with current depressive disor-
ders measured using a diagnostic clinical interview. While 
depressive disorders did not differ between these groups of 
women, those who resided in rural areas had trajectories 
of  lower  symptoms  of  both  depression  and  anxiety  over 
the  perinatal  period  and  reported  fewer  stressful  events 
than women residing in metropolitan regions. However, 
women  in  rural  communities  with  depression  reported 
significantly  higher  parenting  stress  than  metropolitan 
women with depression or non- depressed women across 
all jurisdictions. Furthermore, it was those in MM2- MM3 
regional  centres  who  were  more  significantly  impacted 
than those from more isolated communities.

There  was  no  difference  across  the  perinatal  period 
in timing of breastfeeding cessation or partner and fam-
ily support in rural compared with metropolitan women 
whether  depressed  or  not.  There  was  no  difference  for 
maternal  reported  sleep  or  exercise  across  pregnancy 
and  the  postpartum  for  rural  and  metropolitan  women. 
Women living in rural communities did have higher fruit 
and  vegetable  intake  in  the  perinatal  period.  Women  in 
MM4- MM7 reported less access to parenting activities and 
supports. Parenting activities and supports, such as joint 
music activities, supported group play activities, and other 
supports  have  been  associated  with  improving  bonding 

There are very few longitudinal pregnancy cohort stud-
ies conducted in women in rural communities and even 
fewer with a metropolitan comparison sample and with a 
focus on depression. Only one longitudinal study was iden-
tified  in  a  systematic  review  of  perinatal  depression  and 
rurality, and since that review, while additional rural lon-
gitudinal cohort studies have been identified, none have 
a metropolitan comparison group or robust measurement 
of depression.17,42,43 These studies have also been under-
taken in the context of low-  and middle- income countries 
making  comparison  with  rural  communities  within  a 
high- income country, such as Australia, problematic.

As previously identified, there is a paucity of previous 
research to add understanding to our findings. One study 
explored the experience of women in rural communities 
and perinatal mental health and identified frequent expe-
riences  of  delays  in  recognition  and  access  to  treatment 
for  perinatal  mental  health  disorders,  lack  of  access  to 
psychological support and lack of continuity of care from 
services across the perinatal period.44 This 2015 study also 
identified themes for women living in rural communities 
of  isolation,  stoicism  and  identifying  the  importance  of 
chores competing with self- care. Similar to our findings, 
this  study  also  highlighted  the  importance  of  informal 
care networks.44 Another study also supported the impor-
tance of extended family as critical in rural areas for the 
care of women with mental health issues in the perinatal 
period.44,45

There  have  been  a  number  of  innovative  programs 
trialled to address the frequent gap in access to specialist 
perinatal mental health interventions in rural areas, and 
these include services embedded within the community,46 
within the local delivery of maternity care47 and online.48 
What is frequently cited as important is services that are 
acceptable  to  women  and  their  families,  link  with  local 
resources  and  importantly  enhanced  informal  networks 
of support to reduce isolation.44,47 In addition to the areas

addressed  by  these  programs,  our  findings  suggest  that 
women living rurally may have increased parenting stress. 
These findings suggest that future support and interven-
tions need to be tailored to not only reducing mental health 
symptoms but also increasing support for parenting.

In general, the relationship between maternal depres-
sion  and  parenting  stress  has  been  identified  across  a 
number of studies, but these have drawn predominantly 
on metropolitan samples.49 Our findings suggest this is of 
even  greater  importance  for  women  living  in  rural  com-
munities,  and  it  is  notable  that  those  in  more  isolated 
areas found it more difficult to access a range of parent– 
infant activities although they reported feeling supported 
by partners and family. Likewise, our findings of a stron-
ger relationship between stressful life events and depres-
sion in women living rurally are important to note. This 
may suggest the future development of targeted perinatal 
mental  health  support  for  these  women  that  includes  a 
focus on parenting and identifies those impacted by stress-
ful  events  and  isolation  from  supports  for  parenting.  As 
our study sample was relatively homogeneous, future re-
search exploring these issues should include more cultur-
ally  and  linguistically  diverse  women,  women  from  first 
nations and single parents in rural contexts.

There are a number of limitations with this study. We 
did not include measurement of access to mental health 
services  and  interventions  and  had  no  measure  of  the 
women's perceived isolation. In addition, due to the low 
numbers in our cohort, only limited analysis was able to 

be  undertaken  comparing  these  women  across  different 
rural  and  remote  contexts.  Although  the  common  mea-
sures  used,  such  as  stressful  life  events  scale,  State  and 
Trait  Anxiety  Inventory  and  the  Edinburgh  Post- natal 
Depression Scale, have been validated in Australian preg-
nant women, this validation has not necessarily included 
a  sample  with  women  from  rural  communities.  The  di-
versity  in  the  sample  from  an  education,  marital  status 
and ethnicity perspective was small, and as such, we are 
unable  to  comment  on  how  our  findings  may  relate  to 
specific groups of women in rural communities, such as 
single parents or different ethnic groups. Finally, exercise 
measured  was  self- reported  recreational  exercise,  and 
this tool may miss incidental exercise for women living in 
rural communities, such working on farms.

|  CONCLUSIO N

Our  study  found  that  many  of  the  previous  findings 
around perinatal mental well- being in metropolitan sam-
ples are similar for rural samples. This included an asso-
ciation between depression and poorer sleep, a decline in 
exercise and stressful life events. For all women across the 
perinatal period, we demonstrated declining fruit and veg-
etable intake, perceived partner support, and similar rates 
and  timing  of  breastfeeding  cessation.  However,  parent-
ing stress was higher in those outside metropolitan cities, 
and access to parenting activities and supports was lowest 

GALBALLY et al. 
 
in those furthest from cities. The findings in our explora-
tory study suggest further research into perinatal mental 
health and emotional well- being must include considera-
tion of the impact of rurality. In addition, policy- makers, 
researchers and service delivery should continue to con-
sider  key  differences  for  rural  families  including  within 
future policies.

Supporting perinatal emotional well- being and mental 
health  is  critical  for  women  living  rurally,  their  families 
and  their  children.  Investment  in  further  research  is  re-
quired  to  address  the  current  knowledge  gaps  including 
understanding how factors associated with women's peri-
natal  mental  health  and  well- being  when  living  in  rural 
communities may be interrelated and what interventions 
may be helpful. Ensuring models of care are appropriate 
and tailored for different communities is essential for eq-
uitable outcomes. While access to specialist care is critical, 
this needs to be delivered in a way that is cognisant and 
tailored to the needs of different communities rather a one 
size fits all approach.
