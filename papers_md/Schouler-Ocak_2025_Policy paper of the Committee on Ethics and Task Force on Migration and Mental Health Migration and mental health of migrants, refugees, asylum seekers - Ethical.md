Abstract

Background. International migration is a complex phenomenon of global and historical
relevance. It includes voluntary, forced, and workforce migration, shaped by diverse determin-
ants. Push factors comprise war, persecution, and political instability, while pull factors include
stability, economic opportunities, education, and favorable living conditions. Forced migration
is frequently associated with displacement and a disproportionate burden of mental health
disorders, which are urgent yet difficult to address due to structural, cultural, and legal barriers.
Methods. Evidence demonstrates that restricted health care access exacerbates psychiatric
disorders, while treatment delays contribute to poorer outcomes. Barriers include administrative
limitations, linguistic and cultural differences, stigma, and resource shortages. This policy paper
was developed by the Committee on Ethics and the Task Force on Migration and Mental Health
of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA). Relevant literature was reviewed and combined
with the professional expertise of committee members. The draft was subsequently evaluated by
the Publication Committee and the EPA Board, and revised accordingly.
Results. Ethical principles in refugee care are insufficiently implemented in many European
countries. Core principles of medical ethics – beneficence, respect for autonomy, non-malefi-
cence, and justice – as well as the obligation to advance psychiatric standards and apply
psychiatric expertise for societal benefit, are inconsistently upheld.
Conclusions. The primary duty of physicians is to promote health and well-being through
competent, timely, and compassionate care. The EPA therefore advocates coordinated strategies
to mitigate the mental health consequences of war, displacement, and trauma, and to secure
equitable access to psychiatric services for migrants and refugees.

Introduction

The principles of medical ethics include beneficence, respect for patient (autonomy), non-
maleficence, justice, the imperative to improve psychiatric practice standards, and the application
of psychiatric expertise in service to society [1]. This includes striving for equity in the prevention,
treatment, and rehabilitation of psychiatric disorders, and ensuring fair treatment for all individuals

[2, 3]). In many European countries, healthcare disparities among
racialized, minoritized, and ethnic groups, as well as diverse people
have been identified as a major public health concern.

International migration is not a single homogenous process, but
a universal and historical phenomenon. Migration encompasses
various forms, and due to multiple reasons such as forced migra-
tion, voluntary migration, workforce migration, economic migra-
tion, mobility, and international migration. Pull and push factors
play an essential role in migration. Push factors include war,
political instability, famine, and drought, while pull factors include
political stability, job opportunities, natural resources, better edu-
cational, economy, and better climate. A comprehensive review of
the literature by Brennan et al. [4] identified various push and pull
factors at the macro- (global and national), meso- (professional),
and micro- (personal) levels. Interestingly, many factors driving
migration to the UK also drive migration from the UK to other
countries and are relevant for all high-income countries [5]. These
factors include poor working conditions, employment opportun-
ities, better training and development opportunities, better quality
of life, desire for a life change, and personal financial gain. Thus,
migration can be a voluntary decision influenced by the social,
economic, and political contexts of the home country, or enforced
by individual persecution, discrimination, war, or famine, or per-
ceived opportunities in the destination country.

Although often used interchangeably by the general public,
there are important distinctions between the terms “migrant” and
“refugee,” which should be clarified. Both terms have become
derogatory in the recent political discourse in many countries,
and suggestions have been made that lesser stigmatizing terms,
such as one who migrates or one who seeks refuge [6]. While there
is no formal legal definition of an international migrant, most
experts agree that an international migrant is someone who
changes their country of usual residence, irrespective of the reason
for migration or legal status (UN). Generally, a distinction is made
between short-term or temporary migration, covering movements
lasting between 3 and 12 months, and long-term or permanent
migration, referring to a change of country of residence for one year
or more.

Refugees are individuals who are outside their country of origin
due to fear of persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or other
circumstances that have seriously disturbed public order and, as a
result, require international protection. The refugee definition is
found in the 1951 Convention, regional refugee instruments, and
the UNHCR’s Statute (United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees).

Migration itself can be voluntary or involuntary and/or forced,
i.e., to escape persecution, harassment, or danger, or due to dis-
placement. More people have been forced to flee their homes than
ever before, with 110 million individuals displaced worldwide,
according to a 2023 report by the United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees [7]. This is the highest number since World War
II. Seventy percent of refugees are hosted by neighboring countries,
and 40% of all refugees are children. Up to 80% of these refugees live
in low- and middle-income countries, which have limited capacity
to provide housing, education, and general health and mental
health services [7]. Climate change is an increasingly significant
factor driving displacement, further exacerbating the vulnerability
of those already forced to flee by increasing food and economic
insecurity and creating additional barriers to accessing health and
social services. [8] Forced displacement from conflict zones has
significantly increased in the last decade due to multiple factors [9].

In 2023, 448.8 million people lived in Europe, 27.3 (6%) millions
of whom were not European citizens. In addition, 42.4 (9%) million
people were born outside Europe [10]. Reasons for living in Europe
include family, work, asylum, and education. The employment rate
in the EU among the working-age population is higher for EU
citizens (77.1%), than for non-EU citizens (61.9%) in 2022. The
forcibly displaced and stateless population in Europe is projected to
increase by 2% in 2024, reaching 24.9 million people. The war in
Ukraine is exacting a brutal toll, with an estimated 5.8 million
refugees across the region. With the European Union (EU)‘s Tem-
porary Protection of Ukrainian refugees extended until March
2025, EU States will continue hosting refugees and providing
protection and access to vital services, including education, health,
and employment [11].

Mental Health of Migrants and Refugees

Research on the mental health of migrants and refugees has largely
focused on the three phases of pre-migration, migration, and post-
migration [12], as well as a five-phase model encompassing pre-
departure, journey, interception, destination, and return [13]. A
majority of forced migrants are internally displaced people who
often have significant mental health problems, which, although
urgent, are difficult to manage due to numerous obstacles [14]. A
growing body of evidence indicates that a large proportion of
migrants and refugees suffer from the consequences of traumatic
events and develop mental disorders such as post-traumatic stress
disorder, depressive and anxiety disorders, and relapses into psych-
otic episodes [15]. Beyond childhood trauma, there is increasing
evidence that bullying, social exclusion, and discrimination during
adolescence and adulthood have been linked to an increased risk of
developing psychotic disorders. Such forms of trauma may also
contribute to the elevated risk of psychosis among migrants or
individuals with visible minority status [16]. A substantial increase
in the risk of developing non-affective psychosis has been observed
in those exposed to trauma or discrimination, with the highest risk
associated with vulnerability to ethnic discrimination, as indicated
by visible minority status [17, 18].

A recent meta-analysis of international studies on serious men-
tal disorders among refugees and asylum seekers found that the
most prevalent disorder was major depressive disorder (MDD)
(32%), followed by PTSD (31%), recurrent episodes of MDD
(16%), and bipolar disorders (BPD_ (5%). The prevalence of
psychotic disorders was 1% [19]. Similar findings were reported
in a meta-analysis of research conducted in Germany, with PTSD at
29.9% (95% CI 20.8–38.7%) and depressive symptoms at 39.8%
(95% CI 29.8–50.1%) [20]. Another systematic review and meta-
analysis by Lindert et al. [21] found that the rate of mental disorders
among refugees was twice as high as among economic migrants in
Europe, with 44% of refugees suffering from depression, 40% from
anxiety disorders, and 36% from PTSD [21]. Similarly, Steel et al.
[22] reported prevalence rates of 30.6% for PTSD and 30.8% for
depression in adult refugees, compared to rates of 1–12% for both
disorders in the general population [23]. These data suggest that
nearly one in three people who have experienced conflict suffer
from a psychological trauma disorder.

Morina et al. [24] highlighted that civilians affected by war are at
an increased risk of mental health problems,
including post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Koenen
et al. [25], based on the results of a WHO Mental Health Survey,
demonstrated that PTSD can be particularly long-lasting in the

European Psychiatry

context of war. The effects of the current crisis on mental health
may therefore be enduring [26].

Furthermore, forcibly displaced individuals from countries with
severe human rights violations have a higher prevalence of psycho-
pathological symptoms [27]. The consequences can be long-lasting,
with studies showing that a history of depression and PTSD
increases the risk of dementia [28]. Gender-based violence, which
is often underreported due to social stigma and inadequate treat-
ment options, further exacerbates the psychological burden in
affected regions, both in the short and long term [29, 30]. This
increased risk may not only result from war trauma but may also be
influenced by socio-economic factors following displacement
[31]. The findings of a cross-sectional study of refugee women
who experienced multiple severe traumas related to war in their
home countries and danger encountered during their migration
suggest that family violence was key to their current mental health
problems [32]. Therefore, culturally sensitive assessment and treat-
ment need to place special emphasis on these family dynamics.

In a study conducted in Turkey, Başterzi [33] found that the
most common psychological problems among refugees included
psychosis, anxiety disorders, PTSD, and depression. Refugee chil-
dren are also vulnerable to behavioral disorders, addiction, intro-
version, and tendencies towards crime and violence [34].

Tarricone et al. [35] found that the cumulative effect of social
disadvantage before, during, and after migration is associated with
an increased likelihood of psychosis in migrants, regardless of
ethnicity or length of stay in the host country. Public health
initiatives that address the social disadvantages faced by migrants
throughout the migration process, as well as post-migration psy-
chological support, could help reduce the excess incidence of
psychosis among migrants. A Canadian study also found that a
sense of belonging to Canada was a significant predictor of mental
health [36].

In a scoping review, Hilario et al. [37] identified that the mental
health of young migrants is shaped by a myriad of social and eco-
nomic factors at individual, family, community, and societal levels.
The review highlighted the need for mental health services to focus on
first-generation migrant youth and those who migrated before the age
of six, to address high levels of stress or the likelihood of mental illness.
In addition, the mental health of young people after migration is
influenced by their parents’ settlement experiences in terms of
employment, household income, and integration. Parental depres-
sion, in particular, is consistently associated with poorer mental health
outcomes in migrant youth. This suggests that the experiences of
young people living with parental mental illness should be a key focus
for future research and targeted interventions [37].

Improving Mental Health Care for Migrants and Refugees

As discussed above, there is considerable research evidence that
both migrant and refugee groups are particularly vulnerable to
receiving substandard healthcare, partly due to racist and discrim-
inatory attitudes, behaviors, and policies within the health system
[16, 38, 39].

Furthermore, having fled war and conflict, endured torture or
traumatic events, and living with ongoing uncertainty [40], these
individuals often face access barriers to health care and are at high
risk of experiencing long-term poor physical and mental health
outcomes in their host countries [41]. A meta-analysis and system-
atic review have highlighted that racism is strongly associated with
poor health outcomes, with the relationship particularly strong for

mental health, and less so for physical health [42]. Racism can be
defined as organized system within societies that cause avoidable
and unfair inequalities in power, resources, capacities, and oppor-
tunities across racial or ethnic groups [43]. Several studies have
highlighted the negative impact of racial discrimination on mental
health, particularly concerning the development of affective, psych-
otic, and substance use disorders [42, 44, 45].

According to Bäärnhielm and Schouler-Ocak [46], there is a
significant gap between the mental health care needs of migrants,
refugees, and minority groups and the services available to them,
emphasizing the need to improve accessibility and adapt systems,
services, and interventions. Health professionals play a crucial role
in ensuring the quality of care, and their ability to meet new
challenges depends on their competence, knowledge, skills, and
attitudes toward their patients’ needs. To enhance their capabilities,
mental health professionals require training in cultural diversity
and structural competence. Cultural competence encompasses pro-
fessional values,
including sensitivity, non-discrimination, and
responsiveness to the psychiatric needs of all patients. Psychiatrists
may enhance their intercultural performance during the mental
health assessment using the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI)
of the DSM-5. It is supportive in clinical practice, where psychiat-
rists must consider each patient within the context of the patient’s
culture and their own cultural values and prejudices [47]. Cultural
competence is vital for understanding, treating, and supporting
migrant and refugee patients and for addressing racial discrimin-
ation. “Cultural competence” is typically described as a multidi-
mensional set of cognitive orientations, cultural knowledge, skills,
sensitivities, and attitudes [48]. (Self-)critical reflection, including
an examination of internalized prejudices and value hierarchies, is
crucial [49]. The development and application of cultural compe-
tence appear to be influenced less by organizational characteristics
and more by the level of the individual actors. Therefore, in addition
to personnel development, appropriate organizational structures
and an economic incentive system are required to promote socio-
cultural diversity within mental health care systems [49].

Barriers to Access Mental Health Care

Difficulties in accessing healthcare often exacerbate existing mental
disorders [50] and delays in help-seeking can produce poor out-
comes. There are a number of factors at play: from language
barriers, poor knowledge of the healthcare systems in new settings,
stigma of mental illnesses, differing explanatory models, anxieties
regarding the perspectives in the host country [51, 52], and so forth
Language barriers and intercultural communication challenges are
significant obstacles, making it much harder for individuals to
access the healthcare system. The availability of qualified interpret-
ers, language and cultural mediators is inconsistent, and they are
not regularly utilized and not available. This can lead to misunder-
standings, misdiagnoses, and inappropriate treatment, with poten-
tially serious consequences for the individuals involved [51].In
intercultural psychotherapy, language plays a crucial role, as many
languages lack equivalent terms for various mental disorders
[53]. For example, the term “depression” does not exist in many
languages, even though sadness and unhappiness are recognized
and described [7, 53, 54]. Consequently, psychotherapists and
psychiatrists must be sensitive to cultural and contextual commu-
nication aspects [55]. Without interpreters, effective communica-
tion between professionals and patients from different cultural

arriving in the country is therefore a crucial strategy for safeguard-
ing the health of the individual and the wider community.

Inequalities between migrants and non-migrants in terms of
health and access to healthcare services persist in many European
countries. Legal barriers make it difficult for refugees and migrants
to access healthcare. Economic constraints also play a role, as many
migrants cannot afford healthcare costs [56].

In Europe, healthcare delivery and access are, not surprisingly,
heterogeneous [56], making comparisons challenging. Data is often
lacking, complicating the ability to draw firm conclusions. Coun-
tries apply different standards when prioritizing the healthcare
needs of refugees, with some focusing on mental health care,
preventive care (vaccinations), and long-term care, especially for
an aging migrant population [56, 57].

Political, social, and legal stressors can hinder the integration
process [58] as well as an understanding of the new cultures and
acculturation. Social factors such as grief, culture shock, social
exclusion, and a mismatch between the expectations and attitudes
of the host country also affect acculturation [53, 59] and insecurities
regarding perspectives in the host country can stop people from
seeking help [47, 60].

Growing inequalities in resources within and between coun-
tries, the construction of border walls and tighter border controls,
and a lack of perspectives in the host country further complicate
the integration of migrants and refugees [61]. Additionally, public
hostility towards migrants and refugees is increasing in many
European countries, making them increasingly unwelcome and
placing them in a political atmosphere that frightens them. This
tightening of reception conditions, driven by fears of terrorism,
leads to insecure residence permits, social exclusion, and difficul-
ties in accessing psychosocial care. In this context, ethical prin-
ciples and the foundations of modern ethical codes are often
compromised.

Asylum Seekers Benefit Act

European Union legislation stipulates that Member States have a
legal obligation to provide for the social and health needs of asylum
seekers. This includes granting access to healthcare services. In
September 2020, the European Commission introduced a New Pact
on Migration and Asylum, setting out a fairer approach to man-
aging migration and asylum. The Pact includes provisions for
health checks to facilitate the early identification of migrants’
healthcare needs [62]. In Germany, e.g., the social and health
benefits available to asylum-seekers are governed by the Asylum
Seeker Benefits Act. Asylum-seekers are individuals who have
submitted an asylum application and are awaiting the outcome of
their asylum determination process [63]. Previously, healthcare
entitlement was limited to the first 18 months or until permanent
protection status (refugee status or subsidiary protection) was
granted. However, this period has now been extended to 36 months.
The limited entitlements cover healthcare for acute illnesses and
pain, preventive services and immunizations, as well as services
related to pregnancy and childbirth (AsylbLG Art. 4). Access to
further, mostly specialized, services can be granted on a case-by-
case basis (AsylbLG Art. 6).

In contrast, Italy guarantees two constitutional rights to every-
one residing in the country, whether permanently or temporarily:
healthcare and education. While it may not be possible to address
factors before and during migration, post-migration factors can
certainly be addressed. Ensuring a dignified welcome for people

It is important to note that in many countries and settings, civil
society and NGOs often take the lead in demonstrating the social
feasibility of innovative social models. These may be influenced by a
number of cultural, social, political, and economic factors. Liaising
with community organizations and NGOs can help both sides to
learn about what is needed and what is available.

Europe is currently hosting millions of forcibly displaced people
from Ukraine. Many countries have taken significant steps to
enable their rapid integration. With the European Union (EU)‘s
Temporary Protection for Ukrainian refugees extended until
March 2025, EU Member States will continue hosting refugees
and providing protection and access to vital services, including
education, healthcare, and employment [11].

The Asylum Seekers Benefits Act has shown that legislation can
be amended quickly when necessary. As a result, refugees from
Ukraine were granted immediate access to psychiatric care, includ-
ing special consultation hours with psychiatrists and psychother-
apists. Private accommodation was arranged, unemployment
benefits were provided from day one in the host countries, work
permits were issued promptly, and children were swiftly enrolled in
schools. The treatment of Ukrainian refugees illustrates how better
conditions are possible and achievable in many countries. Extend-
ing these conditions to other asylum seekers could significantly
improve their health conditions.

Ethical Principles in Mental Health Care
The term “ethics” is derived from the ancient Greek word “ethos”
which refers to the moral norms and values guiding human behavior
[64]. This concept encompasses an integrative understanding of
morality. The ethical challenges involved in the treatment of migrants
and refugees are deeply connected to systemic and cultural issues, as
well as to the core principles of professional practice. As Norvoll et al.
[65] suggest it is crucial to address the moral aspects of health care and
health policy, particularly concerning the treatment of migrants and
refugees at individual, structural, and organizational levels.

It is ethically unacceptable to treat people differently on the basis
of what the UK calls protected factors such as gender, age, sexual
orientation, religion, disability, or ethnic origin. However, access to
healthcare for migrants and refugees in many European countries is
still very different and regulated by different national laws.

Specific Ethical Challenges in the Care of Refugees, Asylum
Seekers and Migrants

A growing number of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers
worldwide have limited or no proficiency in the host country’s
language(s), which significantly hampers their ability to access
regular mental health services. Besides cultural barriers, these lan-
guage barriers pose significant challenges to medical treatment,
especially for those whose access to health care is already limited
due to factors such as unfamiliarity with local health care systems or
unclear insurance status [47, 66, 67].

Language is the most crucial tool in psychiatry and psychother-
apy, making treatment impossible if there is no shared language and
no translation between therapist and patient [68]. To facilitate
communication, the use of professionally trained interpreters is
indispensable.

European Psychiatry

Moreover, understanding cultural and social norms is essential for
accurately interpreting psychiatric and psychological symptoms
within the healthcare system. This underscores the importance of
diversifying healthcare teams and employing interpreters not only as
language mediators but also as cultural mediators. Unfortunately,
health insurance companies rarely fund either, which is an untenable
situation.

According to the Code of Ethics of the EPA, the fundamental

–

values are
– Responsibility and ethical demands: “Psychiatrists must uphold
the responsibilities and ethical demands of the medical pro-
fession and specific to psychiatry and working with mental
health.

– Non-discrimination: Psychiatrists should consider the ethical
principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence,
and justice for all patients regardless of migration status.
Psychiatrists shall not discriminate based on age, race, ethni-
city, nationality, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, social
standing, criminal background, disability, disease, political
affiliations, or migration status.
Psychiatrists must never endorse and participate in discrimin-
atory action.

– Cultural sensitivity: Practicing ethical psychiatry requires
awareness, sensitivity, and empathy for the patient as an indi-
vidual, including their cultural values and beliefs.

– Advocacy for Universal Healthcare: Psychiatrists hold the obli-
gation to advocate for universal health care for everyone, and
fair and appropriate prevention, care, treatment, and rehabili-
tation for individuals with mental disorders within available
resources in their respective countries.

– Respect and communication: Psychiatrists must stay respect-
ful in communications with patients, patient relatives, and
staff. Psychiatrists should promote education of patients,
families, and other professionals to empower decision-making
processes” [69].

– Decision-making and informed consent: Psychiatrists shall not
act as proxy decision makers for their patients and need to stay
respectful of patients’ decisions and ensure patients’ rights to
express their will (e.g., coercion, restraint, compulsory medi-
cation). Psychiatrists should inform patients about diagnostic
and therapeutic procedures, promote their autonomy, and
always seek their informed consent.

– Rejection of discriminatory practices: Psychiatrist shall not act

as a proxy for migration policy.

In communications with patients, psychiatrists must overcome
language and cultural barriers, ensuring that they provide security,
attention, and adequate time according to the patient’s condition,
within available resources. This includes respecting the principles
of autonomy and dignity, confidentiality, and appropriate care for
gravely ill or disabled patients, including those under involuntary
(compulsory) care and treatment.

In many European countries, the ethical principles in dealing
with refugees are not taken sufficiently seriously, which contradicts
the UN Resolution 46/119 of the Principles for the Protection of
Persons with Mental Illness. According to this resolution, psychi-
atrists should oppose discriminatory practices that limit their bene-
fits and entitlements, deny parity, restrict treatment options, or
limit their access to proper medications for patients with mental
disorders. In some countries, psychiatry is misused to write reports
on the mental health conditions of these migrants, so that they can
be deported by the police. This contradicts fundamental values that

psychiatrists should act according to and uphold the obligation to
advocate for universal health care for everyone, including fair and
appropriate prevention, care, treatment, and rehabilitation for
migrant and refugee patients with mental disorders within available
resources in their respective countries.

The treatment of Ukrainian refugees is a good example of how
better conditions are possible and achievable in many countries.
Extending these conditions to other asylum seekers could signifi-
cantly improve their health conditions.

Recommendations

The primary duty of a physician is to promote the health and well-
being of individual patients by providing competent, timely, and
compassionate care in accordance with good medical practice and
professionalism [70]. Therefore, the EPA recommends strategies
to mitigate the impact of war, displacement, and related trauma.
According to the aims of this position statement, EPA calls
urgently for:
(cid:129) Action to identify issues related to the mental health of
migrants and refugees, bearing in mind that these are heter-
ogenous groups and needs will differ.

(cid:129) The development of strategies to enable mental health profes-
sionals to appropriately treat those severely traumatized by
torture, violence, rape, death, and other traumatic experiences.
(cid:129) Member societies to raise awareness and improve the basic
knowledge and skills of psychiatric and mental health profes-
sionals regarding the care of migrants and refugees.

(cid:129) The demand for equal treatment of all migrants and refugees,

without any discrimination and exclusion.

(cid:129) Adherence to the ethical principles when dealing with mentally
ill refugees and migrants, in accordance with the UN Reso-
lution 46/119 of the Principles for the Protection of Persons
with Mental Illness.

(cid:129) Commitment to medical ethics, including beneficence, respect
for patients (autonomy), non-maleficence,
justice, and the
imperatives to improve standards of psychiatric practice and
to apply psychiatric expertise to the service of society (including
seeking equity in prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of
psychiatric disorders) and treating people fairly.
