Abstract: Research on support for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism has mainly focused on
caregivers, while preventive offers for non-caregiving relatives are lacking. Thus, the aim of this
multicenter pilot study is to develop and assess the feasibility of a preventive psychosocial support
program for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism. It speciﬁcally focuses on family members of
patients who are in an early phase of the disease, are not currently caregiving, and have not yet
developed distress symptoms. It includes a telemedicine-based, 6-week preventive psychological
short intervention (PPSI). The main objective of this feasibility mixed-methods study is to specify the
demand for an early, low-threshold, and low-cost short intervention and to collect feedback based
on qualitative and quantitative data of N = 20 relatives. Secondary objectives are an evaluation of
the effects of the intervention and an analysis of the study design. Future directions are to further
develop the PPSI using these data. This study can serve as a basis for future randomized controlled
studies on this intervention, which might ﬁll an important gap in clinical supply.

1. Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and
its prevalence is expected to increase substantially in the coming years [1]. PD is mostly
characterized by the cardinal motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability,
and tremor [2]. In addition, several other motor and non-motor symptoms affect patients’
and their relatives’ lives. The non-motor symptoms comprise constipation, orthostatic
hypotension, bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety, or cognitive
impairment, among many others. Age is currently considered the main risk factor [3].
Neuropathologically, the disease is based on the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of
the substantia nigra pars compacta [3]. As the disease progresses, the motor and non-motor
symptoms can increasingly restrict patients’ daily lives and may require a substantial
amount of care [4].

The diagnosis of PD, but especially the rampant restrictions in daily life while the
disease progresses, may entail major psychological implications for the affected person
and relatives.

In many cases, loss of patients’ autonomy and difﬁculties coping with daily life
(clothing, personal hygiene, nutrition, mobility, taking medication, etc.) may inevitably
cause an increased level of dependence on the relatives’ support. A growing body of
literature indicates that the symptom burden of PD patients and stress experienced by
family caregivers strongly correlate [5–8].

Research indicates that many families try to ensure care in the familiar home environ-
ment for as long as possible. Especially at early stages, care is usually provided exclusively
by close family members such as spouses, children, siblings, and also sometimes friends
and neighbors [9,10]. With increasing disability, however, care provided by relatives alone
may become insufﬁcient [6], so that about 24% of PD patients receive professional care in
their home environment and 19% permanently live in a care facility [11]. Related factors to
the necessity of permanent care in a nursing home are increased age, pronounced motor
symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric impairments, but especially psy-
chotic symptoms [6,10,12]. In addition, safety concerns and caregiver-related factors such
as managing changes in caregiver health play a crucial role in the institutionalization of
PD patients [4].

Family members may experience this role change within disease progression from
spouse/relative to caregiver to mere spectator due to changes in their social position, which
often encompasses conflicts between patient and relatives [13]. Due to the multidimensional
character of the burden, stressful situations of relatives are often not recognized in time, and
relatives are therefore also considered as “invisible patients” [14]. The burden of relatives
often leads to serious effects on emotional, social, physical, and financial aspects of life as
well as the ever-increasing scarcity of time [14,15]. It should also be noted that the burden
might not only begin with the diagnosis but with the first, initially unspecific symptoms—
even for the relatives. In addition, fear of Parkinsonism/PD progression leads to a further
experience of stress [16], so that overall, a significantly increased risk of a reduced quality of
life and the development of depression may be the consequences [14,17,18]. However, the
sample of our study does not consist exclusively of PD patients but also includes patients
with Parkinsonism and their relatives to design a comprehensive support program for
relatives with similar experiences.

It is already known that caregivers of patients with Parkinsonism often suffer from
severe psychological stress in the late phase of the disease. The burden on caregivers
increases with disability and symptoms of Parkinsonism. This is especially relevant for
mental health problems such as depression, hallucinations or confusion, and falls [19]. The
duration and severity of the disease correlates with the burden on the relatives [20]. They
have an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity and persistent distress [21]. However, little
is known about the mental attitudes and burdens of family members in the early phase of
the disease [14,18].

The main study population does not yet correspond to the conventional deﬁnition
of family caregivers, because they are not yet giving informal care. Therefore, the term
“non-caregiving relatives” will be used. The sample thus includes partners of patients with
Parkinsonism in the early phase of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr I–II) who live together in
one household and who are not yet involved in caregiving.

Despite the growing research on the burden on caregivers of patients with Parkin-
sonism, there is still limited evidence on interventions for non-caregiving relatives [22].
Focusing on non-caregiving relatives is, however, of immense importance to support them
as early as possible and to alleviate burdens and avoid severe strain [23]. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, there are no prevention support programs for the target population of
the study. However, there is evidence of programs for diseases for which relatives are at
increased risk, such as strain, (stress,) depression, and anxiety [24,25].

Brain Sci. 2022, 12, 442

Existing support programs for family members of people with PD are often educational
and provide therapeutic support but are mainly aimed at family members of patients in
the late phase of the disease who are already involved in the care of the person with
PD. These programs are often aimed at both PD patients and their caregivers taking part
together [18,26–28]. This study aims to evaluate an intervention that is only aimed at
the relatives.

The support program will be conducted online. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has
led to digitalization in telemedicine in many areas as well as the ﬁeld of neurology and
the care of PD patients [29]. Nevertheless, the availability of online support programs is
not yet widespread. However, approaches have been developed to examine telephone-
based self-support groups [30], online teaching programs for patients with Parkinsonism
in the late stage [31], and educational programs offered by healthcare professionals for
caregivers [32]. Because an E-health approach is still quite uncommon, there is little data
on the effectiveness of support services for caregivers. However, effectiveness has already
been demonstrated in the context of preventive support for relatives in other related ﬁelds
such as mental health and dementia [33–35].

Nevertheless, there is a lack of preventive telemedical offers for non-caregiving rel-
atives of Parkinson’s patients [36]. The term ‘e-mental health’ refers to technological
approaches that maintain or promote psychological health [37].

Therefore, a preventive psychological short intervention (PPSI) for non-caring relatives

is to be developed within the scope of the study.

This study explicitly addresses relatives who are not (yet) involved in family care.
The intervention itself is solely aimed at the non-caregiving relatives and intends to
strengthen resources, thereby fostering empowerment in the course of a progressive disease.
Topics of the intervention, which follows a cognitive–behavioral therapy approach, are, on
the one hand, the visualization and activation of relatives’ social network of relationships,
and, on the other hand, speciﬁc exercises with relatives of people with Parkinsonism to
empower dealing with stressful situations possibly arising in the future. The intervention
is offered online and allows participation from home to facilitate implementation into
relatives’ everyday life. The key question is, therefore, a threefold feasibility analysis:

1.

2.

3.

Feasibility of the intervention: the feasibility will be assessed via acceptability, ﬁt and
subjective beneﬁt.
Feasibility of the manual (adherence): it is to be assessed whether all planned aspects
of the intervention have been discussed or if there are other topics that will be brought
up by the relatives.
Feasibility of the study design: investigating the feasibility of the study design means
critically reﬂecting on the mixed-methods approach, the process of a baseline measure-
ment with post and follow-up assessments, as well as the validity of the questionnaire
selection and the structure of the interview guide. The data from questionnaires will
be used for exploratory analyses.

Against this background, the primary aim of this multicenter pilot trial following a
mixed-methods approach is to develop and assess the feasibility of a preventive psychologi-
cal short intervention to relatives of patients with Parkinsonism at early stages. In addition,
the secondary aims are to investigate the effects and manual adherence of the intervention.

2. Methods and Study Design
2.1. Methods

This study will be conducted at two different locations in Germany, the Department
of Neurology of the University Hospital in Marburg (study number: 175/20) and the
Department of Medical Psychology/Neuropsychology and Gender Studies of the Faculty
of Medicine and the University Hospital Cologne of the University of Cologne (study
number: 21-1061). Ten patients and ten relatives will be included as dyads per site so that
a total of 20 relatives and 20 patients with Parkinsonism will be included. Recruitment
will take place separately at both sites. At the Marburg site, patients and their relatives

Brain Sci. 2022, 12, 442

4 of 13

will be recruited via an internal recruitment system of the Department of Neurology at
the University Hospital that lists patients with Parkinsonism who are generally interested
in participating in studies. In Cologne, recruitment will be ensured via lists of study
participants from previous studies. Further, e-mail distribution lists of self-help groups will
be used to increase the recruitment numbers.
Inclusion criteria for patients are:

(1)

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinsonism according to the Movement Disorder
Society (MDS) criteria [2];
(2) Patients aged ≥ 18 years;
(3) Hoehn and Yahr stages I–II (OFF-state).

The exclusion criteria for the patients are:
(1) Hoehn and Yahr stage ≥ III (OFF-state);
(2) No care requirements and/or outpatient or inpatient care;
(3)

Suspected dementia according to physicians’ reports and (third-party) anamnesis.

Inclusion criteria for non-caregiving relatives are:

(1) Partners of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism, living together in the same house-

hold;

(2) Age ≥ 18 years;
(3) Not involved in informal caregiving of the subject with Parkinsonism;
(4) Willingness to use telemedicine, availability of a PC or tablet with stable internet

connection;

(5) No cognitive impairment (operationalized by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
[MoCA] [38], Blind Version ≥ 19; the MoCA Blind, which is suitable for online
administration and therefore used here, is reduced to 22 items and converted back to
30 points maximum. A total of 19 points in the MoCA Blind version correspond to
26 points in the original MoCA “Full”);

Exclusion criteria for the relatives are:

(1) Own caregiving requirement;
(2)

Severe depression (operationalized by the Beck’s Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II] ≥
29 points) [39].

2.2. Study Design

The patients and their relatives will be informed verbally and in writing about their
participation in the study. By signing the consent form, they are included in the study.
Figure 1 depicts the three time points of measurement: baseline (t0), post-testing immedi-
ately after the end of the intervention (t1), and follow-up (FU) at 6 weeks post-intervention
(t2). The intervention is to be understood as a preventive psychological short intervention
for relatives. Patients will not participate in the intervention. No remuneration will be paid
to the participants.

2.3. Intervention Protocol

The PPSI includes three sessions of maximum 50 min at intervals of max. 2 weeks
and is to be conducted in an online meeting with the relative and a trained and supervised
advisor (at least B.Sc. in Psychology or related discipline). A licensed therapist (MW)
trains new advisors on how to use the manual and supervises the PPSI on a weekly
basis. The Red Medical platform (https://www.redmedical.de/ accessed on 3 March
2022) ensures the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-compliant implementation
of video consultations with overall end-to-end encryption so that conversations remain
strictly conﬁdential and cannot be accessed by third parties. The cognitive–behavioral
therapy-based intervention consists of three sessions, which include the following elements:
standardized elements with knowledge transfer, personalized elements addressing the
individual’s perspective, and exercises to apply the knowledge on an individual basis. As

Brain Sci. 2022, 12, 442

support, working sheets will be used, which also serve for future implementation of the
intervention elements in the study participants’ everyday life.

At a content level, the mental health of the relatives is the focus of the intervention.
Each session deals with a psychological focus area. The areas are based on protective factors
in prevention of mental disorders, e.g., ability to manage stress, empowerment, and social
participation [40]. The most relevant areas were selected via expert panels (CE, AF, EK,
CM, FT, and MW) with regard to the most relevant issues in giving care to patients with
Parkinsonism. The overarching goal is to provide self-management strategies for relatives
of PD patients in the sense of “empowerment”, which can be applied at a later stage of
the disease.

2.3.1. Session 1—Understanding the Situation of the Relatives,
Stress-Management Strategies

The ﬁrst session focuses on establishing a relationship between the trained advisor
and the relative as well as on exploring the personal situation and life circumstances of the
relative. This includes asking about potential individual fears of disease progression. In
addition, goals, wishes, and expectations towards the short intervention are discussed with
the relatives. Then, a psychoeducational unit on stress management follows, containing the
transfer of knowledge on the transactional stress model according to Lazarus [41]. Possible
individual stressors are identiﬁed, and coping strategies are worked out in a problem-
oriented or emotion-oriented way. Key questions: “what changes to the situation/action

can be taken to reduce (any future) stress?” (problem-oriented coping). “How can the
relative deal with the situation better?” (emotion-oriented coping).

2.3.2. Session 2—Social Network and Self-Management Strategies

The second session is designed to promote self-management strategies and individual
resources as well as autonomy [14,42]. First, the so-called airplane metaphor is discussed
with the relatives to individually design the topic of self-care [43]. The core idea of the
airplane metaphor is that every passenger in the airplane is asked as part of the safety
instructions to ﬁrst put on the oxygen mask themselves in case of a loss of air pressure and
then to help other people [43].

Afterward, concrete methods to increase self-care will be discussed: the social (and, if
necessary, professional) environment of the relatives is explored and noted in a specially
provided page of the workbook. Then, with self-care in mind, it is discussed to what extent
this “support network” could become active in a supportive way in the further course of
the disease [9]. With the help of a visualized list, it can be possible at an early stage to
identify and (re-)activate important people to the “inner circle” of the relatives.

This is followed by a unit on values orientation. Here, based on a list of values
previously ﬁlled out by the relatives, they work out which personal values they feel to
be important [44]. The goal is illustrated by the so-called bus driver metaphor [45]. In
this imagination exercise, the relatives are asked to imagine themselves as bus drivers
and to transport both positively and negatively associated passengers. The passengers
symbolize negative or positive experiences and worries in dealing with Parkinsonism.
Especially in the case of increasing stress (e.g., due to progression of the disease), it is
helpful to activate the relatives’ personally important values and encourage them to adapt
their behavior accordingly [45]. To act in accordance with personal values helps to stay
psychologically ﬂexible while experiencing interfering negative thoughts, emotions, and
bodily sensations [46]. For example, a relative ruminating about Parkinsonian symptoms
of their spouse will sometimes feel helpless. It could then be comforting to do something
meaningful to them personally, e.g., helping others in similar situations (value: helpfulness),
making the best out of the situation with the partner (relationship), or focusing on their
own career (success). The relatives should be encouraged to live by their own values,
regardless of their partners’ illness.

2.3.3. Session 3—Conception of Further Strategies Based on Personal Values

In the third and last session, the aim is to summarize the two previous sessions and
record the contents discussed for later use. In this session, a concise strategy for dealing
with worries will be conveyed through an exercise on the non-judgmental perception of
thoughts [47]. This can be a useful skill to describe negative feelings more neutral and hence
break the vicious circle of rumination. In addition, as a conclusion to the work on values,
the participants should practice aligning their own action planning with a personal value.
The session concludes with discussing the personal take-home messages, with participants
summarizing what they have gained from the conversations.

2.4. Outcome Measures

This pilot study follows an explorative mixed methods approach focusing on feasibility
aspects and effects of the intervention using both quantitative and qualitative data. Data
will be collected from both relatives and patients to capture the factors inﬂuencing the
burden of relatives in the early phase of the disease. It is known from previous studies
on the late phase that, in addition to the patient’s health status and the severity and
duration of the disease, other patient-related aspects inﬂuence caregiver burden [48]. For
the relatives, mental health, sociodemographic factors, and personality aspects, among
others, are considered predictors of burden [36]. The data collection is thus intended
to provide a diverse and complete picture of the burden on relatives in the early stages
of Parkinsonism.

2.4.1. Effects of the Intervention

To determine whether the intervention has led to health- and stress-management-
related changes in the relatives, standardized questionnaires and psychometric tests will
be conducted at three time points of measurement (t0, t1, t2). The questionnaires address
various parameters: personality, sense of burden, depression, cognition, quality of life,
coping strategies for stress, self-management, expectation of therapy, and subjective beneﬁt
(see Table 1 for details).

After completion of data collection, quantitative data will be analyzed using statistical
software IBM SPSS Statistics 27. Detailed descriptive analyses as well as paired-samples
t-tests and Mann–Whitney-U-test, respectively, will be conducted, according to the distribu-
tion of the data. Subjects who drop out of the study will be included in the analysis in the
sense of an intention-to-treat analysis. Table 1 provides an overview of the questionnaires
and the neuropsychological test battery.

2.4.2. Feasibility Analysis of the Intervention

The qualitative data will provide a more detailed insight into the perspective of rel-
atives of patients with Parkinsonism as potential future primary caregivers. Qualitative,
semi-structured interviews will be conducted at two time points via an online consultation
with relatives immediately after the intervention (t1) and 6 weeks post-intervention (t2).
This part of the feasibility analysis is structured by the three outcome aspects of acceptance,
ﬁt, and subjective beneﬁt with corresponding operationalizations and queried in the inter-
views. The interview guide contains questions on acceptance, ﬁt, and personal beneﬁt of
the intervention.

All interviews at t1 and t2 will be recorded and transcribed following data collection
and stored for 10 years. During transcription, the ruleset suggested by Dresing and
Pehl [59] will be followed. The spoken content is prioritized accordingly, while information
on para- and non-verbal events are omitted. The MAXQDA 2020.4 software will be used
for qualitative content analysis according to Kuckartz [60] using a combined model of
deductive (a priori) and inductive coding (on the text material).

2.4.3. Feasibility of the Intervention Manual

Not only the feasibility and impact of the intervention but also the manual adherence
will be assessed quantitatively using an evaluation scheme developed for this purpose.
Each section will be listed to independently rate whether the respective topic was addressed,
as well as whether the worksheets provided were discussed. The scale consists of 14 items
(10 topics, 4 worksheets) that are answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not
addressed) to 3 (fully addressed). A sum score will be obtained at the end to quantify
adherence. Further topics addressed outside the manual will be noted. The manual
adherence ratings will be completed by an independent rater using tape recordings of the
sessions. This also allows noting deviations from the intervention time (50 min per session).
The participant’s audio track will not be recorded and evaluated; only the advisor’s track
will be recorded via the microphone output. However, all participants give their prior
consent to these recordings.

With the help of feedback from the relatives, the feasibility of the intervention is
evaluated. Therefore, the workbook also functions as an intervention diary. Before each
session, the mood and motivation of the relatives are recorded. Except for the ﬁrst session,
they are asked what they remember of the previous session and if it was of any use to them.
After each session, the relatives’ mood and satisfaction with the session are assessed by
asking them how helpful they found the content and delivery of the intervention. The data
are collected using a six-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much).

2.4.4. Feasibility of the Study Design

To examine the feasibility of the study, the test battery will also be critically exam-
ined regarding length and expected beneﬁt. The feasibility of the study design will be
discussed in an expert panel, considering the results of the interviews and the completed
questionnaires. In addition, a dropout analysis will be conducted to evaluate the reasons
for participants dropping out of the study.

An overview of the feasibility analysis is summarized in Table 2.

3. Discussion

Currently, there is limited evidence on the feasibility and effects of interventions for
family members of people with Parkinsonism. The existing offers for relatives mostly
have a psychoeducational orientation and refer to relatives of patients in a more advanced
phase [18,26,27]. There are also approaches offering CBT treatments [28], but these can be
quite time-consuming and do not have a preventive focus. Digital support programs based
on telemedicine are currently still very rare, but they exist, for example, as a model of a
telephone self-help group [30]. However, there are no outreach or preventive programs that
speciﬁcally address relatives of patients in the early phase of the disease. The aim of the
present study is, therefore, to develop a PPSI for relatives of people with Parkinsonism and
to determine whether the target group accepts it, and the feasibility regarding its preventive
approach and digital implementation is of particular interest. Furthermore, the ﬁt of PPSI
and the relatives’ needs, as well as their subjective beneﬁt from the intervention in the
current state, should give valuable feedback on which topics to add or remove in a future
modiﬁed version of the preventive support offer.

Due to the multidimensional character of the burden that relatives of people with
Parkinsonism are confronted with, and the rather high sense of stress at the time of diagno-
sis, implementing a PPSI with similar objectives appears to be an important approach.

Notwithstanding more methodological concerns about the feasibility of such an inter-
vention, there are also technical questions risen by the study presented. It is essential to
consider that not all people have access to the technical prerequisites or have the ability or
the will to use them. Although technical devices increasingly bridge the existing spatial
distance [61], in some areas, access to in-person healthcare services and digital resources are
more limited than in others. It remains to be elucidated if the expansion of digital resources,
e.g., in rural areas, may counteract these limitations and if our intervention, while disease

Brain Sci. 2022, 12, 442

10 of 13

stages are within a mild to moderate range, can somehow contribute to supporting relatives.
Despite the lack of closeness due to familiarity and informal communication within our
study, we aim at providing a short and digital intervention that will be easily implemented
into the daily life of the relatives [62]. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the easy
access from home is a great advantage of the PPSI. In addition, digital communication
enables people from rural areas to be reached more easily.

As this pilot study is to be understood as a starting point for further preventative
approaches, there are several limitations. Due to the small number of participants (n = 20), it
is not possible to make reliable statements about the impact of the intervention. Predicting
whether a preventive approach can sustainably support relatives to avoid stress and
burdens in the long term and in advance would only be possible with a larger study
population and a longitudinal design covering several years. Another limitation is that the
study period of the intervention is probably too short to capture the effects on the daily
life of the family members in the further course of the disease. Therefore, the study will
serve as preparation for a large-scale, prospective, randomized, longitudinal controlled
clinical trial.

4. Conclusions

This study aims to test a preventive e-mental health offer for relatives of people
with Parkinsonism. It will be apparent whether the target group accepts this offer and
what suggestions and feedback are revealed in the evaluation. With the help of feedback,
especially from the interviews, the psychosocial intervention will be further developed to
ensure that the offer is oriented according to the needs of the relatives. After evaluating the
pilot study, a modiﬁcation of the intervention and the study design is planned, relying on
the ﬁndings. Based on this, a multicenter randomized, controlled trial will be implemented.
