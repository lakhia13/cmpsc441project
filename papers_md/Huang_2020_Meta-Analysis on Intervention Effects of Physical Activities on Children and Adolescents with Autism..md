Abstract: This paper aimed to discuss the intervention eﬀects of physical activities on children and
adolescents with autism with a meta-analysis so as to serve as a reference to further relevant research
on the same topic. As for research methods, by searching in CNKI (China National Knowledge
Infrastructure), WanFang data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, PubMed, Scopus,
Web of Science, and other databases, this study collected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the
intervention of physical activities on children and adolescents with autism and used Review Manager
5.3 software to process and analyze the outcome indicators of the literature. As for the result, a total of
12 papers and 492 research targets were selected. The results of the meta-analysis show that physical
activity had a signiﬁcant positive impact on social interaction ability, communication ability, motor
skills, and autism degree of autistic children as well as the social skills and communication skills of
autistic adolescents. On the other hand, physical activity had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the stereotyped
behavior of autistic children and adolescents. In conclusion, physical activity intervention is beneﬁcial
to children and adolescents with autism, and continuous physical activity intervention can produce
greater intervention eﬀect.

1. Introduction

Autism is a common developmental disorder characterized by diﬃculties with speech and
behaviors, such as lack of social abilities, repetitive behaviors, communication disorders, activity and
interest disorders with limitations [1]. The disease mainly occurs in children and adolescents, but the
explicit age limits of children and adolescents haven’t been decided. Based on the degree of individual
cognition and socialization, Zhang Wenxin divides the kids under 12 years old into children and kids
between 13 and 22 years old into adolescence [2]. According to the latest data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence rate of autistic children is 1/59. And the data from
Asia, Europe and North America reports an average prevalence of 1–2% [3]. According to the report
on the development of Chinese autistic children released by China on 17 October 2014, the prevalence
of autism in China is similar to that in other countries in the world, with about 1%. It can be seen that
autism has become a public health problem that seriously aﬀects the health of children and adolescents.
In addition to the core symptoms of social interaction, communication, and stereotyped behavior,
the motor skills of autistic patients are usually stunted [4]. At present, many researches on the

intervention of physical activity on children and adolescents with autism have been conducted.
Physical activity refers to all kinds of physical actions that consume energy due to skeletal muscle
contraction, including physical exercise, work, housework, entertainment and other activities [5].
However, due to social and behavioral defects, autistic patients usually show a decline in physical
activity level. Fewer opportunities for physical activity are more likely to aﬀect their behavior [6], and
cause some chronic diseases, such as obesity, which is very common in autistic patients [7]. It has been
reported that physical activity has a good intervention eﬀect on autistic patients [8], and the physical
and mental health of autistic patients contains the improvement of core symptoms [9]. Some studies
have shown that after the intervention of physical activity, all of the social interaction ability [10–12],
communication ability [11,13–15], stereotyped behavior [11,16] and sports skills [11,17–19] of children
and adolescents with autism have been improved, which can reduce the degree of autism [14,15,20,21].
These studies show that physical activity is very eﬀective in intervention of children and adolescents
with autism.

Although a large number of studies have shown that physical activity is eﬀective in the intervention
of children and adolescents with autism, the results of individual studies may still be uncertain due to
the great diﬀerences in sample size, intervention means, intervention time, intervention frequency and
measurement results in various studies. Therefore, this meta-analysis was carried out on studies of
the intervention of physical activity on children and adolescents with autism of the in the latest 10
years to objectively evaluate the intervention eﬀect of physical activity on social interaction ability,
communication ability, stereotyped behavior, sports skills and autism degree of children and adolescents
with autism so as to provide the basis for clinical application of physical activity intervention in the
operation of children and adolescents with autism.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Selection and Exclusion Criteria of Literature

Literature including all of these criteria were selected: (1) the research type was experimental,
particularly randomized control experiments; (2) the research target were children and adolescents
with autism; (3) the test group had obvious physical activity intervention, while the control group
did not carry out any physical activities; (4) the outcome indicators were either autism rating scales
or motor skills rating scale. Literature including any of these criteria were excluded: (1) they were
non-randomized controlled trials; (2) subjects were neither children nor adolescents with autism;
(3) they are repetitive published literature; (4) intervention means were non-physical activities; (5) the
literature results showed no outcome index data; (6) they were reviews; (7) the control group had
physical activity intervention.

2.2. Searching Strategies

Literature searching was conducted in CNKI, WanFang Data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical
Periodicals, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and other databases with “free words + subject words”,
including Chinese and English journals, conference papers, and dissertations. Key words both in
English and Chinese, such as physical activities, physical exercise, sports, and autism, were used. The
literature searching period was from January 2010 to December 2019.

2.3. Data Extraction and Quality Evaluation

2.3.1. Data Extraction and Processing

Data on authors, publication time, physical activity contents, test groups, and control groups
(sample sizes, measurement tools for autistic patients, means and standard deviations before and after
intervention) were extracted. When diﬀerent scales were used in each experiment, standardized mean,
diﬀerence, SMD (standardized mean diﬀerence), and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were selected as

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 1950

the combined statistics. When the same scales were used in each experiment, weighted mean diﬀerence
(WMD) and 95% CIs were selected as the combined statistics. If there was heterogeneity in the results,
the random eﬀect model was used to analyze the data; if not, the ﬁxed eﬀect model was used. I2
represents the heterogeneity of various studies [22].

2.3.2. Literature Quality Evaluation

We evaluated the quality of the literature according to the Jadad scale [23]. The evaluation
included three aspects: random and its hidden program, blinding, withdrawal, and loss to follow
up. The scale was from 0–5; a 0–2 score was considered low-quality research, and a 3–5 score was
considered high-quality research.

3.1. General Results of Selected Research Literature

Figure 1 depicts the detailed literature search process. A total of 1357 primary literature were
obtained by using literature searching strategy. After the selection of reading topics and abstracts,
240 papers were analyzed. In the second round, the following conditions were excluded: (1) the
intervention means were not physical activities; (2) the research type was not an RCT experimental
study; (3) there was no outcome index data; (4) the control group was physical activity; (5) they were
reviews; (6) subjects were not children nor adolescents with autism. Finally, 12 articles were included
in the meta-analysis.

3.2. General Features of Selected Research Literature

3.2.1. General Information of Each Study

Through comprehensive search of relevant literature and strict selection according to the inclusion
and exclusion criteria, 12 randomized controlled trials ﬁnally met the inclusion criteria for systematic
evaluation (see Table 1). All of the 12 papers were published within the past decade. A total of 492
children and adolescents with autism were included in 12 articles, including 253 in the experimental
group and 239 in the control group.

3.2.2. Interventions of Physical Activities

The relevant literature included in this study all used physical activities as intervention
means, including sports games, water sports, football, aerobics, karate, horse riding, and other
physical activities.

3.2.3. Frequency of Physical Activity Intervention

In seven papers [10,12–16,20], the frequency of physical activity intervention was more than
3 times per week; in four papers [17–19,21], the frequency of physical activity intervention was 3 times
or less; and in one paper [11], the frequency of intervention was not reported.

3.2.4. Duration of Each Physical Activity Intervention

Among 12 selected papers, 11 [10–19,21] mentioned the duration of each physical activity

intervention (between 45 and 90 min).

3.2.5. Physical Activity Intervention Cycle

The intervention cycle of physical activity ranged from 4 weeks to 24 weeks. There were
5 papers [11,15,18,19,21] with an intervention period less than 12 weeks (including 12 weeks), and
7 papers [10,12–14,16,17,20] with an intervention period more than 12 weeks.

3.3. Results

3.3.1. Quality Evaluation of Selected Literature

Among the 12 papers included in meta-analysis,

four [14,15,20,21] were Chinese and
eight [10–13,16–19] were English. All papers had a clear autism behavior score scale or motor
skills score scale. Among the 12 literatures, 11 [10–20] mentioned randomness. Two of them [11,19]
mentioned randomization and described the correct randomization method. None of the 12 papers
mentioned the implementation of a blind method, and no one quit the intervention process. According
to the Jadad quality rating scale, these papers were evaluated from three aspects: random, blinding,
loss to follow up or withdrawal. Nine [10,12–18,20] were scored 1, 1 [21] was scored 0, and 2 [11,19]
were scored 2. In this case, papers selected by this method had poor qualities.

3.3.2. Impacts of Physical Activities on Social Interaction Ability of Autistic Children and Adolescents

In a meta-analysis of three studies (n = 197), physical activity signiﬁcantly improved the social
interaction ability of autistic children and adolescents (SMD = −0.58, 95% CI: −0.87 to −0.29, I2 = 3%,
z = 3.95, p < 0.0001, Figure 2).

3.3.3. Impacts of Physical Activities on Communication Ability of Autistic Children and Adolescents

In a meta-analysis of 4 studies (n = 240), physical activity signiﬁcantly improved communication
ability in children and adolescents with autism (SMD = −0.29, 95% CI: −0.55 to −0.04, I2 = 35%, z = 2.25,
p = 0.02 < 0.05, Figure 3).

3.3.4. Impacts of Physical Activities on Stereotyped Behaviors of Autistic Children and Adolescents

Among the 12 papers included, two [11,16] (n = 146) compared the scores of stereotyped behaviors
between the control group and the experimental group. Through the heterogeneity test (Chi2 = 1.82,
df = 1 (p = 0.18), I2 = 45%). Since p > 0.1, I2 < 50%, according to Cochrane Manual, heterogeneity is
acceptable, and therefore the ﬁxed eﬀect model was used for analysis. The results showed that the
horizontal line and the diamond, after combining the two studies, intersected with the invalid line,
indicating that the combination statistics of multiple studies were not statistically signiﬁcant (SMD =
−0.13, 95% CI: −0.46 to 0.20, I2 = 45%, z = 0.78, p = 0.43 > 0.05, Figure 4). That is, the inﬂuence of physical
activities on the stereotyped behaviors of children and adolescents with autism was not signiﬁcant.

3.3.5. Impacts of Physical Activities on Motor Skills of Autistic Children and Adolescents

In the four selected papers [11,17–19] (n = 172), the total sample size of the experimental group
was 86, and the total sample size of the control group was 86. There was heterogeneity among the four
research results (I2 = 89%); thus, the random eﬀect model was used for analysis. The results showed
that the combined statistics of multiple studies were not statistically signiﬁcant (SMD = −0.17, 95% CI:
−1.46 to 1.11, I2 = 89%, z = 0.26, p = 0.79 > 0.05, Figure 5).

Figure 5. Forest plot of meta-analysis on impacts of physical activities on motor skills of autistic
children and adolescents.

The data in Figure 5 show high heterogeneity (I2 = 89% > 50%). Therefore, sensitivity analysis
is needed to determine the heterogeneity sources of physical activities on motor skills of autistic
children and adolescents. Firstly, we removed Reference [19] with a biggest diﬀerence from others
but found diﬀerences still existed. Then, the method of reducing one study at a time was used to test
whether each study had a signiﬁcant impact on the combined eﬀect of motor skills of autistic children
and adolescents. The sensitivity analysis showed that the heterogeneity dropped to 0 after deleting
References [11,19] which had a signiﬁcant impact on the results of the concomitant eﬀect. Another
analysis of References [11,19] showed that the research objects of study [11] were autistic children
and adolescents aged from 6 to16, while those of References [17,18] were children aged from 4 to 12.
Therefore, the diﬀerence may be caused by diﬀerent research objects. Reference [19] had a shorter
intervention period (6 weeks). To sum up, long-term physical activity intervention may not have a
signiﬁcant impact on the motor skills of autistic adolescents but has a signiﬁcant impact on the motor
skills of autistic children. In the meta-analysis of two studies (n = 38), physical activity signiﬁcantly
improved motor skills of autistic children (SMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.71, I2 = 0%, z = 2.91, p = 0.004
< 0.05, Figure 6).

3.3.6. Impacts of Physical Activities on Levels of Autism of Children and Adolescents

A meta-analysis was conducted on 4 papers [14,15,20,21] on the level of autism in children and
adolescents. According to the results of heterogeneity test (chi2 = 19.75, df = 3 (p = 0.0002), I2 = 85%
(I2 > 50%) which indicated that there was signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the four literatures. Therefore,
the random eﬀect model was adopted for analysis, and the results showed that the combined statistics
of multiple studies had no statistical signiﬁcance (SMD = −1.14, 95% CI: −2.02 to −0.25, z = 2.52,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x  7 of 12  In a meta-analysis of 4 studies (n = 240), physical activity significantly improved communication ability in children and adolescents with autism (SMD = −0.29, 95%CI: −0.55 to −0.04, I2 = 35%, z = 2.25, p = 0.02 < 0.05, Figure 3).  Figure 3. Forest plot of meta-analysis on impacts of physical activities on communication ability of autistic children and adolescents. 3.3.4. Impacts of Physical Activities on Stereotyped Behaviors of Autistic Children and Adolescents Among the 12 papers included, two [11,16] (n = 146) compared the scores of stereotyped behaviors between the control group and the experimental group. Through the heterogeneity test (Chi2 = 1.82, df = 1(p = 0.18), I2 = 45%). Since p > 0.1, I2 < 50%, according to Cochrane Manual, heterogeneity is acceptable, and therefore the fixed effect model was used for analysis. The results showed that the horizontal line and the diamond, after combining the two studies, intersected with the invalid line, indicating that the combination statistics of multiple studies were not statistically significant (SMD = −0.13, 95%CI: −0.46 to 0.20, I2 = 45%, z = 0.78, p = 0.43 > 0.05, Figure 4). That is, the influence of physical activities on the stereotyped behaviors of children and adolescents with autism was not significant.  Figure 4. Forest plot of meta-analysis on impacts of physical activities on stereotyped behaviors of autistic children and adolescents. 3.3.5. Impacts of Physical Activities on Motor Skills of Autistic Children and Adolescents In the four selected papers [11,17—19] (n = 172), the total sample size of the experimental group was 86, and the total sample size of the control group was 86. There was heterogeneity among the four research results (I2 = 89%); thus, the random effect model was used for analysis. The results showed that the combined statistics of multiple studies were not statistically significant (SMD = −0.17, 95%CI: −1.46 to 1.11, I2  = 89%, z = 0.26, p = 0.79 > 0.05, Figure 5).  Figure 5. Forest plot of meta-analysis on impacts of physical activities on motor skills of autistic children and adolescents. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x  8 of 12  The data in Figure 5 show high heterogeneity (I2 = 89% > 50%). Therefore, sensitivity analysis is needed to determine the heterogeneity sources of physical activities on motor skills of autistic children and adolescents. Firstly, we removed Reference [19] with a biggest difference from others but found differences still existed. Then, the method of reducing one study at a time was used to test whether each study had a significant impact on the combined effect of motor skills of autistic children and adolescents. The sensitivity analysis showed that the heterogeneity dropped to 0 after deleting References [11] and [19] which had a significant impact on the results of the concomitant effect. Another analysis of References [11] and [19] showed that the research objects of study [11] were autistic children and adolescents aged from 6 to16, while those of References [17] and [18] were children aged from 4 to 12. Therefore, the difference may be caused by different research objects. Reference [19] had a shorter intervention period (6 weeks). To sum up, long-term physical activity intervention may not have a significant impact on the motor skills of autistic adolescents but has a significant impact on the motor skills of autistic children. In the meta-analysis of two studies (n = 38), physical activity significantly improved motor skills of autistic children (SMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.71, I2 = 0%, z = 2.91, p = 0.004 < 0.05, Figure 6).  Figure 6. Forest plot of meta-analysis on impacts of physical activities on motor skills of autistic children. 3.3.6. Impacts of Physical Activities on Levels of Autism of Children and Adolescents A meta-analysis was conducted on 4 papers [14,15,20,21] on the level of autism in children and adolescents. According to the results of heterogeneity test (chi2 = 19.75, df = 3 (p = 0.0002), I2 = 85% (I2 > 50%) which indicated that there was significant heterogeneity in the four literatures. Therefore, the random effect model was adopted for analysis, and the results showed that the combined statistics of multiple studies had no statistical significance (SMD = -1.14, 95% CI: −2.02 to −0.25, z = 2.52, p = 0.01 < 0.05, Figure 7).  Figure 7. Forest plot of meta-analysis on impacts of physical activities on levels of autism of children and adolescents. The data in Figure 7 show high heterogeneity (I2 = 85% > 50%). Therefore, in order to find the sources of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis should be carried out, and the method of reducing one document at a time should be adopted to check whether each document has a significant impact on the results of merger effect. Sensitivity analysis shows: The deletion of Jiang Feng’s [21] study had a significant effect on the results of merger effect. Another analysis on Jiang Feng [21] showed that the subjects of this study were autistic adolescents aged from 12 to18 years old. The intervention frequency of physical activity was three times a week. Its difference from the other three studies [14,15,20] is the age of the subjects and the intervention frequency of physical activity. So, the Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x  8 of 12  The data in Figure 5 show high heterogeneity (I2 = 89% > 50%). Therefore, sensitivity analysis is needed to determine the heterogeneity sources of physical activities on motor skills of autistic children and adolescents.

The data in Figure 7 show high heterogeneity (I2 = 85% > 50%). Therefore, in order to ﬁnd the
sources of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis should be carried out, and the method of reducing one
document at a time should be adopted to check whether each document has a signiﬁcant impact on
the results of merger eﬀect. Sensitivity analysis shows: The deletion of Jiang Feng’s [21] study had a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the results of merger eﬀect. Another analysis on Jiang Feng [21] showed that the
subjects of this study were autistic adolescents aged from 12 to18 years old. The intervention frequency
of physical activity was three times a week. Its diﬀerence from the other three studies [14,15,20] is the
age of the subjects and the intervention frequency of physical activity. So, the diﬀerence may be caused
by the age of the subjects or the intervention frequency of physical activity. In the meta-analysis of the
three studies (n = 154), physical activity signiﬁcantly decreases the autism level in autistic children
(SMD = −0.61, 95% CI: −0.94 to −0.29, I2 = 0%, z = 3.72, p = 0.0002 < 0.05, Figure 8).

4. Discussion

This paper is a systematic review of quantitative data analysis on the physical activity eﬀects
of children and adolescents with autism. All eligible randomized controlled trials were published
between 2010 and 2019. The results showed that physical activity can signiﬁcantly improve the social
interaction ability and communication ability of children and adolescents with autism, improve the
motor skills, and reduce the degree of autism of children with autism.

The social and communication defects in individuals with autism make them less likely to
participate in sports activities and get along with people [6], which may lead to the sedentary lifestyle
of autistic patients. Not only does it aﬀect the overall health of autistic patients, but it also further
deprives them of social adaptability. Studies have shown that physical activity is beneﬁcial to the
health of autistic patients [24]. Through organized physical activities, people with autism have the
opportunity to communicate with others. In the six [10–15] articles about the inﬂuence of physical
activity on the social interaction ability and communication ability of children and adolescents with
autism, all the researchers mentioned the way of guiding the patients to play games. Autistic children
have a lower quality of games experience than non-autistic children of the same intellectual age [25].
Perhaps for children and adolescents with autism, these physical activities are games they are playing.
In the case that children cannot use language to express completely and clearly, playing games is a
good communication method [26].

Stereotyped behavior is one of the core defects of autistic patients, which is a series of repetitive,
aimless and meaningless behaviors [27]. The physical activity on the reduction of stereotyped behavior
of autistic patients may be explained by the fact that the stimulation obtained by physical activities of
autistic patients has similar internal mechanism of action with the stimulation produced by stereotyped
behavior, which can bring comfortable sensory stimulation to autistic patients, so that they can achieve
appropriate level of excitation through sensory stimulation and adjustment [28]. However, the results
of this review show that physical activity has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the stereotyped behavior of
children and adolescents with autism. Through a careful analysis of the two articles [11,16], it can be
seen that Reference [16] refers to the intervention of physical activity combined with conventional
treatment on children and adolescents with autism, while Reference [11] does not. Therefore, the
statistical diﬀerence may be caused by diﬀerent interventions. Physical activity, a single intervention,
may be combined with conventional therapy to intervene in children and adolescents with autism, and

In the meta-analysis of the three studies (n = 154), physical activity significantly decreases the autism level in autistic children (SMD = −0.61, 95%CI: −0.94 to −0.29, I2 = 0%, z = 3.72, p = 0.0002< 0.05, Figure 8).

Discussion This paper is a systematic review of quantitative data analysis on the physical activity effects of children and adolescents with autism. All eligible randomized controlled trials were published between 2010 and 2019. The results showed that physical activity can significantly improve the social interaction ability and communication ability of children and adolescents with autism, improve the motor skills, and reduce the degree of autism of children with autism.

However, the results of this review show that physical activity has no significant effect on the stereotyped behavior of children and adolescents with autism. Through a careful analysis of the two articles [11,16], it can be seen that Reference [16] refers to the intervention of physical activity combined with conventional treatment on children and adolescents with autism, while Reference [11] does not. Therefore, the statistical difference may be caused by different interventions. Physical activity, a single intervention, may be combined with conventional therapy to intervene in children and adolescents with autism, and the effects of these two interventions on children and adolescents with autism should be considered in future studies. Heterogeneity of results has been found in the analysis of four articles [11,17—19] on the influence of physical activity on motor skills of autistic children and adolescents, but it disappears when two articles [11,19] are excluded. Through the analysis of two articles with significant effects [17,18], the intervention cycle of physical activity is 12—32 weeks, with each intervention lasting 45—75 min and 1-2 times per week. Furthermore, the subjects of intervention are all children with autism Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 1950

the eﬀects of these two interventions on children and adolescents with autism should be considered in
future studies.

Heterogeneity of results has been found in the analysis of four articles [11,17–19] on the inﬂuence
of physical activity on motor skills of autistic children and adolescents, but it disappears when two
articles [11,19] are excluded. Through the analysis of two articles with signiﬁcant eﬀects [17,18], the
intervention cycle of physical activity is 12–32 weeks, with each intervention lasting 45–75 min and
1–2 times per week. Furthermore, the subjects of intervention are all children with autism aged from 4
to 12. It can be concluded that physical activity intervention can improve the sports skills of children
with autism, while exerting little eﬀect on the sports skills of adolescents with autism.

Eventually, among the eﬀects of physical activity on the degree of autism of children and
adolescents, the positive eﬀect of physical activity on the degree of autism of children is signiﬁcant,
excluding the article [21] of the research object including adolescents. Therefore, physical activity can
be considered eﬀective in reducing the degree of autism in children, but it may have little eﬀect on the
degree of autism in adolescents.

According to the results of this meta-analysis, physical activity in the cycle of 4–24 weeks, 4–13
times a week, 30–90 min each time is conducive to the improvement of social interaction ability and
communication ability in children and adolescents with autism, and physical activity in the cycle
of 4–24 weeks, 5–7 times a week, 90 min each time is conducive to the decrease of degree of autism
in children. However, the improvement of sports skills of children by physical activities requires
long-term intervention, at least 12 weeks, 45–75 min each time, 1–2 times a week. In conclusion,
continuous physical activity intervention is beneﬁcial to children and adolescents with autism.

5. Limitations of Current Research

There are some limitations and shortcomings in this meta-analysis. First and foremost, there are
relatively few RCTS on physical activity intervention in individuals with autism, and consequently
the number of articles included was small. Furthermore, most of the random methods in the study
were not clear, and all the articles do not mention the allocation concealment and blinding, which
may have a certain negative impact on the evaluation results of the system. Last but not least, among
the 12 articles included, 4 of them [14,16,18,20] have mentioned that physical activity combined with
routine rehabilitation treatment is used to intervene the patients, while the rest 8 [10–13,15,17,19,21] do
not describe whether there is routine rehabilitation treatment for the patients during the intervention
period, while routine treatment during the intervention period may aﬀect the intervention eﬀect of
physical activity on children and adolescents with autism. Therefore, in order to conﬁrm the positive
eﬀect of physical activity children and adolescents with autism, physical activity can be adopted alone
to intervene patients in the future research.

6. Conclusions

The results of this meta-analysis show that after physical activity intervention, the social interaction
ability and communication ability of children and adolescents with autism have been improved, and the
motor skills of children with autism have been improved as well, while the degree of autism of children
has been reduced. In conclusion, physical activity intervention is beneﬁcial to children and adolescents
with autism, and continuous physical activity intervention can produce greater intervention eﬀect.
In addition, in the future research, children and adolescents with autism can be intervened with other
physical activities, which may also be a reference for improving other symptoms of children and
adolescents with autism through physical activities in the future.
