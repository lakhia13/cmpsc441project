Background: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its far-reaching impact, the prevalence of posttraumatic 
stress  disorder  (PTSD)  symptoms is  increasing  significantly in  China.  Yet  access  to reliable  and effective  psy-
chological treatment is still limited during the pandemic. The widespread adoption of mobile technologies may 
provide a new way to address this gap. In this research we will develop an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
(ACT) based intervention delivered by mobile application and will test its usability, efficacy, and mechanism of 
its effects in relieving PTSD symptoms. 
Methods: A total of 147 Chinese participants with a diagnosis of PTSD according to the Clinician Administered 
PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (app-delivered ACT), an active com-
parison group (app-delivered mindfulness), or a waitlist group. Participants in the intervention group or com-
parison  group  will  use  their  respective  apps  for  one  month.  Online  self-report  questionnaires  will  be  used  to 
assess the primary outcome of PTSD symptoms and the secondary outcomes symptoms of depression, symptoms 
of anxiety, and posttraumatic growth. The potential mediating variable to be tested is psychological flexibility 
and its components. These assessments will be conducted at baseline, at five times during treatment, at the end of 
treatment, and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. 
Discussion: As far as we know, this study is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the usability, ef-
ficacy, and mechanism of an app-delivered ACT intervention for PTSD. Furthermore, the research will assess the 
effect of treatment in reducing dropout rates, explore effective therapeutic components, and investigate mech-
anisms of symptom change, which will be valuable in improving the efficacy and usability of PTSD interventions.

1. Introduction 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on the mental health 
of the global public. Compared to the effects of general stressful events, 
more  severe  mental  health  outcomes,  especially  posttraumatic  stress 
disorder (PTSD), have developed during the pandemic (Olff et al., 2021). 
The  prevalence  of  self-reported  modest-to-severe  posttraumatic  stress 
symptoms in the global general population ranged from 7 % to 53.8 % 
during the pandemic (Xiong et al., 2020; Krishnamoorthy et al., 2020), 
compared to the world average of 3.9 %–7.8 % prior to the pandemic 

(McLaughlin et al., 2015; Koenen et al., 2017). COVID-19 has resulted in 
a  high  demand  for  PTSD  intervention.  However,  access  to  effective 
treatment is still lacking. 

The  imbalance  between  intervention  demand  and  supply  may  be 
attributed to deficiencies in existing intervention programs (Mavrane-
zouli et al., 2020) and limited accessibility of interventions (J.R. Smith 
et  al.,  2020).  Firstly,  the  most  common  interventions  for  PTSD 
(including  prolonged  exposure  therapy,  cognitive  processing  therapy, 
and narrative exposure therapy) focus on the trauma experience and use 
exposure-based  strategies,  with  less  emphasis  on  the  promotion  of

Zhao et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

positive affect and well-being (Cusack et al., 2016; American Psycho-
logical  Association,  2019).  This  focus  may  lead  to  low  adherence  to 
treatment and high dropout rates (Imel et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2011). 
Secondly, under the COVID-19 pandemic in China, restricted medical 
resources  and  prolonged  isolation  have  very  likely  limited  access  to 
traditional face-to-face interventions. Therefore, there is an urgent need 
to develop accessible and effective PTSD intervention programs that can 
be applied to a wide range of populations (Huang et al., 2020). A mobile 
application-delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may 
provide a new approach to large-scale intervention for PTSD. 

ACT is a theory-based behavioral intervention that addresses mental 
disorders  using  a  combination  of  mindfulness  and  acceptance  tech-
niques (Hayes et al., 2012). This approach has been increasingly used in 
PTSD  intervention  and  has  shown  some  uniqueness  in  theoretical 
conceptualization  and  practical  strategies  (Wharton  et  al.,  2019). 
Firstly, the conceptualization of ACT is sufficient to explain the etiology 
of  PTSD.  Avoidance,  the  main  reason  for  the  development  of  PTSD 
symptoms  (McNally  et  al.,  2015),  is  the  focus  of  ACT  interventions 
(Smith  et  al.,  2020).  The  strategies  used  in  ACT,  mainly  teaching 
mindfulness  and  acceptance,  can  help  individuals  reduce  avoidance. 
Other  strategies  include  teaching  individuals  to  pay  attention  to  the 
present,  embrace  internal  experiences,  and  improve  psychological 
flexibility (Hayes et al., 2012; McCracken and Vowles, 2014). It has been 
reported that ACT significantly reduced PTSD symptoms in parents of 
children with life-threatening illnesses (Muscara et al., 2020), combat 
veterans (Dindo et al., 2020; Gobin et al., 2019), and traumatized adults 
(Boals and Murrell, 2016). In practical application, ACT has also been 
shown to be superior to traditional exposure-based therapy in increasing 
participants’  engagement and decreasing the rate of dropout (Phillips 
et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2018). Finally, the emphasis on improving the 
well-being and quality of life is also an advantage of ACT (Dindo et al., 
2021; Krafft et al., 2019). This emphasis has become even more valuable 
under the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Improving accessibility is another important issue to be addressed in 
the treatment of PTSD (J.R. Smith et al., 2020). The widespread adop-
tion of the Internet and mobile technologies provides a potential new 
way  to  improve  the  delivery  of  interventions  (Stefanopoulou  et  al., 
2020).  Compared  with  traditional  face-to-face  therapies,  internet  in-
terventions, especially when delivered via mobile applications (apps), 
are less constrained by time and space, allowing large groups of people 
with  varying  geographical  distances  to  benefit  from  intervention 
(Wickersham  et  al.,  2019). Moreover,  app-delivered  interventions are 
appropriate for situations where face-to-face treatment is not available, 
such  as  quarantine  zones,  which  may  persist  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic (Wu et al., 2020). 

App-delivered ACT interventions have been shown to be helpful in 
the treatment of depression (Pots et al., 2016a; Lappalainen et al., 2014; 
Larsen  et  al.,  1979),  anxiety  (Ivanova  et  al.,  2016),  and  sleep  distur-
bances (Lappalainen et al., 2019). However, in the field of PTSD, the 
exploration of app-based interventions is still in its infancy, and most 
studies have focused on providing ACT via other platforms such as the 
web  and  video  conferences.  These  internet-based  interventions  have 
been used in treating combat veterans (Smith et al., 2021), traumatized 
women  (Fiorillo  et  al.,  2017),  and  parents  of  children  with  life- 
threatening  illness  (Muscara  et  al.,  2020).  However,  internet-based 
ACT has not yet been integrated with mobile app technology. 

In addition to testing the efficacy and usability of an intervention, 
examining potential mediators of treatment effects could help to identify 
the mechanisms of symptom change (Kraemer et al., 2002), thus opti-
mizing  the  development  of  interventions  for  PTSD  patients  (Kangas-
lampi and Peltonen, 2022). According to the therapeutic model of ACT, 
the  core  mediator  of  therapeutic  change  is  psychological  flexibility, 
made  up  of  six  components:  acceptance,  cognitive  defusion,  flexible 
attention  to  the  present,  self-as-observer,  values-based  action,  and 
committed action (Hayes et al., 2011). The mediating effect of psycho-
logical flexibility has been shown in the treatment of distress (Flaxman 

and Bond, 2010), anxiety (Forman et al., 2007; Niles et al., 2014), and 
depression (Forman et al., 2007; Pots et al., 2016b), and in the promo-
tion of psychological adjustment (Rost et al., 2012). In the field of PTSD, 
however, only one study has examined the mediating role of psycho-
logical  flexibility,  with  a  nonsignificant  effect  (Moyer  et  al.,  2018). 
Furthermore, the role of the specific components of psychological flex-
ibility in intervention also deserves attention. Researchers have found 
that specific components of psychological flexibility, such as acceptance 
(Cederberg  et  al.,  2016;  Hesser  et  al.,  2014;  Vasiliou  et  al.,  2022), 
cognitive  defusion  (Vasiliou  et  al.,  2022;  Pakenham  et  al.,  2018; 
Østergaard et al., 2020), and values and committed action (Østergaard 
et al., 2020), play a mediating role in ACT treatment for persons with 
chronic  pain,  tinnitus,  multiple  sclerosis,  depression,  and  primary 
headaches. However, it is noted that different components of psycho-
logical flexibility do not have equal effects on symptom change in gen-
eral psychotherapy (Stockton et al., 2019; Levin et al., 2020). To date, no 
attempt has been made to systematically investigate the specific roles 
and interrelationships of different psychological flexibility components 
in ACT treatment for PTSD. Thus, it is necessary to further explore and 
clarify the effects of the components of psychological flexibility as me-
diators of the effects of ACT on PTSD. Treatment can be more efficient if 
it includes only those aspects that are responsible for change. 

The goals of the present study are twofold. Firstly, we will develop a 
mobile app-delivered ACT intervention for PTSD symptoms and test its 
usability and efficacy. Given that ACT is a mindfulness-based approach 
but  includes  many  other  components  (Banks  et  al.,  2015),  we  will 
include  an  active  comparison  group  in  which  participants  receive 
mindfulness training only. A waitlist control group will also be included. 
This design will allow us to test both the absolute efficacy of the ACT 
intervention  as  well  as  its  relative  advantage  beyond  mindfulness 
training.  Secondly,  we  will  test  the  mediating  effect  of  psychological 
flexibility and further examine the roles and interrelationships among its 
six components. If the app proves to be efficient, it will be valuable in 
alleviating  PTSD  symptoms  and  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  in  the 
COVID-19 pandemic and in other similar situations that preclude access 
to face-to-face therapy. 

2. Method 

2.1. Study design 

The present study will be a randomized controlled trial involving a 
one-month  mobile  app-delivered  ACT  intervention,  with  assessments 
made before the intervention, at five times during treatment, at the end 
of treatment, and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. PTSD patients over 18 
years old will be recruited through advertisements and screened by self- 
report questionnaires and a clinical interview. Based on this assessment, 
eligible  participants  will  be  randomly  allocated  (1:1:1)  to  the  ACT 
intervention group (ACT group), the Mindfulness intervention group (MI 
group), or the Waitlist group (WL group). The ACT group (who received 
the whole ACT intervention) and MI group (who received the mindful-
ness  training  component  of  the  ACT  intervention)  received  treatment 
over  the  course  of  one  month.  Participants  in  the  WL  group  were 
assessed without intervention. This trial was registered in the Chinese 
Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR2200058408 (http://www.chictr.org. 
cn/showproj.aspx?proj=165803).  This  protocol  followed  the  guide-
lines of SPIRIT 2013 (Chan et al., 2013), CONSORT 2010 (the CONSORT 
Group et al., 2010), the TIDieR checklist (Hoffmann et al., 2014), and 
the  mHealth  Evidence  Reporting  and  Assessment  (mERA)  Checklist 
(Agarwal et al., 2016) (see Appendix A). Fig. 1 presents the CONSORT 
flow diagram. 

The  recruitment,  the  intervention,  the  completion  of  self-reported 
questionnaires,  and  the  clinical  interview  will  be  conducted  through 
the Internet in mainland China. All researchers in this project will be 
required  to  have  an  educational  background  in  psychiatry  or 
psychology.

2.2. Sample size 

tests of mediation (Lemmens et al., 2016). 

The results  of previous  RCTs testing  the  effects  of ACT  relative to 
waitlist  and  active  comparison  interventions  (Muscara  et  al.,  2020; 
Dindo et al., 2020; Boals and Murrell, 2016) and a meta-analysis on the 
effects of ACT in a range of study designs (Gloster et al., 2020) produced 
a mean overall medium effect size for PTSD and broader psychological 
disorders. Thus, the expected effect size will be Cohen’s d = 0.5 in the 
present protocol. An a priori power analysis was conducted in G*Power 
3.1 to determine the sample size needed to detect a moderate effect size 
(Cohen’s  d  = 0.5)  with  alpha  = 0.05  and  power  = 0.85.  The  power 
analysis  assumed  that  three  independent  group  means  are  being 
compared  using  two-tailed  tests  in  the  “ANOVA:  Repeated  measures, 
between factors”  member of the F-test family (Faul et al., 2009). The 
power analysis revealed a required sample size of 108 in total and 36 
participants in each group. Considering the drop-out rate of 25.8 % for 
internet-based  interventions  at  6-month  follow-up  (Paganini  et  al., 
2019), at least 147 participants will be needed for randomization with at 
least 49 participants in each group. Furthermore, the sample size of 147 
meets Lemmens et al.’s proposed criterion of a sample size no <40 for 

2.3. Eligibility criteria

2.3.2. Exclusion criteria 

Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded:  

1)  Serious cognitive impairment.  
2)  Uncooperative with questionnaire administration or intervention.  
3)  Imminent risk of suicide.  
4)  Currently in psychological therapy or other clinical trials. 

2.4. Recruitment, randomization, and blinding 

Recruitment  will  be  conducted  via  advertisements  on  the  Internet 
and social media. The advertisements will encourage individuals who 
are suffering from trauma to participate in the intervention. In addition, 
basic  information  about  the  research  team,  the  purpose  of  the  inter-
vention, the rights and responsibilities of research participants, as well 
as potential risks and benefits of the intervention will be presented in the 
advertisements. By scanning the QR code on the advertisements, par-
ticipants can complete the screening questionnaires online and submit 
their responses through QuestionnaireStar (www.wjx.cn). The screening 
questionnaires  will  collect  self-report  information  about  demographic 
characteristics,  the  nature  of  the  traumatic  event,  psychological  and 
pharmacological  treatment  state,  symptoms  of  PTSD  assessed  by  the 
Posttraumatic  Stress  Disorder  Checklist-5  (PCL-5),  co-morbid  condi-
tions, and the risk of suicide. 

Based  on  the  eligibility  criteria,  adult  participants  within  the 
required age range who score 31 or higher on the PCL-5 and meet the 
eligibility criteria will be invited to the clinical interview. The interviews 
will: (1) assess the severity of PTSD symptoms using the CAPS-5 scale; 
(2) provide more information about the current intervention program, 
including  its  objectives,  applicable  population,  duration,  tasks  to  be 
completed, and potential benefits; (3) further confirm important infor-
mation provided by the participants on the screening scale, including 
risk  of  suicide,  the  ability  to  understand  the  questionnaire  indepen-
dently,  and  other  psychological  treatment  plans;  (4)  answer  partici-
pants’ questions about the intervention program. 

Participants who meet CAPS-5 diagnosed PTSD, show no imminent 
risk of suicide, not currently in psychotherapy or other clinical trials, 
and  are  willing  to  participate  in  the  trial  will  be  asked  to  sign  an 
informed consent form. They will then be allocated (1:1:1) to the ACT 
group, the MI group, or the WL group using a randomization website 
(https://www.random.org/lists/). A researcher not participating in the 
study will complete the randomization and grouping. Participants will 
be informed of the general nature of the study, but they will not know 
which group they will be in. The intervention will be carried out via a 
mini-program of the WeChat app, which is one of the most widely used 
social media software in mainland China. Prior to the intervention, re-
searchers  will  contact  participants  via  WeChat  to  obtain  the  signed 
informed consent form and to provide the program package. There will 
be no personal contact during the intervention. 

2.5. Ethical considerations 

This  project has been approved  by the Ethics  Institutional Review 
Board  of  Central  China  Normal  University  (No.:  CCNU-IRB-202103- 
010).  All  participants  will  be  informed  that  their  participation  is 
entirely voluntary and they can withdraw from the study at any time for 
any reason. 

Participants who are not eligible for this trial but show indications of 
mental health problems will be provided with brief guidance and the 
recommendation  to  seek  help.  For  example,  college  students  will  be 
advised to seek support from the mental health center in the university. 
We will assess suicide risk during the participant screening process to 
identify a need for services and to make decisions about inclusion and 
exclusion from the study. The item related to suicide risk on the self- 
report  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9)  (“Thoughts  that  you 
would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way”) will be used to 

evaluate participants’  suicidal  ideation (Kroenke et  al., 2001). Candi-
dates  who  rate  this  item  0  (“Not  at  all”)  or  1  (“Several  days”)  will 
continue with the clinical interview component of the screening process. 
Candidates who rate this item 2 (“More than half the days”) or 3 (“Nearly 
every day”) will be excluded directly from the study but interviewed for 
further  clinical  assessment.  The  clinical  interview  will  evaluate  the 
possibility  of  suicide  by  asking  for  more  detailed  information  about 
suicide ideation, risk factors for suicide, protective factors for suicide, 
and whether there is a suicide plan. Candidates who are considered at 
risk of suicide will be encouraged to access professional suicide inter-
vention, and the suicide hotline will be offered. 

2.6. Intervention 

The ACT intervention and Mindfulness intervention will be provided 
via mini-programs in WeChat. All participants will have a  unique ac-
count on the platform. 

2.6.1.

Intervention development 

Referring  to  Bendtsen  et  al.  (2020),  we  will  adopt  a  three-phase 
approach  to  developing  the  ACT  intervention.  In  the  first  phase  we 
will gather information from PTSD patients, psychiatrists, and clinical 
psychologists to develop ideas for what the content of the interventions 
should be and how the human-computer interaction should be designed. 
In the second phase we will develop the intervention. The content and 
scripts will be developed based on the information gathered in the first 
phase, the ACT Treatment Manual for PTSD (Walser et al., 2007) and 
related studies (Kelly et al., 2020; Reyes et al., 2020). In the third phase 
the  intervention  will  be  programmed  as  a  mobile  app  and  tested  for 
optimization.  Game-inspired  infographics,  personalized  options,  and 
open-ended questions will be used to increase users’ sense of autonomy 
and  control  (Comello  et  al.,  2016),  which  help  to  increase  users’ 
engagement (Fonzo et al., 2019). Pilot interviews will be conducted with 
PTSD patients to resolve technical issues and investigate how the final 
interventions are perceived. Based on the feedback, the intervention will 
be revised and adjusted. This process will be repeated as necessary until 
the developers and PTSD patients reach a consensus on the intervention 
script.  Finally,  the  interventions  developed  in  the  third  phase  will  be 
tested in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate their usability and 
efficacy. 

2.6.2. ACT intervention 

The  mobile  app-delivered  ACT  intervention  is  a  self-help  program 
consisting of an introductory module and six intervention modules on 
the  following  themes:  1)  exploring  ways  to  cope;  2)  control  as  the 
problem; 3) options beyond control; 4) self-as-observer; 5) value living; 
6) committed action. Details of the introductory and the six modules can 
be found in Appendix B. 

Participants in the ACT group will complete six intervention modules 
with an interval of five days, 30–60 min per module, over the course of 
one month. After registration, participants will be able to directly access 
the  introductory  module,  which  contains  a  brief  introduction  to  the 
symptoms of PTSD, the concept and process of the ACT intervention, and 
how to use the app. Participants will not be able to move to the next 
module  without  completing  the  introductory  module.  That  is,  the  six 
modules will be unlocked sequentially after the participants complete 
the previous one. Participants’ progress can be tracked in the backend, 
and a reminder will be given by the program if the intervention is not 
completed within the given time. 

2.6.3. Mindfulness intervention 

Mindfulness  is  one  of  the  most  important  intervention  strategies 
taught in ACT (Godbee and Kangas, 2020). We will use a dismantling 
paradigm  to  disengage  mindfulness  training  from  the  standard  ACT 
intervention. This will allow us to investigate the relative efficacy of the 
whole  ACT  intervention  compared  to  the  Mindfulness  component  in 

InternetInterventions30(2022)1005854Z. Zhao et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

alleviating  PTSD  symptoms.  That  is,  we  will  be  able  to  address  the 
question of whether one part of the ACT intervention is as effective as 
the whole ACT intervention (Bell et al., 2013). 

The mindfulness exercises in the six modules of the ACT intervention 
will be selected as the material for the Mindfulness intervention, which 
will include an introductory module and six intervention modules, each 
containing three to five mindfulness exercises. Firstly, the introductory 
module will provide a brief introduction to the symptoms of PTSD, the 
concept  and  process  of  achieving  mindfulness,  and  how  to  use  this 
program. Then participants will complete the six modules of mindful-
ness training with an interval of five days, 20–40 min per module, and 
the training will last one month. The basic design and functionality of 
the Mindfulness intervention will be consistent with those in the ACT 
intervention,  including  a  user-friendly  design,  sequentially  unlocked 
modules,  and  reminders  to  complete  the  intervention  modules  as 
planned. 

2.6.4. Waitlist group 

Participants in the Waitlist group will only complete the question-
naire measures, with the measurement time points matched to the ACT 
group and the MI group. The Waitlist group will receive no intervention 
during the study, but at the end of the research, the ACT intervention 
program will be offered. 

2.7. Measures 

All  questionnaire  data  will  be  collected  online.  We  will  measure 
background  information  as  part  of  the  screening  questionnaires. 
Outcome and mediating variables will be assessed at baseline, at five 
times during the intervention, and post-treatment. Long-term follow-up 
will be conducted 1- and 3-months post-treatment. The assessment time 
points are detailed in Table 1. 

2.7.1. Background information 

A self-developed questionnaire will be used to collect information on 
demographic  characteristics,  including  age,  gender,  residence,  educa-
tion level, marital status, work status, self-assessed income status, and 
occupation type. 

Trauma  exposure  will  be  assessed  by  the  17-item  Life  Events 
Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) (Weathers et al., 2013a), which measures 
exposure to 17 potentially traumatic events (e.g., “sexual assault”) and 6 
levels of exposure (“happened to me”, “witnessed it”, “learned about it”, 
“part of my job”, “not sure”, and “doesn’t apply”). In addition, the age at 
the time of the trauma will be collected. 

2.7.2. Primary outcome 

PTSD symptoms will be assessed by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
Checklist-5 (PCL-5) (Weathers et al., 2013b). The PCL-5 is a 20-item self- 
report  measure  that  assesses  PTSD  symptoms  including  intrusion  (5 
items), avoidance (2 items), negative changes in cognition and mood (7 
items), and arousal (6 items). Each item is rated from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 
(“extremely”), resulting in a total score of 0 to 80, where higher scores 
indicate higher level of PTSD symptoms. A tentative diagnosis of PTSD is 
defined as a total score at or above 31 (Franklin et al., 2015). The Chi-
nese version of PCL-5 has shown good reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) 
(Cheng et al., 2020). 

2.7.3. Secondary outcomes 

The  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  Scale  (GAD-7)  (Spitzer  et  al., 
2006) is  a seven-item self-report measure that assesses anxiety symp-
toms in the past two weeks. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety 
symptoms. The Chinese version of the GAD-7 has shown excellent in-
ternal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.89) (Tong et al., 2016). 

depression  symptoms.  The  Chinese  version  of  the  PHQ-9  has  shown 
excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.89) (Chen et al., 2013). 
The  Posttraumatic  Growth  Inventory  Short  Form  (PTGI-SF)  (Cann 
et al., 2010) is a self-report measure of posttraumatic growth. The 10- 
item  Short  Form  was  adapted  from  the  original  PTGI  21-item  scale 
(Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1996). Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging 
from 0 (“I did not experience this change”) to 5 (“I experienced this change to 
a very great degree”), with higher  scores indicate higher levels  of psy-
chosocial growth. It has demonstrated good internal consistency in the 
Chinese culture (Cronbach’s α = 0.86) (Liu et al., 2020). 

2.7.4. Mediating variables 

The Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory (MPFI-24) 
(Rolffs et al., 2018) is a 24-item self-report questionnaire used to mea-
sure global psychological flexibility and its six components (acceptance, 
present moment awareness, self as context, defusion, values, committed 
action). Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (“never true”) to 
6  (“always  true”).  Ratings  are  averaged  and  higher  scores  indicate 
greater psychological  flexibility. The  measure has demonstrated good 
internal consistency (Gr´egoire et al., 2020). 

2.7.5. Usability variable 

The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) (Larsen et al., 1979) 
will be used to assess the usability of the intervention program. The CSQ- 
8 consists of eight items rated on a scale from 1 to 4, with higher ratings 
indicating higher usability. Summed ratings between 8–20, 21–26, and 
27–32  are  viewed  as  indicating  low,  medium,  and  high  levels  of  us-
ability,  respectively.  CSQ-8  has  excellent  internal  consistency  (Cron-
bach’s α = 0.93) (Trompetter et al., 2015). 

2.8. Statistical analysis 

All available data will be used in the analyses based on the intention- 
to-treat principle. Baseline characteristics will be compared among the 
ACT group, MI group, and WL group using ANOVAs or chi-square tests. 
Results  with  two-sided  p  < .05  will  be  considered  statistically 
significant. 

Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) will be conducted to analyze 
the  effect  of  interventions,  determine  the  potential  moderators  of 
treatment effects, and evaluate the potential mediating effects of psy-
chological  flexibility  and  its  components  (Bollen  and  Curran,  2006; 
Duncan et al., 2013). LGCM is suited to the present research because it 
allows simultaneous analysis at multiple time points, so we can examine 
the continuous change of mediators and outcomes during the treatment 
phase (Thiruchselvam et al., 2019). 

To  estimate  intervention  effects,  we  will  use  PTSD  symptoms, 
depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and posttraumatic growth as 
repeated measures at each time point in the three groups (ACT group, MI 
group, and WL group). These values are the observed indicators, with 
the  latent  intercept  and  slope  being  estimated.  Referring  to  previous 
research (Mason et al., 2003), we will firstly estimate four unconditional 
LGCMs to examine the shape of the growth curves in PTSD symptoms, 
depression,  anxiety,  and  posttraumatic  growth,  respectively.  Then,  to 
examine  the  intervention  effects,  four  expanded,  conditional  LGCMs 
that  include  “group”  as  an  exogenous  predictor  of  slope  will  be  esti-
mated. Intervention effects will be indicated by a statistically significant 
estimate of the effect of the group variable on changes in primary and 
secondary outcomes. In addition, to determine potential moderators of 
intervention effects, demographic characteristics (age, gender, and the 
number  of  traumatic  events),  initial  symptom  levels  (initial  PTSD, 
depression, and anxiety), and psychological characteristics (initial psy-
chological  flexibility  and  posttraumatic  growth)  will  be  used  as  pre-
dictors of the slope in expanded, conditional LGCMs. 

The  Patient  Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ-9)  (Kroenke  and  Spitzer, 
2002)  is  a  nine-item  self-report  measure  that  assesses  symptoms  of 
depression  in  the  past  two  weeks.  Higher  scores  indicate  more 

To test mediation, repeated measurements of symptoms of PTSD and 
psychological flexibility collected at all time points will be included as 
observed  indicators,  with  the  latent  intercept  and  slope  factor  being

estimated. The tests of potential mediation effects will be conducted in 
three  steps  (Cheong  et  al.,  2003).  Firstly,  an  unconditional  parallel- 
process of PTSD symptoms and psychological flexibility will be speci-
fied to estimate the growth trajectories and temporal stability for the 
ACT group and WL group. Secondly, conditional LGCMs will be used to 
investigate the effects of the intervention on PTSD symptoms and the 
components of psychological flexibility as potential mediators. Thirdly, 
the longitudinal mediation model will be tested to examine the changes 
in slopes of the outcomes and potential mediators, so we can investigate 
whether the ACT intervention reduces PTSD symptoms via increasing 
psychological flexibility. 

All LGCMs will be performed using maximum likelihood (ML) esti-
mation.  Compared  with  traditional  missing  data  methods,  ML  yields 
more efficient and less biased parameters even when the assumption of 
data being missing at random is not strictly satisfied (Little and Rubin, 
1989). Model fit will be evaluated using the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), 
Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Standardized Root 
Mean Square Residual (SRMR), and the Relative Chi-Square Ratio (χ2/ 
df). CFI > 0.90, RMSEA and SRMR <0.08, and χ2/df < 3 indicate good 
model fit  (Hu and  Bentler, 1998). Preliminary  statistical analysis and 
LGCM will be performed using SPSS 20.0 and Mplus 8.0, respectively. 

3. Discussion 

Due to the impact of COVID-19 and its subsequent effects, the inci-
dence of PTSD is increasing dramatically around the world (Olff et al., 
2021).  However,  access  to  reliable  mental  health  treatment  is  still 
limited (Wu et al., 2020). As a result, it is necessary to develop effective, 
accessible PTSD interventions that can be applied in large populations. 
The  widespread  adoption  of  mobile  technologies  in  China  provides  a 
potential  new  way,  namely  the  use  of  smartphone  apps,  to  improve 
mental health care delivery (Van Ameringen et al., 2017). The primary 
aim  of  the  present  study  is  to  investigate  the  usability,  efficacy,  and 
mechanism of the effects of a mobile app-delivered ACT intervention for 
PTSD symptoms. 

The  results  of  the  current  trial  will  have  implications  for  PTSD 
treatment. As the pandemic continues, public mental health will become 
an  increasingly  prominent  public  issue,  and  the  gap  between  the  de-
mand  for  mental  health  services  and  the  available  supply  will  likely 
continue to be significant. In this context, app-delivered interventions 
have the potential to be used as primary, brief “minimal interventions” 
before the use of traditional psychological therapies. This approach is 
indicated  by  the  stepped  care  model  (Bower  and  Gilbody,  2005).  If 
shown  to  be  efficacious,  the  current  app-delivered  ACT  intervention 
program  will  be  expected  to  serve  as  “the  first  step”  for  the  general 
population  in  the  epidemic.  This  approach  can  help  to  improve  the 
existing  psychological  service  system,  optimize  the  allocation  of  psy-
chological service resources, and provide treatment while face-to-face 
psychotherapy is unavailable during the pandemic. However, it should 
be noted that the current trial will evaluate the intervention effects using 
only self-reported outcome measures, which may create a risk of bias 
due to social desirability and shared method variance and reduce the 
generalizability of the results to clinical practice (Tønning et al., 2019).
