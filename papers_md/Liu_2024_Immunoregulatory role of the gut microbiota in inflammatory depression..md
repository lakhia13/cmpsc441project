Inﬂammatory depression is a treatment-resistant subtype of depression. A
causal role of the gut microbiota as a source of low-grade inﬂammation
remains unclear. Here, as part of an observational trial, we ﬁrst analyze the gut
microbiota composition in the stool, inﬂammatory factors and short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs) in plasma, and inﬂammatory and permeability markers in
the intestinal mucosa of patients with inﬂammatory depression
(ChiCTR1900025175). Gut microbiota of patients with inﬂammatory depres-
sion exhibits higher Bacteroides and lower Clostridium, with an increase in
SCFA-producing species with abnormal butanoate metabolism. We then per-
form fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and probiotic supplementation in
animal experiments to determine the causal role of the gut microbiota in
inﬂammatory depression. After FMT, the gut microbiota of the inﬂammatory
depression group shows increased peripheral and central inﬂammatory fac-
tors and intestinal mucosal permeability in recipient mice with depressive and
anxiety-like behaviors. Clostridium butyricum administration normalizes the
gut microbiota, decreases inﬂammatory factors, and displays antidepressant-
like effects in a mouse model of inﬂammatory depression. These ﬁndings
suggest that inﬂammatory processes derived from the gut microbiota can be
involved in neuroinﬂammation of inﬂammatory depression.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains challenging to prevent and
treat, mainly due to its highly heterogeneous features and multi-
factorial processes underlying the disease1. The neuroimmune
hypothesis of depression was ﬁrst proposed in 19952. During the last
few decades, several evidences have accumulated that inﬂammation
plays an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of MDD3,4.
This type of depression is linked to increased pro-inﬂammatory cyto-
kines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),
C-reactive protein (CRP), and several other factors, and these inﬂam-
matory factors may help distinguish between inﬂammatory and non-

inﬂammatory depression5–7. Considering the stability, accuracy, and
availability of various inﬂammatory indicators, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and American Heart Association (CDC/AHA)
recommended CRP as an inﬂammatory marker in clinical and public
health practice. Furthermore, the threshold of low-risk (<1.0 mg/L),
average-risk (1.0–3.0 mg/L), and high-risk (>3.0 mg/L) correspond to
the approximate tertiles of CRP in the adult population8. Similarly, the
CRP concentration (>3.0 mg/L) has been used as a biomarker of
inﬂammatory depression9, which has unique clinical and biological
characteristics1. In addition, patients with inﬂammatory depression

may represent a relatively treatment-resistant population10. For
instance, the presence of inﬂammation in MDD is associated with a
poorer response to ﬁrst-line antidepressant therapies11–13, accordingly,
this subpopulation of patients is particularly challenging to treat.
Therefore, it is crucial to explore the precise origin of inﬂammation
and its pathogenic mechanisms
to develop more effective
treatments14.

Studies suggest that the intestinal tract, especially disordered
microbiota, could be a major source of inﬂammation that contributes
to neurodegeneration15,16. The gut microbiota can directly modulate
the immune system and contribute to the maintenance and break-
down of immune tolerance17. Furthermore, microbe-associated mole-
cular patterns (MAMPs) expressed during dysbiosis are recognized by
host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), toll-like receptors (TLRs)18,
and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors
(NLRs) such as NLRP3 inﬂammasomes19. These receptors are the
gateways to the innate immune system and are the ﬁrst step in the
cascade leading to cytokine production20. These cytokines increase
intestinal permeability21 and disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
They can also activate microglia in the central nervous system (CNS)22,
leading to the secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines that alter brain
structure and function23, further lead to clinical depression24. Gut
microbiota have also been shown to produce a range of beneﬁcial
metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can affect
immune and inﬂammatory responses20. SCFAs can affect intestinal
mucosal immunity and the CNS immune system by crossing the BBB to
modulate brain function25. Thus, gut microbiota may inﬂuence
depressive symptoms by regulating the peripheral and central immune
systems. Several studies have attempted to explore the “microbiota-
gut-immune-brain axis” hypothesis in MDD16,26, but their results are
inconsistent due to the high heterogeneity of depression. Therefore, it
is necessary to elucidate this hypothesis by considering the inﬂam-
matory subtypes of depression. In conclusion, disturbed gut micro-
biota may be the source of low-grade inﬂammation. As of now, the gut
microbiota’s features and its role of immunoregulation in this subtype
of depression remains uncertain.

To clarify the gut microbiota composition and the mechanisms
involved in inﬂammatory depression, we performed experiments
using human and mouse samples. First, we analyzed the gut micro-
biota, intestinal permeability, SCFA concentration, and inﬂammatory
cytokine concentration in patients with inﬂammatory depression. We
found pro-inﬂammatory genera was increased and SCFA-producing
genera was decreased in inﬂammatory depression patients. Then, we
performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and probiotic sup-
plementation, and identiﬁed that disordered gut microbiota can
induce inﬂammatory depression by activating Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR-4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and NLRP3-mediated inﬂam-
matory cascades and the SCFA-producing gut microbes can regulate
inﬂammatory responses and improve depressive symptoms. The
results lay a foundation for potential prevention/intervention/treat-
ment of inﬂammatory depression through gut microbiota and meta-
bolome alteration.

Clinical characteristics, inﬂammatory factors, and SCFAs in MDD
and HCs. Patients with MDD and HCs were similar in age, sex, and body
mass index (BMI) (P > 0.05). The patients in this cohort had no other
somatic conditions and were not overweight. Patients with MDD had
signiﬁcantly fewer years of education than the HCs (P < 0.001). The
MDD group had higher total Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(HAMD-17) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores than the
HC group (P < 0.001). We detected higher level of hs-CRP in the MDD

group than that in the HC group (P < 0.05); however, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10,
and TNF-α concentration showed no signiﬁcant differences between
the two groups (P > 0.05). The MDD group had a signiﬁcantly lower
propionic and butyric acid levels than the HCs (P < 0.05). However,
acetic acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid levels were
comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05) (Table 1).

Gut microbiota composition between MDD patients and HCs
Alpha-diversity analysis showed that the Chao index, Faith’s Phyloge-
netic Diversity (PD), and the number of observed species were higher
in patients with MDD than those in HCs. However, Good’s coverage
was lower in patients with MDD (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). Beta diversity
analysis demonstrated that the difference between the groups was
larger than the differences within the groups, with permutational
multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) analysis based on Jaccard dissim-
ilarity (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). A linear discriminant analysis effect size
(LEfSe) test was used to investigate microbiota discrepancies between
patients with MDD and HCs. At the family level, the relative abun-
dances of Micromonosporaceae and Rhodospirillaceae were sig-
niﬁcantly higher in patients with MDD; however, the abundances of
Clostridiaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Tur-
icibacteraceae were signiﬁcantly higher in HCs. At the genus level, the
relative abundance of Adlercreutzia was signiﬁcantly higher in patients
with MDD; however, the abundances of Clostridium, Roseburia, Hae-
mophilus, SMB53, and Turicibacter were much higher in HCs (Fig. 1C).

Relationship between microbial biomarkers, hs-CRP, SCFAs, and
depressive symptoms
To clarify the relationship between gut microbiota, hs-CRP, SCFAs, and
depressive symptoms, we performed a correlation analysis and found
that the relative abundance of Clostridium, Roseburia, Haemophilus,

SMB53, and Turicibacter was positively correlated with propionic acid
and butyric acid and negatively correlated with hs-CRP and total
HAMD-17 scores in all subjects (P < 0.05). The hs-CRP level also posi-
tively correlated with the total HAMD-17 and HAM-A scores
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 1D).

exposed that the Chao index, Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (PD), Observed species
were higher in MDD patients (n = 85) than in HCs (n = 85), The Good’s coverage was
lower in MDD patients (P < 0.05). Two-sample T test was used. Data are presented

diversity analysis uncovered that the difference between MDD patients (n = 85) and
in HCs (n = 85) was larger than the difference within group by the permanova
analysis based on Jaccard dissimilarity (P = 0.0006). Permutation test was used.
Data are presented as mean values with SD. Box plots indicate median and inter-

linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) showed that at the family level,
the relative abundance of Micromonosporaceae and Rhodospirillaceae was sig-
niﬁcantly higher in MDD patients, however, the amount of Clostridiaceae, Pep-
tostreptococcaceae, Pasteurellaceaewas and Turicibacteraceae signiﬁcantly higher
in HCs. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Adlercreutzia was signiﬁcantly
higher in MDD patients, however, the abundance of Clostridium, Roseburia, Hae-
mophilus, SMB53, and Turicibacter were much higher in HCs. Blue and red colors
represent HCs and MDD, respectively. D The correlation analysis were performed
among different genus of gut bacteria, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), hs-CRP and

severity of depression and anxiety. It was found the relative abundance of Clos-
tridium, Roseburia, Haemophilus, SMB53, and Turicibacter were the level of Acetic
acid, Propionic acid and Butyric acid were positively correlated with Propionic acid
and Butyric acid, and negatively correlated with hs-CRP and the total score HAMD-
17 in all subjects (P < 0.05). The hs-CRP was positively correlated with the total score
HAMD-17 and HAMA (P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analyses were implemented
with FDR correction. The red and blue of the table represent positive and negative
correlations respectively. P-value is marked as follows: ***P ≤ 0.001; **P ≤ 0.01;
*P ≤ 0.05. E Different cytokine in intestinal mucosa between MDD (n = 6) and HCs
(n = 6). The antibody cytokine array consisting of 80 inﬂammatory factors was used
to screen for differential intestinal mucosal inﬂammatory factors between MDD
and HCs. The heatmap shows that tumor necrosis factor alpha-R1 (TNF-R1), TNF-R2,
Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (MCSF) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) are
overexpressed, however, Growth Hormone (GH), Fibroblast Growth Factors 4 (FGF-
4), Transforming Growth Factor 1β (TGF-1β) and Endocrine Gland-derived Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (EG-VEGF) that involved in intestinal mucosal repair are
underexpressed in MDD patients compared to HCs. The data was analyzed by
moderated t-statistics and corrected by the Benjamini–Hochberg method. All sta-
tistical tests are two-sided. Source data are provided as a Source Data ﬁle.

Inﬂammatory parameters and permeability biomarkers for
intestinal mucosa in patients with MDD and HCs
To explore the effect of the disturbed gut microbiota on the intestinal
mucosa, intestinal mucosal samples from 12 subjects (MDD = 6, HC =
6) (Supplementary Table S1) were screened using a glass slide-based
antibody cytokine array containing 80 inﬂammatory proteins (Ray-
Biotech, GSH-INF-3, GSH-GF-1). The heatmap shows that some cyto-
kine proteins involved in inﬂammatory activation, such as TNF-R1,
TNF-R2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), and IL-12, were
overexpressed. However, growth hormone (GH), ﬁbroblast growth
factor 4 (FGF-4), transforming growth factor 1β (TGF-1β), and endo-
crine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF), all
of which are involved in intestinal mucosal repair, are underexpressed
in patients with MDD compared to HCs (Fig. 1E).

To further clarify the inﬂammatory pathway and quantify the
intestinal permeability markers, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA) was used. TLR-4, NF-κB, and NLRP3 levels increased in the MDD
group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). Levels of permeability biomarkers, such as
Claudin-1, ZO-1, and Occludin, were decreased (P < 0.05) (Supplemen-
tary Table S1) (Fig. 2B); this was conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry.
Correlation analyses showed that the relative abundance of Clos-
tridium was negatively correlated with the levels of MCSF and hs-CRP,
and inﬂammatory factors were negatively correlated with permeability
biomarkers (Claudin-1, ZO-1, Occludin) and SCFAs (acetic acid, pro-
pionic acid, and butyric acid); they were positively correlated with
HAMD-17 total score. The butyric acid level was positively correlated
with occludin and negatively correlated with TLR-4, NF-κB, NLRP3,
TNFR2, and HAMD-17. Claudin-1 was positively correlated with the
intestinal mucosal repair markers, such as GH and EG-VEGF (Fig. 2C,
Supplementary Fig. S2).

Part II: Human study in subjects with inﬂammatory depression,
non-inﬂammatory depression, and HCs. Not all depressions are
associated with an inﬂammatory response.
It is estimated that
inﬂammatory depression accounts for only 30% of all depressions.
Since inﬂammatory depression has a poor response to ﬁrst-line anti-
depressant therapies, it is necessary to study the pathogenesis of dif-
ferent subtypes of depression. We further divided patients with MDD
into an inﬂammatory depression group (n = 42) and a non-
inﬂammatory depression group (n = 43) based on plasma hs-CRP
levels. The cut-off value8 was the second tertile (66.7%) of hs-CRP in the
peripheral blood of HCs (n = 128), with a value of 110.67 (Supplemen-
tary Table S3).

Gut microbiota features in inﬂammatory depression
To clarify the characteristics of the gut microbiota in inﬂammatory
depression, LEfSe analysis was performed among the three groups.
Compared with non-inﬂammatory depression and HCs, the relative
abundances of pro-inﬂammatory bacteria, such as Bacteroidaceae
and Bacteroides were signiﬁcantly higher. It was also found that the
relative abundances of anti-inﬂammatory bacteria, such as Clos-
tridiaceae and Clostridium, which can produce SCFAs, were lower in
patients with inﬂammatory depression (Fig. 3A). To determine the
biomarkers between patients with inﬂammatory depression and HCs,
and between inﬂammatory depression and non-inﬂammatory
depression at the genus level, a receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve was constructed by combining all different genera. ROC
curve analysis showed that the AUC was 81.73% and 79.16%, respec-
tively (Fig. 3B).

To further identify the speciﬁc microbiota at the species level
and guide the treatment for inﬂammatory depression, stool samples
from 20 patients with inﬂammatory depression and 20 randomly
selected HCs were analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequen-
cing. LEfSe analysis revealed that the relative abundances of 43
species were signiﬁcantly lower in the inﬂammatory depression
group, and nine bacterial species were enriched in the inﬂammatory
depression group (Fig. 3C). To create accurate diagnostic models for
inﬂammatory depression, ROC curves were constructed by combin-
ing all the different species, and the AUC was found to be
100% (Fig. 3D).

The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
orthology (KO) database was used to analyze functional gene
sequences between the two groups. We found that the expression of
K00244 (fumarate reductase A) was signiﬁcantly decreased in the
inﬂammatory depression group. K00244 was annotated into the
KEGG pathway maps, and we found that butanoate metabolism
(map00650) was abnormal
in these samples (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Correlation analysis found that the K00244 abundance was
signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with the HAMD-17 scores
(r = −0.439, P = 0.005), and that it was positively correlated with the
level of butyric acid (r = 0.374, P = 0.023) (Fig. 3E). Some decreased

tridium_sp.CAG_417, Faecalibacterium_sp. AF27-11BH, and Eubacter-

bacterium diversum levels were positively correlated with hs-CRP
and depressive symptoms (Fig. 3F).

correlated with TLR-4, NF-κB, NLRP3, TNFR2 and HAMD-17. The Claudin-1 was
positively correlated with intestinal mucosal repair markers such as GH and EG-
VEGF. Pearson correlation analyses were implemented with FDR correction. The

The inﬂammatory factors and permeability biomarkers of
intestinal mucosa in inﬂammatory depression
Compared with the non-inﬂammatory depression group (n = 3), the
inﬂammatory group showed increased inﬂammatory factors: TLR-4,
NF-κB, NLRP3, Caspase-1, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, and MCSF. Moreover, the
permeability of biomarkers ZO-1 and occludin were decreased in the
intestinal mucosa of inﬂammatory depression (n = 3). However, only
the differences among NF-κB, TNF-RII, and occludin were statistically
signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3G).

Gut microbiome transplantation from patients with inﬂammatory
depression induces depressive-like behaviors in recipient mice. To
determine whether depression-related behavioral phenotypes were
linked to disturbed gut microbiota, we performed FMT experiments
(Fig. 4A). After FMT, the mice in the high inﬂammation group consumed
less sucrose in the sucrose preference test (SPT), indicating that the mice
showed more anhedonia-like behavior (P < 0.05). In the open-ﬁeld test
(OFT), mice in the high inﬂammatory group showed decreased activity
(less total distance traveled) and increased anxiety (reduced travel in the
exposed center region away from the walls) compared to the low-
inﬂammatory group, HC group, and blank group (P < 0.05). Similarly, the
duration of immobility in the tail suspension test (TST) increased in the

high-inﬂammatory group compared to that in the HC group (P = 0.061)
and blank group (P = 0.070), suggesting increased depressive-like
behavior (despair). The weight of mice in the high inﬂammatory group
was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the low-inﬂammatory group, HC
group, and blank group (P < 0.05), and the weight change of mice in the
high inﬂammatory group was smaller than that in the other groups
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 4B, C). To determine the effect of ﬂuid intake on body
weight, we compared the total ﬂuid intake of the mice during behavioral
testing. However, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
between the groups (P > 0.05). Collectively, these behavioral tests
showed that mice transplanted with the microbiota of patients with
inﬂammatory depression displayed lower weight, smaller weight change,
decreased activity, increased anxiety, and depressive-like behaviors.

Dysbiosis of gut microbiota in the high-inﬂammatory group
To determine whether
the discriminative microbial markers
characteristic of inﬂammatory depression successfully colonized the
high inﬂammation group, we characterized the gut microbial
composition.

Alpha-diversity analysis showed that the Simpson index was
lower in the high inﬂammatory group than that in the low-
inﬂammatory group, HC group, and blank group (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 4D1). Beta diversity analysis revealed a notable difference in the
bacterial community composition between the high-inﬂammatory
group and other groups, as determined by Jaccard dissimilarity

microbiota discrepancies among the four groups and revealed that
the relative abundances of Bacteroidaceae and Bacteroides were
signiﬁcantly higher in the high-inﬂammatory group; however, the
amounts of Clostridiales and Clostridia were signiﬁcantly higher in
the HC group (Fig. 4D3).

Elevated inﬂammatory factors and permeability in the intestinal
mucosa in the high inﬂammatory group
Disturbed microbiota can affect the immune and inﬂammatory path-
ways, leading to immune activation and inﬂammation of the intestinal
mucosa, further damaging the intestinal barrier27. Therefore, we
investigated the effects of gut microbiota in inﬂammation by qPCR and

Fig. 3 | Gut microbiota characteristics, intestinal mucosal inﬂammatory factors
and permeability biomakers of inﬂammatory depression. A To clarify the
characteristics of gut microbiota in inﬂammatory depression, The LEfSe analysis
was performed among three groups and found that compared with Non-
inﬂammatory depression and HCs, the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and
Bacteroides were signiﬁcantly higher, Clostridiaceae and Clostridium were lower in
Inﬂammatory depression patientsl. B To determine the biomarkers for dis-
criminating between inﬂammatory depression and HC, between inﬂammatory
depression and Non-inﬂammatory depression at the genus level, the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve were made to by combining all different
genus. The ROC analysis showed that the AUC was 81.73% and 79.16% separately.
C To further identify the speciﬁc microbiota at species level and guide treatment,
the shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used for gut microbiota of inﬂamma-
tory depression (n = 20) and HCs (n = 20). We performed LEfSe analysis and found
at the species level, the relative abundance of 43 species was signiﬁcantly lower in
the inﬂammatory depression group, and 9 bacterial species were enriched in
Inﬂammatory depression. D To make accurate diagnostic models for inﬂammatory
depression, ROC curve were made to by combining all different species and found
the AUC was 100%. E The different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) orthology (KO) analysis found the expression of K00244 (fumarate
reductase A, an enzyme involved in the butanoate metabolism) was signiﬁcantly

decreased in Inﬂammatory depression group (n = 20). Two-sample T test was used.
Data are presented as mean values with SD. Box plots indicate median and inter-
quartile range. The upper and lower whiskers indicate minima and maxima. The
correlation analysis found the K00244 abundance was signiﬁcant negative corre-
lated with the HAMD-17 scores (r = −0.439, P = 0.005), and positive correlated with
the level of butyric acid (r = 0.374, P = 0.023). Pearson correlation analyses were
implemented. F The correlation analysis showed that the relative abundance of
abnormal gut microbiota were associated with hs-CRP, SCFAs, K00244, HAMD-17.
Red and blue color represent positive correlation and negative correlation,
respectively. Pearson correlation analyses were implemented with FDR correction.

factors and permeability biomakers of intestinal mucosa in inﬂammatory depres-
sion(n = 3). Compared with Non-inﬂammatory depression group (n = 3), the

Caspase-1 (P = 0.302), TNF-RI (P = 0.318), TNF-RII (P = 0.033), MCSF (P = 0.371), were
increased and the permeability biomakers such as ZO-1 (P = 0.537), Occludin
(P = 0.048) were decreased in intestinal mucosa of inﬂammatory depression. Two-
sample T test was used. Data are presented as mean values with SD. Scatter plot

the permeability of the intestinal mucosa using immunohistochem-
istry. We found that the expression of inﬂammatory factors, such as
TLR-4 and NLRP3 (Fig. 5A), was elevated in the intestinal mucosa of the
high inﬂammatory group compared to that in the low-inﬂammatory
group, HC group, and blank group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we
found that the amount and area density of permeability biomarkers,
such as Claudin-1 and ZO-1 (Fig. 5B), were decreased in the high
inﬂammation group (P < 0.05). The area density of occludin tended to
decrease in the high inﬂammatory group, but there was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference between the high and low inﬂammation
groups (P > 0.05).

Elevated inﬂammatory factors in the serum and brain of mice in
the high-inﬂammatory group
Leaky gut can lead to bacterial translocation across the intestinal
barrier into the circulatory system21. It can also activate inﬂammatory
responses for circulation that can disrupt the BBB. Moreover, it can
activate the microglia of the CNS and release pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines22. We investigated inﬂammatory factors in the serum and
brains of mice and found that the concentration of hs-CRP in ser-
um (Fig. 5A) and the expression of TLR-4, NF-κB, NLRP3, Caspase-1,
and IL-1β in the brain (Fig. 5C) were increased in the high inﬂammatory
group compared to the low-inﬂammatory group, HC group, and
blank group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we assessed the number and
morphology of microglia in the hippocampus using immuno-
ﬂuorescence and found that the area density of iba-1 and the branches
the microglia increased in the high inﬂammatory group
of
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 5D).

Altered gut microbiota are related to inﬂammatory markers,
permeability markers and depressive-like behaviors in all mice
To identify the correlation between altered gut microbiota, inﬂam-
matory markers, permeability markers, and depressive-like behaviors,
we performed correlation analysis and found that Bacteroidaceae and
Bacteroides were positively correlated with inﬂammatory markers and
depressive-like behaviors, and negatively correlated with permeability
markers. However, Clostridiales and Clostridia were negatively corre-
lated with inﬂammatory markers and depressive-like behaviors, and
positively correlated with permeability markers. Inﬂammatory mar-
kers were negatively correlated with permeability markers and posi-
tively correlated with depression-like behaviors. We also found that
Bacteroidaceae and Bacteroides negatively correlated with Clos-
tridiales and Clostridia respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Part II
Effects of probiotics Clostridium butyricum (CB) on the mouse
model of inﬂammatory depression. Overall, we found that the
abundance of pro-inﬂammatory bacteria increased and that of anti-
inﬂammatory bacteria decreased in the high inﬂammatory mice. To
further examine the relationship between gut microbiota and
depressive symptoms in the high-inﬂammatory mice, we supple-
mented the high-inﬂammatory mice with butyric-producing anti-
inﬂammatory bacteria (CB) and found through alpha-diversity analysis
in the CB group that the Simpson index increased (Fig. 6A). We also
found through beta diversity analysis that the bacterial community
composition was notably different between the high inﬂammatory
group and the CB group (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, LEfSe analysis showed
that the abundance of Clostridia and Clostridiales increased, and that
of Bacteroidaceae and Bacteroides decreased in the CB group (Fig. 6C).
Compared with the high inﬂammatory group, the expression of
the inﬂammatory factors TLR-4 and NLRP3 in the intestinal mucosa,
the concentration of hs-CRP in serum (Fig. 7A), and the expression of
TLR-4, NF-κB, NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1β in the brain (Fig. 7C)
decreased in the CB group (P < 0.05). We found that the permeability
biomarkers Claudin-1 and ZO-1 increased in the CB group (P < 0.05);
while occludin tended to increase. However, the difference was not
statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 7B). The number and branches of microglia
in the hippocampus decreased in the CB group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 7D).

Furthermore, depression-like behaviors were assessed using
behavioral tests. Mice in the CB group consumed more sucrose in the
SPF than did the high-inﬂammatory group or normal saline (NS) group
(P < 0.05). In the OFT, mice in the CB group showed increased activity
(longer total distance traveled) and decreased anxiety (more travel in
the exposed central region away from the walls) (P < 0.05). Similarly,
the duration of immobility in the TST was decreased in the CB group
(P < 0.05). The weight of the mice signiﬁcantly increased, and the
weight change was greater in the CB group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 8).

Discussion
In this clinical study, we found that, compared to HCs, the MDD group
had signiﬁcantly higher hs-CRP and lower propionic acid and butyric
acid levels. Furthermore, we found that patients with MDD showed
different gut microbial diversity and composition, in turn demon-
strating that neuroinﬂammation is involved in the onset and devel-
opment of depression5,28,29. We propose that the gut microbiota
triggers neuroinﬂammation and immune activation in the brain16,28.
Several studies show that manipulation of the intestinal microbiota

inﬂuences brain inﬂammation and function30. Innate immune path-
ways, including the TLR-4/NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways, play important
roles in inﬂammatory activation15,19. Microbial metabolites such as
SCFA are known for their anti-inﬂammatory functions in modulating
immune cell chemotaxis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokine
release31. In addition, we found that patients with MDD had increased

levels of inﬂammatory cytokines and decreased levels of permeability
markers in the intestinal mucosa. This result is consistent with pre-
vious studies27,32. However, this study is unique relative to other work
in that we measured inﬂammatory and permeability markers using
intestinal mucosa biopsies from patients with MDD and HCs. Com-
pared to blood plasma markers, this result was more accurate.

Fig. 4 | Behavioral characteristics and gut microbiota composition in mouse
model of inﬂammatory depression. A The Schematic diagram of mouse treat-
ment and behavioral testing. Mice were given a cocktail of antibiotics to eliminate
gut microbiota and were recolonized with the fecal microbiota of Inﬂammatory
depression patients (High-inﬂammatory group), Non-inﬂammatory depression
patients (Low-inﬂammatory group), HCs (HC group) and normal saline (NS) (Blank
group) respectively. Then High-inﬂammatory group mice were given the probiotics
clostridium butyricum (CB) for 21 days. A series of behavioral tests were carried out
24 h after the last fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotic intervention.
B Behavioral comparisons among recipient mice receiving the gut microbiota
suspension from Inﬂammatory depression patients (n/mice = 7), Non-inﬂammatory
depression patients (n/mice = 8), HCs (n/mice = 7) and normal saline (n/mice = 9).
The mice in the High inﬂammatory group consumed fewer sucrose in the sucrose
preference test (SPT) (P = 0.012). In the open-ﬁeld test (OFT), mice in the High-
inﬂammatory group showed decreased activity (fewer total distance traveled)
(P = 0.001) and increased anxiety (reduced travel in the exposed center region away
from the walls) (P = 0.004). Similarly, the duration of immobility in the tail sus-
pension test (TST) was increased in the High-inﬂammatory group mice (P = 0.061).
The body weight of mice was signiﬁcantly lower and the weight change of mice in

the high inﬂammatory group was also smaller than that in other groups (P = 0.001).

Although we found that patients showed low-grade inﬂammation,
not all patients demonstrate signs of inﬂammation. The pathogenesis
of inﬂammatory depression is more likely explained by the microbiota-
gut-immune-brain axis33. We further divided patients with MDD into
inﬂammatory and non-inﬂammatory depression groups based on the
hs-CRP concentration in the plasma. LEfSe analysis showed increased
pro-inﬂammatory genus Bacteroides and decreased SCFA-producing
genus Clostridium in inﬂammatory depression compared to non-
inﬂammatory depression and HCs. Furthermore, we identiﬁed speciﬁc
microbiota at the species level using shotgun metagenomic sequen-
cing and found that the relative abundances of 43 species were sig-
niﬁcantly lower in inﬂammatory depression. Most of these species
belong to Clostridium and Faecalibacterium, and are correlated with
hs-CRP, SCFAs, and depressive symptoms. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is one of the few studies to explore the characteristics of the
gut microbiota in inﬂammatory depression. Many Clostridium and
Faecalibacterium species have been demonstrated to have anti-
inﬂammatory properties34.

Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is the most abundant bacterium in
the intestinal microbiota of healthy adults, representing over 5% of the
total bacterial population. Recently, many studies have clearly descri-
bed the abundance of F. prausnitzii have been linked to several human
disorders, including depression35,36. Hao et al. showed that F. praus-
nitzii administration led to higher levels of SCFAs in the cecum and
higher levels of cytokine IL-10 in the plasma, preventing the effects of
CUMS on CRP and cytokine IL-6 release36. F. prausnitzii produces a
microbial anti-inﬂammatory molecule protein (MAMP) that has been
suggested to alleviate colitis in vivo and decrease the activation of NF-
κB signaling37.

C. butyricum, a gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic
rod bacterium, is found in the feces of 10–20% of healthy humans38.
Previous studies have reported that CB administration reduced
inﬂammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, and TNF-α, while
increasing IL-10 expression levels in colon tissue39,40. Importantly, they
both produce the SCFA butyrate41, which was conﬁrmed in our study
by the analysis of the differential metabolic pathways of the gut
microbiota. K00244 (fumarate reductase A) plays an important role in
butanoate metabolism and is signiﬁcantly decreased in the inﬂamma-
tory depression group. Butyrate serves as a colonic fuel source, fosters
immunoregulation, and promotes epithelial barrier integrity40. Lower
levels of this genus and species have been associated with inﬂamma-
tory bowel disease, autoimmune disorders, atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease, and mental health disorders including depression32,42.
In animal study, we transplanted gut microbiota from patients
with inﬂammatory depression, non-inﬂammatory depression, HCs,

and normal saline into C57BL/6J mice in the high-inﬂammatory, low-
inﬂammatory, HC, and blank groups, respectively, and found that the
microbial diversity and composition of the mice were similar to that of
the donor. Gut microbiota of inﬂammatory depression mice increased
the inﬂammatory factors TLR-4 and NLRP3 (intestinal mucosa); hs-CRP
(serum); TLR-4, NF-κB, NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and iba-1 (brain); and
intestinal mucosal permeability. We also found that the high- inﬂam-
matory group showed increased depressive and anxiety-like behaviors.
Gut microbiota can directly modulate the immune system, contribut-
ing to the maintenance and breakdown of immune tolerance17. The
main components of the intestinal innate immune system include
Paneth cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer
cells, and mast cells. Most innate immune responses are mediated by
PRRs, such as transmembrane surface or endosome TLRs or NLRs,
which recognize MAMPs expressed by the gut microbiota. Indeed,
enteric bacteria and/or MAMPs can modulate innate immune and
inﬂammatory responses via TLRs and/or NLRs19. The pro-inﬂammatory
dysbiosis in inﬂammatory depression patients, mainly characterized
by a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria and an increase in patho-
genic bacterial strains, could promote the overactivation of the TLR-4/
NF-κB and NLRP3 inﬂammasome signaling pathways in immune/
inﬂammatory cells, which, in turn, could impair both the IEB and BBB
while shaping both peripheral and central neurogenic/immune-
inﬂammatory responses15,19. Furthermore, they activate hippocampal
microglia with an increased number of activated branches22. Activated
microglia trigger a multitude of downstream biological effects on the
neuroendocrine, monoaminergic, and oxidative stress systems23 and
may subsequently lead to clinical depression24.

TLR4s are known to cause inﬂammation by triggering the innate
immune system. Studies have reported that TLR4/NF-κB is a key
transcriptional pathway regulating the secretion of inﬂammatory
cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. NF-κB is activated rapidly via
the MyD88-dependent pathway, which increases the transcription of
downstream inﬂammation-related genes43. The NLRP3 inﬂammasome
is a member of the NLR family and promotes innate immune defense
through the maturation of inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18.
NLRP3 interacts with ASC, activates Caspase-1, and produces
inﬂammation44. Canonical NLRP3 activation depends on NF-κB, the
activation product of the TLR-4 signaling pathway19.

Finally, we found that CB treatment normalized gut microbiota,
repaired “gut leakage,” decreased peripheral and central inﬂammatory
factors, and played an antidepressant-like role in a mouse model of
inﬂammatory depression. CB is a strictly anaerobic gram-positive
endospore-forming probiotic with acid- and heat-resistant properties
that have been widely used to improve gastrointestinal function45. CB

produces acetic and butyric acids, two important components of
SCFAs synthesized by the gut microbiota46. SCFAs are neuroactive
bacterial metabolites that can translocate from the gut lumen to sys-
temic circulation and subsequently cross the BBB47. SCFAs are con-
sidered exhibiting anti-inﬂammatory properties under certain

conditions, thereby mitigating LPS-induced immune responses48.
Moreover, SCFAs may have beneﬁcial effects on the integrity of the
intestinal barrier and the BBB. Butyrate can be systemically dis-
seminated and detected in the rat brain31. Butyrate in the rat brain can
exert neuroprotective effects against neurodegenerative disorders

and improve behavioral deﬁcits via anti-inﬂammatory responses49,
suggesting that it plays an important intermediary role in the alteration
of neurobiological functions. In addition, CB may be involved in the
regulation of the intestinal microbiota by decreasing pro-inﬂammatory
bacteria and increasing beneﬁcial bacteria39. Moreover, we found a
higher abundance of Clostridium and a lower abundance of Bacteroides
at the genus level in the CB group, which may partially suggest CB
colonization. In comparison to patients without CB treatment, the α-
diversity index of gut microbiota was more abundant in patients who
received CB50. Mao et al. showed that CB increased the abundance of

Biﬁdobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Lactococcus species in the gut
microbiome51. Furthermore, Viktoriya et al. found that some Biﬁdo-
bacterium and Lactococcus species also have antidepressant effects in
a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot randomized
clinical trial52. Thus, CB can modulate inﬂammatory responses and
improve depressive symptoms by increasing SCFAs or regulating the
gut microbiota.

Our study has some limitations. First, our clinical sample size
was small, particularly for the intestinal mucosa. In our study,
intestinal mucosa was collected from only 12 subjects, including

was challenging to recruit patients without gastrointestinal
symptoms who are willing to undergo sigmoidoscopy or sigmoid

involved in neuroinﬂammation in patients with inﬂammatory depres-
sion, and the TLR-4/NF-κB and NLRP3 inﬂammasome signaling path-
ways, at least in part, mediate this interaction. Our study suggests that
gut microbiota is a promising therapeutic target for inﬂammatory
depression and provides a scientiﬁc basis for future interventional
studies.

Depression and anxiety severity were evaluated using HAMD-1753 and
HAMA54. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was
used to screen for manic or hypomanic episodes and other psychiatric
disorders55. Individuals were excluded if they had other psychiatric
disorders, any somatic illness, a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse,
or had taken antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics within the
past three months. An advertisement was used to recruit healthy
controls (HCs) from the local community and universities; 85 HCs
participated in the study. The subjects had no physical or somatic
illnesses. In addition, none of the HCs used antibiotics, probiotics,
prebiotics, or synbiotics within the previous three months. Written
informed consent was obtained from all the participants. In addition,
minor participants (age less that 18 years) were involved in this study,
the informed consent was obtained from parents of these participants.
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the
First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China. This study

Clinical

Trial

the

in

Patients with MDD were divided into inﬂammatory and non-
inﬂammatory depression groups based on peripheral blood hs-CRP
concentration. The cut-off point8 was the second tertile (66.7%) of hs-
CRP in the peripheral blood of HCs.

Collection of fecal, blood, and colon biopsy samples
Stool samples were collected after the participants completed the
questionnaire assessments; the samples were immediately frozen at
−80 °C before a DNA extraction kit (Imunobio Co. Ltd., Shenzhen,
China) was utilized for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from stool
samples using a Stool GenDNA kit (CW Biotech Co., Beijing, China).
Ten milliliters of blood were drawn from participants using normal
aseptic techniques. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at
3500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and stored at −80 °C for SCFA, IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-10, TNF-α, and hs-CRP measurement. Subjects were scheduled for a
colonoscopy, and 8 mucosal biopsy samples were taken from the
distal sigmoid colon of each subject; 4 mucosal biopsy samples were
stored in −80 °C refrigerator for inﬂammatory factor measurement by
protein chips and ELISA, and the remaining 4 were placed in formalin
for the detection of intestinal permeability.

Microbiota analysis
The microbiota composition of 85 patients with MDD and 85 HCs was
investigated using 16S RNA sequencing. Gut microbiota from 20
patients with inﬂammatory depression and 20 HCs were randomly
selected for metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Only 16S ribosomal
RNA sequencing was used in the animal experiments, as described in
the online supplemental materials and methods.

Inﬂammatory and permeability marker measurements
Plasma cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and hs-CRP were detected by
ELISA. To prevent the deviation of the data from the detection, we
performed three repeated measurements of the same plasma sample
and then took the average value of the three values. An antibody
cytokine array (RayBiotech, GSH-INF-3 and GSH-GF-1) consisting of 80
inﬂammatory factors was used to screen for differential intestinal
mucosal inﬂammatory factors between patients with MDD and HCs.
Immunohistochemistry and microscopic analyses of the human
intestinal mucosa (n = 6 subjects with MDD and n = 6 HCs) were per-
formed to assess the integrity of the tight junction proteins zonula
occludens 1 (ZO-1) (Antibodies: Servicebio, China, dilution 1:500,
Rabbit, Lot, GB111981)56, Claudin-1 (Antibodies: Servicebio, China,
dilution 1:500, Mouse, Lot, GB12032. https://www.servicebio.cn/

goodsdetail?id=14247), and Occludin (Antibodies: Servicebio, China,
dilution 1:500, Rabbit, Lot, GB111401)57 markers, as described in the
online supplemental materials and methods.

To further clarify the inﬂammatory pathway and quantify intest-
inal permeability, ELISA was used to measure inﬂammatory factors
such as TLR-4, NF-κB, Caspase-1, and NLRP3 inﬂammasomes, in addi-
tion to mucosal permeability markers such as Claudin-1, ZO-1, and
Occludin.

Targeted metabolomic analysis of SCFAs in plasma
Targeted SCFA panel proﬁling was performed using the metabolons in
plasma samples from the participants. 7 SCFAs including acetic acid
(C2), propionic acid (C3), isobutyric acid (C4), butyric acid (C4), iso-
valeric acid (C5), valeric acid (C6), and caproic acid (hexanoic acid, C7)
were quantiﬁed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
as previously published58 and described in the online supplemental
material and methods.

Statistical analyses
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Two-sample t-tests and
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to determine
the differences among the measured data. Data were compared
using the x2 test. Pearson or Spearman correlation analyses were
performed to determine the correlation coefﬁcient, and FDR cor-
rection was used. Data from the protein chips were analyzed using
moderated t-statistics and corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg
method. The threshold of statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05
(two-tailed). No statistical method was used to predetermine
sample size.

Animal study
The animal experiments were approved by Ethical Review Committee
of Experimental Animal Welfare of the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical
University. The schematic diagram of mouse treatment and behavioral
testing is showed in Fig. 4A.

Animal housing
Male C57BL/6 J mice (n = 44) were obtained from SPF Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. (Beijing) (six weeks of age; 4–5 per cage). Mice were main-
tained in a temperature-controlled (21–23 °C) and relative humidity-
controlled (50–60%) environment with a 12/12-h light–dark cycle. The
mice were provided with standard chow and autoclaved water ad
libitum.

Mouse model for inﬂammatory depression
We performed FMT experiments to determine whether inﬂammatory
depression-related behavioral phenotypes were linked to disturbed
gut microbiota. The global gut microbial phenotypes of the randomly
selected subset of samples used for these FMT experiments were
representative of their full population distributions. Ten fecal samples
were randomly selected from patients with inﬂammatory depression,
patients with non-inﬂammatory depression, and HCs for microbiota
transplantation according to the methods described in a previous
study59. Brieﬂy, feces were suspended in glycerin-PBS and centrifuged
immediately after collection. Supernatants containing microbiota
from patients or controls were mixed and used for transplantation.
The gut microbiome of the mice was depleted by oral gavage with a
cocktail of antibiotics as described in previous studies after acclima-
tization for three days60; the procedure is shown in the supplementary
information. After the last gavage of antibiotics (10 d), mice were
randomly classiﬁed into 4 groups: high-inﬂammatory group (n = 20),
low-inﬂammatory group (n = 8), HC group (n = 7), and blank group
(n = 9), received an oral gavage of the microbiota suspension of
patients with inﬂammatory depression, patients with non-

inﬂammatory depression, HCs, and NS (10 μL/g body weight),
respectively, for 3 weeks to reconstruct gut microbiota.

Probiotic intervention
Seven mice with inﬂammatory depression were euthanized after FMT,
and the rest were randomly divided into two groups: probiotic group
(n = 7) and NS group (n = 6). The two groups were administered with
CB (6.3 × 106 CFU/ml) and NS by gavage (0.2 mL/mouse) from
8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. continuously for 3 weeks.

Behavioral testing
All behavioral tests were conducted 24 h after FMT or probiotic
intervention. The results were analyzed using a computerized video-
tracking system or scored manually. SPT, OFT, and TST were used to
evaluate anhedonia, anxiety, and depression in mice respectively as
described in a previous study61–64 and as described in the online sup-
plemental material and methods.

Weighing
All the mice were weighed after FMT and probiotic intervention. In
general, the weight of the mice correlates with appetite.

Blood, fecal, and tissue sample collection and measurement
After the behavioral test, the mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate (0.1 mL/10 g), and blood was obtained from the orbital venous
plexus. These blood samples were centrifuged by 1000 × g for 20 min
to collect the serum samples, which were immediately frozen at −80 °C
for biochemical assay. ELISA was used to measure the concentration of
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). We performed three
repeated measurements of the same plasma sample during ELISA and
then averaged the three values. Stool samples were collected from the
colon, and the microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA
sequencing, as described in the online supplemental material and
methods section. The colon tissues were dissected from euthanized
mice, and the expression of TLR-4 and NLRP3 was detected by quan-
titative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while the permeability
biomarkers Claudin-1 (Antibodies: Servicebio, China, dilution 1:500,
Mouse, Lot, GB12032. https://www.servicebio.cn/goodsdetail?id=
14247), ZO-1(Antibodies: Servicebio, China, dilution 1:500, Rabbit,
Lot, GB111981)56, and Occludin (Antibodies: Servicebio, China, dilution
1:500, Rabbit, Lot, GB111401)57, were measured by immunohis-
tochemistry. The hippocampus was then dissected from the mice’s
brain and stained with iba-1 antibody (Servicebio, China, dilution
1:800, Rabbit, Lot, GB113502. https://www.servicebio.cn/goodsdetail?
id=6764) to assess the amount and morphology of microglia, while the
expression of TLR-4, NF-κB, NLRP3, and Caspase-1 was detected
by qPCR.

Statistical analyses
IBM SPSS version 23.0 was used for the statistical analyses. Results are
expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way
ANOVA and post hoc tests were performed to determine the differ-
ences between the measurement data. Pearson or Spearman correla-
tion analysis was used to determine the correlation coefﬁcients. The
threshold of statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05 (two-tailed).
