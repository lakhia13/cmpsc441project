Abstract

Molecular imaging studies have generated important in vivo insights into the etiology of
schizophrenia and treatment response. This article first reviews the PET and SPECT evidence
implicating dopaminergic dysfunction, especially presynaptic dysregulation, as a mechanism for
psychosis. Second, it summarises the neurochemical imaging studies of antipsychotic action,
focussing on D2/3 receptors. These studies show that all currently licensed antipsychotic drugs
block striatal D2/3 receptors in vivo-a site downstream of the likely principal dopaminergic
pathophysiology in schizophrenia- and that D2/3 occupancy above a threshold is required for
antipsychotic treatment response. However, adverse events, such as extra-pyramidal side-effects
or hyperprolactinemia, become much more likely at higher occupancy levels, which indicates
there is an optimal ‘therapeutic window’ for D2/3 occupancy, and questions the use of high doses
of antipsychotic treatment in clinical practice and trials. Adequate D2/3 blockade by antipsychotic
drugs is necessary but not always sufficient for antipsychotic response. Molecular imaging studies
of clozapine, the one antipsychotic licensed for treatment resistant schizophrenia, have provided
insights into the mechanisms underlying its unique efficacy. To link this pharmacology to the
phenomenology of the illness, we discuss the role of dopamine in motivational salience and show
how i) psychosis could be viewed as a process of aberrant salience, and ii) antipsychotics might
provide symptomatic relief by blocking this aberrant salience. Finally, we discuss the implications
of these PET and SPECT findings for new avenues of drug development.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is amongst the most common of the severe mental illnesses [1;2], and one of
the top ten causes of global disease burden amongst adults [3]. It is a chronic psychotic
disorder with a lifetime prevalence of about 0.7%, primarily affecting adults, and having a

peak age of onset in the early twenties in men, and three or four years later in women [4].
Women show a later second peak around the time of the menopause, although the lifetime
risk for men and women is about equal [4]. In addition to considerable morbidity and high
mortality rate associated with schizophrenia, the health and social care costs for the illness
are substantial: equivalent to about 1.6% of the health care budget in the United Kingdom
each year, for example [5-7].

There are no pathognomic features, or definitive diagnostic tests, for schizophrenia and its
symptoms may be seen in other physical or mental illnesses [8]. The typical symptoms have
been categorised into ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ symptom clusters. ‘Positive symptoms’, such
as hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder, are features of psychosis, whilst alogia,
apathy, anergia, and self-neglect are typical of ‘negative symptoms’ [9]. Schizoaffective
disorder is a related psychotic illness, characterised by the co-occurrence of schizophrenic
symptoms with evidence of significant affective disturbance. There is considerable overlap
between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in terms of symptomatology and
treatment [10].

The pathophysiological basis of schizophrenia is complex, and remains incompletely
understood [11;12]. However, better understanding the molecular processes underlying the
symptoms of the illness is likely to be essential for improving the use of current drug
treatments and to develop new and preventive therapies-as has recently been highlighted
[13;14].

The most enduring neurochemical theory of schizophrenia centres upon dysregulation of
dopaminergic neurotransmission [15]. All currently licensed antipsychotic drugs block
dopamine receptors, indicating that manipulation of dopaminergic function is fundamental
to therapeutic response in psychosis. Positron emission tomography (PET) and the related
technique of single positron emission computerised tomography (SPECT) provide unique
opportunities to explore molecular aspects of dopaminergic function in the brain of
schizophrenic patients in vivo. This review first describes the recent advances arising from
PET and SPECT studies in understanding the nature of dopaminergic abnormalities in
schizophrenia, and then focuses on the new insights which molecular imaging studies have
provided into antipsychotic mechanisms and treatment response.

The pathoetiology of schizophrenia: dopamine’s role

The idea that dopaminergic abnormalities might be linked to schizophrenia initially arose
from several indirect sources of evidence. One major observation was that administration of
the psychostimulant amphetamine, which increases extracellular concentrations of
dopamine, can induce psychotic symptoms akin to those seen in schizophrenia (see review
[16]). Additional evidence came from studies of reserpine. Reserpine blocks the reuptake of
dopamine, leading to its dissipation [17], and, although not a licensed treatment, is an
effective therapy for treating psychosis-indeed plant based therapies containing reserpine
have been used for centuries in India as treatments for illnesses that would now be classified
as schizophrenia. Key evidence for dopamine’s involvement in treatment response came in
the 1970s, when the clinical effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs was found to directly relate
to their affinity for dopamine receptors [18;19]. As a result of this discovery, the leading
hypothesis at this time was that schizophrenia may arise as a result of abnormalities in
dopamine receptor density, and that psychosis may be treated through pharmacological
blockade of these receptors [20;21].

Whilst these findings implicated dopamine in schizophrenia, this was in a rather general way
and there were a number of limitations on the interpretation of the evidence. For example,
both amphetamine and reserpine affect other brain monoamines as well as dopamine, and

subsequent post-mortem findings of brain dopamine D2 receptor densities and dopamine
levels in people with schizophrenia were inconsistent (see review [22]). Furthermore, at this
time there was no clear indication of the locus of dopaminergic abnormality in the living
brain, nor the mechanism by which dopaminergic dysfunction may be related to clinical
symptoms.

PET and SPECT imaging allows quantification of the rate of uptake and degree of specific
binding of radiolabelled compounds in the human brain in vivo. The availability of selective
dopaminergic radiotracers allows inspection of the key stages in the pathway of
dopaminergic synaptic transmission, including capacity for presynaptic dopamine synthesis,
the degree of dopamine release in response to stimuli and concentration of extracellular
dopamine, and the density and availability of the post-synaptic dopaminergic receptors.
Over the last decade or so, the considerable advances in PET/SPECT technology and
increasingly widespread application of this technique has enabled the major aspects of the
dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia to be tested and refined.

Dopamine synthesis and release

Presynaptic dopaminergic availability can be measured using PET imaging with
radiolabelled L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). In the brain, radiolabelled L-DOPA is
converted to dopamine and trapped in dopaminergic nerve terminals. The extent of
radiolabelled L-DOPA uptake thus provides an index of presynaptic dopamine synthesis
capacity and the availability of dopamine for release from presynaptic terminals (see review
[23]). To date, there have been nine PET studies of dopaminergic availability in patients
with schizophrenia; seven have found elevated levels of dopamine synthesis capacity in the
striatum of schizophrenic patients compared to control subjects (see summary table 1
adapted from the review by Howes et al) [24]. In all studies where patients were acutely
psychotic at the time of investigation elevated presynaptic striatal dopamine availability was
detected [25-28]. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that dopamine synthesis is
also increased in patients with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, prior to the onset of
psychosis [28]. At present, increased striatal presynaptic dopamine availability is the most
widely replicated brain dopaminergic abnormality in schizophrenia, and the effect size is
moderate to large (0.63-1.25) [24].

The next step in dopaminergic neurotransmission is the release of dopamine. PET or SPECT
imaging with radiotracers which bind dopamine D2 receptors, such as [11C]raclopride or
[123I]IBZM, may be used to index striatal dopamine release, as these radiotracers compete
with dopamine to bind to dopamine D2 receptors. Decreases in radiotracer binding are
thereby interpreted as reflecting increases in extracellular dopamine. For studies of this type,
a pharmacological challenge of a dopamine-releasing drug, such as amphetamine, may be
applied to probe dopamine release capacity. Using this approach, three investigations have
found evidence of increased dopamine release in patients with schizophrenia compared to
control subjects [29-31]. The extent of radiotracer displacement was approximately doubled
in schizophrenic patients, and the degree of displacement correlated with the degree of
worsening of psychotic symptoms. A SPECT study using a dopamine depletion technique
has also found that baseline occupancy of D2 receptors by dopamine is increased in
schizophrenia, indicating that extracellular dopamine concentrations are also increased at
baseline [32]. Together, these studies provide compelling evidence that presynaptic
dopamine availability and dopamine release are increased in schizophrenia. Although at a
lower level, increased dopamine availability and release has also been observed in subjects
who are at increased risk of developing schizophrenia and who experience mild
schizophreniform symptoms, suggesting this dopamine dysregulation may also underlie the
development of the illness [28;33].

Dopamine D2 Receptors

Page 4

The action of dopamine on post-synaptic receptors constitutes the final stage in transmitting
the dopaminergic neuronal impulse to post-synaptic neurons. As all clinically available
antipsychotics block D2 receptors, over the last two decades many studies have investigated
whether D2 receptor density is altered in schizophrenia compared to control subjects. There
have been at least nineteen published studies, but, after an initial positive finding,
subsequent results have been inconsistent [34]. This is probably due to a number of factors,
particularly the inclusion of antipsychotic treated patients in the initial and some subsequent
studies, the properties of the different radiotracers used and baseline concentrations of
extracellular dopamine [34]. It is also worth noting that, due to lack of pharmacological
specificity of the radiotracers, there is generally some additional contribution from D3
receptor binding in these studies. Three published meta-analyses [34-36] conclude that D2/3
density shows marked heterogeneity in schizophrenia, and, although there may be an
elevation in striatal D2/3 receptor density, perhaps in a subgroup of patients, it is moderate
(10-20%) at most. This elevation appears to be specific to D2/3 receptors - striatal D1
receptor densities are unaltered [34;35;37;38]. Fewer studies have investigated D2/3
receptor density in extrastriatal brain regions in schizophrenia, but current evidence suggests
that the density of D2/D3 receptors may be decreased in areas such as the thalamus and
anterior cingulate cortex [39-42]. Finally, the D2 receptor may exist in two intraconvertible
(high and low) affinity states for agonist binding and it remains to be determined if the
balance between these two states is altered in schizophrenia [43], although preliminary data
suggests that no alteration is apparent in the absence of dopamine depletion [44].

Making sense of the dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia and linking it to
symptoms

It is apparent from the studies reviewed above that the initial hypothesis that abnormalities
in D2 receptor densities underlie schizophrenia has not been convincingly supported by PET
and SPECT studies. Rather, the data show schizophrenia is characterised by elevated
presynaptic dopamine availability and release in the striatum. What is not apparent from
these data is the process by which these molecular abnormalities in striatal dopamine
function translate to the symptoms of schizophrenia that are observed in the clinic.

A model has recently been described [15;45] which seeks to explain the translation of
presynaptic dopaminergic abnormalities to psychotic symptoms. Underlying this hypothesis
is an extensive animal literature which describes a central role of dopamine in learning the
predictive contingencies between the presence of environmental stimuli and rewarding or
aversive events. Specifically, dopamine is thought to mediate the assignment of motivational
salience to internal or external stimuli, thus increasing the propensity for these stimuli to
grab attention and drive behaviour. Normally, motivational salience is applied to stimuli
which are relevant in terms of their contingency with pleasurable or unpleasant outcomes.
The hypothesis proposes that in schizophrenia, where presynaptic dopaminergic function is
elevated, dopamine release may occur in the absence of relevant stimuli. This stimulus-
independent dopamine release would result in assignment of salience to other, normally
irrelevant, stimuli whose presence happens to temporally coincide with dopamine release.
This process is termed aberrant attribution of salience, and may underlie clinical phenomena
such as the propensity for patients to begin to attach special meaning to events that were
previously unremarkable. Eventually, aberrant salience may form the basis of psychotic
symptoms; delusions, for example, develop from the individual’s cognitive effort to make
sense of these experiences, and thus reflect personal and cultural interpretations. This model,
illustrated in figure 1, is consistent with a number of clinical phenomena, such as patient
reports that their psychosis first began with an increasing sense that something unusual was

going on around them. As described below, aberrant salience may also explain some
treatment effects.

The PET and SPECT findings described above, together with new animal and other
evidence, have led to the proposal of a revised ‘version III’ of the dopamine hypothesis of
schizophrenia [46]. This dopamine hypothesis integrates recent findings on risk factors for
schizophrenia with the neurochemical findings and the aberrant salience model discussed
above. It proposes that multiple environmental and genetic ‘hits’ interact to result in
dopaminergic dysfunction - the final common pathway to psychosis and the diagnosis of
schizophrenia.

Insights into mechanisms underlying treatment response and side-effects

Antipsychotic drugs and dopamine D2 receptors

Although all currently licensed antipsychotic drugs block D2 dopamine receptors, they also
act at a number of other neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, including other dopamine
receptor subtypes and those for serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine and acetylcholine.
Given this rich pharmacology, it was initially far from clear which receptor mediated the
clinical response to antipsychotic treatment. Landmark in vitro studies in the 1970s showed
there was a close relationship between the affinity of antipsychotic drugs for D2 receptors
and the clinical potency of the drugs [18;19]. Subsequent ligand imaging studies with both
SPECT (eg: [47-51]) and PET (eg: [52-58]) have demonstrated that all antipsychotic drugs
cross the blood-brain-barrier and block D2/3 striatal receptors in vivo at clinically effective
doses. These data support the in vitro findings, and have provided the foundation for studies
in which the relationship between D2 occupancy and clinical response could be established.

D2 occupancy and clinical response

Interestingly, initial PET and SPECT studies found no relationship between D2 receptor
occupancy and clinical response (see, for example, [59]). However, it has subsequently
transpired that this was the first clue to a curious property of the relationship between
antipsychotic drug occupancy of D2 receptors and clinical response - it appears to be non-
linear. The early studies generally used moderate to high antipsychotic drug doses which
resulted in levels of D2 occupancy greater than 65% [59]. More recent studies including low
doses of antipsychotics indicate that there is little clinical response seen when occupancy is
less than 50%, with clinical response increasing from this point [60]. This suggests that a
therapeutic threshold of D2 occupancy is required for clinical response to antipsychotic
drugs. This hypothesis has specifically been investigated in a double blind study of patients
experiencing their first episode of schizophrenic psychosis [61]. D2 receptor occupancy was
determined with [11C]raclopride PET imaging following two weeks of antipsychotic
treatment and clinical response assessed in the patients. The results confirmed that clinical
efficacy requires a threshold of occupancy of D2 receptors. A threshold D2 occupancy of
65% was found to best separate responders from non-responders: at 65% receptor
occupancy, 80% of responders were above the threshold whilst 67% of the non-responders
lay below the 65% threshold. Receptor occupancy much above 65% was associated with a
far higher risk of side-effects (see below) but little further clinical improvement. This is an
important finding: in the past, if there was little or no initial response the clinical practice
was to keep increasing the antipsychotic dose under the misguided belief that this would
increase the chance of a subsequent response. However, these PET findings indicate that in
general high doses offer no therapeutic advantages and only increase the risk of adverse
events.

Another therapeutic insight provided by PET and SPECT imaging studies is the high level
of individual variation in D2 occupancy which occurs (eg: 38%-87%), despite patients

receiving identical doses of the same antipsychotic compound. This variation may partly
underlie the large differences in individual response to standard doses of antipsychotic and
explain why it can be so difficult to predict the optimal dose of antipsychotic to use.
Furthermore, PET imaging studies have provided evidence that some patients show little or
no response even though antipsychotic D2 occupancy is well above the therapeutic threshold
[62]. Therefore, D2 receptor occupancy above a threshold is necessary for, but not sufficient
to guarantee, antipsychotic treatment response.

As illustrated in figure 2, in the context of the aberrant salience model described earlier,
blockade of D2 receptors by antipsychotic drugs will dampen the propensity of
inappropriate dopamine release to result in aberrantly assigned salience [15;45]. This model
is consistent with the observation that existing delusions become less important to patients
during antipsychotic treatment, but also the observation that antipsychotic therapy may be
associated with dysphoria or a ‘deficit-like state’. The relationship between clinical
response, side-effects and D2 occupancy is discussed below.

The relationship between D2 occupancy and time to response

Most textbooks of psychiatry state that patients take weeks to show any response to
antipsychotic treatment – thus perpetuating the dogma that onset of antipsychotic response is
‘delayed’. However this received wisdom is questioned by PET imaging studies which have
demonstrated that adequate striatal D2 occupancy occurs within hours of starting
antipsychotic treatment [63]. Whilst it is possible that treatment response requires a chain of
secondary events occurring after D2 occupancy, such as depolarisation blockade, that may
take weeks to occur – the findings have caused the clinical data to be examined more
critically. A meta-analysis of nearly 8,000 patients conclusively showed that clinical
improvement does occur within the first two weeks of starting regular antipsychotic
treatment [64]. In fact, the largest improvement in symptoms may occur over the first two
weeks of antipsychotic treatment [71]. Furthermore, high D2 occupancy forty-eight hours
after starting antipsychotic treatment is significantly associated with a greater clinical
response two weeks later [65]. Taken together, these findings suggest that clinical response
sets in rather contemporaneously with D2 occupancy – thus strengthening the causal link
between the two.

Antipsychotic drug dosing regimes and D2 occupancy

Most oral antipsychotic drug regimens require the patient to take the drug once or twice a
day. Antipsychotic dosing schedules are principally designed on the basis of plasma drug
concentrations and usually assume a direct relationship between the levels of the drug in
plasma and brain. Using PET imaging, Tauscher et al (2007) tested this assumption by
giving healthy volunteers a single dose of a commonly used antipsychotic drug (either
risperidone or olanzapine) and measuring both the antipsychotic concentrations in plasma
and levels of antipsychotic D2 receptor occupancy in the striatum [66]. The concentrations
of both drugs declined relatively rapidly in the plasma; the plasma elimination half-life for
olanzapine was about 24 hours, whilst that for risperidone was about 10 hours. This plasma
elimination profile contrasted markedly to the temporal profile of D2 occupancy, which
remained high for much longer; indeed D2 occupancy levels at or greater than the
therapeutic threshold were observed at 48 hours. Tauscher et al (2007) also measured
antipsychotic D2 occupancy and plasma concentrations in patients with schizophrenia who
had received long-term treatment with either olanzapine or risperidone. After the patients
stopped their treatment, similar results were observed - plasma antipsychotic drug levels
dropped much faster than the level of D2 occupancy in the brain. These data indicate that the
plasma and brain kinetics of antipsychotic drugs are not directly related: antipsychotic D2
occupancy in the brain is sustained whilst plasma drug levels decrease much more quickly.

This finding has two potentially important clinical implications. Firstly, these data indicate
that determination of antipsychotic concentrations in plasma may not accurately predict
optimal dosing schedules, nor accurately indicate whether individual D2 occupancy lies
within the therapeutic window. Secondly, these data suggest that it may not be necessary for
patients to take their antipsychotic medications as often as is currently advised, although
clinical trials are required for full evaluation of any change in the recommended treatment
regime.

Sustained versus transient D2 occupancy by antipsychotic drugs

Most treatment algorithms are based on the idea that patients need to take medication
following a dosing schedule that will maintain continuous D2 receptor occupancy. This
assumption has been tested by using PET to measure D2 occupancy in patients receiving
risperidone depot at a time when it was anticipated that drug levels would be at their nadir
(immediately prior to when the next dose of injection of medication was due) [67]. In the
majority of patients at this time-point, D2 occupancy levels were lower than the threshold
for D2 occupancy required for clinical response and, despite this, these individuals did not
relapse. The implication of this study is that transiently high levels of D2 occupancy may be
sufficient to maintain clinical response; indeed a subsequent PET study has also shown that
the orally administered antipsychotic quetiapine produces only transiently high levels of D2
receptor occupancy [68]. Studies comparing the effects of transient versus continuous
antipsychotic delivery in animal models provide further support for this idea [69]. Transient
delivery was found to be more efficacious, both when doses were matched and when a lower
dose was used than that given continuously. Furthermore, whilst continuous treatment
resulted in an increase in D2 receptor density, transient treatment did not. This suggests that
continuous treatment results in compensatory changes, such as D2 up-regulation, that might
counteract therapeutic effects, whilst transient treatment may avoid such changes. Together,
these findings suggest that high levels of D2 occupancy may only be required briefly in
order to achieve and maintain a clinical response, and, furthermore, that a mode of delivery
that results in adequate transient D2 occupancy may avoid counterproductive D2 changes.

These findings indicate that the kinetics of D2 binding are as important as D2 occupancy
levels for antipsychotic treatment response. However, converting the receptor kinetic
findings into treatment recommendations is complex, because any effort at making
occupancy transient makes it more susceptible to the impact of any missed doses – which
could turn transient into absent occupancy. Nonetheless, these occupancy kinetic studies
provide interesting possibilities that merit further investigation.

Mechanisms underlying antipsychotic treatment side-effects

Patients taking antipsychotic drugs can experience a number of distressing side-effects.
These include extra-pyramidal side-effects (EPSE) - which may involve involuntary muscle
movements or muscle spasms (often of the face or neck) and restlessness,
hyperprolactinaemia (which may affect sexual function) and dysphoria (low mood). PET/
SPECT imaging has considerably increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying
these side-effects, so that clinical practice may move towards minimising their occurrence.
A core observation is the close relationship between the occurrence of several major side-
effects and the level of D2 receptor occupancy. An initial PET study demonstrating that
patients with EPSE have higher antipsychotic D2 receptor occupancy (>80%) than patients
without EPSE (<75%) [70] has subsequently been confirmed in double-blind randomised
treatment studies [71]. This relationship is also true for prolactin elevation following
antipsychotic treatment - higher levels of D2 occupancy increase the likelihood of
hyperprolactinaemia [72]. These studies indicate that different side effects may emerge at
different threshold levels of D2 receptor occupancy – for example the D2 occupancy level at

which hyperprolactinaemia is highly likely is lower than that for EPSE. Importantly, the D2
occupancy threshold required for treatment response is lower than that at which both EPSE
and hyperprolactinaemia emerge. For example, Kapur et al (2000) found that the likelihood
of clinical response, hyperprolactinaemia, and EPSE increased significantly as D2
occupancy exceeded 65%, 72%, and 78% respectively. These data show that there is a
‘therapeutic window’ for D2 occupancy, above which side-effects are more likely without
greater efficacy. The clinical take-home message is therefore that antipsychotic drugs should
be used at the lowest effective dose. These PET findings also indicate that many
antipsychotic drug trials comparing established antipsychotic drugs with newer compounds
have used doses of the established drug that are likely to be above its therapeutic window.
This may have increased the risk of side-effects for the established compound, thereby
biasing outcomes in favour of the newer compound.

A significant proportion of patients taking antipsychotic drugs also complain of a number of
subjective side-effects such as dysphoria, generalised unpleasant feelings, low mood or
inability to think (see reviews [73;74]). These negative subjective experiences may emerge
even after only a few days of administration of very low doses of antipsychotic drugs - for
example, 25% of people taking 50mg of chlorpromazine experienced it [75]. In common
with EPSE and hyperprolactinaemia, SPECT studies have found a direct link between the
level of antipsychotic D2 blockade in the striatum and severity of these dysphoric
experiences [76;77]. de Haan et al (2004) reviewed the literature and concluded that there
was a window of D2 occupancy of 60-70% above which adverse subjective side-effects
became significant [78]. More recently, Mizrahi et al (2007) confirmed, in the first double-
blind controlled study, that higher striatal D2 receptor occupancy is associated with
increased negative subjective experiences, even in patients taking newer antipsychotic drugs
which were thought to be less likely to induce these subjective adverse effects [79]. This
study also examined extra-striatal D2 occupancy by the antipsychotic, finding that higher D2
occupancy in temporal cortex and insular regions was also associated with greater levels of
these dysphoric experiences. Furthermore, patients reported dysphoric experiences even at
relatively low levels of D2 occupancy. This indicates that subjective adverse experiences
may be an inevitable consequence of antipsychotic treatment-even with newer drugs.

Treatment refractory schizophrenia: main PET and SPECT findings

About one third of patients with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotic treatment
(see review [80]) and only one drug, clozapine, has proven efficacy against positive and
negative symptoms in these treatment refractory patients [80-82]. Clozapine treatment is
generally reserved for patients in whom other medications have failed as it can have serious
side-effects, including agranulocytosis and seizures, although it has lower rates of EPSE
than most other antipsychotic drugs [82]. Understanding the mechanisms behind clozapine’s
unique efficacy is important for two reasons: to provide leads for the development of
improved antipsychotic drugs that replicate clozapine’s efficacy without reproducing its
side-effects; and to advance the understanding of the neurobiology of treatment refractory
schizophrenia.

Although a number of theories have been proposed to explain clozapine’s atypical efficacy
and side-effect profile, the two main ones are its limbic selectivity, and blockade of 5-HT2A
serotonergic receptors. The limbic selectivity theory suggests that clozapine preferentially
blocks D2 receptors in limbic and cortical dopaminergic systems and thus avoids EPSE
associated with striatal D2 receptor blockade. Whilst some PET and SPECT imaging studies
support this hypothesis [83-85], others do not [86;87]. In addition, as other antipsychotic
drugs may show similar profiles of D2 binding [84;88;89] and it is striatal rather than extra-
striatal occupancy that appears to predict treatment response [90], the limbic selectivity

theory does not completely explain clozapine’s atypicality. Clozapine acts at a wide range of
neurotransmitter receptors, but shows a particularly high affinity at 5-HT2A sites; a feature
which has been suggested to underlie its efficacy. PET imaging studies have shown high
levels of 5-HT2A occupancy during clozapine treatment [91;92], but this is also observed
with other second generation antipsychotic drugs, such as risperidone, olanzapine and
quetiapine [93-97]. In conclusion, PET and SPECT data suggest that neither limbic
selectivity, nor 5-HT2A occupancy can explain the unique efficacy of clozapine in
treatment-resistant schizophrenia, although they may explain its different side-effect profile.
New avenues of research must therefore be explored to determine the features of clozapine
that confer therapeutic advantage. One possibility is that clozapine may be particularly
efficacious in regulating presynaptic dopaminergic function, a hypothesis that may be
explored using PET studies in man. Alternatively, direct or indirect interactions of clozapine
with other neurotransmitter systems, for example the cholinergic or glutamatergic systems,
may be the key to its unique efficacy. These hypotheses may also be explored in the future
using PET/SPECT imaging with select radiotracers.

Conclusions and Future Directions

This review has highlighted key findings from PET and SPECT studies that have
considerably advanced understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and
significantly contributed towards the development of new and improved drug therapies.
Striatal dopaminergic dysfunction is a consistent and widely replicated finding in PET and
SPECT studies of schizophrenic molecular pathology. Whilst the consistency of these
findings suggest that this could lead to a diagnostic test, PET and SPECT scans of
dopaminergic function have not proven sufficiently sensitive to be used as such in the past.
However, new approaches to interrogating PET imaging data using multivariate inputs and
neural network analysis have recently been applied and found to offer high specificity and
sensitivity in identifying people with schizophrenia [98]. These developments, together with
improvements in scanner resolution, offer encouragement that PET and SPECT imaging
may be used diagnostically in the future. It is apparent from this review of the evidence that
changes in presynaptic dopamine availability and stimulated dopamine release are
consistently reported across different schizophrenic patient populations and experimental
settings, whilst alterations in the density of post-synaptic D2/3 receptors are less convincing.
This implicates presynaptic dopamine availability and release as the major dopaminergic
abnormality in schizophrenia. Presynaptic dopamine availability may therefore provide a
practical neurobiological marker for investigation of the dopaminergic basis of symptoms
and treatment response in schizophrenia.

PET and SPECT imaging has made major contributions to defining the role of D2 receptor
occupancy in therapeutic response to antipsychotic drug treatment. These studies have
shown that current antipsychotic drug therapies require D2 occupancy above a threshold
level for clinical efficacy. However, D2 occupancy at or above the threshold is not sufficient
on its own to guarantee response. What has also been realised is that whilst many of the
side-effects of antipsychotic drug treatments relate to D2 occupancy, fortunately, these side
effects generally only become significant at occupancy levels higher than those required to
elicit a therapeutic response. These findings show that there is a ‘therapeutic window’ for
antipsychotic drug doses, within which therapeutic effects are induced but side-effects are
minimised. This provides clinicians with an empirically defined target to aim for in deciding
dosing strategies and indicates that, in general, there is no rationale for the use of high doses
of antipsychotic drugs, because this increases the risk of side-effects with little or no benefit
in efficacy. Another implication of these findings is that many clinical trials of antipsychotic
drugs may have used unnecessarily high doses. This is particularly an issue when high doses
of an older comparator drug - that are likely to be in the supra-threshold range of D2

occupancy - have been compared with doses of a newer compound that are likely to be in
the therapeutic window. Clearly this sort of dosing protocol may give the new trial drug an
outcome advantage, particularly biasing the inferred potential to reducing the risk of side-
effects.

In refining understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and treatment response,
the PET and SPECT imaging studies have highlighted a number of potentially fruitful areas
for future drug development. In particular, these investigations demonstrate that
schizophrenia is characterised by marked increases in presynaptic dopamine availability and
release - which may indeed constitute the primary dopaminergic pathology - but all currently
available antipsychotic drugs act downstream at D2 receptors on post-synaptic terminals.
Significant therapeutic advantage may be gained through development of compounds that
act upstream to rectify presynaptic hyperdopaminergia. This, then, is a potentially important
avenue for future drug discovery. Some compounds currently under evaluation might offer
this potential [99].

The first generation of PET and SPECT studies into schizophrenia have made a significant
contribution to understanding of its pathophysiology and to antipsychotic action. However,
whilst it is clear that dopaminergic mechanisms are core elements of the molecular
pathology of schizophrenia and key determinants of treatment response to current drugs,
other neurotransmitters systems and their interactions with dopaminergic function are also
likely to be crucially important in schizophrenic pathophysiology and treatment
optimisation. It is therefore likely that the next generation of PET/SPECT imaging studies
will utilise new radioligands to probe the functionality of non-dopaminergic
neurotransmitter systems and that such studies will play a prominent role in the further
refinement of our understanding of the neurobiology of schizophrenia and key therapeutic
areas, such as treatment resistance.
