Abstract

Objective: A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with eating disor-

ders (EDs) have experienced deteriorating symptoms,

increased isolation, and an

increase in hospital admissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this,

no systematic reviews have been conducted examining the COVID-19 and ED peer-

reviewed literature. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize the impact

of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with EDs.

Method: Database searches of the peer-reviewed literature were completed in the

subsequent databases: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO (from November

2019 to October 20, 2021). All research reporting on the relationship between the

COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with EDs were included.

Results: Fifty-three studies met the inclusion criteria, including 36,485 individuals

with EDs.

The pooled hospital admissions across the studies demonstrated on average a 48%
(pre = 591, post = 876, n = 10 studies) increase in admissions during the pandemic
compared to previous pre-pandemic timepoints. In this review, 36% of studies (n = 19)

documented increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic, this increase

in eating disorder symptoms were documented in AN, BED, BN, and OFSED patients.
Studies also demonstrated increases in anxiety (n = 9) and depression (n = 8), however

patterns of change appeared to be diagnostic and timing specific (e.g., lockdowns).

Discussion: We found a large increase in the number of hospitalizations and an

increase in ED symptoms, anxiety, depression, and changes to BMI in ED patients dur-

ing the pandemic. However, these changes appeared to be diagnostic and timing spe-

cific. Many qualitative studies described deterioration in ED symptomatology due to

decreased access to care and treatment, changes to routine and loss of structure, nega-

tive influence of the media, and social isolation. Future studies are needed to focus on

pediatric populations, new ED diagnoses, and severity of illness at presentation.

Public Significance: The scientific literature suggests that individuals with eating dis-

orders have experienced deteriorating symptoms, increased isolation, and an increase

in hospital admissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study synthesized

53 articles and explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with eat-

ing disorders. We found increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic;

this increase in eating disorder symptoms was documented in patients with common

eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, bulimia nervosa,

and other specified feeding and eating disorders. This review also demonstrated

changes in body mass index (an index used to classify underweight, overweight, and

obesity in adults) and increases in anxiety and depression during the pandemic com-

pared to previous timepoints; patterns of change appeared to be related to timing of

lockdowns. This review provides important information on the impact of COVID-19

on the physical and mental health of individuals with eating disorders.

Resumen

Objetivo: Un creciente conjunto de evidencia sugiere que las personas con trastornos

de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) han experimentado síntomas de deterioro, mayor

aislamiento y un aumento en los ingresos hospitalarios como resultado de la pan-
demia de COVID‐19. A pesar de esto, no se han realizado revisiones sistemáticas que
examinen la literatura revisada por pares de COVID‐19 y TCA. Por lo tanto, esta revi-
sión sistemática tuvo como objetivo sintetizar el impacto de la pandemia de COVID‐

19 en las personas con TCA.

Método: Las búsquedas en las bases de datos de la literatura revisada por pares se

completaron en las bases de datos posteriores: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE y Psy-

cINFO (de noviembre de 2019 al 20 de octubre de 2021). Se incluyeron todos los
informes de investigación sobre la relación entre la pandemia de COVID‐19 en

individuos con TCA.

Resultados: Cincuenta y tres estudios cumplieron los criterios de inclusión, incluyendo

36,485 individuos con TCA. Los ingresos hospitalarios agrupados en los estudios

demostraron en promedio un aumento del 48% (antes = 591, después = 876, n = 10

estudios) en los ingresos durante la pandemia en comparación con los puntos de

tiempo previos a la pandemia. En esta revisión, el 36% de los estudios (n = 19) docu-

mentaron aumentos en los síntomas del trastorno alimentario durante la pandemia,

este aumento en los síntomas del trastorno de la conducta alimentaria se documentó

en pacientes con AN, TpA, BN y OSFED. Los estudios también demostraron aumentos

en la ansiedad (n = 9) y la depresión (n = 8), sin embargo, los patrones de cambio

parecían ser diagnósticos y específicos del momento (por ejemplo, encierros).

Discusión: Encontramos un gran aumento en el número de hospitalizaciones y un

aumento en los síntomas de TCA, ansiedad, depresión y los cambios en el IMC en

pacientes con TCA durante la pandemia. Sin embargo, estos cambios parecían ser

diagnósticos y específicos del momento. Muchos estudios cualitativos describieron

un deterioro en la sintomatología del trastorno de la conducta alimentaria (TCA)

debido a la disminución del acceso a la atención y el tratamiento, los cambios en la

rutina y la pérdida de estructura,

la influencia negativa de los medios de

comunicación y el aislamiento social. Se necesitan estudios futuros para centrarse en

las poblaciones pediátricas,

los nuevos diagnósticos de TCA y la gravedad de la

enfermedad al momento de la presentación.

cally examine potential moderators that may contribute to heteroge-

neity in findings (e.g., ED diagnosis, country, age). According to our

risk of bias assessment, the quality of studies included in our review

was predominantly poor. The qualitative and mixed methods also had

mixed samples when it comes to age and diagnosis, and many lacked

standardized questionnaires to assess symptoms, rather drawing

qualitative themes from interviews or survey responses. There was

minimal pediatric data available. Thus, more pediatric data would help

expand the COVID-19 ED research and may help researchers and cli-

nicians understand the unique challenges that pediatric individuals

with EDs experienced during the pandemic. Finally, there was also a

lack of diversity in the samples of individual studies included in this
