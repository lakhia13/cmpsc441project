Abstract

Background: Nurses’ burnout might affect their quality of life, productivity and nurs-

ing care services.

Aim: The aim of this systematic review was to systemically review the relationship 

between nurses’ burnout and quality of life and to introduce practical recommenda-

tions to reduce nurses’ BO and improve their QOL.

Methods: 

In  April  2021,  MeSH 

terms 

(("Nurses"[Mesh])  AND 

"Burnout, 

Professional"[Mesh]) AND "Quality of Life"[Majr] were used to search five electronic 

databases: CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection 

and Google Scholar.

Results: The search produced 21 studies exploring nurses’ burnout and their quality 

of  life  within  the  last  ten  years  (2009– 2021).  Most  of  these  studies  found  signifi-

cant relationships between the burnout dimension(s) and quality of life dimension(s) 

among the nurses.

Conclusion:  Nurses  have  moderate  to  high  levels  of  burnout  and  were  negatively 

associated with poor quality of life. Interventional programs are needed to decrease 

nurses’ burnout and improve their quality of life.

have studied nurses working at critical care units, who have more 

stressful  environment  than  other  nurses.  This  systematic  review 

might also be limited by including only those studies in English and 

excluding  qualitative  studies.  Last,  the  different  tools  used  in  the 

included  studies  to  measure  BO  and  QOL  might  be  another  limi-

tation.  Future  systematic  reviews  are  encouraged  to  have  meta- 

analysis  by  including  studies  using  the  same  measures.  However, 

the studies included in this systematic review were peer- reviewed, 

were  done  in  different  countries  and  continents,  and  included 

nurses working in different working areas.

5 |  CO N C LU S I O N

This  systematic  review  aimed  to  assess  the  relationship  between 

nurses’  BO  and  QOL  and  analyse  the  measures  used.  The  review 

results  showed  moderate  to  high  levels  of  BO  across  the  included 

studies, varying levels of QOL and negative relationships between 

BO and QOL. MBI remains the most widely used instrument in as-

sessing nurses’ BO. Both WHOQOL- BREF and SF- 36 are the most 

used tools in measuring nurses’ QOL.
