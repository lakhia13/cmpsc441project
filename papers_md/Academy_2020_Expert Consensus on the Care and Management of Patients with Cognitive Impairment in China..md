Cognition is the process by which the brain receives and
processes external information to actively understand the
world. Cognitive functions involve multiple areas, such as
memory, attention, language, execution, reasoning, calcu-
lation, and orientation. Cognitive impairment refers to a
dysfunction in one or more of these areas and affects the
social function and quality of life of patients to different
extents. Severe cognitive impairment may even lead to
death. Cognitive impairment may be caused by multiple
factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovas-
cular and cerebrovascular diseases, nutritional and meta-
bolic disorders, infections, trauma, tumors, and drug abuse.
Cognitive impairment is divided into two stages based on
severity: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.
MCI is a transitional state when the cognitive function lies
between normal function and dementia. The incidence of

123

Neurosci. Bull. March, 2020, 36(3):307–320

MCI among the elderly population aged C65 years is 10%–
20%, and[50% of patients with MCI progress to dementia
within 5 years [1–4]. The percentage of individuals with
MCI who develop dementia is 10 times greater than
healthy elderly individuals [5]. Therefore, MCI interven-
tions are critical to delay the occurrence and development
of dementia.

Dementia is deﬁned as a group of diseases characterized
by cognitive impairment and accompanied by psychological
and behavioral symptoms, leading to reduced daily living
abilities. Based on the etiology, dementia is categorized into
several types, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular
dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy
bodies, among which AD is the most common, accounting
for 30%–50% of all dementia cases [6]. In 2018, approx-
imately 50 million people worldwide were living with
dementia. Approximately 152 million people are estimated
to be diagnosed with dementia by 2050 [7]. In China, 14%
of the population aged 60 years or older had dementia in
2015, and this value will reach *33% by 2050. The number
of individuals with dementia in China ranked ﬁrst in the
world in 2015, imposing heavy burdens on families and
society [8]. Therefore, dementia care has become an integral
part of treatment. The majority of dementia caregivers
include direct caregivers for individuals with dementia and
their partners, such as spouses, children, home-service
personnel, physicians, nurses, care providers for the elderly,
community service personnel, and social workers. Appro-
priate care and management can delay disease progression in
patients with dementia and improve their quality of life,
leading to an extended life span and alleviating the stress on
caregivers. Developed countries have established relatively
complete dementia care models. The promotion of a
dementia care and management model that is suitable for
China is an important problem that demands a prompt
solution.

Dementia care and management models are of two main
types: home care and residential care. Home care includes
day care centers, part-time nanny care services, full-time
nanny care services, and on-site health care services.
Residential care includes senior citizen homes, dementia
care institutions, assisted living facilities for the elderly,
nursing homes, and dementia units. In China, the majority
of patients with dementia use the home care model, and
caregivers are mainly family members and close relatives
[9]. However, because of changes in the family structure
and an incomplete dementia care system, the establishment
of a consensus cognitive impairment care and management
plan that is suitable for the national conditions in China is
urgently needed.

We have systematically reviewed the literature in
related ﬁelds published in the last 10 years, combined
with the most recent research progress, and formulated the

123

expert consensus described below after a collective dis-
cussion among the members of the expert group (see
supplementary material). This consensus is based on the
current status of dementia care in China and takes
advantage of care and management experiences from other
countries to offer guidance and suggestions for dementia
caregivers in China, including the following: (1) MCI care
and management; (2) cognitive maintenance and training;
(3) daily care; (4) care and management of psychological
behaviors; (5) living environment setting; (6) arrangements
for recreational activities; (7) care and management of
patients with end-stage dementia; and (8) suggestions for
addressing stress in caregivers.

MCI Care and Management

Informing a Patient of an MCI Diagnosis

‘‘have the right

MCI is a common problem among the elderly population.
The outcomes of MCI are stabilization, reversal to normal
functions, or progression to dementia, so some patients
with MCI have a poor prognosis. Informing a patient about
an MCI diagnosis often involves legal and ethical issues.
The key to communication is reasonable informed consent.
Certain techniques and procedures are required when
determining whether to directly inform and how to inform
the patient and family members about
the diagnosis.
Studies conducted in various countries suggest that the
majority of patients would like to know the diagnosis of
MCI, and common reasons include ‘‘can plan for the
future’’,
to know’’ and ‘‘can select
treatment options’’, while the reasons for not wanting to
know include ‘‘will feel sad and depressed’’ and ‘‘knowing
the truth does not help’’ [10]. According to recent research
conducted in China, most patients would like to be
informed about the true status of their diagnosis and would
like family members to know, but they would like to be
notiﬁed in neutral terms, such as ‘‘cognitive impairment’’,
‘‘memory loss’’, ‘‘brain degeneration’’ and ‘‘Alzheimer’s
disease’’ [11]. In general, both options have pros and cons.
the
Currently, after conﬁrmation of an MCI diagnosis,
recommended practice is that physicians should ﬁrst
sufﬁciently communicate with the patient’s family mem-
bers and then, depending on the circumstances, directly
communicate with the patient. The content of the commu-
nication includes assessments of treatable risk factors, the
risk ratio of conversion from MCI to dementia, whether a
biomarker examination is needed to determine the possi-
bility of a progression towards dementia, and possible
interventions. The content of the communication should be
beneﬁcial for follow-up and management and minimize
potential harm to the patient.

Care and Management of Patients with MCI

Maintenance of the Personal Rights of Patients
with MCI

Both clinical physicians and patients hope to begin inter-
ventions early during the MCI stage to delay or prevent the
development and progression of dementia. Therefore, a
comprehensive and detailed memory proﬁle should be
established at a patient’s ﬁrst visit and archived as the
baseline condition; the reversible risk factors that cause
further cognitive impairment are also assessed in detail [12].
Moreover, a cognitive assessment should be performed
every six months. During the assessment, the patient should
be accompanied by a family member, friend, or close
associate. Importantly, the assessment results are only used
as a diagnostic reference, and not as a diagnostic conclusion.
After the assessment, the patient should be informed of the
importance of early diagnosis and interventions, and they
should be notiﬁed that an approved drug for the treatment of
MCI is currently unavailable. Notably, joint interventions,
including the comprehensive management of risk factors,
cognitive training, exercise therapy and family care, social
interactions, and treatment of depression, are beneﬁcial for
preventing or delaying dementia. The follow-up manage-
ment should be voluntary on the part of the patient, and from
the perspective of protecting the patient’s interests, the
patient’s choice of included family members should be
to
completely respected. During follow-up, methods
achieve the continuous management of the patient must be
discussed, with the aim of establishing effective, rigorous,
practical, and smooth communication and to provide the
patient with integral and continuous medical services. Using
the current diagnostic criteria, some misdiagnosis of MCI
occurs [13], and the MCI misdiagnosis rate can be reduced
through regular follow-up visits. Regular health education
sessions are recommended, including methods to identify
cognitive impairment at an early stage, methods to perform
visits and follow-ups, methods to correct unhealthy living
habits and control risk factors, and methods to improve self-
care [14]. A survey of ﬁve cities in China indicated that the
majority of the population has a poor awareness of AD [15]
and a high demand exists for skilled care [16], which can be
learned from the health education of Chinese communities
in other countries [17]. The management of a population
with chronic diseases should be strengthened, and medical
personnel in the community should be regularly trained.
Health care workers in community health service institu-
tions should receive systematic training, including the early
identiﬁcation and timely referral of individuals with a high
risk of cognitive impairment. Patients and caregivers should
also receive regular health education. Therefore, the care
and management of patients with MCI should be based on
the establishment of memory proﬁles, regular follow-up
visits, and health education.

living wills,

For patients with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of MCI, physicians
should inform the patients and their family members of the
uncertainty of the diagnosis and prognosis. Physicians
should suggest that the patients and their family members
discuss long-term plans together, such as the establishment
of
safe driving, ﬁnancial and property
planning, decisions regarding medical and research partic-
ipation, and entrusting speciﬁc individuals to represent
their legal interests (ﬁnancial and medical affairs) [12, 18],
which are beneﬁcial for the maintenance of the personal
rights of patients with MCI. In addition, many countries
have regulations on the regular review or cancellation of
motor vehicle driver licenses of elderly individuals or
patients with dementia. In China, the Regulations of the
Motor Vehicle Driver License Application and Use also
stipulates that individuals with dementia are not allowed to
drive motor vehicles. However, these regulations do not
provide a detailed explanation of MCI. Relevant informa-
tion should be provided to patients with MCI and relatives.

Cognitive Maintenance and Training

The Objective of Cognitive Maintenance
and Training

A patient’s cognitive dysfunction and the severity of the
condition should be assessed. Individualized cognitive
training should be provided based on the assessment
results, possible etiology, and the patient’s circumstances
to help maintain the current cognitive status and restore or
partially restore impaired cognitive function as much as
possible, thereby delaying the clinical progression of the
disease and improving the patient’s quality of life.

Methods for Cognitive Maintenance and Training

Management of Relevant Factors, such as the Etiol-
ogy and Causes

The patient’s diet, exercise level, mentality, social support
and past medical history, and current status should be
comprehensively understood, and the relevant etiology and
causes should be conﬁrmed together with specialists. Based
on the assessment results, the caregivers should implement
a nutritional and drug treatment plan in daily life, observe
the effects and adverse reactions of all drugs, and provide
regular feedback.

Cognitive Function Training

Training should combine individualized and standardized
aspects, including a combination of individual and group
training,
traditional and modern medicine, family and
societal elements, specialized treatment, and daily life
activities, and should include assessments. Five to six
1-hour cognitive training sessions are recommended
weekly, with an individualized duration and intensity that
is focused on the patient’s needs. 1. Assessment of
cognitive functions: Detailed training plans should be
created and executed according to the range and severity of
cognitive impairment,
the patient’s condition, and the
available medical and social resources near the family and
in the surrounding area. Novel and complex cognitive
stimulations are believed to be more effective [19]. 2.
Common training methods: (1) Memory training: This type
of training helps maintain a patient’s long-term memory by
allowing them to look at old photographs and recall past
events and by encouraging the patient to tell their personal
stories. This type of training improves the patient’s logical
reasoning by guiding them to classify and recall pictures,
phrases, or objects. Short-term memory can be improved
by having the patient recall numbers and dates, repeat
phone numbers, and recall
the names of previously
presented objects, such as pens, glasses, and keys. The
patient’s delayed memory ability can be trained by
showing him/her several items encountered in their daily
activities, such as pens, glasses, and keys, and asking the
patient to recall the names of the previously presented
objects 5 min later or by guiding the patient to recall a
piece of information, repeating the information and repeat-
ing the process with extended durations. In addition, other
speciﬁc therapeutic techniques, such as vanishing cues,
errorless learning, and internal versus external memory
strategies, would be useful, but they are limited to the
transfer of memory training to daily functions. (2) Orien-
tation training: We recommend that orientation training is
incorporated into daily life. This can yield two results with
half the effort by choosing memories for training and
strengthening times, locations, and ﬁgures to which the
is emotionally attached and shows interest. (3)
patient
Verbal communication skill training: Methods for commu-
nication and interaction that are acceptable to the patient
are recommended to help maintain their verbal communi-
cation skills. During this process, the patient should be
encouraged and praised. The ability to express oneself can
be trained by prompting the patient to name and describe
picture cards, starting with easy tasks and progressing to
more difﬁcult tasks. Writing skills can be strengthened
through transcription, dictation, writing based on pictures,
and keeping a diary. The corresponding brain functions can
also be activated by reading and singing. (4) Visual space

123

and executive ability training: The patient should undergo
targeted training on the items related to daily living
activities, such as getting dressed, going to the restroom,
bathing, identifying coins, making and receiving phone
calls, and turning the TV on and off. More complicated
items can also be included, such as using the washer and
withdrawing money from the bank. If the patient makes
mistakes during training,
in an
encouraging way and should not be blamed or forced to
make choices or recall things. (5) Calculation training: The
difﬁculty of the training should be incrementally increased
according to disease status. Simple arithmetic calculations
are more beneﬁcial. If a patient is unable to complete all
the above training sessions, they are still beneﬁcial for
producing a comprehensive cognitive improvement by
training a single cognitive area [20]. Better effects can be
achieved

Daily Care

Individualized daily care that is centered on the patient and
takes the maximum advantage of the patient’s remaining
functions is recommended. A patient’s independence can
be promoted and maintained by allowing autonomous
behaviors. Patients should also be encouraged to participate
in meaningful and interesting activities, eat a healthy and
balanced diet, and engage in regular exercise.

Assessments

The daily living activities that can be assessed through
communication with the patient/caregiver and physical
examinations include vision, hearing, oral hygiene, phys-
ical ability, nutrition, function, and family environment.
The assessment of daily living activities includes two
aspects: basic activities of daily living, such as eating,
getting dressed and taking a shower, and instrumental
activities of daily living, such as managing money,
shopping, driving and taking medications. Common scales
for activity assessments include the Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale–Activities of Daily Living, the Instru-
mental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale and the
Disability Assessment for Dementia scale [23]. The Mini
Nutritional Assessment Short-Form is recommended as a
regular assessment of the patient’s nutritional status. If the
patient is at an advanced stage of cognitive impairment and
has an active eating disorder or behavioral symptoms, their
nutritional status can be assessed using the Aversive
Feeding Behaviors Inventory scale, the Edinburgh Feeding
Evaluation in Dementia questionnaire, and the Eating

Y. Han et al.: Expert Consensus on Management of Patients with CI in China

311

Behavior Scale to improve eating and nutrition issues
[12, 24]. Physical ability is typically assessed by measuring
grip strength, pace, and the Short Physical Performance
Battery scale.

Suggestions for Stratiﬁed Care

Mild Dementia

The daily living activities of patients at this stage of the
disease are partially impaired, and require assistance to
improve and maintain their instrumental activities of daily
living, such as managing money, taking public transporta-
tion, performing housework, and using appliances. Care-
givers should not provide excessive care but instead urge
patients to take care of themselves. Patients should have
regular lives; pay attention to their diets, nutrition, and
cleaning; exercise appropriately; and participate in social
activities they enjoy to ensure that they are able to maintain
independent living activities at a high level for as long as
possible.

Moderate Dementia

At this stage, cognitive functions gradually decline and the
patient’s daily living ability decreases. Caregivers must
assist patients with many types of obstacles encountered in
daily life. Patients should perform simple and regular self-
care tasks with the help of caregivers. Caregivers should
cultivate patients’ conﬁdence and security.

Severe Dementia

At this stage, patients generally have lost their ability to
take care of themselves. Caregivers should particularly
focus on oral hygiene, nutritional status, and excretion to
avoid complications such as aspiration pneumonia, pres-
sure sores, and deep vein thrombosis.

Daily Care Measures

Basic Daily Living Activities

(1) Eating: For patients with any stage of cognitive
impairment, caregivers should provide a pleasant dining
environment, reasonable meals, and colorful, aromatic and
tasty dishes according to the patient’s preference. An
attempt to improve cognitive functions with nutritional
supplements is not recommended for patients without a
nutrient deﬁciency [18, 24]. Patients should be encouraged
to take food orally and avoid diet restrictions. If oral food

intake is\50% of the expected amount for[10 days due to
disease progression or irritation, the patient should undergo
tube feeding to provide enteral nutritional supplements
through an indwelling nasogastric tube or gastrostomy. If
contraindications exist or the patient is intolerant of tube
feeding, parenteral nutrition can be administered for a short
period of time [18]. Patients with dysphagia or who are fed
nasally should receive focused care to prevent aspiration
and choking risks. However, invasive treatments aiming to
‘‘keep the patient alive at all costs’’ do not extend the
lifespan or improve the quality of life [25]. (2) Dressing:
The choice of clothing should be simpliﬁed, and patients
should be encouraged to dress and undress themselves.
Assistance should be provided to patients who experience
difﬁculty getting dressed. Patients should be informed, and
their privacy should be protected during this process [26].
(3) Cleaning and grooming: Patients should be encour-
aged and guided to complete cleaning and grooming
processes, such as hair combing, tooth brushing, shaving,
and nail clipping. Patients who are unable to complete oral
care procedures should be assisted in maintaining oral
hygiene. Patients’ teeth and dentures should be examined
regularly. (4) Outdoor activities and exercise: Exercise
should be based on long-term regular aerobic exercise and
resistance training. The form of exercise can be determined
individually according to the past preferences of the patient
[27]. Walking,
tai chi, and
progressive resistance exercises are all appropriate. During
exercise, patients should perform the exercises they are
capable of completing and move carefully to prevent
injuries. When patients with end-stage dementia have
difﬁculties in completing exercises, caregivers should help
the patients move their muscles and joints to prevent
complications such as joint deformation and muscle
(5) Bathing and skin cleansing: Caregivers
atrophy.
should create a comfortable bathing environment and
respect patients’ habits. Patients should take baths regu-
larly. The bathing process should be simpliﬁed, and
scentless,
low or neutral pH, and fat-containing soaps
should be used. The skin should be moisturized with body
lotion to prevent itching caused by dryness. Caregivers
should also pay attention to skin damage. For patients who
refuse to take baths, caregivers should look for reasons,
such as fear of water, fear of being undressed, or the lack of
privacy, and address these fears in an appropriate manner.
(6) Using the bathroom and incontinence: Patients with
mild or moderate cognitive impairment should be encour-
aged to use the bathroom independently. Assistance should
be provided to patients with difﬁculties, such as ensuring
that the patient knows where the bathroom is located and
renovating the bathroom if needed [28].
In cases of
incontinence, caregivers should consider potential causes
and seek treatment. Patients with unknown causes of

jogging, aerobics, dancing,

123

312

Neurosci. Bull. March, 2020, 36(3):307–320

incontinence should use the bathroom regularly and change
their lifestyle to accommodate this condition. Diapers or a
waterproof mattress should be used when necessary.
Bedding should be changed and cleaned regularly.

Instrumental Living Activities

(1) Shopping: Patients should be encouraged to shop with
a shopping list. Caregivers should help patients ﬁnd
shopping locations, and patients should choose the right
products themselves. Caregivers can help the patients with
payment [29]. (2) Driving and taking public transporta-
tion: When patients have basically normal cognitive
functions, they should be accompanied by caregivers when
driving. If a patient has a score[1 on the clinical dementia
rating scale,
they should stop driving [30–32]. When
patients travel by public transportation, caregivers should
accompany them and help them ﬁnd stations and routes. (3)
Cooking: Caregivers should know a patient’s cooking
habits and guide them in preparing cooking materials. The
patient can then complete the cooking steps according to
the recipe. When necessary, caregivers should remind the
patient about appropriate techniques and help ensure a safe
cooking process. (4) Housekeeping: Caregivers should
encourage and assist patients to participate in as many
housework activities as possible, such as washing dishes
and clothes, making the bed, and sweeping. (5) Telephone
use: Caregivers should know the patient’s past ability to
use a phone, remind them to search for phone numbers, and
encourage and guide them to make independent phone
calls. (6) Medication management: Caregivers should
supervise patients in taking medications, observe adverse
reactions, and prevent excessive use or misuse of medica-
tions. If patients refuse to take their medications, caregivers
should identify the causes and seek professional help when
necessary. (7) Financial management: Caregivers should
know their patient’s ﬁnancial management capability and
remind or assist them in paying bills, such as water, power,
gas, and phone bills. Caregivers should assist
legal
guardians in helping patients with ﬁnancial issues.

Care and Management of Psychological Behaviors

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
(BPSD) are deﬁned as abnormalities or disruptions of
perceptions, mood, and thoughts during the development
and progression of cognitive impairment, including hallu-
cinations, illusions, delusions, anxiety, depression, indif-
ference, irritability, impulsive behaviors, and behavioral
disinhibition [33]. BPSD is very stressful for patients but
also imposes a substantial burden on caregivers.

123

BPSD Care Principles

1. Combine professional care and family care. 2. Under-
stand the patient’s characteristics, including personality,
hobbies, remaining abilities, and previous experiences, and
identify patient-centered care approaches. 3. Regularly
assess the effects of care and continuously improve them.
Care for
the behavioral and psychological symptoms
should cover the entire disease course. 4. Non-pharmaco-
logical care interventions are preferred for BPSD care, and
drug treatments should also be combined with non-
medication interventions. The intervention methods should
be administered incrementally and assessed prior to and
after the intervention to ensure that the care methods are
continuously improved. 5. Protect the safety of patients and
keep them away from dangerous items.

BPSD Identiﬁcation and Assessment

A prerequisite for alleviating BPSD is their correct
identiﬁcation and assessment. The predisposing factors,
manifestations, duration, frequency, and intensity of the
symptoms and their effects on the patient and caregiver
should be recorded in detail. Assessment has been per-
formed using instruments such as the Narcissistic Person-
ality Inventory Questionnaire and the Global Deterioration
Scale [34, 35].

BPSD Interventions

(1) Delusion: Delusion is often a source of a patient’s
insecurity. Delusions of being robbed or persecuted are
common symptoms. Caregivers should provide support to
the patient through their speech and behavior, such as
giving the patient the ‘‘banking deposit book’’ or ‘‘stolen
money’’. Delusions can also be addressed through non-
pharmacological methods, such as music, art, and cognitive
therapies [36]. (2) Hallucination: Careful observation and
recording can help caregivers discover the triggers of
hallucinations. Gentle treatment of the patient, providing
distractions and reducing hostility and distrust are all
helpful in alleviating symptoms. Glasses and hearing aids
should be used for patients with visual and hearing
impairments. Dangerous items such as knives, scissors,
and ropes should be stored in safe places. Patients should
be kept away from gas, and the doors and windows should
be closed to prevent accidents. (3) Agitation/aggression:
The causes and precipitating factors for agitation/aggres-
sion should ﬁrst be determined. Methods such as persua-
sion, explanation, or distraction can help calm the patient.
Safety measures should be implemented without restricting
a patient’s movements. The agitation symptoms and
aggressive behavior can be alleviated by providing ample

Y. Han et al.: Expert Consensus on Management of Patients with CI in China

313

opportunities to participate in games, music therapy [37],
touch therapy [38], aromatherapy [39], and daylight
exposure therapy [40].
(4) Depression/dysthymia: The
patient should remain in a safe and quiet environment.
Exposure to a sufﬁcient amount of natural sunshine and
music and verbal communication can effectively prevent
and alleviate depression [41, 42]. Suicide and self-injury
should be prevented in patients with severe depression.
Patients should be treated by specialists in a timely manner.
(5) Anxiety: For patients with mild to moderate symptoms,
touch therapy, and play
group reminiscence therapy,
therapy can provide opportunities
to increase social
interactions, enhance their pleasure, and enrich their daily
life, which subsequently helps to alleviate anxiety [43]. (6)
Elation/euphoria: This symptom is manifested by excessive
happiness, satisfaction,
increased talking, and patient’s
facial expressions of a naı¨ve and uncoordinated impression.
The caregiver should respect the patient and should not
force them to stop but
instead listen patiently, gently
comfort and persuade them to ensure that their elation/
euphoria does not affect
the safety of the patient or
surrounding people. The caregiver can adjust the environ-
ment as needed, shift the patient’s attention, and avoid
irritating language and behavior. The caregiver can also
increase the patient’s activity and arrange for them to listen
to music, watch TV, play chess, read newspapers, or
engage in other activities according to their hobbies and
interests to maintain a good state. (7) Apathy/indifference:
Apathy and indifference are common symptoms experi-
enced by patients with dementia. Caregivers must improve
the patient’s care in daily life [44], including the diet, daily
life, personal hygiene and assistance with performing
moderate physical exercise. (8) Disinhibition: For patients
who are impulsive, speak rudely, swear, or are sexually
hyper-excited, caregivers should prevent violent impulsive
behavior without arguing, correcting, or engaging face-to-
face conﬂict. The caregivers can distract a patient’s
attention and let them perform active exercises to minimize
the symptoms. Patients should be treated in a timely
manner if they have severe disinhibited behavior [45]. (9)
Irritability/emotional instability: The cause, triggers and
characteristics of this behavior must be identiﬁed, and
stimuli that easily trigger emotional ﬂuctuations should be
avoided. A patient’s ﬂuctuating emotions can also be
alleviated or calmed through non-drug treatments, such as
soothing music therapy, physical activities, or sunbathing.
(10) Abnormal activities: Patients with repetitive language
or other abnormal behaviors can be comforted, neglected,
or distracted. For patients with a tendency to leave safe
areas, the incidence of becoming lost can be reduced by
setting up an appropriate environment or arranging numer-
ous daytime activities [46]. (11) Sleeping/night behavior:
Patients with this type of symptom should avoid becoming

too hungry or too full before going to sleep, and their
daytime activities and physical exercise levels should be
increased. Night-time sounds and light stimulation should
be reduced and potentially accompanied by individualized
music therapy [47]. Patients with daytime rhythm disorders
and ‘‘sunset syndromes’’ can receive phototherapy [48, 49].
(12) Appetite and eating disorders: For patients with a
reduced appetite, causes should be actively sought and
treated in a timely manner. In addition, timely interventions
should be provided for patients with eating disorders.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, among which
memantine is highly effective in alleviating hallucinations,
agitation, aggressiveness, and severe stereotypic behaviors

non-drug interventions are ineffective, a combination of
drug treatments and non-drug interventions is recom-
mended [41, 42]. Antipsychotics, antidepressants, and
benzodiazepines may be used for a short period, when
necessary.

Living Environment Setting

Principles in Establishing the Living Environment

Along with decreasing cognitive function, patients often
exhibit a decreased ability to orient and adapt
to the
environment. Patients are more prone to falls and becoming
lost, and an unfamiliar environment and inappropriate
environmental stimulation can increase a patient’s insecu-
rity, which may induce agitation [51]. Therefore, friendly
living environments should be established for patients with
cognitive impairment according to the following princi-
ples: (1) ensure the safety of the environment to prevent
accidental injuries and getting lost or falling, (2) maintain
the stability and familiarity of the environment and avoid
sudden changes, (3) design time and orientation clues to
facilitate time and location orientation, and (4) provide
proper sensory stimuli.

Suggestions for Establishing the Living Environ-
ment Setting

Ensure Environmental Safety

(1) Prevent falls: Furniture should be as simple as possible,
and clutter and sharp corners should be minimized. Non-

123

314

Neurosci. Bull. March, 2020, 36(3):307–320

slip materials should be used for the ﬂoor, and the ﬂoor
should be quickly dried in the event of a spill. Stairs should
not be located in the active area, and small carpets should
be avoided to prevent tripping [52]. Handrails should be
installed next to the toilet and bath, and automatic night-
lights should be installed in the bedroom, hallway, and
bathroom [53]. (2) Prevent getting lost: Locks that the
patient
is unable to open easily should be installed.
Curtains and pictures can be used to hide exits. Modern
electronics such as door and window sensing devices,
remote alarm systems, and electronic positioning devices
should be used [54, 55]. Caregivers should inform neigh-
bors and relevant personnel in the community about the
the patient so they can receive timely
condition of
assistance. Care institutions can use circular or ring-shaped
architectural designs. (3) Manage hazardous items: Toxic,
harmful, sharp, or fragile items, such as medications,
knives, scissors, glass containers, detergents, expired food,
chopsticks, and toothbrushes, should be locked up. Gas and
power safety and alarm devices should be installed. We
recommend that the gas valve is shut off [56] and that
seasonings are stored properly in the kitchen to prevent the
patient from mistakenly eating them. The power sources of
small appliances such as ovens, microwaves, and electric
kettles should be turned off, and the temperature of the
water heater should be decreased. Mirrors should be
removed for patients with end-stage dementia.

Ensure that the Environment is Stable and Familiar

(1) Patients with cognitive impairment should live in an
environment with which they are as familiar as possible
and avoid sudden changes in the residence (such as
intermittently staying at children’s homes, or
moving,
moving to care institutions), layout, and items in the living
space [51]. (2) If the patient must change their residence,
items with which they are familiar or like, such as small
pieces of furniture, photos, pictures, and souvenirs, should
be placed in the living area to help them identify their new
environment [52]. (3) Institutions that treat patients with
cognitive impairment should create small units and home-
like environments, such as letting the patients have their
own rooms and providing a living room, small kitchen, and
dining room resembling a home. Some of the patient’s own
furniture, photos, and items should be included in their
room, and frequent room changes should be avoided
[51, 57].

Design Orientation Clues

(1) Time and direction clues: Large clocks and calendars
should be placed in prominent locations in the active areas,
living room, and dining room.
including the bedroom,

123

Pictures showing the current season and upcoming holidays
should be designed to help patients identify time [58]. (2)
Directional guidance signs: Photos or pictures that
the
patient is able to recognize should be attached to the door
to help them identify their own room. Simply designed
direction signs, such as words or patterns, to guide patients
in locating the bathroom, kitchen, or dining room, should
be used. Daily supplies should be placed in stable and
prominent
locations, and the outsides of cabinets and
drawers should be labelled [59].

Provide Proper Sensory Stimulation

(1) Light stimulation: The active areas should maintain
bright and uniform natural or artiﬁcial light and avoid glare
or dim light. The mirror should be placed in a location that
will not easily produce reﬂections. Strong sunlight should
be blocked with curtains [52, 60]. (2) Color stimulation:
The walls, curtains and sheets should have warm and bright
colors. Brightly colored photos, pictures, decorations,
ﬂowers, and plants should be hung or placed in the living
space. (3) Sound stimulation: Noises and excessive quiet
should be avoided. Appropriate sound stimulation should
be maintained based on the patient’s preference, such as
playing songs, music, plays, and comic dialogues the
patient likes [61]. For patients who are bedridden and
unable to leave their room/residence, the use of recording
or projection technology to allow the patient to listen to
sounds from nature, such as birds or ocean sounds, is
recommended [62]. (4) Tactile stimulation: Items evoking
different
tactile sensations, such as sponges and sand,
should be placed in the living area [52]. Simulation dolls or
pets that
likes should be provided
[63, 64]. (5) Olfactory stimulation: The windows should be
opened regularly for ventilation, to remove odors from the
room and maintain a supply of fresh air. (6) If possible,
care facilities should establish a multi-sensory stimulation
room that uses light, music, aroma, and various objects to
provide multiple sensory stimuli for patients with cognitive
impairment [65].

the elderly patient

Maintain Privacy and Sociality

(1) Privacy: A private environment can provide physical
and psychological safety for the patient. The patient should
be provided with their own space according to past living
habits [66]. Curtains are recommended for care facilities or
2-person or multi-person rooms. (2) Sociality: Spaces
should be set up for group activities such as activity rooms,
living rooms, dining rooms, and reading rooms [67].

Arrangements for Recreational Activities

Principles of Recreational Activity Arrangements

Active participation in recreational activities can provide
patients with cognitive impairment opportunities for self-
expression and social interaction, which is beneﬁcial for
maintaining personal abilities and provides pleasant expe-
riences. The arrangement of recreational activities should
follow the principles described below. (1) Activities should
have a proper level of difﬁculty that matches the patient’s
existing physical function and cognitive ability. Activities
that are too difﬁcult are frustrating and activities that are
too easy may be boring. (2) The activities should combine
a patient’s interests and preferences and make them happy.
Caregivers should note the patient’s reactions during and
after the activity, as well as the completion status, to draw
conclusions and help the patient ﬁnd appropriate activities
in which to participate. (3) The difﬁculty and participation
mode of the activities should be ﬂexibly adjusted. Turning
the activities into tasks and forcing the patients to
participate should be avoided. Patients should be encour-
aged and guided during the activities. (4) The duration of
each activity should not be too long, and the patients
should not be too ‘‘busy’’ [68].

Suggestions for Recreational Activity Arrangements

(1) Physical exercise: Physical exercise helps strengthen
the physique and maintain social functions. Caregivers
should guide patients with cognitive impairment in per-
forming regular activities [69] such as walking, strolling
around a park, hiking, performing tai chi, and other health
exercises. Caregivers can also lead the patients in limb and
ﬁnger activities, such as swinging the upper limbs and
performing ﬁnger exercises [52, 70]. (2) Family activities:
Family members are the most important social support
system for patients with cognitive impairment. Activities
performed with family members are the most familiar and
safest experiences for patients [71]. Therefore, caregivers
should create opportunities for patients and family mem-
bers to dine, chat, take walks, go shopping, and perform
simple household tasks, such as picking and washing
vegetables, cooking, dishwashing, cleaning the desk,
stufﬁng and addressing envelopes, and gardening. For
patients who are housed in care institutions, caregivers
should create more opportunities for family members to
visit [72]. The establishment of a simulated supermarket
that allows patients to buy their preferred daily necessities
with tokens is recommended. (3) Reminiscence activities:
If patients with cognitive impairment still have some
memory function, activities that stimulate their memories

of past events or experiences, such as looking through and
talking about old photos, listening to old songs, watching
old movies, talking about past events, and revisiting old
(4) Sensory and
places, are recommended [42, 73].
cognitive stimulation: Suitable sensory and cognitively
stimulating activities based on the patient’s preferences and
existing abilities are recommended, such as singing,
listening to music, following the beat of music, touching
ﬂowers, smelling the scents of ﬂowers or perfume [74],
receiving a massage or emotional touch [75], and interact-
ing with pets [42]. Patients can perform some manual
activities, such as origami, paper-cutting, ﬂower-arranging,
weaving, beading, jigsaw puzzles, interacting with building
blocks, playing pick-up sticks, writing, drawing, and
coloring. Caregivers can also perform some activities
together with the patients such as simple calculations,
labelling and classifying items, and playing chess and
cards; however, patients should not be forced to perform
difﬁcult calculations [71, 76].

Care and Management of Patients with End-Stage
Dementia

End-stage dementia is deﬁned as the state at which the
dementia has progressed to the most severe stage. Memory
and other cognitive functions are severely impaired.
Patients have no autonomous needs, have lost the ability
to complete daily living activities, and have urinary and
fecal incontinence. Common complications include dys-
phagia, fever, and lung infections [26]. At this stage, the
clinical dementia rating scale score is 3 and patients have a
score of 7 on the Global Deterioration Scale. Patients with
end-stage dementia require complete care from others.
Palliative and soothing care is typically provided to these
patients.

Deciding on Care and Medical Treatment Plans

Soothing therapy and hospice care are usually administered
to patients with end-stage dementia. Both physicians and
guardians must coordinate to determine care and medical
treatment plans. The decision can be made through an open
family interview. The physician informs the patient’s
guardian of the prognosis, options, and medical principles
to be followed and answers any of the guardian’s questions.
The guardian can decide on a care and medical treatment
plan that is suitable for the patient based on the patient’s
will and family customs.

If soothing therapy and hospice care are determined to
be the appropriate management, these treatments can be

123

316

Neurosci. Bull. March, 2020, 36(3):307–320

provided at home or in a retirement home, nursing home,
hospice site, or other institution.

Suggestions for Addressing Stress in Caregivers

Suggestions for End-Stage Care

Under current Chinese law,
if the guardian decides to
actively extend the patient’s life, the patient should be sent
to a medical institution that is able to provide nasal feeding,
gastrostomy, or parenteral nutrition as needed [77]. In the
presence of an infection or organ failure, necessary
treatments and rescue measures should be administered to
extend the patient’s life in an appropriate manner.

The adoption of soothing therapy and hospice care does
not mean that the patient is allowed to die, but instead, this
care is provided under the principles of reducing pain and
maintaining patient dignity [78]. If the guardian decides on
this option, the patient typically receives care through one
of the following methods:

(1)

Eating difﬁculty: The patient should be fed small
amounts of food multiple times per day.

(2) Respiratory tract infection: The physician’s advice
should be followed. Caregivers should let the patient
inhale oxygen, turn him/her over, pat his/her back,
aspirate sputum, and administer
the appropriate
medication.

(3) Urinary tract

infection: The urethra, vulva, and
perineum must be cleaned regularly. The patient
should be replenished with a sufﬁcient amount of

water. The patient’s bladder
necessary.
Pressure sores: The patient’s position must be shifted
regularly and the patient should be assisted with
some mild activities on the bed. The patient’s clothes
are changed regularly and the skin is kept clean and
dry to prevent pressure sores. If conditions allow, the
patient can use an air bed.
Pain: Analgesic medication should be provided
according to the doctor’s advice.

(4)

(5)

(6) Oral care: The patient’s mouth should be kept clean

and moist.

(7) Other: It should be determined whether the patient is
comfortable and peaceful. The patient’s dignity
should be maintained. The patient should be contin-
uously assessed and the care measures updated when
needed. Touch, music, and other means should be
used to pacify the patient.

Deﬁnition and Classiﬁcation of the Stress Experi-
enced by Caregivers of Patients with Cognitive
Impairment

Caregiver stress, also known as caregiver burden, refers to
various adverse effects on the emotions, economics, health,
and mentality of caregivers while caring for patients [79].
The main burdens on caregivers of patients with dementia
include psychological (including social psychology), phys-
ical, and economic burdens, among which the psycholog-
ical burden is the most important. Caregiver stress affects
the caregiver’s physical and mental health. Fifty-nine
percent of home-based caregivers of patients with dementia
have very high levels of psychological stress and 40% have
depression; only 5%–17% of caregivers of patients with
other disorders experience depression [80]. The ratio of
caregivers with depression increases as dementia pro-
gresses [81]. For many caregivers, the care provided often
affects their own health. Caregivers are more susceptible to
other diseases or complications when caring for patients
with dementia [82]. For example, caregivers have a higher
risk of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [83, 84].

The Manifestation of Stress in Caregivers of Patients
with Cognitive Impairment

instability,

Although ﬁnancial burdens are included in the stress
experienced by the caregivers of patients with cognitive
impairment, the most prominent manifestations are phys-
ical and psychological stress. Detailed manifestations
include an attitude of denial, anxiety, irritability, frustra-
insomnia, social difﬁculties,
tion, emotional
distraction, exhaustion, and fatigue. For example, care-
givers may deny the dementia diagnosis of their family
member. They are anxious about the future. They are angry
with the patient, themselves and others. Their beliefs are
shaken after a series of setbacks. They often wake in the
middle of the night or have nightmares. They are lonely but
are not willing to interact with friends. They have difﬁculty
in focusing their attention and cannot complete compli-
cated tasks. These stresses gradually cause mental and
physical damage,
loss or gain, and
leading to weight
caregivers often suffer from chronic diseases.

Factors Affecting the Stress Experienced by Care-
givers of Patients with Cognitive Impairment

Factors affecting the stress experienced by caregivers of
patients with dementia are complicated and related to the
characteristics of the caregiver, the disease status of the

Y. Han et al.: Expert Consensus on Management of Patients with CI in China

317

patient, and the care environment (family status). These
factors mainly include the closeness of the relationship
between caregiver and patient, the gender of the caregiver,
how they cope with stress, ethnic, and cultural differences,
the patient’s dementia symptoms and BPSD, and encour-
agement and support from other family members.

Addressing Caregiver Stress

Stress Assessment

According to the Basic Activities of Daily Living ques-
tionnaire and the IADL questionnaire, the time spent each
day providing care for a patient with dementia is an
important metric when studying the indirect ﬁnancial
burden of dementia [85]. The Zarit Burden Interview
(ZBI) scale is used to assess the stress of caregivers [69].
The short form or ﬁltered version of this scale has also been
used to assess caregiver stress. In addition, caregiver stress
has been assessed using the Cardio Stress Index, the Screen
the
for Caregiver Burden,
Positive Aspects of Caregiving scale and the Coping with
Stress Scale.

the Simpliﬁed ZBI scale,

Methods of Addressing Caregiver Stress

The burden of the caregivers of patients with dementia can
be alleviated by providing effective and targeted interven-
tions and follow-up, which then conserve comprehensive
health resources (by delaying the time for which patients
visit a professional care institution) to achieve the eventual
goal of alleviating the ﬁnancial burden and pressure of
dementia on society. The main methods for alleviating
caregiver stress are described below. (I) Adjusting psy-
chological and social stress: (1) Caregivers’ mental stress,
and physical and psychological status should be assessed
regularly by specialists. Medical personnel can become
involved in caring for the patient with dementia and
provide professional guidance, proactive health education
and psychosocial support
to alleviate the care burden
[86, 87]. (2) Caregivers should adjust their attitude and
understanding and learn to effectively cope with stress.
Caregivers should block out some time for themselves and
perform activities that make them happy and fulﬁlled. (3)
Trust should be established between the caregiver, patient,
friends, and family members. The caregivers should not
blame themselves when the patient experiences a difﬁculty,
and they should understand that difﬁculties arise with
disease progression. The caregivers should also establish a
communication mechanism to ensure that they can seek
help in a timely manner when they are unable to cope with
team of
the psychological pressure. (4) A professional

nurses, physiotherapists, and doctors should provide online
counselling services and support for the caregivers, while
caregivers can communicate with each other on a website.
(5) A complete social support system should be established
to reduce the burden on caregivers. Through social
gatherings or regular family meetings, caregivers can share
and discuss the difﬁculties they face and their experiences.
They can also seek help from social support agencies to
allow them some time to relax and take a break. (6) A
psychological education plan should be developed, and
cognitive behavioral therapy should be used to encourage
caregivers to learn psychological relaxation techniques,
which are beneﬁcial to both the patients and caregivers
[88, 89]. (II) Addressing physical stress: (1) The caregivers
should be encouraged to pay attention to and maintain their
own health. (2) Physicians should anticipate potential
problems during patient care and interview the caregivers
during patient visits to assess the caregiver’s health status
and potential problems. Physicians can then provide
appropriate medical suggestions based on the caregiver’s
health status. (3) Attendance at some pleasant
leisure
the caregiver’s
recreational activities is beneﬁcial
physical and mental health. Caregivers should also choose
nutritious and preferred food. (4) Caregiver knowledge of
dementia should be improved, and they should be provided
care plans and coping techniques, such as training in proper
patient
(5) The use of new
technologies can improve patient function and reduce
dependence on caregivers. For example,
the use of
equipment to assist caregivers with moving patients who
are unable to move can reduce the physical burden on
caregivers. (6) Regular day and holiday care should be
arranged. Caregivers require vacations, rest, and recreation
time to ensure that they are physically and mentally rested.
(III) Addressing ﬁnancial burdens: (1) The ﬁnancial burden
and relevant factors related to the care of patients with
dementia should be assessed to provide a reference for the
development of proper medical care plans, new health care
policies, social resource support plans, and medical insur-
ance plans [90, 91]. (2) According to previous studies, anti-
dementia medication can reduce medical costs, which then
reduces the caregiver’s ﬁnancial burden [92]. (3) Improv-
ing the care abilities and ﬁnancial status of caregivers
might also alleviate their ﬁnancial burden.

transportation methods.

for

In the process of caring for patients with dementia,
medical staff should establish a communication mechanism
with caregivers and family members to jointly evaluate and
address various problems. Non-drug interventions should
be implemented as the main measure, and the principle of
individualization should be emphasized. In addition, while
focusing on patients, medical professionals should also
monitor the pressure and response of caregivers.
