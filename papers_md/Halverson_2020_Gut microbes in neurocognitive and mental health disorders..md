ABSTRACT
Introduction: As individuals age, the prevalence of neurocognitive and mental health disorders
increases. Current biomedical treatments do not completely address the management of these
conditions. Despite new pharmacological therapy the challenges of managing these diseases
remain.There is increasing evidence that the Gut Microbiome (GM) and microbial dysbiosis con-
tribute to some of the more prevalent mental health and neurocognitive disorders, such as
depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BP), and dementia as well as the behavioural and psychological
symptoms of dementia (BPSD) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.
Methodology: Scoping review about the effect of gut microbiota on neurocognitive and mental
health disorders.
Results: This scoping review found there is an evolving evidence of the involvement of the gut
microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and mental health disorders. This manu-
script also discusses how the psychotropics used to treat these conditions may have an anti-
microbial effect on GM, and the potential for new strategies of management with probiotics
and faecal transplantation.
Conclusions: This understanding can open up the need for a gut related approach in these dis-
orders as well as unlock the door for the role of gut related microbiota management.

Introduction

Psychiatric and neurocognitive mental health disorders
contribute to the increase in all-cause morbidity bur-
den, as measured by disability-adjusted life years
[1]. Mental health illnesses can range from
(DALY)
psychotic conditions,
like schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder, to mood disorders, encompassing depression
and anxiety. In the general population, schizophrenia
affects 20 million people worldwide with a prevalence
of 0.3–0.7%, while bipolar disorder has a prevalence of
1.8% affecting up to 45 million people [2,3]. Major
depressive disorder (MDD) has a prevalence of around
7% affecting an estimated 264 million people and
approximately 284 million people suffer from an anx-
iety disorder that have varying prevalence with obses-
sive compulsive disorder (OCD) at 1.1–1.8% and post-

traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 0.5–1.0% [2,3]. With
respect to neurocognitive disorders, an estimated 45
million people are afflicted with Alzheimer’s or other
forms of dementia. The prevalence of dementia rises
steeply with age from 5 to 10% (60–69 years) to 25%
after age eighty [2,3]. As individuals age, there is an
increase prevalence of these mental health conditions
from 14.8% (55–59 years)
to 28.9% (80–84 years).
Depression was the most common disorder at 17.1%,
followed by panic/anxiety (11.3%), and cognitive
impairment (5.6%) in older adults [4,5]. Current medi-
cations do not fully address the complex challenges of
managing the cognitive decline and mental
illness
and can also increase the safety risks. Recent evidence
points out that the gut microbiota (GM) can affect the
brain and play a role in these disorders [6,7].

The GM can be considered a virtual organ and
weigh up to 1.5 kilograms [8]. Microbial density is low
in the acidic pH of the stomach, but increases from
the duodenum to ileum and colon [9]. The GM is the
largest population of microorganisms in the gastro-
intestinal (GI) tract of humans which includes bacteria,
viruses, fungi, archaea (microorganism that are similar
to bacteria in structure but have different molecular
organisation), and protozoa [10]. Common GM species
and
to
belonging
Actinobacteria,
and
Bifidobacterium, may be contributing to mental health
disorders [11].
In the last decade, there is a greater
emphasis of bowel microbial genes in these conditions
[12]. The combined genetic material of all these GM
organisms outnumbers human genes by a ratio of
more than 100:1 [12,13]. The GM is a dynamic environ-
ment that is greatly influenced by factors like lifestyle,
age, body composition, diet, and use of antibiotics
[14–17]. In particular, diet appears to cause the great-
est
in the GM; both the Western and
Mediterranean diets are able to alter the predominant
genus present within GM [18–21].
older

adult population, malnutrition,
decreased gut motility, and polypharmacy can lead to
a microbiome shift which can include increasing
and decreasing
Enterobacterium and Bacteroides
Bifidobacterium via a cause and effect
relationship
[22,23]. Alterations to the GM are often referred to as
gut dysbiosis/microbial dysbiosis leading to an imbal-
ance in microbial populations. This imbalance can also
affect the by-products produced by these microbes,
such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and even neuro-
transmitters, which can have an impact on the brain
through the microbiota-gut-brain axis [24]. The object-

between GM and mental health and neurocognitive

Material and methods-search criteria

A literature search was performed using the electronic
databases MEDLINE (1966–March 2020), EMBASE and
SCOPUS (1965–March 2020), PSYCHINFO (1967–March
2020) and DARE (1966–December 2020). The main
search items were gut bacteria, gut microbiota, intes-
tinal flora, mental health, dementia, behavioural prob-
lems
secondary to dementia (BPSD), depression,
anxiety/anxiety disorder/stress, obsessive compulsive
disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-

traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), probiotics and anti-
microbial activity of psychotropic drugs. Non-English

Microbiota-gut-brain axis
The Microbiota-gut-brain axis
an interaction
between the GM and the human host through differ-
ent mechanisms. This axis is able to influence the
brain and have a profound impact on mood and
behaviour [6]. While the mechanisms are evolving, this
axis consists of a two-way communication between
the brain and GM using immune and inflammatory
pathways, neurotransmitters, microbial by-products,
neuroendocrine and enteroendocrine signalling,
the
response, and the vagus nerve [6,25–28]
stress
(Figure 1).

Inflammation and immune processes. Under normal
physiological and homeostatic conditions there exists
a healthy resting inflammatory state where the GM
stimulate the release of cytokines and chemokines
which allows for the regulation of the bacterial popu-
lations in the gut [7]. The bacteria colonised in the gut
need to be controlled to prevent spread throughout
the host. Primarily,
layer of our gut
the epithelial
secretes a mucus layer creating a luminal-mucosal
interface; the majority of the host-microbiota interac-
tions occur here [29]. This interaction is dependent on
the innate immune response. Enterocytes within the
gut have innate immune receptors and release chemo-
immune
kines and cytokines and can influence local
cells [29]. The host immune system can also monitor
the GM, through Toll-like receptors (TLR), as many of
the GI bacteria express a polysaccharide coating, thus
identifying potential pathogens if exposed [30].

have shown that bacteria in the gut can cause a

increased cytokine and chemokine production, which
can reach the brain through blood, lymphatic system,
vagus nerve, and through an increase in blood brain
barrier (BBB) permeability [27,32]. It is when the BBB is
deficient that the cytokines can act on areas of the
brain including the hypothalamus and circumventricu-
lar organs;
Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6 can also acti-

Figure 1. The Brain-Gut-Microbiome Axis. Depiction of the bidirectional (two-way) communication between the brain and gut
through the vagus nerve (A) and the immune system. Communication is achieved through various mechanisms including micro-
bial by-products, such as SCFA, LPS and peptidoglycans (B), release of neurotransmitters (GABA, Norepinephrine, Serotonin,
Acetylcholine, and others) and endocrine messengers via the enteroendocrine cells (C) as well as chemokine and cytokine release
that can lead to neuroinflammation (D). Stress can influence the microbiota causing dysbiosis leading to an alteration of the

found to have control on the integrity of the BBB and
a diverse GM is important for the maintenance and
maturation of microglia [34,35].

Neurotransmitters. Bacteria within the GM have been
shown to produce different neurotransmitters. Some of
the major neurotransmitters include Gamma-aminobuty-
ric acid (GABA) (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium), nor-
epinephrine (Escherichia, Bacillus, and Saccharomyces
spp), dopamine (Bacillus), acetylcholine (Lactobacillus),
and serotonin (Escherichia, Enterococcus, Candida, and
[25,32,36]. Also various gut bacteria
Streptococcus)
(Clostridium, Burkholderia, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas,
and Bacillus) are involved in the metabolism of trypto-
phan, a precursor for serotonin [37–39]. As well as, there
is suggestion of different sets of tryptophan metabolis-
ing bacterial pathways between healthy individuals and
those with neurological diseases [38]. Serotonin is the
key neurotransmitter involved in various psychiatric dis-
orders, such as anxiety and depression.

Microbial by-products. Bacteria found within the GM
are able to secrete various bioactive chemicals

including bacteriocins, bile acids, choline, and short-
chain fatty acids [7]. Bacteriocins are antimicrobial
agents designed to inhibit the growth of other bac-
teria, while bile acids aid in the absorption of lipids as
well as influence the regulation of the bacterial popu-
lation in the small intestine [40–42]. The production of
short chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as butyrate, propi-
onate, and acetate, are derived from the fermentation
of polysaccharides by inducing the synthesis of neuro-
active compounds like neurotransmitters [43,44]. They
have been found to play a role in neurological and
psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression
[45] and Alzheimer’s dementia [46].

Neuroendocrine and enteroendocrine signalling. The
GM can also communicate with the central nervous
system (CNS) through gut endocrine cells [47]. The
use of chemo sensing is established via an interaction
between gut endocrine cells and vagal afferents [48].
Within the gut there are sensory cells, known as enter-
oendocrine cells
(EEC). The EEC can co-ordinate
changes in the gut-nutrient luminal content through
metabolic and behavioural adaptations [49]. When the

Proposed mechanism of action

Lead to low levels of SCFA and contribute to

low-level inflammation.

The process of pentose phosphate, starch, and
sucrose metabolism, via microbial functions,
play a role in pathways for depression
development.

Decreased Bacteroidetes have been associated
with low-grade inflammation. Alistipes is
associated with inflammation and tryptophan
availability. Oscillibacter produces valeric
which resembles GABA.

Proteobacteria can increase gut permeability

allowing for gram-negative bacteria to enter
systemic circulation. Decreased Firmicutes
can lead to decreased SCFA production and
intestinal barrier dysfunction.

There were sex differences in gut microbiota

compositions in patients with major
depressive disorder compared to
healthy controls.

Bacteroidetes may be associated with intestinal
inflammation and an indicator of depression-
related intestinal inflammation.
Bifidobacterium is considered beneficial for
the human body and is found in probiotics
and helps with SCFA production. Oscillibacter
produces valeric acid that resembles GABA
and can bind to GABA receptors.

Both Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus have an
overall beneficial effect in reducing stress
and depressive disorders.

Decreased SCFA producing bacteria can lead to

increased gut permeability.

Increased Fusobacterium and Escherichia
-Shigella bacteria can lead to systemic
inflammation. Ruminococcus gnavus can
degrade mucins leading to gut permeability.

Circulating levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 are

increased in stressed mice and correlated to
changes to three bacterial genera (i.e.,
Coprococcus, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Dorea).
Actinobacteria and Coriobacteriia are involved in

lipid metabolism with correlation to
cholesterol levels. This may correlate to the
somatic comorbidities, such as obesity, found
in bipolar patients.

These bacteria may induce oxidative stress and

inflammation in the host.

Faecalibacterium has been shown to have anti-

inflammatory properties.

Bcteroidetes may be associated with intestinal

inflammation and an indicator of depression-
related intestinal inflammation.

Klebsiella LPS may cause gram-negative induced
inflammatory dysregulation, playing a role in
MDD pathophysiology.

Lachnospiraceae genera are important for SCFA
production and lead to gut permeability
allowing opportunistic pathogens, such as
Protobacteria to translocate. Faecalibacterium
is involved in the direction of gut-naïve CD4
cell differentiation and with
underrepresentation can increase gut TH17
cells which can cross the blood-brain barrier
and induce abnormal behaviour.

Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae have
been linked with the maintenance of
gut health.

Decrease in Firmicutes, such as Blautia,

Coprococcus, and Roseburia lead to decreased
SCFA production.

Reduced levels of the Akkermansia muciniphila,
part of the Verrucomicrobia phyla can lead
to a decrease in anti-inflammatory properties.
It is also found that there is a decrease in
CD4þ T cells leading to a dysregulation of
the immune system and HPA axis.

Increased levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and

TNF-a suggesting alteration in the
inflammatory and HPA axis response. As well,
treatment with prebiotics containing L.
belveticus and B. longum reduced symptoms
suggesting the role of microbial dysbiosis.
Increased gram-negative bacteria along with
increased gut permeability can lead to
translocation of LPS into systemic circulation
and contribute to AD pathology through
inflammation.

Changes in neuro-inflammation leading to a
deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain.

Brain tissue from AD patients showed LPS and
E. coli colocalized with amyloid plaque.
Suggest microbiota dysbiosis may trigger
amyloid pathogenesis along with systemic
inflammation impairing the blood-brain

EEC are exposed to luminal carbohydrates, triglycer-
ides, and proteins, they will express their intracellular
contents which will influence GI functions [49,50]. The
EEC can detect signals from the microbiota through
TLR or receptors for microbiota metabolites and play a
major role in the detection of luminal bacterial con-
tent and products that can regulate GI motility, secre-
tion, and food intake [51]. The GM can influence the
EEC to release neuropeptides and hormones, such as
ghrelin, gastrin, orexin, galanin, cholecystokinin, leptin,
and neuropeptide Y which can influence peripheral
neural communication and act centrally to influence
behaviour
intestinal
[7,50]. There is evidence that
microbes can generate subliminal interoceptive inputs

that influence memory formation, emotional arousal,
and affective behaviours by acting on the human
insula, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex,
and amygdala [52,53].

Stress response. The role of stress is considerably
important on the gut microbiota through the process
of microbial dysbiosis and is involved with various
mental health disorders [54–56]. The effect the gut
microbiota has on the stress response, through the
HPA axis,
interest in various stress-
related disorders. When an actual or perceived threat
is experienced by an individual, this stress activates
the HPA axis leading to the release of hormones that

There is a marked decrease in microbial richness in patients with GAD,

especially reduced SCFA producing bacteria. Compared to HCs, Firmicutes
spp. were decreased (p < .05) while Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes were
increased (p < .05) in GAD patients. At the genus level, Bacteriodetes,
Ruminococcus gnavus, and Fusobacterium were decreased (p < .05) in GAD
patients while Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium rectale, Sutterella (p < .02),
Lachnispira and Butyricicoccus (p < .05) were increased in HC.

Patients with GAD were found to have increased abundance of Bacteroidaceae,
Enterobacteriaceae, and Burkholderiaceae (p < .05). The HCs showed higher
abundance of Prevotellaceae (p < .01), Muribaculaceae (p < .05),
Succinivibronaceae (p < .01), Mollicutes_PF39_norank (p < .001). A negative
correlation was found between the abundance of
Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and
Prevotella_9 and anxiety severity. A positive correlation was found between
anxiety severity and Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella abundance.
Individuals with an intestinal infection in Round 1 had an OR 1.34 (95% CI

1.10–1.64, p ¼ < .01) of developing anxiety in future rounds.

Microbial diversity estimates were similar between PTSD and TE individuals.

Random forest analysis showed PTSD was linked to decreased
Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia abundance (p ¼ .035).

Patients with MDD were found to have lower alpha diversity in the microbiome

compared to HC. Using the Wilcox test, the study showed significant
decrease of Firmicutes phylum (p < .001) in MDD subjects.

The plasma levels of LPS (p ¼ .014), zonulin (p < .001) and FABP2 (p < .032)
showed significant elevation in DEP/ANX compared to HC using ANOVA.
(FABP2 and zonulin are biomarkers of gut epithelium tight junction barrier
integrity). This suggests that there is increased gut permeability in DEP/ANX.

In DEP the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae (U ¼ 355, p ¼ .007) was
decreased, while Thermoanaerobacteriaceae (U ¼ 52.5, p ¼ .021) was
increased (at the Family level) compared to HC. When examining bacteria at
the genus level, there was an increase relative abundance of Eggerthella
(U ¼ 21.0, p ¼ .009), Holdemania (U ¼ 146.5, p ¼ .023), Gelria (U ¼ 52.5,
p ¼ .021), Turicibacter (U ¼ 89, p ¼ 0.034), Paraprevotella (U ¼ 119, p ¼ .041),
and Anaerofilum (U ¼ 50.5, p ¼ .021) while Prevotella (U ¼ 324.5, p ¼ .022)
and Dialister (U ¼ 153.5, p ¼ .032) were decreased when comparing DEP
to HCs.

Patients with MDD were found to have lower abundance of the phylum

Bacteroidetes (p < .01) and higher Firmicutes (p < .01) compared to HC using
the student T test. At the genus level, MDD patients had higher Prevotella
(p < .01), Klebsiella (p < .01), Streptococcus (p < .01), and Clostridium X1
(p < .01) compared to HC using the Wilcoxon Sign Rank test.

It was found that Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were more abundant (p < .05)
while Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were less abundant (p < .05) in MDD
patients compared to HC using Mann- Whitney test.

There was significant microbiota difference between the MDD and HC

populations (p < .001) using ANCOM. The phylum Actinobacteria and
Firmicutes were overrepresented in MDD patients. At the genus level,
Bifidobacterium and Blautia were high in MDD while HC showed higher
levels of Prevotella.

In female patients, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in those with MDD
was increased compared to HC using beta diversity measures. For the male
individuals, there was a decrease of Bacteroidetes in those with MDD
compared to HC. The results suggested there were differences in the
dominant phenotype between male and female patients with MDD.
Patients with MDD had lower Bifidobacterium (p ¼ .012) and Lactobacillus

(p ¼ .067) counts compared to HCs. Individuals whose bacterial counts were
below the cut-off points of 9.53 and 6.49log 10 cells/g for Bifidobacterium
and Lactobacillus, respectively were more common in MDD patients
(Bifidobacterium: OR 3.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38–7.54, p ¼ .010;
Lactobacillus: OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.14–5.78, p ¼ .027).

Patient with A-MDD showed increased Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and
Proteobacteria (p < .05) and decreased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria
(p < .05) compared to HCs. Individuals with R-MDD had increased
Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (p < .05) and decreased Firmicutes,
Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria (p < .05) compared to HCs. A negative
correlation between the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and MDD
symptoms was found (p < .05) using alpha diversity and beta
diversity measures.

Bacterial Difference and Significance
Increased Actinobacteria and decreased Bacteroidetes (p < .01) in patients with
MDD compared to HC using phylogenetic beta diversity analysis. Faecal
microbiota transplant of MDD samples into GF mice caused depression-like
behaviours in 2 weeks post transplant.

Patients with depression showed an underrepresentation of the Bacteroidetes
phylum with decreased order Bacteroidales (p ¼ .05). The genus Oscillibacter
(p ¼ 0.03) and Alistipes (p ¼ .007) were increased and showed a significant
association with depression using PLS-DA.

Study found that patients with MCI and AD show microbial dysbiosis compared
to health controls. In particular, AD patients showed increased Escherichia
(b ¼ 1.27 [95% CI, 0.64–1.90], p < .001), Blautia (b ¼ 12.82 [95%CI,
5.11–20.53], p ¼ .001), Bifidobacterium (b ¼ 4.61 [95%CI, 1.67–7.74], p ¼ .002),
Streptococcus (b ¼ 3.28 [95%CI, 1.17–5.39, p ¼ .002), Lactobacillus (b ¼ 3.41
[95%CI, 0.49–6.34], p ¼ .022), and Dorea genus (b ¼ 9.75 [95%CI, 0.48–19.01],
p ¼ .039) using multivariate regression analysis.

When compared to HCs, there was an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes
(p < .05) and decreased abundance of Actinobacteria (p < .05) in AD
patients. At the genus level, AD patients showed an increased abundance of
Subdoligranulum (p < .01) and decreased Bacteroides (P < .01) and
Lachnoclostridium (p < .001) compared to HCs. Analysis was done using
alpha and beta diversity measures.

AD participants showed decreased abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria,
and increased abundance of Bacteroidetes compared to HC participants
(p < .05). Analysis was done using alpha and beta diversity metrics.
Patients with MCI had more enterotype I microbes and fewer enterotype III

microbes (p ¼ .009) compared to HC suggesting a prevalence of Bacteroides.
In addition, multivariate analysis showed enterotype III microbes were
significantly associated with MCI (OR 0.19, 95% CI, 0.05–0.65, p ¼ .008)

Chinese patients with Schizophrenia were found to have increased harmful

Proteobacteria and decreased Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae genera
(which are important for SCFA production). Schizophrenia patients also had
higher Chaetomium and lower Trichoderma levels compared to HC. Analysis
was done with LDA scores as well as using alpha and beta
diversity measures.

There were alterations of the gut microbiota in SCZ patients with less diverse

population based on Shannon and Choa indices. In SCZ there were 54 OTUs
decreased compared to HCs, with the dominant bacterial families identified
as Lachnospiraceae (16 OTU) and Ruminococcaceae (12 OTU) using alpha
diversity analysis as well as PLS-DA.

In SCZ patients there is an increased abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum.

At the genus level using the Welch’s t-test the relative abundance of
Succinivibrio, Megasphaera, Collinsella, Clostridium, Klebsiella and
Methanobrevibacter was significantly higher whereas the abundance of
Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia was decreased compared toHC (p < .05). The
study also showed that 12 biomarkers were capable of distinguishing
Schizophrenia subjects from controls using the receiver operating
characteristic curve analysis (AUC ¼ 0.837).

The genera Anaerococcus (H ¼ 8.32, p ¼ .07) was increased while Haemophilus
(H ¼ (cid:3)11.3, p ¼ .004), Sutterella (H ¼ 8.32, p ¼ .004), Clostridium (H ¼ (cid:3)15.9,
p ¼ .002) were decreased in patients with SCZ compared to HC by using
Kruskal-Wallis test.

Patient with SCZ had lower numbers of faecal Bifidobacterium spp (t ¼ (cid:3)3.717,
p < .001)., E. coli (t ¼ -4.634, p < .001), and Lactobacillus spp. (t ¼ -7.639,
p < .001) and higher copy numbers of Clostridium coccoides (t ¼ 6.254,
p < .001) using Student T–test.

After 24-weeks of risperidone treatment, the was an increase the faecal copy
numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (F(3160) ¼ 7.298, p < .001) and E. coli
(F(3160) ¼ 8.280, p < .001) in the patient group. The copy numbers of faecal C.
coccoides (F(3160) ¼ 6.364, p < .001) and Lactobacillus (F(3160) ¼ 8.369, p < .001)
significantly decreased using ANOVA test.

In individuals experiencing their first episode of psychosis with increased levels

of the Lactobacillus correlated significantly with symptom severity and
function (p ¼ .004).

The genus Flavonifractor was found more in BPD patients compared to both
healthy FDR and HC (OR of 2.9 (95%CI: 1.6–5.2, p ¼ 5.8 (cid:4) 10(cid:3)4, Q ¼ 0.036)

Bacterial Difference and Significance

Patients with a history of BPD were shown to have a decreased fractional
representation of Faecalibacterium (p < .001) compared to HC using OTU
level analysis.

Both MDD and BPD showed increased levels of the phyla Firmicutes (p < .01)
and Actinobacteria (p < .01) while Bacteriodetes were decreased (p < .01)
compared to HC using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The Proteobacteria
(p ¼ .010) showed significant changes only between the BPD and HC groups.
On a genus level Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Oscillibacter and
Streptococcus were increased (p < .01) in BPD and MDD patients. Only BPD
patients showed increased abundance with Escherichia and Klebsiella
(p < .01) compared to HC.

Did not find any significant difference in abundance of Lactobacillus or

Bifidobacterium between BP patients and HC. A negative correlation between
Lactobacillus and sleep scores on the HAM-D (q ¼ (cid:3).45, p ¼ .01). A negative
correlation between serum cortisol levels and Bifidobacterium (q ¼ (cid:3).39,
p ¼ .02) was also found. Limitation of the study is mild Bipolar disorder
subjects and the specific species of bacteria related to the disorder was
not studied.

BP patients had more abundance of the Phylum Actinobacteria (LDA ¼ 4.82,
p ¼ .007) and Class Coriobacteria (LDA ¼ 4.75, p ¼ .010) while HCs had
higher abundance of Family Ruminococcaceae (LDA ¼ 4.59, p ¼ .018) and
Genus Faecalibacterium (LDA ¼ 4.09, p ¼ .039).

response. With prolonged activation, there is increased
neuroinflammation seen in a variety of mental health
conditions, such as anxiety and depression [57,58], bipo-
lar disorder
[60],
Alzheimer’s dementia [61,62], and schizophrenia [63]. An
animal study showed under prolonged stressful situation,
there was a difference in the gut microbiota compared
to non-stressed controls [64]. When germ-free mice were
exposed to stressors, they had an increased activation of
their HPA axis; however this was normalised when the
mice were colonised with a microbial community [65].

Direct neural signalling through the vagus nerve.
The vagus nerve, which is comprised of 80% afferent
and 20% efferent fibres, is the primary component of
the parasympathetic nervous system [66]. The vagus
nerve is able to interact with the GM and transfer
this information to the central nervous system, lead-
ing to direct activation of the neurons of the brain
[67,68]. Certain bacteria are able to communicate
with the brain and alter the host’s behaviour using
the vagus nerve. It was found that when mice were

Leaky gut. There is a good association between micro-
bial dysbiosis and pro-inflammatory states [72]. Stress
can lead to an increase in the permeability of the intes-
tinal barrier causing a “leaky gut” [54,73]. This loss of
integrity can cause the migration of bacteria and bacter-
ial products through the mucosal membrane [73,74].
This bacterial translocation can lead to autointoxication
that contributes to the chronic inflammatory state that is
found in many mental health conditions
such as
Alzheimer’s and Schizophrenia [75,76].

Results

Interactions of the gut microbiome in
neurocognitive and mental health conditions

Dementia
Dementia is a condition that affects different domains of
cognition and the ability to perform everyday activities.
In the brain, pathological proteins like amyloid and tau
protein are seen, causing neuroinflammation [61]. The
gut microbiome can affect the brain health [6] and gut
dysbiosis can lead to the progression of Alzheimer’s
dementia (AD)
in animal studies [77]. Human studies
have shown decreased Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium
along with increased Bacteroidetes in the stool of AD
patients [78], which can increase the risk of dementia
[79]. When examining the brain tissue from patients
with AD,
there was a colocalization of LPS and
Escherichia coli with amyloid plaques suggesting the role
of gut dysbiosis in amyloid pathogenesis [80]. One of
the proposed mechanism is that gut-permeability allows
for translocation of the LPS from gram-negative bacteria
leading to neuro inflammation [78] (Table 1). There is
limited evidence from human studies about the associ-
ation of gut bacteria with dementia (Table 2).

Patients with mild cognitive impairment

(MCI)
showed a higher prevalence of Bacteroides along with
white matter hyperintensity and higher voxel-based
specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (VSRAD) scores, suggesting cortical and hippo-
campal atrophy [81]. Around 10–15% of patients with
a history of MCI develop dementia annually [82].
Knowing the details of gut-brain interactions can
increase our knowledge on how the gut bacteria play
a role in the dementia pathology and cognitive
decline [83].

Dementia is linked with changes in gut microbiome
composition and systemic inflammation and can affect
the neuro inflammatory system, which may lead to
the deposition of amyloid b in the brain [77,84–86]
(Table 1). In later stages of the disease there will be
decreased microglial function and defective amyloid
clearance leading to amyloid deposition in the brain.
Gut microbiome produce short-chain fatty acids which
can affect the microglial function [35]. The gene-envir-
onment gut microbiome interaction may also be asso-
ciated with a particular disease state, which may serve
as a new target for disease therapies [35]. Probiotics
can help modulate the brain-gut axis by influencing
the gut microbiome, inflammation and cognitive dys-
function [87]. Further investigation is needed to assess
whether the GM could be a target for the manage-
ment of dementia.

Behavioural and psychological symptoms of demen-
tia (BPSD)
Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia
(BPSD) are disturbed perceptions,
thought content
and behaviours seen in cognitive disorders. BPSD
includes psychotic, maniac, affective and impulse con-
trol behaviours. BPSD is seen in 50–90% of patients
with dementia at some point during the course of the
disease [88]. BPSD can result in disruption of eating
and feeding behaviours. Diet and nutritional interven-
tions, by influencing the gut brain axis, may also have
a significant effect on the management of BPSD [89].
The gut microbiota plays a role in brain function
including perceptions [90].

When it comes to treatment, there is a lack of safe
and effective means to manage patients with BPSD.
Often antipsychotics are used; however, they have
been shown to have antimicrobial properties (Table 3).

Current research into the role of the GM on BPSD is
limited with no known human studies. Current
research is looking at the role of probiotics in the
treatment of dementia, and this may also help with
the treatment of the BPSD.

Depression
Depression is a common condition associated with
mood, sleep, appetite and dysregulation of emotion.
Animal studies in rats show changes in mood were
associated with gut microbiome alterations [91]. There
is increasing evidence of
the association between
changes in the GM and depression [92–95] (Table 1).
Several cross-sectional studies in human subjects have
shown the relationship of microbial dysbiosis with
major depression when compared to healthy controls
(Table 2).
increased abundance of the
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes with
decreased levels of Firmicutes have been found in
subjects with major depressive disorder
(Table 1)
[54,96,97]. A recent systematic review showed the
studies of gut microbiota in depression are still an
evolving area of research [98].

In particular,

Based on the evidence, the microbiota-gut-brain
axis may play a role in depression [99,100]. Patients
with depression have altered GM compared to healthy
controls. Studies have shown that antidepressants,
such as fluoxetine and sertraline, have antimicrobial
effects that may also contribute to the gut dysbiosis

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric
illness that
intrusive
thoughts and ritualistic behaviours that are designed
to relieve the associated distress. The neurotransmit-
ters involved in OCD include serotonin, dopamine,
and glutamine. In animal studies, certain gut bacteria
can communicate with the brain by influencing the
levels of various neurotransmitters, altering the HPA-
axis, as well as by stimulating cytokine production
[26,104,105]. Overall, the literature examining the influ-
ence of the gut microbiome and OCD is in its infancy.
One study had shown that mice injected with
RU24969 (a 5-HTia/ib receptor agonist known to
induce OCD-like behaviour) and pre-treated with the
probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus, had a significant
reduction in OCD-like behaviour [106]. A second study
involving healthy volunteers found that

Currently more research is needed to examine the
change of the GM in OCD patients. There is evidence
suggesting that cytokines may play a role in the
pathogenesis of OCD [108] (Table 2). Since the GM
can influence inflammation and cytokine production,
studies into the manipulation of the GM in OCD may
be warranted.

Anxiety
Anxiety, like other mental health conditions, can alter
GI function including colonic motility; this in turn can
cause a change in the normal gut microbiota of the
host [109–112]. Mouse models suggest that infections
causing a disruption of the gut microbiota may predis-
pose the host to anxiety and behavioural changes
(Table 1). Rodents exposed to a subclinical dose of
Campylobacter jejuni, exhibited anxiety-like behaviours
[113]. A human study that involved six two-year panel
data sets consisting of five consecutive rounds looked
at the link between intestinal infection and the future
development of an anxiety disorder.
Individuals that
had an intestinal infection in Round 1 had an associ-
ated odds ratio of 1.34 (95% CI 1.10- 1.64, p < 0.01) for
having an anxiety disorder in the future Rounds [114].

It was also found that patients with generalised anx-
iety disorder had altered microbial populations with
decreased SCFA producing bacteria [115] (Table 2).

Animal studies looking at the composition of the
GM found that mice under chronic stress showed a
reduction in the Bacteroides genus and an increase in
the Clostridium genus [64] (Table 1). Different micro-
biota profiles were seen in an animal study with vari-
ous strains of mice, with BALB/c mice having a more
anxiety-associated microbiome compared to the more
resilient Swiss Webster strain [116]. By introducing the
gut microbiota from one mouse strain to the other, it
can partially transfer behavioural phenotypes, such
that BALB/c mice receiving a faecal transplant from
NIH Swiss mice showed less anxious behaviours [116].
Changes in gut microbiota can also have an influence
on various gut metabolites such as phenylalanine,
tyrosine, and tryptophan, which are important for the
neurotransmitter serotonin metabolism and gut-brain
axis signalling [117–120]. These evidence points out
that the GM plays an important role in anxiety disor-
ders. A systematic review of studies using probiotics
showed a reduction in anxiety symptoms [121], sug-
gesting the alteration of the gut microbiota may serve
as a means of treatment.

Bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder (BP) is a recurrent and chronic mental
health condition where patients experience intense
mood and energy changes. BP has got a spectrum of
two disorders, depressive and manic/hypomanic, and
patients can experience either of them at any time.
The GM may be involved in the disease process of BP
and the chronic inflammation seen within this condi-
tion [122] (Table 1). Human subjects with BP showed
decreased fraction representation of Faecalibacterium
[123] populations
[55] and increased Flavonifractor

Faecalibacterium were associated with more depressive

sympatomatology. Future research is needed in target-
ing the GM for the management of this disease.

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder where patients will
experience symptoms of psychosis including delusions,
hallucinations and often disorganized speech. Patients
may also present with diminished emotional expres-
sion, avolition, and decline in occupational and social
research studies with schizo-

Schizophrenia subjects can lead to an increase in gut
TH17 cells [132]. These cells has been proposed to
activate the microglia in the hippocampus by crossing
the blood-brain barrier leading to abnormal behaviour
[132] (Table 1). A study by Zheng et al. found that
both nontreated and treated patients with schizophre-
nia had altered gut microbiota, along with the finding
that certain bacterial phyla such as Veillonellaceae and
Lachnospiraceae were related to disease severity [130].
Patients presenting with first episode of psychosis,
were found to have an alteration in Lactobacillaceae,
compared to the healthy controls [133]. This study
also found that
individuals with the most altered
microbiota population showed the lowest rates of dis-
ease remission at a one-year follow-up. It is interesting
to note that there is an increase in Lactobacillaceae as
lactic acid producing bacteria are often found in pro-
biotics and associated with anti-inflammatory and
health promotion effects [134].

Human studies found patients treated with either
risperidone or olanzapine had altered levels of
Lachnospiraceae, Akkermansia, and Sutterella com-
pared to controls [135]. A systematic review high-
lighted the limited evidence about the efficacy of
probiotics in schizophrenia [136]. More research will
be needed to better understand about GM manipula-
tion in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Post-traumatic stress disorder is defined as a stress
and trauma related disorder with symptoms that caus-
ing severe anxiety, negative alterations in cognition
and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity
that can have major impacts on an individual’s func-
tion and quality of life [2].

Research specifically looking at the influence of the
gut microbiota in PTSD is limited. In a human study,
individuals who scored higher in the PTSD Clinician
Administered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Scale
(CAPS) had decreased levels of Actinobacteria,
Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia [137]. Decreased
exposure to the above mentioned bacteria leads to
increased vulnerability for PTSD due to the decreased
anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects these
microbes possess [137]. Overall, the research is still in
its infancy for any major conclusions to be made.

Antimicrobial activity of psychotrophic drugs

There is emerging evidence that many of the medica-
tions used to treat psychiatric conditions can have an
influence on the gut microbiota (Table 3). Both in vivo
and in vitro studies showed psychotropic medications
can have an influence on the GM through antimicro-
bial activity [138]. Medications such as benzodiaze-
pines,
and
antipsychotics can have antimicrobial effects [139,140]
that extend to bacteria, fungi, and protozoan (Table
3). Lithium and antidepressants also have various anti-
microbial and immune-stimulating properties, which
tend to focus on prostaglandin inhibition [141].

Antidepressants
Changes in the GM in elderly patients were strongly
associated with the intake of antidepressants [142]. A
study found that the administration of antidepressants
was significantly correlated to the microbiome com-
position [10]. Various studies have examined the dif-
ferent types of antidepressants and their influence on
the gut microbiota (Table 3). Elderly patients on anti-
depressant treatment were found to have increased

with antibiotics can have a synergistic effect [143,145].

such as MAOI

antidepressants,

A study by Lukic et al. found that mice chronically
treated with antidepressants had a reduced richness
of gut bacteria, in particular Ruminococcus, compared
to controls [148]. When mice are treated with duloxe-
tine and a supplementation of R. flavefaciens the anti-
depressant induced reduction is diminished in com-
bination with decreased depressive-like behaviour
[148]. Another study has found that mice treated with
fluoxetine had an inhibited growth of Succinivibrio and
Prevotella [129]. When treated with escitalopram, ven-
lafaxine, or fluoxetine, there was increased permeabil-
ity in the ileum of the animal models [129]. Fluoxetine
had a stronger antimicrobial activity in comparison to
escitalopram [144].

Anxiolytic agents
The anxiolytic agent, propranolol, has shown to inhibit
growth of E. coli [149] and possible S. aureus growth
inhibition [150,151]. However, the data is limited in
examining the effects of other antianxiety medications
(Table 3).

Mood stabilisers
There are limited investigations of the influence of
mood stabilisers on the gut microbiome (Table 3).
Examination of lithium and valproate, found they both
induce a change in the caecal microbiome in rats
[129]. Lithium was found to cause an increase in vari-

Antipsychotics have also been shown to inhibit bacter-

authors of this study felt that the shift in the micro-
biota was due to the metabolic changes caused by ris-
peridone. Metabolic changes are often seen in a
variety of atypical antipsychotics. A study by Morgan
et al. found that germ free mice treated with olanza-
pine did not show weight gain compared to their nor-
mal counterparts. However, this returned when the
mice were colonized; suggesting the GM may play a
role in the side effects of olanzapine [155]. Conversely,
when mice are treated with olanzapine along with a
probiotic, the olanzapine weight gain is attenuated
[156]. During this study, the dose used to achieve this
antimicrobial activity was above the recommended 5-
20 mg/day, questioning if the clinically relevant doses
still poses this same antimicrobial activity.

Even older antipsychotic agents like phenothiazines
and thioxanthenes have antibacterial activity [157].

Additive effects with other medications

The synergistic effect of certain psychotropic medica-
tions, such as antidepressants with other medications
has been studied (Table 3). Certain SSRIs in combin-
ation with antibiotics have increased antimicrobial
effects against even some antibiotic-resistant bacteria
[143,144]. Sertraline can also increase the effectiveness
of antibiotics in inhibiting the bacterial growth [145].

Possible antimicrobial mechanisms of
psychotrophics

Sertraline is thought to inhibit bacterial growth by
inhibiting the efflux pumps in bacterial cells and by
interfering the slime layer biosynthesis. [143,145]. The
antidepressants fluoxetine and escitalopram may also
inhibit efflux pump activity in bacteria, resulting in cell
dysfunction [144]. Other antidepressants,
such as
MAOI inhibitors (MAOIs) are thought to cause cell wall
inhibition while tricyclic antidepressants
synthesis
(TCAs) are proposed to have anti-plasmid activity
[146,147]. Studies showed that psychotrophics may
have anti-microbial effects through different mecha-
nisms. Phenothiazine antipsychotics can alter bacterial
morphology (causing filamentation of E. coli) or inhib-
iting the adherence to epithelial cells [153].

Dose response

The antimicrobial effect seen in the various psycho-
tropics may have a dose response related to their
activity. When looking at the antidepressant fluoxet-
ine, it is able to inhibit growth of Lactobacillus rham-
nosus 6118 at 400 and 600 mg/mL while dose of 100,
400, and 600 mg/mL were able to inhibit the growth
of E. coli APC105 [129]. Escitalopram, at a concentra-
tion of 600 mg/mLcan inhibit growth of E. coli APC105
[144]. The antipsychotic olanzapine was able to inhibit
growth of E. coli NC101 at supraphysiological concen-
trations of 537 mg/mL and above [155]. Aripiprazole
can cause GM changes in rats after a 4 week course at
20 mg/kg/day [129]. Human trials are lacking; however,
the current evidence shows that higher doses of psy-
chotrophics may have detrimental effects on the gut
bacteria. There is still the question if the clinically rele-
vant doses with these psychotrophics will have the
same antimicrobial activity.

Based on the evolving evidence in human studies,
there is a possibility that some psychotropic medica-
tions used to treat mental health conditions can have
an influence on the gut microbiota by antimicrobial
action, but caution is needed when applying the
results from in vitro and animal studies.

Repopulation of the gut microbiome as a new
therapeutic target for mental health and
neurocognitive conditions

Probiotics
Probiotics are microorganisms introduced into the
human body to obtain a health benefit. Most common
and
probiotic

organisms

are

Bifidobacterium [158]. There is increasing research to
study the effects of probiotic supplementation in the
treatment of mental health and cognitive disorders. A
meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials examin-
ing patients with both MCI and AD found significant
improvements (p ¼ 0.002) in cognition [159]. As well, a
meta-analysis found patients with mood disorders
receiving probiotic treatment had significantly lower
depression scores (SMD ¼ (cid:3)0.47, 95% CI: (cid:3)0.67 to
(cid:3)0.27, p¼0.27) without any significant change in anx-
iety scores [160]. The use of probiotics has limited
benefit in patients with psychotic disorders, such as
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A systematic
review highlighted that schizophrenia patients had
alleviation of bowel discomfort with probiotic adminis-
tration, with varying results on the reduction of psy-
chiatric symptoms [161]. In comparison, patients with
bipolar disorder treated with probiotics were found to
have decreased rehospitalisation rates and improved
cognitive function [161]. Further research is needed

role of probiotics

Faecal microbiota transplantation
is another
Faecal Microbiota transplantation (FMT)
means to repopulate the gastrointestinal tract with
beneficial bacteria. This type of treatment has been
widely accepted for the treatment of Clostridium diffi-
cile infections. Typically, this treatment involves the
transfer of faecal microbes from a healthy individual
to a recipient. Preclinical studies have found that anx-
iety and depressive-like symptoms, along with behav-
ioural changes in mice are seen when they had faecal
transplants from psychiatric ill patients [116]. Other
studies have shown that mice receiving faecal trans-
plants from schizophrenia patients start exhibiting
schizophrenia-like behavioural changes [130,131]. The
use of FMT alleviated Alzheimer’s pathology in the
brain of mice and helps to improve cognitive deficits
and reduce amyloid-b [162]. A systematic review high-
lighted that patients receiving faecal transplant from
healthy donors were found to have a decrease in
depressive and anxiety-like symptoms [163].

Both the use of probiotics and FMT showed some
promise in the treatment of mental health and neuro-
cognitive disorders. However, there are various limita-
tions to this field of research. Not all studies showed
effective therapeutic response. Often the studies use
different types of probiotics, dosages, and treatment
methods, and what constitutes as a “healthy micro-
biome” has not been fully defined. Further research is

needed to support the efficacy of these treatments
and better understand the underlying mechanisms.

Conclusions

There is evolving evidence that the GM can influence
the brain cells in addition to intestinal cells, support-
ing that gut microbial composition contributes to
brain health. The connection between the GM and the
central nervous system, with implications for mental
health, including cognition, has been discussed. Bowel
microbes can produce neurotransmitters found in the
human brain, thus having an influence on the brain
neurochemistry, and also on brain disorders including
cognitive, mood and behavioural ones.
In summary,
these observations
in animal and human studies
showed the evidence for an association between gut
dysbiosis through the microbiota-gut brain axis with
different mental health and neurocognitive disorders.
Moreover, psychotropics used to treat these mental
disorders can affect the GM due to their antimicrobial
effects. The novel strategies of microbiota interven-
tions, such as probiotic use and faecal transplant, may
have a role in the clinical management of mental
health disorders. More research is needed in all these
areas before
in clin-
ical practice.
