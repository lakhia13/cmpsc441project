Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around: Couple and
Family Coping During the Coronavirus Pandemic

PETER FRAENKEL*
WONYOUNG L. CHO†

The worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) has had profound effects on all aspects of life:
physical health, the ability to travel locally or to more distant destinations, material and
financial resources, and psychosocial wellbeing. Couples, families, and communities and
individual persons in those relationships have struggled to cope with emerging depression,
anxiety, and trauma, and the rise of relational conflict. In this article, we suggest that the
existential nature of the pandemic’s challenges requires more than just the usual psychoso-
cial interventions. We propose a taxonomy of responses to foster coping and resilience
—“Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around.” “Reaching Up” includes accessing spiritual, reli-
gious, and ethical values. “Reaching Down” includes ideas and practices that foster a
revised relationship with the Earth and its resources, and that engage families to partici-
pate in activities that aid the Earth’s recovery from decades of human-caused damage.
“Reaching In” represents a turn towards experiences available in the mind and in shared
minds in relationships that provide pleasure, excitement, joy, and peace, given that exter-
nal sources of these emotions are of limited availability due to quarantine. “Reaching
Around” involves reframing the mandate for “social distancing” as fostering social connec-
tion and support while maintaining physical distancing. The challenges for family thera-
pists, whose practices are confined largely to online therapy, and who are struggling with
the same fears and constraints as those persons they are attempting to help, are also dis-
cussed.

The worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has presented extreme and unfamil-

iar challenges to couples, families, and communities, and the individuals living within
these social groupings. Much as the attacks on 9/11 shattered Americans’ and others’
sense of safety and forced adoption of a “New Normal” (Fraenkel, 2001a, 2002), the pan-
demic has prompted the entire world to revise this definition of “new normal” once again,
this time centered on beliefs about the preservation of health and confidence that illnesses
will more often than not be met with successful treatment. Challenges include illness,
death, and the fears thereof; unemployment and economic losses; the growing evidence of

health care disparities among persons of differing social locations in terms of race, ethnic-
ity, age, ability/disability and preexisting health or illness, gender identity, socioeconomic
status, profession and rank, and citizenship status; fears of losing housing, access to food
and other basic needs; lack of consistent information about the level of risk of infection or
guidance about best practices to reduce that risk; the need to quarantine with partners
and family members despite conflicts that are usually mitigated somewhat by daily dis-
tance through going to work and school, and on the other hand, interminable separations
between family members, friends, neighbors, and community; a sense of foreboding, isola-
tion, and lack of social support; and disruption of life plans and rituals such as birthdays,
weddings, religious holidays, recreational activities, and funerals. It has also presented
new and unusual challenges to family therapists dedicated to serving these couples, fami-
lies, and communities, including the need to adapt care efforts to teletherapy; how to
address not only psychological and relational problems but also the above-mentioned con-
crete needs and larger systems forces that create or accentuate psycho-relational difficul-
ties; and how to address therapists’ own personal challenges due to the same issues facing
clients while maintaining a therapeutic, caretaking role.

We suggest that the crisis cannot be met simply with traditional psychotherapeutic
interventions, but rather, requires all persons to step back from conflict and draw upon
philosophic, ethical, spiritual, and religious values (Up); become better grounded in our
relationship to the Earth and to core needs for existence as opposed to strivings for mate-
rial goods and the quest for new experiences (Down); turn towards internal means of pro-
moting and engaging in pleasurable experiences (In); and use technologies to foster social
support and connection with others while following requirements to maintain physical dis-
tancing (Around). This taxonomy—Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around—as categories for
particular activities is of course based on common socially-constructed metaphors of loca-
tion in “psychological geography” and is therefore somewhat arbitrary from an empirical
perspective. For instance, describing spiritual and religious values as “higher” (and there-
fore, located Up or Above) is likely based on the trans-religious notion of God and Heaven
as existing “above” the Earth, or perhaps based on a rank ordering from top to bottom,
with such values being ranked highest. Yet these values and their associated behaviors
could be viewed as the basis or foundation of successful human existence and, therefore,
situated below all other endeavors (and so, located Down). Likewise, concern for the state
of the Earth includes not only its surface, its oceans, and the animals and plants that inha-
bit it, but the sky above (Up), or could be conceptualized as all Around us. Nevertheless,
we believe this taxonomy has a kind of cultural “face validity” and we chose to employ it to
organize our reflections on coping and resilience-building practices.

Although we hope that our taxonomy represents a novel and useful way to think about
families meeting contemporary challenges, we build upon important related developments
in the field. In terms of the coping approaches that constitute what we mean by “Up,” over
the past two decades, family therapy has begun to address the need to incorporate fully
the spiritual dimension of families’ lives, both in general (Walsh, 2009) and as a major
active ingredient in family resilience (Walsh, 2016). Indeed, Walsh (2016) argues that the
original systemic framework of “biopsychosocial” now must be recast as “bio-psycho-social-
spiritual.” Some family and couple therapists outside the pastoral counseling profession
and the field of counseling conducted explicitly within particular religious communities
(for instance, premarital counseling in the Jewish faith, Christian counselors) have also
turned to moral, spiritual, and religious principles to guide the conduct and goals of ther-
apy (Doherty, 1995, 2009; Fishbane, 1998) or have emphasized the importance of address-
ing particular religious ideas and practices central to a family’s cultural traditions (Beach,
Hurt, Fincham, Franklin, McNair, & Stanley, 2011; Boyd-Franklin & Walker Lockwood,
2009; Elliot, 2009; Falicov, 2009; Fincham, 2014; Marks & Dollahite, 2017).

In terms of the attitudes and activities clustered under “Down,” although the systemic-
ecological perspective in principle has always included the physical ecology and environ-
ment, only more recently has the field addressed in depth the link between family health
and the health of the planet (Laszloffy & Twist, 2019). The pandemic has raised concerns
about the safety of our environment beyond the coronavirus, and families are often unsure
how to cope with these fears.

In terms of the activities we categorize as “In,” Doherty (1999, 2000) has long described
how couples and families are pulled apart by over-engagement in the quest for new experi-
ences, especially extracurricular activities deemed by middle-to-upper-class parents to be
essential to their children’s development (and to building their CVs for college applica-
tions). The pandemic has all but eliminated access to these outside activities, leaving chil-
dren, teens, and families at loose ends and often unable to generate sources of pleasure
and endeavor among themselves to fill the time, other than increasing the already high
levels of TV and internet activity (Statista, 2013).

In terms of what we designate as activities that constitute the category of “Around,”
research has long established the importance for families of social support and involve-
ment in community (Miller, 2001), especially when children or adults suffer from health
issues (Varda & Talmi, 2018). Given that families either are dealing with an ill member,
or are worried about infection from the virus, connection with other families, neighbors,
and community members is essential to coping with the stress of the pandemic.

Impact on Health and Disparities of Illness Rates

EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC

Described initially to be “the Great Equalizer” (Mein, 2020)—with ample coverage of
privileged, high-profile white persons like Prime Minister Boris Johnson and newscaster
Chris Cuomo—further studies have found that persons of color, especially African-de-
scended and Latinx persons, have significantly higher rates of infection and mortality
than Whites. National data from 40 states plus the District of Columbia found death rates
for Black Americans “2.4 as high as the rate for Whites and 2.2 times as high for Asians
and Latinos” (APM Lab Staff, 2020). Put another way, the death rates per 100,000 people
found Blacks suffered 61.6 deaths, and Native American groups 36.0, whereas Latinx,
Asians, and Whites have suffered lower rates—28.2, 26.3, and 26.2 deaths, respectively
(APM Lab Staff, 2020).1 As Mein (2020) succinctly summarizes, these unsurprising ethnic
and racial differences have emerged during all pandemics over the past hundred years,
due to a cluster of factors. Racial and ethnic minorities are proportionally more likely to be
below the poverty line, and to work in service industries, many of which have been deemed
“essential services,” requiring workers to show up or face dismissal. To maintain employ-
ment, they must be at the worksite (unable to work in the shelter of home) and must uti-
lize public transportation, all increasing exposure risk. They are less likely to have health
insurance, sick leave (paid or unpaid), and less likely to use sick leave or quit a job to pro-
tect themselves from illness due to their economic precariousness. They are also more
likely to have preexisting conditions associated with greater rates of severe illness and
death, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and respiratory ailments.

Although of course it is low-income persons of color who suffer most from these dispari-
ties, it is also painful for persons of greater racial/ethnic and economic privilege who care
about injustice to witness these inequities and feel they have little power to rectify them

1Please note that statistics on the rates of COVID infections for various racial and ethnic groups are

changing rapidly.

at least in the short run.2 One white upper-class Italian ex-patriot client—whose country
of origin has socialized medicine—spent several sessions talking about her sense of horror
and rage about the socioeconomic conditions and political trends in the United States that
have resulted in these disparities, and her sense of having little potential influence aside
from donating some funds to organizations attempting to ameliorate current suffering.

FAMILY PROCESS

Disparities aside, the virus’s novelty means there is no reliable existing treatment or
preventative vaccine. For most persons, having grown up in an era of significant medical
advances even in treatment of diseases initially considered a likely death sentence (can-
cer, HIV/AIDS), this has altered the general assumption that reliable, effective health care
is available for any condition. This has resulted in a significant increase in level of fear
and sense of existential unpredictability in persons’ lives.

Unemployment and Financial Instability

Unemployment is at its highest level since the Great Depression. As of a May 8, 2020,
report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment in April was 20.5 million people,
with a rise in unemployment to 14.7% (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020). Although all
industries are affected, losses in leisure and hospitality industries (restaurants, hotels)
are particularly high, and these industries employ a disproportionate number of low-wage
earners of color. As of May 16, approximately 3,543,000 persons had applied for unemploy-
ment (Department of Labor, 2020). As was noted above, financial instability and risk of ill-
ness are synergistic—those persons with less financial resources are more likely to stay in
a job that puts them at risk than are those who have a buffer of savings, or paid leave.

Impact on Housing and Access to Basic Needs

Given the huge number of families now without income, there are grave concerns about
their housing stability. Consider New York City. The NYU Furman Center (NYU Furman
Center, 2020), which studies housing, real estate, land use, and neighborhoods in the Uni-
ted States towards informing public policy, found that:

(cid:129) “Out of almost 3.2 million households in New York City, almost 1,032,000 (totaling
nearly 3.5 million people) had at least one household member that worked in a vulnera-
ble occupation and that person earned about 67% of the total income for the household.
(cid:129) In about 549,000 households, all earners worked in vulnerable occupations, making

these households hyper-susceptible to income loss.

(cid:129) For households that earned less than $150,000 and had at least one worker in a vulnera-
ble occupation in 2018, the median household monthly income was about $4,580 and the
median rent was about $1,430.

(cid:129) Hispanic workers in particular disproportionately worked in vulnerable occupations in
2018. The potential negative impact for low-income people of color, who are predomi-
nantly renters, could be at a scale equivalent to the effects of the foreclosure crisis”
(NYU Furman Center, 2020).

How unemployed and precariously-housed families would cope with the very real prospect
of inability to pay rent, mortgage foreclosures, and possible homelessness is beyond

cer and the subsequent weeks of protests, in which persons from a wide range of socioeconomic and racial/
ethnic backgrounds participated. Many of the socioeconomic issues that result in differential illness and

comprehension or feasible government planning. New York City currently has 15,000 fam-
ilies living in shelters, and the shelters are at capacity (Coalition for the Homeless, 2020).

Psychological and Relational Effects of COVID and Quarantine

The effects of living through a pandemic include worsening of existing mental health
issues, new onset of anxiety, fear, and depression, disrupted sleep and eating patterns,
concern about becoming ill and about worsening of existing conditions. If ill from the virus,
persons may experience guilt about not being able to function in one’s usual roles, about
receiving help from others, fears of not being able to receive proper medical treatment
should the condition worsen, fear of death, or anxiety and depression about being alone
with the illness (APA, 2020; CDC, 2020). Many family members who are so far healthy but
living in close quarters with an ill family member with little ability to create consistent
physical distance have anxiety about seemingly imminent infection. And of course, fami-
lies of persons who died from the virus are mourning this loss. If the family member dies
while hospitalized, families are unable to be with them, and in many cases unable to hold
funerals in the fashion prescribed by their religions (Frayer, Estrin & Arraf, 2020), or even
locate space in cemeteries to bury them, or in crematoriums to cremate them (Feuer &
Rashbaum, 2020).

Parents are suffering great levels of stress as a result of needing to care for their chil-
dren 24/7 and aid in their online education and homework while attempting to fulfill job
responsibilities. The Harris Poll conducted for APA between April 24 and May 4 found
that the average stress level of adults was 5.4 (this compared to 4.9 in 2019); but for par-
ents with children under 18 years old, the average was 6.7 (compared to nonparent adults’
average of 5.5), with 46% of parents rating their stress levels between 8 and 10 on a ten
point scale. Seventy percent (70%) of parents reported significant stress about meeting
basic needs such as housing and food, as compared to 44% of nonparents; and 66% of par-
ents rated access to health care as a stressor, compared to 44% of nonparents (APA, 2020).
Unfortunately, rather than coming together to cope as best as possible with these stres-
sors, many couples are descending into their most destructive patterns. According to
reports by the Council on Foreign Relations (Bettinger-Lopez & Bro, 2020), the WHO
Regional Office for Europe (Kluge, 2020), Reuters (Sigal, Ramos Miranda, Martinez, &
Machicao, 2020), and the UN (UN Women, n.d.) rates of domestic violence have skyrock-
eted globally, many due to “situational couple violence,” in which conflicts that usually do
not involve physical violence have escalated due to added stress and unrelenting proxim-
ity (University of Nevada Las Vegas, 2020). Couples on the brink of divorce—“last chance
couples,” in which partners may already have separated (Fraenkel, 2019)—may be partic-
ularly at risk for increased conflict, because their commitment, cooperation, and collabora-
tion levels are low, their communication skills are limited, and they are now quarantining
together. Once again, couples with more limited financial and housing resources, higher
rates of unemployment, and at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus are at higher
risk of conflict due to these enhanced stressors.

COPING SUGGESTIONS FOR COUPLES AND FAMILIES

In part as a response to the flood of information and specific advice from psychothera-
pists on the internet, which can feel overwhelming, generic, and unintegrated to disori-
ented families, we offer the following simple four-part framework of Reaching Up, Down,
In, and Around as an organizing, flexible, culturally-adaptable guide for couples and fami-
lies, as well as for individuals and communities.

Reaching Up

FAMILY PROCESS

This pandemic and all its accompanying effects present an existential challenge to cou-
ples and families (and societies more broadly) that exceeds simple psychological and rela-
tional techniques—practices such as good communication and problem-solving skills,
creating a regular but flexible daily schedule that allows both partners to balance work
obligations with parenting and domestic chores, mindfulness practices for soothing oneself
and others, statements of mutual appreciation, and creating moments of pleasurable con-
nection despite anxiety, fear, and mourning. Although we strongly endorse these and
other practices for couples and families (Fraenkel, 2011, 2019), something more seems
needed in the face of an unpredictable, largely uncontrollable, existential, and pervasive
crisis like COVID-19. We suggest that couples and families need to reflect on their higher
and broader values—whether derived from spirituality, formal religion, moral philosophy,
or other sources of personal/humanitarian ethics. These values are often implicit and
unexamined in how persons construct their lives (Dreyfus, 2014), but certain extreme con-
ditions tend to force a reexamination of these underlying values and principles, so as to
provide a psychosocial compass to guide traversing an unfamiliar life terrain. Just as
other crises have prompted reflection on the nature of being and human life, couples and
families, as well as family therapists, need to engage their higher values to reflect on the
following sorts of questions:

(cid:129) What are the essential components and features of a reasonably secure, satisfying,
meaningful life? How much—money and material goods, novel and exciting experiences,
influence over life outcomes—is enough? And what can we do without?

(cid:129) How can we go on living with a sense of hope and purpose in the face of a situation that
may bring great reductions in our material well-being, and that may result in illness
and death?

(cid:129) What is the source and nature of courage, of hope, and of faith in a better future, and

how do we sustain those qualities and energy?

(cid:129) How can we maintain a core sense of serenity and peace in the face of realistic sources of

hardship and anxiety?

These questions guide us in sifting through what we have come to expect from life and
relationships. They inspire us to re-examine what is essential to wellness and what are
the values that inform building a new norm for our lives. Reaching Up is an integral part
of this life reconstruction project, because it often prompts a kind of reflection that seeks a
broader meaning and thus creates space for new possibilities. Reaching Up can also shift
the focus from individual and human-centered experience—what Hernandez-Wolfe (2019)
has termed “anthropocentrism”—embedded in the assumed values of our cultural and
societal norms, to adopting a wider framework that de-centers human experience and is
more inclusive of ecosystems (discussed further in the section on Reaching Down). Many
religious, faith-based, and spiritual communities in Western and non-Western cultures
provide such frameworks.

Many therapists feel uncomfortable asking couples and families to reflect on their spiri-
tual, religious, and ethical beliefs. This is a time to venture into this important territory,
because such beliefs may be crucial to promoting coping and resilience. Walsh (2009)
writes:

Spirituality is a powerful dimension of human experience involving transcendent beliefs and
practices that foster meaning, well-being, and connectedness. A spiritual worldview orients indi-
viduals and families over the life course and across generations. It provides larger values and pur-
pose, guides daily actions and relationships, and strengthens resilience in overcoming adversity.

A growing body of research documents the powerful influence of personal faith, prayer, and medi-
tation, and a faith community on physical, emotional, and relational well-being and on recovery
from illness and trauma. Spiritual distress or a spiritual void in one’s life and relationships can
contribute to suffering and block positive growth. Yet, until recently, spirituality was regarded as
“off limits” in clinical training and practice, leaving most therapists and counselors uncertain
how to approach it, if at all. (Walsh, 2009, p. xi)

Before rushing haphazardly to “adopt” the forgotten wisdom of certain religions or indige-
nous cultures, it is crucial to examine the worldviews (Sire, 2015) of the foundation of the
family therapy field. This includes naming and re-examining the assumed secularism
underpinning the theories and practices of mainstream family therapy, because therapists
often interpret clients’ life experiences, relationships, and meaning-making through these
non-spiritual lenses. Furthermore, when conversations about spirituality, religion, and
philosophy that de-centers human experiences are examined through the lens of secular-
ism, what often results is stripping a rich, nuanced worldview into simply a coping strat-
egy for people to turn to in times of crisis. I (WC) have heard well-meaning non-religious
and non-spiritual therapists merely tolerate spirituality in their practice, presumably
because it is the “culturally appropriate, politically correct” thing to do, and observe that
“it is a nice value system that people lean on to cope with difficult circumstances.” The
assumption underpinning this stance is that spirituality or religious frameworks are cre-
ated by humans, rather than through a relationship with a deity or spiritual power, as a
coping mechanism (thus, a human-centered interpretation). This implies that non-spiri-
tual reality is more "True". Moreover, it invites the interpretation that those who need this
imaginary framework to cope are intellectually compromised—an arrogant stance that
can range from benign infantilization of religious and spiritual communities to belittling
dismissal.

We are not suggesting that we and all our clients must all become spiritual and reli-
gious. Rather, I (WC), as a Christian, would suggest that even non-religious and non-spiri-
tual realities are based on a system of beliefs (e.g., Poplin, 2014). In this regard,
traditional religious and spiritual frameworks are not too far out of reach from the secular-
ism that underpins the practices and theories of family therapy. Foundational to family
systems theory is the premise that individuals’ minds, experience, and behavior are inter-
twined with their relationships to others in their immediate and larger sociocultural con-
texts. All religious and spiritual beliefs also understand the individual as relational, but
include relationships with non-human, spiritual beings such as God, or a universal
energy. Therefore, in therapeutic work with couples and families, and for families coping
with the pandemic on their own, Reaching Up involves articulating the worldviews
embedded in expectations about life and relationships (Sire, 2015), revisiting and possibly
revising their relationships to higher values.

For one of us (PF), a long-standing guiding life philosophy has been Taoism3, and the
lessons of 6th century B.C. Chinese Taoist founder Laotzu seem quite useful in meeting
the challenges of the current crisis. For instance, Laotzu emphasizes the importance of liv-
ing a simple life with few possessions and aspirations, and, instead, paying attention to

3Although Taoism, or Daoism, is often referred to as a religion, it actually has two branches, one philo-
sophic, and the other religious (Amore, Hussain, & Oxtoby, 2019). Philosophic Taoism, upon which the
present comments are based, has no concept of god or deity, no belief in an afterlife, no prescribed rituals,
no sacred text, and no established institution of religious leaders or devotees. Taosim developed in the 4th
century BCE in part as a counterpoint and criticism of the dominant Confucian religion of the time, with
its emphasis on social hierarchy and respect for those higher in the hierarchy, as well as moral and emo-
tional discipline that aligned with adhering to that hierarchy, Religious Taoism, which developed much
later (2nd century, BCE), developed all the typical beliefs, institutions, and rituals of a religion.

the special and wonderful all around us. In the opening stanza of the book of his sayings
(Bynner, 1944), he wrote:

Existence is beyond the power of words
To define:
Terms may be used
But are none of them absolute...
If name be needed, wonder names them both:
From wonder into wonder
Existence opens.

For couples and families in quarantine, adopting a stance of wonderment can take the
form of appreciating the subtleties of shifts in the sky, air, and light viewed from a win-
dow; cooking together and eating meals slowly and silently so as to actually taste the food
(Nhat Hanh & Cheung, 2011); or spending time observing a pet’s behavior when it is not
interacting with humans. For instance, bedridden with a debilitating, mysterious illness
for years, Bailey (2016) spent her days carefully and joyfully observing a small woodland
snail brought to her by a friend.

Most of all, in the spirit of wonderment, it is a time to step back from the daily relational
grind and appreciate more deeply one’s partner and kids; for kids and teens, to get to know
one’s parents better through asking about their opinions, and stories from their childhood;
and for all family members to enjoy each others’ enjoyment—of music, ideas, art, books,
sports, and other passions. Research on the relationship-strengthening effects of such pos-
itive psychology practices as inviting someone to lunch to tell them how much they have
meant to you (Seligman, 2002), or Gottman’s research (Gottman & Silver, 2015) demon-
strating the long-term positive impact of partners expressing admiration and appreciation
for one another, support this activity. Couple and family members can look at one another,
listen to one another more fully and patiently, and be grateful that the other is not ill, or
worse, dead from the coronavirus.

Shelter-at-home policies have forced everyone to slow down. It is difficult and somewhat
absurd to run about one’s domicile with the same speed one traverses a New York City
street, zooms on one’s motorcycle across the country on Route 66, or speeds down Rt. 1
along the California coast. Laotzu writes:

Gravity is the root of grace,
The mainstay of all speed. . .
What lords of countless chariots would ride them in vain,
Would make themself fool of the realm,
With pace beyond rein,
Speed beyond helm?
This can be a time to learn to respect gravity, to slow one’s movements—physical, cogni-
tive, and emotional. Although the initial weeks of responding to the pandemic resulted in
frantic gathering of food and toilet paper, and collecting needed work materials from the
office, families and couples have come to recognize that the adverse conditions will not
change so soon and that they must slow the pace. It can be useful to suggest to couples
that gravity has two meanings: It refers to the physical force that binds us to the earth,
and it also is used to characterize some problems as serious. Surely, this pandemic and its
ramifications are grave, and it can be best to adopt a slowed-down means of discussing
how best to meet new and old challenges. Empirically validated communication practices
like the Speaker-Listener Technique from the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement
Program (PREP; Markman, Stanley, & Blumberg, 2010)—which couples sometimes balk

at due to its initially artificial feel—can be introduced through this spiritual/philosophic
perspective on the value of slowness.

Taoism also promotes a stance of choosing patient inaction or “going with the flow” over
vigorous endeavor and attempts to assert control when “hard trying” is likely to result in
frustration because of larger forces. Laotzu (Bynner, 1944) writes:

Because when a (person) is in turmoil how shall (they) find
Peace
Save by staying patient till the stream clears?
How can a person’s life keep its course
If they will not let it flow?
Those who flow as life flows know
They need no other force:
They feel no wear, they feel no tear,
They need no mending, no repair.

Various Buddhist texts suggest a similar stance in the face of overwhelming, largely
uncontrollable conditions. Of course, families should continue to follow suggestions of
science-based policies on limiting exposure to the virus. But couples and families need to
cultivate greater acceptance of their inability to completely control their lives, to embrace
uncertainty (Chodron, 2018) and accept, even if painfully, the numerous cancellations of
trips, family events, academic plans, and even employment stability if it is clear nothing
can be done to alter the situation.

Finally, Taoism suggests that formalized learning borne in the academy has its limits.

Laotzu (Bynner, 1944) writes:
Leave off find learning! End the nuisance
Of saying yes to this and perhaps to that,
What slightest use are they!
If one man leads, another must follow,
How silly that is and how false!

Professionals’ recommendations for strengthening resilience, drawn from careful social
science research and clinical practice, is only one set of knowledge that can be useful. Like
other American products and practices touted to be better (and needed for advancement)
than those created in the other countries, our professional knowledge may disrespectfully
displace equal or even superior knowledge about coping with adversity, and lead persons
in those countries to second-guess their own coping wisdom. Indeed, we argue that this is
a time to learn from such societies their long-standing skills about surviving and thriving
despite adversity, developed by them due to limited material resources, political and eco-
nomic oppression, and without Western healthcare technologies and practices.

When therapists introduce ideas or practices (such as mindfulness) drawn from a spiri-
tual or religious tradition to couples and families, it is important to preface one’s com-
ments with a statement that one is not attempting to recruit the couple or family into a
particular belief system. Rather, these ideas and practices should be viewed by the thera-
pist as cultural products that the couple or family may find useful, in the same manner
that the therapist might allude to music, film, art, poetry, or other cultural products that
represent wisdom or that capture some aspect of their experience (Fraenkel, 2020). Clients
should be asked to reflect on the ideas and practices introduced by the therapist, especially
regarding whether these are helpful or not to them. Likewise, when inquiring about cli-
ents’ existing spiritual beliefs or religious faith, the therapist should be clear that she/he/
they are not attempting to transform the therapy into a faith-based approach, but rather,
is adopting a stance of respectful curiosity similar to how one would explore any other

aspect of the clients’ cultures of origin, or any aspect of their intersectional social locations
(Fraenkel, 2009).

Reaching Down

In our taxonomy, Reaching Down refers to responding to the current crisis by establish-
ing a stronger, healthier relationship with the Earth. Although there is not yet direct evi-
dence of a relationship between the pandemic, climate change, and other aspects of
human-created ecological destruction, there is good reason to believe that such a relation-
ship exists. Scholars at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health (2020) write:

Many of the root causes of climate change also increase the risk of pandemics. Deforestation,
which occurs mostly for agricultural purposes, is the largest cause of habitat loss worldwide. Loss
of habitat forces animals to migrate and potentially contact other animals or people and share
germs. Large livestock farms can also serve as a source for spillover of infections from animals to
people. Less demand for animal meat and more sustainable animal husbandry could decrease
emerging infectious disease risk and lower greenhouse gas emissions. . ..We have many reasons to
take climate action to improve our health and reducing risks for infectious disease emergence is
one of them.

Even without clear evidence of a link between disruptions in the global ecology and the
pandemic, it has alerted the entire world to the uncontrollable forces of nature. One of us
(PF) has noticed that since the beginning of the pandemic and quarantining, couples in
therapy have, for the first time, described anxieties about the state of the planet and how
global warming and other repercussions of environmental degradation may be related to
the pandemic—despite the fact that damage to the natural world has been obvious and
well covered in the media for several years, and even has resulted in new laws around
recycling and forbidding use of single-use plastics (bottles, bags). Sadly, this confirms that
for many people, concern about humans’ effects on the ecology only become salient when
they experience the direct effects of negative environmental changes (Swim et al., 2009).
Marshall (2014) hypothesizes that a combination of the brain’s biologically-based cognitive
responses of denial to overwhelming fear, coupled with an implicit social consensus not to
discuss such overwhelming fears, has resulted in ignoring the ecological crisis. The proxi-
mal nature of the pandemic seems to be bursting through this denial.

Thus, in many ways, Reaching Down is an extension or corollary of Reaching Up, lead-
ing us to widen our perspectives and re-examine our expectations of life. The pandemic
has halted the well-oiled machine of modern life in most countries and in our daily activi-
ties, centered around the human focus on production and consumption. This pause has
put into question what we expect from our future and consequently increased the general
anxiety that comes with facing the unknown. It has also given us room to stop running
ahead long enough to really take a good look around us—what is happening to the land;
the oceans, lakes, and rivers; the sky; and all the nonhuman beings with whom we cohabit
this planet. For many, it has provided time to reflect upon how decades of industrialization
and modernity has severed our lives from our ecosystem, which nevertheless is the direct
source of our livelihood, food, and general well-being.

Social and physical distancing policies can be respected while spending time outdoors,
close to the earth, and tending to nonhuman beings within and outside of our living
spaces. This is easier for me (WC) to do than it might be for persons living in more com-
pletely urbanized and densely-populated areas, since I currently live in the Pacific North-
west region of the United States with easy access to pockets of natural reserves and
neighborhood parks. Recently, I have been taking walks outside in my neighborhood—
something I have often been “too busy” to do in my pre-pandemic life. It was a gentle
reminder that the world had not ended. While human life as we knew it came to a forced

www.FamilyProcess.org

FRAENKEL & CHO

/ 857

pause, the nature surrounding me seemed to replenish and fill out the empty spaces of
human absence with all its beauty and glory. I was mindful that the most life-threatening
symptom of the coronavirus is infection of the lungs and eventual complete loss of the
capacity to breathe.

Not everyone is privileged to take leisurely walks during the pandemic. As we described
above, there are pressing concerns including economic instability, job losses, food insecuri-
ties, and escalated relational conflicts that make taking a moment to walk through nature
difficult. Thus, it is essential that therapists encourage couples and families to explore
and expand the possibilities within the constrained realities of their physical and eco-
nomic contexts. To expand their sense of possibilities, families can start by drawing upon
their surroundings to begin to redefine how they construe relational health and individual
wellbeing. The pandemic has alerted us that Reaching Down to reconnect with our envi-
ronment is not peripheral to the human experience. It is vital to our very survival on this
planet.

In addition to tending to the relationship with our surroundings, we suggest that cou-
ples and families can respond to their increased awareness of and anxiety about environ-
mental disruption by learning more about their role in the environmental effects of
human activities. We also suggest that couples and families turn to nature as a source of
recreation and pleasure. Our colleague, family psychologist Dr. Monica Sesma, a Mexican
now living and working in Calgary, in Alberta, Canada, where the weather is cold much of
the year, has encouraged families to grow vegetables and other plants in their homes, and
has observed the therapeutic effects of family members collaborating in these growing pro-
jects, as well as pride in providing themselves inexpensive, healthy food (Fraenkel,
Sesma-Vazquez, & Freeman, 2019). Ron Finley, living in the inner city of South Los Ange-
les, started a neighborhood movement to grow his own food on vacant lots, and during a
TED Talk observed that “gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do,
especially in the inner city” (Finley, 2013).

Systemic therapists must consider helping clients reintegrate all that surrounds them.
As Hernandez-Wolfe (2019) writes, “Human survival depends on our effectively relating to
everything that surrounds us” (p. 43). It is important, especially in this current context of
the pandemic that is quickly and permanently changing the modern lifestyle, that we
invest in this relationship with our surroundings by Reaching Down and widen our mean-
ing of what it means to be well.

Reaching In

The dangers of the pandemic have driven individuals and families to “shelter at home”
and stay confined to limited physical spaces for an extended period of time. For example,
the requirement to shelter at home has disrupted the increasing pattern of families dining
out (Saksena, Okrent, & Hamrick, 2018). By 2010, the percentage of meals prepared and
eaten out of the home rose to 50.2%, up from 44% in 1987. As noted earlier, children’s and
teens’ extracurricular activities—sports, music, dance, and art lessons, volunteering, reli-
gious instruction, and informal time with friends—have been all but eliminated. The most
recent survey on screen time conducted in August 2019 (Commonsensemedia.org, 2019)
indicated teens spent an average of seven hours twenty-two minutes on phones or comput-
ers, and tweens, four hours and forty-four minutes—not including time spent for school or
homework. With extracurricular activities on hold, parents are now facing children’s and
teens’ intense demands for even more screen time (Commonsensemedia.org, 2019), which
was already a major source of conflict between parents and kids (Doherty, 2000; Fraenkel,
2001c).

FAMILY PROCESS

As the themes of coping—Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around—are related, some guid-
ance for families on how to generate novel forms of individual and collective entertainment
has already been outlined in the above two sections. For instance, as families Reach Up to
spiritual, religious, and ethical values, they can engage in dialogue and friendly debate
about these values on a broader, abstract level (a debate about the existence of God, con-
versations about the seeming disconnect between some religious groups and their racist,
homophobic, dehumanizing treatment of others), as well as the place of such values in
family life. Therapists can encourage couples and families to examine and discuss the
degree of connection between their stated religious values and their behavior towards one
another. With one older high-conflict Jewish couple heavily involved in their synagogue
(but due to the pandemic, unable to spend time there), I (PF) had previously taught them
research-based communication skills (which they appreciated but rarely used) and exam-
ined in depth the problematic relationship patterns and other sources of emotional sensi-
tivity from their respective families of origin (which had little lasting effect in reducing
their conflict). Bemoaning their disconnect from their synagogue activities, I asked them
to reflect on the apparent discrepancy between their religious values and their behavior
towards one another. The partners noted, with an expression of genuine surprise, that
they had never thought about that discrepancy and went on to discuss in a helpful manner
how to bring those values and their treatment of one another into better alignment.

Likewise, families can use being stuck together in quarantine as a time to engage in
learning about and reflecting on the global ecological crisis and planning changes in their
patterns of consumption (Reaching Down). Other “analog world” activities in the category
of Reaching In that avoid increasing online/screen time include reading to one another,
playing games, singing and playing music (rather than just listening to professionally-pro-
duced music; Goodchild, 2015), writing stories and poems, making art (parents and chil-
dren doing origami together is often quite pleasurable), building things with Legos or
blocks, creating skits or whole plays, including about the pandemic; exercising together,
and doing mindfulness activities together like mindful breathing, walking, and Qi Gong,
which creates a climate of calmness and compassion, useful in times of stress and frustra-
tion (Fraenkel, 2019). Parents can also use this opportunity to get to know their children’s
musical and other tastes (books, video games) in more depth, as can couple partners. Best
of all, these activities are free, which is important in this time of economic precarity.

Gaston Bachelard (1958/2014) described the way in which physical spaces become
imbued with relational and other meanings. One of the assumptions that the pandemic
has put into question is what the expected ratio of relatedness and autonomy is in rela-
tionships (Kagitcibasi, 2005; Kerr & Bowen, 1988). Oftentimes, this expected ratio is
assumed, socialized, and normed by the sociocultural context and intergenerational pat-
terns within family units. Broadly speaking, at least in the sociocultural context of the
United States, the expected ratio is usually tipped in favor of more autonomy than related-
ness. This can be seen in the way physical spaces in homes are often conceptualized—
when economic resources allow it, each child should have a private room, each partner is
given a separate bathroom sink, and large spaces in the home are divided for breakfast,
formal dining, entertaining, and family leisure. While not all have access to such physical
spaces, this is what is largely aspired to and idealized. If these idealized floor plans of
homes are symbolic of our expected levels of relatedness and autonomy, autonomy is more
valued and thus expected within relationships. Those families whose economic means do
not allow such individualized private spaces, or whose cultural traditions favor more
shared spaces (for instance, parents and children sleeping together, siblings sharing a
bedroom and study space) may see themselves as inferior to the largely white, middle-to-
upper class assumption of physicalized separateness and autonomy; and therapists shar-
ing this bias towards autonomy and privacy among family members may subtly

www.FamilyProcess.org

FRAENKEL & CHO

/ 859

communicate their concern or even disapproval for families members sharing spaces, as
well as the ratio of time spent together versus apart.

As available physical spaces become limited due to the public health crisis, the expected
ratio of relatedness and autonomy needs to be revisited and adapted to the new reality.
What are the expectations of the ratio for close relationships within the shared living
space? By articulating the assumed ratio of relatedness and autonomy, the individuals
within the unit become aware of their bias and the differing levels within their assump-
tions. This process then creates space for communication, adjustment, and attunement to
one another within the relational unit that share living spaces in the new sociocultural
context of the post-virus era. Additionally, there is a starker distinction between those
who are in-group (that is, a unit of relationships within a shared living space) and those
who are out of this designated group. What is the expected ratio of relatedness and auton-
omy with those outside of this designated unit, both physically and emotionally?

Once the expected and assumed norm of the ratio is identified, it is important to discuss
with couples and families on what is pragmatic and reasonable in these times, when physi-
cal space and autonomy are limited. Adjusting to this new norm requires not only revising
expectations about space and privacy, but revisiting our underlying definitions of healthy
relationships and mental wellness. Shifting both the relational norms of the client(s) and
the norms of the therapist(s) is required to adjust to the new realities in which we now
live. It requires negotiating new expectations, and growing each individual’s capacity for
more relatedness and less autonomy within relational units. Again, we note that racial,
ethnic, and cultural diversity provides a wealth of local knowledge (Canagarajah, 2002) on
what relationships with varying ratios of relatedness and autonomy look like. We would
do well to listen to and learn from these communities. And again, as we discussed regard-
ing spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, before rushing haphazardly into adopting
relational knowledge from other cultures that have been historically marginalized and dis-
credited, it is critical to tread carefully with an ever-present self-critical eye on our own
unrecognized biases and attitudes embedded in our quest for knowledge.

Reaching Around

As couple and family researcher Paula Pietromonaco notes, “Social distancing and stay-
ing home are key to reducing the transmission of COVID-19, but these safeguards disrupt
couples’ and families’ routines” (Association for Psychological Science, 2020, n.p.). Social
support outside the couple relationship is well known as a protective factor and is impor-
tant to relieve stress and protect physical health (Pietromonaco & Collins, 2017). One of
the most unfortunate aspects of the government’s and scientific community’s suggestions
for containing the virus’ spread was utilizing the term “social distancing” (italics added).
Instead, we suggest rephrasing the safeguarding strategies as “physical distancing” while
promoting social connectedness. Although during “normal” times, communication tech-
nologies and social media can have deleterious effects on couple intimacy and family con-
nectedness (Fraenkel, 2001b, 2001c; Turkle, 2015), these technologies have become useful
tools for fostering family and community social support. Video chats and virtual confer-
ences are being used to take the place of face-to-face meetings. Although these virtual for-
mats cannot fully take the place of face-to-face connections, they seem to meet some of the
needs of social support that physical distancing has created. These virtual formats have
been used to replace social gatherings (e.g., video conferencing gatherings for birthday cel-
ebrations and weddings, using the video chat feature on smartphones to call extended
family members). The same technology has also been utilized to replace professional and
educational gatherings as well—both of us have held classes and conducted supervision
online since the pandemic started, and I (PF) have seen couples and families online,

Fam. Proc., Vol. 59, September, 2020

FAMILY PROCESS

without difficulty. Indeed, for couples with young kids, online therapy eliminates the chal-
lenge of arranging childcare, and commuting to and from sessions.

As we work and socialize virtually from our living spaces, the various roles and identi-
ties in our lives are starting to blend and blur. For instance, clients have at least a limited
view of our homes, which many therapists have found enhances emotional connection and
the therapeutic alliance, and “humanizes” the therapist. As a therapist who integrates
music and other arts and literature in couple and family therapy (Fraenkel, 2020), I (PF)
have ready access to my instruments and books with which to make therapeutic points in
more powerful ways than with regular “psycho-prose.” And the fact that we are “all in this
together” has strengthened the bond between therapists and clients.

Likewise, when we interface with co-workers for a meeting, we are working from our
living rooms, dining tables, or bedrooms. The others quarantined in the same living space
may be sitting just off the screen or walking across the screen in the background. During
virtual meetings, children may be making noises, vying for attention, or sleeping in the
background. Dogs are barking in the other room and cats are walking across the desk or
demanding lap time, potentially disrupting but sometimes enhancing connection and a
sense of humor and perspective. Meetings may unpredictably be interrupted by deliveries
or knocks on the door by neighbors. If in our pre-COVID lives we could limit the exposure
of the various facets of our lives to specific groups (e.g., presenting only as a professional
to co-workers, clients, and students, and as a mother or father only to our children, other
extended family members, and friends), the intersections of our various roles as profes-
sionals, caretakers, life partners, and more are now being exposed to various communities.
The sociocultural and professional norms of social connection and support need to
broaden. That is, we must come to see and consider individuals in their intersections of
multiple roles and various facets of their lives rather than through a single-faceted rela-
tionship.

We posit that the individuals, couples, and families with whom we work must rise to
this challenge and start intentionally seeing one another more transparently, fully, and
respectfully as having multiple roles and responsibilities, and as existing in multiple,
overlapping social contexts. More than ever before, we need to be more deliberate in sus-
taining and nurturing our social connections—what John Green (2015) describes in his
TED Talk as “imagining others more complexly”—and as noted earlier, in our connection
to the ecosystem. We are suggesting that we reconsider our assumptions and norms
around “boundaries” in relationships and widen the capacity of social connection from an
individual, one-dimensional construction of others based on the main purpose of our rela-
tionship (work, partner, child, family, community) to construe persons as systemic beings
—for instance, making room for our co-workers or employees to tend to a fussy baby in the
middle of a work meeting, and having patience with them when they run off screen to stop
their cats from knocking objects off shelves. As systemic and relational therapists, we have
the concepts to provide leadership in the mental health community, as well as in the com-
munities we serve and in which we live.

Widening the capacity for social connection ultimately means to de-center the experi-
ence of an individual self to consider contexts in all our relationships. With this exponen-
tially complex conceptualization of the other, it becomes impossible to know someone
fully, in all of the intersections of their life. Thus, rather than seeking to know a person
fully, we must adopt the assumption that one cannot be fully known. This assumption that
there is something more than meets the eye leaves room for consideration and curiosity.
Furthermore, it creates space and flexibility in the relationship to de-center the self and
“give the benefit of the doubt” to the other and requires higher values of compassion,
grace, patience, humility, and generosity of time and attention.

CONCLUSION

Couple, family, and community approaches to coping with and adjusting to the COVID-
19 pandemic require more than the usual panoply of techniques offered by family thera-
pists. The pandemic and its sequelae, which will last well beyond the advent of vaccines
and diminishment of the virus’s spread, requires all of us around the world to critically
examine our way of life. We need to revisit how we define and promote positive functioning
and wellness at all levels of our bio-psycho-social-spiritual lives, the ecology, as well as the
economic and political forces that remain biased in favor of persons in certain intersec-
tional social locations and against others. Now more than ever, systemic therapists, schol-
ars, and researchers must provide leadership not just within the four walls of the office (or
at present, on video screens).

The virtual (literally and figuratively) explosion of advice from therapists and other profes-
sionals that has accompanied the coronavirus is well intentioned, but can leave distressed
couples and families overwhelmed with information and suggested “best practices.” We offer
our simplified taxonomy—Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around—as an easily memorable and
culturally-flexible set of resilience principles and guideposts for our journey through the “psy-
cho-relational geography” of coping. One of us (PF) was fortunate to study with one of the
founders of the field, Salvador Minuchin, from whom he learned, among many other craft
principles of therapy, the importance of “building intensity.” For Minuchin, “building inten-
sity” meant the use of novel, memorable, engaging, short phrases and visual imagery (as well
as novel relational enactments in session) to transmit a therapeutic message more powerfully
than often does scientifically-accurate but plain, unimaginative, explanatory therapeutic
prose (Minuchin, Reiter & Borda, 2014). We believe that powerful interventions must “cap-
ture the imagination” of couples and families (Fraenkel, 2020), and metaphorically speaking,
“ring in their heads and conversations” like a clear bell. We suggest that the phrase Reaching
Up, Down, In, and Around represents just such a novel, salient therapeutic message.

Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around are interconnected categories of family reflection
and activity which inform and borrow from one another. As an overarching “four-post”
guide to foster coping and resilience, it represents various vantage points on the same call
to widen our perspective on what phenomenological-existential philosopher Martin Hei-
degger called “Dasien” or Being-in-the-World (Dreyfus, 2014), what Laotzu called the Tao,
or Way of Life (Bynner, 1944), and what from a Christian perspective is about rediscover-
ing and adhering to God’s original design for life (Lewis, 1952/1980). The pandemic calls
us to create significant and profound changes in our daily lives and our understanding of
what Thich Nhat Hanh calls “interbeing” (2001). Our ideas harken back to an earlier era
of psychotherapy that predates the advent of family therapy—one less focused on tech-
niques of change and more on supporting persons as they confront emotional and concrete
life crises by exploring the meaning of their existence (van Deurzen, Craig, L€agle, Schnei-
der, Tantam, & du Plock, 2019).

As systemic therapists, the assumed norms of relationships need to include considera-
tions of bio-psycho-social-spiritual aspects of the human experience. By reaching Up,
Down, In, and Around, we can sift through the assumptions and values that determine
how we understand and study relational wellness, and begin to build a new normal better
fitted to the drastic transformations to the world caused or exacerbated by the virus and
its many sequelae.
