Mindfulness is an intervention that was used in many psychiatry treatments. In this study, the subject experi-
enced  two  different  states:  (1)  attention  (i.e.,  listening  to  a  podcast)  and  (2)  mindfulness  (i.e.,  meditation). 
Twenty-two students were included in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course with EEG recording 
sessions  on  week  four  and  week  six.  Brain  dynamics  were  investigated  to  elucidate  the  complexity  and  con-
nectivity  of  the  brain.  The  alpha  PSD  increased  in  all  brain  areas  during  mindfulness  in  both  weeks.  For 
complexity, Fractal Dimension (FD) increased significantly during meditation in the week six recording. When 
comparing the FD in the mindfulness state of week four and week six, we also witnessed a significant increase in 
the following week. The coherence of the interhemispheric frontal and temporal regions increased significantly 
in both weeks. In conclusion, the subject successfully transferred from attention to mindfulness, demonstrated by 
the  alpha  changes  when  going  from  podcast  to  meditating.  An  enhancement  in  brain  complexity  was  found, 
suggesting an augmentation in cognitive function. Finally, the coherence exhibits strengthened connections in 
the frontal area.   

1. Introduction 

In recent years, mindfulness practice has become increasingly com-
mon as a mind-body intervention for various medical and psychiatric 
conditions, complementing traditional medical intervention (Jain et al., 
2007; Marchand, 2012; Travis et al., 2018). Furthermore, mindfulness is 
widely  accepted  and  practiced  among  the  healthy  population  as  an 
effective counter-stress method. As a result, it is critical to evaluate the 
impact of this practice on brain activity and to find its neural and psy-
chological  correlates.  Previous  works  demonstrated 
the 
eight-week-long Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is 
longitudinally  associated  with  an  increase  in  Electroencephalogram 
(EEG) alpha band power, which suggests that MBSR might enhance the 
practitioner’s ability to regulate emotion and direct attention internally 
(An et al., 2022; Morais et al., 2021). Though the after-effect of MBSR 
practices has been indicated, little is known regarding its real-time or 
immediate  effect  on  brain  dynamics  measured  by  neural  activity 
complexity or neural connectivity.

Mindfulness can be defined as the awareness that arises from paying 
attention  on  purpose,  in  the  present  moment,  non-judgmentally 
(Kabat-Zinn,  2003).  This  state  can  be  cultivated  through  a  variety  of 
mindfulness practices, all of which involve the process of focusing on an 
object of awareness (e.g., breath), maintaining and directing attention 
towards that object whenever the mind wanders (Hanley et al., 2015; 
Quaglia et al., 2016). The mindful state can be characterized by distinct 
physiological  characteristics.  For  example,  studies  that  compared 
resting state and mindfulness have shown that mindfulness is charac-
terized  by  decreased  heart rate,  respiratory  rate,  blood  pressure,  skin 
conductance, and increased alpha oscillations. Those signatures suggest 
that mindfulness induces a physiologically quiescent state. Accordingly, 
since  mindfulness  directly  involves  both  consciousness  and  attention, 
the neural correlates of these brain processes and those of meditative 
states  should  manifest  strong  similarities  (Manuello  et  al.,  2016). 
Although  a  variety  of  studies  compared  mindfulness  practice  with 
resting state, there is little study that compares physiological features 
that  demonstrate  the  differences  between  mindfulness  and  normal

attention. 

The Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) or Fractal Dimension (FD) was 
shown  to  be  useful  in  discriminating  different  mental  state  and  be  a 
reliable  indicator  for  cognitive  fuction  (Lutzenberger  et  al.,  1992; 
Ruiz-Padial & Ib´a˜nez-Molina, 2018; Sebasti´an et al., 2021; Stoki´c et al., 
2015). In meditation research, the previous study has proven that the 
HFD value of EEG signal during different forms of meditation is higher 
than  in  the  resting  state,  which  was  interpreted  as  increasing 
self-organization  of  the  hierarchical  structure  of  the  oscillators in  the 
brain  (Vyˇsata  et  al.,  2014).  Interestingly,  the  HFD  of  the  Senior  and 
Teacher practitioners was lower in general compared to Novice practi-
tioners  while  still  maintaining  the  same  trend  (i.e.,  HFD  while  medi-
tating is higher than in the resting state) (Kakumanu et al., 2018). This 
result was explained as the difference in approach and tragedy of Novice 
and Senior practitioners in meditating (Kakumanu et al., 2018). Previ-
ous  research  mainly  recruited  experienced  practitioners  or  Novice 
groups  with  at  least  two  to  three  ten-day  courses  and  compared  the 
meditation  experience  with  the  resting  state  (Vyˇsata  et  al.,  2014; 
Kakumanu et al., 2018). This strategy limits our understanding of how 
beginners  approach  mindfulness  and  could  not  elucidate  how  the 
mindfulness state transforms through practices (e.g., how the level of 
consciousness or attention of the subject change through the practices in 
the early state). 

Furthermore, it is suggested that mindfulness might also differ from 
other  mental  states  in  terms  of  brain  connectivity  other  than  just 
complexity.  Functional  connectivity  of  different  networks  has  been 
utilized to demonstrate that mindfulness can alter and enhance certain 
connections or networks in the attention regions (Cahn & Polich, 2013; 
Santarnecchi  et  al.,  2021;  Travis  &  Arenander,  2006;  Xiong  &  Dor-
aiswamy, 2009). Specifically, a functional MRI (fMRI) study by Sezer 
et al. found that functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate 
cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was shown to increase during 
mindfulness  meditation,  which  may  relate  to  attention  control  (Sezer 
et al., 2022). Also, another fMRI study showed that functional connec-
tivity of neural regions related to attentional control was higher for in-
dividuals who exhibit Trait Mindfulness, who scored high on Five-Facet 
Mindfulness Questionnaire (Parkinson et al., 2019). A study evaluating 
whole  brain  connectivity  using  EEG  phase  analysis  showed  that  elec-
trode  pairs  exhibited  connection  while  the  meditating  condition  was 
more than in the control condition (Ahani et al., 2014). 

Noticeably, most studies apply fMRI to analyze the functional con-
nectivity of the brain while meditating, yet the fMRI acquisition con-
dition  could  limit  or  impact  the  meditation  experience.  It  is 
recommended to use EEG recording to best reproduce the meditation 
process (Kakumanu et al., 2018). Hence, more studies should utilize EEG 
to  assess  the  connectivity  of  the  mindfulness  process  to  validate  and 
clarify  the  conclusions  from the  fMRI  study.  Another  gap in  previous 
works is reporting the impact of mindfulness on attention-related brain 
areas while comparing the differences between the resting state versus 
mindfulness or directly assessing the brain network of the experienced 
meditator.  Not  much  research  has  directly  compared  (1)  activity 
involved in attention versus (2) mindfulness activity. 

In this study, our experiment was designed for the subject to expe-
rience  two  different  states:  attention  (i.e.,  listening to  a  podcast)  and 
mindfulness.  We  utilize  Higuchi  Fractal  Dimension  and  Coherence  to 
clarify the brain dynamic in different states, and the experiments were 
conducted  over  the  course  of  22  subjects.  The  recording  sessions 
occurred in week four and week six of an eight-week-long MBSR course 
to illustrate how the mindfulness state enhances certain physiological 
properties  linked  with  cognitive  function  over  the  course.  The  study 
elucidates the effect of mindfulness on the brain level and objectively 
demonstrates how the mindfulness state progress for the novice practi-
tioner.  The  result  can  be  used  as  a  preliminary  to  study  the  brain 
mechanism of mindfulness in novice practitioners.

2. Methodology 

2.1. Participants 

The subjects of interest are 22 students whose ages ranged from 18 to 
22 years old at the time the study was carried out (15 females; 20.93 ±
0.68 years and 7 males; 20.43 ± 0.5 years) where they participated in a 
recent MBSR study (An et al., 2022). Additionally, students who meet 
the following criteria were excluded from the study: (i) smokers; people 
with  (ii)  left-handed  or  (iii)  impaired  vision;  (iv)  high-dose  caffeine 
users; (v) patients who are diagnosed with mental disorders or have a 
family history of any mental disorders according to DSM-5 criteria; and 
(vi)  people  with  abnormalities  in  the  endocrine  system.  Participants 
were informed of their responsibilities and all the procedures involved 
in  the  trial,  and  they  were  asked  to  sign  the  informed  consent  form 
before the study began. 

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of 
Biomedical  Engineering,  International  University,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City 
Vietnam National University. 

2.2. Experiment design 

involved 

Participants  were 

in  an  eight-week-long  standard 
Mindfulness-based  Stress  Reduction  (MBSR)  Program.  These  partici-
pants then underwent EEG experiment sessions in combination with the 
State of Mindfulness Scales (SMS) questionnaire in the fourth and sixth 
week  of  the  course  to  evaluate  the  immediate  effect  of  meditation 
practices on their brain activity. 

During experimental sessions, the experiment was designed for each 
participant  to  experience  a  mental  state  involved  in  attention  (i.e., 
listening to an 8-minute-long podcast), followed by a mindfulness state 
(i.e., 13-minute guided meditation). Also, during the podcast and guided 
meditation, each participant’s brain activity was monitored by a real- 
time  portable  EEG  device  (Emotiv  EPOC+)  to  enhance  the  feasibility 
and convenience of their meditation experiences. Moreover, to mimic 
the settings of the training course, each experimental session was con-
ducted in pairs (i.e., during each session, two participants were invited 
and  had  their  brain  activity  monitored  simultaneously).  The  MBSR 
coach  recommended  this  setting  as  it  is  suggested  that  the  effect  of 
mindfulness experienced by practitioners would be more robust if they 
practiced in a group.(Fig. 1). 

2.3. EEG recording and protocol 

Emotiv  EPOC+ machines  were  used  for  collecting  EEG  signals 
(Duvinage  et  al.,  2013;  Zabcikova,  2019).  The  Emotiv  EPOC+ was  a 
portable, multi-channel, high-resolution neural headset. It was a set of 
14 channels plus two references to collect electrical signals generated by 
the brain. The system has a sampling rate of 128 Hz, a built-in digital 
5th-order  Sinc  filter,  and  a  50 Hz  and  60 Hz  digital  Notch  filter.  The 
Emotiv EPOC+ system uses CMS/P3 as the electrical reference point and 
DRL/P4 as the noise-cancellation electrode. The CMS/DRL pair forms a 
common  mode  cancellation  circuit  which  includes  the  injection  of  a 
small  high-frequency  signal  into  DRL.  The  CMS  (left  side)  reference 
voltage is subtracted from each EEG sensor voltage in hardware at the 
input amplifier for each of the other channels.(Fig. 2). 

14-channel EEG data were collected during two conditions: (1) an 8- 
min radio podcast (control condition) with opened eyes, and (2) 13-min 
of sitting mindfulness meditation. The coach of the MBSR course guided

2.4. Data processing and analysis 

2.4.1. EEG preprocessing 

The  primary  goal  of  the  EEG  processing  step  is  to  eliminate  or 
attenuate artifacts while preventing the loss of crucial signal informa-
tion. In this study, the recorded EEG signal was preprocessed using: (1) 
Empirical Mode Decomposition with Masking signal (MEMD) to remove 
high-frequency  noises  (e.g.,  electromyography  (EMG)  and  power- 
induced  noises)  and  low-frequency  oscillations,  and  (2)  Independent 
Component  Analysis  (ICA)  methods  to  reduce  and  eye-blink  and  eye 
movement artifacts (Deering & Kaiser, 2005; Do et al., 2022). Regarding 
the  low  sampling  frequency  (i.e.  128 Hz),  the  study  focused  on 
analyzing frequency under 30 Hz and gamma bands were removed from 
the EEG recording to prevent aliased EMG (Fig. 3) (Ahani et al., 2014). 
The  first  EEG  preprocessing  step  was  assisted  with  MEMD,  an 
enhanced version of EMD algorithms to decompose signals into sets of 
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) (Huang et al., 1998). Since each IMF can 
represent the oscillation characterized by a distinct frequency range, the 
EMD  algorithm  can  be  viewed  as  a  natural  dyadic  filter  bank,  which 
helps  remove  noises  from  signals  (e.g.,  the  first  IMFs  are  usually 
power-induced  noises  or  EMD,  which  are  characterized  by  high  fre-
quency and high power) (Flandrin et al., 2003). The enhanced MEMD 
version  was  used  in  this  study  instead  of  the  original  EMD  since  this 
version was shown to resolve the inherent mode-mixing problems of the 
original problem (Deering & Kaiser, 2005). 

The procedure of MEMD-assisted preprocessing is similar to that of 
the original MBSR study (An et al., 2022). It can be described as follows: 
(1)  the  EEG  signal  was  decomposed  sequentially  by  MEMD  with  a 
masking signal of frequency at 50 Hz to a maximum of twelve (N = 12) 
IMFs; (2) the Hilbert transform was applied to each IMF to obtain the 
frequency distribution of each IMF; (3) the first IMF characterized by 
high-frequency  components  and  the  last  three  IMFs  dominated  by 
low-frequency components were removed. The clean signal was finally 
obtained by summing up the remaining IMFs. These steps were operated 
using an open-source Python EMD (Quinn et al., 2021). Eventually, the 
clean  signals  underwent  automatic  EOG  removal  based  on  ICA  and 
Machine Learning algorithms to remove eye movement and eye-blink 
artifacts (Do et al., 2022).(Fig. 4). 

2.5.1. Power spectral density (PSD) 

Power  Spectral  Density  (PSD)  is  a  crucial  feature  for  EEG  signal 
analysis since analyzing PSD can shed light on brain activation. A pre-
vious EEG study on the immediate effects of MBSR also reported the PSD 
changes associated with a mindful state (i.e., a general increase in alpha 
and/or theta power during mindfulness compared with resting phases) 
(Aftanas & Golocheikine, 2001; Fan et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2005; 
Tang et al., 2009). In general, PSD is a method to explain how the power 
of  a  signal  is  divided  over  its  frequency  range.  In  the  case  of  using 
Welch’s method to calculate PSD, the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm 
(FFT) is used to measure the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the 
central  part  of  the  method  with  the  following  equation  (Anasi  et  al., 
2018): 

X[f] =

∑N(cid:0) 1

n=0

x[n]e

2πi
N kn 

In the formula above, N is the number of points of the DFT, k = 0,1, 

…, N-1, i is the imaginary unit, e

2πi
N  is the Nth root of the unit. 

In our study, the total spectral power resulting from PSD calculation 
at each channel was then partitioned by three frequency ranges to obtain 
the spectral power of three bands: theta (4–7 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), and 
beta (15–30 Hz). Instead of performing the log-transform on the spectral 
powers to obtain the absolute power, we normalized all spectral powers 
by total spectral power between 4 Hz and 40 Hz to obtain the relative 
power  to  minimize  the  inter-individual  differences  in  absolute  power 
(Bian  et  al.,  2014;  Papagiannopoulou  &  Lagopoulos,  2016;  Sammler 
et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2018). 

2.5.2. Fractal dimensions (FD) 

In  this  study,  we  use  Higuchi’s  techniques  to  estimate  the  FD  of 
waveform signals, as previously explained in detail by (Paramanathan & 
Uthayakumar, 2008). A few critical elements of the algorithms will be 
reviewed once more (Higuchi, 1988). 

To  begin,  Higuchi  used  simulated  data  Y(i)  (i = 1,  2,.,  N)  with  a 
fractal dimension of 1.5 to demonstrate the technique. Y(i) are formed as 
a result of:

2016; Srinivasan et al., 2007; Unde &  Shriram, 2014). The coherence 
was computed per pair of electrodes and averaged across all subjects. 
After we computed the coherence matrices, we divided the matrix into 
regions based on the observed clusters and then performed an ANOVA 
analysis on the chosen area. The three main clusters chosen are the left 
frontal-temporal  area,  the  right  frontal-temporal  area,  and  the  inter-
hemispheric frontal-temporal area (Fig. 5). 

2.6. Statistical analysis 

Two-way repeated measure ANOVA was conducted to test the effect 
of two within-subject independent variables which are time (levels =
week 4 and week 6) and group (mindfulness and podcast state) on the 
ˇ
Sid´ak tests were 
values of PSD, FD, and Coherence. Post-hoc Tukey and 
further used to investigate whether there was any within-group differ-
ence between the three assessments of each group. It should be noted 
that the Coherence and FD statistical analyses only was performed on 19 
participants  (N = 19)  who  completed  all  data  collections.  Regarding 
that the data samples were recorded with-in subjects and could violate 
the  assumption  of  sphericity,  the  Geisser-Greenhouse  correction  was 
applied for all tests. GraphPad Prism 8.0 software was used to analyze 
the  differences  in  three  EEG  extracted  features  (e.g.,  relative  band 
power, fractal dimension, and connectivity) between two states: atten-
tion  (i.e.,  listening  to  the  podcast)  and  mindfulness.  In  the  analyses 
described  below,  significant  results  were  demonstrated  when  the  p- 
value  was  < 0.05.  We  specified  the  star  representing  the  p-value  re-
ported in APA style, according to: 0.033 (*),0.002 (**), < 0.001 (***), 
and < 0.0001 (****) for all figures. The statistical results were plotted as 
column graphs.

3.1. Change in power density in different frequency bands during 
meditation state compares to podcast state 

While the main objective of our study was to examine the effect of 
meditation on the dynamics of the brain, one of the concerns would be 
how  to  validate  that  the  subject  has  entered  the  meditation  state.  To 
answer the question, we calculated the spectral density (or PSD) for each 
channel at the meditation and podcast states since the meditation state 
was  shown  to  link  with  an  increase  in  PSD  of  the  alpha  band  and  a 
decrease in PSD of the beta band (Ahani et al., 2014). Representative 
and summary results are shown in Fig. 6. Representative spectrogram of

Subject  I19  in  week  six  during  Podcast  (Fig.  6 A)  and  Meditation 
(Fig. 6B, yellow arrow) reveals that while the alpha band’s energy in the 
Podcast state is relatively high in some periods, the energy of the alpha 
band  in  the  meditation  state  is  spread  equally  over  the  entire  state. 
Moreover,  the  power  distribution  over  the  scalp  in  the  first  100 s 
(Fig. 6 C) was distinctively characterized by an increase in alpha band 
power in the meditation phase versus podcast, mainly in the frontal area. 
Further quantification revealed a substantial increase of alpha PSD in 
all  brain  areas  during  the  meditation  state  in  both  weeks  (Fig.  6D  i,  
Table 1). Additionally, when going from podcast to meditating, a sig-
nificant reduction of PSD was seen for both beta and theta bands in both 
weeks (Fig. 6D ii and Fig. 6D iii, Table 1). However, no difference was 
discovered  when  comparing  the  energy  of  all  frequency  bands  of  the 
meditation state between week four and week six (N = 19). Overall, our 
result is in line with those from previous meditation studies, indicating 
an  increase  in  alpha  power  and/or  theta  power  during  mindfulness 
compared to the resting state (Aftanas & Golocheikine, 2001; Fan et al., 
2014; Takahashi et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2009). In conclusion, the PSD 
value demonstrates a clear difference between meditation and listening 
to the podcast. 

3.2. An overall increase in Fractal Dimension was found during 
Meditation when compared to Podcast 

The  Fractal  Dimension  is  suggested  to  be  a  reliable  indicator  to 
differentiate mental state and a good quantifier for cognitive function (i. 
e. attention) (Lutzenberger et al., 1992; Ruiz-Padial &  Ib´a˜nez-Molina, 
2018; Sebasti´an et al., 2021; Stoki´c et al., 2015). In order to quantify the 
two different states of the subject, we compared the Fractal Dimension of 
all  subjects  between  two  states  and  two  weeks  using  ANOVA  with 
post-hoc analysis. In Fig. 7A, we can observe a thicker line of the signal 
corresponding with the meditation state (Fig. 7A ii) with a higher Fractal 
Dimension value compared to the signal in the podcast state (Fig. 7A i) 
with  a  lower  Fractal  Dimension  value.  This  illustration  demonstrated 
that the signal in the meditation state is more complex than the signal in 
the podcast state, with the Dimension value nearly reaching two (i.e., a 
one-dimensional  signal  has  the  complexity  nearly  reaching  a 
two-dimensional state). While there was no difference in the HFD value 
of both states in week four (Mean Difference ¼ 0.009, SE ¼ 0.016 with 
p = 0.8170), a slight increase was observed between the podcast stage 
and meditation stage in week six (Mean Difference ¼ 0.04, SE ¼ 0.008 
with p < 0.0001) (Fig. 7B). An increase in fractal value of the meditation 
stage between week four and week six was also found (Mean Difference 
¼ 0.05, SE ¼ 0.015 with p = 0.0074). The results demonstrated that 
brain complexity improved over a short period of practicing MBSR. In 
conclusion,  the  result  implies  that  mindfulness  involves  higher 
complexity than listening to podcasts. 

3.3. Patterns of increase in coherence were found in different lobes 
between different phases and weeks 

The  FD  analysis  shows  that  meditation  greatly  influences  brain 
complexity and can imply a manifestation of enhancement in cognitive 
function (Fig. 7). We further validate this result by computing coherence 
matrices to assess the connectivity between the regions with the intent 
to evaluate the difference between attention (i.e., listening to a podcast) 
versus mindfulness (Bowyer, 2016). Overall, Fig. 8A illustrates the dis-
tribution of the coherence value between different pairs of electrodes. A 
high-  and  localized  distribution  of  coherence  value  was  found  in  the 
frontal area (AF3, F3, F7, FC5, AF4, F4, F8, FC6) and temporal area (T7, 
T8).  A  cluster  of  high  coherence  levels  of  the  inter-hemispheric  and 
intra-hemispheric of the left and right frontal-temporal lobes was also 
observed. We then divide the electrode pairs into lobes and use ANOVA 
to  analyze  them.  The  coherence  during  meditation  was  found  to  be

significantly  higher  than  that  during  listening  to  the  podcast  in  most 
regions per week. For the coherence between the left frontal and tem-
poral lobes (Fig. 8B i), we found no change between the meditation and 
podcast  in  week  four  but  a  significant  increase  in  week  six  (Table  2, 
increased by 0.11 ± 0.01, p < 0.0001). 

On  the  contrary,  a  significant  increase  in  coherence  between  the 
right frontal and temporal lobes was found in week 4 (Table 2, increase 
by 0.21 ± 0.04, p ¼ 0.0022) but not in week 6 (Fig. 8B ii). The inter-
hemispheric  coherence  of  the  frontal-temporal  lobe  is  the  only  one 
(Fig. 8B iii) with a consistent trend in both weeks, with an increase of 
0.16 ± 0.03  (Table  2,  p  = 0.0002)  in  week  four  and  an  increase  of 
0.09 ± 0.01 (Table 2, p < 0.0001) in week six. On the other hand, the 
results also show that the coherence during meditation state between 
weeks  does  not  have  much  difference,  especially  in  the  intra- 
hemispheric  connectivity  of  right  frontal-temporal  (p = 0.32)  and 
inter-hemispheric  connectivity  of 
regions 
(p = 0.21)  (Fig.  8B,  Table  1).  The  only  exception  is  the  left  frontal- 
temporal  region,  with  an  increase  of  0.21 ± 0.05  (Table  2,  p  =
0.0061) in coherence in week six compared to week four. Additionally, 
comparing the coherence of the podcast state between weeks, we see an 
increase in all lobes (Table 2, Fig. 8B), indicating a meditation-induced 
enhancement  of  the  functional  connectivity  in  the  frontal  area.  In 
conclusion, mindfulness practice has strengthened the connectivity in 
the  interhemispheric  frontal-temporal  area  after  a  short  period  of 
practice. However, the effect of mindfulness in enhancing connectivity 
in  the  intra-hemispheric  frontal-temporal  lobes  needs  to  be  assessed 
carefully.

3.4. The immediate effect is insignificant after analyzing the State 
Mindfulness Scale (SMS) outcomes and the correlation between brain 
response and the SMS 

The  study  utilized  the  State  Mindfulness Scale  and  then  applied  a 
Two-way ANOVA analysis to understand the self-perceived mindfulness 
state changes of subjects after 13 min of meditating. Additionally, we 
conducted the linear regression between the total score of the SMS and 
EEG  signals  (including  FD  and  PSD  relative  power)  to  observe  the 
relationship  between  the  mindfulness  perception  level  and  brain 
response. According to the outcomes of the SMS, no mindfulness state 
enhancement of each subject was detected between week four and week 
six in all subscales (p > 0.05) (Fig. 9A). Subsequently, the correlation 
outcomes  between  two-time  measurements  did  not  reveal  any  rela-
tionship  between  subjective  perception  in  mindfulness  state  and  EEG 
features  either  (Fig.  9B).  Also,  when  comparing  the  linear  regression 
slopes of practitioners at two-time points, the evaluations did not reveal 
any significant differences (p > 0.05) (Fig. 9B). In conclusion, the im-
mediate effect of MBSR on improving mindfulness state and the rela-
tionship  between  self-reported  mindfulness  level  and  the  quantitative 
EEG were not established. 

4. Discussions 

The study was carried out to investigate the instantaneous effect of 
mindfulness on the brain when transitioning from an external awareness 
into an internal awareness and the brain dynamic after a short period of 
practice. Overall, the EEG and questionnaires analysis show a noticeable 
difference between the state of internal awareness during listening to the 
podcast  and  internal  awareness  while  practicing  meditation.  Further-
more, EEG analysis suggested that mindfulness practice might enhance 
brain activities, especially on the level of consciousness and the level of 
connectivity in the frontal area. 

4.1. Increase in the alpha band power suggests an effective setting for 
meditation 

The PSD analysis has demonstrated that our environment setting for 
meditation was practical. We found a significant increase in alpha power 
during the meditation versus the podcast phase (Fig. 6). Previous studies 
also indicated the alpha increase in prefrontal and frontal cortices when 
examining the changes in brain activity in resting states or meditating 
(Cahn  &  Polich,  2006;  Morais  et  al.,  2021;  Takahashi  et  al.,  2005). 
However, our results show an enhancement in the alpha band across all 
cortical  lobes.  This  effect  may  happen  due  to  task  differences,  as 
listening to podcasts is an activity that requires much more attention and 
hence  lowers  alpha  band  power;  in  contrast,  other  studies  mainly 
compare meditation versus resting state. 

4.2. Increase in the FD index suggests that mindfulness can enhance 
cognitive function 

Fractal Dimension (FD) is a metrics that can be used to interpret the 
complexity of the brain signals, which was also suggested to be a reliable 
quantifier for cognitive function (Sebasti´an et al., 2021). In this study, 
mindfulness FD increase significantly in week 6, as compared to corre-
sponding figure in week 4. In week 6, FD during mindfulness meditation 
was  also  significantly  higher  than  FD  in  podcast  (Fig.  7).  This  is 
consistent  with  the  previous  study,  indicating  that  Fractal  Dimension 
increases  during  meditation  (Kakumanu  et  al.,  2018;  Vyˇsata  et  al., 
2014).  From  the  FD  analysis  result,  we  can  see  an  increase  of  FD  in 
meditatation  state  when  compare  week  four  versus  week  six,  with  a 
significant  increase  in  complexity  in  week  six.  This  increase  of  FD  in 
week  6  is  another  evidence  showing  mindfulness  practice  enhance 
physiological  properties  linked  with  the  level  of  consciousness.  One 
fundamental limitation was that when we compared the FD in the scalp 
space, we could not observe any noticeable trend in any single electrode. 
However, when we average the FD value per person, an apparent trend 
of FD can be witnessed. A possible explanation for this is the different 
levels of increase in Fractal Dimension across the brain regions. While 
we  computed  the  Fractal  Dimension  for  each  electrode,  the  ANOVA 
analysis was performed for all the electrodes but not for different lobes 
and regions and, therefore, could result in an insignificant distribution. 

4.3. Increase in frontal lobe interhemispheric and intra-hemispheric 
coherence indicates the effect of MBSR on the brain 

The boundaries of mindfulness and attention are difficult to define, 
and  studies  have  been  conducted  to  find  an  integrative  neuroscience 
perspective on the two concepts (Manuello et al., 2016; Verdonk et al., 
2020). While the Fractal Dimension can provide a clear depiction of the 
brain  complexity  of  the  two  states,  the  coherence  between  the  brain 
areas help us elucidate the differences in functional connection between 
mindfulness and  attention. The results (Fig.  8) have a  higher  level of 
coherence for meditation than that of the podcast state (i.e., the level of 
coherence  for  mindfulness  is  higher  than  that  for  attention  task). 
Moreover, between two weeks, we can see a consistent increase in all 
lobes  during  the  podcast  phase.  This  result  can  be  interpreted  as  an 

IBRONeuroscienceReports14(2023)308–319316H. Do et al.

enhancement of meditation on executive attention (Norris et al., 2018). 
When we compare the coherence level per week, the week four result 
shows  an  equal  level  of  coherence  between  two  frontal-temporal 
hemispheres  in  the  podcast  state  with  the  coherence  level  of  the  left 
frontal-temporal hemisphere (Fig. 8B i and Fig. 8B ii). The only excep-
tion was the right frontal-temporal hemisphere during meditation, with 
a  significantly  higher  level  of  coherence  than  the  left  hemisphere 
(Fig. 8B i and Fig. 8B ii). This result is consistent with previous research 
reports  that  meditation  enhances  right  hemispheric  functioning  even 
after a short meditation period (Pagano & Frumkin, 1977). 

While the coherence level of the right frontal-temporal hemisphere 
during meditation was not significant compared to both podcast state 
and left-hemisphere meditation, the average coherence level was lower 

compared to other states (Fig. 8B i and Fig. 8B ii). This complex behavior 
may result from external factors that the experiment design could not 
cover  (i.e.,  distress  and  mental  states).  For  future  research,  it  is  sug-
gested  to  utilize  the  experiment  with  psychological  questionnaires  to 
assess the participants’ mental state. In conclusion, the impact does not 
demonstrate  an  improvement  in  the  meditation  practice.  However,  it 
illustrates the effect of rewiring the connection in the brain, illustrated 
by the increased coherence in the podcast state. 

4.4. The SMS questionnaire illustrates the low coherence between 
mindfulness level and physiological properties 

While  the  EEG  features  demonstrate  the  effect  of  mindfulness 

IBRONeuroscienceReports14(2023)308–319317H. Do et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

practice  in  enhancing  physiological  properties  linked  with  cognitive 
function, the SMS questionnaire result illustrates no significant change 
over  two  weeks of  mindfulness  practice. This  result  opens  a  few sug-
gestions,  including  that  the  SMS  scale  may  have  low  sensitivity  and 
could not detect the subtle change in the mindfulness level of novice 
practitioners  over  a  short  period  of  practice.  While  it  is  arbitrary  to 
conclude where the problems are based, we suggest that future research 
utilize different scales to gain more insight into the mindfulness level of 
the subject. It should also be noted that the boundary of the mindfulness 
state is ubiquitous, so it is difficult to evaluate whether the physiological 
properties correlate with any dimension of mindfulness. 

5. Limitations 

Despite the clear results of coherence measurement of the EEG signal 
during  meditation,  several  limitations  exist.  First,  it  is  essential  to 
consider  the  volume  conduction  effect  on  the  acquired  signal.  (Srini-
vasan et al., 2007) research has pointed out that volume conduction can 
levitate EEG coherence for moderately separated (<10 cm) electrodes, 
and  a minor  elevation was observed with widely separated  (>20 cm) 
electrodes.  While  this  partially  explains  why  there  is  high  coherence 
focus focally on the frontal area, it is still intriguing for future research to 
investigate why there was an increase in coherence between weeks and 
between states. 

Another limitation of the research is the implementation of an EEG 
system  using  a  common  reference  electrode.  Regarding  George  Fein 
et al. work, common reference coherence data can be inflated or deflated 
because  of  activity  at  the  reference  (Fein  et  al.,  1988).  While  the 
coherence data was computed average between the subjects, the data 
was  potentially  at  risk  of  being  contaminated  by  reference  electrode 
activity  and,  therefore,  limited  the  utility  of  the  data.  The  coherence 
result  can  still  be  used  as  a  reference  as  there  were  not  any  flawless 
reference  techniques  up-to-date.  However,  it  should  be  considered 
carefully and needs further study using fMRI to validate the result. 

Finally,  we  also  want  to  discuss  the  small  sample  size  (N = 22), 
which  limited  the  statistical  power  to  detect  the  effects.  The  small 
sample size is the major limitation of mindfulness research(Ghawadra 
et  al.,  2019).  Considering  that  the  meditation  training  course  was 
designed  to accommodate a maximum of 25 people  for the course to 
deem effective, we suggested that future research should employ other 
strategies to be able to include a larger sample size and make the effects 
more detectable and generalizable. 

6. Conclusion 

The objective of this research was to assess the instantaneous effect 
of mindfulness on the brain compared to another audio task and in a 
short period of practice. The Power Spectrum analysis shows a signifi-
cant increase in the relative alpha power immediately after meditation 
compared to the previous phase in both weeks in all regions, illustrating 
an effective meditation course design (Fig. 6). From that result forward, 
we  look  into  the  signal  complexity  using  Fractal  Dimension  Analysis, 
and the Fractal Dimension increased significantly after the meditation 
phase compared to the previous phase in week 6 (Fig. 7). While there 
was no significant change in week four when comparing the podcast and 
meditation state, we can see a significant difference in FD after the week 
four meditation phase compared to the week six meditation phase. To 
affirm our results in FD, we investigate coherence as a metric for brain 
connectivity, which illustrates a strong local connection in the frontal 
area (Fig. 8). While there were some limits due to the electrode place-
ment, the results gave us some insightful information. In conclusion, the 
study  shows  us  the  effect  of  mindfulness  in  enhancing  physiological 
properties linked with cognitive function and rewiring the connection 
between different brain areas.
