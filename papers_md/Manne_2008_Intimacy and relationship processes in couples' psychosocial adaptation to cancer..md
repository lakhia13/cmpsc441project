Abstract

The authors highlighted the importance of viewing cancer from a relationship perspective. This 
perspective not only considers the marital relationship as a resource that individual partners draw 
upon but also highlights the importance of focusing attention onto the relationship and engaging in 
communication behaviors aimed at sustaining and/or enhancing the relationship during stressful 
times. On the basis of existing conceptualizations, empiric research on couples and cancer, and the 
authors’ perspective on the literature, they formulated the relationship intimacy model of couples’ 
psychosocial adaptation to cancer as a first step toward building a framework for researchers and 
clinicians to inform their work in this area. The model proposes that patients and their partners 
engage in behaviors that either promote or undermine the level of closeness in their relationship 
and that the closeness of the marital relationship is an important determinant of patient and partner 
psychologic adaptation to cancer. Preliminary data from a couples’ intimacy-enhancing 
intervention for breast cancer patients and their partners supported the model. Of the 25 couples 
who consented to participate in the intervention and completed the preintervention surveys, 15 
couples completed all 5 sessions, and 12 couples completed the follow-up survey. The current 
results suggested that the intervention improved patient and partner perceptions of the closeness of 
their relationship and reduced their distress. The authors also discuss limitations of the relationship 
intimacy model as well as future directions for empiric and clinical research on couples’ 
psychosocial adaptation to cancer.

The diagnosis and treatment of cancer can be stressful and upsetting. Patients deal with 
several challenges, including the emotional consequences of being diagnosed with a life-
threatening illness1–3; medical treatments with sometimes debilitating side effects, such as 
nausea and vomiting, pain, urinary incontinence, fatigue, bodily disfigurement, sexual 
dysfunction, neuropathies, difficulties breathing, eating, and/or swallowing4–11; and

existential and spiritual concerns.12,13 However, the diagnosis of cancer in a member of the 
family can have significant repercussions for the entire family. Partners in particular cope 
with challenges, such as worry about the potential loss of their life partner and their ability 
to provide emotional and practical support to the patient.14 In addition to these emotional 
concerns, experiences throughout the cancer continuum can result in several practical issues 
that both patient and partner must cope with together. For example, in the months after a 
new diagnosis, these stressors include negotiating changes in occupational and family roles, 
interference with future life plans, and managing household and childcare 
responsibilities.15–18 For couples dealing with advanced disease, cancer causes additional 
life stresses, such as declining functional abilities that bring about the necessity for couples 
to discuss how care and assistance with daily activities will be provided to the ill 
partner.19,20 Couples also typically negotiate difficult choices regarding end-of-life 
treatments and care, cope with anticipatory grief regarding the loss of one’s partner, manage 
child and family reactions, and talk about the ill partner’s legacy in psychologic and 
practical matters.21,22 For couples who enter the survivorship phase, the primary challenge 
is negotiating the transition to “normal” life.23 For most of these couples, the main tasks 
include resuming a sexual relationship, discussing changes in life plans, discussing health 
behavior changes, dealing with disease and treatment-related late effects that may influence 
the patient’s functioning, managing worry about disease recurrence, and discussing the 
meaning of the cancer experience for themselves and the relationship.24–31 One common 
challenge couples encounter is that each partner may have a different “pace” with regard to 
their desire to return to normal life.23 In summary, regardless of the stage along the cancer 
continuum, cancer can pose unique challenges for the marital relationship. Thus, from a 
couples’ perspective, successful adaptation may not be as dependent on the circumstances of 
the illness but rather on how well the couple integrates cancer into their lives.

In writing this article, we sought to advance an understanding of the role of the marital 
relationship in cancer adaptation first by describing different approaches to understanding 
cancer in the marital context and then by reviewing some of the major theoretical 
frameworks that have guided an understanding of the role of relationship processes in 
couples’ psychosocial adaptation. Next, we integrated the different perspectives into a new 
model that we believe can serve as an initial framework for future work on couples’ 
psychosocial adaptation to cancer. In this report, we also describe preliminary results from a 
couple-focused, intimacy-enhancing intervention for patients with early-stage breast cancer 
and their partners that provides initial empiric support for this new model, and we discuss 
strengths and weaknesses of the model as well as directions for future research.

Approaches to Understanding Cancer in the Marital Context

Traditional approaches to understanding the psychosocial impact of cancer have sought to 
describe the level of distress experienced by the patient.2,3 However, over the last 20 years, 
researchers and clinicians working in oncology have recognized the importance of viewing 
cancer in the family context. This realization has lead to a burgeoning literature assessing 
and comparing patient and partner distress levels3,31–42 as well as sex differences in 
distress.43–47 With a few exceptions,32 these studies suggest that patients report higher 
levels of clinically relevant distress than partners3 and that women who are patients and

partners report higher levels of distress than men who are patients and partners.43 Recent 
reviews have suggested that the difference in distress levels between patients and partners 
can be accounted for by sex differences in the reporting of psychologic distress rather than 
role differences.46 One exception may be partners of patients with end-stage disease who are 
providing home care; among these partners, evidence suggests that partners of both sexes 
may have higher levels of distress than patients.20

A second focus of this literature has been to study the psychologic impact of caregiving on 
spouses. The primary focus of these studies has been on quantifying caregiving demands47 
and identifying correlates of caregiver burden.48 For a review of this literature, please see 
the article by Kim and Given in this supplemental issue of Cancer.49

A third focus has been to evaluate the impact of cancer on the general quality of the 
marriage. Although clinical lore suggests that partners, particularly partners who are men, 
may be more likely to abandon their marriage during and after cancer, there is no evidence 
to support this contention. In fact, studies indicate that marital satisfaction after diagnosis is 
not significantly different from population norms,50–52 and recent work suggests that nearly 
half of women with breast cancer and their husbands report that cancer brought them closer 
together.53

Previous work on couples dealing with cancer has been important in that it has quantified 
the psychologic impact of cancer both on partners and on marital quality. What we believe 
has been missing largely from this literature is the adoption of a couple-level perspective 
whereby the cancer experience is viewed in relational terms. Implicit in this couple-level 
perspective is that the illness is something that happens to the couple and that the focus on 
patient and partner separately may not be as beneficial from a theoretical and clinical 
perspective as a focus on the relationship. Another important assumption is the belief that 
the marital relationship is a resource for partners to draw from during difficult times but that 
it is equally important to study the ongoing contributions that partners make to preserve and 
improve relationship quality. Partners in satisfying relationships are aware of the important 
functions of their relationship, make purposeful efforts to maintain it during difficult times, 
and are open to finding opportunities to improve it. From this perspective, cancer can serve 
as an opportunity for couples to forge a more intimate bond. Viewing cancer as an 
opportunity for enhancing the couple’s relationship, as opposed to a challenge for individual 
partners, entails a refocusing of scholarship and attention onto the interactions between 
partners and how these interactions affect the couple’s sense of closeness and adaptation to 
cancer. From this perspective, relationship processes, or the ties that bind patients and 
partners together as they cope with cancer, are key. We believe that identifying and targeting 
key relationship processes can facilitate the design of efficacious, couple-focused 
interventions aimed at improving psychosocial adaptation to cancer for both members of the 
couple. To this end, we reviewed some of the major theoretic frameworks that have guided 
an understanding of the role of relationship processes in couples’ psychosocial adaptation to 
cancer.

Theoretic Frameworks for Studying Relationship Processes and Empiric 

Support

Traditional perspectives

Traditionally, there have been distinct bodies of literature examining couples’ psychosocial 
adaptation to cancer. The divide is caused primarily by the differentiation between the social 
psychology literature, which emphasizes underlying psychologic and relationship processes, 
and the clinical psychology literature, which emphasizes evaluating psychologic 
interventions. The disconnect between these literatures in the area of relationship support 
processes among couples coping with cancer is unfortunate, because there is considerable 
overlap in component relationship processes, and much can be learned from integrating this 
knowledge base. From a theoretical perspective, identifying broad theoretical constructs to 
include in an overarching model of relationship processes will inform programmatic 
research. From a clinical perspective, this information can facilitate the design and testing of 
effective, couple-focused interventions. In the section below, we have provided an overview 
of some of the major theories that have guided research on couples and cancer. These 
theories are summarized in Table 1, which also provides illustrative empiric work adopting 
each theory. That overview is followed by a description of our new integrative relationship-
level model of couples’ adaptation to cancer.

Resource theories

Theories such as cognitive-social processing theory, social support theories, and equity 
theory adopt the view that the marital relationship is a resource for individuals to draw on 
for assistance during difficult life events. Most of these theories draw from family systems 
theory and communication theory, which originate from seminal early work conducted by 
Jackson54,55 and by Jackson and Weakland56 on communication theory and work by 
Haley57,58 and by Spiegel59 on family systems theory.

Cognitive-social processing theory—Cognitive-social processing theory emanates 
from the vast literature on the effects of the social context on individuals’ psychologic 
adaptation after a traumatic or stressful event.60,61 According to this perspective, successful 
cognitive processing involves actively assimilating or accommodating a stressful experience 
into an individual’s “world view,” which typically involves finding some meaning or 
purpose in it.62,63 Although some processing is done on an individual level, the social 
network can aid or interfere with effective processing.64 Talking with others may facilitate 
successful processing by allowing the disclosure of emotions, helping the individual learn to 
tolerate aversive feelings, providing support for adaptive coping, and providing direct 
assistance in finding meaning and benefit in the experience, as discussed by Tait and 
Silver.65 Conversely, not being able to talk about a difficult experience because an 
individual perceives their family or friends as critical, unreceptive, or uncomfortable with 
the topic may place individuals at higher risk for adverse psychologic reactions. On the basis 
of this theory, the spouse can serve as a resource for the patient in terms of providing 
assistance in cognitive processing. The spouse also can serve as a barrier to effective 
processing if he or she is either unavailable or unsupportive. Barriers to sharing the cancer

experience with a spouse may be particularly problematic because of the level of importance 
the spouse has as both a confidante and primary source of support.66

To our knowledge, few studies to date have adopted the cognitive-social processing theory 
perspective to examine how couples deal with cancer. In our previous work, we evaluated 
the role of spouse unsupportive responses in how patients cognitively process cancer. We 
observed that unsupportive spouse responses moderate the association between intrusive 
thoughts and distress67 and that avoidance mediates the association between spouse 
unsupportive responses and psychologic distress.68

In summary, cognitive-social processing theory views the marital relationship as an 
important resource in adaptive cognitive processing on the part of the individual with the 
disease. Key constructs are disclosure, processing, and how others facilitate an individual’s 
processing of an event. However, it is important to note that this theory adopts an individual-
level conceptualization of the role of the marital relationship, because the focus is on 
individual partner distress, and there is little attention given to couples’ interaction.

Social support theories—By far the most common relationship process studied in the 
cancer context is the provision of social support from partner to patient. Traditionally, social 
support has been viewed as a personal resource, and the theoretical conceptualization 
guiding this work has been either stress and coping theory69 or stress-buffering theory.70 
Stress and coping theory has viewed support provided by others as 1 method individuals use 
to deal with a stressful life event. Most theories of how coping works suggest that the 
practical and emotional support that individuals receive from others facilitates adaptive 
coping.71 Similarly, stress-buffering theory proposes that social support protects against the 
deleterious effects of negative life events on health and well being.70,72 Although social 
support provided by an individual’s partner is considered an important determinant of a 
satisfactory marriage,73–75 to our knowledge only a small number of studies in the social 
support literature have focused on the role of social support in the marital relationship.76–78

The majority of studies evaluating the role of emotional and practical support provided by 
the partner have reported that higher levels of spousal support are associated with lower 
levels of distress as reported by the cancer patient.79–82 However, Bolger et al.78 observed 
that reported changes in partner support were not related to reductions in distress among 
women with early-stage breast cancer. The role of the provision of support from the 
individual with cancer to the healthy partner has been studied less. Limited research has 
suggested that husbands of women with early-stage breast cancer believe their needs are 
attended to less.83

When evaluating the role of social support, it is important to consider that all interactions 
between couples are supportive. Some behaviors that are intended as supportive on the part 
of the healthy partner are not perceived as such by patients.84–86 Examples are attempts to 
avoid discussing concerns or topics that may cause the patient distress (typically labeled 
“protective buffering”) and giving advice when the patient was not asking for advice. Cross-
sectional67 and longitudinal studies87,88 indicate that attempts to avoid discussing concerns 
or topics are associated with increased distress for both partners. There also is evidence that

responses that are perceived as overtly critical (eg, criticizing how the partner is coping) are 
associated with patient distress.67

In summary, social support theories view marriage as a resource for individuals with cancer. 
This literature has been successful in identifying behaviors engaged in by others that are 
perceived as either supportive or unsupportive. This viewpoint is similar to the cognitive-
social processing theory perspective, because it adopts an individual-level conceptualization 
of the role of the marital relationship.

Equity theory—Equity theory has conceptual overlap with social support theories. Some 
researchers have argued that, for support to have beneficial effects, it must be reciprocal.89 
However, in the context of cancer, relationships may be affected by changes in the balance 
of give and take between partners.90,91 Whereas support may have flowed back and forth 
between partners before the onset of illness, the exchange may become more unidirectional, 
with the healthy spouse’s contributions to the relationship far exceeding those of the patient.

According to equity theory, when the ratio of contributions to rewards for 1 partner differs 
from that of the other, the relationship is out of balance; individuals in inequitable 
relationships are more likely to become distressed,92 regardless of whether they are 
overbenefited or underbenefited.93–95 Kuijer et al.96 compared couples coping with cancer 
with healthy couples and observed that cancer patients felt more overbenefited and 
experienced more guilt about being overbenefited than healthy individuals.97 Among 
patients, the perception of not giving enough to the partner also was related to depressive 
symptoms.98 Although the majority of partners of cancer patients reported feeling that they 
were treated as equitably as healthy individuals reported, those who reported feeling 
underbenefited had greater depressive symptoms98 and greater relationship distress.96

In summary, equity theory adopts an individual-level perspective on the role of the marital 
relationship by focusing on individual psychologic adaptation. However, a key advantage of 
this theory is that it acknowledges the exchange of support between partners and the value 
that partners place on the level of equity in their support-related exchanges.

Dyadic level theories

Whereas resource theories focus on the individual as the unit of study and conceptualize the 
relationship as a source of support for partners to draw on, dyadic-level theories focus on the 
couple as the unit of study and examine the ongoing contributions that both make to 
preserve or improve the quality of their relationship as they strive to cope together with the 
cancer experience. Below, we consider the dyadic-level models that have been influential in 
shaping research on couples coping with cancer.

Relationship resilience models—Marital resilience refers to the strategies partners 
engage in to strengthen and/or maintain their relationship and promote adaptation to life 
challenges.99 Stafford and Canary100 identified 5 such strategies: 1) positivity or interacting 
with one’s partner in a cheerful and optimistic manner; 2) openness, which refers to 
discussing and disclosing information about the relationship with one’s partner; 3) 
assurances, which are statements of commitment and love; 4) social networks, which entail

relying on or interacting with common relatives/friends; and, 5) shared tasks, which involves 
engaging in everyday activities together. These strategies promote positive feelings and 
commitment to the relationship99 and prevent the relationship from decaying.101,102 Theory 
and research suggest that these strategies help promote resilience.99 By applying this 
framework to how couples cope with cancer, Badr and Carmack Taylor103 reported that 
couples’ efforts to maintain or enhance their relationship when 1 partner was recently 
diagnosed with lung cancer affected their psychologic and marital adjustment over time.

A construct related to relationship maintenance is relationship awareness, which is defined 
as the focusing of attention on the relationship.104 Relationship awareness consists of 2 key 
components: viewing oneself as part of a couple105 and talking with one’s partner about the 
relationship.106 Greater relationship awareness is associated with higher levels of happiness, 
commitment, and love between married couples107 as well as the psychologic adjustment of 
individual partners.108 For example, it has been demonstrated that seeing oneself as part of a 
couple facilitates a couples’ level of cooperation109 and minimizes the negative effects of a 
chronic illness on spouse mental health.108 Badr et al.110 recently demonstrated that couples 
who reported engaging in more frequent discussions about their relationship within 1 month 
of the patient’s initiation of treatment for lung cancer had greater marital adjustment and less 
psychologic distress up to 6 months later. Such discussions include talking about 
relationship memories, plans for the future, and problem solving about cancer-related issues 
that have impacted the relationship.111

In summary, relationship resilience models propose that viewing the cancer as a stressor that 
affects both partners and making efforts to maintain and/or enhance the relationship may 
play an important role in couples’ psychologic and marital adaptation. Thus, understanding 
the behaviors that help couples maintain and enhance the quality of their relationship is 
important.

Interpersonal process model of intimacy and intimacy theory—Intimacy is 
considered a primary psychologic need112 and is a widely studied construct in social and 
clinical psychology. Recent conceptualizations of intimacy have included components such 
as attentive listening and the conveyance of understanding.113 Nearly all conceptualizations 
focus on the role of disclosure. Indeed, the degree to which patients disclose concerns has 
been a focus of several recent studies in the psycho-oncology literature.114,115

We have adopted the conceptualization of intimacy described by Reis and Shaver116 that has 
been labeled the interpersonal process model of intimacy. In this model, intimacy is defined 
as a process whereby an individual expresses important self-relevant feelings and 
information to another and, as a result of the other’s response, comes to believe that they are 
understood, validated, and cared for.116,117 This conceptualization is unique both because 
interactions are the basis for intimacy and because intimacy is defined in interactive terms. 
This model emphasizes 2 key components in intimate interactions: self-disclosure and 
partner responsiveness.116,117 Self-disclosure is the communication of personally relevant 
and revealing information to another individual and can contain facts, thoughts, or feelings 
as well as nonverbal communication. The listener then responds by disclosing personally 
relevant facts, thoughts, or feelings. The process then proceeds to the perceptions and

appraisals by the speaker regarding what the listener has said. For the interaction to be 
intimate, the speaker needs to interpret the listener’s statements as responsive. That is, the 
speaker needs to perceive that the listener has understood the content of the individual’s 
disclosure and, thus, believes that they are accepted and cared for. Laurenceau et al.118 
expanded the interpersonal process model of intimacy to include perceived partner 
disclosure as well as self-disclosure. According to this model, both self-disclosures and 
partner disclosures contribute to the development of intimacy through the degree to which 
the speaker believes that their partner is responsive.

We evaluated this model in a study of women diagnosed with breast cancer who were in 
active treatment and their partners. Couples participated in 2 discussions and then rated 
perceived self-disclosure, partner disclosure, partner responsiveness, and intimacy 
experienced during the discussion.119 When the partner’s perspective was evaluated, our 
findings were consistent with the interpersonal process model of intimacy. However, when 
the patient’s perspective was evaluated, the findings were only partially supportive of the 
Interpersonal Process Model. Patient self-disclosure did not predict patients’ feelings of 
intimacy over and above perceptions of partners’ responsiveness. Rather, partner disclosure 
was a more important determinant of perceived closeness than patient disclosure. Although 
these findings suggest that patient self-disclosure may not play a strong role in relationship 
closeness, our observational work suggests that partners’ responses—particularly partner’s 
reciprocal self-disclosures—play a role in patients’ distress.119

Behavioral marital theory—We include behavioral marital theory because it is a 
hallmark of the vast majority of couple-focused interventions in the marital literature and 
has guided some of our recent approaches to understanding relationship processes in cancer. 
Behavioral models evaluate how relational partners influence one another. Behavior 
exchange approaches attempt to increase the ratio of positive to negative behaviors 
exchanged by partners.120 Behavioral exchange, improving adaptive communication, 
conflict resolution, and problem-solving skills are considered important processes of 
relationship functioning and satisfaction and, as such, are targeted in behavioral approaches 
to marital therapy.121,122 These skills are brought by couples to each of their interactions, 
and both partners influence and are influenced by these interactions.123

In terms of marital interaction, Christensen and Shenk,124 used a 1984 communication 
patterns questionnaire from the University of California-Los Angeles to identify 3 patterns. 
They defined pressure-withdraw as a maladaptive interaction pattern in which 1 or both 
partners pressure the other to discuss a problem, and the other partner withdraws. 
Traditionally, the woman in the couple is the pursuer, and the man is the withdrawer.125 The 
pressure-withdraw interaction dynamic is associated with marital dissatisfaction.124 Mutual 
avoidance of discussing problems is a second dynamic that is predictive of marital 
dissatisfaction.124 Finally, mutual constructive communication, which involves mutual 
engagement in discussing a problem and attempting to find a solution, is associated with 
greater marital satisfaction.124

Behavioral marital theory has not been used widely in the study of cancer patients and their 
partners. In a study of women with early-stage breast cancer and their spouses, we evaluated

the role of the communication patterns described by Christensen and Shenk in couples’ 
distress and marital satisfaction.126 Our findings suggested that less pressure-withdraw 
communication, less mutual avoidance, and greater mutual constructive communication of 
cancer-related problems were associated with less distress and greater marital satisfaction on 
the part of both partners.

Summary

Each of the theoretical perspectives outlined above has contributed new thoughts and a 
greater understanding of the role of relationship processes in couples’ psychosocial 
adaptation to cancer. For example, resource theories illuminate the importance of the marital 
relationship as a source of support for both partners to draw on during the cancer experience, 
describe partner supportive and unsupportive responses, and capture the importance of 
equitable support exchanges. However, they do not view marriage as a relationship in which 
partners invest and draw from, they do not treat the couple and their interaction as the unit of 
study, and they do not view cancer in relationship terms. The strength of dyadic-level 
theories is that they conceptualize the couple as a unit and treat cancer as a relationship 
issue. Specifically, relationship resilience models emphasize the importance of partners’ 
focus on the relationship as an attempt to maintain and/or enhance relationship quality. 
These theories also suggest that openness to relationship enhancement during difficult 
experiences may be important. The interpersonal process model of intimacy, which also is a 
dyadic-level model, highlights the importance of reciprocal self-disclosure, responsiveness, 
and intimacy. Its primary strength is the focus on specific interactions and how the other 
partner responds. However, it does not describe dysfunctional processes or other beneficial 
behaviors, and psychologic adaptation is not included in the model. Thus, the main gap in 
dyadic-level theories is that they do not fully capture and interrelate key elements and 
outcomes of relationship processes. Finally, behavioral marital theories emphasize 
interaction patterns and the role of acceptance and commitment in relationship satisfaction. 
However, they do not focus on intimacy processes.

The Relationship Intimacy Model of Couple Psychosocial Adaptation to 

Cancer

Although the review described above demonstrates a growing body of literature examining 
not only the psychosocial adjustment of cancer patients and their partners but also the role of 
relationship processes in partners’ coping and adjustment, to date, there is no well 
articulated, integrative theoretical framework for such research. We propose that more could 
be achieved from both a theoretical perspective and a clinical perspective by adopting a 
meta-analytic, dyadic-level approach to understanding marriage after cancer. We believe 
that this can be achieved by focusing on intimacy as a primary mechanism for promoting 
couples’ adaptation and by integrating key relationship processes that contribute to intimacy 
into an overarching, heuristic model. We propose the relationship intimacy model of 
couples’ psychosocial adaptation to cancer, which is an overarching, heuristic model that we 
believe can help begin to organize the conceptualization of the marital relationship after 
cancer, because it integrates key component relationship processes and outcomes (see Fig. 
1). We focus on component relationship processes that contribute to intimacy in 2

categories: “relationship-enhancing” and “relationship-compromising” behaviors. We have 
selected 3 relationship-enhancing processes to include in the integrative model. The first is 
disclosure of concerns and feelings regarding the cancer experience (reciprocal self-
disclosure). Self-disclosure is a component of social support theory, the interpersonal 
process model of intimacy, cognitive-social processing theory, and the relationship 
resilience models. The second process is partner responsiveness, which is defined as feeling 
understood, cared for, and accepted by one’s partner. Responsiveness is a component of 
social support theory, the interpersonal process model of intimacy, and the relationship 
resilience models. The third process is relationship engagement, which is an overarching 
term that we define as viewing cancer in relational terms (ie, viewing cancer as having 
implications for the relationship as well as for each partner individually) and engaging in 
behaviors that are aimed at either sustaining or enhancing the relationship while coping with 
cancer. Relationship engagement is characterized by 1) an awareness of the challenges 
cancer poses to the couples’ relationship and an openness to discussing these changes with 
one’s partner, 2) a willingness to address aspects of the relationship that either have changed 
or need to change after cancer (ie, relationship priorities and roles), and 3) efforts to 
maintain components of the relationship that are important to either partner during the 
illness (eg, treating one another as spouses rather than adopting caregiver-patient roles). 
Relationship engagement combines elements of the relationship resilience models (eg, 
relationship awareness and maintenance), which our research suggests are relevant in the 
cancer context.

We have categorized relationship-compromising behaviors, which consistently have been 
associated with reduced marital quality and/or psychologic distress into 3 broad categories: 
avoidance, criticism, and pressure-withdraw. Avoidant responses are more subtle insensitive 
behaviors, such as conveying discomfort when a partner is attempting to talk about the 
illness, as well as well intentioned efforts to hide worries, deny concerns, and yield to one’s 
partner to avoid disagreement and reduce the other partner’s upset and/or burden.88 Critical 
behaviors are intentionally unsupportive reactions, such as the spouse criticizing how the 
patient is coping with cancer,64 and a less commonly studied response, which is the patient 
criticizing how the partner is coping with cancer.111 Finally, pressure-withdraw occurs when 
a partner pressures the other to discuss a cancer-related problem and the other partner 
withdraws.126 Relationship-compromising behaviors can be viewed as including 
components of social support, social-cognitive processing, and behavioral marital theories.

We chose relationship intimacy as the primary way that relationship-enhancing and 
relationship-compromising behaviors exert their effect on couples’ adaptation. We realize 
that there may be individual-level variables, such as how couples cope with the illness, 
which also may be affected by engaging in either relationship-enhancing or relationship-
compromising behaviors; however, this model focuses primarily on the role of the 
relationship in couple adaptation. There are many ways to define relationship intimacy. We 
adopt a situation-specific approach whereby intimacy is the experience of feeling close to 
and cared for by a partner with regard to the cancer experience. We distinguish intimacy 
from attachment, which we view as a set of expectations about oneself and others that 
develop in the context of early childhood experiences that influence how individuals

interpret interpersonal experiences. Research has demonstrated that the attachment can 
influence how couples establish intimacy (eg, the degree of disclosure and perceptions of 
responsiveness) (Schaeffer & Laurenceau, unpublished observations). Although attachment 
may be amenable to change and can influence intimacy, it is viewed primarily as a 
dispositional characteristic,127 whereas intimacy is viewed as amenable to change.118

The primary outcome in our model is couple-level psychologic and marital adaptation. We 
include marital adaptation along with distress in our conceptualization of couples’ 
adaptation because a dyadic perspective is carried into all aspects of the relationship 
intimacy model.

Couple-focused Interventions Using the Relationship Intimacy Model

There have been several recently published couple-focused interventions for individuals 
with cancer.22,128 None have focused on enhancing intimacy or have targeted all of the key 
elements of our integrative model. We recently developed and pilot tested an Intimacy-
Enhancing Couples’ Therapy (IECT) for women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer 
and their partners.129 The relationship intimacy model was used to guide the development of 
IECT. This intervention targets relationship-enhancing behaviors by enhancing reciprocal 
disclosure and responsiveness, assisting couples in viewing the illness in relationship terms, 
enhancing relationship maintenance activities, and encouraging the couple to consider 
changes in the priorities in their relationship both precancer and postcancer. Relationship-
compromising behaviors also are addressed through structured training and practice in 
adaptive communication skills with therapist feedback. IECT consists of 5 weekly 1-hour 
sessions with the individual couple and a therapist. The intervention is manualized with in-
session practice, handouts, and home assignments.

To provide preliminary feasibility and efficacy data, we conducted a small, nonrandomized 
trial with 16 women who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and their partners. 
On average, patients were aged 53 years (standard deviation [SD], 10.2 years; range, 32–69 
years), and partners were aged 54 years (SD, 10.2 years; range, 32–69 years). The majority 
of partners were men (92%). Most patients (48%) and partners (44%) had completed 
college. The majority of patients (80%) and partners (80%) were Caucasian. The median 
household income was $75,000 (range, $26,000–$188,000). Among married couples (N = 
13), the average relationship length was 21 years (SD, 13.8 years; range, 2–50 years). 
Among nonmarried, cohabiting couples (N = 3), the average relationship length was 13.3 
years (SD, 5 years; range, 8–18 years). Approximately 8% of patients were diagnosed with 
ductal carcinoma in situ, 88% were diagnosed with stage I or II breast cancer, and 4% were 
diagnosed with stage IIIA breast cancer. The average time since original cancer diagnosis 
was 6.5 months (SD, 4.4 months; range, 1–12 months). Patients had undergone breast-
conserving surgery (68%) or modified radical mastectomy (32%). Approximately 96% of 
patients had an “asymptomatic” rating on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status subscale.130 Primary study outcomes were general psychologic distress 
(38-item Mental Health Inventory)131 and cancer-specific distress (Impact of Events Scale 
[IES]).132 Measures of relationship-enhancement processes included perceived partner 
disclosure,119 partner responsiveness,119 partner criticism and avoidance,68 cancer-specific

relationship intimacy,119 and general relationship intimacy (the Personal Assessment of 
Intimacy in Relationships inventory).133 Measures were administered to both partners 
preintervention and 1 week postintervention.

Of the 16 couples who completed preintervention surveys, 14 completed all 5 sessions and 
the follow-up survey (88%). Preintervention and postintervention means and SDs are shown 
in Table 2. Pretest and posttest comparisons of patient and partner psychologic outcomes 
indicated that IECT significantly reduced patient psychologic distress (F1,14 = 7.56; P <.05) 
and significantly increased patient-perceived partner responsiveness (F1,14 = 7.87; P <.05) 
and patient cancer-specific closeness (F1,14 = 6.65; P <.05). Marginally significant 
reductions in patient IES intrusions (F1,14 = 4.09; P =.06) and marginally significant 
increases in general relationship closeness (F1,14 = 3.44; P =.08) also were noted.

Our preliminary data suggest that IECT has promise as a couple-focused intervention in that 
it increased relationship-enhancement behaviors, reduced relationship-compromising 
behaviors, increased relationship intimacy, and reduced couples’ distress. However, it 
should be noted that this was not a controlled clinical trial, and we did not assess other 
constructs in the relationship intimacy model, such as relationship maintenance behaviors, 
relationship awareness, patient criticism of the partner, patient avoidance of the partner, and 
pressure-withdraw behaviors.

Directions for Future Research

We divide our discussion of future directions into methodological issues, future empiric and 
clinical challenges, and limitations of our model. First, it is important that future research 
studying couples’ adaptation to cancer not only include both partners but also make sure that 
the couple is the unit of analysis throughout the research process. This dyadic perspective 
should be reflected when conceptualizing the research question, choosing a study design, 
selecting methodology and measures, and by using dyadic-level statistical approaches to 
analyze and interpret the data.134–136 Second, it will be important to use multimethod 
approaches to measure marital processes by including observational137 and daily diary 
methods138 that can capture the interactional nature of these processes. Measures of some 
relationship-enhancement behaviors, such as relationship awareness, need to be developed 
and validated for the cancer context. Definitions of marital distress in cancer also may need 
to be refined. The effects of cancer on what are primarily long-term, stable relationships 
may be more gradual and may erode different components of marital quality (eg, sexuality, 
efforts at relationship maintenance).

It will be important for investigators to study couples dealing with different types and stages 
of cancer so that the effects of illness status (eg, patient vs partner) can be disentangled from 
the effects of sex. The study of couples dealing with different types of cancer also may 
illuminate the differences in relationship issues. For example, sexual problems and/or the 
pressure-withdraw dynamic as barriers to relationship intimacy may be more important for 
couples coping with prostate cancer. Social isolation and blame for substance use may be a 
more common intimacy barrier for couples dealing with head and neck cancers, and partner 
criticism for smoking may be a key relationship issue and barrier to intimacy among couples

dealing with lung cancer. Finally, although previous research provides initial support for 
components of the relationship intimacy model, the examination of proposed linkages using 
model-building statistical approaches such as structural equation modeling is needed.

From a clinical perspective, it will be important to develop couple-focused psychologic 
interventions for couples dealing with cancers other than early-stage breast cancer. These 
interventions should target specific issues for each population and adopt a relationship focus 
rather than using the partner as an “assistant” by addressing the relationship and the needs of 
both partners. More research also is needed to determine appropriate timing of couple-
focused interventions. Whereas the best timing for working with couples may be at the time 
of diagnosis, the transition to survivorship also may be an appropriate time for couple-
focused interventions. It also will be important to decide the degree to which couple-focused 
interventions can be adapted from efficacious marital interventions for nonphysically ill 
couples. Finally, it will be important to examine mechanisms for therapeutic change and to 
identify subgroups of couples who may benefit more from intervention approaches.

It is important to recognize that the relationship intimacy model proposed here is a first step 
in building an integrative framework for understanding how relationship factors influence 
psychosocial adaptation to cancer. This model has not yet incorporated several medical, 
relationship, and individual-level factors that we realize may impact both component 
processes and outcomes. For example, physical disability experienced by the partner clearly 
impacts relationship-enhancing and relationship-compromising behaviors.67 
Sociodemographic variables, such as age, education, and culture, also may be important. For 
example, couples at different stages of the life cycle (childrearing, postretirement) may 
experience very different types of relationship stressors as a function of a cancer diagnosis 
and treatment and, thus, have different expectations regarding not only social support but 
also interaction with their partners. Likewise, cultural variables may affect the definition, 
salience, and importance of intimacy as a key mediating variable in couples’ psychosocial 
adaptation to cancer. There are important differences between Western conceptualizations of 
disclosure and closeness and the viewpoints of other cultures,139,140 and these differences 
also may have relevance for the applicability of our model to other cultures. For example, a 
recent cross-cultural study demonstrated that Asian-American breast cancer survivors valued 
family harmony over intimacy, whereas Euro-American women valued intimacy over 
harmony.141 Preillness marital intimacy, commitment, and satisfaction may influence both 
partners’ motivations to use cancer as an opportunity to enhance their relationship. 
Individual factors such as attachment style (Schaeffer & Laurenceau, unpublished 
observations), personality, and interpersonal skills that partners bring to this situation also 
may influence relationship processes, as discussed above. For example, couples in which 
both partners have an insecure attachment style may experience more problems when it 
comes to disclosing feelings and/or responding appropriately to a partner’s disclosures. 
Thus, these couples may need to work harder to enhance intimacy, which may be 
particularly important at the end of life.

In addition to influencing feelings of closeness, relationship-enhancing and relationship-
compromising behaviors also may influence the coping strategies that patients and partners 
use.88 It is also important to note that this model ultimately will need to account for

reciprocal relations between variables. For example, partners may influence one another’s 
distress,142 and this distress may influence relationship-enhancing and relationship-
compromising behaviors. Despite these limitations, we believe that intimacy is the most 
important component of a couple’s relationship and that this initial framework can be used 
to build a more comprehensive framework to guide further theory development, research, 
and clinical approaches to understanding the marital relationship and cancer.

Conclusions

In this article, we have expressed the importance of viewing cancer from a relationship 
perspective. This perspective not only considers the marital relationship as a resource that 
individual partners draw on but also highlights the importance of focusing attention onto the 
relationship and engaging in communication behaviors aimed as sustaining and/or 
enhancing the relationship during stressful times. On the basis of existing conceptualizations 
and empiric research on couples and cancer, we have formulated the relationship intimacy 
model as a first step in building a framework for researchers and clinicians to inform their 
work in this area.

There are several innovations represented by this model. Most noteworthy, it emphasizes the 
importance of partners relating to each other as spouses rather than as “patient” and 
“caregiver.” Second, the model emphasizes the importance of partners’ efforts to both 
maintain a level of stability in their relationship and enhance their relationship. Third, as 
noted above, the model combines social and clinical psychology literatures. Finally, our 
view that cancer can pose a relationship opportunity is novel. We believe that partners can 
draw on the intimate connection between them as a source of strength and support while 
forging a closer emotional bond, which, in turn, may open the door not only for relationship 
growth but also to promote psychologic adaptation and healing.

Summary of Key Theoretical Approaches to Studying Cancer and the Marital Relationship

TABLE 1

Theory

Brief description

Key constructs

Resource theories

Cognitive social 
processing theory

The partner/relationship is viewed primarily as a resource 
for the patient

Talking with the spouse can facilitate cognitive and 
emotional processing; members of the social network can 
constrain disclosure by being critical or unsupportive

Social support theories (eg, 
stress and coping theory; 
stress-buffering theory

Members of the social network can provide practical and 
emotional assistance to facilitate adaptive coping and 
protect against the deleterious effects of negative life 
events on health and well being

Disclosure, cognitive 
and emotional 
processing, social 
constraints

Supportive vs 
unsupportive behaviors

Representative 
studies in the 
oncology literature

Equity theory

Dyadic-level theories

Relationship resilience 
models (eg, relationship 
maintenance; relationship 
awareness)

Interpersonal process 
model of intimacy

When the ratio of contributions to rewards for one partner 
differs from that of the other, the relationship is out of 
balance, and the individual is more likely to experience 
distress

Over-benefit, under-
benefit, exchange of 
social support between 
relational partners

The couple is viewed as a unit, and cancer is viewed as a 
relationship issue; maintaining relationship equilibrium 
and being open to relationship enhancement during 
difficult times are important

Focusing greater attention onto the relationship by 
incorporating the relationship into one’s self-concept, 
viewing cancer as a ‘we’ disease, talking with a partner 
specifically about the relationship, or engaging in other 
communication behaviors aimed at maintaining or 
enhancing the relationship is associated with greater 
psychological and marital adjustment

Relationship 
maintenance strategies, 
couple identity, 
relationship talk

Badr & Carmack 
Taylor in press103; 
Badr 2007108; Badr 
2008110

For an interaction to be perceived as intimate, the speaker 
needs to interpret the listener’s statements as being 
responsive (eg, the speaker needs to perceive that the 
listener has understood the content of the individual’s 
disclosure and, thus, feels accepted and cared for)

Reciprocal self-
disclosure and 
perceived partner 
responsiveness

Manne 2004119; 
Manne 2004137

Manne 2006126; Badr 
2008110

Behavioral marital theories 
(eg, behavioral exchange)

Applying behavioral principles, such as reinforcement and 
punishment, to marital exchanges; the ratio of positive to 
negative behaviors determines marital satisfaction; 
believes that marital dissatisfaction is caused primarily by 
poor communication, which can be strengthened

Communication 
patterns (mutual-
constructive 
communication, mutual 
avoidance, pressure-
withdraw), conflict 
resolution, problem-
solving skills
