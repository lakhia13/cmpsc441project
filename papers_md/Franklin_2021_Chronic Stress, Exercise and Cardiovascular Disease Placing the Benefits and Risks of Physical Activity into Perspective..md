Abstract: Chronic stress, which has been exacerbated worldwide by the lingering COVID pandemic,
has been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition, autonomic dysregulation
via sustained sympathetic activity has been shown to increase the risk of arrhythmias, platelet
aggregation, acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. Fortunately, effective coping strategies
have been shown to attenuate the magnitude of hyperarousal associated with the stress response,
including moderate-to-vigorous lifestyle activity and/or structured exercise. A good-to-excellent
level of cardiorespiratory ﬁtness also appears to be highly cardioprotective. These beneﬁcial effects
have been substantiated by numerous studies that have evaluated the levels of stress reactivity and
stress recovery in physically active individuals versus matched sedentary controls, as well as before
and after exercise interventions. On the other hand, unaccustomed strenuous exercise in habitually
sedentary persons with underlying CVD is associated with a disproportionate incidence of acute
cardiac events. Moreover, extreme exercise regimens appear to increase coronary calciﬁcation and
the likelihood of developing atrial ﬁbrillation. This review summarizes these relations and more,
with speciﬁc reference to placing the beneﬁts and risks of physical activity into perspective.

1. Introduction

Psychosocial stress encompasses various stressors that can be categorized into three
general groups: major life stress (e.g., occupational, relationship, caregiving, death of a
loved one), socioeconomic factors (e.g., low income, discrimination, crime), and chronic
psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety). Numerous studies over the last several
decades have demonstrated that psychosocial stress adversely affects many organ systems
in the body [1–5]; however, particularly concerning is its effect on cardiovascular disease
(CVD) and mortality. The landmark INTERHEART study demonstrated that psychosocial
factors carry an odds ratio for myocardial infarction similar to that of “traditional” risk
factors [6]. Their effect on other CVDs appears similar.

1.1. Major Life Stress

High levels of work or occupational stress have been convincingly linked to a greater
risk for hypertension and cardiovascular mortality [7,8]. One model that correlates with
coronary disease as well as psychological symptoms describes the variables at play which
contribute to “job strain,” speciﬁcally the levels of demand and control [9]. Jobs with high
demands and low control are associated with elevated blood pressure at home, work,
and during sleep. Chronic hypertension is known to cause pathologic remodeling and is

substantiated by a connection between job stress and left ventricular mass [9,10], perhaps
providing a barometer for the chronicity and magnitude of hypertension elicited. Marital
or relationship stress is likely of greater signiﬁcance in relation to cardiovascular risk given
its inherent nature in peoples’ lives. Several studies have reported that marital strife is
associated with the development and/or progression of atherosclerotic CVD as well as
cardiovascular mortality with a comparable risk to that of cigarette smoking or physical
inactivity [11–13]. Others have linked marital stress in women directly with coronary
atherosclerosis determined by angiographic studies rather than merely cardiovascular risk
factors [14]. Similarly, caregiving stress appears to have a heightened effect on the risk
of CVD in women. The Nurses’ Health Study showed that caregiving (>8 h/week) for a
disabled or ill spouse was associated with an increased relative risk (1.82) of coronary heart
disease [15]. Interestingly, the ﬁndings did not show the same effect when caregiving for a
disabled or ill parent.

1.2. Socioeconomic Factors

Although socioeconomic status (SES), including factors such as ﬁnancial hardship,
housing conditions, employment, and education, is a reported mediator of cardiovascular
risk [16–19], it is difﬁcult to characterize and quantify, because it is strongly associated with
other potential confounders such as chronic life stress [20] and depression [21]. Education
is considered the strongest risk predictor of the many dimensions of SES [22] and the easiest
to measure. The Northern Manhattan Study evaluated the relation of SES and race with
left ventricular mass, noting that low SES (deﬁned by education level) is an independent
predictor of increased left ventricular mass among hypertensive and normotensive blacks,
but not in whites or Hispanics [23]. More controversial is the potential link between
racial discrimination and CVD with studies showing mixed results [24–27]. Nevertheless,
favorably modifying certain socioeconomic factors can decrease cardiac risk with one study
showing that alleviating ﬁnancial stress was associated with reduced ambulatory blood
pressures [28].

1.3. Psychiatric Conditions

Superimposed depressive disorders, ranging from mild or subclinical depressive
symptoms to classic major depression, are associated with a heightened risk of coronary
events in patients with and without coronary artery disease [29]. Moreover, in post-
myocardial infarction patients, there is a relation between the severity of depression and
survival [30]. Accordingly, major depression highly correlates with subsequent cardiac
events [31]. Similar to depression, anxiety is also considered a strong predictor of acute
cardiac events in patients with stable coronary disease [32]. More commonly associated
with chronic psychosocial stress, post-traumatic stress disorder increases the risk of CVD
independent of familial history and documented psychiatric comorbidities [33–36]. More
severe psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia carry a nearly two-fold higher risk of
cardiovascular mortality than in the general population [37]. The reasons for the increased
mortality may also be partially attributed to potential confounders, including the high
rate of cigarette smoking and obesity in patients with schizophrenia [38–40]. Addition-
ally, the antipsychotic drugs commonly prescribed for schizophrenia and other psychotic
diseases are associated with signiﬁcant weight gain and the development of diabetes and
dyslipidemia [41,42].

Although chronic psychosocial stress appears to represent a strong risk factor for
CVD, the underlying mechanisms require clariﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, while some stress
disorders likely promote unhealthy lifestyle habits, escalating data suggest that chronic
stress can independently lead to increased rates of CVD and mortality through varied
pathophysiologic mechanisms.

1.4. Pathophysiology

Stressors, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, can adversely impact homeostasis. The
key pathways responsible are the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the
autonomic nervous system. These systems, along with other centers in the central nervous
system, constitute complex psycho–neural–immuno–endocrine–adrenal pathways that
interact with tissue and organ systems to respond to stressors. Chronic stress can cause
dysregulation of these systems, disrupting homeostasis and leading to a spectrum of
detrimental clinical manifestations involving the cardiovascular system [43,44].

Stress mediated activation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus causes secre-
tion of corticotropin-releasing factor. This causes secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone
from the anterior pituitary gland. In response, cortisol is released into the bloodstream
from the adrenal cortex. Negative feedback of cortisol on the hypothalamus and anterior
pituitary maintains control of the axis. Chronic stress leads to an imbalance in this regula-
tion through a cumulative increase in basal cortisol levels via the HPA axis [45]. Clinical
studies have reported that this imbalance can lead to atherosclerotic plaque formation,
hypertension, insulin resistance, central adiposity, or combinations thereof [46].

The autonomic nervous system, comprised of a network of neurons in the brainstem,
spinal cord and heart primarily modulates heart rate, myocardial contractility and vascular
tone via direct neural connections and circulating catecholamines. It has two balancing
systems, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic ner-
vous system is particularly utilized during physical exertion and stress (increased heart
rate, myocardial contractility, vascular tone). The parasympathetic system is active under
conditions of rest and counteracts the sympathetic response [47]. Chronic stress causes
autonomic dysregulation via sustained sympathetic activity and/or reduced parasympa-
thetic activity [48]. This shift has been shown to increase the risk of arrhythmias, platelet
aggregation, acute coronary syndromes and heart failure [44,49].

2. Impact of Physical Activity/Exercise on the Stress Response

The stress response is a primitive mechanism triggered by a threat, real or perceived,
to one’s well-being and survival. It is characterized by a cascade of protective physiological
and psychological responses that prepare the individual to either combat the threat or
ﬂee from it. The stress response serves the individual well when the threat is temporary.
However, health problems often arise when the threat persists, or if other threats arise
concurrently or in rapid succession, creating a state of chronic stress.

Chronic stress is a risk factor for various physical and mental health conditions, includ-
ing CVD, certain cancers, hypertension, diabetes, sleep disturbances, digestive disorders,
upper respiratory disease, immune suppression, mood swings, anxiety, and depression [50].
Moreover, stress has been linked to an increased incidence of drug overdose and suicide
across all ages, which has contributed to a recent decrease in the average life expectancy of
Americans [51,52].

2.1. Prevalence of Stress Today

Unfortunately, chronic stress has become increasing prevalent throughout the world.
According to the Gallup Global Emotions 2020 Report (conducted pre-COVID-19 pandemic),
over one-third of people worldwide reported experiencing escalating levels of stress [53,54].
More recently, stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases in the
incidence of psychological distress. The ﬁndings presented in the Stress in America 2020
Report compared to the 2019 Annual Stress in America Survey indicated that the average
level of reported stress for U.S. adults was signiﬁcantly higher in 2020 than it was the
previous year (5.4 vs. 4.9 on a scale of 1 [very low] to 10 [very high], respectively) [55,56].
In addition, the average level of stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic was 5.9 on this
scale. Furthermore, there was a 21% increase in the number of anti-depressant, anti-anxiety,
and anti-insomnia medication prescriptions ﬁlled during the initial weeks of the realization
of the pandemic, 16 February–15 March 2020, with 78% of those prescriptions being new,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 9922

according to ﬁndings presented in America’s State of Mind Report [57]. The authors of the
report suggested a correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic.

With stress levels on the rise in response to COVID-19, coping strategies have in-
creasingly become a public health focus. Effective coping strategies can offset the state
of hyperarousal associated with the stress response, whereas suboptimal coping skills
can lead to physical and mental health problems over time, even if they do provide the
individual with some immediate, temporary relief. Key modulators have been described
by the stress bucket analogy (Figure 1) which originated from the pioneering work of
Brabban and Turkington [58].

Figure 1. Stress bucket analogy. Chronic stress ﬂows into the bucket.

2.2. Stress Bucket Analogy

In the stress bucket analogy, the bucket represents an individual’s level of stress
tolerance. The size of the bucket largely depends upon a person’s physiology, personality,
and life experiences. Everyone has a different size bucket, which remains unchanged. The
water level in the bucket represents the sum of all stresses in an individual’s life at that
time. People who have larger buckets can hold more water (i.e., have a greater tolerance
for stress) than those with smaller buckets.

If the bucket overﬂows, health problems often develop, including CVD. To keep
the water in the bucket from overﬂowing, individuals use the coping strategies readily
available to them. Coping strategies act similar to taps in the bucket to drain the water.
Effective taps (e.g., healthy lifestyle choices, such as adequate sleep and regular physical
activity [PA]) decrease the amount of water in the bucket and relieve stress. Faulty taps
(e.g., alcohol and drug abuse) provide temporary relief, but ultimately result in more water
ﬂowing into the individual’s bucket. Physical and mental health problems develop when
the water in the bucket repeatedly overﬂows.

2.3. Coping Methods

Historically, stress management techniques have included meditation, deep breathing
exercise, mental imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and in some cases psychotherapy

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 9922

and/or pharmacologic treatment. In recent years, the role that moderate-to-vigorous PA
plays in stress management has gained increasing attention.

It is well documented that regular PA has a positive impact on general health and
well-being. There is also growing evidence to suggest that both single and cumulative
bouts of PA can elicit signiﬁcant stress reducing effects (Figure 2). Furthermore, some
studies have suggested that a high level of cardiorespiratory ﬁtness (CRF) may favorably
modulate the response to chronic stress [59–63].

Figure 2. Potential stress reducing effects of regular lifestyle physical activity, structured endurance
exercise, or both.

2.4. Physical Activity: Exercise Training and Stress Reduction

One randomized controlled study investigated the physiological response to psy-
chosocial stress in healthy men (n = 96) [59]. Subjects were divided into three study groups:
(1) an intervention group that underwent 12-weeks of endurance training; (2) an attention
control group that underwent a 12-week relaxation program; and (3) a waitlist control
group that received no intervention.

At baseline or study entry, the men did not differ in body mass index, chronic stress,
trait anxiety, activities of daily living, habitual level of PA or level of ﬁtness. The subjects’
endocrine stress response (HPA axis) was determined by measuring salivary free cortisol
and the autonomic stress response was assessed by measuring heart rate and heart rate
variability. The responses were deﬁned by level of stress reactivity (degree of response
to stressor exposure) and stress recovery (how long the variable remained elevated after
stressor cessation).

Results showed that the subjects who underwent 12-weeks of endurance exercise
training had signiﬁcantly reduced stress reactivity to a psychosocial stressor as measured
by cortisol, heart rate, and heart rate variability responses. The subjects who underwent
12-weeks of relaxation technique training demonstrated reductions in cortisol stress re-
activity only and those in the wait list group showed no changes in stress reactivity as
measured by the standardized protocol. Furthermore, only those subjects who underwent
endurance training had signiﬁcant reductions in heart rate reactivity and improvements in
heart rate recovery (i.e., how long the heart rate remained elevated after cessation of the
psychosocial stressor).

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 9922

It should be noted, however, that reductions in cortisol stress reactivity were not
signiﬁcantly different between the endurance training and relaxation training groups.
However, only the endurance training group experienced signiﬁcant reductions in cor-
tisol stress reactivity compared to the wait list control group, whereas the difference in
cortisol stress reactivity between the relaxation training and wait list control groups only
approached signiﬁcance.

Although exercise levels increased signiﬁcantly for both the endurance exercise train-
ing and relaxation technique training groups, only those subjects in the exercise group
demonstrated signiﬁcant improvements in CRF. The researchers concluded that there is a
causal relationship between PA and the physiological response to stress, with endurance
exercise training resulting in reductions in reactivity to a standardized psychosocial stressor
as measured by cortisol, heart rate and heart rate variability responses.

It has been suggested that regular PA has a protective effect against stress. Rimmele
et al. [60] investigated the endocrine and autonomic responses to a psychosocial stressor
among 22 elite sportsmen as compared with 22 healthy untrained men. The subjects’
salivary free cortisol levels, heart rate and psychological responses as deﬁned by mood,
calmness and anxiety were measured before and after the stressor (Trier Social Stress Test).
The elite sportsmen demonstrated lower cortisol and heart rate responses (main effect of
group (F(1,39) = 5.47, p < 0.05 and (F(1,37) = 7.27, p < 0.05, respectively), better mood (group
by time interaction effect F(1,39) = 5.80, p < 0.05), greater calmness (main effect of group
(F(1,39) = 16.45, p < 0.1), and lower state anxiety (F(1,38) = 15.55, p <0.001) compared with
the untrained men. There were no signiﬁcant differences in cortisol levels, heart rate, or
mood at baseline between the two groups. The elite sportsmen demonstrated signiﬁcantly
higher levels of calmness and trended towards lower levels of state anxiety at baseline. It
was concluded that regular PA may offer a protective effect against stress and its related
disorders (anxiety) [60].

Another study assessed the effects of varied PA interventions on the psychological
well-being of 147 adolescents [61]. Subjects were assigned to one of four groups: (1) high-
intensity aerobic training; (2) moderate-intensity aerobic training; (3) ﬂexibility training;
and (4) a control group. All subjects completed baseline and follow-up assessments of
stress, well-being, and exercise tolerance. These assessments, along with measurements of
the subjects’ ﬁtness levels and heart rate and blood pressure responses, were obtained at
the beginning and end of the 10-week investigation.

Greater levels of PA were associated with lower levels of stress and depression based
on analysis of the subjects’ self-reports. Adolescents assigned to the high-intensity aerobic
training group reported experiencing signiﬁcantly less stress compared with subjects
in the other three groups. In addition, only those subjects in the high-intensity aerobic
training group reported reduced levels of stress and anxiety, depression, and hostility at
the end of the investigation, whereas subjects in the other groups trended in the opposite
direction. The researchers concluded that high-intensity exercise is an effective intervention
to enhance adolescent well-being.

Other investigators have reported that mild-to-moderate intensity exercise can also
provide protective effects against stress. Rogers et al., [62] found that exercise at 40–50%
maximal oxygen uptake resulted in reductions in resting blood pressure and an attenuated
blood pressure response to stress in borderline hypertensive individuals.

2.5. Physical Activity: Acute Exercise and Stress Reduction

Evidence also suggests that even single bouts of PA can be used to transiently mitigate
the effects of stressful situations. Wunsch et al., [63] evaluated the effects of both habitual
and acute exercise on the responses to psychosocial stress as measured by endocrine
and autonomic stress response system biomarkers, speciﬁcally free salivary cortisol and
alpha amylase. Subjects included 84 males, aged 18–30 years, half of whom were habitual
exercisers whereas the remaining participants were generally inactive at baseline. The men
were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an acute exercise intervention group who

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 9922

7 of 17

engaged in 30 min of moderate-to-high-intensity cycle ergometer exercise and a control
group who participated in 30 min of light stretching exercise. Both groups were exposed to
a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups) before and after the intervention.
Samples of each subject’s saliva were obtained to assess free salivary cortisol and alpha
amylase levels. It was concluded that both habitual and acute forms of exercise can have a
favorable impact on modifying the response to a standardized psychosocial stressor

2.6. Exercise Prescription to Reduce Stress

Research-based deﬁnitive guidelines for prescribing exercise to reduce chronic stress
are currently unavailable. Various factors may play a role in determining the impact
that regular PA has on the stress response, such as the training intensity, level of CRF,
co-morbidities/medical history, magnitude of life stress, and the individual’s exercise pref-
erences. Nevertheless, the general consensus is that the total volume of bodily movement
or simply being physically active throughout the day plays a greater role in protection
than any one exercise parameter (i.e., frequency, intensity, duration, and mode) [52]. There-
fore, following the American College of Sports Medicine’s guidelines of engaging in 150
min/week of moderate-intensity PA, or 75 min/week of vigorous PA, or combinations
thereof, should provide sufﬁcient levels of exercise to promote overall physical and mental
health, including stress reducing effects.

3. Exercise/Physical Activity: A Double-Edged Sword

Exercise training, as a subcategory of PA, is deﬁned as any structured intervention
with the objective of increasing or maintaining CRF or health, enhancing athletic per-
formance, or both. Peak oxygen consumption or CRF can be directly measured during
cardiopulmary exercise testing or estimated from the attained treadmill or cycle ergometer
workload, adjusted for duration. Although considerable epidemiologic evidence suggests
that regular moderate-to-vigorous PA may help to reduce chronic stress and protect against
the development of atherosclerotic CVD, exertion-related acute cardiac events have been
reported in the medical literature [64] as well as the lay press [65], suggesting that vigorous
PA (≥6 metabolic equivalents [METs]; 1 MET = 3.5 mL/kg/min) may trigger cardiac arrest
or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in persons with known or occult CVD [66]. Several
triggering mechanisms for plaque rupture and acute coronary thrombosis (Table 1) [67]
and threatening ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 3) have been suggested [68].

Table 1. Potential triggering mechanisms of acute myocardial infarction by strenuous physical
exertion.

Induces plaque rupture via:
• Increased heart rate, blood pressure, and shear forces
• Altered coronary artery dimensions
• Exercise-induced spasm in partially obstructed artery segments
Renders a ﬁssured plaque more thrombogenic by:
• Deepening the ﬁssure
• Increasing thrombogenicity
Induces thrombogenesis directly via:
• Catecholamine-induced platelet aggregation

Structural cardiovascular abnormalities, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM), are the major causes of exertion-related sudden cardiac death (SCD) in younger
athletes [69]. In contrast, atherosclerotic CVD is the most common autopsy ﬁnding in
middle-aged and older adults [70]. In a landmark study from the Cleveland Clinic, investi-
gators estimated that ~85% of individuals in the U.S. ≥ 50 years of age have subclinical
evidence of coronary artery disease [71]. Thus, it is the combination of vigorous PA and
atherosclerotic or structural heart disease, rather than the exercise per se, that seems to
present the trigger for cardiac events associated with strenuous physical exertion.

Figure 3. Physiologic alterations accompanying acute exercise training and recovery and their possible sequelae. CHD,
coronary heart disease; HR, heart rate; SBP, systolic blood pressure; MVO2, myocardial oxygen consumption.

The relative risk (RR) for acute cardiac events during or immediately after mild-to-
moderate intensity exercise is similar to that expected by chance alone. In persons with
known or occult CVD, high-volume, high-intensity training regimens or competition seem
to be associated with a heightened incidence of acute cardiovascular events [72]. The abso-
lute risks of exercise-related cardiovascular events in apparently healthy adults are 1 per
1,124,200 and 1 per 887,526 person-hours for nonfatal and fatal events, respectively [73].
Thus, strenuous bouts of PA, particularly when unaccustomed, may transiently increase
the risk of cardiovascular complications; however, the absolute risk associated with each
exercise session remains extremely low.

Although AMI and SCD can be triggered by vigorous PA, the risk decreases with
increasing frequencies (days/week) of vigorous PA. The RR seems to be highest for inactive
individuals with known or occult CVD who were performing unaccustomed vigorous PA.
For example, in the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study [74], the risk of
AMI was 5.9 times higher within 1 h of periods of vigorous-to-high-intensity PA compared
with periods of lower levels of activity or rest. The RR of AMI was highest among those
who exercised < 1 time a week (RR, 107) compared with those who exercised ≥ 5 times per
week (RR, 2.4) (Figure 4) [75]. Accordingly, just 1–2 vigorous exercise sessions per week
reduced the risk for exertion-related AMI by nearly 80%.

To put these data in perspective, consider the individual who participates in vigorous
1-h sessions of exercise ≥5 days per week. Using data from the Onset study [74], the risk
of AMI during or soon after vigorous physical exertion is approximately doubled for this
individual. Furthermore, regular exercise has been reported to reduce the long-term risk
of cardiovascular events by up to 50% [76,77]. Thus, during the 1-h period of vigorous
exercise, the individual’s risk will double and reach the level that it would have been at all
times for his or her sedentary counterparts. However, during the remaining 23 h of the day,
his or her risk would be ≤50% lower. Thus, there is a clear net beneﬁt to regular exercise
despite the modest transient increased risk of exercise-induced AMI [78].

Figure 4. The relative risk for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is presented at rest (baseline) and during vigorous
activity (days/week). No regular vigorous physical activity elevates the risk of an isolated, unaccustomed bout of vigorous
exercise by ≥100-fold. Performing one to two days of weekly vigorous physical activity markedly lowers AMI risk during
vigorous physical exertion. More frequent performance of vigorous physical activity further lowers exercise related AMI
risk, although the relationship is not linear [74,75]. Vigorous exercise is delineated by the asterisks (*). Reprinted with
permission from the American Heart Association.

4. Common Activities Associated with Acute Cardiac Events

Physical activities involving sudden bursts or high levels of anaerobic metabolism
may transiently increase the risk for exercise-related acute cardiac events. These include
downhill skiing [79], racquet sports [80], high-intensity interval training [81], and competi-
tive sports activities (e.g., basketball) [82] as compared with other more moderate activities.
Neural and psychologic stimuli secondary to competition may simultaneously increase
sympathetic activity and catecholamine levels and lower the threshold for threatening
ventricular arrhythmias [83]. Other recreational and domestic activities associated with
increased cardiac demands and a greater incidence of cardiovascular events include deer
hunting [84] and snow removal [85,86], as well as a marathon running [87] and triathlon
participation [88].

Marathon running. The RACER study (Race Associated Cardiac Event Registry)
evaluated the incidence and outcomes of cardiac arrest associated with marathon and
half-marathon races in the U.S. over a 10.5-year period. The study population included
10.9 million registered runners (mean ± SD age, 42 ± 13 years) [87]. Of the 59 cases of
cardiac arrest, 42 (71%) were fatal. The incidence rate was 3.75 times higher during full-
marathons versus half-marathons and 5.6 times higher among men than women. Nearly
half of all SCDs occurred during the ﬁnal mile. The overall risk of a cardiac event during
marathons and half-marathons was relatively low, versus other competitive endurance
activities. Autopsy ﬁndings revealed that HCM and atherosclerotic CVD were the most
common underlying anomalies.

Triathlon participation. The frequency of cardiac arrest and SCD has also been reported
in > 9 million triathlon participants, 1985 to 2016 [88]. There were 135 SCDs, or 1.74 per
100,000 participants, which exceeded the incidence rate previously reported for marathon
running (1.01 per 100,000 participants) [87]. The incidence of cardiovascular events was

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 9922

10 of 17

also 3.5-fold less in women than men. Most SCDs occurred during the swim segment (67%),
whereas the remaining fatalities occurred during bicycling, running, and postrace recovery
segments, respectively. Race experience was available for 68 participants, of whom 26
(38%) were competing in their ﬁrst triathlon. Autopsies were performed on 61 victims, 27
(44%) of whom had either atherosclerotic coronary disease or cardiomyopathy.

In aggregate, these data suggest that cardiac arrest and SCD during marathon run-
ning and triathlon participation occasionally occur and that clinicians evaluating race
participants should be aware of the heightened risks of HCM and atherosclerotic coro-
nary disease in this patient population [89], both of which can often be detected with
appropriate medical screening. An increased risk among “ﬁrst-time” triathlon participants
suggests inadequate preparation or poor training as potential contributors to some of the
exertion-related fatalities [88]. Finally, participants should also be advised to heed warning
symptoms and to avoid sprinting during the concluding minutes of the race, when cardio-
vascular events are most prevalent [90]. Symptomatic athletes should be strongly counseled
to stop training and competing until medical assessment and clearance are obtained.

5. High-Volume, High-Intensity Endurance Training: Too Much of a Good Thing?

Among individuals who participate in high-volume, high-intensity endurance training
regimens, use of cardioprotective medications are lower than among their less physically
active counterparts [91]. These data, coupled with reports documenting the impressive risk
factor proﬁles and superb cardiac performance of marathon runners, as well as the anti-
aging effects that regular endurance exercise provides [92], have led an increasing number
of health enthusiasts to embrace the notion that “more exercise is invariably better [93].”
Long-term conventional endurance or isotonic exercise training alters cardiac structure
and function, and such adaptations are believed to be benign. These include: enlargement
of all cardiac chambers; improvement in ventricular compliance and distensibility; and,
electrical remodeling, such as sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, and ﬁrst-degree atri-
oventricular block. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that over time, high-volume,
high-intensity, exercise training regimens can induce cardiac maladaptations such as an
increased incidence of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) and accelerated coronary artery calciﬁcation
(CAC) [89]. Accordingly, there is debate whether intensive exercise can be harmful to the
heart, especially in some individuals.

5.1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF)

Numerous epidemiologic and observational studies have reported a statistically sig-
niﬁcant association between chronic high-volume, high-intensity aerobic exercise training
and a heightened risk of developing AF [89]. One analysis found that the risk of AF was 2-
to 10-fold higher in endurance athletes than in matched controls [94]. Moreover, long-term
vigorous endurance exercise (i.e., ≥2000 h of endurance training or ≥20 years of train-
ing) was strongly associated with an increased risk for lone AF [95,96]. Potential factors
triggering AF in previously healthy long-term endurance exercisers include ventricular
hypertrophy, which may cause some degree of diastolic dysfunction and increased left
atrial stretch, enlargement or ﬁbrosis, systemic inﬂammation, and increased vagal tone,
potentially shortening the atrial refractory period (Figure 5) [89]. Fortunately, much of
the risk for AF seems to resolve with detraining and/or reducing the exercise volume or
intensity, probably in part because of the normalization of autonomic tone [97].

5.2. Accelerated Coronary Artery Calciﬁcation (CAC)

Several investigators have reported that veteran endurance athletes have a higher
prevalence of elevated CAC scores when compared with age, gender, and risk factor
matched control groups from the general population [98–100]. However, these athletes also
demonstrate greater levels of CRF, expressed as METs, coronary artery size, and dilating
capacity, as well as predominantly stable calciﬁed plaques and fewer vulnerable mixed
plaques than their less-active counterparts [99,100]. These concomitant adaptations appear
to offset the negative impact of a higher CAC [89]. A landmark 8.4-year follow-up study
of 8425 men from the Cooper Center Longitudinal study revealed that after adjusting
for CAC level, each additional 1 MET increment in CRF conferred an 11% lower risk
for subsequent cardiovascular events [101]. Collectively, these data suggest that the risk
for adverse cardiovascular events is lower in physically active people than their inactive
counterparts with the same CAC score. These results also provide reassurance that highly
active individuals with CAC can safely continue their exercise programs, provided that
they remain asymptomatic.

6. Prevention of Triggered Cardiac Events

There is now considerable evidence that acute cardiovascular events can be triggered
by varied physical, chemical, and psychological stressors, including strenuous physical
exertion [78]. The underlying mechanisms may involve biomechanical, prothrombotic,
and arrhythmogenic stimuli, largely mediated by the associated heightened output of the
sympathetic nervous system.

Fortunately, regular exercise, stress management, quitting smoking, and favorably
modifying other coronary risk factors may attenuate the response to and protect against
trigger-induced coronary events [102]. The beneﬁcial role of regular moderate-to-vigorous
exercise may be due to multiple mechanisms, including cardiovascular, neurologic and
biochemical adaptations, as well as psychologic effects (Figure 6). Concomitant favor-
able autonomic adaptations include increases in heart rate variability, a strong prognostic
indicator that is inversely related to mortality [103]. In addition, exercise precondition-
ing provides immediate cardioprotective beneﬁts against AMI, by conferring transient
antiarrhythmic and anti-ischemic effects against ischemic injury [104,105]. The impact of
even brief bouts of PA that achieve a minimum threshold of ≥50% of functional capacity
appear to provide the stimulus for improved clinical outcomes following acute cardiac
events [105].

Prophylactic Use of Cardioprotective Medications before Strenuous Exercise

Although some have suggested that recreational athletes with known or suspected
CVD may beneﬁt from taking aspirin or β-blockers shortly before competitive exercise,
there are no deﬁnitive data indicating that these agents (despite their proven effectiveness
for secondary prevention) decrease exercise-related acute cardiac events [89,106]. Accord-
ingly, related reports [74,87] and the INTERHEART study [107] suggest there is insufﬁcient
evidence to recommend the prophylactic use of these medications before strenuous PA or
competitive sports participation.

In summary, although there are varied potential strategies to reduce the risk of trig-
gered acute cardiac events, we believe that increased lifestyle PA, structured exercise,
or both, should be included in stress reduction interventions [78], due to the associated
autonomic adaptations and parasympathetic predominance [108]. This strategy is readily
accessible, beneﬁcial for both physical and mental health, and provides up to eight-year
gains in life expectancy in the most physically active population cohorts [109].

7. Clinical Recommendations

Previously sedentary patients with and without CVD should be encouraged to par-
ticipate in gradually progressive exercise regimens. Because the least active, least ﬁt
individuals are at greatest risk for exercise-related acute cardiac events, they should follow
a gradual increase in exercise intensity and avoid vigorous exercise (≥60% functional capac-
ity or ≥6 METs), at least over the initial six to eight weeks. To promote and maintain health,
moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) PA (40–59% functional capacity or 3.0–5.9 METs)
for a minimum of 30 min on ﬁve days each week, or vigorous intensity aerobic PA for a
minimum of 20 min on three days each week, is recommended [110]. Patients with CVD
seeking to greatly increase their PA intensity or volume should be evaluated and advised
in accordance with contemporary guidelines [111].

8. Conclusions

The effects of chronic stress and varied stressors (i.e., physical, chemical, psychologic)
in the development of CVD and triggering of acute cardiac events are well documented.
Regular moderate-to-vigorous PA, structured exercise, and higher levels of CRF appear to
be therapeutic in combatting the deleterious impact of chronic stress and other risk factors
that are the forerunners of CVD. On the other hand, studies suggest that unaccustomed
vigorous-to-high intensity physical exertion can trigger acute cardiovascular events, espe-
cially in habitually sedentary individuals with known or occult CVD. It is also reported

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 9922

that in some individuals, high-volume, high-intensity exercise regimens can, over time,
lead to maladaptations, including increased coronary calciﬁcation and the development of
AF, as described by a reverse J-shaped curve. Although exercise is widely acknowledged
for its salutary effects, increasing data suggest that “it may be possible to get too much of a
good thing.”
