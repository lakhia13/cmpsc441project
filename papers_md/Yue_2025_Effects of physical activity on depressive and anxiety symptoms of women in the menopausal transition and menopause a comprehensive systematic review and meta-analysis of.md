Abstract
Background  Depression and anxiety may significantly affect women in the menopausal transition and menopause. 
In addition to traditional treatment strategies such as hormone therapy, antidepressants, and psychotherapy, physical 
activity (PA) have been increasingly studied, but there is no consensus about their role in menopausal women with 
depression and anxiety.

Objective  The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of PA on the severity of depressive (DS) and anxiety (AS) 
symptoms in women during the menopausal transition and menopause.

Methods  We searched for relevant published studies in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and 
CINAHL prior to 8 April 2024, focusing on randomized controlled trials documenting the effect of physical activity on 
DS and AS, and assessed study quality using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.

Results  The data used for meta-analysis were derived from 21 studies (DS, n = 9; AS, n = 1; DS and AS combined, 
n = 11) involving 2020 participants. The results showed that PA groups demonstrated a statistically significant effect 
of depressive symptoms versus controls (DS [SMD: -0.66, 95% CI: -0.99 to -0.33; P < 0.001]; AS [SMD: -0.55, 95% CI: 
-0.82 to -0.27; P < 0.001]). As subgroup analyses demonstrated, physical exercise also reduced depressive symptom of 
women in menopausal status (SMD =-0.56, 95% CI: −0.96 to − 0.17, p = 0.006, I2 = 69%), postmenopausal status (SMD 
=-0.94, 95% CI: −1.46 to − 0.42, p = 0.0004, I2 = 94%), and both in menopausal transition and postmenopausal status 
(SMD =-0.30, 95% CI: −0.49 to − 0.12, p = 0.001, I2 = 0%), while it only reduced anxiety symptom of postmenopausal 
women (SMD =-0.96, 95% CI: −1.49 to − 0.43, p = 0.0004, I2 = 89%). Low-intensity and moderate-intensity exercise both

produced increasingly benefits over depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, there is no statistically significant 
effect of exercise intensity on both depressive symptom and anxiety symptom.

Conclusion  Physical activities with low to moderate intensity can impart remarkable improvements for managing 
menopausal women with depression and anxiety.

Keywords  Physical activity, Depression, Anxiety, Menopause, Meta-analysis

Introduction
Women  undergo  a  range  of  physical  and  psychologi-
cal  changes  during  menopausal  transition,  encompass-
ing  vasomotor  symptoms,  mood  disturbances,  sleep 
problems,  genitourinary  problems,  and  other  troubling 
illnesses  that  reduce  the  quality  of  life  [1,  2].  Evidence 
suggests  that  women  are  at  high  risk  of  experiencing 
depression  or  anxiety  during  the  menopausal  transi-
tion,  attributed  to  varying  endogenous  estrogen  levels 
[3–5].  In  menopausal  women,  the  likelihood  of  expe-
riencing  anxiety  and  depression  stands  at  12.62%  and 
25.99%, potentially tripling the pre-menopausal levels [6]. 
Researches indicate that women undergoing menopausal 
transition are linked to significantly worse quality of life 
and increased losses in work productivity and healthcare 
resources [7, 8]. Consequently, there is a vigorous pursuit 
of  scientific  and  effective  strategies  to  alleviate  depres-
sive and anxiety symptoms of women in the Menopausal 
Transition.

Physical  activity  (PA)  is  defined  as  any  bodily  move-
ment  produced  by  skeletal  muscles  that  requires  expen-
diture  of  energy  greater  than  resting  levels.  Physical 
activity results in a range of health benefits on health and 
well  being,  decreasing  the  risk  for  coronary  artery  dis-
ease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and osteo-
porosisa  [9].  Some  clinical  and  epidemiological  studies 
have verified the significant impact of physical activity in 
treating  mental  health  conditions,  especially  depression 
and  anxiety  [10–12].  Besides,  studies  consistently  noted 
a  significant  and  beneficial  effect  of  physical  activity  on 
mental health in menopausal women [13–15]. A longitu-
dinal  observational  research  indicates  a  reduced  proba-
bility of enduring significant depressive symptoms over a 
decade in women who exercise at moderate intensity reg-
ularly [16]. Concerning the mode of exercise, it has been 
demonstrated that aerobic exercise enhances depression, 
insomnia  among  menopausal  wome  [17].  Six  months  of 
aerobic  exercise,  in  contrast  to  inactive  women,  aid  in 
reducing  common  menopausal  symptoms  such  as  night 
sweats, mood fluctuations, and irritability [18].

In  the  last  decade,  there  has  been  a  noticeable  rise  in 
the  quantity  of  published  PA  intervention  trials  among 
menopausal  women.  The  small  number  of  studies  con-
tributing  to  the  pooled  analyses  and  degree  of  hetero-
geneity  among  the  included  studies  results  in  limited 
information  and  overall  strength  of  previous  review 

findings  about  effect  of  PA  on  depressive  or  anxiety 
among menopausal women. To date, there has been few 
systematical  review  of  all  types  of  PA  on  both  depres-
sive  and  anxiety  outcomes  among  menopausal  women. 
This  study  aimed  to  systematically  review  and  analyze 
the  overall  findings  regarding  the  efficacy  of  all  types  of 
physical  activity  for  alleviating  depressive  and  anxiety 
symptoms  of  women  during  the  menopausal  transition 
and explored the differences between varied menopause 
status and physical activity intensity.

Materials and methods
Literature information sources and search strategy

The  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews 
and  Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  [19]  was  rigorously 
adhered  to  in  this  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis. 
The  study  was  registered  in  the  international  prospec-
tive  register  of  systematic  reviews  (PROSPERO)  (ID: 
CRD42024531437).  Two  researchers  (HYY  and  FFX) 
independently  searched  and  reviewed  for  relevant  arti-
cles published up to 8 April 2024, which were all cited in 
five  electronic  database:  PubMed,  Embase,  Web  of  Sci-
ence, Cochrane Library and Cumulative Index of Nursing 
and  Allied  Health  Literature  (CINAHL).  Te  full  search 
strategy  is  documented  in  the  Supplementary  file  1  and 
consisted  of  three  modules  in  the  search  term:  physical 
activity, menopause and mood disorder.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The  inclusion  criteria  were  as  follows:  (1)  Studies  pre-
sented  available  original  data;  (2)  Human  research;  (3) 
Randomized  controlled  trials;  (4)  Articles  with  popula-
tions  in  perimenopause,  menopause,  postmenopause, 
or  climacteric  depressive  (DS)  and  anxiety  (AS)  symp-
toms;  (5)  Articles  with  interventions  including  aerobic, 
resistance,  walking,  water  exercise,  rotational  vibration 
training,  tai  chi,  circuit  training,  interval,  or  combined 
training  with  reporting  parameters  such  as  frequency, 
intensity, type and time.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Animal stud-
ies;  (2)  Articles  classified  as  book  chapters,  conference 
abstracts,  case  reports,  case  series,  letters,  comments, 
interviews,  and  uncontrolled  clinical  trials;  (3)  Articles 
with  populations  experiencing  menopausal  symptoms 
due  to  other  medical  conditions,  or  in  premenopause, 
or  with  other  severe  or  chronic  medical  diseases,  or

psychiatric conditions requiring pharmacologic interven-
tions; (4) Articles with interventions including undefined 
type  of  physical  activity  or  any  non-exercise  interven-
tions  combined  with  physical  activity;  (5)  Articles  were 
unavailable to supply numerical data generated by speci-
fied  tools  or  insufficient  information  for  calculation;  (6) 
Articles presented repetitive data.

Data extraction

Two  researchers  (HYY  and  FFX)  individually  extracted 
data for precision and uniformity. Every study that might 
qualify  underwent  an  independent  assessment  for  the 
complete  text,  considering  both  inclusion  and  exclusion 
standards.  To  prevent  the  duplicate  data  occurred,  lit-
erature that had been replicated was incorporated just a 
single time. When the two researchers disagreed, a con-
clusive agreement was achieved through team discussion 
and the involvement of a third researcher (JHC). Eligible 
randomized controlled trials were all selected from origi-
nal  clinical  researches  and  other  meta-analyses.  Data 
extracted from the selected articles encompassed: title of 
the  article,  author,  year,  study  location,  patients’  charac-
teristics (sample size, mean age, menopausal stage, BMI, 
medical treatment), intervention characteristics (exercise 
protocols,  duration,  intensity,  intervals),  outcome  vari-
ables  (the  rating  scale  used  to  assess  DS  or  AS,  the  pri-
mary endpoint value). We opted to obtain the data from 
the corresponding authors of studies when the  method-
ology was unclear or when data were provided in a form 
unsuitable  for  meta-analysis.  If  a  study  reported  high, 
moderate, and low levels of PA, data about the estimates 
of all levels were collected.

Risk-of-bias assessment

Two  researchers  (HYY  and  FFX)  assessed  the  included 
RCTs for risk of bias using Cochrane risk of bias assess-
ment tool (5.1.0) [20] to assess random sequence genera-
tion  (selection  bias),  allocation  concealment  (selection 
bias),  blinding  of  participants  and  personnel  (perfor-
mance  bias),  blinding  of  outcome  assessment  (detection 
bias),  incomplete  outcome  data  (attrition  bias),  selec-
tive  reporting  (reporting  bias)  and  other  bias.  Disagree-
ments were resolved by consensus discussion or the third 
researcher  (JHC).  The  degrees  of  risk  of  bias  for  each 
included  article  were  assessed  as  “low  risk”  “unclear”  or 
“high  risk”.  The  Review  Manager  software  (RevMan  5.3; 
Cochrane  Collaboration,  Oxford,  UK)  was  used  to  per-
form  the  meta-analysis  and  graphic  production.  Results 
are  presented  in  risk  of  bias  tables  for  each  included 
study.

Data synthesis and statistical analysis

All  analyses  were  performed  using  RevMan  version  5.3 
under  the  guidance  of  the  corresponding  author  (FY). 

The primary outcome was the mean and standard devia-
tion scores of DS and AS in every research. For each com-
parison  of  DS  and  AS,  we  calculated  the  standardized 
mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The random effect model was applied for pooling analy-
sis, because it generates a more reliable estimate than the 
fixed  effect  analysis  in  cases  of  significant  heterogeneity 
[21, 22]. Hedges’g method adjusted for variances caused 
by incorporating trials that differ in sample sizes. Hetero-
geneity was considered by the authors when the clinical 
and methodological characteristics of the studies in ques-
tion were sufficiently alike for a meta-analysis to produce 
a significant summary. A heterogeneity test was explored 
using  Cochran’s  Q  (Chi2  test)  and  I2  statistics.  I2  value 
indicates  the  degree  of  heterogeneity  among  included 
studies  as  a  result  of  variation  across  studies  instead  of 
sampling  error.  Low,  moderate  and  high  heterogeneity 
were  defined  using  the  I2  tests  and  cutoffs  of  25%,  50% 
and  75%,  respectively  [23].  Testing  for  overall  effect  (Z 
score) was regarded as significant at p<0.05.

In  the  subgroup  analysis,  all  data  included  in  the 
meta-analysis  were  divided  into  subgroups,  according 
to  menopause  status,  physical  activity  intensity  and  PA 
types.  Such  analyses  were  used  to  investigate  reasons  of 
heterogeneity and to offer estimates of treatment effects 
for  clinically  relevant  subgroups  of  patients.  The  results 
revealed  the  between-study  heterogeneity.  Forest  plots 
were used to summarize the meta-analyses in the form of 
SMD, 95% confidence intervals, p-value for test of over-
all  effect,  chi-square  and  I2  test  statistics.  A  sensitivity 
analysis was performed on the main results to determine 
whether  review  conclusions  would  have  varied  had  the 
criteria been limited to studies with minimal bias risk (i.e. 
studies not deemed at high risk of bias in any domain and 
reporting acceptable methods of randomization and allo-
cation concealment).

Results
Study selection and categorization

The systematic review resulted in 2920 records, of which 
1245 duplicates were removed and 1605 articles excluded 
after  evaluating  abstract  and  titles.  From  the  remaining 
70  articles,  we  excluded  49  studies  due  to  the  following 
reasons:  not  eligible  design,  intervention,  or  outcomes. 
In  the  end,  21  studies  were  eligible  and  included  in  the 
quantitative  analyses.  Reasons  for  excluding  studies 
at  each  stage  of  the  literature  screening  are  reported  in 
Fig. 1.

Summary of study characteristics

Twenty-one  studies  were  included  (DS,  n = 9;  AS,  n = 1; 
DS and AS combined, n = 11). The included studies com-
prised  a  total  of  2020  participants  and  21  experimental 
arms  (n = 1990  DS  [20  arms];  1411  AS  [13  arms]).  The

general  characteristics  of  the  studies  are  presented  in 
Tables 1 and 2. Studies were published between 2006 and 
2022 and were conducted in Iran [24], Brazil [25], Spain 
[26–28],  France  [29],  USA  [17,  30–33],  China  [34–38], 
Japan [39, 40], Finland [41], Korea [42], and Turkey [43]. 
Sample  size  for  each  study  ranged  from  30  to  236,  and 
2020  menopausal  women  aged  over  40  years  old  were 
recruited  for  all  included  studies,  including  990  partici-
pants  in  the  experimental  group  and  1030  participants 
in  the  control  group.  According  to  the  modes  of  meno-
pause, there were postmenopause [24–30, 32, 35, 36, 40, 
43],  menopause  [31,  37,  38,  41,  42],  Menopausal  transi-
tion  or  postmenopause  [33,  39],  Late  perimenopause  or 
postmenopause [17] and perimenopause [34]. The inter-
ventions  were  all  based  on  physical  exercise  and  ranged 
in duration from 3 to 52 weeks, with interventions rang-
ing from 70 to 450 min per week. The intensity of PA was 
based on heart rate max, VO2 max, heart rate reserve or 
estimated  metabolic  equivalent  of  task  (METs)  [44,  45]. 
Depressive  symptoms  were  assessed  with  the  BDI  [24, 
25, 29, 31, 35, 43], the BSI [30, 32], the GDS [28, 40], the 
HADS  [26,  27],  SCL-95-R  [42],  the  PHQ  [17,  33],  the 
Kupperman  Scale  [37],  the  WHQ  [41]  and  the  SDS  [34, 
36,  39].  Anxiety  symptoms  were  assessed  with  the  BSI 
[30, 32], the GAD [17, 33], the BAI [25], the HAMA [38], 

the HADS [26, 27] the SCL-95-R [42], the WHQ [41], the 
SAS [36] and the Kupperman Scale [37].

Quality assessment

The  quality  assessment  showed  that  around  67%  of  the 
studies had some concerns or a high risk of bias (Fig. 2). 
Most high risk of bias found in included studies is inad-
equate  allocation  concealment  [26,  29,  35,  37],  inap-
propriate method of blinding [24, 29, 34, 35, 39, 41] and 
incomplete  outcome  data  [24,  25,  27,  34–37,  40,  42] 
(Fig.  3).  Physical  activity  interventions  faced  limitations 
with  blinding  methods  and  participant  retention  affect-
ing attrition and adherence to protocols. Our meta-anal-
yses  revealed  significant  heterogeneity  in  pooled  data, 
due to inconsistent DS and AS assessments and varying 
PA intervention.

Summary of study outcomes
Depressive outcomes

Twenty  existing  studies  [17,  24–37,  39–43]  recruited 
1990  menopausal  women  (975  in  the  experimental 
group  and  1015  in  the  control  group)  to  evaluate  the 
effects  of  depressive  scores  in  menopausal  women.  A 
random-effects model was used with SMD due to differ-
ent evaluation tools. The results showed that PA groups

demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  effect  of  depres-
sive symptoms versus controls (SMD: -0.66, 95%CI: -0.99 
to -0.33; P < 0.001, I2 = 92%; N = 1990; Fig. 4).

Anxiety outcomes

Twelve  studies  [17,  25–27,  30,  32,  33,  36–38,  41,  42] 
recruited  1411  menopausal  women  (677  in  the  experi-
mental  group  and  734  in  the  control  group)  to  evalu-
ate  the  effects  of  anxiety  scores  in  menopausal  women. 
The  results  showed  that  PA  groups  demonstrated  a  sta-
tistically  significant  effect  of  anxiety  symptoms  versus 
controls  (SMD:  -0.55,  95%  CI:  -0.82  to  -0.27;  P < 0.001, 
I2 = 83%; N = 1411; Fig. 5).

Subgroup analyses
Exercise intensity

Exercise intensity was classified as low intensity [24–26, 
33,  38,  39,  42,  43]or  moderate  intensity  [17,  28–32,  35, 
37, 40, 41]. Moderate-intensity exercise reduced depres-
sive  and  anxiety  symptoms  in  comparison  to  controls 
(SMD =-0.76, 95% CI: −1.27 to − 0.25, p = 0.003, I2 = 94%; 
SMD  =-0.23,  95%  CI:  −1.41  to  − 0.06,  p = 0.01,  I2 = 35%; 
Figs.  6  and  7,  respectively).  Low-intensity  exercise  pro-
duced similar benefits over depressive and anxiety symp-
toms  (  SMD  =-0.86,  95%  CI:  −1.27  to  − 0.45,  p < 0.001, 
I2 = 79%;  SMD  =-0.75,  95%  CI:  −1.45  to  − 0.06,  p = 0.03, 
I2 = 89%;  Figs.  6  and  7,  respectively).  However,  there  is 
no  statistically  significant  effect  of  exercise  intensity  on 
both  depressive  symptom  and  anxiety  symptom  (DS: 
Chi2 = 0.09 df = 1, P = 0.77; AS: Chi2 = 2.03 df = 1, P = 0.15; 
Figs. 6 and 7, respectively).

Menopausal state

Menopausal  state  was  classified  as  menopausal  [31,  37, 
38, 41, 42], postmenopausal [24–30, 32, 35, 36, 40, 43] and 
both  of  them  [17,  33,  39].  For  depressive  symptom,  the 
subgroup  analyses  showed  a  statistically  significant  dif-
ference in all three subgroups (Menopausal: SMD =-0.56, 
95%  CI:  −0.96  to  − 0.17,  p = 0.006,  I2 = 69%;  Postmeno-
pausal:  SMD  =-0.94,  95%  CI:  −1.46  to  − 0.42,  p = 0.0004, 
I2 = 94%;  Menopausal  transition  and  postmenopausal: 
SMD  =-0.30,  95%  CI:  −0.49  to  − 0.12,  p = 0.001,  I2 = 0%; 
Fig.  8).  Physical  exercise  also  reduced  anxiety  symptom 
in  postmenopausal  women  (SMD  =-0.96,  95%  CI:  −1.49 
to − 0.43, p = 0.0004, I2 = 89%; Fig. 9). However, no signifi-
cant  intervention  effect  on  anxiety  symptom  was  found 
in  menopausal  women  (SMD  =-0.26,  95%  CI:  −0.60  to 
− 0.07,  p = 0.12,  I2 = 43%;  Fig.  9).  The  subgroup  result 
showed  that  there  was  significant  differences  on  anxi-
ety  symptom  between  menopausal  and  postmenopausal 
women (Chi2 = 4.71, df = 1, P = 0.03; Fig. 9).

Sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity analysis after removing studies with included 
women  over  65  years  old  found  a  similar  result  both  at 
depression  and anxiety outcomes (SMD  =-0.69, 95% CI: 
−1.28  to  − 0.10,  p = 0.02,  I2 = 95%;  SMD  =-0.38,  95%  CI: 
−0.66 to − 0.09, p = 0.009, I2 = 71%, respectively) (Supple-
mentary  file  2,  Figure  S7-S8).  Subsequently,  a  second 
sensitivity  analysis  after  removing  trials  that  included 
women of the control group receiving non-exercise inter-
vention,  such  as  medication  or  stretching,  found  that 
the  effect  of  reducing  depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms 
still remained significant (SMD =-0.74, 95% CI: −1.10 to 
− 0.38,  p < 0.001,  I2 = 92%;  SMD  =-0.49,  95%  CI:  −0.77  to 
− 0.21,  p < 0.001,  I2 = 83%,  respectively)  (Supplementary 
file  2,  Figure  S9-S10).  Lastly,  a  third  sensitivity  analysis 
evaluated the effect of the assessment tools for measuring 
depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms.  When  only  including 
studies using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were 
considered, the results remained consistent (SMD =-1.51; 
95% CI: −2.43, − 0.59; p = 0.001; I2 = 94%) (Supplementary 
file 2, Figure S11).

Publication bias

The funnel plot served as a tool to assess the presence of 
publication  bias  in  physical  activity  for  DS  and  AS.  The 
absence  of  some  small  studies  in  the  right-hand  section 
of  the  plots  (outcomes  with  high  statistical  significance) 
for depression and anxiety scores suggested a lack of sub-
stantial evidence for small-study effects and implied that 
publication  bias  appeared  not  to  be  the  source  of  plot 
asymmetry. The majority of the studies lay within the 95% 
confidence  limits,  suggesting  that  the  results  seemed  be 
not  markedly  influenced  by  high  heterogeneity  between 
studies. (Supplementary file 2, Figure S1-S6).

Discussion
This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis 
conducted  to  explore  the  association  between  PA  and 
symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety  in  women  during 

the menopausal transition and menopause. The findings 
suggest  that  moderate  intensity  exercises  (aerobic  exer-
cise,  increased  PA,  taichi)  may  lead  to  improvements  in 
both depressive and anxiety symptoms in women at this 
stage. Additionally, various low intensity exercises such as 
stretching, yoga, Pilates and walking were found to lower 
these  symptoms.  However,  there  is  a  lack  of  research 
on  the  effectiveness  of  vigorous  intensity  exercises  in 
reducing these symptoms. In subgroup analyses, a nega-
tive  correlation  between  PA  and  depressive  symptoms 
was  observed  in  three  groups:  postmenopausal,  meno-
pausal  individuals  and  both  of  them.  Nevertheless,  PA 
demonstrated  a  significant  improvement  in  anxiety  lev-
els solely within the postmenopausal cohort. PA such as 
walking,  stretching,  and  Chinese  traditional  sports  were 
effective  across  all  three  groups.  Most  studies  examined 
depressive  symptoms,  with  only  12  studies  specifically 
addressing anxiety symptoms. Moreover, all the decrease 
in  anxiety  is  accompanied  by  a  reduction  in  depression 
symptoms.

The  results  of  our  study  are  consistent  with  previous 
systematic review and meta-analyses, indicating that par-
ticipation in PA may result in decreased depression and 
anxiety  levels  in  adults,  regardless  of  exercise  intensity 
[46].  Besides,  we  also  found  low-intensity  exercise  may 
have  a  larger  positive  effect  on  anxiety  symptom  than 
moderate-intensity  exercise.  The  result  might  be  attrib-
uted to a large proportion of included articles with mind-
body  exercises  in  low-intensity  subgroup.  Mind-body 
exercise,  represented  by  taichi,  qigong,  and  yoga,  has 
attracted widespread attention in the scientific literature 
as a way to promote physical and psychological health. A 
recent  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  have  shown 
that  mind-body  exercises  such  as  Pilates,  yoga,  tai  chi, 
and qigong have a significant impact on reducing depres-
sion and anxiety in perimenopausal and postmenopausal 
women  [47].  Our  findings  of  a  12-week  yoga  interven-
tion  reducing  anxiety  symptoms  align  with  the  conclu-
sions  of  prior  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses

reduces  levels  of  anxiety  and  depressive  symptoms  [49]. 
This study found a correlation between low-to-moderate 
intensity  walking  and  improvement  in  depressive  symp-
toms  among  postmenopausal  and  menopausal  women, 
while there is a lack of empirical research examining the 
association  between  walking  and  symptoms  of  anxiety. 
Noteworthy  reduction  in  anxiety  and  depression  was 
noted in women practicing Yoga. There may be a debate 
regarding  the  efficacy  of  aerobic  exercise  in  improving 
symptoms. Traditional Chinese sports such as baduanjin, 
taichi, and qigong have been shown to reduce symptoms 
of depression and anxiety. Taken together, these findings 
suggest that various types of PA may alleviate symptoms 
of  depression  and  anxiety  in  women  experiencing  post-
menopausal and menopausal transitions.

The  precise  mechanism  by  which  PA  may  mitigate 
symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety  remains  unclear. 
Genetic  predisposition  and  environmental  factors  may 
both  contribute  to  this  mood  disorder.  Our  research, 
along  with  that  of  other  scholars,  demonstrates  that  PA 
can  improve  mood  symptoms  by  alleviating  vasomotor 
symptoms (VMS) and sleep disturbances [42, 50, 51]. In 
additional,  it  is  posited  that  the  mood  symptoms  expe-
rienced  by  women  during  menopausal  stages  may  be 
influenced  by  various  disrupting  factors  such  as  ovarian 
failure [52], estrogen withdrawal [53], increased levels of 
follicle-stimulating  hormone  [54],  heightened  neuroti-
cism  [55],  and  alterations  in  hormonal  levels  impacting 
serotonin and GABA signaling [40, 56]. At present, there 
is a dearth of research on the impact of these factors on 
the relationship between PA and mood symptoms, neces-
sitating further investigation in subsequent studies.

This  study  has  strengths.  Our  study  employs  a  rigor-
ous search strategy, categorize the intensity levels of PA, 
the inclusion of a substantial number of studies, and the 
use  of  conservative  statistical  methods  to  analyze  the 
results.  One  of  the  primary  strengths  of  our  systematic 
review  and  meta-analysis  was  its  comprehensive  inves-
tigation  of  many  types  of  PA  on  depressive  and  anxiety 
symptoms  during  peri-  and  post-menopausal  periods. 
Additional  strengths  of  the  study  included  the  incorpo-
ration of a substantial quantity of RCTs, contributing to 
the  reliability  and  validity  of  the  findings.  This  research 
also has several limitations that should be acknowledged. 
First,  more  than  half  of  the  studies  exhibited  a  high 
risk  of  bias,  attributed  to  the  lack  of  precision  in  blind-
ing  methods  and  incomplete  outcome  data.  Second,  the 
studies  included  in  the  analysis  exhibited  limitations  in 
terms of their quality. Variation in study quality contrib-
uted to the heterogeneity of findings noted in several of 
the meta-analyses presented in our study. The absence of 
standardized definitions for menopausal stage, PA assess-
ment  tools,  scoring  criteria  for  depressive  and  anxiety 
symptoms has led to significant heterogeneity in research

[48].  While  there  is  a  scarcity  of  meta-analyses  of  RCTs 
examining the effects of PA on reducing depression and 
anxiety in menopausal transition women. Our results are 
corroborated  by  previous  RCTs  demonstrating  that  PA

findings.  Other  potential  sources  of  heterogeneity  may 
include the type of PA, duration of the intervention, fre-
quency of sessions, ethnicity, level of education, employ-
ment status, lifestyle factors, body mass index, economic 
status, and marital status. Third, the sample size in some 
available  studies  was  limited,  hence,  it  is  advisable  to 
interpret  our  findings  with  caution.  Fourth,  the  pre-
dominant  focus  of  research  outcomes  lies  in  the  realm 
of  co-occurring  symptoms,  specifically  VMS  and  mood 
disorders.  other  scholarly  investigations  predominantly 
center on mild-to-moderate mood disorders, with a scar-
city of reviews addressing severe mood disorders. Finally, 
most  studies  do  not  incorporate  a  long-term  follow-up 
process post-intervention.

This  review  may  have  multiple  implications.  First, 
the  results  of  the  study  support  the  notion  that  various 
forms  of  exercise  therapy  may  lead  to  improvement  in 

depressive and anxiety symptoms during the menopausal 
transition.  Second,  the  results  highlight  significant  defi-
ciencies in current research and understanding, particu-
larly  in  regards  to  potentially  advantageous  treatments 
and evaluated outcomes. Specifically, while a majority of 
existing studies concentrate on low and moderate inten-
sity  PA,  there  is  a  limited  number  of  studies  examining 
vigorous intensity PA. Furthermore, there is a lack of suf-
ficient research on the effects of severe mood disorders. 
Additional,  there  is  a  lack  of  uniformity  in  the  methods 
used to assess depression and anxiety. Third, this review 
highlights  the  dearth  of  data  regarding  the  effects  of 
long-term  follow-up  in  relation  to  menopausal  symp-
toms.  Given  the  chronic  and  recurring  nature  of  these 
symptoms,  it  is  crucial  to  examine  the  potential  impact 
of  short-term  exercise  interventions  in  altering  patients’ 
sedentary  behaviors  and  establishing  enduring  health

benefits. Further studies should focus on quantifying PA 
intensity with objective data and uniforming the methods 
to assess depression and anxiety. Patients should undergo 
testing for sex hormones to determine the specific stages 
of  menopause.  Moreover,  it  is  imperative  to  investigate 
the  impact  of  varying  intensities  and  durations  of  iden-
tical  physical  activities  on  the  different  degree  of  mood 

disorders.  Additionally,  we  must  research  how  different 
physical activities impact the same groups of people.

Conclusion
Physical  activities  with  low  to  moderate  intensity  might 
impart  remarkable  improvements  for  managing  meno-
pausal  women  with  DS  and/or  AS.  While  menopausal

status  may  be  integral  to  potential  clinical  gains,  the 
relationship  between  these  variables  and  treatment 
responses  remains  unclear.  Considerable  heterogene-
ity  among  studies  underscores  the  importance  of  any 
relative reasons of exploring other metabolic or sociode-
mographic  factors  contributing  to  the  differences.  The 
progression of this research and its potential application 
in  our  patient  care  could  immensely  profit  from  more 
extensive and meticulously designed studies.
