Abstract
Introduction: In China, the over 60 population is estimated to grow from 12% in 2010 to 33% of the overall population by 2050.
The escalation in the aging population is projected to result in an Alzheimer’s disease prevalence of 27.7 million people in China by
2050 causing substantial health and economic burden. While there are some published studies on multicomponent, non-
interventions for people with dementia, we have found no published community-based approach to care that
pharmacological
encompasses personalized selection of non-pharmacological interventions, active social participation, and dementia education.
Patient concerns: An elderly female living at home alone in urban Beijing presented with signiﬁcant short-term memory
impairment, episodes of confusion, difﬁculty with language skills, and episodes of wandering. She had become reclusive and
disengaged from her previous social networks, and no longer attended any community activities or events. The patient had no
signiﬁcant past medical or psychiatric history.
Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease by a local physician based on clinical features of impaired
communication, disorientation, confusion, poor judgement, behavioral changes, and difﬁculty speaking. Depression was considered
a differential diagnosis but is also both a risk factor and symptom of dementia.

Interventions: A novel, community-based, multicomponent social care program for dementia was used to facilitate
implementation of non-pharmacological interventions, gradual socialization and provide supportive carer and community education.
Non-pharmacological interventions included a combination of validation therapy, music therapy, art therapy, reminiscence therapy,
talking therapy, reality orientation, cognitive training, smell therapy, food therapy, sensory stimulation, garden therapy, and
physiotherapy.
Outcomes: Improvements in the patient’s Geriatric Depression Scale and Mini Mental State Examination scores were noted in
association with increased social participation in the community.

Conclusion: The community-based, multicomponent dementia social care program described in this case report has enabled a
socially isolated patient with Alzheimer’s disease to reduce her social isolation with an associated improvement in her mood and
prevention of cognitive decline. Educating the community was an essential part of re-integrating the patient into the social setting.
Reducing social isolation and increasing community engagement were essential to maintaining the patient’s independence in her
own home.

1. Introduction
In China the population over the age of 60, in which Alzheimer’s
disease becomes more prevalent, is estimated to grow from 12%
in 2010 to 33% of the overall population by 2050, resulting in a
projected Alzheimer’s disease prevalence of 27.7 million people in
China by 2050.[1] Consequently, there will be a substantial
increase in the health and economic burden of Alzheimer’s
disease on care givers, health care facilities, health care providers,
and communities.[1]
increasing
dementia prevalence is compounded by barriers to dementia
diagnosis and care including the stigma of dementia, lack of
medical school
lack of health care
professionals conﬁdent in dementia assessment and management,
lack of access to diagnostic blood tests and imaging, and few
memory clinics.[2–5] Culturally in China, there is a priority of
wanting to live at home for as long as possible, but changing
socioeconomic environments mean that family members may not
be able to maintain home-based care, especially for those who
have to migrate for work.[6] As a consequence, there is a
requirement for interventions and community-based supports for
people with dementia to help maintain independence within the
community and at home.[7] While there is no pharmacological
cure for dementia, there is a growing body of evidence for
individual and multicomponent non-pharmacological interven-
tions showing beneﬁts for cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms,
daily functioning, and quality of life.[8–19] While there are also
some published studies on multicomponent, non-pharmacologi-
cal interventions for people with dementia that combine activities
for the physical,
intellectual, functional, and social stimula-
tion,[14–19] we have found no published community-based
approach to guide care that encompasses personalized selection
of non-pharmacological interventions, active social participation,
and dementia education.

This case report describes an elderly female with features of
cognitive decline and depression, living at home alone, who was
referred to our social care service after diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease. Depression is a risk factor for, and common neuropsy-
chiatric symptom of, dementia.[20] Both dementia and depression
can result in cognitive and functional impairment and deteriora-
tion in quality of life.[20] Social isolation is a both risk factor for,
as well as potential consequence of dementia and depression.[20]
With high levels of undetected dementia and depression in older
people in China,[21] where specialized dementia social care
services remain rare,[2] there is a need for practical, symptom-
focused solutions to delivering dementia care in the community.
Our dementia social care delivery team has developed a novel,
community-based, multicomponent, non-pharmacological inter-
vention program for the management of people with Alzheimer’s
disease and dementia.

2. Case report

Patient information: A widowed, retired chemistry teacher in her
late 70s was living alone in a 2-bedroom apartment in urban
Beijing, China. In 2013, her children noticed signiﬁcant short-
term memory impairment, episodes of confusion and difﬁculty
with language skills. She had become reclusive and disengaged
from her previous social networks, and no longer attended any
community activities or events. During seasonal changes she
gradually became disorientated, leading to periods of wandering
and becoming lost. She was also collecting and hoarding items of

rubbish. The patient’s son and daughter were rarely able to visit
due to work and family commitments. However, her son
recognised the patient’s deterioration and provided ﬁnancial
support for her care.

Clinical ﬁndings: In September 2013, a local physician made a
presumptive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease based on her
presenting symptoms. A Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE) score of 11 was determined. The clinical features were
typical for Alzheimer’s disease as the patient presented with
impaired communication, disorientation, confusion, poor judge-
ment, behavioral changes, and difﬁculty speaking.[22] Depression
was considered a differential diagnosis, however, apathy and
depression are also known early neuropsychiatric symptoms of
Alzheimer’s disease.[22] The patient had no signiﬁcant past
medical or psychiatric history and was not on any regular
medications, traditional Chinese medications or supplements.
Her physician recommended a medication for Alzheimer’s
disease, but the patient declined it. Her diet was poor consisting
mainly of sugar buns and tea; consequently, she was under-
weight. Support services previously arranged by the patient’s son
had not lasted as the patient believed she was independent
enough to function at home without help.

Timeline: The patient’s timeline is displayed in Table 1.
Diagnostic assessment: Dementia guidelines

recommend
exclusion of other causes of cognitive decline with blood and
urine tests, followed by referral to a memory clinic.[23] However,
due to lack of clinical and ﬁnancial resources, diagnosis was made
based on examination and clinical history which is the current
pragmatic approach to diagnosis in this patient’s community.[2,3]
The local physician provided the presumptive diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease to the patient and family based on the
patient’s symptoms of impaired communication, disorientation,
confusion, poor judgement, and behavioral changes.[22] Depres-
sion was considered a differential diagnosis, however, apathy and
depression are also known early neuropsychiatric symptoms of
Alzheimer’s disease.[22] This diagnostic information was then
provided to our social care manager. Assessment of the patient’s
scores in March 2018 were as follows: MMSE of 11,[24–26]
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale of 2 indicating moderate
cognitive impairment,[27,28] Global Deterioration Scale of 5
indicating moderately severe cognitive decline,[29] Geriatric
Depression Scale score of 7,[30,31] and a Barthel Index of
Activities of Daily Living score of 100.[32,33]

Therapeutic intervention: Our multicomponent dementia
social care program, implemented by a social care manager
and a social care worker with additional training in dementia,
included:
(cid:1) An in-depth needs assessment leading to a focused, practical

care plan

(cid:1) Non-pharmacological interventions to manage or better cope

with symptoms of dementia and functional decline

(cid:1) Community-based social activities targeted at reducing social
isolation and re-integration of the patient into the community
(cid:1) Dementia education and counselling for carers and surround-
ing communities to improve understanding, decrease stigma
and assist with socialization.

The initial plan was for 3 h of non-pharmacological inter-
ventions delivered once a week. The patient was reluctant to start
the program but after 2 months of regular visits from the social
care worker, the patient agreed to start home-based sessions.
Interventions offered included validation therapy,[34] music

the personalized non-pharmacological

therapy,[8,9,12] art therapy,[35] reminiscence therapy,[8] talking
therapy,[36] reality orientation,[8,34] cognitive training,[8] smell
therapy,[9]
sensory stimulation,[9] garden
therapy,[12] and physiotherapy.[9] From March 2018, selection
of
interventions was
supported by a structured cognitive intervention pathway
developed with input from an academic partner and implemented
by the care team as a decision-support tool within the community
delivery model. The structured cognitive intervention pathway
aligns non-pharmacological interventions with relevant stages
and symptoms of dementia based on the available published
evidence for each intervention. Following assessment of the
patient’s needs, interests, preferences, symptoms, and stage of
dementia, the pathway facilitated appropriate selection of non-
pharmacological interventions. At each intervention episode, the
Menorah Park Scale Engagement scale for Dementia was used
to determine the patient’s level of constructive, other or no
engagement from activities.[38] Mood was measured utilizing
a 3-point Likert Scale of positive, neutral, and negative
mood.[39,40] Table 2 shows the details of the interventions,
episodes, and associated overall engagement and mood scores.
In parallel with one-to-one intervention sessions, the care team
liaised with local community members regarding re-integration
and inclusion in the community. From April 2016, our social
worker accompanied the patient once a month to local cultural
community events including music and poetry, Dragon Boat,
Moon Cake, and Chinese New Year events. In October 2017 our
social worker approached the patient’s neighbors to educate
them on Alzheimer’s disease, the lived experience of a person with
dementia and to encourage them to increase their interactions
with the patient. After a long period of mostly home-based
sessions, from April 2018, the patient was encouraged to socialize
more frequently within the community and with her neighbors.
The social worker accompanied the patient on visits to the
community twice a week and the patient socialized almost daily
with her neighbors. From May 2018, the patient participated in

more active community events which included visiting Tianan-
men Square, and physical activities including Tai Chi and light
dancing.

Follow-up and outcomes: After

the increase in social
engagement and active community participation, an improve-
ment in the patient’s depression and MMSE scores was noted.
The patient’s Geriatric Depression Scale score (Fig. 1) progres-
sively improved over the months from March to August 2018
when active social community participation increased. The
largest jump in the patient’s MMSE score (Fig. 2) was between
March and April 2018 when the patient’s social participation in
the community and time spent outdoors increased.[20,41] The
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale of 2 (moderate cognitive
impairment), Global Deterioration scale of 5 (moderately severe
cognitive decline) and Barthel Index score of 100 remained
unchanged over the 12 months.

Interventions that were associated with highest

levels of
constructive engagement and more positive mood included three
of the patient’s former hobbies which have been restored: music,
art, and gardening. Other domains of improvement included
language skills and communication, reduced hoarding, and
weight gain (3.6 kg). Increased neighborhood awareness of the
patient’s condition has enhanced her safety during periods of
confusion or wandering. There were no adverse effects reported.
In March 2019, the family employed a domestic worker to live in
with the patient to help with cooking and accompany her to
community activities. The social care team provided the domestic
worker with 6h of training on person-centred dementia care
including some non-pharmacological activities. The patient’s son has
provided positive feedback about the service. The social care worker
still maintains telephonic contact with the patient once a month.

isolated patient living at home with symptoms of Alzheimer’s
disease including depression, to re-integrate into her community
and return to active participation in cultural activities and former
hobbies. Reduction in her social isolation through increased
frequency of active community participation was associated with
improvement in her mood and prevention of cognitive decline
despite her refusal to take any medications for dementia. The
increase in the MMSE was noted when the patient’s social
participation in the community and time spent outdoors
increased.[20,41] Time spent outdoors has also been associated
with improvement in mood in people with moderate and severe
dementia.[41] The MMSE score remained between 14 and 17 over
the following 12 months with no decline observed. It can be
expected that the MMSE score would drop between 1.8 and 6.7

points annually for people with dementia.[42,43] We acknowledge
that the MMSE is intended for use as a screening tool and has
practice effects when used repeatedly, however, it is still used in
clinical settings to measures cognitive change over time, takes
only 5 to 10 min and can be more readily administered by allied
health professionals,[44] compared to, for example, the Alz-
heimer’s Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive section (ADAS-
Cog) which takes 40 min.[45] While the ADAS-Cog would be
optimal for future planned research, duration, and practical
implementation of assessments within services need to be scalable
in a large population.

Multimodal non-pharmacological interventions have demon-
strated improvement in dementia symptoms,[17] improvement in
cognition,[14,18,19] delay in cognitive decline,[14,19] improvement

in social behavior and social outcomes,[14,16,17] and improvement
in mood and behavioral outcomes for people living with
dementia.[14,15,16,18] However, those interventions speciﬁcally
noted to be delivered in the community were based on short-term
interventions without sustained improvement.[18] Furthermore,
there is little guidance available on how to implement a
community model of non-pharmacological care in a person’s
home and select non-pharmacological interventions in a rational
and systematic way. While the staff applied all the knowledge
available, and further resources such as the structured cognitive
intervention pathway were developed to facilitate intervention
selection and monitoring, we acknowledge that, with a very
limited home-care system in China,[2] development and further
research of a structured, multicomponent model of home-focused
care for people with dementia within the community is crucial.
Programs designed to facilitate maintaining independence,
quality of life and integration with the community, that can be
delivered by a range of social and allied health care professionals

and informal carers could help reduce the burden on the formal
health care sector. The fundamental factors of education and
reducing social isolation are essential to successful implementa-
tion of care for people with dementia living alone at home.
