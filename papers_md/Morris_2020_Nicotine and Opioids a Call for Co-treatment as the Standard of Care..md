as the Standard of Care

Abstract

The U.S. is in the midst of an opioid epidemic. At the same time, tobacco use remains the
leading cause of preventable death and disability. While the shared biological underpinnings of
nicotine and opioid addiction are well established, clinical implications for co-treatment of these
two substance use disorders has not been emphasized in the literature, nor have researchers,
clinicians, and policy makers adequately outlined pathways for incorporating co-treatment into
existing clinical workﬂows. The current brief review characterizes the metabolic and neural
mechanisms which mediate co-use of nicotine and opioids, and then outlines clinical and policy
implications for concurrently addressing these two deadly epidemics. Screening, assessment,
medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and tobacco-free policy are discussed. The evidence
suggests that clinical care and policies that facilitate co-treatment are an expedient means of
delivering healthcare to individuals that result in better health for the population while also
meeting patients’ substance abuse disorder recovery goals.

Introduction

Healthcare providers have a critical opportunity to concurrently address tobacco and opioid
dependence. The policy spotlight on the U.S. opioid epidemic and the dramatic increase in
overdose deaths presents an opportunity to bring renewed focus on strategies that potentiate
addiction treatment,
including nicotine addiction treatment. Over-prescription of opioid pain
relievers beginning in the 1990s led to a rapid escalation of dependence, a resurgence of heroin
use, and arrival of powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl which increased 45% from 2016 to
2017.1,2 In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the U.S.,1 and heroin overdoses more
than tripled from 2010 to 2014.3 In the face of these dire statistics, smoking is often seen as less
harmful and a lower treatment priority than opioids which represent a clear, imminent risk.4 Yet,

smoking combustible tobacco products, not opioid use, remains the leading cause of death and
disability in the U.S., with at least 480,000 dying annually due to smoking-related causes.5

The general prevalence of current cigarette smoking among U.S. adults is 14% (16% for men
and 12% for women).6 Smoking is highest among those aged 18–44 (15%) and 45–64 (17%).
Hispanic adults (10%) are less likely to be current smokers compared with non-Hispanic black
(15%) and non-Hispanic white adults (16%).6 In comparison, smoking prevalence among patients
using illicit opioids or who are receiving methadone maintenance treatment is between 74 and
97%.7–11 This is an extremely high rate of co-use even when compared to co-use with other illicit
drugs or alcohol.12 For instance, 97% of heroin users in one study of methadone or buprenorphine
treatment used an average of 20 cigarettes or a pack per day.13 Co-occurring tobacco and opioid
use creates an additive effect of increasing toxicity and related health consequences across all body
systems,14 leading these users to face unnecessarily high mortality and morbidity.15,16

While the shared biological underpinnings of nicotine and opioid addiction are well-established,
clinical and policy implications have garnered limited attention. Smoking is a primary risk factor
for opioid addiction, and there is ample evidence that co-treatment of tobacco and opioid use leads
to better outcomes among those seeking treatment for drug use generally and opioid addiction
speciﬁcally. This article summarizes the neurobiological and clinical evidence suggesting that there
is a clinical and ethical imperative to promote co-treatment models as a necessary standard of care.

Biological underpinnings

Using both opioids and tobacco may enhance subjective positive effects and satisfaction with
drug use, reduce withdrawal symptoms for both substances, and act as a substitution when one
drug is unavailable.17,18 Co-use leads to the increased use of one or both substances through
priming, extending reinforcement, and cross-tolerance,
thus making abstinence from either
substance more difﬁcult.14,19,20 In part, cross-tolerance occurs because combustible tobacco use
produces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which induce faster metabolism of opioids through
induction of hepatic cytochrome P-450 1A2-isoenzymes.21 While infrequent, this effect can lead to
opioid toxicity when patients quit smoking.22 There is also evidence that past smokers using
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use opioids at the same level as current smokers. As NRT
this indicates additional biological
does not produce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
mechanisms of cross-tolerance. These bidirectional priming and tolerance between nicotine and
opioids include illicit drugs as well as prescribed use of methadone and buprenorphine.23,24 In
addition to cross tolerance, polysubstance use heightens reinforcement because opioids and
tobacco similarly stimulate reward pathways including the dopaminergic, cannabinoid, and
nicotinic-acetylcholine (nAChR) systems.25,26 As a result of these related metabolic and neural
processes, smoking increases opioid use, including opioid replacement medication use.27 At the
same time, opioid use including prescription replacement drugs reinforces smoking patterns.28,29
Chronic pain is also implicated in co-use of tobacco and opioids. Current smoking among
persons suffering chronic pain ranges from 24 to 82%,30,31 and ﬁndings suggest that there are no
signiﬁcant associations between smoking status and ethnicity, sex, or age.31 Paradoxically, acute
nicotine use is known to have short-term analgesic effects, but ongoing use leads to chronic pain.
Nicotine initially releases endogenous opioids32–34 and potentiates opioid-induced antinociception
and activates the pain inhibitory pathways in the spinal cord.34–36 Chronic nicotine exposure leads
to tolerance to this analgesic effect. Indeed, ongoing smoking becomes a risk factor for the onset or
exacerbation of back pain, sciatica, arthritis, ﬁbromyalgia, and chronic headache.37–41 Nicotine (or
in tobacco smoke) may sensitize pain receptors, decrease pain
perhaps another component
tolerance, and increase pain awareness.42 Prospective cohort studies of adolescents bear this out,
demonstrating that smoking early in life causes chronic back pain leading to related
hospitalizations, initial opioid use, and potential opioid addiction persisting into adulthood.43–45

Logically, it would follow that smoking cessation might then be a treatment for chronic pain,34,46
but randomized controlled trials have not substantiated this hypothesis.41 Continued research is
needed to further elucidate the complex relationship between smoking and pain.

Regardless of causality, smokers are at increased risk for chronic pain of higher intensity,
increased number of painful sites, and more associated disability and adverse effects on
occupational and social functioning.33,34,47–49 Smokers have higher pain scores and higher need
for opioids during surgery and postoperatively compared to nonsmokers.50 And studies have found
that, in comparison to non-smokers, smokers are more likely to be on opioid pain treatment for
longer durations and at higher dosages.51 Higher levels of reported pain among smokers may also
be related to elevated levels of depression,52 and in turn, anxiety and depression heighten the
motivation to smoke and increase severity of nicotine withdrawal and pain sensitivity.53 Therefore,
there is some evidence that treating psychiatric symptoms will lead to improvements in pain
symptoms,52 which may then potentiate reductions in polysubstance use.

Co-treatment

There is mounting evidence that addressing smoking and other drug use concurrently leads to
improved psychiatric and polysubstance use outcomes.54–59 At minimum, research has found that
smoking cessation while in treatment has no effect on other drug use outcomes.56,57
Encouragingly, meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation interven-
tions found that
their addiction to tobacco and other substances
simultaneously are 25% more likely to sustain their recovery, compared to individuals who do
not address tobacco while in treatment from other drugs.58 As an extension of this meta-analysis,
McKelvey and colleagues59 synthesized the evidence across 24 studies to show the positive impact
of smoking cessation on substance use disorder (SUD) outcomes. Both quitting smoking and
smoking cessation treatment interventions had either a positive impact or no impact on substance
use outcomes. Positive SUD impacts included reduced drug use and continued abstinence.59

individuals who treat

In contrast

to many healthcare providers’ beliefs, patients in treatment for opioids desire
assistance with smoking cessation,60 with 44% to 80% of methadone maintenance clients wanting
to quit smoking.61,62 The longer patients receive methadone maintenance therapy,
the more
motivated they become to quit smoking.18,63–65 Due to SUD patients’ overlapping genetic,
neurobiological, and environmental characteristics, similar population level, behavioral, medica-
tion, and social service interventions are effective across substance use disorders.2 But despite the
clear beneﬁts of co-treatment and the fact that patients desire to quit smoking, tobacco cessation
services remain infrequently offered in SUD treatment settings.66,67 Less than half of SUD
treatment centers (29–42%) offer
there are an
insufﬁcient number of addiction specialists,70 and among addiction medicine professionals, the
majority receive little training regarding integration of tobacco cessation screening, assessment,
referral, and treatment into daily practice.

tobacco cessation services.68,69 Generally,

There are a number of oft cited barriers to addressing smoking in treatment settings including
concerns that1 agency census levels and completion rates will drop,2 tobacco users will be less
likely to seek addiction treatment,3 patients are neither interested in tobacco cessation nor able to
successfully quit tobacco,4 patients will relapse to alcohol or drug use if they attempted to quit
tobacco,5 tobacco-free policies will be difﬁcult to enforce,6 clinicians lack the skills to effectively
treat tobacco dependence, and7 clinicians have too many competing demands preventing attention
to smoking cessation.8,71–73 Also, few treatment agencies have a designated leader or formalized
the ability to prescribe smoking cessation
procedures related to smoking cessation services,
pharmacotherapies, or an existing budget for cessation interventions.74

Historically, many addiction treatment facilities have not only allowed but actively reinforced
smoking.75 Healthcare providers continue to widely hold the perspective that smoking cannot be

treated concurrently with other substance use.72 In many cases, smoking is directly or indirectly
condoned in treatment settings, with a large proportion of SUD treatment providers smoking
themselves and smoking with patients while in treatment.76,77 Indeed, many patients with SUD
report that they ﬁrst began smoking in addictions or other psychiatric treatment environments.78
Additionally, compared to treatment settings where smoking is not allowed, continued smoking in
treatment settings is associated with increased opioid withdrawal and cravings, more cigarette use
at follow-up, and lower detox completion.60,79–81

Organizational afﬁliation has also played a role in smoking cessation efforts in SUD and other
healthcare settings. Over the last decade, cessation services in federally qualiﬁed healthcare centers
(FQHCs) have been reinforced by Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) tobacco
use measures, the ability to bill under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.82 In the behavioral health sector, early state
intiatives mandating tobacco policy and cessation services for substance disorder treatment
facilities75,83 have been reinvigorated on a national level through the efforts of such organizations
as the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), federal
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Smoking Cessation
Leadership Center (SCLC), and National Council for Behavioral Health (National Council).84
While the cultural shift has been slow, co-treatment of opioids and nicotine addiction among state-
funded SUD treatment agencies and opioid treatment centers continues to gather momentum.

Tobacco-Free Policy Facilitators for adequately addressing both tobacco and opioid use include
having a lower number of clinicians who smoke, patient incentives, senior leadership support, and
ongoing staff training in evidence-based treatment strategies.85,86 Tobacco-free policies also
heighten clinical effectiveness. Ample evidence suggests that tobacco-free campus policies support
co-treatment and should be implemented by treatment agencies.76,87 When treatment agencies
implement comprehensive tobacco-free policies that include the facility grounds, patients’ attitudes
about quitting are improved, they receive more tobacco cessation services, and the intent to quit
smoking increases.76 Tobacco policies not only support quit attempts, but also prevent
the
initiation of smoking which is associated with higher odds of drug use relapse. Policies can be
created by individual agencies or mandated statewide. New York has, among other states, instituted
statewide policies among funded SUD treatment agencies.83,88 Within inpatient treatment settings,
neither
i.e., smoke-free policies, nor smoking cessation treatment
interventions negatively affect other drug use treatment outcomes.59 Furthermore, studies show
no evidence that smoke-free policies instituted in inpatient treatment settings adversely impact
patient census rates.78

forced quit attempts,

treatment, and referral
Screening, Brief Interventions, and Referral A systematic screening,
structure is necessary to adequately address drug use. In behavioral health treatment settings,
screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (i.e., SBIRT) were originally developed to
detect risky substance use and direct providers to intervene early using motivational enhancement
strategies.89–91 While SBIRT has been demonstrated to be effective for risky alcohol use, there is
growing yet varied evidence of effectiveness for other drug use.92–94 Recently, Bernstein and
D’Onofrio90 made modiﬁcations to SBIRT, creating a model referred to as STIR (screening,
treatment initiation, and referral). The primary difference between SBIRT and STIR is that STIR
prompts clinicians to initiate pharmacotherapy for illicit opioid or tobacco use during the initial
visit. Recent studies of STIR in emergency departments have demonstrated increased patient
engagement and decrease in both tobacco and opioid use.90 The equivalent of SBIRT in tobacco
control environments is referred to as the “5As” (Ask about tobacco use, Advise to quit through

604

The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research

clear personalized messages, Assess willingness to quit, Assist to quit, and Arrange follow-up and
support).95,96 Implementation of the 5As in heterogeneous healthcare settings has been an impetus
for greater attention to tobacco use, with brief advice from physicians and other clinicians
associated with patients’ successful quit attempts.97,98

Utilizing the SBIRT, STIR or the 5As model, healthcare providers in SUD or primary care
settings are much more likely to screen for tobacco use, assess, and advise abstinence, but
unfortunately are less likely to follow these actions by providing brief treatment, medication-
assisted treatment (MAT), or appropriate referral.99–101 This is a substantial practice gap that has
been difﬁcult
to narrow.102,103 The infrequency of appropriate referrals and evidence-based
treatments point to the necessity of interdisciplinary healthcare teams as physicians are less
responsive than other providers (e.g., nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants) to systemic
efforts to increase tobacco cessation treatment. Additionally, regardless of the screening and brief
intervention model employed, establishing a SUD patient registry, which includes both opioids and
nicotine use, within a practice-based research and/or health care network allows for better data
aggregation, patient identiﬁcation, and stratiﬁcation to appropriate treatment levels.104

Medication-Assisted Treatment Appropriate treatment across substance use disorders typically
involves MAT, consisting of a combination of behavioral interventions and medications.105 The
synergistic effects of MAT apply as equally to smoking cessation as it does to opioid maintenance
treatment. Research shows that both tobacco and opioid use treatment should include FDA-
approved medications to treat dependence and maximize healthcare utilization.106 For opioid
dependence, methadone and buprenorphine are approved, as well as naloxone for overdose. For
tobacco cessation, a combination of behavioral strategies and seven FDA-approved medications are
the most effective means of quitting smoking.95

Medications plus behavioral counseling lead to tobacco cessation rates of 25–30% compared to
unaided quit attempts with a success rate of 4–7%.95 For the general population, all FDA-approved
cessation pharmacotherapy improves the chances of smoking cessation at 6-month follow-up or
longer, compared to placebo. A review of reviews found that NRT and bupropion increase the
likelihood that a person will be abstinent from tobacco at 6 months post-quit by about 60%, while
varenicline more than doubles the likelihood of abstinence at 6 months compared to a placebo.107
The EAGLES study further demonstrated the superior efﬁcacy of varenicline for both psychiatric
and non-psychiatric populations and conﬁrmed past ﬁndings that there were no signiﬁcant increase
in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine
patch or placebo.108,109

For persons abusing opioids or taking opioid replacement medications, the interaction between
opioids and nicotine may explain the reduced efﬁcacy of NRT for this population.11 This is further
supported by the ﬁnding that the lower the dose of opioid replacement medications taken, the more
likely patients are to quit smoking.10 Due to mixed ﬁndings regarding the efﬁcacy of NRT for
patients in opioid dependence treatment, unless contraindicated or unavailable, bupropion which
acts on dopaminergic neurons or varenicline which is a partial agonist of the α4β2 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor will be better ﬁrst-line options.11,108–110 This is particularly the case if
low adherence to taking medication capsules.111 Importantly,
providers can address general
clinician training is necessary to ensure that cessation medications are prescribed in combination
therapeutic dosages meeting individual dependence levels.112 This is imperative, as
and at
treatment failures often result from under-dosing cessation medications.56 Patients should be
directed to use combination medications, such as veranicline, bupropion, or long-lasting NRT (e.g.,
patch) with rescue medication (e.g., NRT gum, or
to control break-through
cravings.113,114

Currently, there is a great amount of attention to vaping as a potential harm reduction strategy
among smokers.115 Many smokers are using vaping products as the primary means of quitting or
reducing smoking.116 While safer than combustible tobacco use, vaping is not necessarily safe.
Vaping, as well as smoking, may put individuals at increased risk for respiratory illness and
infectious diseases like COVID-19.117 The end goal for all patients is abstinence from all nicotine
products. Electronic nicotine devices (ENDS) are not FDA-approved smoking cessation aids, and
the efﬁcacy of these products for long-term abstinence from conventional cigarettes is uncertain.118
ENDS may help some smokers quit; however, the data are mixed, with some studies ﬁnding that
ENDS users do not completely discontinue combustible tobacco products, resulting in no
improvement in health outcomes,116,119,120 and others continue ENDS use indeﬁnitely.121

Similar to nicotine addiction, MAT is also the most effective treatment option for individuals
who abuse opioids. MAT doubles opioid abstinence rates2,122 and should be provided 90 days or
longer.123 All FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder are clinically effective, with
opioid agonists (methadone) or partial agonists (burprenorphine) reducing withdrawal symptoms
and the addictive effects of illicit opioids. Methadone is the most commonly used and studied
medication.123 Some medications have been shown more effective,124,125 with buprenorphine
shown effective in maintaining treatment engagement and abstinence.126 More than half of patients
addicted to prescription opioids treated with buprenorphine and naloxone reported they were not
misusing opioid prescription drugs 18 months after starting treatment. Buprenorphine has the
advantage of ﬂexible administration, either daily, monthly, or every 6 months, but is limited by
what type of healthcare providers is able to prescribe buprenorphine and what number of patients
they can treat.123 Extended-release injectable naltrexone, and opioid antgonist, is also approved for
treatment of people with opioid use disorder. Any prescriber can provide naltrexone following a
medically managed withdrawal.123 There is evidence that naltrexone both reduces cravings from
opioids and helps with short-term smoking abstinence, particularly for individuals with depression
or alcohol dependence.127–129

For both opioid and tobacco use, behavioral treatment components of MAT include motivational
interviewing (MI) or motivational enhancement techniques which are effective across substance
use disorders.130,131 These interventions increase motivation for behavioral change and treatment
engagement. During brief MI, non-judgmental, open-ended reﬂective responses, afﬁrmations and
well-timed summaries serve to mirror and reinforce the beneﬁts of behavior change and patients’
self-efﬁcacy.132 Once in treatment, contingency management (e.g., monetary reinforcement),
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other variants of cognitive and behavioral interventions
are proven treatments.56 Relapse prevention is also necessary to train individuals to mitigate pain,
avoid high-risk situations, and practice replacement coping skills.42,133 Behavioral strategies might
be employed whether individuals are initially seeking treatment for tobacco use, opioid use, or
chronic pain. For example, patient pain motivates a large proportion of physician visits, and such
visits could provide a “teachable moment” for addressing smoking and pain medications.134 One
study found that, when educated about the relationship between pain and tobacco use, patients
seeking outpatient pain treatment were over seven times more willing to consider quitting
smoking.135 It also may be helpful for clinicians to assess the role of anxiety and depression in the
intersection of pain, smoking, and opioid use.53

Implications for Behavioral Health
The “quadruple aim” of the healthcare system is to deliver quality, lower cost healthcare to
individuals, and improve the work life of healthcare providers resulting in better population
health.136,137 One of the most expedient means of accomplishing the quadruple aim is to address
patients’ concurrent smoking and opioid use. Co-treatment models address the fact
that
polysubstance use is the norm, not the exception. The majority of adults with SUD are interested

in quitting smoking and motivated to quit at rates consistent with the general population,138 but
they are not afforded timely, evidence-based treatment options as detailed in the Public Health
Service Guidelines.95 As a result, patients may overcome their opioid addiction to then die or have
severe health issues which are smoking related.138 While additional work is needed to better
understand how overlapping neural mechanisms contribute to opioid and nicotine addiction, the
existing evidence supports co-treatment, buttressed by tobacco-free policies, as a standard of care.2
Screening and brief intervention is one of the three top preventive services in terms of cost savings
and the potential to improve overall population health.139,140 Moreover, promotion of MAT and
appropriate referral across addictions (e.g., telephonic services for polysubstance use) hold great
promise.

Multilevel changes are needed to foster co-treatment

in SUD treatment settings.141 At an
organizational level, the ﬁrst goal of co-treatment is the denormalization of tobacco use and other
nicotine products by implementing and reinforcing a comprehensive tobacco-free policy. As part of
a comprehensive policy, all patients who smoke, vape, or are at risk for relapse to nicotine use
should be offered MAT. To do so, agencies must provide the infrastructure for MAT using the
standardized 5As model (or SBIRT, STIR variant previously described) with the expectation that
clinicians ask, advise, and assess for opioid and nicotine dependence simultaneously. There are
proven steps toward taking inpatient, outpatient, and residential treatment settings tobacco free and
providing MAT services. One such resource, the DIMENSIONS Tobacco Free Policy Toolkit
provides guidance, timelines, and templates for written policy and workﬂow implementation.142

At a provider level, interdisciplinary staff must be trained in evidence-based practices for
engaging patients, assessing use, and providing treatments for both opioids and tobacco. A number
of evidence-based resources are available from the University of Colorado including tobacco-free
treatment toolkits, 5As and MI video training modules, and interdisciplinary workﬂow models
(https://www.bhwellness.org/resources). These resources detail behavioral
interventions and
pharmacology, including how medication levels may be affected by tobacco use reduction and
quit attempts. Providers are further encouraged to take advantage of the resources and model
programming continuously updated by the National Behavioral Health Network for Tobacco
and Cancer Control (NBHN) (www.bhthechange.org) administered by the National Council.
NBHN is one of the eight Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) national
networks created to eliminate tobacco- and cancer-related disparities. The Smoking Cessation
Leadership Center is another site with a wealth of archived training opportunities (https://
smokingcessationleadership.ucsf.edu). Several states are building on these training resources to
additionally offer opioid treatment program opportunities to participate in a community of
practice (CoP).143 The CoP is a virtual peer learning environment which fosters discussion of
barriers and facilitators to care, as well as speciﬁc issues such as MAT, polypharmacy,
treatment planning, billing, and health systems change. A current example is the Washington
State Department of Health which funds the Tobacco Free Behavioral Health Initiative where
Opioid Treatment Network staff are invited to receive Tobacco Treatment Specialist144 training
and also participate in a CoP.145

interventions to build motivation for

Simultaneous opioid and tobacco treatment planning is typically appropriate,54 and providers
will treat tobacco dependence more effectively if it is considered “opt-out” care.146 All patients will
beneﬁt by brief MI
treatment. While studies have
demonstrated the feasibility of treating nicotine dependence in patients with SUD, there is still
some debate as to whether tobacco and other SUD treatment should be delivered simultaneously or
sequentially.147 There are valid concerns that fewer patients will engage in delayed treatment,148
but opt-out care is best operationalized as a person-centered, strength-based approach aligned with
each patient’s motivation, readiness, and available resources.123 Patients should partner with
providers to determine to what degree nicotine and opioid use are simultaneously treated.

As detailed earlier, standard MAT, including proven FDA medications, should be utilized during
co-treatment of opioids and tobacco. Providers should adhere to standards of care for the general
population, but be able to tailor the dosage of pharmacotherapy and counseling to SUD patients
that will typically have high nicotine dependency levels and complex care needs. Regarding
behavioral strategies, education on polysubstance dependence can be provided in a synergistic
manner and readiness to quit nicotine use should be routinely reassessed. The majority of issues
polysubstance users face are cross-cutting and the proven behavioral therapies previously discussed
are appropriate in varied modalities and formats for opioid or nicotine dependence and can be
utilized to simultaneously or independently to address polysubstance dependence.58 At a minimum,
providers can make warm hand-offs to state quitlines at 1-800-QUIT-NOW which are available in
every state. Quitlines offer varied combinations of telephonic counseling, pharmacotherapy, and
online and texting resources at no cost.149 That said, siloed systems and treatment protocols can
lead to patient burden, lower quality of care, and non-adherence.150 Referrals to quitlines and other
community resources are encouraged. At the same time, agencies should provide treatment onsite
employing a collaborative care model, team-based care, patient-centered resources, registries, and
other sufﬁcient infrastructure.151–153

There are limitations to the extant knowledge base. Further work needs to determine if
concurrent versus sequential or staged treatment models are most effective, and if this effectiveness
differs by type of treatment setting. New technology platforms, accountability mechanisms,
payment approaches, and incentive systems for the hardest to reach underserved populations also
require testing.150 That said, pain clinics, behavioral health treatment settings, methadone, and
other opioid treatment programs represent opportunities to also address smoking. Patients with
polysubstance use are largely motivated for co-treatment
to overcome addictions which are
biologically, psychologically, and socially overlapping. With relatively little additional training and
favorable attitudes,
interdisciplinary healthcare professionals have the ability to concurrently
address two deadly epidemics, opioid and nicotine addiction.
