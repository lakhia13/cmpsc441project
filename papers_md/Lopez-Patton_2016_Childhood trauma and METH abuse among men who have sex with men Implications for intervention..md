Abstract

Methamphetamine (METH) has become one of the most widely abused drugs in South Florida, 
particularly among MSM who may or may not be HIV seropositive. High rates of childhood 
trauma have been reported among HIV-infected MSM (Chartier et al., 2010), but, the association 
of childhood trauma, and mood disorders with methamphetamine use in HIV-infected men, has not 
been comprehensively explored. A better understanding of the association between these factors 
could improve existing substance abuse treatment intervention strategies and medical treatment 
programs (e.g., medication adherence; Carrico, 2010) to enhance positive health outcomes for 
male meth abusers living with the psychological consequences of childhood abuse. This study, as 
part of a larger study, examined the occurrence of childhood trauma and depression in a group of 
HIV seropositive METH abusing MSM. Significantly higher levels of depression symptom 
severity were found among METH users relative to non-METH users (p < .001). Irrespective of 
HIV status, METH users also reported higher frequencies of emotional, physical and sexual child

abuse relative to non-METH users (p < .001). Among meth users, depression was predicted by 
childhood emotional neglect. These results suggest that childhood maltreatment may be implicated 
in the development of emotional distress (e.g., depression) and higher prevalence of 
methamphetamine/drug abuse in this population. These findings have important implications for 
substance abuse interventions, specifically targeting METH addiction among MSM. Addressing 
childhood trauma and depression may play a key role in enhancing the effectiveness of 
interventions for methamphetamine addiction.

1. Introduction

Childhood abuse is associated with increased vulnerability for the development of various 
psychiatric disorders in adulthood, including mood and anxiety disorders (Heim and 
Nemeroff, 2001; Nemeroff et al., 2003). Childhood abuse is defined here as the “physical 
and mental injury, sexual abuse, negligent treatment, or maltreatment of a child under the 
age of 18 years by a person who is responsible for the child’s welfare under circumstances 
which indicate that the child’s health or welfare is harmed or threatened” (Child Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment Act, 2010). A recent meta-analysis revealed that a substantial 
proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) have childhood abuse histories (Lloyd 
and Operario, 2012). Childhood abuse increases vulnerability to psychiatric and substance 
abuse disorders (Anda et al., 2006, 2010) and it is estimated that 25%–40% of children are 
exposed to some form of childhood maltreatment (Browne and Finkelhor, 1986; Holmes, 
1997). The prevalence of sexual abuse before 18 years of age is one in four for females and 
one in five for males, and up to 20% of males and 19% of females have been exposed to 
childhood physical abuse. Emotional abuse and neglect is also prevalent in victims of 
childhood physical and sexual abuse and has been associated with an increased risk of 
psychopathology in adulthood.

As noted above, mood disorders are associated with higher rates of exposure to childhood 
trauma and/or childhood abuse, and comorbid substance abuse is often conceptualized as a 
self-medication for mood disorders, particularly in depressed women (Bizzarri et al., 2009; 
Phillips and Johnson, 2001). In 1992, methamphetamine (METH), a highly addictive 
stimulant, started appearing on the West Coast of the US and in Hawaii. Currently, it is 
estimated that about 10 million people in the U.S. have abused METH in their lifetime 
(www.nida.nih.gov). METH abuse has become associated with negative medical and 
psychiatric complications (Carrico et al., 2010), and METH intoxication has been associated 
with unprotected sex and other high-risk behaviors that facilitate HIV infection. Most 
recently, methamphetamine has become one of the most widely abused drugs in South 
Florida, particularly among men having sex with men (MSM; Rajasingham et al., 2012; 
Mimiaga et al., 2008) and METH abuse has been identified as a risk factor for contracting 
HIV-1 infection. Although high rates of childhood trauma have been reported among HIV-
infected MSM (Chartier et al., 2010), the association of childhood trauma, mood disorders

and METH use in HIV-infected men, has not been comprehensively explored. A better 
understanding of the association between these factors could improve existing substance 
treatment intervention and medical treatment programs (e.g., medication adherence; Carrico 
et al., 2010) to enhance positive health outcomes for male METH abusers living with the 
psychological consequences of childhood abuse.

The current study examines the occurrence of childhood trauma and depression in a group of 
HIV seropositive METH abusing MSM. The main objective of the study was to further 
elucidate the characteristics of METH abusers with childhood histories of physical, sexual 
and emotional abuse in order to provide the basis for more effective METH abuse 
interventions. It was hypothesized that the METH abusing men would be more likely to 
report a history of childhood trauma than those who did not abuse methamphetamine.

2. Methods

In order to maintain confidentiality and anonymity of the participants, a certificate of 
‘confidentiality’ was procured from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA; funding 
agency). All study procedures were approved by the University of Miami Institutional 
Review Board prior to study onset. Participants were recruited from the local Miami-Dade 
community by distributing flyers and by word of mouth. Specifically, flyers were distributed 
among various substance abuse rehabilitation centers, substance abuse support groups, 
community HIV clinics and various nightclubs in the Miami-Dade area. In this study, a total 
of 112 men were screened for participation. Study participants enrolled were men having sex 
with men (MSM) who were HIV-1 seronegative METH abusers (n = 38), MSM HIV-1 
seropositive METH abusers (n = 77), or HIV-1 seronegative non-METH abusers (n = 131) 
who did or did not identify as MSM. All participants provide informed consent at the time of 
enrollment, prior to undergoing study procedures. Most recent use of METH was a 
minimum of one week prior to the first study visit as per self-report.

2.1. Assessments

Participants were assessed by the study staff in a private room regarding demographic 
characteristics and depression (CESD, Radloff, 1977) during their first study visit. The 
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) score of ≥16 was considered as 
the definition of significant depressive symptoms. Substance use history was assessed by 
SCID (APP, 2007) and childhood trauma was assessed by the Childhood Trauma 
Questionnaire (CTSQ; Kenardy et al., 2006). Participants were provided with compensation 
for travel and time.

2.2. Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics were computed to evaluate whether data met assumptions underlying 
statistical procedures. Data were examined for assumptions of normality and independence 
of observations using histograms and residual plots and appropriate data transformations 
were made as necessary. Preliminary analysis of the data included descriptive statistics 
(univariate analyses, means, standard deviations, medians, bivariate analyses and chi-square) 
in order to evaluate differences among the groups on demographic variables. Chi-square

tests were used to evaluate differences among the groups with respect to incidence of 
depression and childhood maltreatment. Finally, in an effort to better understand the 
relationship between historical psychosocial influences and current distress, multiple 
regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between reported childhood 
maltreatment (i.e., as indicated on the CTQ) and depression (i.e., as indicated on the CES-
D).

3. Results

3.1. Participants

Participant characteristics differed by group (see Table 1). Marital status was assessed by 
self-report. Participants were asked to select their marital status as one of the five categories 
listed in Table 1 (i.e., Single, married, divorced, etc.). However, it is likely that most 
participants that abuse meth have more than one partner.

3.2. HIV+/METH+

The mean age of HIV-infected METH abusing participants (n = 77) was 41.8 years with a 
mean of 12 years of education. Of these, 43% self-identified as Hispanic, 34% as African–
American, 1.3% as Haitian/Caribbean and 21% as Caucasian. In terms of employment, 72% 
were not employed, 18% were employed part-time and 8% were working full-time. Of the 
77 participants in this group, 74% reported prior treatment for mental illness and 48% 
reported prior treatment for alcohol abuse.

3.3. HIV−/METH+

The mean age of HIV-uninfected methamphetamine abusing participants (n = 38) was 34 
years, of whom 47% identified themselves as Hispanic, 21% as African–American, 0% as 
Haitian or of Caribbean descent and 26% as Caucasian. In terms of employment, 63% were 
not employed, 16% were employed part-time and 18% were working full-time. The mean 
years of education were 12.5 years. Of the 38 participants in this group, 52% reported prior 
treatment for mental illness and 34% reported prior treatment for alcohol abuse.

3.4. HIV−/non METH users

The mean age of non-methamphetamine using HIV-negative participants that did not 
identify as MSM (n = 131) was 36, of whom 65% identified as Hispanic, 21% as African–
American, 1.5% as Haitian/Caribbean and 9% as Caucasian. In terms of employment, 32% 
were unemployed, 21.4% were employed part-time and 46% were working full-time. 
Participants had a mean of 13 years of education. Of the 131 participants in this group, 14% 
reported prior treatment for mental illness, and 3% reported prior treatment for alcohol 
abuse.

As shown in Table 2, significantly higher levels of depression symptom severity were found 
among meth users relative to non-METH users, irrespective of HIV status (p < .001). METH 
using participants also reported higher frequencies of emotional, physical and sexual child 
abuse, as well as emotional and physical neglect relative to non-meth users (p < .001). 
Regression modeling demonstrated that among METH users, depression was best predicted

by a reported history of emotional neglect. Childhood emotional, physical and sexual abuse 
did not contribute significantly to the prediction of depression among METH users. 
Emotional neglect accounted for 23.5% of the variance in depression among METH users (p 
< .001).

4. Discussion

Several studies have documented the association between adverse childhood events and 
adult substance abuse (Ekinci and Kandemir, 2014). Specifically, childhood sexual abuse 
(Cuellar and Curry, 2007; Vera et al., 2005) physical abuse and neglect (Mersky et al., 2013) 
have been identified as important risk factors for the development of substance abuse in 
adulthood. Findings of this study suggest that childhood neglect and trauma are implicated 
in the development of depression and METH abuse in MSM populations. We found a 
significant elevation in reported levels of childhood physical, emotional, and sexual abuse 
among meth abusers. Although we cannot absolutely infer causation, the temporal nature of 
the data suggest that childhood abuse, in any form, may be a predisposing factor for abuse of 
METH in adulthood. Data also revealed a strong relationship between METH abuse and 
current levels of depression. Although mild depression has been considered a risk factor for 
drug abuse, future studies will be needed to determine whether childhood abuse is a 
common pathway that leads to the manifestation of METH abuse potential and depression 
later in life.

These findings support the hypothesis that childhood abuse may influence the development 
of mood disorders, risky sexual behavior (i.e., unprotected sexual acts with multiple partners 
while under the influence of alcohol and/or illicit substances) and methamphetamine abuse 
in MSM. It is widely accepted that childhood experiences of abuse alter neurodevelopment 
in enduring ways that can result in predisposition or greater vulnerability for mood disorders 
and anxiety in adulthood (Heim and Nemeroff, 2001; Heim et al., 2009). Various studies 
have documented the comorbidity of mood disorders and METH abuse in MSM (Bousman 
et al., 2009; Carrico et al., 2010; Peck et al., 2005). One of the proposed working hypotheses 
is that METH abuse serves a self-medicating role for adults with comorbid mood disorders 
(Ullman et al., 2013). Several studies have also examined the association between mood 
disorders, METH abuse and risky sexual practices (i.e., unprotected sexual acts with 
multiple partners) that can potentially result in HIV infection (Salomon and Hamelin, 2008). 
These studies have concluded that METH abusing MSM are significantly more likely to 
engage in risky sexual behavior that increases risk of HIV infection. Similarly, there have 
been several studies that have examined the prevalence and association of childhood sexual 
abuse and HIV risk in MSM (Meade et al., 2012). These studies report that childhood sexual 
abuse is four times more prevalent among MSM as compared to heterosexual men 
(Friedman et al., 2011). Compared to MSM without a history of sexual abuse, MSM with 
childhood histories of sexual abuse are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior 
including unprotected sex, greater numbers of casual sexual encounters and greater use of 
substances during sexual encounters (Arreola et al., 2009; Welles et al., 2009; Whetten et al., 
2012). Interestingly, there is a paucity of research investigating the link between childhood 
abuse and METH abuse in adulthood.

Despite a growing literature linking childhood abuse with risky sexual behaviors (i.e., casual 
unprotected sexual encounters with multiple partners), HIV infection and METH abuse, the 
psychological effects of childhood abuse are frequently overlooked in most substance abuse 
intervention studies. In addition to adding to the literature in attempts to elucidate factors 
that predispose one to possible substance abuse, current findings have implications for 
substance abuse interventions targeting meth addiction among MSM. Current METH abuse 
treatments emphasize motivational interviewing techniques, behavior therapy and/or 
adherence to 12 step programs (Rawson et al., 2004, 2006). These interventions have modest 
effectiveness at best. Current findings suggest that this may be partially attributable to the 
fact that many METH abusers are dealing with the ingrained and longstanding effects of 
childhood abuse (Wilson et al., 2014). As such, although there are interventions designed to 
improve psychological functioning in individuals with HIV that abuse other drugs (Seedat, 
2012), there is virtually no intervention that targets the psychological consequences of 
childhood abuse that likely influence risky sexual behavior, development of mood disorders 
and meth abuse (Sikkema et al., 2009). The results of the current study suggest that 
childhood abuse may function as an important variable that must be accounted for and 
directly targeted in order to maximize the effectiveness of current METH abuse treatment 
programs (Washington et al, 2011). These findings also support the need to target childhood 
experiences in the development of METH abuse interventions. Thus, the findings of the 
current study add to a growing body of literature which suggests that addressing childhood 
trauma and current depression may play a key role in enhancing the effectiveness of 
interventions for methamphetamine addiction.

Further research is needed to understand the specific pathways and mechanisms by which 
childhood sexual and physical abuse contributes to increased vulnerability for mood 
disorders, HIV infection and METH abuse. Although ethnicity was not a variable that was 
formally studied, the greater number of non-Caucasian participant meth users as compared 
to non-meth users warrants further study in order to investigate additional socioeconomic 
variables that may influence the development of meth abuse.
