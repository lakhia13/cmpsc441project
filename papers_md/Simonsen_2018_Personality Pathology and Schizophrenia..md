The interaction of personality pathology and schizophrenia 
has  conceptually  been  a  topic  of  considerable  interest  in 
psychiatry.  Recent  advances  in  taxonomy  and  assessment 
of  relevance  to  the  clinician  and  researcher  is  presented. 
Cluster A and avoidant personality disorders are regarded 
as risk factors or antecedents for the development of schiz-
ophrenia.  Some  features  of  borderline  personality  disor-
der may resemble schizophrenia. With both a hierarchical 
structure and symptom-focused classification systems, per-
sonality pathology and personality disorder comorbidities 
can be overlooked. They can remain untreated because they 
are seen as part of the psychotic syndrome or superseded. 
A case formulation of a patient with schizophrenia is likely 
enriched by considering both these facets and may highlight 
comorbid  personality  disorder  that  warrants  independent 
treatment.

Key words:   schizophrenia/personality trait/personality 
disorders/comorbidity/outcome

There  has  been  a  general  lack  of  research  into  the 
comorbidity of personality pathology in schizophrenia.1 
Personality  pathology  can  be,  however,  prevalent  early 
in  the  course  of  illness  and  continues  throughout  the 
lifespan.  This  raises  questions  related  to  diagnosis  and 
taxonomy,  comorbidity,  treatment,  and  future  research 
directions.  Each  of  these  questions  will  be  reviewed  in 
this article, taking a “translation to the clinic” approach 
to the answers.

Conceptualization and Historical Overview of 
Personality Pathology in Schizophrenia

From  the  earliest  descriptions  of  schizophrenia,  impor-
tant  changes  in  personality  were  seen  as  a  fundamental 
part  of  illness  course.  Personality  traits  were  seen  as  a 
premorbid predisposition, or vulnerability, in contrast to 
the  more  florid  state  psychopathology  of  the  psychosis, 

which  may  vary  from  time  to  time.  Emil  Kraepelin  was 
the first to trace the early course of “dementia praecox,” 
coining  the  term  “autistic  temperament”  to  describe  the 
detachment  in  premorbid  personality.2  He  also  consid-
ered personality deterioration inherent in the progress of 
schizophrenia. Kretschmer described different variations 
of liability in emotional expressions (“schizothymia”) and 
relatedness  as  the  hyperaesthetic  (hypersensitive,  avoid-
ant) and anesthetic (hyposensitive, asocial) temperaments. 
Pervasive,  unwarranted  mistrust,  and  hypersensitivity  to 
criticism were also described by him and others,3 noting 
a link between early personality and later psychotic men-
tal disorder. Bleuler further elaborated on these concepts, 
coining the term “schizoid,” used specifically to recognize 
the  premorbid  personality  in  people  who  would  go  on 
to  develop  schizophrenia.  Bleuler4  described  an  anom-
alous  self-experience  and  unstable  sense  of  self/identity 
inherent  to  the  inner  life  of  a  patient  with  schizophre-
nia. Developing this phenomenological tradition, Jasper5 
focused on how a patient’s awareness of his or her own self 
and personality changed over time, with a profound trans-
formation in the psychotic process. The feeling of being 
another  person;  that  personality  disappears  or  different 
personalities are present at different times was described 
as  sentinel  psychopathology  in  psychosis.  This  phenom-
enological  approach  considers  personality  pathology  as 
key to the psychopathology of the schizophrenic process.
These  early  descriptive  psychopathologists  led  to  the 
psychoanalytic  movement  dominating  academic  and 
clinical  thinking  in  the  early  and  mid-twentieth  cen-
tury.  The  concept  of  “borderline  states”  was  developed 
by Hoch and Polatin6 and elaborated by Knight.7 Using 
the Rorschach test, and fueled by the notion of psychotic 
regression, these authors described the “border” between 
psychosis  and  neurosis  filled  with  vivid  fluctuations  of 
symptoms  like:  ego-weakness  with  transient  micro-psy-
choses,  chaotic  organizations  of  sexuality,  deperson-
alization,  and  ideas  of  reference.  The  psychodynamic

nia were revised and adapted by Rado,8 who coined the 
term “schizotype,” an abbreviation of the schizophrenic 
phenotype,  describing  an  inherit  deficiency  for  pleasure 
and distortion of the bodily self.

As the growing emergence of neurobiology and mod-
ern statistical techniques started to shape the modern era 
of  psychiatric  taxonomy,  significant  strides  were  taken 
in applying these to both personality disorder and schiz-
ophrenia.  Meehl  developed  a  diathesis-stress  theory 
of  psychiatric  disorder,  based  on  these  growing  influ-
ences.  He  hypothesized  neurobiological  defects  in  the 
perceptual-cognitive and limbic motivation systems (the 
“schizotaxic” brain) to explain inherit core traits: “cogni-
tive slippage,” anhedonia, ambivalence, and social anxi-
ety  seen  in  patients  that  later  developed  schizophrenia.9 
He also championed the notion of statistical approaches 
to the development of personality taxons, one being the 
schizotypy taxon, a notion expanded on by Lenzenweger 
and  Korfine.10  Zuckerman  included  personality  in  the 
diathesis stress models and distinguished between distal 
stressors  occurring  during  development  and  those  that 
occur  in  proximity  to  the  disorder  and  how  the  inter-
action  of  environmental  factors  and  diathesis  leads  to 
psychosis.11  These  modern  iterations  of  psychiatric  tax-
onomy  saw  a  move  away  from  personality  disturbance 
as a key feature of the development of schizophrenia to 
diagnostic systems with a polythetic approach to classi-
fication, as opposed to the phenomenological tradition. 
This approach leads to clear singular diagnoses and the 
possibility of multi-morbidity. As this classification pre-
dominated,  the  American-Danish  Adoption12  studies 
paved  the  way  for  the  split  of  schizophrenia  spectrum 
personality disorders, introduced in DSM-III in 1980 on 
a separate axis II, where the borderline cases were devel-
oped to be encapsulated as the unstable “borderline per-
sonality disorder,” found within the cluster B personality 
disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder, in cluster 
A. Both noted a psychosis facet, with the former includ-
ing a criterion of transient, stress-related paranoid idea-
tion  or  dissociation  and  the  latter  including  criteria  for 
odd  beliefs  and  magical  thinking,  unusual  perceptual 
experiences,  suspiciousness,  or  paranoid  ideation.  The 
schizoid, paranoid and schizotypal personality disorders, 
and the cluster A disorders, reflect the personality distur-
bances previously described in the psychotic realm.

Modern Taxonomic Approaches

The multi-morbidity issue, made explicit by the differenti-
ating of personality disorder onto axis II in the DSM-IV, 
maybe an artifact of the multiaxial system in DSM, albeit 
a  powerful  modulator  of  clinical  thinking.  However, 
there  is  emerging  research  to  suggest  personality  fac-
ets  and  schizophrenia  are  more  closely  aligned  as  orig-
inally  described  by  the  descriptive  psychopathologists. 

Personality Pathology and Schizophrenia

The transdiagnostic nature of psychopathology suggests 
there may be an underlying factor that accounts for the 
multi-morbidity found generally in major mental illness.

The most cutting edge articulation of this is the HiTOP 
model;  a  multivariate  comorbidity  model.13  The  dimen-
sional hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology is based 
on factor analysis of multiple symptoms from large data-
sets. The model reflects the idea of a continuum between 
milder psychological problems to more severe symptoms 
and  recognizes  dimensions  reflect  differences  in  degree, 
rather than in kind. This allows dimensions to be organ-
ized  into  higher  orders.  The  thought  disorder  spectrum 
was 1 of 5 spectra in the HiTOP model. It includes the 
schizophrenia  spectrum  disorders,  mood  disorders  with 
psychosis,  and  the  cluster  A  personality  disorders.  The 
other spectra are disinhibition, antagonism, somatoform, 
and core internalizing. In a recent study, the thought dis-
order spectrum was subdivided. A detachment spectrum 
included the schizoid, schizotypal, avoidant/social anxi-
ety, paranoid, and psychosis, while a core thought disor-
der spectrum now only consisted of mania and psychosis.14 
The HiTOP model provides a rationale for a dimensional 
diagnosis of personality pathology that would potentially 
provide greater clinical utility in patients with psychotic 
mental disorders, where a personality disorder diagnosis 
is often overlooked. Such approaches are consistent with 
models of psychosis development that have been concep-
tualized elsewhere adding strength to this argument.15

A  further,  albeit  aligned,  model  is  found  in  DSM-5 
as an alternative dimensional model for personality dis-
order  in  section  III:  Emerging  measures  and  models. 
In  this  novel  approach,  a  new  pathological  personality 
model  (Criterion  B)  was  developed  by  the  DSM-5  task 
force16 and operationalized in the Personality Inventory 
for DSM-5 (PID-5). Twenty-five traits are clustered to 5 
order domains: negative affectivity, detachment, antago-
nism, disinhibition, and psychoticism. It identifies 3 traits 
to capture “psychoticism”: eccentric behavior, cognitive/
perceptual  dysregulation,  and  unusual  ideas  and  expe-
riences.  In  a  recent  study,  the  PID-5  psychoticism  has 
been  shown  to  be  associated  with  syndromal  psychosis, 
although  only  unusual  ideas  differed  for  the  psychotic 
group as compared to the nonpsychotic.17

There remains a tension both academically and clini-
cally between statistically driven and prototypic approach 
to  personality  taxonomy.  This  impacts  profoundly  on 
the consideration of personality in schizophrenia in the 
clinical  setting.  Statistical  approaches  provide  a  scien-
tific  rigidity  and  reproducibility  although  comorbidity 
clouds  the  clinical  utility  of  this  approach.  Prototypic 
and  phenomenological  approaches  are  more  contextual 
and provide theoretical understanding, potentially aiding 
formulation and understanding of the individual patient. 
There is, however, little chance randomized trials to guide 
management  using  this  idiosyncratic  approach  will  be 
developed in the near future.

Assessment of Personality Pathology in Schizophrenia

Current  diagnostic  conceptualizations  have  tended  to 
downplay the importance of formulation, particularly in 
relation  to  prototypical  narrative  descriptions,  focusing 
instead  on  a  list  of  symptoms.  Although  current  diag-
nostic lexicons do not favor one diagnosis over another, 
enabling  consideration  of  personality  disorder  in  the 
development  and  perpetuation  of  psychotic  mental  ill-
ness, this shift has led to a drift away from considerations 
of personality in schizophrenia diagnosis. There are sev-
eral challenges in the assessment of personality disorder 
in schizophrenia, not the least being the focus of assess-
ment.  The  latter  primarily  considers  symptoms,  while 
the former focuses on maladaptive interpersonal behav-
ior,  views  of  self  and  others,  emotional  understanding, 
impulse  control  and  impact  on  social  functioning.  In 
busy in- and outpatient settings, it is difficult to find the 
time to adequately assess both in detail, and it is perhaps 
unsurprising  that  focusing  on  the  more  “ununderstand-
able” disorder, and one with a strong evidence-based tra-
dition  of  psychopharmacology,  takes  precedence.  This, 
of  course,  significantly  disadvantages  the  patient  and 
time needs to be found, likely at several reviews, to appro-
priately formulate the development of psychopathology 
and  the  interactions  between  patient,  others,  and  the 
world. Although a myriad of factors are important, some 
provide  a  stronger  sense  of  schizophrenia  alone  or  the 
presence of a comorbid personality disorder. This allows 
an idiographic clinical approach to be based on current 
conceptualizations.

Against this background a careful examination of per-
sonality  traits  prior  to  the  onset  of  psychosis  will  help 
to  delineate  the  general  personality  profile.  Personality 
assessment, as other evaluations like neuropsychological, 
should take place at an optimal time when the patient’s 
acute  psychotic  symptoms  are  remitted,  usually  within 
the first three months with less distortion of reality. One 
should  also  be  aware  that  neuropsychological  deficits 
might  impinge  on  personality.  Assessment  focused  on 
the most likely to be present from schizotypy: paranoid, 
avoidant,  and  borderline  personality  disorders  is  war-
ranted. As insight into the functional disturbance caused 
by these characteristics may be unclear or minimized by 
the patient themselves, collateral history from family and 
those close to the patient is important.

Diagnostic  differentiation  between  schizophrenia,  the 
psychosis  prone  schizotypal  personality  disorder,  and 
borderline  personality  disorder  is  important.  Patients 
with personality disorder can generally correct psychotic 
distortion of reality related to stress, particularly as the 
stress  abates.  The  quality  of  the  psychotic  experience 
also  generally  differs.  The  loss  of  reality  in  personality 
disorder  commonly  has  a  dissociative  element,  lacking 
the  bizarre  nature  of  many  of  the  positive  symptoms 
in  schizophrenia.  As  with  all  phenomenology,  there  are 

1182

no pathognomonic experiences to ensure differentiation 
and clinical acumen will ultimately drive diagnostic deci-
sion  making.  The  dissociated  phenomenon  have  other 
contexts,18  and  preliminary  findings  also  indicate  that 
self-disturbance in those with an ultra-high risk for psy-
chosis  are  different  from  that  of  borderline  personality 
disorder.19

Other  self-reported  psychotic-like  experiences  found 
in  borderline  personality  disorder  have  similarities  with 
schizophrenia,  like  the  unstable  self-image  or  sense  of 
self  and  feelings  of  emptiness.  Although  these  similari-
ties exist, profound phenomenological differences clearly 
mark  out  borderline  personality  disorder  as  different 
from  schizophrenia.  For  example,  patients  with  border-
line  personality  disorder  are  sensitive  to  other  people’s 
attitudes  and  have  a  stable  low  self-esteem  rather  than 
the  psychotic  patient’s  experience  of  a  lack  of  nucleus 
of  the  self.20  Patients  with  borderline  personality  disor-
der  experience  feelings  of  emptiness  as  an  internalized 
sense of oneself as not being cared for, while in the psy-
chotic  patient  is  a  profound,  constant  threat  of  loss  of 
being  in  the  world.  The  clinician  should  also  be  aware 
that  the  psychotic  experiences  seen  in  borderline  per-
sonality disorders may be part of a co-morbid affective 
psychosis, substance abuse, side-effects of medication or 
antecedent  for  what  is  actually  only  later  diagnosed  as 
schizophrenia.21

Premorbid and Comorbid Personality Pathology

Empirical data examining early personality traits and later 
schizophrenia  are  sparse.  Longitudinal  cohorts  require 
significant  detail  to  account  for  the  multiple  potential 
covariates  that  are  likely  to  impact  on  both  disorders. 
What research there is indicates a significant and probable 
causal association,22 albeit more explicit evidence is early 
in development. Using NEO-PI-R high neuroticism and 
low extroversion seem to predict the onset of schizophre-
nia.23 This is not surprising as neuroticism is a predictor 
for most psychiatric illness, and may simply suggest a high 
propensity for later mental illness generally.

An  alternative  method  for  examining  premorbid  per-
sonality is to directly ask patients.24 Despite the recall bias 
problem, patients describe a schizophrenic illness as hav-
ing a negative impact on their personality with maladap-
tive traits increasing over time. This implies and iterative 
process between early personality structure and psycho-
sis  whereby  the  former  predisposes  to  the  latter,  which 
impairs the former and so on. Such a theory has impor-
tant potential clinical implications as a focus solely on the 
psychosis elements of illness will not address personality 
pathology, which in turn may to lead to a degree of treat-
ment resistance. In general, it is true that the variation of 
phenotypes in schizophrenia is reflected in the variation 
in  premorbid  pathological  personality  traits,  but  endo-
phenotypic  manifestations  are  most  commonly  in  the 

cluster A presentations, with some evidence for elements 
of avoidance from cluster B.25,26 This mirrors the histori-
cal conceptualizations of personality discussed above.

Prevalence  rates  of  personality  disorders  in  schizo-
phrenia vary widely, however, the median rate of ~40% is 
similar to that of other severe mental disorders diagnoses 
and infers a relationship between personality pathology 
and schizophrenia.1 It is not possible currently to identify 
which personality subtype occurs most frequently. Studies 
of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and 
Related  Conditions  (NESARC)  would  suggest  a  higher 
prevalence  rate  of  60%,27  although  this  may  underplay 
the functional problems of personality disorder account-
ing for the higher rated.

One  hypothetical  reason  for  the  association  between 
personality disorder and schizophrenia is the possibility 
of an underlying characteristic(s) or trait(s) that increase 
the  likelihood  of  developing  both  disorders  independ-
ently,  as  opposed  to  personality  problems  in  early  life 
leading to schizophrenia. This cannot be tested by exam-
ining the prevalence data, but raises questions as to the 
interconnectedness  of  psychopathology,  early  personal-
ity traits, and later diagnosis and potential genetic contri-
butions to both diagnoses.

Treatment of Personality Disorder in Patients With 
Schizophrenia

Currently,  there  is  no  empirical  evidence  to  guide  the 
management of comorbid schizophrenia and personality 
disorder treatment and, therefore, a pragmatic approach 
is  required.  As  discussed,  it  makes  little  empirical  sense 
to treat the schizophrenia without examining personality 
to assess if there are personality diatheses worsening the 
severity  of  the  psychotic  experience.  If  this  is  the  case, 
and undiscovered, a failure or limited partial response to 
treatment for the psychosis may be interpreted as treat-
ment resistance, when in fact it indicates continued per-
sonality pathology.

Best  evidence  suggests  psychotherapy  is  the  most 
appropriate  first  line  treatment  for  personality  disor-
der, in particular borderline PD, and consideration of a 
management plan that incorporates elements of person-
ality focused therapy may assist in effective intervention 
in  schizophrenia  is  such  circumstances.28  Notably,  ther-
apy  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  itself  has  devel-
oped  a  sound  research  base,  and  should  comorbidity 
exist  this  would  suggest  a  psychotherapeutic  approach 
is warranted. Accepting the lack of empirical guidance, 
an “n = 1” approach to treatment should be undertaken 
with interventions regularly assessed and clear outcomes 
monitored  for.  Although  other  research  suggests  the 
management  of  serious  mental  illness  is  worsened  by 
comorbid  personality  pathology,  we  do  not  have  clear 
evidence of this in schizophrenia and this is an area for 

Personality Pathology and Schizophrenia

future research, as is the development of treatments for 
this comorbidity.

Clinical Implications and Challenges for Future 
Research

Personality  pathology  is  historically  part  of  the  schizo-
phrenia concept: as a disposition, the description of the 
prototype  itself  or  as  complication.  Cluster  A  person-
ality  disorders  and  avoidant  personality  disorder  seem 
most commonly to antedate schizophrenia. No common 
dimensions have so far been identified by factor analytic 
methods albeit a schizotypy taxon may be the strongest 
link candidate. Comorbid personality disorders may have 
significant  detrimental  effects  on  the  course  of  schizo-
phrenia as occurs in other serious mental illness. To this 
end, a thorough assessment of personality should be an 
integral part of a schizophrenia assessment, should occur 
early and iteratively. In the absence of empirical evidence, 
carefully  tailored  idiosyncratic  interventions  need  to  be 
developed. Future research should guide this treatment, 
improving the lives of those with schizophrenia and per-
sonality disorder.
