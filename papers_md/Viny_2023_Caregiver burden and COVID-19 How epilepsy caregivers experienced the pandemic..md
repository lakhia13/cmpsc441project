Introduction: Caregivers of adults with epilepsy face unique challenges, yet most studies focus on the
impact of epilepsy on those living with the condition, rather than the impact on caregivers. Our objective
was to evaluate whether caregivers’ pandemic-related changes and experiences – namely those related to
their health, healthcare access, and well-being – were associated with their caregiving burden.
Methods: Caregivers of adults with epilepsy (n = 261) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to partic-
ipate in an online survey examining health, well-being, COVID-19 experiences, and caregiver burden
from October-December, 2020. The burden was measured using the Zarit 12-item measure; the clinically
signiﬁcant burden was deﬁned as a score greater than 16. Adjustments were made to account for burden
scores related to exposures of interest. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and generalized linear regression models
were used to compare cross-sectional associations between COVID-19 experiences and burden.
Results: Over half (57.9%) of caregivers had clinically signiﬁcant caregiver burden. Most reported
increased anxiety (65%), stress (64%), and sense of social isolation (58%) during the pandemic. Many care-
givers reported that their sense of control over their life (44%) and their use of healthcare changed (88%)
due to COVID-19. In adjusted models, caregivers who reported increased anger, increased anxiety,
decreased sense of control, or changes in healthcare utilization during COVID-19 had about twice the
odds of having clinically signiﬁcant caregiver burden compared to caregivers who did not report changes.
Discussion: Changes experienced by caregivers of adults with epilepsy during the pandemic were
strongly associated with clinically signiﬁcant levels of caregiver burden. These ﬁndings demonstrate
the link between mass-level events, such as a pandemic, the burden caregivers of adults with epilepsy
may carry, and subsequent psychological outcomes.
Conclusion: Caregivers of adults with epilepsy may need support to reduce the negative impact of COVID-
19-related experiences and should be connected to healthcare and resources that can help alleviate their
burden.

1. Introduction

Despite epilepsy being a well-recognized neurological condition,
few studies are focused on the health and quality of life (QOL) of fam-
ily and friends providing care for people with epilepsy [1,2]. The total
impact of epilepsy is more commonly discussed in terms of the
patient and rarely accounts for the impact on families, caregivers,
or the communities in which persons with epilepsy live [3]. The bur-

dens of caregiving on one’s support system include the chronicity of
epilepsy, which often extends caregiving duties to family members,
friends, and at times, persons from the public, who may be called
upon to care for an individual experiencing a seizure [4]. Caring for
someone with a chronic condition such as epilepsy may uniquely
burden caregivers due to the complexity and pervasive nature of
symptoms [2,3]. Caregiver burden may be described as the level of
multifaceted strain perceived by the caregiver as a result of provid-
ing care for a family member or loved one over time [5], often in an
informal manner [6]. The responsibilities of caring for a person with
epilepsy may include managing stress related to the stigma associ-
ated with an epilepsy diagnosis, particularly if the care recipient is
a family member; seizure unpredictability [7] (i.e., seizure burden)
and associated fear of injury or death [8]; caring for symptoms of
epilepsy and psychological comorbidity [2]; economic burden, and

the clinical impacts on caregivers themselves (e.g., depression, anx-
iety, insomnia) [9]. While the relationship between caregiving and
health is generally associated with stress [10], it is crucial to under-
stand other factors that contribute to the overall burden experi-
enced by epilepsy caregivers and how their well-being is affected
over the course of their caregiving role [10,11]. The ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic [12] has posed and continues to pose, unprece-
dented challenges to caregivers of all types of conditions [13],
including epilepsy. A deeper understanding of the current factors
inﬂuencing the health, well-being, and QOL of epilepsy caregivers
is necessary to provide valuable insights into these circumstances,
and ultimately to address high levels of caregiver burden in both
pandemic and non-pandemic settings.

Most studies of epilepsy caregiver burden examine adults caring
for children and adolescents with epilepsy, subsequently limiting
our understanding of how burden may present in caregivers of
adults with epilepsy. Indeed, the current literature on these care-
givers demonstrates the burden to present differently when com-
pared to caregivers of children or adolescents with epilepsy
[9,14,15]. While one study found that caregivers of children with
epilepsy were signiﬁcantly more likely to report stress-related
comorbidities compared to caregivers of adults with epilepsy [9],
different challenges and demands can arise for caregivers of adults
with epilepsy, such as increased burden and stigma [14,16]. Further-
more, caregivers of adults with epilepsy may be experiencing more
of their own chronic health conditions (e.g., aging parents) and
adults with epilepsy often have more variable levels of social sup-
port and caregiver networks than children since caregivers may
include not only parents but romantic partners and friends [16].
These caregivers may have their own interactions and relationships,
which in turn impact the family functioning. The unpredictability of
seizures is one stressor that epilepsy caregivers of children and
adults both share [8,17]. Nonetheless, existing literature shows that
caregivers of adults with epilepsy often face signiﬁcant impacts that
can negatively inﬂuence their health and well-being.

Recent studies on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted
caregivers have found that caregivers regularly reported signiﬁcant
concern about being infected or their care recipient becoming
infected, routine medical appointments being canceled or post-
poned, and an increased fear of seeking medical attention due to
exposure to the virus [13,18]. Additionally, communication and
coordination difﬁculties with healthcare providers proved to be a
common theme reported among caregivers during the pandemic
[13,19]. In a German study of informal caregivers [20], it was found
that across indicators of care involvement, many reported that
their care situation worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.
These changes and restrictions resulting from the pandemic may
generate additional burdens among caregivers.

The goal of this study was to provide a window into the impact
of COVID-19 on caregivers of adults with epilepsy. Our objective
was to evaluate whether caregivers’ pandemic-related changes
and experiences – namely those related to their health, healthcare
access, and well-being – were associated with their caregiving bur-
den. We hypothesized that caregivers who reported negative
impacts of COVID-19 would also report clinically signiﬁcant levels
of burden more often than their caregiving peers who had not
experienced negative changes due to the pandemic.

2. Methods

2.1. Study design

This cross-sectional, anonymous survey study used Qualtrics
XM(cid:1), a national survey company, to collect data from a cohort of
caregivers of adults with epilepsy. The study procedures were

2

reviewed and determined to be non-human subjects research by
the University of Utah Institutional Review Board.

2.1.1. Participants

Participants were recruited using Qualtrics Panel, an online sur-
vey platform that maintains a database of millions of U.S. residents
who have previously volunteered to participate in survey-based
studies. Panel members were invited to participate in the survey
through an e-mail invitation, which included a link that redirected
them to the study’s page. The landing page included information
about the study’s design, purpose, risks, and beneﬁts. Consent to
participate was provided by checking a box indicating consent
before proceeding with the survey. Qualtrics prioritized recruiting
respondents from the general U.S. population whose demographics
aligned with the survey criteria based on a screener provided prior
to the survey. Respondents were at least 18 years old and had to be
a caregiver of an adult (age 18 years or older) with epilepsy.

2.1.2. Survey administration

The survey was administered online from October to December
2020. Response requirements and validation features were used to
alert respondents about questions they may have missed. After
completing the survey, participants were compensated in the form
and amount agreed on when they joined the panel. Deidentiﬁed
survey data were provided to the research team.

2.2. Measures

The survey inquired about caregiver burden, COVID-19 experi-
ences, physical and mental health, and sociodemographic
characteristics.

2.2.1. Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI-12)

This is a valid and reliable 12-item self-report scale that
assesses the subjective burden experienced by informal caregivers
[21]. Due to a lack of epilepsy-speciﬁc caregiver burden question-
naires, the Zarit caregiver burden inventory was used to measure
burden among epilepsy caregivers, consistent with previous stud-
ies [16,22]. Items cover the most commonly mentioned problems
by caregivers including the caregiver’s health, psychological well-
being, ﬁnances, social life, and the relationship between the care-
giver and the care recipient [21,23]. Scores range from 0 to 48;
higher scores indicate a higher burden, and a score >16 suggests
a clinically signiﬁcant caregiver burden [23–25]. We calculated
mean burden scores and categorized caregivers as either having
clinically signiﬁcant burdens or non-clinically signiﬁcant burden.
One of the exposures of interest is a sense of control, which also
is one of the items in the Zarit-12. Therefore, we conducted a sen-
sitivity analysis for the change in sense of control exposure in
which we removed this item from the burden score calculation
and adjusted the cut point for the clinically signiﬁcant burden to
>15. The Cronbach’s a for the Zarit-12 was .93 with all items and
.91 for the 11-item version of the scale, which both indicate high
internal consistency.

2.2.2. COVID-19 Experiences

Based on ﬁndings identifying 21 unique experiences from stud-
ies conducted during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic
[26,27], we created a measure that asks respondents to indicate if
they have been affected by these areas of interest, and to what
extent. Caregivers were asked if they noticed an increase, decrease,
or no change (see Appendix A for the entire measure). For this
study, we focused on items that may be expected to relate to bur-
dens such as anger, anxiety, and stress [28–30] as well as health-
care utilization [31], social isolation [32], sense of control over
their life [33,34], and substance use [35–37]. For each item, we cre-

M. Viny, A.Y. Trevino, E.D. Bouldin et al.

Epilepsy & Behavior 141 (2023) 109151

ated a binary variable to indicate caregivers who experienced a
negative change versus a neutral or positive change. For example,
caregivers who reported an increase in anger were classiﬁed as
having a negative change, whereas no change in health care utiliza-
tion was classiﬁed as a positive outcome.

2.2.3. The Veterans RAND 12 (VR-12)

The Veterans RAND 12 (VR-12) is a patient-reported instrument
comprised of 12 items used to derive physical and emotional com-
ponent scores [38]. For this study, we utilized the mental (MCS)
and physical component scores (PCS) to assess cognitive and phys-
ical functioning, limitations, pain, energy, mental health, social
functioning, and overall health [39]. Physical component scores
and MCS scores are derived using an algorithm that is referenced
to a metric centered at 50.0 using the 2000–2002 US Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey population [38]. To obtain a broad idea
of what caregivers’ health statuses were at the time of survey com-
pletion, we utilized these component scores to better interpret the
mental and physical health among caregivers [38,40,41].

2.2.4. Diagnosed health conditions

Diagnosed health conditions were measured by asking respon-
dents to identify all conditions they have been diagnosed with by
their healthcare provider. These conditions (See Appendix B) were
chosen based on the most commonly diagnosed conditions among
both epilepsy patients and caregivers [42,43]. To analyze the bur-
den associated with health conditions, we calculated the mean
number of conditions caregivers reported. Non-responses were
assumed to indicate that caregivers were not living with the condi-
tions at the time of survey completion. In addition to chronic
health conditions, caregivers were asked to indicate whether they
had ever been diagnosed with COVID-19.

2.2.5. Sociodemographic characteristics

Sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from the survey
to create a better understanding of the cohort. The information
gathered from this survey included age, gender, education, and
ﬁnancial status. Categories were created for these demographics
based on the general characteristics of the study population (see
Table 1). Age was collected and measured in years and was then
grouped into categories relevant to the age distribution of partici-
pants. Education levels were combined to classify a participant as
having a high school degree or lower or having some college edu-
cation or a college degree. To measure ﬁnancial changes during
COVID-19, participants were asked to indicate their household’s
ﬁnancial situation (See Table 1). The six original options were clas-
siﬁed in one of the following three ways to gauge ﬁnancial difﬁcul-
ties: having enough money to pay the bills, having less difﬁculty
paying the bills, and having difﬁculty paying the bills.

2.3. Data analyses

First, we calculated means and proportions to describe the over-
all sample of caregivers and the characteristics of caregivers with
and without clinically signiﬁcant burden levels. We used t-tests
to compare continuous measures and chi-square tests to compare
categorical measures for caregivers with and without clinically sig-
niﬁcant burden. We used a generalized linear model with a bino-
mial family and logit link for regression analyses. We ran both
crude models and models adjusted for age, sex, education, and
ﬁnancial status. An alpha value of 0.05 was used to indicate statis-
tical signiﬁcance. Descriptive analyses were conducted in SPSS and
inferential analyses were conducted within R Studio/SAS.

3. Results

3.1. Background and demographic data

A total of 261 caregivers of adults with epilepsy completed the
survey. The sample was relatively young (mean 33 years of age)
with the majority being women, white, and non-Hispanic. How-
ever, nearly 21% were Hispanic, 18% were Black, and 5% were
Native American/American Indian (see Table 1). Over 65% had
some college or more education, and 24% reported having difﬁculty
paying the bills no matter what they do, suggesting serious ﬁnan-
cial difﬁculties.

3.2. General health status

At the time of survey completion, the average PCS and MCS
among caregivers of adults with epilepsy were 43.9 (SD = 9.3)
and 36.7 (SD = 11.9), respectively. This indicates that physical
and mental health reported by caregivers was poorer than the gen-
eral population, with physical health reported as slightly better
than mental health overall.

3.3. Comorbidities

Full details of self-reported health conditions among caregivers
can be found in Fig. 1. In general, the prevalence of chronic health
conditions was relatively low; however, about one-third (35%) of
caregivers reported having had a diagnosis of migraines/-
headaches, and a quarter (26%) reported having high blood pres-
sure. About 10% of caregivers had been diagnosed with COVID-19.

3.4. Caregiver burden

The average score for caregiver burden among respondents was
18.7 with a standard deviation of 10.2. More than half of the care-
givers in our sample (57.9%, n = 151) met the criteria for clinically
signiﬁcant burden (see Table 2).

3.5. COVID-19 experiences

Fig. 2 shows the percent of caregivers in the sample experienced
change in each COVID-19 stressor. In crude models, caregivers who
reported increased anger increased anxiety, a decreased sense of
control, or a change in their use of physical or mental healthcare
during COVID-19 had about twice the odds of having clinically sig-
niﬁcant caregiver burdens as caregivers who did not report these
changes (OR = 1.99, OR = 2.32, OR = 2.16, OR = 2.18, and
OR = 2.81 respectively; Table 3). In adjusted models, these changes
remained statistically signiﬁcant, and point estimates indicated
slightly stronger associations
(increased anger OR = 2.14,
p = 0.006; increased anxiety OR = 2.44, p = 0.001; a decreased sense
of control OR = 2.16, p = 0.004; change in physical healthcare use
OR = 2.85, p = 0.002; change in mental healthcare use OR = 2.81,
p < 0.001). In the sensitivity analysis for a decreased sense of con-
trol, in which we excluded the item about control from the burden
score, the association was attenuated slightly but remained statis-
tically signiﬁcant (adjusted OR = 2.16, 95% CI, p = 0.004). There
isolation, or
were no associations between increased social
increased stress, with caregiver burden in either crude or adjusted
models.

4. Discussion

The current study offered an unprecedented examination of the
relationship between pandemic-related outcomes and caregiver

burden among caregivers of adults with epilepsy. Extant literature
on caregiver experiences of adults with epilepsy, particularly care-
giver burden, is scarce; subsequently limiting our knowledge of the
experiences of this population [10,15]. Thus, ﬁndings illuminate
the unique ways in which burden may present among caregivers
of adults with epilepsy. The sample of the current study was rela-
tively large in comparison to existing studies on caregivers of
adults with epilepsy, illustrating a noted strength of the present
investigation. Additionally, the current study measured speciﬁc
impacts of the pandemic, capturing the experiences of caregivers
during a pivotal moment in history. Thus, targeted examination
of pandemic-related outcomes and caregiver burden better discern
how distress manifested for this population during this time.

This study presents evidence that caregivers of adults with epi-
lepsy experienced the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that inﬂu-
enced their well-being and burden. We found that four speciﬁc
experiences during the pandemic – more anger, more anxiety, less
sense of control, and changes in the amount of healthcare – were
strongly associated with clinically signiﬁcant levels of caregiver
burden. Our ﬁndings expand on the current literature that demon-
strates the link between caregiver burden and psychological dis-
tress (e.g., anxiety- and depressive symptoms) of those who care
for adults with epilepsy [44] while attuning to speciﬁc
pandemic-related outcomes, such as decreased sense of control
of one’s life. The COVID-19 pandemic has been described as a col-
lective trauma, a mass-scale disruption to safety, and a sense of

control that impacts the mental health and well-being of individu-
als and communities [45]. Contextualizing our ﬁndings in the time
period that data was collected illuminates several pandemic-
related milestones that occurred in the U.S. which may have exac-
erbated feelings of powerlessness and other forms of psychological
distress, such as increased food insecurity, rapid increase in
COVID-19 death tolls (an increase of approximately 100,000 deaths
between October and December 2020), and the ﬁrst issuances of
Emergency Use Authorizations of two COVID-19 vaccines that
were limited in supply [46]. Participants in our sample also indi-
cated substantial ﬁnancial distress during the pandemic, which
may further reﬂect the ﬁnancial difﬁculties experienced by the col-
lective during this time. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the

5

link between mass-level events, the burden caregivers of adults
with epilepsy may carry, and subsequent psychological outcomes.
The ﬁndings among this sample of informal caregivers are consis-
tent with studies demonstrating the negative impact of caring for
patients during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and
the effect of formal healthcare providers [47–49].

In addition to psychological distress, elevated levels of burden
have been associated with negative health and quality of life out-
comes for epilepsy caregivers [2,50–52]. Our study found that
the perceived burden was notably high during the pandemic and
was related to pandemic-related changes. Burden in the caregiving
relationship also appears to be a dyadic experience, with recent
ﬁndings illustrating mutually burdensome aspects for caregivers
and adults with epilepsy, such as reliance on the caregiver, the
assumed responsibility of the caregiver on the adult with epilepsy,
setting and maintaining boundaries, and protecting one another
through caregiver supervision or patient concealment of symp-
toms [53]. Therefore, maintaining low levels of burden not only
holds health and relational implications for both caregiver and
recipient but may also help to enable people living with epilepsy
to remain in the community. Our ﬁndings contribute to the sparse
literature on caregivers of adults with epilepsy and literature on
the impacts of COVID-19 on informal caregivers. Consistent with
other caregiving research, we found COVID-19 increased caregiver
distress and burden [13,18–20] and speciﬁcally for caregivers of
adults with epilepsy. Because epilepsy can affect both adults with
epilepsy and their informal caregivers [8], it is crucial to under-
stand how caring for individuals with epilepsy can inﬂuence care-
givers, and how these inﬂuences differ compared to caregivers of
children or adolescents with epilepsy. By understanding how the
burden manifests differently among caregivers of children with
epilepsy versus adults, clinicians can provide information and
resources to both the caregivers and patients with the goal of
reducing cumulative burden. These results suggest that interven-
tions could be developed to reduce caregiver burden, which in turn
could improve outcomes for both adults with epilepsy and their
caregivers. One potential approach could include testing an exist-
ing intervention among caregivers of adults with epilepsy, such
as the Building Better Caregivers (BBC) [54] program, which offers
training on how caregivers can provide better care, and how they
can effectively manage their own emotions, stress, and physical
health.

and care recipient communities such as immigrant communities,
communities of color, rural or remote communities, and lower-
educated communities. This study also was cross-sectional and
so we do not know what caregiver’s burden levels were before
the pandemic, which could have moderated the impact of the pan-
demic itself. This limitation highlights the need for routine data
collection among a variety of types of caregivers so that the
impacts of large-scale events and public health crises can be fully
evaluated. Surveys were conducted anonymously so we do not
know whether multiple caregivers responded for the same care
recipient. Finally, the survey did not include all aspects of caregiv-
ing or of the care recipient’s epilepsy or context that might impact
the burden, including the relationship between the caregiver and
care recipient, the amount of time the caregiver provided care,
the type of epilepsy the care recipient had, or whether the care-
giver and care recipient lived in a rural area. These areas and their
potential impact on the experience of caregiver burden should be
explored in future studies.

5. Conclusion

COVID-19 had negative impacts on caregivers of adults with
epilepsy: caregivers experienced changes in a variety of areas,
and several of these – anger, anxiety, sense of control, and changes
in healthcare use – were associated with clinically signiﬁcant care-
giver burden. It is unclear whether these caregivers will need addi-
tional support
to return to pre-pandemic emotional states;
however, given the substantial levels of clinically signiﬁcant bur-
den, these caregivers likely would beneﬁt from interventions to
reduce this burden. These data suggest that public health efforts
to support caregivers in general and in future pandemics or public
health emergencies, in particular, are needed in order to maintain
their health and well-being and that of the people for whom they
provide care.

Acknowledgements

One study limitation was the recruitment through the Qualtrics
Panel, which yielded a sample that was predominately white,
young, educated women with relatively high ﬁnancial security.
This may be an artifact of the types of people that Qualtrics Panels
appeal to and from which Qualtrics Panels recruit. As such, our
ﬁndings may have limited generalizability to diverse caregiving
