Trauma-related pathological dissociation is characterized by disruptions in one’s sense of self, perceptual, and affective experience.
Dissociation and its trauma-related antecedents disproportionately impact women. However, despite the gender-related
prevalence and high individual and societal costs, dissociation remains widely underappreciated in clinical practice. Moreover,
dissociation lacks a synthesized neurobiological model across its subtypes. Leveraging the Triple Network Model of
psychopathology, we sought to parse heterogeneity in dissociative experience by examining functional connectivity of three core
neurocognitive networks as related to: (1) the dimensional dissociation subtypes of depersonalization/derealization and partially-
dissociated intrusions; and, (2) the diagnostic category of dissociative identity disorder (DID). Participants were 91 women with and
without: a history of childhood trauma, current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and varied levels of dissociation. Participants
provided clinical data about dissociation, PTSD symptoms, childhood maltreatment history, and completed a resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. We used a novel statistical approach to assess both overlapping and unique
contributions of dissociation subtypes. Covarying for age, childhood maltreatment and PTSD severity, we found dissociation was
linked to hyperconnectivity within central executive (CEN), default (DN), and salience networks (SN), and decreased connectivity of
CEN and SN with other areas. Moreover, we isolated unique connectivity markers associated with depersonalization/derealization in
CEN and DN, to partially-dissociated intrusions in CEN, and to DID in CEN. This suggests dissociation subtypes have robust
functional connectivity signatures that may serve as targets for PTSD/DID treatment engagement. Our ﬁndings underscore
dissociation assessment as crucial in clinical care, in particular, to reduce gender-related health disparities.

INTRODUCTION
Pathological dissociation, the experience of detachment from or
discontinuity in one’s internal experience, sense of self, or
surroundings [1],
is a common experience in the aftermath of
trauma [2, 3]. However, symptoms of trauma-related pathological
dissociation and dissociative disorders remain at best under-

misdiagnosed [4, 5]. Clinical misunderstanding about dissociation

historically longstanding and rooted largely in an individual and
societal reluctance to acknowledge the prevalence of childhood
abuse and domestic violence and its impact,
in particular, on
women [4, 6]. The cost of this stigmatization and misunderstand-
ing is high: it has prevented people from accessing appropriate
and effective treatment, prolonged suffering, and stunted

stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder (DID)

stand these conditions, and how best to treat them.

Psychological research embracing trauma-related pathological
dissociation has determined that it encompasses a range of
experiences or “subtypes” [8]. Subtypes like depersonalization and
derealization are frequent experiences in both the dissociative
subtype of PTSD and DID [1]. Depersonalization and derealization
involve feelings of detachment or disconnection from one’s sense
of self, body and environment [1]. Individuals report feeling like
their body or surroundings are unreal or like they are in a movie.
Dissociation also includes experiences of self-alteration common
in DID in which people lose a sense of agency and ownership over
their thoughts, emotions, actions and body [9]. With this loss of
agency and ownership, people then experience some thoughts,
emotions etc. as partially-dissociated intrusions [9].
Individuals
report feeling like they are hearing voices or that their thoughts,
emotions, and actions emerge without their control and ‘intrude’
on their conscious experience. Importantly, these intrusions are
characterized as partially-dissociated rather
than psychotic

subjectively feels “as if” the experiences do not belong to them [9].
Both depersonalization, derealization, and experiences of self-
alteration can help people cope in the face of inescapable threat
and trauma [10]. However, they can also impede one’s ability to
function and can interfere with new emotional learning [11]. This
adds urgency to our need to better understand mechanisms of
dissociation so we can enhance interventions that will ameliorate
these symptoms.

Brain-based measures of dissociation can provide scientiﬁc
evidence for the validity of these experiences and can link the
clinical phenomenology with biological mechanisms. While
foundational studies have begun to characterize the neurobiology
of dissociation [12–14], the ﬁeld lacks a synthesized model across
the range of dissociative experiences that could place it in context
with other common psychiatric conditions. This gap in our
knowledge about experiences that disproportionately impact
women [15–17] contributes to gender-related health disparities
and must be addressed to help eliminate this inequity.

The Triple Network model of psychopathology may provide a
synthesized neurobiological model for pathological dissociation.
This model offers an integrative framework based in systems
neuroscience for understanding cognitive and affective dysfunc-
tion across psychiatric conditions [18]. The basic model implicates
altered intrinsic organization and interactions between three
large-scale brain networks across disorders: the right-lateralized
central executive network (rCEN), the medial temporal subnetwork
of the default network (tDN), and the cingulo-opercular subnet-
work of the SN (cSN; Fig. S1).

These three networks serve complementary functions. The
rCEN, a lateral frontoparietal network,
is strongly implicated in
cognitive processes such as reasoning, attention, inhibition, and
memory [19, 20]. The rCEN is distinct from left CEN, which is
primarily involved in language processing [19, 20]. Conversely,
tDN, a medial
involved in
frontoparietal network [21],
autobiographical memory, recollection of events in one’s past
(i.e., episodic memory retrieval) and simulating future events
[22–25]. Lastly, cSN, a midcingulo-insular network [21], is involved
in interoception, especially the experience of emotion derived
from information about the internal milieu [26]. These subnet-
works are easily identiﬁed using group independent component
analysis and are highly reproducible [19, 20, 27].

is

Altered organization and interaction between CEN, DN, and SN
are consistently reported across psychiatric disorders [18]. Central
to these alterations is improper assignment of
relevance or
salience to either internal or external stimuli [18]. Inappropriate
salience detection,
failing to assign relevance to something
important or assigning relevance to something unnecessarily,
can create a cascade effect where the CEN and DN do not engage
or disengage appropriately. Depending on the subtype of
pathological dissociation (e.g., depersonalization/derealization,
partially-dissociated intrusions etc.),
these symptoms could
involve inappropriate salience detection in either direction, and

concomitant alterations

Neuroimaging work to date implicates altered connectivity
of regions in all three networks [12, 14, 28]. These studies typically
focus on dissociative symptoms of depersonalization and derea-
lization—with both seed-based and group independent compo-
nent analysis functional connectivity ﬁndings in the dissociative
subtype of PTSD highlighting altered connectivity of regions
located in the SN, DN, and CEN (e.g., amygdala, insula, prefrontal
and parietal cortex [12, 29, 30]). One study from our team
in CEN and DN
found that hyperconnectivity of

that combined scores of depersonalization, derealization, and
partially-dissociated intrusions

subtype, and DID sample [31]. Relatedly, there is also foundational
work implicating altered activity in these networks in PTSD [12]

regions

and DID [13, 32–37]. Taken together, these ﬁndings cover a range
of dissociation subtypes; however, they do not directly compare
different subtypes. The unique contributions of different dissocia-
tion subtypes to altered connectivity in the three core networks of
the Triple Network model are unknown. Parsing heterogeneity in
dissociation could add signiﬁcant impact to our understanding of
differences in both illness and treatment
trajectories across
individuals – and represents the critical next step in advancing
personalized medicine for dissociative symptoms.

related to different

To address this gap, we assessed the connectivity of rCEN, tDN,
and cSN as
subtypes of pathological
dissociation: the dimensional symptoms of depersonalization/
derealization and partially-dissociated intrusions, and the diag-
nostic category of DID. Notably, we used a novel method for
assessing both overlapping and unique contributions of different
dissociation types [38]. Given prior work both in dissociation and
the Triple Network model of psychopathology, we hypothesized
all three networks would be implicated in dissociation and unique
patterns of connectivity would emerge for each dissociative
subtype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
A total of 132 adult women with and without histories of childhood
trauma, current PTSD, and varied levels of dissociative symptoms were
enrolled in this cross-sectional study. A total of 23 were excluded based on
our exclusion criteria, including standard contraindications to MRI, a history
of neurological conditions, history of head injury resulting in a loss of
consciousness for longer than 5 min, a current alcohol or substance use
disorder within the past month, and a history of psychotic spectrum
disorders. Of the remaining 109, a total of 18 datasets were excluded from
analysis due to data quality issues, resulting in 91 datasets available for
subsequent analysis. Table 1 lists demographic and clinical measures.
Participants with PTSD (N = 65) had histories of childhood trauma and
varied levels of pathological dissociation, including some with the PTSD
dissociative subtype, and some with DID. These individuals were seeking
treatment at a psychiatric hospital
in the northeast region of the US.
Participants without PTSD had no history of or current psychiatric disorders
(N = 26).

All research procedures were approved by the Massachusetts General
Brigham Human Research Affairs Institutional Review Board and performed
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki human subject guidelines
and regulations. All participants provided written informed consent and
received $200 compensation. Data collection occurred between January
2015 and September 2019.

Diagnostic and symptom measures
Data collection followed the STROBE guidelines [39]. Psychiatric diagnoses
were determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV
Axis I Disorders [40], the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
(CAPS-5; [41]) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative
Disorders-revised [42].

For a measure of depersonalization and derealization symptoms, we
used the average of the depersonalization and derealization subscales on
the Multidimensional
Inventory of Dissociation (MID; [43]). To measure
partially-dissociated intrusions, we computed the average score of the
following MID subscales: child voices, voices/internal struggle, persecutory
voices, speech insertion,
insertion, made/intrusive emotions,
made/intrusive impulses, made/intrusive actions, temporary loss of well-
rehearsed skills and knowledge, disconcerting experiences of self-
alteration, and self-puzzlement. To control
for PTSD symptom and
childhood maltreatment severity in our analyses, we used the CAPS-5
total PTSD symptom severity score and the Childhood Trauma Ques-
tionnaire (CTQ) total score [44].

Statistical analysis
While all participants underwent a single study session (and thus blinding
and randomization to treatments/conditions was not applicable), study
staff who collected the imaging data from participants were blinded to
participant diagnostic status.

DID diagnosis and the dimensional symptoms of depersonalization/
derealization and partially-dissociated intrusions are highly collinear.
Evaluating associations between each dissociation type and network
connectivity in separate models could yield ﬁndings that are driven by
shared variance due to their collinearity (Fig. 1). On the other hand,

sensitivity because shared variance between the predictors is ignored in
the estimation.

three predictors within the same model will

To address these issues, we followed the novel two-step approach
presented in [38] that relied on a series of multiple regressions with
orthogonalization of predictors. First, full variance models were estimated
with each network’s set of connectivity maps as the dependent variable,
and orthogonalized predictors of interest (i.e., DID, depersonalization/
derealization, and partially-dissociated intrusions). This identiﬁed brain

regions or “markers” associated with each predictor using the full variance
associated with the predictor. We interpret these markers as being
associated with “pathological dissociation,” irrespective of subtype.

We then identiﬁed unique contributions of each dissociation subtype to
the connectivity between markers and the network(s) by extracting the
subject-level average regression weights for each marker. These weights
were then used as dependent variables in a second set of multiple
regressions with orthogonalizations to estimate regression coefﬁcients that
captured the unique effects of each subtype (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary
for full details).

Each full variance model had one of

the following independent
variables as the predictor: diagnostic subgroup (PTSD, PTSD dissociative
subtype, DID, and nonpsychiatric control) and two additional symptom
severity scores (depersonalization/derealization, partially-dissociated intru-
sions). In addition, age, CTQ childhood maltreatment severity, and CAPS-5
PTSD total symptom severity were entered as covariates of no interest in
all models. The CTQ score was missing for three participants (two with
DID and one with the dissociative subtype of PTSD). Each score was
replaced with average CTQ score for that diagnostic category. Every
full variance model was evaluated using FSL Randomize for non-
parametric permutation testing (n = 5000 permutations) with threshold-
free cluster enhancement to control family-wise error (p < 0.05). As noted
in [38], an additional correction for the multiple regression models is not
necessary because all models explain the same total variance and, as
such, are equivalent with respect to considerations of signal vs. noise.
Further, as in [38], unique variance models were not corrected to retain
sensitivity.

To begin to build a large-scale functional network connectivity

trauma-related pathological dissociation and its
subtypes, we leveraged the Triple Network model of psycho-
pathology. We tested the connectivity of three core neurocog-

(DIM) variables together. In this case, the shared variance between
the variables (the areas of overlap in the center of the Venn diagram)
are ignored when estimating the regression parameters. In contrast,
full variance modeling (Step 1) involves running separate models
that estimate the regression parameter of the variable using its full
variance (heavy black circles) to yield a set of brain regions (or
markers) whose connectivity with the network is associated with that
variable. In Step 2, unique variance modeling identiﬁes the unique
association between the markers identiﬁed in Step 1 and each
diagnostic categorical and dimensional variable. Adapted from [38].

RESULTS
Right central executive network (rCEN)
Full variance models showed the rCEN was most impacted by
pathological dissociation; speciﬁcally, 39 clusters were linked to
two types of alterations: (1) within-network hyperconnectivity; (2)
Decreased connectivity with brain regions outside rCEN (Fig. 2,
Table 2).

All three dissociation subtypes uniquely contributed to the altered
connectivity of the rCEN (Fig. 3, Table 2). DID was associated with
increased functional connectivity between rCEN and regions in tDN
(cluster #40, 51, 53, 56), and with regions outside our three core
networks (cluster #39, 43, 58). DID was also uniquely associated with
decreased functional connectivity between rCEN and regions in tDN
(cluster #27), cSN (cluster #24, 25), and regions outside our three
networks (cluster #20, 22, 23, 28). Greater partially-dissociated
intrusions were associated with rCEN within-network hyperconnec-
tivity concentrated in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, middle and
superior frontal gyrus (cluster #45), increased connectivity between
rCEN and regions in tDN (cluster #27, 40, 53) and decreased
connectivity between rCEN and posterior cingulate cortex/precu-
neus, also in tDN (#57). Greater depersonalization/derealization was
associated with decreased connectivity between middle temporal
gyrus and rCEN (cluster #40, 53), and increased connectivity
between temporal-parietal-occipital junction and rCEN (cluster #51).

Medial temporal default network (tDN)
Ten clusters within tDN exhibited within-network hyperconnec-
tivity related to pathological dissociation (Fig. 2). Only deperso-
nalization/derealization showed unique associations with tDN
reﬂecting hyperconnectivity in parahippocampal
connectivity,
gyrus (cluster #1, 3, 4; Fig. 3, Table 2).

First, we examined alterations in functional connectivity related
to pathological dissociation broadly deﬁned as an association with
DID diagnosis, depersonalization/derealization, and/or partially-
dissociated intrusions. While each brain region was identiﬁed
using a speciﬁc full variance model
for each subtype of
dissociation, the different subtypes are highly collinear. Conse-
quently, the ﬁndings could be driven by shared variance between
the subtypes. Therefore, we discuss the results in the next
paragraph as alterations due to “pathological dissociation,” not a
particular subtype.

Overall, the rCEN was the most impacted by pathological
dissociation; however, we found that all core networks implicated
in the Triple Network model of psychopathology were impacted.
Speciﬁcally, pathological dissociation was associated with hyper-
connectivity within rCEN, tDN, and cSN. Dissociation was also
linked to decreased connectivity between rCEN and other brain
regions,
including areas within DN and cSN that may facilitate
communication among networks. Furthermore, greater dissocia-
tion was related to decreased connectivity between cSN and rCEN
regions. Taken together, these alterations may be an adaptive or
compensatory response to childhood trauma and are a likely
source of executive functioning differences, self-alteration experi-
ences, and altered interoceptive/autonomic experiences reported
by individuals with dissociative symptoms [9, 49, 50].

Next, we explored connectivity that was uniquely associated
with each dissociation subtype. We found that depersonalization/
derealization was uniquely associated with connectivity in two
networks: the rCEN and tDN. First, depersonalization/derealization
was related to decreased connectivity between rCEN and lateral
middle temporal gyrus regions typically located in the DN and
thought to facilitate retrieval of semantic/conceptual knowledge
[23]. This ﬁnding may reﬂect decreased communication between
these networks. In contrast, rCEN had increased connectivity with
junction typically located in DN.
the temporal-parietal-occipital
This region is involved in mentalization, that is, reﬂecting on the
mental states of others [23]. It is also implicated in out-of-body
experiences [51]. Increased communication between this region
and CEN may, in part, underlie feelings of detachment, strange-
ness, or unreality with one’s body or environment.

Second, depersonalization/derealization was also associated
with hyperconnectivity within tDN concentrated in parahippo-
campal gyrus. Parahippocampal gyrus is part of
the medial
temporal lobe memory system and has demonstrated connectiv-
ity with areas of the brain involved in vision [52]. Parahippocampal
gyrus supports memory formation and retrieval, in particular, for
episodic and autobiographical memory, and the context of an
event [52]. Speciﬁcally, parahippocampal gyrus facilitates proces-
sing of spatial information essential for navigating one’s environ-
ment [52]. Heightened communication within this region of DN

regions) with functional connectivity to our core networks (right central executive, medial temporal default network, and cingulo-

executive, medial temporal default network, or cingulo-opercular salience network). Yellow indicates areas with increased connectivity

may facilitate altered spatial and perceptual experiences asso-
ciated with depersonalization/derealization.

We found that partially-dissociated intrusions were linked to
rCEN hyperconnectivity concentrated in lateral prefrontal cortex.
This network is often active during cognitively challenging
working memory, problem solving, and decision-making tasks
[18]. This implies that greater partially-dissociated intrusions are
related to heightened communication within CEN. This hypercon-
nectivity may also reduce the ﬂexibility of the network to engage
with other networks.

Second, partially-dissociated intrusions were associated with
increased connectivity between DN regions (middle temporal
gyrus) and rCEN. DN is often suppressed while CEN is engaged
[18]. However, here we see some synchronization of these two
networks. Intriguingly, this matches the subjective experience of
partially-dissociated intrusions as “recurrent,
involuntary
intrusions into executive functioning and sense of self” [43].

In contrast, rCEN had decreased connectivity with tDN regions:
the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC) and precuneus, which
may reﬂect decreased communication between these networks.

dynamics—helping to balance internally vs. externally focused
attention and the breadth of attentional focus (i.e., narrow vs.
broad; [53]). Furthermore, recent theories speculate dPCC may
facilitate fast shifts between different mental states [53].

The unique contributions of a DID diagnosis to altered
connectivity were concentrated in the rCEN. Speciﬁcally, DID
diagnosis was associated with a complex pattern of both
increased and decreased connectivity between rCEN and regions
distributed across tDN, cSN, and other networks. The dominant
ﬁnding was one of rCEN hyperconnectivity with regions in tDN.
DN is often suppressed while CEN is engaged [18], but in DID we
instead saw some synchronization of these networks.

A pattern of decreased CEN connectivity with regions in cSN
also emerged in DID. SN may facilitate shifts between CEN and DN
[26]. Decreased communication between rCEN and cSN could
impact the appropriate engagement or disengagement of CEN
and DN [18].

Overall, these ﬁndings support a plausible mechanism under-
lying executive functioning difﬁculties and differences in DID. For
individuals with DID report experiences of amnesia,

Fig. 3 Unique Associations between Connectivity Biomarkers and Depersonalization/Derealization, Partially-Dissociated Intrusions and
Dissociative Identity Disorder Diagnosis. Here we depict biomarkers (brain regions) with functional connectivity to our core networks (right
central executive, medial temporal default network, and cingulo-opercular salience network) that is uniquely associated with each of the
pathological dissociation variables (dissociative identity disorder diagnosis, depersonalization/derealization, and partially-dissociated
intrusions). Green regions indicate the network of interest (right central executive, medial temporal default network). Only two of the
three networks are shown because no markers with functional connectivity to salience network were uniquely associated with one of the
dissociation variables. Yellow indicates regions with increased connectivity between that region and the network of interest uniquely
associated with the dissociation variable. Blue indicates regions with decreased connectivity between that region and the network of interest
with the dissociation variable. The radial bar graphs depict the number of markers linked with each type of dissociation in each network. The
markers reﬂect either increased or decreased connectivity of regions within or outside the network of interest. Images made with MRIcroGL

preserved or even enhanced executive functioning for individuals
with dissociative disorders or high levels of dissociation in which
they out-perform control participants on executive functioning,
working memory and spatial memory tasks
that are not
emotionally-provocative [49, 55, 56]. It may be that some of the
altered rCEN connectivity we identiﬁed could facilitate this
enhanced executive functioning in certain contexts. Future work
involving tasks that elicit CEN activity are needed to sort out when
and how these alterations may facilitate enhanced vs. diminished
executive functioning.

Several models of pathological dissociation have been pre-
viously proposed, and taken together our work builds logically on
this foundational research. For example, the corticolimbic model
of dissociation focuses on trauma-related depersonalization and
derealization in the context of PTSD [12], and other work has
extended this model to the experience of DID [13]. This model
proposes
trauma-related pathological depersonalization and
derealization involve hyperactivation of brain regions involved in
emotion and arousal regulation such that people experience
emotion/arousal over-regulation. A recent systematic review

provided transdiagnostic support for this model across trauma
and non-trauma-related disorders with experiences of dissocia-
tion, as well as elucidated a distributed pattern of brain regions, in
particular in prefrontal cortex, implicated in pathological dissocia-
tion [14]. Our work focused on trauma-related pathological
dissociation and implicates many of the brain regions identiﬁed
in prior models, however, we now place them in the context of
communication within three core neurocognitive networks.
Moreover, we have shown how altered connectivity and perhaps
communication in these networks provides possible mechanisms
speciﬁc to a range of dissociation experiences (e.g., executive
functioning differences, self-alteration experiences, and altered
interoceptive/autonomic experiences).

While we provide robust evidence for alterations in resting-state
networks associated with pathological dissociation, future task-
based analyses that directly measure self-generated thought,
memory, and salience detection are needed to aid the interpreta-
tion of these ﬁndings. We also limited our analyses to rCEN, tDN,
and cSN. Our ﬁndings suggest alterations between these three
networks and other networks play a role in pathological
dissociation, but we did not
this network-to-network
connectivity directly. Furthermore, we focused our analysis on

depersonalization/derealization, partially-dissociated intrusions
and DID, and our results may not be generalizable to other forms
of pathological dissociation, which would be fruitful directions for
future work (e.g., dissociative amnesia). However, our PTSD/DID
samples were recruited from hospital level-of-care and therefore
are highly generalizable to individuals with more severe
symptoms of PTSD/DID. Our PTSD/DID sample was also taking
various forms of psychiatric medication, which we were not
powered to address. Finally, our sample was limited to individuals
who were assigned female sex at birth, and it is unknown whether
results generalize to other sexes.

While gaps remain, this study contributes new data supporting
the neurobiological basis of dissociative symptoms as a disruption
of brain networks. Moreover, we have begun to develop a
network-based brain connectivity “ﬁngerprint” [31] speciﬁc to
different types of dissociation. In the future, these neuromarkers
could be used to stratify samples for randomized control trials, to
monitor recovery, or to target directly with neuromodulatory
techniques as a treatment intervention itself.

Given the complex and highly subjective nature of these
conditions, neurobiological evidence is critical to ensuring that
individuals who experience dissociation receive timely assessment
and appropriate treatment, as with any serious neuropsychiatric
condition. Ultimately, we believe this work will increase awareness
about dissociation, destigmatize these experiences, and contri-
bute to reducing gender-related health disparities.
