Abstract

Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression change efforts (SOGIECE) aim to deny or suppress non-
heterosexual and transgender identities. SOGIECE, including ‘‘conversion practices,’’ are controversial and re-
main prevalent despite contemporary legislative bans and denouncement of these harmful practices from
numerous health profession organizations. Recent work has questioned the validity of epidemiological studies
associating SOGIECE with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. This perspective article addresses such cri-
tiques, arguing that the balance of available evidence indicates SOGIECE contribute to suicidality, while propos-
ing methods to better account for structural context and the multitude of factors that may explain both SOGIECE
attendance and suicidality.

Keywords: conversion therapy, inequities, mental health, sexual and gender minorities, sexual orientation and

Introduction

Sexual orientation and gender identity and ex-

pression change efforts (SOGIECE) aim to deny or
suppress feelings of sexual attraction to people of the same
gender, as well as gender expressions and identities that do
not align with one’s gender/sex assigned at birth.1 SOGIECE
broadly seek to deter people from adopting or expressing
nonheterosexual and transgender identities, with ‘‘conver-
sion practices’’ typically referring to organized efforts by
professionals or para-professionals.2 Despite opposition
from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other queer
(LGBTQ+) communities and allies globally, including nu-
merous health profession organizations,3 SOGIECE remain
prevalent and continue to undermine LGBTQ+ people’s op-
portunities for health and well-being.4

Our

SOGIECE and their impacts at length.1–3,5,6 Informed by
this work, and in line with contemporary legislative
bans,4 we denounce SOGIECE due to their ethical implica-
tions and evidence on the lack of beneﬁts (e.g., mental
health gains, ‘‘effectiveness’’) and signiﬁcant psychosocial
harms,

Some proponents of SOGIECE argue that studies identify-

SOGIECE should be free to do so, as is summarized else-

above all because LGBTQ+ people are often under interper-
sonal or societal pressure when entering—or being entered
into—SOGIECE due to cisheterosexism—a dominant ideol-
ogy that favors cisgender and heterosexual identities and

experiences.5 Related to this, an American Psychological
Association Task Force surmised that debate surrounding
SOGIECE is ‘‘mired in ideological disputes and competing
political agendas.’’7

Although this statement is now over a decade old, legal
and political battles related to SOGIECE, their harms, and
associated policy responses persist today.3 In this context,
some have cast doubt on associations between SOGIECE
and suicidality,8–10 characterizing such links as a ‘‘false re-
search narrative.’’9 This perspective article addresses such
critiques while arguing that the balance of available evidence
an inference of psychological harm from
supports
SOGIECE. We also outline methods for further examining
this timely LGBTQ+ health issue.

(Re)Characterizing the Evidence on SOGIECE
and Suicidality

There is a robust and growing body of literature demon-
strating associations between SOGIECE and suicidality.
Blosnich et al.’s11 analysis of data from Generations—a
study of a nationally representative sample of sexual minor-
ity adults
in the United States, 2016–2018—found
SOGIECE exposure to be associated with higher odds of life-
time suicide ideation, planning, and attempt. Similar insights
were drawn in Salway et al.’s 2020 study,1 which used data
from SexNow, a cross-sectional nonprobability survey of
N = 8388 sexual minority men in Canada.

Salway et al. identiﬁed that sexual minority men with ex-
posure to SOGIECE had 1.42 (95% CI: 1.31–1.53) times the
risk of having ever experienced suicide ideation, along with
2.49 (95% CI: 2.07–2.99) times the risk of having ever
attempted suicide compared with those without exposure to

SOGIECE.1 Findings of this nature are substantiated in
other quantitative analyses,12–14 qualitative studies,6,15,16
and knowledge syntheses.17 Together, this literature offers
clear and compelling evidence of SOGIECE’s suicide-
related and broader health and social harms.

There remain opportunities to assess more fulsomely the
temporality between suicide-related outcomes and different
kinds of potentially relevant and interrelated exposures.
For example, some8–10 have criticized existing studies for
not timing the occurrence of SOGIECE in relation to suici-
dality, thereby rendering it difﬁcult to draw conclusions
about causality. More speciﬁcally, proponents claim that
LGBTQ+ health researchers have been guilty of reporting
an ‘‘association of SOCE [sexual orientation change efforts]
with suicidality as if the former caused the latter, without ex-
amining the possibility that the suicidality may have pre-
ceded recourse to [conversion] therapy.’’10; bolded text ours

To assess the validity of the assumptions in such critiques,
we have produced a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that mod-
els the relationship between pre-SOGIECE suicidality and
post-SOGIECE suicidality (Fig. 1). DAGs graph assumed
causal relations between variables and identify potential cova-
riate adjustment sets required to correct potential sources of
bias.18 Ours includes the assumption that suicide ideation or
behavior (C3) may have preceded both SOGIECE attendance
(the exposure) and subsequent suicidality (outcome).

We expand this DAG to include variables that precede
both SOGIECE exposure and pre-SOGIECE suicidality:
structural cisheterosexism external to the individual (C1)19
and minority stressors such as internalized shame related to
sexual orientation and gender identity, identity-based family
rejection, and lack of afﬁrming resources
and peer
(C2).2,20,21 Of note,
this DAG is intended only as an

illustrative example and does not represent the myriad ef-
fects of cisheterosexism on suicidality, SOGIECE, and
other health outcomes for LGBTQ+ people.

Our evidence-informed view is that LGBTQ+ people who
are exposed to times and places with prevalent structural
cisheterosexism will develop a greater sense of internalized
stigma (path C1‡C2), making them more likely to attend
(or be coerced into) SOGIECE, in an attempt to resolve the
distress they experience (path C2‡E). This view recognizes
that SOGIECE is fundamentally a structural issue, as are
many of the associated consequences, including suicidality.
Indeed, we argue not only that suicidality may drive individ-
uals’ pathways into SOGIECE, but also that pre-SOGIECE
suicidality is rooted in the same set of contextual inﬂuences
and inequities that may increase one’s susceptibility to
SOGIECE. This structural context must be carefully consid-
ered and accounted for in research into SOGIECE and
related harms.

anti-LGBTQ+

To be truly structurally responsive,

research into
SOGIECE must also recognize that the effects of structural
cisheterosexism span the life course. Hence, we note a path-
way from C1 to a mediating variable (M1) representing
the accumulation of minority stressors, including SOGIECE
following
and
SOGIECE.19,21,22 This mediating variable also contributes
to post-SOGIECE suicide ideation/attempts (O). As another
example, structural cisheterosexism (C1) combined with the
unfounded promise of SOGIECE could lead to LGBTQ+
people to have a sense of personal failure (M2) due to
SOGIECE having been ineffective.

experienced

stressors

Internalization of failure with respect to changing some-
thing as deep and personal as identity—particularly when
this identity is marginalized—can reasonably also contribute
to suicidality (O).6,23,24 Considering suicidogenic factors
such as M1 and M2, the minimal sufﬁcient adjustment
set for estimating the total effect of E on O includes not
only pre-SOGIECE suicidality (C3) but also a measure
(or proxy) of external sources of cisheterosexism (C1) that
will likely exert an effect on suicidality before and after
SOGIECE. This adjustment could help to elucidate the struc-
tural nature of these issues and may also shed light on how
circular or episodic sequelae between minority stressors, sui-
cidality, and SOGIECE interact across the life course.

The critique of researchers not attempting to determine the
extent to which suicidality may precede and thus not be at-
tributable to SOGIECE falls short for several reasons.
Although it is true that people experiencing suicidality may
be more likely to seek and/or be sent to SOGIECE (e.g., in
the hopes of obtaining help; out of desperation), this does
not obviate the risk of suicidality being exacerbated in and
following SOGIECE, as we have documented.6 Moreover,

SOGIECE are rarely isolated nor discrete phenomena; rather,
SOGIECE tend to surface, resurface, and be drawn out across
time and contexts.25,26

Indeed, our qualitative study found that SOGIECE can go
on for years, decades even.2 This is echoed in a study by
Flentje et al.,27 showing that people exposed to SOGIECE
had, on average, experienced three SOGIECE ‘‘episodes,’’
each lasting up to 4.5 years. Likewise, Spitzer28 identiﬁed
a mean duration of 4.7 years for SOGIECE exposures,
whereas Salway et al. found that nearly a third of people
who experienced SOGIECE had done so across more than
ﬁve attempts.1 Related to this, we note that drawing respon-
sible conclusions about time order with respect to SOGIECE
and suicidality requires information about both the ‘‘start’’
and ‘‘end’’ times for each of these variables—an issue that
is explained in detail by others.25,26 Herein, we also empha-
size the signiﬁcant variation in how SOGIECE and exposure
to such practices are deﬁned in community and scholar-
ship.2,17 Future work would beneﬁt from using clear and con-
sistent deﬁnitions of SOGIECE exposure to minimize
potential measurement error.

The SexNow SOGIECE study1 by Salway et al. included
data specifying the timing of individuals’ most recent expo-
sure to SOGIECE and suicidality (see Table 1 for the survey
item), though we cannot accurately glean from this informa-
tion when these issues were ﬁrst experienced, or for how
long. This is a key consideration given that, as already high-
lighted, SOGIECE are routinely experienced over extended
periods of time, as are their impacts.2,6 Indeed, having infor-
mation about the timing and duration of initial exposure to
these practices is fundamental to conducting robust time-
series analyses of suicidality and SOGIECE.

Still, working with the data available to us, we reanalyzed
SOGIECE data from SexNow,1 ﬁnding that the odds of having
attempted suicide in the 12 months preceding survey comple-
tion remains elevated and statistically signiﬁcant (Table 2),
even after adjustment for suicide attempts that occurred >12

months ago. Approval

Community-Based Research Centre in Vancouver, Canada.1
That issues of SOGIECE and suicidality interact and re-
peat chronically throughout an individual’s life adds much
complexity to the question on which SOGIECE proponents
(over)focus: ‘‘Which came ﬁrst, SOGIECE or suicidality?’’
In this context, methodological improvements such as the ac-
curate and time-sensitive measurement of SOGIECE expo-
sures and pertinent outcomes could support approximations
of causal inference.26 Still, research addressing harms of
SOGIECE must adhere to the precautionary principle. On
balance, the demonstrated harms associated with SOGIECE
are concerning and warrant restrictions on these practices.

Conclusion

SOGIECE are among the most pressing health and social
issues affecting LGBTQ+ people. Although we have not yet
brought an end to SOGIECE, there has been critical progress
toward redressing and preventing the harms of these prac-
tices. As with all substantive areas, however, we must con-
tinue building a policy- and practice-relevant evidence
base that is committed to the scientiﬁc method and that ex-
tends and challenges—rather than only conﬁrms or responds
to—researchers’ biases and existing hypotheses.

Thus, it may be prudent to design and conduct studies that
can further account for structural cisheterosexism, temporality,
and causality in trajectories of SOGIECE and suicidality as we
seek to better delineate these issues and the ways in which they
intersect, while informing appropriate intervention responses.
This should include studies presenting multivariable adjustment
for the range of factors that may explain both SOGIECE atten-
dance and suicide attempts. Notwithstanding opportunities for
further research, we underscore that ample evidence exists to
suggest that SOGIECE are harmful and contribute to suicidal-
ity. This is a conclusion by which we stand ﬁrmly as a matter of
precautionary principle, as well as equity for LGBTQ+ people,
including those who experience(d) SOGIECE.
