Abstract

Purpose—This study aims to determine the prevalence of suicidality among American Indian 
and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) adolescents. Additionally, we measured suicidality, stratified by sex, 
and its association with sexual identity, sexual violence, and binge drinking.

Methods—We pooled data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) from 2005 to 2019 to 
analyze the prevalence of sexual minorities, forced sex, and binge drinking, and their association 
with suicidality using basic descriptive statistics followed by adjusted odds ratios stratified by sex 
among AI/AN youth.

Results—19% of AI/AN participants reported having suicidal thoughts and 14% reported having 
a previous suicide attempt. More than 17% of AI/AN participants identified as sexual minority 
youth (SMY). Compared to AI/AN heterosexual youth, AI/AN bisexual youth had significantly 
higher odds of reporting suicidal thoughts (aOR=16.01), planning (aOR=12.4), and previous 
attempts (aOR=7.73). This pattern was also significantly demonstrated for AI/AN gay/lesbian 
youth. 43% of all AI/AN participants reported being forced into sexual intercourse. The presence 
of binge drinking was associated with higher odds of suicidal thoughts for both females and males 
compared to those who did not binge drink.

Conclusions—At the intersection of multiple marginalization, AI/AN SMY have a high 
mental health burden, demonstrating the need for culturally-informed, community-led, and 
targeted mental health support focused on SMY AI/AN. Though this study fails to capture the 
heterogeneity within the AI/AN community, as nuances exist at the tribal level, these results 
demonstrate work needs to be done to support the health burden that AI/AN youth carry.

Introduction

We recognize that this article was written on the traditional homelands of the people of the 
Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa as well as the Menominee, 
Miami, and Ho-Chunk nations. It was also a site of trade, travel, gathering and healing for 
more than a dozen other Native tribes and is still home to over 100,000 tribal members in the 
state of Illinois.

Positionality Statement

Given the lingering effects of colonialism in academia, the authors of this paper would like 
to offer a positionality statement to be transparent about potential sources of unintended 
biases in this paper to avoid further oppression of marginalized voices. The authors disclose 
the positionality of our authorship team: Co-author Adrienne Schuler is a tribally enrolled 
member of the Tuscarora Nation. Co-author Anneliese Wedel is a cis-gender white woman 
of Latinx descent. She has lived in Southern California for most of her life. Co-author 
Krystal Wang is self-identified as an Asian woman and Chinese immigrant to the United 
States. Co-author Ysabel Beatrice Floresca is a queer person of Filipinx and Spanish 
descent, who has lived in the Midwestern region of the United States for most of their 
life. Co-author Gregory Phillips II is a white gay cisgender man who grew up in rural 
Pennsylvania and has spent his adult life in large urban centers. Co-author Scar Winter 
Kelsey is a white, queer, and transmasculine person. They have lived most of their life in 
a major city in the Midwestern United States. Co-author Kay Quiballo is a queer person 
of Filipino descent, who has lived in the Midwestern United States for most of their life. 
Lauren B. Beach is a white bisexual non-binary person with Choctaw heritage. They lived 
in rural areas in early childhood, suburban areas in adolescence, and large urban areas 
in adulthood. While it is our goal to provide unbiased, anti-racist, and anti-colonialist 
information, we also recognize that personal identities, experiences, and perspectives may 
lead to differing interpretations of data.

According to the 2020 census, there are roughly 9.7 million American Indian/Alaskan 
Natives (AI/AN) in the United States (US), comprising about 1.1% of the total US 
population, and representing a 160% increase from 2010–2020 [1]. With an increase in 
population, there is an increased need to better understand the health of AI/AN youth. 
It has been well-documented that AI/AN youth have a higher rate of suicidality when 
compared to their white counterparts, with 3.5 times increased risk of death by suicide [2,3]. 
This may be due to barriers AI/AN youth face, including racial discrimination, cultural 
misunderstanding, and logistic difficulties in reaching clinics [4]. Additionally, the history 
of AI/AN communities within the U.S. involves the trauma of colonization including forced 
relocation, loss of land, forced assimilation, and violence, which are all associated with 
worse health outcomes, including suicidality [5].

It is important to understand the role of being a historically marginalized group within the 
US has played in this population. Minority stress theory (MST) hypothesizes that stigma 
contributes to higher levels of discrimination, victimization, and corresponding heightened 
stress levels among marginalized populations [6]. Furthermore, stigma is associated with 
stress-linked coping behaviors, including substance use [6]. Collectively, discrimination, 
victimization, stress, and stress-linked health behaviors demonstrate the need for further 
characterization of AI/AN youth to better allocate support and resources [6].

When compared to their heterosexual peers, lesbian, bisexual, gay, and questioning 
(LBGQ+) youth have higher rates of reporting adverse suicidality outcomes [7–13]. Sexual 
minority youth (SMY), which we use throughout this paper to refer to individuals who 
identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or not sure [14], have been found to be at almost a 
four-fold increased risk of experiencing a mood disorder [15] as well as a three-fold increase 
in experiencing suicidal thoughts and attempting suicide [16]. The increased prevalence of 
mood disorders and suicidal behaviors among SMY is hypothesized to be due to MST, 
with the external victimization, prejudice, and discrimination SMY face from a heterosexist 
society leading to internalized processes and beliefs causing disproportionately higher 
mental health disorders compared to heterosexual peers [6].

Those with minoritized identities of both sexual identity and race face multiple levels 
of external and internal stress [6]. We were interested in investigating suicidal thoughts, 
planning, and attempts among those at the intersection of minoritized sexual identities and a 
historically racially minoritized population, American Indian/Alaskan Natives. Smaller-scale 
studies have demonstrated higher rates of sexual and physical violence among LBGTQ+ 
AI/AN individuals, which was associated with increased reports of suicide attempts 
compared to their white and/or heterosexual counterparts possibly due to compounded 
experiences of racism and homophobia/biphobia [17]. While these studies have been 
important in demonstrating the health disparities that AI/AN SMY face, there remains a 
need for larger-scale studies to evaluate the prevalence of sexual minority identities among 
AI/AN adolescents as well as rates of suicidality among this group.

To investigate how minority stress may impact suicidality among AI/AN SMY, it is 
necessary to examine the role of other risk factors, specifically sexual violence, and binge 
drinking. AI/AN women and girls face high rates of violence, but less is known about the 
rates of sexual violence across AI/AN youth, particularly those of varying sexual identities, 
as they have the compounded risk of being marginalized on the basis of both race and sexual 
identity [18–20]. Additionally, it is known that AI/AN individuals and SMY have higher 
rates of substance use and alcohol-related deaths, so it is important to explore the impact of 
binge drinking within this population [21,22]. This is particularly important to discuss given 
the association of alcohol use with suicide attempts [23].

In the present study, we aim to better characterize suicidality among AI/AN youth using 
data collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey (YRBS) to determine the prevalence of AI/AN youth who reported suicidal 
thoughts, suicide planning, or suicide attempt. We further examined this sample by assessing 
the differing odds of suicidality by sexual identity. We hypothesize that AI/AN youth

will have high rates of suicidal thoughts, planning, and attempts compared to nationwide 
sampling. Additionally, we hypothesize these rates will be more pronounced among AI/AN 
youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or not sure when compared to non-SMY 
AI/AN. We also assessed the effect of risk factors, binge drinking and forced sex on 
suicidality in this AI/AN youth sample, and we expected to find higher rates of both in the 
AI/AN youth sample compared to the national population, and that these behaviors would be 
associated with worse mental health outcomes.

Method

Institutional Review

The study received a full review by Northwestern University’s IRB and was found to be 
not human subjects research as defined by 45 CFR 46.102 and that it does not require IRB 
review.

Data Source

YRBS is a biennial, national survey conducted by the CDC since 1991 [24]. There are 
both national and local versions of the YRBS; the local YRBS can be administered with 
alterations at a state, territorial, tribal, or urban school district level (each of which is 
considered a jurisdiction). Each jurisdiction administered the survey independently, and 
research staff from our team contacted these jurisdictions to pool data to create a large 
sample size. Jurisdictions used a two-stage cluster sample design to identify a representative 
sample of students [24]. Permission was granted by parents for participation with a signature 
of approval or passively. Students were excluded if parents deny permission. Participation is 
voluntary and completely anonymous, and students completed the survey during the span of 
one class period.

Analytic Sample

Local YRBS data were pooled across multiple jurisdictions (states and large urban 
school districts) and years (biennially from 2005 to 2019). The entire dataset consists 
of 87 jurisdictions across eight time points and 975,303 youth, totaling 498 jurisdiction-
years (distinct surveys administered by a particular jurisdiction in a specific year); 261 
jurisdiction-years assessed sexual identity. For the present analyses, only jurisdiction-years 
that assessed sexual identity, sex, age, forced sex, binge drinking, and suicide were included. 
Students were excluded if they did not identify as AI/AN and were missing any of 
the primary demographic variables of interest (sexual identity: 34.5%; sex: 0.8%; age: 
0.5%, race/ethnicity: 98.1%; forced sex: 11.4%; binge drinking: 71.2%, suicide: 0.6%; 
not mutually exclusive), resulting in a final sample size of 114 jurisdiction-years (3,621 
participants).

Measures

Sexual Identity:  Sexual identity was assessed by the question, “Which of the following 
best describes you?” Responses options included: (1) heterosexual; (2) gay or lesbian; (3) 
bisexual; and (4) not sure.

Sex:  Sex was determined by asking, “What is your sex?” with responses (1) female or (2) 
male.

Race/Ethnicity:  Participants were asked if they identified as Hispanic or Latino and 
then were asked to select the races that applied from the following list: American Indian 
or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander; and White. Only youth who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native were 
included in the present study.

Age:  Participants were asked, “How old are you?” Responses were collapsed into: 14 years 
old or younger, 15 years old, 16 years old, 17 years old, and 18 years old or older.

Suicidality:  Suicidality was assessed by the questions, “During the past 12 months, did 
you ever seriously consider attempting suicide?” (Suicide Thought); “During the past 12 
months, did you make a plan about how you would attempt suicide?” (Suicide Plan); 
“During the past 12 months, how many times did you actually attempt suicide?” (Suicide 
Attempt). Responses were collapsed to no (0 times) or yes (1 or more times).

Correlates:  Binge drinking was assessed by the question, “During the past 30 days, on 
how many days did you have 5 or more drinks of alcohol in a row, that is, within a couple 
of hours,” Responses were dichotomized as “0 days” or “1 or more days.” Forced sex was 
asked by the question, “Have you ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse 
when you did not want to?” Responses were “yes” or “no.”

Statistical Analysis

All data cleaning and recoding were conducted in SAS Version 9.4 and SAS-Callable 
SUDAAN Version 11.0.1 to appropriately weight estimates and to account for student 
non-response and distribution of students by age, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction 
[24]. Adjusted weights were calculated by dividing the original weight variable in the 
YRBS dataset by the number of years that variable is present in each jurisdiction. 
Weighting was applied to analyses and nested by year, location (jurisdiction), stratum, and 
Primary Sampling Unit (PSU). All jurisdictions were included to increase analytical sample 
size. Descriptive analyses were conducted to determine prevalence of suicidality, binge 
drinking, forced sex, and demographics by sex. Chi-square tests were conducted to evaluate 
significance of suicidality variables and were stratified by sex. Simple logistic regressions 
were used to assess the association between each variable and each measure of suicidality, 
stratified by sex. Multivariable logistic regression models were then developed to look at 
the associations between sexual identity and each outcome, adjusted for age, binge drinking, 
forced sex, jurisdiction and year, stratified by sex.

Results

The mean age of this sample was 15.8 years (SD=1.2 years) (Table 1). The pooled sample 
was split between male (53.9%) and female (46.0%) youth. In this sample of AI/AN youth, 
2.8% reported they were lesbian/gay, 9.8% reported they were bisexual, and 5.2% reported 
they were not sure.

Suicidality Measures

Page 6

18.1% reported suicidal thoughts (14.7% of males, 26.17% of females), 16.9% of the total 
sample reported having a suicide plan (13.5% of males, 21.9% of females), and 11.9% of the 
total reported having attempted suicide (11.2% of males, 17.22% of females).

Overall, AI/AN youth who identified as lesbian/gay or bisexual were more likely to report 
adverse suicidality outcomes compared to AI/AN heterosexual youth (Table 2). Bisexual 
AI/AN youth had the highest adjusted odds ratios (aORs) in reporting suicidal thoughts out 
of all AI/AN sexual identity groups (aOR=21.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.36,7.16 
in males; aOR=3.75, 95% CI=1.69,8.31 in females). This pattern persisted for bisexual 
youth in having a suicide plan (aOR=16.93, 95% CI=3.11,92.08 in males; aOR=3.16, 
95% CI=1.37,7.33 in females) and suicide attempt (aOR=7.41, 95% CI=1.89,28.97 in 
males; aOR=6.23, 95% CI=2.43,16.00 in females). This pattern was also demonstrated in 
AI/AN gay males, with higher adjusted odds of reporting suicide plans (aOR=5.51, 95% 
CI=2.39,12.75) than heterosexual males. Age was associated with higher odds of suicide 
attempt for 15 year-old AI/AN males (aOR=6.83, 95% CI=1.65,28.26).

Binge Drinking and Forced Sex

The presence of binge drinking was associated with higher odds of suicidal thoughts 
for all participants regardless of sex, suicide plans for males, and suicide attempt for 
females (Table 2). Forced sex was reported in 14% of the AI/AN sample, with 9.26% 
of males reporting forced sex, and 19.26% of females reporting forced sex (Table 1). 
Forced sex was associated with an increased adjusted odds of suicidal thoughts (aOR = 
4.07, 95% CI=1.54,10.75 in males; aOR=4.22, 95% CI=2.25,7.90 in females), suicide plans 
(aOR=5.11, 95% CI=2.13,12.24 in males; aOR=2.68, 95% CI=1.35,5.32 in females) and 
suicide attempts (aOR=6.56, 95% CI=2.26,19.03 in males; aOR=2.45, 95% CI=1.19,5.03 in 
females).

In bivariate analyses, sexual identity was significantly associated with suicidal thoughts in 
females, and suicide plans in males (Table 3a, Table 3b). Binge drinking was not associated 
with adverse suicidality outcomes in males or females. Forced sex was associated with 
suicidal thoughts, suicide plan, and suicide attempt in males and females (Tables 3a, 3b).

Discussion

We examined the prevalence of suicidal thoughts, planning, and attempts among AI/AN 
adolescents, and hypothesized that factors such as minoritized sexual identity, forced 
sex, and binge drinking are associated with increased odds of suicidality compared to 
heterosexual counterparts. Overall, we found that those who identify as both AI/AN and 
SMY had increased odds of adverse suicidality outcomes depending on their sexual identity 
compared to their heterosexual AI/AN peers. AI/AN who reported binge drinking had 
increased odds of certain adverse suicidality outcomes depending on their reported sex 
compared to those that did not. Additionally, our study demonstrates a high prevalence of 
forced sex among AI/AN adolescents.

Reported Suicidality

Page 7

A higher percentage of AI/AN participants reported rates of suicidal thoughts (20% vs. 
16%), suicide planning (17% vs. 14%), and previous suicide attempt (14% vs. 9%), 
compared to the overall YRBS youth population [25]. This is consistent with previous 
studies illustrating the disproportionate prevalence of suicide in AI/AN communities, with 
the National Violent Death Reporting System demonstrating more than three-fold higher 
rate of suicide among AI/AN individuals than other racial groups [2,3]. It is particularly 
important to recognize the history of AI/AN communities within the US involves the 
historical trauma of colonization such as forced relocation, loss of land, forced assimilation, 
and violence, which are associated with worse health outcomes including depressive 
symptoms and suicidality [5]. These findings demonstrate the need for targeted strategies to 
improve the mental health of AI/AN youth through trauma-informed, culturally appropriate 
care.

Sexual Identity

This study demonstrated a high percentage of AI/AN adolescents who identified as bisexual, 
lesbian/gay, or not sure when compared to nationwide YRBS sampling (18% vs. 11%, 
females: 25% vs. 12%, males: 13% vs. 7%, total) [26]. The authors postulate this greater 
proportion of SMY may reflect the historical acceptance of same-sex relationships and 
non-binary gender identities in select American Indian tribes, however tribes varied in 
nomenclature as well as acceptance [28].

Sexual Identity and Suicidality

In the AI/AN YRBS sample, we observed heightened suicidality in SMY compared to their 
heterosexual counterparts. Significantly increased aORs were present for all participants 
regardless of sex for bisexual individuals for all adverse suicidality outcomes. Higher odds 
of suicide plan were present for both bisexual and gay males.

The higher rates of suicidal thoughts among SMY are consistent with previous data 
demonstrating higher suicide attempts and completion in LGB+ individuals [27]. However, 
given the high proportion of SMY in this AI/AN population, it is important to consider the 
challenges Native SMY face. Previously, a survey of LGBTQ+ individuals of color showed 
that LGBTQ- based discrimination was significantly associated with an increased risk of 
suicide [28]. These higher rates of negative mental health outcomes within the SMY AI/AN 
population could be due to the compounded challenges of being both a sexual minority and 
a racial/ethnic minority as a target of imposed colonial cultures and Christian values [29,30]. 
Compared to heterosexual counterparts within the AI/AN community, gay individuals report 
higher levels of depression; however, factors such as increased reports of connection and 
community act as protective factors against these effects [30].

Forced Sex

Forced sex within the Native population demonstrates the lingering effects of colonialism 
given the historic dehumanization of Native People [31]. Our sample demonstrated a large 
proportion of AI/AN adolescents who reported being forced into sexual intercourse. This is 
double compared to a nationwide YRBS sample (14% vs. 7%) [26]. Our study demonstrates

increased odds of suicidality in among all participants who reported forced sex. This aligns 
with literature linking sexual assault to increased rates of suicidality [32].

Binge Drinking

Given the theorized increased burden of stress and maladaptive coping strategies amongst 
marginalized populations [6], patterns of binge drinking within AI/AN youth should be 
explored. This study found AI/AN youth reported binge drinking at a similar prevalence 
to the nationwide population (13% AI/AN vs. 14% across all races, in 2019 nationwide 
sampling, female: 12% vs. 13%, male: 14% vs. 13%) [33]. In males and females, binge 
drinking was associated with increased odds of suicide attempt. This increased association 
between suicidality and binge drinking should be further explored, especially in a group with 
an increased prevalence of alcohol use disorder [34]. By implementing routine screenings, 
providers can play a crucial role in identifying individuals who are at-risk for suicidal 
behaviors.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the AI/AN population is a heterogeneous group 
that is made up of many different tribes with different cultures, traditions, and nuances 
exist than are addressed. (See supplemental tables for a breakdown of AI/AN population 
frequency by geographic region). Second, we are limited to the questions and answer 
choices that are provided by the YRBS. For instance, few jurisdictions in select years (2017 
and 2019) address transgender status and no jurisdiction in any year included Two-Spirit as 
a response option. We are therefore unable to discuss outcomes of transgender, Two-Spirit, 
or individuals with other gender identities. Another significant limitation of this paper 
was the lack of trend analysis, which limited our ability to accurately describe current 
prevalence. As our analysis pooled data from multiple years, we were unable to determine 
potential variation in prevalence from year to year. Therefore, we could not estimate current 
prevalence as these unknown variations in trend analysis may have under or overestimated 
current prevalence. This limitation was especially salient given the reported upward trend in 
suicidal ideation and attempts among Native SMY [35].

Practice Recommendations

The association between suicide-related outcomes and SMY in the Native population 
is clear, striking, and disheartening. While more work is needed to further understand 
the health of these youth, there has been qualitative data showing the positive role 
of community support and connectedness among LGBTQ AI/AN women in promoting 
resilience [36]. Additionally, LGBTQ-inclusive education has been shown to decrease 
the odds of bullying and suicidal ideation in LGBTQ youth [37]. Together, these studies 
demonstrate opportunities for intervention to better support LGBTQ+ youth in marginalized 
communities. Beyond sexual identity, this paper also identifies the present-day effects of 
colonialism on AI/AN communities as Native adolescents remain at high risk of sexual 
violence, emphasizing the need for training in the recognition of sexual assault and the 
provision of trauma-informed health care. Additional work is needed to systematically 
address the lingering effect of trauma and inequities secondary to colonization, and for 
trauma-informed and culturally appropriate care to become the standard of care in AI/AN

an emphasis on the acknowledgment of the historical trauma that AI/AN communities face, 
particularly at the intersection of being a racial and sexual minority.

Acknowledgments

We wish to acknowledge the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for their role in creating and administering 
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey and all the respondents who participated. The authors would also like to recognize 
that Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) are a group of Indigenous people who have their own 
cultural identity and health outcomes and live within the jurisdictions that the YRBS captures. Given that NHOPI 
and AI/AN populations each have unique identities, this paper specifically intends to address the results and needs 
of the AI/AN population and we recognize that more work needs to be done to address NHOPI health outcomes.

Implications and Contribution

This study uses a dataset of more than 13,000 individuals to explore the prevalence of 
suicidality among American Indian/Alaskan Native adolescents, examining the impact 
of sex, sexual identity, binge drinking, and forced sex on suicidality. The findings 
underscore the value of community-based approaches to promote resilience within this 
marginalized population.
