Abstract

Objectives:  There is limited information on the characteristics of older adults with bipolar 
disorder (OABD) treated with lithium, along with safety concerns about its use by older adults.

Experimental proecdures:  Cross-sectional analysis of the GAGE-BD dataset to determine 
differences and similarities between lithium users and non-users. We analysed data from 986 
participants aged 50 years or older (mean age 63.5 years; 57.5% females) from 12 study sites. 
Two subgroups (‘Lithium’; ‘Non-lithium’) were defined according to the current prescription of 
lithium. We compared several outcomes between these groups, controlling for age, gender, and 
study site.

Results:  OABD treated with lithium had lower scores on depression rating scales and were less 
likely to be categorised as with moderate or severe depression. There was a lower proportion 
of lithium users than non-users among those with evidence of rapid cycling and non-bipolar 
psychiatric diagnoses. Assessment of global cognitive state and functionality indicated better 
performance among lithium users. The current use of antipsychotics was less frequent among 
lithium users, who also reported fewer cardiovascular comorbidities than non-users.

Conclusion:  We found several potentially relevant differences in the clinical profile of OABD 
treated with lithium compared to those treated with other mood stabilisers. However, the 
interpretation of the present results must take into account the methodological limitations inherent 
to the cross-sectional approach and data harmonisation.

INTRODUCTION

Lithium salts have been widely used for the treatment of mood disorders over the past 
decades, and still represent a first-line therapeutic option for the management of bipolar 
disorder (BD).1 There is limited information on the characteristics of older adults with BD 
(OABD) prescribed lithium.2 Most of the evidence supporting lithium use in this population 
has been extrapolated from studies conducted in younger cohorts or has been based on 
post-hoc analyses of trials with mixed-age samples, open-label trials or observational 
studies.3 Single-site studies dedicated to OABD often draw conclusions from small patient 
samples addressing specific clinical questions – e.g., treatment response, risk factors, 
comorbidities, or cognitive symptoms – and are often underpowered to test differences 
in efficacy outcomes.2 An exception is the GERI-BD study, a randomised clinical trial of 
lithium carbonate vs. divalproex sodium for the treatment of OABD,4 in which 224 type-I 
BD patients aged 60 years or older presenting with manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes 
were randomly assigned to receive either treatment for nine weeks. Overall efficacy and 
tolerability was similar in both groups, but lithium-treated patients showed more marked 
improvement in manic symptoms.4 In a cross-sectional study in 76 OABD, lithium users 
reported a more positive attitude towards pharmacotherapy than non-users, including better 
self-reported contentedness, subjective somatic health, and social functioning, in spite of 
reporting more side-effects.5 Finally, according to a Delphi survey of 25 experts from nine 
countries, lithium was the preferred choice for maintenance monotherapy in OABD, and 
emphasised the view that tolerability can be improved by maintaining lithium treatment at 
lower serum levels of lithium (0.4–0.8mmol/L).6

Taken together, currently available evidence supports the hypothesis that lithium is an 
efficacious treatment of OABD; yet, safety and tolerability issues cannot be ignored.1,7,8 
Lithium-related side-effects can be both unpleasant (e.g., tremor) and clinically relevant 
in the long term (e.g., renal insufficiency or hypothyroidism), jeopardising the patient’s 
adherence to treatment and discouraging clinicians to prescribe it.9 According to register 
studies conducted in Denmark and Sweden, the pattern of prescription of mood-stabilising 
drugs for the treatment of BD has changed over the past years, with a decline in the use of 
lithium and valproate,10 alongside an increase in the use of lamotrigine and quetiapine.11 
Also, underutilisation of lithium has been reported in Scotland12 and in North America,13 
which may have been driven by safety concerns and marketing investments by pharma 
favouring the prescription of newer drugs. Nonetheless, in a recent retrospective cohort 
study addressing predictors of discontinuation of lithium therapy in OABD, the main reason 
for discontinuation was lack of efficacy, and only a minority of cases discontinued lithium 
because of side-effects.14 Nonetheless, other mood-stabilisers, such as anticonvulsants 
and antipsychotics, are also associated with potentially serious adverse effects, including 
increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular events.1

1.1.  Aims of the study:

The Global Aging & Geriatric Experiments in Bipolar Disorder (GAGE-BD) project is a 
consortium of investigators dedicated to research in OABD, assembling studies conducted 
by different groups from around the globe, including sites in North and South America,

Europe, Asia and Oceania.3 Measures have been integrated and harmonised to enable 
hypothesis-driven analyses in the largest to date dataset in this field. The present study 
used GAGE-BD data to investigate the clinical profile of lithium-treated OABD compared to 
those treated with other mood-stabilising drugs. Therefore, the objective of the present study 
is to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of OABD undergoing lithium 
therapy in this large, collaborative dataset.

2.  MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1.  Study design and participants:

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the GAGE-BD dataset (as of August 2021) 
to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of OABD treated with lithium 
compared with those treated with other drugs by the time of assessment. This integrated 
database derives from archival datasets from 12 study sites (with a total number of 1,761 
subjects) distributed across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania, namely: 
Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland, Ohio, USA (4 studies, n=283); 
University of California at San Diego (UCSD), California, USA (n=173); McLean Hospital, 
Massachusetts, USA (n=73); University of Pittsburgh (UPMC), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
USA (n=143); Yale School of Medicine (YSM), New Haven, Connecticut, USA (n=88); 
Lady Davis Institute (LDI), Montreal, Canada (2 studies, n=114); Center for Addiction & 
Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, Canada (n=48); University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao 
Paulo, Brazil (n=144); GGZ inGeest, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (2 studies, n=367); 
University of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain (n=161); Taipei Medical University (TMU), 
Taipei, Taiwan (2 studies, n=99); University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia (n=68). 
Approval to contribute data was obtained by each site’s institutional review boards or ethics 
committees and by the GAGE-BD coordinating board. The authors assert that all procedures 
contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and 
institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 
1975, as revised in 2008.

The inclusion criteria for the present analysis were: age of 50 years or more (n=1,103);2 
diagnosis of BD type-I (64.7%), BD type-II (22.6%) or ‘BD subtype unknown’ (12.7%); 
and availability of information about lithium use (n=986). The mean age of the study 
sample was 63.5 years (maximum age 95 years), and 57.5% were women. Two experimental 
groups were constituted, i.e., ‘Lithium’ (n=406) and ‘Non-lithium’ (n=580). Allocation in 
the former was defined by current prescription of lithium salts for the treatment of BD, 
not accounting for previous history of lithium use. Of note, only four sites (Barcelona, 
GGZ, LDI and USP) had a higher proportion of lithium users than non-users (60.2%, 
59.4%, 70.0% and 52.8% respectively). The proportion of lithium users was lowest in North-
American sites (CWRU, 9.7%; UCSD, 9.7%; YSM, 23.9%; UPMC, 24.0%; and CAMH, 
33.3%) and Taipei (TMU, 42.1%).

2.2.  Study measures:

The following assessment scales were used to quantify current symptoms of depression, 
mania and psychosis: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD),15 Montgomery-Asberg

Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)16 Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, 
(CES-D),17 Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)18 and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 
(BPRS).19 The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),20 the Global Assessment of 
Functionality (GAF)21 and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)22 were used for 
the assessment of global cognitive, functional and clinical state, respectively. Data 
harmonisation followed the same principles reported in previous publications of the GAGE-
BD consortium.3,7 The characterisation of current mood state was done by the assessment 
of total scores on related assessment scales (HAMD, MADRS and CES-D). Severity of 
depression symptoms was also estimated by transforming raw scores on 17-, 21- and 24-
item HAMD scales (HAMD-17, HAMD-21 and HAMD-24) into an aggregated continuous 
variable, where the latter two were rescaled to fit the same scoring amplitude of the 17-item 
version. This was achieved by dividing HAMD-21 and HAMD-24 total scores by the 
maximum possible score that can be obtained on each of these scales, and then multiplying 
the result by 63, which is the maximum possible score that can be achieved on HAMD-17. 
A similar procedure was undertaken to harmonise the 24-item BPRS scores into a single 
continuous variable with the same amplitude of BPRS-18. The presence of suicidal thoughts 
was evaluated by assessing the sub-scores of items 3 and 10 of HAMD and MADRS, 
respectively. Because only a small subset of contributing studies used each of the depression 
measures, to increase power, we also harmonised depression scores across HAMD, MADRS 
and CES-D scales to yield the new categorial variable (‘depression band’) based of cut-off 
scores of the various scales, i.e., no depression (HAMD ≤7; MADRS ≤6; CES-D ≤15); mild-
or-moderate depression (HAMD 8–23; MADRS 7–34; CES-D 16–27); or severe depression 
(HAMD ≥24; MADRS ≥35; CES-D ≥28).

Other measures of interest included: age, gender, education, relationship and employment 
status, family history of mental illness, BD subtype, age of onset, illness duration, number 
of major affective episodes, number of hospitalisations, history of rapid cycling, current 
mood symptoms, use of antipsychotics, having medical or psychiatric comorbidities, body 
weight, smoking status, global cognitive state and functionality. Psychiatric comorbidities 
were estimated by the evidence of current or lifetime diagnoses of anxiety disorders and/or 
substance/alcohol use disorders. The occurrence of physical comorbidities was ascertained 
according to reported impairments in 8 distinct systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, hepatic/pancreatic, renal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal and endocrine), 
in addition to the number of affected systems reported for each participant (cummulative 
somatic burden).

2.3.  Statistical analysis:

Data were analysed with SPSS (version 25.0) and R (version 4.1.2). We first described 
the data, providing raw means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and 
counts and proportions for categorical variables in ‘Lithium’ and ‘Non-lithium’ groups, 
and compared these raw estimates between the groups using Pearson’s Chi-squared tests 
(X2), t-tests for independent samples and Mann-Whitney tests as appropriate for categorical, 
continuous and ordinal measures, respectively. Next, we used generalised linear mixed 
model (GLMM) for binomial family and logit link function to compare the ‘Lithium’ and 
‘Non-lithium’ groups while controlling for age, gender and the random effect (intercept) of

clustering according to study site. In situations, where lithium was used as a predictor, we 
used linear regression, linear mixed (LMM), and GLMM models for binomial, cumulative 
binomial and multinomial families with their respective canonical link functions. No 
automated method for variable selection was used. Linear regressions models were fit 
with least squares estimator, whereas LMM used restricted maximum likelihood, and 
GLMM used maximum likelihood estimation using Laplace approximation. We ruled out 
collinearity by determining the variance inflation factor (maximum VIF was 1.04). These 
model tested the association between lithium use and a set of continuous variables indicative 
of current mood state (including scores in HAMD, CES-D, YMRS, BPRS), global cognitive/
functional state (MMSE, GAF), clinical impression (CGI), number of affective episodes, 
cumulative somatic burden (as defined by the total number of somatic comorbidies) and 
body weight. In these models, we treated lithium as the fixed effect, assuming that the 
distribution of the response variable should be the same for lithium users and non-users, 
while controlling for age and gender. We also included a random effect of study site for 
all measures, except MADRS, CES-D and CGI, which were only fully measured (i.e., 
all variables in model without missing values) in one site. We used F-values in linear 
regression, and likelihood ratios (LR) in LMM and GLMM. Alpha was set at 5% and 
all probability estimates were two-tailed. Although these analyses were exploratory (i.e., 
hypotheses generating), we used Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values to ascertain the 
statistical significance of the associations after controlling for multiple comparisons and 
therefore reduce false discovery rate.

3.  RESULTS

Table 1 presents a descriptive summary of demographic and clinical variables in 
‘Lithium’ and ‘Non-lithium’ groups. The univariate analyses showed statistically significant 
differences between the two groups for the following measures: age, age of onset, history 
of rapid cycling, smoking status, body weight, antipsychotic drug use, severity of current 
depression, scores on psychometric scales and somatic comorbidities.

Tables 2A and 3A display the distribution of study measures by treatment groups and the 
corresponding statistics in the first regression model (GLMM), using age and gender as fixed 
predictors, study site as random intercept and ‘Lithium’ as response. There was no evidence 
that either age or gender modified the probability of using lithium. A set of predictor 
variables was added to the model one at a time. The variables education (p=0.05), family 
history of mental illness (p=0.03) and lifetime non-BD psychiatric diagnoses (p=0.03) 
showed statistically significant associations with lithium use. Each additional year in 
education increased the odds of using lithium by 5% (OR=1.05; SE=0.03; 95%CI=[1.00, 
1.10]; z=1.97; p=0.049). A lower proportion of lithium users reported a positive family 
history of mental illness (32.7% vs. 45.8%), and the analysis of the model’s parameters 
showed that OABD patients with a positive family history of mental illness had 47% lower 
odds of using lithium than those without (OR=0.53; SE=0.16; 95%CI=[0.30, 0.95]; z=−2.15; 
p=0.032). Finally, patients with previous history of anxiety disorder, or comorbid anxiety 
plus substance use disorders, had respectively 50% (OR=0.50; SE=0.14; 95%CI=[0.29, 
0.86]; z=−2.49; p=0.013) and 56% (OR=0.44; SE=0.16; 95%CI=[0.22, 0.90]; z=−2.26;

p=0.024) lower odds of using lithium then those without another psychiatric diagnosis. The 
remaining variables did not show statistically significant associations with the use of lithium.

In a second model using ‘Lithium’ as a predictor of multiple outcomes, controlling for age 
and gender plus a random intercept for study site (Table 2B), we found that lithium users 
had lower harmonised HAMD (p=0.004) and CES-D (p<0.001) scores, and higher MMSE 
(p=0.02) and GAF (p=0.007) scores than non-users. We found no statistically significant 
associations between lithium use and number of affective episodes, MADRS or YMRS 
scores, BPRS, CGI, body weight, or cumulative somatic burden. Pearson’s correlation 
coefficients for the total sample indicated that GAF scores were inversely associated with 
HAMD (r=−0.623, p=0.001) and MADRS scores (r=−0.765, p=0.001), but not with MMSE 
scores (r=−0.022, p=0.68).

Using a similar approach to evaluate fixed effect of ‘Lithium’ on a set of categorical 
variables, controlling for age and gender plus a random intercept for study site (Table 3B), 
we found that lithium users were less represented among BD patients with rapid cycling 
(p=0.04) and those with moderate/severe depression (p<0.001). Also, lithium users were less 
frequently prescribed antipsychotic drugs (p<0.001) and had less comorbid cardiovascular 
conditions (p=0.008). No statistically significant associations with lithium use were found 
for the variables occupation, relationship status, smoking, and other somatic comorbidities. 
Finally, there was no obvious association between lithium use and higher scores on 
items related to suicidality on HAMD and MDRS scales. After correction for multiple 
comparisons, six variables retained statistically significant associations with lithium use, 
namely CES-D (adjusted p=0.03); HAMD (0.01); GAF (0.04); moderate/severe depression 
(0.005); antipsychotic use (0.01) and cardiovascular morbidity (0.04).

4.  DISCUSSION

With nearly a thousand individuals from multiple sites around the world, this is currently 
the largest sample dedicated to the study of OABD, including their use of lithium. We 
found some salient differences between the two groups. Lithium-treated patients had higher 
levels of education, were less likely to have family history of psychiatric disorders or 
personal history of psychiatric comorbidities. They had significantly lower mean scores in 
depression rating scales and lower frequency of severe forms of depression, in addition to 
better global cognitive and functional state. Also, participants in the lithium-treated group 
were less likely to be prescribed antipsychotic drugs and to have comorbid cardiovascular 
conditions. Two lines of explanation could be considered to interpret these findings: first, 
lithium use is indeed associated with better outcomes in depression, functionality and 
cognition; alternatively, complex and difficult-to-treat patients could have been less likely 
to be treated with lithium in the first place or more likely to be switched from lithium to 
other medications.

The lower burden of depression among individuals treated with lithium is important, given 
that older age patients are more likely to have depressive-predominant polarity than their 
younger counterparts.23 This finding can have several explanations. Episodic course is one 
of the key predictors of lithium response, and individuals with episodic illness will be

less likely to show depressive symptoms at any given time relative to people with chronic 
presentations. Consequently, prescribing lithium primarily to people with episodic illness 
could explain the lower rates of depressive symptoms in this group, but this prescriber 
bias would not necessarily explain the observation that lithium-treated individuals had less 
severe depressive episodes. We could also think of indication bias: if lithium is indicated 
for the management of mania and maintenance, those with depression or with frequent 
depressive episodes would be less likely to be prescribed lithium. Alternatively, it is possible 
that patients treated with lithium are better protected against depressive symptoms/episodes, 
or that lithium alleviates the severity of depression. This is in accordance with studies 
documenting antidepressant properties of lithium and its efficacy in preventing depressive 
episodes.1 In contrast to previous studies,24 we found no evidence of association between 
lithium use and suicide symptoms.

The association between lithium use and better functionality and cognition merits 
discussion. The possibility of lithium causing cognitive toxicity is a matter of concern 
in the clinical practice.8,25 On the other hand, growing evidence from pre-clinical and 
clinical research suggests that lithium use may also deliver neurotrophic and protective 
effects in the long term,26 improving neurocognitive performance,27 modifying pathogenic 
mechanisms commonly associated with neurodegeneration,28 and eventually attenuating the 
risk of dementia.29–31 The fact that lithium treatment was associated with higher MMSE 
scores in the present analysis does not support the hypothesis that lithium has detrimental 
effects on the cognitive performance of older adults. At the same time, we cannot clearly 
interpret this as a beneficial effect of lithium on cognition, because of the cross-sectional 
design of the study. It is possible that better cognitive and general functioning increased the 
chance of lithium prescription, as this treatment requires closer monitoring and compliance, 
which may be compromised in people with impaired cognition and functionality. Lithium 
use was also associated with a better overall functional status, with mean GAF scores 10% 
higher than among non-users. It is also possible that the better functional status observed 
among lithium users may be related to being less depressed, as suggested by the finding of a 
strong negative correlation between functionality and depression ratings.

We also found that lithium users were less likely to have psychiatric comorbidities than 
non-users, although our analyses were restricted to anxiety and substance use disorders. 
These differences may also reflect prescription biases, where comorbidity with other 
psychiatric disorders may be a reason not to prescribe lithium, which would be reserved 
for individuals with more classical phenotype and fewer comorbidities. Our findings are in 
contrast with those reported by Burton and colleagues,32 suggesting that older adults treated 
with lithium were similar to those treated with second generation antipsychotics with respect 
to the occurrence of psychiatric comorbidities, namely anxiety, PTSD and substance abuse. 
Differences in sample size might explain the discrepancy between studies, given that the 
latter study was based on a smaller number of subjects (n=24) in each treatment group.32

In the present analysis, both groups had similar rates of respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic/
pancreatic, renal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal and endocrine disorders, consistent with the 
findings by Pfennig and colleagues,25 although the characterization of comorbidities in this 
dataset was not supported by subsidiary laboratory data. The lack of association between

lithium use and endocrine or renal dysfunctions in the present sample is intriguing. Lithium 
use accelerates loss of renal function in the elderly, which can be additionally impacted by 
polypharmacy.33 The study of older adults aged 70 years or over found that progressive renal 
dysfunction leading to discontinuation of lithium treatment was recorded for 30% of users.32 
However, in a population-based cohort study, the risk of renal decline in older adults treated 
with lithium (compared to valproate treatment) was minimal when serum concentrations of 
lithium were kept below 0.7mmol/L.34 These findings are also in keeping with a controlled 
study in older adults with mild cognitive impairment,30,35 in which long-term use of 
lithium carbonate at sub-therapeutic concentrations was not associated with a decline in 
renal function after four years of follow-up. We concede that the absence of association 
between lithium treatment and renal impairment can also be an artefact arising from data 
harmonisation or participant selection. Patients with more severe comorbid conditions (e.g., 
renal failure) may have been excluded from the studies that contributed to the GAGE-BD 
dataset. Alternatively, discontinuation of lithium treatment due to incident adverse events 
could selectively and artefactually increase the rate of these conditions in the non-lithium 
group. However, the study by Burton and colleagues32 does not support this hypothesis, 
given that they found no statistically significant differences in adverse effects or changes in 
laboratory parameters when comparing patients treated with lithium vs. second-generation 
antipsychotics in a long-term retrospective cohort.

Interestingly, cardiovascular comorbidities were less frequent among lithium users. This 
is in keeping with the preponderance of hypertension and metabolic syndrome among 
OABD, with uneven distribution across therapeutic groups.36 In a nationwide study using 
Danish healthcare registries including all BD patients and community cases of cardiac 
arrest, lithium was not shown to be associated with increased rates of cardiac arrest, as 
compared to subjects receiving no mood-stabilising drugs or monotherapy with atypical 
antipsychotics or anticonvulsants.37 The lower rates of cardiovascular disorders could also 
reflect lower rates of antipsychotic exposure in the lithium group. Yet, this finding could also 
reflect prescription bias, where better functioning and healthier individuals with BD may 
be considered better candidates for treatment with lithium in routine clinical practice. Our 
descriptive data suggest a trend that favours lithium users in this regard, although cumulative 
somatic burden was not statistically associated with lithium use. The present data do not 
allow dismissing residual confounding and confounding due to unmeasured factors; still, 
the lack of association between lithium use and somatic burden suggests that the observed 
associations were not driven by a selection bias favouring the prescription of lithium for 
healthier patients. The same applies to body weight. Lithium users had lower body weight 
and this may be explained by lower use of antipsychotics in that group and also the fact that 
weight gain is relatively limited in patients treated with lithium.38 Some antipsychotics carry 
much higher weight-gain liability39 and are also more likely to be prescribed in more severe 
patients, with more comorbidities.

The present study has several strengths. Most of the clinical findings in OABD come from 
single-site studies, which are limited by small sample sizes and local composition of patient 
groups. These methodological constraints invariably weaken the statistical power of analyses 
and the generalisability of findings. The combination and integration of data from multiple 
study sites is potentially circumventing the challenge of interpreting findings from smaller

studies, taking advantage of the fact that many research groups utilise similar assessment 
methods in their protocols, along with the possibility of harmonising data where different, 
but equivalent, measurement tools are used to evaluate overlapping construct domains.3 
Nonetheless, the interpretation of our results requires caution, given the methodological 
limitations inherent to this approach. First, the cross-sectional design precludes the 
establishment of cause-effect relationships.40 Also, clustering and harmonisation of archival 
data obtained from different protocols, and using different assessment scales and instruments 
to collect data for depression, mania and cognition, may undermine the reliability of 
the information collected, preventing stratification and a more detailed assessment of 
associations. It is noteworthy that the present sample had low manic symptom severity. 
Therefore, findings might have been different in the presence of more significant manic 
symptoms or episodes, as there is likely differential in who is prescribed lithium (as opposed 
to antipsychotic drugs) based on manic symptoms, as well as in manic vs. depressive 
symptom response. Besides, the dataset we used in this analysis did not contain information 
about current use of other common medications used in BD, such as antidepressants and 
anticonvulsants. Another shortcoming is the lack of information about lifetime exposure to 
lithium, meaning that the present analysis was restricted to the availability of information 
about current lithium use, overlooking any potential effects of past treatments — either 
beneficial or deleterious. Also, detailed information about lithium treatment (e.g. serum 
levels or dosing; duration of exposure; compliance, etc.) was only available in a few subsets 
of data. Aiming for such specific questions would create unbalanced and underpowered 
subgroups, so these variables were not included in the analyses. At the same time, we aimed 
for generalizability. Clinicians would often see people where these additional variables are 
unknown and yet it is still relevant to ask what are the general characteristics of people who 
are currently on lithium, and if these characteristics differ from people who are not currently 
on lithium. This was our main question, which capitalized on the large and generalizable 
sample and which closely resembled clinical practice.

It is also possible that some non-lithium users could be lithium failures (i.e., lithium 
was tried but discontinued), while others could have been lithium-naïve. In addition, the 
relatively low proportion (56%) of cases with information about lithium use in relation to the 
total number of participants in the original dataset indicates that the prescription of lithium 
was not balanced with other drugs equally recommended for the treatment of BD. Therefore, 
prescriber bias – including site-related prescription preferences – may have influenced the 
observed associations. Thus, lithium may have been prescribed to patients who were more 
compliant with treatment, more adherent to clinical recommendations, generally healthier, 
or those with a specific subtype of BD. These suppositions are reinforced by some of our 
findings, such as the association between lithium use and education (i.e., additional years 
of schooling increasing the odds of lithium use), and the lower frequency of psychiatric 
comorbidities or family history of BD among lithium users.

In conclusion, we found salient differences between OABD individuals treated with lithium 
compared to those treated with other mood stabilisers. The lithium-treated group generally 
had a more favourable clinical profile, with better global cognitive state and functionality, 
lower levels of depressive symptoms and fewer comorbid psychiatric and cardiovascular 
disorders. Future prospective studies should clarify whether these clinical characteristics are

drivers or consequences of lithium prescription. Regardless, the notion that clinical benefits 
of lithium use by older adults are overshadowed by unacceptable risks and adverse outcomes 
is not warranted by the present results, therefore supporting the prescription and careful 
monitoring of lithium treatment for BD in geriatric patients.

Significant Outcomes:

•

•

•

In a sample of 986 older adults with bipolar disorder (OABD), lithium use 
was associated with a more favourable clinical profile, compared to those 
treated with other drugs.

Lithium users had lower levels of depressive symptoms, better global 
cognitive/functional state, fewer comorbid psychiatric and cardiovascular 
disorders, and less antipsychotic use.

The present data do not support the notion that lithium use by OABD is 
necessarily associated with unacceptable risks and adverse outcomes.

Limitations:

•

•

•

The interpretation of findings must take into account the methodological 
limitations related to the cross-sectional design and data harmonisation.

The dataset we used had limited information about lifetime exposure to 
lithium; the present analysis was restricted to the availability of information 
about current lithium use.

Non-inclusion of patients with more severe comorbid conditions in the 
lithium group, as well as the discontinuation of lithium treatment due to 
incident adverse events, could selectively and artefactually increase the rate of 
these conditions in the comparison group.
