Abstract

Purpose of review—To provide the reader with an overview of the cognitive-behavioral 
conceptualization of cancer related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) and how cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) can play an important role in treatment.

Recent findings—Recent findings show that Memory and Attention Adaptation training 
(MAAT), a CBT developed to help cancer survivors develop adaptive skills to improve daily 
cognitive performance and emotional coping, may be an efficacious treatment of CRCD and can 
be delivered through videoconference technology to improve survivor access to care.

Summary—The etiology of CRCD remains largely undetermined and likely is produced by 
multiple mechanisms. This can include neuronal death, microvascular damage, inflammatory 
processes and psychological factors of perceptions of inadequate cognitive capacity to meet 
performance demands and related emotional distress. As a result, there are a variety of treatments 
currently being researched. More research with larger sample sizes, multiple clinicians and 
multiple sites are needed to confirm efficacy, but CBT approaches such as MAAT that address 
multiple psychological factors involved may offer a flexible non-pharmacological approach to 
CRCD that optimizes quality of life outcomes.

Introduction

Cancer survival rates over the last 50 years have improved significantly, largely due to early 
detection of disease and more effective treatment (1). The present 5-year relative survival 
rate of all cancers is 68%, while worldwide, there are 32.6 million cancer survivors (2). In 
the midst of this good news is the public health concern of growing numbers of survivors

with late effects of disease, treatment or both. Addressing the unique needs of cancer 
survivors to optimize long-term health function and quality of life well beyond the cessation 
of active cancer treatment is a priority in cancer care (1, 3).

Late cognitive effects of systemic therapies for non-central nervous system (non-CNS) 
disease is an ongoing focus of survivorship research and health care (4–6). Reviews of 
research over the last 2.5 decades estimate rates of long-term cancer-related cognitive 
dysfunction (CRCD; ≥ 1 year post-treatment) range from about 25% to nearly 50% (4–6).

Neuropsychological domains most commonly affected involve verbal memory, verbal 
working memory, attention and processing speed (4, 7). In most cases, the level of cognitive 
impairment when assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests is within a mild or 
moderate range and often at the lower end of neuropsychological testing norms (6). Higher 
quality studies of both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs have controlled for 
confounding factors that contribute to cognitive dysfunction such as depression, fatigue, 
anxiety and past history of CNS injury, suggesting that systemic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy 
and/or endocrine therapy) does cause cognitive decline among some individuals (4–6).

While CRCD is objectively assessed as mild to moderate with neuropsychological 
measurements, the quality of life impact can be substantial (8, 9). When survivors begin to 
resume pre-cancer vocational or social roles following active treatment, cognitive 
performance demands increase. It is often at this time point in survivorship when decrements 
in cognitive function begin to interfere with daily vocational, educational or family function 
(8–11). Intervening at this stage of survivorship (or ideally, before) is the intention of 
Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT) and other CBT approaches.

Cognitive-Behavioral Conceptualization of CRCD

The etiology of CRCD is thought to involve multiple mechanisms, including neuronal death 
through direct toxicity, microvascular damage, and neural disruption through inflammatory 
processes (12). A cognitive-behavioral conceptualization is concerned less with the 
biological event(s) triggering CRCD but more with the individual’s psychological response 
to injury. MAAT assumes a “diathesis-stress” conceptualization. Under routine and low 
demand conditions, interacting neurocognitive systems (memory, attention, planned 
behavior and emotion regulation) function well for survivors. By contrast, under conditions 
of increased demand, cognitive failures may be more frequent and produce negative 
consequences. It is at this point where the survivor experiences a perception of disparity 
between “perceived threat level” (or increased demands on memory) and available resources 
(lowered perceived cognitive abilities) that leads to increased arousal, distress and in turn 
reduced cognitive performance. The perception of disparity of memory demand and 
perceived cognitive abilities is consistent with the Lazarus (13) two-step appraisal model of 
stress. That is, perceptions of threat or increased demands for memory performance are not 
enough to trigger stress responses— it also requires the perception that personal or external 
resources are inadequate to meet the threat. This process is depicted on the right side of 
Figure 1. Perceptions of inadequate cognitive abilities can increase emotional arousal, 
leading to cognitive interference with attention, encoding and recall, leading to an attribution 
of distress-related cognitive interference to CRCD—reinforcing confirmatory beliefs of

inadequate cognitive abilities. These psychological responses are hypothesized to not 
“cause” CRCD but play a maintaining role in the distressing experience. The “diatheses” of 
CRCD include vulnerabilities in cognitive function produced by the survivor’s exposure to 
chemotherapy and other factors such as pre-cancer neurocognitive status, education, age, 
genetic predispositions, cognitive reserve (5) and emotional resilience (3). The more 
survivors with CRCD can train and make effective use of existing cognitive capacities AND 
learn and apply new skills, the better the cognitive task performance, perceptions of memory 
self-efficacy (the belief one has the skills or resources to meet demands) and distress 
reduction. MAAT’s central aim as a CBT is to build adaptive skills and mastery experience 
to reduce disparity between perceived coping resources and cognitive demands.

There is evidence supporting this model from brain imaging literature. Compared with 
healthy controls and breast cancer survivors not undergoing chemotherapy, survivors who 
have had chemotherapy appear to have nearly similar objective memory test performance. 
Yet, chemotherapy-exposed survivors demonstrate significantly more cortical activation and 
report more subjective symptoms during task performance, especially with increased task 
difficulty (14–16). This may explain why survivors report more subjective complaints than 
healthy counterparts but may score in normal neuropsychological test ranges and encounter 
greater cognitive failure at the point of resuming pre-cancer work and home roles (6).

CBT and MAAT

In the treatment of CRCD, CBT differs from traditional cognitive retraining. Cognitive 
retraining involves repetitive tasks to hypothetically enhance neural networking to bypass 
damaged brain regions. This usually entails computerized exercises with incremental 
increases in task difficulty based on performance (e.g., once 85% correct response is 
achieved, the practice task increases in difficulty, and the process is repeated). The “dosing” 
of daily practice varies but one study suggests daily sessions of 20–30 minutes for 12–15 
weeks (17). By contrast, CBT involves the acquisition of skills to make adaptive behavioral 
and cognitive changes on daily tasks for which memory is used (18, 19). For example, this 
might include using a verbal rehearsal method to aid working memory for transposing 
numbers from a computer to a written form at the workplace, or learning how to use and 
apply a smart phone calendar with alerts to transition to important tasks such as paying a 
household bill.

In recent reviews, cognitive retraining was found to be helpful but one shortcoming of the 
approach is the lack of generalizability or “transfer” of cognitive improvement from practice 
tasks (computer game) to real-world tasks (2, 20–22). CBT enhances self-awareness of 
where memory problems are likely to occur and directly trains individuals to apply 
compensatory strategies in those specific cognitive tasks. This might involve self-monitoring 
of memory failures to better understand the environmental and internal personal factors that 
contribute to the memory failure risk of a given individual so that compensatory strategies 
designed to reduce memory failure occurrence can be learned and targeted for specific 
situations. Two CBT approaches cited in some of these reviews were delivered in 5 or 4 
weekly group visits. Both were found to improve neurocognitive outcomes in domains of 
verbal memory and processing speed and self-reported cognitive symptoms (23, 24).

However, the Ercoli study did not involve any control group which limits conclusions due to 
the effects of practice with repeat neurocognitive testing (23). Similarly, the Schuurs study 
had limitations. While the investigators used a wait-list control group to account for 
neurocognitive testing practice effects, participants were not randomized to either the 
treatment or control condition. This brings into question the possibility of selection bias in 
the final sample— for instance, participants in the treatment condition (N = 23) could have 
put forth greater effort in neurocognitive testing and report more favorable self-reports of 
cognitive function post-treatment. In addition, some of the neurocognitive assessments were 
conducted by one of the interventionists in the study, which the authors report as a limitation 
(24).

At present, the MAAT CBT approach has evidence in three small studies (N = 29, 40 and 35, 
respectively) with improved methodology (e.g., blind assessors, randomization) that 
demonstrate gains in neurocognitive outcomes, self-reported cognitive symptoms and quality 
of life (10, 25, 26). This research is highlighted below with a more detailed description of 
MAAT.

As a CBT, MAAT’s current format involves eight weekly visits of 30–45 minutes duration 
and can be delivered effectively through videoconference technology (10). Survivors are 
provided a workbook to reinforce learning and mastery of skills covered in visits. MAAT has 
four components: 1) Education on chemotherapy-related cognitive problems and other 
influences on normal attention and memory such as stress “normal forgetting” (27–29). This 
reduces misattribution that All daily memory failure can be due to chemotherapy—a less 
controllable causal attribution— and raises the possibility of more controllable causes such 
as stress response. This causal attributional shift may enhance coping with CRCD through 
stopping the iterative distress cycle seen in Figure 1. 2) A second key aspect of MAAT is 
self-awareness training. That is, using self-monitoring to help survivors identify “at risk” 
environmental, social, physical or emotional conditions under which cognitive failures 
occur, which enables survivors to tailor compensatory strategies to specific tasks. 3) 
Compensatory strategies training for application in “at risk” situations that may directly 
improve cognitive performance. Common compensatory strategies include Self-Instructional 
Training (SIT), or a method of “self-talk” to enhance on-task attention, using a day planner, 
verbal rehearsal, active listening and visualization strategies. 4) Stress management methods 
of applied relaxation training, cognitive restructuring to modify negative appraisals of 
cognitive failure with activity scheduling for arousal and stress self-regulation (30–32).

MAAT Research: Study 1—MAAT was pilot tested for feasibility and to determine if it 
could positively influence daily cognitive symptoms, neurocognitive test performance and 
quality of life. In a single-arm pilot study (25), 29 breast cancer survivors (mean 8.2 years 
post-chemotherapy) reporting cognitive problems completed MAAT. Principal outcome 
measures included the Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire (MASQ; self-report of 
cognitive function in daily life)(33), the Quality of Life-Cancer Survivors scale (QOL-CS)
(34), satisfaction ratings and a brief neurocognitive test battery administered at baseline, 
post-treatment, two-month and six-month follow-up with supplemental funding. Results 
indicated significant reductions in daily cognitive complaints, improved quality of life and 
high satisfaction. Neurocognitive improvements in verbal memory and processing speed

were also observed. However, with no control group, it was impossible to rule out effects of 
practice with repeat neurocognitive testing.

MAAT Research: Study 2—The second MAAT study was a small waitlist (no treatment) 
control RCT (31). Forty breast cancer survivors at least 18 months post-chemotherapy and 
reporting cognitive problems were randomized to MAAT (n = 19) or waitlist control (n = 21) 
conditions and assessed at baseline, post-treatment and two-month follow-up. Controlling 
for education and IQ, MAAT participants made significant improvements over waitlist 
participants on quality of life and verbal memory as assessed by the California Verbal 
Learning Test-II (CVLT-II). Subtracting wait-list control effects, the pre-to-post-treatment 
effect size for the CVLT-2 total score was −.50 and quality of life effect size was −.49 (note 
that the negative sign does not change the magnitude of effect). CVLT-II scores for MAAT 
participants also improved at two-month follow-up (d = −.63). While results in this small 
RCT were encouraging, an active control condition was needed to rule out effects of social 
attention and demand characteristics of study participation. In addition, improvement in self-
report and neurocognitive outcome measures had been improved upon and were 
incorporated in the next trial. MAAT was also intended to be electronically delivered with 
videoconference technology to improve access to survivorship care, which has been a 
challenge for both comprehensive and community cancer centers (1, 35).

MAAT Research: Study 3—In the third MAAT trial, Ferguson, et al. (2016) added an 
active control condition, supportive therapy (ST) and increased the number of weekly 
MAAT visits to eight to enhance therapeutic intensity (10). ST is a common active control 
condition in CBT trials to control for psychological therapy “common factors” such as 
interpersonal warmth, empathy and treatment expectation. The Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-Cognitive scale (FACT-Cog) was added as a primary self-report outcome 
measure which was available at the time of design of the third MAAT trial (36). Both MAAT 
and ST were delivered via videoconference network linking rural health centers in the state 
of Maine. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate electronic delivery feasibility/
efficacy with a small final sample size (N=35). Adjusting for baseline differences, MAAT 
participants improved in FACT-Cog perceived cognitive impairments over ST at two-month 
follow-up with moderately large effect size (p = .02; d =.52; trend at post-treatment p =.09). 
In neurocognitive outcomes, MAAT participants made significant improvement in 
processing speed over controls at post-treatment (p = .03; d = .50) but not on verbal memory. 
Finally, MAAT participants had a trend (p = .07) of improvement over ST in anxiety about 
cognitive symptoms (meta-memory in adulthood anxiety scale) but with a large size of effect 
(d = .90) at two-month follow-up. This suggests MAAT participants continued to make gains 
in emotion distress reduction through continued mastery and use of coping skills while ST 
participants (who did not receive skills training) regressed to baseline two-months after 
cessation of therapeutic attention. MAAT participants reported high satisfaction with 
treatment and they were highly likely to recommend treatment to a friend. Finally, MAAT 
participants indicated they likely would have not been able to participate without 
videoconference delivery due to travel burdens and lack of paid leave from work that was 
exhausted during active cancer treatment.

Conclusion

Page 6

At the present time, there are several treatment approaches to CRCD that range from 
pharmacological approaches, physical activity and computerized cognitive retraining (20–
22) but no treatment is empirically established as a standard for clinical use. CBT does offer 
a practical approach for enhancing cognitive function and quality of life improvement in 
daily life to address the consequences of CRCD in long-term survivorship. MAAT is one 
CBT approach that has accumulated preliminary evidence of efficacy and can likely be 
easily translated to survivorship service given that CBT is reimbursed by third party payers 
when delivered by trained professionals (e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse 
practitioners and licensed counselors). Moreover, recent research suggests MAAT can be 
flexibly delivered using videoconference technology with positive outcomes.

While promising, MAAT research to date has limitations that should be addressed in future 
investigations. These limitations apply to the other CRCD treatment approaches cited here 
and include: small sample sizes, only one clinician delivering active treatment or the active 
control condition (e.g., MAAT and ST/attention control), single research sites and most 
research has been limited to breast cancer survivors only (8, 20–22). Recent reviews of 
CRCD treatment research have recommended that future trials utilize multiple sites with 
multiple clinicians and active treatment control conditions. With these methodological 
improvements, there will likely be an increase in confidence of results with respect to 
external validity and generalizability of treatment that can readily translate to clinical 
practice for survivors. Much of the research funding for CRCD has focused primarily on 
identifying specific mechanisms of cognitive change in various cancer populations with less 
funding targeting CRCD treatment research. Larger funding mechanisms, collaborations 
between institutions with multi-site trials and combining treatment research with imaging 
research may be one solution to address resource limitations for CRCD treatment and also 
help identify questions of how treatment can enhance CRCD recovery.

Finally, utilization of various forms of treatment delivery, including videoconference 
technology, may reduce barriers to survivorship care access and increase dissemination of 
CBT for CRCD. MAAT does have some evidence of effective videoconference delivery and 
larger, multisite studies such as those described above are planned. MAAT may also be 
delivered in group formats to leverage time and space in busy clinical settings. In addition, 
self-guided mobile device apps of interventions of CRCD may provide even further survivor 
access to care and may be more convenient and affordable than standard CBT (37). 
However, some research suggests that web-based or mobile-device self-guided apps are 
viewed as less than satisfactory for a majority of research participants in studies of such 
treatments(38). Nonetheless, they do appear to be helpful for some. In future research on 
CBT for CRCD, it may likely be most fruitful to develop a range of less intensive to more 
intensive therapeutic approaches in a stepped care fashion that allows more survivor choice 
and tailoring to individual needs.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is one treatment modality that has been 
evaluated and can be tailored to the specific areas of concerns that cancer
