Abstract
Purpose of Review  We review recent evidence on Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD), including risk factors and precipitants, 
diagnostic classification, clinical characteristics of the disorder, and assessment and treatment in both children and adults.
Recent Findings  IAD places a substantial burden on both individuals and society. Despite its impact, understanding of the 
disorder is lacking and debates remain about whether IAD should be classified as an anxiety disorder and whether it is dis-
tinct from Somatic Symptom Disorder. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for IAD and there are 
multiple validated measures of health anxiety available. However, research on health anxiety in children and youth is limited.
Summary  IAD is chronic, and debilitating, but when identified, it can be effectively treated with CBT. Research using DSM-5 
IAD criteria is lacking, and more research is needed to better understand the disorder, particularly in children and youth.

Introduction

While many individuals experience transient health concerns 
throughout their lives, a subset of individuals experience 
enduring and distressing anxiety about health and illness. Ill-
ness Anxiety Disorder (IAD) is a new disorder introduced in 
the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders [DSM-5; 1], replacing the DSM-IV Hypo-
chondriasis diagnosis. IAD is characterised by an intense 
fear of having or acquiring a serious medical disease or ill-
ness, such as cancer, heart disease or other significant condi-
tions. Individuals with IAD experience illness-related cog-
nitions, such as intrusive thoughts and images, and engage 
in various maladaptive coping behaviours, such as seeking 
excessive medical reassurance, searching for health informa-
tion online, and checking their body for signs of illness. The 
DSM-5 proposes two subtypes of IAD: the ‘care-seeking’ 
subtype for individuals who frequently seek medical care

and the ‘care-avoidant’ subtype for individuals who avoid 
medical care. As IAD is a new disorder, historically, much 
of the research has focused on samples exhibiting DSM-IV 
Hypochondriasis (which focused on excessive preoccupation 
with having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance) 
or excessive and persistent ‘health anxiety’ using dimen-
sional measures (which can encompass current and previous 
DSM diagnoses and subthreshold symptoms). In this review, 
we use the term IAD for research on the new DSM-5 diag-
nosis, and the term health anxiety for the broader literature 
which informs current understanding of IAD.

Epidemiology: Prevalence, and Impact

Health anxiety can be conceptualised on a continuum, rang-
ing from mild to severe [2, 3], with IAD at the severe end 
of this spectrum [1]. The prevalence of health anxiety in 
the general adult population varies considerably across the 
literature and is estimated to range between 2.1–13.1% [4, 
5]. The prevalence rates of health anxiety are higher in medi-
cal settings such as primary care (i.e., general practitioner 
clinics) and secondary care (i.e., specialised outpatient or 
inpatient clinics) than in the general community, ranging 
between 7% and 19.9% [6–8]. Health anxiety has been on

332

the rise over the past three decades in both the community 
and medical settings [8, 9•]. This increase has been fur-
ther exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, where health 
anxiety and fears of COVID-19 were common [10]. If left 
untreated, health anxiety is chronic, episodic, and can last 
for years [11, 12]. Unlike depression and anxiety disorders, 
which tend to show higher rates in females, health anxiety 
affects men and women equally [13–15]. While the onset of 
health anxiety typically occurs in early adulthood [1], some 
research suggests that it may start as early as childhood in 
some cases [12, 13, 16–18].

Health anxiety causes significant impact and impairment 
to individuals and society. For example, health anxious indi-
viduals report worse self-rated health, more interference 
with daily activities such as household duties, self-care and 
mobility, more personal distress, and are at increased risk 
of early mortality [4, 19–21]. Health anxiety impacts at a 
societal level; individuals with health anxiety report more 
absenteeism from work than the general population [22] and 
higher health care utilisation even compared to individuals 
with well-defined medical conditions [11]. Although the sig-
nificant burden of health anxiety on individuals and society 
is recognised, there are gaps in our understanding of the 
condition. This review aims to summarise recent literature 
on health anxiety, and specifically on Illness Anxiety Disor-
der (where research has studied the new DSM-5 diagnosis), 
identify research gaps, discuss ongoing debates, and suggest 
avenues for future research to enhance our understanding of 
the condition.

Issues with Diagnosis and Classification

Diagnostic Criteria

According to the DSM-5, IAD is only diagnosed when a per-
son experiences either no or mild somatic symptoms. If they 
experience health anxiety with moderate to severe somatic 
symptoms, they may be diagnosed with Somatic Symptom 
Disorder (SSD) instead [1]. For an IAD diagnosis, the indi-
vidual will experience excessive worry about either having 
or developing a serious medical illness, which persists for 
six months or more. The individual will be highly vigilant 
about their personal health status, resulting in various mala-
daptive coping behaviours (i.e., checking their bodies for 
signs of illness, excessively searching the internet for health-
related information, and making frequent visits to medical 
settings). Individuals with an SSD diagnosis will experience 
excessive and persistent thoughts related to the seriousness 
of their moderate-to severe somatic symptoms, and/or high 
levels of anxiety about their health or symptoms and dedi-
cate significant time to researching and understanding their 
symptoms in depth. Their somatic symptoms must also last 

longer than 6 months but can change across their course. 
IAD and SSD were put forward to replace DSM-IV Hypo-
chondriasis due to its limited clinical validity, and research 
suggests that IAD and SSD are more reliable than Hypo-
chondriasis [12]. However, having two separate diagnoses is 
not clinically useful, as research has found there are few dif-
ferences in how individuals with health anxiety experience 
the disorders [12, 23••, 24, 25]. Specifically, the differences 
that have been reported relate to symptom severity, whereby 
IAD characterizes individuals with a milder form of health 
anxiety and SSD represents individuals with a more severe 
form of health anxiety. Additionally, research has shown that 
both IAD and SSD respond similarly to psychological treat-
ment [26]. Furthermore, recent research done by our team 
[25] showed that there were no differences on demographic 
characteristics, clinical characteristics (i.e., depression and 
generalized anxiety severity, quality of life related to mental 
health), the nature and course of health anxiety, or mental 
health comorbidity, between people who met IAD criteria 
with no/mild somatic symptoms versus those with moderate-
to-severe somatic symptoms. These findings suggest that 
the distinction in somatic symptom severity between these 
disorders might be arbitrary [25,  27]. Further research is 
needed to understand whether restricting IAD to only those 
with minimal somatic symptoms is clinically useful.

The DSM-5 categorizes IAD into two subtypes: ‘care-
seeking’ for individuals that frequently seek medical care, 
and ‘care-avoidant’ for individuals that frequently avoid 
medical care. Although researchers have proposed that indi-
viduals seek care as a form of reassurance and avoid care 
out of an overwhelming fear of having a serious disease 
[28], evidence about these behaviours remains scarce. To 
date, our team conducted the only study investigating the 
prevalence of IAD subtypes and found that 25% met cri-
teria for the ‘care-seeking’ subtype, 14% met criteria for 
the ‘care-avoidant’ subtype, and interestingly, 61% reported 
fluctuating between seeking and avoiding care. This sug-
gests that there may be a third subtype of IAD which needs 
further study [12].

Classification

There has been a long-standing debate about whether health 
anxiety would be better classified under “Anxiety Disorders” 
than under its current classification “Somatic Symptom 
and Related Disorders” due to its shared features and high 
comorbidity with anxiety disorders, namely Panic Disorder, 
Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder  [29–32].  For  example,  health  anxiety  involves 
both hypervigilance to bodily sensations (a common char-
acteristic in Panic Disorder) and excessive worry (a core 
feature of Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Research using 
the DSM-IV Hypochondriasis criteria has shown higher 

Current Psychiatry Reports (2024) 26:331–339 

333

levels of comorbidity with anxiety disorders than comorbid 
depressive or somatoform disorders [33]. Similarly, sub-
stantial comorbidity was found between DSM-5 IAD and 
other anxiety disorders, particularly Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder and Panic Disorder [12]. To determine whether 
IAD should be better classified as an anxiety disorder, future 
research should investigate whether IAD symptom profiles, 
course, treatment response and comorbidities more closely 
align with anxiety disorders compared with other somatic 
symptom disorders.

Cognitive and Behavioural Aspects  
of Health Anxiety

Theories

Several theories have been proposed to explain the devel-
opment of health anxiety. The most widely tested theory 
is based on the cognitive-behavioural model [34] which 
suggests that individuals with health anxiety tend to misin-
terpret bodily sensations, often attributing them to serious 
illness or disease. This catastrophic thinking leads to the 
adoption of maladaptive safety behaviours, such as seeking 
excessive medical reassurance, googling of symptoms and, 
in some cases, avoiding medical settings or individuals who 
are sick as a way to manage anxiety symptoms. This theo-
retical model of health anxiety has been subject to empirical 
investigation, and research broadly supports the components 
of this model [35].

The other major theory of health anxiety is based on the 
interpersonal model [36]. This model proposes that anx-
ious and insecure attachments derived from caregivers in 
early childhood leads to increased maladaptive care-seeking 
behaviours and reassurance seeking in adulthood [37]. The 
core tenant of this theory is that insecurely attached indi-
viduals seek emotional support via complaints of physical 
illness and symptoms to reduce the feelings of insecurity. 
It is important to note that this theory has not been widely 
tested.

Cognitive Components

One of the core characteristics of health anxiety is the pres-
ence of dysfunctional health beliefs, i.e., the preoccupation 
with the inaccurate belief that one has, or is in danger of 
developing, a serious medical illness [38]. These beliefs 
persist despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassur-
ance [39]. Dysfunctional health-related beliefs comprise of 
either disease conviction (i.e., the belief one has a feared 
illness or disease) and/or fear of contracting an illness or 
disease [40]. Salkovskis and Warwick’s [40] Cognitive-
Behavioural Model of health anxiety identifies four types 

of dysfunctional beliefs central to health anxiety, including 
the perceived i) likelihood and ii) awfulness of experiencing 
a health problem, iii) the inability to cope with experiencing 
a health problem, and (iv) inadequacy of medical resources 
to treat a health problem [40, 41]. These beliefs are key vul-
nerability and maintaining factors in health anxiety [42, 43], 
and are argued to develop in response to aversive learning 
experiences during childhood or later in life, such as the 
death or illness of an attachment figure [44].

It is proposed that these beliefs contribute to catastrophic 
misinterpretations of the significance of health-related stim-
uli, such as bodily sensations or changes in bodily func-
tions or appearance, leading to intense anxiety [45]. A key 
contribution to this misinterpretation is an attentional bias 
towards health-threat related stimuli, which has shown to 
be strongly associated with health anxiety in a recent sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis [46]. Health-anxious indi-
viduals have also been shown to experience more frequent 
and intense illness-related intrusive thoughts [47, 48], and to 
demonstrate a selective negative interpretation bias of these 
thoughts or sensations [49].

Further  cognitive  constructs  related  to  health  anxi-
ety include higher levels of anxiety sensitivity, the fear of 
arousal-related bodily sensations [50,  51], health-related 
rumination [52], and health-related intolerance of uncer-
tainty which is essentially a reduced capacity to endure the 
perception of missing important information [53–55].

Behavioural Components

To manage anxiety and distress triggered by these dysfunc-
tional beliefs and interpretations, health-anxious individu-
als employ a range of maladaptive coping or safety-seeking 
behaviours. Each of these behaviours is maladaptive in that 
although they reduce distress in the short-term, they pre-
vent the disconfirmation of incorrect health-anxious beliefs, 
thus maintaining the disorder [56]. These typically com-
prise of reassurance-seeking from external sources (e.g., 
loved ones or doctors), excessive body checking behaviours 
(e.g., repeatedly taking blood pressure) and/or avoidance 
of disease-related cues (e.g., hospitals) [57]. Compulsive 
and excessive online researching about health worries is a 
key feature seen in health anxiety, also known as ‘cyber-
chondria’ [58]. Overutilisation of health services is also 
considered a core maladaptive coping behaviour in health  
anxiety [11, 59].

Risk Factors and Precipitants

Research into precipitants and risk factors for IAD is lack-
ing. Several life experiences have been proposed as pre-
cipitants of health anxiety, such as experiencing major life 

334 

Current Psychiatry Reports (2024) 26:331–339

stress, a serious threat to one’s health, witnessing a loved 
one’s illness, and being exposed to health-threatening infor-
mation [34, 45]. However, evidence supporting these pre-
cipitants is lacking.

No studies have examined risk factors for developing 
IAD using the new DSM-5 criteria. However, a recent sys-
tematic review of studies using dimensional health anxiety 
measures showed some evidence of a positive association 
between childhood experiences of illness, intergenerational 
transmission of health anxiety (including genetic heritability 
and vicarious observations of parents with health anxiety), 
childhood traumatic experiences, and the development of 
health anxiety [60]. However, it is unclear whether these risk 
factors were specific to health anxiety or general risk factors 
for internalizing disorders. Of the limited research that has 
been conducted investigating the intergenerational transmis-
sion of health anxiety, a twin study found that 34–37% of 
health anxiety traits, such as fear of illness and interference 
with functioning caused by bodily sensations, were related 
to genetics, whereas the remaining traits were attributed to 
environmental factors [61].

Neurobiology

There has been a lack of research examining the neurobio-
logical basis for IAD and health anxiety more broadly. Stud-
ies using the emotional stroop task and implicit association 
test have both showed increased amygdala activation, as well 
as activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex [62] and 
right posterior parietal cortex and nucleus accumbens [63] 
in response to body-symptom words between health anxious 
and healthy controls. In contrast, a recent study found no dif-
ferences in amygdala activity or any brain activity between 
patients  with  health  anxiety  and  healthy  controls  when 
exposed to health-related pictures [55]. More research is 
needed to understand the biological underpinnings of IAD.

Assessment and Treatment

Assessment

Dimensional measures of health anxiety are widely used to 
determine the presence of severe and pathological health 
anxiety. The three most widely used assessment measures 
are the Whitley Index [64], Illness Attitude Scale [65], and 
the Health Anxiety Inventory [66]. All three measures have 
been psychometrically validated and shown good reliability 
[66, 67]. A shortened version of the Health Anxiety Inven-
tory [66] and Whitley Index 6 [68] have been developed and 
widely used in clinical settings due to their practicality and 
brief nature [69, 70]. However, due to the lack of research 

in IAD samples, the optimal cut-off scores to detect IAD on 
these widely used measures are unknown (as studies have 
validated them against Hypochondriasis criteria).

Diagnostic instruments have also been developed and 
used  to  assess  IAD.  The  three  most  widely  used  stand-
ardized, semi-structured interviews are: The Anxiety and 
Related Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-5 – Adult 
Version [71], the Health Preoccupation Diagnostic Inter-
view [72], and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 
(SCID-5) [73].

Treatment

The most widely supported evidence based psychological 
treatment for health anxiety and IAD is Cognitive Behav-
ioural Therapy (CBT). CBT typically consists of strategies 
including psychoeducation; cognitive restructuring of cata-
strophic beliefs about health and bodily symptoms; behav-
ioural strategies to reduce hypervigilance to body sensations 
and compulsive coping behaviours such as body checking, 
reassurance-seeking, and avoidance; and relapse preven-
tion. Evidence from meta-analyses [74, 75••, 76] shows that 
CBT is a highly efficacious and cost-effective treatment for 
health anxiety, with a moderate to large pooled effect size on 
health anxiety [Hedge’s g = 0.81, 95% CI [0.37, 1.26]; 76] 
compared to non-CBT controls, with improvements largely 
maintained over 12–18 months [74]. Evidence also supports 
the delivery of CBT for health anxiety and IAD online [26, 
58, 77], with large effect sizes when delivered in routine care 
[78, 79]. For example, a non-inferiority trial compared inter-
net-delivered to face-to-face CBT (including health anxious 
sample with either IAD and SSD) and found no difference 
in outcome, but with internet-delivered therapy resulting in 
lower net societal costs [80].

Although less research has been conducted on other psy-
chological therapies for health anxiety, some evidence also 
supports the use of third-wave therapies for health anxiety 
such as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) 
[81, 82] and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) 
[83, 84], although no studies have tested them in IAD spe-
cifically.  MBCT  treats  health  anxiety  through  applying 
mindfulness techniques to defuse from catastrophic health 
cognitions, reduce attentional bias towards physiological 
symptoms, and confront rather than experientially avoid 
feared body sensations, thus reducing unhelpful avoidance 
or safety-seeking behaviours [85]. Acceptance and Commit-
ment Therapy (ACT) similarly aims to treat health anxiety 
by reducing experiential avoidance of distressing illness-
related thoughts, feelings, and body sensations, promoting 
acceptance of these inner states, while clarifying values 
and encouraging behaviours that contribute to a meaning-
ful life [84]. A recent randomised controlled trial involving 
ACT delivered online showed large effect sizes in reducing 

Current Psychiatry Reports (2024) 26:331–339 

335

health anxiety at six-month follow up compared to control 
(d = 0.80, 95% CI 0.38–1.23) [83]. Pharmacotherapy studies 
are lacking, but two studies into treatments for Hypochondri-
asis support the use of Fluoxetine in combination with CBT, 
or alone [86, 87], and another earlier study found Paroxetine 
yielded similar effectiveness to CBT for hypochondriasis 
[88]. No pharmacological studies have yet been conducted 
on the new IAD diagnosis.

Children and Youth

Cross-sectional studies have shown that children and adoles-
cents can experience severe health anxiety as assessed using 
dimensional measures [89, 90]. However, research examining 
the prevalence of health anxiety using diagnostic criteria sug-
gests that very few children meet full diagnostic criteria [18, 
91, 92], leading researchers to argue that this could be due to a 
lack of appropriate descriptions of how severe health anxiety 
presents in children and youth [93]. No specific CBT treat-
ments have been developed to treat health anxiety or IAD in 
children or youth [94••] meaning that there are no treatment 
studies yet conducted in this age group. Further, there have 
been no studies investigating third wave therapies or pharma-
cological approaches to treat health anxiety or IAD in young 
people. More research in children and adolescents is needed, 
particularly early intervention studies given the chronic and 
life-long nature of health anxiety when left untreated.

Conclusions

This review highlights the recent literature on Illness Anxi-
ety Disorder (health anxiety) and identifies current gaps and 
points for future directions. First, the long-lasting impact 
of  health  anxiety  on  the  individual  and  society  is  well- 
documented in the literature. Individuals with health anxi-
ety are debilitated by dysfunctional health beliefs, which, in 
turn, manifest into maladaptive coping behaviours. There 
are reliable dimensional measures of health anxiety and 
diagnostic instruments to assess IAD. CBT is an effective 
treatment option for this population, in both face-to-face and 
digital formats. However, further research is needed into 
third-wave treatments (i.e., MCBT and ACT) and pharma-
cotherapy in samples with IAD.

Second, there is some evidence of a relationship between 
illness experiences, intergenerational transmission of health 
anxiety, and childhood traumatic experiences as risk factors 
for health anxiety. However, it is unclear whether these fac-
tors cause health anxiety.

Third, although the limitations of DSM-IV Hypochondria-
sis were addressed in the DSM-5 with two new disorders, 
a debate continues about whether the two disorders should 

be combined or remain distinct. Early evidence suggests that 
differences between IAD and SSD are a matter of severity 
rather than of any distinctive qualitative characteristics, but 
replication research is needed across varying populations and 
groups. It is also debated whether IAD should be reclassified 
into the anxiety disorders category in the next iteration of the 
DSM, due to its shared characteristics and high comorbidity 
with other anxiety disorders. Future research should exam-
ine the predictive validity of IAD with and without comorbid 
anxiety in terms of course and treatment response. In addition, 
there has been little done to investigate the ‘care-seeking’ and 
‘care-avoidant’ subtypes of IAD. Future research is necessary 
to advance knowledge of this condition, particularly if there 
are differences between these groups in terms of their nature 
and experience, and response to treatment.

Finally, recent evidence suggests health anxiety may start, 
at least for some, in childhood and adolescence. However, 
due to a lack of developmentally appropriate diagnostic cri-
teria for young people, there is a need to investigate how 
health anxiety presents in children and young people and an 
urgent need to develop or adapt treatment options that are 
appropriate for this population.

Overall, the most significant gap in this field is the limited 
number of studies utilising the current diagnostic criteria 
for Illness Anxiety Disorder. Addressing this gap is crucial 
if we are to significantly advance knowledge, improve our 
understanding of the disorder, intervene early, and develop 
targeted, effective treatments for the disorder.
