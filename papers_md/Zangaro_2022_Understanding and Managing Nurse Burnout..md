# Zangaro_2022_Understanding and Managing Nurse Burnout.

Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with 

free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-

19. The COVID-19 resource centre is hosted on Elsevier Connect, the 

company's public news and information website. 

Elsevier hereby grants permission to make all its COVID-19-related 

research that is available on the COVID-19 resource centre - including this 

research content - immediately available in PubMed Central and other 

publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights 

for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means 

with acknowledgement of the original source. These permissions are 

granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre 

remains active.
