Abstract

Background and aim

Head and neck cancer patients are vulnerable to various psychological complications due to
the effects of both cancer itself and cancer treatment on patients’ appearance and physical
well-being. Nevertheless, few data have been obtained on effective psychosocial interven-
tions that could protect this group of cancer patients’ psychological well-being. Therefore,
this three-armed, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) aims to evalu-
ate and compare the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindful-
ness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on positive psychology (such as posttraumatic growth
[PTG], hope, and optimism), quality of life (QoL), and psychological complications (depres-
sion, anxiety, and experiential avoidance) among newly diagnosed head and neck cancer
patients.

Methods and analysis

This RCT will target newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients who have been treated
only with surgery or who have not yet received any treatment. In total, 120 patients who
meet all of the study’s inclusion criteria and none of its exclusion criteria will be randomly
assigned into three groups—an ACT group, an MBSR group, and a treatment-as-usual con-
trol group—at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Participants in the two intervention groups (the ACT
and MBSR groups) will undergo an eight-week group intervention program. During this pro-
gram, each intervention will comprise eight modules based on ACT and MBSR, respec-
tively. Outcome assessments will be performed across a three-point timeline, including

Introduction
Head and neck cancer and its associated psychological issues

Head and neck cancer is a group of biologically similar cancers that affect the oral cavity, lips,
nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, and larynx. It affects 550,000 people worldwide annu-
ally, leading to 300,000 deaths each year [1]. In Malaysia, 9,419 head and neck cancer cases
were reported between 2007 and 2011, accounting for 9.1% of all cancer diagnoses [2]. There-
fore, head and neck cancer is the country’s fourth-most-prevalent cancer [2]. Head and neck
cancer leads to high incidence of various psychosocial issues among cancer survivors, such as
depression, suicide, interpersonal relationship conflict, facial disfigurement, damage to self-
image, social isolation, and continued substance dependence and abuse [3]. These psychoso-
cial issues may lead to negative consequences in head and neck cancer survivors. For example
facial disfigurement can increase depression and reduce quality of life (QoL) among head and
neck cancer patients [4].

Some studies have found that head and neck cancer is associated with the highest docu-
mented rates of depression and anxiety compared with other cancer types [5]. Depression and
anxiety could reduce head and neck cancer patients’ QoL [6]. A 2003 article by Spiegel and
Giese-Davis pointed out that depression may predict cancer’s progression and mortality
through a bidirectional relationship between depression and cancer; depression and cancer
can negatively affect each other [7]. Consequently, depression and anxiety among head and
neck cancer patients should be adequately treated.

Experiential avoidance (EA) has been broadly defined as attempts to avoid thoughts, feel-
ings, memories, physical sensations, and other internal experiences—even when such avoid-
ance causes long-term harm [8]. Currently, negative thoughts, emotions, and sensations are
believed not to contribute to psychiatric illnesses; however, a habitual and persistent unwilling-
ness to experience uncomfortable thoughts and feelings (and the associated avoidance and
inhibition of these experiences) is thought to be linked to psychiatric illnesses [8, 9]. Addition-
ally, reduced EA also indirectly predicts a higher QoL among cancer patients via its effect on
depression symptoms [10]. Therefore, an intervention that successfully reduces EA is pre-
dicted to also reduce depression and anxiety symptoms.

Posttraumatic growth, hope, and optimism’s influence on quality of life. Despite the
negative psychological complications associated with head and neck cancer and its treatment,
psychology research has shifted focus in recent years, examining the positive aspects and
growth resulting from traumatic experiences of cancer and cancer patients’ QoL. Among the
positive psychological experiences which may develop in cancer patients include posttraumatic
growth, hope, and optimism. Posttraumatic growth (PTG) describes positive psychological
changes experienced as the result of a struggle due to a life-threatening crisis or event. PTG

comprises five components, and an individual who has experienced more PTG will better
appreciate life and have better interpersonal relationships, more personal strength, higher lev-
els of spiritual development, and/or experience more possibilities in life compared with before
development of PTG [11]. PTG results in positive psychological changes beyond pre-trauma
levels [11]. It has been shown to be present among head and neck cancer patients [12, 13].
PTG is important and should be emphasized as a positive psychological characteristic among
cancer patients because it inversely correlates with depression and psychological distress [14,
15]. It also positively correlates with health-related QoL [15, 16]. However, it should be noted
that not all patients with trauma related to living with cancer could trigger the development of
PTG. If the traumatic experience of living with cancer is too intense, it may lead to failure for
cognitive reprocessing of the traumatic event to search for meaning, which will hamper the
development of PTG [17]. Hence, it is pivotal to investigate psychosocial intervention which
effectively facilitate the development of PTG.

Hope is a positive, goal-directed motivational state and a dispositional trait that enables a
tendency to adopt a positive outlook on life [18]. It comprises two components: agency, which
is the perceived motivation to pursue and achieve goals, and pathway, which is the perceived
ability to generate approaches to achieving goals [18]. Hope is associated with several positive
outcomes for cancer patients. For instance, hope is negatively associated with depression, anxi-
ety, and psychological distress among cancer patients [19–22]. Higher levels of hope are associ-
ated with better QoL and spiritual well-being for cancer patients, and it is the most significant
factor associated with greater posttraumatic growth among cancer patients compared with
other positive psychology elements [23–25].

Similarly, optimism is the stable and consistent belief that good things—rather than bad
things—will happen in life [26]. Optimism has been shown to positively correlate with psycho-
logical well-being and inversely correlate with depression and psychological distress [27]. It is
also positively associated with health-related QoL among cancer patients [27–29]. In of head
and neck cancer patients’ context, optimism predicts better one-year survival rates indepen-
dently from confounding demographic and clinical factors [30]. QoL is an important measure
and health indicator in the field of psycho-oncology for assessments and treatment outcomes
[31]. Since head and neck cancer is associated with a wide range of illness complications and
adverse treatment effects that can reduce QoL [32–34], psychosocial interventions that could
enhance head and neck cancer patients’ QoL must be investigated.

Acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction. We
have identified two psychosocial interventions that could enhance cancer’s positive psycholog-
ical sequelae and reduce its negative psychological sequelae: acceptance and commitment ther-
apy (ACT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). ACT is a third-generation
cognitive behavioral approach that uses acceptance and mindfulness processes, as well as com-
mitment and behavioral change processes, to generate psychological flexibility [9]. Psychologi-
cal flexibility is the ability to act on the long-term chosen values in life and accept undesired
thoughts, feelings and short-term impulses stemming from distressing life events. Hence, psy-
chological flexibility allows one to control EA, which may be utilized to cope with distressing
life events [35].

ACT is useful for cancer patients because it can help them handle the negative emotions
resulting from cancer (such as uncertainty, anxiety, sadness, and anger), rather than avoiding
these emotions [36, 37]. A meta-analysis of 25 treatment-control comparison studies with a
total sample size of 2,256 cancer patients found that ACT greatly affected psychological dis-
tress, particularly reducing depression and anxiety symptoms among cancer patients [38].
ACT also greatly increased QoL and hope among cancer patients [38]. Although that study’s
sample size may be too small to fully justify ACT’s significant effect on hope, ACT’s main

principles that help cancer patients clarify their values and commit to actions are believed to
improve their hope [38]. Moreover, an RCT of 410 colorectal cancer survivors reported that
ACT significantly increased PTG at six-month and 12-month periods of a telephone-based
health coaching intervention using ACT strategies [39]. However, to date, ACT’s effect on
PTG, hope, optimism, acceptance, depression, anxiety, and QoL among head and neck cancer
patients has not been investigated.

MBSR is an eight-week, standardized group intervention comprising mindfulness medita-
tion and gentle yoga designed to address stress, pain, and illness [40]. Cancer patients’ partici-
pation in MBSR has been shown to have increase in spirituality, PTG, self-compassion, and
positive states of mind [41–47]. Studies have emphasized that MBSR increases PTG among
participating cancer patients immediately after an eight-week intervention [44, 47, 48]. A
meta-analysis of 29 studies with a total of 3,476 cancer survivors evaluated mindfulness-based
interventions’ efficacy in facilitating mental well-being, revealing that MBSR significantly
reduced depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue while enhancing PTG, QoL, and mindfulness
among cancer patients [49]. Moreover, MBSR has been reported to lower psychological dis-
tress and improve total, social, and emotional QoL among head and neck cancer patients [50].
To date, however, MBSR’s effect on cancer patients’ hope has not been investigated. Therefore,
an investigation of MBSR’s effects on PTG, hope, optimism, depression, anxiety, and QoL
among head and neck cancer patients would be interesting. Moreover, a comparison of
MBSR’s efficacy compared to ACT would be valuable.

Rationale. Head and neck cancer differs from other cancer types due to various psychoso-

cial issues associated with it [3, 4]. Moreover, the devastating complications of both cancer
itself and cancer treatments’ side effects—such as fatigue, pain, speech and swallowing prob-
lems, breathing problems, mucositis, xerostomia, and trismus—further disrupt many func-
tions and daily living activities, increasing psychological distress and decreasing QoL [32, 33].
Therefore, an investigation of the psychosocial interventions that could enhance PTG, hope,
optimism, and QoL among head and neck cancer patients is crucial. Reducing these patients’
internalized stigma and EA could also ultimately restore these cancer survivors’ mental and
physical well-being. ACT and MBSR have been reported to enhance positive psychology and
alleviate psychological distress among cancer patients [38, 49]. However, data regarding ACT
and MBSR’s effects on positive psychology, psychological sequelae and QoL in head and neck
cancer patients are lacking. ACT’s effects on PTG, hope, optimism, QoL, depression, anxiety,
and EA among head and neck cancer patients have not been studied. Although MBSR has
been reported to lower psychological distress and enhance QoL in head and neck cancer
patients, its effects on positive psychology and EA have not been investigated. Hence, MBSR
may act as a good comparator intervention to ACT for evaluating its efficacy on positive psy-
chology, psychological sequelae and QoL among head and neck cancer patients. Therefore, we
have proposed a three-armed RCT to evaluate these effects over time compared to a control
group receiving treatment-as-usual.

day-to-day basis, audit trial conduct, and prepare reports for submission to the Human
Research Ethics Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia. The trial’s data monitoring and
auditing will be conducted by the AMDI’s clinical trial coordination unit at the Universiti
Sains Malaysia—independently from the trial’s funder.

All participants will be permitted to withdraw from the study at any time without specifying
the reason for their withdrawal, and we will not use any of the information collected from par-
ticipants who choose to withdraw. Prior to their participation in this study, participants will be
informed that the results of this study will only be used for research purposes and will not be
recorded in patients’ case files. Participants’ personally identifiable information will not be
sought or recorded, and participants’ anonymity will be assured. Each participant will be
sequentially assigned a research number (e.g., RCT001, RCT002, etc.). All documents involved
in this study’s assessment of research subjects—including participants’ personal information
(socio-demographic, substance history, symptomatology, and questionnaire responses)—will
be stored in document files and locked in a cabinet whose key is kept by the corresponding
author.

Participants may also withdraw from the study if an adverse event occurs. An adverse event

(AE) is any untoward medical occurrence involving a participant in a trial intervention that
does not necessarily causally relate to this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable or unin-
tended sign, symptom, or disease that is temporarily associated with the use of an investiga-
tional intervention, whether related or unrelated to the investigational intervention.
Participants will be issued a study card featuring the research team’s contact details and
encouraged to maintain close contact by phone and report any AE. If an AE occurs, the event
will be reported in the “Adverse Event” section of the study’s case report form (CRF), and a
serious adverse event report will be filled out if necessary (S1 Fig). Such reports would include
the AE’s name, date of onset and date of recovery, severity, relationship to the studied inter-
vention, measures undertaken regarding the studied intervention, treatment, and outcome
(whether resolved or ongoing). All serious AEs will be reported to the Human Research Ethics
Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia. AE-related criteria that would exclude participants
from the study are:

1. The presence of adverse reactions unrelated to the study that cause subjects to feel uncom-

fortable continuing this study

2. The presence of adverse reactions that may be related to the study, such as an unusual ill-

ness that started after a studied intervention

3. Unusual changes in participants’ behavior, temperament, routine, suicidal tendency, or

psychotic symptoms that began after a studied intervention

4. Any suspected or unexpected adverse events inconsistent with the generally accepted
administration of the ACT and MBSR; in general, psychotherapy patients should not
exhibit any side effects or health-detrimental effects

If an unexpectedly serious AE is reported in a subject or more in any of the randomized
intervention group (ACT or MBSR), an interim analysis will be conducted to investigate this
matter. If the findings of this investigation indicate any safety concerns which is related to the
intervention administered (ACT or MBSR), the Trial Monitoring Committee will terminate
the trial prematurely. Serious AE which are indication for premature termination of trial
include suicidal tendency, life-threatening self-harm, and hospitalization related to psychologi-
cal adverse events arise from the intervention administered.

All of this study’s investigators declare no financial or other competing interests in conduct-

ing this study.

Participants

This study’s participants will be recruited from the source population. This population
includes all newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients who have been treated only with
surgery or who have not yet received treatment and who are registered under the oncology
and otorhinolaryngology unit of the Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (AMDI) at the
Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) or the oncology and otorhinolaryngology unit of Universiti
Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). The study’s sample size was determined
based on G-Power 3.1.9.2 for analysis of variance (ANOVA). This sample size was calculated
based on continuous responses to the posttraumatic growth inventory used in the study by
Labelle et al. (2015) [48] with a medium effect size (0.15) and a two-tailed alpha of 0.05. The
results of this calculation indicated that the current study requires a total sample of 93 for
three equal-sized groups to achieve a power of 0.8. Anticipating a drop-out rate of 30%, we
estimated a total sample size of 120 respondents and 40 respondents for each group.

Inclusion criteria

The study’s inclusion criteria will include: (1) patients who have been newly diagnosed with
head and neck cancer (within the previous month), whose diagnosis has been confirmed by a
histopathological examination report, who have been treated only with surgery or have yet to
received treatment, and who are at any cancer stage except metastasis to the central nervous
system; (2) patients aged 18 years and older; (3) patients who have undergone surgery and
plan to receive the standard regime of radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (4) patients who have
developed depression and anxiety symptoms after their head and neck cancer diagnosis with a
“Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale” (HADS) depression subscale score of � 8 and an
anxiety subscale score of � 8; and (5) patients who are able to read and understand written
Malay.

Exclusion criteria

Patients will be excluded if they: (1) have a history of pre-existing psychiatric illness; (2) have a
history of illicit drug use, substance use disorder, alcohol use disorder, substance-related disor-
der, or alcohol-related disorder (patients will be screened via urine dipstick for drugs and the
“Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview” to exclude these conditions); (3) have a his-
tory of medical illness that can induce psychiatric symptoms; (4) currently receive any psycho-
therapy or counseling; (5) are physically unfit for this study’s interventions (for example those
who are bed-bound or too weak to engage in the study interventions); (6) exhibit cognitive
impairment (patients will be screened via the “Mini Mental State Examination” and patients
who receive a score of < 24/30 will be excluded); (7) have received any pharmacotherapy for
anxiety and depression symptoms developed after their cancer diagnosis; and (8) are pregnant.

Recruitment process

This study will use a consecutive sampling method. The research team will approach head and
neck cancer patients registered at the two targeted institutions and explain the study’s objec-
tives and procedures. Patients who are interested in participating in this study will be screened
for inclusion and exclusion criteria by a research team member. All eligible patients will be
invited to participate in this study. The study’s purposes and procedures will be thoroughly
explained (verbal explanation by the research assistant and a copy of the participant informa-
tion will also be distributed) to prospective participants before they are invited to participate in
this study, their anonymity will be assured, and they will be informed of their right to withdraw
from the study at any time and the data collected will be discarded. Eligible patients will be
given 48 hours to decide on their participation in the study. Then, participants will sign written
informed consent to participate in the study before they enroll in the study.

Randomization

This study will use stratified permuted block randomization, stratifying trial participants
according to their age (18 to 40 years old, 41 to 60 years old, and over 60 years old) and gender
(male and female). Participants will be randomized into three groups: an ACT group, an
MBSR group, and a control group of patients on treatment-as-usual for intervention. Using a
1:1:1 allocation ratio and block randomization, we will randomly assign participants to the
three groups. An allocation sequence will be generated via computer-generated random num-
bers, which will be obtained by a research assistant who is not otherwise involved in this study.
The allocation sequence will be concealed in an opaque, sequentially numbered envelope.

Interventions

An eight-week psychosocial intervention will be administered to participants in each interven-
tion group (MBSR and ACT) while participants in the control group will receive treatment-as-
usual. The study’s outcomes will be assessed at three times: pre-intervention (t0), immediately
after the eight-week intervention (t1), and 24 weeks after the intervention (t2).

Both the ACT and MBSR interventions will comprise eight sessions delivered at a rate of
one session per week. Each session will last for one hour. At AMDI, USM, and UKMMC, che-
motherapy for head and neck cancer lasts for 8 weeks, delivered at a rate of one session per
week. Similarly, radiotherapy for head and neck cancer lasts for eight weeks at these institu-
tions. Therefore, this study’s ACT and MBSR sessions will align with participants’ chemother-
apy or radiotherapy sessions to ensure that all participants attend their intervention sessions.
ACT and MBSR will be provided in group settings with intervention groups of 10 participants
each.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). ACT utilize two main approaches to facili-
tate the development of psychological flexibility, such as mindfulness and acceptance as well as
commitment and behavioral change. ACT session begin with building of therapeutic rapport
and formulation of the case. Brief mindfulness exercise and home assignment review are also
introduced at the initial stage. The remaining sessions of ACT will then focus on the use of
pre-plan learning materials and exercises to facilitate didactic and experiential learning.
Hence, each subsequent sessions will work on addressing the specific themes introduced by
Hayes et al. (2009), such as EA, cognitive fusion, self as context, defining valued directions in
life, and the commitment to action strategies to pursue their valued directions in life [9].
Home assignments in the form of behavioral practices and experiments are provided at the
end of each session. The workbook provided to the respondent is based on the book “Get out
of your mind and into your life” written by Hayes et al (2005) [51] and “ACT made simple”

written by Harris (2009) [52]. The details of all the ACT sessions are described in S1
Appendix.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). MBSR will be conducted as group sessions,

with each session lasts for 2.5 hours, once a week for 8 weeks with another 45 minutes of home
practice on daily basis. The MBSR sessions will be based on therapy format developed by Kabat-
Zinn [40]. All the sessions focus on mindfulness practices, sharing of experiences with others, and
didactic teaching on stress. Mindfulness practices which will be discussed include body scan exer-
cise, and mindful breathing meditation techniques, three-minute breathing exercises, five-minute
seeing or hearing exercises, bodily mindfulness in movement and mindful stretching, yoga and
sitting meditation. The therapists will review feedbacks for each session, acknowledge the
thoughts, feelings, and senses, examine how participants practice mindfulness, and give assign-
ments to encourage participants to continually practice mindfulness at home. Each participant
will receive a CD detailing on meditation practices and a workbook on the mindfulness practices.
The details of all the MBSR sessions are described in S1 Appendix.

Treatment-as-usual control group. The participants in the control group will receive
treatment-as-usual in which non-specific ingredients of the psychotherapeutic approach will
be administered, such as psychological understanding to the management of an individual
patient, identifying current problems, providing opportunities for disclosure, reassurance, and
deep breathing exercise. They will be given equal amount of time and attention from the pro-
fessional figure compared to the intervention groups, whereby they will also attach to an 8-ses-
sion program (with one session per week for 8 weeks).

Treatment fidelity

ACT will be conducted for the ACT intervention group by a therapist trained in ACT, who
will have a trained backup therapist on standby to replace the primary therapist when neces-
sary. Similarly, MBSR will be conducted for the MBSR group by a therapist trained in MBSR,
and a trained backup therapist will be on standby to replace the primary therapist when neces-
sary. All the study’s therapists and backup therapists will be postgraduate students in psychol-
ogy who are not otherwise involved in the study. All the therapists have two-year experience of
conducting psychotherapy. They will also receive training manual detailing the psychotherapy
sessions for both ACT and MBSR, and they will also undergo 2 full days of brief training work-
shop for ACT and MBSR from the principal investigator. As for monitoring of treatment
integrity, a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist, both trained in ACT and MBSR will mea-
sure the delivery of the interventions by all the therapists in the ACT and MBSR groups inde-
pendently. 15% of audio-recording of the psychotherapy sessions will be randomly selected
and stratified according to therapist and the phase of intervention (early, middle or end) and
then, treatment integrity assessments will be performed by using: (1) the Drexel University
CT/ACT Therapist Adherence and Competence Rating Scale (DUACRS) [53] for ACT ses-
sions and (2) the Mindfulness-Based Interventions: Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI:TAC)
[54]. Each treatment integrity assessor will assess half of the selected sessions. Finally, the inter-
rater reliability of the two treatment integrity assessors is computed to assess the treatment
integrity of all the therapists in delivering the interventions [55]. In addition, the principal
investigator will discuss issues regarding the delivery of the interventions with the therapist
who is inconsistent in conducting the ACT and MBSR sessions.

an opaque, sequentially numbered envelope. Therefore, participants will not know which
group they are allocated to. In addition, the intervention groups (ACT and MBSR) as well as
the treatment-as-usual control group will receive an 8-session program (with one session per
week for 8 weeks) and participants in the treatment-as-usual group will also receive equal
amount of attention and time from the professional figure who administer the program.
The researchers will also be “blinded” for the study since the participants’ randomized
assignment into the designated groups will be conducted by a research assistant who is not
otherwise involved in the study or data analysis. This project’s data collection will also be con-
ducted by that research assistant who is not otherwise involved in the study or data analysis
and who is unaware of the study’s hypotheses. Moreover, the project’s data analysis will be
conducted by statisticians who are not otherwise involved in the study. A statistical analysis
plan is established prior to the final unblinded of the data lock.

Measures

Fig 1 is a flowchart summarizing this study’s procedures and outcome measures. The sched-
uled assessment of the study’s outcome measures is illustrated in Table 1. Data collection will
be conducted every weekday during working hours, and flyers announcing the study and the
benefits of participating in this study will be disseminated to all newly diagnosed head and
neck cancer patients at the study’s focal institutions (within one month of their diagnosis) in
order to ensure adequate subject enrolment to achieve the calculated sample size. This clinical
trial protocol was written according to the “Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for
Intervention Trials 2013.”

Sociodemographic and tumor characteristics. The sociodemographic characteristics
which will be recorded from each participant include age, gender, ethnicity, marital status,
education, and employment status. While the tumor characteristics which will be gathered
from the participants are duration of cancer diagnosis, types of head and neck cancer, stage of
cancer and modalities of cancer treatment received.

Primary outcome. Posttraumatic growth. The Malay version of the “Posttraumatic
Growth Inventory–Short Form” (PTGI-SF) will be used to measure degrees of posttraumatic
growth among participants. The PTGI-SF is a shorter version of the original PTGI, and it com-
prises 10 items, two of which measure each of the five PTG factors. The higher an individual’s
PTGI-SF score, the more posttraumatic growth they have achieved. The PTGI can be substi-
tuted by the PTGI-SF with little loss of information [56]. The Malay version of the PTGI-SF
was validated among the Malaysian cancer patient population, and it has good internal consis-
tency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.887 and a Cronbach’s alpha of the five PTG factors ranging
from 0.700 to 0.813 [57].

Secondary outcomes. Quality of life. The Malay version of “Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy–Head & Neck” (FACT–H & N) will be used to assess quality of life among
participants. FACT-H & N is a self-reported tool comprising 39 items and five subscales: physi-
cal well-being (seven items), social/family well-being (seven items), emotional well-being (six
items), functional well-being (seven items), and head & neck cancer additional concerns (12
items). Each item is scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very
much). The higher an individual’s FACT–H & N score, the greater their QoL. The tool has also
registered excellent psychometric properties [58]. FACT–H & N has been translated and vali-
dated among the Malaysian cancer patient population. All of its subscales have moderate to
good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.65 to 0.87 [59].

Hope. The Malay version of the “Dispositional Hope Scale” will be used to measure partici-

pants’ degrees of hope. The “Dispositional Hope Scale” is a self-rated, 12-item scale that

assesses respondents’ hope levels. It comprises two domains: agency and pathway. Four of the
scale’s 12 items assess agency, while another four items assess pathways. The four other items
are fillers. Each item is scored using a Likert scale ranging from definitely false to definitely true
[60]. The Malay version of the Scale was validated among the Malaysian cancer patient popula-
tion, and it has good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.716 [61].

Optimism. The Malay version of the “Life Orientation Test–Revised (LOT-R)” will be used
to evaluate degrees of optimism among participants. The LOT-R is a self-rated tool comprising
six items in two domains, optimism and pessimism. Each domain is made up of three items.
The tool has good internal consistency and has been found to be stable over time [26]. The
Malay version of the LOT-R was validated among the Malaysian cancer patient population,
and it has acceptable internal consistency [62].

Experiential avoidance. The Malay version of the “Acceptance and Action Questionnaire”

(AAQ-II) will be used to measure degrees of experiential avoidance or psychological

inflexibility among participants. The AAQ-II is the questionnaire’s second version, revised
from the original version, and it is shorter (seven items) while offering better psychometric
consistency. Participants’ AAQ-II scores will be calculated by summing up the questionnaire’s
seven items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of psychological inflexibility [63]. Validation
of the Malay version of the AAQ-II has indicated that the tool has excellent internal consis-
tency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.91, and it has been found to be a unidimensional scale that
measures psychological inflexibility/EA [64].

Depression and anxiety. The Malay version of the “Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale”
(HADS) will be used to assess the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms among partici-
pants. The HADS is a 14-item, self-rated questionnaire with seven items in each of its sub-
scales. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, and the total score for both the depression and anxiety
subscales ranges from 0 to 21 per subscale [65]. The cut-off for depression cases is 8/21, and
the cut-off for anxiety cases is also 8/21 [66]. The Malay version of the HADS has been vali-
dated among Malaysian breast cancer patients, and it exhibited acceptable to good internal
consistency for its total score and subscales with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.73 to 0.87
[67].

Other measures. The participants compliance to the interventions will be recorded as
they will be requested to fill in electronic dairies regarding their performance of the home
assignments and practice of the interventions at home. The reasons for absence from therapy
sessions, dropouts and loss to follow up (such as loss of interest to participate, dislike of the
intervention, not feeling well or death) will also be recorded.

Data analysis

All of this study’s data analysis will be conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sci-
ences, version 26 (SPSS 26; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Initially, the baseline

PLOS ONEAcceptance and commitment therapy versus mindfulness-based stress reduction in head and neck cancer

sociodemographic and tumor characteristics will be presented by randomized groups (ACT,
MBSR, and control groups).

The mean difference in the primary outcome (total PTGI-SF score) for the three random-

ized groups (ACT, MBSR, and control groups) at each specific time point (pre-intervention
[t0], post-treatment at 8 weeks [t1] and 24 weeks after intervention [t2]) will be assessed using
one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by false discovery rate adjustment. For the
main pool analysis, mixed linear model will be employed for comparing the primary outcome
(total PTGI-SF score) between ACT and control groups and between MBSR and control
groups across the three time points (t0, t1 and t2), while controlling for stratification factors
such as age and gender. The main effects of intervention in the groups and time points will be
presented as estimated marginal mean and standard error of mean. The study’s primary analy-
sis will follow the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The data analysis for the study’s secondary
outcomes (quality of life, hope, optimism, depression, anxiety, and EA) will be conducted sim-
ilarly to the primary outcomes’ calculation. In addition, 95% confidence interval will also be
presented alongside the main effect. Statistical significance will be two-tailed and set to
p < 0.05.

To handle any missing data, if the missing data represent less than 5% of the study’s total
collected data, they will be ignored. If the missing data represent more than 5% but less than
40% of the total collected and are assumed to be randomly missing, then multiple imputation
(restricted maximum likelihood estimation) will be performed using Stata 15. However, if the
missing data represent more than 40% of the total collected data or are assumed to be missing
either not randomly or completely randomly, then only the collected data will be used for the
study’s analysis, and the missing data will be explained as a research limitation in any publica-
tions of the study’s findings [68].

Discussion

This study will primarily investigate the efficacy of two psychosocial interventions (ACT and
MBSR) in enhancing positive psychology elements (such as PTG). Secondarily, it will evaluate
these interventions’ efficacy in reducing psychological complications (such as depression, anx-
iety, and EA), enhancing other positive psychology elements (such as hope and optimism),
and increasing vital outcome (such as quality of life) among newly diagnosed head and neck
cancer patients. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first to investigate and
compare ACT’s and MBSR’s effects in improving psychological well-being among head and
neck cancer patients.

This study emphasize on investigating how ACT and MBSR affect changes in posttraumatic
growth as the primary outcome as posttraumatic growth represents a unique transitional pro-
cess characterized by several positive psychological outcomes (such as better appreciation of
life, positive relationship with others, higher spiritual development, greater personal strength,
and enhanced new possibilities in life) beyond the level of attainment prior to the traumatic
event of living with cancer and contribute to psychological and physical well-being of cancer
survivors [69]. In essence, posttraumatic growth is associated with enhancement of quality of
life among cancer survivors.

This study will provide comprehensive scientific evidence to guide treating clinicians’ effi-

cacious psychosocial interventions in order to enhance positive psychology elements and
diminish psychological complications, safeguarding head and neck cancer patients’ mental
well-being. If MBSR and ACT effectively facilitate mental well-being among head and neck
cancer patients, then these psychosocial interventions should be included in the treatment
regime for this patient group. This study will also contribute to future research since its

methodology can be replicated to investigate ACT’s and MBSR’s effects on psychological com-
plications and other positive psychology elements among patients with other cancer types.

Since this study will only utilize a maximum of four therapists to conduct the intervention
sessions, this may limit the generalizability of the study findings. Hence, it is of utmost impor-
tance to train up more therapists for future randomized clinical trials which investigate efficacy
of ACT and to deliver this intervention to cancer patients in oncology settings. The first step in
training for therapists is to set up ACT workshop which will allow ACT trainee to experience
the metaphors and exercises used in ACT on a personal context and as a receiver of ACT. This
step of organizing ACT workshop for trainee therapists serve several benefits and advantages.
Participants in ACT workshop exhibited not only increase in knowledge regarding ACT, but
also develop interest for further learning and utilize ACT concepts and utilize ACT practices
in their clinical work [70]. Moreover, trainee therapists should be encouraged to join their
supervisors in regular individual or group ACT sessions in addition to their regular supervi-
sion hours. During supervision hours, trainee therapists are encouraged to conceptualize a
case based on the ACT perspective and report on the progress of the case on a weekly basis.
The core learning objectives for the trainee therapists should be based on three principles: (1)
to develop a sense of personal wholeness and able to reflect the same sense to the patients who
experience EA, (2) to be able to help patients to accept emotions and thoughts by reflecting
their own experience to the experience of the patients, and (3) to be able to guide patients to
understand the costs of EA on their personal values in life, so that patients are willing to com-
mit substantially towards actions to pursue their values in life.

In addition, since this study only recruit Malaysia head and neck cancer patients, future
RCT with larger sample size (under medium to large effect size) and patients recruited from
multiple countries is warranted to evaluate the effects of ACT and MBSR on positive psychol-
ogy (such as PTG, hope optimism), quality of life and negative outcomes (such as depression,
anxiety and EA).
