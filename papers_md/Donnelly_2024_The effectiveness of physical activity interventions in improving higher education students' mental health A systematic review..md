Abstract 
Traditional interventions aiming to improve students’ mental health and quality of life include meditation or canine therapy. 
The development of physical activity-related interventions has increased over the past decade. We aimed to review all stud-
ies using physical activity for improving the mental health and quality of life in higher education students whilst describing 
the  interventions,  measurements  and  effectiveness.  A  systematic  search  of  six  electronic  databases  including:  ProQuest, 
MEDLINE,  Embase,  CINAHL,  SPORTDiscus  and  CENTRAL,  was  conducted  following  PRISMA  guidelines.  Randomized  or 
non-randomized controlled trial physical activity-related interventions involving higher education students aiming to improve 
their  mental  health  and  quality  of  life  were  included.  Searches  yielded  58  articles  with  interventions  involving  martial  arts, 
sport, mind–body exercises and anaerobic exercises. Psychological measures varied across studies including the State Trait 
Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory and the Perceived Stress Scale. Over half of the studies included in this review 
(n = 36) were effective in improving students’ mental health or quality of life. Findings from our review suggest that interven-
tions aiming to be effective in improving students’ mental health quality of life should aim to deliver moderate-vigorous inten-
sity exercises such as dance or Pilates. This systematic review was based on a published protocol in PROSPERO (registration 
number: CRD42022325975).

BACKGROUND
The  benefits  associated  with  being  physically  active 
are  well-recognized.  Regular  participation  in  physical 
activity  (PA)  has  been  associated  with  positive  long-
term influences on obesity, cardiovascular heart disease 
and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  in  adults  (Reiner  et    al., 
2013)  and  is  also  associated  with  lower  depressive 
symptoms, anxiety and stress (UK Government, 2019). 
Interest  in  the  role  of  PA  on  mental  health  and  qual-
ity of life (QoL) has increased over the past few years 
due  to  the  Coronavirus  Disease-19  (COVID-19)  out-
break (Ozdemir et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the known 

improvements  in  outcomes  relating  to  mental  health 
(e.g. depression, anxiety, stress, etc.) and QoL (e.g. per-
sonal  health  (physical,  mental  and  spiritual),  relation-
ships, education status, work environment, social status, 
wealth, etc.) through PA have been observed for decades 
(Saxena et al., 2005; Acree et al., 2006; Bize et al., 2007; 
Farris  and  Abrantes,  2020).  To  gain  the  health  bene-
fits  associated  with  being  physically  active,  the  World 
Health Organization (WHO) provide PA guidelines for 
adults  aged  18–64  years  (World  Health  Organization, 
n.d.). These outline that adults should participate in at 
least  150–300 min  of  moderate-intensity  aerobic  PA

Contribution to Health Promotion

•  We searched academic papers to determine 
the  effectiveness  of  physical  activity  for 
improving the mental health and quality of 
life of higher education students.

•  We 

identified  various  physical  activity- 
related  interventions  which  are  effective 
in  improving  students’  mental  health  and 
quality of life.

•  We  offer  recommendations  for  the  design 
of  future  interventions  aiming  to  improve 
the  mental  health  and  quality  of  life  of 
higher education students through physical 
activity.

or  at  least  75–150 min  of  vigorous-intensity  activity 
weekly. The WHO also recommends that adults should 
also  participate  in   muscle-strengthening  activities  and 
limit sedentary time.

Higher  education  (HE)  students  are  largely  recog-
nized as inactive (Pengpid et al., 2015), with a decline 
observed  in  activity  from  high  school  into  HE  (Bray 
and  Born,  2004).  College  students  indicate  that  the 
quality of on-campus facilities, need for social support 
to encourage exercise and lack of time and motivation 
are barriers to PA (LaCaille et al., 2011).

In  HE  students,  meeting  PA  guidelines  has  been 
associated  with  improved  physical  health  and  mental 
health (Murphy et al., 2018), and less academic stress 
compared to students who are inactive (Gasiūnienė and 
Miežienė,  2021).  It  is  unsurprising  that  a  recent  sys-
tematic  review  noted  a  positive  relationship  between 
PA  and  academic  performance  in  HE  students  across 
the  USA,  France  and  China  (Wunsch  et  al.,  2021). 
Alarmingly, findings from a study in 23 low-, middle- 
and  high-income  countries  found  that  41.4%  of  uni-
versity students were physically inactive (Pengpid et al., 
2015) ranging from 21.9% in Kyrgyzstan to 80.6% in 
Pakistan. Whilst the benefits of PA for HE students are 
clear in relation to health and academic performance, 
globally these students are inactive.

HE  is  a  time  of  increased  autonomy  and  self- 
development for students, however, poor diet and PA 
behaviours  can  develop,  with  research  highlighting 
failings  of  HE  organizations  in  the  promotion  of  PA 
for their students (Keating et al., 2005). Additionally, 
many HE students face issues with their mental health 
and  QoL  ranging  from  anxiety  to  alcohol  use  disor-
ders (Castillo and Schwartz, 2013). HE institutions are 
promising settings to promote PA opportunities, as the 
target population can be easily reached, whereby inter-
ventions to improve the mental health of HE students 
can be easily administered (Martinez et al., 2016). In 

turn,  the  improvement  of  mental  health  through  par-
ticipation in PA can have positive effects on academic 
performance  (Al-Drees  et  al.,  2016).  To  attempt  to 
enhance health-related behaviours in HE students, pre-
vious studies have relied on psychological-based ther-
apies to remedy HE student’s mental health problems 
(Reiner  et  al.,  2013;  Binfet,  2017).  Findings  from  a 
systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the use 
of  cognitive  behavioural  therapies  including  mindful-
ness  programmes  for  the  treatment  of  stress,  depres-
sion and anxiety in students found a medium effect size 
for stress and anxiety, but a small effect for depression 
(González-Valero et al., 2019). Studies examining the 
effects of canine therapy on university students’ stress 
have  shown  that  spending  time  with  therapy  canines 
significantly reduces stress (Binfet, 2017; Binfet et al., 
2018). Over the past decade, there has been an increase 
in interventions employing PA or exercise to improve 
HE  student’s  mental  health  and  QoL.  Although  a 
review has been conducted examining the effectiveness 
of  interventions  targeting  PA,  nutrition  and  healthy 
weight  for  HE  students  (Plotnikoff  et  al.,  2015),  this 
current  review  is  the  first  to  investigate  the  effective-
ness of PA-related interventions in improving the QoL 
and mental health outcomes in HE students.

OBJECTIVE
The  objective  of  this  article  is  to  systematically 
review the evidence available regarding the impact of 
PA-related interventions to improve mental health and 
QoL outcomes in HE students to determine the follow-
ing research questions:

1.  Are  PA  or  exercise  interventions  effective  in 
improving  the  mental  health  and  QoL  of  HE 
students?

2.  Does effectiveness of the interventions vary accord-
ing to the length and type of the intervention?

METHODS
This  systematic  review  was  based  on  a  published 
protocol  in  PROSPERO—International  prospective 
register  of  systematic  reviews  (registration  number: 
CRD42022325975)  following  PRISMA  guidelines 
(Page et al., 2021).

Data sources
An exhaustive search was conducted within six data-
bases:  ProQuest,  MEDLINE,  Embase,  CINAHL, 
SPORTDiscus  and  CENTRAL,  only  including  peer- 
reviewed journal articles published up until May 2022. 
The search strategy was developed through a combina-
tion of keywords for each database using the Boolean 

S. Donnelly et al.operators  ‘OR’  and  ‘AND’:  (University  students  OR 
College students) AND (Physical activity OR exercise 
OR  movement  OR  physical  fitness)  AND  (Health-
related  quality  of  life  OR  Stress  OR  depression  OR 
anxiety) AND (Intervention OR Programme OR ran-
domised  controlled  trial  (RCT)  OR  non-randomised 
controlled  trial  (non-RCT)).  Only  manuscripts  writ-
ten  in  English  were  considered.  Two  reviewers  inde-
pendently  assessed  articles  for  initial  study  inclusion 
based  on  title  and  abstract.  Full  texts  were  then 
retrieved  and  assessed  based  on  their  eligibility  for 
inclusion.

Study inclusion and exclusion criteria
Type of participants
Any  study  including  on-campus  or  remote  learning 
HE  students  (≥18  years  old)  full-time  or  part-time, 
and  undergraduate  or  postgraduate  students  were 
included. Students studying vocational training courses 
or short courses (i.e. less than 6 months duration) were 
excluded.

Type of interventions
Interventions  deemed  eligible  for  inclusion  had  to 
include  a  PA  or  movement-based  component,  aim-
ing  to  improve  student’s  mental  health  and/or  QoL. 
Interventions of all lengths and mode of delivery (e.g. 
online, on-campus, etc.) were included.

Type of studies
Original quantitative studies including RCTs and non-
RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Cross-sectional stud-
ies,  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  were  not 
included.

Type of outcome
This review focuses on the psychological effects of the 
intervention received relating to the mental health and/
or QoL of HE students.

Data extraction
The search results were exported to Zotero® to elimi-
nate duplicates. Titles were screened and eligible stud-
ies  were  downloaded  onto  excel,  reviewed  for  any 
remaining duplicates missed by Zotero (S.D.) and the 
abstracts  were  manually  screened  by  two  researchers 
independently  (S.D.  and  M.K.).  If  there  was  any  dis-
crepancy, a third investigator (K.P.) was called to reach 
a  mutual  consensus  amongst  the  research  team.  The 
full texts of these articles were retrieved. Subsequently, 
the  reference  lists  of  selected  studies  were  reviewed 
(S.D.)  to  identify  additional  relevant  studies.  From 
all the eligible full-texts, data were extracted by three 
researchers (S.D., M.K., K.P.). The following summary 

3

data  were  considered:  country,  study  design,  sample 
size, gender, age (range and mean (standard deviation: 
SD)),  diagnoses,  intervention  characteristics,  analysis, 
outcomes and effectiveness of intervention.

Data analysis
Across all study designs the purpose of the study, spe-
cific population of interest (within HE students); type, 
duration,  and  follow-up  period  of  the  intervention; 
and specific mental health measures are described with 
consideration to key attributes of robustness and gen-
eralisability. The reported effectiveness of interventions 
is  described  for  RCT  and  non-RCT  studies,  with  the 
comparators  also  of  interest  for  the  RCTs. The  theo-
retical frameworks underpinning interventions are also 
described.  Due  to  the  heterogeneity  of  study  designs, 
interventions  and  outcome  measures  a  meta-analysis 
was not possible.

Risk of bias (ROB)
ROB  was  assessed,  whereby  three  reviewers  (S.D., 
M.K.,  K.P.)  reviewed  all  included  studies.  Thereafter, 
the reviewers discussed the assessment of the included 
studies to come to a final agreement of the assessment 
of  each  paper.  ROB  for  RCTs  was  assessed  using  the 
revised version 2 of the Cochrane ROB for randomized 
trials  (RoB  2)  (Sterne  et  al.,  2019).  The  ROB  of  all 
included non-RCTs was assessed using the ROBINS-I 
tool (Sterne et al., 2016). This tool provides a system-
atic way to organize and present the available evidence 
relating to ROB, and by signalling questions, answers 
can  help  identify  areas  of  concern  regarding  ROB. 
Similarly,  to  the  RoB  2  tool,  outcomes  for  each  indi-
vidual domain are generated alongside an overall ROB 
outcome.

RESULTS
Results of literature search
The  total  search  retrieved  1,632  records.  Following 
the removal of duplicates, 1,593 records were screened 
by title, of which 1,444 titles were excluded, and the 
remaining  149  abstracts  were  retrieved  and  screened. 
The  remaining  101  full-text  articles  were  screened, 
of which 58 publications from 1991 to 2023 met the 
inclusion  criteria  (see  Figure  1).  These  publications 
included 38 RCT studies (Crocker and Grozelle, 1991; 
Brown  et  al.,  1993;  Kim  et  al.,  2004;  Mailey  et  al., 
2010;  Akandere  and  Demir,  2011;  Hemat-Far  et  al.,

were from the USA followed by 11 in China, and 6 in 
Canada. Four studies were from Iran, and three stud-
ies were included from both Germany and Spain. Two 
studies came from Japan, Turkey and the Netherlands, 
and the remaining countries were associated with one 
study each; Australia, Belgium, India, Korea, Malaysia, 
Norway, Taiwan  and  the  UK  (see Table  1).  Only  one 
RCT study reported the use of behaviour change theory 
(Mailey et al., 2010), which was social cognitive theory. 
No non-RCT studies employed behaviour change the-
ory. Intervention duration ranged from 1 single 10-min 
session to 20 weeks of intervention. Seven of the RCT 
(Kim et al., 2013; Mailey et al., 2010; Philippot et al., 
2022; Sun et al., 2023; Wan Yunus et al., 2020; Zhang 
et al., 2023a; Zhu et al., 2023) and 8 of the non-RCT 
(Wang et al., 2004; deJonge et al., 2021; Martínez-Díaz 
and  Carrasco,  2021;  Forseth  et  al.,  2022;  Danielsen 
et  al.,  2023;  Gurung  et  al.,  2023;  Sandra  et  al.,  
2023;  Strehli  et  al.,  2023)  studies  were  designed  as 
pilot trials.

Incentive to participate
Only 13 (22%) studies outlined small incentives to par-
ticipate which included the award of additional course 
credits, money, prize draws (e.g. amazon voucher) and 
free yoga classes (see Table 1).

Diagnoses, psychological outcomes and measurements
Eighteen  studies  (31%)  required  participants  to  have 
a  psychological  diagnosis  or  experience  including 
being  referred  by  the  on-campus  mental  health  team, 
experiencing  anxiety,  experiencing  moderate  depres-
sion, or having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD). Other studies had inclusion criteria based on 
activity levels or previous exercise experience (n = 16, 
28%) and the remainder (n = 24, 41%) had no specific 
inclusion  criteria  other  than  being  students,  although 
recruitment  may  have  been  restricted  to  sub-groups 
of students (such as course enrolment or dormitories). 
Most  of  the  studies  (n = 48,  83%)  reported  psycho-
logical outcomes as their primary outcome, including 
perceived  stress,  depression,  state  anxiety  and  QoL. 
In  other  studies  (n = 10,  17%),   non-psychological 
measures  such  as  cardiorespiratory  fitness,  heart  rate 
variability  and  aerobic  capacity  were  reported  as 
their  primary  outcome,  with  psychological  outcomes 
being  secondary  outcomes.  Various  psychological 
measurements  were  used  (see  Table  2)  including  the 
Spielberger  State-Trait  Anxiety  Inventory  (STAI)  and 
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

Intervention effectiveness
Interventions  were  effective  in  36  studies  (62%)  for 
improving  at  least  one  measure  of  mental  health  or 
QOL in HE students (Akandere and Demir, 2011; Bass 

et al., 2002; Caldwell et al., 2009; Crocker and Grozelle, 
1991; Danielsen et al., 2023; de Vries et al., 2016, 2018; 
deJonge  et  al.,  2021;  Dinani  et  al.,  2019;  Ezati  et  al., 
2020;  Faro  et  al.,  2019;  Forseth  et  al.,  2022;  Fukui 
et al., 2021; Gallego et al., 2014; Gurung et al., 2023; 
Hemat-Far  et  al.,  2012;  Herbert  et  al.,  2020;  Huang 
et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2013; Li et al., 
2022; López-Rodríguez et al., 2017; Muir et al., 2020; 
Philippot et al., 2022; Salehian et al., 2021; Saltan and 
Ankaralı, 2021; Sandra et al., 2023; Strehli et al., 2023; 
Sun et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2021; von Haaren  et al., 
2016; Wan Yunus et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2004; Xiao 
et al., 2021; Zhang and Jiang, 2023b; Zhao et al., 2022). 
Five of these studies did not have a comparator so the 
effectiveness  relates  only  to  changes  over  time  (pre-
post)  and  not  between  groups. Where  an  intervention 
was found to be effective the effect sizes were typically 
medium  to  large,  in  either  an  adjusted  repeated  meas-
ures analysis or a less robust sequence of paired t-tests. 
No studies which used sequences of t-tests adjusted for 
multiple  comparisons.  The  effect  sizes  as  reported  by 
the authors or estimated from available information are 
outlined  in  (Supplementary  File  S1:  SF1).  Nearly  half 
the studies (48%) compared a PA intervention with the 
‘usual routine’ (including waitlist control groups). The 
remaining studies used a variety of comparators includ-
ing  between  different  PA  interventions  (e.g.  basketball 
with Taichi) and non-PA interventions such as art, ther-
apy and expressive writing (Table 1). For the purposes 
of this review, we have categorized these interventions 
based  on  the  intervention  and  not  the  comparator. 
These are: (a)  moderate-vigorous intensity PA (MVIPA) 
intervention, (b) high-intensity interval training (HIIT), 
(c)  mind–body  PA  interventions  and  (d)  miscellaneous 
interventions.

MVIPA interventions.
There were 29 studies which used MVIPA interventions 
including  aerobic  strength  and  resistance  exercises, 
Pilates, running, dance, circuit/gym training and sports 
games. Of these studies, 25 were found to be effective 
(Crocker and Grozelle, 1991; Bass et al., 2002; Caldwell 
et  al.,  2009;  Akandere  and  Demir,  2011;  Hemat-Far 
et  al., 2012; Gallego et al., 2014; de Vries et al., 2016, 
2018;  von  Haaren  et  al.,  2016;  Huang  et    al.,  2017; 
López-Rodríguez et al., 2017; Faro et al., 2019; Ezati 
et  al.,  2020;  Herbert  et  al.,  2020;  Muir  et  al.,  2020; 
Wan Yunus  et  al.,  2020;  deJonge  et  al.,  2021;  Fukui 
et  al.,  2021;  Saltan  and  Ankaralı,  2021;  Xiao  et  al., 
2021; Ji et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022; Danielsen et al., 
2023; Gurung et al., 2023; Sandra et al., 2023). Four 
studies  did  not  find  significant  intervention  effects. 
Two of these studies compared an aerobic intervention 
with  a  yoga  intervention  (Tong  et  al.,  2021;  Murray 
et al., 2022); 1 study compared a home workout with

expressive writing (Marschin and Herbert, 2021); and 
1  study  used  cycling/running  interventions  (Brown 
et  al., 1993). Notably the cycling/running intervention 
did  not  include  general  student  populations,  rather  it 
recruited physically challenged students, enrolled in an 
adaptive  physical  education  class  for  a  single  20-min 
session.

Nineteen of the 29 studies in this group were RCTs 
(Crocker  and  Grozelle,  1991;  Brown  et  al.,  1993; 
Akandere  and  Demir,  2011;  Hemat-Far  et  al.,  2012; 
Gallego  et  al.,  2014;  de  Vries  et  al.,  2016,  2018; 
von  Haaren  et  al.,  2016;  Huang  et  al.,  2017;  López-
Rodríguez et al., 2017; Faro et al., 2019; Herbert et al., 
2020; Wan Yunus et al., 2020; Fukui et al., 2021; Saltan 
and Ankaralı, 2021; Xiao et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2022; 
Murray  et  al.,  2022,  2022;  Zhao  et  al.,  2022)  and 
17  were  found  to  be  effective  (Crocker  and  Grozelle, 
1991;  Akandere  and  Demir,  2011;  Hemat-Far  et  al., 
2012; Gallego et al., 2014; de Vries et al., 2016, 2018; 
von  Haaren  et  al.,  2016;  Huang  et  al.,  2017;  López-
Rodríguez et al., 2017; Faro et al., 2019; Herbert et  al., 
2020; Wan Yunus et al., 2020; Fukui et al., 2021; Saltan 
and Ankaralı, 2021; Xiao et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2022; 
Zhao  et  al.,  2022).  One  was  explicitly  a  pilot  study 
(Wan  Yunus  et  al.,  2020).  There  were  10  non-RCTs 
(Bass  et  al.,  2002;  Caldwell  et  al.,  2009;  Ezati  et  al., 
2020; Muir et al., 2020; deJonge et al., 2021; Marschin 
and Herbert, 2021; Tong et al., 2021; Danielsen et al., 
2023; Gurung et al., 2023; Sandra et  al., 2023), 4 of 
which  were  pilots  (deJonge  et    al.,  2021;  Danielsen 
et al., 2023; Gurung et al., 2023; Sandra et  al., 2023), 8 
were found to be effective (Bass et al., 2002; Caldwell et 
al., 2009; Ezati et al., 2020; Muir et al., 2020; deJonge 
et  al.,  2021;  Danielsen  et    al.,  2023;  Gurung  et  al., 
2023; Sandra et al., 2023), and 2 did not show statisti-
cally significant improvements (Marschin and Herbert, 
2021; Tong et al., 2021).

High-intensity interventions.
HIIT interventions (n = 6) included three RCTs (Eather 
et al., 2019; Philippot et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023), 
two  of  which  were  pilot  (Philippot  et  al.,  2022;  Zhu 
et al., 2023) and three non-RCTs (Martínez-Díaz and 
Carrasco, 2021; La Count et al., 2022), one of which 
was a pilot (Martínez-Díaz and Carrasco, 2021). Only 
the  RCT  pilot  intervention  (Philippot  et  al.,  2022) 
showed effectiveness for HIIT interventions. The oldest 
study in this group describes a procedure of sequential 
maximal exercises similar to HIIT, although published 
prior to the popularization of the term (O’Connor et 
al., 1995). They found that this training increased anx-
iety immediately post-training for low-fitness students, 
although  anxiety  returned  to  baseline  at  follow-up. 
This  study  also  included  maximal  treadmill  exercises 
with  both  highly  trained  runners  and  physically  fit 

students who also did not find the sessions effective in 
reducing anxiety.

Mind–body PA interventions.
There were 19 studies which used mind–body interven-
tions  (Albracht-Schulte  and  Robert-McComb,  2018; 
Caldwell  et  al.,  2009;  Dinani  et  al.,  2019;  Forseth 
et  al., 2022; Gao et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2013; Kim 
et al., 2004; Li et al., 2015, 2022; Salehian et al., 2021; 
Schmalzl  et  al.,  2018;  Strehli  et  al.,  2023;  Sun  et  al., 
2023; Tong et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2004; Xiao and 
Zheng, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al., 2015; 
Zhang  and  Jiang,  2023)  including  various  forms  of 
yoga,  Tai-Chi,  Qigong  (including  Baduanjin),  Kouk 
Sun Do, and meridian exercise, where studies (Caldwell 
et al., 2009; Tong et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021) were 
also  included  in  the  previous  section  as  they  were 
comparisons  between  mind–body  interventions  and 
MVIPA  interventions.  Overall,  these  studies  provide 
mixed evidence of effectiveness with only 6 out of 12 
RCTs finding at least one significant improvement in a 
mental health or QOL measure against the comparator 
(see  Supplementary  File  S1:  SF1).  Eight  studies  com-
pared  with  the  usual  routine,  and  one  each  for  quiet 
rest,  health  education  or  ujjayi  breath.  Most  of  these 
interventions  were  lengthy  with  typically  60-min  ses-
sions 2–5 times per week for 8–12 weeks. There were 
seven  non-RCTs,  with  five  claiming  the  intervention 
was effective, however, three of these were pilot studies 
with no comparator. Tong and colleagues (2021) found 
yoga to be superior to aerobic-style exercises however 
students  self-selected  into  groups  and  the  effect  was 
primarily considered to be through increased mindful-
ness rather than a direct measure of mental health or 
QOL.

Two studies which did not find Tai Chi or Baduanjin 
to be effective were from the same research group and 
rigorously  designed  with  similar  published  protocols 
(Zheng et al., 2013, 2014). They included long inter-
ventions  (each  12  weeks),  the  largest  sample  sizes 
(approximately  200  participants  each)  and  intention 
to treat analyses. In both cases, the authors posit that 
differences with the control group may have been diffi-
cult to detect as there were no limits on what activities 
the control group may have been involved with outside 
of  the  trial. The  background  of  the  participants  may 
be  an  important  consideration  as  they  were  students 
of traditional Chinese medicine, whereas the three tri-
als which were found to be effective involved nursing 
(Kim et al., 2004; Dinani et al., 2019) or general uni-
versity students (Xiao et al., 2021). These studies had 
smaller  sample  sizes  (approximately  30  students  per 
group)  and  ran  for  6,  8  and  12  weeks,  respectively. 
There was also a pilot trial with a small sample size of 
18 students which found evidence for the effectiveness 

S. Donnelly et al.of  Kouk  Sun  Do  in  improving  the  mental  health  of 
students  (Kim  et  al.,  2013).  The  non-RCT  studies 
which found some evidence for the effectiveness of Tai 
Chi included a pilot trial with no comparator (Wang 
et al., 2004) and, an Iranian study looking specifically 
at Corona-disease anxiety which did not find Tai Chi 
effective  in  comparison  with   cognitive-spiritual  ther-
apy (Salehian et al., 2021) but was more effective than 
the  control  (receiving  no  intervention).  Overall,  the 
evidence is mixed and suggests that mind–body exer-
cises may be effective for improving students’ mental 
health, however, this may depend on the background 
of  students  and  which  activities  they  already  usually 
participate in.

Miscellaneous interventions.
There were seven miscellaneous studies including five 
RCTs  (Mailey  et  al.,  2010;  Sharp  and  Caperchione, 
2016; Zimmermann and Mangelsdorf, 2020; Chawla 
et  al.,  2022;  Mota  et  al.,  2023)  and  two  non-RCTs 
(Tayama  et  al.,  2012;  Koschel  et  al.,  2017).  None  of 
these  studies  found  the  interventions  to  significantly 
improve  HE  students’  mental  health  and/or  QoL. 
There  were 
interventions 
three  pedometer-based 
(Mailey  et  al.,  2010; Tayama  et  al.,  2012;  Sharp  and 
Caperchione, 2016) which did not specify a number of 
steps or intervention lengths to participants. It could be 
argued  these  are  not  truly  movement-based  interven-
tions, but rather tracking-based interventions (with the 
aim that tracking might increase movement). Similarly, 
Mota  and  colleagues  (2023)  trialled  a  mobile  health 
app as an intervention which included exercise videos 
but did not specify the amount of exercise to complete. 
Another two studies were considered in this category 
as  they  involved  only  a  single  session  or  event.  One 
compared  a  single  20-min  creative  movement  versus 
art (Zimmermann and Mangelsdorf, 2020) and whilst 
both  groups  improved  over  time  there  was  no  differ-
ence  between  the  groups. The  other  allowed  students 
to  choose  activities  within  a  3-day  on-campus  event 
and whilst it is not called a pilot or feasibility trial, the 
sample size was 15 students (Koschel et al., 2017). The 
final study compared squat exercises with and without 
whole-body  vibration  and  both  groups  improved  in 
the domains of depression, anxiety and stress (Chawla 
et al., 2022). In this case, the intervention is the addi-
tion of the whole-body vibration in conjunction with 
the exercises, which was not effective.

Assessment of ROB
ROB  assessment for included RCT studies is summa-
rized (see Supplementary File S2: SF2) and outlined in 
relation to each RCT study (see Supplementary File S3: 
SF3). Most of the RCT studies included (n = 22; 58%) 
scored low in overall ROB, with a further 10 having an 

17

unclear ROB, and 6 having high ROB. It is important 
however to consider that it not possible to blind par-
ticipants to these types of interventions. Assessment of 
ROB for included non-RCT studies is summarized (see 
Supplementary File S4: SF4) and outlined in relation to 
each non-RCT study (see Supplementary File S5: SF5). 
Similarly to the RCT studies, overall, most of the non-
RCTs  reported  low  ROB  (n = 12;  60%),  whereas  five 
were unclear and the remaining three had a high ROB.

DISCUSSION
This systematic review suggests that exercise interven-
tions, which are MVIPA, can positively impact the men-
tal  health  and/or  QoL  of  HE  students.  Interventions 
include  Pilates,  aerobic  exercises,  basketball,  weight, 
resistance  and  gym  training,  dance,  exercise  games 
and home workouts and running. Mixed results were 
observed for mind–body interventions in improving the 
mental  health  and/or  QoL  of  HE  students.  However, 
there  was  substantial  variability  between  studies  in 
relation to the context, sample size, intervention dura-
tion and outcomes. Interventions involving HIIT were 
not found to be effective, except for a single pilot study. 
However, there were only three studies (Eather et al., 
2019;  Philippot  et  al.,  2022;  Zhu  et  al.,  2023)  trial-
ling HIIT in a similar design to other  movement-based 
interventions (in terms of duration) so this area needs 
further  research.  Interventions  which  gave  partici-
pants  access  to  tracking  their  physical  activity  (such 
as  pedometers  or  mobile  app)  which  did  not  have  a 
specific  session  length  or  duration  were  not  effective 
(Mailey et  al., 2010; Tayama et al., 2012; Sharp and 
Caperchione, 2016; Mota et al., 2023). Overall, there 
is  substantial  variety  in  the  type,  duration  and  meas-
urement of PA interventions, but there is evidence that 
these  can  improve  aspects  of  mental  health  with  an 
appropriate program.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF 
PRIMARY RESEARCH
PA  trials  rely  upon  the  participants  volunteering  to 
participate and in turn, conclusions about effectiveness 
cannot  be  drawn  for  students  in  general  as  they  may 
not  have  the  internal  motivation  to  initiate  or  main-
tain  participation  in  such  activities.  One  study  (Ezati 
et al., 2020) used a block allocation of students based 
on  dormitories  and  still  found  the  intervention  effec-
tive.  Further  studies  of  this  type  could  offer  insights 
into general adherence and attrition; however, it may 
be more challenging in settings where students are not 
‘captive’ based on residence. This is discussed further 
in recommendations. Additionally, most studies fail to 
detail  information  surrounding  participants’  regular 

Physical activity interventions in improving higher education students’ mental health18

activities and the activities of the control groups after 
not being assigned to the intervention arm.

Many  of  the  RCT  studies  included  in  this  review 
use  validated  instruments  to  measure  psychological 
outcomes (Table 2), including the STAI, PSS and BDI. 
Of  the  studies  included,  many  included  interventions 
administered  over  several  weeks  (≥20  weeks). This  is 
an  individual  strength  within  studies  only,  as  such  a 
wide array of instruments are used making any com-
parisons  between  studies  problematic.  Additionally, 
many studies used multiple measures and sequences of 
paired t-tests, inflating the type 1 error rate (i.e. false 
positives).  Assessment  of  multiple  psychological  out-
come  measures  also  raises  questions  surrounding  the 
accuracy of the results as participants may experience 
survey fatigue.

STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS 
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
A strength of this systematic review is the inclusion of 
exhaustive  searches  for  relevant  peer-reviewed  jour-
nal articles in six library databases. Although searches 
were  restricted  to  articles  written  in  the  English  lan-
guage only, research findings from a range of different 
countries  where  English  is  not  the  first  language  are 
included. The majority of included studies (n = 34 stud-
ies, 58.6%) had low ROB. Only nine studies (15.5%) 
were found to have high ROB.

This review has several limitations. First, it was not 
feasible to conduct meta-analyses due to heterogeneity 
in study designs, interventions, outcome measures and 
types of analysis conducted. Second, variations in the 
length and intensity of interventions limits direct com-
parison across all included studies. Lastly, this system-
atic review includes only peer-reviewed journal articles, 
so  publication  bias  may  be  a  potential  limitation  of 
the  findings  since  studies  with  negative  or  inconclu-
sive findings may be less likely to have been published 
(DeVito and Goldacre, 2019).

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE 
PRACTICE
This  review  supports  the  ongoing  evaluation  of 
MVIPA interventions for the mental health and well-
being of HE students. There is evidence that these can 
be effective for students who are interested in partici-
pating. Given the numerous forms of PA, it is valuable 
to  have  ongoing  research  on  different  interventions. 
However,  it  would  be  helpful  to  use  standardized 
instruments  (e.g.  STAI,  BDI,  PSS  and  DASS)  so  that 
future  meta-analysis  is  possible,  and  to  continue  to 
run  trials  which  continue  for  several  weeks. There  is 
currently only limited evidence of the effectiveness of 

PA as a general health-promotion activity aimed at all 
students for mental health. Further research is needed 
on  feasibility,  acceptability  and  adherence  within  this 
framework. One study used a block allocation of dor-
mitories (Ezati et al., 2020) and the intervention group 
did have slightly higher non-compliance than the con-
trol  group  (i.e.  5  vs  1  students,  respectively)  but  the 
overall  sample  size  is  still  relatively  low  (i.e.  67  stu-
dents). Additionally, two studies used entire classes as 
experimental  groups  (Marschin  and  Herbert,  2021; 
Tong et al., 2021), however, these were fitness and psy-
chology  classes,  respectively,  and  may  not  be  directly 
applicable  to  students  in  non-health-related  fields. 
From a health-promotion lens, it would be valuable to 
understand  which  activities  would  encourage  partici-
pation and adherence, and if students who are experi-
encing symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression can 
be encouraged to participate.

Most  studies  found  a  gender  bias  in  participation 
(i.e.  greater  proportion  of  females  than  males).  This 
limitation  is  not  unusual. A  systematic  review  on  the 
prevalence  of  mental  health  problems  in  undergrad-
uate  students  found  that  more  than  half  had  greater 
than 60% female participation (Sheldon et al., 2021). 
The only intervention in this review which skewed to a 
greater proportion of males (without being exclusively 
male)  included  basketball  as  an  intervention  (Xiao 
et  al., 2021). A systematic review of PA interventions 
for physical health also found that more than half of 
the  studies  included  predominantly  female  partici-
pants (Plotnikoff et al., 2015), and that overall interest 
in  the  interventions  was  relatively  low.  It  is  possible 
that  a  PA  intervention  explicitly  aimed  at  improving 
mental health rather than physical health may attract 
wider and more diverse participation. It would also be 
of interest to hear student perspectives on the ‘attrac-
tiveness’  of  programs  which  are  promoted  for  reduc-
ing  stress  and  anxiety,  rather  than  reducing  weight. 
Loneliness  was  only  considered  explicitly  in  one  of 
the studies in this review (Xiao et al., 2021), however, 
this is also a growing concern for HE students in wider 
research (Bernardon et al., 2011; Diehl et al., 2018).

Pragmatic trials which report initial interest, engage-
ment  throughout  the  semester  and  the  student  per-
spective  would  complement  the  existing  research  on 
efficacy.  It  is  unlikely  that  a  single  PA  intervention 
would  be  appealing  to  all  students,  however,  a  range 
of activities which could include a social element, may 
influence uptake and regular attendance. In this review, 
only  one  study  offered  a  range  of  activities  (Koschel 
et    al.,  2017).  Although  it  did  not  find  that  the  pro-
gram  was  effective  in  reducing  stress  on  quantitative 
measures before exams, it was only a 3-day interven-
tion with a small sample size and the qualitative feed-
back found that all students in the intervention group 

S. Donnelly et al.felt it had reduced stress. This approach may provide a 
framework for a larger and longer program.

CONCLUSION
This systematic review offers the first detailed synthe-
sis  on  PA  and  exercise-specific  interventions  targeted 
at improving the mental health and wellbeing of HE 
students.  The  evidence  suggests  that  these  interven-
tions  can  positively  impact  the  mental  health  and 
QoL of HE students. Evidence shows those interven-
tions which include MVIPA to be the most effective, 
including  aerobics,  dance,  basketball  and  running. 
Mind–body  exercises  including  yoga,  Tai  Chi  and 
Qigong  may  also  be  effective  depending  on  context 
however this evidence is mixed. HIIT and pedometer/
tracking interventions were not effective in improving 
psychological outcomes in HE students. Implemented 
long-term and widely across HE institutions, MVIPA 
interventions  may  improve  mental  health  in  HE 
students.
