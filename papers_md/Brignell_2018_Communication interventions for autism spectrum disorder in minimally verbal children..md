Background

A B S T R A C T

Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  has  an  estimated  prevalence  of  around  1.7%  of  the  population.  People  with  ASD  often  also  have
language difficulties, and about 25% to 30% of children with ASD either fail to develop functional language or are minimally verbal. The
ability to communicate effectively is an essential life skill, and difficulties with communication can have a range of adverse outcomes,
including poorer academic achievement, behavioural difficulties and reduced quality of life. Historically, most studies have investigated
communication interventions for ASD in verbal children. We cannot assume the same interventions will work for minimally verbal children
with ASD.

Objectives

To assess the effects of communication interventions for ASD in minimally verbal children.

Search methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase as well as 12 other databases and three trials registers in November 2017. We also checked
the reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews, contacting experts in the field as well as authors of identified studies about
other potentially relevant ongoing and unpublished studies.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of communication-focused interventions for children (under 12 years of age) diagnosed with ASD and
who are minimally verbal (fewer than 30 functional words or unable to use speech alone to communicate), compared with no treatment,
wait-list control or treatment as usual.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main results

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

This review includes two RCTs (154 children aged 32 months to 11 years) of communication interventions for ASD in minimally verbal
children compared with a control group (treatment as usual). One RCT used a verbally based intervention (focused playtime intervention;
FPI) administered by parents in the home, whereas the other used an alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) intervention
(Picture Exchange Communication System; PECS) administered by teachers in a school setting.

The FPI study took place in the USA and included 70 participants (64 boys) aged 32 to 82 months who were minimally verbal and had
received a diagnosis of ASD. This intervention focused on developing coordinated toy play between child and parent. Participants received
12 in-home parent training sessions for 90 minutes per session for 12 weeks, and they were also invited to attend parent advocacy coaching
sessions. This study was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the MIND Institute Research Program
and a Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York grant. The PECS study included 84 minimally verbal participants (73 boys)
aged 4 to 11 years who had a formal diagnosis of ASD and who were not using PECS beyond phase 1 at baseline. All children attended
autism-specific classes or units, and most classes had a child to adult ratio of 2:1. Teachers and parents received PECS training (two-day
workshop). PECS consultants also conducted six half-day consultations with each class once per month over five months. This study took
place in the UK and was funded by the Three Guineas Trust.

Both included studies had high or unclear risk of bias in at least four of the seven 'Risk of bias' categories, with a lack of blinding for
participants and personnel being the most problematic area. Using the GRADE approach, we rated the overall quality of the evidence as
very low due to risk of bias, imprecision (small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals) and because there was only one trial identified
per type of intervention (i.e. verbally based or AAC).

Both  studies  focused  primarily  on  communication  outcomes  (verbal  and  non-verbal).  One  of  the  studies  also  collected  information
on social communication. The FPI study found no significant improvement in spoken communication, measured using the expressive
language domain of the Mullen Scale of Early Learning expressive language, at postintervention. However, this study found that children
with lower expressive language at baseline (less than 11.3 months age-equivalent) improved more than children with better expressive
language and that the intervention produced expressive language gains in some children. The PECS study found that children enrolled
in the AAC intervention were significantly more likely to use verbal initiations and PECS symbols immediately postintervention; however,
gains were not maintained 10 months later. There was no evidence that AAC improved frequency of speech, verbal expressive vocabulary
or children's social communication or pragmatic language immediately postintervention. Overall, neither of the interventions (PECS or
FPI) resulted in maintained improvements in spoken or non-verbal communication in most children.

Neither study collected information on adverse events, other communication skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes.

Authors' conclusions

There is limited evidence that verbally based and ACC interventions improve spoken and non-verbal communication in minimally verbal
children with ASD. A substantial number of studies have investigated communication interventions for minimally verbal children with
ASD,  yet  only  two  studies  met  inclusion  criteria  for  this  review,  and  we  considered  the  overall  quality  of  the  evidence  to  be  very  low.
In the study that used an AAC intervention, there were significant gains in frequency of PECS use and verbal and non-verbal initiations,
but not in expressive vocabulary or social communication immediately postintervention. In the study that investigated a verbally based
intervention, there were no significant gains in expressive language postintervention, but children with lower expressive language at the
beginning of the study improved more than those with better expressive language at baseline. Neither study investigated adverse events,
other communication skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes. Future RCTs that compare two interventions and include a control
group will allow us to better understand treatment effects in the context of spontaneous maturation and will allow further comparison of
different interventions as well as the investigation of moderating factors.

Are communication interventions effective for minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder?

Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that is characterised by difficulties with the social aspects of communication, and repetitive
and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive body movements such as hand flapping, sensory sensitivities and circumscribed
interests).  People  with  ASD  commonly  also  have  language  difficulties,  and  around  25%  to  30%  of  children  are  unable  to  use  verbal
language  to  communicate  or  are  minimally  verbal  (use  fewer  than  30  words).  The  ability  to  communicate  is  a  crucial  life  skill,  and
difficulties with communication can have a range of negative consequences such as poorer academic performance, poorer quality of life
and  behavioural  difficulties.  Communication  interventions  generally  aim  to  improve  children's  ability  to  communicate  either  through
speech or by supplementing speech with other means (e.g. sign language or pictures).

What did we look at?

We searched 18 databases and trials registers in November 2016 and updated the search in November 2017.

What did our study find?

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We identified two trials involving 154 minimally verbal children who had ASD (aged 32 months to 11 years). The studies randomly divided
participants into those that received a communication intervention and a control group that did not receive the intervention but received
treatment as usual in the community. Both studies focused primarily on communication outcomes (verbal and non-verbal). One of the
studies also collected information on social communication. Neither study collected information on adverse events, other communication
skills, quality of life or behavioural outcomes.

One  study  looked  at  an  alternative  and  augmentative  communication  (ACC)  intervention  (Picture  Exchange  Communication  System;
PECS), which teachers gave the children in school. This intervention was conducted over five months and involved teacher training and
consultation. PECS is a staged approach where children are taught to exchange a single picture of a desired item or action to another person
who then responds to the request. The system progresses toward putting pictures together in sentences and using these sentences in a
variety of ways such as commenting and answering questions. This study included 84 participants (73 boys) aged 4 to 11 years and was
funded by the Three Guineas Trust. The other study looked at a verbally based intervention (focused playtime intervention; FPI), which is a
home-based parent education programme that aims to promote coordinated play with toys between parents and their children. This study
included 70 participants (64 boys) aged 32 months to 82 months and was funded by a Clinical and Patient Educators Association grant
(HD35470) from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the MIND Institute Research Program, and a Professional
Staff Congress-City University of New York grant.

Main results

There is limited evidence that verbally based and AAC interventions improve spoken and non-verbal communication in minimally verbal
children with ASD. Both studies included in this review reported gains in aspects of verbal or non-verbal communication (or both) for some
children immediately after the intervention. Neither of the interventions resulted in improvements in verbal or non-verbal communication
that were maintained over time for most children. We rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low because we only found two
eligible studies, and they involved few participants. Furthermore, both studies had some methodological limitations that increased their
risk of bias.

Recommendations

There is currently limited evidence that verbally based and ACC interventions improve expressive communication skills in minimally verbal
children with ASD aged 32 months to 11 years. Additional trials that use communication interventions and compare the effects of these
interventions to a control group are urgently required to build the evidence base.

Description of the condition

Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  one  of  the  most  common
neurodevelopmental  disabilities.  Data  from  the  Autism  and
Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network, an active
surveillance  system  in  the  USA,  has  reported  an  increase  in
prevalence  from  6.7  per  1000  in  the  year  2000  to  16.9  per  1000
in  2014  (Baio  2018).  Similar  increasing  trends  have  also  been
observed  worldwide  (Croen  2002;  Gillberg  1999;  Lai  2014;  May
2017).

ASD  is  characterised  by  social  communication  difficulties  and
repetitive, restricted behaviours and routines. A clinical diagnosis
of  ASD  is  based  on  observed  behavioural  criteria,  defined  in
the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM),
currently  in  its  fifth  edition  (APA  2013).  Genetic  causes  for
autism  are  increasingly  being  identified  (Stessman  2017),  and
the  environment  is  also  thought  to  play  a  role  (Chaste  2012;
Modabbernia 2017).

The most recent edition of the DSM removed language difficulties
as  a  core  feature  of  ASD  (APA  2013).  However,  a  significant
proportion  of  children  with  ASD  experience  difficulties  acquiring
spoken 
language.  The  severity  of  these  difficulties  varies
considerably.  Most  children  with  ASD  acquire  language  during
the  preschool  years  (Anderson  2007;  Howlin  2009),  typically  by
five  years  of  age  (Tager-Flusberg  2005).  However,  25%  to  30%  of
children with ASD fail to develop any functional spoken language
or  remain  minimally  verbal  (Anderson  2007;  Norrelgen  2015;
Rose 2016; Tager-Flusberg 2013). Language difficulties in children
with  ASD  can  result  in  a  number  of  adverse  sequelae,  including
behavioural difficulties (Bott 1997; McClintock 2003; Sigafoos 2000),
poor  adaptive  functioning  skills  and  poor  social  skills  (Anderson
2007;  Baghdadli  2007;  Hudry  2010).  This  can  result  in  reduced
quality  of  life  and  fewer  opportunities  to  participate  in  the
community.  Specifically,  in  some  studies  of  individuals  with  ASD
who  are  minimally  verbal,  communication  impairment  has  been
found to predict higher levels of aggression (Hartley 2008; Matson
2008), and in one study, up to 25% of minimally verbal children with
ASD were found to show an increase in aberrant behaviours such
as social withdrawal during adolescence (Lord 2010). Furthermore,
self-injurious behaviour has also been negatively associated with
expressive language in children with ASD (Baghdadli 2003).

There  has  been  a  lack  of  consensus  regarding  the  definition  of
the  term  'minimally  verbal'.  For  example,  Tager-Flusberg  2013
proposed benchmark criteria to identify this group; the first stage
is 'pre-verbal', and the next stage is 'first words' where the child is
required to have an age-equivalence of greater than 15 months for
vocabulary and pragmatic abilities. Kasari 2013 defines minimally
verbal  children  as  those  with  "a  very  small  repertoire  of  spoken
words  or  fixed  phrases  that  are  used  communicatively"  (p  480).
Others describe this group as children who use no words or single
words  (Thurm  2015).  A  number  of  studies  have  used  definitions
provided by diagnostic tools. For example, the Autism Diagnostic
Interview  -  Revised  (ADI-R)  is  a  structured  parent  interview  for
diagnosing ASD. Based on parent report about the child's language
abilities on some of the interview questions, the ADI-R can group
individuals  into  different  levels.  For  example,  "no  phrase  speech
and  greater  than  or  equal  to  three  words  but  single  words  used
on a daily basis" would be coded as a one, and "no speech used

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

on  a  daily  basis  and  less  than  a  5  word  vocabulary"  would  be
coded  as  a  two  (Rutter  2003).  For  the  purposes  of  this  review,
we  define  minimally  verbal  children  as  those  having  fewer  than
30  functional  words  and/or  being  unable  to  use  speech  alone  to
communicate,  despite  being  of  an  age  where  one  would  expect
them to use language (i.e. mental age of greater than two years).
This  working  definition  encompasses  many  specific  definitions
used across studies.

To date, research has not been able to identify a consistent reason
why  some  children  with  ASD  fail  to  acquire  verbal  language,
although  several  hypotheses  have  been  proposed.  Further  to
the  underlying  genetic  and  environmental  markers  of  ASD  and
language,  researchers  have  applied  structural  and  functional
imaging  or  neurophysiological  techniques  to  examine  potential
abnormalities in the brain structures of children with ASD to explain
language outcomes (De Fossé 2004; Freitag 2009; Just 2004; Kumar
2010;  Stanfield  2008).  It  remains  unclear,  however,  how  these
structural  and  functional  changes  directly  explain  the  language
difficulties that occur in children with ASD.

Further  to  the  neural  underpinnings  of  language  and  ASD,  some
researchers  have  focused  on  cognitive  mechanisms  impacting
verbal  development  in  these  children.  Cognitive  ability  (IQ)  and
difficulties with social communication skills seem to be influential
contributors (Norrelgen 2015). For example, one study found non-
verbal cognitive ability, gestures and imitation to be the strongest
predictors of later expressive language ability in children with ASD
(Luyster 2008). Joint attention skills may also have an impact on
the development of language in children with ASD. Joint attention
has been defined as the ability to respond to social interaction bids
from others and the ability to initiate social interaction with others,
as  well  as  the  co-ordination  of  these  two  skills  (Alessandri  2005;
Mundy 2007). A number of studies have found joint attention to be
predictive of later language abilities in both children with ASD and
in typically developing children (e.g. Charman 2003; Mundy 1990;
Mundy 2007). Consequently, a number of intervention programmes
have considered joint attention (Dawson 2010; Kasari 2012; Lawton
2012). Another study found that vocal and motor imitation, along
with  joint  attention,  were  more  impaired  in  children  with  ASD
who  had  not  developed  language  by  five  years  of  age  (Luyster
2008; Thurm 2007). It has been proposed that childhood apraxia of
speech may cause some children with ASD to fail to develop verbal
communication; however, to date, there has been limited evidence
to  support  this  hypothesis  (Pickett  2009;  Schoen  2011;  Shriberg
2011).

Whilst  aetiological  mechanisms  are  poorly  understood,  arguably
more  work  has  been  conducted  on  prognostication  of  outcomes
in these children. Studies suggest that early acquisition of speech
and language (by five years of age) is predictive of more favourable
outcomes, such as adaptive and social functioning, in later years
(Anderson  2007).  There  is  some  evidence  that  communication
interventions  are  less  effective  if  applied  after  five  years  of  age
(Pickett  2009).  Some  children  develop  spoken  language  during
adolescence (12 years of age and above) (Wodka 2013); the chance
of this happening is less likely than at younger ages (Tager-Flusberg
2013).  These  differential  responses  to  intervention  based  on  a
child's  age  warrant  further  research,  stratified  by  different  age
groups (preschool age or school age).

Description of the intervention

To  date,  there  is  no  consensus  regarding  the  most  appropriate
and  effective  communication  intervention  for  children  with  ASD
who  are  minimally  verbal.  This  Cochrane  Review  will  focus
on  interventions  that  target  the  acquisition  and  development
of  communication  skills  delivered  directly  during  social-
communicative  interactions  between  the  child  with  ASD  and
another  person  (usually  a  therapist).  As  such,  the  review  will
not  include  pharmaceutical  interventions,  dietary  interventions,
or  interventions  delivered  to  children  through  other  means
without another person facilitating this intervention (e.g. through
computers,  other  forms  of  technology  or  animals).  In  brief,  we
will  include  the  following  four  categories  of  communication
in  this  review:  verbally  based  communication
interventions 
interventions; augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
interventions;  combined  communication  interventions  (verbally
based  intervention  plus  ACC);  and  comprehensive  interventions
with a communication focus. The first three are language-focused
interventions that address specific communication skills, whereas
the  final  approach  is  a  comprehensive  treatment  model.  We
categorised  the  interventions  based  on  our  expertise  in  the
area,  clinical  reasoning  (typically  interventions  are  described  as
verbal,  AAC  or  both/multimodal),  and  what  is  known  about  the
mechanisms  around  interventions  for  minimally  verbal  children
with ASD.

Verbally based communication interventions

Verbally  based  interventions  use  verbal  strategies  to  improve
the  use  of  sounds,  words  and  sentences  to  express  oneself.
They  range  from  naturalistic,  child-centred  and  developmental-
pragmatic approaches (e.g. Gutstein 2002), to structured and more
didactic methods based on discrete trial training (DTT; e.g. Delprato
2001;  Paul  2013);  for  an  overview,  see  Paul  2008  and  Prizant
1998.  Responsive  Education  Prelinguistic  Milieu  Teaching  (RPMT)
is  an  approach  that  uses  modelling  of  communicative  behaviour
and  correction  of  child  responses,  time  delay  (waiting  for  the
child  to  initiate  or  respond)  and  incidental  teaching  in  natural
environments.  This  approach  capitalises  on  the  child's  natural
interests  (Yoder  2006a).  Some  novel  approaches  are  also  being
evaluated  to  see  if  these  may  address  the  specific  difficulties
experienced  by  minimally  verbal  children  with  ASD  (e.g.  Rapid
Motor Imitation Antecedent, a programme that has been adapted
from the DTT model) (Paul 2013).

AAC interventions

AAC interventions refer to a variety of non-verbal communication
methods to help minimally verbal children with ASD acquire and
develop  speech  and  language  skills  (Ganz  2004;  Kasari  2014;
Merinda  2009).  AAC  also  provides  children  with  an  alternative
means  of  communicating  if  they  are  unable  to  do  so  through
speech. There are two main types of AAC: aided and unaided. Aided
systems use supplementary materials, including graphic symbols
such as picture books, texture-based systems such as Braille, and
speech-generating devices (SGD) that produce digitalised speech.
Unaided  systems  use  manual  signs  and  graphic  gestures;  these
may  be  formal  such  as  sign  language  and  key  word  signs,  or
informal such as idiosyncratic movements. Some AAC interventions
incorporate  structured  and  hierarchical  behavioural  approaches.
The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS; Bondy 1998),
for  example,  includes  six  phases  of  teaching;  the  child  moves  up

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

the  hierarchy  as  they  make  progress.  In  the  first  phase  the  child
is  physically  prompted  to  make  specific  requests  for  items  they
want  using  pictures,  and  in  the  final,  most  advanced  phase,  the
child  uses  the  pictures  to  communicate  independently.  In  recent
years, the use of new technologies, such as smartphones, iPads and
tablets,  has  burgeoned.  A  systematic  review  of  tablet  computers
and  portable  media  devices  that  had  been  adapted  to  serve  as
SGD  found  that  the  devices  usually  facilitated  verbal  ability  and
that  language  acquisition  was  faster  for  individuals  using  SGDs
compared to manual signs or low-technology AAC (Lorah 2015).

Combined communication interventions (verbally based
intervention plus AAC)

to  as 

referred 

'total
Combined  programmes,  sometimes 
communication' interventions, use components from both verbally
based  communication  interventions  and  AAC  interventions.  The
Hanen More than Words programme (Sussman 2001), for example,
is  a  parent  training  programme  that  teaches  parents  to  use
strategies  (e.g.  comment  on  the  child's  interests,  use  AAC,  use
cues to encourage turn-taking) in their everyday routines to help
their  child  to  communicate.  The  Means,  Opportunities,  Reasons
and  Expectations  (MORE)  programme  is  another  approach  that
uses  both  verbally  based  communication  interventions  and  AAC
interventions (Emerson 2013).

Comprehensive interventions with a communication focus

A broad range of comprehensive programmes for ASD have been
developed. These target a range of developmental skills in addition
to communication, such as cognition, behaviour, play, emotional
regulation  and  social  skills.  Pivotal  Response  Training  is  an
example of a naturalistic behavioural intervention, which facilitates
stimulus  and  response  generalisation,  increases  spontaneity,
reduces  prompt  dependency  and  increases  motivation  (Koegel
2006).  Other  examples  of  comprehensive  interventions  include
the  Denver  Model  (and  Early  Start  Denver  Model)  (Rogers  2000;
Rogers 2009), the Relationship Development Intervention (Gutstein
2002),  the  Learning  Experience  and  Alternative  Program  (LEAP;
Strain 1998), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related
Communication  Handicapped  Children  (TEACCH)  programme
(Mesibov 2005), the Social Communication, Emotional Regulation
Transactional Support (SCERTS) model (Prizant 2006), and applied
behaviour analysis (Lovaas 1987; Reichow 2009).

Comprehensive  programmes,  most  of  which  have  not  been
adapted for use in children who are minimally verbal, go beyond
the  scope  of  the  current  review.  We  will  only  include  such
programmes  if  they  have  been  adapted,  so  that  the  focus
is  on  communication  and  the  primary  aim  of  the  study  is
to  improve  communication  skills.  An  example  of  the  type  of
intervention  that  may  be  included  is  that  used  in  a  recently
published trial by Kasari 2014. This trial combined Joint Attention,
Symbolic  Play,  Engagement  and  Regulation  intervention  with
Enhanced Milieu Teaching (JASP + EMT) to improve communicative
spoken  language  in  minimally  verbal  children.  Similarly,  we  will
only  include  parent-mediated  interventions,  such  as  the  Parent-
Mediated Communication Focused Treatment (PACT; Green 2010)
and the Hanen More than Words programme (Sussman 2001), if the
intervention targets communication and the aims of the study are
communication specific.

Each of the approaches above use different mechanisms to improve
speech acquisition and development in minimally verbal children

(see How the intervention might work section). Consequently, we
had  planned  to  conduct  separate  subgroup  analyses  to  explore
these  different  types  of  interventions  further  (classified  in  the
manner  stated  above,  or  even  more  precisely,  depending  on  the
number of studies included in each subgroup).

How the intervention might work

Verbally based communication interventions

The underlying theory behind many verbally based interventions
is  that  the  lack  of  verbal  communication  originates  from  other
inherent  areas  of  difficulty  in  ASD,  including  reduced  levels  of
social  motivation,  reduced  attention  to  child-directed  speech,
immaturity  of  speech  motor  development  and  generally  poor
imitation  skills.  Limitations  in  all  of  these  domains,  if  serious
enough,  may  lead  to  severe  language  impairment.  If  this  theory
is  correct,  an  intervention  that  focuses  specifically  on  speech
production together with more intensive and orientated guidance
from  caregivers,  may  be  enough  to  trigger  the  speech  learning
process. Similarly, efforts that seek out approaches for reciprocal
interaction mediated by word exchanges might also work through
'tuning on' or 'tuning up' the expressive language system (Schoen
2011; Shriberg 2011).

AAC interventions

There  are  a  number  of  theories  as  to  why  AAC  systems
may  facilitate  vocal  production.  First,  based  on  the  principle
of  automatic  reinforcement,  AAC  interventions  may  form  an
interactive reinforcement system that increases the effectiveness of
speech production (Millar 2006). Essentially, if the spoken word and
its  symbol  are  presented  simultaneously  along  with  a  reinforcer,
minimally verbal children might begin to produce approximations
of  the  word.  Second,  for  those  children  with  deficits  in  motor
skills or cognitive function, mastering other skills for establishing
basic  communication  may  help  them  to  conquer  the  difficulties
encountered during vocal production (Romski 1996). Third, it has
been  proposed  that  AAC  interventions  may  reduce  the  pressure
for  children  to  communicate  verbally,  and,  in  doing  so,  reduce
demands  on  auditory-vocal  channels  and  indirectly  increase  the
chances of spontaneous vocal production (Kasari 2014).

Comprehensive interventions with a communication focus

Some  comprehensive  programmes  have  been  adapted  to
specifically target communication. For instance, PRT was designed
to  target  'pivotal'  areas  of  a  child's  development  (including
motivation, response to multiple cues, self-management, and the
initiation of social interactions) (Koegel 2006). Pivotal behaviours
are  central  to  a  broad  range  of  areas  of  a  child's  functioning
and,  when  promoted,  may  lead  to  improvements  in  verbal
communication.  In  addition,  parent-mediated  communication
interactions  by
interventions  aim  to  enhance  parent-child 
increasing  parental  sensitivity  and  responsiveness  to  the  child's
communication  needs.  Through  a  range  of  interaction  strategies,
such  as  routines  and  familiar,  repetitive  language  and  pauses,
the  child's  prelinguistic  and  early  language  skills  may  improve
(Green  2010;  Sussman  2001).  Finally,  JASPER  interventions  may
help develop the child's verbal skills by promoting the child's play
skills and attention to social interaction (Kasari 2013).

Why it is important to do this review

The ability to communicate is an essential life skill. Communication
is  key  to  forming  and  maintaining  relationships,  performing
academically  and  enabling  people  to  participate  and  function  in
their  community.  Difficulties  communicating  can  also  have  an
impact on family quality of life and stress. The evidence suggests
that  25%  to  30%  of  children  with  ASD  will  remain  minimally
verbal  when  they  reach  school  age  (Anderson  2007;  Norrelgen
2015;  Tager-Flusberg  2013).  Historically,  most  studies  that  have
investigated  communication  interventions  for  children  with  ASD
have  focused  on  the  language  development  of  verbal  children.
Little attention has been given to children who are minimally verbal
(Kasari 2013; Paul 2013; Tager-Flusberg 2013), with the exception
of  a  workshop  on  the  topic  of  minimally  verbal  children  with
ASD  organised  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  in  2010,
which signalled the critical need for greater research focus in this
area  (NIH  2010).  At  present  there  is  no  consensus  on  what  the
most effective intervention approach for minimally verbal children
with ASD may be. We cannot assume that interventions that work
for  verbal  children  will  also  work  for  children  who  are  minimally
verbal, so a systematic review to evaluate the existing evidence on
interventions for this population is needed.

reviews  have 

A  number  of 
investigated  communication
interventions for children with ASD (e.g. Goldstein 2002; Kim 2009;
Thunberg 2013). None of these reviews have focused specifically on
children with ASD who are minimally verbal. The existing reviews
have not systematically reviewed the quality of included studies,
making  it  difficult  to  judge  risk  of  bias  for  each  included  study.
This  Cochrane  Review  will  use  a  more  comprehensive  range  of
databases to search the literature, apply different inclusion criteria
compared  to  the  previous  reviews,  and  provide  the  most  up-to-
date  information  on  the  available  evidence  on  interventions  for
minimally verbal children with ASD.

In  this  review,  we  aim  to  address  two  main  questions.  First,
are  communication  interventions  beneficial  for  minimally  verbal
children  with  ASD  and,  if  so,  which  type  of  intervention  is  the
most effective? Second, do the outcomes of preschool and school-
age children with ASD differ when such interventions are applied?
This  review  will  provide  a  summary  of  the  available  evidence  on
interventions  for  children  with  ASD  who  are  minimally  verbal.
This will assist decision-making around the types and amount of
intervention for this group of children as well as inform the planning
of resources to support them. This information is highly relevant for
clinicians, service-providers, families and policymakers.

1. They had received a diagnosis of ASD, autism, autistic disorder,
Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder (PDD)
and  PDD  -  not  otherwise  specified  (PDD-NOS).  The  diagnosis
must  have  been  made  using  standard  diagnostic  criteria,
such  as  the  Childhood  Autism  Rating  Scale  (CARS;  Schopler
1986), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS; Gilliam 1995), Autism
Diagnostic  Interview  -  Revised  (ADI-R;  Lord  1994),  Autism
Diagnostic  Observation  Schedule  (ADOS;  Lord  2000),  or  the
Diagnostic  Interview  for  Social  and  Communication  Disorders
(DISCO; Wing 2002), or by using established diagnostic criteria
such  as  the  International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD;  WHO
1992) or the DSM (APA 2013).
2. They were under 12 years of age.
3. They  were  minimally  verbal,  defined  in  any  of  the  following
ways: having fewer than 30 functional words (Kasari 2013), being
unable to use speech alone to communicate (described as being
non-verbal, having little or no speech, complex communication
needs, severe communication impairment), or both.

4. They  were  at  a  cognitive  level  where  one  would  expect  them
to  use  words  (i.e.  mental  age  of  greater  than  12  months,  as
measured  by  non-verbal  developmental  quotient  or  IQ).  This
was to ensure they were not pre-verbal.

We  did  not  exclude  participants  if  they  had  comorbidities
(e.g.  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  epilepsy)  in
addition to ASD.

Types of interventions

Language-focused  interventions  that  primarily  aimed  to  improve
spoken  communication  (expressive  language  or  speech,  or  both)
or  use  of  non-verbal  communication  (e.g.  AAC)  compared  with
no  intervention,  wait-list  control  or  treatment  as  usual.  We
excluded  studies  that  had  other  treatment  controls  (i.e.  where
one  intervention  is  directly  compared  to  another  in  the  RCT)
because  there  is  still  no  standard  or  established  communication
intervention for minimally verbal children with ASD and therefore
no  reference  intervention.  Eligible  interventions  included  the
following.

1. Verbally  based  communication 

(such  as
Prelinguistic Milieu Teaching (PMT; Yoder 2006a), Discrete Trial
Training  (DTT;  Lovaas  1987),  Prompts  for  Restructuring  Oral
Muscular Phonetic Targets (PROMPT; Chumpelik 1984)).

4. Comprehensive

We  excluded  studies  that  used  comprehensive  interventions  for
ASD  that  targeted  a  range  of  developmental  skills  (such  as  fine
motor skills) unless the aims of the study were specifically focused
on spoken communication or the use of AAC, or both. Equally, we
only  included  parent  training  programmes  if  they  had  a  specific
focus on spoken communication, use of AAC or both.

We  excluded  interventions  that  focused  on  improving  social
skills  as  a  primary  aim,  although  social  communication  may
have been a secondary outcome. We excluded interventions that
required  physical  support  from  a  third  party  for  the  child  to

by  Biklen  1990,  and  Rapid  Prompting  Method  (HALO  2016).  We
only included interventions that involved the child communicating
independently.

Types of outcome measures

2. Non-verbal communication or AAC, measured by, for example,
the phase of PECS (Bondy 1998), frequency of use of vocabulary
on a speech generating device, number of initiations using PECS
or the number of key word signs a child uses.

3. Combined  spoken  and  non-verbal  communication.  This  refers
to measures that do not distinguish whether they are spoken or
non-verbal. For example, the outcome 'frequency of initiations'
may include both spoken and unspoken initiations.

4. Adverse  events  (e.g.  increased  stress  in  parents  or  increased
anxiety  in  the  child  in  response  to  completing  a  particular
intervention),  measured  by  tools  such  as  the  Parenting  Stress
Index  (Abidin  1995)  or  the  Spence  Children's  Anxiety  Scale
(Spence 1998).

Secondary outcomes

1. Social communication and pragmatic language skills, measured
using tools such as the ADOS social interaction domain or the
Early Social Communication Scales (Lord 2000; Mundy 2003).
2. Other  communication  skills  (e.g.  adaptive  communication),
measured  by,  for  example,  the  Vineland  Adaptive  Behavior
Scales - Second Edition (VABS-II; Sparrow 2005).

3. Quality of life for the individual or their family (e.g. emotional
well-being  and  support)  and  parent  satisfaction,  measured
by  either  standardised  instruments,  such  as  the  Parenting
Stress  Index  (Abidin  1995),  Beach  Family  Quality  of  Life  Scale
(Beach Center on Disabilities 2006), tools such as Focus on the
Outcomes of Communication Under Six (Thomas-Stonell 2013),
or by novel instruments invented by the study designers.

4. Non-core  aspects  of  behaviour  and  function  (e.g.  non-
verbal  cognition,  challenging  behaviours,  self-mutilation  and
aggression), measured either by standardised instruments or by
novel instruments invented by the study designers.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant
reviews for additional references. In addition, we asked experts in
the field to provide details of ongoing clinical trials and any relevant
unpublished material not captured by our Electronic searches. We
also contacted authors of identified trials to ask if they knew of any
other published or unpublished studies that our searches missed.

Data collection and analysis

Table  1  summarises  the  methods  we  had  planned  to  use,  as  per
our published protocol (Brignell 2016), but which did not employ
or were not relevant to this review. We may use these preplanned
methods in subsequent updates of this review.

Selection of studies

Two  review  authors  (AB,  KC)  independently  screened  titles  and
abstracts identified by our searches for potentially relevant studies.
Of  those  deemed  potentially  relevant,  the  same  review  authors
obtained  and  independently  assessed  the  full  text  against  the

Two  review  authors  (AB,  KC)  independently  assessed  the  risk
of  bias  of  each  included  study  using  the  criteria  outlined  in
the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions
and  set  out  in  Appendix  2  (Higgins  2017).  The  same  two  review
authors consulted a third assessor (AM) to resolve any differences
of  opinion.  Both  reviewers  assessed  the  risk  of  bias  for  each
included study across the following seven domains and assigned
ratings  of  low,  high  or  unclear  risk  of  bias:  random  sequence
generation,  allocation  concealment,  blinding  of  participants  and
personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome
data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential sources of
bias.

Where available, we have provided a quote from the study report
together with a justification for the judgement in the 'Risk of bias'
table  (beneath  the  Characteristics  of  included  studies  table).  We
summarised the 'Risk of bias' judgements across different studies
for each of the domains listed above by graph and by text in the Risk
of bias in included studies section of the review. Where information

on risk of bias related to unpublished data or correspondence with
a trial author, we noted this in the 'Risk of bias' table.

When considering the effects of interventions, we took into account
the risk of bias for the studies that contributed to that outcome.

Measures of treatment effect

Dichotomous outcomes

We  calculated  odds  ratios  (OR)  for  dichotomous  variables  (e.g.
clinical  improvement  or  no  clinical  improvement)  and  presented
these with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Ordinal outcomes

We  presented  ordinal  outcomes  directly  as  ordinal  data,  and
presented assumed (control) and corresponding (intervention) risk
compared for each ordinal value separately. We presented data as
corresponding risk per 1000. We did not transform ordinal data into
continuous or dichotomous data due to the skew of the data and
the nature of the ordinal scales (an arbitrary cut-point would not be
as clinically meaningful as the full ordinal scale).

Continuous outcomes

For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) as long
as  studies  used  the  same  measurement,  or  standardised  mean
differences (SMDs) when studies use different scales, together with
their  corresponding  95%  CI.  We  ensured  that  higher  scores  for
continuous  outcomes  had  the  same  meaning  for  the  particular
outcome,  explained  the  direction  to  the  reader,  and  reported
where we reversed the directions if this was necessary. If a study
did  not  report  standard  deviations  (SD)  or  standard  errors,  we
contacted  the  corresponding  author  of  the  study  to  obtain  this
information. If necessary, we sought to calculate effect estimates
from  t  statistics,  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  tables  or  other
statistics, as appropriate.

Unit of analysis issues

We encountered no unit of analysis problems. Howlin 2007 was a
cluster-randomised  trial  (with  17  clusters),  and  the  analysis  took
clustering  into  account.  See  Table  1  and  Brignell  2016  for  the
methods reported in our published protocol for managing unit of
analysis  issues  should  they  arise  in  subsequent  updates  of  this
review.

Dealing with missing data

For studies without complete reports (studies identified by abstract
only),  or  without  complete  information  in  full  reports  (critical
data could not be found in report), we contacted investigators or
study  sponsors  to  obtain  the  missing  data,  where  possible.  We
documented any details provided by the study authors and used for
further analysis. Table 1 summarises the methods we had planned
to use, as per our published protocol (Brignell 2016), but which did
not employ or were not relevant to this review. We may use these
preplanned methods in subsequent updates of this review.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We  assessed  clinical  heterogeneity  by  examining  differences
between  the  two  included  studies.  We  examined  participant
characteristics, timing and type of interventions or controls, as well
as types of outcomes measured (see Description of studies in the
Results section below).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Assessment of reporting biases

We were unable to assess reporting bias as planned (Brignell 2016),
as there were too few studies.

Data synthesis

We  were  unable  to  conduct  our  analyses  as  planned  because  of
the  small  number  of  studies  that  met  inclusion  criteria  for  this
review (see Table 1 for unused methods and Brignell 2016). Given
that  no  comparison  included  more  than  one  study,  it  was  not
appropriate to synthesise the data into one meta-analysis. Instead,
we  have  presented  the  results  of  each  included  study  separately
and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment on each study.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

When an individual study provided information on our prespecified
subgroups, we examined differences visually, by inspecting their CI;
non-overlapping CIs indicate a statistically significant difference in
effect between subgroups.

We  were  not  able  to  conduct  our  preplanned  subgroup  analyses
(Brignell 2016), as there were too few studies for meta-analyses. See
Table 1 for details on these planned subgroup analyses.

Sensitivity analysis

We  were  unable  to  conduct  our  preplanned  sensitivity  analyses
(Brignell 2016), as there were too few studies for meta-analyses. See
Table 1 for details on these planned sensitivity analyses.

'Summary of findings' tables

We  created  'Summary  of  findings'  tables  using  the  software
developed  by  the  GRADE  working  group  for  our  two  main
comparisons  (GRADEpro  2015):  PECS  or  FPI  versus  treatment  as
usual. We included the following outcomes, assessed immediately
postintervention,  in  the  tables:  spoken  communication;  non-
verbal  communication  or  AAC;  combined  verbal  and  non-verbal
communication or AAC; adverse events; social communication and
pragmatic  language  skills;  other  communication  skills;  quality  of
life  for  the  individual  or  their  family  and  parent  satisfaction;  and
non-core aspects of behaviour and function.

Two  review  authors  (HS,  AB)  independently  assessed  the  overall
quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach (GRADE
2004;  Guyatt  2008);  AM  arbitrated  any  disagreements.  Using  this
approach, the same two authors graded the quality of the evidence
for each outcome as high, moderate, low or very low, according to
the presence of the following criteria: limitations in the design and
implementation of studies; indirectness of evidence; unexplained
heterogeneity  or  inconsistency  of  results;  imprecision  of  results;
and high probability of publication bias. We presented these ratings
in the 'Summary of findings' tables and provided our reasons for
downgrading the quality of the evidence in the footnotes.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Included studies

Two studies met our inclusion criteria for this review (Howlin 2007;
Siller  2013).  See  the  Characteristics  of  included  studies  for  full
details of each study.

Study design

Howlin 2007 was an open-label, cluster-RCT (17 clusters) in which
the unit of randomisation was the school classroom (average class
size of five children). Siller 2013 was a standard, single-blinded RCT
(blind to assessor).

Participants

Both included studies aimed to include children with ASD who had
limited  or  no  use  of  spoken  language.  However,  their  inclusion
criteria had differences in their definition of spoken language, as
well as the age range of participants: Howlin 2007 included children
aged 4 to 11 years, whereas Siller 2013 included children aged six
years or younger.

Verbally based intervention

Siller 2013 included 70 children (64 boys, 6 girls), with a mean age
of 58.3 months (SD 12.7) in the intervention group and 55.9 months
(SD  11.9)  in  the  control  group.  The  study  included  children  with
limited or no use of spoken language (generally fewer than 25 words
and  no  phrases),  and  whose  mothers  were  fluent  in  English  and
who lived within a 90-minute driving distance to the lab. All children
had a previous diagnosis of ASD, which was confirmed in the study
using  both  the  ADI-R  and  ADOS-G.  All  children  met  the  criteria
for autistic disorder on the ADI-R, with 64 meeting the criteria for
autistic  disorder  on  the  ADOS.  The  remaining  five  children  were
classified as having ASD. One child did not complete the ADOS.

were  involved  in  first  half  of  the  session,  but  only  the  parent
conducted  therapy  in  the  second  half  of  the  session.  Both
intervention and control groups were invited to a parent advocacy
group. Information was collected on the non-project services and
school programmes attended by both groups 12 months before the
study, between intake and exit, and between exit and follow-up.

AAC intervention

Howlin 2007 compared the PECS intervention to a control group,
and  administered  the  intervention  within  a  school  context.  PECS
is an intervention that involves teaching an individual to exchange
pictures with other people for desired objects or activities, thereby
facilitating the child's ability to initiate communication. There are
a  series  of  phases  that  are  arranged  in  a  hierarchy  of  increasing
difficulty. In this study teachers and parents received PECS training
(two-day  workshop  or  13  hours)  followed  by  consultation.  The
active treatment period began about one week after training. PECS
consultants  conducted  six  half-day  consultations  with  each  class
once per month over five months. The consultants recommended
and  demonstrated  strategies  to  improve  children's  use  of  PECS
in  the  classroom,  monitored  teachers'  progress,  and  provided
systematic  feedback  on  implementation  of  PECS.  The  classroom
teachers  were  not  completely  naïve  to  PECS,  but  generally  their
prior use of PECS had been minimal and limited to the first phase
of PECS, which included supporting (scaffolding) the child to make
requests (Howlin 2007).

Outcome measures

Both included studies used different tools to measure our primary
outcomes of spoken and non-verbal communication, and neither
study mentioned adverse events in their reports (Howlin 2007; Siller
2013).

AAC intervention

Verbally based intervention

Howlin  2007  included  84  children  (73  boys,  11  girls),  with  a
mean  age  of  73.1  months  (SD  15.8)  in  the  immediate  treatment
group,  86.6  months  (SD  12.7)  in  the  delayed  treatment  group,
and  85.6  months  (SD  3.6)  in  the  no  treatment  group.  The  study
recruited  children  from  17  classes  (clusters)  and  required  that
each class had a minimum of three children meeting the following
criteria:  children  had  little  or  no  functional  language  (i.e.  not
exceeding  single  words/productions),  no  evidence  of  sensory
impairment, and were not using PECS beyond phase 1 (i.e. could
only exchange symbols with prompting). All children had a formal
clinical diagnosis of autism (i.e. they met the criteria for ASD on the
ADOS). Notably, Howlin 2007 used multiple intervention groups (i.e.
one immediate treatment group and one delayed treatment group,
compared to one control (no treatment) group).

Interventions

The two included studies examined different interventions: Howlin
2007  utilised  an  AAC  intervention  and  Siller  2013  utilised  a
verbally  based  intervention.  No  studies  that  utilised  combined
or  comprehensive  interventions  met  our  inclusion  criteria  (see
Criteria for considering studies for this review section).

Verbally based intervention

Siller  2013  compared  focused  playtime  intervention  (FPI)  to  a
control  group.  FPI  is  capacity-building  approach  that  promotes
coordinated  toy  play  between  the  parent  and  child.  There  is  an
ordered  sequence  of  eight  topics.  Both  the  parent  and  clinician

Siller 2013 used the expressive language subtest of the Mullen Scale
of Early Learning (MSEL) to assess language change over time. The
MSEL is a developmental assessment tool that measures a range of
developmental areas. It contains two language subtests: expressive
and receptive language. Siller 2013 used age-equivalent scores and
collected measures at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and
12 months after the completion of the intervention.

Siller 2013 did not measure any of our secondary outcomes.

AAC intervention

Howlin  2007  videotaped  daily  snack  sessions  for  a  maximum
of  15  minutes  and  coded  three  variables:  frequency  of  child
communicative  initiations;  frequency  of  use  of  PECS  symbols;
and  frequency  of  speech  (including  non-word  vocalisations).
Frequencies  were  expressed  as  rates  per  minute.  The  trial  also
included  standardised  measures  based  on  the  Expressive  One
Word  Picture  Vocabulary  Test  and  the  British  Picture  Vocabulary
Scales.  These  scales  were  completed  three  times  throughout  the
study; at baseline after randomisation, after two school terms (7.5
to  10.7  months  after  baseline  assessments),  and  at  the  follow-
up  assessment  (10.4  months  after  the  end  of  intervention  for
the  immediate  treatment  group,  7.1  months  after  the  end  of
intervention  for  control  group,  and  4.6  months  after  the  end  of
intervention for the delayed treatment group).

Regarding the secondary outcomes, Howlin 2007 evaluated change
in social communication over time using two scores from the ADOS-
G:  the  communication  domain  score  and  the  reciprocal  social
interaction (RSI) domain score. Howlin 2007 did not measure any of
our other secondary outcomes.

Funding

The  Three  Guineas  Trust  provided  funding  support  for  one  study
(Howlin  2007).  The  other  study,  Siller  2013,  was  supported  by  a
Clinical  and  Patient  Educators  Association  grant  (HD35470)  from
the  National  Institute  of  Child  Health  and  Human  Development,
the  MIND  Institute  Research  Program,  and  a  Professional  Staff
Congress-City University of New York grant.

Excluded studies

Of  the  69  full-text  reports  that  appeared  to  meet  our  inclusion
criteria (Criteria for considering studies for this review), 11 had two
or  more  publications  (as  noted  in  the  reference  list  of  Excluded
studies).  After  grouping  together  multiple  reports  of  the  same
study, we identified 52 unique studies. We excluded all 52 studies
for the following reasons.

1. Study  design:  we  excluded  11  studies  because  they  were  not
RCTs (D'Elia 2014; Jalili 2014; Mandell 2013; Rogers 2006; Sallows
2005;  Schroder  2015;  Serret  2017;  Stock  2013;  Sweeney  2016;
Vernay 2017; Zeina 2015).

to 

2. Population:  we  excluded  25  studies  due 

ineligible
participants;  in  19  studies  participants  did  not  meet  the
prespecified  definition  of  'minimally  verbal'  (Aldred  2004;
Casenhiser 2013; Chang 2016; Elder 2011; Fletcher-Watson 2013;
Flores 2014; Fteiha 2017; Hardan 2015; Ingersol 2012; Jemison
Pollard  2010;  Kaale  2014;  Kaiser  2013;  Kasari  2006;  Oosterling
2010; Pickles 2016; Reitzel 2013; Roberts 2011; Solomon 2014;
Venker 2012); 2 studies included participants with low language
levels, but the inclusion criteria and descriptive characteristics
did not specify that the children were 'minimally verbal' (Landa
2011;  Kasari  2015);  3  studies  did  not  use  prespecified  ASD
diagnostic  criteria  (Martins  2013;  Simpson  2013;  Smith  2000);
and 1 study included participants without ASD (Romski 2010).

3. Intervention:  we  excluded  six  studies  due  to 

ineligible
interventions; 
intervention
four  studies  used  a  broader 
programme  without  a  specific  communication  focus  (Drew
2002;  Tonge  2014;  Wetherby  2014;  Whelan  2010),  and  two
studies  did  not  include  communication-focused  interventions
(Field 2001; Wong 2010).

4. Comparator:  we  excluded  10  studies  due  to  lack  of  control
comparator  (Goods  2013;  Gould  2015;  Kasari  2014;  Paul  2013;
Sandiford  2013;  Schriebman  2014;  Yoder  1988;  Yoder  2006b;
NCT01018407; NCT01751698). Although all 10 RCTs specifically
focused on communication interventions for minimally verbal
children  with  ASD,  they  did  not  have  a  control  group  for
comparison.  Rather,  they  compared  one  type  of  intervention
to  another.  These  studies  compared  a  range  of  interventions,
including one type of verbally based intervention versus another
type  of  verbally  based  intervention,  and  an  AAC  intervention
versus  a  verbally  based  intervention.  These  studies  are  listed
below.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Verbally based intervention versus another type of verbally
based intervention

Six  studies  compared  a  verbally  based  intervention  with  another
type  of  verbally  based 
intervention.  Paul  2013  compared
Milieu  Communication  Training  versus  a  Rapid  Motor  Imitation
Antecedent intervention. Sandiford 2013 compared melodic based
communication  therapy  with  traditional  speech  and  language
therapy.  Gould  2015  compared  a  Joint  Attention,  Symbolic  Play,
Engagement and Regulation (JASPER) intervention versus Discrete
Trial  Training  (DTT);  the  primary  outcomes  were  based  around
play,  but  investigators  also  collected  language  outcomes.  In  a
pilot  study  by  Goods  2013,  all  participants  received  behaviour-
based 
interventions  at  school  30  hours  per  week.  Fifteen
children  who  were  minimally  verbal  were  randomised  into  a
control  or  intervention  group,  which  consisted  of  substitution  of
JASPER  intervention  for  the  behaviour-based  intervention  for  30
minutes,  twice  weekly  for  three  months.  We  also  excluded  two
ongoing studies: NCT01751698 and NCT01018407. One of these is
investigating DTT versus an interpersonal developmental approach
(NCT01018407), and the other is comparing DTT versus JASP + EMT
(NCT01751698).

AAC intervention versus verbally based intervention

Four  studies  compared  an  AAC  intervention  to  a  verbally  based
intervention.  Two  studies  compared  the  PECS  to  a  different
intervention;  one  compared  PECS  to  Responsive  Education
and  Prelinguistic  Milieu  Teaching  (Yoder  2006b),  and  the  other
compared PECS to Pivotal Response Training (Schriebman 2014).
Kasari  2014  administered  a  JASP  +  EMT  intervention  for  all
participants but added an SGD intervention to one of the groups.
One  study  compared  four  groups  who  received  signing  alone,
speech therapy alone, simultaneous signing plus speech therapy,
and alternating signing plus speech therapy (Yoder 1988).

See Table 2 for further details on studies comparing two different
interventions. Note, we have not included ongoing studies in the
table, as they do not yet have results.

Studies awaiting classification

Based  on  title  and  abstract,  one  conference  paper,  Gilbert  2012,
appeared  to  meet  our  inclusion  criteria  (Criteria  for  considering
studies for this review). However, the study authors did not confirm
if  it  did,  and  we  were  not  able  to  obtain  further  detail  or  data.
The  study  authors  reported  the  participants  were  also  part  of  a
larger,  ongoing  study  (see  the  Characteristics  of  studies  awaiting
classification  table  for  details).  This  study  compared  a  verbally
based intervention to a control group.

Ongoing studies

Two  trials  met  our  inclusion  criteria  but  are  not  yet  completed
(NCT02291172; NCT02464527). See the Characteristics of ongoing
studies tables for details on these studies.

Risk of bias in included studies

Please  see  the  'Risk  of  Bias'  tables  (under  Characteristics  of
included  studies  tables)  for  details  of  the  risk  of  bias  in  each
included  study,  and  Figure  2  for  a  tabular  summary.  We  judged
one study, Howlin 2007, to be at low risk of bias in three domains
(selection  (random  sequence  generation),  attrition  and  reporting
bias); high risk of bias in two domains (performance and detection

bias); and unclear risk of bias in two domains (selection (allocation
concealment)  and  other  potential  sources  of  bias).  We  judged
the  other  study,  Siller  2013,  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias  in  three
domains (detection, attrition and reporting bias); high risk of bias

in one domain (performance bias); and unclear risk of bias in three
domains  (selection  (random  sequence  generation  and  allocation
concealment) and other potential sources of bias).

Figure 2.   Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.

Allocation

Sequence generation

We  considered  one  study,  Howlin  2007,  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias
in this domain. In this school-based study, classes were stratified
according to size. In each stratum, classes were randomly allocated
to  one  of  the  three  conditions  using  an  online  randomisation
programme (www.random.org). We judged the other study, Siller
2013,  to  be  at  unclear  risk  of  bias  in  this  domain  as  they  did  not
report details of how randomisation was completed. In this study,
to  ensure  that  two  out  of  every  four  consecutive  children  were
assigned  to  the  control  group,  the  children  were  randomised  in
blocks of four.

Allocation concealment

Neither  study  reported  on  how  the  individuals  were  informed  of
their allocation to intervention or control groups; for example, by
using  sealed  envelopes  (Howlin  2007;  Siller  2013).  The  nature  of
these included studies makes it impossible to blind the participants
or people administering the intervention to their group allocation.
Consequently, we rated both studies at unclear risk of bias in this
domain.

Blinding

Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)

We considered both studies to be at high risk of performance bias
(Howlin 2007; Siller 2013). Participants and personnel were aware
of allocation to intervention or control groups in both studies.

Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)

We  judged  one  study  to  be  at  low  risk  of  detection  bias  (Siller
2013).  Staff  conducting  assessments  or  coding  were  blinded  to
group assignment, and prior to all outcome assessment sessions,
parents were reminded not to reveal their group assignment to the
assessment staff. We judged the other study, Howlin 2007, to be at
high risk of detection bias, as assessors were not blinded to group
assignment. The study authors stated in the manuscript that this
was because of financial and personnel limitations.

Incomplete outcome data

We  rated  both  included  studies  to  be  at  low  risk  of  attrition
bias  (Howlin  2007;  Siller  2013).  In  Siller  2013,  three  participants
dropped out from the intervention group and two from the control
group  at  the  one  year  follow-up  point  (Siller  2013).  Analyses
were  conducted  on  an  intention-to-treat  basis  using  multiple
imputations  to  deal  with  the  missing  data.  Statistical  analysis
comparing those lost to follow-up and those who remained found
that  participants  who  dropped  out  of  the  study  took  longer  to
complete  the  intervention  period  and  received  fewer  autism-
specific, non-project services in the community, on average. These
differences  were  then  statistically  corrected.  In  Howlin  2007,  one
child  from  the  immediate  treatment  group  moved  away  after
the  trial  started,  and  seven  children  in  the  delayed  treatment
group moved out of classes prior to the start of the intervention.
These  children  did  complete  assessments,  and  participants  were
analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (Howlin 2007).

Selective reporting

We  rated  both  studies  to  be  at  low  risk  of  reporting  bias  as  all
outcomes  reported  in  the  study  had  been  prespecified  in  the
prospective  trial  registration/protocol  (Howlin  2007;  Siller  2013).
Neither study, however, reported data on adverse events.

Other potential sources of bias

We considered both trials to be at unclear risk of other bias (Howlin
2007;  Siller  2013).  It  is  difficult  in  autism  spectrum  research  to
control  for  interventions  being  obtained  in  the  local  community,
and neither trial collected detailed information on any additional
interventions received by the control groups. In addition, Howlin
2007  reported  that  some  classes  in  the  control  arm  may  have
been  using  some  PECS.  Treatment  fidelity  may  also  have  been
an  issue,  although  the  study  authors  argue  it  was  intended  as  a
pragmatic trial. The cluster-randomised controlled design has the
potential  to  introduce  biases  through  differential  recruitment  of
participants within each cluster and methodological difficulties in
applying the intention-to-treat approach. In the Howlin 2007 study,
differential  recruitment  was  unlikely  to  have  taken  place,  as  all
children enrolled in each class received the intervention allocated
to the class, and there was no opt-out of any children. However, the
Howlin 2007 study had withdrawal of both one whole cluster as well
as individual participants within a cluster, along with the addition of
one child to the cluster part way through the trial. It is unclear how
to analyse these participants from an intention-to-treat perspective
and the effect of any bias introduced.

Summary  of  findings  2  Summary  of  findings:  Picture  Exchange
Communication  System  (PECS)  versus  treatment  as  usual  for
minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder

We  included  two  studies  in  this  review,  both  of  which  utilised
different types of intervention: Howlin 2007 utilised an AAC (PECS)
intervention,  whereas  Siller  2013  utilised  a  verbally  based,  play-
based  (FPI)  intervention.  No  studies  met  our  inclusion  criteria
for the remaining two intervention types (combined interventions
and comprehensive interventions). There was substantial clinical
heterogeneity between the included studies, including varied age
ranges  and  inclusion  criteria,  and  different  outcome  measures
(standardised language scores versus coded verbal and non-verbal
behaviours). There was also methodological heterogeneity in the
trial  designs  (one  cluster  RCT  and  one  standard  RCT).  Thus,  we
decided  that  it  was  not  appropriate  to  pool  the  data  in  meta-
analysis, and consequently have provided a narrative description
of the results below.

FPI versus treatment as usual

The  primary  outcome  described  below  is  taken  from  the  same
study with 70 children (Siller 2013).

Primary outcomes

Spoken communication

Siller  2013  measured  expressive  language  using  the  expressive
language  domain  of  the  Mullen  Scale  of  Early  Learning
developmental assessment tool. This study reported that the main
effect for FPI was not significant (t (df = 57) = 1.21, P = 0.23; very low-
quality evidence, Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Exploratory  analysis  found  that  baseline  measures  of  expressive
language  (specifically  24  children  who  entered  the  study  with
expressive language ability under the 11.3-month level) moderated
a significant, medium-to-large effect, accounting for approximately
25% of the variance in the children's subsequent language gains.

Adverse events

Siller 2013 reported no data on adverse events.

Siller  2013  did  not  measure  our  other  primary 
(non-
verbal  communication  or  AAC,  or  combined  verbal  and
non-verbal  communication  or  AAC)  or  secondary  outcomes
(social  communication  and  pragmatic  language  skills;  other
communication  skills;  quality  of  life  for  the  individual  or  their
family and parent satisfaction; non-core aspects of behaviour and
function).

PECS versus treatment as usual

All primary and secondary outcomes described below come from
the same, single study with 84 children (Howlin 2007).

Primary outcomes

Spoken communication

Frequency of speech (including non-word vocalisations)

Howlin 2007 found no significant main effect of PECS on frequency
of speech (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.62, P = 0.83; very low-quality
evidence, Summary of findings 2).

Expressive vocabulary

Howlin 2007 found no significant main effect of PECS on expressive
vocabulary (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.15, P = 0.87).

Non-verbal communication or AAC: frequency of use of PECS symbols

Howlin 2007 reported a significant main effect of PECS on frequency
of  use  of  PECS  symbols  immediately  postintervention.  Children
in  the  PECS  group  were  3.90  times  (OR  3.90,  95%  CI  1.75  to
8.68,  P  <  0.001;  very  low-quality  evidence,  Summary  of  findings
2)  more  likely  to  to  be  in  the  higher  PECS-use  category  than  the
control  group  from  time  point  1  (baseline)  to  time  point  2  (7.5
to 10.7 months after baseline). However, the main effect was not
maintained at the 10-month follow-up (time point 3) for the group
who had the intervention earlier, with these children being no more
likely than the control group to be in a higher PECS-rate category
(OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.62, P = 0.48).

Combined verbal and non-verbal communication or AAC: frequency of
child communicative initiations (included both verbal and non-verbal
initiations)

Howlin  2007  reported  a  significant  main  effect  of  PECS
on  the  frequency  of  communicative  initiations  immediately
postintervention. Children in the PECS group were 2.73 times more
likely to to be in the higher initiation-rate category than the control
group from time point 1 to time point 2 (OR 2.73 95% CI 1.22 to 6.08,
P < 0.05 (specific P value not reported in paper); very low-quality
evidence, Summary of findings 2). However, the main effect was not
maintained at the 10-month follow-up for the group that had the
intervention earlier, with these children being no more likely than
the control group to have a higher initiation rate (OR 1.08, 95% CI
0.30 to 3.90, P = 0.91).

Adverse events

Howlin 2007 reported no data on adverse events.

Secondary outcomes: social communication and pragmatic
language skills

Howlin 2007 found no evidence of a significant main effect of PECS
immediately  postintervention  on  ADOS  communication  domain
scores (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.12, P = 0.10) or on the RSI domain
scores (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.19, P = 0.13). However, at the 10-
month  follow-up  of  the  immediate  treatment  group,  there  was  a
significant main effect for RSI scores on the ADOS (OR 0.28, 95% CI
0.09 to 0.89, P < 0.05 (specific P value not reported in paper)). PECS
was associated with a decrease in severity scores on this domain,
with children being 3.57 times (OR) more likely to be in the lower
ordinal category (less severe difficulties) on the RSI scale.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We  included  only  two  studies  in  this  review  (Howlin  2007;  Siller
2013), investigating different types of interventions. Thus, we were
not able to conduct subgroup analyses or assess heterogeneity as
we had planned (Brignell 2016); see Table 1 for methods archived
for use in future updates. Both included studies provided limited
information on subgroups (Howlin 2007; Siller 2013). Neither study
provided  the  specific  subgroup  information  prespecified  in  our
protocol (Brignell 2016); however, one study provided information
that  was  related  to  baseline  language  capability  (Siller  2013).  In
this study, authors conducted exploratory moderator analyses to
assess whether the baseline characteristics of the children modified

treatment gains. They found that baseline measures of expressive
language moderated effects on residual gain scores in expressive
language  (t  (df  =  57)  =  −2.47,  P  <  0.05).  For  24  children  with
expressive  language  below  a  11.3-month  level  at  baseline,  effect
size estimates indicated a medium-to-large effect: ʄ2 = 0.25 (range
0.09 to 0.36). We have reported analyses conducted by the study
authors  as  we  did  not  have  the  data  required  to  see  if  the  CI
overlapped.

Quality of the evidence

Overall,  based  on  the  GRADE  criteria  (GRADE  2004),  we  rated  the
quality of the evidence for all reported outcomes as very low. For
one study, Siller 2013, we downgraded the quality of the evidence
by  one  level  for  risk  of  bias  (rated  at  unclear  or  high  risk  of  bias
on  4/7  domains)  and  by  two  levels  for  imprecision  due  to  small
sample size and because there was only one trial for comparison
(see Summary of findings for the main comparison). For the other
study, Howlin 2007, we downgraded the quality of the evidence by
one level for risk of bias (rated at unclear or high risk of bias on 4/7
domains)  and  by  two  levels  for  imprecision  due  to  small  sample
size, wide CIs, and because there was only one trial for comparison
(see Summary of findings 2).

Summary of main results

We  identified  and  included  in  this  review  two  studies  (N  =  154)
that met our inclusion criteria (Howlin 2007; Siller 2013). We were
not  able  to  pool  the  data  from  these  studies  in  a  meta-analysis
because they used different types of communication interventions.
One  study  assessed  a  verbally  based  intervention  (FPI)  versus  a
control group that involved parent training (Siller 2013), whereas
the other study assessed an AAC intervention (PECS) administered
by teachers versus a control group (Howlin 2007).

The  study  that  examined  a  verbally  based  intervention  (FPI)
versus a control group, Siller 2013, found no significant effect for
the intervention group on spoken communication (assessed with
expressive  language  age-equivalent  scores).  However,  a  further
exploratory  analysis  found  that  children  with  relatively  lower
expressive language ability at baseline (specifically, less than 11.3
months age-equivalent) benefited more from the intervention than
children with better expressive language at baseline. The authors
concluded that parents of children with relatively better language
may require additional strategies to FPI.

The other study that assessed an AAC intervention (PECS) versus
a  control  group,  Howlin  2007,  found  that  children  in  the  PECS
group were significantly more likely to use verbal communicative
initiations  and  PECS  symbols  more  frequently 
immediately
postintervention.  However,  this  effect  was  not  maintained  for
either  of  these  two  outcomes  at  the  follow-up  assessment  10
months  later.  This  study  did  not  find  a  significant  effect  of  PECS
for frequency of speech or for expressive and receptive vocabulary
based on standardised tools (Howlin 2007). Of interest, the study
found no effect for the secondary outcomes of communication and
RSI ADOS scores immediately postintervention; however, PECS was
associated  with  a  decrease  in  RSI  severity  score  (i.e.  less  severe
deficits in RSI skills) at the 10-month follow-up point.

Neither  study  found  an  effect  on  the  primary  outcome  that  was
maintained over time, and neither study provided information on

adverse  effects  of  interventions.  It  was  possible  there  was  some
contamination  in  one  of  the  included  studies  (Howlin  2007),  as
some  teachers  designated  to  the  control  group  may  still  have
been  using  some  PECS,  as  it  was  not  a  requirement  that  PECS
use be ceased for the control group. Furthermore, children in the
control group in the Siller 2013 study may also have been accessing
treatments in the community. This may have impacted the strength
of  the  findings  in  each  study  and  should  be  considered  when
interpreting our results.

The  findings  from  Siller  2013  on  moderators  of  interventions
raises important questions around variation in treatment response.
Given  the  substantial  heterogeneity  in  ASD  and  wide  range  of
underpinning  factors  that  may  be  at  play  in  preventing  a  child
from talking, it is not surprising that children respond differently
to  different  interventions  (see  Hudry  2017,  Trembath  2014  and
Vivanti 2014 for further discussion around predictors of treatment
response). One approach that may facilitate a better understanding
of  who  responds  better  to  which  intervention  is  to  compare  two
interventions  and  investigate  child  factors  that  may  moderate
outcomes from each one. This approach has been used in several
studies  of  children  with  ASD  who  are  minimally  verbal  (e.g.  Paul
2013; Yoder 2006b), and these studies have identified factors that
may  be  important  in  predicting  a  child's  response  to  different
interventions.  For  example,  Paul  2013  found  that  children  with  a
receptive  language  age-equivalent  below  18  months  were  more
likely  to  do  better  with  the  Rapid  Motor  Imitation  Antecedent
training, whereas those scoring above 18 months were more likely
to  do  better  with  Milieu  Communication  Training.  Furthermore,
Yoder  2006b  found  that  Responsive  Education  and  Prelinguistic
Milieu Teaching increased the frequency of generalised turn-taking
and  generalised  initiating  joint  attention  more  than  PECS,  but
that the increase in generalising joint attention only occurred for
children who had at least some initiating joint attention at baseline.
PECS, however, increased the children's ability to make generalised
requests more than Responsive Education and Prelinguistic Milieu
Teaching for those children who had limited ability to initiate joint
attention at baseline. Our understanding of who responds to what
type of intervention is still in its infancy, but studies such as these
have the potential to help us to move further toward personalising
currently available interventions.

control  groups;  however,  it  is  important  to  note  that  there
are  10  other  trials  focused  on  communication  interventions  for
minimally  verbal  children  with  ASD  that  compared  two  different
interventions  (rather  than  using  a  control  group).  These  studies
make contributions to the literature, but we excluded them based
on  our  study  protocol  (Brignell  2016),  in  which  we  specified  that
we  would  only  include  studies  that  compared  an  intervention
to  a  control.  We  could  not  include  these  studies  in  the  data
analysis  for  our  review,  but  several  showed  positive  results  (e.g.
Goods 2013; Kasari 2014; Paul 2013; Yoder 1988), providing some
indirect  evidence  for  interventions  in  minimally  verbal  children
with  ASD.  Such  studies  help  us  to  parse  the  heterogeneity  in
the minimally verbal population with ASD by showing that, while
different  treatments  may  not  be  effective  for  all  children  in  this
population,  they  may  improve  expressive  language  in  certain
subgroups. At the highest level, however, these studies suggest that
expressive  language  can  at  least  be  improved  in  some  minimally
verbal children with ASD and point the way to future work to more
carefully identify the baseline characteristics of children who may

respond  to  one  or  another  therapy.  We  have  provided  detail  on
these studies in this review because we recognise their value to the
field  of  interventions  in  minimally  verbal  children  with  ASD  (see
Table 2).

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

This  review  provides  up-to-date  evidence  on  communication
interventions  for  children  with  ASD  who  are  minimally  verbal.
We  identified  only  two  studies  with  a  total  of  154  participants.
One  study  was  conducted  at  the  children's  homes,  the  other  at
school,  and  both  studies  had  good  applicability.  We  found  data
extraction and analysis difficult because of the absence of a uniform
tool  for  outcome  measurement,  as  well  as  the  non-standardised
design in one study (cluster-RCT with multiple groups). Moreover,
we  were  unable  to  examine  some  important  outcomes,  such  as
adverse  events  and  functional  communication  skills.  No  studies
that employed comprehensive or combined interventions met our
inclusion criteria, so we were unable to draw any conclusions about
the  evidence  for  these  interventions.  Overall,  we  conclude  that
the completeness of current evidence is low. Across all outcomes,
available  data  are  insufficient  to  show  whether  verbally  based
or  AAC  interventions  (specifically  PECS  and  FPI)  are  effective
at  increasing  verbal  or  augmentative  communication  skills  in
minimally verbal children with ASD.

Quality of the evidence

Using the GRADE approach (GRADE 2004), we considered the overall
quality of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded all outcomes
by at least two points due to imprecision (only two trials identified,
both  of  which  had  small  sample  sizes)  and  inconsistency  (large
CIs).  The  studies  did  not  always  report  sufficient  detail  to  allow
assessment of risk bias.

Potential biases in the review process

We did not note any obvious biases in this review. To minimise bias,
two review authors independently screened the records, extracted
data, and assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence. With the
exception of one study that could not be classified due to lack of
detail around inclusion criteria (Characteristics of studies awaiting
classification),  we  included  all  studies  that  met  our  inclusion
criteria (Criteria for considering studies for this review). A limitation
of  this  review  is  that  we  did  not  include  studies  that  included
treatment-to-treatment comparisons. These studies make up most
intervention trials for children who are minimally verbal. However,
we followed our prior, published protocol of this review (Brignell
2016), and we have reported details of the treatment-to-treatment
comparison trials in a separate table (see Table 2).

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

We did not identify any other studies or reviews.

Implications for practice

This  review  identified  two  RCTs  that  used  a  communication
intervention  in  minimally  verbal  children  with  ASD  and  included
a control group. There was limited evidence that communication
interventions  (AAC  and  verbally  based)  improve  aspects  of
communication for minimally verbal children with ASD. In the study

that used an AAC intervention (PECS), children in the intervention
group were more likely to use verbal or non-verbal communicative
initiations and PECS symbols than the control group immediately
after  the  intervention.  In  the  study  that  used  a  verbally  based
intervention,  children  did  not  make  significant  improvements  in
their  expressive  language  as  a  group;  however,  a  subgroup  of
children did improve. Both studies had methodological limitations,
and we rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low. The
search used in this review also identified 10 RCTs that compared
one  or  more  interventions  in  minimally  verbal  children  with  ASD
but  did  not  have  a  control  or  treatment-as-usual  comparison
group  (Goods  2013;  Gould  2015;  Kasari  2014;  NCT01018407;
NCT01751698; Paul 2013; Sandiford 2013; Schriebman 2014; Yoder
1988;  Yoder  2006b).  These  studies  did  not  meet  our  inclusion
criteria  (Criteria  for  considering  studies  for  this  review),  but  they
make a contribution to the literature in the field of ASD in minimally
verbal children. Clinicians, families and consumers should be aware
of  the  lack  of  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  communication
interventions for minimally verbal children with ASD. If they choose
to use these interventions, they should carefully monitor the child's
progress and adapt as indicated.

Implications for research

Our  review  may  be  viewed  as  having  inclusion  criteria  that  were
too strict to capture the aforementioned 10 studies (Goods 2013;
Gould 2015; Kasari 2014; NCT01018407; NCT01751698; Paul 2013;
Sandiford  2013;  Schriebman  2014;  Yoder  1988;  Yoder  2006b),  as
well as other studies that used non-RCT designs (e.g. single-case
design  studies).  While  the  inclusion  of  these  studies  was  beyond
the scope of the current review, a systematic review of such studies
that  employs  appropriate  statistical  methods  for  treatment-to-
treatment comparisons, along with an assessment of study quality,
would be desirable. Future studies that compare two interventions
but also include a control group will allow us to better understand
effects  in  the  context  of  spontaneous  maturation  as  well  allow
comparison  of  two  interventions.  Control  groups  can  include
treatment as usual or wait-list controls, and these types of groups
avoid  the  ethical  challenges  around  withholding  intervention  for

such  a  high-needs  group.  To  increase  sample  sizes  and  improve
the evidence base, intervention studies that include children with
a range of language abilities could potentially present the results
of the minimally verbal children as a separate subgroup, or studies
could use subsamples of children who have genetic diagnoses (and
are at greater risk for being minimally verbal).

Appropriate  outcome  measures  that  are  sensitive  to  change  are
required  because  currently  available  standardised  tools  are  not
well  suited  to  study  outcomes  in  minimally  verbal  children.  In
addition,  studies  should  investigate  other  important  outcomes,
such as function and participation, social communication, adaptive
communication  skills,  quality  of  life  and  behaviour,  along  with
primary  measures  of  communication.  Economic  implications
should  also  be  evaluated.  Studies  will  need  to  be  creative  in
developing  novel  approaches  to  interventions  that  are  closely
linked  to  our  developing  understanding  of  the  aetiology  and
neurobiology of ASD and related disorders, the ultimate goal being
tailored  interventions  based  on  child  and  family  characteristics,
needs  and  strengths.  This  review  found  that  most  studies  of
minimally verbal children have focused on the preschool and early
primary  school  years,  and  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  studies  in
older  children  who  remain  minimally  verbal.  While  the  literature
has  emphasised  the  importance  of  being  able  to  speak  before
five years of age on later outcomes (e.g. Pickett 2009), we cannot
assume  that  children  over  the  age  of  five  years  do  not  make  the
same progress with intervention, or that interventions for younger
children are appropriate and effective for older children.

Howlin 2007 

Methods

Design: cluster-randomised-controlled trial with school as the randomisation unit (schools ran-
domised into 3 groups: immediate treatment group (ITG), delayed treatment group (DTG), and no treat-
ment group (NTG))

Date of study: not stated but study published in 2007

Duration of study:

1. ITG: time point 1-time point 3 mean 17.9 months (SD 0.5)
2. DTG: time point 1-time point 3 mean 14.6 months (SD 1.9)
3. NTG: time point 1-time point 3 mean 15.3 months (SD 0.7)

Setting: greater London and South East England, UK. A total of 17 classes with > 4 children in each
class were enrolled in the study. All children were attending autism-specific classes or units. Most had
child:adult ratio of 2:1. All classes followed the national curriculum. Teaching approaches differed but
most took an eclectic approach utilising pictures and visuals and structured teaching.

Participants

Sample size: 84 (note, n = 88 after randomisation but one ITG class (n = 4) withdrew before baseline as-
sessment)

1. ITG: 5 classes, n = 26
2. DTG: 6 classes, n = 30
3. NTG: 6 classes, n = 28

Withdrawals: 1 class withdrew after randomisation. 1 child withdrawn from NTG (failed to meet diag-
nostic criteria after baseline assessments done), and 1 child joined the DTG. 1 child form ITG moved
away following intervention and before final assessment. 7 children moved out of DTG pre-intervention
but completed final assessments.

Sex:

1. ITG: 21 boys, 5 girls

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

2. DTG: 27 boys, 3 girls
3. NTG: 25 boys, 3 girls

Age:

1. ITG: mean 73.1 months (SD 15.8, range 47.3–106.3)
2. DTG: mean 86.6 months (SD 12.7, range 62.0–113.5)
3. NTG: mean 85.6 months (SD 13.6, range 61.0–122.1)

Inclusion criteria*:

1. Children with a formal clinical diagnosis of autism (meets criteria for ASD on ADOS)
2. Little or no functional language (i.e. not exceeding single words/productions)
3. No evidence of sensory impairment
4. Aged between 4 years and 11 years
5. Not using PECS beyond phase 1 (i.e. can only exchange symbols with prompting)

*Each class required minimum of 3 children meeting the above criteria

Exclusion criteria:

1. Children without a diagnosis of ASD
2. Children who were in a classroom where there were fewer than 3 children meeting inclusion criteria

Interventions

Intervention: PECS

1. ITG: 7.6 months (approximately 2 terms) of PECS training followed by a 10.4 month follow-up period
2. DTG: 7.5 months of no treatment/baseline followed by 7.1 months of PECS training

Control: NTG; 15.3 months with no PECS training

Administration: intervention and assessments occurred in the school setting. Teachers and parents re-
ceived PECS training (2-day workshop or 13 h) followed by consultation. The active intervention peri-
od began about 1 week after training. PECS consultants conducted 6 half-day consultations with each
class once per month over 5 months. The consultants recommended and demonstrated strategies to
improve children's use of PECS in the classroom, monitored teachers' progress and provided systemat-
ic feedback on implementation of PECS. Note, classroom teachers were not completely naïve to PECS,
but generally the use of this was minimal and limited to phase I scaffolded requesting.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes

Researchers videotaped daily snack session for maximum of 15 min. Three variables were coded:

1. Frequency of child communicative initiations
2. Frequency of use of PECS symbols
3. Frequency of speech (including non-word vocalisations); frequencies expressed as rates per minute

Secondary outcomes

These included standardised measures: Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, British Picture
Vocabulary Scales completed 3 times through the study. The Communication and Reciprocal Social In-
teraction Domain scores of the ADOS-G were also used.

Timing of outcome measurement: children were filmed/assessed at baseline, after the end of the first
intervention period, and after the end of the second intervention period

Notes

Comment: none

Funding source: supported by the Three Guineas Trust. Pyramid UK also supported the project (by pro-
viding the PECS consultants). It is unclear if these consultants were paid.

Random sequence genera-
tion (selection bias)

Low risk

Comment: 15/18 class groups excluded due to fewer than 3 eligible children in
the same classroom. Classes were stratified according to size. In each stratum,
classes were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 conditions using an online ran-
domisation programme (www.random.org).

Unclear risk

Comment: study does not mention how allocation was performed

High risk

Comment: participants and personnel were aware of allocation. It is not possi-
ble to perform blinding as placebo not possible for this type of trial

Quote: "Because of financial and personnel limitations… assessors (and
videotape coders, see below) were not blind to group assignment" (p 476)

Comment: staff conducting assessments or coding (or both) were not blinded
to group assignment. See directly above.

Comment: 1 child from the immediate treatment group moved away after
the trial started, and 7 children in the delayed treatment group moved out of
classes prior to the intervention starting. Analyses were conducted on an in-
tention-to-treat basis. Did not compare those who dropped out to those who
remained in terms of characteristics

Selective reporting (re-
porting bias)

Low risk

Comment: all measures reported in the published trial protocol were reported
in the Results section. Does not state whether adverse outcomes were collect-
ed in protocol or paper

Other bias

Unclear risk

Comment: PECS may have been used to some extent in the control group.
Also, there may be bias due to the cluster-randomised control design of the
study; however, the extent of this bias is unclear (see Risk of bias in included
studies for more details).

Quote: "it was not possible to collect ongoing measures of treatment fidelity…
[but] this is of less importance for pragmatic effectiveness studies than for effi-
cacy studies." (p 479)

classified as having autism spectrum disorder on the ADOS-G. One child did not complete the ADOS.

Exclusion criteria: not stated

Intervention: focused playtime intervention (FPI). FPI is capacity building approach that promotes co-
ordinated toy play between the parent and child. There is an ordered sequence of 8 topics. Both parent
and clinician are involved in the first half of the session, then only parent in second half (further details
are provided in the report). Participants received 12 in-home training sessions lasting 90 min per ses-
sion for 12 weeks. They were also invited to attend parent advocacy coaching sessions.

Control group: invited to attend parent advocacy coaching sessions

Administration: 3 assessments conducted; 2 in UCLA lab and 1 at home. Information was collected
on the non-project services and school programmes attended by intervention and control groups: 12
months before study, between intake and exit, and between exit and follow-up. No significant differ-
ences were found between groups.

Intervention: SSP, consisting of sounds and words being systematically paired with delivery of a
preferred item

Control: wait-list control

Administration: participants in the SSP l attend clinic-based sessions for 1 h per day, 5 days per
week, for 6 weeks. The SSP procedure will consist of sounds and words being systematically paired
with delivery of a preferred item. The participants will be recorded by a vocal recorder by the par-
ent/guardian at home or in the community.The wait-list control group will wait for 6 weeks; chil-
dren will not receive any treatment during this period. The wait-list control group will then receive
the SSP procedure (delayed procedure) after the 6-week wait.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes

1. Change in frequency of target vocalisations or approximations (or both) at home (time frame:
week 1, week 6). Vocalisation data will be collected in the home via the vocal recorder device.
Target vocalisation is when the participant emits the target sound or word. Change is defined as
the difference in the number of vocalisations at week 1 and week 6.

2. Change in parent-reported vocalisations (time frame: week 1, week 6). A parent-rated checklist
will assess their child's vocal language, and parents will rate improvement as a yes or no question
on the checklist at week 1 and week 6.

3. Feasibility of intervention assessed by reliability of delivery by therapists (time frame: week 6).
The number of times SSP is reliably delivered by the therapist to the participant during the in-
tervention period of 6 weeks will be assessed. Reliable delivery consists of the therapist pairing
sounds and words with preferred items in accordance to the protocol.

4. Acceptability of SSP by parents (time frame: week 6). The level of compliance and willingness of
the parents/guardian to bring the participants to the sessions will be assessed. Acceptability is
when the parent/guardian brings the participant to the clinic for the sessions for 1 h a day, 5 days
per week, for 6 weeks

Method

Approach

Types of outcomes

We will synthesise results for the following time points: at the end of intervention, one year after
the end of intervention, and after more than one year of follow-up.

Measures of treatment ef-
fects

Dichotomous data

If a study only presents data for the change from baseline to follow-up in the published report, we
will contact the corresponding author of the study to obtain data at each time point.

Multiple outcomes

If included studies provide multiple, interchangeable measures of the same construct at the same
time point, we will calculate the average SMD across the outcomes and the average estimated vari-
ances for continuous variables; for dichotomous measures, we will choose only the most reliable
measure based on the authors' statement or our judgement (e.g. measures from the most com-
monly used scales). If included studies report the same outcomes (measured by the same scale/
tool) differently (e.g. as a dichotomous variable in one study but as a continuous variable in an-
other), we will attempt to transform them to uniform variables using the methods described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2017). In case a well-established
cut-off point exists, we will transform continuous data to dichotomous data. Otherwise, we will re-
quire detailed information from the study authors when they reported dichotomous results. Al-
ternatively, we will use the SMD (or log odds ratios) and their standard errors to combine dichoto-
mous and continuous data, when possible, using the generic inverse variance method in Review
Manager 5 (RevMan 5; ReMan 2014). If we are unable to transform the variables (e.g. the study au-
thors do not reply to our request) or to combine them appropriately, we will conduct separate
analyses on the variables with different formats.

Unit of analysis issues

Cluster-randomised trials

We will include cluster-RCTs along with individual-RCTs in the analysis. We will assess cluster-RCTs
carefully (in terms of recruitment bias, baseline imbalance, loss of clusters and comparability with
individually RCTs) for potential unit-of-analysis errors. If it is unclear whether or not an included

study applied proper controls for clustering, we will contact the corresponding author for further
details. If the study does not use appropriate controls, we will request individual participant data
from the study authors and reanalyse the data using appropriate multilevel models. We will per-
form the analyses according to the approach described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We will analyse effect sizes and standard errors using the
generic inverse method in RevMan 5 (ReMan 2014). To adjust for clustering (reducing the size of ef-
fect of each clustered trial to its 'effective sample size'), we will use an estimate of the intracluster
correlation coefficient (ICC) extracted from the trial, as described in Higgins 2011. Where we can de-
rive ICCs from other sources, we will state this clearly in the Results section and we will conduct a
sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of variation in the ICC (see 'Sensitivity analysis' section
below).

Studies with multiple intervention arms

If a single included trial reports multiple intervention arms, we will only include the relevant arms.
If more than one intervention arm is relevant to our review, we will first estimate if they are suf-
ficiently similar to be combined. For instance, arms with the same intervention but different fre-
quency of application, or arms with essentially the same intervention but with minor modifications
in each group, can be treated as a whole intervention group. If so, we will combine all eligible inter-
vention groups and compare them with the combined results of eligible control groups, thus mak-
ing single, pair-wise comparisons. Where two comparisons (e.g. intervention A versus control and
intervention B versus control) are required to be entered into the same meta-analysis separately,
we will halve the number of participants in the control group to avoid double counting the partici-
pants.

For studies with missing data due to loss of follow-up/attrition, we will conduct analyses using the
intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. We will impute the outcomes for the missing participants using
both a 'best-case' and 'worst case' scenario for dichotomous data. In the case that the missing da-
ta are continuous variables (i.e. no mean or standard deviation (SD) reported), we will attempt to
calculate them using the standard errors, confidence intervals (CI) and t values, according to the
methods described in Higgins 2011. If we are unable to retrieve or derive the missing data, we will
describe the missing data for each trial included in the review in the 'Risk of bias' tables (beneath
the 'Characteristics of included studies' tables); and if the proportion is large (greater than 20%),
we will consider downgrading the quality level of the body of evidence. We will discuss the extent
to which missing data can affect the results and mention it in the Authors' conclusions section.
We will conduct a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of
missing data in the overall assessment of effect (see 'Sensitivity analysis' section below), using the
strategy described in Deeks 2017.

Dealing with missing data

Assessment of heterogeneity We will perform tests for heterogeneity using the Chi2 test, to assess whether observed differences
in results are compatible with chance alone. Furthermore, we will use the I2 statistic to quantify in-
consistency across studies. We will define the presence of heterogeneity by a P value of less than
0.10 from the Chi2 test and an I2 statistic value of greater than 50%, as described in Deeks 2017. We
are aware that, in the case of small sample size or few included studies, a non-significant result of
heterogeneity analyses must not be taken as evidence of no heterogeneity. We will explore pos-
sible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity (see 'Sub-
group analysis and investigation of heterogeneity' section below) and sensitivity analysis (see 'Sen-
sitivity analysis' section below).

Assessment of reporting bias Where we are able to pool outcome data from 10 trials or more, we will draw a funnel plot (inter-

vention effect estimate versus standard error of intervention effect estimate), to examine the possi-
bility of reporting bias. If we find funnel plot asymmetry, we will further investigate clinical hetero-
geneity of studies as a possible explanation. We will use the 'contour-enhanced' funnel plot (Peters
2008), to distinguish asymmetry due to publication bias from that due to other factors; asymmetry
is more likely caused by factors other than by publication bias when the supposed missing studies
are in areas of higher statistical significance.

Data synthesis

We will use RevMan 5 to pool all eligible trials that apply communication interventions on minimal-
ly verbal children compared to no intervention or usual treatment (ReMan 2014). In the primary
analyses, we will pool data from all types of interventions together. Given that we expected to find

Subgroup analysis and inves-
tigation of heterogeneity

substantial clinical heterogeneity — the included interventions will have been designed accord-
ing to different theories and approaches — we will pool the available data using a random-effects
model, weighted by the inverse of the variance estimate, as described in Deeks 2017. We will report
the estimate of the between-study variance in a random-effects meta-analysis (known as Tau2). We
will conduct separate analyses for different types of interventions using subgroup analyses (see
'Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity' section directly below).

We will use the approach developed by Borenstein 2008, to formally investigate differences be-
tween two or more subgroups. This method conducts a standard test for heterogeneity across sub-
group results rather than across individual study results, and has been implemented in RevMan
5 (ReMan 2014). If we identify a small number of studies or small sample sizes (or both), we will
use caution when we interpret the subgroup analyses and will discuss the limitations of the find-
ings (e.g. potential for confounding) to avoid over-interpretation of the results. For ethical reasons,
most intervention studies in the field of ASD do not conduct RCTs using a 'true' control group (i.e.
one group that receives an intervention and the other receives no intervention at all). Most studies
use a treatment as usual (TAU) control group. TAU means the children may be receiving a range of
interventions in the community (e.g. one session of speech pathology per week), but these inter-
ventions are not an intervention arm in the randomised controlled trial. We will discuss the limita-
tions of interpreting data when a study has used TAU control groups.

We will examine the following data presented in the included studies by conducting subgroup
analyses.

1. Age: preschool (aged under five years with more than two years mental age) versus school-aged

children (aged 6 to 12 years with more than 2 years mental age)

2. Baseline language capability: children with ASD who have different language levels at baseline
(totally non-verbal versus 1 to 10 functional words; non-verbal versus 10 to 20 functional words)
3. Type of intervention: verbally based interventions, AAC interventions, combined interventions,

comprehensive interventions with a communication focus

4. Duration of intervention: number of weeks
5. Dose of intervention: number of hours per week

Sensitivity analysis

We will perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of each of the following on the effect esti-
mate.

1. Performance of missing data imputation based on a 'best-case' or 'worst case' scenario assump-

tion of missing data

2. Exclusion of unpublished studies
3. Exclusion of studies at high risk or unclear risk of bias (related to randomisation, blinding or at-

trition)

4. Exclusion of studies with high levels of missing data
5. Fixed-effect model versus a random-effects model
6. Variations in the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) (where we have derived ICC's from other

sources)

AAC: augmentative and alternative communication interventions; ASD: autism spectrum disorder; RCT: randomised controlled trial; SMD:
standardised mean difference; TAU: treatment as usual.

(d = 1.51). No significant difference in ini-
tiating joint attention and requesting ges-
tures. No significant group difference in
receptive/expressive language baseline to
exit

Changes in symbolic play types predicted
improvement in receptive (b = 0.89, t (df

JASP + EMT + SGD intervention group (ver-
sus starting with JASP + EMT alone) had
greater TSCU at week 24 (P < 0.01). Aver-
age TSCU at week 24 for JASP + EMT + SGD
= 61.9 utterances (95% CI 52.8 to 71.0)
and JASP + EMT = 40.3 utterances (95%
CI 32.7 to 48.0). Approximately double
the rate of communicative utterance per
minute at baseline. Moderate-to-large ef-
fect size (0.62). JASP + EMT + SGD group
had greater TDWR (P = 0.04) and TCOM
(P < 0.01) at week 24. Small-to-moder-
ate effect sizes (0.29 for TDWR and 0.44
for TCOM). For all outcomes JASP + EMT +
SGD were superior at week 12 in adaptive
interventions. For adapted interventions
for slow responders, beginning with JASP
+ EMT and adding the SGD component
and intensifying the JASP + EMT + SGD in-
tervention led to greater TSCU (42.7, 95%
CI 33.2 to 52.3) than the intensifying JASP
+ EMT (39.6, 95% CI 28.5 to 50.7), but there
was no significant difference between the
groups. Overall response rate was 70% by
week 12 (77.7% in JASP + EMT + SGD ver-
sus 62.2% in JASP + EMT group), which
was not statistically significant. Approxi-
mately 6.5 children needed to be treated
initially with the JASP + EMT + SGD rather
than the JASP + EMT for 1 additional child
to respond by 12 weeks. Adding in the
SGD later for slow responders to JASP +
EMT alone was not as effective as having
the SGD at the beginning.

12 weeks (24
sessions × 1
h each) for
each group.
SGD was used
to model
speech 50%

cond phase:
parents were
included in

ond phase,

terventions:
intensity of

increased (3
h per week
for 12 weeks);
addition of
SGD to the

(1 h per week
for 12 weeks);
or intensi-

creased (3 h
per week for

to MCT group if
unable to mas-
ter the preinter-
vention motor
imitation skills
required for the
RMIA group.
This may have
biased find-
ings in favour of
RMIA group.

No significant differences between the
two intervention groups on any of the
outcomes at postintervention or main-
tenance assessments. On average, the
RMIA group produced significantly more
words and used more language in every-
day situations postintervention than be-
fore, and maintained these gains 3 to 6
months postintervention. Similar findings
for MCT group; however, significant im-
provement in VABS expressive language
scales was not seen. RMIA group: 5/10 met
Tager-Flusberg et al benchmark - VABS
EL age-equivalent of > 15 months, parent
report > 30 word on CDI, more than 7 dif-
ferent words types on CSBS play session,
expression of at least 2 different commu-
nicative intentions with words and 4 dif-
ferent consonants used in CV syllables.
All 5 children retained or exceeded these
gains at maintenance assessment.

MCT group: 5/12 met Tager-Flusberg et al
benchmark - VABS expressive age-equiva-
lent of > 15 months, parent report of > 20
words on CDI, more than 5 different word
types on CSBS play session, expression of
2 different communicative intentions in
words and 4 different consonants used in
CV syllables. All 5 children retained or ex-
ceeded these levels at maintenance as-
sessment. In a moderator analysis, chil-
dren with higher joint attention scores
pre-intervention improved more than chil-
dren with lower joint attention scores,
regardless of intervention group. Recep-
tive language age equivalent of around 18
months was an important cut point, with
those below 18 months more likely to do
better with RMIA, and those scoring above
18 months more likely to do better with
MCT.

Both groups made significant progress
with intervention in number of verbal
attempts (P < 0.001), number of correct
words (P = 0.04) and number of imitative
attempts (P = 0.02) following intervention.
The

MBCT group progressed significantly in
number of verbal attempts after weeks
1–4 and number of correct words after
weeks 1 and 3. The TSLT group progressed
significantly after weeks 4 and 5. No sig-
nificant differences in number of verbal
attempts or number of correct words be-
tween groups postintervention. A signif-
icant number of new words were heard
at home for the MBCT group (P = 0.04).
Children in the MBCT group had more im-
itative attempts (P = 0.03) relative to the
TSLT group.

For each measure, a main effect of time
indicated improvement in spoken lan-
guage, adaptive communication, and spo-
ken vocabulary. When collapsed across
conditions, gains on the measures from
pre- to postintervention to follow-up were
statistically significant. In many cases, ef-
fect sizes were quite large, especially for
vocabulary. There was no main effect of
intervention type found on any measure.
12/19 children in the PECS group reached
stage 6 PECS, 2 reached stage 5, 2 reached
stage 3, and 1 reached stage 2.

No control
group so hard
to know if mat-
uration or true

fects. No main-
tenance/fol-
low-up assess-
ment. A signif-
icant propor-
tion of children

Total number of
different child-
initiated spo-
ken words ob-
served dur-
ing the 40-min

examiner where
spoken com-
munication
measures (fre-
quency of non-
imitative spo-
ken acts and
number of dif-
ferent non-im-
itative words)
were collect-
ed. The free-
play measures
were repeated

There was a significant effect after con-
trolling for verbal imitation level (P <
0.05). Children in the sign-alone group
(mean 0.78 (SD 0.62)) used significantly
fewer spontaneous words than the other
3 groups (Scheffd's D = 0.39, P = 0.01). The
effects of speech alone (mean 1.25 (SD
0.67)), simultaneous presentation of sign
and speech (mean 1.01 (SD 0.78)) and al-
ternating presentation of sign and speech
(mean 0.97 (SD 0.64)) were not significant-
ly different to each other. Children with
higher verbal imitation scores used more
spontaneous words regardless of inter-
vention group. Verbal imitation ability and
vocabulary size predicted later sponta-
neous words in the sign alone group. Age
(P < 0.001), IQ (P < 0.01), and verbal imi-
tation level (P < 0.001) predicted use of
spontaneous words (P < 0.001) in the oth-
er 3 groups.

PECS was more effective than RPMT in
increasing the number of non-imitative
spoken communication acts (Cohen's d
= 1.15) and number of different non-imi-
tative words used (d = 1.12) postinterven-
tion. Moderate effect sizes. At 6 months
follow-up, the growth rate of the number
of different non-imitative words was faster
in the PECS than the RPMT group for chil-
dren who had relatively higher object ex-
ploration at baseline. Children with rela-
tively low object exploration at baseline
improved faster when in the RPMT group
than in the PECS group. Effects were not
maintained 6 months after the end of in-
tervention

Appendix 2. 'Risk of bias' criteria

Random sequence generation

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

1. Low risk of bias: the sequence generation process was truly random; for example, a random number table or computer random number

generator was used

2. High risk of bias: the sequence generation process was non-random; for example, allocation by judgement of the clinician or preference

of the participant

3. Unclear risk of bias: there was insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit a judgement of low or high

risk of bias

Allocation concealment

1. Low risk of bias: allocation of participants was done using central allocation or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes
2. High risk of bias: the allocation sequence was known to the investigators or participants
3. Unclear risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described

Blinding of participants and personnel

1. Low risk of bias: blinding of participants and key study personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that blinding was broken, or unlikely

a lack of blinding would influence the outcome (or both)

2. High risk of bias: blinding of participants and key study personnel was not done or was broken, and outcomes were likely to be influenced

by the lack of blinding

3. Unclear risk of bias: the term 'blinding' was mentioned but no details were given for who was blinded and how the blinding was ensured

to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias

Blinding of outcome assessment

1. Low risk of bias: the outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention received by the participants, or the outcome was unlikely to

be influenced by lack of blinding

2. High risk of bias: no blinding of outcome assessment was mentioned but measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding,

or blinding could have been broken

3. Unclear risk of bias: the term 'double-blinded' was mentioned but no details were given with regards to how the outcome assessors

were blinded to the intervention received by the participants

Incomplete outcome data

1. Low risk of bias: there were no missing outcome data, or the reasons for missing data were unlikely to be related to the true study

outcome, or the numbers and reasons were balanced across intervention groups

2. High risk of bias: there were missing outcome data and the reasons were likely to be related to the true study outcome with either

imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups

3. Unclear risk of bias: there was insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusion, or both, to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias

Selective outcome reporting

We assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting by checking study protocols, if available, and comparing the outcomes listed
in the protocol with the published study report.

1. Low risk of bias: it is clear that all of the study's prespecified and expected outcomes of interest were reported in the prespecified way
2. High risk of bias: not all the study's prespecified outcomes were reported, or one or more primary outcomes were reported in a way
that was not prespecified, or one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified, or one or more outcomes of interest in the
review were reported incompletely so that they could not be entered in a meta-analysis, or the study failed to include the results of a
key outcome that was expected to have been reported

3. Unclear risk of bias: there was insufficient information to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias

Other bias

1. Low risk of bias: the study appeared to be free of other sources of bias
2. High risk of bias: there was at least one problem in the study that could put it at risk of bias; for example, the study was claimed to be

fraudulent, or there was extreme baseline imbalance

3. Unclear risk of bias: there was a lack of information to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias

Amanda  Brignell  (AB)  has  completed  a  systematic  review  on  language  outcomes  for  ASD  and  has  conducted  two  studies  looking  at
communication trajectories in children with ASD. Her publications have not included children with ASD who are minimally verbal.
Karen Chenausky (KC) has published papers on children with ASD who are minimally verbal. KC did not assess the eligibility, extract data
or assess the risk of bias or the quality of the evidence for any of the studies she contributed to, where they appeared in the searches for
this review.
Huan Song - none known.
JianWei Zhu - none known.
Chen Suo - none known.
Anagela Tamsin Morgan (AM) receives royalties for books that she has edited on Dysphagia Post Trauma and Case Study Interventions in
Child Speech Impairment, neither of which are specific to communication in autism.

1. Authorship

a. Amanda Brignell now works for Murdoch Children's Research Institute.
b. Huan Song now works for the University of Iceland.
c. DongHao Lu was an author on the protocol (Brignell 2016), but not the review.

2. Types of participants

a. We reduced the minimum non-verbal mental age from at least 24 months to at least 12 months. This was based on clinical reasoning,
previous studies, and experts in minimally verbal children with ASD who had used 12 months as the non-verbal mental-age cut-off
point (e.g. Paul 2013).

3. Types of outcome measures

a. We added 'combined spoken and non-verbal communication/AAC' as an outcome because some studies do not collect or report on
spoken and non-verbal outcomes separately. For example, one of the outcomes measured in one study, Howlin 2007, was 'frequency
of initiations', and this could include both spoken or non-verbal initiations.

4. Measures of treatment effect

a. We  added  information  on  how  we  would  present  ordinal  outcomes  in  the  'Summary  of  findings'  tables.  We  had  not  previously

described the methods for dealing with ordinal data, so it was necessary to explain this.

b. We also present the OR rather than the RR in the review, as we were not able to extract the RR from the data presented in the trial

report.

5. Electronic searches

a. We searched two additional Ovid MEDLINE segments which are updated daily: MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations,
and MEDLINE EPub Ahead of Print. We also searched Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect (DARE), and the ISRCTN Registry.

6. We report methods that we had planned in our protocol, Brignell 2016, but did not use in the review in Table 1.
