Introduction

Abstract

This article presents current diagnostic conceptualisations of eating disorders, including
new disorders such as binge eating disorder (BED) and avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder (ARFID). This is followed by contemporary ﬁndings in the epidemiology of eat-
ing disorders, their broad sociodemographic distribution and the increases in community
prevalence. Advances and the current status of evidence-based treatment and outcomes
for the main eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and BED are discussed
with focus on ﬁrst-line psychological therapies. Deﬁcits in knowledge and directions for
further research are highlighted, particularly with regard to treatments for BED and
ARFID, how to improve treatment engagement and the management of osteopenia.

The conceptualisation of eating disorders has expanded
rapidly in the last 10 years to include binge eating disor-
der (BED) and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
(ARFID) in addition to anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa. These are now recognised as
four well-
conceptualised disorders, which have been reclassiﬁed as
Feeding and Eating Disorders (FEDs) in the 5th revision
of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) published
in 2013 and in the 11th revision of the World Health
Organisation’s International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Dis-
eases and Related Health Problems published in 2019.1,2 The
common key diagnostic features of the main disorders of
both schemes are shown in Table 1. The vast majority of
research and clinical understanding is with anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa and BED, and thus this paper
will focus on these.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are eating dis-
orders characterised by the internalisation of the thin
ideal and extreme weight-control behaviours. In both,
overvaluation of weight and shape – where such body
image concern is of major or paramount importance to
self-view – is a mandatory criterion. Anorexia nervosa
is distinct as a condition of self-starvation, where people
are underweight and engaged in behaviours to prevent
weight gain. It includes people who do and do not
binge eat or purge (induce vomiting or laxative/diuretic
misuse). People with bulimia nervosa are not under-
weight, and are in a cycle of binge eating and purging
and/or fasting/compulsive exercise. In contrast, BED
and ARFID are the ﬁrst FEDs that do not have body
image concerns as core diagnostic criteria. They are dis-
tinguished by being disorders of eating behaviours, the
former of recurrent binge eating without regular purg-
ing and the latter of avoidance and aversion to food
and eating. All eating disorders occur across the age
spectrum although anorexia nervosa and ARFID more
commonly present in childhood and adolescence years,
whereas bulimia nervosa and BED are uncommon in
paediatric populations.

Advances in diagnosis and
classiﬁcation

The changes to diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa
in DSM-5 and ICD-11 are subtle but
important.

amenorrhea and osteopenia still occur, the former is no
longer a mandatory criterion to diagnose anorexia owing
to its frequent lack of applicability, for example in men
and women who are taking hormonal contraception. In
DSM-5, there are also severity criteria based on body
mass index (BMI; kg/m2) levels or their equivalent in
children but no upper BMI, and whether a person is
underweight
(needed for a diagnosis of anorexia
nervosa) is a clinical judgement. People with a BMI in
the normal range but who otherwise resemble those
with anorexia nervosa may be given the DSM-5 diagno-
sis of Atypical Anorexia Nervosa – a type of Other Speci-
ﬁed Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED).

Another change to anorexia nervosa in both schemes
is to no longer require the person to report a ‘fear of fat-
ness’ or weight gain – regarded often as a culturally spe-
ciﬁc phenomenon. However,
this is not reported,
evidence of weight prevention/loss behaviours
is
required to conﬁrm a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.
Overvaluation and other body image concerns may
occur in people with BED but are proscribed for individ-
uals with ARFID in both schemes.

if

Bulimia nervosa has changed little, but the criteria
have broadened, and binge eating (overeating on con-
textually large amounts of food over which the person
has lost control of eating) with compensatory weight loss
behaviours may now occur as little as once a week, but
this must be for 3 months in DSM-5 or 1 month in ICD-
11. Similarly, a minimum frequency of weekly binge
eating over several months is required for a diagnosis of
BED in both schemes. However, although overvaluation
is not required in either scheme, marked distress associ-
ated with binge eating is mandatory for BED. In the
DSM-5, 3/5 additional features associated with binge
eating are also required for BED. These additional fea-
tures are: (i) eating rapidly than normal; (ii) eating when

not hungry;
(iii) eating until uncomfortably full;
(iv) eating alone; and (v) negative emotions of depres-
sion, guilt or disgust following overeating.1 Both bulimia
nervosa and BED occur evenly across the weight spec-
trum, from normal to above normal bodyweights. In
clinical settings, the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa is com-
monly made in the context of purging behaviours such
as self-induced vomiting and laxative misuse for weight
control. However, people with bulimia nervosa can also
present without purging, but with extreme dietary
restriction/fasting and/or driven exercise regimens. This
non-purging form of bulimia nervosa is more common
in the community3 and may differ from BED only in the
manifestation of regular compensatory behaviours. ICD-
11 differs from DSM-5 with regard to deﬁning BED, in
neither requiring the amount of food consumed in a
binge to be unusually large – that is subjective binge epi-
sodes are included – nor requiring the 3/5 additional fea-
tures of binge eating.2 These broader criteria are likely to
increase the clinical utility of the ICD scheme compared
with DSM and are in line with the lived experience of
BED, whereby it is the loss of control and perception of
overeating that is the distressing quality of the binge epi-
sode, much more so than the amount of food eaten.

People with eating disorders that do not meet the
behavioural frequency or other criteria of one of the
main eating disorders and whose problems are less well
conceptualised, previously termed as Eating Disorder
Not Otherwise Speciﬁed, may be now classiﬁed as
OSFED or Unspeciﬁed FED (UFED) in the DSM-5,1 or as
the poorly speciﬁed Other Feeding or Eating Disorder in
ICD-11.2 OSFED includes atypical anorexia nervosa, sub-
threshold bulimia nervosa and BED, purging disorder
and night eating syndrome.

Atypical anorexia nervosa, that is anorexia nervosa
where BMI may be in the ‘adequate’ range of 20–25

kg/m2 or higher, is probably becoming more common as
the mean weight of the general population shifts to the
right. Management is similar to anorexia nervosa. Night
eating syndrome often presents in the context of sleep
disturbance. It is similar to BED in assessment and man-
agement. Purging disorder (without regular binge eat-
ing) is not very common, and its management is similar
to that for bulimia nervosa.

Although evidence is limited, the addition of these
previously unrecognised eating disorders, such as BED
and ARFID, has implications for clinicians, jurisdictions
and more broadly public health. Prevention initiatives,
clinician awareness and health service infrastructure
may need to be expanded to ensure adequate identiﬁca-
tion and management of the now diverse spectrum of
eating disorders.

Epidemiology including distribution
and determinants

A systematic review reported weighted population means
(and ranges) of lifetime prevalence as: (i) anorexia nervosa
1.4% (0.1–3.6%) for women and 0.2% (0–0.3%) for men,
(ii) bulimia nervosa 1.9% (0.3–4.6%) for women and
0.6% (0.1–1.3%) for men and (iii) BED 2.8% (0.6–5.8%)
for women and 1.0% (0.3–2.0%) for men.4 There are few
studies on the general population prevalence of DSM-5 eat-
ing disorders. An Australian adult general population study
included cases of OSFED and ARFID.3 It found a 3-month
prevalence of bulimia nervosa (1.2%) and BED (1.5%)
respectively. (Note that the study did not, however, apply
the DSM-5 3/5 binge eating speciﬁers.) The study also
examined ARFID and OSFED and found a prevalence of
0.3% and 3.2% respectively. The majority of OSFED had
atypical anorexia nervosa.3 Many people (around 10%)
reported weekly binge eating but without marked distress,
these were placed in UFED – however, this group did not
have high levels of health impairment, casting some doubt
on the clinical signiﬁcance of this group.3

The true community incidence of eating disorders is
unknown. However, cohort and clinical incidence studies
suggest a community-wide increase in bulimia nervosa
and in BED.

Increases in anorexia nervosa also have occurred and
are greatest in young women.5,6 All three main disorders
are also associated with moderate to high levels of psy-
chosocial and work impairment.3,6

The prevalence of eating disorders is higher in women
and in young people. However, BED is more common in
men. All problems may be more prevalent across socio-
economic groups and in First Australians than previously
thought.7 Risk minimisation may be achieved with
improved media literacy, reduced thin idealisation and

promoting a positive/healthy relationship with weight
and eating.8 Bulimia nervosa and BED shared inter-
secting risk factors for overweight/obesity (e.g. a child
history of trauma). Therefore, weight loss management,
if required, is best in a supervised environment where
care can be taken to address and prevent emergence of
eating disorders and other psychological co-morbidities.9

Management of eating disorders –
overview

For all eating disorders (including ARFID), the main
treatment as delineated in the current national and
international guidelines is a form of psycho-behavioural
therapy which can most usually be provided on an out-
patient basis.9–11 People with more severe symptoms, or
who are not improving with less restrictive care may be
treated in a partial (day) or full hospital specialist pro-
gramme.11,12 Evidence-based therapies delivered by an
eating disorders-informed clinician are considered most
efﬁcacious, and are preferred by people with eating dis-
orders.12 This approach may also be more cost-effective
and reduce hospitalisations.12

In addition to speciﬁc psychological therapy, treatment
needs to address important nutritional, physical and
mental health co-morbidities and thus is ideally from a
multi-disciplinary team. These teams at a minimum
would comprise a psychological therapist and a family
doctor. In more complex cases of eating disorders, such
as most people with anorexia nervosa, more severe cases
of bulimia nervosa and BED, and those requiring hospi-
tal
are
required. These include a registered dietitian, specialist
physician/paediatrician, psychiatrist, nurse(s), an exer-
cise therapist, activity/occupational therapist and social
worker or family therapist.9–11

Psychological therapies

Speciﬁc psychological therapies like the trans-diagnostic
Cognitive Behaviour Therapy – Enhanced (CBT-E) are
the ﬁrst-line treatment for all eating disorders with the
greatest impact on symptom reduction and other out-
comes.13 This is usually delivered in 20 weekly sessions
for bulimia nervosa and BED and in 40 sessions for
anorexia nervosa.

Briefer forms (e.g. 10 sessions of online guided self-
help CBT) as a ﬁrst step in care or for people with less
severe illness have been developed.9 These have a mod-
erate evidence base, comparable to CBT delivered by an
eating disorder informed therapist, but many people
continue to be symptomatic and require further ses-
sions. ‘Pure’ self-help, where there is no guidance, is

not recommended except as a ﬁrst step while waiting
for care.

The most major recent advances in treatments for
eating disorders have come from psychological therapy
trials of child/adolescent and adults with anorexia
nervosa supported by several systematic reviews and
network and other meta-analyses.14 In children and
adolescents, an atheoretical
family-based treatment
(FBT) is the leading modality of care. FBT may be deliv-
ered in whole family as well as separated family (where
the parents are seen apart from the child).15 Family
therapy has also been adapted for bulimia nervosa.9 An
alternative, but with a weaker evidence base to FBT, is
a form of CBT-E that has been modiﬁed to have addi-
tional brief family sessions.16 Similarly, adolescent focal
psychotherapy can be used for younger people with
anorexia nervosa.9

Although there is no similar leading therapy for
adults with anorexia nervosa, CBT is the most com-
monly practised therapy in Australia. Other evidence-
based psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa are
the Maudsley Anorexia Nervosa Therapy for Adults
(MANTRA),17 Specialist Supportive Clinical Manage-
ment (SSCM)18 and Focal Psychodynamic Therapy
(FPT).19 Table 2 summarises the key elements of the
main evidence-based therapies for adults and a good
description of all psychological therapies is found in the
NICE guidelines.10 All
therapies provide psycho-
education and aim to restore the person’s physical
health with weight monitoring, nutritional counselling
and meal planning, often alongside sessions from a reg-
istered dietitian. They were developed for individual
outpatient care over 8 months or longer. CBT has been
adapted for delivery in group settings, which is usual in
hospital programmes. All have manuals to provide

Current approach to eating disorders

guidance for therapies and which are used in training.
In Australia, the most accessible training is for CBT,
followed by SSCM and MANTRA. All have moderate
levels of attrition.

Pharmacological therapies

In contrast to psychological care, there have been fewer
advances in pharmacological
treatments for anorexia
nervosa. There are several small trials now of second-
generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine for anorexia
nervosa with mixed results.11 A recent large (n = 152)
16-weeks outpatient placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine
(mean dose 7.77 mg/day) as a primary treatment for
adults with anorexia nervosa found a moderate effect size
on weight gain favouring the active drug.20 However, the
rate of weight gain was very small (approximately 0.7
kg/month) and negligible with placebo. There were no other
signiﬁcant differences on primary outcomes and only one
secondary outcome difference for shape concerns favouring
the placebo arm. Importantly, there were no differences on
metabolic outcomes. Other psychotropic agents, such as
antidepressants, have little direct role or evidence for treat-
ment in anorexia nervosa, but antidepressants may be used
where there is co-morbid major depression.14

There are several trials supporting agents for the
treatment of BED and bulimia nervosa. Since the early
trials of higher dose-selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (e.g. ﬂuoxetine 60 mg daily), there has been a
small number of trials of topiramate and (for BED)
lisdexamfetamine.11,21 Meta-analyses support a role for
the second-generation antidepressants and lisdexam-
fetamine but not as standalone treatments as effect sizes
are small to medium and attrition may be higher than with

psychological therapies.21 Most use in Australia is also ‘off
label’, with the exception of lisdexamfetamine which is
approved for BED that is moderate to severe and under
specialist psychiatrist management. The longer term safety
of lisdexamfetamine is considered commensurate with that
found for its use in attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder.

Refeeding and osteopenia

The risks of refeeding too quickly and the refeeding syn-
drome are now well-recognised, but programmes may
have become overcautious. Research supports optimising
hospital care to allow more rapid weight regain protocols
and more assertive refeeding protocols have been dem-
onstrated to be safe when combined with assertive medi-
cal monitoring and nutritional supplementation of, for
example phosphate.22 However, such regimens need to
monitor psychological distress as this may be higher with
more rapid weight gain.

Osteopenia in people with sustained periods of low
weight and sex steroid suppression continues to be a
known medical risk for which treatment remains an
‘unmet critical need’ (Schorr et al., p. 78).23 Bone loss may
be irreversible, especially if this occurs during the critical
growth period of post-pubertal bone accretion. People with
anorexia nervosa thus may not reach their peak bone mass
and hence later in life more quickly reach osteopenic levels,
especially women in their post-menopausal years. Thus,
there is both increased risk of fracture in youth as well as
older age. Management relies on weight restoration and
normalisation of endocrine homeostasis. There is a small
number of trials of anti-resorptive and anabolic agents.
There has been one positive trial of transdermal oestrogen
physiological replacement and teriparatide respectively.
Studies into raloxifene, denosumab and other parathyroid
hormone analogues, such as abaloparatide, are lacking or
are limited to case reports. Most success has been reported
for bisphosphonates. However, safety concerns and poten-
tial teratogenicity caution against the use of bisphophonates
in young women.23

Outcomes and prognosis

Research supports cautious optimism for recovery from
an eating disorder, albeit it may be slow. A recent, large
22-year follow-up study of 228 women with anorexia

nervosa or bulimia nervosa treated in a specialist centre
found the majority (around two-thirds) recovered, and
that most with bulimia nervosa achieved this within
9 years, but only about half of
those with anorexia
nervosa achieved recovery within 9 years.24 This is consis-
tent with the body of outcome literature.6 Less is known
about long-term outcomes for BED and other eating dis-
orders, but treatment is important as spontaneous remis-
sion appears to be low and early symptom change is the
best predictor of outcome across all eating disorders.25

A meta-analysis has reported the presence of binge
eating and purging behaviours, lower BMI, early stage of
change (low motivation), concurrent depressed mood
and other co-morbidities, higher body image concerns
and poorer quality of current relationships to be consis-
tently associated with poorer treatment outcomes both
in the medium to longer term across all eating disorders.
Attrition was also associated with binge eating and purg-
ing behaviours and low motivation to change. However,
effect sizes varied highly across studies and were small to
moderate indicating many people recover despite having
negative prognostic features.25

A major challenge in improving treatment outcomes is
to close the ‘treatment gap’. A majority of people with
anorexia nervosa and a large majority with bulimia
nervosa and BED delay seeking care for a decade or lon-
ger.10 Many factors contribute to this problem, but
important issues are low levels of health literacy, help-
seeking for weight loss management rather than the eat-
ing disorder, stigma, shame and poor affordability and
access to evidence-based psychological therapies.

Conclusion

Eating disorders are common in Australians and may be
increasing. Effective psychological therapies are the ﬁrst-line
in care and most people recover in the medium to longer
term. Hospital care can be life-saving and efﬁcient access to
care is important – the major challenge is the wide treatment
gap and delays. Few pharmacologic agents are helpful in the
management of bulimia nervosa and BED. Further research
is needed particularly in the management of osteopenia,
achieving earlier
treatment engagement, an improved
understanding of which therapies work best for whom,
prognostic factors and outcomes. Research is urgently
needed for the newer eating disorders, BED and ARFID.
