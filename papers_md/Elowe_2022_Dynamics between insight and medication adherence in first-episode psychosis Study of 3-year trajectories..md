Abstract

Background. While specialized early intervention programs represent the gold standard in
terms of optimal management of first-episode psychosis (FEP), poor medication adherence
remains a predominant unmet need in the treatment of psychosis. In this regard, an interaction
between insight and adherence in FEP patients has been hypothesized but has been challenged
by multiple pitfalls.
Methods. Latent profile analysis and trajectory modeling techniques were used to evaluate
insight and adherence of 331 FEP patients engaged at the beginning, middle, and end of a 3-year
specialized early psychosis program. A Bayesian model comparison approach was used to
compare scores of clinical, functional, and socioeconomic outcomes at the end point of the study.
Results. Nearly one-third of the patients maintain a high level of insight and adherence during
the entire program. At the end of the 3-year follow-up, more than three-quarters of patients are
considered adherent to their medication. Patients with low levels of insight and adherence at the
beginning of the program improve first in terms of adherence and then of insight. Furthermore,
patients with high levels of insight and adherence are most likely to reach functional recovery
and to experience an increase in environmental quality of life.
Conclusions. Latent FEP subpopulations can be identified based on insight and adherence.
Medication adherence was the first variable to improve, but a gain in insight possibly plays a role
in the reinforcement of adherence.

Introduction

It is widely accepted that the onset of a first-episode psychosis (FEP) requires rapid
identification of symptoms and early management consisting of appropriate antipsychotic
treatment and personalized psychosocial and psychoeducational
interventions [1]. Such
specialized interventions intend to maximize clinical and functional prognostic outcomes
of patients during the critical period, that is, the first 2–5 years after the onset of psychosis
[2]. If reducing the duration of untreated psychosis is a priority goal, medication adherence
also plays a major role and remains one of the most important factors associated with
symptomatic remission [3]. Indeed, nonadherence to medication in the treatment of
schizophrenia can have a negative impact at the clinical level, with more frequent relapses,
later remissions, the development of symptoms more resistant to treatment, a lower level of
functioning, a lower quality of life and higher suicide rates, as well as at the socioeconomic
level, with higher costs to the healthcare system [4–9]. Similar findings are seen in FEP
studies [10–16]. Many factors implicated in poor medication adherence in FEP have been
described elsewhere, including patient-related, environment-related, medication-related, and
illness-related factors [17].

While the concept of compliance to treatment has gradually been replaced, implying the
patient’s passive attitude toward his treatment, adherence to treatment refers to a more active
implication of the patient [18]. In this respect, nonadherence is considered when only some or
none of the prescribed antipsychotic medication is taken. In patients with schizophrenia, the
mean rate of medication nonadherence approximates 50% [7] and tends to increase after hospital
discharge: nearly 25% within 7–10 days, 50% 1 year later, and up to 75% within 2 years [19, 20]. In
FEP patients, rates of medication nonadherence can also reach high levels, that is, 30–40%
6 months after the onset of the episode and 50% at 1-year follow-up [21, 22]. In this respect, the

2

implementation of specialized early intervention programs has a
direct positive effect on the rate of nonadherence, usually between
15 and 20% in the first 2 years of follow-up [23, 24].

Some authors have suggested a possible interaction between
insight and treatment adherence in FEP patients [25, 26]. Clinical
insight usually comprises three dimensions: awareness of the illness
and symptoms, the need for treatment, and understanding the
psychosocial difficulties attributed to the illness [27]. Poor clinical
insight into psychosis has been repeatedly identified as a major
factor associated with treatment nonadherence [7, 28–31], both at
the onset of the psychotic episode and after 1 year of follow-up [21,
32]. The level of insight thus seems to be a good predictor of
antipsychotic medication adherence, level of functioning, and glo-
bal clinical outcome at 1-year follow-up [25]. However, not all
studies reach this conclusion [33]. These contradictory results
may be partly explained by the cross-sectional or longitudinal
nature of the study design. While cross-sectional studies generally
find a positive correlation between good insight and better medi-
cation adherence [34, 35], longitudinal studies reach contrasting
conclusions: no association between the two [36, 37] or a correl-
ation only in the need for treatment [38].

One possible explanation of this discrepancy could be the com-
plexity of conceptualizing insight given its dynamic features
[26]. Moreover, the variability of the assessment’s methods of both
insight and medication adherence does not allow a standardization
of the results [19]. Finally, based on the existing literature, psychi-
atrists are faced with the chicken or the egg causality dilemma: Are
adherent patients more likely to increase their insight during
follow-up or does a high level of insight at baseline allow for good
adherence? This issue remains largely unanswered.

In this study, we comprehensively and prospectively explored the
association between dynamic change in insight and change in medi-
cation adherence in FEP patients engaged in a 3-year specialized early
psychosis program in order to fathom the potential interlacing
between these two constructs in time. We addressed the following
questions: (a) Is it possible to identify subpopulations within a popu-
lation of FEP patients based on the two variables of insight and
medication adherence? (b) If so, what trajectories do these subpopula-
tions follow over the 3 years of follow-up? (c) How do these different
subpopulations differ regarding certain clinical, functional, and socio-
economic outcomes at the end of the 3-year program?

Methods

Study design

A specialized outpatient early psychosis program (Treatment and
early Intervention in Psychosis Program or TIPP) has been designed
and implemented at the Department of Psychiatry in Lausanne
University Hospital, Switzerland in 2004 [39], consisting of a
3-year individual treatment by a psychiatrist and a case manager.
The TIPP program favors a bio-psycho-social perspective, and as
such provides treatment that includes psychotherapy, psychoeduca-
tion, family support and therapy, cognitive assessment and remedi-
ation,
supported employment, psychological
interventions for cannabis use, and pharmacological treatment. In
line with international guidelines, atypical antipsychotics are first-
line pharmacological treatment with a prospective monitoring of
any side effects [39]. Case managers meet patients frequently over
the treatment period, which provides the framework to establish a
trusting relationship, where extensive knowledge of patients’ history
can be gathered. At baseline, a specially designed questionnaire [40]
is completed by the case managers, and additional relevant

support,

social

information is eventually during follow-up. The main areas assessed
are sociodemographic elements, past medical and psychiatric his-
tory, insight into the illness, substance use, adherence to medication,
exposure to life events, and global functioning. Throughout the
program, follow-up assessments are made at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,
and 36 months, respectively. Symptomatology is assessed by trained
psychologists and psychiatrists within the same deadlines.

Participants

Patients are referred to the program by the hospital, general prac-
titioners, social professional networks, or families. Therefore, the
study sample is representative of the entire population of patients
with FEP who need specialized psychiatric treatment. Inclusion
criteria to the program are age between 18 and 35, residence in the
catchment area, and meeting criteria for psychosis according to the
“Psychosis threshold” subscale of the Comprehensive Assessment
of At Risk Mental State scale [41]. Participants who received
antipsychotic medication for a total duration of more than
6 months, or those with mental retardation (IQ < 70), or displaying
psychosis secondary to substance use or organic brain disorders are
referred to other treatment programs.

This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee of the Canton de Vaud (protocol #2020–00272) and com-
plied with the Declaration of Helsinki on medical protocol. All
parents were informed on study details and provided consent prior
to the inclusion. The data generated by the follow-up of all patients
were used in the study if they did not explicitly object to the use of
their data for research purposes. Only four patients refused their
clinical data to be used for research. Patients included in this study
started the program between January 2004 and March 2019.

Measurements

For each participant, insight was assessed at baseline and follow-up
by the same case manager using a Likert type scale [42]. Insight was
considered either absent (0), partial (1), or totally present (2). This
rating was substantially negatively correlated (ρ ranging between
(cid:1)0.547 and (cid:1)0.414) with the G12 PANSS item (lack of judgment
and insight) at all follow-up assessments, suggesting good conver-
gent validity [43, 44].

Information about medication adherence was collected from the
participants and their family. Patients taking their medication
between 75 and 100%, between 25 and 75%, and less than 25% of
the time are considered totally adherent (score 2), partially adherent
(score 1), and nonadherent to medication (score 0), respectively.

Outcomes

For the outcome measures, we considered scores at discharge, that
is, at 36 months follow-up, or 30 if not available. We used Andrea-
sen’s criteria (score ≤ 3) to determine symptomatic recovery which
is based on eight items of the PANSS (delusion, unusual thought
content, hallucinatory behavior, conceptual disorganization, man-
nerisms, blunted affect, social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity)
[45]. The general functional level was assessed with the Global
Assessment of Functioning (GAF) [46] that considers social and
occupational levels, and the impact of symptomatology. A GAF
score above 60 defined general functional recovery. The premorbid
functional level was assessed with the Premorbid Adjustment Scale
(PAS) [47]. A PAS score at or below the premorbid rating on four of
the five items of the general PAS defined functional recovery
[48]. Quality of life at discharge was assessed with the World Health

European Psychiatry

3

Organization Quality of Life scale [49]. This 5-point likert scale
measures satisfaction with life and self-esteem through 26 self-rated
items ranging from 1 (low satisfaction) to 5 (high satisfaction). The
assessment of independent living recovery (head of household/
living alone, with partner, or with peers/living with family with
minimal supervision) was carried out using the Modified Voca-
tional Status Index. The assessment of working recovery (paid or
unpaid full- or part-time employment/being an active student in
school or university/head of household with employed partner
(homemaker)/full or part-time volunteer) was carried out using
the Modified Location Code Index Independent living [50]. Insight
recovery was defined as full insight at discharge.

Statistical analysis

We first performed a latent profile analysis (LPA) for the beginning,
middle, and end of the program. We used insight and adherence
scores as indicators. To guarantee model statistical identification and
cope with data that could be missing from one assessment, each LPA
was estimated using adherence and insight scores of two neighboring
assessment (2 and 6 months, 18 and 24 months, and 30 and
36 months) with measurement invariance imposed across the two
insights, respectively, the two adherence indicators. The best solution
was determined using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
coefficient, which balances model fit and model complexity [51].

In a second step, we performed a latent transition analysis
(LTA). Given the meaning of the classes was very close between
each three LPAs, we also imposed longitudinal measurement
invariance in the LTA model. While reducing the total number of
model parameters, it also ensured the meaning of the classes would
stay the same between the beginning, middle, and the end of the
program, thus facilitating interpretation.

Finally, in order to compare scores from the different classes at
the end point of the study, we used a Bayesian model comparison
approach. This represents an alternative to the problem of multiple
comparisons and allows evaluating the support for the null hypoth-
esis [52–54]. The first model was the homogeneous model (1, 2,
3, 4), stating that the four groups did not differ and were issued from
the same distribution. It corresponds to the null hypothesis in the
classical statistical framework. Another model was the heteroge-
neous model: (1) (2) (3) (4) (i.e., all the groups were different from
each other and were issued from four different distributions). All
other possible combinations, which adds up to 15—for instance
(1, 2, 3), (4) or (1, 3), (2, 4)—were estimated. For continuous
variables, the best possible Gaussian model (μ, σ2) was determined
by using the BIC [51]. For nominal variables, the best multinomial
model was determined using the exact likelihood with a uniform
prior on all parameters [54]. An equal prior probability of 1/15 was
assumed for all models so that no model was favored. The Bayes
factor was also computed [55] and provided a comparison between
the best model and the homogenous model. A Bayes factor of
4 indicates that the best model was 4 times more likely to be true
than the homogenous model.

All statistical analyses were performed using the Mplus statis-
tical package, version 8.3, IBM SPSS, version 25, and the Bayes
R2STATS group models calculator [56].

Results

Eighty-eight patients for whom there was no indication for medi-
cation at some point during follow-up were excluded. The final
sample consisted of 331 patients (mean age = 24.5; SD = 4.53) and

included mainly males (67.4%). Among these, 62.5% met diagnos-
tic criteria for schizophrenia, 10.3% for schizoaffective disorder,
9.4% for schizophreniform or brief psychotic disorder, 6.6% for
bipolar disorder, 2.1% for depression with psychotic features, and
4.2% for other psychotic disorders. The mean duration of illness
was 1.04 years (SD = 2.40). The different LPA solutions are pre-
sented in Table 1. 22.0% of data was missing. The covariance
coverage ranged from 88.8 and 59.5% for any pair of variables,
which we deemed adequate. A three-class solution was chosen for
the first LPA (beginning of the program) based on its lowest BIC
and clinical interpretability. Adding an extra-class yielded a higher
BIC coefficient and resulted in an empty class. The first class
consisted of patients with high insight and high adherence, labeled
high in the tables. The second class consisted of patients with low
insight and low adherence, labeled low in the tables. The third class
consisted of patients with low insight and high adherence.

For the LPA performed at the middle of the program, BIC
indicated a four-class solution. It consisted of three classes similar
to those observed in the first LPA with the addition of a fourth class
with high insight and low adherence.

The LPA performed at the end of the program also suggested a

four-class solution with a very similar interpretation.

Finally, the LTA was estimated. The characteristics of the

four longitudinally invariant classes are represented in Figure 1.

Insight and adherence trajectories over the 3-year program are
presented in Table 2. Results suggest that about 31% of patients
display full insight and adherence throughout the program. At the
end, 57.4% of patients have high insight and high adherence.
Nevertheless, insight and adherence will remain low during the
entire 3-year follow-up in 10.6% of patients and 19.3% of the total
sample will end the program with low insight and low adherence.
Results indicate that high adherence with low insight is more
frequent than good insight with low adherence.

Transitions between the beginning, the middle, and the end of

the program are presented in Table 3.

Results of classes transitions between the beginning and the
middle of the program suggest that patients who start with high
insight and adherence tend to keep their insight and adherence
high. Patients with both poor insight and adherence tend to
improve first with adherence and only later regarding insight.
Patients who start with low insight and high adherence are likely
to gain insight or remain stable but keep a high level of adherence.
Transitions between the middle and the end of the program
suggest more stability between identical classes at different time
points. Patients starting in the high insight and adherence class and
worsening are more likely to lose complete adherence than insight.
Again, patients with low adherence and insight at the beginning of
treatment were likely to improve first regarding adherence and then
regarding insight.

Finally, transition between the beginning and the end of the
program confirms the stability of patients with high insight and
adherence throughout the 3 years (91.2%, n = 103). Interestingly,
56.8% of patients who start with low insight and adherence are
likely to improve, although a gain in adherence is more likely than a
gain in insight.

Comparison of outcomes between groups with varying levels of
insight and adherence at the end of the program is presented in
Table 4. Patients with high insight and adherence at the end of the
treatment are more likely to achieve functional recovery and better
environmental quality of life. Other dimensions of quality of life were
unaffected by insight and adherence. Patients with good insight but
poor adherence seemed to be most at risk in not recovering symp-
tomatically. Return to employment was particularly challenging for
the group with both poor insight and adherence. Independent living
was highest for patients with high insight regardless of adherence and
was worst for patients with low insight and high adherence. Premor-
bid adjustment recovery was more likely for patients with high
adherence and not related to insight, although this model was only
marginally more likely than the null hypothesis.

Discussion

In this study, our goal was (a) to identify subpopulations within a
population of FEP patients based on the two variables of insight and
medication adherence, (b) to describe what trajectories do these
subpopulations follow over the 3 years of follow-up, and (c) to
verify how do these different subpopulations differ regarding clin-
ical, functional, and socioeconomic outcomes at the end of the
3-year program. We made the following observations: First,
patients with low levels of insight and medication adherence at
the beginning of the program tend to improve during follow-up,
first in terms of adherence and then of insight. Second, nearly one-
third of the total sample of patients (31%) maintain a high level of
insight and adherence during the entire program and more than
half of them (57.4%) end the program following the same pattern.

Furthermore, over 76% of patients are considered adherent to their
medication at the end of the program. Third, more than 90% of
patients who display high levels of insight and adherence when
entering the program remain so over the 3-year follow-up. Fourth,
at the end of the follow-up, one patient out of five has a low level of
insight and adherence. Finally, patients with high levels of insight
and adherence are most likely to reach functional recovery and to
experience an increase in environmental quality of life.

Most cross-sectional studies conclude that a high level of insight
is correlated with adequate medication adherence [21, 34, 35]. In
order to better identify subpopulations of FEP patients who may
benefit from targeted therapeutic measures, the aim of this study
was to investigate prospectively the dynamics between insight and
adherence throughout a 3-year specialized early psychosis pro-
gram. Indeed it is now recognized that the level of insight is
correlated with several decisive clinical outcomes for FEP patients,
such as medication adherence [57] or global functioning [58].

The high rates of medication adherence reported in our study
provide additional support to the benefit of specialized early inter-
vention programs, when considering this is a critical component of
the management of FEP. Indeed, such programs usually involve
both an intensive treatment characterized by a collaborative and
recovery-centered approach and make the patient an active partner
in his therapeutic plan.

Medication adherence over the course of follow-up improved
whether or not patients displayed insight at baseline. This result is of
particular interest since poor adherence has been identified as one of
the predominant unmet needs in the treatment of schizophrenia
[59]. A recent systematic review of studies conducted in patients with
psychotic spectrum disorders pointed young age, poor illness insight,
cannabis use and positive symptomatology at baseline as risk factors
for medication nonadherence, while antipsychotic medication
adherence was associated with good illness insight and a positive
attitude toward medication from both the patient and the family, and
good illness insight were associated with satisfactory antipsychotic
medication adherence [60]. A comprehensive review conducted in
FEP patients found lack of insight among many other factors as a
significant predictor of nonadherence, supporting the implementa-
tion of early intervention programs [17]. Finally, a recent study
conducted in patients with schizophrenia explored the association
between insight, therapeutic alliance, and perceived trauma related to
psychiatric treatment [61, 62]. The results showed a positive correl-
ation between medication adherence and insight or therapeutic
alliance, while greater adherence was negatively correlated with
perceived trauma. The authors hypothesized that interventions
aimed at enhancing insight or reducing perceived trauma could
promote better medication adherence. In this respect, the intensive
and recovery centered treatment ideally provided by specialized early
intervention programs facilitates the development of a therapeutic
relationship [63].

Apart from strategies aimed at improving adherence to
medication such as the use of long-acting injectable (LAI) anti-
psychotics [64, 65], motivational interviews, web-based psychoe-
ducation, or SMS medication reminders [66], targeting insight
seems to be useful to enhance adherence through a synergic
process, which in turn improves outcome [67], particularly in
terms of functional recovery. Furthermore, our finding that gain
in adherence appears to occur earlier than improvement in
insight throughout the program is interesting. This suggests that
when the adjustment level at the end of follow-up reaches that of
the premorbid period, it seems to depend rather on adherence
and not on insight. It already has been shown that a strong
therapeutic alliance has a subsequent positive effect on medica-
tion adherence and outcome [63]. However, this does not call
into question the likely role of insight in enhancing medication
adherence. Indeed, the development of a relationship of trust and
respect between the patient and the clinician, which ultimately
leads to a strong therapeutic alliance, takes place over several
months or years for a certain category of patients. Insight could

thus take longer to emerge but could have a greater reinforcing
effect on medication adherence in the longer term. This hypoth-
esis is in line with previous studies that showed that patients with
high medication adherence see their level of insight increase over
the course of follow-up [25].

Despite the methodological strength of our 3-year prospective
study design, it faces a number of limitations. First, medication
adherence was evaluated using a subjective assessment by the case
manager, which relies on information from patients or relatives.
Nevertheless, this remains the most widely used method in the
literature [30, 68, 69]. Also, the rates of patients on LAI versus oral
antipsychotics respectively were not included in the statistical
models. Other factors that may have an impact on adherence were
not considered in our analysis, such as cognitive and metabolic
parameters, or unhealthy lifestyle, which are known to be affected
in psychosis. Insight was assessed using a simple three-point
Likert scale, possibly lacking precision. Nonetheless, other
Likert-scale type instruments have shown good convergent and
discriminant validity and reliability [70]. Inter-rater reliability

was not determined, in relation to possible change of insight over
time. Finally, patients’ attitudes toward medication were not
considered. In this respect, one cross-sectional study looked at
the impact of insight into illness and the global knowledge of
patients with schizophrenia about their ongoing medication on
their attitudes toward drug treatment [67]. The results concluded
that good insight is associated with more favorable attitudes
toward antipsychotic medication. In this regard, we assumed that
attitudes toward medication and medication adherence were
positively correlated.

In conclusion, this study adds support to the hypothesis that
it is possible to identify latent subpopulations within a population
of FEP patients based on the two variables of insight and
medication adherence, which evolve dynamically during
follow-up. We also have shown that adherence is the first variable
to improve but that a gain in insight in the longer term possibly
plays a role in the reinforcement of adherence. Finally, patients
with a high level of adherence and to a lesser extent insight are
those with the greatest chance of functional recovery. By showing
potential benefits of individual treatment through specialized
early intervention programs, these results reinforce the need for
their development and implementation in patients with psych-
osis, with a specific attention to therapeutic strategies targeting
medication adherence.
