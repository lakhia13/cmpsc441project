Abstract 
Background:  Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first‑line treatment for patients with panic disorder (PD) and agora‑
phobia (AG). Yet, many patients remain untreated due to limited treatment resources. Digital self‑guided short‑term 
treatment applications may help to overcome this issue. While some therapeutic applications are already supported 
by health insurance companies, data on their efficacy is limited. The current study investigates the effect of self‑
guided digital treatment comprising psychoeducation and virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET).

Methods:  Thirty patients diagnosed with PD, AG, or panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) will be randomly 
assigned to either the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). Participants of both groups will undergo 
baseline diagnostics in the first two sessions. The subsequent treatment for the EG consists of a self‑guided 6‑week 
phase of application‑based psychoeducation, one therapy session preparing for the VRET, and 4 weeks of application‑
based self‑guided VRET. To control for the potential effects of the therapy session with the therapist, the CG will 
receive relaxation and stress‑reduction training instead. All patients will then undergo a closing session which termi‑
nates with the post‑assessment (~ 10 weeks after baseline assessment) and a follow‑up assessment 6 weeks following 
the closing session. Symptom severity (primary outcome) will be assessed at baseline, interim, post‑treatment, and 
follow‑up. Additionally, remission status (secondary outcome) will be obtained at follow‑up. Both measures will be 
compared between the groups.

Discussion:  The current study aims at providing insights into the efficacy of short‑term treatment applications 
including psychoeducation and self‑guided VRET. If successful, this approach might be a feasible and promising way 
to ease the burden of PD, AG, and PDA on the public health system and contribute to a faster access to treatment.

Background
Anxiety  disorders  are  among  the  most  common  men-
tal  health  disorders  worldwide  and  are  associated  with 
immense  psychological  burdens  and  psychosocial 
impairment.  Among  those,  panic  disorder  (PD),  agora-
phobia (AG), and panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA)

make up for a great part of the diagnoses. The 12-month 
prevalence  of  PD,  AG,  and  PDA  across  EU  countries  is 
approximately  2%  [1].  However,  research  suggests  that 
underdiagnosis  in  both  disorders  is  common,  indicat-
ing that the true number of affected individuals might be 
considerably higher [1, 2].

Both  PD  and  AG  are  best  characterized  by  immense 
fear  that  oftentimes  leads  to  panic-like  attacks  [3]. 
According to the 10th edition of the International Statis-
tical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Prob-
lems  (ICD-10)  [4,  5],  patients  with  PD  suffer  from  the 
reoccurrence  of  sudden  and  unexpected  panic  attacks, 
during  which  they  experience  a  plethora  of  physiologi-
cal  symptoms  (i.e.,  racing  heartbeat,  dyspnea)  and  an 
acute fear of death. Patients with AG do not suffer from 
unexpected  panic  attacks  but  they  experience  panic-like 
fear reactions in inescapable situations or when access to 
help is limited [6]. PD and AG frequently overlap, result-
ing  in  the  classified  diagnosis  of  PDA  [7].  In  this  pat-
tern,  patients  not  only  experience  recurrent  unexpected 
panic  attacks,  but  also  avoid  places  and  situations  in 
which  panic  attacks  might  occur  [8].  Consequences  are 
among  other  things  social  isolation,  disability  to  work 
or  pursue  personal  interests,  and  an  increased  risk  for 
the  onset  of  comorbidities,  such  as  substance  use  disor-
der  or  depression  [1,  7].  A  core  pathogenic  mechanism 
of  all  three  disorders  is  persistent  avoidance  behavior, 
which is maintained by the momentary relief experienced 
upon  avoidance  of  and  flight  from  feared  situations  [9]. 
Subsequently,  activities are avoided  that  have  previously 
been associated with panic attacks or panic-related body 
symptoms,  such  as  doing  sports  or  drinking  coffee.  As 
the course of the disorder progresses, avoidance behavior 
often generalizes from single stimuli to broad domains of 
daily life [10, 11].

Aiming  at  resolving  the  dysfunctional  avoidance  pat-
terns,  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  interventions 
are  among  the  most  effective  treatment  options  for  PD, 
AG,  and  PDA  [12,  13].  Using  a  variety  of  interventions 
comprising  psychoeducation,  cognitive 
reappraisal, 
and  exposure,  patients  are  encouraged  to  reflect  on  and 
modify  behavioral  and  cognitive  patterns  involved  in 
the onset and maintenance of fear and panic attacks [8]. 
Especially  exposure  therapy  has  been  found  effective  in 
the  treatment  of  PD,  AG,  and  PDA  as  it  directly  tackles 
the  patients’  avoidance  behavior  [14].  For  AG,  exposure 
therapy  consists  of  encountering  anxiety-evoking  situa-
tions,  such  as  going  on  a  bus  or  to  the  shopping  center 
[14]. On the other side, during exposure therapy for PD, 
fear  reactions  are  provoked  by  evoking  somatic  symp-
toms typically experienced throughout a panic attack, for 
instance  by  running  on  a  treadmill  or  shaking  the  head 
in  order  to  help  the  patient  re-evaluate  the  experienced 

symptoms  as  non-threatening.  This  practice  is  also 
referred  to  as  interoceptive  exposure  [15].  Despite  its 
proven efficiency, a considerable part of patients cannot 
access  exposure  therapy,  because  treatment  capacities 
are  limited  [16].  Many  patients  are  left  behind  on  long 
waiting lists, implying immense direct and indirect costs 
for  both  the  person  in  need  and  society  [17–19].  Given 
the heavy consequences of untreated PD, AG, and PDA, 
there  is  a  pressing  urge  to  increase  the  accessibility  of 
psychotherapeutic support [7, 20, 21].

E-health  interventions  might  be  a  promising  tool  to 
overcome  this  barrier  of  limited  accessibility  [22].  In 
particular,  by  developing  smartphone  applications  that 
comprise  guided  self-aid,  public  health  companies  tried 
to  address  the  outstanding  shortage  of  therapy  spots 
[23, 24]. Multiple studies support this approach, as it not 
only  potentially  makes  mental  health  services  accessible 
for  an  extensive  bandwidth  of  people,  but  also  applies 
proven elements of traditional CBT treatment by provid-
ing psychoeducation and self-insight on a low threshold 
level  [25–27].  To  increase  the  applicability  of  E-health 
for PD, AG, and PDA, it is suggested that developers and 
researchers need to focus on the implementation of new 
mechanisms and elements such as virtual reality (VR) in 
digital treatment interventions [28].

It  has  been  shown  that  exposure  is  an  effective  treat-
ment  for  PD,  AG,  and  PDA  [29–31].  However,  due  to 
time and monetary constraints, exposure is rarely offered 
during treatment [32]. VR technology is a promising tool 
to  address  this  issue  [33,  34].  By  providing  the  possibil-
ity  to  encounter  fear-provoking  situations  or  sensations 
that are otherwise avoided while at the same time being 
in  a  safe  environment,  VR-based  exposure  therapy  can 
be carefully executed step by step, responding to the cli-
ent’s  progress.  As  well  as  in  vivo  exposure  therapy,  vir-
tual reality exposure therapy (VRET) differs between the 
disorders  AG  and  PD  [14].  For  AG,  virtual  fear-evoking 
situations  are  simulated,  in  which  the  patient  can  learn 
to overcome their fear. For PD (without agoraphobia), on 
the other hand, interoceptive exposure is realized outside 
the VR [15]. Especially for anxiety disorders like PD and 
AG,  VR  is  highly  efficacious  in  both  the  short-term  and 
long-term treatment settings [23, 35]. Also, in vivo expo-
sure  therapy  has  sometimes  been  the  target  of  criticism 
due to lower acceptance rates as compared to other treat-
ment approaches among patients [36]. VRET, in contrast, 
might  be  more  patient-friendly  than  in  vivo  exposure, 
because the degree of exposure can be adjusted [37].

To  this  point,  access  to  psychotherapy  was  often  hin-
dered  by  barriers  in  the  mental  health  care  system  [17]. 
E-health interventions bridging this gap have been found 
effective, yet still need adjustments to find their way into 
clinical  practice  for  the  treatment  of  PD,  AG,  and  PDA 

Planert et al. Trials          (2022) 23:426

more frequently. One way to address the aforementioned 
challenge is a multilayered approach that comprises psy-
chotherapeutic  supervision  in  combination  with  a  self-
guided  short-term  treatment  featuring  VR  elements. 
This  digital  short-term  treatment  option  for  PD,  AG, 
and  PDA  is  already  supported  by  major  health  insur-
ance companies that pay for the application as well as for 
the  associated  VR  equipment  [38].  This  is  a  commend-
able attempt to help patients by overcoming bureaucratic 
obstacles. Yet, research is lacking on the efficacy of self-
guided short-term treatments with VR elements. To close 
that  gap,  the  present  randomized  controlled  trial  will 
be  conducted  to  investigate  the  effects  of  a  self-guided 
short-term treatment on the psychological symptoms in 
patients affected by PD, AG, and PDA.

Trial design

The  current  study  illustrates  a  single-centered  rand-
omized controlled trial to investigate whether self-guided 
short-term  treatments  via  smartphone  applications  are 
a  viable  treatment  method  for  PD,  AG,  and  PDA.  Eligi-
ble  participants  will  be  randomly  assigned  to  either  the 
experimental  condition  (2  diagnostic  sessions  +  appli-
cation-based psychoeducation + therapy session + self-
guided  VR-treatment  +  closing  session)  or  the  control 
(2  diagnostic  sessions  +  therapy  session  +  closing  ses-
sion).  A  2  (condition:  treatment  vs.  active  control)  ×  4 
(time: baseline/interim/post-treatment/follow-up) mixed 
design will be applied. As this study aims at contributing 
to better care for patients without access to regular treat-
ment, we decided to include an active control group as a 
comparator,  which  controls  for  up  to  five  sporadic  con-
sultation-hour sessions with a therapist. First, we expect 
that  patients  in  the  experimental  condition  will  experi-
ence a significantly higher reduction of symptom severity 
than patients in the control condition during the interim, 
post-treatment,  and  follow-up  measures,  compared  to 
the baseline assessment. The secondary hypothesis is that 
at  follow-up,  significantly  fewer  patients  in  the  experi-
mental condition will meet the diagnostic criteria for PD, 
AG, and PDA, compared to the control condition.

To estimate the required sample size, an a priori power 
analysis  was  conducted  using  G*Power  3.1.9.7  [39].  The 
primary  hypothesis  is  tested  using  2  ×  4  mixed  design 
repeated  measures  analyses  of  variance  (ANOVA).  The 
required  total  sample  size  to  detect  a  moderate  effect 
for  a  repeated  measures  ANOVA  with  within-between 
interaction (effect size f = .25) is N = 24, given an α level 
of .05 and achieved power of 1−β = .80. The effect size 
was inferred from previously reported effect sizes in the 
literature  [23,  40,  41]. The  assumed  correlation  between 
the  repeated  measures  was  set  to  .5.  As  the  treatment 
includes digital treatment components, a drop-out rate of 

approximately  20%  is  expected,  based  on  prior  research 
[42]. Due to this expected attrition between the measure-
ments,  it  is  planned  to  include  30  patients,  resulting  in 
N = 15 per condition. The secondary hypothesis will be 
tested using the chi-square statistic.

Methods
Participants

Subjects  will  be  approached  via  flyers,  radio,  television, 
newspaper,  and  online  advertisements.  The  inclusion 
criteria  will  comprise  the  ICD-10  diagnostic  criteria  for 
agoraphobia,  unspecified  (F40.00),  agoraphobia  with 
panic  disorder  (F40.01),  agoraphobia  without  panic  dis-
order (F40.02), or panic disorder (F41.0) [5]. Additionally, 
participants need to be at least 18 years old to be eligible 
for taking part in this study. Based on contraindications 
as  defined  for  the  treatment  application,  the  exclusion 
criteria  will  include  the  following  conditions:  stroke  or 
myocardial infarction in patient history, angina pectoris, 
cardiac dysrhythmia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, pregnancy or assumed pregnancy, severely 
impaired  vision,  epilepsy,  or  other  cramp  attacks  in 
patient history, a psychological disorder with an organic 
origin, dizziness or vestibular impairment, a psychologi-
cal  disorder  due  to  the  use  of  psychoactive  substances, 
schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder, severe 
depression, acute suicidality, or missing agreement in the 
presence of suicidality [38].

Also, patients cannot be included if they already are in 
psychotherapeutic  or  psychopharmacological  treatment 
containing  the  use  of  tricyclic  antidepressants,  mono-
amine  oxidase  inhibitors,  selective  serotonin  reuptake 
inhibitors,  and  serotonin  and  norepinephrine  reuptake 
inhibitors. Patients that previously used benzodiazepines 
as an acute medication are instructed to not use them for 
the time of the trial, if possible.

Ethics statement

The present study was approved by the Ethical Commit-
tee  of  the  University  of  Siegen  (date  of  approval:  04-11-
2021, reference number ER_48_2021). The study protocol 
is in line with the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines 
for  Good  Clinical  Practice,  and  the  SPIRIT  reporting 
guidelines [43]. Before study inclusion, participants must 
provide written informed consent, which they can with-
draw at any time without any adverse consequences. All 
obtained data will be processed pseudonymously in order 
to  protect  the  confidentiality  agreement  before,  during, 
and after the trial.

Participation in the study brings some minor risks for 
the  patients,  about  which  they  will  be  informed  before 
entering  the  trial.  As  the  current  trial  partly  consists  of 
a  self-guided  intervention,  some  dangers  of  self-guided 

 Planert et al. Trials          (2022) 23:426

treatment need to be taken under careful consideration. 
One possible risk is that patients who do not benefit from 
the  treatment  may  be  less  receptive  to  further  psycho-
therapeutic  interventions  [44].  Another  potential  risk 
associated  with  the  use  of  VR  equipment  is  cybersick-
ness. The VR modules of the treatment application con-
sist of high-quality, short-term, pre-recorded 360° videos, 
which  do  not  include  fast  motions  or  changes  in  frame 
rate and in which the participant is not required to move 
around. Following previous research on conditions evok-
ing cybersickness, it should not be a concern for the cur-
rent  trial  [45,  46].  For  patients  in  the  control  condition, 
a  potential  risk  is  the  occurrence  of  relaxation-induced 
anxiety  or  panic  attacks  during  or  after  the  third  treat-
ment session [47]. To measure potential side effects asso-
ciated with the conduction of the study, patients will be 
asked about the occurrence of adverse events (e.g., cyber-
sickness,  relaxation-induced  panic  attacks)  and  whether 
these  were  associated  with  specific  treatment  elements 
during  the  fourth  psychotherapeutic  session  of  the  cor-
responding research condition.

During  the  digital  treatment,  suicidality  checks  are 
conducted  through  the  treatment  application.  In  case 
of  acute  suicidality  at  any  point  of  the  treatment,  the 
treating  therapist  will  be  notified  immediately,  and  then 
decides if the treatment will be discontinued if required. 
If  needed,  more  intensive  care  will  be  arranged  such  as 
the admission to an inpatient clinic.

Procedure

The  trial  will  take  approximately  17  weeks  for  each 
patient  to  complete  (see  Fig.  1  for  the  planned  patient 
contact  protocol).  After  being  informed  via  mail  about 
the study’s content, interested participants will engage in 
a  telephone  interview  to  determine  whether  they  fulfill 
the inclusion criteria. Following the screening, which will 
take  10–30  min,  patients  will  be  invited  to  the  psycho-
therapeutic outpatient center of the University of Siegen 
for the first session, during which their symptoms will be 
assessed  by  a  licensed  psychotherapist.  This  first  intake 
session is scheduled to take 50 min. If patients meet the 
requirements,  they  will  be  invited  for  a  second  100-min 
intake  session  for  baseline  diagnostics,  1  week  after  the 
first intake. After the second intake session, patients will 
be allocated to the research conditions. At this point, par-
ticipants in the experimental condition will receive access 
to  the  psychoeducational  part  of  the  treatment  applica-
tion. Six weeks later, the third session (150 min) will take 
place as a preparation session for the experimental group 
(EG),  while  the  control  group  (CG)  will  receive  relaxa-
tion  training  in  the  meantime.  Then,  patients  in  the  EG 
will work on their  own with the VRET  of the  treatment 
application  for  4  weeks.  After  the  intervention,  patients 

will  be  invited  for  a  closing  session,  which  is  scheduled 
to take 100 min. For both groups, the purpose of this ses-
sion  will  be  to  reflect  on  the  treatment  process  and  to 
consolidate  learned  behavior  in  the  context  of  the  daily 
lives of the patients and for relapse prevention. Follow-up 
diagnostics  will  be  performed  6  weeks  after  the  closing 
session.  At  this  point,  patients  in  the  control  condition 
will receive access to the digital training as well. Patients 
that  still  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  after  the  trial  will 
be informed and advised on further treatment possibili-
ties. If important modifications to the study protocol are 
needed,  relevant  parties  will  be  informed  by  the  corre-
sponding author.

Randomization and blinding

For  the  first  two  appointments  of  the  study  sched-
ule,  patients,  therapists  as  well  as  research  assistants 
involved in the data collection, preparation, and scoring 
will  be  blind  to  the  research  conditions.  After  the  sec-
ond  appointment,  patients  will  be  randomly  assigned  to 
either the EG or the CG with a ratio of 1:1. The therapist 
will then receive a sealed envelope disclosing the patient’s 
allocation.  The  allocation  scheme  was  generated  before 
study  initiation  using  R.4.1.4.  Research  assistants  will 
remain blind to the patients’ group allocations. Follow-up 
diagnostics will be conducted by a licensed therapist who 
has not seen the patient beforehand and who will thus be 
blind  to  the  treatment  condition  of  this  certain  patient. 
However, complete blinding cannot be realized for thera-
pists  and  patients  due  to  the  study  design.  Patients  will 
be  informed  about  the  existence  of  two  research  condi-
tions before the start of the trial as part of the telephone 
screening.  Depending  on  whether  they  receive  the  pre-
scription  for  the  digital  treatment  application  after  the 
second  session  or  not,  they  will  be  aware  of  their  treat-
ment condition. To minimize the effects of biases on the 
results,  the  statistician  conducting  the  data  analysis  will 
be blinded to the research conditions.

Intervention

After  allocation  to  the  research  conditions,  patients  in 
the EG will receive access to the psychoeducational part 
of the self-guided treatment application, which they will 
be  instructed  to  complete  before  the  third  session.  The 
third session will be a therapy session (150 min), during 
which the patients allocated to the (EG) will be prepared 
for  the  self-guided  VRET.  Here,  the  patients  are  intro-
duced to the rationale behind exposure therapy, they are 
guided through an anxiety-evoking situation in imagina-
tion by their therapist, and lastly, they learn to reevaluate 
their anxiety-evoking symptoms. In order to ensure that 
the  psychotherapeutic  contact  is  balanced  out  between 
the  research  conditions,  patients  in  the  CG  will  receive

relaxation  training  instead,  which  is  also  scheduled  as  a 
manualized  therapy  session  (150  min).  The  relaxation 
training consists of psychoeducation of the human stress 
physiology  regarding  their  anxiety  and  of  progressive 
muscle  relaxation  (PMR).  The  PMR  will  take  approxi-
mately  40  min  and  is  guided  by  the  treating  therapist. 
Then,  while  patients  in  the  experimental  condition  will 
have  4  weeks  to  operate  with  the  self-guided  smart-
phone application, patients in the CG will be  instructed 
to continue with PMR on their own. After that period, all 
patients will be invited for the fourth appointment, which 
consists  of  a  closing  session  with  a  psychotherapist  and 

a post-treatment assessment. One follow-up session will 
take place 6 weeks after the closing session.

Self‑guided digital treatment application with virtual 
reality elements

The  self-guided  digital  short-term  treatment  applica-
tion  was  developed  to  support  the  treatment  of  vari-
ous  anxiety  disorders  such  as  PD,  AG,  and  PDA  [38]. 
It  consists  of  eight  modules  in  total,  of  which  the  first 
six  will  be  available  upon  the  start  of  the  treatment, 
including  psychoeducation  and  cognitive  techniques. 
For  example,  patients  will  be  first  introduced  to  key 
factors  involved  in  the  onset  and  maintenance  of  their 

 Planert et al. Trials          (2022) 23:426 

Page 6 of 9

anxiety  and  fear-related  symptoms.  As  the  treatment 
progresses,  patients  will  be  asked  to  apply  their  new 
knowledge  by  reflecting  on  their  very  own  behavioral 
patterns (e.g., behavioral avoidance, safety signals) and 
experiences.

The remaining modules will be unlocked by the thera-
pist after the third appointment in the outpatient clinic. 
In module 6, patients will face their anxiety: Self-guided 
VRET  will  be  realized  using  a  head-mounted  construc-
tion allowing them to use their smartphone as a display. 
Additionally, headphones will be provided. For safety rea-
sons,  patients  are  asked  to  remain  seated  for  the  whole 
duration  of  the  particular  exposure  session,  while  high-
definition pre-recorded 360° videos are shown. Exposure 
scenarios include a subway ride during rush hour, being 
in  an  elevator  or  a  crowd,  driving  on  the  highway,  or 
driving in an open parking lot. Patients can look around 
freely; however, they cannot interact with or move within 
the displayed environment. In the treatment of PD, self-
guided  interoceptive  exposure  is  added,  to  facilitate  a 
reevaluation  of  somatic  sensations  as  non-threatening. 
Some  of  these  exercises  require  the  patient  to  stand  up 

and, for example, run on the spot. Therefore, these exer-
cises  are  conducted  without  the  head-mounted  display, 
only using headphones. In the last two modules, patients 
will be asked to reflect on the treatment progress and on 
potential achievements they made.

Material and measures

The  primary  outcome  measure  will  be  the  PD  and  AG 
symptom severity, as measured by the German version of 
the  Panic  and  Agoraphobia  Scale  (PAS)  [48]. The  meas-
ure  will  be  carried  out  at  baseline,  interim,  post-inter-
ventional, and 6 weeks following the treatment (see Fig. 2 
for  the  planned  measurement  schedule).  The  PAS  con-
sists of 13 items that measure panic attacks, agoraphobic 
avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, disability, and functional 
avoidance. Each item can be answered on a 5-point Lik-
ert scale. The internal consistency of the German version 
is good with a Cronbach’s alpha of .86 [48].

For  the  secondary  outcome  measure  remission,  the 
MINI-Dips will be used to assess whether patients meet 
the  diagnostic  criteria  for  PD,  AG,  or  PDA.  The  MINI-
Dips  will  be  carried  out  at  baseline  and  the  follow-up

[49].  For  the  secondary  outcome  measure  clinically  sig-
nificant change of symptoms (CSC), the predefined cut-
off score for the remission of the PAS will be used. As the 
total score can range from 0 to 40 and remission is con-
sidered at values between 0 and 8, an individual decline 
of symptoms of 80% is regarded as a CSC.

As  the  present  study  is  conducted  in  cooperation 
with  an  outpatient  clinic,  additional  outcome  variables 
will  routinely  be  measured  and  included  in  exploratory 
analyses.  These  measures  will  include  general  depres-
sion  symptoms,  measured  through  the  German  version 
of  the  General  Depression  Scale  (ADS-K)  [50];  general 
psychological  well-being,  as  measured  by  the  Positive 
Mental  Health  Scale  (PMH)  [51];  willingness  to  change, 
as measured by the German version of the University of 
Rhode  Island  Change  Assessment  Scale  (FEVER)  [52]; 
competency  and  locus  of  control,  as  measured  by  the 
German  Competency  and  Locus  of  Control  Question-
naire (FKK) [53]; anxiety sensitivity, as measured by the 
German version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-
3)  [54];  state-trait  anxiety,  as  measured  by  the  German 
version  of  the  State-Trait  Anxiety  Questionnaire  (STAI) 
[55]; and cybersickness, as measured by the German ver-
sion of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) [56]. 
Additionally, to monitor adherence to the protocol, it will 
be measured if and how often the treatment application 
is accessed.

A  data  monitoring  committee  (DMC)  will  keep  track 
of  the  data  collection.  It  consists  of  student  assistants 
involved in the data collection and the primary investiga-
tors. The DMC is independent of any third party such as 
the sponsor; none of its members is associated with the 
developer of the treatment application in any form.

Data preparation and planned analysis

Multiple  imputation  based  on  demographic  data  will  be 
used  to  replace  missing  data,  once  patients  have  com-
pleted  at  least  the  third  psychotherapeutic  session  [57]. 
Data  from  patients  that  discontinued  the  treatment 
before  randomization  or  right  after  the  second  session 
will  be  excluded  from  the  analysis.  Based  on  the  inten-
tion-to-treat  (ITT)  principle,  non-compliance  to  the 
treatment  or  deviation  from  the  treatment  plan  will  not 
lead to the exclusion of participants [58]. Outliers will be 
included  in  the  analysis  unless  they  indicate  impossible 
values.  To  test  whether  randomization  succeeded,  base-
line group differences of the variables age and gender, as 
well as baseline scores of the PAS, will be analyzed using 
t-tests for independent samples. Mauchly’s sphericity test 
will  be  conducted  to  monitor  whether  violations  of  the 
sphericity  assumption  occurred.  If  violated,  the  Green-
house-Geisser  correction  (ε  <  .75)  or  the  Hyunh-Feldt 
correction  (ε  >  .75)  will  be  applied,  depending  on  the 

degree of violation [59]. To test the primary hypothesis, a 2 
(condition:  VR-intervention/active  control)  ×  4  (time: 
baseline/interim/post-treatment/follow-up)  repeated 
measures  ANOVA  will  be  conducted  with  the  primary 
outcome  measurement  assessing  panic  and  agoraphobia 
symptomology,  the  PAS.  Here,  the  interaction  p-value 
and effect size R2 will be interpreted. In case of a signifi-
cant interaction effect, simple contrasts will be estimated 
to assess the differences between EG and CG across the 
specific  time  points.  For  the  dichotomous  clinical  out-
come  measure  remission  at  follow-up,  a  chi-square  test 
of  independence  will  be  conducted.  Another  chi-square 
test of independence will be performed for the dichoto-
mous CSC at follow-up.

Discussion
PD, AG, and PDA are a heavy burden for the individual 
and  society.  Psychotherapy  is  effective,  yet  the  access  is 
limited, resulting in long waiting lists and aggravation of 
impairment. Digital treatment options are promising, but 
more research is needed to facilitate the application in a 
clinical  context.  The  present  trial,  therefore,  is  designed 
to  investigate  the  efficacy  of  a  self-guided  digital  short-
term  treatment  with  VR-based  exposure  for  PD,  AG, 
and PDA. Combining self-report measures for symptom 
severity  with  a  structured  clinical  interview  performed 
by a licensed therapist, the results of this study can shed 
light on the issue of whether a cost-efficient self-aid treat-
ment with minimal therapeutic supervision can lead to a 
decrease in PD, AG, and PDA symptoms and recovery.

The  results  of  the  present  randomized  controlled  trial 
will  provide  new  information  about  the  efficacy  of  self-
guided  VR  applications.  Shedding  light  on  the  efficacy 
of  such  interventions  is  important  to  contextualize  self-
guided VR treatment as a possible treatment method for 
PD, AG, and PDA. If proven effective, self-guided inter-
ventions  could  constitute  a  cost-effective  and  time-effi-
cient adjunction to existing traditional treatments.

The  findings  of  the  present  study  will  provide  impor-
tant cues for clinical practice and future research. If the 
self-guided  VR  treatment  is  found  to  be  effective,  this 
trial can pave the way for a new wave of self-guided treat-
ments  to  be  integrated  into  the  course  of  patient-cen-
tered therapy. This would lower the burden on the public 
mental  health  system  and,  more  importantly,  people 
would have to spend less time on long waiting lists before 
they can get access to the treatment they need. Once this 
new  form  of  treatment  is  found  to  be  effective,  future 
research  can  take  a  step  further  to  directly  compare  the 
self-guided VR treatment to a classic in vivo CBT treat-
ment  or  whether  the  efficacy  of  CBT  treatments  could 
be  enhanced  by  adding  self-guided  interventions  to  the

treatment.  To  maximize  the  clinical  applicability,  future 
research  could  tackle  the  generalizability  of  potential 
findings  by  discovering  if  there  are  patient  groups  that 
benefit most from this digital treatment method.
