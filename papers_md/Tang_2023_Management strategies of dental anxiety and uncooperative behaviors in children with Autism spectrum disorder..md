Management strategies of dental anxiety 
and uncooperative behaviors in children 
with Autism spectrum disorder

Abstract 
Background  Children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was frequently experienced dental anxiety and uncoop‑
erative behaviors during dental treatment. Oral health care was necessary because of the poor oral hygiene and prev‑
alent dental diseases in this population.

Aim  In this systematic review, we evaluated the effectiveness and feasibility for pediatric dentist to manage the den‑
tal anxiety in children with ASD.

Design  PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically performed on the literature search. The date 
of eligible publications was from inception to January 2023. After that, the quality of eligible studies was assessed 
by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Review findings were summarized using the PRISMA Statement for reporting.

Results  A total of six studies were systematically evaluated according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five 
studies were conducted to evaluate ASD Children’s anxiety and uncooperative performance in the progressive 
oral examination, oral disease prophylaxis and fluoride application. The other one study evaluated the success 
rate of treatment in decayed permanent tooth treatment. In the included studies, four studies indicated that it 
was extremely necessary to reduce dental anxiety of ASD children to increase the cooperation in sensory‑adapted 
dental environment (SADE).

Conclusion  It is not always effective and feasible for pediatric dentist to manage the dental anxiety in children 
with autism during routine oral examination. Meanwhile, it is necessary for ASD children to conduct preoperative 
psychological assessment, to investigate parents’ expectations and cooperation, and to determine whether to start 
corresponding dental treatment.

Introduction
Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD),  characterized  by 
impaired  social  interaction,  communication  deficits, 
limited interest, and the presence of repetitive and stere-
otyped behaviors, is a complex neurodevelopmental con-
dition,  especially  in  children  [1].  Compared  to  typically 
developing(TD)  children,  dental  anxiety  and  fear  were 
often existed in a group of children with ASD, as mani-
fested  via  difficult  behaviors  and  uncooperative  reac-
tions during dental treatment [2–4]. These uncooperative

behaviors  and  uncontrolled  body  movements  (including 
hyperactivity, impulsivity, anger, self- stimulatory, selfin-
jurious and disruptive behaviors) make dental treatment 
more complex [5, 6].

Dental care and oral health, for children with such dis-
orders,  were  areas  that  required  special  procedures  and 
adaptations because of the poor oral hygiene and severe 
dental  diseases  in  this  population  [7].  Marshall  et  al.  [8] 
found  that  the  oral  hygiene  status  of  children  with  ASD 
was  associated  with  risk  indicators  that  had  an  impact 
on new dental caries. Dental treatment was full of poten-
tially frightening stimuli due to the peculiar environment, 
unfamiliar  pronunciations  and  strongly  light  exposure 
[1].  It  had  been  proved  that  autistic  children  commonly 
exhibited  uncooperative  behaviors  such  as  crying  or 
physical aggression during dentist visits. One of the rea-
sons which might lead to worse oral health was the den-
tal  anxiety  about  dental  examination  and  oral  hygiene 
status  in  ASD  population,  which  impeded  their  oral 
care  [9–11].  The  focus  of  oral  behavior  management  in 
pediatric  dentistry  was  communication  and  demonstra-
tion  of  dental  treatment  procedures  [12],  children  with 
ASD  needed  to  formulate  the  better  adapted  and  spe-
cific strategies to improve the success rate of dental care 
[13]. The use of visual pedagogy was an effective practice 
to  improve  cooperative  behavior  in  children  with  ASD 
[14],  and  these  could  effectively  reduce  dental  anxiety 
through video peer-to-peer modeling or difference types 
of  electronic  screen  media  temptation  and  intervention 
[15].  Cermak  et  al.  [16]  analyzed  the  pain,  behavior  and 
sensory discomfort both in a regular dental environment 
(RDE)  and  in  a  sensory-adapted  dental  environment 
(SADE) between ASD and TD children in period of den-
tal treatment. Same with the result of another author, the 
research showed that a SADE might be effective in reduc-
ing anxiety and inducing relaxation [17].

According  to  the  existing  studies,  due  to  the  wide-
spread  development  of  general  anesthesia  for  children’s 
dental  treatment,  there  was  still  controversy  regard-
ing  whether  it  was  necessary  to  induce  to  relieve  dental 
anxiety  and  uncooperative  behavior  of  autistic  children, 
and  what  kind  of  behavior  management  was  used  for 
dental  care  and  oral  health.  Therefore,  we  summarized 
and assessed  the  feasibility and effectiveness of  this sys-
tematic  review  in  managing  dental  anxiety  and  uncoop-
erative behavior in autistic children who underwent oral 
health care and dental treatment.

Methods
The  current  studies  were  conducted  on  the  basis  of  the 
Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and 
Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  statement  [18].  The  registra-
tion ID on PROSPERO is CRD42023473698, and the link 

of  the  PROSPERO  is  https:// www. crd. york. ac. uk/  pros-

The project of research

The  main  question  of  the  current  research  was  carried 
out to determine in this systematic review through which 
the  literature  was  investigated:  How  to  alleviate  dental 
phobia of autistic children, how to evaluate their degree 
of cooperation and how to take effective oral treatment?

The PICO strategy

Answering  the  above-mentioned  research  questions 
through PICOs method which the clinical questions can 
be  correctly  formulated  and  derives  from  the  Evidence 
Based Medicine (EBM) approach, was used to write sys-
tematic  reviews.  In  this  strategy,  the  study  of  following 
aspects should be considered:

P: Population of interest (autistic children between 3 
and 19 years old)
I: Interventions (management techniques in the den-
tal treatment and the cooperation rate of children)
C: Control (TD children and ASD group in different 
dental environment)
O:  Outcome  (the  improvement  of  dental  anxiety  in 
the behavior scale)

Literature search

The literature search strategy was performed in PubMed, 
Embase and the Cochrane Library (all from inception to 
January 2023). The search items were as follows: (“Autis-
tic  Disorder”  OR  “autism”  OR  “Asperger  syndrome”  OR 
“Autism  Spectrum  Disorder”  OR  “ASD”)  AND  (“dental 
fear” OR “dental anxiety” OR “dental anxieties” OR “den-
tal phobia” OR “Dentophobia” OR “Odontophobia”). The 
title  and  abstract  of  all  searched  articles  were  indepen-
dently screened by two authors. The search was restricted 
to English articles and human studies. Any duplicates or 
no  relevance  articles  were  rejected.  Full  texts  of  eligible 
articles were retrieved for further evaluation (Table 1).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The research scope of this systematic review that met the 
following criteria were eligible for inclusion:

for the NOS score, high quality was scored greater than 
seven; otherwise, it was low quality [19]. The results were 
showed in Table 2.

1) Articles in English;
2) Controlled trials, interventional study and studies 
with comparative groups in full text;
3) Children population suffering from ASD;
4)  Interventions  for  behavior  scales  or  cooperation 
rate;

The exclusion criteria were as follows:

1) Absence of English language; 
2) Meta-analyses, reviews and case reports; 
3) Children population with other diagnoses or ASD 
adults; 
4) Duplicate studies.

Data extraction

information  was 

Data 
repeatedly  confirmed  and 
extracted by two authors, the following detailed analysis 
was  listed:  descriptive  characteristics  (authors  informa-
tion and study design), participants, comparative groups, 
assessment tools and dental procedures in each included 
study.  The  significance  and  effectiveness  in  the  anxiety 
and behavior scores and the effect comparison before and 
after intervention were evaluated according to the man-
agement of intervention and measurement of result.

Quality assessment

Result
Study selection

The electronic search resulted in 264 studies, of which 66 
studies  were  duplicates  and  eliminated. The  abstracts  of 
198  articles  were  screened,  and  the  related  studies  were 
read  by  both  researchers  for  potential  inclusion.  Seven 
full-texts were assessed for eligibility, and one study was 
excluded  for  the  following  reasons:  adult  samples  with 
ASD. Finally six studies were included in this systematic 
literature  review.  According  to  the  PRISMA  statement, 
a  detailed  flowchart  in  Figure  1  was  developed  for  the 
screening process of the study.

Descriptive characteristics

All  included  studies  were  organized  based  on  different 
intervention approach. Publication year of studies ranged 
from 2014 to 2022. The overall sample sizes in these stud-
ies  varied  from  44  to  80  and  the  total  number  of  child 
participants  were  346,  of  which  302  were  autistic  chil-
dren. Each study had different and diverse tools that were 
used to assess the influence of intervention based on the 
performance of behavior scales or cooperation rate dur-
ing  dental  assessment.  Five  studies  were  conducted  to 
evaluate  anxiety  and  cooperative  behavior  in  children 
with  ASD  by  the  progressive  oral  examination,  fluoride 
application  and  oral  disease  prophylaxis.  The  other  one 
study evaluated the success rate of treatment in decayed 
permanent tooth treatment.

The  quality  assessment  of  the  six  included  studies  was 
conducted  by  the  Newcastle-Ottawa  Scale  (NOS).  As

main  results  of  six  studies.  Four  studies  indicated  that 
it  was  extremely  necessary  to  reduce  dental  anxiety  of 
ASD  children  to  increase  the  cooperation  in  SADE. 
Besides,  mean  anxiety  and  behavioral  scores  signifi-
cantly  decreased  according  to  the  application  of  video 
modeling  plus  video  goggles/DVD.  However,  one  of 
the  studies  was  concluded  that  there  were  no  signifi-
cant  correlations  between  the  Abeer  Children  Dental 
Anxiety Scale (ACDAS) and any hypothetical variables 
(Table 3).

We extracted Children’s Dental Behavior Rating Scale 
(CDBRS) and A & C scale outcome data from two stud-
ies  that  compared  the  dental  anxiety  and  cooperation 
behavior  outcomes  of  TD  and  ASD  groups.  The  out-
come reported by Leah I. Stein et al [14] indicated that 
compared to the TD group, children with ASD demon-
strated  greater  resistance  and  uncooperative  behavior 
at the time of dental healthcare, based on dentist-report 
on  the  Anxiety  and  Cooperation  Scale  and  the  Frankl 
Scale  (both  P’s  <  0.001),  as  well  as  overt  behaviors 
coded  by  the  CDBRS  (P  =  0.001).  The  above  results 
were  consistent  with  those  reported  by  Cermak  et  al 
[16]. In addition, there were data showing that SADE

Discussion
In this research, we systematically reviewed six published 
scientific studies focusing on ASD Children’s dental anxi-
ety  and  cooperative  behavior  during  oral  examination 
and  treatment.  The  overall  sample  size  of  these  studies 
ranges  from  44  to  80,  with  a  total  of  346  child  partici-
pants, including 302 children with autism.

Research  so  far,  this  is  the  first  systematic  review  to 
summarize  the  clinical  practical  significance  of  dental 
anxiety in ASD children by specific evaluation scales. In 
the five articles of this systematic review, the researchers 
reported that SADE could reduce dental anxiety of ASD 
children  to  increase  the  cooperation  in  the  progressive 
oral  examination,  dental  prophylaxis  and  fluoride  appli-
cation.  In  another  study,  the  researchers  recommended 
that  ASD  children  had  gradually  better  performed  and 
less  anxiety  in  dental  exam  at  the  beginning  baseline  of 
the study (T0) and every two months thereafter (T1, T2, 
T3, and T4).

Dental visit was a challenge thing for autistic children, 
parents sometimes delayed or refused to go to the dentist 
for autistic children because of dental fear and extremely 
uncooperative  performance  [20,  21].  According  to  a

Conditions could improve the relaxation and cooperation rate of the ASD group (46 % RDE to 59 % SADE) and most TD children exhibited positive dental cooperative 
behavior in both environmental conditions (91 and 95 % for RDE and SADE, respectively) (Table 4)

previous study that children with ASD might be particu-
larly  vulnerable  to  dental  anxiety,  about  70%  of  subjects 
experienced  clinically  significant  dental  anxiety,  which 
could  lead  to  uncooperative  behavior  at  the  dentist  and 
refuse  any  dental  examination. Thus,  poor  dental  health 
was  a  common  condition  in  this  population  [22].  Com-
pared to TD children, ASD children showed more obvi-
ous  behavioral  abnormalities  during  dental  care.  This 
result was consistent with previous research reporting a 
series of uncooperative behaviors in dental treatment of 
autistic children [3, 23]. Meanwhile, this supported Daw-
son et al. [24] view that children with ASD would activate 
their sympathetic “fight or flight” nervous system in this 
time  of  stress,  making  them  hate  dental  cleanings  more 
than TD children. Furthermore, dental environment was 
also  important,  most  studies  showed  that  ASD  children 
exhibited  less  physiological  and  behavioral  manifesta-
tions  of  distress  receiving  routine  oral  cleanings  at  the 
SADE compared to the RDE.

In  pediatric  dentistry,  conventional  behavioral  man-
agements  such  as  tell-show-do,  voice  control,  nonver-
bal  communication,  and  verbal  positive  reinforcement 
might  be  effective  [12].  However,  due  to  ASD  children’s 
common  communication  barriers  and  lower  expressive 
communication  ability,  new  strategies  might  be  applied 
to increase cooperative and controllable behavior in chil-
dren with ASD compared to TD children. These manage-
ments  such  as  using  visual  aids,  behavioral  training  and 
modeling, pictures displaying, stories reading and desen-
sitization might be helpful for children’s dental visit, and 
these  technologies  have  been  successfully  applied  to 
children with ASD in pediatric dentistry and other fields 
[15,  25–28].  In  this  systematic  review,  four  studies  [13, 
15,  16,  29]  were  assessed  to  investigate  the  dental  anxi-
ety  of  ASD  children  with  specific  management  strate-
gies during dental care. In our included studies, G. Lefer 
et  al.  [13]  reported  that  when  performing  this  activity 
in  progressive  dental  management,  dental  examinations 

were  more  effective  and  less  anxiety  was  observed.  The 
other  three  studies  indicated  that  children  reported  sig-
nificant  improvements  in  pain  intensity  and  sensory 
discomfort  measurements  in  the  dental  environment 
in  both  the  ASD  and  TD  groups  during  SADE,  also  the 
treatment  success  rate  of  SADE  group  was  higher  than 
that of RDE group. Furthermore, the rest two studies [7, 
22]  used  different  scales  to  estimate  the  dental  anxiety 
and uncooperative behavior. Stein et al. [7] reported that 
children  with  ASD  demonstrated  greater  resistance  and 
uncooperative behavior at the time of dental healthcare, 
compared  to  the  TD  group,  based  on  dentist-report  on 
the Anxiety and Cooperation Scale and the Frankl Scale, 
as well as by the CDBRS. According to parents’ reports, 
children with autism spectrum disorders had more diffi-
culties in sensory processing, general anxiety, and dental 
anxiety than children with TD in this study. However, Ye 
Park et al. [22], in their analysis, demonstrated that there 
were no significant associations between the ACDAS and 
any hypothetical variables in all children with ASD.

In  this  systematic  review,  although  the  dental  anxiety 
and  uncooperative  behavior  in  autistic  children  might 
influence the decision and treatment methods of pediat-
ric dentist to complete a full dental care and oral health, 
there  was  significant  difference  in  the  measures  of  sen-
sory  discomfort  and  pain  intensity  between  the  SADE 
and RDE groups. Therefore, it is necessary for the pediat-
ric dentist to take appropriate management strategies to 
intervene  in  dental  examination  and  treatment  for  chil-
dren with ASD unless encountered great resistance from 
parents and children during the dental visit.

There  are  some  limitations  in  the  current  review. 
First, the six studies included in this systematic review 
were  restricted  to  English  language  searching,  which 
would  cause  some  important  information  to  be  lack-
ing  in  other  language.  Second,  these  six  studies  lacked 
flexible  data  to  implement  a  meta-analysis  to  support 
this  research.  Third,  interventions  and  measurement

scales in each study were inconsistent. Finally, the sam-
ple  size  was  relatively  small.  Therefore,  wider  regional 
researches  from  more  countries  and  randomized  con-
trolled  trials  verifying  the  relationship  between  dental 
anxiety  and  abnormal  behavior  in  ASD  children  were 
required to confirm our results.

Conclusion
It is not always effective and feasible for pediatric den-
tist  to  manage  in  dental  care  due  to  the  stress  of  den-
tal  anxiety  in  children  with  ASD.  Also,  it  is  necessary 
for  ASD  children  to  conduct  preoperative  psychologi-
cal assessment, to investigate parents’ expectations and 
cooperation,  and  determine  whether  to  start  corre-
sponding dental treatment.
