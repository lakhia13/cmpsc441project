Abstract

This  paper  reports  on  topics  discussed  at  a  Society  for  Research  on  Nicotine  and Tobacco  pre-
conference workshop at the 2019 annual Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco meeting. 
The  goal  of  the  pre-conference  workshop  was  to  help  develop  a  shared  understanding  of  the 
importance  of  several  tobacco-related  priority  groups  in  tobacco  use  disorder  (TUD)  treatment 
research and to highlight challenges in measurement related to these groups. The workshop fo-
cused  on  persons  with  minoritized  sex,  gender  identity,  and  sexual  orientation  identities;  per-
sons  with  minoritized  racial  and  ethnic  backgrounds;  persons  with  lower  socioeconomic  status 
(SES); and persons with mental health concerns. In addition to experiencing commercial tobacco-
related health disparities, these groups are also underrepresented in tobacco research, including 
TUD treatment studies. Importantly, there is wide variation in how and whether researchers are 
identifying variation within these priority groups. Best practices for measuring and reporting sex,

gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, SES, and mental health concerns in TUD treat-
ment research are needed. This paper provides information about measurement challenges when 
including  these  groups  in TUD  treatment  research  and  specific  recommendations  about  how  to 
measure these groups and assess potential disparities in outcomes. The goal of this paper is to en-
courage TUD treatment researchers to use measurement best practices in these priority groups in 
an effort to conduct meaningful and equity-promoting research. Increasing the inclusion and visi-
bility of these groups in TUD treatment research will help to move the field forward in decreasing 
tobacco-related health disparities.
Implications:  Tobacco-related disparities exist for a number of priority groups including, among 
others,  women,  individuals  with  minoritized  sexual  and  gender  identities,  individuals  with 
minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds, individuals with lower SES, and individuals with mental 
health  concerns.  Research  on TUD  treatments  for  many  of  these  subgroups  is  lacking. Accurate 
assessment  and  consideration  of  these  subgroups  will  provide  needed  information  about  effi-
cacious and effective TUD treatments, about potential mediators and moderators, and for accur-
ately describing study samples, all critical elements for reducing tobacco-related disparities, and 
improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in TUD treatment research.

Introduction

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in 
the United States (US) and a leading cause globally.1,2 Cigarettes are 
the  most  commonly  used  tobacco  product  throughout  the  world3 
and  among  US  adults4;  however,  rates  of  smoking  and  associated 
consequences  differ  for  a  number  of  priority  groups.  Groups  who 
exhibit a higher prevalence of smoking cigarettes include sexual and 
gender minority (SGM) versus cisgender and heterosexual individ-
uals,  lower  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  versus  higher  SES  individ-
uals, and individuals with mental health concerns compared to those 
without mental health concerns (eg,4-8). Furthermore, unlike in the 
general population, smoking prevalence has not declined over time 
for some of these groups (eg, people with mental health concerns).9,10 
While  Black  individuals  and  women  have  a  lower  smoking  preva-
lence than White individuals and men, respectively, members of these 
two subgroups experience some areas of disproportionate smoking-
related health consequences.4,11,12 Consequently, it is critical that to-
bacco use disorder (TUD) treatments be efficacious and effective for 
these priority groups to reduce smoking inequities.

At  the  2019  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Society  for  Research  on 
Nicotine  and  Tobacco  (SRNT),  the  SRNT  Treatment  Research 
Network sponsored a pre-conference workshop titled “An update to 
the basics: Current approaches for measuring and understanding key 
individual differences and cessation outcomes.” The goal of the pre-
conference  workshop  was  to  help  develop  a  shared  understanding 
of the importance of several tobacco-related priority groups in TUD 
treatment  research  and  to  highlight  challenges  in  measurement  re-
lated  to  these  groups.  For  example,  some  subgroups  (eg,  SGM  in-
dividuals) have been underrepresented in research because there is 
no  attempt  to  identify  the  subgroups  via  assessment  or  the  assess-
ments used do not accurately reflect the full range of subgroups.13 
Importantly,  terminology  used  to  describe  some  subgroups  has 
changed over time (eg, terms related to SGM status). As part of the 
workshop,  talks  provided  recommendations  for  conducting  TUD 
treatment research, with particular attention to measurement chal-
lenges  related  to  sex,  gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  race,  eth-
nicity, SES, and mental health concerns. While there are additional 
important  priority  groups  (eg,  those  from  rural  areas,  those  from 
low-  and  middle-income  countries,  those  with  comorbid  medical 
conditions  such  as  HIV),  the  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  translate  the 

information from the SRNT pre-conference workshop into a written 
resource. It should be noted that the information discussed here is 
based primarily, but not exclusively, on US studies as global differ-
ences  were  beyond  the  scope  of  the  pre-conference  workshop  and 
this  summary,  although  recommendations  relevant  for  the  larger 
global research field are included where possible.

For each of the four sections below [(1) sex, gender, and sexual 
orientation,  (2)  race  and  ethnicity,  (3)  SES,  (4)  mental  health  con-
cerns], we first define key terms (Definitions) and then provide infor-
mation about assessing subgroups (Assessment). Finally, each section 
provides  group-specific  recommendations  (Recommendations).  In 
the final section of the paper, we discuss overall recommendations 
and conclusions. Developing a common language and methods for 
assessment may improve the generalizability and reach of TUD treat-
ment research findings and our ability to integrate such research into 
clinical  practice,  including  tailoring  treatment  effectively  among  a 
number of tobacco-related priority groups.

A few notes about the language used throughout this paper: (1) 
“Tobacco use” refers to commercial tobacco use and not ceremonial 
tobacco  use.  (2) A  diagnosis  of  a TUD  includes  a  range  of  symp-
toms  including  difficulty  reducing  or  stopping  the  use  of  tobacco 
and withdrawal symptoms.14 Treatment studies may include a range 
of inclusion criteria; some include TUD while other studies include 
other tobacco-related criteria (eg, number of cigarettes per day). This 
paper  will  refer  to “TUD  treatment”  for  consistency.  (3)  The  lan-
guage  used  below  to  refer  to  demographic  groups  is  based  on  the 
language from the individual articles being described. Demographic 
groups  may  be  referred  to  by  different  terms  across  studies  (eg, 
African-American vs. Black, sex vs. gender) even when the terms are 
not necessarily interchangeable.

Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation

Definitions
One’s  sex  is  often  assigned  at  birth  by  medical  providers  and/or 
parents  based  on  external  genitalia  and  refers  to  biological  differ-
ences (eg, chromosome differences); whereas, gender is a social con-
struct with gender identity consisting of an individual’s concept of 
themselves.15 Labels for one’s sex at birth may include male, female, 
and intersex. Labels for gender identity may include man, woman, or 

Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2022, Vol. 24, No. 5

645

labels related to nonbinary gender identity (eg, genderqueer, gender 
nonconforming,  agender,  gender  fluid).16 The  relationship  between 
sex at birth and gender identity can be described as cisgender (ie, sex 
assigned at birth does not differ from gender identity) or transgender 
(ie, sex assigned at birth differs from gender identity).16

Sexual orientation encompasses one’s sexual attraction, behavior, 
and identity.15,17 Sexual attraction may be to the same or other sexes/
genders to varying degrees, and sexual behavior can similarly include 
partners from the same sex/gender or other sexes/genders as well as 
no sexual partners. While sexual attraction and sexual behavior are 
aspects  of  sexual  orientation,  sexual  identity  is  the  most  common 
way  that  one  thinks  about  and  self-describes  their  sexual  orienta-
tion. Labels for one’s sexual orientation include gay or lesbian (ie, 
attracted to same-sex/gender partners), heterosexual (ie, attracted to 
opposite-sex/gender  partners),  bisexual  (ie,  attracted  to  both  male 
and female partners), pansexual (ie, attraction includes partners out-
side of binary conceptualizations of sex or gender), and asexual (ie, 
no attraction or no strong attraction to partners).

SGM  is  a  commonly  used  umbrella  term  in  research  that  en-
compasses individuals with any minoritized gender identity and/or 
sexual orientation. However, gender and sexual identity are distinct 
and should not be conflated when measured.18

Assessment
In the treatment literature, there have been longstanding issues with 
sex and gender assessment and reporting. These terms are often er-
roneously used interchangeably, and many studies erroneously assess 

sex  and  gender  identity  as  binary  characteristics19  when  both  are 
more continuous in nature (eg, intersex, nonbinary gender).

The most frequently cited guides for assessing gender identity and 
sexual orientation come from the Gender Identity in US Surveillance 
(GenIUSS) group15 and Williams Institute’s Sexual Minority Assessment 
Research Team  (SMART).20  Regarding  gender  identity,  the  GenIUSS 
group  recommends  a  two-step  approach;  first  assessing  sex  assigned 
at birth, on the original birth certificate, then assessing current gender 
identity. SMART recommends assessing sexual orientation within the 
following three domains: sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual 
identity. These domains should be assessed separately because they are 
not always congruent—for example, individuals who report engaging 
in  same-sex  sexual  behavior  may  identify  as  heterosexual.  How  re-
searchers  operationalize  sexual  orientation  in  smoking  treatment  re-
search can affect their findings if attraction, behavior, and identity have 
different  relations  with  outcomes  of  interest.  Further,  some  domains 
may not capture information about sexual orientation (eg, for adoles-
cents not yet engaging in sexual behavior, sexual behavior would not 
be a good representation of sexual orientation). Information from all 
three domains should be assessed and presented in papers.

Given  the  need  for  brevity  where  SGM  status  is  not  a  major 
focus of the study, there are practical suggestions for implementing 
these guidelines broadly in TUD treatment research. See Figure 1 for 
domains  and  sample  question  wording,21  which  are  based  on  the 
GenIUSS  and  SMART  recommendations.  For  additional  guidance, 
NIH’s Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office maintains a re-
pository of resources (https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sgmro/measurement).

Figure 1.  Recommended response and answer terminology for measuring dimensions of sexual orientation and gender. At minimum, a measure of sexual 
orientation and a measure of gender should be included as standard demographic items across research modalities. Note, however, that research questions 
involving  the  sexual  and  gender  minority  (SGM)  community  may  require  more  advanced  questions  and/or  response  options  to  allow  more  specificity.  For 
example, the response options used here may be too binary for some SGM community members. “Male sexual partners” could be interpreted as “partners who 
identify as men,” “partners assigned male at birth,” or a combination of the above. Measures should be chosen and adapted to suit the research question and to 
be appropriate for the target population. Reproduced with permission from Dermody SS, Heffner JL, Hinds JT, et al. We are in this together: promoting health

Recommendations
Assessment  of  sexual  and  gender  identity  is  important  for  under-
standing  TUD  treatment  response.  The  low  representation  in  re-
search  of  intersex  participants  and  participants  with  minoritized 
gender identities may be partly due to limited assessment options (eg, 
not including intersex or nonbinary as response options). Assessment 
should  include  careful  and  inclusive  measurement  of  the  range  of 
sexual  and  gender  identities,  using  the  most  recent  best-practice 
guides  (see  Refs.  15,  20  and  Figure  1).  Individual  countries  have  de-
veloped  their  own  definition  and  assessment  guidelines  and  these 
documents  should  be  consulted  for  country-specific  information 
(eg, Australia,  https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/standard-
sex-gender-variations-sex-characteristics-and-sexual-orientation-
variable/latest-release; United Kingdom, www.ons.gov.uk/economy/
environmentalaccounts/articles/whatisthedifferencebetweensexandg
ender/2019-02-21).

As  noted  above,  it  is  recommended  that  sexual  orientation  be 
assessed as three separate domains (ie, sexual attraction, sexual be-
havior, sexual identity). Further, sexual orientation may develop or 
change  over  time,  and  changing,  versus  stable,  sexual  orientations 
are associated with greater risk of tobacco use.22 When disseminating 
research, it is essential to clearly state how variables were operation-
alized.  For  instance,  because  sex  and  gender  identity  have  often 
(mistakenly) been used interchangeably, it is unclear to what extent 
biological factors related to one’s sex versus social factors related to 
one’s gender identity differentially relate to TUD treatment processes 
and outcomes. This lack of clarity can be addressed by: (1) clearly 
stating how constructs were assessed, and (2) consistently using the 
correct  terminology  when  describing  research  findings  and  impli-
cations.  Guidance  on  using  non-biased  language  when  discussing 
sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation in scientific writing (eg, 
“sexual orientation” rather than “sexual preference”) is provided by 
the American Psychological Association.16,17 Adherence to up-to-date 
best practices facilitates cross-study comparisons as well as aggrega-
tion of data, which is sometimes needed given the low numbers of 
SGM individuals included in any one study.

Understanding  and  assessing  sexual  and  gender  identity  is  also 
critical for the protection and respectful treatment of research parti-
cipants.23 For example, clinical studies, especially those administering 
medication, often include procedures to protect pregnant women or 
women of childbearing potential. As SGM individuals become better 
represented  in  research,  it  is  important  to  properly  assess  whether 
or not individuals are of childbearing potential, irrespective of their 
gender or sexual identity, if becoming pregnant is an exclusion cri-
terion for a study. Interviewing may also be useful for assessing SGM 
individuals’ preferred language related to sex and gender identity.

Race and Ethnicity

Definitions
Race is a sociopolitical construct used to categorize individuals into 
social groups.24 Racial terms originated from an unscientific and ra-
cist belief that certain population groups are superior to others based 
on  phenotypic  genetic  expression  or  place  of  origin.25  Ethnicity  is 
defined as a group of people that identify with each other based on 
shared ancestry.24

Assessment
Measurement of race and ethnicity is shaped by historical and cur-
rent  social  and  political  structures.26  Changing  demographics  and 

social contexts have resulted in changes in the way race and ethni-
city have been measured over time.26 The way in which individuals 
self-identify can also be dynamic. Researchers have questioned the 
purpose of measuring race and ethnicity for these reasons and be-
cause racial/ethnic categories continue to be incorrectly used to infer 
biological differences across groups.26

There  are  several  guidelines  published  on  the  measurement  of 
race  and  ethnicity  in  social  and  behavioral  sciences  research.24,26,27 
In  addition,  the  Phenotype  and  eXposures  project  (PhenX),  led  by 
RTI International with funding from the National Human Genome 
Research Institute, has developed consensus measures for the exam-
ination  of  race  and  ethnicity  in  tobacco  control  research  (https://
www.phenxtoolkit.org).28  PhenX  follows  the  US  Department  of 
Health and Human Services recommendation to use separate ques-
tions  to  assess  race  and  ethnicity,29  with  questions  about  ethnicity 
coming  before  questions  about  race.29  This  method,  however,  is 
known to result in high rates of nonresponse among those who iden-
tify as Hispanic/Latino.30

In  TUD  treatment  research,  the  details  of  questions  used  to 
gather  participants’  racial/ethnic  background,  the  national  back-
ground of Asian American, Hispanic, or Latino participants, and the 
tribe of American Indian participants are not consistently included 
in  published  reports.  There  are  studies  where  ethnicity  is  not  re-
ported along with race, and participants who are White have been 
used as the reference group without a clear rationale.

Recommendations
Due to high nonresponse rates among Hispanic/Latino individuals 
when using separate questions to assess race and ethnicity, a single 
self-reported race and ethnicity question is recommended (see Table 
1).30  In  addition,  research  from  the  US  Census  Bureau30  indicates 
that the single-item format better reflects racial/ethnic self-identifica-
tion. This recommendation deviates from the current federal guide-
lines, which may raise concern about the comparability of measures 
across studies. However, valid and useful measurement of race and 
ethnicity should supersede this concern, and federal guidelines often 
change. We recognize, however, that some studies may be required to 
use separate questions to assess race and ethnicity to meet reporting 
requirements by national funding agencies. Regardless, respondents 
should be permitted to indicate all racial/ethnic groups with which 
they identify (eg, “select all that apply”) as opposed to requiring se-
lection of a single category.30 The latter forces individuals who are 
multiracial  to  select  only  one  race  (unless  there  is  a “multiracial” 
category, which has its own limitations),31 precluding an assessment 
of the growing multiracial population.

According  to  the  US  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  the 
minimum  racial  and  ethnic  categories  to  be  collected  when  as-
sessing race and ethnicity are the following: White; Black or African 
American;  American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native;  Asian;  Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and Hispanic or Latino or not 
Hispanic  or  Latino.29  These  standard  categories  may  not  be  suffi-
cient, however, to comprehensively capture racial/ethnic background. 
In addition, individuals may identify in ways that are distinct from 
standard categories (eg, Latinx). Therefore, studies may need to sup-
plement standard categories with others that are of particular rele-
vance to the population or outcomes being studied. For example, in 
the US, individuals with Middle Eastern or North African ancestry 
are  instructed  to  select ‘White’ 32;  however,  many  such  individuals 
do not self-identify as White and would prefer a Middle Eastern or 
North African race category.33 Also, there are country-specific racial

The following items come from surveys conducted in the United States. The 
race  and  ethnicity  item  comes  from  a  United  States  Census  Bureau  survey 
that compared different question formats and response options to assess race 
and ethnicity.30 It is not a standard item used in United States Census Bureau 
assessments. The socioeconomic status items come from the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance Survey. These survey questions are sample items and may 
need  to  be  adapted  for  use  in  certain  study  populations  or  updated  to  re-
flect demographic changes. Studies conducted in other countries, for example, 
should use race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status measures relevant to their 
population.

and ethnic minorities with a higher prevalence of tobacco use that 
may  warrant  assessment  (eg,  Maori  in  New  Zealand,34 Ta  Oi  and 
Bru Van Kieu in Vietnam,35 Jung Po in China36). When appropriate, 
use  terms/categories  that  are  more  accurate  and  specific  (“Korean 
American” vs. “Asian American”). Avoid terms that may be offensive 

or “othering” (eg, “nonwhite”).24 If comparing racial/ethnic groups, 
describe  the  rationale  used  to  determine  the  reference  group  (eg, 
group at highest risk).

Measurement of race and ethnicity in TUD treatment research is 
important for monitoring racial/ethnic disparities in treatment out-
comes. Research is needed that also assesses the sociopolitical factors 
that  contribute  to  these  disparities.  Understanding  and  addressing 
the causes of racial/ethnic disparities in TUD treatment outcomes—
for  example,  racism—is  critical  for  advancing  equity.  Naming  and 
assessing the underlying power systems and structures that produce 
racial/ethnic  disparities  in  treatment  outcomes  may  also  help  to 
overcome faulty assumptions that differences in outcomes are bio-
logically  driven.  If  race/ethnicity  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  other  con-
structs, provide a rationale for this decision.

Categorizing  individuals  by  race  and  ethnicity  may  provide  a 
false  sense  of  homogeneity  within  racial/ethnic  groups.  Although 
some studies may not have sufficient resources or access to a large 
sample, when possible conduct sampling so there is adequate sample 
size  to  examine  heterogeneity  within  racial/ethnic  groups.  TUD 
treatments  that  are  designed  for  particular  racial  or  ethnic  groups 
may  have  limited  effectiveness  if  they  assume  homogeneity  within 
racial/ethnic groups. Manley37 notes that an individual’s racial clas-
sification  provides  no  information  about  an  individual’s  cultural 
experiences. Examining differences in treatment outcomes within ra-
cial/ethnic groups may provide insight into targets for intervention.

Socioeconomic Status

Definition
SES is defined as a relative position in a hierarchical social structure, 
based on access to or control over wealth or power.38

Assessment
Several  publications  provide  guidance  on  the  measurement  of  SES 
in  health-related  research  and  discuss  strengths  and  limitations  of 
different approaches.38,39 TUD treatment researchers have employed 
highly variable definitions and measurement of SES. Although self-
reported income and education are commonly used measures of US 
SES, US studies operationalize SES differently. For example, low SES 
may be defined by some based on an income relative to the federal 
poverty level and by others as an income below a certain threshold 
(eg, ≤$10 000).40,41

Other measures of SES used in TUD disorder treatment research 
include  occupation,  employment,  insurance  coverage,  financial 
strain, and composite indices that combine multiple SES measures. 
Some  studies  report  a  sample  is  socioeconomically  disadvantaged 
based on participants’ enrollment in publicly subsidized healthcare 
programs, attendance at safety-net hospitals, or based on residence 
in  subsidized  housing. These  definitions  coincide  with  recruitment 
location.

Recommendations
There is no single best indicator of SES that can be used in all TUD 
treatment research. Rather, we recommend that measurement of SES 
be guided by its relevance to the study population and study ques-
tions and outcomes. When the SES of study participants is central to 
a study, researchers should explain how this demographic character-
istic plays an important role.24

Commonly  used  measures  of  SES  such  as  education,  income, 
and occupation reflect access to different types of power and social

benefits.38  A  study  focused  on  examining  the  impact  of  economic 
resources on TUD treatment outcomes, for example, may be better 
suited using annual household income as a measure of SES as op-
posed  to  an  individual’s  occupation  because  income  may  more 
directly assess economic resources. If measures of income and edu-
cation  are  similarly  appropriate  for  the  study,  education  is  recom-
mended.  There  is  often  a  high  rate  of  nonresponse  for  questions 
about income.42

The life stage of the study population should also inform the SES 
measure used.43 For example, an occupation-based indicator of SES 
may be less relevant for the elderly in the US because a minority of 
the  elderly  remain  in  the  workforce.44  Although  occupation-based 
indicators of SES are commonly used in studies of adults conducted 
in  European  countries  these  measures  have  been  critiqued.38,39,45 
Occupational  classes  often  consist  of  a  range  of  occupations  with 
varying income, prestige, and benefits. Also, these measures do not 
consider potential heterogeneity in benefits that may arise from em-
ployment  within  occupational  categories  due  to  race/ethnicity  or 
gender.38 See Table 1 for sample items to assess SES.

Mental Health Concerns

Definitions
We will refer to individuals with “mental health concerns” to refer 
broadly  to  individuals  with  psychiatric  diagnoses  or  self-reported 
psychiatric symptoms but not to individuals with alcohol and other 
nontobacco  substance  use  disorders.  “Transdiagnostic  assessment 
measures”  refers  to  measures  of  emotional  vulnerabilities  that  are 
applicable across multiple diagnostic categories.

Assessment (see Supplemental Table 1)
Mental Health Variables Among Individuals Who Smoke
Unless there is a specific hypothesis about mental health or the sample 
was selected for mental health diagnoses or symptoms, few studies 
report mental health data. Treatment researchers can assess mental 
health  status  through  a  variety  of  procedures  and  choices  should 
be guided by the study’s inclusion/exclusion criteria, methods, and 
hypotheses. Options include clinician-administered diagnostic inter-
views, self-report psychological symptom screeners and measures of 
distress, and transdiagnostic assessment measures.

Diagnostic  interviews  are  the  most  comprehensive  assessments, 
providing treatment researchers with formal psychiatric diagnoses. 
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) is the gold-
standard  diagnostic  assessment,46  and  the  research  version  (SCID-
5-RV) is flexible and customizable, allowing researchers to examine 
diagnoses  of  interest  consistent  with  research  needs.47 The  SCID-5 
can take a considerable amount of time to complete, is proprietary 
and carries a fee for use, and is intended for use by a trained mental 
health  professional,  limiting  its  utility  in  some  settings. The World 
Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International 
Diagnostic  Interview  (WHO  WMH-CIDI),  based  on  ICD-10  and 
DSM-IV diagnoses, is another gold-standard assessment which can 
be administered by trained lay interviewers and professionals.48 The 
WHO WMH-CIDI is available in many languages and is in the public 
domain; however, training at a certified training site is required and 
carries  a  fee.  Similarly,  the  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric 
Interview  (MINI)  assesses  common  psychiatric  diagnoses.49  The 
MINI is intended to be a briefer assessment and can be administered 
by  research  staff;  however,  this  is  also  a  proprietary  measure  and 
there is a fee associated with its use. The SCID-5, WHO WMH-CIDI, 

and MINI have been translated for use by non-English speakers. Two 
newer semi-structured interviews include the Diagnostic Assessment 
Research Tool (DART)50 and the Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, 
Mood,  and  Obsessive-Compulsive  and  Related  Neuropsychiatric 
Disorders  (DIAMOND).51 The  DIAMOND  is  intended  for  use  by 
mental  health  professionals,  can  be  administered  during  a  briefer 
timeframe  and  is  free  for  researchers  who  complete  required 
training. Like the DIAMOND, the DART is free to use and briefer 
than  the  SCID  and  WMH-CIDI.  Unlike  the  DIAMOND,  there  is 
no official training requirement before its use—though the authors 
state that it is intended to be used by trained professionals who are 
knowledgeable  about  diagnostic  assessment  and  psychopathology. 
Each of the diagnostic assessments demonstrates good reliability and 
validity49,52–54 and high specificity and sensitivity.49,52 Because it is so 
new, only preliminary data on the DART has been published50; how-
ever, most modules appear to have strong construct, convergent, and 
discriminant validity and high rates of inter-rater agreement.

Psychological  symptom  screeners  and  measures  of  distress  can 
be  used  to  assess  disorder-specific  symptoms  (eg,  anxiety-related 
symptoms) or provide a more general summary of psychological dis-
tress or impairment. The PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ)  is  used  to  assess  current  symptoms,  and,  importantly,  the 
severity  of  symptoms,  associated  with  depression,  anxiety,  eating 
pathology,  and  somatoform  disorder.55  The  PHQ  has  excellent 
validity  and  high  sensitivity  and  specificity55  with  respect  to  diag-
noses and researchers can also use subsections of the PHQ to assess 
diagnoses of interest. The most commonly used are those assessing 
generalized  anxiety  disorder  symptoms  (GAD-7)  and  depression 
symptoms (PHQ-9), each of which demonstrates good validity and 
reliability and high specificity and sensitivity.56,57 It is important to 
have a process in place for quickly identifying, and addressing, sui-
cidal ideation when using a measure such as the PHQ-9 which as-
sesses for thoughts of death or of hurting oneself. Finally, the Kessler 
Psychological Distress Scale (K6), a brief self-report measure, can be 
used to screen for serious psychological distress and impairment.58 
The K6 has been demonstrated to have high concordance with CIDI 
diagnoses of serious mental illness in several countries.59

Some  psychological  symptoms  are  common  across  multiple 
diagnoses  (ie,  are  “transdiagnostic”);  recent  evidence  suggests 
that  transdiagnostic  vulnerabilities,  such  as  distress  intolerance, 
anxiety  sensitivity,  and  anhedonia,  may  serve  as  a  link  between 
mood  and  emotional  disorders  and  smoking.  Researchers  can  use 
transdiagnostic vulnerabilities assessments to guide TUD treatment 
and  help  explain  differential  treatment  responses  (eg,  high  vs.  low 
anxiety sensitivity) and mechanisms of change during treatment (ie, 
smoking  reduction  via  increasing  distress  tolerance).  The  Distress 
Tolerance Scale (DTS), a widely used measure of distress tolerance, 
measures an individual’s perceived ability to withstand distress. The 
factor structure of the DTS has been validated in people who smoke 
cigarettes and demonstrates good internal consistency.60 The Anxiety 
Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), which examines an individual’s focus on 
anxiety-related  symptoms  and  perceived  harm  from  consequences 
of anxiety-related symptoms, is also validated in people who smoke 
cigarettes61  and  has  high  internal  consistency.  Finally,  measures  of 
anhedonia  can  be  used  to  examine  an  individual’s  inability  to  ex-
perience pleasure (ie, consummatory anhedonia) or an individual’s 
expected experience of pleasure from typically pleasant activities (ie, 
anticipatory  anhedonia).  Importantly,  anticipatory  anhedonia  has 
recently been posited as a potential nicotine withdrawal symptom.62 
Measures to assess anhedonia include the Snaith Hamilton Pleasure 

Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2022, Vol. 24, No. 5

649

Scale  (SHAPS)  and  the  Temporal  Experience  of  Pleasure  Scale 
(TEPS),  each  of  which  demonstrates  strong  psychometric  proper-
ties.63,64  Each  of  the  transdiagnostic  measures  described  above  are 
available in the public domain.

Tobacco Use Among Individuals With Mental Health Concerns
An additional concern related to TUD research is the effect of mental 
health  concerns  on  reporting  patterns  of  key  tobacco-related  out-
comes and the extent to which those outcomes (and existing cutoffs) 
are valid for these groups. There are several aspects of tobacco use, 
dependence, and cessation that are likely influenced by mental health 
symptoms. For example, in some of the authors’ data of adults with 
serious mental illness who smoke cigarettes, baseline assessments of 
nicotine withdrawal (ie, assessed while still smoking) looked similar 
to withdrawal symptoms reported by general population adults who 
smoke cigarettes after 24-hours of abstinence (ie, actually experien-
cing withdrawal).65 Commonly used measures of nicotine withdrawal 
may not adequately differentiate between true withdrawal symptoms 
and  mental  health  symptoms;  specifically,  affective  components  of 
withdrawal  (eg,  anxiety,  depressed  mood,  and  irritability);  and  are 
likely to over-estimate true withdrawal symptoms. This suggests that 
treatment  researchers  should  assess  withdrawal  at  baseline  (even 
though research participants are still smoking) and examine change 
scores from baseline to follow-up as a better indicator of withdrawal. 
On the other hand, the most commonly used measure of cigarette de-
pendence, the Fagerström Test of Cigarette Dependence (FTCD)66,67 
may  underestimate  dependence  in  some  patients  with  psychiatric 
symptoms.68  For  example,  one  of  the  six  FTCD  items  asks “How 
soon after waking do you smoke your first cigarette?” Given the as-
sociation between sleep disturbance and mental health symptoms,69 
study participants may endorse waiting a long time before smoking 
their first cigarette of the morning because they smoked in the middle 
of the night, rather than because of low dependence.

Recommendations
Given  that  those  with  mental  health  concerns  are  more  likely  to 
smoke  cigarettes  and  less  likely  to  quit,  it  is  imperative  that  to-
bacco  treatment  researchers  assess  mental  health  concerns  in  their 
studies. An  important  caveat  (not  unique  to  mental  health  assess-
ment or psychologists, but especially relevant here) is to follow the 
guidelines  of  the  American  Psychological  Association  suggesting 
that “Psychologists who conduct psychological testing, assessment, 
and evaluation strive to practice with cultural competence.” (p. 18, 
American  Psychological  Association70)  and  that  “Psychologists 
who  conduct  psychological  testing,  assessment,  and  evaluation  as-
pire to ensure awareness of individual differences, various forms of 
biases or potential biases, cultural attitudes, population appropriate 
norms, and potential misuse of data.” (p. 19, American Psychological 
Association70).

Clinician-administered  diagnostic 

interviews  are  the  gold 
standard  for  the  assessment  of  specific  psychiatric  diagnoses  in 
treatment research focusing on tobacco users with a mental health 
condition.  Benefits  of  clinician-administered  interviews  include 
more accurate diagnosis. However, the cost, training requirements, 
and  time  to  administer  may  limit  their  use  in  certain  contexts  (eg, 
survey  research)  and  these  factors,  along  with  inclusion/exclusion 
criteria  and  study  hypotheses,  should  guide  researchers’  measure-
ment choices.

It  may  be  useful  to  pair  the  semi-structured  clinical  interview 
with  relevant  symptom  severity  measures  to  quantify  the  severity 

of the symptoms, rather than simply confirming a specific diagnosis. 
This may provide opportunities to examine more nuanced relation-
ships between psychiatric symptoms and cessation and examine the 
influence  of  a  range  of  symptoms  including  those  that  are  less  se-
vere or otherwise do not satisfy diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, to-
bacco  treatment  researchers  who  are  not  focusing  on  a  particular 
set  of  disorders  may  be  more  interested  in  including  symptom  se-
verity  measures  (eg,  PHQ-9,  GAD-7)  to  evaluate  symptoms  that 
commonly co-occur with tobacco use without using more cost- and 
time-consuming semi-structured interviews.

Alternatively,  tobacco  treatment  researchers  may  wish  to  focus 
on transdiagnostic factors that are relevant across a wide range of 
psychiatric disorders and which are implicated in tobacco initiation, 
maintenance,  and  relapse  (eg,  DTS,60  ASI-3,61  SHAPS,64  TEPS63). 
These measures may help guide treatment delivery and serve as po-
tential moderators and mediators of change.

Unless  researchers  are  excluding  potential  participants,  who 
have specific symptoms or disorders, it should be assumed that in-
dividuals with mental health symptoms are represented—and likely 
overrepresented—among  participants  in  TUD  treatment  studies. 
Even if the main focus of a study is not related to mental health con-
cerns,  tobacco  researchers  should  include  measures  that  can  char-
acterize the sample with respect to mental health (eg, the very brief 
K6 to identify nonspecific psychological distress). By failing to assess 
mental health concerns, the field is missing the opportunity to fully 
describe  participants,  understand  the  context  of  tobacco-related 
variables (eg, withdrawal, dependence), examine the mediators and 
moderators  that  will  help  the  field  better  understand  why  and  for 
whom our interventions work, and make interventions more effica-
cious and thus improve treatment delivery. Given the importance of 
assessing mental health status and the accessibility of these assess-
ments (see Supplemental Table 1), widespread adoption by treatment 
researchers is attainable.

Overall Recommendations and Conclusions

Measure and Report the Assessment of Tobacco-
Related Priority Groups in TUD Treatment 
Research Studies
When planning and implementing studies, researchers should adopt 
best practices in their assessments to ensure subgroups are properly 
identified, assessed, and described. As there tend to be multiple ap-
propriate approaches to assessing these priority groups, tobacco re-
searchers  should  choose  corresponding  measures  based  on  factors 
such  as  the  research  hypotheses,  the  population  of  interest,  study 
burden (eg, shorter vs. longer measures), and availability of research 
funds  (eg,  proprietary  vs.  public  domain  measures).  Language  re-
lated to these priority groups can change over time, so it is important 
to  incorporate  updates  in  language  and  assessment  recommenda-
tions. For example, in a 2020 report,13 the US National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that the Federal 
Interagency Working Group on Improving Measurement of Sexual 
Orientation and Gender Identity in Federal Surveys be reconvened to 
develop new standards for assessment that could be used across the 
country. Even if a study does not intend to examine these subgroups 
in hypothesis testing when disseminating results, the assessment of 
individual difference variables should be clearly explained (eg, listing 
all response options for a variable in the Methods section or as sup-
plemental  information  when  using  non-standardized  measures  or 
measures that have been adapted for the purpose of the study) and 

650

Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 2022, Vol. 24, No. 5

sample  characteristics  should  be  described  comprehensively  (eg,  in 
a  demographics  table  and/or  the  Sample  Characteristics  section  of 
the Results). Providing this descriptive information can help readers 
better judge the generalizability of the findings.

Moderators and Mediators
Various quantitative tools exist that can further our understanding 
of priority groups in TUD treatment research. To help describe dif-
ferential  treatment  response  between  demographic  groups,  moder-
ation  analyses  (ie,  interaction  analyses)  can  compare  intervention 
effectiveness  between  subgroups.  At  the  outset  in  grant  proposals 
and study protocols, it is important to adequately power the study 
to examine outcomes across demographic subgroups. When a priori 
power analyses were not conducted, effect sizes and confidence inter-
vals could be presented separately by subgroups of interest and la-
beled  as  exploratory,  which  could  be  included  in  meta-analyses  or 
serve as the basis for future adequately powered research.

Research that identifies underlying mechanisms that explain group 
differences in the efficacy and effectiveness of TUD treatment is needed. 
While the priority groups we describe have differential smoking and 
treatment outcomes, these differences may be due to factors related 
to systems of privilege and oppression (eg, racism). See Refs. 71,72 for 
information about macro-level factors (eg, access to and experiences 
with  healthcare,  geographic  segregation,  discrimination)  and  Ref.  73 
for a detailed framework for assessing social determinants of health. 
Pearson  et  al.71  also  provide  some  recommendations  on  the  assess-
ment of macro-level variables in tobacco research. By evaluating these 
mechanisms directly using mediation analyses, for example, it is pos-
sible to identify modifiable factors that could be targeted in interven-
tions to improve treatment efficacy, effectiveness, and health equity.

Intersectionality
Intersectionality  has  a  long  history  rooted  in  Black  feminist  scholar-
ship and activism, first recognizing that racism and sexism are inter-
connected.74–76 More recently, intersectionality, which recognizes that 
systems  of  privilege  and  oppression  are  interconnected  and  produce 
overlapping  experiences  of  oppression  and  disadvantage  for  people 
with intersecting minoritized identities (based on social categories such 
as  race,  class,  gender  identity,  and  sexual  orientation),  has  been  dis-
cussed as a useful framework for understanding and intervening upon 
public  health  problems  and  disparities.77–79  Some  studies  of  smoking 
behavior and TUD treatment have begun to examine disparities among 
individuals whose identities intersect across multiple minoritized social 
groups.80–82 However, the tobacco treatment field is in the early stages 
of applying and using intersectionality; measuring and analyzing mul-
tiple intersecting  identities is complex and current methods may not 
be  reflective  of  a  truly  intersectional  approach.83 The  application  of 
intersectionality as a theoretical framework that centers the voices and 
lived experiences of those who have been minoritized due to historical 
and  interlocking  macro-level  systems  of  power84,85  may  help  practi-
tioners, researchers, and policymakers better understand and intervene 
upon disparities in tobacco use and TUD treatment. See Etherington 
et al.86 for a detailed example of how an intersectionality lens can be 
incorporated into intervention development research.

Recognizing Mistrust and Engaging Communities in 
TUD Treatment Research
Research  procedures  (eg,  recruitment  and  retention,  study  visit 
procedures)  should  be  equitable,  inclusive,  and  affirming  to  all 

participants.  Given  the  history  and  ongoing  harm  that  healthcare 
systems, academic institutions, and researchers have perpetuated, it 
is also important for the public health field to “dismantle mistrust 
by acknowledging the role we have played in maintaining damaging 
power  dynamics  and  perpetuating  mistrust”  (p.  193).87  As  such, 
community-engaged  and  community-based  participatory  research 
that focuses on the strengths of priority populations and works with 
(rather than on) communities through equitable partnerships to set 
and intervene upon health priorities through research, interventions, 
and policy is needed.23,88 A community-based participatory research 
approach  can  be  used  to  develop  smoking  cessation  programs  for 
priority groups (see Ref.  89 for a review and Ref.  90 for an example 
of  using  a  community-based  participatory  research  approach  for 
tobacco and cancer control in an Asian-American community). See 
Refs. 91,92 for more information about conducting community-based 
participatory  research. Additionally,  working  with  communities  to 
adopt  recruitment  methods  that  help  foster  representation93,94  and 
address  practical  barriers  to  participation  is  necessary.  Finally,  re-
searchers must also fairly compensate communities and participants 
for their time and expertise.

Limitations

First, as mentioned in the Introduction, this paper includes a non-
exhaustive  list  of  priority  groups  experiencing  tobacco-related 
disparities.  Additional  groups  including  other  demographics  (eg, 
age,  rurality),  people  with  medical  co-morbidities  (eg,  HIV),  and 
those  with  alcohol/substance  use  disorders  should  be  considered 
in treatment research (eg, Refs. 95–97). Second, we focused on cigar-
ette smoking treatment; however, the use of other tobacco products 
can also differ between these groups.5,98,99 Research on treatments 
for  non-cigarette  tobacco  products  and  tobacco  product  polyuse 
by  priority  subgroups  is  also  needed.  Third,  we  do  not  provide 
an  exhaustive  list  of  valid  approaches  for  assessing  priority  sub-
groups.  For  example,  PhenX  includes  a  range  of  assessments  of 
demographics,  social  determinants  of  health,  substance  use,  and 
mental health concerns and the RDoC (Research Domain Criteria 
Initiative; 
https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-
by-nimh/rdoc/index.shtml) focuses on the measurement of mental 
health  concerns  and  related  constructs.  Fourth,  while  this  paper 
focuses primarily on US literature and considerations, and it was 
outside the scope of this paper to cover the full global literature, 
there are global differences in terms and guidelines used to describe 
subgroups  (eg,  racial  and  ethnic  groups)  and  definitions  of  sub-
groups  (eg,  classifying  SES)  as  well  as  other  considerations  that 
differ across countries (eg, stigma and legal issues related to SGM 
status). There are also global differences in the burden of tobacco 
(eg,  increasing  burden  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries)  and 
tobacco-related factors such as patterns of use of specific tobacco 
products.100,101 These factors must all be considered by the research 
community.102,103

Conclusions

There is a lack of research on TUD treatments for priority groups 
disproportionately  affected  by  smoking  and  related  disease. 
Accurately assessing and including these groups in research will pro-
vide  needed  information  about  efficacious,  effective,  and  equitable 
treatments, a critical element to reducing tobacco-related disparities 
and advancing equity in tobacco control.
