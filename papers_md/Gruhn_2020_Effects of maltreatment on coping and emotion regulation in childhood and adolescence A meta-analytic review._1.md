Effects of maltreatment on coping and emotion regulation in 
childhood and adolescence: A meta-analytic review

Abstract

Background:  Child maltreatment is consistently linked to adverse mental and physical health 
problems, making the identification of risk and resilience processes crucial for prevention efforts. 
The ways that individuals cope and regulate emotions in response to stress may buffer against 
pre-existing risk, while deficits in these processes have the potential to amplify risk. Thus, a 
candidate mechanism to explain the association between early-life abuse and neglect and later 
maladjustment is the way in which previously-maltreated youth respond to stress throughout 
development.

Objective:  The current review provides a quantitative analysis of the impact of early-life 
maltreatment on coping and emotion regulation processes during childhood and adolescence (5–18 
years).

Methods:  Thirty-five studies (N = 11,344) met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Effect 
sizes were calculated between maltreatment and broad domains (e.g., "emotion dysregulation"), 
intermediate factors (e.g., "problem-focused coping"), and specific strategies (e.g., "emotional 
suppression") of coping and emotion regulation.

Results:  Maltreatment was significantly related to decreased emotion regulation (r = −.24, p < 
.001) and increased emotion dysregulation (r = .28, p < .001) at the domain level. No significant 
findings emerged at the factor level. At the strategy level, maltreatment was significantly related to 
increased avoidance (r = .25, p < .001), emotional suppression (r = .24, p < .001), and emotional 
expression (r = .25, p < .001).

Conclusions:  Results indicate that maltreatment is broadly associated with poor emotion 
regulation as well as increased avoidance, emotional suppression, and expression of negative 
emotions in response to stress. Implications of these findings are discussed and an agenda for 
future research is proposed.

Introduction

Experiences of childhood abuse and neglect are linked to morbidity, mortality, and virtually 
all forms of psychopathology across the lifespan (Norman et al., 2012). Further, mental 
health disorders tend to emerge earlier with greater severity, higher rates of comorbidity, and 
less favorable responses to treatment for individuals with maltreatment histories compared 
to their non-maltreated counterparts (Álvarez et al., 2011; Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012). 
Identifying mechanisms of risk and resilience within individuals who have experienced 
abuse and/or neglect is vital in order to bolster prevention and early-intervention efforts for 
this high-risk population.

Stress exposure is the most potent risk factor for psychopathology during childhood, 
adolescence, and adulthood, and a substantial body of research suggests that effects are 
amassed across the lifespan (Chapman et al., 2004; Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002; 
Starr, Hammen, Conway, Raposa, & Brennan, 2014). Cumulative risk models highlight that 
exposure to stress in adolescence may be particularly predictive of mental health problems 
for individuals who have experienced childhood maltreatment, including sexual abuse, 
physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect and/or emotional neglect (Appleyard, 
Egeland, van Dulmen, & Sroufe, 2005). Given that stressful experiences cannot be 
realistically avoided as a means of preventing maladjustment, the ways in which individuals 
respond to stress have important implications, as they have the potential to either buffer 
against or to amplify risk (Compas et al., 2017). For example, an adolescent who is able 
to engage in cognitive reappraisal when he hears his parents fighting (e.g., “it is normal 
for people to argue,” “it isn’t my job to fix their problems”) is less likely to retain and 
internalize negative feelings than an adolescent who engages in denial (e.g., “this isn’t 
happening”) or emotional suppression (e.g., “I won’t show anyone that I am upset”). 
Although one such instance is unlikely to have long term consequences, the accumulation 
of stressful experiences and associated responses may alter the course of adjustment over 
time. Investigating how early experiences of abuse and/or neglect impact the types of coping 
and emotion regulation strategies that individuals employ in the face of stress, therefore, is 
integral to understanding risk pathways in individuals who have experienced maltreatment.

Previous studies have examined stress responses as a risk factor for psychopathology, 
yet relatively little is known about how maltreatment relates to the specific coping and 
regulation strategies that individuals acquire and use. The current review addresses this gap 
by providing the first quantitative meta-analysis of the impact of childhood maltreatment 
on coping and emotion regulation processes at the strategy, factor, and domain levels 
in childhood and adolescence. First, the constructs of coping and emotion regulation are 
defined, followed by a discussion of the theoretical and empirical framework of the relation 
between maltreatment and controlled stress responses. Next, in the primary section of 
this review, meta-analytic results of associations between early-life abuse and neglect and 
subsequent coping and emotion regulation efforts are presented. Finally, a critique of the 
current state of the field is offered and an agenda for future research is proposed.

2.  Coping and emotion regulation

2.1.  Conceptualization of coping and emotion regulation

Coping and emotion regulation, at the broadest level, both refer to cognitive and behavioral 
strategies that individuals employ in response to an internal or external experience. Coping 
has been defined as conscious, volitional efforts to regulate emotion, cognition, behavior, 
physiology, and the environment in response to stress (Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman, 
Thomsen, & Wadsworth, 2001). Emotion regulation has been defined as the process by 
which individuals influence the occurrence, timing, nature, experience, and expression of 
their emotions (Gross, 2013). Although closely related, these constructs differ in that coping 
exclusively refers to responses to stress, whereas emotion regulation includes efforts to 
manage emotions under a wider range of stressful and non-stressful situations. Additionally, 
emotion regulation includes both controlled and automatic processes whereas coping 
encompasses only controlled, effortful processes. Finally, coping may include a wider array 
of goal-directed regulatory efforts (e.g., coping with academic stress via problem-solving 
with the end goal of receiving a good grade) whereas emotion regulation efforts generally 
focus on the goal of changing one’s own emotional experience.

While each construct provides unique information, the current review examines the 
controlled, purposeful strategies of both coping and emotion regulation simultaneously to 
provide a more complete picture of stress response patterns in youth. We exclude automatic 
emotion regulation processes in the current study for several reasons. First, controlled 
processes reflect cognitive and behavioral strategies that are purposefully employed; thus, 
they may be more accessible to conscious awareness, improving the validity of self-
report (Compas et al., 2017). Second, controlled processes can be more readily changed 
through psychosocial interventions, increasing the clinical relevance of the present findings 
(e.g., Lenz, 2015; Tein, Sandler, Ayers, & Wolchik, 2006). Third, automatic emotion 
regulation processes overlap with processes of physiologic stress reactivity, which represent 
a conceptually different phenomenon that is biologically rather than cognitively driven 
(Cicchetti, 2016). Finally, coping and emotion regulation have largely been examined within 
separate bodies of work (Compas et al., 2014). By isolating controlled processes, previous 
findings can fit into an integrated theoretical and empirical framework focused on how 
maltreatment impacts intentional responses to stress.

Although the effectiveness of each coping and regulation strategy depends on many factors 
(e.g., the nature of the stressor, cognitive capacity of the individual), Compas et al. (2017) 
conducted a quantitative meta-analysis that provides a foundation for understanding how 
controlled stress responses may heighten or mitigate risk for psychosocial problems in 
children and adolescents. Analyses of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) indicated 
that primary control coping (i.e., efforts to directly act on the source of stress or one’s 
emotions, including problem solving and emotional expression) and secondary control 
coping (i.e., efforts to adapt to the source of stress, including acceptance and cognitive 
reappraisal) were significantly related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology, 
while disengagement coping (i.e., efforts to orient away from the source of stress or one’s 
emotions, including avoidance or denial) and emotional suppression (i.e., efforts to dampen

internal or external experiences and/or expressions of emotion) were predictive of higher 
levels of psychopathology symptoms. These findings suggest that certain indices of coping 
and emotion regulation utilized by children and adolescents may serve as protective factors 
against stressful experiences while others increase risk.

2.2.  Coping, emotion regulation, and maltreatment

Families provide one of the most powerful and salient contexts of stress, coping, 
and emotion regulation during development, placing maltreated youth at an extreme 
disadvantage for acquiring adaptive self-regulation strategies. Conceptual models (e.g., 
Kliewer et al., 1994; Morris, Silk, Steinberg, Myers, & Robinson, 2007) and an emerging 
body of empirical work (e.g., Monti, Rudolph, & Abaied, 2014; Watson et al., 2014) suggest 
that the acquisition of coping and regulation strategies is learned through interpersonal 
interactions between caregivers and children,including direct communication, modeling, and 
expressions of support and warmth. Victims of early-life abuse and/or neglect may therefore 
fail to acquire coping and emotion regulation strategies that protect against the development 
of psychosocial problems (e.g., primary and secondary control coping) due to (a) decreased 
exposure to healthy examples of coping and emotion regulation, and/or (b) increased 
exposure to maladaptive stress response processes, such as violence (Kim & Cicchetti, 
2010). Further, evidence suggests that children may be most sensitive to coping socialization 
efforts during times of significant challenge (Abaied & Rudolph, 2011). Experiences of 
early-life maltreatment may therefore create a ‘double-hit,’ such that children lack input 
on how to respond appropriately to stressful experiences while simultaneously being faced 
with stressors far out of their developmental capacity to handle (e.g., physical abuse, sexual 
abuse). Because of this discrepancy, youth who have been maltreated may not only fail 
to acquire optimal regulation strategies, but also learn strategies such as avoidance, denial, 
wishful thinking, or emotional suppression. Although adaptive in the short-term, these 
strategies may increase psychosocial risk when carried forward throughout development 
and used in normative situations of lower threat (Abaied & Rudolph, 2011; Compas et 
al., 2017). A recent study by Milojevich, Levine, Cathcart, and Quas (2018) aligned with 
this conceptualization, finding that maltreated youth endorsed significantly higher use of 
disengagement and antisocial strategies compared to their nonmaltreated peers. Milojevich 
et al. posit that this finding may result from learned helplessness due to experiences of abuse 
and neglect and youth’s resulting attempts to distance themselves from stressors rather than 
to confront them.

Previous work has established coping and emotion regulation as important mediators in the 
maltreatment-psychopathology relationship (e.g., Jennissen, Holl, Mai, Wolff, & Barnow, 
2016). However, most studies have examined these processes broadly (e.g., “emotion 
dysregulation”) and have not isolated and examined the direct path from early-life abuse 
and neglect to later coping or emotion regulation strategies. Thus, consensus in the field is 
that maltreatment is linked to maladaptive coping and poor emotion regulation which, in 
turn, leads to negative mental health outcomes. Without an understanding of the specific 
stress response subtypes and strategies employed by previously maltreated youth, we are 
unable to inform efforts to target and correct coping and emotion regulation deficits in this 
population.

3.  The present study: meta-analysis

This meta-analytic review represents a comprehensive, empirical assessment of 
maltreatment and coping and emotion regulation during childhood and adolescence. The 
goal of this study is to synthesize findings from past research in order to elucidate patterns 
between experiences of abuse and neglect in childhood and subsequent controlled/volitional 
efforts to respond to stress. Results will reveal whether there is evidence linking early-life 
maltreatment to specific subtypes of coping and emotion regulation in school-age youth 
and highlight important directions for future research. Given previous findings that deficits 
in stress response strategies can be remediated via teaching coping and emotion regulation 
skills (e.g., Compas et al., 2010, Lenz, 2015), investigating the effects of abuse and neglect 
on specific categories of coping and emotion regulation is a crucial to inform prevention 
efforts.

4.  Method

4.1.  Study selection

This meta-analysis includes original, peer-reviewed papers meeting the following criteria: 
(i) data were collected on a sample of school-age children and adolescents (i.e., mean age 
between 5 and 18 years old); (ii) some or all of the sample experienced maltreatment, 
including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional 
neglect; (iii) coping or emotion regulation was assessed using a reliable measure; and (iv) 
an effect (i.e., correlation coefficient, beta weight, or means and standard deviations) was 
presented for the relationship between maltreatment and coping or emotion regulation.

4.2.  Data sources

Articles published prior to January 1, 2020 were obtained from a PsycINFO search of 
Scholarly Journals (source type) using search criteria: if(maltreatment* OR abuse* OR 
neglect*) AND if(coping* OR regulation*). This search yielded 892 studies and was 
supplemented by reviewing the reference sections of published meta-analyses on related 
processes (Bernard, Frost, Bennett, & Lindhiem, 2017; Lavi, Katz, Ozer, & Gross, 2019), 
which yielded an additional 7 articles that met inclusion criteria. Articles were excluded for 
the following reasons: sample was out of the age range, article did not report on an empirical 
study, maltreatment and coping or emotion regulation were not measured, no reliability data 
were provided for the measure of coping/emotion regulation, or data on the association 
between maltreatment and coping/emotion regulation was not presented or was incompatible 
with the meta-analytic format (e.g., descriptive statistics; frequency analyses). In total, 35 
articles met inclusion criteria (see Fig. 1 for Prisma Flow Diagram).

4.3.  Data coding procedure

Each study was coded for coping/emotion regulation category, statistics on the relationship 
between maltreatment and coping/emotion regulation, and descriptive data (e.g., sample 
size, mean age, year of publication, percent of female subjects, description of sample). 
Given the variability in labels and measurement tools used to assess coping and emotion 
regulation across studies, the organizational framework used by Compas et al. (2017)

was employed to categorize stress responses. Domains of coping and emotion regulation 
represent the broadest level of measurement, where heterogeneous strategies cluster under 
categories of total coping, emotion regulation, adaptive coping, emotion dysregulation, 
emotion regulation, maladaptive coping, and total coping. This level has been only 
distinguished as “adaptive” versus “maladaptive,” or “regulation” versus “dysregulation,” 
on an a priori basis. Second, factors of coping/emotion regulation include measures of 
approach/ engagement, disengagement coping, emotion-focused, primary control coping, 
problem-focused, secondary control coping, and social support. While this intermediate 
level of categorization continues to include a range of strategies, these factors are more 
homogeneous than those composing the broad domains. Several of these factors have 
been supported using confirmatory factor analysis (e.g., primary control, secondary control, 
disengagement coping; Connor-Smith, Compas, Wadsworth, Thomsen, & Saltzman, 2000). 
The third level consists of specific strategies, which include acceptance, avoidance, cognitive 
reappraisal, denial, distraction, emotional expression, emotional modulation, emotional 
suppression, humor, problem solving, unregulated release of emotions, and wishful thinking. 
Categories relevant to the present meta-analysis (i.e., at least 1 study met inclusion criteria 
assessed the domain, factor, or strategy category) are presented in Table 1.

4.4.  Data analytic procedure

All analyses were conducted with the Comprehensive Meta- Analysis program, Version 3 
(Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2014), using study as the unit of analysis and the 
mean of the selected outcomes. Because studies varied in design and methodology, random 
effects models were employed. The mean effect size for each study (r) was the level of 
analysis; thus, if a single study tested associations between multiple abuse types and/or 
multiple stress responses within the same category, a mean effect size was calculated. Cohen 
(1988) guidelines were used to interpret the magnitude of the effect size for significant 
correlations (i.e., r = .10 represents a small effect, r = .30 as medium, and .50 or above as 
large).

Correlations or mean differences were entered into the meta-analysis where reported. If 
only standardized regression coefficients (betas) were reported, the recommendation by 
Peterson and Brown (2005) was followed such that β was converted to r using the formula 
r = β + .05λ, where λ = 0 when β is negative and λ = 1 when β is nonnegative, as 
successfully employed in other recent meta-analyses (e.g., Compas et al., 2017; Robles, 
Slatcher, Trombello, & McGinn, 2014). A threshold of three minimum studies (k = 3) was 
set to estimate effect sizes.

For each domain, factor, and strategy, weighted mean effect sizes (r), 95 % confidence 
intervals, and heterogeneity statistics (Q) were calculated using the procedures outlined by 
Hedges and Olkin (1985). Because the statistical power of the Q statistic depends on the 
number of studies, with power being very low or very high for a small or a large number 
of studies, respectively, the I2 index is also calculated (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). The I2 
index quantifies the extent of heterogeneity from a collection of effect sizes by comparing 
the Q value to its expected value assuming homogeneity (i.e., to its degrees of freedom [df 
= k – 1]). The 95 % confidence intervals on the effect sizes represent the range in which the

mean effect size falls in 95 % of cases. The calculation for the lower limit of the confidence 
interval is: LLCI = M⋆ ‐ Z V M∗ and the calculation for the upper limit of the confidence 
interval is: ULCI = M⋆ ‐ Z V M∗ where M∗ is the mean effect size in the sample, Z is the 
critical z value representing the confidence level, and V M∗ is the variance of M∗ (Borenstein 
et al., 2014). A mean effect is considered significant when the confidence interval does not 
include zero.

Last, several steps were taken to investigate the possibility of publication bias, which occurs 
as a result of selective publication of research findings based on the magnitude and direction 
of study results. First, funnel plots were visually examined for each significant effect size. 
The funnel plot includes the standard error of each study contributing to the overall effect 
size (a reflection of sample size) on the y axis with the study’s effect estimate on the x 
axis. The effect estimate should be more precise with increasing sample size. In the absence 
of publication bias, effect estimates from studies with smaller sample sizes should be 
scattered symmetrically at the bottom of the plot and center more closely around the mean 
effect estimate at the top of the plot as the sample size increases. Funnel plots will appear 
asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias, suggesting that small samples reporting 
small to nonsignificant effect sizes were less likely to be published. Second, Egger’s tests 
were conducted to assist in funnel plot interpretation, which is a statistical test used to detect 
funnel plot asymmetry (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997). Third, we conducted 
trim and fill analyses (Duval & Tweedie, 2000) to determine how many studies would need 
to be included above or below the meta-analytic mean to make the plot symmetrical. Trim 
and fill analyses also impute the missing studies and calculate adjusted meta-analytic effect 
sizes that account for publication bias.

5.  Results

Based on the inclusion criteria, 35 studies with 11,344 participants were included in analyses 
(see Table 2 for details on included studies). The number of effect sizes ranged from 1 
to 8 per article, providing a total of 81 effects coded for the meta-analysis. Of the coping 
and emotion regulation domains, factors, and strategies assessed, there were an insufficient 
number of studies (k < 3) examining total coping, disengagement coping, primary control 
coping, secondary control coping, social support, problem solving, denial, and distraction to 
calculate effect sizes. However, several categories were subsumed under another “inclusive” 
category, per the coping/emotion regulation structure put forth by Compas et al. (2017) (see 
Table 1). Results of the associations between each inclusive category and maltreatment, 
including the number of studies (k), total sample size (N), mean effect size (r) and 95 % 
confidence interval (95 % CI), and heterogeneity statistics (Q, I2) are reported in Table 3.

5.1.  Domains

Emotion dysregulation (r = .28, p < .001) and emotion regulation (r = −.24, p < .001) 
were both significantly associated with maltreatment history, such that higher levels (or 
presence compared to absence) of childhood abuse and/or neglect was related to increased 
endorsement of emotion dysregulation and decreased endorsement of emotion regulation. 
Both models contained a significant amount of heterogeneity (Q = 54.56, p < .001, I2 =

81.67 % [emotion dysregulation]; Q = 46.75, p < .001, I2 = 72.19 % [emotion regulation]), 
with approximately three quarters of the total variability for each effect size due to between-
study variability. The effect size for total coping was unable to be calculated (k = 1).

5.2.  Factors

Relations between maltreatment and approach/engagement (r = .00), emotion-focused (r = 
.01), and problem-focused (r = −.09) coping were non-significant (ps > .10) and results 
indicate significant heterogeneity for all models; thus, no associations between maltreatment 
and controlled stress responses emerged at the factor level. Categories of disengagement, 
primary control coping, secondary control coping, and social support did not contain enough 
studies to calculate an effect size.

5.3.  Strategies

Avoidance (r = .25), emotional suppression (r = .24), and emotional expression (r = .25) 
were each significantly positively related to maltreatment (p < .001), such that individuals 
who have experienced abuse and/or neglect endorsed greater use of strategies geared 
toward avoiding stressors, suppressing emotions, and/or expressing emotions. Analyses 
indicated significant heterogeneity for avoidance (Q = 75.36, p < .001, I2 = 90.71 %) and 
nonsignificant heterogeneity for emotional suppression and emotional expression, indicating 
minimal between-study variability in studies examining suppression (k = 4) and expression 
(k = 3). Effects for denial, distraction, and problem solving could not be calculated (k < 3).

5.4.  Publication bias

Of the five significant effect sizes, only the effect for emotion regulation produced a 
significant Egger’s test indicating possible publication bias (k = 14, regression intercept 
= −4.14, 95 % CI [-−6.23, −2.06], p < .05). A visual inspection of the funnel plot shows 
possible data asymmetry indicative of bias (see Fig. 2). However, follow-up trim and fill 
analyses suggested no publication bias (i.e., values did not need to be added in order to 
create a symmetrical funnel plot). It is noteworthy that asymmetry was not evident when 
visually inspecting the other four significant effect size estimates.

6.  Discussion

Prior work has established child maltreatment and disruptions in coping and emotion 
regulation as predictors of psychopathology, yet the association between maltreatment 
and coping/emotion regulation is not well understood. The current study synthesizes past 
findings in order to investigate relation between childhood maltreatment and specific 
subtypes of coping and emotion regulation in school-age youth. These findings provide 
preliminary evidence that early-life maltreatment may disrupt general emotion regulation 
processes and promote greater use of avoidance, suppression, and emotional expression 
strategies even in non-maltreating situations, which could compound pre-existing risk for 
maladjustment. Although Egger’s tests indicated possible publication bias for the emotion 
regulation category, trim and fill analyses suggested that bias was not significant. Thus, 
results reported in this meta-analysis appear to be an accurate representation of the state of 
the field.

Significant medium effects emerged for 5 of the 8 categories of coping and emotion 
regulation. At the domain level, a significant medium positive association was found for 
maltreatment and emotion dysregulation, and a significant medium negative association 
was found between maltreatment and emotion regulation. These findings are important in 
providing quantitative evidence that broad indices of emotion regulation are associated with 
maltreatment in children and adolescents. However, a closer examination of items used in 
domain-level measures suggest that they provide relatively little information on the specific 
techniques and strategies that children and adolescents use to regulate emotions or cope 
with stress. For example, the Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC; Shields & Cicchetti, 
1997) was used in nine of the fourteen studies reporting on emotion regulation, and includes 
items such as, “Displays appropriate negative emotions in response to hostile, aggressive, 
or intrusive acts by peers,” and “Transitions well from one activity to another; does not 
become anxious, angry, distressed, or overly excited when moving from one activity to 
another.” While these items depict behaviors indicative of well-regulated emotions, they do 
not provide information on the specific ways in which children achieve emotion regulation. 
Similarly, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) 
was used in five of the eleven studies assessing emotion dysregulation, and includes items 
such as, “When I’m upset, I have difficulty controlling my behaviors,” and “When I’m 
upset, it takes me a long time to feel better” that fail to account for the strategy behind 
the dysregulated response and interfere with attempts to delineate controlled and automatic 
responses. Thus, although the vast majority of research on coping and regulation has been 
conducted at the domain level, these results hold relatively little clinical utility.

There were insufficient studies to calculate effect sizes for several coping/emotion regulation 
factors (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping). This is noteworthy, as 
intermediate level coping/emotion regulation factors displayed the strongest associations 
with internalizing and externalizing problems in youth in the recent meta-analysis conducted 
by Compas et al. (2017). Of the categories that were analyzed, no significant results emerged 
and analyses indicated significant heterogeneity, such that over 90 % of total variability in 
each effect size was due to between-study variability. Measuring stress responding at the 
factor level will be an important component for future research involving maltreatment, 
as coping and emotion regulation factors may elucidate important etiological links to 
psychopathology.

Three significant medium effects emerged at the strategy level, such that maltreatment 
was linked to increased avoidance, emotional suppression, and emotional expression. These 
findings provide vital information regarding the specific ways in which children who have 
experienced maltreatment cope with stress. One explanation for findings arises from the 
uncontrollability of maltreatment experiences, which may instill a belief that all stress is 
uncontrollable, thereby teaching children to avoid stressors or their own responses to stress 
via emotional suppression/inhibition. Regarding emotional expression, it is important to note 
that studies included in this category assessed dysregulated expression or expression of 
angry emotions rather than positive expression. Thus, this response may represent an attempt 
to engage with a stressor but a lack of ability to do so in a regulated and productive manner.

Importantly, these findings highlight stress responses that are likely highly adaptive in 
maltreating situations. For example, engaging with the stressor or displaying emotions may 
be dangerous in high-threat situations (e.g., result in increased abuse), thereby necessitating 
the use of avoidance and suppression. Similarly, situations characterized by deprivation may 
prompt emotional expression as an attempt to receive attention from a neglecting caregiver. 
However, the continued use of these strategies after the maltreatment experience has 
ended (i.e., in situations of lower threat/deprivation) likely becomes harmful to normative 
development (Compas et al., 2017), highlighting the need to develop and implement 
preventive interventions.

6.1.  Limitations and future directions

In spite of the significance of these findings, several limitations of the present study and 
the current state of research should be addressed. First, the possibility of publication bias 
should be acknowledged. All publication bias methods have limitations and no one approach 
is fully accurate; therefore, multiple approaches were included to help better approximate 
accurate estimations of effect sizes in the current review. Although trim and fill analyses 
suggested that publication bias was not present, additional effects of publication bias on the 
findings in the current study cannot be ruled out, as only published studies were included. 
It is important for meta-analytic studies to assess the presence and impact of bias given that 
systematic bias can lead to inflated effect size estimates and inaccurate conclusions.

Second, it is important to note the substantial heterogeneity that emerged in six of the 
eight calculated effect sizes. High heterogeneity is unsurprising, given the wide array 
of different measures used to assess coping and regulation as well as variability in 
sample characteristics. For example, each of the eight studies assessing avoidance used 
a different measure. Further, youth included in this category (N = 4823) varied in the 
type of maltreatment they experienced (e.g., sexual abuse, psychological maltreatment, total 
trauma exposure), and each type of maltreatment was again assessed using a different 
measurement tool. Given the relative paucity of research in this area and resulting lack of 
power, moderator effects within heterogeneous models were not examined. Heterogeneity 
should instead be used as a guide for future research. Differences between studies are a 
necessary and important aspect of research (e.g., varying sample sizes and demographic 
characteristics), but improvements can be made in research design and measurement tools. 
As a field, identifying well-validated, reliable measures of coping and emotion regulation 
to employ across studies, particularly at the strategy and factor levels, would enhance our 
ability to examine specificity in maltreatment-stress response relationship and assess the 
generalizability of findings. Additionally, data on a wider range of factors and strategies 
is needed in order to understand whether engaging in avoidance, emotional suppression, 
and emotional expression are used independently or in conjunction with other coping/
emotion regulation techniques. Regarding the assessment of childhood abuse and neglect, 
effort should be made to gather detailed histories of maltreatment (e.g., type, timing, 
duration, other trauma exposure) using reliable and valid measures. Emerging evidence 
suggests that characteristics of maltreatment may have unique implications for specific 
coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., Milojevich, Norwalk, & Sheridan, 2019). 
Detailed information on maltreatment will provide clarity on sample characteristics to better

understand between-study differences and aide in efforts to trace specific experiences to 
atypical developmental processes and outcomes.

Third, further research is needed to understand how coping and emotion regulation strategies 
are acquired following experiences of abuse and/or neglect. Maltreatment may impact 
intentional efforts to respond to stress through many pathways, including (a) insecure 
attachment (e.g., absence of normative transition from parent working to modulate infant 
emotions to increased independence of child self-regulating; Bowlby, 1969; Cicchetti, 2016) 
and exposure to dysregulated interpersonal interactions within the family, (b) alternations 
in neural development (e.g., smaller prefrontal cortex; Tupler & De Bellis, 2006), (c) 
impairments in biological stress responding (e.g., dysregulation of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis; Tarullo & Gunnar, 2006), and numerous others. Longitudinal, multi-
method research designs will serve to help identify the specific ways in which maltreatment 
interferes with the acquisition of healthy stress responses. Neuroimaging methods, for 
instance, may aide in delineating automatic processes compared to controlled processes of 
coping by examining responses of both emotion (e.g., the amygdala) and executive function 
(e.g., areas of the prefrontal cortex) of the brain (e.g., Belden, Pagliaccio, Murphy, Luby, & 
Barch, 2015) and provide valuable information to supplement self-reported use of effortful 
strategies. Further understanding of this developmental process and use of multiple methods 
to better understand the complex stress response system will provide insight on how and 
when the typical process to acquire self-regulation skills is disrupted and, in turn, shed light 
on the optimal timing for intervention and type of support most needed for maltreated youth.

6.2.  Conclusion

Improving the quality of interventions requires a clear theory of change, well-specified 
targets, and rigorous methods to measure these targets. Interventions for maltreated youth 
can be guided by findings on individual differences in coping and emotion regulation, as 
exposure to stressful events and subsequent stress responses later in development exacerbate 
the effects of maltreatment for some individuals. The present study provides an important 
foundation for understanding the impact of early-life abuse and neglect on intentional, 
controlled efforts to respond to stress, highlighting possible links between maltreatment and 
decreased emotion regulation, increased emotion dysregulation, and a greater tendency to 
suppress emotions, become avoidant, or express dysregulated or angry emotions. Efforts 
to reduce heterogeneity between studies, examine the pathway between maltreatment 
and specific coping and emotion strategies, and incorporate longitudinal, multi-method 
designs are targets for future research. Results will serve to enhance prevention and early 
intervention efforts by providing prescriptive targets to improve stress-response processes in 
individuals who have experienced maltreatment.
