Abstract

Background: Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a psychobiological syndrome associated 
with a history of exposure to childhood abuse and neglect. The consequences of these traumatic 
events often include a profound impact on the way individuals inhabit and experience their bodies. 
Despite this, there is a paucity of empirical research on the subject. The aim of this study was to 
systematically document the occurrence of distorted body perceptions in DID and examine 
childhood maltreatment, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, and 
posttraumatic cognitions as predictors of distorted body perceptions in DID.

Methods: Participants were adult women with histories of childhood abuse and neglect and a 
current DID diagnosis receiving treatment at a psychiatric care facility. Data were obtained 
through a battery of self-report measures, including the Body Uneasiness Test, Childhood Trauma 
Questionnaire, PTSD Checklist for DMS-5, and Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory.

Results: A series of unpaired t-tests documented elevated levels of weight phobia, body image 
concerns, body avoidance, compulsive self-monitoring, and depersonalization in DID compared to 
published non-clinical data on the Body Uneasiness Test. A series of multiple regression models

including measures of childhood trauma, PTSD symptoms, and posttraumatic cognitions 
demonstrated that over and above childhood trauma and PTSD symptom severity, posttraumatic 
cognitions significantly predicted distorted body perceptions.

Conclusions: In a treatment-seeking sample of women with DID, distorted body perceptions 
were elevated. Furthermore, posttraumatic cognitive distortions significantly predicted distorted 
body perceptions when controlling for childhood maltreatment and PTSD symptom severity. This 
suggests that distorted cognitions are a key target for therapeutic intervention.

Introduction

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a psychobiological syndrome associated with a 
history of exposure to abuse and neglect during childhood most often at the hands of a 
caregiver (Dorahy et al., 2014; Putnam et al., 1986). Studies consistently show that 
childhood trauma has innumerable effects on the development and health outcomes of those 
who experience it (Teicher et al., 2016; de Bellis, 2001; Afifi et al., 2016). One such effect 
can be observed in the way individuals inhabit and experience their bodies as adults (van der 
Kolk, 2014). Despite extensive clinical accounts of body-related distortions in individuals 
with histories of childhood trauma (Goodwin and Attias, 1999) and DID (Steinberg and 
Schnall, 2001; Dell, 2006a), there is a paucity of empirical research exploring possible 
predictors of distorted body perceptions in this population.

Trauma-related Body Distortions

Childhood trauma-related body distortions manifest in a number of different ways (Scheffers 
et al., 2017). However, most fall within two overarching categories: (1) depersonalization; 
and, (2) negative body image and perceptions.

Depersonalization.—Depersonalization is generally described as a feeling of detachment 
from one’s body or sense of self (APA, 2013). Experiences of depersonalization are widely 
endorsed in individuals with histories of childhood trauma (Putnam, 1989; Simeon et al., 
2001) and are a core feature of DID (Spiegel et al., 2011; Dorahy et al., 2014). Individuals 
who experience depersonalization may endorse statements such as “I feel detached from my 
body” or “I feel the sensation that my body does not belong to me” (Cuzzolaro et al., 2006). 
Specifically in DID, individuals experience even more extreme forms of depersonalization in 
which their own thoughts, emotions, memories, and behaviors can feel as if they do not 
belong to them (Dell, 2006a). For these individuals, it is not simply a sensation of 
detachment or unfamiliarity, but often rather the experience of their thoughts, emotions, etc. 
as belonging to someone else (Frewen and Lanius, 2015).

Lack of a felt sense of ownership over one’s body and its experiences, which often includes 
a lack of interoceptive awareness, may serve as an adaptive coping response to childhood 
trauma (van der Hart et al., 2006). At the time of the trauma, and even years later, perceiving

the body and its internal sensations as “not mine” may allow the child to survive 
overwhelming experiences of threat and preserve attachment bonds necessary for survival 
(Freyd, 1996).

Negative body image and perceptions.

Body shape and weight dissatisfaction.: Individuals with histories of childhood trauma 
frequently endorse experiences of body shape and weight dissatisfaction, as well as a lack of 
body esteem. These body-related beliefs may originate in a negative self-concept formed 
early in life (Harter, 2001). Self-concept is defined as the view one has of oneself and one’s 
attributes (Baumeister, 1999). Caregivers play a critical role in the development of a child’s 
positive self-concept, and this development starts with the formation of a positive emotional 
bond in infancy (Harter, 2001). When caregivers fail to provide an environment that 
facilitates this development, as is often the case in the type of significant childhood trauma 
reported by individuals with DID, a negative self-concept may form (Harter, 2001). This 
negative self-concept persists into adulthood and may be manifested, at least in part, in one’s 
physical self-image, resulting in lack of body esteem in adulthood.

Body hatred/disgust, avoidance, and shame.: The consequences of childhood trauma can 
also be reflected in the hatred and/or disgust of one’s body. Particularly in cases of 
childhood physical and sexual abuse, which are unique in their violation of physical 
boundaries, the whole body itself, parts of it, or bodily sensations may serve as a constant 
reminder of the trauma. This is often the case for individuals with DID (Steele et al., 2016; 
Van der Hart et al., 2006). It follows that one might experience hatred and/or disgust of, and 
thus avoidance of and shame in, that which reminds them of such experiences – in this case, 
the physical body. Furthermore, one’s hatred of their physical body may stem from a 
misattribution of blame for the traumatic experience. To feel some control over their 
traumatic experiences, individuals with DID may place blame on themselves and their 
physical body (e.g., “If I didn’t have a body, I would never have been hurt”) rather than 
placing blame for the abuse on the perpetrator (Steele et al., 2016).

Clinical reports also suggest that these negatively valenced emotions (e.g., disgust, shame) 
may be rooted in a sense of bodily betrayal experienced during trauma. For example, in 
cases of sexual abuse, one’s body may (against one’s will) respond to the abuse with arousal, 
despite lack of desire (Steele et al., 2016). This discrepancy between subjective and 
physiological arousal, or arousal non-concordance, may be quite common, even outside an 
abuse context (Chivers et al., 2010). This finding supports the fact that physiological arousal 
equates to neither enjoyment nor consent. Nevertheless, individuals may mistakenly think 
that physiological arousal does equate to enjoyment/consent, or their abuser may lead them 
to believe that it does. Thus, an individual’s bodily shame, disgust, etc. may at least in part 
be rooted in that individual’s sense of being betrayed by their own body, and this sense of 
betrayal is frequently observed in DID (Steele et al., 2016).

Potential Predictors of Trauma-related Body Distortions

Although prior studies have explored the link between experiences of trauma and distorted 
body perceptions, few have parsed out the distinct contributions of specific types of abuse to

the development of these perceptions. A review of the literature reveals that most studies do 
not incorporate multiple forms of abuse and neglect into their analysis. Instead, they look at 
sexual abuse alone (Wonderlich et al., 2000; Wenninger and Heiman, 1998), or combine 
physical and sexual abuse into a single representation of the general experience of childhood 
abuse (Eubanks et al., 2006). Studies of sexual abuse as a potential predictor of distorted 
body perceptions present mixed results – while some found that sexual abuse, but not 
physical abuse, contributed to the development of these body distortions (e.g., Kremer et al., 
2013), others find the reverse to be true (e.g., Treuer et al., 2005). Given how little we know 
about the development of trauma-related body distortions, it is critical we explore all forms 
of abuse and neglect (e.g., emotional, physical, and sexual) as potential unique contributors 
to the development of these distortions.

Another lens through which we can begin to understand the development of trauma-related 
body distortions originates in the perceived stress literature, which suggests that the 
consequences of stress present themselves only when: 1) the event is perceived as stressful; 
and, 2) the individual lacks the resources necessary to cope with this stressor (Lazarus and 
Folkman, 1984; Lebois et al. 2016). Within the context of childhood trauma exposure, it is 
plausible that the severity of its consequence – in this case, distorted body perceptions – is 
determined not completely by the trauma itself, but rather the degree to which the trauma is 
perceived as stressful.

One way in which we can quantify perceived stress is through the assessment of 
posttraumatic symptoms and negative cognitions. Posttraumatic symptoms reflect the wide 
array of symptoms (e.g., avoidance, hypervigilance, etc.) that can form following a traumatic 
experience. Posttraumatic cognitions represent the negative thoughts and beliefs that may 
emerge following a traumatic event, and are subsequently believed to contribute to the 
development and maintenance of the aforementioned posttraumatic symptoms (Dunmore et 
al., 1999). More specifically, these cognitions encompass negative thoughts about oneself (“I 
am inadequate”), the world (“the world is a dangerous place”), and attribution of blame for 
the traumatic experience (“the event happened because of the way I acted”; Foa et al., 1999). 
It is posited that individuals who maintain these rigid negative beliefs about themselves or 
the world have difficulty recovering from the traumatic event due to the resulting persistent 
experience of internal or external threat (Ehlers and Clark, 2000). Posttraumatic symptoms 
and cognitions are thus representative of perceived stress in that they are the manifestation of 
the trauma’s impact on the individual’s body and mind.

Experiment Overview

Despite the ubiquity of body distortions among individuals with histories of childhood 
trauma and subsequent DID, empirical studies are needed to document the occurrence of 
these distortions in DID and investigate their predictors. Indeed, a deeper understanding of 
this phenomenon is critical to identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Given this, we systematically documented the occurrence of distorted body perceptions with 
a standardized measure and investigated potential predictors of distorted body perceptions in 
twenty-one treatment-seeking women with DID. Participants completed a battery of self-
report measures, including measures of distorted body perceptions, childhood trauma

severity, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, and posttraumatic negative 
cognitions. We hypothesized that 1) distorted body perceptions would be prevalent in this 
sample, particularly in comparison to an age- and gender-matched non-clinical sample, 2) 
childhood trauma severity would predict the severity of body distortions, and 3) over and 
above childhood trauma severity, PTSD symptom severity and posttraumatic negative 
cognitions would predict body distortions. Given the mixed literature on which type of 
trauma (e.g., sexual abuse vs. physical abuse) is the most predictive of distorted body 
perceptions (e.g., Kremer et al., 2013; Treuer et al., 2005), we chose to include a range of 
maltreatment types, with intent to explore the individual contributions of each type. 
Additionally, given individual differences in perceived stress, we anticipated that body 
distortions would be better predicted by posttraumatic symptoms and cognitions (which 
serve as a proxy for perceived stress) than by the traumatic experience itself.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Measures

Participants were twenty-one treatment-seeking women receiving inpatient, residential, or 
partial hospitalization level of care at a free-standing psychiatric facility. All participants 
reported histories of early childhood trauma and carried both current PTSD and DID 
diagnoses. A diagnosis of PTSD was made using the gold standard Clinician Administered 
PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (Weathers et al., 2018), and a diagnosis of DID was made using the 
gold standard Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-R Dissociative disorders (Steinberg 
et al., 1994). Diagnostic interviews were conducted by trained bachelor (JDW) and MD/PhD 
(LAML, MLK, SRW) level research staff. A final diagnosis was made for each participant 
by a psychiatrist with an expertise in dissociative disorders (MLK). See Tables 1 and 2 for 
participant demographics and clinical characteristics. The control comparison sample was 
drawn from a previously published non-clinical sample of 367 women aged 40–65 
(Cuzzolaro et al. 2006).

The Body Uneasiness Test (BUT; Cuzzolaro et al., 2006) is a 71-item self-report measure 
developed and validated as a psychometric tool for the screening and assessment of distorted 
body perceptions. Part 1 of the BUT assesses weight phobia, body image concerns, 
avoidance, compulsive self-monitoring, and depersonalization. Part 2 assesses specific 
worries about particular body parts. Parts 1 and 2 both utilize a 6-point Likert scale ranging 
from 0, “Never,” to 5, “Always.” A total distorted body perception severity score is 
represented by the BUT Global Severity Index, which is calculated as the average rating of 
all 34 items constituting Part 1 of the BUT. Global Severity Index scores range from 0–5, 
with higher scores indicating more severe negative body perceptions. We used the global 
severity scores as our measure of distorted body perceptions.

The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 1994) is a 28-item self-report 
measure designed to systematically assess childhood maltreatment severity. The CTQ asks 
participants about the frequency of certain events in childhood on a 5-point Likert scale 
ranging from “Never true” to “Very often true”. This measure has five subscales measuring

physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and physical and emotional neglect. Research 
supports the reliability and validity of the CTQ, particularly with regard to internal 
consistency and test-retest reliability (Bernstein et al., 1994; Bernstein et al., 1997). Subscale 
scores range from 5 to 25, and total scores range from 25 to 125. Higher scores indicate 
greater childhood trauma severity.

The PTSD Checklist for DMS-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) is a 20-item self-report 
measure used to assess PTSD symptoms on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Not at all” 
to “Extremely.” Psychometric analysis of the PCL-5 has identified it as a valid, reliable, and 
sensitive measure of PTSD symptoms (Wortmann et al., 2016). The PCL-5 Global Severity 
score was used as our measure of PTSD symptom severity. Scores range from 0–80, with 
higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.

The Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; Foa et al., 1999) is a 33-item self-report 
measure developed for the assessment of cognitions about the self, world, and attribution of 
blame surrounding a traumatic event on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from “Totally 
disagree” to “Totally agree”. Psychometric evaluations of the PTCI found for two of the 
three subscales good concurrent and discriminant validity, as well as adequate internal 
consistency (Foa et al., 1999; Adreu et al., 2017). Given this, the PTCI total score was used 
as our measure of posttraumatic negative cognitions. Scores range from 33–231, with higher 
scores indicating greater negative posttraumatic cognitions.

Participants were recruited as part of a larger study on the biological mechanisms of trauma-
related dissociation. In addition to biological assessments not reported here, participants 
completed a battery of self-report measures on body perceptions (BUT), childhood trauma 
(CTQ), PTSD symptoms (PCL-5), and posttraumatic cognitions (PTCI). Participants were 
compensated $200 for completion of the full study. All procedures were in accordance with 
the ethical standards of the Partners Hospital Institutional Review Board, and the United 
States Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants following an explanation of the study’s procedures.

Procedure

Data Analysis

All self-report scores were calculated as recommended by published scoring guidelines. A 
series of unpaired t-tests with publicly available published age- and gender-matched control 
data and our DID data tested for distorted body perceptions in DID. A series of multiple 
regression analyses were conducted to determine whether childhood trauma, PTSD 
symptom severity, and/or posttraumatic cognitions were predictors of distorted body 
perceptions in individuals with DID. Reported p-values are two-tailed. All calculations were 
computed using SPSS version 24.

Results

Range of Distorted Body Perceptions in DID

Page 7

We first sought to document the occurrence and range of distorted body perceptions in this 
treatment-seeking sample of twenty-one women with DID. As illustrated in Table 2, the 
average Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) Global Severity Index score for our sample was 2.61 
out of a possible range of 0 to 5. In comparison, publicly available published data showed an 
average BUT Global Severity Index score of .90 for an age-matched, non-clinical sample of 
women (Cuzzolaro et al., 2006). Body Uneasiness Test subscale scores for our DID sample 
(Table 2) indicated an elevated occurrence on average of all measured body distortions, 
including weight phobia, body image concern, body avoidance, compulsive self-monitoring, 
and depersonalization. A series of unpaired t-tests between our sample and the previously 
published non-clinical sample (Cuzzolaro et al., 2006) demonstrate all BUT scales were 
highly elevated in our DID sample compared to reported averages in age-matched female 
controls (p’s <.01; Table 3).

Predictors of Distorted Body Perceptions

The following results are illustrated in Table 4. We hypothesized that the severity of 
childhood trauma would predict distorted body perceptions in our sample, such that higher 
total Childhood Trauma Questionnaire scores would confer higher total Body Uneasiness 
Test scores. A multiple regression of all five forms of abuse and neglect (i.e., physical, 
sexual, and emotional abuse, and physical and emotional neglect) confirmed our hypothesis 
(Model 1). Of note, there was no specific form of abuse or neglect driving the prediction of 
distorted body perceptions. Given this, we subsequently modeled the total childhood trauma 
severity score (calculated as the sum of all five forms of abuse and neglect) as the singular 
predictor of distorted body perceptions in Model 2. This model confirmed that higher total 
childhood trauma severity scores predicted higher distorted body perceptions.

In addition, we hypothesized that over and above childhood trauma, PTSD symptom severity 
and posttraumatic cognitions would predict distorted body perceptions. Therefore, we next 
modeled total childhood trauma severity and PTSD symptom severity as predictors of 
distorted body perceptions (Model 3). While the overall model was significant, the total 
childhood trauma severity beta value was not, and the PTSD symptom severity beta value 
was marginally significant.

Our next model tested the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and distorted body 
perceptions. Given that PTSD symptom severity was marginally significant in Model 3, in 
Model 4, we included PTSD symptom severity and posttraumatic cognition severity as 
predictors of distorted body perceptions. In this model, posttraumatic cognitions were the 
only significant predictor of distorted body perceptions. In a final confirmatory analysis 
(Model 5), we modeled posttraumatic cognitions alone as a significant predictor of distorted 
body perceptions.

Discussion

Page 8

DID is a posttraumatic syndrome associated with significant experiences of distorted body 
perceptions, including depersonalization (Putnam, 1989; Dorahy et al. 2014) and altered 
body image/perceptions (Dell, 2006b). However, to date, the range of these distorted body 
perceptions has not been documented systematically, and the predictors of these experiences 
have remained unexplored in DID. Empirical evidence of these predictors will facilitate 
identification of targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as the identification of 
individuals at elevated risk for developing these distorted body perceptions. Given these 
important clinical goals, we assessed the occurrence of distorted body perceptions in DID 
and tested the relationship between childhood trauma severity, PTSD symptom severity, 
posttraumatic negative cognitions, and distorted body perceptions in a well-characterized 
sample of treatment-seeking women with DID. We confirmed our hypotheses that childhood 
trauma would predict distorted body perceptions, and that over and above childhood trauma 
severity, PTSD symptom severity and posttraumatic cognitions would predict distorted body 
perceptions.

Range of Distorted Body Perceptions in DID

This study marks the first use of the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) as a measure of body 
image perceptions in individuals with DID. We found that the global severity of these 
experiences was nearly 3x higher than published averages in age-matched, female, non-
clinical controls (Cuzzolaro et al., 2006). Furthermore, all measured subscales were elevated 
in our sample compared to these controls. That is, individuals with DID on average reported 
elevated fear of being or becoming fat (weight phobia), worries related to physical 
appearance (body image concerns), body avoidance behaviors, compulsive checking of 
physical appearance (compulsive self-monitoring), and depersonalization experiences of 
detachment from their body.

Of note, the BUT was designed specifically for use in eating disorder populations, and it is 
the only existing eating disorder assessment tool that includes a discrete measure of 
depersonalization symptoms. Given the prevalence of depersonalization in DID, the BUT is 
uniquely suited to assess body perceptions in this population.

Furthermore, among the BUT’s subscales, its depersonalization subscale has the highest 
predictive validity for eating disorders (Cuzzolaro et al., 2006). The more commonly used 
Eating Disorder Examination (Cooper et al., 1989), the gold standard eating disorder 
assessment tool (Berg et al., 2012), does not account for the dissociative component of 
distorted body experiences. At the same time, while the BUT incorporates dissociative 
symptomatology, it does not capture disordered eating behaviors, the assessment of which 
may be critical to identifying more immediate safety concerns. An ideal measure would 
incorporate a wide array of body perceptions (including a range of dissociative symptoms) 
as well as a thorough assessment of disordered eating behaviors. Such a tool may be 
especially useful for the assessment of distorted body perceptions, trauma-related disordered 
eating, and co-occurring eating disorders in DID samples.

Childhood Trauma Type Predicted Distorted Body Perceptions

We found that childhood trauma severity was significantly predictive of distorted body 
perceptions in our sample of women with DID. This finding is consistent with the 
understanding that experiences of childhood trauma confer, broadly speaking, worse mental 
and physical health outcomes (see Hughes et al., 2017 for a systematic review and meta-
analysis). As the severity of the trauma increases, it follows that the severity of the mental 
health outcome (in this case, distorted body perceptions) would increase as well. Contrary to 
previous work in individuals with childhood maltreatment histories and/or eating disorder 
diagnoses (e.g., Kremer et al., 2013 and Treuer et al., 2005), we did not find that any specific 
form of abuse uniquely predicted distorted body perceptions in DID. Instead, we found that 
overall interpersonal childhood maltreatment severity predicted distorted body perceptions – 
a finding which may be specific to DID. In our DID sample, and typically for those with 
DID, individuals experience high severity and frequency of all forms of abuse/neglect, and 
these experiences are intertwined (e.g., sexual abuse is also a form of emotional abuse). 
Alternatively, higher-powered DID samples may find unique contributions of certain 
maltreatment types. Given this, although no single form of abuse or neglect stood out as 
contributing most to the development of distorted body perceptions in this sample, it is 
critical that future investigations continue to examine the unique contributions of each 
maltreatment type.

Posttraumatic Symptoms Predicted Distorted Body Perceptions

When we included PTSD symptoms and posttraumatic negative cognitions in the model 
with childhood maltreatment, posttraumatic negative cognitions were the only significant 
predictor of distorted body perceptions. Our measure of posttraumatic negative cognitions 
(PTCI; Foa et al., 1999) focused on distorted negative cognitions surrounding oneself, the 
world, and attribution of blame for the traumatic experience. Among distorted negative 
cognitions, shame, in particular, has been identified as relevant to the development of 
dissociative processes and DID (Kluft, 2007; Chefetz, 2015). Herman posits that the link 
between shame and trauma disorders (such as DID) originates in the shame experienced in 
the social subordination inherent to interpersonal trauma (2011). Furthermore, individuals 
with DID may blame themselves and their physical body for their abuse instead of the 
perpetrator (Steele et al., 2016). Internalized shame and misattributed blame, among other 
self-directed negative cognitions, may manifest in one’s physical self-perceptions. This may 
be a central cause of the predictive relationship we found between posttraumatic negative 
cognitions and distorted body perceptions in DID.

The impact posttraumatic negative cognitions have on body perception is likely because our 
in-the-moment interoceptive and exteroceptive experience of the body is constructed based 
on a combination of past experiences stored in memory and incoming sensory input (Barrett 
& Simmons, 2015; Lebois et al., 2019; Panichello, Cheung, & Bar, 2012). In this way, 
distorted negative cognitions about one’s self can influence how someone perceives their 
physical body. In DID specifically, shame about their body or blame they place on 
themselves or their body for the abuse may contribute to perceived lack of ownership or 
agency over their body (Lebois et al., 2019). It is through this lens that we can begin to

understand why distorted negative cognitions may serve as a strong predictor of body 
distortions in women with histories of childhood trauma and subsequent DID.

Developmental Sensitivity

The developmental timing of abuse may also inform our understanding of the role of 
negative cognitions in the formation of distorted body perceptions. Young children have a 
developmentally appropriate egocentrism, that is, the inability to differentiate between one’s 
own perspective and that of another – or, in other words, the inability to see a situation from 
another’s perspective (Piaget, 1972). Given this self-centered conceptual framework, a 
maltreated child is developmentally prone to assume that they are the cause of and/or 
deserving of such treatment. Young children are also prone to dichotomous, or “all-or-
nothing,” thinking (Harter, 2001). Children with nurturing and supportive caregivers tend to 
view themselves as inherently “all good,” such that a single scolding or punishment is not 
sufficient to disrupt their positive self-concept. For children who are abused and whose basic 
needs are neglected, a negative self-concept is chronically reinforced, such that the child’s 
perception of the self is “all bad” (Harter, 2001). This all-or-nothing thinking, in conjunction 
with egocentrism, may lead to the self-blame and self-hatred that often follows childhood 
maltreatment to be generalized to the whole self, including the physical body.

When considering the implications of this study, it is important to bear in mind the 
limitations presented by our study sample and design. Our principle limitation is small 
sample size; however, the well-characterized nature of our cohort, the limited number of 
studies on treatment-seeking clinical populations with DID, and the statistical significance of 
our findings despite a small N speak to the importance of this work. Notably, our study 
examined treatment-seeking women with DID, and therefore our findings may not be 
generalizable beyond this clinical population. Future work should seek to replicate these 
findings in larger and broader samples. Additionally, while we diagnosed individuals with 
the gold-standard clinical interviews, symptom assessments were collected via self-report 
surveys, and thus may be subject to self-report bias. Future work should seek to identify 
objective behavioral and biomarkers of distorted body perceptions to bolster subjective self-
report findings.

Limitations

Clinical Implications and Conclusions

This study was the first to employ an empirical approach to exploring predictors of distorted 
body perceptions in women with DID, and we identified posttraumatic negative cognitions 
as a significant predictor of these body perceptions. This may have clinical implications for 
how we think about and treat distorted body perceptions and related disordered eating 
behaviors in individuals with histories of childhood trauma and subsequent DID. Given that 
posttraumatic cognitions predict the severity of body distortions in this sample, these 
cognitions should be a targeted focus of therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, the elevated 
occurrence of various distorted body perceptions in DID highlights the need to address 
distorted body perceptions as part of the clinical care of all women with histories of 
childhood trauma (and subsequent DID) – not just for those with co-occurring eating 
disorders.
