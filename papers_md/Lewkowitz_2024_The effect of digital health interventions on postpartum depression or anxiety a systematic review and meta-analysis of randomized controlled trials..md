Abstract

Objective:  To examine the effect of digital health interventions (DHIs) compared to treatment 
as usual (TAU) on preventing and treating postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum anxiety 
(PPA).

Data Sources:  Searches in Ovid Medline, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials comparing DHIs to TAU for preventing or 
treating PPD and PPA. The primary outcome was the score on the first ascertainment of PPD or 
PPA symptoms after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included screening positive for PPD

or PPA—as defined in the primary study—and loss to follow-up, defined as the proportion of 
participants who completed the final study assessment compared to the number who were initially 
randomized.

Methods of Study Selection:  Two authors independently screened all abstracts for eligibility 
and independently reviewed all potentially eligible full-text articles for inclusion. A third author 
screened abstracts and full-text articles as needed to determine eligibility in cases of discrepancy. 
For continuous outcomes, the Hedges method was used to obtain standardized mean differences 
(SMD) when the studies used different psychometric scales, and weighted mean differences 
(WMD) were calculated when studies used the same psychometric scales. For categorical 
outcomes, pooled relative risks (RR) were estimated.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results:  Of 921 studies originally identified, 31 randomized 
controlled trials—corresponding to 5,532 participants randomized to DHI and 5,492 participants 
randomized to TAU—were included. Compared to TAU, DHIs significantly reduced mean scores 
ascertaining PPD symptoms (29 studies: SMD −0.64 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): −0.88, 
−0.40), I2= 94.4%) and PPA symptoms (17 studies: SMD −0.49 (95% CI: −0.72, −0.25) ), I2= 
84.6%). In the few studies that assessed screen-positive rates for PPD (n=4) or PPA (n=1), there 
was no significant differences between those randomized to DHI versus TAU. Overall, those 
randomized to DHI had 38% increased risk of not completing the final study assessment compared 
to those randomized to TAU (pooled RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.18, 1.62), but those randomized to 
app-based DHI had similar loss-to-follow-up rates as those randomized to TAU (RR 1.04 (95% 
Confidence Interval: 0.91, 1.19)).

Conclusion:  DHIs modestly, but significantly, reduced scores assessing PPD and PPA 
symptoms. More research is needed to identify DHIs that effectively prevent or treat PPD and 
PPA but encourage ongoing engagement throughout the study period.

Tweetable statement:

In a meta-analysis of RCTs, digital interventions modestly but significantly reduced symptoms of 
postpartum depression and anxiety but had higher risk of loss-to-follow up compared to routine 
care.

Introduction

In the year after childbirth, approximately 15% of women experience postpartum depression 
(PPD)1 and 20% experience postpartum anxiety (PPA).2 Prior studies have demonstrated 
that interventions utilizing psychoeducation3 or psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT),4 interpersonal therapy (IPT),5 or mindfulness6) effectively prevent and treat PPD 
and PPA. Unfortunately, less than 20% of women with PPD or PPA have access 
to these interventions.7 The inadequate dissemination of programs shown to improve

perinatal mental health has been attributed to the limited number of skilled mental health 
professionals who can provide psychoeducation or psychotherapy in the perinatal period.8

Digital health interventions (DHIs) may help expand access to evidence-based 
psychoeducation or psychotherapy-based perinatal mental health programs. Though the 
World Health Organization defines DHIs broadly as “a discrete functionality of digital 
technology that is applied to achieve health objectives,”9, DHIs may be defined 
pragmatically as interventions delivered directly to a patient via the internet, a smartphone 
application (app), or a text message or short-message system (SMS) program. DHIs have 
notable advantages when compared to in-person interventions. First, they are accessible 
to nearly all who reside in the United States: smartphone ownership rates are nearly 
universal among reproductive-aged patients (95% of individuals aged 18–49 years own a 
smartphone),10 and most households (77%)—even low-income (57%)11 or rural households 
(72%)12—have broadband internet at home.11, 12Second, DHIs bypass barriers such as lack 
of childcare or unreliable transportation that have been associated with reduced adherence to 
in-person postpartum care.13, 14 Lastly, DHIs are inherently scalable: once proven effective, 
DHIs can be widely disseminated without reducing intervention fidelity.

Prior meta-analyses have suggested that DHIs effectively improve PPD or PPA when 
compared to treatment as usual in randomized controlled trials.15–18 However, these meta-
analyses have limitations: most only included internet-based DHIs,16–18 and the only meta-
analysis that included multiple DHI modalities focused exclusively on the effect of DHIs 
on PPD15 despite the significant burden of PPA on perinatal populations. In addition, 
nine randomized controlled trials comparing DHIs to treatment as usual (TAU) have been 
published since 2021.19–27 Thus, an updated meta-analysis is warranted. The primary aim 
of this study is to assess the effect of DHIs compared to TAU on preventing or treating 
PPD and PPA. Secondary aims included assessing the effect of DHIs compared to TAU on 
treating PPD and PPA overall and the effect of specific DHI modalities on PPD and PPA 
prevention or treatment.

All written methodologies, including search strategies, used in this systematic review 
and meta-analysis were created according to standards and guidelines for conducting and 
reporting systematic reviews set forth by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA),28 the Peer Review Systematic Search Strategies 
(PRESS),29 the Institute for Medicine Standards for Systematic Reviews,30 and the 
Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews.31 This study was registered on PROSPERO 
(#CRD42022321649) prior to data abstraction and exempt from institutional board review as 
only deidentified data derived from prior publications were included.

A medical librarian (A.H.) searched published literature for records discussing postpartum 
depression, anxiety, or distress and digital or mobile health interventions in pregnant or 
postpartum people. The librarian created search strategies using a combination of controlled 
vocabulary and keywords in Ovid Medline 1946-, Embase 1947-, Scopus 1823-, Cochrane

Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), and Clinicaltrials.gov 1997-. The search was initially completed in October 
2021 and was re-executed in December 2022. Appendix 1describes reproducible search 
strategies for each database.

Study selection

Two co-authors (A.K.L and A.R.W) independently screened all titles and abstracts before 
jointly reviewing their individual selection of potentially eligible abstracts. Disagreements 
on potential eligibility were resolved with discussion with a third author (N.K.A.). A.K.L 
and A.R.W then independently reviewed all full-text articles for inclusion, with N.K.A 
determining final eligibility in cases of discrepancy. Review articles, case reports or 
series, abstracts, articles published in languages other than English, and studies without 
a comparison group or without outcomes of interest were excluded. Randomized trials 
comparing any perinatal digital health intervention to TAU, defined as routine care, were 
included. We also reviewed the bibliographies of included studies to identify additional 
eligible studies not identified in our search of the literature.

Data abstraction

Two authors (A.K.L and A.R.W.) independently reviewed eligible articles for data 
abstraction using a data abstraction tool (Appendix 2). The primary outcome was the score 
obtained on the first postpartum ascertainment after intervention delivery or randomization 
of depressive or anxiety symptoms using any psychometric scales that screen for PPD or 
PPA. For the secondary psychological outcomes, only studies that assessed PPD or PPA via 
the most commonly utilized psychometric scale for PPD (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression 
Scale (EPDS)32) and for PPA (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)33) were included. 
Other secondary outcomes included screening positive at any postpartum assessment for 
depression or anxiety—as defined in the primary study—and loss to follow-up, defined as 
the proportion of participants who completed the final study assessment compared to the 
number who were initially randomized.

The same two reviewers also assessed the quality of each study using a prespecified criteria 
adapted from the Cochrane Handbook31 in a system of classification previously utilized.34–
36 High-quality studies were defined as trials with appropriate randomization methods, clear 
definitions of primary outcomes, and intention-to-treat analyses. Lower-quality studies were 
those missing at least one of these attributes.34–36 In instances that a study did not include 
sufficient data to judge an attribute, that attribute was categorized as missing. Disagreement 
on study quality classification were resolved by discussion with a third author (N.K.A.).

Data synthesis and assessment of risk of bias

All statistical analyses were performed with the METAN package in STATA 16.0 (StataCorp 
LP, College Station, TX). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochrane’s 
Q and Higgins I2 tests.31 Heterogeneity was deemed to be significant based on conservative 
thresholds of Q > df for the Q tests or I2 > 30%.31 Raw data from each study were 
pooled. For continuous outcomes, the Hedges method was used to obtain standardized mean 
differences (SMD) when the studies used different psychometric scales, weighted mean

differences (WMD) were calculated when studies used the same psychometric scales. For 
categorical outcomes, pooled relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
calculated using raw data from each study. To account for clinical heterogeneity between 
studies and to produce a more conservative estimate of effect size,37 data were pooled 
using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models regardless of evidence of statistical 
heterogeneity. For the primary outcomes (PPD and PPA), we also calculated 95% prediction 
intervals (PI) to determine the potential effect size of a new study if this study were selected 
at random from the same population of studies currently included in our meta-analysis.38

We conducted pre-specified stratified analyses to assess whether the effect of the digital 
health intervention was altered by study quality, developed versus developing country 
setting, or type of digital health intervention. These analyses were based on study quality 
(higher- versus lower-quality), location of study completion (developed versus developing 
country, as categorized by the United Nations 2022 World Economic Situation and Prospects 
document39), or route of digital health intervention delivery (online/internet versus TAU; 
app versus TAU; and text message/SMS versus TAU). In addition, we conducted stratified 
analyses based on: (1) whether the study population was restricted to those who screened 
positive for PPD or PPA per study criteria (i.e., either via a prespecified score on a PPD 
or PPA psychometric scale or self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms) or who were 
diagnosed with depression via formal psychological interview prior to randomization; and 
(2) the type of intervention delivered digitally (psychotherapy—defined as CBT, IPT, or 
mindfulness—or psychoeducation, with or without peer support; the study that provided 
peer support alone40 was analyzed individually).

Publication bias was assessed visually using a funnel plot, while the Egger’s test statistically 
assessed symmetry.41

Pooled Results

Study Selection

The literature search including ClinicalTrials.gov yielded a total of 921 citations. 453 
duplicate citations were removed using the automatic duplicate finder in Endnote, and an 
additional 40 duplicates identified in both the original and updated search were removed 
(Figure 1). The titles and abstracts for each of the remaining 428 citation were reviewed for 
relevance and screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies were excluded 
because they were not a randomized controlled trial (116 studies) or were a published study 
protocol (162 studies). Ultimately, 51 full texts were reviewed. Of these, 20 were excluded, 
most commonly because data were un-abstractable due to being presented as the change 
between psychometric scores at baseline and at first post-randomization assessment but 
without the actual scores (5 studies) or the study was described as a randomized trial but 
employed a different study design (4 studies) or lacked outcomes of interest (3 studies). 
Thus, 31 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

Study Characteristics

Page 6

Baseline characteristics of included studies are described in Table 1. All 31 studies were 
randomized trials published as full-text manuscripts. One study dichotomized analyzes by 
parity (nulliparous and multiparous)21; data from this study were abstracted independently 
and presented in the forest plots as “Dol: nulliparous” and “Dol: multiparous” and was 
therefore counted as two studies in our analyses. Two studies were three-group randomized 
trials (in Jiao et al’s study,42 the three groups were: web-based psychoeducation, home-
based psychoeducation, and TAU; for Milgrom et al’s study43, the three groups were: 
web-based CBT, in-person CBT, and TAU). Per methodological strategies described in 
prior meta-analyses,34, 35 data from the DHI group and the TAU group were abstracted 
for these two studies and compared. Among the 31 studies, 20 were deemed to be of 
higher-quality,21, 22, 25, 27, 42–57 and 11 were lower-quality.19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 40, 58–62 The 
reason that a study was designated as lower quality is described in Table 1. 24 studies were 
conducted in developed countries19–22, 25–27, 42, 43, 45–53, 55, 56, 58–60, 62; only seven were 
conducted in developing countries.23, 24, 40, 44, 54, 57, 61 The route of delivery for the DHI 
varied between studies: 19 studies utilized an online or internet-based intervention,20, 22, 24, 
27, 40, 42, 43, 45–52, 55, 56, 58, 59 11 studies employed a smartphone application,19, 23, 25, 26, 
44, 53, 54, 57, 60–62 and one study used a text-message/SMS-based intervention.21 In terms 
of study population, 14 studies utilized DHIs to try to prevent PPD or PPA: of these, 10 
studies did not include psychometric screening for or self-reported symptoms of depression 
and anxiety as part of their study’s eligibility criteria,19, 21, 23, 24, 40, 42, 44, 46, 50, 60 while 
four studies screened potentially eligible participants for depression or anxiety in order to 
exclude those who screened positive.22, 25, 27, 62 The remaining 17 studies utilized DHIs to 
try to treat PPD or PPA among those who screened positive or were diagnosed with PPD 
or PPA Specifically, 12 studies included only those who screened positive for depression 
or anxiety prior to randomization,20, 26, 45, 52–59, 61 three studies included participants who 
underwent interview-based clinical assessments to diagnose major depressive disorder,43, 
49, 51 and two studies included those who self-reported symptoms of depression or anxiety 
prior to randomization.47, 48The type of intervention delivered digitally also varied: one 
provided digital peer support,40 two delivered psychoeducation with peer support,51, 60 and 
nine provided psychoeducation.21, 23, 42, 44, 46, 47, 53, 62 Of the 20 studies that provided 
psychotherapy, 14 delivered CBT,20, 25–27, 43, 45, 48–52, 55, 59, 61 six provided mindfulness,19, 
22, 24, 54, 57, 60 one delivered IPT,56 and one included a program combining mindfulness and 
CBT.58

Synthesis of results and risk of bias of included studies

In total, 5532 participants received a digital health intervention and 5492 participants 
received TAU across the 31 individual studies (which were analyzed as 32 studies due 
to Dol et al’s dichotomous study population21), with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 
2509 participants and follow up lasting from 2 days until one year after randomization. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria differed significantly across studies; for example, most 
studies recruited participants exclusively in person during prenatal care clinics or birth 
hospitalization while 7 studies recruited participants partly or exclusively through social 
media or printed advertisements in community space. The time frame of the first screen for 
PPD or PPA was heterogeneous: though 28 studies first assessed for PPD or PPA from four

to 12 weeks postpartum, the range extended from less than one week after delivery to 32 
weeks postpartum.

Psychometric scales utilized to screen for PPD or PPA varied across studies (Table 1). Of 
the 29 studies that screened for PPD, 22 studies used the EPDS, three used the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9,63 two used the Depression subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, and 
Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21),64 and two used the Beck’s Depression Inventory.65 Four studies 
presented data on screen-positive rates for PPD (though the definition of screening positive 
differed across studies: one study screen-positive PPD as having a mild score or higher on 
the DASS-21,19 and the three other studies used the EPDS, with a score of ≥924 or ≥1046, 56 
defined as screen positive). For PPA, six of the 17 studies that screened for PPA utilized the 
GAD-7, six used the anxiety subscale of the DASS-21,64 two used the State Trait Anxiety 
Inventory,66 Dol et al used the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale for the nulliparous and 
multiparous cohorts,67 and one use the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.68 Only one 
study provided data on screen-positive rates for PPA, defined as a mildscore or more on the 
DASS-21 anxiety subscale.19

Compared to TAU, digital health interventions significantly, though modestly, reduced both 
PPD symptoms (29 studies: SMD −0.64 (95% CI: −0.88, −0.40); 95% prediction interval: 
−1.93, 0.65) and PPA symptoms (17 studies: SMD −0.49 (95% CI: −0.72, −0.25); 95% 
prediction interval: −1.96, 0.49) (Figure 2). A high amount of interstudy heterogeneity was 
identified for both PPD and PPA (I2 was 94.4% and I2 83.4%, respectively). For both 
primary outcomes, the funnel plots did not show asymmetry, and the Egger’s test confirmed 
an absence of publication bias for PPD (p=0.12) and PPA (p=0.85) (Figure 3).

Secondary outcomes shown in Figure 4 include scores on the EPDS for PPD and on 
the GAD-7 for PPA as well as screen positive rates and overall loss-to-follow-up rates. 
When analyses were limited to studies that conducted PPD or PPA screening with these 
scales, DHIs significantly reduced both EPDS scores (22 studies: WMD −0.64 (95% CI 
−0.92, −0.35)) and GAD-7 scores (6 studies: WMD −0.52 (95% CI −0.78, −0.25)), though 
interstudy heterogeneity persisted (I2 95.6% for PPD and I2 59.5% for PPA). There were 
no differences in rates of screening positive for PPD (n=4) or PPA (n=1) among those 
randomized to DHI versus TAU. In terms of LTFU, 57.1% (n=3158) of those randomized 
to the DHI completed the final study assessment, compared to 66.2% (n=3635) of those 
randomized to TAU; thus, those randomized to the DHI had 38% higher risk of not 
completing the study comparatively (pooled RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.18, 1.62)).

Forest plots for stratified analyses or primary outcomes and for all secondary outcomes 
are included in Appendix 3. In general, the effect of DHIs on primary and secondary 
psychological outcomes was similar among the primary analyses and analyses stratified by 
study quality, country setting, type of DHI (web/online, app, or text message), and whether 
the participants did or did not screen positive (or was diagnosed with or self-reported 
symptoms of) depression or anxiety (Table 2). Nearly all stratified analyses showed high 
amount of inter-study heterogeneity (Table 2). For the primary PPD outcome, interventions 
that provided psychotherapy had a larger effect on PPD and PPA compared to those that 
delivered psychoeducation with or without peer support (psychotherapy: PPD (19 studies):

PPA (6 studies): SMD −0.29 (95% CI −0.57, 0.00)). The risk of not completing the final 
study assessment was higher among those randomized to DHI that were web/online-based 
(19 studies: RR 1.77 (95% CI 1.46, 2.15)) or that delivered psychotherapy (20 studies: RR 
1.52 (95% CI 1.22, 1.90) compared to the overall (RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.18, 1.62)). Of note, 
there was no difference in loss to follow-up rates among those randomized to apps versus to 
TAU (RR 1.04 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.19)).

Discussion

Principal Results

In this meta-analysis of randomized trials analyzing the effect of DHIs on PPD and PPA, a 
modest but statistically significant reduction in scores on psychometric scales assessing PPD 
and PPA were identified among those randomized to DHIs overall and when PPD and PPA 
were assessed via EPDS or GAD-7, respectively. This effect was more pronounced when 
the DHI delivered psychotherapy (CBT, IPT, or mindfulness) compared to psychoeducation 
with or without peer support. DHIs had similarly modest effect on preventing PPD or 
PPA from those who screened negative (or were not screened) for these conditions upon 
randomization and on treating PPD and PPA for those who screened positive or were 
diagnosed with depression or anxiety at randomization. Though LTFU rates were higher 
among those randomized to DHIs than those randomized to TAU, this difference was driven 
by a high rate of drop out identified in studies utilizing web/online interventions: there 
was no difference in LTFU rates among those randomized to apps compared to TAU. 
These findings suggest that, while all DHIs appear to improve postpartum mental health, 
those that provide psychotherapy and are delivered via smartphone application may be the 
most effective at improving psychological outcomes and retaining participant engagement, 
respectively.

Comparisons with Prior Work

Our findings are consistent with those reported from prior meta-analyses,15–18 which also 
noted a small but statistically significant improvement in psychometric scales measuring 
PPD or PPA but no difference in screen-positive rates for PPD among those randomized 
to DHIs compared to TAU. However, unlike the prior meta-analyses,15–18 which reported 
mostly pooled psychometric outcomes, we conducted stratified analyses based on factors 
that could plausibly impact the effectiveness of DHI, such as study quality, country of 
origin, type of intervention delivered (psychoeducation or psychotherapy), and type of DHI 
utilized (online, app, or SMS). In addition, unlike prior meta-analyses—which presented 
study populations as homogeneous15–18—one of our analyses stratified the primary studies 
into those in which potential participants were required to screen positive for or self-reported 
depressive or anxiety symptoms in order to be randomized. Interestingly, this stratified 
analysis concluded that DHI had a similar effect on postpartum psychometric scales 
regardless of whether the participant did or did not screen positive for depression or anxiety. 
Altogether, our findings not only support those from prior meta-analysis15–18 but add depth 
to the relationship between DHI and postpartum depression and anxiety.

Clinical Implications

Page 9

PPD and PPA are among the most common conditions in the postpartum period.1, 2 Despite 
the fact that psychoeducation3 and psychotherapy4–6 have been shown to effectively prevent 
and treat PPD and PPA, few people who have PPD or PPA are able to access these 
interventions,7 potentially due to a lack of skilled mental health professionals.8 DHI are 
accessible to nearly all who reside in the United States,10–12 bypass barriers associated with 
reduced adherence to in-person postpartum care,13, 14 and are inherently scalable without 
relying on skilled mental health professionals for dissemination. The fact that DHIs are more 
effective than TAU in terms of reducing scores on psychometric scales assessing for PPD 
and PPA is promising for PPD/PPA prevention and treatment. More specifically, widespread 
incorporation of DHIs that provide evidence-based psychoeducation or psychotherapy could 
provide modest population-wide reductions in PPD and PPA symptoms, as measured by 
psychometric scales. Furthermore, the benefits to DHI noted in the subgroup of studies 
conducted in developing countries offers scalable promise to the global burden of untreated 
perinatal mental health conditions.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study offers several strengths. First, we used a predesigned protocol in which an 
expert research librarian conducted a comprehensive search strategy, and two researchers 
independently screened all abstracts and potentially eligible full manuscripts for inclusion 
before independently abstracting data, which reduced bias. We also updated our search 
during the review process due to the publication of multiple potentially eligible randomized 
trials after the initial search was complete, which allowed us to base our conclusions on the 
most up-to-date data available. In addition, we conducted multiple stratified analyses, which 
allowed us to assess the impact of study quality, study setting, type of intervention delivered, 
and type of DHI on the effectiveness of DHIs on PPD and PPA. Lastly, we pooled data from 
studies using random-effects models, which is a more conservative strategy that helps reduce 
the potential effect of heterogeneity between studies.

Nevertheless, limitations should be considered. First, the findings of our meta-analysis carry 
forward the limitations of primary studies, including lower quality studies. However, the 
persistence of our findings within the subgroup of studies considered high quality provides 
reassurance against biased findings. Second, there was excessive clinical and statistical 
heterogeneity in our analysis, with multiple different psychometric scales employed, varying 
eligibility criteria for entry into each included study, and the study interventions, even within 
similar categories of DHIs. We attempted to reduce the effect of this heterogeneity by 
conducting multiple secondary analysis and subgroup analysis in which the analyses were 
limited to studies that contained the same psychometric scale, or that required participants to 
screen positive for PPD, or used the same individual type of DHI. Though these additional 
analyzes may have reduced the effect of heterogeneity on our outcomes, it would be 
impossible to eliminate the heterogeneity, particularly for study intervention. Indeed, a trial 
analyzing the effect of self-guided online videos on CBT45 and another trial analyzing the 
effect of a live, interactive, remote CBT workshop55 were both categorized as a DHI offering 
online CBT, though these interventions clearly differed. Reframing the heterogeneity of 
DHIs included in this meta-analysis as mirroring differences between in-person CBT, IPT,

or mindfulness programs also reduces the potential effect of heterogeneity on our outcomes. 
Specifically, each psychotherapeutic intervention abides by defined principles within CBT, 
IPT, or mindfulness but is not identical to other programs offering the same psychotherapy. 
Third, the varying definitions of screening positive for PPD or PPA entailed—and the 
paucity of studies that included data on screening positive for either condition—limits our 
ability to examine the effect of DHIs on screen-positive PPD or PPA. Lastly, there was also 
marked heterogeneity in psychometric scales used in the primary PPD and PPA outcomes. 
Given the fact that our secondary outcomes were scores on one PPD or PPA scale and 
these analyses had similar results as from our primary analysis, it is unlikely that this 
heterogeneity affected our results.

Need for additional research

Conclusions

The fact that participants were more likely to not complete final study assessments if 
randomized to the DHI group than to the TAU group demonstrates that more research is 
needed to optimize acceptability and use of DHI in clinical settings. Incorporating end-user 
feedback into the intervention development process has been described as an effective 
strategy to encourage sustained participant engagement with DHIs.69–71 In addition, the 
notable difference in LTFU rates among online DHIs versus app-based DHIs—and in 
particular the lack of difference in loss-to-follow up rates among app-based DHIs and 
TAU—should be a research priority. Implementation research or hybrid implementation-
effectiveness trials may offer another avenue to understand and optimize DHI use.72 Lastly, 
most studies included assessed PPD, but fewer assessed PPA. Future research on DHI should 
include assessments for both PPD and PPA.

The results from this meta-analysis of randomized trials suggest that DHIs significantly—
though modestly—reduce PPD and PPA symptoms and that this effect is more pronounced 
if the DHI delivers psychotherapy such as CBT, IPT, or mindfulness. Though LTFU rates 
were higher overall among those randomized to DHIs than those randomized to TAU, there 
was no difference in LTFU rates among those randomized to apps compared to TAU. These 
findings suggest that DHIs that provide psychotherapy and are delivered via smartphone 
application may be the most effective at improving perinatal psychological outcomes 
and retaining participant engagement. However, because few studies include app-based 
psychotherapy, additional high-quality randomized trials are needed to further examine the 
potential of DHIs delivering psychotherapy via a smartphone application specifically on 
reducing PPD and PPA.

Results:

The published literature was searched using strategies designed by a medical librarian 
for the concepts of postpartum depression, anxiety, or distress, and mobile health 
applications. The strategies were created using a combination of controlled vocabulary 
terms and keywords, and were executed from database inception in Medline (Ovid), 
Embase.com, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL), 
and Clinicaltrials.gov. Results were limited to randomized controlled trials by using RCT 
filters recommended by the Cochrane Group for Ovid-Medline1, Embase,2 and CINAHL,3 
and a librarian-created filter for Scopus.4 Results were limited to English and Spanish using 
database-supplied limits. The initial searches were completed on October 7, 2021, with an 
updated literature search completed on December 6, 2022. A 2021–2022/2023 date limit 
was used on the updated literature search. Complete search strategies are provided.

The initial literature search completed in 2021 retrieved 614 search results. The citations 
were imported to Endnote where 304 duplicate citations were identified and removed 
leaving 310 unique citations for analysis. The updated literature search completed in 2022 
retrieved 307 search results, with 189 duplicate citations, leaving 118 unique citations for 
analysis. Between the initial and updated literature searches there were 428 unique citations 
remaining for further review.

AJOG at a Glance

1.

A. Why was this study conducted?

a.

b.

a. Digital health interventions (DHI) are increasingly utilized 
in postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum anxiety (PPA) 
prevention and treatment.

b. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DHI to 
treatment as usual for PPD and PPA have been published since the 
most recent meta-analysis

2.

B. What are the key findings?

a.

b.

a. DHIs effectively but modestly reduce symptoms of PPD and 
postpartum anxiety overall, particularly when the DHI provides 
psychotherapy.

b. Those randomized to DHI had higher risk of loss-to-follow-up 
(LTFU) versus those randomized to TAU overall, but the rate of 
LTFU was similar among smartphone applications.

3.

C. What does this study add to what is known?

a.

a. App-based DHIs providing psychotherapy may be the most 
effective at improving perinatal psychological outcomes and 
retaining participant engagement.
