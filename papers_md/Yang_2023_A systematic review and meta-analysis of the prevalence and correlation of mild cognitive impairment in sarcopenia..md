Abstract

Sarcopenia is a progressive skeletal muscle disorder involving the loss of muscle mass and function, associated with an
increased risk of disability and frailty. Though its prevalence in dementia has been studied, its occurrence in mild cog-
nitive impairment (MCI) has not been well established. As MCI is often a prelude to dementia, our study aims to inves-
tigate the prevalence of MCI among individuals with sarcopenia and to also ascertain whether sarcopenia is indepen-
dently associated with MCI. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Ovid, Embase and Web of Science were systematically
searched for articles on MCI and/or sarcopenia published from inception to 1 February 2022. We reviewed the avail-
able literature on the number of individuals with MCI and/or sarcopenia and calculated odds ratios (ORs) of sarcope-
nia in MCI and MCI in sarcopenia, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using the meta package in Stata,
Version 12.0. A total of 13 studies and 27 428 patients were included in our analysis. The pooled prevalence of MCI
in participants with sarcopenia was 20.5% (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.140–0.269) in a total sample of 2923 cases
with a high level of heterogeneity (P < 0.001; I2 = 95.4%). The overall prevalence of sarcopenia with MCI was 9.1%
(95% CI: 0.047–0.134, P < 0.001; I2 = 93.0%). For overall ORs, there were 23 364 subjects with a mean age of
73 years; the overall adjusted OR between MCI and sarcopenia was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.31–1.62). Slight heterogeneity
in both adjusted ORs (P = 0.46; I2 = 0%) was noted across the studies. The prevalence of MCI is relatively high in pa-
tients with sarcopenia, and sarcopenia may be a risk factor for MCI.

Introduction

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a common disease in the el-
derly, is deﬁned as a type of cognitive disorder that can occur
as a stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal
ageing and dementia. More than 50% of patients with MCI
develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or other forms of dementia
within 4 to 6 years.1 With the progression of global ageing,
the number of patients diagnosed with dementia is increas-
ing rapidly. It is estimated that the global prevalence of de-
mentia is doubling every 20 years and the number of patients
could reach 131.5 million by 2050.2 Additionally, individuals
with MCI tend to experience more subjective cognitive con-
cerns,
impairment, self-rated health problems
and psychopathology.3 For instance, those with MCI are ap-
proximately twice as likely to have depressive symptoms
compared to similarly aged healthy adults, with more severe
levels of cognitive impairment predicting more severe
depression.4,5 Therefore, continued research into the early
detection and intervention of MCI is of vital importance for
the future of our elderly populations.

functional

Sarcopenia is a disease of age-related progressive, general-
ized loss of skeletal muscle and/or muscle strength resulting
from accumulated adverse muscle changes throughout life.
It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, frailty
and other adverse outcomes.6 Results from systematic re-
views and meta-analyses conﬁrm that patients with sarcope-
nia experience an impaired overall quality of life,7 increased
healthcare costs8 and even increased mortality.9 Studies de-
termining its incidence are sparse, though emerging evidence
suggests that its incidence increases progressively with age.
In order to mitigate its adverse health outcomes, reduce
the heavy burden on patients and the entire healthcare sys-
tem, more research in the ﬁeld of sarcopenia is being pur-
sued to prevent or delay the onset of this disease.9

Although there are many causes of disability in the elderly
population, sarcopenia and cognitive impairment in particu-
lar play an important role.10 Recently, the association be-
tween sarcopenia and cognitive decline has been demon-
strated in several studies. Data from China, Ghana, India,
Mexico and Russia show a positive association between sar-
copenia and MCI.11 However, not all the studies came to this
conclusion. For instance, an observational study from South
Africa identiﬁed that an inconsistent association may occur
between sarcopenia and MCI in countries with more pro-
nounced differences in income levels.11 In addition, the re-
ported prevalence of MCI in patients with sarcopenia has var-
ied widely, ranging from 7.5% to 69.3%.12

Despite strong suggestions from such studies that cogni-
tive impairment may be independently associated with
sarcopenia,13 there is a relative lack of research speciﬁcally
focusing on the occurrence and relationship of MCI and sar-
copenia. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review
and meta-analysis is to investigate the prevalence of MCI in

individuals with sarcopenia (MWS) and also the prevalence
of sarcopenia in participants with MCI (SWM) based on the
available data and to determine whether there is an indepen-
dent association between sarcopenia and MCI.

Methods

Study selection and selection criteria

We followed the recommendations of
the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
2020 statement (PRISMA 2020). A systematic search was per-
formed in ﬁve electronic databases: the Cochrane Library,
PubMed, Ovid, Embase and Web of Science. The search in-
‘sarcopenia’ and ‘cognitive impair-
cluded the keywords,
ment’, from database inception to 1 February 2022, and the
particular search strategies for all included databases can be
viewed in Appendix S1. The inclusion criteria were as follows:
(1) cross-sectional or cohort studies and (2) study population
involving patients with sarcopenia and/or MCI with clear di-
agnostic criteria. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
The original study did not involve or could not calculate the
number of those diagnosed with sarcopenia or MCI; (2) in-
ability to extract data; (3) literature reviews, case reports, an-
imal studies or conference abstracts; and (4) non-English
studies.

Data extraction

According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two re-
viewers (YY and MX) assessed the study eligibility indepen-
dently and made a ﬁnal decision after consulting with the ar-
bitrator
(Yongxue Yang). A standard procedure was
performed to extract the data from the studies, including
the ﬁrst author, publication date, country, study design, sam-
ple size, mean age, proportion of males, number of MWS and
SWM, and methods of evaluating sarcopenia and MCI (tech-
niques for measurement, diagnostic items and cut-off values,
and all pertinent covariates modifying the relationship be-
tween sarcopenia and MCI). The main outcomes of interest
were the prevalence of MWS and the approximate and ad-
justed association between MCI and sarcopenia, expressed
in odds ratios (ORs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs). Re-
sults were adjusted for various confounding factors.

Research quality assessment

The quality of each study was independently scored by two
researchers (YY and LL) and assessed using the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies and the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for cross-sectional

studies.14 The highest score for cohort studies was 9 points,
and the highest score for cross-sectional studies was 11
points. A higher score indicated a better quality method,
and studies with a score >7 in the NOS or 8 in the AHRQ
were regarded as moderate-to-high credibility14,15 (Appendix
S2). For any disagreements, YY and LL consulted with Yongxue
Yang to reach a ﬁnal resolution.

(Appendix S4).17,18 All data analyses were performed using
the meta package in Stata, Version 12.0 (StataCorp LLC, TX,

Statistical analyses

In our meta-analysis, we applied a random-effects model to
obtain a relatively conservative ﬁnding when the I2 test de-
tected signiﬁcant heterogeneity statistically (I2 > 50%,
P < 0.05). A ﬁxed-effects model was otherwise applied if no
signiﬁcant heterogeneity was detected.16,17 To identify poten-
tial sources of heterogeneity, we performed meta-regression
and subgroup analyses. We further performed sensitivity anal-
yses by evaluating the quality and robustness of the results by
deleting one study at a time (Appendix S3). In addition, publi-
cation bias was evaluated with the Egger test and Begg test

The ﬂow diagrams of the literature selection process are
shown in Figure 1. A total of 13 studies and 27 428 patients
were included in our analysis. Seven studies were focused
on the prevalence of MWS,11–13,19–22 four studies included
the prevalence of SWM20,23–25 and only one of them men-
tioned both the prevalence of MWS and SWM.20 One study
reported whether MCI was a risk factor for sarcopenia,26
whereas 10 studies analysed whether sarcopenia was a risk
factor for MCI.11–13,21–25,27,28 Except for two studies,19,20
the rest of them and the study by Beeri et al.,28 in particular,
all raised the question about the association of MCI with

reviewing the full text are as follows: (1) We were unable
to obtain the required full data, even after contacting the cor-
responding author of a study, and (2) manuscripts were not
formal research investigations (e.g., letter to the editor and
conference abstract).

America. The majority of the study population were recruited
from the community or outpatient clinics. One study’s data,
which came from Mexico, did not clearly indicate whether
their sample was from a community or hospital population.21
Ten studies employed a cross-sectional design, and three
studies were cohort based.21,25,28 Among the included stud-
ies, though seven were considered to be of moderate quality,
they did not negatively bias the outcome based on our sensi-
tivity analyses.

further assessed via methods

Sarcopenia was mainly diagnosed based on consensus agree-
ments by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS), Eu-
ropean Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People
(EWGSOP) and Foundation for the National Institutes of Health
(FNIH).
such as
the Japanese version of the simple 5-item questionnaire
(SARC-F-J), and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) or low skeletal
muscle mass (SMM). To diagnose MCI, three studies used the
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), one applied the
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), one applied the
Japanese version of the MoCA (MoCA-J), two were evaluated
by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ),
two used guidelines set by the National Institute on Aging—
Alzheimer’s Association (NIAAA) and, ﬁnally, one assessed MCI
by administering the Test Your Memory (TYM) test, and one
assessed MCI by administering the TYM Japanese version
(TYM-J). The details of the diagnostic criteria and cut-off points
for sarcopenia and MCI in each study have been listed in Appen-
dix S5.

Meta-analysis results

Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment with sarcopenia
Results The pooled MWS prevalence was 20.5% in a total
sample of 2923 cases of sarcopenia and 598 of MCI (95%

CI: 0.140–0.269) with a high level of heterogeneity
(P < 0.001; I2 = 95.4%; Figure 2).

meta-regression analysis of
Meta-regression was performed to explore the relationship
between MWS and mean age, diagnostic criteria and the di-
agnostic items of sarcopenia and MCI, population source
and study type. The meta-regression found that none of
these variables were signiﬁcant.

Subgroup analyses Table 2 showed the results of the sub-
group analysis of the prevalence of MWS. The subgroup anal-
ysis showed that the prevalence of MWS was 0.182 (95% CI:
0.090–0.273) in the group diagnosed with sarcopenia accord-
ing to SMM and functional status; 0.171 (95% CI: 0.106–
0.236) in the group diagnosed according to AWGS guidelines;
and 0.693 (95% CI: 0.564–0.822) in the group diagnosed ac-
cording to the SARC-F-J assessment. Similarly, because of dif-
ferent cognitive evaluation methods, various results were ob-
tained. The prevalence of MWS was 0.182 (95% CI: 0.090–
0.273) in the group diagnosed with MCI used NIAAA criteria
and 0.131 (95% CI: 0.108–0.154) in the group evaluated ac-
cording to SPMSQ methods. There were six cross-sectional
studies describing the prevalence of MWS with a combined
prevalence of 0.214 (95% CI: 0.145–0.282). Compared with
the community population, the prevalence of MWS in hospi-
talized patients was not found to be signiﬁcantly different
(0.189 [95% CI: 0.125–0.254] and 0.372 [95% CI: (cid:1)0.251 to
0.995], respectively). In addition, subgroup analysis showed
that the patients with body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2
had a high prevalence of MWS (0.341 [95% CI: 0.040–
0.641]) (meta graph for subgroup analysis can be viewed in
Appendix S6).

aAs mentioned in the ﬂowchart, a total of seven studies involved the prevalence of MWS, but one of them11 mentioned relevant data from
six countries, so a total of 12 groups of data were analysed in Table 2.
bAs mentioned in the ﬂowchart, a total of four studies dealt with the prevalence of SWM, but one study23 used two different ways to as-
sess sarcopenia, so there are a total of ﬁve sets of data analysis in the subgroup analysis.

Prevalence of sarcopenia with mild cognitive impairment
Results There were 1770 cases of MCI and 116 of sarcopenia
in the included studies. The overall prevalence of SWM was
0.091 (95% CI: 0.047–0.134, P < 0.001; I2 = 93.0%) (Figure 3).

Subgroup analyses Table 2 also displayed the results of the
subgroup analysis of the prevalence of SWM. The subgroup
analysis showed that the prevalence of SWM was 0.158

(95% CI: 0.102–0.213) in the group diagnosed with sarcope-
nia according to AWGS guidelines; 0.063 (95% CI: (cid:1)0.028 to
0.154) in the group diagnosed with sarcopenia according to
EWGSOP methods; and 0.032 (95% CI: 0.018–0.046) in the
group diagnosed according to FNIH criteria. Analogously, dif-
ferent cognitive assessment methods also have some impact
on the prevalence of SWM;
the prevalence of SWM

assessment tools. Different study designs also have a certain
impact on the results, and the combined prevalence of three
cross-sectional studies was 0.078 (95% CI: 0.034–0.123).
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the prevalence of
SWM in hospitals and in the community (0.059 [95% CI:
0.027–0.092] and 0.187 [95% CI: 0.138–0.236], respectively).
In addition, subgroup analysis showed that patients with
BMI < 25 kg/m2 had a high prevalence of SWM (0.173
[95% CI: 0.122–0.224]). The prevalence of SWM in male
was 0.030 (95% CI: 0.021–0.039) (meta graph for this sub-
group analysis was shown in Appendix S6).

Odds ratio results
Ten studies with 23 364 subjects (mean age of 73 years) were
able to be included for calculation of the overall OR (Table 3).
The overall adjusted OR between MCI and sarcopenia was
1.46 (95% CI: 1.31–1.62). Mild heterogeneity in both adjusted
ORs (P = 0.46; I2 = 0%) was noted across the studies (Figure 4).
Only one study speciﬁcally suggested that MCI was also a risk
factor for sarcopenia, and the adjusted OR between them
was 6.35 (95% CI: 1.62–34.96).26

Meta-regression analyses Meta-regression analysis suggested
that study type was associated with heterogeneity between
studies (β = 0.236, SE = 0.110, P = 0.049). The relevant results
of meta-regression were shown in Table 4.

Subgroup analyses Results of the subgroup analyses showed
that the adjusted OR between MCI and sarcopenia was 1.55
(95% CI: 1.27–1.89) in the group diagnosed with sarcopenia
according to AWGS guidelines and 1.62 (95% CI: 1.35–1.93)
in those diagnosed according to SMM and functional status
assessments. Among the included studies, there were eight
methods of assessing MCI. The adjusted OR were as follows:
1.55 (95% CI: 0.80–2.99) in the group diagnosed using TYM
test, 2.02 (95% CI: 0.57–7.08) in the group diagnosed using
MMSE and 1.62 (95% CI: 1.35–1.93) in the group diagnosed

using the NIAAA criteria. Sarcopenia was found to be one of
the risk factors for MCI, regardless of community-dwelling
status or hospital admission (OR 1.47 [95% CI: 1.28–1.68],
I2 = 16.1%; OR 1.73 [95% CI: 1.09–2.74], I2 = 0%; respectively).
Different study types were found to have similar results. The
adjusted OR was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.40–1.83) in cross-sectional
studies and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.07–1.49) in cohort studies. In ad-
dition, the OR between MCI and sarcopenia was 1.63 (95% CI:
1.04–2.57) in patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and 1.98 (95% CI:
1.42–2.76) in those with BMI < 25 kg/m2. Last but not least,
in the gender subgroup, the adjusted OR was 1.55 (95% CI:
0.80–2.99) in male. The relevant results were shown in
Appendix S8.

Discussion

Our study is the ﬁrst systematic review and meta-analysis to
focus on the prevalence on SWM and MWS and the correla-
tion between them. Based on 13 studies with 27 428 cases,
the pooled prevalence of MWS was 20.5%, which
corresponded to a 9.1% prevalence of SWM. At the same
time, we found that there was a positive correlation between
sarcopenia and MCI, and this relationship remained un-
changed after adjustment for related covariates.

Risk factors and predictors of dementia remain an intense
area of investigation. The annual per capita conversion rate
from normal cognition to MCI is 30%.29 Moreover, the propor-
tion of those with MCI who eventually develop dementia in-
creases progressively with age,30 with the prevalence of AD al-
most doubling every 5 years after age 65.31 As sarcopenia is
highly prevalent in those with dementia,32,33 our study
highlighting its early presence in MCI suggests another avenue
of research to pursue. However, based on our results, age
alone cannot explain the strong correlation between MCI

and sarcopenia. First, sarcopenia shares common risk factors
with cognitive impairment, such as cerebrovascular diseases,
diabetes and hypertension.30,34,35 Additionally, the chronic
state of inﬂammation caused by immunosenescence and
the increased secretion of cytokines may have detrimental
consequences. High levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, tumour
necrosis factor-α and C-reactive protein have been studied
as potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sar-
copenia. Dysregulation of the inﬂammatory pathway may si-
multaneously be involved in the pathophysiological mecha-
nisms
studies
demonstrate that the Mediterranean diet with high-quality
protein intake may reduce the risk of MCI. The equilibrium
between muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein levels
may be a major contributor to the aetiology of muscle atro-
phy in patients with sarcopenia.38–40 Therefore, insufﬁcient
nutritional supplementation may also be one of the reasons
for the co-occurrence of MCI and sarcopenia.

of MCI.36,37

epidemiological

Last,

Our results also demonstrated that the prevalence of MWS
(20.5%) is higher than that of the prevalence of SWM (9.1%).
This may be related to the following reasons. Sarcopenia is
primarily due to low muscle strength.41 Inactivity and inade-
quate rehabilitation programmes for sarcopenia may further
reduce the amount of physical activity. Past studies have
shown that physical activity promotes cognitive improvement
and stability; however, resistance training programmes are
still seriously underutilized.42,43 It has also been suggested
that brain atrophy and loss of muscle mass may co-occur in
patients with sarcopenia.35,44 These pathophysiological
mechanisms are thought to predispose patients with sarco-
penia to cognitive decline. On the other hand, patients with
MCI have little limitation in physical activity.45,46 Cognitive
decline may lead to loss of appetite and decreased food in-
take. However, protein-energy malnutrition is often more
pronounced after the onset of dementia and is less pro-
nounced in patients with MCI.43,47 Thus, patients with MCI
are less likely to develop sarcopenia due to low activity and
malnutrition.

Our meta-analysis subgroup analyses revealed signiﬁcant
heterogeneity in MCI measurement methods, diagnostic
criteria for sarcopenia, study demographics and study design.
The prevalence of MWS and SWM deﬁned by the SARC-F-J
criteria was found to be the highest, whereas the AWGS ap-
proach and EWGSOP guidelines reﬂected the lowest associ-
ated prevalence. Additionally, the correlation between MCI
and sarcopenia was calculated to be higher using the SARC-
F-J criteria. As such, the use of different diagnostic tools
may lead to different prevalence estimates of MWS and
SWM or the correlation between MCI and sarcopenia. Previ-
ous studies have clearly demonstrated that the sensitivity of
the SARC-F-J for the assessment of sarcopenia is low,12 and
other studies that used SMM also mentioned that these
methods lacked objective measurement data and direct
assessments11;
advised with using
non-objective muscle strength and mass to assess sarcopenia.
The EWGSOP approach to diagnosing sarcopenia reported a
lower prevalence than the FNIH and AWGS-deﬁned guide-
lines,
indicating that this method considering low muscle
mass combined with low muscle strength objectively was
stricter than that of a single metric, which is similar to what
was previously reported with Yang et al.’s study.48 Because
dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or bioelectrical im-
pedance analysis (BIA) has a higher sensitivity for the diagno-
sis of sarcopenia,49,50 there is potential that in the future,
there will be more studies using more objective methods to
assess sarcopenia to further discuss the relationship of sarco-
penia and MCI.

Notably, heterogeneous MCI assessment tools also af-
fected our results. All of these approaches (except for the
TYM test and the MMSE) were able to detect that sarcopenia
may be a risk factor for MCI. However, the results of using the
TYM, SPMSQ and MMSE methods to assess cognition appear
to be unreliable. This may be related to the limitations of
these scales themselves. The TYM test, a simple 10-task
self-assessment cognitive screening instrument, has been re-
ported to reduce the speciﬁcity of MCI and thus is usually not

a recognized diagnostic method for MCI.23 Similarly, the
SPMSQ involves using a 10-item short portable mental state
questionnaire, whose instrument might introduce potential
problems with subjective bias associated with questionnaire
surveys.13 A meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies
clearly indicate the MoCA to be superior to MMSE in discrim-
inating between individuals with MCI and no cognitive im-
pairment or MCI and healthy elderly individuals.51 Therefore,
TYM, SPMSQ and MMSE may lack comparative advantages in
the assessment of MCI. In our study, whether SWM, MWS or
their correlations, the results of the MoCA assessment re-
mained at a neutral level, indicating the stability of the scale.
This is consistent with other research ﬁndings,52 and as such,
we recommend the use of the MoCA scale for future MCI
studies.

Last but not least, there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity
between the main studies despite how the included studies
had various differences in countries, settings, diagnostic
methods, measurement approaches, diagnostic thresholds
and unreported comorbidities in our causal analysis of sarco-
penia and MCI. Our study had several limitations. First, our
search strategy was limited to English-only studies, which
could have excluded high-quality, non-English studies. Next,
the number of studies was low, and most of our included
studies consisted of cross-sectional designs. We further dis-
covered that in the study-type subgroup analysis, the preva-
lence of SWM in cohort studies (13%) was higher than that
in cross-sectional studies (7.8%); thus, this likely skewed the
results. Seven of the cross-sectional studies we included also
did not meet high-quality criteria; however, this was not
found to be signiﬁcant in our sensitivity analyses. Neverthe-
less, more high-quality longitudinal studies in the future that
explore the association between sarcopenia and MCI and its
underlying mechanisms would be beneﬁcial. Finally, no classi-
ﬁcation of cut-off values for MCI and sarcopenia has been
well established yet; in other words, no attention was paid
to the impact of their severity on the results. Future studies
that are able to explore and stratify different degrees of sar-
copenia would be helpful for the improvement of outcome
assessments.

Conclusion and future direction

In conclusion, our meta-analysis reveals that the prevalence
of MWS and SWM is high. Furthermore, there is a signiﬁcant
association between sarcopenia and MCI. Based on our sub-
group analyses, we found that the heterogeneity of the eval-
uation criteria of MCI or sarcopenia, populations and study
designs was high. Our results suggest that clinicians should
have a low threshold to screen for MCI in patients with sarco-
penia and researchers should continue to work on recogniz-
ing the mutual inﬂuence of MCI and sarcopenia in the future
of elderly care and management work. These measures may
facilitate the earlier identiﬁcation of sarcopenia and MCI,
thereby delaying disease progression, improving the quality
of life of the elderly and reducing social and economic bur-
dens. Prospective cohort studies of large sample size should
be conducted to further unify measurement tools for MCI
and sarcopenia and to establish a global consensus for the di-
agnostic criteria. Additionally, some well-designed basic sci-
ence studies are also warranted to explore the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms of MCI and sarcopenia.
