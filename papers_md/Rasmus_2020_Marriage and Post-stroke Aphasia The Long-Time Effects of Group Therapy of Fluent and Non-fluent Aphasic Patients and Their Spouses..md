Background: Studies of therapy inﬂuence on after-aphasia marital relations are lacking.
Much needs to be learned about the range of factors associated with couples beneﬁting
from therapy. Understanding these issues is key to facilitating optimal post-aphasia
outcomes from the perspective of the patient and his caretaking spouse. This paper
reports an evaluation of a group therapy intervention conducted with aphasic people
and their life partners.

Methods: The intervention comprised of 10 sessions of approximately 90 min duration
and included two groups of couples, with ﬂuent and non-ﬂuent aphasic partner. The
therapy program consisted of basic communication activities within the group which
encouraged sharing of personal experience but mostly relied on psychoeducation,
gaining knowledge about after-stroke aphasia. The respondents were interviewed and
completed neuropsychological assessment. Quality of marriage was determined using
Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Marital adjustment was measured twice, before intervention
and after 6 months. Long-time effects of therapy included a signiﬁcant mean difference
in quality of marriage between therapy attendants and controls. Marital relationship
decline seems to be worse amongst control subjects, who were not involved in any
kind of psychological support. In spite of initial non-distressed relationship they report
deterioration of their bond in half a year’s time. We also showed changes in dynamics of
quality of marriage during this time in all investigated groups. The implications of these
ﬁndings for counseling services are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

There is extensive literature on aphasia and it’s various every-day life consequences. As an acquired
language disorder, most commonly caused by a stroke, it falls under a deﬁnition of a stress
related crisis. Experiencing a sudden and unpredicted life event can impair or entirely destroy the
ability to continue the tasks related to family cycle and its development (Carter and McGoldrick,
1988). Very early in time researchers tried to apply a crisis model to explain family reactions to

studies proved destructive inﬂuence of aphasia on family
functioning (Pound et al., 1999; Northcott et al., 2016).

generates stress (Simmons-Mackie et al., 2010). In result, family
system’s crisis is most visible after 4–6 months (Pa¸chalska, 1999;
Orłowska and Jodzio, 2018).

Amongst the factors destabilizing the family system the loss
or change of life roles, changes in everyday activities and general
emotional crisis are most commonly mentioned (Masterson-
Algar et al., 2018). Aphasia impairs functioning in previous roles
both occupational and as a family member (Brady et al., 2011;
Martinsen et al., 2012). This shift changes the system dynamics
and is often a cause of tension. It burdens the marital relations
and inhibits behaviors based on mutual reciprocity (Carlsson
et al., 2007). Patients may have diﬃculty with accepting help
and families struggle with coping with many short and long
term consequences of taking care of aphasic patient (Brady
et al., 2011; Martinsen et al., 2012; Adamit et al., 2015). Family
members reactions vary from overprotection to depreciation.
Most researchers agree, however, that dyadic relationship after
the illness onset is no longer based on partnership (Dalemans
et al., 2010; Anderson and Whitﬁeld, 2013; Pertl et al., 2019).

Of course, it would be unfounded to claim, that after-aphasia
changes in dyadic bond between spouses are always identical as
there are many factors inﬂuencing quality of marriage. Godwin
et al. (2011) note the marked variability of separation and divorce
rates across even large sample studies, ranging from ﬁfteen to
seventy-eight per cent. Authors highlight qualitatively distinct
problems experienced by couples post-injury who do remain
together. Therefore our study focuses on couples with initial
positive relationship and follows the changes in their marriage
evaluations after aphasia’s onset.

Some research indicate important role of aphasia’s type both in
general quality of life and quality of marital relationship changes
caused by the illness. Achten et al. (2012) found that patients with
Broca and mixed non-ﬂuent aphasia reported worse quality of
life than patients with anomic aphasia. As there are few reports
on this kind of long-term changes in this aspects, this hypothesis
still requires empirical veriﬁcation (Ellis and Peach, 2017). In
our previous studies we found aphasias type to be a signiﬁcant
factor in marital communication changes (Orłowska, 2012). The
relation between aphasia’s type and marital relationship still
requires scientiﬁc investigation, therefore this issue has been
addressed in our recent study.

Changes in family relations of aphasic patients have to
be considered as dynamic and dependent on time factor.
One, because of individual progress in rehabilitation of each
patient and two, because of general phases of illness. Literature
often presents basic aphasia’s stage division including: (1)
acute phase (including patient’s hospitalization) (2) intensive
speech rehabilitation phase and (3) chronic phase (including
patient’s discharge and retuning home). Each stage has its
own emotional and organizational consequences and may be
connected with diﬀerent goals. As such marital relationship
changes also may ﬂuctuate. It seems, that during ﬁrst months
after hospitalization aphasic patients family confronts lack of
control over overall situation. After that ﬁghting with illness
stops being perceived as a challenge. Also rehabilitation eﬀects
can be seen as to slow and far from the previous image. This
disparity reveals actual deﬁcits in every day functioning and

There are many propositions on how to address aphasia’s
various consequences for families in therapy. Some researchers
addressed this issue inquiring about goals family members have
for themselves before therapy. Amongst others, most commonly
reported were: (1) to maintain their relationship with the
person with aphasia, (2) to be given information, (3) to be
given support (Sherratt et al., 2011; Howe et al., 2012). As
meta-analysis reports suggest, therapy interventions for aphasic
patients and their spouses in social context usually take one of
three forms (Simmons-Mackie et al., 2010). First of all it can
be a typical training facilitating new resources and strategies
of communication between the aphasic patient and his/her
partner. Second form addresses psychosocial consequences of
aphasia (for example depression, anxiety, and isolation) and
engages general psychological counseling (Haun et al., 2008).
Third form includes educational programs based on sharing
knowledge about aphasia, diﬀerent behaviors connected with
this illness and possible diﬃculties a patient may encounter in
daily life. This form was proved to be connected with improving
family functioning of after-stroke and aphasic patients early on
(Evans et al., 1988). Most research evaluating therapy eﬀects
concentrates on improvement in communication or lessening
psychological burden, excluding the actual relationship between
spouses (Thompson et al., 2002; Simmons-Mackie et al., 2010).
As above mentioned therapy approaches are very diﬀerent, it
is diﬃcult to compare their eﬀectiveness. Nevertheless most
studies indicate improvement, both in spouse’s and patient’s
functioning, when daily life activities, communication and
other psychosocial aspects are considered. Sadly communication
therapies eﬀects seem more long-lasting while psychosocial
interventions improves functioning during therapy and shortly
after (Brown et al., 2010; Anderson and Whitﬁeld, 2013). Little
is known about eﬀects of therapy on marital relationship as
most studies focus on beneﬁts in general psychosocial and
physical wellbeing and quality of life and rarely include the
perspective of aphasic patients (Cheng et al., 2014). There is some
evidence on needs of family members being related to aphasias
time post-onset. At the onset of aphasia, during hospitalization
family members rated information about aphasia as most
important, followed by psychosocial support and hopefulness
(Avent et al., 2011). As these goals are in accordance with
those reported by people with aphasia (Worall et al., 2011)
we decided to choose education-oriented approach with the
element of support-giving and couples therapy. According to
Family Systems Theory it is important to identify exchanges of
behavior that take place in a given moment of interaction between
members of the family or dyad. Those patterns of interaction
that spouses maintain, and perpetuate can sustain problematic
behavior and ineﬀective communication (Johnson and Ray,
2016). This aspect of family interaction is especially important
in the communication-based systems approach (Watzlawick
et al., 1967). As people are constantly trying to deﬁne the
nature of their relationship attending group therapy meetings for
couples experiencing aphasia related diﬃculties may be beneﬁcial

to understanding and changing their communication patterns.
In addition group therapy can lead to signiﬁcant increase in
personal resources (Yalom and Leszcz, 2005) which add to family
potential, useful in adapting to life after-stroke. Consequently this
kind of intervention can lead to discharging tension in marital
relationship and more eﬀective communication between spouses.

Research Aims
There has been limited evaluation of group therapy and its
inﬂuence on quality of marriage of aphasic couples. Therefore
our current study aims to evaluate the eﬀects and applicability of
group therapy for couples, based on psychoeducation and social
support, on marital adjustment. This research also illustrates the
role of aphasia’s type, being in the position of care giver/receiver
and time factor in order to grasp long-term eﬀects of applied
intervention. Speciﬁcally, we tested one hypothesis derived based
on available literature and our previous research there is a
signiﬁcant mean diﬀerence in quality of marriage between
therapy attendants and controls after 6 months time.

We also state an explorative questions: (1) Is there a signiﬁcant
change in dynamics of changes in quality of marriage during
6 months in all investigated groups?; (2) Are there any aspects of
marriage adjustment that beneﬁt from therapy more than others?

Sample
Research data used in this program evaluation study was
regularly collected and archived as a means of evaluating
treatment eﬃcacy. The research was conducted initially at
3 Polish neurology hospital
the time of
3 years. The respondents were selected amongst patients
recently experiencing after-stroke aphasia and their spouses.
the initial
These patients were in-patients at
interview. Patients after one left hemisphere stroke with mild
or moderate ﬂuent or non-ﬂuent aphasia as conﬁrmed in the
Cracow Neurolinguistic Aphasia Battery CNAB (Pachalska et al.,
1995) (>75 Aphasia Quotient, AQ) and medical investigation.
All participants had to able to comprehend questions and
indicate their consent. They also had to live within the local
urban/exurban area for the purposes of attending group therapy
and follow-up. Participants were informed of the nature and
purpose of gathering treatment outcome measures, noting the
use of the collected data would assist in providing eﬀective of
other aphasic couples in the future. The importance of their
consent was stressed as permission to use the collected data
in published research studies was requested and received from
the subjects. Participants were assured that their conﬁdentiality
would be maintained throughout the archival and evaluation
process. From the initial cohort of 150 couples 96 conﬁrmed
interest in therapy. Later 16 initially selected couples resigned
during ﬁrst 2 weeks of treatment, due to external factors. Finally
four experimental groups have been randomly selected out of
80 couples, each comprising of 20 subjects: (1) patients with
ﬂuent aphasia (FAP) (2) spouses of patients with ﬂuent aphasia

(FAPS) (3) patients with non-ﬂuent aphasia (NFAP) (4) spouses
of patients with non-ﬂuent aphasia (NFAPS).

Control subjects were recruited in similar fashion amongst 54
couples (in-patients and their spouses) not interested in therapy
or otherwise not able to attend the meetings due to external
factors. Suitable sampling was conducted in order to match
control and experimental group subjects considering basic factors
like: gender, education, age, and aphasia type.

All

the respondents were married with the mean of
the duration of marriage of 19.26 years, with no previous
divorce record.

Exclusion Criteria
In order to capture the marital changes related to experiencing
aphasia couples with initial marital problems were eliminated
from the study. Using criteria described by Jacobson et al.
(1984) couples whose general Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS)
score was equal to or less than 97 were classiﬁed as martially
distressed, whereas couples whose DAS scores were greater than
97 before therapy were classiﬁed as martially non-distressed
and were excluded from further examination. Patients were also
disqualiﬁed if they previously experienced brain injury or stroke,
suﬀered from dementia or other neurological disease before or
during our investigation. All subjects were conﬁrmed to not
suﬀer from severe mental problems like depression, anxiety,
drugs, or alcohol abuse or family violence. In order to eliminate
severe mental health problems authors used clinical interview,
medical history analysis, as well as Modiﬁed Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale HADS-M (Walden-Gałuszko and Majkowicz,
2000) with the cut-oﬀ point of 7. Due to communication
diﬃculties all patients with severe aphasia were considered as not
suitable and as such not considered in this study.

Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between therapy groups and controls
in age
education, number of years married or initial quality of marriage.
All respondents were married with the mean of the duration
of marriage of 19.26 years and expressed consent by desire.
Respondents basic characteristics and demographic data are
presented in Table 1.

Procedure
In our study a double assessment procedure was applied. The
ﬁrst examination was carried out during hospitalization within
3 weeks after the illness onset. The second examination took
place 6 months after the ﬁrst, and was conducted at the patient’s
home environment.

The therapy comprised of 10 once a week sessions of
approximately 90 min duration and included two separate
groups of couples, with ﬂuent and non-ﬂuent aphasic partner.
The program was derived from classic guidebooks, especially
“Understanding aphasia” (Pa¸chalska, 1993) and based on
Aphasia Couples Therapy (ACT) encouraging a group therapy
form (Boles and Lewis, 2001). We decided to combine
education-oriented approach with the element of support-
giving and couples therapy (Boles and Lewis, 2001; Boles,
2006, 2009, 2011). First
two meetings were dedicated to
educating couples on aphasia. Later sessions were less direct

diagnosis we administered Cracow Neurolinguistic Battery of
Aphasia (CNBAE).

All participants had been interviewed, screened with Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE, with cutoﬀ <24 points) for
dementia and diagnosed with Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) in order to determine levels of anxiety and
depression. Its psychometric proprieties were proven to be
acceptable, also on Polish in-patients. Using the cut-oﬀ value
≥7 points, the results on post-stroke Polish population were
as following: depression subscale – sensitivity: 90.0%, speciﬁcity
92.2%, anxiety subscale: sensitivity: 86.5%, speciﬁcity 94.9%,
which was the most optimal cut-oﬀ point. Cronbach α: for the
depression subscale was 0.892, for the anxiety subscale was 0.815.
All subjects after initial evaluation were approached and asked
to provide information about their relationship with the partner.

Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS; Spanier, 1976; Cie´slak, 1989)
was administered at pre-treatment and post-treatment (after
6 months) to measure of marital quality of life of both healthy
spouses and their aphasic partners. This self-report scale is
divided into 4 subscales : (1) Dyadic Consensus – degree to which
respondent agrees with partner; (2) Dyadic Satisfaction – degree
to which respondent feels satisﬁed with partner; (3) Dyadic
Cohesion –degree to which respondent and partner participate
in activities together; (4) Aﬀectional Expression –degree to
which respondent agrees with partner regarding emotional
aﬀection. Summing the scores for all four subscales yields a
total dyadic adjustment score. DAS has been shown to have
high internal consistency, discriminant eﬃciency. Compared
with other measures of global marital satisfaction it is more
sensitive to treatment eﬀects (Whisman and Jacobson, 1992). It
has been previously used on similar cohorts (Łapkiewicz et al.,
2008; Kieﬀer-Kristensen and Teasdale, 2011; Ghedin et al., 2017).
Dyadic Adjustment Scale has also been used in numerous
studies to examine marital satisfaction in older adults (Carr
et al., 2000; O’Rourke, 2005; Yorgason et al., 2006; Garand
et al., 2007). It has demonstrated excellent reliability with a
total scale Cronbach’s coeﬃcient alpha of 0.96 (Spanier, 1976).
In addition, other investigators have reported comparable
values with subscale internal consistency reliabilities ranging
from 0.73 to 0.92 for Dyadic Consensus, 0.77 to 0.94 for
Dyadic Satisfaction, 0.58 to 0.73 for Aﬀectional Expression,
and 0.72 to 0.86 for Dyadic Consensus (Spanier, 2001).

Marriage and Post-stroke Aphasia

of variance to analyze whether the therapy attendance and
aphasia’s type inﬂuence marital adjustment of aphasic patients
and their care-giving spouses. Time was an intra-object factor
measured on two levels (pretest-before the therapy and posttest-
6 months after). Dependent variable was the quality of marriage,
measured with Dyadic Adjustment Scale (general score, and
four subscales: marital consensus, cohesion, satisfaction and
aﬀectional expression). Analysis of variance was conducted in
multivariate model. If a main eﬀect of aphasia’s type, therapy
or time (pretest and posttest) or an inter− action was found,
post hoc analysis was carried out for designed group diﬀerences
on DAS scores. Post hoc pairwise comparisons consisted of
Bonferroni test. Hypothesis tests used α = 0.05 as the criterion
for signiﬁcant eﬀects.

Our hypothesis states that

there is a signiﬁcant mean
diﬀerence in quality of marriage between therapy attendants and
controls after 6 months time. As mentioned before, our previous
studies show, that experiencing ﬂuent or non-ﬂuent aphasia
has diﬀerent consequences for marital adjustment and it is also
important for marital bond if a spouse is a healthy care-giver
or aphasic care receiver. In order to control those variables that
can inﬂuence the main eﬀect of therapy we decided to create four
criteria groups. As such our investigated variables include:

– Dependent variable: marital adjustment.
– Independent variable: group therapy attendance.
– Controlled variables:

• Aphasia’s type experienced by one of

the spouses

(ﬂuent or non-ﬂuent).

• The role in the relationship after stroke (being an aphasic

patient or caregiving spouse).

In order to show eﬀect of
therapy in each four criteria
groups we compared marital adjustment scores of ﬂuent aphasic
patients attending and not attending therapy (FAP therapy and
control groups), non-ﬂuent aphasic patients attending and not
attending therapy (NFAP), spouses of people experiencing ﬂuent
aphasia attending and not attending therapy (FAPS) and spouses
of people experiencing non-ﬂuent aphasia attending and not
attending therapy, both in pretest and posttest. We used paired
t-student test to show those diﬀerences.

As we also state an explorative questions concerning dynamics
of changes in quality of marriage in time during 6 months in
and aspects of marriage adjustment that beneﬁt from therapy
we analyzed within-group changes in marital adjustment level
comparing pretest and posttest DAS score in each investigated
group. We decided on running this analyses separately for each
criteria group (FAP, NFAP, FAPS, and NFAPS) with separation
of subjects attending and not attending therapy (therapy and
controls). We used online calculator to illustrate size eﬀect of
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between compared groups or
test–retest scores with Cohen’s d values.

RESULTS

The relationship between aphasia’s type, therapy attendance,
time factor general Dyadic Adjustment Scale scores in patients

population is presented in Table 2. For DAS total score there was
a main eﬀect for time and therapy attendance [F(1,76) = 5.01;

patients not included in intervention (FAP controls). The mean
general score in DAS for FAP controls in pretest (M = 107.3,
SD = 14.80) was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p = 0.029), dCohen = 0.66
than general DAS score for FAP controls in posttest (M = 93.20;
SD = 26.08). However, there was no other signiﬁcant diﬀerences
for other groups in time.

The relationship between aphasia’s type, therapy attendance,
time factor general Dyadic Adjustment Scale scores provided by
caregiving spouses of aphasic people is showed in Table 3. For
DAS total score there was a main eﬀect for therapy attendance
[F(1,76) = 8.85; p = 0.004, η2
p = 0.10]. Post hoc comparisons
using the Bonferroni test indicated no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between groups chosen according to our hypothesis. Nevertheless
there were also two eﬀects for aphasias type in interaction
with time [F(1,76) = 21.99; p < 0.001; η2
p = 0.22] and therapy
attendance interacting with time [F(1,76) = 12.96, p < 0,001,
η2
p = 0.15]. Bonferroni post hoc test revealed the FAPS controls
general scores in pretest (M = 107.50; SD = 19.45) were
higher (p < 0.001, dCohen = 0.82) than in posttest (M = 91.60,
SD = 19.25). Similarly, NFAPS therapy general DAS scores
signiﬁcantly dropped in time (p < 0.001; dCohen = 1.89) (from
M = 120.15, SD = 10.54 to M = 101.00, SD = 9,68). Spouses
of non-ﬂuent aphasic people not attending therapy (NFAPS
controls) also evaluated general marital adjustment signiﬁcantly
higher (p < 0,001, dCohen = 1,49) initially (M = 114.95,
SD = 14.84) than in second assessment after 6 months (M = 86.70,
SD = 22.59).

The relationship between aphasia’s type, therapy attendance,
time factor Dyadic Adjustment Scale in consensus scores
provided by aphasic patients as reﬂected by ANOVA results
is presented in Table 4. Data analysis showed signiﬁcant
eﬀect for interaction of aphasia’s type and therapy attendance
F(1,76) = 4,68; p = 0,034; η2
p = 0,06. Post hoc comparisons using
the Bonferroni test indicated no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
groups except ﬂuent aphasic patients (FAP) in second assessment.
Fluent aphasic patients attending the meetings evaluate marital
consensus (p = 0.009; dCohen = 1.00) higher (M = 49.75, SD = 8.04)
than those not involved in therapy (M = 40.80, SD = 9,74). There
were also signiﬁcant eﬀects of interaction of time and therapy
attendance [F(1,76) = 10,79, p = 0,001, η2
p = 0,12] and time,
therapy attendance and aphasia’s type [F(1,76) = 7,16; p = 0,009;
η2
p = 0,09]. Post hoc Bonferroni test revealed ﬂuent aphasic

assessment. There was also signiﬁcant eﬀect of interaction of time
with aphasia’s type [F(1,76) = 10.36, p = 0.002, η2

with therapy attendance [F(1,76) = 4.5, p = 0.037, η2 = 0.06]. As
proven in post hoc Bonferroni t-test, evaluations of subjects from
FAPS group, without therapy intervention, drop signiﬁcantly
(p = 0.018, dCohen = 1.00) over time (pretest M = 50.00, SD = 9.99

consensus scores in time (pretest M = 54.90, SD = 6.75 versus
posttest M = 43.90, SD = 7.62). This eﬀect can be conﬁrmed
also for NFAPS subjects not attending the meetings as their

η2 = 0.06] and also aphasia’s type and time factor [F(1,76) = 29.56;
p < 0,001; η2
p = 0.28]. Post hoc Bonferroni test revealed the
spouses of non-ﬂuent aphasic patients not attending therapy
(NFAPS controls) were less satisﬁed (p < 0.001, dCohen = 1.55)
with their marriage after 6 months’ time (pretest M = 36.70,
SD = 8.15, posttest M = 25.75, SD = 5.73). Additionally,
spouses of people with non-ﬂuent aphasic people involved in
therapy (NFAPS therapy) also evaluated their marital satisfaction
signiﬁcantly lower (p = 0.003, dCohen = 1.19) in second assessment
(pretest M = 37.05, SD = 5.64 and posttest M = 30.25,

There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups for the
aﬀectional expression in marriage in assessment of people with
aphasia (Table 10). There were two main eﬀects for aphasias type
[F(1,76) = 10.42; p = 0.002; η2
p = 0.12] and therapy attendance

[F(1,76) = 8.51, p = 0.005, η2 = 0.10]. Post hoc Bonferroni
test analysis indicated, that FAP therapy subjects evaluated
emotional expression in their relationship signiﬁcantly (p = 0.030,
dCohen = 0.780) higher (M = 9.20, SD = 1.91) than FAP controls
(M = 7.40, SD = 2.64) in second assessment. NFAP therapy
subjects gave higher scores (M = 10.77, SD = 0.46) in aﬀectional
expression (p = 0.006, dCohen = 1.10) than NFAP controls
(M = 8.70, SD = 2.60). There was an additional interaction eﬀect
of time and therapy attendance (F = 23.82, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.24).
Post hoc analysis revealed signiﬁcant (p < 0.001, dCohen = 1.42)
decrease in emotional expression evaluations in FAP controls
group in time (from pretest M = 10.15, SD = 0.74, to posttest
M = 7.40, SD = 2.64). Similarly, NFAP control subjects evaluated
aﬀectional expression in their relationship as lower over time
(pretest M = 10.20, SD = 1.32, posttest M = 8.70, SD = 2.60).

Finally, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups
for the aﬀectional expression in marriage in assessment of spouses
of people with aphasia (Table 11). There was only one two
eﬀects showing interaction between time, aphasia’s type and
therapy attendance [F(1,76) = 5.68, p = 0.020, η2
p = 0.02]. Post
hoc analysis revealed signiﬁcant (p < 0.001, dCohen = 0.42)
decrease in emotional expression evaluations in FAP therapy
group in time (from pretest M = 10.05, SD = 0.83, to posttest
M = 7.50, SD = 2.16). Similar diﬀerences were conﬁrmed for
NFAPS therapy subjects. Their initial assessment of emotional
expression in their relationship dropped signiﬁcantly (p = 0.001,
dCohen = 1.09) after 6 months from M = 10.10, SD = 1.29
to M = 7.90, SD = 2.53. Furthermore, ﬁrst assessment of
aﬀectional expression provided by NFAPS control subjects was
signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001, dCohen = 1.50) higher than their second

evaluation (pretest M = 9.80, SD = 1.05 and posttest M = 6.65,
SD = 2.77).

DISCUSSION

Until now, most studies investigating therapy beneﬁts and family
relationship changes associated with experiencing aphasia derive
from data gathered from caregiving spouses or other family
members or do not consider aphasia’s type as a factor (Pound
et al., 1999; Frosberg-Warleby et al., 2001; Martinsen et al., 2012;
Northcott et al., 2016). Therefore we aimed to collate data from
couples experiencing diﬀerent communication problems and
included repeated quality of marriage assessment as retrospective
evaluation can be error-burdened. As we were interested in

Those aspects of a relationship seems to be insusceptible to
consequences of experiencing aphasia amongst older couples.
This correspond with the fact mentioned by Goldstein (Draper
and Blockheurst, 2007) that cohesion of couples in their later
years does not suﬀer as much and is more resilient to crisis. It
is partly due to a fact of fewer responsibilities carried by older
couples. It is in accordance with our previous studies showing
a protective value of previous marriage interaction between
spouses with relationship duration over 14 years. It is more
evident in aphasic patient’s perspective than in a caregiver’s point
of view (Łapkiewicz et al., 2008; Orłowska, 2012).

We would like to emphasize, that when considering the
marital adjustment changes dynamics within investigated groups,
we observed no signiﬁcant changes in perception of marital

relationship amongst patients involved in therapy, irrespective of
aphasia’s type. Their initial estimates do not waver and maintain
rather positive and stable level. However, their spouses report
decline in emotional expression (FAPS) or even general decline
in time in overall marital adjustment, consensus, satisfaction, and
emotional expression evaluations (NFAPS). On the other hand,
marital relationship decline seems to be worse amongst control
subjects, who were not involved in any kind of psychological
support. In spite of
initial non-distressed relationship they
report deterioration of their bond in half a year’s time. All
control subjects report decline in overall quality of marriage and
consensus. These within-group changes have bigger size eﬀects
than in therapy patients groups. Additionally almost all control
subjects report more problems in expressing emotions in their

their relationship suﬀers more (Ellis et al., 2017). Therefore
preventive role of this intervention is weaker.

Results of our study indicate, that applied group therapy
program had a positive eﬀect of preventing decline of quality
of marriage. Though not all aspects of marital relationship
can be maintained on the same level couples not involved
in intervention experience deeper, more negative changes
and are generally more distressed. This eﬀect is strong for
caregiving spouses and not in aphasic patients group. This
corresponds with studies evaluating family support programs,
which showed its beneﬁt for social activities and quality of life
improvement for carriers and no signiﬁcant eﬀect on patients
(Mant et al., 2000).

According to our ﬁndings caregiving spouses perceive their
marriage relationship as more strained if not oﬀered support.
This eﬀect does not seem to be speciﬁc with aphasia’s type but
perhaps can be explained by psychosocial burden, changes in life
roles and other factors widely described in other studies (Visser-
Meily et al., 2006). Furthermore, the general distress of caregivers
of aphasic patients is not related to the aphasia itself but to
personal resources of caregivers (North, 2007). Similarly their
quality of marriage can be inﬂuenced more by understanding
aphasia and receiving support during therapy.

as it provides evidence on preventive role of group therapy,

which in long-term perspective safeguards against
relationship deterioration.

Our previous studies indicate that quality of marriage seems
to suﬀer more in couples struggling with ﬂuent aphasia. The
reported impairment is deeper and observed in more aspects
including emotional expression, marital consensus, coherence,
and satisfaction (Orłowska, 2012). Therefore the fact that spouses
of people with ﬂuent aphasia beneﬁt more from education
oriented therapy can be explained by the fact, that they need
to understand the illness more, as it is not in agreement
with common understanding of speech impairment. This is
in accordance with studies indicating, that problems during
communication situations can be attributed an inappropriate
response by family and friends due to a poor understanding of
the problem and exhaust caregiving spouses (Kagan, 1995).

Perhaps spouses of people with non-ﬂuent aphasia do not

aphasia’s consequences does not help in coping as strongly and

CONCLUSION

Based on our study results counselors are urged to be mindful
of including relationship issues in therapy and rehabilitation

the results are signiﬁcant to warrant additional research.
