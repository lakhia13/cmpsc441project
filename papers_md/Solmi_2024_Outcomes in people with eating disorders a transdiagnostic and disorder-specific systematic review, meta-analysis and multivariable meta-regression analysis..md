Eating disorders (EDs) are known to be associated with high mortality and often chronic and severe course, but a recent comprehensive systematic review 
of their outcomes is currently missing. In the present systematic review and meta- analysis, we examined cohort studies and clinical trials published be -  
tween 1980 and 2021 that reported, for DSM/ICD- defined EDs, overall ED outcomes (i.e., recovery, improvement and relapse, all- cause and ED- related 
hospitalization, and chronicity); the same outcomes related to purging, binge eating and body weight status; as well as mortality. We included 415 studies  
(N=88,372, mean age: 25.7±6.9 years, females: 72.4%, mean follow- up: 38.3±76.5 months), conducted in persons with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia 
nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), other specified feeding and eating disorders (OSFED), and/or mixed EDs, from all continents except Africa. In 
all EDs pooled together, overall recovery occurred in 46% of patients (95% CI: 44- 49, n=283, mean follow- up: 44.9±62.8 months, no significant ED- group 
difference). The recovery rate was 42% at <2 years, 43% at 2 to <4 years, 54% at 4 to <6 years, 59% at 6 to <8 years, 64% at 8 to <10 years, and 67% at 
≥10 years. Overall chronicity occurred in 25% of patients (95% CI: 23- 29, n=170, mean follow- up: 59.3±71.2 months, no significant ED- group difference). 
The chronicity rate was 33% at <2 years, 40% at 2 to <4 years, 23% at 4 to <6 years, 25% at 6 to <8 years, 12% at 8 to <10 years, and 18% at ≥10 years. 
Mortality occurred in 0.4% of patients (95% CI: 0.2- 0.7, n=214, mean follow- up: 72.2±117.7 months, no significant ED- group difference). Considering 
observational  studies,  the  mortality  rate  was  5.2  deaths/1,000  person-years  (95%  CI:  4.4-6.1,  n=167,  mean  follow-up:  88.7±120.5  months;  significant 
difference among EDs: p<0.01, range: from 8.2 for mixed ED to 3.4 for BN). Hospitalization occurred in 26% of patients (95% CI: 18- 36, n=18, mean 
follow- up: 43.2±41.6 months; significant difference among EDs: p<0.001, range: from 32% for AN to 4% for BN). Regarding diagnostic migration, 8% of 
patients with AN migrated to BN and 16% to OSFED; 2% of patients with BN migrated to AN, 5% to BED, and 19% to OSFED; 9% of patients with BED 
migrated to BN and 19% to OSFED; 7% of patients with OSFED migrated to AN and 10% to BN. Children/adolescents had more favorable outcomes 
across and within EDs than adults. Self- injurious behaviors were associated with lower recovery rates in pooled EDs. A higher socio- demographic index 
moderated  lower  recovery  and  higher  chronicity  in  AN  across  countries.  Specific  treatments  associated  with  higher  recovery  rates  were  family- based 
therapy, cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and nutritional interventions for AN; self- help, CBT, dialectical behavioral therapy 
(DBT), psychodynamic therapy, nutritional and pharmacological treatments for BN; CBT, nutritional and pharmacological interventions, and DBT for 
BED; and CBT and psychodynamic therapy for OSFED. In AN, pharmacological treatment was associated with lower recovery, and waiting list with 
higher mortality. These results should inform future research, clinical practice and health service organization for persons with EDs.

Eating disorders (EDs) are severe psychiatric conditions char­
acterized by altered eating behavior, that can lead to severe weight 
loss and underweight, or to weight gain and obesity1. They have 
been recently reclassified as “feeding and eating disorders” in the 
DSM­ 52,3 and ICD­ 114­ 6. According to these classifications, they 
encompass anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge 
eating disorder (BED), and other specified feeding and eating dis­
orders (OSFED) as the most common and studied conditions.

The most important psychopathological feature of AN and BN  

is the overvaluation of body shape and weight7­ 10. Individuals 
with AN are underweight, refuse to gain weight and/or deny the 
severity of underweight status with/without engaging in binge 
eating and compensatory behaviors. Binge episodes are defined 
as introducing an amount of food that is larger than what an aver­
age person would have eaten, in a short period of time, with sen­
sations of loss of control over eating11. Compensatory behaviors 
consist of purging behaviors (self­ induced vomiting, or using lax­
atives or diuretics) or excessive exercise to prevent weight gain or

lose weight. People with BN are not underweight and engage in 
recurring episodes of binge eating and compensatory behaviors 
and/or fasting or compulsive exercise. Individuals with BED en­
gage in recurring episodes of binge eating that are not followed by 
compensatory behaviors. The overvaluation of shape and weight 
is not a characteristic feature of BED, and this condition is often 
associated with, or leads to, obesity12. OSFED is a residual category 
including individuals who do not meet full threshold criteria for 
the main EDs, and encompassing atypical AN, purging disorder, 
subthreshold BN and BED, and night eating syndrome. A propor­
tion of these patients move to a diagnosis of a main ED over time13.
All EDs are marked by frequent psychiatric and physical co­
morbidity14­ 16, and impaired physical, social and work function­
ing17­ 19. People of all ages, ethnicities and socio­ economic condi­
tions20 can be affected by EDs, although adolescents and young  
adults are particularly at risk, and the mean age of onset is decreas­
ing21. AN is more common in women and starts earlier than BN 
and BED22. BN and BED show less gender differences and a higher 
prevalence in ethnic minorities than AN23.

The etiopathogenesis of EDs is thought to be multifactorial, with  
models postulating the presence of predisposing factors (genetic 
vulnerability24,25, temperamental traits, and childhood traumatic 
experiences26), precipitating factors (the environmental context at 
the time of onset1), and maintaining factors (secondary aspects of 
the illness, such as brain adaptation induced by malnutrition, so­
cial isolation, and changes in the environment27). However, a clear 
understanding of this etiopathogenesis is currently lacking, al­
though it would be essential to improve treatment effectiveness28.
Access to treatment for EDs is inadequate, with only 20­ 25% 
of individuals receiving professional consultation for their symp­
toms29. Barriers to treatment access include stigma, lacking insight 
into the illness, shame, scarce availability of evidence­ based in­
terventions, and fragmented or underfunded health services30,31, 
which contribute to low recovery rates and frequent chronicity32. 
The complexity of EDs requires a multidisciplinary treatment ap­
proach to address psychological, environmental, nutritional, be­
havioral and physical problems, as well as mental health comor­
bidities33,34. Psychological and nutritional treatments are recom­
mended by guidelines for all EDs35,36. Evidence­ based psychother­
apies have been developed, but their effectiveness in adults with 
AN does not differ from treatment as usual (TAU)37, and there is 
no superiority of a specific approach38. In contrast, family­ based 
interventions have shown long­ term superiority on other active 
treatments in adolescents and young adults with AN and in ado­
lescents with BN39. Cognitive­ behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most 
validated treatment in people with BN and BED20, with some indi­
cations of long­ term effectiveness39. Pharmacological augmenta­
tion has been effective in the short term, namely antidepressants 
in BN and antidepressants or lisdexamfetamine in BED39.

Studies reporting on outcomes of EDs have been heteroge­
neous with respect to definitions of recovery, relapse, remission 
and hospitalization; sample size, study design, duration of follow­ 
up, and overall quality40­ 45. Thus, a systematic review is needed 
which is comprehensive enough to explore outcome moderators 
and explain heterogeneity of findings. The most extensive reviews 

of outcomes in EDs have been published over one decade ago, 
and reported only on the course of AN and BN46,47. An update and 
extension of their findings, and an evaluation of outcomes also in 
BED and OSFED, are now timely.

Although several therapeutic interventions for EDs have been 
validated by research and are implemented in real­ world clinical 
practice, they have a different impact on patients with the same 
diagnosis48. More tailored and individualized therapies are a re­
search and clinical priority to overcome the “therapeutic stagna­
tion” in EDs49. A variety of predictors and moderators of treatment 
outcomes have been reported in patients with EDs50­ 52, but the 
overall picture remains unclear.

The primary aim of this review and meta­ analysis was to ex­
plore clinically relevant outcomes of specific EDs –  including re­
covery, improvement, relapse after recovery, hospitalization, chro­
nicity and mortality –  over different follow­ up times. Additional 
objectives included exploring the presence of moderators and me­
diators of the main outcomes within and across EDs, evaluating 
the proportion of patients migrating between ED diagnoses, and 
estimating the real­ world effectiveness of different interventions.

METHODS

Search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria

We conducted a PRISMA 202053­ compliant systematic review 
searching Embase, Medline and PsycINFO from 1980 to 2021, 
aiming to include prospective or database cohort studies as well 
as trials reporting on clinical outcomes of EDs. The search key in­
cluded terms related to EDs and outcomes of interest (see supple­
mentary information). Additionally, a manual search was con­
ducted to identify further studies not detected by the systematic 
search, through Medline and Google Scholar.

Inclusion criteria were: a) original peer­ reviewed articles; b) 
published in English; c) based on controlled or non­ controlled 
trials, longitudinal database studies or prospective cohort studies, 
including patients with EDs (i.e., AN, BN, BED, OSFED) defined 
according to any version of the DSM or ICD; and d) reporting 
frequencies of at least one of the following outcomes: recovery, 
improvement, chronicity, all­ cause hospitalization, relapse after 
recovery, and mortality.

Exclusion criteria were: a) meta­ analyses, review articles and 
case reports/case series; b) retrospective studies (except database 
studies) and case­ control studies; c) animal studies; d) studies 
published before 1980; e) studies that did not report any binary 
outcome of interest; f) studies that included patients with ED 
symptoms but no full ED diagnosis; and g) studies with <10 par­
ticipants.

Outcomes and data extraction

The co­ primary outcomes were recovery and chronicity of the 
overall ED symptomatology –  which we defined as “overall” recov­

ery and chronicity –  and mortality. Recovery was defined as ab­
sence of ED symptoms or “good outcome” assessed by a validat­   
ed scale (e.g., the Morgan­ Russell Outcome Assessment Sched­
ule54 for AN, BN and mixed EDs). Chronicity was defined as con­
tinued presence of an ED diagnosis or “poor outcome” assessed 
by a validated scale (see also supplementary information).

the study was conducted. The meta­ regression analysis with sam­
ple size also served to measure publication bias58.

We conducted sensitivity analyses by number of outcome cat­
egories reported in eligible studies, to investigate if higher granu­
larity and specificity of outcome description would affect the fre­
quency of the outcome.

Additional outcomes were recovery and chronicity of specific 
ED symptoms (i.e., binge eating, purging, abnormal weight), and 
all­ cause hospitalization. Moreover, we considered overall as well 
as specific binge eating, purging and weight improvement (i.e., 
symptom improvement or “intermediate outcome”) and relapse 
(i.e., symptom relapse after recovery), as well as ED­ related hospi­
talization (see also supplementary information).

In addition to outcomes, pairs of independent authors extract­
ed the following data from eligible studies: bibliographic identi­
fiers, country, year of data collection, primary component of the 
intervention, mean age of included sample at baseline, study de­
sign, treatment setting, proportion of females, mean body mass 
index (BMI) at baseline, duration of treatment, duration of ill­
ness, total follow­ up duration, proportion of persons with indi­
vidual psychiatric comorbidities (i.e., major depressive disorder, 
anxiety disorders, obsessive­ compulsive disorder, substance use 
disorders, personality disorders, and history of self­ injurious be­
haviors). Moreover, a socio­ demographic index (accounting for 
income per capita, average educational attainment, and fertility 
rates) was assigned to each country55, to explore regional differ­
ences.

The quality of observational studies was assessed with the 
Newcastle­ Ottawa scale56. The risk of bias of trials was evaluated 
using the Cochrane’s risk of bias (RoB) tool57.

Statistical analyses

We conducted random­ effects meta­ analyses of the frequency 
of clinical outcomes. We used the longest time point if more than 
one was available. We reported the pooled percentage of individu­
als with the outcome of interest as well as the average follow­ up 
duration, in months, within each ED and pooling all EDs together. 
We also calculated the frequency of outcomes by follow­ up du­
ration, considering the following time points: <2 months, 2 to <4 
years, 4 to <6 years, 6 to <8 years, 8 to <10 years, and ≥10 years. For 
mortality, we also calculated deaths/1,000 person­years consider­
ing observational studies.

We conducted subgroup analyses testing whether the frequen ­
cy of outcomes differed across EDs. We also conducted subgroup 
analyses by decade of data collection, primary ingredient of treat ­
ment, age group, study design, treatment setting, and continent 
where the study was conducted.

We used multivariable mixed­ effects meta­ regression adjusted 
for mean age, illness duration, and duration of follow­ up, testing 
the following potential moderators or mediators: sample size, 
data collection year, percentage of females, mean BMI, duration of  
treatment, proportion of patients with the individual psychiatric 
comorbidities, and socio­ demographic index of the country where 

From meta­ regression analyses we computed beta, that is the 
change in log of the proportion of individuals with the outcome of 
interest for each unit change in the moderator. R packages used in 
these analyses were metaprop and metareg commands from the 
meta package59, in R 4.1.3.

RESULTS

Database search results and characteristics of included 
studies

From an initial 7,929 hits, we ultimately included 415 studies, 
reporting data on 88,372 persons with EDs. The PRISMA flow chart 
is reported in Figure 1. The lists of included studies and of studies 
excluded after full text assessment, with references and the reason 
for exclusion, are available in the supplementary information.

Overall, 55.4% of the studies had an observational design. Pa­
tients had a weighted mean age of 25.7±6.9 years, and 72.4% were fe­
males. The mean follow­ up duration across all studies was 38.3±76.5 
months. Studies were conducted most frequently in Europe (50.6%), 
followed by North America (38.8%), Oceania (5.5%), Asia (3.1%), 
South America (1.2%), and across multiple continents (0.7%).

Patients  were  most  frequently  diagnosed  with  AN  (41.7%, 
n=173; N=37,160; mean follow­ up: 64.1±102.8 months); and pro­
gressively less frequently with BN (35.4%, n=147; N=23,197; mean 
follow­ up: 30.4±72.9 months); BED (17.1%, n=71; N=5,781; mean 
follow­ up: 8.8±16.0 months); OSFED (5.3%, n=22; N=11,930; mean 
follow­ up:  98.6±205.2  months);  and  mixed  EDs  (14.7%,  n=61; 
N=10,304; mean follow­ up: 31.1±46.9 months).

Only 12% of observational studies had high quality, and 24% of 

randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had low risk of bias.

Frequency of outcomes across and within eating disorders

The frequencies of primary and additional overall outcomes 
across EDs, and their rates at the different follow­ up time points, 
are visualized in Figures 2 and 3.

Pooling all EDs together, overall recovery occurred in 46% of pa­
tients (95% CI: 44­ 49, n=283, mean follow­ up: 44.9±62.8 months), 
without a significant difference among EDs (p=0.17). The recovery 
rate was 42% at <2 years, 43% at 2 to <4 years, 54% at 4 to <6 years, 
59% at 6 to <8 years, 64% at 8 to <10 years, and 67% at ≥10 years. 
There was an increase of the recovery rate over follow­ up in AN, 
BN and OSFED, whereas the rate decreased (from 57% at <2 years 
to 16% at 6 to <8 years) in BED (see supplementary information).

Overall chronicity occurred in 25% of patients (95% CI: 23­ 29, 
n=170, mean follow­ up: 59.3±71.2 months), without a significant

difference among EDs (p=0.23). The chronicity rate was 33% at 
<2 years, 40% at 2 to <4 years, 23% at 4 to <6 years, 25% at 6 to <8 
years, 12% at 8 to <10 years, and 18% at ≥10 years. There was a de­
crease of the chronicity rate over follow­ up in AN, BN and OSFED, 
whereas the rate increased (from 17% at <2 years to 72% at 4 to <6 
years) in BED (see supplementary information).

Mortality during follow­ up occurred in 0.4% of patients (95% 
CI: 0.2­ 0.7, n=214, mean follow­ up: 72.2±117.7 months), without 
a significant difference among EDs (p=0.058), due to large confi­
dence intervals. Mortality increased with longer follow­ up dura­
tion across and within EDs (see Figure 4). When focusing on ob­
servational studies, the mortality rate was 5.2 deaths/1,000 per­
son­years (95% CI: 4.4­6.1, n=167, mean follow­up: 88.7±120.5 
months; significant difference among EDs: p<0.01, range: from 
8.2 for mixed ED to 3.4 for BN) (see also supplementary informa­
tion).

Hospitalization occurred in 26% of patients (95% CI: 18­ 36, 
n=18, mean follow­ up: 43.2±41.6 months), with a significant differ­

ence among EDs (p<0.001). It was highest in AN (32%, 95% CI: 23­ 
43, n=14, mean follow­ up: 47.4±44.7 months) and lowest in BN 
(4%, 95% CI: 1­ 10, n=2, mean follow­ up: 26.9±17.3 months). ED­ 
related hospitalization (reported in 11 studies, of which 10 focus­
ing on AN) occurred in 34% of ED patients (95% CI: 24­ 47, N=896) 
and 35% of AN patients (95% CI: 24­ 49, N=777).

Among additional outcomes, improvement occurred in 28% 
of  patients  (95%  CI:  25­ 32,  n=101,  mean  follow­ up:  54.9±69.8 
months), with a significant difference among EDs (p=0.02). It 
was highest in BN (40%, 95% CI: 31­ 50, n=31, mean follow­ up: 
26.3±33.2 months) and lowest in AN (24%, 95% CI: 20­ 29, n=56, 
mean follow­ up: 82.8±80.5 months).

Relapse after recovery occurred in 26% of patients (95% CI: 21­ 
31, n=45, mean follow­ up: 42.8±45.4 months), with a significant 
difference among specific EDs (p<0.001). It was highest in BN 
(31%, 95% CI: 25­ 39, n=19, mean follow­ up: 37.7±40.4 months) and 
lowest in BED (10%, 95% CI: 6­ 17, n=1, follow­ up: 45.1 months).

Diagnostic migration across eating disorders

Frequencies of diagnostic migration across EDs are reported in 
Table 1. From AN, 8% of patients migrated to BN and 16% to OS­
FED. From BN, 2% migrated to AN, 5% to BED, and 19% to OSFED. 
From BED, 9% migrated to BN and 19% to OSFED. From OSFED, 
7% migrated to AN and 10% to BN.

Moderators and mediators of outcomes across and 
within eating disorders in subgroup analyses

A synopsis of statistically significant moderators and mediators 
of outcomes across and within EDs in subgroup analyses is pro­
vided in Table 2 (see supplementary information for a complete 
report).

Children/adolescents had significantly higher recovery rates 
than adults across and within all EDs; lower chronicity rates across 
all EDs and in AN; and lower mortality rates across EDs and within 
AN and BN.

Pooling all EDs, nutritional intervention was the primary treat­
ment component associated with the largest recovery. CBT was 
the only specific intervention that had recovery rates of 26% or

higher across all EDs. In AN, additional specific treatments that 
were associated with higher rates of recovery in ≥2 studies were 
family­ based therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and multidisci­
plinary specific treatment. In BN, they were self­ help, psycho­
dynamic therapy, pharmacological treatment, multidisciplinary 
specific treatment, and DBT. In BED, they were pharmacological 
treatment, and DBT. In OSFED, they were multidisciplinary specif­
ic treatment and psychodynamic therapy. In AN, the use of phar ­  
macotherapy was associated with low recovery rates. Waiting list 

was associated with the highest mortality rate in both pooled EDs 
and AN.

A significant difference in rates of recovery across continents 
only emerged for BN (highest in Asia, lowest in North America) and 
OSFED (highest in North America, lowest in Europe). Differences 
across continents regarding chronicity only emerged for pooled  
EDs (lowest chronicity in Asia, highest in South America) and AN 
 (low  est chronicity in Asia, highest in Oceania). No differences a­  
mong continents emerged for mortality either across or within EDs.

Moderators of outcomes across and within specific 
eating disorders in meta- regression analyses

Across all EDs, recovery increased with mean baseline BMI, 
and percentage of patients with obsessive­ compulsive disorder, 
and decreased with proportion of patients with self­ injurious be­
haviors. In AN, a higher recovery rate was associated with higher 
percentage of patients with obsessive­ compulsive disorder, less 
recent data collection, and lower country socio­ demographic 
index. In BN, higher recovery rate was associated with longer 
duration of treatment, higher proportion of patients with major 
depressive disorder, and higher number of treatment ingredients. 
Lower chronicity rate in AN was associated with smaller sample 
size and lower country socio­ demographic index (see Table 3).

For mortality, across all EDs pooled together, rates decreased 
with more recent data collection and higher baseline BMI, which 
was confirmed in AN, where also longer treatment duration was 
associated with lower mortality. In BN, a higher proportion of fe­
males was associated with lower mortality rates, while in OSFED 
lower mortality was associated with higher socio­ demographic 
index (see Table 3).

DISCUSSION

This systematic review meta­ analyzed 415 studies from all con ­  
tinents, except Africa, that investigated clinically relevant out­
comes of specific EDs –  including recovery, improvement, relapse

after recovery, hospitalization, chronicity and mortality –  over dif­
ferent follow­ up times. Additional objectives included exploring 
the presence of moderators and mediators of the main outcomes 
within and across EDs, evaluating the proportion of patients mi­
grating between ED diagnoses, and estimating the real­ world ef­
fectiveness of different interventions.

This is the first meta­ analysis that provides a systematic atlas of 
the clinical outcomes of EDs –  including AN, BN, BED and OSFED 
–  over up to more than 10 years of follow­ up. Its findings can in­
form the clinical management of persons with EDs, the relevant 
research agenda, as well as appropriate health services and re­
source allocation aiming to improve outcomes in people with EDs.
Results indicate that recovery rates are similar among different 
EDs when considering overall symptoms and purging, but differ­
ent regarding binge eating (with OSFED having the highest and AN 
the lowest recovery rate) and abnormal weight (with OSFED hav­
ing the highest and BED the lowest recovery rate). BED is frequent­
ly associated with overweight or obesity, which can cause physical 
complications, including arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular and 
respiratory conditions, that limit the ability to exercise, might con­
tribute to further weight gain and are barriers to weight loss60­ 62. 
Moreover, BED is associated with mental comorbidities, including 
depressive and bipolar disorder as well as borderline personality 
disorder60, which are associated with lower physical activity levels, 
as well as poor physical and mental health status, which are each 
barriers to a healthy weight status63­ 67. It is crucial to intervene early 
in BED, to avoid that the network of psychological, behavioral and 
physical symptoms sustaining obesity clusters and aggregates to 
the point of becoming refractory to treatment68­ 71.

AN had the most severe outcomes among EDs, including high­

est relapse and chronicity of weight loss, and highest rates of hos­
pitalization. These outcomes are consistent with the numerous 
physical health complications that are associated with under­
weight and malnourishment72­ 77, and with the importance of early 
weight gain for a positive disease course78,79. BN, instead, had the 
highest rates of overall improvement and relapse, suggesting a 
more episodic course compared to other EDs.

Recovery is not achieved by more than half of patients with EDs. 
Moreover, pooled across EDs, 26% experience relapses after recov­
ery, and 26% require hospitalization during follow­ up. The overall 
mortality risk in EDs is 0.4% (range: 0­ 1.4%), which is a relatively 
high rate for individuals at a mean age of 25.7±6.9 years. More­
over, the mean follow­ up period of 38.3±76.5 months was likely 
too short to capture the full mortality risk, and differential attrition 
rate may have affected the capturing of mortality in sicker patients, 
who may have been less likely to remain in longer­ term follow­ up. 
Also, since studies with longer duration reported higher mortality 
risk, future representative studies following individuals with EDs 
for sufficient periods of time will likely report higher lifetime mor­
tality rates.

Recovery rates increased and chronicity rates decreased over 
follow­ up across all EDs, except for BED. The significant effect of  
time indicates that short­ term RCTs might be prone to type I error, 
with shorter trials overestimating the efficacy of experimental 
interventions versus TAU, which might not hold true at longer 
follow­ up. In BED, an opposite trend of outcomes emerged over 
follow­ up, with recovery decreasing and chronicity increasing over 
time, confirming that early remission is crucial, before ED symp­
toms, overweight or obesity, and physical health implications clu  s ­
ter tightly.

The most common diagnostic migration from AN, BN and BED 
is to OSFED (16% to 19%), with lower rates in the opposite direc­
tion (7% to 10%), or among other EDs (2% to 9%). Diagnostic mi­
gration from AN, BN or BED to OSFED implies that some symp­
toms of a specific ED have improved, while other symptoms have 
persisted, so that not all diagnostic criteria are met. OSFED may 
evolve in three different directions: relapse of AN (7%) or BN (10%), 
a chronic course (34%), or transition to recovery (57%).

As OSFED is a less well­ defined and more heterogeneous diag­
nosis, it may pose a challenge to clinicians when deciding on the 
best course of treatment80. Indeed, it may be implicitly considered 
as a residual category and a less severe disorder4. However, results 
from this meta­ analysis indicate that recovery and chronicity rates 
are not different from those of AN or BN, and that the risk of re­
lapse of OSFED actually increases with follow­ up time, from 8% 
within 2 years to 52% after over 10 years.

Children and adolescents had the highest recovery rate in pool­
ed EDs, and the lowest chronicity rate in AN. These results are in 
line with the staging model of EDs27, which suggests that, while 
illness progresses, neurobiological and psychosocial maintaining  
factors develop and make persons suffering from EDs more resist­
ant to treatment81. These data further indicate the importance of  
pro  viding sufficient resources to enable early diagnosis and treat­      
ment, and of reducing barriers and delays to treatment access in 
young people82,83. For this purpose, services and policy makers

should look at family and general practitioner education31, and the  
strict division still existing in many settings between child and adult  
mental health services should be overcome34,84,85.

Among interventions for EDs included in more than one study, 
treatments with a primary nutritional component were associated 
with the highest rates of overall recovery. Prescription of a healthy 
meal plan, psychoeducation on physiologic nutritional needs, and 
supervised meals in intensive or family­ based settings are crucial 
to normalize the eating pattern, and interrupt some of the behav­
ioral symptoms. Moreover, psychopathological symptoms can in­
directly benefit from the improvement of eating behaviors.

However, a treatment exclusively focused on nutrition would 

not offer the necessary insight on the personalized cycle and net­
work of symptoms of each person’s ED, nor would it train coping 
skills to address environmental (interpersonal) triggers, target 
body checking, address mental comorbidities, and ultimately fa­
cilitate full recovery and prevent relapse.

Our findings support the role of family­ based therapy and CBT  
in AN39. All main guidelines35 indicate the effectiveness of family­ 
based interventions in adolescents with AN. Additionally, ac  cord ­
ing to a recent umbrella review39, also young adults with AN may 
benefit from these interventions. Most guidelines also suggest the 
effectiveness of CBT, and two of them point to CBT as the first­ line 
individual psychotherapy for people with AN35.

Importantly, waiting list was associated with the highest mor­
tality in AN. This finding is of crucial clinical relevance, and should 
encourage ED services offering treatment for AN to avoid passive 
waiting list, and to offer psychoeducational elements and active 
monitoring to those awaiting admission, to capture worsening of 
behavioral and clinical symptoms early.

Our data suggest that self­ help, CBT and DBT are effective in 
BN. Most guidelines outline CBT as the first­ line psychotherapy 
for this condition35, while the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines86 point to guided self­ help as 
first­ line treatment, probably in light of cost­ effectiveness con­
siderations. Compared with guidelines35, our finding concerning 
DBT is novel. DBT is one of the “third wave” psychotherapies, 

which include CBT elements (i.e., skills training, exposure, self­ 
monitoring) but focus more on the context and on interpersonal 
functioning, which are maintaining factors of EDs87,88. DBT can 
also address comorbid borderline personality symptoms, which 
do have an impact on outcomes of EDs, especially in BN and AN 
binge­ purge type.

In individuals with BED, CBT and pharmacotherapy are sup­
ported by the current findings, which is in line with guidelines35 
that suggest the use of CBT, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
anticonvulsants (topiramate) and anti­ obesity (orlistat) drugs. Lis­
dexamfetamine has been approved only in some countries, and 
long­ term effectiveness of medications has not been proven89,90. 
The efficacy of stimulants or topiramate in BED might be partially 

134 

World Psychiatry 23:1 - February 2024

mediated by appetite suppression. Improvement in cognition as 
well as in impulse control and comorbid anxiety and depressive 
symptoms is also likely to mediate the efficacy of pharmacological 
options to treat BED91.

Beyond age group and specific treatment components, other 
factors moderated outcomes of EDs in this meta­ analysis. For ex­
ample, comorbid mental disorders or symptoms were associated 
with better or worse outcomes across EDs, and had the largest 
effect sizes among outcome moderators. This finding reflects the 
central role of non­ ED psychopathology in maintaining the symp­
toms of EDs, and the importance of targeting comorbid mental 
conditions when treating EDs70,92. OCD and major depressive dis­
order moderated higher rates of recovery in AN and BN, respec­
tively, possibly because these conditions are pharmacologically 
addressable. Self­ injurious behaviors were associated with lower 
recovery rates in pooled EDs. They can be considered a proxy of 
borderline personality disorder traits93, which do not respond 
to most pharmacological treatments94, but which do respond to 
DBT95.

In BN, a higher number of treatment components and a longer 
duration of treatment were associated with higher rates of recov­
ery. These results reflect the multidimensional nature of symp­
toms in BN, the frequent presence of comorbid mental disorders 
and symptoms, and the need to provide multidisciplinary care 
that is not too limited in time39,70,96,97.

Pooling all EDs, mortality decreased in more recent studies, al­
though this finding was driven by studies in AN. While education 
and training on AN vary across countries, and are frequently sub­
optimal98,99, our data suggest that physical health of subjects with 
AN has improved over decades, possibly reflecting decreased 
stigma100 and increasing knowledge and attention to physical co­
morbidities101.

However, as reflected by the decrease in recovery rates of AN 
over the last decades, decreasing mortality is not enough. AN 
symptoms can evolve to a state of severe and enduring illness, in 
which patients describe their life as permeated by the disease, that 
assumes an identity role102. On the other hand, residual eating­ 
related cognitions may persist throughout the life of a substantial 
group of patients, without being necessarily incompatible with a  
reasonable degree of psychological well­ being103. The issue of per­
sonal recovery, implying an emphasis on the affected persons’  
perceptions and values, has not been explored sufficiently in peo­
ple with EDs, representing an important potential focus for future 
research.

Higher BMI was associated with decreased mortality in AN, 

supporting the current classification of severity in the DSM­ 5.

A higher proportion of males predicted higher mortality in BN. 
The prevalence of EDs in males is increasing at a faster rate than in 
females104. Although some data point to similarities with females, 
some qualitative differences have been detected, such as a more 
frequent history of overweight and drive for leanness and muscu­
larity, which can promote the use of specific drugs (i.e., anabolic 
steroids)105. The sensitivity of most commonly used tools to quan­
tify ED symptoms may be suboptimal in males106, and EDs may 
be under­ detected in these individuals106­ 108. Our findings call for 

additional research examining sex and gender as moderators of 
different clinical characteristics and outcomes in EDs105,109.

A higher socio­ demographic index moderated lower recovery 
and higher chronicity in AN. Countries with a higher index might 
culturally be more impregnated with thinness pressure, while oth­
er sociocultural systems might be less thinness­  or body image­ 
centred110,111.

This meta­ analysis pools quantitative results from over twice 
as many studies as the previous available reviews44,46,47, which 
were conducted over 20 to almost 15 years ago, and did not meta­ 
analyze the data. Our work confirms prior findings and adds nov­
el results. For instance, in AN, this work confirms the rates of chro­
nicity being above 20%, and at the same time the need to commu­
nicate hope even to persons with severe clinical presentations, as 
rates of recovery increased and rates of chronicity decreased over 
the patients’ follow­ up time. However, the outcome of EDs in gen­
eral has not improved over decades, apart from lower mortality in 
AN.

This meta­ analysis adds evidence from observational and in­
terventional studies about the impact of several interventions on 
clinical outcomes in EDs, accounting for longer follow­ up and 
quantitatively testing moderators and mediators of outcomes in 
subgroup and multivariable analyses, thus informing clinical care 
and organization of services. Results from these additional ap­
proaches indicate, for example, the need to offer nutritional inter­
ventions and avoid unmonitored waiting list status.

This work has several strengths. First, it covers over 40 years of  
observational and interventional studies,  providing a compre­
hensive overview of the current knowledge on EDs. Second, the 
inclusion of a large number of studies allowed the exploration  
and identification of several moderators and mediators, provid­
ing insights that can inform research, clinical practice and policy­ 
making. Third, this work is unique in that it pooled data from  
studies conducted across all continents, except for Africa, providing 
a global perspective on EDs. Fourth, including observational studies 
allowed the measurement of long­ term outcomes, enabling a more 
generalizable assessment of the effectiveness of diff er ent interven­
tions and the frequency of relevant outcomes in peo ple with EDs.

The meta­ analysis also has some limitations. First, not limit­
ing ourselves to RCTs, we could not compare specific treatments 
or rank them. These meta­ analyses already exist37,38, but gener­
ally have a short time frame and cannot capture all of the clinically 
relevant outcomes this work focused on. Moreover, compared to 
RCTs, the inclusion of observational studies allowed us to capture 
and comment on a population that is more representative of real­ 
world patients, which supports the generalizability of the findings. 
Second, including both RCTs and observational studies might have 
increased heterogeneity of the samples to some degree. Third, the 
diagnostic criteria for EDs in DSM and ICD have changed over 
time, and this may have influenced the results of this study.

Fourth, we did not conduct a meta­ analysis of diagnostic mi­
gration from EDs to other mental disorders, because this was be­
yond the scope of this work, and future systematic reviews should 
quantify rates of this migration. Fifth, psychosocial determinants 
of health (i.e., early life trauma or emotion regulation), that have 

World Psychiatry 23:1 - February 2024

more recently emerged as outcome predictors112, were not widely 
available in the meta­ analyzed studies, and could thus not be taken 
into account. Sixth, findings do not include outcomes of EDs in Af­
rica, where research in this field should be promoted. Seventh, we 
did not investigate the impact of ED subtypes –  i.e., restricting ver­
sus binge­ purge AN, or atypical AN –  as data were too limited con­
cerning the outcomes this meta­ analysis focused on. Eighth, the 
definition of outcomes was heterogeneous in the included stu d ­  
ies. In order to account for this heterogeneity of definitions and 
granularity in defining different outcome categories, we have con­
ducted several sensitivity analyses by the number of outcome cat­
egories, whose results were largely consistent with the main find ­  
ings. Finally, despite the large number of eligible studies, some 
outcomes were based on only few studies, and the relative find­
ings should be considered preliminary.

In conclusion, this systematic review and meta­ analysis con­
tributes to the understanding of EDs and provides insights into 
their treatment and real­ world outcomes, both overall and regard­
ing specific EDs. The results highlight the severe course of EDs, al­
though there has been a decrease in mortality rates over time. It is 
imperative that patients with EDs are identified early and moved 
from waitlists to active care as quickly as possible, with a particular 
focus on those with a low BMI and comorbid self­ injurious behav­
iors. Comorbid depression and OCD are treatable and should be 
monitored and addressed.

It is also important to identify and treat EDs in children and 
adolescents as early as possible, to improve outcomes and pre­
vent delays in managing EDs into adulthood. Management plans 
should include a nutritional intervention across all EDs. For AN, 
a multi­ component intervention should include family­ based 
therapy for children/adolescents and young adults, as well as CBT. 
Self­ help, CBT and DBT are effective interventions for BN, while 
CBT and pharmacotherapy are recommended for BED.

There is a need for long­ term observational studies to fully cap­
ture outcomes of individuals with EDs. International consensus 
should be reached in defining recovery, improvement, chronicity 
and relapse in this population. The issue of personal recovery in 
people with EDs should be explicitly addressed by research. Future 
studies should also aim to improve the detection of moderators and 
mediators that can help stratify patient subgroups, in order to allow 
a more personalized treatment approach to persons with EDs.
