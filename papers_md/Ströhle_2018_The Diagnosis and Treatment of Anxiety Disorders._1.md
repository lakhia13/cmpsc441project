Summary

Background: Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental illness in Europe, with a 12-month prevalence of 14% 
among persons aged 14 to 65. Their onset is usually in adolescence or early adulthood. The affected patients often develop 
further mental or somatic illnesses (sequential comorbidity). 

Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. 

Results: The group of anxiety disorders includes generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobic disorders, panic disorders, and two 
disorders that are often restricted to childhood—separation anxiety and selective mutism. A comprehensive differential diag-
nostic evaluation is essential, because anxiety can be a principal manifestation of other types of mental or somatic illness as 
well. Psychotherapy and treatment with psychoactive drugs are the therapeutic strategies of first choice. Of all types of psycho-
therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy has the best documented efficacy. Modern antidepressants are the drugs of first choice for 
the treatment of panic disorders, agoraphobia, social phobia, and GAS; pregabalin is a further drug of first choice for GAS. 

Conclusion: In general, anxiety disorders can now be effectively treated. Patients should be informed of the therapeutic options 
and should be involved in treatment planning. Current research efforts are centered on individualized and therefore, it is hoped, 
even more effective treatment approaches than are available at present.

A nxiety  is  a  a  normal  and  necessary  basic  emotion 

without  which  individual  survival  would  be  im-
possible. Pathologically increased anxiety can arise 
not only in anxiety disorders per se, but also in most other 
types of mental illness. Anxiety can also be a warning sig-
nal of potential harm in somatic illnesses, such as myo-
cardial infarction or hypoglycemia in a diabetic patient; it 
naturally  requires  an  entirely  different  therapeutic  ap-
proach in such situations. For any patient presenting with 
pathologically  increased  anxiety,  a  thorough  psychiatric 
and  somatic  evaluation  is  needed  so  that  an  underlying 
pulmonary (e1), cardiovascular (e2), neurological (e3), or 
endocrine disease (e.g., of the thyroid gland) (e4) can be 
ruled  out. Anxiety  reactions  as  such  are  important  indi-
cators of a possible threat to homeostasis; anxiety is con-
sidered a disease requiring treatment when it arises in the 

absence of any threat, or in disproportionate relation to a 
threat,  and  keeps  the  affected  individual  from  leading  a 
normal life.

After reading this article, the reader should

● know  that  anxiety  disorders  are  common  mental 
illnesses  of  early  onset  that  elevate  the  risk  of 
 developing further mental illnesses;

● understand  the  clinical  manifestations  of  anxiety 

disorders;

● be aware of the current treatments of first choice.

Anxiety disorders
Anxiety is considered a disease requiring treatment when it 
arises in the absence of any threat, or in disproportionate 
 relation to a threat, and keeps the affected individual from 
leading a normal life.

Sex ratio
Women are affected two to three times as commonly as men.

Epidemiology
Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental 
illness  in  the  European  Union,  Switzerland,  Iceland, 
and  Norway  (figures  for  the  year  2010).  With  a 
12-month  prevalence  of  14%  and  approximately  61.5 
million  affected  persons,  they  are  more  common  than 
any other mental illness among persons in Europe aged 
14  to  65.  Women  are  affected  two  to  three  times  as 
commonly as men (1).

Anxiety disorders often begin in childhood or ado-
lescence  (e5).  This  is  particularly  true  for  specific 
phobias and social phobia. Selective mutism can arise 
as  early  as  a  child’s  third  year.  Most  children  go 
through  a  transient  phase  of  non-pathological  aver-
sion to strangers, often beginning at the age of eight 
or  nine  months.  In  2–3%  of  children,  marked  sepa -
ration  anxiety  persists  into  the  preschool  or  school-
age years. Treatment is indicated if separation anxiety 
impairs the normal development of the child, e.g., by 
making it impossible for the child to have important 
social experiences. 

 The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  reported 
that, in 2015, anxiety disorders ranked in sixth place 
among all mental and somatic illnesses worldwide as 
a cause of so-called years lived with disability (YLD), 
and  in  fourth  place  in  highly  developed  countries; 
they  are  thus  among  the  chronic  illnesses  with  the 
greatest impact on patients’ lives (2). Specific phobias 
are the most common type of anxiety disorder.

Taxonomy and manifestations
The anxiety disorders, as classified in the International 
Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD-10)  (3),  comprise  the 
phobic disorders, including agoraphobia with (F40.00) 
or  without  panic  disorder  (F40.01),  social  phobia 
(F40.1),  and  the  specific  phobias  (F40.2),  as  well  as 
other  anxiety  disorders,  including  panic  disorder 
(F41.0),  generalized  anxiety  disorder  (F41.1),  and 
mixed anxiety and depression (F41.2) (Table 1). In the 
current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (e6), which is the main 
reference text for the taxonomy of mental illnesses in 
the  USA,  separation  anxiety  disorder  and  selective 
mutism are newly classified as anxiety disorders. These 
were previously considered illnesses restricted to child-
hood and adolescence, but are now held to be relevant 
in adulthood as well. The upcoming ICD-11 can be pre-
viewed in a beta version that is available online. In this 
classification,  too,  separation  anxiety  disorder  and  se-
lective mutism will appear for the first time among the 
(adult) anxiety disorders (4). 

Separation  anxiety  disorder  is  characterized  by 
 persistent and excessive anxiety associated with sep-
aration from the patient’s most significant other(s), to 
an inappropriate extent from the developmental psy-
chological  point  of  view.  Its  lifetime  prevalence  is 
4.8%.  It  is  usually  initially  diagnosed  in  childhood, 
but  recent  studies  have  shown  that  it  is  increasingly 
common in adulthood as well. For instance, an evalu-
ation  of  the World  Mental  Health  Survey  conducted 
by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  revealed 
that,  among  38 993  adults  in  18  different  countries, 
the  age  of  onset  of  separation  anxiety  disorder  was 
over 18 years in 43.1% of cases (5, 6).

Selective  mutism  is  a  rare  anxiety  disorder  that 
usually  presents  in  childhood  or  adolescence.  The 
diagnostic  evaluation  for  this  disorder  often  takes 
place only after the child has started school. Persons 
suffering  from  selective  mutism  are  persistently  un-
able to  speak  in certain situations,  even though  they 
can do so in other situations, usually when with their 
families. If the patient emits no phonetic expressions 
of  any  kind  (e.g.,  coughing,  crying,  laughing,  or 
speaking) in any situation whatsoever, the term “total 
mutism”  is  used. According  to  the  DSM-5  (e6),  the 
point  prevalence  of  selective  mutism  lies  between 
0.03% and 1%. No data are yet available from repre-
sentative  epidemiological  studies  of  entire  popu-
lations; the wide disparity of prevalence estimates is 
presumably due to the diversity of settings in which 
the data were acquired (hospitals, schools, the popu-
lation at large) (e6). Approximately one-third of suf-
ferers  have  persistent  symptoms  into  adulthood  (7). 
Unfortunately, no valid data are available on the fre-
quency of this disorder as a function of age.

Sequential comorbidity
Anxiety disorders are associated with high parallel comor-
bidity  with  other  anxiety  disorders.  In  addition,  individ-
uals with an anxiety disorder are at elevated risk of devel-
oping further anxiety disorders over time. A meta-analysis 
of  20  studies  revealed  that,  among  children  with  sepa -
ration anxiety, the risk of developing a panic disorder later 
on is more than three times higher than in children without 
separation anxiety (8). The epidemiological term for such 
longitudinal  associations  is  “sequential  comorbidity” 
(Figure). This exists not only within the anxiety disorders 
among themselves, but beyond them as well: anxiety dis-
orders elevate the risk of developing other mental illness-
es such as depression or substance-related disorders (9). 
For  example,  a  Danish  study  on  a  cohort  of  3 380 059 
persons  showed  that  patients  with  anxiety  disorders,  in

comparison  to  the  general  population,  have  an  adjusted 
incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.0 for a depressive episode 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: [2.8; 3.1]) and an IRR of 5.0 
for  a   recurrent  depressive  disorder  (95%  CI:  [4.8;  5.2]) 
(10). 

Anxiety disorders also play a major role in the de-
velopment  and  prognosis  of  somatic  diseases.  In  a 
longitudinal  study  of  293  persons  (median  age:  55 
years)  who  were  in  good  cardiovascular  and  auto -
immune  health,  amygdalar  activation  on  18F-fluoro -
dexoyglucose  positron  emission  tomography/com-
puted tomography (18F-PET-CT)—a key radiological 
finding  that  is  typical  of  anxiety  disorders—was 
found to be associated with an elevated risk of devel-
oping cardiovascular disease in a subsequent observa-
tion period of 3.7 years (median duration). There were 
a total of 22 new cases of cardiovascular disease and a 
calculated  hazard  ratio  (HR)  of  1.6  (95%  CI:  [1.27; 
1.98]), i.e., a 60% elevation of the risk of developing 
a  cardiovascular  disease  for  each  increase  of  the 
amygdalar  signal  by  one  standard  deviation.  This 
 association  seems  to  be  mediated  by  elevated  bone-
marrow activity and arterial inflammation. When in-
terpreting  these  results,  one  must  bear  in  mind  that 
amygdalar  activation  is  a  general  measure  of  emo-
tional processes and is not specific for anxiety or for 
anxiety disorders (11). 

In a meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies  (Health Sur-
vey  for  England  [HSE],  Scottish  Health  Survey 
[SHS]) involving a total of 163 363 men and women 
who stated that they did not have cancer at the time of 
inclusion in the study, it was found, after correction for 
age, sex, level of education, smoking status, and alco-
hol consumption, that persons with a high anxiety/de-
pression  score  at  the  time  of  inclusion  were  signifi-
cantly more likely to die of cancer in an ensuing obser-
vation period of 9.5 years (mean duration; 4353 deaths 
overall; multivariable adjusted hazard ratio 1.32, 95% 
CI:  [1.18;  1.48]),  compared  to  persons  with  a  low 
anxiety/depression  score  (GHQ-12:  0–6).  This  was 
particularly  the  case  for  colorectal,  prostatic,  pancre-
atic,  and  esophageal  cancer  and  for  leukemia. Aside 
from  other,  possibly  overlooked  confounding  vari-
ables, it cannot be ruled out that persons with a high 
anxiety/depression  score  at  the  time  of  inclusion  al-
ready had an as yet undetected subclinical malignancy, 
leading  to  increased  mental  stress  in the  sense  of what 
epidemiologists call “reverse causality.” To limit the in-
fluence of initially occult malignancies on the study find-
ings, patients who died in the first five years of the obser-
vation period were excluded from the analysis (12).

(F41.0)

Panic disorder with 
agoraphobia (F40.01)

Agoraphobia 
(F40.0)

Social phobia 
 (F40.1)

Repeated and unexpected panic attacks (anxiety attacks)

diaphoresis, paresthesiae, nausea) and mental ones (fear 
ranging to mortal fear, fear of losing control, feeling of alien-
ation)

Repeated and unexpected panic attacks plus agoraphobia

Phobias involving fears of leaving home, entering shops, 
crowds and public places, or traveling alone in trains, buses 
or planes

Fear of scrutiny by other people leading to avoidance of 
 social situations. More pervasive social phobias are usually 
associated with low self-esteem and fear of criticism. They 
may present as a complaint of blushing, hand tremor, 
nausea, or urgency of micturition

Specific phobia 
 (F40.2)

Fear and/or avoidance of certain objects or situations. 
Types: animals, natural events (thunder, etc.), blood, 
 injections, injury, or other triggering situations or objects

Selective mutism 
 (F94.0)

Language competence in some situations, but failure to 
speak in other (definable) situations

Separation anxiety 
 (F93.0)

Unrealistic and persistent worry about adverse events that 
might befall the patient‘s most significant others, or about 
the potential loss of same 

The  early  detection  and  treatment  of  anxiety  dis-
orders  may  thus  have  a  secondary  preventive  effect 
against further mental and somatic diseases as well as 
a  beneficial  influence  on  the  course  of  somatic  dis-
ease.  The  association  between  early  detection  and 
prevention  remains  to  be  examined  in  randomized 
controlled trials. 

Etiology
Anxiety  disorders  are  among  the  so-called  complex 
genetic  diseases  characterized  by  a  complex  pathoge -
netic interaction of environmental factors with multiple 
genetic variants at different chromosomal loci. Family 
studies  have  shown  that  first-degree  relatives  of 
 patients with panic disorders have a three- to fivefold 
elevation  of  the  risk  of  developing  such  a  disorder 
themselves,  compared  to  the  general  population. 
 Familial clustering is also seen in generalized anxiety 
disorder and in the specific phobias. The heritability of 

Generalized anxiety disorder

Panic disorders are characterized by:
Repeated and unexpected panic attacks (anxiety attacks) with 
both physical manifestations (palpitations, dyspnea, diaphore-
sis, paresthesiae, nausea) and mental ones (fear ranging to 
mortal fear, fear of losing control, feeling of alienation).

anxiety  disorders,  i.e.,  the  degree  of  participation  of 
genetic factors in their development, lies in the range of 
30–67%, with the remainder of the variation accounted 
for by individual negative environmental factors, such 
as life events (13). These include, for example (14):
● Abuse and neglect (emotional and/or physical) 
● Sexual violence
● Chronic illness
●  Traumatic injuries
● Deaths of significant others
● Separation and divorce
● Financial difficulties. 
On the other hand, positive environmental factors, 
effective  coping  strategies,  secure  bonding  styles, 
supportive  learning  experiences,  and  a  good  social 
support  network  can  increase  resilience,  even  in  the 
presence of a genetic risk-factor constellation. Mean-
while, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the cau-
sation  of  anxiety  disorders  is  gaining  increased 
 attention.  Epigenetic  mechanisms  are  biochemical 
processes, such as, for example, DNA methylation or 
histone  acetylation,  that  act  on  DNA  or  its  spatial 
structure without changing the DNA sequence per se. 
They play an important role in the regulation of gene 
activity and display marked temporal plasticity, being 
alterable  by  life  events  or  even  by  psychotherapeutic 
intervention. Epigenetic processes may, therefore, play 
a key role in tipping the balance between risk factors 
and  resilience,  leading  to  an  adaptive  or  maladaptive 
outcome: it is perhaps the integration of the genetic risk 
together  with  the  environmentally  determined risk by 
way of epigenetic processes that ultimately determines 
whether an anxiety disorder will arise. Individual epi-
genetic  effects,  like  individual  genetic  effects,  are 
small  (15).  Initial  epigenetic  pilot  studies  on  small 
groups  of  patients  with  anxiety  disorders  have  re -
vealed  altered  patterns  of  DNA  methylation  in  risk 
genes for these disorders, and it seems that successful 
psychotherapy  or  pharmacotherapy  leads  to  the 
normali zation  of  these  altered  epigenetic  patterns 
(16). 

The  neuronal  structures  that  participate  in  the 
anxiety network include the amygdala, whose efferent 
fibers to the hypothalamus, the locus ceruleus, and the 
periaqueductal gray play a role in the regulation of the 
central  and  peripheral  manifestations  of  the  anxiety 
response, and areas of prefrontal cortex and the ante -
rior cingulate gyrus that exert an inhibitory effect on 
the amygdala (17, 18). Further brain areas belonging 
to the anxiety network are the insula, which integrates 
interoceptive signals, and the bed nucleus of the stria 

terminalis, which has recently been ascribed a central 
role in what is called “sustained anxiety”—a typical 
feature  of  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  panic  dis-
order, and social anxiety disorder (19).

Learning plays a major role in the development and 
maintenance of anxiety disorders, as well as in their 
treatment.  Classical  and  operant  conditioning  exert 
their effects, and avoidant behavior contributes to the 
maintenance  of  the  disorder. There  also  seems  to  be 
an evolutionarily determined capacity to mount an ex-
cessive anxiety reaction to the objects of the specific 
phobias, encouraging the development of these pho-
bias;  Seligman  introduced  the  term  “preparedness” 
for  this  capacity  (e8).  Personality  traits,  too,  es-
pecially  neuroticism,  are  related  to  the  development 
of  anxiety  disorders  (e9).  Extinction  learning  via 
 in-vivo  exposure  is  now  considered  to  be  a  form  of 
 relearning,  rather  than  the  erasure  (unlearning)  of 
 previously acquired content. 

Treatment
As recommended in the S3 guideline on the treatment 
of anxiety disorders issued in May 2014 (20), psycho-
therapy and pharmacotherapy should both be offered, 
and  the  two  are  considered  comparably  effective. 
Decisions about treatment should be made in the light 
of the severity of the disorder, the preference of the in-
formed patient, the expected latency and durability of 
the treatment effect, the expected side effects, and the 
availability  of  the  treatment  in  question.  If  one  form 
of  treatment  proves  to  be  ineffective,  the  other  (or  a 
combination of both) should be tried. Only for the spe-
cific  phobias  is  there  very  good  evidence,  and  there-
fore a very strong  recommendation, for psychotherapy 
alone; drugs are not indicated in the treatment of the spe-
cific phobias. 

For  all  types  of  anxiety  disorder,  cognitive  beha-
vioral therapy is the type of psychotherapy for which 
there is the strongest evidence and which receives the 
highest-level  recommendation  (Ia;  A).  Initial  ran -
domized controlled trials have confirmed the clinical 
efficacy  of  psychodynamic  therapies,  e.g.,  in  social 
phobia  (21).  Nonetheless,  psychodynamic  therapy 
 receives  evidence  level  IIa  in  the  current  German 
guidelines because of the incomplete state of the data 
from  clinical  trials,  along  with  the  recommendation 
that  this  type  of  psychotherapy  should  be   offered  if 
cognitive behavioral therapy has been ineffective or is 
unavailable,  or  if  an  informed  patient   expresses  a 
preference  for  it  (20).  The  specifics  of  cognitive 
 behavioral  therapy  vary  depending  on  the  particular 

Genetic factors
The heritability of anxiety disorders, i.e., the degree of partici-
pation of genetic factors in their development, lies in the range 
of 30–67%, with the remainder of the variation accounted for 
by individual negative environmental factors, such as life 
events.

Treatment
Anxiety disorders can be treated with psychotherapy, drugs, or 
both.

anxiety  disorder  being  treated,  with  the  common  el-
ement that the patient must make the experience that 
his or her situationally induced anxiety is unfounded 
and  the  situation  actually  harmless.  This  is  best 
achieved through exposure under the supervision of a 
therapist (22), in the course of which the patient must 
experience habituation of the anxiety response, so that 
the central fear underlying it is refuted. Exposure in 
virtual reality is now increasingly a part of cognitive-
behavioral therapeutic interventions (23). 

Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  has  been  found  to 
have a moderately strong beneficial effect against all 
types of anxiety disorder compared to a placebo drug 
(Cohen’s d = 0.57); the same is true of pharmacother-
apy  (e.g.,  sertraline,  d = 0.54;  venlafaxine,  d = 0.50)
(24). If only the before vs after changes are studied,
remarkably  strong  effects  are  found  for  pharmaco-
therapy  (selective  serotonin  and  norepinephrine
re uptake  inhibitors  [SNRI],  d = 2.25)  compared  to 
cognitive behavioral therapy (d = 1.30) (24). Combin-

ing  pharmacotherapy  with  psychotherapy  is  usually 
not  superior  to  monotherapy  with  either  one  of  the 
two options alone (20). In a meta-analysis of the few 
available  studies  with  long  follow-up  periods,  Ban -
delow et al. (25) concluded that further symptomatic 
improvement took place 26–104 weeks after the end 
of cognitive behavioral therapy. After pharmacother-
apy, there was no worsening in the follow-up period, 
but this difference compared to cognitive behavioral 
therapy did not reach statistical significance.

The drugs with the highest level of supporting evi-
dence  are  the  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SSRI)  and  SNRI,  as  well  as  the  calcium-channel 
modulator pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder 
(Table 2).

In  the  informed-consent  discussion,  the  patient 
should  not  only  be  informed  of  the  specific  side  ef-
fects of the drug class(es) to be prescribed, but should 
also  be  told  that  the  effect  of  antidepressant  drugs 
may  be  delayed  by  a  latency  of  approximately  two 

Psychotherapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy is the tpe of psychotherapy of 
first choice in the treatment of the anxiety disorders.

Treatment with psychoactive drugs
The drugs most commonly used are the selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and the selective noradrenaline 
ruptake inhibitors (SNRI).

weeks (range: 1–6 weeks), and that these drugs may, 
in  fact,  initially  worsen  nervousness,  agitation,  and 
anxiety. They should therefore be given at a low dose 
at first, with gradual upward titration (Box).

A  common  question  in  clinical  practice  is  how 
long  drug  therapy  should  be  continued  in  order  to 
prevent  a  relapse.  The  response  rates  are  generally 
high  (ca.  80%),  but  too  early  discontinuation  of 
medication is associated with non-negligible relapse 
rates.  Among  patients  with  panic  disorder,  for 
example,  a  relapse  is  seen  in  15–50%  within  6–12 
months of the discontinuation of tricyclic antidepres-
sants,  SSRI,  or  venlafaxine.  It  is  therefore  recom-
mended that maintenance therapy with SSRI or SNRI 
be continued for at least 6–12 months after the end of 
the  acute  phase,  at  the  effective  final  dose  that  was 
attained.  Any  attempt  to  discontinue  medication 
should be gradual, e.g., over the course of 12 weeks 
if  the  duration  of  treatment  until  now  has  been  40 
weeks (27).

Benzodiazepines are approved in Germany for the 
acute  treatment  of  “states  of  tension,  excitation,  and 
anxiety.” Nonetheless, the German guidelines on the 
treatment of anxiety disorders discuss the use of ben-
zodiazepines  for  this  purpose  in  decidedly  critical 
terms:  “Benzodiazepines  are  effective  against  panic 
disorder/agoraphobia/generalized  anxiety  disorder/
social phobia (Ia; guideline adaptation). They should 
nonetheless  not  be  offered  to  patients  with  panic 
 disorder/agoraphobia/generalized  anxiety  disorder/
social phobia because of their serious side effects (de-
velopment of dependence, etc.). They can be used for 
a limited time after careful evaluation of the risks and 
benefits  in  exceptional  cases,  e.g.,  patients  with  se-
vere  cardiac  disease,  contraindications  for  standard 
drugs, suicidality, and other conditions.“ The discon-
tinuation  of  benzodiazepines  after  they  have  been 
taken  for  months  or  years,  as  is  often  the  case,  is  a 
special  challenge  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
anxiety  disorders  (28).  Drug  discontinuation  must 
often take place in an inpatient setting, and only a few 
of  the  pertinent  treatment  recommendations  are  sup-
ported by adequate evidence. 

While  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  and  psycho-
pharmacotherapy are considered first-line treatments 
for  anxiety  disorders,  further  treatment  strategies 
have been studied and applied in routine clinical prac-
tice in recent years, such as the following:

●  Metacognitive therapy (29)
●  Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (30)
● Mindfulness-based techniques (31)

●  Noninvasive stimulation techniques, such as re-
petitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
or  transcranial  direct-current  stimulation  (tDCS) 
(32)

●  Physical activity and exercise (33). 
A systematic review of the literature is needed so 
that the relevance of new studies for the guideline rec-
ommendations can be appropriately assessed. 

We find the use of physical activity and exercise as 
a  treatment  of  anxiety  disorders  to  be  particularly 
 interesting. This mode of treatment is inexpensive and 
has  few  undesired  effects;  it  should  be  applied  in 
combination  with  the  first-line  therapies  (not  as  the 
sole intervention) and is used much too rarely in rou-
tine clinical practice (33). Very strong pre/post effect 
strengths of g = −1.23 (24) seem impressive but have 
not  been  reproduced  in  studies  with  active  control 
groups (34). Even single units of endurance training 
can have an anxiolytic effect (e13–e15) or perhaps re-
inforce the effect of exposure therapy (35). 

Aside  from  drug  therapy  of  the  types  discussed, 
clinical  practice  guidelines  also  contain  recommen-
dations  for  psychological  treatments  of  anxiety  dis-
orders in the primary medical care setting. The essen-
tial building-blocks of treatment are (20): 

● counseling,
● psycho-education  about  anxiety  and  anxiety  dis-

orders,

● instructions for anxiety-confronting exercises in 

real-life situations, and

● the use of self-help manuals (20). 
The  primary  care  physician  and  the  patient  work 
jointly  to  develop  a  gradually  intensifying  treatment 
plan  (participative  decision-making).  With  the  pri-
mary care physician’s attentive personal support and 
counseling,  the  patient  carries  out  specific  anxiety-
 reducing  exercises  (36).  Anxiety-confronting  exer-
cises are performed in controlled fashion according to 
the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 
Patients  with  panic  disorder,  in  particular,  are  con-
fronted  with  so-called  interoceptive  stimuli  (as  an 
 exercise, including, for instance, 60 seconds of hyper-
ventilation  under  supervision);  patients  with  agora-
phobia  are  confronted  with  so-called  situational 
 stimuli (e.g., taking a train ride by oneself). It is im-
portant  for  the  patient  to  discuss  the  exercise  after-
ward with the physician in order to reinforce the new 
experience  and  solidify  the  associated  learning 
achievement. The stimuli that were originally felt to 
be anxiety-producing are now judged more appropri-
ately. Trained medical practice assistants can serve as 

Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are approved in Germany for the acute 
 treatment of “states of tension, excitation, and anxiety.” None -
theless, the German guidelines on the treatment of anxiety dis-
orders discuss the use of benzodiazepines for this purpose in 
 decidedly critical terms because of their marked side effects.

The essential components of the treatment of panic 
 disorder with agoraphobia are: 
• Counseling
(cid:129) Psycho-education about anxiety and anxiety disorders 
(cid:129) Anxiety-confronting exercises in real-life situations 
(cid:129) Self-help manuals

*1 according to the German guidelines
 *2 Case studies indicate that pregabalin has a potential for abuse, mainly in patients with substance-related disorders and above all in opiate-dependent patients 

(26). It is accordingly recommended in the German guidelines that patients with substance-related disorders, and particularly those who are addicted to multiple 
drugs, should not be treated with pregabalin. If a patient does not respond to a drug or cannot tolerate it, the next step may be a switch from one standard drug to 
another (e.g., from an SSRI to an SSNRI; in generalized anxiety disorder, from an SSRI to pregabalin) or a switch to a nonstandard drug, such as one with a lower 
evidence level or recommendation grade (e.g., moclobemide in social phobia), or to one that is not approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders, but has 
 nonetheless been reported to be clinically effective (e.g., quetiapine, agomelatine, lavender oil, and, in some cases, mirtazapine).

case managers to help the  patient carry out these exer-
cises:  they  telephone  the  patient  regularly  to  record 
the  patient’s  current  disease  manifestations  with  the 
aid  of  a  brief  symptom  checklist.  This  list  is  at  the 
center  of  communication  between  the  physician,  the 
patient, and the practice assistant (37); it permits rapid 
assessment  of  the  patient’s  situation  and  reliable 
transmission of this information to the physician, who 
can then respond in timely fashion. If the symptoms 

fail to improve rapidly under the care of the primary 
care  physician,  a  psychiatrist  or  psychotherapist 
should be consulted without delay. It has been shown 
that  the  ambulatory  treatment  of  patients  with  panic 
disorder and agoraphobia with exposure therapy is 
more effective when carried out under direct super -
vision  than  when  carried  out  by  the  patient  alone 
according to directions (22). Supervision of the ex-
posure places a heavy psychological demand on the 

Exercise therapy
Exercise has an anxiolytic effect and is therapeutically useful 
in both the short term and the long term. 

Panic disorders
Patients with panic disorder, in particular, are confronted with 
so-called interoceptive stimuli (as an exercise, including, for 
 instance, 60 seconds of hyperventilation under supervision); 
patients with agoraphobia are confronted with so-called 
 situational stimuli (e.g., taking a train ride by oneself).

BOX

The off-label use of drugs that have not been approved for 
the treatment of anxiety disorders

The atypical antipsychotic drug quetiapine has not been approved for the treat-
ment of anxiety disorders. Still, a meta-analysis of three randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trials of this drug for the treatment of generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD), given for a period of 10 weeks in each trial, showed 
that it is significantly more effective than placebo in the 50 to 300 mg/day dose 
range, albeit with an unfavorable profile of metabolic side effects (e10).

Agomelatine acts as an agonist at melatonin MT1- and MT2-receptors and 
as an antagonist at the serotonin 2C receptor. Multiple studies published from 
2008 onward have shown it to be well tolerated and highly effective against 
GAD in the 25–50 mg/day dose range (e11), yet this drug has not been 
 approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders either.

Silexan, a patented active substance derived from lavender oil, has been 
approved since 2009 in Germany for the treatment of subsyndromal anxiety 
and tension states at a daily dose of 80 mg, but not for the treatment of anxiety 
disorders. Nonetheless, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown its 
 effectiveness against GAS and so-called mixed anxiety and depression (e12).

therapist  as  well  (38);  this  can  be  observed  in  the 
activation of the stress hormone system, particularly 
with massive exposure (flooding) (39). 

Prevention
The  development  and  assessment  of  preventive 
measures against anxiety disorders should have a high 
priority in view of these disorders’ high prevalence and 
chronicity, the severity of the suffering that they cause, 
their high socioeconomic costs, and their role as precur-
sors of depression and substance-abuse disorders and as 
complicating factors in somatic disease (40). Universal 
preventive  measures,  applied  regardless  of  the  risk 
status  of  the  individual,  might  prevent  many  cases  of 
clinically manifest anxiety disorders, even if their indi-
vidual  effects  were  not  very  strong;  yet  their  appli-
cation to large, unselected target groups would be both 
very  expensive  and  very  labor-intensive.  The  alter-
native  lies  in  targeted  programs,  or,  in  other  words, 
 selective  primary  preventive  measures,  such  as  the 
Cool  Little  Kids  program  or  the  Friends  program. 
These measures are particularly effective in preventing 
the  development of clinically overt anxiety disorders in 
high-risk  groups  in  the  critical  temporal  window  of 
childhood  and  adolescence.  For  example,  a  longitudi-
nal  randomized  controlled  trial  showed  that  the  Cool 

Little Kids program was significantly superior to con-
trol  (no  treatment)  in  a  population  of  3-  to  5-year-old 
preschool children: the preventive intervention signifi-
cantly lowered the incidence of anxiety disorders at 12 
(p = 0.03), 24 (p = 0.03), and 36 (p = 0.01) months, and 
even after a further follow-up period of 11 years—but 
then only among the girls, who were about 15 years old 
by  that  time  (Cohen’s  d = 0.55,  p = 0.04)  (e16,  e17). 
Targeted  prevention  in  persons  who  already  display 
subclinical symptoms has been shown to significantly 
lessen  the  rate  of  development  of  clinically  relevant 
anxiety  disorders  and  is  thus  probably  the  most  cost-
 effective  primary  measure.  Meta-analyses  have  re -
vealed  low  effect  strengths  for  the  prevention  of 
anxiety; targeted measures were found to be somewhat 
more effective than universal ones right after the inter-
vention (Cohen’s d = 0.26 versus  0.17 [e18, e19]). The 
prevention  manuals  now  available  in  the  German-
speaking countries include, for example, the Friends 
program; 
the  Separation  Anxiety  Program  for 
Families  (Trennungsangstprogramm  für  Familien, 
TAFF);  the  Being  Brave  with  Til  Tiger  program 
(Mutig werden mit Til Tiger); and the Health and Op-
timism Program (Gesundheits- und Optimismus-Pro-
gramm). The encouraging initial data imply that pre-
ventive  measures  against  mental  illnesses,  and  in 
particular  against  anxiety  disorders,  which  are  very 
common  and  socioeconomically  relevant,  urgently 
need to be studied further, systematically, and in de-
tail. If their effects can be confirmed, these measures 
should  be  implemented  in  timely  fashion  in  the 
healthcare system.

Exposure under the supervision of a therapist
It has been shown that the outpatient treatment of patients 
with panic disorder and agoraphobia with exposure therapy is 
more effective when carried out under direct supervision than 
when carried out by the patient alone.
