Abstract 
Background  According to the cognitive behavioral model of social anxiety, attentional bias to negative emotional 
information causes and maintains anxiety. The goal of attentional bias modification (ABM) is to reduce anxiety 
by reducing attention bias to negative emotional information.

Method  We used questionnaires and experiments to explore the improvement effect of ABM training on social anxi-
ety in college students. In Study 1, we used dot-probe tasks to investigate the attentional bias to negative emotional 
information and the relationship with social anxiety severity in college students. In Study 2, college students with high 
social anxiety were divided into two groups: attentional bias modification training task group (ABM) and atten-
tion control condition task group (ACC). The ABM group received a continuous intervention for 10 days to observe 
changes in social anxiety levels and attentional bias scores in the pretest and posttest stages.

Results  The results showed that the correlation of attentional bias to negative emotional information and social 
anxiety severity was significant. Meanwhile, the high social anxiety participants responded more quickly to negative 
emotional information. After the intervention, social anxiety levels and attentional bias scores of the training group 
were significantly reduced.

Conclusions  The results showed that attentional bias modification training can reduce attentional bias to negative 
emotional information in college students with social anxiety and effectively improve their social anxiety.

Introduction
Social  anxiety  disorder,  also  known  as  social  phobia, 
refers  to  anxiety  and  fear  caused  by  the  possibility  of 
being  evaluated  and  scrutinized  when  individuals  are  in 
contact with others [1, 2]. Studies have found that social 
anxiety  often  appears  in  college  students  [1,  3].  Long-
term  social  anxiety  can  greatly  affect  learning,  life  and 
other  functional  aspects,  which  is  harmful  to  physical 
and mental health. However, compared with other men-
tal disorders, social anxiety disorder is not easy to detect 
and  ignore.  Eventually,  extreme  anxiety  and  depression 
can easily occur due to a lack of early intervention [4, 5].

The cognitive behavioral model of social anxiety points 
out that individuals with social anxiety are more sensitive

to  negative  emotional  information  and  may  have  atten-
tional bias [6–9], and the maintenance of an anxiety state 
may be caused by attentional bias to negative emotional 
information  [10].  Individuals  with  social  anxiety  have  a 
certain degree of attentional bias to negative information, 
which is an important process of anxiety generation [11]. 
That can be understood as the allocation of attention to 
negative stimuli being different from that to neutral stim-
uli [11]. Therefore, the attentional bias to negative emo-
tional  information  may  be  significantly  correlated  with 
social anxiety severity. If the attention bias of individuals 
with social anxiety is improved, their social anxiety level 
may be alleviate. However, some studies have not found 
the  attentional  bias  to  negative  emotional  information 
[12, 13]. The relationship between social anxiety and the 
attentional  bias  to  negative  emotional  information  still 
needs further investigation.

The  attentional  vigilance-avoidance  hypothesis  indi-
cates  that  individuals  with  anxiety  involve  entering  the 
stage  of  automatic  capture  of  negative  information,  fol-
lowed  by  an  increase  in  anxiety,  and  immediately  enter-
ing the avoidance stage to reduce the anxiety experience 
[14].  Therefore,  attentional  bias  to  negative  information 
may be intervened to achieve the goal of alleviating social 
anxiety.

As  we  all  know,  there  are  many  intervention  methods 
for social anxiety from the cognitive-behavioral perspec-
tive, and attentional bias modification training (ABM) is 
one of the common methods. This method is a comput-
erized  self-help  attentional  bias  treatment  that  aims  to 
reduce anxiety levels by manipulating individuals’ atten-
tional bias to negative stimuli [15].

There have been many intervention studies on ABM for 
anxiety  and  for  other  targets,  but  the  results  are  mixed. 
The  changes  in  the  range  of  attentional  bias  scores  of 
training  group  participants  was  larger  than  that  in  the 
control  group  after  10  consecutive  days  of  ABM  [16].  A 
recent  meta-analysis  showed  that  training  can  signifi-
cantly  reduce  anxiety  symptoms  and  attentional  bias  to 
threat  stimuli  and  indicated  that  the  greater  the  total 
number of trials, the greater the efficacy [17].

Although  ABM  can  achieve  intervention  effects, 
some  studies  have  not  found  significant  differences 
when compared to control groups [18–21]. Some stud-
ies  used  ABM  twice  a  week  for  3  weeks  and  found  no 
significant  difference  in  the  pretest  and  posttest  stages 
in  the  training  group  [22].  The  reasons  for  these  dif-
ferent  results  are  manifold.  First,  different  studies 
used  different  experimental  materials.  For  example, 
the  negative  materials  only  involved  aversive  stimuli, 
and  further  research  is  needed  to  determine  whether 
the  treatment  effect  is  specific  to  aversive  stimuli  or 

can  be  generalized  to  other  types  [21]. The  study  used 
foreign  emotional  faces,  and  cultural  differences  may 
affect  individual  recognition  of  facial  emotions  [19]. 
Second,  there  were  differences  in  training  procedures 
and  environments  among  the  studies.  For  example,  a 
study  adopted  internet-based  attention  training  in  the 
home  environment,  which  may  affect  the  conscien-
tiousness  of  individuals  in  training  [20].  Finally,  there 
were  differences  in  training  time  intervals  and  fre-
quency. For example, a study assessed participants only 
twice  a  week,  and  thus  the  time  interval  was  too  long 
[22]. As a result, no significant difference was found in 
anxiety  levels  of  the  training  group  in  the  pretest  and 
posttest  stages.  A  study  did  not  find  significant  inter-
group differences in social anxiety symptoms after five 
consecutive days of intervention [19]. There have been 
differences in training settings in the past, the training 
times  of  many  studies  were  too  short  [19,  20],  and  the 
training intervals were too long [22,  23], which may be 
the  reason  for  previous  mixed  results.  Therefore,  it  is 
necessary  to  further  optimize  experimental  materi-
als,  training  procedures  and  training  settings  in  future 
studies.

Based  on  that  information,  this  study  used  the 
Standardized  Chinese  Facial  Emotion  Picture  System 
(CFAPS) [24] to conduct attentional bias training for 10 
consecutive  days,  and  it  was  assumed  that  attentional 
bias training would have a better effect on social anxi-
ety under intensive training conditions [16].

Considering the above theories and previous research 
results,  we  proposed 
following  hypotheses. 
the 
Hypothesis  H1:  The  attentional  bias  to  negative  emo-
tional  information  is  significantly  correlated  with  the 
Social  Interaction  Anxiety  Scale  (SIAS)  and  the  Social 
Phobia  Scale  (SPS)  scores.  Hypothesis  H2:  Individuals 
with high social anxiety show attentional bias to nega-
tive  emotional  information.  Hypothesis  H3:  In  the 
posttest stage, social anxiety levels and attentional bias 
scores of the ABM (Attentional bias modification train-
ing  task)  group  is  significantly  lower  than  those  of  the 
ACC (Attention control condition task) group. Hypoth-
esis  H4:  In  the  posttest  stage,  social  anxiety  levels  and 
attentional  bias  scores  of  the  ABM  group  decrease 
significantly.

Experiment 1
We explored the correlation of attentional bias for nega-
tive emotional information and social anxiety severity in 
individuals.  The  study  hypothesized  that  the  attentional 
bias  to  negative  emotional  information  is  significantly 
correlated with SIAS and SPS scores.

Materials and methods
Participants
We  recruited  67  participants  (female = 26;  male = 41) 
from colleges and universities, in the form of issuing sec-
ond-class activities which is a social practice outside the 
classroom  compared  with  classroom  teaching.  College 
students have certain credit requirements for the second-
class activities when they graduate. The age range of the 
participants  was  17–22  years  old.  All  the  participants 
were  right-handed  and  had  no  mental  illness.  Informed 
consent was signed before the experiment, and compen-
sation was given after the experiment.

Measures

The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) has 19 items 
and  uses  5-point  scoring  to  measure  anxiety  and  fear 
in  the  context  of  communication  with  people  [25].  The 
higher the score, the higher the degree of social anxiety. 
The SIAS scale has been widely used in the study of social 
anxiety  among  college  students  and  has  been  proven  to 
have  good  representativeness  [26]. The  average  of  norm 
data  for  Chinese  college  students  is  49.10.  The  revised 
Chinese  version  had  a  Cronbach’s  α  coefficient  of  0.874 
[25]. In this study, Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.90.

The  Social  Phobia  Scale  (SPS)  has  a  total  of  20  items 
[25] and uses 5-point scoring to measure anxiety and fear 
in  performance/observed  situations.  The  SPS  scale  has 
good validity in social anxiety studies [27, 28]. The revised 
Chinese  version  had  a  Cronbach’s  α  coefficient  of  0.904 
[25]. In this study, Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.92.

Materials and procedure

At present, most studies on attentional bias use stimulus 
materials such as words or pictures. However, the words 
mainly  depend  on  their  symbolic  meaning  and  need  to 
be  processed  by  human  speech  system,  with  relatively 
low  stimulation  and  ecological  validity  [29,  30].  There-
fore, this study uses emotional pictures (CFAPS) that are 
more  intuitive  and  can  measure  the  initial  reactions.  In 
addition,  to  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  the  experimen-
tal  materials,  30  participants  (15  males  and  15  females, 
with  an  average  age  of  18.47 ± 0.68  years)  who  did  not 
participate  in  the  formal  experiment  were  selected  to 
give a 9-point score on the potency, arousal and familiar-
ity of each picture [31]. Finally, 40 emotional faces were 
selected,  including  20  negative  and  neutral  emotional 
faces,  half  for  men  and  half  for  women.  The  results  of 
paired  sample  t-test  analyses  showed  no  significant  dif-
ferences  in  familiarity  or  arousal  between  the  two  types 
of  materials,  but  a  significant  difference  in  potency 
(t = 8.03,  P < 0.001,  d = 1.47)  (Table  1).  The  picture  size

was 260 × 300. The program ran E-Prime, version 2 (Psy-
chology Software Tools, Pittsburgh).

The  study  adopted  a  2  (Emotional  type:  negative  and 
neutral) × 2 (Location of probe: consistent and inconsist-
ent) within-subjects experimental design. The emotional 
type  and  location  of  the  probe  were  the  within-subjects 
variables,  and  the  dependent  variables  were  attentional 
bias  scores  of  negative  emotional  face.  Among  the 
probes, “consistent” meant that the probe was behind the 
negative  emotional  face,  and  “inconsistent”  meant  that 
the probe was behind the neutral emotional face.

The  study  was  conducted  on  a  14-inch  desktop  com-
puter monitor. Before the experiment, participants were 
informed of the experimental content and operation pro-
cess.  The  experimental  procedures  for  each  participant 
were as follows: practice experiment (8 trials) and formal 
experiment  (72  trials).  The  emotional  faces  in  the  prac-
tice experiment do not appear in the formal experiment. 
After that, participants completed the SIAS, SPS.

Figure  1 illustrates the experimental flow. First, partici-
pants focused on the cross-fixation point “ + ” in the center 
of the screen. After 500 ms, a pair of negative and neutral 
emotional faces appeared on the left and right sides of the 
screen for 500 ms with a 50% probability each, and then a 
blank screen appeared for 50 ms. A probe (black “●”) ran-
domly appeared in the center of any previous face with a 
50% probability. The probe pressed the “F” key and the “J” 
key at the left and right positions, respectively. The partici-
pants needed to respond to the key quickly and accurately 
within 2000 ms, with an interval of 1000 ms. The partici-
pants completed the practice experiment first and entered 
the formal experiment after all reactions were correct.

Data analysis

The reaction times less than 200 ms are too fast to be con-
sidered  a  cognitive  process  and  reaction  times  more  than 
1200  ms  are  too  slow  and  can  be  difficult  to  conclude 
whether it was due to lack of attention, fatigue or other rea-
soning  other  than  the  cognitive  processes  [32].  Therefore, 
data with reaction times of less than 200 ms and more than 
1200 ms were deleted, meanwhile, invalid trials with incor-
rect  key  reactions  were  deleted.  The  specific  demographic 
information is shown in Table 2.

In  the  negative-neutral  emotional  face  pairs,  the  dif-
ference  between  the  reaction  time  under  inconsistent 
conditions  and  that  under  consistent  conditions  was  the 
attentional bias score. If attentional bias scores were posi-
tive,  it  indicated  that  the  participant  reacted  faster  to 
negative  emotional  faces.  If  attentional  bias  scores  were 
negative, it indicated that the participant reacted faster to 
neutral emotional faces. Therefore, the higher the score, the 
faster  the  participant  reacted  to  negative  emotional  faces. 
In this study, the correct response rate of the effective par-
ticipants was 100%, which was not meaningful for compari-
son. The experimental data were analyzed by SPSS 19.0.

Results

As  shown  in  Table  2,  the  Pearson  correlations  results 
showed  that  attentional  bias 
is  significantly  corre-
lated  with  SIAS  (r = 0.353,  p = 0.003)  and  SPS  (r = 0.305, 
p = 0.012), while the correlation between SIAS and SPS is 
significant (r = 0.823, p < 0.001).

Discussion

In  Experiment  1,  behavioral  experiments  and  question-
naires were used to study the correlations between social 

anxiety and attentional bias to negative emotional infor-
mation. The results showed that.

attentional  bias  to  negative  emotional  information 
is  significantly  correlated  with  SIAS  and  SPS  scores. 
According to the Orientation Theory of Attentional bias, 
socially anxious individuals have attentional bias to nega-
tive emotional faces [16, 33]. Therefore, hypothesis 1 was 
verified.

Previous  study  showed  that  the  higher  the  level  of 
social  anxiety,  the  more  attentional  bias  college  stu-
dents  showed  to  negative  emotional  information  [34]. 
The  meta-analysis  on  attentional  bias  and  anxiety  dis-
orders  and  found  that  participants  in  the  anxiety  group 
had  greater  attentional  bias  [15].  The  attentional  bias  of 
socially  anxious  individuals  to  negative  stimuli  was  the 
key  reason  for  their  anxiety  state  to  be  maintained  [6]. 
Other studies found that individuals with social difficul-
ties  were  more  sensitive  to  negative  emotional  stimuli 
and  might  have  had  attentional  bias  [9]. Thus,  we  asked 
if we could reduce levels of social anxiety through atten-
tional bias training to achieve the purpose of improving 
social anxiety. Therefore, study 2 was carried out.

Experiment 2
Based on study 1, we explored the intervention effect of 
ABM on social anxiety of college students.

Methods
Participants and measures

We recruited 527 participants from a university in Tian-
jin through a convenient sampling method. Participants 
were  invited  to  fill  an  online  questionnaire.  Finally,  we 
obtained a total of 404 effective questionnaires excluding 
those with a response time of less than 600 s and more 
than  2100s  considering  the  authenticity  of  the  reaction 

Liu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:508

and  those  who  had  not  completed  the  questionnaire. 
SIAS  scores  were  ranked  from  high  to  low,  and  the  lat-
ter  25%  of  participants  were  placed  in  the  low  social 
anxiety group [35]. The purpose was to verify attentional 
bias  characteristics  of  individuals  with  social  anxiety  to 
negative  emotional  information,  and  31  participants  in 
the  low  social  anxiety  group  participated  in  the  experi-
ment. The top 25% of participants were in the high social 
anxiety  group  [35].  The  lowest  SIAS  score  for  the  high 
social  anxiety  group  is  47,  which  is  close  to  the  aver-
age  of  the  norm  data  for  Chinese  university  students, 
therefore  the  grouping  of  the  high  social  anxiety  group 
was  effective.  Finally,  62  participants  in  the  high  social 
anxiety group participated in the whole experiment. The 
post-hoc  power  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  power 
(1-β) was 0.97, which meant the number of subjects was 
sufficient.  The  participants  were  randomly  divided  into 
two  groups.  Neither  the  researchers  nor  participants 
knew about the group assignments. All participants were 
right-handed  and  had  no  mental  illness.  The  informed 
consent form was signed before the experiment, and the 
second-class  activity  credits  and  learning  supplies  were 
given  in  return  after  the  experiment.  All  the  measures 
are same to study 1. The specific demographic informa-
tion of the two groups is shown in Table 5.

Materials and Procedure

According  to  the  method  of  study  1,  76  negative  and 
neutral  emotional  faces  (half  male  and  half  female)  were 
finally selected, as shown in Table 3. Twenty-five pairs of 
negative-neutral face pairs were formed, of which 9 pairs

were used in the attentional bias measurement task, and 
8 pairs of materials were used in the ABM and ACC tasks; 
13 pairs of neutral–neutral face pairs were formed, and 5 
pairs were used in the attentional bias measurement task, 
attentional  bias  training  task  and  attention  control  task. 
Paired  samples  t-tests  were  used  to  analyze  the  potency, 
arousal and familiarity of the pictures. The results showed 
no significant differences in familiarity or arousal between 
the  two  kinds  of  materials,  but  a  difference  in  potency 
(t = 10.64, P < 0.001, d = 1.94) was significant.

According  to  the  intervention  parameters  used  in 
previous studies [13, 16], to further reduce any material 
effects that led to training effects, a research paradigm 
different from Study 1 was used in the experiment. The 
study  is  divided  into  the  attentional  bias  measurement 
task, ABM and ACC task. See Fig. 2 for the flowchart of 
the attentional bias measurement task:

Design and Task

The  study  adopted  a  2  (Group:  ABM  group  and  ACC 
group) × 2  (Measurement  time:  pretest  and  posttest) 
mixed experimental design. The between-groups varia-
ble was the group, and the within-subjects variable was 
measurement  time.  The  dependent  variables  included 
attentional  bias  scores  and  scores  of  each  symptom 
assessment  questionnaire.  On  the  first  day  of  the  for-
mal  experiment,  all  participants  needed  to  complete 
the  attentional  bias  measurement  task  (pretest)  first 
and then received different treatments according to dif-
ferent groups. The participants were trained once a day 
for  a  total  of  10  days.  On  the  last  day  of  training,  par-
ticipants completed their training tasks first, then com-
pleted the attentional bias measurement task (posttest), 
and completed the SIAS, SPS questionnaires.

(1) Attentional  bias  measurement  task  (pretest  and 

posttest)

In  the  attentional  bias  measurement  task,  a  cross-fix-
ation  point  “ + ”  appeared  in  the  center  of  the  screen  for 

Fig. 2  Flowchart of the attentional bias measurement task

500 ms, and participants were required to look directly at 
the fixation point. After the fixation point disappeared, an 
emotional face picture was presented on the left and right 
sides.  The  emotional  pictures  in  Study  2  were  from  the 
same  source  as  those  in  Study  1,  but  they  were  different 
pictures. A total of 28 (9 negative emotional faces and 19 
neutral emotional faces) faces were selected and presented 
for  500  ms.  Then,  the  screen  would  display  the  reaction 
target,  i.e.,  “E”  or  “F”  (the  probability  of  occurrence  of 
the  two  letters  was  the  same)  at  any  position  where  two 
pictures  had  appeared.  When  the  letter  “E”  appeared, 
participants  were  instructed  to  press  the  “E”  key  on  the 
keyboard, and when the letter “F” appeared, press the “F” 
key  on  the  keyboard.  The  participants  were  required  to 
respond quickly and accurately within 2000 ms, and there 
were 1000 ms empty screens between different trial times. 
The task included 16 trials of the practice experiment and 
160  trials  of  the  formal  experiment,  of  which  128  trials 
were negative-neutral face pairs, and the remaining 32 tri-
als were filled trials, presenting neutral–neutral face pairs 
[36].  When  the  accuracy  rate  of  the  practice  experiment 
reached 100%, it automatically entered the formal experi-
ment, which took approximately 8 min.

(2) Attentional bias modification training (ABM) task

The ABM task was similar to the attentional bias meas-
urement  task.  Another  48  pictures  were  selected  and 
randomly divided into 2 groups. Each group included 16 
neutral  and  8  negative  pictures,  of  which  8  neutral  pic-
tures  were  used  as  filling  materials. The  ABM  task  used 
one  of  these  pictures.  When  the  negative-neutral  face 
pairs were presented (80%), the letter “E” or “F” consist-
ently  appeared  after  the  neutral  face  (80%).  Each  task 
consisted  of  four  blocks,  with  160  trials  in  each  block, 
for a total of 640 trials. There was a short break between 
each set of two blocks, which took approximately 20 min.

(3) Attention control condition (ACC) task

The  ACC  task  was  the  same  as  the  attentional  bias 
measurement task, and another 24 pictures were selected. 
When  the  negative-neutral  face  pairs  were  presented 
(80%), the probe randomly appeared after the negative or 
neutral face with the same probability (40%). Each training 
session included four blocks, with 160 trials in each block, 
for a total of 640 trials. There was a short break between 
each set of two blocks, which took approximately 20 min.

ACC  group) × 2  (Measurement  time:  pretest  and  post-
test) repeated-measures ANOVA was used. Independent 
samples t-tests were used to analyze the pretest and post-
test of the two groups. A paired samples t-test was used 
to analyze the pretest and posttest results in each group. 
P < 0.05 
indicated  statistically  significant  differences 
between comparison groups.

Results
Reaction time

As  shown  in  Table  4,  reaction  time  was  first  used  as 
the  dependent  variable  to  perform  repeated-measures 
ANOVA of a 2 (Group: low social anxiety group and high 
social  anxiety  group) × 2  (Location  of  probe:  consistent 
and  inconsistent)  design.  The  main  effect  of  group  was 
significant: F (1, 91) = 7.95, P = 0.006, η2 = 0.08; the inter-
action  was  also  significant:  F  (1,  91) = 4.01,  P = 0.048, 
η2 = 0.04.  The  simple  effect  test  showed  that  under  con-
sistent conditions, reaction time of the high social anxiety 
group was significantly lower than that of the low social 
anxiety  group  (P = 0.004).  The  high  social  anxiety  group 
responded to negative emotional information faster than 
the low social anxiety group.

Questionnaires and attentional bias scores

The attentional bias, SIAS and SPS scores of each group 
are shown in Table 5.

Using  an  independent  samples  t-test,  the  results 
showed that attentional bias scores of the high social anx-
iety group were significantly higher than those of the low 
social  anxiety  group  (t = -2.00,  P = 0.048,  d = 0.46).  Indi-
viduals  with  high  social  anxiety  showed  attentional  bias 
to negative emotional information, and hypothesis 2 was 
verified.

With SIAS as the dependent variable, 2 (Group: ABM 
group  and  ACC  group) × 2  (Measurement  time:  pretest 
and  posttest)  repeated-measures  ANOVA  showed  that 
the  group  main  effect  was  significant:  F  (1,  60) = 5.55, 
P = 0.022,  η2 = 0.09;  the  main  effect  of  time  was  signifi-
cant:  F  (1,  60) = 45.87,  P < 0.001,  η2 = 0.43.  With  SPS  as 
the dependent variable, 2 (Group: ABM group and ACC 
group) × 2  (Measurement  time:  pretest  and  posttest) 
repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the interaction 
was  significant:  F  (1,  60) = 5.15,  P = 0.027,  η2 = 0.08.  The 
simple effect test showed that the SPS scores in the ABM 
group  were  significantly  lower  than  those  in  the  ACC 
group  at  the  posttest  stage  (P = 0.024),  and  hypothesis  3 
was partially verified. The SPS scores of the ABM group 
in the pretest and posttest stages were significantly differ-
ent (P < 0.001), and the posttest scores were significantly 
lower than the pretest scores. The SPS scores of the ACC 
group in the pretest and posttest stages were significantly 
different (P = 0.018). It can be seen from the difference in 
effect sizes that SPS scores of the ABM group in the pre-
test and posttest stages were greater.

With  attentional  bias  scores  of  the  ABM  group  and 
ACC  group  as  the  dependent  variable,  the  independent 
samples t-test showed that before training, there was no 
significant  difference  between  the  ABM  group  and  the 
ACC group (t = 0.21, p = 0.831). In the posttest stage, the 
ABM  group’s  attentional  bias  scores  were  significantly 
lower  than  those  of  the  ACC  group  (t = -2.22,  p = 0.030, 
d = -0.56). Therefore, hypothesis 3 was fully verified.

As  shown  in  Table  6,  the  t-test  results  of  paired  sam-
ples  showed  that  there  was  a  significant  difference  in 
SIAS (t = 7.07, P < 0.001, d = 1.27), SPS (t = 6.07, P < 0.001, 
d = 1.09),  and  attentional  bias  scores  (t = 2.24,  P = 0.033, 
d = 0.40)  of  the  ABM  group  in  the  pretest  and  posttest 
stages,  and  the  scores  in  the  posttest  stage  were  sig-
nificantly  lower  than  those  before  training.  The  SIAS 
(t = 3.22,  P = 0.003,  d = 0.58)  and  SPS  (t = 2.29,  P = 0.029, 
d = 0.41) scores of the ACC group in the pretest and post-
test  stages  were  significantly  different,  and  scores  in  the 
posttest stage were significantly lower than those before 
training. The effect size was moderate, and the difference 
in  attentional  bias  scores  was  not  significant.  Moreover, 
the difference in SIAS and SPS scores in the ABM group 
during  the  pretest  and  posttest  stages  was  greater  than 
that in the ACC group. Finally, hypothesis 4 was verified.

Discussion

In this study, behavioral experiments and questionnaires 
were used to explore the intervention effect of ABM on 
social  anxiety.  First,  it  was  consistent  with  the  result  of 
study  1,  that  is,  college  students  with  high  social  anxi-
ety showed attentional bias to negative stimuli. Second, 
study  2  found  that  ABM  could  reduce  the  attentional 
bias of socially anxious college students to negative emo-
tional  faces  in  dot-probe  tasks,  which  was  consistent 
with  previous  research  results  [37].  Through  analysis, 
ABM could significantly reduce the level of social anxi-
ety  and  showed  a  better  intervention  effect  than  ACC, 
which was consistent with the results obtained in previ-
ous studies [16, 23, 38, 39].

General discussion
Through  questionnaires  and  experiments,  Study  1 
showed  that  the  attentional  bias  to  negative  emotional 
information  is  significantly  correlated  with  SIAS  and 
SPS  scores.  This  was  consistent  with  previous  find-
ings that, for individuals with social anxiety, alertness to 
negative  emotional  information  was  closely  related  to 
the automated processing of their susceptibility [38, 40]. 
The correlation of attentional bias to negative emotional 
information  and  social  anxiety  severity  would  provide 
theoretical support for subsequent intervention training.

Study  2  showed  that  the  high  social  anxiety  group 
responded to negative emotional information faster than 

 Liu et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:508

the  low  social  anxiety  group  and  the  attentional  bias 
scores of the high social anxiety group were significantly 
higher than those of the low social anxiety group. Study 2 
demonstrated that the individuals with high social anxi-
ety  showed  attentional  bias  to  negative  emotional  infor-
mation. During the attentional processing stage, negative 
and neutral stimuli often compete for the order in which 
they  are  processed.  Among  them,  negative  stimuli  are 
prioritized for processing by individuals with social anxi-
ety [38]. The formed negative attentional bias eventually 
produces anxiety [41].

The  individuals  with  social  anxiety  had  attentional 
hypervigilance  to  negative  information  with  a  presenta-
tion  time  less  than  500  ms,  while  they  tended  to  avoid 
negative  information  with  the  presentation  time  more 
than 500 ms [42]. It indicated that individuals with social 
anxiety tend to maintain strict vigilance against the nega-
tive information in the early stages of the cognitive pro-
cessing and avoid negative information in the later stages 
[42].  That  probably  attentional  hypervigilance  occurs  in 
early  stages  of  attention  process.  The  ABM  intervenes 
the  attentional  bias  to  negative  information  in  the  early 
stages of attentional processing [19]. Finally, based on the 
conclusions of Study 1, Study 2 investigated the interven-
tion effect of ABM on social anxiety. The results showed 
that  attentional  bias  scores  of  the  ABM  group  were  sig-
nificantly lower than those of the ACC group after inter-
vention.  In  the  ABM  group,  the  attentional  bias  scores 
of the posttest were significantly lower than those of the 
pretest,  indicating  that  ABM  can  reduce  the  attentional 
bias  of  individuals  with  social  anxiety  to  negative  emo-
tional  information.  ABM  training  effectively  reduced 
the level of social anxiety, and the ABM group showed a 
better  intervention  effect  than  the  ACC  group  [16,  39]. 
Cognitive-behavioral theory suggests that attention pro-
cessing plays a key role in the pathogenesis and mainte-
nance  of  anxiety  disorders  [43,  44].  Timely  intervention 
of  such  attentional  bias  could  reduce  individual  social 
avoidance behavior and prevent the maintenance of anxi-
ety [45].

Regarding  the  differing  results  of  previous  studies,  as 
mentioned  above,  the  settings  of  experimental  materi-
als,  training  environment  and  training  time  may  affect 
the  results.  First,  considering  the  individual’s  recog-
nition  ability  of  emotional  faces  in  the  same  cultural 
background  during  the  training  process  and  diversity  of 
negative  emotional  faces  in  the  real  interpersonal  com-
munication  environment,  to  improve  the  ecological 
validity  of  the  experimental  materials,  emotional  face 
pictures  from  CFAPS  were  used  in  the  study.  Second, 
participants might take the training task less seriously at 
home than in the laboratory setting. Other important dif-
ferences between the laboratory and home environments 

were  stress  and  arousal  levels.  The  home  environment 
might not evoke enough arousal to promote ABM train-
ing [46]. Therefore, considering the influence of the train-
ing environment, ABM in the laboratory setting was used 
in  this  study.  Finally,  considering  that  the  inconsistent 
settings of training time interval and training times might 
also have a greater impact on the intervention effect, the 
study  combined  the  problem  of  replicability  and  stand-
ardization  of  settings  and  extended  intervention  times 
while referring to the previous intervention experimental 
parameters. The number of training sessions significantly 
regulated  posttest  stress  response  [17].  The  more  train-
ing times there are, the greater the stress response. There 
might  be  a  “dose‒response”  relationship  in  the  study  of 
ABM; that is, the more intervention doses were activated 
pertinently,  the  stronger  the  observation  results  became 
(gradient criterion) [47]. More training was related to the 
improvement of anxiety symptoms.

This  study  first  verified  the  correlation  of  attentional 
bias  and  social  anxiety  severity  and  then  carried  out 
training  for  attentional  bias  on  this  basis,  which  had  a 
good  theoretical  basis.  Previous  studies  failed  to  carry 
out  research  on  the  characteristics  of  attentional  bias. 
According to the relevant viewpoints of information pro-
cessing theory [38], through ABM, individuals with social 
anxiety can always track neutral stimuli, thereby reducing 
their  attention  to  negative  stimuli.  In  the  posttest  stage, 
social anxiety levels and attentional bias scores of individ-
uals with social anxiety decreased. The reduction in neg-
ative attention might be the reason for reduction in social 
anxiety levels. In addition, ABM might reduce emotional 
vulnerability  of  participants  in  real-life  social  encoun-
ters  [48],  which  would  help  alleviate  anxiety  symptoms 
of individuals with social anxiety. The research is carried 
out in the current social environment, which is different 
from the past. ABM still has a positive effect on improv-
ing  the  level  of  social  anxiety,  enriching  the  empirical 
research  in  the  field  of  social  anxiety  intervention,  and 
supports the promotion and application of ABM.

This  study  has  limitations.  First,  the  intervention  time 
in this study was 10 days, and the immediate effect after 
intervention  was  significant.  It  is  necessary  to  increase 
the follow-up time to evaluate the maintenance duration 
of the intervention effect. Second, the training paradigm 
of ABM can consider introducing virtual reality technol-
ogy to explore ways to increase its interest and effective-
ness so that individuals can have a better experience and 
participation  in  the  process  of  intervention  treatment 
[39, 49]. Nevertheless, this study established an effective 
intervention  model  for  social  anxiety  that  can  be  popu-
larized  and  used  in  college  mental  health  work.  ABM 
training  has  the  characteristics  of  being  short  term  and 
timely, having no side effects, and being easy to operate.

It improves the foresight and accuracy of college mental 
health work to solve practical work difficulties.

In  sum,  under  conditions  of  this  study,  we  found  that 
ABM can reduce attentional bias of college students with 
social  anxiety  to  negative  emotional  information  and 
effectively improve their social anxiety levels.
