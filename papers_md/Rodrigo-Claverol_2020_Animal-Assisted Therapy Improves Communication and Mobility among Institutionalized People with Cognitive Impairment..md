Abstract: Disorders of communication, social relationships, and psychomotricity are often
characterized by cognitive impairment, which hinders daily activities and increases the risk of
falls. This study aimed to evaluate the eﬃcacy of an animal-assisted therapy (AAT) program in an
institutionalized geriatric population with cognitive impairment. The variables evaluated included
level of communication and changes in gait and/or balance. We performed a two-arm, parallel
controlled, open-label, nonrandomized cluster clinical trial in two nursing home centers from an urban
area. Patients in the two centers received 12 weekly sessions of physiotherapy, but the experimental
group included AAT with a therapy dog. The study included a total of 46 patients (23 Control
Group [CG], 23 Experimental Group [EG]) with a median age of 85.0 years. Of these, 32.6% had
mild–moderate cognitive decline (Global Deterioration Scale of Reisberg [GDS] 2–4) and 67.4%
severe cognitive decline (GDS 5–6). After the intervention, patients in the CG and EG showed a
statistically signiﬁcant improvement in all the response variables. When comparing both groups,
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in any of the Tinetti scale results (measuring gait
and balance). However, the communication of patients in the EG, measured on the Holden scale,
showed a statistically signiﬁcant greater improvement postintervention than that of patients in the CG.
AAT can be useful as a complementary, eﬀective treatment for patients with diﬀerent degrees of
cognitive decline.

1. Introduction

Aging is a complex, progressive, and irreversible physiological process that involves biological,
psychological, and social factors [1]. There are several pathologies associated with aging, including

cognitive impairment, which can vary from mild to very severe. The advanced phases of cognitive
decline (moderate-severe, severe, and very severe) accompanied by functional loss are known as
dementia, which entails a global deterioration of cognitive functions, conduct disorders, mood,
and sleep. Individuals suﬀering from dementia also present changes in mobility that interfere with
their social and instrumental activities, and eventually with basic tasks of daily life [2,3].

Between 60% and 65% of institutionalized elderly people are estimated to have diﬃculties with
stability and gait [4]. The prevalence of falls among this group is 50% [5]. Falls are considered to be
one of the main causes of injury, disability, and even death in elderly patients [6], and they are a major
public health problem [7]. One of the most useful methods for preventing falls is to work on improving
balance, which is essential for correct mobility [4].

Another consequence of cognitive decline is the progressive impairment of the suﬀerers’
communication, which is a basic component of people’s functions and relationships [8]. To mitigate
this problem, social stimulation is an important aspect of therapeutic activities in geriatric centers,
and is designed to decrease social isolation, maintain or stimulate mental capacities, and increase

have limited capacity to slow down the progression of dementia symptoms [10], it is necessary to
develop nonpharmacological methods comprehensively treat people with cognitive impairment or
dementia [11,12].

In addition to nonpharmacological treatments, animal-assisted therapy (AAT), included within
animal-assisted interventions (AAI) together with animal-assisted activities and animal-assisted
education [13], is widely used to enhance the results of such treatments [14]. AAI consists of
the participation of animals in therapeutic or educational interventions to promote health or education
and human well-being [15]. AAT sessions may have a relaxing eﬀect on people with dementia
and promote participant motivation by involving an animal as a therapeutic mediator [16]. One study
found that patients with brain injuries receiving AAT focused on the same activity for a longer time
and demonstrated greater enthusiasm for new exercises [17].

Regarding mobility, there is some emerging evidence that AAT may beneﬁt patients with
hemiparesis due to stroke [18–20], with aphasia [21], and with traumatic brain injury [22]. Walking with
a dog can stimulate correct posture, regain momentum, and promote proper movement [23],
as well as improve balance and gait function [22]. In addition, the interaction between the patient,
the therapy animal, and the therapist has been shown to create a context that improves communication
and conﬁdence [24].

The overall assessment of the included studies indicates moderate eﬀects of dog-assisted activities
in cognitive disorders. However, the majority of studied outcome measures showed no signiﬁcant
eﬀect [15]. In a current systematic review by Yakimicki et al. [25], the majority of the 32 studies included
in the review highlight various beneﬁts of utilizing AAI to alleviate some symptoms of dementia or
to improve social behavior. The authors also point out some important limiting factors, making it
diﬃcult to compare studies, such as the lack of randomization, the absence of control groups, the lack
of clearly deﬁned study protocols and the methodological variability among animal-assisted therapy
studies [26].

In most of these studies, validity is impeded by methodological weaknesses and low numbers of
participants, and results need to be conﬁrmed in more rigorous, larger scale studies. An important
unanswered question is if the presence of the animal provides additional beneﬁts (in comparison with
interventions solely based on human interaction) [27].

For these reasons, the main objective of this study was to evaluate whether AAT can improve
communication and mobility in an institutionalized geriatric population with cognitive impairment
or dementia compared to a non-AAT intervention. This potential improvement was evaluated by
assessing variation in the level of communication and in gait and/or balance.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Design and Participants

We performed a two-arm, parallel controlled, open-label, nonrandomized cluster clinical trial
in two centers. The study sample included 110 institutionalized geriatric patients from two nursing
homes pertaining to the same private entity in the Spanish city of Lleida. We assigned patients in
center 1 (N = 40) as the experimental group (EG) and patients in center 2 (N = 70) as the control group
(CG). We assigned the groups to independent geriatric centers because the presence of the dog could
not be masked and bias could result if patients in the EG and CG shared the same center.

The inclusion criteria of our study were: institutionalized geriatric patients ≥65 years old, with a
diagnosis of cognitive deterioration (Global Deterioration Scale of Reisberg (GDS) ≥2, ≤6) [28], and risk
of falls according to Tinetti scale (≤24) [29]. After an initial interview, we excluded patients with very
severe cognitive deterioration (GDS = 7), or who had allergies to or fear of animals. After applying
these criteria, we excluded one subject who was <65 years old, three subjects that expressed fear
of dogs, 25 subjects with severe cognitive impairment, and one subject who reported having a dog
allergy. Our study included 81 participants, of which 25 belonged to center 1 and 56 to center 2.
Finally, for the sake of equity, we randomly invited 25 of the 56 patients of center 2 to participate in
the study. Thus, our ﬁnal study sample consisted of 50 participants (center 1 (EG), N = 25; center 2 (CG),
N = 25). Participants were informed about the study and were asked to sign an informed consent.
In order to ensure comprehension by patients with severe cognitive impairment (GDS 5–6), consent
was also asked to the caregiver with power of attorney.

A total of 50 participants were included, 25 in each of the two groups (CG and EG). The dropout
rate was 8% (two participants) for each group, and the ﬁnal sample consisted of 46 participants, 23 in
the CG and 23 in the EG. The percentage of women in the ﬁnal sample was 76.1%.

Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics and response variables in each group. The median
age of the ﬁnal sample was 85.0 (IQR 80.2; 87.0) years, with a similar distribution in the CG
(86.0 (IQR 80.5; 87.5)) and EG (83.0 (IQR 80.5; 86.5)). The proportion of women was slightly higher in
the CG (19, 82.6%) than in the EG (16, 69.6%). Regarding cognitive impairment, 4.35% of the total had
very slight cognitive impairment (GDS 2), 13.0% mild cognitive impairment (GDS 3), 10.9% moderate
cognitive impairment (GDS 4), 23.9% moderate-severe cognitive impairment (GDS 5), and 43.5% severe
cognitive impairment (GDS 6). We found no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups for any
of the above-mentioned variables (Table 1).

2.2. General Procedures

In the EG, we applied a physiotherapy and social stimulation program with the participation
of the therapy dog (AAT), and in the CG we performed the same program without the animal.
In the EG, we sought to promote physical contact with the animal (petting, brushing, throwing
balls, feeding, or drinking, etc.), intending to promote communication and relationships between
the participants and generate a casual and relaxed environment. The speciﬁcs of the sessions are
described in Supplementary Table S1. The intervention was carried out at the facilities of both centers.
We chose the nursing home center with the largest multipurpose room, where the AAT program was
carried out, as the one hosting the EG and the other center as the one hosting the CG.

In both groups (EG and CG), we performed one 60 min session per week for 12 weeks. The sessions
were carried out in small groups of six patients (four groups in EG and four in CG), in which diﬀerent
physiotherapy exercises were performed to improve gait and balance (Supplementary Table S1).
The experiment was carried out in two periods of three months, and the eight groups were equally
distributed during these two periods. All sessions included speciﬁc objectives and were previously
designed and agreed on between the diﬀerent professionals, with guidance from the physical therapist,
psychologist, and occupational therapist at the nursing home. Six sessions focused on improving
balance and six sessions on gait. In all sessions, exercises were carried out to enhance communication
between group members. In each session, we encouraged the patients to talk about diﬀerent topics
(e.g., pets, traditional festivals, food, hobbies, news, seasons of the year, etc.).

2.3. Human and Animal Resources

The sessions were facilitated by the same two primary care nurses in both groups (EG and CG).
The EG also included a family doctor with a track record in dog training and technical training
in AAT since 2007. The family doctor was the coordinator of the project. She participated in
the sessions as the AAT technician, and was the responsible of the dog, its training, care, and well-being,
as well as the dog–patient interaction. She is part of the professional team of the Ilerkan association
(www.ilerkan.com), which is a nonproﬁt association dedicated to AAI and has a civil liability insurance.
The physiotherapist and the occupational therapist at the nursing home collaborated in planning
the sessions.

We chose a dog as the AAT animal because of its great ability to interact with people and stimulate
them. The intervention involved one therapy dog that conducted two sessions per week during
the 6 months of the study. The dog was a ﬁve-year-old male German shepherd who was trained
with positive training techniques using the Clicker method [30,31] and was selected based on his
character, aptitude and training using the Liackhoﬀ test [32]. He had been working regularly with
his trainer in diﬀerent centers, so he was used to interacting with strangers. He was regularly
monitored by a veterinarian doctor and always worked with his trainer, the family doctor. The Ilerkan
association internal protocols concerning health aspects and animal wellbeing are speciﬁed in
Supplementary Methods.

2.4. Measurements

To evaluate the eﬀects of the intervention, we measured the response to the variables of interest

by using standard scales applied in physiotherapy and nursing care.

We evaluated communication using the Holden Communication Scale, [33,34] which consists
of 12 items for assessing communication, and is divided into three sections. The ﬁrst entails
observing parameters such initiative, interest, pleasure, and humor; the second evaluates knowledge
of the environment (names, orientation, general knowledge, and spontaneous activity); and the third
assesses communication, such as language,
interest, reaction to objects, and achievement in
communication. The score ranges from 0 to 48, and a lower score indicates a better level
of communication (Cronbach α = 0.94). We administered this questionnaire before and after
the intervention.

To assess gait and balance, we used the Tinetti scale [29,35], which has two sections. The ﬁrst
evaluates sitting and standing balance and the functions of getting up and sitting using 13 parameters
with a maximum score of 16 points (Cronbach α = 0.86). The second evaluates diﬀerent aspects of
walking using nine items with a maximum score of 12 points (Cronbach α = 0.91). The maximum
total score is 28 points (Cronbach α = 0.95). We administered this questionnaire before and after
the intervention.

As groups were not randomized, we also took into account the variables age at the time of
inclusion, sex, and the GDS score [28] in order to assess group comparability. GDS evaluates the degree
of cognitive impairment; the initial score is based on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 5899

6 of 14

considers daily-life activities to assess the individual’s level of dementia. The GDS score ranges from
1 (not impaired) to 7 (very severe cognitive impairment). The GDS stage was assessed by the nursing
home psychologist before the intervention.

2.5. Statistical Analysis

We expressed quantitative variables as the median and interquartile range (IQR), and qualitative
variables as absolute frequencies and percentages. We evaluated group heterogeneity using
the Mann–Whitney test for quantitative variables, and the Chi-squared test for qualitative variables.
We assessed intragroup diﬀerences (postintervention vs. baseline) in the outcome variables using
a paired Mann–Whitney test. Finally, to determine the eﬃcacy of the intervention, we performed
multivariate linear regression models using the postintervention scores as the response, the group
as the predictor and controlling for the respective baseline scores. We also included the interaction
between group and baseline scores. All the variables were mean-centered. We carried out all statistical
analyses using R software [36], and the level of signiﬁcance was set to 5% (α = 0.05).

2.6. Ethical Considerations

Participation in the study was voluntary, the participants were informed before starting, and were
able to leave the study at any time. We treated patients’ personal data conﬁdentially and we used
the data solely for this research, in line with the Spanish Organic Law 15/99 on Personal Data Protection
(LOPD). This study was certiﬁed by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CEIC) of IDIAP Jordi Gol
(code P17/011). We adhered to a protocol on animal welfare and zoonosis prevention. The study was
covered by civil liability insurance for dogs working in therapy.

3. Results

3.1. Basal Scores

Concerning preintervention values, we found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences for any of the scores
measured except for the Tinetti balance variable; the value detected in the EG (median 8.00 (IQR 5.50;
10.0)) was slightly but signiﬁcantly lower than that in the CG (median 10.0 (IQR 9.00; 11.0); p = 0.041).
When analyzing the values according to the degree of cognitive impairment, we found no diﬀerences
between the participants with mild–moderate cognitive impairment (GDS 2–4) and those with severe
cognitive impairment (GDS 5–6) (Table 1).

3.2. Evaluation of the Intervention

After the intervention, there was a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in all response variables
in both the CG and the EG. The median change in the Holden scale was −1.00 for the CG ((IQR −2.00;
0.00), p = 0.004) and −3.00 for the EG ((IQR −5.00; −2.00), p < 0.001). The median diﬀerence in the Tinetti
scale was 1.00 for the CG ((IQR 1.00; 4.00), p < 0.001) and 3.00 for the EG ((IQR 2.00; 3.50), p < 0.001).
The two subdimensions of the Tinetti scale, gait and balance, also showed statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences after the intervention in both groups.

When stratifying by GDS, we observed similar results than with all participants except from in
the Holden scale and the Tinetti gait subdimension. In the case of the Holden scale in patients with
mild–moderate (GDS 2–4) cognitive impairment, the EG showed a signiﬁcant change after intervention
(p = 0.009), but the CG did not (p = 0.098). Regarding the Tinetti gait subdimension, the change after
the intervention was not statistically signiﬁcant in the CG with mild–moderate (GDS 2–4; p = 0.174) or
severe (GDS 5–6; p = 0.149) cognitive impairment. In the EG, there was a signiﬁcant improvement
in the Tinetti gait subdimension in individuals with mild-moderate cognitive impairment (GDS 2–4;
p = 0.026), but not in those with severe cognitive impairment (GDS 5–6; p = 0.065; Table 2).

When comparing the two groups, the improvement in postintervention Holden scale scores
(−2.89 points; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI 95% −4.11, −1.67); p < 0.001) was signiﬁcantly better in
the EG than in the control group (Figure 1, Table 3). No statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in
any of the Tinetti scale scores, and no diﬀerences were found in the eﬀect of the intervention depending
on baseline values (Table 3). The results were similar in participants with mild–moderate cognitive
impairment (GDS 2–4) and those with severe cognitive impairment (GDS 5–6) (Table 3).

4. Discussion

The objective of our study was to investigate the eﬀect of an AAT program on communication
and mobility in an institutionalized geriatric population with mild-moderate and severe cognitive
impairment or dementia.

AAT has been reported to slow the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mild- or
early-stage dementia [37,38], and is considered to oﬀer a social interaction that does not depend on
the cognitive level of the recipient [39]. For this reason, patients with mild and moderate cognitive
impairment were also included in our study, although previous reports have focused only individuals
with severe cognitive impairment or dementia [11,40–47].

In our study, the programmed intervention in people with cognitive impairment was eﬀective
in improving mobility (balance and gait, evaluated using the Tinetti scale). The intervention also
improved communication, including aspects such as initiative, liking, humor, and interest (evaluated
using the Holden scale). Furthermore, our AAT showed a signiﬁcant improvement in communication
skills of almost three points on the Holden scale with respect to the CG.

A limited number of studies have focused on evaluating the eﬀects of AAT on gait and balance in
people with mild–moderate and severe cognitive impairment or dementia. The results obtained in
the clinical trial performed by Olsen et al. [48] showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect on balance and the fall risk
compared to the control group. Although our exercises were similar to those of Olsen et al. [48], we did
not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the EG and CG, which may be because in our intervention,
(i) the same exercises were also performed in the CG, or (ii) our sample was smaller than that
of Olsen et al. Positive eﬀects in the area of physical health had also been studied by Cherniack
and Cherniack [47], but with modest results, highlighting the health beneﬁts for elderly people of
walking a dog.

Regarding the observed improvement in communication, our results reinforce the idea that group
AAT may promote more spontaneous communication and greater interaction between participants.
These results are in agreement with those of other studies in the institutionalized geriatric population
that suggested that AAT may increase positive social behaviors [26,49] and reduce social isolation
and loneliness [15,25]. Similarly, our results were in line with those of Hediger et al. [50], who observed
a signiﬁcant improvement in social behavior during AAT sessions. Swall et al. [51] reported that AAT
participants talked more about memories and feelings when the animal was present.

Thus, and in line with previous reports [52], the participation of therapy dogs showed positive
results in healthcare settings dealing with people with dementia. The therapies contributed to
spontaneity in the sessions and may have helped generate a more relaxed environment that favored
communication and improved participants’ ability to concentrate during the session. These inherent
features of AAT may help motivate the patient during the treatment process [53,54]. A preliminary
study conducted by Menna et al. [55] found that the repeated multisensory stimuli (verbal, visual,
tactile) provided by the therapy dog were eﬀective. AAT has been considered a meaningful activity
that provides stimulation and social interaction [56,57], and improves the participants’ mood [20,58,59].
Furthermore, interventions that favor communication and an optimistic atmosphere can have a positive

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 5899

10 of 14

impact on social interactions [9,60,61], as our study reﬂected. These results were in agreement with
previous reports indicating that AAT can improve social interactions [11,12] and have a positive eﬀect
on communication [62,63], both verbal and nonverbal [64,65].

5. Limitations

One of the limitations of our study was the ﬁnal sample size, which limited our statistical power,
although it was indeed bigger than those of other studies [66–68]. Increasing the sample size may
allow us to observe a signiﬁcant eﬀect, not only for the communication variable, but also for gait
and balance. However, this sample size granted enough statistical power to detect a signiﬁcant
and clinically relevant improvement in the main outcome variables. Another limitation was the open
design of the study, in which double-blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention.
To minimize this limitation, we decided to restrict the EG to one center and the CG to the other, instead
of randomizing the entire sample. This lack of randomization is itself another limitation. However,
both nursing homes pertain to the same entity, and interventions in both groups (EG and CG) were
performed by exactly the same professionals in both centers, apart from the dog. Another limitation
was the fragility of the elderly participants, some of whom were at risk of worsening health, which
made it diﬃcult for them to participate in some of the sessions. Furthermore, people with dementia
had diﬃculty following the instructions; to mitigate this, sessions were held in small groups.

6. Conclusions

This study supports the beneﬁts of AAT in improving communication in people with cognitive
impairment in nursing homes. We also observed an improvement in gait and balance in both therapy
groups compared to the beginning of the sessions. This demonstrates that AAT might be useful as a
complementary, eﬀective treatment for patients with diﬀerent degrees of cognitive decline. Our results
contribute to the scientiﬁc basis for using nonpharmacological methods in the care of institutionalized
elderly people. Further studies should be performed in order to evaluate the cost-eﬀectivity of the AAT
in the treatment of elderly people with cognitive impairment.
