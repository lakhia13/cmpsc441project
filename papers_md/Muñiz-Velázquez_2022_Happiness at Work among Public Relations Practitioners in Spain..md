Abstract: Happiness at work is a consolidated topic. Perhaps the PR and communication sector,
often at the forefront of organizational change, is one of the industries where most progress has been
made in this regard. The objective of the present study was to carry out an exploratory analysis on
the extent to which PR is a profession that enables the development of happiness in the workplace.
To this end, a questionnaire was administered to a sample of PR professionals in Spain (N = 256).
The questionnaire consisted of the PERMA-proﬁler, a model where work relationships, engagement,
positive affections/emotions, vital sense/purpose and achievements are measured. The results show
a remarkable level of happiness among surveyed professionals, especially among women, who
obtained higher scores on all ﬁve factors, although with a statistically signiﬁcant difference only in
two of the ﬁve factors in PERMA (Engagement and Relationships). Neither age nor the hierarchical
level of the respondent had any incidence. Therefore, PR can be a profession that notably enables
human ﬂourishing at work, even more so among women.

1. Introduction

Happiness at work is something that, fortunately, is far from being a ﬂeeting fad. Today,
from the academic and research ﬁeld, we ﬁnd ample evidence that happiness, both hedonic
and eudaimonic, and subjective, psychological and social well-being, are central axes for
organizational development [1]. Likewise, from the business and professional perspective,
there are also many industry sectors and small, medium and large companies that have
placed the psychological well-being of their employees, and the rest of their stakeholders,
at the center in terms of management. This is aligned with Díaz, Dearco and Arbeláez [2],
when they claim that any feasible management of organizational happiness must reach all
stakeholders, but it must always start with the employees. It is worth remembering that
although happiness at work includes job satisfaction, it goes much further, as mentioned
a few years ago by Fisher [3]. Now, in terms of the concept of organizational happiness
or happiness at work, Moccia [4] speaks of a lack of consensus regarding its deﬁnition
or conﬁguration. However, rather than a lack of consensus, perhaps one could consider
the coexistence of different models, given the multidisciplinary and complex nature of
the phenomenon [5,6]. In any case, the different approaches seem to agree on the most
essential aspects.

Thus, with emphasis on one or another aspect, overall happiness at work, or what can

also be called human ﬂourishing [7], consists of three main pillars:

Firstly, subjective well-being, mainly around satisfaction with the work itself, as well

as related positive emotions.

Secondly, psychological well-being, concerning personal, intellectual and cognitive

growth and development, autonomy, life purpose, among others.

Thirdly, social well-being, grounded, among other things, on the positive and nourish-

ing relationships that a job offers [8,9].

In short, according to Krekel, Ward and de Neve [10], a job is good if it is interesting,
lacks excessive stress and high risks, involves good relationships, especially with bosses,
and does not interfere excessively with family and personal life. One might say that
it should go beyond a mere lack of interference, to allow for the possibility of mutual
enrichment between work and personal life. Given that, as Weziak-Bialowolska et al. [11]
emphasize, the overlap between well-being at work and well-being in life, in general, is
indisputable. This is especially true if one considers the purpose of life and its day-to-day
implementation, these authors state.

In short, although some emphasize subjective well-being [12], when talking about
happiness at work, a series of aspects are brought into play that go much further, and
which are related to psychological well-being or eudaimonic happiness. Although it has
centuries of history, eudaimonia remains a multi-faceted and complex concept. Broadly, it
would involve happiness based on universal values and virtues, on the development and
cultivation of a vital sense, on growth as a person, human excellence, etc. [13]. However,
eudaimonia and hedonia—or subjective well-being—are not only non-conﬂicting, but for
the sake of the fulﬁllment of life as human beings, they should complement and nourish
each other [14].

At this point, among the multiple existing models to approach the observation of
happiness at work, and in life in general, the present study adopted a holistic approach
where subjective well-being or hedonic happiness, psychological well-being or eudaimonic
happiness, and also social well-being are incorporated. This is related to the concept of
human ﬂourishing, deﬁned by Seligman [7] as that psychological growth and personal
development that brings us closer to the fullness of life in psychological and psychosocial
terms, and that is articulated, according to the same author, around different factors
or key ingredients of our lives. These factors are summarized in a ﬁve-pillar model
called PERMA [7]. Speciﬁcally, and in the employment domain, its ﬁve pillars could be
summarized as follows:

P: Positive emotions: positive emotions that are felt and experienced throughout
the day, in this case, in the work environment. It has to do with mental and emotional
well-being, self-acceptance and perceived autonomy.

E: Engagement: the degree to which the person feels positively involved in the day-
to-day tasks of his/her job, whether large or small, resulting in an overall commitment
to his/her work. It is also related to the balance between professional and personal life
and the environmental domain. Authors such as Kaul and Sen [15], among others, have
emphasized the mutual relationship between engagement and happiness at work.

R: Relationships: quantity and quality of interpersonal relationships that are positive

and nourishing for the well-being of the person at work. This refers to social well-being.

M: Meaning: signiﬁcance or purpose that we attribute to our life. Thinking and feeling
that our life in general responds to a purpose that transcends ourselves, and where our
work plays a prominent role, given the time we devote to it in our lives. Under this model,
we refer to the more spiritual dimension of human happiness.

A: Accomplishment: close to the concept of self-fulﬁllment. To feel and realize that a
good part of the goals and objectives set are achieved, thus growing as an individual, and
in our case, it includes the professional ﬁeld.

In short, to achieve that human ﬂourishing, within and thanks in part to our work,
we would need: (1) to feel more positive emotions than negative ones during our working
day; (2) to ﬁnd ourselves with tasks that engage us per se, because we enjoy them; (3) to be
surrounded in our work by people with whom we can build positive, nurturing, enriching
relationships; (4) to have a relatively solid vital purpose, and to connect it, at least in part,
with our profession, with our job and with the company for which we work; (5) and ﬁnally,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3987

3 of 11

to achieve the professional goals and objectives that we set for ourselves, and those that
make us grow and achieve self-fulﬁllment in our career, and also as individuals.

With regard to the possible difference in work happiness between male and female
professionals, also in PR, some differences could be expected in favor of women, if we take
into account previous studies in other professional sectors, and with alternative theoretical
models of approach [16]. As far as age is concerned, the variation in terms of happiness
throughout life has been long studied [17]. Despite this, it is still a controversial issue [18],
because there are many factors that may be mediating between happiness and lifespan [19].
Especially if it is limited to the work setting. In that sense, it is important to think about
promotion on the hierarchical scale within the company, something roughly related to age.
In any case, given the eudaimonic load of the PERMA model, one would expect a relatively
greater degree of happiness in professionals who are older, more mature and experienced,
whose work expectations are more in line with reality. In that sense, and related to age, it is
worth asking whether the hierarchical level held in the agency could inﬂuence or be related
positively in some way to happiness, following Garzon Castrillon et al. [12].

In short, whether or not gender, age, or hierarchical position in the agency are involved,
this study aimed to provide evidence to demonstrate the extent to which we can argue
that PR is a profession that facilitates or promotes a more or less integral happiness, that is,
hedonic, eudaimonic and social, to people who choose to develop their professional career
in this sector. The Spanish geographical area provides the ﬁrst sample of this approach. In
short, it was a matter of verifying whether it is true that the happiness a person hopes to
ﬁnd in their job when he/she decides to embark on a professional career in that ﬁeld [20]
surfaces later, once the person is already immersed in the profession.

This research is relevant and timely due to the globally competitive nature of the PR
landscape [21]. This paper contributes to the limited literature focusing on the PERMA
model in the PR sector and seeks to critically explore and understand the happiness or
human ﬂourishing of its professionals in the performance of their work. This research
is exclusive in nature. As for recent studies on happiness at work by sector, we can ﬁnd
research looking at jobs in the education ﬁeld [22], in the health and hospital sector [23],
as well as small and medium sized commercial enterprises (SMEs) [24]. We can even ﬁnd
studies on happiness at work, that apply the PERMA model to a sample of professional
musicians [25]. However, in the speciﬁc ﬁeld of communication and PR, there are no studies
focused entirely on happiness at work. The closest study found is the one conducted by
Place [26], who focused on the moral development of PR professionals and its importance
in the context of communication as an industry. Thus, the present work explores the
well-being held by PR professionals in Spain regarding differences between gender, age,
and held position because the working and social environment is a relevant source of
satisfaction [3] or dissatisfaction at the workplace.

This means that the self-perceived happiness of the respondents, their subjective well-
being or hedonic level, is slightly lower than their psychological well-being observed by
the PERMA variables, that is, eudaimonic happiness. It is determinant for institutional
development [1] and managerial implications of organizational happiness, especially for
the employees [2,3]. In addition, the present work contributes to paying attention to
the reality of the daily work of PR professionals. In terms of limitations, although the
population studied is representative, the sample should be larger. Related to future studies
and recommendations, we could complement the PERMA analysis with other scales that
include psychological factors.

2. Hypothesis and Method

In line with previous ﬁndings, the general objective of this study is to determine
whether PR professionals ﬁnd a desirable level of happiness and human ﬂourishing in their
profession. At the same time, we wanted to verify the inﬂuence or interference that the
aforementioned factors could have on it, such as sex, age, or the hierarchical level occupied

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3987

4 of 11

within the agency or company. Thus, and always starting from the cited PERMA model of
human ﬂourishing [7], the following hypotheses were posed:

Hypothesis 1 (H1). PR is a profession that enables human ﬂourishing and happiness at work.

Hypothesis 2 (H2). Female PR professionals are happier at work than their male counterparts.

Hypothesis 3 (H3). The older the PR professional, the greater the happiness and human ﬂourishing
at work.

Hypothesis 4 (H4). The position or hierarchical level affects the happiness of PR professionals
at work.

According to the PERMA model, several tools or questionnaires have been developed,
among which the scales by Kun et al. [27] stand out, as well as the PERMA-proﬁler by
Butler and Kern [28]. For the present study, the latter was chosen, as it has been validated
in English and Spanish [29,30]. Likewise, it has a version focused on the workplace, which
has been adapted and validated by Watanabe et al. [31], the Workplace PERMA-proﬁler.

Thus, the mentioned scale consists of 23 items with an 11-point scale, with choices
between 0 and 10 (see Supplementary Materials). Fifteen of the items are distributed equally
among the ﬁve factors in the model, to which three other items are added to evaluate health
(H), in order, among other things, to rule out possible problems that could be distorting the
measurement. An additional item is added to measure the feeling of loneliness (L), and
another one that asks about happiness of a more hedonic nature or subjective well-being in
general, in our case related to work (Hap).

Finally, three more items are added to the scale that will measure negative emotions
(NE), so that they can be contrasted with the rest of the items to check the validity of the
answers for the rest of the questionnaire, while at the same time obtaining a measurement,
albeit an inverse one, of subjective well-being or hedonia beyond the aforementioned item.
Thus, as Goodman et al. [32] state, the PERMA measurement effectively concurs with
subjective well-being (SWB).

For the present study, therefore, a questionnaire was implemented consisting of the
Workplace PERMA-proﬁler, together with other socio-demographic and employment
issues, delivered online through Qualtrics. The sample of professionals who participated
belonged to the database of Spanish companies or agencies within the Association of
Consulting Companies in Public Relations and Communication in Spain (ADECEC for its
initials in Spanish), and which comprised diverse professional proﬁles, covering the usual
professional spectrum of the industry. All legal and ethical requirements were met, and the
Ethics Committee of the University Loyola Andalucía supervised the process. The sample
members that correctly completed the entire questionnaire totaled N = 256, and included
mostly female professionals, with the percentage of women accounting for 68.3% of total
respondents, compared to 31.7% male respondents. The average age was 36 years, ranging
from 22 to 59 years. It should be noted that communication agencies in Spain, as a whole
sector, employed around 2000 people at the time of the study (years 2019–2020), thus the
degree of representativeness of the sample of this group is remarkable.

3. Results

After analyzing the results, the ﬁrst aspect to note is that the whole sample had a mean
of M = 7.26 (SD 1.26) in the Workplace PERMA-proﬁler scale. Table 1 shows the results
in detail. If we consider that the maximum was 10, we could conﬁdently accept H1. In
other words, PR provides sufﬁcient elements, always under the PERMA model, to notably
develop the happiness or human ﬂourishing of its professionals in the performance of their
work. It is also true, however, that there is room for improvement to reach 10. On the
other hand, it is interesting to note that the ﬁve factors of the PERMA model appeared
well-balanced in the sample as a whole.

That is, in the items related to positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships,
meaning and achievements, the scores obtained in the sample were even (see Table 1).
It is true that the relationship factor stands out at the top, while meaning was the
factor that remained below, although the difference between the five factors was not
statistically significant.

Secondly, with respect to the hypothesis relating to gender difference, higher scores
were found among women on all ﬁve parameters, with a statistically signiﬁcant difference
in two of the ﬁve factors in PERMA, engagement (E) (p = 0.029) and relationships (R)
(p = 0.000). Statistically signiﬁcant differences were also found in favor of women in the
self-assessment of health (p = 0.040) (see Table 2). Therefore, one could partially accept H2,
at least partially (see Table 1). That is, with respect to men, it may be partially suggested
that women who work in PR ﬁnd greater happiness in their work, fundamentally thanks
to a greater commitment and increased enjoyment of relationships that they perceive
as nourishing. However, it should be again noted that only in two of the ﬁve PERMA
dimensions it was founded that the differences were statistically signiﬁcant. In terms of
age and its relationship to happiness in the work of PR professionals (H3), it can be said
that no signiﬁcant differences were found between different age and happiness groups.
Therefore, H3 would be rejected, that is, in the level of happiness in general and in each of
the ﬁve PERMA factors observed, no differences were found according to age. Finally, with
respect to H4, it is also rejected, since no signiﬁcant differences were found according to
the position or hierarchical level of the participant. Therefore, in general terms, happiness
in the work of PR professionals is independent of the rank or position held.

Beyond the ﬁve factors of the PERMA model, the scale measured other issues. Thus,
the three items referring to health resulted in a mean of M = 7.02 (SD 1.74), with no
signiﬁcant differences in age or position. There were, however, differences between genders,
with women displaying a higher level of health. Therefore, it can be said that the sample as
a whole felt remarkably healthy, especially female respondents.

As for the items measuring negative emotions associated with work and completing
the measurement of the Workplace PERMA-proﬁler tool, the overall mean was M = 4.81
(SD 1.95), without differences of any kind between subgroups. Taking into account that we
are dealing with inverse items, where the lowest score is desirable in principle, negative
emotions at work were present in a very moderate way, below the midpoint. The item
that measures the feeling of loneliness at work was even lower. In this case, an average of
3.67 was found, although the standard deviation was slightly higher than normal (SD 2.36).
That is, since the feeling of loneliness at work is generally low, there is greater heterogeneity
of cases in this sense. Finally, in the face of item 23, which asks directly about the subjective
happiness or well-being considered to be at work (“Considering everything as a whole,
how happy would you say you are at work?”), the total mean was 6.88 (SD 1.89), slightly
below the PERMA measurements, but not in excess, nor signiﬁcantly so. This means that
the self-perceived happiness of the respondents, their subjective well-being or hedonic level,
is slightly lower than their psychological well-being observed by the PERMA variables,
that is, eudaimonic happiness.

4. Discussion

Once the results have been outlined, we can conclude that public relations profession-
als in Spain, speciﬁcally from a representative sample drawn from the entire population of
people working in communication agencies in Spain, are certainly capable of ﬁnding in
their work a rich source of happiness and human ﬂourishing. It is especially so because, in
general terms, they always feel loved, appreciated and valued by all their colleagues, receiv-
ing support from them and ultimately showing great satisfaction with their relationships in
the ofﬁce. The four other pillars of the observed human ﬂourishing model also help them
feel happy [7]. That is, there are more positive than negative emotions in their day-to-day
work, they like their job and enjoy most of the tasks they perform, they are able to ﬁnd their
vital purpose, or at least part of it, in their work, and they feel they have enough margin to
achieve career goals that allow them to grow as professionals and as people.

With regard to the differences between men and women, and in accordance with
previous studies [16], we should emphasize that in the measurement as a whole, women
always scored higher. We also found statistically signiﬁcant differences in two of the ﬁve
key factors of the PERMA model. There is also a statistically signiﬁcant difference in favor
of women in their self-perception of health. Thus, female public relations professionals

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3987

feel signiﬁcantly more absorbed in the work they are doing, i.e., more involved in the
tasks carried out in general. They are also more cheerful and feel in better health, but
above all more accompanied, supported and loved, and in general more satisﬁed with their
relationships at work than their male colleagues.

As for the age difference and its relationship to happiness at work, no difference was
found. The variation of happiness throughout life has been studied for a long time [17].
Despite this, it is still a controversial issue [18], because there are many factors that may be
mediating between happiness and lifespan [19]. Even more so if we restrict it to the work
environment. In that sense, let’s think about the promotion of individuals in the hierarchical
scale within the company, something roughly related to age. It is not by chance, therefore,
that no signiﬁcant differences in happiness were found according to the hierarchical level.
In any case, beyond the gender differences detected, the dataset portrays remarkably
happy professionals in their work. That is to say, satisﬁed with a profession and/or job
where they ﬁnd sufﬁcient well-being that constitutes labor well-being, both subjective and
psychological, and always under the PERMA model by Seligman [7]. It seems, however,
and as already noted, that there is room for improvement in all dimensions. That is, if they
were school grades, it would indicate a low “B”.

Nevertheless, it is convenient to point out that the data extracted from the sample
are similar to other studies that have used a similar measurement system, although at a
general vital level, and that, limiting the observation to the work environment, the results
are clearly superior to other studies in the same line. Looking at some of the other studies
carried out in other sectors and latitudes, the ﬁrst thing to note is that, with this particular
tool, the PERMA-proﬁler, both in its version of general happiness and in its adaptation to
the workplace (Workplace PERMA-proﬁler), has not yet been used very often, among other
things because it has only recently emerged.

Thus, for example, among the few examples found we see the work of Ascenso,
Perkins and Williamon [25] with musicians from different countries (N = 601). They found
a total mean of M = 7.34 (SD 1.68), highlighting among the ﬁve factors the vital purpose
(M, meaning). That is, somewhat above the score obtained for the general population,
according to the baseline measure carried out by Butler and Kern [28], who, for a sample
of almost 32,000 people from different countries, found the following measures: P = 6.69
(SD 1.97); E = 7.25 (SD 1.77); R = 6.9 (SD 2.15); M = 7.06 (SD 2.17); A = 7.21 (SD 1.78). They
obtained a global mean of M = 7.02 (SD 1.66). More recently, Ryan et al. [33], for their
part, found in their PERMA-proﬁler validation study in the Australian adult population
(N = 439), a total score of M = 6.6 (SD 1.5).

Moreover, in the validation of the PERMA-proﬁler in Spanish, Pastrana and Salazar-
Piñeros [34] found a total mean of the ﬁve factors of M = 7.73 (SD 1.37). The study was
conducted with young men and women in Colombia who were volunteering (N = 230).
Similarly, Lima-Castro et al. [35], for a sample of N = 1247 adults in Ecuador found a
global mean of M = 8.17 (SD 3.12), somewhat superior to other studies, but with a very
wide variance.

Furthermore, Cobo-Rendón et al. [36], found that among 1462 Chilean students with
ages averaging 19, their PERMA values were certainly low, with an overall mean of M = 4.95
SD (1.4). While this may be surprising at ﬁrst, it is consistent with many other studies
related to age range and the happiness curve, mainly eudaimonic, which requires a certain
maturity. Think, for example, of the vital purpose, for which it is necessary to have gone
through a good part of life. It should be noted, on the other hand, that all these studies were
conducted using the general PERMA-proﬁler scale, meaning that it was not adapted to the
work environment. With this last version we only ﬁnd the work of Watanabe et al. [31],
who applied it to a heterogeneous sample of Japanese workers, obtaining a mean P = 5.46
(SD 2.3); E = 5.86 (SD 2.2); R = 5.59 (2.0); M = 6.24 (SD 2.1); A = 6.19 (1.9). We see how the
results are notoriously inferior to those obtained in our study, although the difference may
be due to the cultural and idiosyncratic distance of Japanese society (see Table 3).

It should be noted that none of these studies under the PERMA model mentioned
above showed statistically signiﬁcant differences in relation to age. Nor did they appear in
relation to gender, unlike our study, where differences in favor of women were found.

Some of the study’s limitations include sample size, for example. Although it is con-
siderable and representative of the population studied, it is always desirable to achieve
the largest possible sample size. On the other hand, it would have been interesting to
complement the measurements with other scales, which would enrich the observation
of the variables. Other types of socio-labor factors, such as income level, education, de-
pendents, years in the company, etc., could also have been taken into account. Likewise,
the measurement of other psychological factors, such as certain personality traits, values,
ethical issues, etc., could also have contributed greatly. The truth is that, conversely, all
these factors would have lengthened the questionnaire excessively, making it even more
difﬁcult to reach a reasonable sample, considering the time spent by the respondents on our
questions, normally during their workday. Even so, we believe that this study mitigates,
at least in part, the limited attention paid to the reality of the professionals and their day-
to-day work, within the framework of ever-growing research on PR, as indicated, among
others by Jiankun Guo and Anderson [37].

5. Conclusions

In short, one could say that public relations professionals, at least in a wide sample
of Spanish practitioners, reasonably ﬁnd all the necessary elements to achieve human
ﬂourishing in their profession, always following the PERMA model by Seligman [7]. They
do so in a remarkable way, although perhaps it would be advisable to carry out a reﬂection
as a sector, to consider how to achieve the margin of improvement indicated by the data.
On the other hand, what some call the psychological capital of companies [38], which
would characterize a truly positive organization [39], where a generalized leadership of an
inspirational or transformational nature ﬂourishes, which is one of the fundamental keys
to organizational happiness [24,40–42].

Thus, in general terms, and carefully extrapolating the results obtained from the

sample that represented the sector in this study, we can emphasize that:

Public relations professionals in Spain are reasonably happy in their work.
Women ﬁnd greater happiness as PR professionals, especially because of greater
engagement and relationships. However, age, along with the hierarchical level within the
agency, do not affect the level of happiness.

The main source of this happiness lies in the positive and enriching relationships that
the professionals ﬁnd in their environment, as well as the fact that they experience, in
general terms, more positive emotions than negative ones during their day-to-day work. It
should be noted that this is consistent with the fact that the social and working environment
is one of the main sources of satisfaction [3] or dissatisfaction at the workplace.

Public relations professionals in Spain are happy in their work because they generally
enjoy the tasks inherent in their work and their position, and they are committed to it in a
remarkable way, an aspect that is related to another key issue: intrinsic motivation [1].

Public relations professionals in Spain are also happy in their work because their work

offers the means of achieving professional goals and, therefore, personal self-fulﬁllment.

Of the ﬁve factors that make up what we could call “professional ﬂourishing”, in line
with Seligman’s model [7], the vital purpose and its connection with the work is not at an
unsatisfactory level, but it seems to be the main factor to improve.

In relation to the last point, it should be stressed that if we seriously consider that
we are at the beginning of an era in which having a real, sincere and honest purpose at
the organizational level (beyond the purely monetary) is already a precondition, not only
for the development of the organization but to a large extent for its survival. It should be
noted that all this is being built at the personal and individual level, in the interest of that
adjustment between the person and the organization, which is key to the ﬂourishing of
both [43]. That is to say, if an agency must help its clients to build a true corporate purpose,
ﬁrst it is necessary for the agency to have its own purpose clear, and its professionals too,
and all of them aligned in a balanced way, as Bauer [44], or Rey and Malbašic [45], among
many others, point out. When a person has a clear vital purpose as an individual and, to a
great extent, that purpose is in accordance with his professional facet, the vital and labor
fulﬁllment becomes more feasible.

In regard to the main limitations of this paper, it is necessary to underline the sample
size. A greater number of practitioners surveyed would have been desirable, but the
difﬁcult-to-collect responses from usually very busy practitioners were considerable. In
addition to this, another limitation could refer to the fact that other causes of happiness
are not studied, as well as neither other possible variables that could be inﬂuencing it,
which could be an interesting ﬁeld of future studies. On the other hand, as another way to
develop future lines of research, it would be interesting to make the comparison between
practitioners from different sectors, simultaneously and with the same tools. Only then
it could be possible to infer differences in a statistically plausible way among job sectors.
Finally, it is convenient to note that this research was developed just before the COVID-19
pandemic. It would be interesting to take this into account for comparative studies in the
post-pandemic era.

In any case, when asked whether public relations professionals are really happy in
their jobs, we can answer that they are. However, we must also say that there is room for
improvement. Therefore, the task ahead is to remember that people’s happiness is not
only a key factor of professional and business success [46], but it is also an end in itself as
stated by Biswas-Diener and Wiese [47]. In other words, what we can ultimately call the
eudaimonic growth of a company involves the eudaimonic growth of all its stakeholders,
starting with its professionals. It is here where the ethical dimension of this personal and
organizational ﬂowering is clearly evident, even though it has appeared merely in passing
in the PERMA model used. Stortini [48], or Place [26], among many others, stress the need
for ethics in a profession such as PR, the former reminding us of Kant’s words when he
deﬁned it as that science that teaches us not how to achieve happiness, but how to be
worthy of it.
