Abstract

Anxiety disorders have traditionally been conceptualized as reflecting the emotions of fear and
anxiety. A developing program of research demonstrates a relation between disgust and three specific
anxiety disorders: blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia, spider phobia, and contamination-related
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This review serves three purposes. First, the authors review
the response patterns predicted to be observed if the emotional response in these disorders involved
disgust versus fear. The review suggests specific response patterns that characterize disgust and fear
in the domains of heart rate, facial expression, neural activity, and cognitive processes. Second, the
authors review extant research employing measures of these domains in spider phobia, BII phobia,
and contamination-related OCD. The evidence suggests that both fear and disgust characterize each
of these disorders, but the magnitude at which the emotions characterize the disorders may depend
on the response domain measured. For example, disgust may be more involved in spider phobia in
appraisals and facial expression, but less involved in neural correlates or heart rate domains. Third,
the authors suggest guidelines for future research, including concurrent use of specific measures as
well as examining whether the different emotions in different response domains respond to similar
interventions (e.g., exposure).

Introduction

An anxiety disorder is typically conceptualized as an interrelated pattern of responding that
reflects two emotions; fear and anxiety (Barlow, 2002; 2000; Rosen & Schulkin, 1998). Recent
research suggests that fear is an organism’s defensive response to a present threat, whereas
anxiety is an organism’s preparatory response to contexts in which a threat may occur (Barlow,
2002; Davis, 2006; Lang, Davis, & Öhman, 2000; Quinn & Fanselow, 2006; Walker & Davis,
1997). Although research investigating the etiology and maintenance processes of particular
anxiety disorders has focused primarily on these two emotions, recent research suggests that
some anxiety disorders (e.g., spider phobia, contamination-related obsessive compulsive
disorder, blood-injury-injection phobia) may be associated with an additional emotion, disgust
(Woody & Teachman, 2000). Indeed, in clinical (McKay, 2006; Olatunji & Sawchuk, 2005;
Woody & Teachman, 2000) and basic research (Rozin & Fallon, 1987; Rozin, Fallon, &
Augustoni-Ziskind, 1984; Rozin, Fallon, & Mandell, 1984), interest on disgust has grown
immensely over the past 20 years, prompting McNally (2002) to announce ‘disgust has
arrived.’

Given the wealth of data collected on disgust and fear in spider phobia, blood-injection-injury
(BII) phobia, and contamination-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), it is necessary
to examine the relative contributions of disgust and fear in these disorders. Elucidating the
magnitude to which disgust and fear contribute to these anxiety disorders will serve several
purposes. First, this line of inquiry critically examines the growing program of research on
disgust and certain anxiety disorders (e.g., b & McKay, 2007; Olatunji & Sawchuk, 2005;
Woody & Teachman, 2000). If disgust functions in anxiety disorders to a comparable
magnitude as fear, this growing program of research may develop into a viable paradigm by
which particular anxiety disorders (e.g., spider phobia) are conceptualized. Second, this line
of inquiry critically examines previous assertions that disgust may play a minor role compared
to fear in these anxiety disorders (Edwards & Salkovskis, 2006; Rachman, 2006; Thorpe &
Salkovskis, 1998). For example, Edwards and Salkovskis (2006) found that presenting vomit
(i.e., a disgust stimulus) during exposure therapy for spider phobia did not lead to a return of
self-reported anxiety towards spiders. These authors concluded that “although disgust clearly
can be part of the emotional reaction to some phobic stimuli, the presents results suggest that
this reaction may be secondary to fear” (p. 69). Critical examination of this competing assertion
is important in development of the disgust program of research. Third, this line of inquiry
would facilitate the development of theories by which these disorders are developed and
maintained. For example, Antony and Barlow’s (2002, p.408) model of the development of
specific phobia does not, at least explicitly, include a component of disgust. Conversely,
Armfield’s (2006) recent theory of cognitive vulnerabilities towards developing fear posits that
perceptions of disgust are a pivotal factor in the development of fear towards particular objects/
situations. Elucidation of the relative contributions of disgust and fear in these disorders would
facilitate comprehensive models of how these disorders are developed and maintained. Fourth,
this line of inquiry may begin to suggest therapeutic techniques to enhance treatment efficacy.
For example, extant treatments of specific phobia are efficacious (Choy et al., 2007; Wolitzky-
Taylor, in press), yet effect sizes tend to be variable (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., in press). If disgust
does play a prominent role in these anxiety disorders, the inclusion of procedures to target
disgust may lead to more consistent treatment effects.

The purpose of the current review is to examine the relative contributions of fear and disgust
in spider phobia, BII phobia, and contamination-related OCD. This purpose is specifically
pursued by examining the degree to which the emotional response towards disorder-relevant
stimuli in these anxiety disorders is characteristic of disgust or fear. For example, to what
degree does the emotional response towards spiders in spider phobia resemble a disgust
response? To what degree does the emotional response towards spiders in spider phobia
resemble a fear response? The review focuses on the relative contributions of disgust and fear
in the emotional response of these disorders because of the common conceptualization of these
disorders as fear and anxiety based (e.g., Antony & Barlow, 2002; Rachman, 2006). Moreover,
treatments of these disorders based on fear and anxiety conceptualizations do not include
procedures to target disgust (e.g., see Öst and colleagues’ treatments for spider and BII phobia;
Öst, Fellenious, & Sterner, 1991; Öst, 1997). If disgust is indeed a part of the emotional
response in these disorders, conceptualizations and treatments of the disorders may need to be
modified in order to account for disgust. The current review does not examine the relative
contributions of disgust and fear in the etiology of these anxiety disorders. Although the role
of disgust in the etiology of these disorders is theoretically interesting in its own right (see, for
example, an interesting study by Muris et al., 2008), the literature on the role of disgust in the
etiology of these anxiety disorders is currently limited and conclusions would be difficult to
derive. The review is focused on spider phobia, BII phobia, and contamination-related OCD
because they have received the most empirical and theoretical attention (Olatunji & Sawchuk,
2005; Woody & Teachman, 2000).

There are three sections to the current review. First, elucidating the relative contributions of
disgust and fear necessitates an elucidation of the specific response topographies expected to
be observed if the emotional response is fear or disgust. These specific response components
then directly facilitate an examination of the relative contributions of disgust and fear. That is,
if the emotional response involves disgust, it follows that disgust specific response domains
would be observed; if the emotional response involves fear, it follows that fear specific response
domains would be observed. Second, research employing specific measures of disgust and fear
in spider phobia, BII phobia, and contamination-related OCD is critically examined in order
to elucidate the relative magnitude to which the emotional response reflects fear and disgust.
Finally, guidelines for future research investigating the relation between disgust and anxiety-
related pathology are put forward to facilitate a progressive program of investigation.

Distinguishing Disgust from Fear

Theoretical background of operational definitions

Fear is characterized by an organism’s defensive response to imminent threat (Barlow, 2002;
2000; Quinn & Fanselow; 2006). At the phenomenological level, fear is typically defined by
three response systems (Lang, 1968; Lipp, 2006; Kozak & Martin, 1982): overt behavior,
verbal-cognitive, and physiological. For example, an individual’s fear of spiders may be
exhibited by inhibited approach towards a spider in a behavioral approach task (i.e., overt
behavioral system), verbally reported subjective units of distress (SUDs) ratings in the presence
of spiders or attentional bias towards spiders (i.e., verbal-cognitive system), and a heightened
heart rate in the presence of spiders (i.e., physiological system).

Disgust is characterized by a revulsion response towards potential contamination (Olatunji &
Cisler, in press; Olatunji & Sawchuk, 2005; Rozin & Fallon, 1987; Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley,
2000). At the phenomenological level, researchers studying disgust typically define disgust in
the same three systems as fear (Olatunji & Cisler, in press; Woody & Teachman, 2000). Woody
and Teachman (2000) differentiate fear and disgust along the dimensions of behavioral
intentions, appraisal, and physiological processes. They argue that avoidance characterizes
both fear and disgust, but for different reasons: “fear-motivated avoidance protects the person
from perceived danger, while disgust-motivated avoidance may be more often linked to
sensation or imagery” (p. 293). The authors do not provide a means to differentiate the reasons
for avoidance, and consequently researchers are left with the same indicator of avoidance to
define both fear and disgust. One problem with using avoidance to define both fear and disgust
is that the topographical form of the avoidance is similar for both fear and disgust. For example,
if disgust motivates avoidance on a behavioral approach task (BAT), it will result in a low
score on the BAT. If fear motivates avoidance on a BAT, it will also result in a low BAT score.
Even if one emotion (e.g., fear) results in a lower BAT score than the other emotion (e.g.,
disgust), the fact that the scores are in the same metric leads to the possibility that disgust did
not really motivate avoidance; rather what was labeled ‘disgust’ was really a subdued fear
response. Given that the topographical features of avoidance for disgust and avoidance for fear
are apparently quite similar, the observation of avoidance cannot differentiate disgust from
fear. Avoidance, then, does not appear to be a useful means to examine the relative
contributions of disgust and fear.

Woody and Teachman (2000) state that “appraisals of a stimulus as potentially threatening or
dangerous is associated with a fear response… but disgust appraisals seem to focus more
specifically on the threat of contamination (p. 295). Appraisals/cognitive processes of disgust
and fear may be topographically distinct and appear to be useful in examining the relative
contributions of disgust and fear. Physiological systems also appear to offer a viable indicator
to differentiate fear and disgust. Woody and Teachman (2000) suggest that heart rate
acceleration characterizes fear, whereas heart rate deceleration characterizes disgust, indicating

that physiology can differentiate fear from disgust. The topography of heart rate response is
distinct for fear and disgust, which suggests that heart rate response is a useful indicator to
examine the relative contribution of disgust and fear.

Emotion theorists offer a perspective of identifying and measuring emotions that extends the
popular three systems model of fear (e.g., Lang, 1968, Lipp, 2006). Izard (1993; 1992) suggests
that basic emotions are characterized by unique neural substrates and expressive components.
Ekman (1992) argues that basic emotions can be differentiated based on the signal of the
emotion (e.g., facial expression) and physiology. Based on Ekman (1992), Izard (1993;
1992), and Woody and Teachman’s (2000) analyses, there are four response domains where
disgust and fear would be expected to produce specific response topographies: physiology,
neural substrate, facial expressions, and appraisals/cognitive processes. The following sections
review basic research on the distinctness of the topography of disgust and fear responses in the
domains of heart rate, neural substrate, facial expression, and appraisals/cognitive processes.
Again, the purpose of the review is to elucidate the expected response topographies if the
emotion is fear or disgust (e.g., what is the expected heart rate topography if the emotion is
disgust?).

Ekman and colleagues (1983) directed participants to contort their face into emotional
configurations (i.e., directed facial action task) or asked participants to relive particularly
salient emotional experiences in their past (i.e., relived emotions task). Regardless of task,
results revealed greater heart rate acceleration for fear compared to happiness, and heart rate
deceleration for disgust compared to all other emotions. The authors did not report if the
deceleration for disgust was significantly different from zero (i.e., disgust results in heart rate
deceleration compared to baseline and not just to other emotions). These results suggest that
a particular pattern of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity can differentiate fear from
disgust: fear results in heart rate acceleration relative to positive emotions; disgust results in
heart rate deceleration compared to positive emotions. The differentiation of fear and disgust
based on heart rate has since been replicated. For example, Levenson, Ekman, and Friesen
(1990) found that participants engaged in a directed facial action task or relived emotions task
displayed heart rate acceleration for fear, but “unchanged or small decelerations in heart rate
during disgust” (p. 380). Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, and Ekman (1991) found greater heart
rate acceleration among elderly adults during fear compared to disgust emotion-eliciting
activities, but disgust was not associated with a decrease in heart rate. The finding of heart rate
acceleration for fear is consistent with much research and theory1 (see e.g., Barlow, 2002;
Lang, 1968; Lipp, 2006), and as a result, the review will focus on the physiological correlates
of disgust.

The Ekman and colleagues (Ekman et al., 1983; Levenson et al., 1991; 1990) studies are limited
in that they reveal differential heart rate responding between fear and disgust only during two
emotion eliciting activities (see Boiten, 1996 for a critique of the directed facial action task).
Other research, however, has found heart rate deceleration towards ecologically valid stimuli.
Olatunji, Haidt, and McKay (in press) found that scores on a measure of the propensity to
respond with disgust were negatively correlated with heart rate responding during videos
depicting vomit or blood draws. Importantly, that a similar decrease was found across two
types of disgust stimuli suggests that the heart rate deceleration may be robust across types of

1One limitation to dissociating fear and disgust based on heart rate increase or decrease is that a heart rate increase is also indicative of
the behavioral activation system and subsequent active avoidance (Fowles, 1980; 1988). Similarly, heart rate decrease may be indicative
of the behavioral inhibition system and subsequent passive avoidance. Accordingly, whether fear or disgust is associated with a heart
rate increase or decrease may be dependent on whether the organism displays active versus passive defensive responses to the fear or
disgust stimuli.

disgust stimuli. Stark, Walter, Schienle, and Vaitl (2005) presented non-selected individuals
with neutral, disgusting, or mutilation pictures and found heart rate deceleration for the
disgusting and mutilation pictures compared to neutral pictures. Also, they found that the
deceleration of heart rate correlated positively with the subjective ratings of disgust for the
pictures. Thus, greater heart rate deceleration accompanies greater subjective experiences of
disgust. Klorman, Weissberg, and Wiesenfeld (1977) found greater heart rate deceleration
among females during mutilation slides compared to neutral slides. Klorman and Ryan
(1980), however, found that males did not differ in heart rate response to mutilation compared
to neutral slides. Hare, Wood, Britain, and Shadman (1971) found greater heart deceleration
among non-selected male individuals during pictures of homicide scenes compared to picture
of nude models or neutral scenes. Lang and colleagues (1993) found decreased heart rate
towards disgust compared to fear and neutral pictures among non-selected individuals. Finally,
Rohrmann and Hopp (2008) found decreased heart rate during an amputation film compared
to a neutral film.

The results of physiological studies examining heart rate suggests a robust heart rate
deceleration for disgust compared to fear, and a moderately consistent heart rate deceleration
for disgust compared to neutral stimuli with only two studies yielding no differences between
disgust and neutral (Klorman & Ryan, 1980; Levenson et al., 1991). The finding of slower
heart rate for disgust compared to neutral stimuli is important in that it suggests that the heart
rate component of the disgust response does not resemble a fear response of smaller magnitude.
Instead, the disgust response likely involves a decreased heart rate compared to neutral stimuli,
whereas fear involves an increase. The finding of heart rate deceleration for disgust has been
theorized to reflect parasympathetic activation (Page, 1994). Rohrmann and Hopp (2008) found
support for this assertion, but also found mild evidence for sympathetic activation during
disgust inductions. Future research is necessary to clarify the autonomic nervous processes
underlying disgust.

There have been two studies showing heart rate acceleration towards disgust stimuli compared
to neutral stimuli (Prkachin, Williams-Avery, Zwaal, & Mills, 1999; Vrana, 1993), but these
studies used guided imagery as opposed to pictorial stimulus presentation. According to
McKay and Tsao (2005), “the studies reporting increased sympathetic activation relied on
imagery, which may better address anticipatory reactions. In this case participants may label
the anticipatory reaction as anxiety, leading to sympathetic activation, while live exposure
more likely produces the diphasic reaction, with parasympathetic arousal then occurring as
well” (p. 356; italics added). The interpretation of heart rate acceleration towards particular
disgust stimuli explains the data in a manner that does not contradict the findings of heart rate
deceleration towards disgust stimuli. This differential pattern of heart rate suggests that if the
emotion of disgust is present, it could be expected that a heart rate deceleration would be
observed; if fear is present, it could be expected that heart acceleration would be observed.

Neural Correlates

Calder, Keane, Manes, Antoun, and Young (2000) reported data on a neurological patient with
a lesion largely specific to the insula. This individual had selective deficits in recognizing
disgust, but not other emotions (e.g., fear). Moreover, this individual’s deficits in recognizing
disgust extended across sensory modalities. The patient also scored low relative to controls on
an individual difference measure of the propensity to experience disgust. This case study
implicates the insula as a neurological substrate necessary for both disgust perception and
experience.

Neuroimaging techniques have also been employed to test the neural substrates underlying
disgust and fear. Phillips et al. (1997) presented individuals with pictures of fearful, disgusting,
or neutral faces. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed greater activation of

the amygdala for fear faces compared to neutral faces, and greater activation of the anterior
insula for disgust faces compared to neutral faces. The insular cortex is heterogeneous in
function (Augustine, 1996), thus it is important that Phillips and colleagues found activation
for disgust faces in a specific region of the insula (i.e., the anterior insula). Phillips and
colleagues also found that the amygdala did not respond to disgust faces, and the insula did
not respond to fear faces. Phillips and colleagues (1998) replicated these results in a subsequent
study. Williams and colleagues (2005) similarly presented individuals with fear and disgust
faces and found amygdala activation towards fear faces and insula activation towards disgust
faces. These results suggest a double dissociation between neural substrate and stimulus type,
which is consistent with the theory of basic emotions (Ekman, 1992; Izard, 1993; 1994), which
posit unique neural substrates for the basic emotions. Given that the function of disgust is
theorized to be avoidance of contamination (Rozin & Fallon, 1987), the finding that a neural
region associated with gustatory perception (i.e., the anterior insula) is activated by disgust
facial expressions strongly suggests that this region may be a critical neural substrate
underlying disgust (also see Calder, Lawrence, and Young, 2001). The finding of amygdala
activation in response to fear stimuli is consistent with a large body of data implicating the
amygdala in the fear response (Calder et al., 2001; LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; LeDoux, 2000;
Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Liberzon, 2004; 2002; Phelps & LeDoux, 2005).

The studies mentioned above (Phillips et al., 1998; 1997; Williams et al., 2005) are limited to
revealing specificity of the insula only for facial expressions as stimuli, which limits the degree
to which the results suggest that the insula is involved in experiencing disgust, as opposed to
merely being involved in recognizing disgust. However, the finding of anterior insula activation
specificity towards disgust facial expressions has been replicated using ecologically valid types
of disgust stimuli. Wright, He, Shapira, Goodman, and Liu (2004) compared neural activation
between contamination, mutilation, and fear-related pictorial stimuli among non-clinical
participants. Results revealed greater anterior insula activation for both contamination and
mutilation stimuli compared to neutral stimuli and the insula did not respond to fear pictures.
Adding further evidence, Fitzgerald and colleagues (2004) found that participants asked to
recall and re-experience recent disgusting situations exhibited insula activation but not
amygdala activation. These data further support the hypothesis that the insula is a specific
neural substrate for the experience of disgust and not just the perception of disgust faces.

The double dissociation hypothesis has not, however, been consistently supported. For
example, Schienle and colleagues (2002) found activation of the insula and the amygdala in
response to various disgusting stimuli (e.g., maggots, cadavers, dirty toilets, vomit). They also
found activation of the insula in response to fear stimuli. An important inconsistency across
studies investigating the neural regions underlying fear and disgust is that the region of the
insula under investigation is not reported in all studies. For example, Phillips et al. (1997) and
Wright et al. (2004) report specificity of the anterior insula for disgust, but some studies
revealing non-specificity of the insula do not report the region of the insula investigated
(Schienle et al., 2002; Shafer et al., 2005; Stark et al., 2004). These inconsistencies make their
results difficult to interpret. In fact, recent meta-analyses of positron emission tomography
(PET) and fMRI studies (Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, & Lawrence, 2003; Phan et al., 2004; 2002)
lend support to the double dissociation hypothesis. Although these studies found that both the
amygdala and insula can respond to either fear or disgust stimuli, a high percentage of studies
support specificity (e.g., disgust and the insula; fear and the amygdala) compared to the
percentage of studies suggesting non-specificity. Thus, there is a higher probability of
observing anterior insula activation in response to disgust stimuli compared to amygdala
activation (also see Cisler & Olatunji, in press for a recent review of neuroimaging studies of
disgust). Accordingly, anterior insula activation would be expected if the emotion was disgust,
and amygdala activation would be expected if the emotion was fear. One limitation of using
anterior insula activation as an indicator of disgust is that the anterior insula has also been

implicated in interoceptive processes (Critchley et al., 2004). Accordingly, disgust responding
would be expected to produce anterior insula activation, but generic interoceptive awareness
may also produce anterior insula activation. As with the other response domains, conclusions
based on neural activation must be made with caution.

Facial expression

Yartz and Hawk (2002) presented individuals with fear, disgust, positive, and neutral pictures
and found greater levator labii and corrugator muscle activation based on electromyogram
(EMG) recordings for disgust compared to all other picture types, and less corrugator muscle
activation for fear compared to all other muscle picture types. Vrana (1994; 1993) asked
individuals to imagine disgust, anger, or neutral scenarios and found that activation in the
levator labii was greater during disgust compared to anger and neutral imagery, and activation
in the corrugator was greater for disgust compared to neutral stimuli. Lang, Greenwald,
Bradley, and Hamm (1993) did not measure levator labii activation but found greater corrugator
muscle activation in response to disgust pictures compared to fear, but not neutral pictures.
Findings regarding specificity of the corrugator to disgust, however, are not consistent. Several
studies have found increased corrugator muscle activation in response to fear compared to
pleasant or neutral emotions (Sinha & Parson, 1996; Schwartz, Ahern, & Brown, 1979;
Dimberg, 1990; 1986, see Dimberg, 1990 for a review). Given that both fear and disgust are
associated with increased corrugator activation, the observation of increased corrugator
activation does not appear able to reliably differentiate fear from disgust.

More promising, however, is the levator labii. Only one study failed to find increased levator
labii activation for disgust (Wolf et al., 2005), compared to three studies (Vrana, 1994; 1993;
Yartz & Hawk, 2002) across different sensory modalities that did find increased levator labii
activation for disgust. Moreover, Yartz and Hawk found that fear stimuli did not result in levator
labii activation. The observation of levator labii activation in response to a stimulus, then,
seems to indicate the emotion of disgust and not fear. Consequently, it would be predicted that
if a stimulus elicits disgust, then levator labii muscle activation is likely to be observed.
Additionally, the levator labii is a muscle used in raising the upper lip, which is involved in
rejecting food from the mouth and consistent with the evolutionary function of disgust in
protecting from disease/contagion (Rozin & Fallon, 1987; Rozin et al., 2000).

Cognitive processes

There has been limited research on normative cognitive processes in disgust (Williams et al.,
in press). Moreover, there has been limited research comparing the cognitive processes of
disgust and fear. The limited research on cognitive processes in disgust is included in this
review in light of the importance of appraisals (Armfield, 2006; Teachman, 2006; Woody &
Teachman, 2000) and cognitive processes in general (Mathews & MacLeod, 2005) in
understanding disgust and fear. This section outlines the empirical evidence of possible
cognitive processes in disgust, and then describes existing theories that differentiate cognitive
processes of disgust and fear.

Rozin, Millman, and Nemeroff (1986) presented participants recruited from either a university
or the community with two glasses of different juices. A dead and sterilized cockroach was
then dropped into one of the glasses and then removed. Participants were notified that the
cockroach was sterilized and perfectly safe. Participants rated their desire of drinking the
‘roached’ juice significantly less after the ‘roaching.’ Similarly, Rozin, Markwith, and
McCauley (1994) found in a questionnaire study that college students were less willing to wear
a thoroughly laundered sweater after it had been worn by a man with AIDS compared to a man
without AIDS. These studies illustrates the law of contagion; that is, the disgust-related
appraisal that ‘once in contact, always in contact’ (Rozin & Fallon, 1987).

Rozin and colleagues (1986) presented participants with fudge shaped to resemble dog feces
and rubber fake vomit. Participants were less willing to eat the fudge shaped to resemble dog
feces relative to the same type of fudge shaped into a disc, and participants were less willing
to place the rubber fake vomit in their lips relative to a rubber stopper. This study illustrates
the law of similarity; that is, the disgust-related appraisal that the images resembling a noxious
object are also noxious (Rozin & Fallon, 1987).

Woody and Teachman (2000) suggest that disgust appraisals differ from fear appraisals in that
disgust appraisals center on the threat of contamination, whereas fear appraisals may be more
centered on broad estimations of danger. These authors’ reasoning derives from Rozin and
colleagues (Rozin et al., 1986; Rozin et al., 1994) research on the laws of contagion and
similarity. Teachman (2006) expanded on the disgust appraisal processes theorized in Woody
and Teachman (2000 and proposed an interesting analogy to Salkovskis’ (1996) discussion of
primary and secondary appraisals in OCD. Teachman theorized that primary appraisals in
disgust reflect beliefs about 1) disgusting properties of an object (e.g., ‘that spider is gross’),
or 2) the degree to which a situation or object will elicit disgust (e.g., ‘that spider will make
me feel disgusted’). Secondary appraisals in disgust reflect individuals’ beliefs about the
perceived consequences if the primary appraisals are true (e.g., ‘if I feel disgusted, I won’t be
able to cope or manage’). The important concept common to Teachman (2006) and Woody
and Teachman’s (2000) analyses that is relevant to the current review is that the primary
appraisals for disgust and fear are likely to be where differences emerge. That is, primary
appraisals of disgust (e.g., ‘that thing is gross,’ ‘that fly will contaminate my drink’) center on
attributes of the stimulus/situation that are topographically quite distinct from appraisals of
fear (e.g., ‘that snake is dangerous,’ ‘I might crash if I fly in a plane). Secondary appraisals of
disgust and fear may be similar and both revolve around individuals’ beliefs in whether they
can cope if their primary appraisals are true.

Research and theory on cognitive processes suggest three manners in which disgust and fear
differ: 1) disgust involves the law of contagion, 2) disgust involves the law of similarity, and
3) disgust primary appraisals involve beliefs about the object/situation as disgusting,
contaminating, or able to elicit the feeling of disgust. Fear appraisals, in contrast, center on
estimations of danger/harm.

However, appraisals do suffer from one limitation in regards to their specificity. Woody and
Teachman (2000) discuss what they refer to as the Imprecise Emotional Label model, in which
the link between fear and disgust is caused by the confusion of fear and disgust. Thus, even if
an individual appraises a stimulus as dangerous, the actual emotion eliciting the appraisal may
be disgust, but the individual merely confuses the emotion and uses the wrong linguistic
appraisal. Conversely, even if an individual appraises a stimulus as contaminating, the actual
emotion eliciting the appraisal may be fear, but the individual merely confuses the emotion
and uses the wrong linguistic appraisal. Similarly, verbally reported levels of disgust or fear
(i.e., subjective units of distress [SUDs] ratings for the emotion of disgust or fear) also have
been used to measure the cognitive system of disgust and fear in analogue-clinical populations
(Olatunji, Smits et al., 2007; Sawchuk et al., 2002; Smits et al., 2002). A SUDs rating of disgust
could be conceptualized as a primary appraisal of disgust2 (i.e., a SUDs rating measures
individuals’ beliefs that the object/situation has disgust eliciting properties). Research has
shown that SUDs ratings of disgust are highly correlated with SUDs ratings of fear (also see
Olatunji & Cisler, in press), with reported r values of .68 (Olatunji, Smits, et al., 2007), .83
(Sawchuk, Lohr, Westendorf, Meunier, & Tolin, 2002), .86 (Smits et al., 2002; BAT 2), .89

2An alternative conceptualization of SUDs ratings is simply as self-reported emotional experiences. SUDs ratings will be considered
appraisals in this paper in order to 1) be consistent with Teachman’s (2006) theory of appraisals in disgust, and 2) provide another indicator
of possible cognitive processes in disgust and fear.

Summary

(Olatunji & Deacon, 2008), and .90 (Smits et al., 2002; BAT 1). Consequently, the observation
of elevated SUD ratings for one emotion could actually be due to causally prior elevations of
the other emotion. Although appraisals and SUDs of disgust and fear are topographically
distinct and therefore useful in examining the relative contributions of disgust and fear, there
appear to be slight problems with specificity. Accordingly, appraisals and SUDs will be used
in the current review, but conclusions must be tempered by these limitations.

There appear to be four response domains in which the specific topographies for disgust and
fear are expected to differ. If the stimulus elicits disgust, if follows that heart rate deceleration,
anterior insula activation, levator labii activation, and appraisals centering on disgusting
properties or transmission of contagion will be observed. Importantly, these response
topographies generally converge well with the theorized evolutionary function of disgust -
avoidance/rejection of contagions. That is, the levator labii is a muscle involved in rejecting
food from the mouth, the anterior insula is involved in gustatory processes (Calder et al.,
2001), and implausible beliefs about the transmission of contagion (e.g., ‘once in contact
always contaminated’) and appraisals of objects as disgusting all appear related to the similar
function of avoiding harmful disease or contagion carrying substances. It is difficult to explain
why disgust would be associated with a decrease in heart rate. Analogously, Page (1994)
suggested that the fainting response in BII phobia may actually not have an evolutionary
advantage. It may also be the case that a heart rate deceleration is a correlate of disgust and not
functionally involved in achieving the evolutionary purpose of disgust. Alternatively, Stark
and colleagues (2005) suggested that decreased heart rate in disgust may be intertwined with
increased attention towards disgust stimuli, given that increased attention is also associated
with heart rate decrease. Future research and theory on this issue is needed.

The review suggests that if the stimulus elicits fear, it follows that heart rate acceleration,
amygdala activation, and appraisals centering on danger will be observed. These response
topographies also converge well with the theorized evolutionary function of fear - avoiding/
escaping danger (e.g., Öhman & Mineka, 2001). Note, however, that there may not be a specific
facial expression indicator for fear (Kring & Bachorowski, 1999). Given that the reliability of
any one measure is questionable (e.g., Klorman & Ryan, 1980; Levenson et al., 1991; Schienle
et al., 2002; Wolf et al., 2005; Woody & Teachman, 2000), future research investigating
whether disgust operates in anxiety disorders should include multiple indicators (e.g., heart
rate and facial muscle tension) in order to most accurately account for the presence and absence
of both emotions.

A Critical Review of Disgust-Related Anxiety Research

The previous sections identified specific indicators of disgust and fear across four response
systems. The following sections review extant research employing these specific measures
among spider phobia, BII phobia, and contamination-related OCD. The review is limited to
studies using these emotion indicators to examine emotional responding towards disorder-
relevant stimuli. This limitation is to keep the review focused on examining the relative
magnitude to which disgust and fear characterize the emotional response in these disorders. A
summary of the review is provided in Table 1.

Spider Phobia

Facial Expression—de Jong, Peters, and Vanderhallen (2002) assessed facial muscle
activation during spider-related guided imagery and disgust-related imagery among spider
fearful and control women. Results revealed greater levator labii muscle activation during both
disgust and spider-related guided imagery compared to another muscle region, and importantly,

the spider phobic group displayed greater levator labii muscle tension during spider-related
imagery compared to the control group. Vernon and Berenbaum (2002) measured facial
expression during BAT towards a live tarantula through coding videotapes of participants’
reactions during the BAT. Spider fearful individuals exhibited greater disgust (e.g., raised
upper lip, which indicates levator labii muscle activation) and fear (e.g., brow raised, lips tense)
facial expressions compared to non-fearful individuals. There were no differences in the
frequency of disgust and fear facial expressions.

Heart Rate—Hare (1973) found that subclinical spider fearful participants displayed heart
rate acceleration towards spider-related pictures but not towards neutral stimuli, and also that
a control group did not display heart rate acceleration towards spider-related pictures. This
finding of heart rate acceleration among spider fearful individuals has been replicated
(Fredrikson, Wik, Annas, & Ericson, 1995; Sarlo, Palomba, Angrilli, & Stegagno, 2002; see
Table 1). Sarlo and colleagues (2002) observed an initial heart rate increase followed by a
statistically significant decrease among spider phobics during viewing of a spider film. This
pattern is notably similar to the diphasic heart rate response in BII phobia (see section BII
phobia below), which has been theorized to reflect parasympathetic activity and the emotion
of disgust (Page, 1994). Importantly, Sarlo and colleagues found that sustained sympathetic
activity predicted the heart rate response across time in spider phobics, but the relation between
sympathetic activity and heart rate response among BII phobics became weaker across time
and during the second phase heart rate decline. Thus, the heart rate pattern among spider
phobics in this study appears to reflect sympathetic activity, and consequently fear, as opposed
to parasympathetic activity and disgust.

Neural Substrate—Several studies have examined neural responses to disorder relevant
stimuli in spider phobia (see Table 1). Goossens and colleagues (in press) found greater
amygdala activation towards spider stimuli compared to a control group, but this difference
disappeared after exposure therapy. However, the results also demonstrated greater insula
cortex activation compared to control participants pre-treatment and this difference also
disappeared after treatment. These results suggest that fear and disgust may characterize spider
phobia. Straube, Mentzel, and Miltner (2006) found that spider phobics display amygdala
and insula activation when attending to spider pictures, but only amygdala activation when the
spider pictures are present but not part of the primary experimental task. The finding of
amygdala activation when the spider was not part of the primary task suggests automaticity,
such that conscious control and effort were not necessary (Moors & de Houwer, 2006). That
fear appeared to be automatic whereas disgust did not suggests that the fear response may come
first, which is later followed by disgust. Automaticity of only the fear response also
demonstrates the comparative ease with which spiders elicit fear relative to disgust. However,
these interpretations must be tempered by the fact that they are based on one isolated study.
Larson and colleagues (2006) found that immediate amygdala activation in response to spider
stimuli differentiated between spider phobics and control participants, which further suggests
a key role of the amygdala, and fear, in spider phobia. Overall, neuroimaging studies suggest
that both fear and disgust are present in spider phobia, but that the fear response may be
automatic, whereas the disgust response may not. One limitation to these studies is that they
did not document that insula cortex activation was specific to the anterior insula, thus it is
difficult to discern what function of the insula the significant activation actually indicates.

Cognitive Processes—A few studies demonstrate that individuals with spider phobia
exhibit the ‘law of contagion’ appraisal towards spiders. Mulkens, de Jong and Merckelbach
(1996) found that women with spider phobia were significantly less likely to eat a cookie after
a spider had walked across it compared to women without spider phobia. Importantly, the two
groups did not differ in their likelihood of drinking a contaminated cup of tea, suggesting that

there were no differences between the groups in general sensitivity to dirtiness. This study
illustrates that spider phobia may be characterized by appraisals of disgust, specifically the law
of contagion (i.e., ‘once in contact, always in contact’). Other studies have since replicated this
law of contagion effect in spider phobia (de Jong and Muris, 2002; Woody, McLean, & Klassen,
2005). One limitation of these studies is that they do not offer an appropriate comparison for
fear-related cognitive processes, thus the relative contributions of disgust and fear cannot be
compared.

Some studies have used experimental tasks (Implicit Association Tasks [IAT], expectancy bias
paradigm) that assess whether spider phobic individuals associate spiders with disgust-related
stimuli or fear-related stimuli. These experimental designs provide some evidence of whether
the cognitive processes in spider phobia involve disgust and/or fear. For example, associating
spiders with disgust outcomes provides evidence, albeit indirectly, that spiders are appraised
as disgusting. Importantly, these studies assess associations/expectancies for both fear and
disgust related stimuli, thus allowing an estimate of the relative contributions of fear and
disgust. Teachman, Gregg, and Woody (2001) used an IAT with pictures of spiders as the target
stimuli and disgust attributes (e.g., gross) and fear attributes (e.g., harm) as separate categories.
Results revealed that spider fearful individuals associated spiders with both disgust and fear
attributes to a greater degree than an anxious control group. Huijding and de Jong (2007)
employed an IAT with pictures of spiders as the target stimuli and disgust attributes (e.g.,
‘dirty’) and fear attributes (e.g., ‘attacking’) as separate categories. Results revealed that
individuals with spider phobia associated spiders with both fear and disgust attributes to a
greater degree than did non-phobic individuals. The magnitude of disgust associations did not
appear to differ from the magnitude of fear associations. van Overveld, de Jong, and Peters
(2006) asked participants to rate whether they expected pictures of spiders, maggots, dogs, and
rabbits to be followed by disgust outcomes (i.e., drinking a distasteful fluid), fear outcomes
(i.e., an electric shock), or no outcome. The authors found that high spider fearful individuals
expected both disgust and fear outcomes to follow spiders to a greater degree than low spider
fearful individuals. There was no difference between the magnitude of expectancies for disgust
or fear outcomes. However, expectancies of disgust outcomes following spiders significantly
predicted self-reported spider fear, but fear-expectancies did not. Using a similar methodology,
de Jong and Peters (2007a) found that spider fearful individuals expected a disgust outcome
to follow spider pictures, but did not expect a fear outcome to follow spider pictures.

Some studies have also asked participants to rate how disgusted and frightened they feel during
exposure to spiders/spider-related stimuli. These types of assessments provide some evidence
of the types of primary appraisals individuals make about spiders and their responses towards
spiders. Olatunji and Deacon (2008) engaged spider fearful and nonfearful individuals in a
BAT task towards a realistic looking, but fake, tarantula. Spider fearful individuals self-
reported significantly more fear and disgust compared to non-fearful individuals. Spider fearful
individuals reported more fear than disgust, but it was not reported whether this difference was
significant. Vernon and Berenbaum (2002) also found greater self-reported fear and disgust
during a BAT towards a live spider, but there was a trend for greater self-reported disgust
compared to self-reported fear. Sawchuk and colleagues (2002) presented spider fearful and
nonfearful individuals with spider pictures, measured self-reported fear and disgust, and found
greater fear and disgust in the spider fearful compared to non-fearful individuals. Spider fearful
individuals also exhibited greater self-reported fear relative to disgust. Tolin and colleagues
(1997) used a similar methodology and found that spider fearful participants again rated more
fear and disgust towards spider pictures relative to non-fearful individuals, but there were no
differences in self-reported ratings between fear and disgust towards spiders. Finally, Thorpe
and Salkovskis (1998) also found that individuals with spider phobia rated pictures of spiders
as more disgusting and frightening compared to non-phobic individuals; differences between
fear and disgust ratings were not reported.

Summary: Facial expression data indicate both fear and disgust, but there is more consistent
evidence for a disgust facial expression. Cognitive measures generally implicate both disgust
and fear, with a slight trend favoring disgust among the IAT/expectancy bias studies. In
contrast, heart rate studies and neuroimaging studies generally suggest a dominant role for fear
and a less robust role for disgust. Moreover, one fMRI study (Straube et al., 2006) suggests
automaticity of the fear response, but not the disgust response. The limitation that no studies
have revealed specific activation of the anterior region of the insular cortex further weakens
the neuroimaging evidence for the role of disgust in the emotional response in spider phobia.
As such, the evidence suggests that the degree to which the emotional response reflects fear
or disgust may depend on the response domain measured. One possible theory explaining the
dissociation between emotion observed and response domain measured is that spiders may
initially elicit fear in physiological domains (e.g., neural substrate, heart rate), whereas disgust
may emerge later during more controlled processes (i.e., appraisals, facial expression). Thus,
it would be predicted that amygdala and heart rate acceleration may be observed towards
masked (i.e., not-consciously recognized) spider-stimuli, but a disgust facial expression or
evidence of the law of contagion would only be expected to be observed towards consciously
recognized spider stimuli. This dissociation may occur in order to motivate 1) immediate escape
from spiders given that some may be dangerous, and 2) avoid future contact with objects in
close proximity to spiders given the possibility for contagion transmission (e.g., Matchett &
Davey, 1991). Indeed, this would explain why fear may be automatically elicited from spiders
(i.e., to quickly avoid/escape) and disgust may occur in more controlled domains (i.e.,
appraisals of disgust and contamination may motivate passive avoidance of objects touched
by spiders). Future research concurrently measuring all response domains is necessary to
further explore how disgust and fear differentially emerge across the response systems. Finally,
the observation that physiological measures indicate fear whereas more controlled processes
indicate disgust suggests that both emotions may need to be targeted during treatment, but
possibly through distinct techniques (e.g., exposure for fear, re-appraisal for disgust).

Facial Expression—Lumley and Melamed (1992) videotaped BII phobic and non-phobic
individuals’ facial expressions while viewing surgery film clips and neutral film clips. The
facial expressions were rated by observers on whether the participants furrowed their eyebrows
or raised their upper lip; rising of the upper lip indicates levator labii muscle activation. Results
revealed that BII phobic individuals displayed more facial expressions of disgust compared to
non-phobic individuals during the surgery films. These results suggest that BII phobic
individuals respond with the emotion of disgust during exposure to disorder-relevant stimuli.

Some research has investigated facial expression in BII phobia towards disgusting stimuli
(Schienle et al., 2005) and to neutral stimuli paired with disgusting stimuli (Schienle et al.,
2001). However, these studies do not demonstrate which type of facial expression BII phobics
display towards disorder-relevant stimuli. Thus, these studies are not appropriate to test
whether BII individuals respond predominantly with fear or disgust.

Heart Rate—One of the most promising pieces of evidence for disgust in BII phobia is the
unique heart rate response to phobic-related stimuli. The heart rate response to phobogenic
stimuli in BII is characterized by a diphasic response (Page, 1994; Sarlo et al., 2002; Thyer,
Himle, & Curtis, 1985), in which there is a rapid acceleration of heart rate followed by a sharp
decrease in heart rate. This heart rate response is specific to disorder-relevant stimuli; BII
phobic individuals do not display a diphasic response while experiencing generic stress
(Dahllof & Öst, 1998). The latter half of the diphasic reaction seems responsible for the fainting
response that sometimes occurs with BII phobia (Öst, Sterner, & Lindahl, 1984; see Page,
1994 for a detailed discussion). For example, Öst and colleagues (Dahllof & Öst, 1998; Öst et

al., 1984; see Table 1) presented BII phobics with surgery films and found an initial increase
in heart rate, followed by a rapid decline in heart rate. Similarly, Sarlo and colleagues (2002)
presented BII phobics with surgery films and also found an initial heart rate increase followed
by a decrease. Sarlo and colleagues found that sympathetic activation predicted the initial heart
rate increase, but the influence of sympathetic activation became weaker over time. This
suggests that the latter heart rate decrease is mediated by parasympathetic activation and
disgust. Page (1994) argues that the unique heart rate response in BII phobia is mediated by
parasympathetic activity and suggests that the diphasic heart rate response in BII phobia reflects
disgust. However, even if the latter heart rate decrease is mediated by disgust and
parasympathetic activity, the initial heart rate increase is likely mediated by sympathetic
activity (Page, 1994; Sarlo et al., 2002), thus implicating fear. As such, the diphasic heart rate
response towards disorder-relevant stimuli in BII phobia may reflect both fear and disgust.

The diphasic heart rate response has not, however, been consistently demonstrated in BII
phobia. Ritz and colleagues (2005) found that only 2 of 12 BII phobics demonstrated the
diphasic heart rate response during viewing of surgery films, although they failed to find a
significant diphasic response among their entire BII phobia sample. It is important to note that
Ritz and colleagues’ null results may be due to their strict definition of diphasic responding;
they defined a diphasic response as an increase in heart rate towards the BII film compared to
a generally unpleasant film and a subsequent decrease in heart rate towards the BII film
compared to a neutral film. These strict criteria may have minimized false positives but
consequently also maximized false negatives. Similarly, Gerlach and colleagues (2006)
observed a rapid heart rate increase among BII phobics during an actual venopuncture but did
not observe a subsequent heart rate deceleration. A difference between this study and studies
documenting a diphasic response is the type of stimulus used. In previous studies the stimulus
was a surgery film, but in the Gerlach study it was a venopuncture. It may be the case that
venopuncture stimuli are weaker elicitors of the diphasic response.

The diphasic response may be specific to a subset of BII phobics. Vogele and colleagues (2003)
found a rapid increase in heart rate, followed by a decrease in heart rate, during viewing of a
surgery video only among BII phobics with a history of fainting. BII phobics without a history
of fainting did not display this diphasic heart rate response. A history of fainting may explain
previous null findings of the diphasic response, such that previous studies may have used
samples with mostly non-fainters. These latter results also suggest that the diphasic response
may not be intrinsic to BII phobia per se, but rather only to the fainting response. If this were
true, it would call into question whether disgust is only relevant in BII phobics with a history
of fainting. Further investigation of response specificity and the consistent role of disgust is
needed.

Neural Substrate—Only one study presented BII phobic individuals with disorder relevant
study and examined neural substrate activation (see Table 1). Hermann, Schafer, Walter, Stark,
and Schienle (2007) found that BII phobic individuals display diminished medial prefrontal
cortex activity in response to disorder relevant pictures compared to the control group. They
did not find evidence of insula activation towards disorder-relevant pictures, but found
marginally significantly greater activation of the amygdala towards disorder-relevant
compared to neutral pictures. The medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the down-
regulation of emotional processing (Bishop, in press;Phelps & LeDoux, 2005), thus suggesting
that BII phobia may be characterized by a generalized diminished ability to regulate negative
emotions elicited from BII-relevant stimuli. As such, diminished medial prefrontal cortex
activity could be consistent with either fear, disgust, or both underlying BII phobia.

Cognitive Processes—There are no studies testing whether individuals with BII phobia
display appraisals related to the laws of contagion or similarity towards disorder-relevant

objects. There have been some studies investigating primary appraisals (i.e., self-reported fear
and disgust) towards disorder-relevant materials. Sawchuk and colleagues (2002) presented
participants with surgery pictures and found that BII fearful individuals self-reported more fear
and disgust relative to non-fearful individuals. BII fearful individuals’ self-reported disgust
was greater than their self-reported fear. Tolin and colleagues (1997) similarly found that BII
fearful individuals self-reported greater fear and disgust towards surgery pictures compared to
non-fearful individuals. Again, self-reported disgust was greater than self-reported fear.

There has been one study examining the associations between BII-related stimuli and disgust
versus fear-related stimuli. de Jong and Peters (2007b) presented BII phobic individuals and
non-phobic individuals with pictures of either neutral stimuli (e.g., rabbits) or disgust stimuli
(e.g., pictures of blood-donations). Presentation of these pictures was followed by one of three
possible outcomes: a shock, drinking a disgusting fluid, and nothing. Results revealed that both
high and low phobic individuals expected both a fear and disgust-related outcome with equal
probability. There were no differences between groups.

Summary: One facial expression study demonstrates disgust and not fear. Heart rate data
appear to suggest both disgust and fear. It is important to note that the response pattern of the
diphasic heart rate response in BII phobia begins with an increase (i.e., fear), which is followed
by a decrease (i.e., disgust). An alternative interpretation of the heart rate data in BII phobia is
that the initial heart rate activation indicates anxiety about a pending disgust response (McKay
& Tsao, 2005). Indeed, Lumley and Melamed (1992) argue that “what may be feared [in BII
phobia] is the highly uncomfortable feelings of nausea or faintness…” (pg. 433). When viewed
in this light, the primary emotional response is disgust and the initial heart rate activation is
merely anticipatory anxiety about the imminent disgust response. The evidence from both
facial expression and heart rate data then appear to suggest a dominant role of disgust. Appraisal
data suggests both disgust and fear in the emotional response of BII phobia, but two studies
(Sawchuk et al., 2002; Tolin et al., 1997) found that the disgust appraisals were greater than
the fear appraisals. Thus, data from facial expressions, heart rate, and appraisals all converge
in suggesting a dominant role of disgust and a minimal role of fear. One fMRI study failed to
corroborate a role for either disgust or fear in BII phobia. In contrast to spider phobia, there is
evidence for a role of disgust in BII phobia across all response systems except for neural
substrate, but this conclusion must be tempered by the limited number of studies. One
theoretically interesting line of inquiry could be in investigating Lumley and Melamed’s
(1992) assertion that what is feared in BII phobia is responding with disgust. This assertion is
consistent with the current findings that fear may emerge in more controlled processes such as
appraisals. It may be the case that the fear arises due to appraisals stating that feeling disgusted
is bad/uncomfortable; as opposed to fear arising in response to the BII stimulus per se. Future
research is necessary to test possible interactions between fear and disgust in BII phobia.

Contamination-related OCD

Facial Expression—No studies have examined facial muscle activity in contamination fear.

Heart Rate—Only one study has investigated heart rate response in contamination fear.
Hornsveld, Kraaimaat, and Van Dam-Baggen (1979) presented high contamination fear
individuals and psychiatric controls with in vivo ideographic stimuli selected to be ‘dirty.’ The
authors did not report examples of stimuli used. They found that the anticipation of touching
a dirty stimulus resulted in greater heart rate acceleration compared to baseline among
contamination fearful but not control participants. During actual touching of the stimuli, neither
group exhibited a change in heart rate compared to baseline. These results are difficult to
interpret. On one hand, the contamination fearful individuals displayed a heart rate increase
while anticipating dirty stimuli, thus suggesting a fear response. On the other hand, this

anticipatory response could be deemed anxiety about an impending threatening situation (see
McKay & Tsao, 2005 for a similar discussion pertaining to disgust, heart rate, and anticipation).
Additionally, if contamination fearful individuals respond with fear towards phobogenic
stimuli, then it follows that a heart rate increase compared to baseline would be observed when
touching the phobogenic stimuli. The results did not support this hypothesis. Thus, the results
do not strongly suggest fear or disgust. It is difficult to discern what these results say in regards
to the questions underlying this review.

Neural Substrate—Several studies have investigated the neural substrates underlying
contamination fear (see Table 1). Some studies suggest that disgust may be the predominant
emotional response. For example, Phillips and colleagues (2000) presented individuals with
contamination fears with disorder-relevant pictures and found heightened insula, but not
amygdala activation. Similarly, Shapira and colleagues (2003) found heightened insula and
not amygdala activation towards generally disgusting pictures among a contamination fear
sample.

Some studies suggest that both fear and disgust may underlie contamination fears. Schienle,
Schafer, Stark, Walter, and Vaitl (2005) used a heterogeneous OCD sample (i.e., not ‘pure’
contamination fear OCD) and found enhanced insula activation while viewing disorder relevant
pictures, but amygdala activation towards these pictures correlated positively with a self-report
measure of contamination fear as well as with the experience of disgust. Maitaix-Cols and
colleagues (2004), however, used a heterogeneous OCD sample and found enhanced amygdala
activation during a contamination fear provocation task, but that insula activation correlated
with a self-report measure of contamination fear. Similarly, Breiter and colleagues (1996)
found both insula and amygdala activation in response to contaminated objects among
contamination fearful individuals. Finally, two studies found neither insula nor amygdala
activation towards disorder-relevant objects (McGuire et al., 1994; Rauch et al., 1994), and
one study found only amygdala, and not insula, activation towards disorder-relevant pictures
(van den Heuvel et al., 2004). Thus, neuroimaging studies of contamination fear generally
indicate both disgust and fear, but may indicate a more consistent and dominant role of disgust
(see Table 1). However, inconsistent findings limit the degree of confidence placed in this
conclusion.

Cognitive Processes—One study has investigated the law of contagion appraisal in
contamination-related OCD. Tolin, Worhunsky, and Maltby (2004) asked individuals with
contamination-related OCD, other anxiety disorders, and non-anxious controls to identify the
most contaminated object in the building. The experimenter then rubbed a new pencil on the
object and asked participants how contaminated the pencil was. The experimenter then rubbed
another new pencil on the previous pencil and again asked how contaminated this new pencil
was. This process was repeated for 12 pencils. Results revealed that the anxious and non-
anxious controls evidenced nearly a 100% decrease in appraisals of contamination across the
12 pencils, but the contamination-related OCD group displayed only a 40% reduction. The
groups performed the same task on a non-threat object (i.e., a piece of candy) and all groups
demonstrated nearly a 100% reduction in ‘candy contagion’ across the pencils. Thus,
individuals with contamination-related OCD exhibit the law of contagion appraisal uniquely
towards possible sources of contamination.

Connolly and colleagues (in press) used a covariation paradigm (i.e., a task in which the
perceived covariation between a CS and different types of UCS’s is measured) and found that
individuals with elevated contamination fear overestimated the pairings of contamination-
related pictures (e.g., vomit, dog feces) with pictures of fear facial expressions and disgust
facial expressions to a greater degree than with neutral facial expressions. There were no
differences in the estimations of pairings between fear facial expressions and disgust facial

expressions. Additionally, individuals with elevated contamination fear exhibited greater
estimations of pairings between the contamination pictures and the fear facial expressions
compared to individuals with low contamination fear, but the two groups did not differ in
associations between contamination pictures and disgust facial expressions.

Finally, Cougle and colleagues (2007) investigated primary threat appraisals of participants
with elevated contamination fear on a self-report questionnaire. They found that 41% of their
sample (N = 27) endorsed a primary contamination threat of being overwhelmed by feelings
of disgust and that 37% of the sample endorsed a primary threat of being concerned with illness
or harm to the self. These data suggest that contamination fearful individuals appraise
contamination-related situations as disgust eliciting (i.e., a disgust primary appraisal) and
dangerous (i.e., a fear primary appraisal). The degree to which these primary threat appraisals
covaried was not reported.

Summary: No studies have examined facial expression in contamination-related OCD. One
heart rate study (Hornsveld et al., 1979) suggests the emotion of disgust, but data from this
study are difficult to interpret. Contamination-related OCD is generally associated with anterior
insula activation towards disorder-relevant stimuli, although this effect is not always consistent.
Contamination-related OCD strongly demonstrates the law of contagion appraisal (Tolin et al.,
2004), but two other studies suggest appraisals of both disgust and fear. It is difficult to draw
conclusions from such a limited number of studies, but the data overall suggest a dominant
role of disgust. Moreover, the data more strongly indicate disgust across the response systems
that have been more thoroughly investigated (i.e., appraisals, neural substrate). These data on
contamination-related OCD is in contrast to Rachman’s (2006; 2004) assertion that
contamination-related OCD is predominantly fear based, and not disgust based. Instead, the
current data largely implicate disgust and minimally implicate fear. As with BII phobia, it may
be the case that the fear component involved in contamination-related OCD is best
conceptualized as fear or discomfort experiencing disgust (e.g., Cisler et al., 2007; Cougle et
al., 2007). Alternatively, the fear could be associated with a fear of contracting an illness
(Cougle et al., 2007), which is also actually consistent with the evolutionary function of disgust
(i.e., motivating avoidance of disease/contagions). However, conclusions based on the current
review are limited to a few neuroimaging and appraisal studies. Further research across
indicators is necessary to corroborate the evidence from these response systems.

General Summary

The review of specific measures of disgust and fear in spider phobia, BII phobia, and
contamination-related OCD largely suggests that both fear and disgust are involved in the
emotional response towards disorder-relevant stimuli in these disorders. Indeed, Table 1
demonstrates that many studies found evidence for both fear and disgust in each of the disorders
across many of the response domains. These data provide strong support for the growing
program of research on disgust in anxiety disorders. However, the relative contribution of
disgust and fear appears to differ across the disorders. Spider phobia may be characterized by
a fear response in more automatic response domains (e.g., neural activation) and a disgust
response in more controlled response domains (e.g., facial expression). BII phobia appears to
be characterized most strongly by a disgust response, but cognitive processes may indicate
both disgust and fear. Contamination-related OCD appears to be characterized most strongly
by a disgust response and the inconsistent evidence for fear may indicate a weaker role of fear
in this disorder. The role of disgust and fear may differ in these disorders because of the nature
of the disorder-stimuli. That is, spiders are moving objects in the environment. Accordingly,
it may be adaptive to quickly increase physical distance away from the spider, thus necessitating
a fear response and rapid physiological mobilization. Disgust may be involved in order to
motivate passive avoidance of stimuli that has come in contact with spiders. For BII phobia

and contamination-related OCD, however, the stimuli are relatively static. The potential for
harm from these stimuli may be more related to disease or contagion possibility; thus, rapidly
increasing the physical proximity from these stimuli may not be necessary. Instead, it may only
be necessary to prevent physical contact with these stimuli, thus necessitating a disgust
response. Fear may be involved due to discomfort experiencing the aversive sensations of
disgust. This line of reasoning would explain why the role of disgust and fear in the different
response domains may differ across the disorders.

A recurring theme in this section is the limited number of studies employing specific measures
of disgust and fear in spider phobia, BII phobia, or contamination-related OCD samples. It is
difficult to place confidence in conclusions drawn from such a limited number of studies. The
current review also highlights another problem in establishing an integral role of disgust in
anxiety. Some of the research described above suggests that the emotion observed may be
dependent on the response domain measured. It is difficult to explain why this may be the case.
As noted above, it may be that this pattern indicates that fear or disgust may emerge in automatic
or controlled response domains, depending on the disorder. Even if this were true, it is difficult
to discern what this means about the role of disgust or fear in these disorders. For example, if
disgust only emerges in controlled processes in spider phobia, does that mean that disgust is
less important or dominant than fear? This is not necessarily so and it could also be the case
that the more controlled processes and disgust are better predictors of avoidance (e.g., Woody
et al., 2005; Olatunji, Cisler, et al., 2008). Future research should compare the ability of fear
and disgust in each of the response domains to predict avoidance and distress during exposure.
Research along this line would assist in developing theories about how disgust is functionally
relevant in these disorders.

Future directions

Concurrent use of emotion indicators

Research may benefit from concurrent use of the available specific measures in order to provide
a multimodal assessment of emotional responding. Research along this line would be able to
additionally examine convergence across indicators. For example, if the diphasic heart rate
response in BII phobia correlates with insula activation, then this would strongly indicate
disgust in BII phobia. Similarly, concurrent use of emotion indicators could also be used to
compare the ability of each of the indicators to predict in vivo emotional responding (e.g.,
distress, avoidance). Research along this line could determine which emotion in which response
system is most related to emotional responding in these disorders.

In a related vein, there is a general lack of research investigating heart rate, facial expression,
and neural substrate across the disorders. Similarly, there are few studies examining appraisals
in contamination-related OCD. Future research should employ these measures in more studies,
preferably concurrently.

Investigate whether fear and disgust across response domains respond to similar types of
interventions

Exposure is widely recognized as the treatment of choice for specific phobia (Barlow et al.,
2002; Choy et al., 2007), and exposure and response prevention is also recommended as a first
choice treatment for OCD. However, recent research has shown that disgust responding may
be slower to extinguish during exposure relative to fear (Smits et al., 2002; Olatunji, Forsyth,
et al., 2007; Olatunji, Smits, et al., 2007; Olatunji, Wolitzky-Taylor, et al., in press). The
response domain measured in these studies was almost exclusively self-reported feelings of
disgust. Future research is necessary to examine whether other response domains of disgust
are similarly resistant to extinction via exposure. It may be the case that cognitive re-appraisal

of disorder-relevant stimuli would effectively reduce self-reported feelings of disgust towards
disorder-relevant stimuli and potentiating the efficacy of exposure-based treatments. In any
case, the finding that the magnitude to which disgust and fear characterize the emotional
response may depend on the response domain measured necessitates research on whether the
different emotions and different response domains respond the same to similar treatments. This
line of research would begin to incorporate disgust into treatment conceptualizations of the
disgust-related anxiety disorders.

Conclusions

Research demonstrates that disgust is involved in spider phobia, BII phobia, and
contamination-related OCD. The current review sought to examine the relative contributions
of disgust and fear to the emotional response in these disorders. The review elucidated the
response topographies specific to fear and disgust in the domains of heart rate, facial expression,
neural substrate, and cognitive processes. Extant research employing these specific measures
suggests that spider phobia is predominantly characterized by fear in more automatic response
domains, whereas disgust may emerge during more controlled processes. BII phobia and
contamination-related OCD appear to be predominantly characterized by disgust across
response systems, while fear also emerges in more controlled response systems. An
overarching finding from the review is the need for more research using specific measures,
preferably employing concurrent use of these measures. Additionally, given that fear and
disgust are both implicated in these disorders, researchers need to test whether therapeutic
procedures differentially affect fear versus disgust response domains.
