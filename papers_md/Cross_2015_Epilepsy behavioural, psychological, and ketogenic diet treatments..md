ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetime, but about 70% of people with epilepsy eventually
go into remission. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical questions:
What are the effects of behavioural and psychological treatments in people with epilepsy? What are the effects of ketogenic diets in people
with epilepsy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2014 (BMJ Clinical Evidence
overviews  are  updated  periodically;  please  check  our  website  for  the  most  up-to-date  version). RESULTS:  Searching  of  electronic
databases retrieved 259 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 253 records were screened for inclusion in the
overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 208 studies and the further review of 45 full publications. Of the 45 full articles
evaluated, six systematic reviews and seven RCTs were included at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for six PICO combinations.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic overview we categorised the efficacy for seven interventions, based on information relating to the effec-
tiveness and safety of: biofeedback, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), educational programmes, family counselling, ketogenic diet, relaxation
therapy (alone or plus behavioural modification therapy), and yoga.

Key points

• During their lifetime, about 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy. First-line treatment in the majority is anti-
convulsant medication; about 70% of people with epilepsy respond to medication, or in the longer-term go into
spontaneous remission.

• Alternative treatments for epilepsy are sought where medication fails and surgery is not an option.

• We searched for good-quality RCTs on the effects of selected interventions.

We found few studies, many of which were small or short-term, and most of which were methodically weak.

There is a need for further high-quality trials in this field reporting longer-term outcomes.

However, the difficulties of undertaking trials, particularly in people with refractory epilepsy, should not be under-
estimated.

• Educational programmes may improve some psychosocial functioning outcomes compared with control.

• We found insufficient evidence to draw robust conclusions on the effects of CBT or of relaxation plus behavioural

modification therapy.

• We found no RCTs of sufficient quality on the effects of relaxation therapy, yoga, biofeedback (electroencephalo-

graphic or galvanic skin response), or family counselling.

• We found evidence from two RCTs that a ketogenic diet or a modified-Atkins diet may improve seizure frequency
compared with control in children aged 2 to 16 years who had tried at least two anticonvulsants and had at least
daily seizures.

A ketogenic diet may be associated with gastrointestinal (constipation, hunger, vomiting, etc.) and other adverse
effects, so continued monitoring is required.

There may also be issues of tolerability and family acceptance.

Clinical context

GENERAL BACKGROUND
Increasingly, alternative therapies are being advocated in the treatment of epilepsy as complementary to medication.
Furthermore, there is increasing interest in the use of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of epilepsy, particularly if
the person is drug-resistant. The therapy is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, designed to mimic the metabolic effects
of starvation, that has been used in the treatment of epilepsy for almost 100 years.This, however, cannot be considered
as a natural treatment as it may have side effects, as with any medication, and requires careful monitoring.

FOCUS OF THE REVIEW
This overview will focus on evidence for the use of alternative therapies in epilepsy, as well as the evidence of the
efficacy and tolerability of ketogenic diets.

COMMENTS ON EVIDENCE
There is limited evidence for the use of alternative therapies in epilepsy, although they may be useful in combination
with standard therapy. Evidence for the ketogenic diet as an additional anticonvulsant medication is good in children
with resistant seizures that have not responded to at least two anticonvulsants, but there is little evidence for its use
in adults.

SEARCH AND APPRAISAL SUMMARY
The update literature search for this review was carried out from the date of the last search, July 2009, to April 2014.
A search back-dated to 1966 was performed for the new options added to the scope at this update. For more infor-
mation on the electronic databases searched and criteria applied during assessment of studies for potential relevance
to the overview, please see the Methods section. Searching of electronic databases retrieved 259 studies. After
deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 253 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal
of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 208 studies and the further review of 45 full publications. Of the 45 full
articles evaluated, six systematic reviews and seven RCTs were included at this update.

DEFINITION

INCIDENCE/
PREVALENCE

Epilepsy should now be considered a group of disorders rather than a single disease. Seizures
can be classified by type as focal (with or without evolution into a bilateral convulsive seizure, as
with tonic clonic seizure) or generalised (categorised as generalised tonic clonic, absence, myoclonic,
tonic, and atonic seizures). [1]  A person is considered to have epilepsy if they have had two or
more unprovoked seizures. Accurate diagnosis is important both for epilepsy and for the type of
epilepsy (epilepsy syndrome). Exact medication is based on the type of epilepsy and age of pre-
sentation, not only looking for the medication most likely to work but also avoiding aggravation of
seizures.This review considers behavioural and psychological treatments of any epilepsy (gener-
alised or focal). See also the separate related review on Epilepsy (generalised) for information on
pharmacological and surgical treatments of generalised epilepsy. Status epilepticus is not covered
in this review.

Epilepsy  is  common,  with  an  estimated  average  prevalence  of  5.5/1000  people  in  Europe, [2]
6.8/1000 people in the US, [3]  and 7.5/1000 people in Australia. Prevalence rates in developing
countries  vary  widely,  with  studies  carried  out  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  reporting  rates  of  5.2  to
74.4/1000 people, [4]  studies in Asia reporting overall prevalence rates of 1.5 to 14.0/1000 people,
[5]  and studies in Latin America reporting rates of 17 to 22/1000 people. [6] The annual incidence
rates  of  epilepsy  are  24  to  56/100,000  people  in  Europe, [2]   44/100,000  in  the  US, [7]   63  to
158/100,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, [4]  113 to 190/100,000 people in Latin America, [6]  and
28 to 60/100,000 people in Asia. [5] The worldwide incidence of single unprovoked seizures is 23
to 61/100,000 person-years. [8]  About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy at some time
in their lives. [9]

RISK FACTORS

l

Epilepsy is a symptom rather than a disease, and it may be caused by various disorders involving
the brain. The causes/risk factors include birth/neonatal injuries, genetic abnormalities, structural
or metabolic disorders (including brain malformations), tumours, infections of the brain or meninges,
head  injuries,  degenerative  disease  of  the  brain,  or  cerebrovascular  disease.  Epilepsy  can  be
classified by cause. [1]  A re-organisation of the epilepsies has considered that, on a diagnosis of
epilepsy, the syndrome should be diagnosed where possible. The cause may then be considered
according to whether it is genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, or unknown.

l

PROGNOSIS

About 60% of untreated people have no further seizures during the 2 years after their first unpro-
voked  seizure; [10]   however,  community-based  studies  have  suggested  a  lower  percentage.
Prognosis is good for most people with epilepsy. About 70% go into remission, defined as being
seizure-free for 5 years on or off treatment. This leaves 20% to 30% who develop chronic epilepsy,
which is often treated with multiple anticonvulsant drugs. [11]

AIMS OF
INTERVENTION

To reduce the risk of subsequent seizures and to improve the prognosis of the seizure disorder;
to improve quality of life; in people in remission, to withdraw anticonvulsant drugs without causing
seizure  recurrence;  to  minimise  adverse  effects  of  treatment,  to  reduce  comorbidity,  injury,  and
mortality.

OUTCOMES

METHODS

For behavioural and psychological treatments: improvement in quality of life, including reduction
in anxiety, depression, and fear of seizures; coping or adjustment to epilepsy (assessed by validated
measures), psychosocial functioning; seizure frequency, including the proportion of responders
(response defined as 50% reduction in seizure frequency) and percentage reduction in seizure
frequency; adverse effects. For ketogenic diets: seizure frequency; quality of life; adverse ef-
fects.

Search  strategy BMJ  Clinical  Evidence  search  and  appraisal  April  2014.  Databases  used  to
identify studies for this systematic review included: Medline 1966 to April 2014, Embase 1980 to
April 2014, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2014, issue 4 (1966 to date of issue),
the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and the Health Technology Assessment
(HTA) database. Inclusion criteria Study design criteria for inclusion in this review were system-
atic reviews and RCTs published in English, open-label or single-blinded, and containing 20 or
more individuals (with a minimum of 10 participants in each arm), of whom more than 80% were
followed up. There was a minimum length of 3 months follow-up from the start of treatment for re-
porting outcomes, but we reported longer-term outcomes when available. Many of the trials we
found were of insufficient quality for this BMJ Clinical Evidence overview. BMJ Clinical Evidence
does not necessarily report every study found (e.g., every systematic review). Rather, we report
the most recent, relevant and comprehensive studies identified through an agreed process involving
our evidence team, editorial team, and expert contributors. Evidence evaluation A systematic lit-
erature search was conducted by our evidence team, who then assessed titles and abstracts, and
finally selected articles for full text appraisal against inclusion and exclusion criteria agreed a priori
with our expert contributors. In consultation with the expert contributors, studies were selected for
inclusion and all data relevant to this overview extracted into the benefits and harms section of the
review. In addition, information that did not meet our predefined criteria for inclusion in the benefits
and harms section, may have been reported in the 'Further information on studies' or 'Comment'
section. Adverse effects All serious adverse effects, or those adverse effects reported as statisti-
cally significant, were included in the harms section of the overview. Pre-specified adverse effects
identified as being clinically important were also reported, even if the results were not statistically
significant. Although BMJ Clinical Evidence presents data on selected adverse effects reported in
included studies, it is not meant to be, and cannot be, a comprehensive list of all adverse effects,
contraindications, or interactions of included drugs or interventions. A reliable national or local drug
database must be consulted for this information. Comment and Clinical guide sections In the
Comment section of each intervention, our expert contributors may have provided additional com-
ment and analysis of the evidence, which may include additional studies (over and above those
identified via our systematic search) by way of background data or supporting information. As BMJ
Clinical Evidence does not systematically search for studies reported in the Comment section, we
cannot guarantee the completeness of the studies listed there or the robustness of methods. Our
expert contributors add clinical context and interpretation to the Clinical guide sections where ap-
propriate. Data and quality To aid readability of the numerical data in our reviews, we round many
percentages to the nearest whole number. Readers should be aware of this when relating percent-
ages to summary statistics such as relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs). BMJ Clinical Evidence
does not report all methodological details of included studies. Rather, it reports by exception any
methodological issue or more general issue which may affect the weight a reader may put on an
individual study, or the generalisability of the result. These issues may be reflected in the overall
GRADE analysis. We have performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interven-

tions included in this review (see table, p 17 ). The categorisation of the quality of the evidence
(into  high,  moderate,  low,  or  very  low)  reflects  the  quality  of  evidence  available  for  our  chosen
outcomes in our defined populations of interest.These categorisations are not necessarily a reflection
of the overall methodological quality of any individual study, because the BMJ Clinical Evidence
population and outcome of choice may represent only a small subset of the total outcomes reported,
and population included, in any individual trial. For further details of how we perform the GRADE
evaluation and the scoring system we use, please see our website (www.clinicalevidence.com).

Benefits:

Electroencephalographic biofeedback versus placebo or control:
We found one systematic review (search date 2011), [12]  which identified one three-armed controlled
trial [13]  (24 adults, including 15 men, with uncontrolled epilepsy) of electroencephalographic
biofeedback compared with control treatment. The trial did not fulfil the inclusion criteria for this
BMJ Clinical Evidence overview (see Comment). We found one further systematic review (search
date 2005), which found no further RCTs. [14] We found no subsequent RCTs.

Galvanic skin response biofeedback versus placebo or control:

(see Comment). We found no subsequent RCTs.

Harms:

Electroencephalographic biofeedback versus control:
We found no RCTs.

Galvanic skin response biofeedback versus control:
We found no RCTs.

Comment:

Electroencephalographic biofeedback
The trial compared three treatments: electroencephalographic biofeedback, sham (non-contingent)
feedback, and no intervention (8 people in each group). [12]
[13]  It was below the minimum inclusion
criteria of this BMJ Clinical Evidence overview of 10 people per treatment arm. The RCT found a
significant reduction in seizure frequency compared with the baseline frequency in people given
biofeedback (median seizure reduction with biofeedback 61% v baseline; P <0.005).

The RCT did not provide data about seizure frequency in the control group. [13] The review was,
therefore, unable to compare the electroencephalographic-biofeedback and control groups. [12]
The study was not blinded and the randomisation method was not clear. The duration of follow-up
was only 6 weeks. The evidence is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions about the effects of
electroencephalographic biofeedback.

Galvanic skin response biofeedback
The review found one further single-blinded RCT (18 people), which compared galvanic response
biofeedback with sham biofeedback. [12] Ten people were randomised to biofeedback and eight
people to control. Three people withdrew from the control group. We have, therefore, not reported
the RCT further.

Clinical guide
There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the use of biofeedback in the management of
epilepsy.

Benefits:

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus control:
We found two systematic reviews (search date 2011; [12]  and 2012 [15] ).

Seizure frequency:
The first systematic review [12]  identified two RCTs comparing CBT with control treatments, which
[17] The second review [15]  did not report on seizure frequency.
examined seizure frequency. [16]

The first RCT (30 adults with significant psychological problems and inadequate seizure control,
as judged by the treating neurologist) included in the review was a three-armed unblinded trial
comparing group CBT with supportive counselling control and with no intervention for 8 weeks. It
found no significant difference between CBT and either supportive counselling control or no treatment
in reduction in seizure frequency (proportion of people with >67% reduction in seizure frequency:
1/10 [10%] with CBT v 2/10 [20%] with supportive counselling v 1/10 [10%] with control; CBT v
supportive counselling OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.19; CBT v no treatment OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06
to 17.25). [16]  However, the RCT was too small to detect a clinically important difference. The
method of randomisation and allocation concealment was not clear, and the review noted that there
was a considerable variation in mean baseline weekly seizure frequencies between groups.

The second RCT included in the review (27 adults, aged 21–55 years, refractory epilepsy, 4
seizures/3 months) compared acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT, which is developed from
the same theory of learning as CBT) with supportive therapy (people instructed to reflect on their
lives and problems in a non-judgemental, empathic, and accepting environment, without any active
advice). [17] The RCT found that ACT significantly reduced frequency of seizures at 6 and at 12
months' follow-up compared with supportive therapy (27 people in analysis, mean at 6 months: 0.7
with ACT v 5.86 with supportive therapy, mean difference –5.16, 95% CI –7.18 to –3.14, P <0.00001;
at 12 months: 0.62 with ACT v 5.8 with supportive therapy; mean difference –5.18, 95% CI –7.14
to –3.22; P <0.0001). The review noted that the results were difficult to interpret as the data were
skewed. [12]

[19]  One of these RCTs (15 people with epilepsy and depression) did not meet our

[18]

[17]

The first RCT (30 adults with significant psychological problems and inadequate seizure control,
as judged by the treating neurologist) included in the review found no significant difference between
CBT and control treatments in various psychological scales, such as the Washington Psychosocial
Inventory, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory
(reported as no significant difference, P values not reported). [12]

The second RCT (27 adults, 21–55 years, refractory epilepsy, 4 seizures/3 months) found that
CBT significantly improved quality-of-life scores (measured on the WHO Quality of Life [WHOQOL-
BREF] scale and the satisfaction with life scale [SWLS]) at 6 months and at 12 months compared
with supportive therapy (mean WHOQOL-BREF scores at 6 months: 61.21 with CBT v 56.08 with
supportive therapy; P <0.001; mean SWLS scores: 27.07 with CBT v 14.46 with supportive therapy;
P <0.001; mean WHOQOL-BREF scores at 12 months: 66.07 with CBT v 51.85 with supportive
therapy; P <0.001; mean SWLS scores: 27.07 with ACT v 15.77 with supportive therapy; P <0.001).
[17]

The third RCT (30 people, 13–19 years, newly diagnosed epilepsy and with sub-threshold depres-
sion) compared CBT with treatment with counselling as usual (TAU). [18]  Assessments were made
at baseline, and at 6 and at 9 months, using the Beck Depression inventory (BDI), the Center for
Epidemiological Study on depression (CES-D), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and the
Quality-of-Life Epilepsy Inventory Total Scores (QOLIE-31 Total). The RCT found that CBT signif-
icantly improved subthreshold depression compared with TAU during follow-up ([higher QOLIE-31
Total scores, and lower BDI and CES-D scores, indicate an improvement]; mean BDI scores at 9
months: 5.60 with CBT v 7.70 with TAU; CES-D scores at 9 months: 10.5 with CBT v 13.8 with
TAU; QOLIE-31 Total scores at 9 months: 56.40 with CBT v 42.23 with TAU; P <0.05 between the

two groups for all comparisons). The RCT found that depression was diagnosed in three people
in the TAU group and none in the CBT group after 7 to 9 months (reported as not significant; P
value not reported). [18]

CBT versus relaxation:
We found one systematic review (search date 2012), which included one RCT (37 people, 60 years
or older) comparing group CBT with relaxation (6 weekly sessions of 2 hours each; focused on
seizure control). [15] The review reported that it found no significant difference between groups in
Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Computerised (CIDI-Auto) for a diagnosis of depression
and dysthymia or Geriatric Depression Scale at 3 months (reported as no significant difference,
absolute numbers not reported, P value not reported). [15] The review did not report on seizure
control. [15]

Harms:

The reviews gave no information on harms. [12]

[15]

Comment:

Publication bias cannot be excluded. The evidence is insufficient to define the effects of CBT in
people with epilepsy.

Seizure frequency
One review found one further RCT comparing ACT with yoga. [12] The trial was below the minimum
inclusion criteria for this BMJ Clinical Evidence overview (18 people).

Psychosocial functioning
The second review found five RCTs comparing CBT with usual care for depression in people with
epilepsy. [15] Three RCTs [16]
[19]  were also in the first review. [12] The fourth had a drop-out
rate of 36%, so this is not reported further. The fifth included RCT (80 people, mean age 43 years,
with a formal diagnosis of depression) compared group CBT (8 individual hourly visits over 19
weeks, focused on depression) with usual care. [15]  It found a significant difference on two measures
at 12 months (Hopkins Symptom Checklist: P = 0.003; suicide items: P = 0.025), and no significant
difference on both measures at 18 months (absolute numbers not reported, P values not reported).

[18]

Clinical guide
Evidence is weak with regard to determining the effect of CBT on seizures. However, there may
be an effect on psychosocial functioning, specifically the risk of depression.

Quality of life
Educational  programmes  compared  with  control  Educational  programmes  may  be  more  effective  than  control  at
improving some outcomes (such as knowledge about what to do, improved competencies, improved participation in
activities, reduced anxieties, and AKA scores) in children and adults aged 7 years and above at 3 to 5 months, but
we don't know about quality-of-life scores (very low-quality evidence).

Note:
We found no direct evidence from RCTs of sufficient quality on the effects of educational programmes compared
with control on seizure outcomes.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for epilepsy, see table, p 17 .

Benefits:

Educational programmes versus control: We found two systematic reviews (search date 2011;
[12]  and 2010 [20] ). The first systematic review [12]  included three RCTs [21]
[23]  and one quasi-
randomised trial). [24]  Only the second included RCT was of sufficient quality for this BMJ Clinical
Evidence overview (see Comment). [22] The second systematic review found no further RCTs. [20]
We found one subsequent RCT (see Comment). [25]  In addition, we found three further subsequent
RCTs, which were not of sufficient quality for this BMJ Clinical Evidence overview (see Comment).
[26]

[27]

[22]

[28]

The second unblinded RCT included in the review (252 children aged 7–14 years) found that a
child-centred, family-focused educational programme significantly improved questionnaire responses
compared with control intervention (knowledge about what to do during a seizure [no objects in
mouth, P = 0.002; do not restrain, P = 0.001], purpose of the electroencephalographic examination
[P = 0.02], and minimal restriction in activities [P = 0.001]), increased the proportion of children
likely to participate in normal activities (P <0.03), improved perceived academic and social compe-
tencies of the children (P <0.05), and reduced the anxiety of parents (see Comment) at 5 months.
[22]

The first subsequent RCT (144 people with epilepsy, aged 18 or older [mean 31 years], on regular
treatment, most generalised seizures [51%]) compared an SMS-based mobile epilepsy education

Education System (MEES) based on the Modular Service Package for Epilepsy (MOSES), delivered
via text messaging (SMS). The RCT found that MEES significantly improved outcomes (measured
by Malay Awareness, Knowledge, and Attitude Epilepsy Form [AKA]) compared with control at 3
months (136 people, total AKA score [range 0–170]: mean score: 7.3 with MEES v 6.2 with control,
P <0.01). The RCT found that MEES significantly improved all three individual domains compared
with control (awareness, P <0.01; knowledge, P <0.05; attitudes, P <0.05). It found no significant
difference between groups in treatment adherence (136 people, adherence score [range 0–1]:
mean score: 0.80 with MEES v 0.83 with control, P >0.05)

Comment:

The first RCT included in the review (43 adults of 100 initially randomised, including 28 women;
38 people completed study) found that a specific 2-day educational programme significantly improved
responses to a 50-item true/false questionnaire compared with control intervention (overall under-
standing of epilepsy, significant decrease in fear of seizures, significant decrease in hazardous
medical self-management) and significantly improved compliance with current medication (shown
by serum anticonvulsant drug levels). [21]

The third RCT (242 people out of 383 initially randomised aged 16–80 years, 57% women) included
in the review reported on seizure frequency. [23]  It found that a 2-day educational programme sig-
nificantly reduced seizure frequency at 6 months compared with waiting list control (proportion of
people with at least 2-point reduction in seizure frequency on a 6-point scale [0 = no seizures in
last 6 months, 5 = at least 1 seizure daily]: 19% with education v 7% with control; P value not re-
ported). [23]  However, the clinical importance of this effect is unclear. It found that a 2-day educa-
tional programme had no significant effect on SF-36 questionnaire scores 6 months after the pro-
gramme compared with waiting list control (SF-36 mental health component score: 43.7 with edu-
cational package v 42.5 with control; P value not reported; SF-36 physical component score: 50.4
with educational package v 52.0 with control; P value not reported). [23]  Scales validated using the
study population revealed significant improvement in epilepsy knowledge and coping with epilepsy.

The fourth quasi-randomised trial in the review (30 adults, number of women not stated) compared
a 2-day modular didactic psycho-educational programme on adjustment to epilepsy, stigma, psy-
choneurotic traits, depression, and knowledge about epilepsy with waiting list control. [24]  It found
that the educational programme significantly improved depression and neurotic disorders at 2
months compared with control (change in depression measured using Beck Depression Inventory
scores: from 15.0 at baseline to 1.5 with psycho-educational programme v from 15.1 at baseline
to 10.0 with control; P <0.0001; neurotic disorders assessed using change in Crown Crisp Experi-
ential Index scores: from 36.4 at baseline to 7.3 with psycho-educational programme v from 35.6
at baseline to 34.1 with control; P <0.0001). [24]

[24]  In the second RCT

All of the RCTs included in the first review had weak methods. [21]
included in the review, randomisation was by random number assignment, but only a proportion
of medical records were available to the authors (65% in the psycho-educational programme group
v 47% in the control group). [22]  In the first RCT, the method of randomisation was not reported.
[21]  A minority of the people in the first RCT actively participated in the interventions (23/50 [46%]
in the psycho-educational programme group v 20/50 [40%] in the control group) or completed the
study (20/50 [40%] in the psycho-educational programme group v 18/50 [36%] in the control group).
[21]  In the third RCT, the method of randomisation was not reported, and, among 383 people ran-
domised, 63% (242 people in total; 113 in the psycho-educational programme group and 119 in
the control group) completed the study. [23] The RCT reported that there was a significant difference
between groups in duration of epilepsy (P = 0.034) and the control group had a longer duration of
epilepsy (median: 18.2 years with control v 13.5 years with educational intervention). In the fourth
RCT, randomisation was by alternate allocation (allocated "on alternate first come basis"). [24]  It
reported that people "were matched according to seizure type and frequency of seizures", but this
was not further explained. [24]  Outcome assessment was at 2 months.

The interventions used in these studies were similar, but there was some variation, which is outlined
below. The first RCT used the Sepulveda Epilepsy Education programme — a 2-day psycho-edu-
cational treatment programme designed to provide medical education and psychosocial therapy.
[21]  In the second RCT, children with epilepsy and their parents attended four 1.5-hour sessions
at weekly intervals. [22] The children's sessions included: understanding body messages and how
seizures occur; controlling seizures with medication; straightforward methods of talking about
seizures; and coping and adapting to epilepsy. The third RCT used MOSES (Modular service
package Epilepsy), a programme developed for use in German-speaking countries. [23]  It included

nine units: living with epilepsy, epidemiology, basic knowledge, diagnostics, therapy, self-control,
prognosis, psychosocial aspects, and network. The programme was delivered in 14 hours over 2
days. The fourth RCT used a 2-day modular, didactic, psychoeducational programme, which
comprised preliminary assessment and establishment of rapport on day 1 and a didactic modular
educational session (covering background information, diagnosis and management of epilepsy,
day-to-day adjustments, seizure control, and stigma), with time for group discussions and clarifica-
tions, on day 2. [24]

The first subsequent RCT did not state the method of randomisation, the level of blinding was not
described, and follow-up was by telephone. [25]  It was not clear whether the printed epilepsy
module given to both groups was part of usual care, although it described the printed modules as
"conventional epilepsy education".

We found one further subsequent RCT, which compared a 1-day health education programme in
rural Kenya with no education programme. [26]  Its primary outcome was adherence to treatment,
but it also reported on seizure frequency. It analysed data for 581/738 (79%) of people randomised.
People included were described as having active convulsive epilepsy, defined as at least two un-
provoked convulsions, with one in the previous 12 months (further details on diagnosis of epilepsy
not reported, about 35%–37% of people on polytherapy, seizure frequency last 3 months: none,
284 people; 1–3, 167 people; 4–6, 52 people; >6, 78 people). The RCT noted that one district
hospital supplied phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and sodium valproate, while 13 health
clinics stocked only phenobarbital. The intervention was randomised to the participant and desig-
nated caregiver, but not to 51 traditional healers and 14 health providers (nurses and clinical officers)
from local health facilities who also received an educational intervention. It found no significant
difference between groups in less-frequent seizures (defined as 0–3 in last 3 months) at 1 year
(243/303 [80%] with education programme v 208/278 [75%] with no intervention; P = 0.12).

Another subsequent RCT compared an online epilepsy self-management programme (WebEase)
with a waiting list control group. [27]  However, the control group also received the intervention after
6 weeks, so at 12 weeks' follow-up both groups had received the intervention.

A further subsequent RCT (66 people with epilepsy, aged 18–53 years) compared a 1-month self-
management educational programme with usual care. [28]  Outcomes were measured on the
Epilepsy Self-Management Scale (ESMS; 38 items). It did not report outcomes at 3 months or
longer. However, the RCT found significantly higher self-management scores with the programme
compared with usual care at 1 month after completion of the programme (reported as P <0.001,
unclear as to what data this P value relates to). [28]

Clinical guide
There is some evidence that educational programmes targeted at increasing knowledge about
epilepsy improve measures of quality of life as well as seizure frequency.

We found no RCTs of sufficient quality on the effects of family counselling in people with epilepsy.

Benefits:

Family counselling versus control: We found one systematic review (search date 2011), which
found no RCTs (see Comment). [12] We found no subsequent RCTs.

Harms:

Family counselling versus control: We found no RCTs.

Comment:

The systematic review [12]  mentioned one small RCT (36 adults, including 26 men, with epilepsy
and job loss), [29]  which it excluded for weak methods. It compared three interventions: family
therapy (no detailed description, but it seems that the family was present for discussion of problems
for a mean of 7.8 sessions), one family session (in which information about the seizure profile was
given), and usual care (vocational assistance in obtaining a job, with no follow-up other than site
visit). [29]  It did not report on seizure frequencies, but found a significantly improved psychosocial
inventory score with family therapy (Washington Psychosocial Inventory, 27 completers: improved
perceived acceptance by family, emotional adjustment, interpersonal adjustment, adjustment to
seizures, and overall psychosocial function). It found a trend towards improvement in job stability.

The method of concealment of randomisation was not described in the RCT. [29]  Nine of the 36
people (25%) did not complete the study, and withdrawal was uneven across the groups (2 with
family therapy, 6 with 1 family session, 1 with no intervention). The available evidence is insufficient
to define the effects of family counselling.

Harms:

Relaxation therapy versus placebo or control: We found no RCTs.

Comment:

In one included trial there were only six participants per group, [30]  another included trial had only
four participants per group, [32]  and the remaining trial used alternating blocks to allocate participants.
[31] Two of the studies found a non-significant reduction in seizure frequency (50% or greater re-
duction) with relaxation therapy compared with no relaxation therapy, [31]
[32]  and one study found
a significantly reduced seizure frequency. [30] The RCTs gave no information on adverse effects.
The weak methods preclude reliable conclusions.

[31]

All three trials used weak methods. [30]
[32] The treatment allocation methods were strict alter-
nation, [32]  alternation in blocks of five, [31]  or were not reported. [30] The baseline seizure frequency
varied considerably among the allocated groups in all of the trials. In one RCT, the review reported
that the baseline seizure frequency was 17 with relaxation and 10 with control (units not reported,
P value not reported). [12]  In this trial, two people in the treatment group had new anticonvulsant
medication added during the study period, and one of these had a greater than 50% reduction in
seizure frequency; another person discontinued anticonvulsant medication. [31]  Anticonvulsant
drug treatment was also adjusted during the trial, making it difficult to conclude whether the observed
results were due to changes in drug treatment or due to the intervention.The possibility of publication
bias cannot be excluded.

One further study included in the review (32 people, alternate allocation, age and gender not re-
ported) compared progressive relaxation training with no training and reported on psychosocial
functioning. [12]  However, only 16/32 (50%) of people completed the 6-month study, so we have
not reported it further. The effects of relaxation therapy remain unclear. The limited duration for
which people sustained the therapy suggests that it is unlikely to be of clinical benefit.

Clinical guide
There is insufficient evidence to suggest that relaxation training has a positive effect on epilepsy;
the high drop-out rate suggests that it is unlikely to be sustainable.

in a 2:1 ratio). [34]
Seizure frequency:
The second RCT reported separately the mean seizure frequencies for each seizure type but did
not specify the number in each category. It reported separately the mean seizure frequencies for
those people with fewer than 20 seizures/month and those with more than 20 seizures/month at
baseline. The review reported that the data were skewed and it was, therefore, unable to undertake
an analysis of these data. [12]

Psychological outcomes:
The second RCT found that relaxation plus behavioural modification therapy (conditioning, desen-
sitisation, aversion, assertiveness training, and supportive psychotherapy) significantly improved
state anxiety, trait anxiety, and adjustment (home, health, social and emotional; absolute numbers
not reported for any analysis, P values not reported). [12]  However, the review reported that psy-
chological outcomes were only available for 88 people (59/100 [59%] with intervention v 29/50
[58%] with control), which is below the minimum inclusion criteria for this review.

Harms:

Relaxation plus behavioural modification therapy compared with control: The review gave
no information on adverse effects. [12]

Comment:

The reporting in the review in the second included RCT (150 people) was based on unpublished
data from a PhD thesis in 1987. [12] The review reported that baseline, treatment, and follow-up
phases were not clear, the trial was unblinded, and there was no allocation concealment.

It is possible that the results of the psychological interventions on psychosocial functioning may
depend on the baseline personalities of the people included in the study, and on their education
and intelligence.

Clinical guide
It is likely that benefit from relaxation therapy is likely to depend on the individual, underlying co-
morbidity, and type of epilepsy. The evidence available does not give a clearer view as to who may
benefit.

We don't know whether yoga is more effective than placebo or control as we found no RCTs of sufficient
quality.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for epilepsy, see table, p 17 .

Benefits:

Yoga versus placebo or control: We found one systematic review (search date 2011, [35]  1 quasi-
randomised trial, [36]  32 adults, including 30 women). The trial did not fulfil the inclusion criteria for
this BMJ Clinical Evidence overview (see Comment). We found no subsequent RCTs.

Harms:

Yoga versus placebo or control: We found no RCTs.

Comment:

The unblinded trial divided people into three groups by rolling a dice, and allocation concealment
was unclear. [35] The trial compared sahaja yoga (10 people) with control (sham yoga [10 people],
and no intervention [12 people]). It found that yoga reduced seizure frequency compared with
control, but it used weak methods, which precludes reliable conclusions. The baseline seizure
frequency and duration varied among the groups, making results difficult to interpret. [36] The review
noted that the mean age, mean duration of epilepsy, and the baseline seizure frequencies were
lower in the no-treatment group (mean age: 24.6 years in yoga group v 23.7 years in control group
v 19.7 years with no intervention; mean illness duration: 7.3 years v 5.6 years v 4.2 years; baseline
seizure frequency [attacks per month]: 3.2 v 3.0 v 2.6). [36] The review reported that there was a
significant baseline difference between the yoga and no-treatment groups for seizure duration
(P = 0.023) and seizure frequency (P = 0.043), and the durations of epilepsy in the three groups
were not comparable. The trial gave no information on adverse effects. [36]

The review included one further RCT comparing acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with
yoga, but the yoga group only included eight participants, which is below the minimum inclusion
criteria for this BMJ Clinical Evidence overview (10 people per treatment arm). [35]

The review concluded that no reliable conclusions could be drawn currently regarding the efficacy
of yoga as a treatment for epilepsy. [36]  Although no definitive benefit has been demonstrated, no
particular harm is rendered by participation in such an intervention.

Benefits:

Ketogenic diet versus no change in treatment:
We found one systematic review (search date 2011), [37]  which included one RCT. [38] We found
one subsequent RCT. [39] We have reported the RCT included in the review directly from the
original report. [38]  Both RCTs were undertaken in children. We found no RCT in adults.

The RCT included in the review (145 children aged 2–16 years, seizures at least daily or >7 seizures
per week, not responded to at least 2 anticonvulsants) compared either classic (LCT; 37 children)
or medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) (36 children) diet with control (normal diet with no dietetic input).
[38]  All ketogenic diets were calculated on an individual basis. The RCT reported that 78 children
had epilepsy characterised by generalised seizures and 57 children had focal sizures, and most
were on two medications (53 children) or three medications (54 children). The RCT found that ke-
togenic diet significantly increased the proportion of children with more than 50% seizure reduction
at 3 months (28/73 [38%] with diet v 4/72 [6%] with no change in treatment, P <0.0001). It found
no significant difference between groups in the proportion of children with more than 90% seizure
reduction at 3 months (5/73 [7%] with diet v 0/72 [0%] with no change in treatment, P = 0.0582).
[38]

The subsequent RCT (102 children aged 2–14 years [mean age about 5 years], 50% with Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome and 19% with West syndrome, seizures at least daily or >7 seizures per week,
on median of three anticonvulsants) compared a modified Atkins diet with no change in treatment
(normal diet with no additional dietary input). [39]  Most children had tonic (48 children), myoclonic
(47 children), and atonic (27 children) seizure types, among others. The RCT found that the modified
Atkins diet significantly increased the proportion of children with more than 50% seizure reduction
at 3 months (102 children, 52% with diet v 11.5% with control, absolute numbers not reported,
P <0.001). It also found that the modified Atkins diet significantly increased the proportion of children
with greater than 90% seizure control at 3 months (102 children, 30% with diet v 7.7% with control,
absolute numbers not reported, P = 0.005). [39]

Harms:

Ketogenic diet versus no change in treatment:
The RCT included in the first review reported that adverse effects in the diet group included hunger
(12/55 [22%]), vomiting (13/55 [24%]), diarrhoea (7/55 [13%]), abdominal pain (5/55 [9%]), consti-
pation (18/55 [33%]), and lethargy (13/55 [24%]; comparative figures for control group not reported).
[38]

The subsequent RCT reported that constipation was the most common adverse effect among
children on the diet (23/50 [46%]). [39]  Other adverse effects on the diet included anorexia (18%),
lethargy (6%), and vomiting (10%). Two children developed frequent chest infections, and one
child developed hyperammonaemic encephalopathy 1 week after starting the diet. This child had
refractory seizures of unknown aetiology. In these three children, the diet was discontinued. The
patient with hyperammonaemic encephalopathy improved after discontinuation of the diet. Com-
parative adverse effects data for the control group were not reported. [39]

erance of the diet, three for parental unhappiness, and one for seizure increase, and one was ex-
cluded owing to inadequate data. Of 65 children in the control group, 15 were excluded owing to
inadequate data. [38]

The evidence suggests that ketogenic diet therapy shows effectiveness over no change in treatment
in children resistant to anticonvulsant drug therapy. Children should be referred for consideration
of a ketogenic diet when seizures continue despite two anticonvulsant drugs. [40]

anticonvulsants. We  found  no  evidence  in  adults,  and  no  good  evidence  on  longer-term  effects  (very  low-quality

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for epilepsy, see table, p 17 .

Benefits:

Different implementation methods of ketogenic diet therapies versus each other:
We found one systematic review (search date 2011), [37]  which included four RCTs. [41]
[44] We found one subsequent RCT. [45] The review reported that meta-analysis could not be con-
ducted due to heterogeneity of the studies. We have reported the RCTs included in the review di-
rectly from their original reports. The RCTs varied in quality, and were all undertaken in children.
We found no RCT in adults.

[43]

[42]

The first included RCT (48 children, aged 1–14 years [mean age 5.3 years], one or more seizure
per 28 days, in whom at least 3 anticonvulsants had failed) compared two different initiation regi-
mens: a fasting ketogenic diet initiation (FAST-KD) or a non-fasting gradual ketogenic diet initiation
(GRAD-KD). [41]  About 48% of children had generalised seizures, and 52% had partial seizures.
The trial tested that outcome rates were no further apart than a pre-specified difference, and did
not directly test significance between groups. It reported that the proportion of children with a more
than 50% reduction in seizures at 3 months was 58% with FAST-KD versus 67% with GRAD-KD.
It reported that the proportion of children with more than 90% reduction in seizures at 3 months
was 29% with FAST-KD versus 46% with GRAD-KD; non-significant.

The second included cross-over RCT (20 children, age 3–18 years [mean age 7.5–9.8 years],
seizure frequency per week 41–55, mean of 2 current anticonvulsants, 35% with partial seizures)
compared two modified Atkins diets (initial of 10 g carbohydrate or initial of 20 g carbohydrate). [42]
The RCT reported that causes included idiopathic (15 participants), Rett syndrome (2 participants),
and cortical dysplasia (2 participants), among others, and that 13 participants had either generalised
or multifocal epilepsy. We have only reported pre-crossover results (see Comment). The RCT
found that the initial 10 g diet significantly increased the proportion of children with a more than
50% seizure reduction compared with the initial 20 g diet at 3 months (6/10 [60%] with initial 10 g
diet v 1/10 [10%] with initial 20 g diet, P = 0.03). It found no significant difference between groups
in the proportion of children who had a greater than 90% reduction in seizures at 3 months (3/10
[30%] with initial 10 g diet v 0/10 [0%] with initial 20 g diet, P = 0.10; see Comment).

The third included RCT (76 children, 4 months–16 years [mean age 44–51 months], mean daily
seizure frequency 10.3, seizures not controlled by at least 3 anticonvulsants) compared two keto-
genic diets with lipid:nonlipid ratios of 3:1 and 4:1 (non-fasting protocol). [43]  In total, 30 participants
had infantile spasms, 21 participants had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 17 participants had partial
seizures, and eight participants had generalised seizures. We have reported outcomes at 3 months
(see Comment). The RCT reported that the proportion of participants who were seizure-free at 3
months was 22/40 (55%) with the 4:1 diet versus 11/36 (31%) with 3:1 diet, and a seizure reduction
of more than 90% was observed in 2/40 (5%) with the 4:1 diet versus 2/36 (5.6%) with 3:1 diet (P

The fourth included RCT [44]  was the second part of a previously reported RCT [38]  (see option on
Ketogenic diet versus control, p 11 ). Initially, some children received their allocated diet immedi-
ately or started after a 3-month delay; all children were randomised to receive a classical ketogenic
diet or a medium-chain triglyceride diet (MCT). The RCT (145 children aged 2–16 years, seizures
at least daily or >7 seizures per week, not responded to at least 2 anticonvulsants) compared the
response to the two diets. A non-fasting initiation protocol was used, and all diets were calculated
individually by a dietitian. The RCT found no significant difference between the groups in the pro-
portion of children who had a nore than 50% or 90% reduction in seizures at 3 months (>50% re-
duction: 18/73 [25%] with classical diet v 21/72 [29%] with MCT diet, P = 0.578; >90% reduction:
5/73 (7%) with classical diet v 2/72 [3%] with MCT diet, P = 0.442). The RCT also reported on
outcomes at 6 and 12 months (see Comments). [44]

Harms:

The subsequent RCT (38 children, aged 6 months–5 years [median age 30–36 months], median
seizure frequency 10–12 per day, despite use of at least two anticonvulsants including one newer
agent) compared a 4:1 or a 2.5:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio ketogenic diet (non-fasting gradual initiation
protocol). [45] The RCT reported that 16 participants had West syndrome, 16 participants had
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome among others, and seizure types included myoclonic (22 participants),
atypical absence (18 participants), generalised tonic (17 participants), and infantile spasms (16
participants) among others.The RCT found no significant difference between groups in the proportion
of children who had a greater than 50% reduction in seizures at 3 months (11/19 [58%] with 4:1
group v 12/19 [63%] in the 2.5:1 group, P = 0.78) or became seizure-free at 3 months (5/19 [26%]
with 4:1 group v 4/19 [21%] with 2.5:1 group, reported as not significantly different, P value not
reported). [45]

Different implementation methods of ketogenic diet therapies versus each other:
In the first included RCT, five children experienced serious adverse effects during the first 3 months:
status epilepticus, pancreatitis, extended hospital stay, acidosis, dehydration, tachycardia of unknown
aetiology, and transient elevation in transaminases. Four of the five children were in the FAST-KD
group. [41] The RCT found a significant difference between groups in weight loss from days 2 to 6
and hypoglycaemia (weight loss from days 2–6: median –0.95 kg with FAST-KD v –0.30 kg with
GRAD-KD, P = 0.006; hypoglycaemia at least once: 33% with FAST-KD v 4% with GRAD-KD,
P = 0.023). A greater proportion required intravenous fluids for dehydration in the FAST-KD group:
63% with FAST-KD v 29% with GRAD-KD, P <0.04.

The second included RCT reported no difference in median weight change over the first 3 months
between the groups (P = 0.44). [42]  It reported that four families found significant constipation (further
details not reported).

The third RCT reported that gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and poor
feeding) were significantly more frequent with the 4:1 diet compared with the 3:1 diet (14/40 [35%]
with 4:1 diet v 5/36 [14%] with 3:1 diet, P = 0.038). [43]  One participant with the 3:1 diet dropped
out due to complicated acute pancreatitis. Two participants with the 4:1 diet and one participant
with the 3:1 diet could not maintain the diet due to intolerance.

The fourth included RCT reported that there were no significant differences between the two types
of diet, except increased reports of lack of energy after 3 months and vomiting after 12 months
with use of the classical protocol. [44] The most common adverse effects (combined for both groups,
data for 89 participants) at 3 months were vomiting (24 participants), constipation (35 participants),
hunger (26 participants), and lack of energy (23 participants). [44]

The subsequent RCT reported that constipation was the most common adverse effect (5/19 [26%]
in 4:1 group v 3/19 [16%] in 2.5:1 group, P value not reported). [45]

Comment:

Methods
The first included RCT was unblinded, and there was one drop-out in each arm. [37]

In the second included RCT, although it reported an intention-to-treat analysis, one child did not
start the diet, 16 participants (80%) were still on the diet at 3 months, while 12 participants (60%)
completed the 6-month trial. [42] We have, therefore, only reported outcomes at 3 months. The
reasons for drop-out were not reported, the method of randomisation or allocation concealment
was not stated, and the trial was unblinded. [37] The trial noted that the diets containing the 10 g
and 20 g carbohydrates were very similar with respect to the actual carbohydrates provided (actual
5 g per day difference when analysed). [42]

In the third included RCT, participants who were seizure-free at 3 months with the 4:1 diet were
recommended to change to the 3:1 diet, while those who were not seizure-free with a 3:1 diet were
recommended to change to the 4:1 diet. [43] We have, therefore, only reported outcomes up to 3
months.The method of randomisation, allocation concealment, or level of blinding was not described.
The RCT reported that there were 12/76 (16%) drop-outs by 3 months.

The fourth included RCT was unblinded. [44]  Although an intention-to-treat analysis was presented,
results at 3 months were based on 94/145 (64%) of children randomised. After randomisation, 20
children did not receive the dietary treatment, most (10 cases) due to changing their mind. Of the
125 children who received the allocated diet, 25 discontinued before the 3 months assessment.
[44] The RCT also presented results at 6 and 12 months. Although these were presented as an ITT
analysis, they were based on progressively fewer children initially randomised, so we have not re-
ported them further.

The subsequent RCT was unblinded. [45] Three participants discontinued in each group (unsatis-
factory seizure control [3], refusal to eat [2], and non-acceptance by family members [1]).

Clinical guide
There are no data to suggest any difference in efficacy according to the method of implementation
of ketogenic diet therapy in children with epilepsy.

GLOSSARY
Cognitive behavioural therapy A broad category of interventions designed to identify and control stress and minimise
its effects, often by using intellectual experience to correct damaging thoughts and behaviour.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback A technique of making EEG activity apparent to a person, who is
then taught to produce certain EEG waves that are believed to increase the threshold for seizures.

Hamilton Depression Rating Scale a measure of depressive symptoms using 17 items, with total scores from 0
to 54 (higher scores indicate increased severity of depression).

Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) A battery of standardised tests to assess personality (psy-
chopathology).

Relaxation therapy Techniques to train people to control muscle tension.

SF-36 score A scale that assesses health related quality of life across eight domains: limitations in physical activities
(physical component); limitations in social activities; limitations in usual role activities because of physical problems;
pain; psychological distress and wellbeing (mental health component); limitations in usual role activities because of
emotional problems; energy and fatigue; and general health perceptions.

Washington Psychosocial Inventory (WPSI) A standardised battery of tests to assess adjustment in various
spheres (measure of psychosocial difficulties) in people with epilepsy.

Atonic seizure Momentary loss of limb muscle tone causing sudden falling to the ground or droping of the head.

Beck Depression Inventory Standardised scale to assess depression.This instrument consists of 21 items to assess
the intensity of depression. Each item is a list of 4 statements (rated 0, 1, 2, or 3), arranged in increasing severity,
about a particular symptom of depression. The range of scores possible are 0 = least severe depression to 63 = most
severe depression. It is recommended for people aged 13 to 80 years. Scores of more than 12 or 13 indicate the
presence of depression.

Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale 20-item 4-point Likert scale, with scores that
range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate more symptoms of depression.

Crown Crisp Experiential Index Formerly known as Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire (MHQ), this is a self-reported
questionnaire providing information on psychoneurotic traits. It comprises 48 items with an overall score for neuroticism,
with further subscores for free-floating anxiety, phobic anxiety, obsessionality, somatic anxiety, depression, and
hysterical anxiety. A higher score indicates more overall neurotic disorder.

Ketogenic diet A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet used in the management of epilepsy.

Low-quality evidence Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate
of effect and is likely to change the estimate.

Tonic clonic seizure Also known as a convulsion or previously as a 'grand mal' attack. The person will become stiff
(tonic) and collapse, and have generalised jerking (clonic) movements. Breathing might stop and the bladder might
empty. Generalised jerking movements lasting typically for a few minutes are followed by relaxation and deep uncon-
sciousness, before the person slowly comes round. People are often tired and confused, and may remember nothing.
Tonic clonic seizures may follow focal seizures. Tonic clonic seizures occurring without warning and in the context
of generalised epilepsy are classified as generalised tonic clonic seizures.

Very low-quality evidence Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
