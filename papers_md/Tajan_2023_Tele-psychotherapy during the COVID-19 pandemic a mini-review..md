1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed psychotherapy practices. Psychotherapy 
around the world has shifted from predominantly face-to-face settings to overwhelmingly online 
settings since the beginning of the pandemic. Many initiatives worldwide have been implemented 
targeting healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as psychological 
support  systems  and  hotlines  for  hospital  workers  (1).  While  there  is  an  urge  to  provide 
emotional support to the healthcare workforce (2) and protect their mental health (3) there have 
been no studies specifically investigating mental health care workers’ own mental health. This 
paper aims to explore the consequences of the shift to telehealth in mental health practice for 
both clinicians and their patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been viewed as an opportunity to transform psychiatric care 
through the implementation of telehealth (4). However, there are several challenging issues 
regarding the implications of telehealth, including digital health inequity (5), and we do not have 
sufficient knowledge on the efficiency of online consultations and the extent to which they are 
accepted by clinicians and patients (6). More generally, the issue of distance mental health care 
practice is also central to disaster research (7, 8). Supporting people affected by health, but also 
natural, man-made and technological disasters, often requires creativity, as traditional care

be damaged; and, most people today, including many of the most 
disadvantaged, have access to a phone or the internet (9, 10).

providers, patients or their parents or caregivers were excluded. The 
selection  of  articles  selected  for  review  was  discussed  by  all  three 
authors via Zoom (Table 1).

Many  studies  have  been  published  since  the  beginning  of  the 
pandemic, but there has been no review of the literature focused on 
mental health providers. Our goal is to identify the challenging issues 
surrounding  teletherapy, 
including  the  efficiency  of  online 
consultations  and  the  extent  to  which  they  are  accepted  by  both 
therapists and patients.

2. Methods

A PubMed literature search restricted to the English language 
using 
the  [(“Teletherapy”  OR  “Telebehavioral  health”  OR 
“Telepsychotherapy”) AND (“COVID-19”)] search string retrieved 46 
studies  focused  on  mental  health  professionals,  as  detailed  in  a 
PRISMA flow diagram (11). The articles under review were published 
from January 1, 2020 to April 13, 2023 (Figure 1).

Two reviewers (NT and RP) independently screened the abstracts 
and  excluded  those  that  were  outside  the  scope  of  the  review.  To 
be included in the mini-review, articles had to be focused on mental 
health  professionals  and  online  psychotherapy  practice  during  the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Articles targeting other health care workers or 

3. Results

Among the 46 studies retained, four subgroups were distinguished. 
The  first  group  includes  articles  on  mental  health  services  and 
therapists (17/46). The second group focus solely on psychodynamic 
approaches (11/46). The third subgroup consists of studies on couples 
and marriage and family therapy practices (10/46). The fourth group 
comprises the treatment of specific mental disorders, such as PTSD or 
developmental disorders (8/46).

3.1. Mental health services: insufficient 
technological infrastructure, training, 
privacy, and support of 
telepsychotherapists

A  study  in  the  Netherlands  (12)  focusing  on  experiences  of 
psychotherapists, both positive and negative, found that insufficient 
technological  infrastructure  both  on  the  side  of  the  therapist

(internet-connection  stability)  and  the  patient,  who  might  lack 
necessary devices (smartphone or computer) are significant barriers 
as well as a lack of privacy in the clients’ environments. The need for 
an improved technological infrastructure, user-friendly technologies, 
appropriate  devices,  stable  internet  connections  and  privacy  is 
reported  by  numerous  other  studies  in  different  contexts  and 
countries. For instance, Roberts and colleagues (13) investigated the 
specific situations for healthcare delivery from teams who come from 
outside  the  region  where  services  are  offered,  such  as  Canadian 
circumpolar regions. The perceived challenges in the case of services 
for Indigenous communities were the lack of technology, internet 

access, and privacy. In Italy, CB therapists (14) also mention difficulties 
in accessing a private space at home and using videoconferencing 
instead of telephone. In Oman, a study underlines (15) a lack of public 
tele-mental  health  services  and  guidelines,  a  shortage  of  trained 
therapists – consistent with another survey in Lebanon (16) – as well 
as limited access to high-speed internet and electronic devices, privacy 
and security concerns.
Increased  stress 

levels  were  reported  among  Austrian 
psychotherapists compared to a control group during the COVID-19 
pandemic (17). Additionally, three Austrian cross sectional online 
surveys assessing patient numbers show an increasing workload for 

Frontiers in Psychiatry

07

frontiersin.org

Tajan et al. 

10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1060961

psychotherapists and an insufficient support of psychotherapists (18). 
A Scottish study (19) also found that MH workers are less able to 
receive support from colleagues. In addition to an increased stress and 
a lack of support, a lack of common therapeutic skills in teletherapy 
compared to in-person therapy is reported by psychotherapists (20). 
These  skills  include  the  use  of  various  therapeutic  techniques, 
intentional silence, empathy, emotional expression, and conversational 
tone. Undoubtedly, there is an urgent need for training in teletherapy 
(21) to improve the confidence of psychotherapists.

In  a  more  positive  light,  acceptability  in  neuropsychological 
practice is good despite some limitations for forensic neuropsychology 
practice (22), or regarding healthcare disparities (23). Moreover, a 
study has found potential for improving veteran’s self-care skills but 
insists  on  the  need  to  increase  access  to  telehealth  for  all  (24). 
Importantly, there is a satisfaction with videoconference-delivered 
CBT for children and adolescents (21). Sessions are shorter and easier 
to schedule, and team meetings are efficient (12). Surprisingly, older 
generations were less reluctant to accept teletherapy than expected 
(20), and techniques that were thought to be reserved for in-person 
sessions can be incorporated in teletherapy (25).

3.2. Positive opinion on psychodynamic 
teletherapy and teleanalysis

It appears that psychodynamic therapists or psychoanalysts have 
had  a  more  positive  opinion  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  online 
sessions  since 
the  pandemic  began,  psychotherapists  and 
psychoanalysts based in China being more positive than those based 
in the US (26). First-person accounts of psychoanalysts were published 
(27–29),  and  clinicians  started  to  use  the  term  “teleanalysis,” 
comparing  the  impact  of  physical  distance  on  psychoanalytic 
treatment to that of the couch (30, 31). In psychodynamic therapy, 
whether online or in person, the most important aspects of treatment 
effectiveness are the same: the therapist’s empathy, warmth, wisdom, 
and skillfulness and patient’s motivation, insightfulness, and level of 
functioning  (32).  Additionally,  experts  in  accelerated  experiential 
dynamic  psychotherapy  have  developed  specific  techniques  to 
be applied in an online setting, and they insisted on the need to take 
more time with patients starting therapy online to discuss the rules 
regarding the setting, stability, and privacy (33). Interestingly, studies 
have found greater conversational, relaxed and simultaneously more 
directive  attitude  during  online  sessions  (31,  34).  Limitations  are 
found in an Argentinian study insisting that telepsychotherapy is more 
exhausting than in-person psychotherapy and that an improvement 
of technical conditions and privacy during sessions are needed (35).

3.3. Benefits and challenges of teletherapy 
for couples and families

Couples and marriage and family therapists identified benefits for 
patients  living  in  rural  areas  and  underserved  populations,  and 
teletherapy  eases  the  logistics  involved  in  making  childcare 
arrangements, which facilitates access to care for working parents (36). 
Advantages  of  teletherapy  reported  by  clinicians  included  the 
reduction of expenses, increase in personal time, improved access to 
meetings, improved accessibility, and flexibility (37). An analysis of 
existing  data  collected  from  two  university  marriage  and  family 

therapy training programs in the US found that most cases converted 
to  teletherapy  and  that  “the  number  of  prior  in-person  sessions 
attended significantly predicted conversion to teletherapy” (38). It is 
consistent with a survey of therapists in an organization that provided 
more  than  35,000  virtual  sessions  of  Functional  Family  Therapy 
between March and September 2020 worldwide which found similar 
rates  for  treatment  completion,  number  of  sessions,  and  therapist 
fidelity between 2019 and 2020, suggesting that teletherapy is a viable 
alternative to in-person session (39). Another study found that in 
most cases, the shift to online sessions during the pandemic was not 
a threat to the therapeutic relationship, although patients reported to 
their therapists that “it felt different.” There was agreement among 80 
percent of participants that teletherapy offers good quality of care (40).
While the shift to telepsychotherapy was positive overall, there are 
barriers to teletherapy with couples such as violence, severe MDs, and 
suicidal ideation (41). Importantly, couples and family teletherapy are 
not indicated in the case of family conflict, especially if it implies 
children in the home would not be supervised during the session (36). 
There are challenges for certain populations and specific pathologies 
requiring in-person treatment: “Physical medicine and rehabilitation, 
antisocial  personality  disorder,  traumatic  brain  injury,  and  family 
conflict  were  associated  with  the  lowest  increases  in  teletherapy 
uptake” (36). Couples and marriage and family therapists expressed 
concerns  regarding  digital  exclusion,  fatigue,  isolation,  lack  of 
motivation for some patients, disruptions in the flow of therapy, and 
many other difficulties regarding the use of therapeutic techniques or 
resources  (37).  More  precisely,  therapists  experienced  discomfort, 
such as eyestrain, blurred vision, and motion sickness, to the extent 
that several of them doubted their ability to continue providing online 
sessions full time, given the increase in emotional vulnerability and 
experiences of fatigue and low energy (42).

The  Family  Institute  at  Northwestern  University  launched  its 
teletherapy services in 2018 and made an important contribution to 
the field. Notably, they insisted on the preparation of the therapist’s 
office, which is visible on clients’ screens: “While there may be value 
to ‘humanizing’ a therapist through what the environment discloses 
about them personally, some content may be problematic. Such details 
force a client to interact with the therapist’s personal life in a way that 
may  be  activating  and,  depending  on  the  client  and  the  personal 
information  communicated,  may  violate  boundaries  and  basic 
standards  for  professionalism”  (40).  A  ritual  for  entering  into  a 
therapeutic mindset is recommended on both sides, as well as creating 
an environment that ensures privacy (e.g., a family member should 
not enter the room) and reduces distractions (e.g., pets), including 
using  a  full-screen  browser  window  during  sessions.  Eye  contact 
might also be a problem. Even when the therapist looks at the camera, 
the patient might feel that the therapist’s gaze is directed above or 
below their face. The biggest challenge encountered was teletherapy 
with  children,  where  considerable  adaptation  was  required,  and 
difficulty  maintaining  their  attention  was  a  recurrent  issue.  An 
efficient strategy with children with ADHD was to provide frequent 
5-min  breaks.  With  young  children,  it  is  advised  that  session  not 
exceed 30 min and that the camera show the entire room to allow the 
child to move around and be seen playing. Teens have shown some 
creativity in ensuring their privacy, including asking their parents to 
take a walk during their sessions, having sessions in their parents’ 
parked car, using a noise generator placed outside of their room, or 
using headphones, which also contributes to creating rituals for the 
session. Interestingly, many teens appreciated multiple short sessions

rather than only one long session. Couples teletherapy was challenging 
during the pandemic, especially in cases of domestic violence; many 
patients wanted to talk, but they were also afraid of the consequences 
after the end of the virtual session. In couples and family therapy, the 
online setting necessitates clients speak one at a time, which is a major 
difference compared to in-person sessions (40).

3.4. Mental disorders and 
telepsychotherapy: significant challenges 
for special-needs children, first-episode 
psychosis, older patients, and vulnerable 
groups

Teletherapy seemed to benefit anxious autism spectrum disorder 
patients, who found it less invasive, and those who worked considered 
it easier to integrate into their schedule, though others recognized 
challenges  in  conducting  therapy  this  way.  There  are  technical 
difficulties and internet-connection issues, which do not amount to a 
limitation to its use, per se, but they are a barrier for special-needs 
children  with  significant  mental  health  issues  and  intellectual 
disabilities (43).

According to a Canadian research, digital health can become a 
standard  delivery  mode  for  trauma  therapy  (44).  Benefits  include 
equity of access to care and stigma reduction; however, technological 
and reimbursement issues will need to be addressed if a generalized 
digital health system becomes the new normal. Although US clinicians 
taking care of veterans also found a limitation regarding considerations 
for cognitive functioning, especially for older patients (45), teletherapy 
for veterans is considered feasible, acceptable, effective, and adaptable 
beyond the pandemic period.

Two studies show difficulties in accessing mental health services for 
ethnic minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with 
Adverse  Childhood  Experiences  (46),  and  challenges  for  vulnerable 
groups (lower socioeconomic conditions, Medicaid beneficiaries, and 
those who seek couple and family therapy) as well as access to technology, 
housing, childcare, and need for training for professionals (47).

Significant  challenges  have  been  reported  with  children  with 
attentional difficulties in Germany (48) a result consistent with what 
is observed in the US (21). Additionally, several systemic therapists 
offering couples teletherapy in the US mentioned having difficulty 
working with children online due to their short attention spans (42).
Finally, a survey on early intervention services for first-episode 
psychosis during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec 
found limitations regarding clinicians’ levels of ease with teletherapy, 
as  well  as  lack  of  technical  support  and  availability  of  telehealth 
equipment (49).

4. Discussion

motion sickness, emotional vulnerability, and isolation (18, 21, 34, 37, 
42, 51). The issue of being forced into teletherapy, both on the side of 
patients and therapists, was discussed (20, 38, 52) and should not 
be  disregarded.  Among  the  barriers,  concerns  over  a  lack  of 
confidentiality and privacy were mentioned often by patients who 
were reluctant to use teletherapy. Additionally, the possibility that a 
patient  could  identify  the  home  address  of  their  therapist  is  an 
important matter, as this could threaten the safety of teletherapists.

There are difficulties in cases of family conflict, where there is a 
duty  to  report  child  abuse  and  suicidality  in  minor  patients  and 
geriatric populations. It is also difficult to identify neglect or abuse if 
someone is only treated through teletherapy, especially in cases of, for 
example, physically impaired and vulnerable populations (36, 47, 53). 
Family therapy and therapy for psychotic symptoms, severe anxiety, 
trauma, or individuals in crisis is less suited to online sessions (12).

This  review  was  conceived  as  a  first  overview  of  an  unexplored 
subject and was not intended to be exhaustive. A systematic review of the 
literature is necessary with a more varied choice of keywords, allowing 
for the inclusion of relevant articles that were not discussed in our mini-
review. In addition, some articles were surveys that took place during the 
first wave and are therefore likely not generalizable beyond that.

There are general limitations of many studies that focus on a small 
and sometimes heterogeneous sample of respondents. Many articles that 
supposedly focused on MDs did not discuss the specific impact on each 
MD as experienced by patients; rather, they focus on the delivery of 
services, acceptability, training, and guidelines. In fact, little is known 
about the impact of the online setting on the treatment of first-episode 
psychosis (49), eating disorders (54) or developmental disorders (50). An 
exception was found in a work on trauma therapy, which reported a 
barrier to teletherapy for PTSD patients with cognitive impairment (44). 
Notably,  the  presence  of  parents  is  necessary  for  children  with 
developmental disorders (50), which might be considered a regression in 
the psychoanalytical therapy process, which, for instance, sometimes 
helps a parent and child to separate from each other.

Patients receiving therapy online while staying at home might 
express their satisfaction, saying that their anxiety about going out is 
reduced and they feel more in control. These aspects were reported as 
beneficial, but they could be considered drawbacks as well; avoiding 
going outside does not do much for the treatment of social anxiety 
disorders, and being more in control could result in a reinforcement 
of defense mechanisms or an increase in OCD symptoms.

This mini-review was limited to a Pubmed search and should 
be considered as a preliminary step towards a systematic review of 
the literature including other keywords and databases. From this 
point  of  view,  it  would  be  interesting  if  the  diversity  of 
psychotherapists and the laws that govern their practice around the 
world were considered. Indeed, online practice has challenged state 
boundaries more than ever before, which is a positive development, 
but raises many clinical, legal (55, 56) and ethical questions that are 
crucial to the profession.

Most  of  the  studies  were  the  first  of  their  kind,  given  the 
unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for 
teletherapy  to  be  implemented  very  rapidly  after  the  start  of  the 
pandemic and the related lockdowns. More than ever, studies have 
insisted that teletherapy is more demanding than face-to-face therapy 
(35, 44, 50), hence the need for self-care practices for the well-being 
of therapists (17, 33). Teletherapy has a cost for therapists: mental 
fatigue,  physical  symptoms,  such  as  eyestrain,  blurred  vison,  and 

5. Conclusion

This review of the literature reveals important qualitative feedback 
from therapists of diverse horizons regarding how online sessions have 
become embedded in therapy practice. The use of teletherapy does not 
seem to be transient, nor does it depend on the COVID-19 pandemic. It 
appears that acceptability is relatively good from the point of view of both

patients and therapists, and it seems that we are witnessing a generalization 
of  hybrid  practices  in  mental  health.  A  possible  problem  with 
telepsychotherapy  and  teleconsultations  is  how  they  will  be  used  by 
ministries of health at the global level. It is feared that online consultations 
will be imposed for supposedly cost-saving reasons. Not all conditions are 
suitable for teleconsultation, and in some cases, therapists and patients 
want  to  see  each  other  in  person.  In  other  words,  we  fear  a  loss  of 
therapeutic  effects  if  telepsychotherapy  becomes  “the  new  normal”; 
however, hybrid practice is desired by most therapists and patients. Future 
studies  should  examine  the  effectiveness  of  the  different  therapy 
modalities by comparing three groups of patients: one receiving in-person 
therapy only, one receiving telepsychotherapy only, and one receiving 
hybrid services. Finally, the rise of telepsychotherapy might be summed 
up by a paradoxical sentence that is of great significance in the history of 
clinical practice: keeping in touch (37) while losing touch (57).
