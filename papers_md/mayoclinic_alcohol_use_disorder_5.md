You're likely to start by seeing your primary health care provider. If your provider suspects that you have a problem with alcohol, you may be referred to a mental health provider.

To assess your problem with alcohol, your provider will likely:

- Ask you some questions related to your drinking habits.The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.

- Perform a physical exam.Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.

- Suggest lab tests and imaging tests.While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test results may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.

- Complete a psychological evaluation.This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to complete a questionnaire to help answer these questions.

Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.

Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include:

- Detox and withdrawal.Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.

- Learning new skills and making a treatment plan.This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.

- Psychological counseling.Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.

- Oral medications.A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.Naltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.

- Injected medication.Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.

- Continuing support.Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.

- Treatment for psychological problems.Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.

- Medical treatment for health conditions.Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.

- Spiritual practice.People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.


### Residential treatment programs


For serious alcohol use disorder, you may need a stay at a residential treatment facility. Most residential treatment programs include individual and group therapy, support groups, educational lectures, family involvement, and activity therapy.

Residential treatment programs typically include licensed alcohol and drug counselors, social workers, nurses, doctors, and others with expertise and experience in treating alcohol use disorder.

## Alternative medicine


Avoid replacing conventional medical treatment or psychotherapy with alternative medicine. But if used in addition to your treatment plan when recovering from alcohol use disorder, these techniques may be helpful:

- Yoga.Yoga's series of postures and controlled breathing exercises may help you relax and manage stress.

- Meditation.During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress.

- Acupuncture.With acupuncture, hair-thin needles are inserted under the skin. Acupuncture may help reduce anxiety and depression.


## Lifestyle and home remedies


As part of your recovery, you'll need to focus on changing your habits and making different lifestyle choices. These strategies may help:

- Consider your social situation.Make it clear to your friends and family that you're not drinking alcohol. Develop a support system of friends and family who can support your recovery. You may need to distance yourself from friends and social situations that impair your recovery.

- Develop healthy habits.For example, good sleep, regular physical activity, managing stress more effectively and eating well all can make it easier for you to recover from alcohol use disorder.

- Do things that don't involve alcohol.You may find that many of your activities involve drinking. Replace them with hobbies or activities that are not centered around alcohol.


## Coping and support


Many people with alcohol problems and their family members find that participating in support groups is an essential part of coping with the disease, preventing or dealing with relapses, and staying sober. Your health care provider or counselor can suggest a support group. These groups are also often listed on the web.

Here are a few examples:

- Alcoholics Anonymous.Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help group for people recovering from alcoholism. AA offers a sober peer group and is built around 12 steps as an effective model for achieving total abstinence.

- Women for Sobriety.Women for Sobriety is a nonprofit organization offering a self-help group program for women who want to overcome alcoholism and other addictions. It focuses on developing coping skills related to emotional and spiritual growth, self-esteem, and a healthy lifestyle.

- Al-Anon and Alateen.Al-Anon is designed for people who are affected by someone else's alcoholism. Alateen groups are available for teenage children of those with alcoholism. In sharing their stories, family members gain a greater understanding of how the disease affects the entire family.

- Celebrate Recovery.Celebrate Recovery is a Christ-centered, 12-step recovery program for people struggling with addiction.

- SMART Recovery.SMART Recovery offers mutual support meetings for people seeking science-based, self-empowered addiction recovery.
