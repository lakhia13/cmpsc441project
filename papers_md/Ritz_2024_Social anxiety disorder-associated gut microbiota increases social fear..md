Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a crippling psychiatric disorder characterized by intense 
fear or anxiety in social situations and their avoidance. However, the underlying biology 
of SAD is unclear and better treatments are needed. Recently, the gut microbiota has 
emerged as a key regulator of both brain and behaviour, especially those related to social 
function. Moreover, increasing data supports a role for immune function and oxytocin 
signalling in social responses. To investigate whether the gut microbiota plays a causal 
role in modulating behaviours relevant to SAD, we transplanted the microbiota from 
SAD patients, which was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing to be of a differential 
composition compared to healthy controls, to mice. Although the mice that received 
the SAD microbiota had normal behaviours across a battery of tests designed to assess 
depression and general anxiety- like behaviours, they had a specific heightened sensitivity 
to social fear, a model of SAD. This distinct heightened social fear response was coupled 
with changes in central and peripheral immune function and oxytocin expression in the 
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. This work demonstrates an interkingdom basis for 
social fear responses and posits the microbiome as a potential therapeutic target for SAD.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by intense 
fear or anxiety in social scenarios. The onset of SAD typically occurs early in life (childhood 
or adolescence), and it frequently has a lifelong impact being associated with considerable 
functional disability and reduced quality of life (1–4). Current pharmacological treatment 
options for SAD are limited and often ineffective, and new models are necessary to under­
stand the underlying etiology and treatment targets (5). Recent data have implicated the 
gut microbiota in brain and behavioural function related to social processes across the 
animal  kingdom  (6).  Intriguingly,  we  recently  showed  that  patients  with  SAD  have  a 
different microbiota composition than age- matched healthy controls (HC) (7). However, 
such correlative analysis requires insight to understand whether the compositional changes 
observed may be mechanistically related to social fear or anxiety. To test causal mechanisms, 
faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) studies have emerged as an effective technique 
to understand how the microbiota can potentially elicit phenotypic changes in the host. 
Furthermore,  our  approach  adheres  to  both  the  recommended  practice  and  to  the 
Guidelines for Reporting on Animal Faecal Transplantation (GRAFT) (8, 9). Previous 
research in major depression, anxiety comorbid with irritable bowel syndrome and schiz­
ophrenia, show that transfer of the microbiota via FMT is sufficient to transfer selective 
psychological  and  physiological  traits  of  these  disorders,  including  depression-   and 
anxiety- like behaviour, to the recipient (10–15).

To further elucidate the role of the microbiota in SAD, we designed a translational 
study to test the hypothesis that the microbiota may play a causal role in promoting host 
social fear behaviour (Fig. 1A). Faecal inocula from individual HC and SAD donors were 
anaerobically processed for cryogenic storage and later use whereby adult male C57Bl/6J 
mice  received  FMT  from  each  donor  (Fig. 1B).  Following  antibiotic  depletion  of  the 
microbiota, mice received the specified donor FMT, and were subsequently tested for 
social fear, sociability, social cognition, and stress- coping behaviours, as well as gastroin­
testinal transit and motility (Fig. 1C).

Results

Social  Anxiety  Disorder  Leads  to  Alterations  in  the  Bacteriome.  Gut  microbiota 
composition was characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing performed on microbial DNA 
extracted from stool from individuals with SAD and matched HC (Fig. 1D). This analysis 

Significance

Understanding the biological 
basis of social anxiety disorder 
(SAD), one of the most disabling 
of the anxiety disorders, will 
allow for novel treatment 
strategies to be developed. Here, 
we show that gut microbiota may 
be such a target. Mice that 
received SAD patient microbiota 
had a specific heightened 
sensitivity to social fear without 
affecting other behaviours 
tested. This distinct deficit in 
normal social fear responses was 
coupled with changes in 
immunity and the brain.

confirmed a distinct compositional difference as noted previously 
based on a metagenomic analysis (R2 = 0.03477, P < 0.05, 1,000 
permutations) (7). We selected six SAD and six HC individuals 
based  on  host  parameters  and  metrics  including  microbiota, 
Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale score, age, body mass index, sex, 
and an absence of psychotropic or microbiota medications (i.e., 
antidepressants, anxiolytics, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, etc.; 
SI Appendix, Table S2). In addition to measuring the bacteriome 
(the collective bacterial genome) which makes up  the majority 
of the active portion of the microbiome, we also measured the 
virome (the collective viral genome) which is primarily made up 
of bacteriophages that specifically infect bacteria (16).

Murine  recipient  bacteriome  beta  diversity  was  significantly 
altered between SAD and HC groups measured at the end of the 
study (Fig. 1E; R2 = 0.02767, P < 0.001, 1,000 permutations). There 
were three bacterial species that were differentially abundant in the 
SAD and HC groups at the end of the study, Bacteroides nordii, 
Bacteroides cellulosiyticus, and Phocaeicola massiliensi (SI Appendix, 
Fig. S1 A–C). No group differences were found in alpha diversity 
metrics at the end of the study (Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson; 
SI Appendix,  Fig. S1  D–F),  but  each  alpha  diversity  metric  was 
reduced at the end of study compared to the pretreatment measures 
(SI Appendix,  Fig. S1 G–I).  However,  no  group  differences  were 
observed  in  virome  alpha  or  beta  diversity  metrics  (SI Appendix, 
Fig. S2).  This  alteration  in  bacteriome  community  composition 
confirms that the FMT from SAD and HC donors led to differential 
microbiotas recolonizing and engrafting following antibiotic micro­
biota depletion.

Social Anxiety Disorder Faecal Microbiota Transplant Specifically 
Increases Sensitivity to Social Fear. Social fear, sociability, anxiety- 
like, and stress- coping behaviours were assessed in mice following 
recolonization with SAD or HC microbiota. Social fear conditioning 
was applied followed by extinction learning on the next day whereby 
social behaviour was measured by interaction time during repeated 
exposure to nonsocial and novel social stimuli (Fig. 1F). There was 
a significant reduction in social interaction over the 6 social stimuli 
trials  (W(1)  =  3.239,  P  <  0.05)  and  no  difference  in  nonsocial 
investigatory behaviour. This reduction in social fear extinction rate 
provides evidence that the SAD microbiota is capable of increasing 
sensitivity to social fear stimuli. However, general sociability and 
social novelty preference were not affected by SAD FMT (Fig. 1 
G and H and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 C and D). Furthermore, other 
tests of stress- coping behaviours and gastrointestinal transit were 
similarly  unaffected  (SI  Appendix,  Fig.  S3  A–F),  demonstrating 
that social fear sensitivity was specifically transferred by SAD FMT.

Social Anxiety Disorder Faecal Microbiota Transplant Diminishes 
Stress and Immune Function. The glucocorticoid stress hormone 
corticosterone  was  measured  in  plasma  of  mice  before  and 
after  the  forced  swim  test.  The  basal  plasma  concentration  of 
corticosterone  was  found  to  be  significantly  reduced  by  SAD 
FMT  treatment  (t(64)  =  −1.858,  P  <  0.05)  but  no  differences 
were found in corticosterone following stress (Fig. 2 A and B). 
Following euthanasia, small intestinal ileal tissue was explanted 
and  stimulated  with  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS),  concanavalin  A 
(ConA), T cell receptor clusters of differentiation 3 and 28 (CD3/
CD28),  or  vehicle  (buffer)  to  assess  gut  immune  function  in 
response to paradigmatic antigens between groups. Inflammatory 
cytokine supernatant concentration from the ileal tissue explants 
was then assessed. The SAD group displayed reduced IL- 17A in 
response to stimulation by LPS (t(30) = −2.297, P < 0.05) and 
ConA  (t(32)  =  −2.457,  P  <  0.05)  and  trends  for  reduced  IL- 
17A in the vehicle (t(32) = −1.804, P = 0.081) and CD3/CD28 

stimulation  (t(30)  =  −1.813,  P  =  0.100)  (Fig.  3A).  Mesenteric 
lymph nodes (MLNs) and blood were also harvested, and immune 
cell  populations  were  assessed  using  flow  cytometry.  In  the 
MLNs, F4/80+ macrophages were significantly reduced (t(30) = 
−2.602, P < 0.05) following SAD FMT while there was a trend 
for T helper cells to be increased following SAD FMT (t(34) = 
1.953, P = 0.079) (Fig. 3 B and C). Within the blood immune 
cell population, there was reduced CD4+ T helper cells  in the 
SAD  group  (t(34)  =  −2.049,  P  <  0.05)  (Fig.  3D).  These  data 
indicate  that  the  SAD  microbiota  transfer  reduced  circulating 
stress hormone and peripheral immunity.

Next, to discern how central immunity was affected, neuroinflam­
matory-  and blood–brain barrier–related gene expression was meas­
ured  in  the  bed  nucleus  of  the  stria  terminalis  (BNST),  medial 
amygdala (MeA), and medial prefrontal cortex (MePFC). Arginase 
1 (Arg1) expression was depleted across all three regions tested (BNST, 
MeA, and MePFC) following SAD FMT (t(43) = −3.927, P < 0.001; 
t (43) = −3.241, P < 0.01, t(42) = −3.55, P < 0.001, respectively) 
(Fig. 3E). In the MeA, tumour necrosis factor alpha (Tnf- α; t(35) = 
−2.081, P < 0.05), interleukin 10 (Il- 10; t(36) = −2.342, P < 0.05), 
and chemokine C- X- C ligand 15 (Cxcl15; t(38) = −2.137, P < 0.05) 
were all reduced (Fig. 3E). In the MePFC, Toll- like receptor 4 (Tlr4) 
was also reduced (t(40) = −2.839, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3E). Then, blood–
brain barrier–related genes were measured and the MeA showed the 
most significant reductions in tight junction protein 1 (Tjp1; t(43) 
= −3.033, P < 0.01), claudin 5 (Cldn5; t(41) = −2.601, P < 0.05), 
and occludin (Ocln; t(42) = −1.811, P = 0.08) (Fig. 3F). There was 
an additional trend for reduced Ocln in the BNST (t(43) = −1.901, 
P = 0.06) and a reduction of Tjp1 expression in the MePFC (t(41) 
= −2.473, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3F). These data show that neuroinflamma­
tory markers are altered and blood–brain barrier function is impaired 
by SAD FMT. This further demonstrates that the SAD microbiota 
is capable of far- reaching immunomodulatory effects.

Reduced  Neuronal  Oxytocin  in  the  Bed  Nucleus  of  the  Stria 
Terminalis  and  Oxytocin- related  Gene  Expression  in  the 
Medial  Amygdala  and  Prefrontal  Cortex  Are  Associated  with 
Increased  Social  Fear.  Oxytocin,  an  extensive  neuropeptide 
governing social behaviour, was measured in the paraventricular 
nucleus  (PVN),  supraoptic  nucleus  (SON),  and  the  BNST  by 
immunohistochemistry.  These  brain  regions  have  been  shown 
to play key roles in directing social behaviour through oxytocin 
generation and signalling. The regions were stained for oxytocin 
(Oxt) containing neurons (NeuN) in HC and SAD FMT recipients 
(representative images of the BNST are shown in Fig. 4 A and B, 
PVN SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B, and SON SI Appendix, Fig. S4 
D  and  E).  No  differences  were  observed  in  either  the  PVN  or 
SON (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C and F), but there was a significant 
reduction  in  Oxt  neurons  in  the  BNST  (t(17)  =  −2.369,  P  < 
0.05) (Fig. 3C). This result indicates that the BNST is sensitive 
to the SAD microbiota transfer and is associated with social fear 
behaviour.

Next,  oxytocin-   and  vasopressin- related  gene  expression  was 
measured in the BNST, MeA, and MePFC to assess potential tran­
scription level alterations between SAD and HC FMT recipient 
groups. No statistically significant effects were identified in oxy­
tocin gene (Oxt) or receptor expression (Oxtr) in the BNST, but 
there were reductions in both genes in the MeA (t(34) = −2.455, 
P < 0.05; t(40) = −2.143, P < 0.05, respectively) and reduced Oxtr 
in  the  MePFC  (t(40)  =  −2.419,  P  <  0.05).  There  was  reduced 
vasopressin receptor 1a (Avpr1a) in the MePFC (t(42) = −3.184, 
P < 0.01) in addition to trends for reduced Avpr1a in the MeA 
(t(41) = −1.895, P = 0.07) and reduced vasopressin receptor 1b 
(Avpr1b) in the BNST (t(41) = −2.115, P = 0.06). Taken together,

Fig. 1. Human gut microbiota from social anxiety disorder (SAD) promotes social fear behaviour in mice but does not alter other general social behaviours. (A) 
In order to test whether the microbiota plays a causal role in SAD, the microbiota of individuals with SAD was transferred by faecal microbiota transplantation 
(FMT) to rodent recipients to assess phenotypic characteristics compared to FMT from healthy control. (B) Study diagram and human donor and rodent recipient 
group legend, male (m) and female (f). (C) Experimental design: animals first received an antibiotic cocktail (Abx) for 1 wk to deplete the resident microbiota, 
before  receiving  FMTs,  and  behavioural  assessment  (elevated  plus  maze—EPM,  three- chamber  test—3CT,  carmine  red  gastrointestinal  transit  and  motility 
test—CR, social fear conditioning—SFC, and forced swim test—FST). Faecal samples were collected and microbiota analysed at the beginning and end of study. 
Corticosterone was measured before and after the FST. At the end of the study animals were killed, tissue was collected; then flow cytometry, and ileal explants 
were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, and CD3/CD28. (D) Aitchison beta diversity of SAD human faecal microbiota clustered differentially 
compared to healthy controls (R2 = 0.03477, P < 0.05, 1,000 permutations). Donors (indicated by the faecal symbol) were selected based on microbiota, Liebowitz 
Social Anxiety Scale score, age, body mass index, sex, and an absence of psychotropic or microbiota medications to treat SAD. (E) Murine faecal bacteriome beta 
diversity was significantly different between SAD and HC groups at the end of the study (R2 = 0.02767, P < 0.001, 1,000 permutations). (F) Diagram represents social 
fear conditioning and social fear extinction, which takes place over two days. Social fear behaviour is increased in mice that receive SAD FMT (W(1) = 3.239, P < 0.05). 
Social fear extinction data showing interaction percent with either nonsocial stimulus (ns1- 3) or six novel social stimuli (s1- 6). Transparent lines represent each

represent the three- chamber social interaction test. Following habituation, sociability was assessed by preference for a novel social stimulus over an inanimate, 
nonsocial object (rubber duck), then social novelty preference was assessed by preference for a novel conspecific over the now- familiar conspecific used in the 
sociability phase. There were no significant group differences in sociability; both groups spent significantly more time interacting with the social (Soc) stimulus 
over the nonsocial (Non) stimulus (t(68) = 12.01, 11.64, P < 0.001). (H) There were no significant group differences in social novelty preference; both groups spent 
significantly more time interacting with the novel (Nov) over the familiar (Fam) social stimulus (t(68) = 3.158, P < 0.01; t(68) = 2.513, P < 0.05) (n = 35 per group).

90 min. The forced swim test (stress stimulus) took place from 5 min to 11 min (total duration of stress was 6 min). There was a significantly lower concentration 
of plasma corticosterone at the basal timepoint (0 min) in the SAD compared to HC group and no significant effects at the 30- , 60- , or 90- min time points.

these data reveal alterations in oxytocin-  and vasopressin- related 
gene expression across these brain regions following SAD micro­
biota transfer to mice.

Discussion

Understanding the biological basis of complex disorders such as 
SAD is an important endeavor in psychiatric research. Here, we 
build on correlational observational studies to causally implicate 
a role for the microbiome in behaviours relevant to SAD.

At the microbiome level, we show that the beta- diversity micro­
biota composition alterations observed in human patients with SAD 
are similar to the beta- diversity found to be different in recipient 
mice administered SAD or HC faecal microbiota from the selected 
human donors. Additionally, there were bacterial species that were 
differentially abundant across the murine groups. Bacteroides nordii 
was reduced in SAD compared to HC. Previously, this species has 
been negatively correlated with neurodevelopmental behaviour syn­
dromes (18). Bacteroides cellulosilyticus was reduced in SAD com­
pared to HC, and accompanying B. nordii, higher relative abundances

P = 0.07; n = 20–22 per group). In the MePFC there were reductions in Oxtr (t(40) = −2.419, P < 0.05) and Avpr1a (t(42) = −3.184, P < 0.01; n = 21–22 per group).

have been associated with fewer symptoms in hyperactivity, impul­
sivity, and inattention (DSM-  HD and AD scores) (19). Phocaeicola 
massiliensis (formerly Bacteroides massiliensis) was increased in SAD 
compared to HC and has been linked with posttraumatic stress dis­
order (20) and prolonged social isolation stress (21). These microbi­
ota  alterations  indicate  that  there  are  microbial  community  and 
specific bacterial taxa differentially transferred to recipient mice by 
FMT from SAD compared to HC donors, resulting in transfer of a 
social fear–sensitive phenotype to the recipients.

Social fear conditioning and extinction is a rodent behavioural 
test specifically designed to model the development and treatment 
of SAD. Pavlovian conditioning is used to first induce social- specific 
fear and then measure the rate at which fear diminishes in response 
to repeated exposure to different social cues (22). Following social 
fear conditioning, there was a significant reduction in social inter­
action in the SAD group compared to the HC group (as measured 
the next day, during social fear extinction), indicating that a SAD 
microbiota  transfer  is  capable  of  intensifying  the  social  fear 
response. These effects are specific to social fear as there was no 
difference between groups in sociability or social novelty prefer­
ence measured in the three- chamber test. This fits well with recent 
research  indicating  that  a  substantial  proportion  of  individuals 
with SAD report normal (or even high) levels of extraversion and 
novelty- seeking/openness to new experiences, despite their anxiety 
about  social  situations  (23,  24).  Given  that  the  hypothalamic 
pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, immune and oxytocin systems have 
been implicated in social fear responses (25–27), we next assessed 
whether the SAD recipient group also exhibited changes in these 
systems as a result of the FMT.

There was a significant reduction in plasma corticosterone meas­
ured before stress in the SAD group but no difference in the stress 
hormone  at  timepoints  following  stress.  In  the  SAD  patient 

cohort, there was also a reduction of circulating antiinflammatory 
cytokine Il- 10 compared to HC (28). To assess gut immune func­
tion following activation, we stimulated ileal explants with LPS, 
ConA, and CD3/CD28, the latter two (ConA and CD3/CD28) 
induce  T  cell  activation.  We  observed  that  interleukin- 17A 
(IL- 17A) was reduced in the SAD group ileal tissue explants stim­
ulated with LPS and ConA, and there were trends for reduction 
following vehicle and CD3/CD28 stimulation compared to the 
HC group. IL- 17A is a proinflammatory cytokine that is induced 
by  infection,  stress,  and  trauma  (29).  Following  perturbation, 
IL- 17A is involved in sensory response, T cell activation, and neu­
trophil mobilisation in various tissues (30–32). Moreover, IL- 17A 
has been shown to rescue sociability deficits in mice exposed to 
maternal immune activation during embryogenesis (33). In the 
SAD FMT recipient animal MLNs, there was a significant reduc­
tion in F4/80+ macrophages and a trend for an increase in the 
relative number of CD4+ T helper cells. This fits with the migra­
tion of macrophages away from the MLNs previously observed 
following  chronic  stress  and  microbiota  perturbation  (34). 
Furthermore, there was a reduction of CD44 receptors on circu­
lating CD4+ T helper cells in the SAD group, indicating inade­
quate immune memory and activation following SAD microbiota 
transplant. CD44 is a T cell activation marker indicating memory 
and effector populations from naïve T cell populations and has 
been linked with enhanced IL- 17 production from T helper cells 
(35). Taken together, these data indicate that the SAD microbiota 
drives HPA- axis dysfunction coupled with a reduction of IL- 17A 
and  circulating  effector  and  memory T  helper  cells,  leading  to 
diminished immune signalling as a driving contributor to the SAD 
phenotype.

The neuropeptide oxytocin is a key modulator within the limbic 
system and has been shown to be critically involved in the circuitry

mediating  various  social  behaviours,  including  stress- induced 
defensive and social coping responses (36–38). Oxytocin can elicit 
diverse effects in various brain regions mediated by circuit- specific 
actions which are further complicated by differences across sex, 
species, and models (39–43). Oxytocin receptors in the BNST 
are  activated  by  PVN  and  SON  projections  which  have  been 
shown to play a role in fear learning and memory (44). Therefore, 
using immunohistochemistry, we next investigated the levels of 
oxytocin  within  the  hypothalamic  PVN,  SON,  as  well  as  the 
BNST  connecting  the  limbic  forebrain  to  hypothalamic  and 
brainstem regions. No differences in oxytocin- containing neurons 
were observed in the PVN and SON; however, a significant reduc­
tion was observed in the BNST.

In addition to immunohistochemistry, we also measured genes 
responsible for oxytocin, oxytocin receptor (Oxtr), and vasopres­
sin receptors 1a and 1b (Avpr1a and Avpr1b) in the BNST and 
other brain areas related to social fear behaviour-  the MeA and 
MePFC.  Oxytocin  and  vasopressin  are  both  well  known  for 
playing roles in social behaviour and interestingly, we found a 
trend  for  a  reduction  of  Avpr1b  expression  in  the  BNST. 
Disruption  of  Avpr1b  has  specifically  been  shown  to  reduce 
social memory and aggression in mice (45–47). Furthermore, 
broad  inhibition  of  Avpr1b  with  the  antagonist  SSR149415 
partially attenuated the effects of social defeat on social anxio­
genic behaviour indicating complex regional responsiveness and 
effectiveness  (48).  Since  oxytocin  and  vasopressin  have  been 
shown to modulate pro-  and antisocial behaviour, respectively, 
our data suggest that the BNST is a particularly sensitive region 
to SAD microbiota transfer to mice. However, the BNST is a 
complex structure that orchestrates emotional and behavioural 
responses  to  stress  (49)  by  connecting  to  other  brain  regions 
involved in social circuitry and has been linked to responses to 
unpredictability that can worsen social anxiety (50). It is a het­
erogenous brain area with many subregions and thus it is perhaps 
not unsurprising that there is disconnect between the data on 
oxytocin at the protein level in slices observed by immunohis­
tochemistry  versus  the  levels  of  gene  expression  in  relatively 
crude tissue punch collections.

Importantly, oxytocin released in the MeA has been shown to 
facilitate social memory formation during social encounters (51). 
Here, we found reductions in both oxytocin and oxytocin receptor 
gene expression in the MeA in addition to a trend for reduced 
Avpr1a. Moreover, it has been shown that activation of neurons 
expressing Oxtr in the MePFC have been shown to increase activ­
ity of neurons in the BNST (52) indicating region- specific cir­
cuitry capable of modulating neural activity. Our MePFC data 
show reductions in SAD microbiota recipient Oxtr and Avpr1a 
receptor gene expression, indicating that oxytocin and vasopressin 
receptor neural activity may be responsible for regional differences 
that can lead to increased sensitivity to social fear.

Next,  we  explored  the  mechanism  by  which  this  gut- derived 
FMT treatment may be exerting a behavioural effect, as we have 
observed immune modulation in ileal explants, MLNs, and blood. 
We thus chose to measure expression of neuroinflammation and 
blood–brain  barrier–related  genes  in  the  brain  regions  (BNST, 
MeA, and MePFC). Alterations in such genes have been shown 
with antibiotic or dietary interventions targeting the microbiome 
previously (53, 54). Again, we noticed regional effects with the only 
shared  gene  being  significantly  reduced  in  the  SAD  microbiota 
recipient group across all regions was arginase 1 (Arg1), a marker 
in the brain of cellular repair activation following inflammation 
(55, 56). In the MeA, there was a reduction in expression of inflam­
matory cytokine Tnf- α and Cxcl15 in addition to a reduction in 
antiinflammatory cytokine IL- 10, indicating a modulation of the 

neuroinflammatory response by SAD compared to HC microbiota 
transfer. Additionally, we observed a reduction in Tlr4 expression 
in the MePFC in the SAD FMT recipient group. This receptor is 
classically known for mediating inflammatory responses following 
endotoxin activation and knockout of this gene has been shown to 
increase anxiety- like behaviour and reduce social interaction in mice 
(57).  Additionally,  pharmacological  blockade  of Tlr4  in  murine 
prefrontal cortex has been shown to modulate visceral hypersensi­
tivity, further indicating it as a key marker of microbiota–gut–brain 
axis activity (58). Last, we measured blood–brain barrier–related 
gene markers Tjp1, Cldn5, and Ocln. Interestingly, we observed 
reductions in Cldn5 in the MeA, and Tjp1 in both the MeA and 
MePFC. Previously, it has been shown that social stress can reduce 
blood–brain  barrier  integrity  and  Cldn5  downregulation  in  the 
nucleus  accumbens,  another  region  in  the  limbic  system  linked 
with social and emotional behaviours (59, 60). These results indi­
cate that there was a reduction in tight junction network and com­
promised  barrier  integrity  following  SAD  microbiota  transfer. 
Overall, these gene expression data provide a picture of neuroin­
flammatory  and  immune  modulation  that  was  associated  with 
oxytocin and vasopressin alterations.

We next assessed the specificity of the behaviour alterations trans­
ferred by SAD FMT. There were no significant changes in anxiety- like 
behaviour in terms of time spent and entries into the open arms of 
the  elevated  plus  maze  nor  were  there  significant  changes  in 
stress- coping behaviour (measured as time spent immobile in the 
forced swim test). Gastrointestinal transit, measured by timing the 
duration of passage of carmine red following oral gavage, was also 
not different between groups. These outcomes further show that the 
SAD FMT recipients harbored very specific behavioural changes 
relevant to social fear domains with no distinguishable differences 
in other distinct social nor stress- coping behaviours, or in gastroin­
testinal function.

Taken together, our findings provide novel evidence that the 
microbiota in individuals with SAD can generate increased social 
fear that is associated with impaired peripheral immune activation 
and neuronal oxytocin within the BNST in mice. This suggests 
that the microbiota can play a causal role in heightened social fear 
responses in the disorder. Moving forward, the microbiota–gut–
brain axis is an ideal target for identifying novel therapeutics to 
improve symptoms in SAD.

Methods Summary

Here, we provide a summary of the methods important to under­
stand our study. Further details are given in SI Appendix, Materials 
and Methods.

Participants (FMT Donors). FMT donors were a subset of participants 
(18–65 y of age, male and female) recruited for our earlier descriptive 
study of the microbiota in SAD (7). Briefly, the SAD group was 
recruited  through  local  health  practitioners  and  support  groups 
or via an online website, and a primary clinical diagnosis of SAD 
was required for inclusion. The HC group were recruited through 
University College Cork and were required to have no past or current 
psychiatric diagnosis. For both groups, significant acute or chronic 
medical illness, other psychiatric illness, presence of any potentially 
confounding condition or medication, pregnancy or breastfeeding, 
and strict specific diets were considered exclusion criteria (see for 
further details ref. (7)). The final subset of FMT donors (n = 6 per 
group) were selected based on microbiota metrics, Liebowitz Social 
Anxiety Scale score, age, body mass index, sex, and an absence of 
psychotropic or microbiota medications (i.e., antibiotics, probiotics, 
prebiotics, etc.; SI Appendix, Table S2). All study procedures involving

human participants were approved by the Clinical Research Ethics 
Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals (Study number APC085) 
and the study was conducted in accordance with the ICH Guidelines 
on  Good  Clinical  Practice,  and  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki.  All 
participants provided written informed consent.

Flow  Cytometry.  Flow  cytometry  was  performed  as  previously 
described (61, 62). Trunk blood samples collected during euthanasia 
were processed on the same day before flow cytometry analysis. 
Details regarding flow cytometry immune targets, staining, and 
analysis are given in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.

Animals (FMT Recipients). This study used male C57Bl/6J mice  
(N = 72; 8 wk of age on arrival; Envigo, UK; n = 6 per donor and 
n = 36 per group). Animals were habituated for 2 wk after which 
treatments began. The holding room was under a 12- h light/dark 
cycle (7:00–19:00), with a temperature of 21 °C and humidity of 
10%. Standard rodent chow (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent 
Diet, sterilized) and water were available ad libitum throughout the 
experiments. An examination of the literature, our own publications, 
and in- house data were carried out to determine probable effect sizes 
for behavioural readouts as a consequence of social fear conditioning 
and  faecal  microbiota  transplantation.  Comprehensive  power 
analyses (α = 0.05, power = 80%) were performed to determine the 
minimum number of animals required for each of the studies in this 
project to ensure preclinically and clinically relevant findings. All 
procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with the 
European Directive 2010/63/EC, the requirements of the S.I. No 
543 of 2012 and approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics 
Committee of University College Cork and the Health Products 
Regulatory  Authority  (HPRA  AE19130  P118).  Procedures  are 
reported in line with the Guidelines for Reporting on Animal Faecal 
Transplantation (GRAFT) Framework (9).

Antibiotic  Treatment.  At  the  start  of  the  study,  mice  were 
placed on an antibiotic cocktail consisting of ampicillin (1 g/L), 
vancomycin  (0.5  g/L),  imipenem  (0.25  g/L),  and  vancomycin  
(1 g/L; all from Discovery Fine Chemicals, UK). This was prepared 
fresh every second day and administered to all animals ad libitum 
in the drinking water for 7 d to deplete the resident microbiota 
(see Fig. 1C for experimental timeline).

Faecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT). SAD and HC faecal inocula 
were prepared for FMT within four hours of production. Samples 
were  stored  in  an  airtight  container  with  an  AnaeroGen  sachet 
(Oxoid  AGS  AnaeroGen  Compact,  Fischer  Scientific,  Ireland) 
to  maintain  an  anaerobic  environment  during  transport.  Upon 
arrival,  samples  were  immediately  placed  within  an  anaerobic 
cabinet,  mixed  with  sterile  reduced  phosphate  buffered  saline 
1%  (PBS)/20%  glycerol  as  cryoprotectant  (final  faecal  inocula 
concentration:  100  mg/mL),  and  manually  passed  through  a  
70- μm stomacher filter to remove large particulates. Then, samples 
were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until administered to animals. 
Animals were randomized to a specific donor and received their 
respective FMT treatment via oral gavage (100 µL) daily for three 
successive days followed by two booster FMTs per subsequent week 
for the remainder of the study (10 total FMTs).

Behavioural Testing. Ten days after the start of FMT treatments, 
mice began behavioural testing comprising of the elevated plus 
maze (EPM), three chamber sociability test (3CT), carmine red 
gastrointestinal transit and motility (CR), social fear conditioning 
(SFC), and the forced swim test (FST), with a 3 to 4- d interval 
between each test. Details regarding each behavioural test are given 
in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods. Three days after the end of 
testing, mice were killed by rapid decapitation (n = 4 per donor) or 
perfusion (n = 2 per donor, randomly allocated) and tissues were 
harvested  to  assess  the  microbiota,  brain,  and  immune  system 
function (Fig. 1C). The allocation of samples was determined by 
power calculations described above.

Immunohistochemistry  and  Microscopy.  The  paraventricular 
nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), 
and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) were sectioned 
and  stained  to  visualize  oxytocin  (Oxt)  containing  neurons 
(NeuN).  Details  regarding  collection,  immunohistochemistry, 
and microscopy are given in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.

Repeated  Blood  Sampling  for  Stress  and  Immune  Measures. 
Plasma from each animal was sampled by tail tip 5 min prior to 
the forced swim test, then thirty, sixty, and ninety minutes after 
the start of the test. The tail was securely restrained, and a diagonal 
incision was made approximately 1–2 mm from the tip of the tail. 
Approximately 40 μL of whole blood was collected in an EDTA- 
lined  capillary  tube  (Fisher  Scientific,  749311)  per  timepoint. 
Samples were deposited in an Eppendorf and centrifuged for 10 
min at 3,500 g at 4 °C. Plasma was collected and stored at −80 °C 
for later corticosterone quantification.

Corticosterone Stress Response Timeline. Corticosterone quantifi­
cation of plasma samples (10 µL) collected during FST was per­
formed using a corticosterone ELISA and carried out according to 
the manufacturer’s guidelines (Enzo Life Sciences, ADI- 901- 097). 
Samples were analysed in duplicate in a single assay, the threshold 
detection  was  less  than  32  pg/mL;  coefficient  of  variation  limit 
=  20%;  the  concentration  units  are  expressed  in  ng/mL.  Light 
absorbance was read with a multimode plate reader (Synergy HT, 
BioTek Instruments, Inc.) at 405 nm.

Ileal  Explant  Stimulations.  Ileal  tissue  explants  were  collected 
during tissue harvest, trimmed of fat, and placed in RPMI medium 
(R8758, supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (F7524, 
Sigma), and 1% penicillin- streptomycin- glutamine 100× (10378- 
016, Biosciences Ltd.). They were then treated with Red Blood Cell 
Lysis Buffer (R7757, Sigma), passed through a 70- μm filter, and 
then resuspended in fresh supplemented RPMI medium. Next,  
4 mL of cells were seeded in six- well plates at a concentration of 16 
× 106 cells/well. After a 2.5 h rest period, cells were stimulated with 
lipopolysaccharide (2 μg/mL, tlrl- eblps, Invivogen), concanavalin 
A (2.5 μg/mL, C5275, Sigma), or CD3/CD28 (CD3 -  100238, 
CD28 -  102116, Biolegend) for 24 h. Then, cell suspensions were 
harvested and centrifuged (300 g, 5 min), and supernatants were 
collected for further analysis.

Inflammatory Cytokine Analysis. Cytokine levels from plasma and 
splenocyte supernatant samples was collected during euthanasia and 
were quantified using the V- PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 Mouse 
Kit  (K15048D,  Meso  Scale  Discovery,  USA)  measuring  IFN- γ, 
IL- 6,  IL- 12/IL- 23p40,  TNF- α,  IP- 10.  Cytokine  quantification 
was  carried  out  according  to  the  manufacturer's  guidelines. 
Samples  below  the  detection  limit  of  each  assay  were  excluded. 
The lower threshold detection limits for each cytokine were IFN- γ =  
0.04 pg/mL, TNF- α = 0.13 pg/mL, IL- 1β = 0.11 pg/mL, IL- 4 =  
0.11 pg/mL, IL- 5 = 0.06 pg/mL, IL- 6 = 0.61 pg/mL, IL- 10 = 0.94 pg/mL,  
IL- 13  =  2.7  pg/mL,  IL- 17A  =  0.30  pg/mL,  IL- 17E/IL- 25  =  
1.6 pg/mL.

Faecal Microbiome Collection, Sequencing, and Analysis. Human 
donor and murine recipient faecal microbiotas were analyzed to

assess the differences in community- level composition between 
SAD  and  HC.  Human  donor  microbiomes  were  assessed  by 
16S  rRNA  sequencing  to  identify  target  candidates  to  transfer 
to mice. Murine microbiomes were assessed by full metagenomic 
sequencing at the beginning of the study before any treatments 
and  at  the  end  of  the  study  the  day  before  euthanasia.  Details 
regarding the collection, sequencing, and analysis of bacteriomes 
and  viromes  from  human  donor  and  murine  recipient  faecal 
microbiotas are given in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.

Bioinformatics and Statistical Analysis of Microbiome Data. Data 
handling of microbiome measures was undertaken in R (version 
4.2.2) using the Rstudio GUI (version 2022.7.2.576) or Python 
(v3.11.0). Principal component analysis was performed on centred 
log- ratio- transformed (clr) values as a visual companion to the beta 
diversity  analysis.  Alpha- diversity  metrics  were  calculated  using 
scikit- bio  (v0.5.8;  http://scikit- bio.org/).  For  all  analysis  beyond 
alpha- diversity, taxa with a prevalence of <5% (at the species level for 
bacteria and vOTU level for viruses) were excluded from analysis as 
ratios are invariant to subsetting and this study employs compositional 
data analysis techniques (63, 64). Zero values were then imputed 
for using the “const” approach (65). Count data were then centred 
log- ratio (clr) transformed using scikit- bio. Differential abundance 
estimates  were  computed  using  the  analysis  of  composition  of 
microbiomes  (ANCOM)  (66)  method  within  scikit- bio.  Beta 
diversity was computed in terms of Aitchison distance (Euclidean 
distance of clr- transformed counts) and differences in beta diversity 
were assessed using the PERMANOVA implementation from the 
vegan library using 1,000 permutations (67). Plotting was handled 
using ggplot2 and the Python implementation of plotly (https://
plotly.com/).

Gene Expression of Brain Regions. The BNST, medial amygdala 
(MeA),  and  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (MePFC)  were  dissected 
from frozen whole brain tissue using mouse brain matrices and 
a micropunch approach following mouse brain atlas coordinates 
(17). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy® Plus Universal 
Mini  Kit  (catalogue  no.  73404;  Qiagen®,  Germany)  according 
to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  RNA  concentrations  were 
quantified using a NanodropTM spectrophotometer (Thermofisher 
Scientific®,  USA).  Complementary  DNA  (cDNA)  was  then 
synthesized  using  High- Capacity  cDNA  Reverse Transcription 
Kit (catalogue no. 4368814; Thermofisher Scientific®, USA).

Genes that were selected for analysis were chosen based on their 
role in oxytocin signalling, neuroinflammation, and tight junction 
proteins.  Oxytocin  signalling  genes  analysed  were  for  oxytocin 
 generation (Oxt), oxytocin receptor (Oxtr), vasopressin receptor 1a 
(Avpr1a), and vasopressin receptor 1b (Avpr1b). Neuroinflammation 
genes  analysed  were  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha  (Tnf- α), 

interleukin 6 (Il- 6), interleukin 10 (Il- 10), toll- like receptor 4 (Tlr4),  
arginase 1 (Arg1), and chemokine C- X- C ligand 15 (Cxcl15). Tight 
junction- related genes selected were tight junction protein 1 (Tjp1), 
claudin 5 (Cldn5), and occludin (Ocln). Then, RT- qPCR was per­
formed using SYBR® Green real- time PCR on the cDNA samples 
using SYBR green (KAPA SYBR® FAST Kit; catalogue no. KK4602; 
Sigma, USA) to evaluate gene expression levels. Gene expression 
levels were then analysed on an AB7300 system (Applied Biosystems, 
Thermofisher®, USA). Expression levels were calculated as the aver­
age of three replicates for each biological sample from both groups 
and all donors (n = 23 per group) relative to  β- actin expression. 
Then, fold changes were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method (68).

Statistics.  Behavioural,  immune,  and  gene  expression  data  were 
assessed for outliers defined as being outside of 2.5× SD of the mean 
and were subsequently excluded from analysis. Further statistical 
analysis was handled in R (v4.2.2) using the R Studio GUI (version 
2022.7.2.576)  and  in  Python  with  SciPy  (v1.9.3).  To  account 
for  the  nested  donor  structure,  we  used  the  linear  mixed- effects 
modelling framework provided in the lme4 package in R (69), with 
the following model: feature ~ Treatment + (1|donor_ID). In all 
cases, an alpha threshold of 0.05 was used to denote significance.

ing data can be found in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession 
PRJEB68191  (70).  Murine  metagenomic  sequencing  data  can  be  found  on
