Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder— 
a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge

Ulrich Frommberger, Jörg Angenendt, Mathias Berger

SUMMARY
Background: In Germany, the one-month prevalence of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) is in the range of 1% to 3%. Soldiers, persons injured in 
 accidents, and victims of domestic violence increasingly seek medical help for 
symptoms of emotional stress. Days lost from work and monetary compen-
sation for emotional disturbances are markedly on the rise. The term “PTSD” is 
commonly used uncritically and imprecisely, with too little regard for the 
 existing diagnostic criteria. It is at risk of turning into a nonspecific collective 
term for emotional stress of any kind. 

Methods: We selectively reviewed the literature in the PubMed database and 
pertinent journals, with additional consideration of the recommendations and 
guidelines of medical societies from Germany and abroad.

Results: The characteristic types of reactions seen in PTSD are nightmares and 
an intense, repetitive, intrusive “reliving” of the traumatic event(s). Emotional 
traumatization manifests itself not only as PTSD but also through major effects 
on other mental and somatic diseases. An early, trauma-focused behavioral 
therapeutic intervention involving several sessions, generally on an outpatient 
basis, can prevent the development of PTSD. The most important components 
of effective treatment are a focus on the particular trauma experienced and 
confrontation with the patient’s memories of the trauma. The best existing 
 evidence is for cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy according to the exposure 
paradigm of Foa, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy. 
The most recent meta-analysis reveals effect strengths of g = 1.14 for all types 
of psychotherapy and g = 0.42 for all types of pharmacotherapy taken together 
(with considerable differences among psychotherapeutic methods and among 
drugs). The efficacy of psychodynamic therapy, systemic therapy, body-oriented 
therapy, and hypnotherapy has not been adequately documented in randomized 
controlled trials.

Conclusion: PTSD can be precisely diagnosed and effectively treated when the 
diagnostic criteria and guideline recommendations are taken into account. 
 Referral for trauma-focused psychotherapy should be considered if the acute 
symptoms persist for several weeks.

S tressful experiences are an ordinary part of life. 

In the 19th century doctors began systematic re-
search into the psychological consequences of a range 
of stressful events such as accidents and sexual abuse. 
The scope of the term “trauma,” which initially referred 
to  physical  injuries,  was  extended  to  include  psycho-
logical effects. 

Nowadays, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is 
sometimes  diagnosed  uncritically  and  too  frequently 
(1).  PTSD  is  by  no  means  the  only  disorder  resulting 
from  trauma,  and  chronic  cases  of  PTSD  are  often 
 accompanied  by  other  physical  and  psychological  ill-
nesses  or  concealed  by  other,  identifiable  disorders. 
This can make differential diagnosis very difficult.

This article provides a critical discussion of the use 
of the term “trauma” and describes the clinical manifes-
tations,  common  comorbidities,  and  long-term  effects 
of PTSD. It also covers the treatment options for medi-
cal  practice  and  hospitals.  For  reasons  of  space,  the 
subject matter is broadly restricted to PTSD (for a more 
detailed overview see [2]). 

Epidemiology, progression, and long-term 
consequences
The essential prerequisite for a trauma-related disorder 
such as PTSD is a specific, unusually stressful external 
event.  When  asked  as  part  of  the  world’s  largest 
 epidemiological study (3), 60% of members of a repre-
sentative sample of the US population reported having 
experienced at least one traumatic event as defined by 
the  established  criteria  for  trauma.  However,  only  a 
small proportion of these (8% of men, 20% of women) 
sub sequently  developed  PTSD.  This  indicates  that 
other factors can influence whether or not PTSD devel-
ops.

The  risk  of  PTSD  is  higher  if  trauma  is  inflicted 
 deliberately. More than 90% of rape victims develop an 
acute  stress  disorder,  and  around  50%  develop  PTSD 
(4).  Lower  PTSD  rates  are  found  among  victims  of 
chance  events  such  as  natural  catastrophes  and 
 accidents  (3).  High-risk  populations,  such  as  soldiers, 
also have an increased risk of PTSD, varying with the 
location and type of service (e1). PTSD figures rise to 
more than 20% among US soldiers in Afghanistan and 
Iraq (5). In Germany, the one-month PTSD prevalence 
rate  in  the  population  as  a  whole  is  between  1%  and 
3%, increasing with age (6) (Box 1).

BOX 1

Overview of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
● One-month prevalence rate (in Germany)

– 1.3% to 1.9% (in those aged under 60 years)
– 3.4% in those aged over 60 years

● Sex ratio

– 2 to 3:1 (women:men); with the exception of sexual trauma, men experience 

traumatic events more frequently than women

● Distribution by type of event

– Type I trauma: short-term (e.g. accident)
– Type II trauma: persistent, repeat traumatization (e.g. domestic or sexual 

 violence)
● Comorbidities

– a) Psychological disorders: 

Affective disorder, anxiety disorder, somatization disorder, borderline per-
sonality disorder, dependency, psychosis, dissociative identity disorder

– b) Physical disorders: 

Following accidents; pain syndromes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and 
rheumatic diseases
– c) Increased mortality 

● Progression

– Severe initial symptoms possible
– Symptoms often decrease or remit within a few days to weeks
– PTSD becomes chronic in approximately 20% to 30% of patients

Many studies show that traumatic events also play a 
role in serious psychological illnesses such as depres -
sion  (e2),  bipolar  disorder  (7),  psychosis  (e3,  e4), 
anxiety  disorders  (e2),  and  alcoholism  (8).  Concomi-
tant  PTSD  has  an  adverse  effect  on  the  severity  and 
progression of these illnesses (7–9, e5). A high number 
of  traumatic  events  and  psychosocial  stresses  during 
childhood  and  adolescence  leads  not  only  to  a  higher 
rate  of  psychological  and  physical  illnesses  (e6)  but 
also to lower life expectancy (by up to 20 years) (10). 
Large  studies  have 
found  associations  between 
 traumatic  events  and  multiple  physical  illnesses,  such 
as  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD), 
rheumatic  diseases,  cardiovascular  diseases,  and 
cancers  (11,  e6,  e7).  The  processes  underlying  these 
 associations  have  not  yet  been  clarified.  It  is  possible 
that  a  chronically  increased  level  of  stress,  with  its 
multiple  biological  consequences,  plays  a  major  role 
(12, 13, e8).

Research  data  shows  that  individuals  who  are 
 injured  in  accidents  and  have  psychological  trauma-
 related disorders experience longer hospital stays, more 
frequent  complications,  and  delayed  recovery  (14). 
 Society bears a heavy cost for trauma-related disorders 
in the form of increased rates of interrupted education 
and  training,  unwanted  pregnancy,  partnership  con-
flicts, and unemployment. In the USA, the productivity 

60 

losses  caused  by  PTSD  alone  are  estimated  at  more 
than  US$ 3  billion/year  (15).  For  Germany,  the  total 
 financial  impact  of  all  aspects  of  trauma-related 
 disorders is estimated at €11 billion/year (16).

Symptoms
Typical  reactions  are  an  intense,  unavoidable  reliving 
of the traumatic event in the form of images, film-like 
scenes, or nightmares. The affected individual is unable 
to control his or her memories. The attempt not to think 
about the trauma again fails and leads to dysfunctional 
avoidance behavior. This causes symptoms to become 
prolonged and chronic.

PTSD symptoms can also include dissociative symp-
toms  (e.g.  total  or  partial  amnesia)  and  emotional 
numbing. Manifestations of physical and psychological 
unease,  such  as  nervousness  and  sleep  and  concen-
tration disorders, occur as if the threat that occurred in 
the  past  still  continued  to  exist.  Exaggerated  startle 
 response, tension, outbursts of anger, and irritability are 
also  possible.  Depending  on  the  type  of  trauma,  indi-
viduals can experience deep despair and be tortured by 
feelings  of  shame  and  guilt;  this  is  sometimes  associ-
ated  with  self-harm.  Distorted  thinking  can  effect  a 
 lasting  change  in  the  individual’s  perception  of  the 
world  (“There’s  danger  lurking  everywhere”),  others 
(“I can’t trust anyone”), and him/herself (“I’ll never get 
over it”) (Box 2).

The term “trauma” and diagnosis
In  ordinary  speech,  and  even  among  physicians  and 
psychotherapists, the word “trauma” is used to denote 
an extremely wide variety of events. In everyday medi-
cal  practice  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD  as  a  synonym  for 
stress reactions of any kind is as common as it is incor-
rect.  The  term  “trauma”  for  the  diagnosis  of  PTSD, 
however, is strictly defined in psychiatric classification 
systems.  It  includes  only  exceptional,  life-threatening 
or potentially life-threatening external events and those 
associated  with  serious  injury,  which  are  capable  of 
causing a psychological shock in practically any indi-
vidual to a greater or lesser extent.

The  psychological  consequences  of  less  serious, 
non-life-threatening stresses such as a divorce, job loss, 
bullying,  or  bitter  feelings  about  these  are  to  be 
 considered  adjustment  disorders,  even  if  individual 
symptoms typical of PTSD occur. Too little account is 
taken  of  the  fact  that  diagnosis  has  not  only  criteria 
 relating to trauma, symptoms, time, and clinical signifi-
cance  but  also  therapeutic  consequences.  Incorrect 
diagnoses  can  lead  to  incorrect  treatment  or  mistaken 
expert judgments.

Problems are caused by diagnosis being applied too 
broadly,  together  with  overprotective  behavior  on  the 
part  of  the  physician  and  excessively  long  sick  leave, 
without appropriate treatment. This can also lead to an 
unrealistic  desire  for  treatment,  including  regressive 
behavior and self-identification as a victim.

One  cause  of  incorrect  evaluations  is  that  the 
 severity  of  an  event  is  not  necessarily  correlated  with 

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2014; 111(5): 59−65

the  severity  of  the  resulting  symptoms.  Different 
people  can  react  to  the  same  event  in  very  different 
ways. This makes the effect of other risk and protective 
factors  important.  Such  factors  include  genetics  and 
epigenetics, intelligence, sex, coping strategies and de-
fense mechanisms, and social support, as well as social 
expectations and potentially a desire for compensation 
(17, 18, e9, e10).

these  can 

Confronting  the  traumatic  events  reported  by  the 
 patient  can  trigger  intense  emotional  reactions  in  the

range 
 behavior 
to  brusque  disapproval.  This  must  be 
 acknowledged  and  reflected  upon,  as  it  can  otherwise 
place great strain on the therapeutic relationship and is 
unhelpful.

In  the  context  of  the  increasing  number  of  expert 
 sociomedical  appraisals  of  trauma-related  disorders 
and  their  effects,  difficult  judgments  are  sometimes 
required of the experts in question (19, e11, e12).

Criticism  of  PTSD  as  a  concept  concerns  the  term 
“trauma,” the significance of the many factors that in-
fluence whether or not clinical manifestations develop, 
and issues of validity (e13). The definition of PTSD is 
currently  being  reviewed  for  the  new  editions  of  the 
DSM  and  ICD  diagnostic  classifications  (DSM-5  and 
ICD-11)  (20,  21,  e14). A  separate  category  for  stress-
 related  disorders  has  been  created  in  DSM-5,  as  was 
 already  the  case  in  the  ICD  (22).  Constellations  of 
symptoms classified as “complex” PTSD (23) follow-
ing  prolonged  traumatic  events  may  be  added  to 
ICD-11. This would close a much-criticized loophole in 
the  definition  of  PTSD,  as  the  traditional  criteria  for 
PTSD do not reflect the variety of symptoms of “com-
plex”  PTSD.  DSM-5  allows  for  this  in  a  rudimentary 
way by expanding the criteria for PTSD (21).

Differential diagnosis
Different people react to trauma in different ways, so a 
number  of  disorders  may  develop.  In  addition  to 
 trauma-related  disorders  in  the  narrow  sense  (PTSD, 
complex  PTSD,  lasting  personality  change  following 
extreme  stress,  dissociative  identity  disorder),  anxiety 
disorders,  depression,  or  addiction  can  occur  in  iso-
lation (15, 24).

Patients with psychological disorders are often also 
traumatized, but to a varying degree. Traumatization is 
very frequently (50% to 70% of cases) found in border-
line personality disorder, but it is also found more com-
monly  than  previously  thought  in  other  psychological 
disorders,  such  as  anxiety  disorders,  unipolar  depres -
sion and bipolar affective disorders, schizophrenia, and 
addictions (7, 8, e2–e4). Not everyone who experiences 
a traumatic event develops a disorder (3, 15, 24).

Problems  occur  when,  for  example,  PTSD  patients 
turn to sedatives to reduce their agitation, with the po-
tential  consequences  of  substance  abuse  (8).  Studies 
show that the rate of PTSD among those with serious 
psychological  disorders  is  significantly  higher  (7,  8, 
e15)  than  stated  in  medical  records.  At  least  one 
 psychological comorbidity has been found in more than

● A:     Trauma   

Objective: life-threatening;  
Subjective: intense fear, helplessness, horror

Nightmares, intrusions, flashbacks, psychological 
stress, physical reactions to confrontations

– PTSD symptoms are associated with the traumatic 
event and can be triggered by recollections/re -
minders

– Acute stress reaction: symptoms last less than 1 

month (DSM criterion)

– Adjustment disorders: less severe trauma/stress; 

symptoms usually less severe, or not all symptoms 
present

– Complex PTSD (following type II trauma): more wide-

ranging, far-reaching symptoms such as lasting 
 mistrust; affective dysregulation; disorders affecting 
relationships, intimacy and sexuality, identity, and 
self-perception; chronic suicidal thoughts; self-harm

70%  of  all  chronic  PTSD  patients  during  their  PTSD 
(3,  15,  e16).  This  makes  it  important  that  physicians 
consider  possible  traumatic  events  and  ask  targeted 
questions to learn about them in medical practice.

Causes
Freud  wrote  of  a  “breach  in  the  protective  shield 
against stimuli” (e17), in other words an excess of in-
formation that must be psychologically dealt with as a 
result of a severe trauma. The event exceeds the capac-
ity  of  psychological  resources  and  existing  coping 
 strategies. The development of PTSD must always be 
understood as an interaction between disposing factors, 
characteristics of the event that has occurred, and pro-
tective factors.

Studies show that a lower hippocampus volume and 
genetic  polymorphisms  of 
receptors  or  neuro -
transmitter transporters modulate reactions (12, 17, 25, 
26,  e9).  Hypoactivity  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  and

Main types of psychotherapy for post-traumatic 
stress disorder
● Early intervention:  

Conflicting results, probably trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy last-
ing several hours (30, e22, e23)

● Best evidence psychotherapeutic approaches (evaluated in randomized 

controlled trials [RCTs]):
– Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): d = 1.26 to 1.53 

 (meta-analysis according to [35])

– Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR): d = 1.25 

 (meta-analysis according to [35])

● Other promising treatments (evaluated in RCTs):

– Imagery rescripting and reprocessing therapy (IRRT), in combination with 

other methods only: high effect sizes

– Narrative exposure therapy (NET): d = 0.65 (meta-analysis according to 

[e28])

– Brief eclectic psychotherapy (BEP): d = 1.55 (according to [e27])

 corresponding  hyperactivity  in  the  amygdala  indicate 
emotional dysregulation and therefore a functional im-
balance between the systems (27). Neurobiologically, a 
traumatic event leads not only to functional changes but 
even  to  morphological  ones  (28).  Epigenetic  changes 
can occur as result of trauma and can continue to have 
an effect even on subsequent generations (17, 26).

Early intervention
The  family  doctor  is  often  the  first  person  someone 
talks  with  about  a  trauma.  Initially,  simple,  sympa -
thetic,  but  sometimes  “forgotten”  attitudes  and  prin-
ciples  should  be  adopted  in  such  situations.  Severe 
traumatic events are existential borderline experiences 
that  can  cause  massive  confusion.  Sympathy,  support 
that  provides  safety,  and  reassurance  are  therefore 
 essential. Active  listening,  letting  the  patient  describe 
his/her experience in detail, and inquiry are necessary. 
This  encourages  the  support  urgently  needed  by  the 
 patient  to  preserve  (or  recover)  his/her  self-esteem. 
Critical, skeptical questions and comments that belittle 
the  patient  and  do  not  take  him/her  seriously  are 
 inappropriate. The  primary  role  of  the  physician  is  to 
provide help, not critical inquiry.

Very  in-depth  exploration  should  be  avoided  at  the 
first  meeting,  as  trigger  stimuli  can  be  very  stressful. 
The patient should also be informed of this when his/
her urge to communicate is strong. 

Mentioning possible symptoms resulting from what 
has  occurred,  categorizing  them,  and  describing  them 
as  “normal  reactions  to  an  abnormal  event”  can  im-
prove understanding of reactions and reduce anxiety. It 
is  important  on  the  one  hand  not  to  pathologize

Psychiatric pharmacotherapy for 
post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD)
● Early intervention:

– Effectiveness not guaranteed;  
to be avoided: benzodiazepines
● Complete clinical picture of PTSD*: 
– Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs):  

amitriptyline, imipramine

– Monoaminoxydase (MAO) inhibitors:  

phenelzine, moclobemide

– Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs):  

paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine

– Selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake 

 inhibitors (SNRIs): venlafaxine

– Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepres-

sants (NASSAs): mirtazapine

– Mood stabilizers: carbamazepine, lamotrigine

  → Authorized for the indication PTSD in Germany: 
paroxetine (paroxetine and sertraline in the USA)

  → Cochrane Review (e31): SSRIs are first-line 

drugs

  → Review of meta-analyses and guidelines (39): 

SSRIs and SNRIs (venlafaxine) are first-line 
drugs

 reactions and on the other hand to attribute psychologi-
cal symptoms that are causing concern primarily to the 
event and to provide a neutral diagnostic term such as 
“acute  psychological  stress  reaction”  or  express  it  in 
visual terms (“being thrown off-course”).

Short, easy-to-use screening questionnaires can also 
provide an early indication of the type and severity of 
subjective stress in routine care in the first weeks after 
the  event.  For  those  injured  in  traffic  or  occupational 
accidents,  we  developed  and  validated  a  simple  tool 
(29), which can be requested from us.

A  tiered  approach  to  treatment  is  helpful.  If  only 
mild symptoms are present, help can be restricted to in-
formation on reactions and the favorable prognosis for 
symptom resolution.

Self-help  guides  are  also  available  (e18–e21).  As 
symptoms can increase over time, a repeat consultation 
for  re-evaluation  of  stress  should  be  arranged  after  a 
few  weeks.  If  symptoms  have  not  resolved  or  have 
even  increased,  local  outpatient  treatment  options 
should be investigated.

If  initial  symptoms  are  severe  and  stress  levels 
high,  treatment  should  be  begun  immediately  (e22).

Structured,  trauma-focused  behavioral  therapy,  invol-
ving  several  sessions,  is  currently  considered  to  be 
most  effective (e22, e23). Meta-analyses of studies of 
high methodological quality have shown effect sizes of 
0.75 (30). Other procedures, such as psychological de-
briefing, either have not been evaluated or are contro-
versial.

To  date  there  is  no  evidence  that  psychiatric  drugs 
can  effectively  prevent  PTSD  following  a  traumatic 
event  (31,  e24).  Sedatives  such  as  benzodiazepine 
should be prescribed only in very severe cases, such as 
an  acute  suicidal  tendency.  Sedative  antidepressants 
can be used in cases of major sleep disorders. As far as 
possible,  the  first  resort  should  be  emotional  and 
 psychological support and the individual’s own powers 
of recovery.

Effective treatments
Most  trauma  treatments  can  be  provided  on  an 
 outpatient  basis.  Inpatient  treatment  at  a  specialized 
 facility  should  be  considered  only  when  the  intensity, 
severity,  and  complexity  of  symptoms  exceed  the  ca-
pacity of outpatient care (for criteria see [32], [German-
language publication]).

According to meta-analyses and guidelines (33–35, 
36,  e22,  e25),  trauma-focused  psychotherapy  is  first-
line  treatment.  The  best  evidence  available  is  for 
 cognitive  behavioral  therapy,  exposure  therapy  as 
 proposed by Foa (e26, 37), and eye movement desensi-
tization  and  reprocessing  (EMDR)  therapy  (38).  In 
other  words,  the  effectiveness  of  multimodality  treat-
ment involving confrontation and cognitive processing 
of the traumatic experience has been demonstrated in a 
number  of  randomized  controlled  trials.  In  meta-
 analyses,  comparison  with  control  groups  (waiting 
lists) has shown medium effect sizes: d = 1.26 to 1.53 
for  cognitive  and  behavioral  therapy  (including  expo-
sure therapy), d = 1.25 for EMDR, and d = 1.11 for all 
active treatments (35). Individual controlled trials have 
also  shown  brief  eclectic  psychotherapy  (d  =  1.55 
[e27]), narrative exposure therapy (d = 0.65 [e28]), and 
imagery rescripting therapy (only in combination with 
other methods [e29]) to be effective. As the data avail-
able  from  randomized  controlled  trials  is  insufficient, 
there  is  insufficient  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of 
therapy,  body-
therapy,  systemic 
psychodynamic 
oriented therapy, or hypnotherapy. There has also been 
little  research  into  the  treatment  of  PTSD  following 
physical illnesses (e30) (Box 3).

Turning  to  psychiatric  pharmacotherapy,  the  selec-
tive  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  paroxetine 
and  sertraline  yield  the  best  results  in  randomized 
 controlled  trials  (meta-analysis  [e31]:  weighted  mean 
difference  [WMD]  =  –5.95)  and  are  recommended  in 
guidelines (34, e25, e31). In Germany, only paroxetine 
is  approved  for  the  indication  PTSD.  If  this  proves 
 insufficiently  effective,  the  data  currently  available 
supports  the  selective  serotonin  and  noradrenaline 
reuptake  inhibitor   (SNRI)  venlafaxine  (though  this  is 
an off-label use). It is important to ensure that treatment

Potential sources of error in the 
 diagnosis and treatment of post-
 traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
● Trauma/diagnosis criteria not met
● Differential diagnosis conceals PTSD
● Feelings of shame/guilt lead to concealment of other 

problem areas
● Non-adherence
● Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) not 

 prescribed for long enough (several weeks) or at a high 
enough dose (up to a maximum or limited due to 
 adverse drug reactions [ADRs])
● Insufficiently supportive environment
● Avoidance behavior maintained

duration is sufficient (several months) and to take into 
account  the  frequent  requirement  of  higher  doses 
(Box 4).

With  both  psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy, 
non-adherence and treatment resistance occur in at least 
one-third  of  patients.  Box  5  provides  a  short,  incom-
plete summary of potential influencing factors. A tiered 
approach is proposed for cases of treatment resistance 
(e32).

treatments 

As  a  result  of  the  complexity  of  persistent  trauma-
 related disorders, and their range of comorbidities, it is 
difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of inpatient treat-
ments. The data from a randomized controlled trial of a 
combination  of 
involving  dialectical 
 behavior  therapy  (DBT)  for  borderline  disorder  with 
exposure therapy is promising: Hedges’ g = 1.35 versus 
a TAU  (treatment  as  usual)  waiting  list  control  group 
(40). To date only a few facilities in Germany use this 
intensive, expensive treatment (DBT-PTSD). The care 
landscape is heterogeneous, and more frequently used 
treatments, such as psychodynamic imaginative trauma 
therapy (PITT) (e33), have not been evaluated in ran-
domized  controlled  trials.  Online  therapy  is  currently 
restricted to research projects (e34).

Well  evaluated  treatment  procedures  involving  the 
methods  mentioned  above  have  been  available  for 
 several  years  and  can  effectively  help  alleviate  the 
massive suffering of traumatized patients. Local thera-
pists qualified in psychological trauma can be found via

Psychological Trauma Therapy (DeGPT, Deutschspra-

 individuals (90% of men, 80% of women) do not 
 develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

● The diagnosis PTSD is intended for a specific pattern of 
persistent stress symptoms following a serious, usually 
life-threatening event.

● Manifest (chronic) PTSD worsens the prognosis of 

other physical and psychological illnesses.

● Effective psychotherapy is trauma-focused and involves 
addressing/confronting the traumatic event intensely. 
For chronic PTSD, selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitors and selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors 
are recommended as possible medication.
