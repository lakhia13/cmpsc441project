of multiple outcomes in mental health trials: 
a methodological systematic review

Abstract
Background  The choice of a single primary outcome in randomised trials can be difficult, especially in mental health 
where interventions may be complex and target several outcomes simultaneously. We carried out a systematic review 
to assess the quality of the analysis and reporting of multiple outcomes in mental health RCTs, comparing approaches 
with current CONSORT and other regulatory guidance.

Methods  The review included all late-stage mental health trials published between 1st January 2019 to 31st 
December 2020 in 9 leading medical and mental health journals. Pilot and feasibility trials, non-randomised trials, and 
early phase trials were excluded. The total number of primary, secondary and other outcomes was recorded, as was 
any strategy used to incorporate multiple primary outcomes in the primary analysis.

Results  There were 147 included mental health trials. Most trials (101/147) followed CONSORT guidance by 
specifying a single primary outcome with other outcomes defined as secondary and analysed in separate statistical 
analyses, although a minority (10/147) did not specify any outcomes as primary. Where multiple primary outcomes 
were specified (33/147), most (26/33) did not correct for multiplicity, contradicting regulatory guidance. The median 
number of clinical outcomes reported across studies was 8 (IQR 5–11 ).

Conclusions  Most trials are correctly following CONSORT guidance. However, there was little consideration given 
to multiplicity or correlation between outcomes even where multiple primary outcomes were stated. Trials should 
correct for multiplicity when multiple primary outcomes are specified or describe some other strategy to address the 
multiplicity. Overall, very few mental health trials are taking advantage of multiple outcome strategies in the primary 
analysis, especially more complex strategies such as multivariate modelling. More work is required to show these exist, 
aid interpretation, increase efficiency and are easily implemented.

Registration  Our systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic 
Reviews (PROSPERO) on 11th January 2023 (CRD42023382274).

Background
An  important  aspect  of  conducting  a  clinical  trial  is  the 
selection, analysis and reporting of outcomes to address 
the  trial’s  objectives  and  evaluate  the  intervention. 
CONSORT  2010  guidance  [1]  recommends  explicitly 
pre-specifying  a  single  primary  outcome.  The  primary 
analysis,  evaluating  the  primary  outcome,  usually  aims 
to  provide  a  clear  and  definitive  answer  about  the  effi-
cacy  or  effectiveness  of  the  intervention  being  studied. 
The required sample size is then typically justified based 
on  achieving  a  specified  power  to  detect  the  smallest 
clinically  important  difference  on  the  primary  outcome. 
Additional  outcomes  may  be  defined  as  secondary  and 
used to support the primary results or address additional 
objectives but are customarily intended to be interpreted 
as less confirmatory.

The selection of a single primary outcome can be chal-
lenging,  particularly  in  trials  of  complex  interventions, 
which  are  common  in  mental  health.  Complex  inter-
ventions  may  have  multifaceted  components  [2],  target-
ing  different  aspects  of  the  mental  health  condition.  An 
example  is  cognitive  remediation  therapy  for  psychosis 
[3], which is a therapy that involves 4 effective elements 
“cognitive  exercise,  developing  problem-solving  strate-
gies, an active therapist, and facilitating transfer to real-
world functioning” [3, 4] through computer exercises and 
discussion with a therapist. This intervention targets both 
cognitive  abilities  and  functioning  and  these  outcomes 
would be measured using different constructs.

Mental  health  trials  often  need  to  rely  on  subjective 
self-reported or clinician rated measures such as psycho-
logical  questionnaires  rather  than  direct  measurement 
(alongside  “hard”  outcomes  such  as  mortality  which  are 
still  important  but  may  occur  less  frequent  in  mental 
health conditions) There is currently little harmonisation 
of  core  outcomes  in  mental  health  [5]  as  seen  in  other 
disciplines  through  initiatives  such  as  COMET  [6]  Per-
haps as a result of this, mental health trials often report 
more  outcomes  than  in  other  clinical  areas  [7].  These 
outcomes  can  overlap,  especially  where  they  represent 
transdiagnostic processes (for example low mood may be 
underpinned by separate measures of depression, anxiety 
and sleep).

DDecisions  by  stakeholders,  regulators  and  other 
decision  makers,  such  as  the  NICE  in  the  UK,  on  the 
implementation  of  an  intervention  do  not  depend  on  a 
single  outcome.  Harms,  cost-effectiveness,  and  process 
outcomes  such  as  acceptability  of  the  intervention,  are 
examples of other types of outcomes that a trial may wish 
to  include  for  decision  making  regarding  the  interven-
tion. In this paper we focus purely on the multiplicity of 
clinical outcomes (outcomes that reflect how the patient 
feels or functions).

Multiple  clinical  outcomes  may  be  needed  where  the 
views  of  stakeholders  differ,  where  the  intervention 
may  be  posited  to  affect  different  aspects  of  the  disease 
simultaneously,  or  where  there  are  multiple  imperfect 
measures  of  the  underlying  target  aspect  of  the  disease. 
Designating these as secondary outcomes may not always 
be  sufficient  as  secondary  outcomes  are  intended  to  be 
interpreted  as  more  exploratory.  Multiple  primary  out-
comes can be defined but current CONSORT 2010 guid-
ance  warns  against  this;  without  multiplicity  correction 
or another strategy, this can lead to an increased chance 
of  a  type  I  error  [8]  allowing  authors  to  erroneously 
increase  the  chance  of  claiming  the  trial  to  be  success-
ful  based  on  1  of  the  multiple  primary  outcomes  being 
found  to  be  “significant”.  A  recent  extension  to  CON-
SORT,  CONSORT-Outcomes  2022  [9]  extends  these 
recommendations; prompting authors to clearly describe 
the multiplicity issues when using multiple primary out-
comes and any methods used to account for them.

In  a  previous  systematic  review  by  Vickerstaff  et  al. 
[10], they examined whether multiple primary outcomes 
were  assessed  appropriately  in  mental  health  and  neu-
roscience  trials  from  2011  to  2014,  published  in  high 
impact  journals.  The  review  focused  on  whether  they 
used  an  appropriate  multiplicity  correction  for  multiple 
primary  outcomes.  This  current  review  provides  a  con-
temporaneous update to Vickerstaff et al. [10] but with a 
greater focus on whether mental health trials are utilising 
any “multiple outcome strategies” for the primary analy-
sis.  Here  we  are  defining  “multiple  outcome  strategies” 
as  a  broad  term  for  analysis  or  reporting  methods  that 
account  for  the  multiplicity,  relatedness  or  correlation 
of  multiple  trial  outcomes.  In  addition  to  correction  for 
multiplicity,  examples  of  other  multiple  outcome  strate-
gies  would  be  composite  outcomes,  global  hypothesis 
testing  and  multivariate  modelling.  These  approaches 
represent  alternative  ways  to  use  multiple  outcomes  in 
the primary analysis to aid interpretation. One example is 
the win ratio, a composite/global test that has been used 
particularly in cardiovascular trials [11].

The objective of this systematic review is to assess the 
current  state  of  analysis  and  reporting  of  multiple  out-
comes  in  randomised  controlled  trials  in  mental  health. 
The key aims are to assess the following:

I.  Whether mental health trials are currently following 

CONSORT reporting guidelines and other 
regulatory guidance [9, 12–14], specifically with 
regards to defining a clear single primary outcome or 
adequately describing/accounting for the multiplicity 
of multiple primary outcomes.

II.  Whether mental health trials are currently utilising 
multiple outcome strategies to address primary trial 
objectives or increase power.

Methods
This  study  was  reported  following  the  preferred  report-
ing  items  for  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analysis 
(PRISMA) guidance ( [15]), following a registered proto-
col on PROSPERO (CRD42023382274).

Study selection and data sources

The  review  includes  all  randomised  controlled  trials  of 
interventions  for  mental  health  in  humans  published 
between  1st  January  2019  and  31st  December  2020  in 
leading  medical  and  mental  health  journals;  The  Brit-
ish  Journal  Of  Psychiatry,  Lancet  Psychiatry,  Jama  Psy-
chiatry, Journal Of The American Academy Of Child And 
Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychiatry Research, Psychological 
Medicine,  American  Journal  Of  Psychiatry,  The  Lancet, 
BMJ and Nature. These journals were chosen to represent 
the leading journals that mental health trials would likely 
be  published  in.  A  mental  health  trial  was  defined  as  a 
trial where the target population was participants with a 
mental health condition or were expected may develop a 
mental health condition.

Pilot  and  feasibility  trials,  non-randomised  trials,  and 
early  phase  (Phase  1  or  Phase  2a)  trials  were  excluded. 
Only  primary  trial  results  papers  were  considered;  pub-
lished  secondary  or  interim  analyses  of  trial  data  were 
not  included.  The  2019–2020  timeframe  was  chosen  so 
the  review  might  reflect  recent  practice  but  would  not 
include  trials  affected  by  the  unique  challenges  of  con-
ducting a trial during the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Search strategy

The  search  was  performed  in  the  Ovid  MEDLINE  data-
base  (see  supplementary  material  S7  for  full  search  cri-
teria).  Two  reviewers  independently  screened  all  titles 
and  abstracts.  Full  texts  were  reviewed  by  both  review-
ers  where  eligibility  was  not  clear  from  the  abstract. 
Data was extracted onto a pre-piloted standardised data 
extraction  form  (DS)  for  all  eligible  articles;  with  a  ran-
dom  20%  sample  independently  extracted  by  a  second 
reviewer (MP) to check consistency. Disagreements were 
resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer (RE). Only 
information from the paper as published was used for the 
extraction, supplementary materials including protocols, 
trial  registry  data  and  statistical  analysis  plans  were  not 
used  in  order  to  represent  current  trial  reporting  and 
simplify data extraction.

Due to the nature of the review, no quality assessment 

tool was used.

Data extraction

Characteristics of the included studies that were recorded 
were:  sponsor;  trial  design;  type  of  intervention  (drug, 
complex  intervention  or  other);  phase;  sample  size;  tar-
get  population  (assessed  and  categorised  by  the  authors 

rather than directly extracted); mean age of randomised 
participants  and  percentage  of  participants  who  were 
female.

For  each  trial,  the  total  number  of  clinical  outcomes 
analysed  and  reported  was  counted,  including  number 
explicitly  or  implicitly  defined  as  primary,  secondary, 
exploratory  or  otherwise  undefined.  Adverse  events, 
other  than  where  clearly  also  defined  as  a  clinical  mea-
sure  of  efficacy  or  effectiveness,  and  other  non-clini-
cal  outcomes  were  not  counted.  For  the  purpose  of  the 
review,  outcomes  that  were  recorded  and  analysed  at 
repeated  timepoints  were  counted  only  once,  regardless 
of how they were reported.

Outcomes

We  recorded  whether  a  single  primary  outcome  was 
explicitly and clearly stated and if any strategy had been 
used  to  incorporate  multiple  outcomes  in  forming  the 
primary analysis. We determined if any multiplicity cor-
rection had been made, either for multiple primary out-
comes or for additional outcomes. We recorded whether 
the methods section justified why the authors did or did 
not  make  a  multiplicity  correction.  For  both  compos-
ite and multicomponent primary outcomes (which were 
counted as single outcomes), we recorded whether com-
ponents or sub-scales were also analysed separately.

Additional outcomes for the review examined whether 
there  were  secondary  or  supplementary  analyses  that 
made use of multiple outcomes in a single analysis. Data 
on  whether  multiple  timepoints  were  incorporated  in 
the  primary  analysis  was  also  captured  i.e.,  whether  a 
pre-specified  timepoint  was  stated  (as  recommended 
per  CONSORT  2010  guidance),  whether  the  repeated 
measures  were  analysed  in  a  single  model  and  whether 
individual effects were reported at each timepoint or if a 
summary measure was reported.

Data synthesis and subgroup analysis

The  total  number  of  outcomes  was  summarised  using 
medians and lower and upper quartiles. Frequencies and 
percentages  were  used  to  summarise  categorical  out-
comes.  Data  was  analysed  in  Stata  17.  Studies  were  fur-
ther split and summarised by the following subgroups:

i)  Trials of complex interventions versus non-complex 
interventions (medications or other non-complex).
ii)  Parallel group designs versus other trial designs (e.g., 

cluster randomised).

iii) Trials sponsored or funded by for-profit 

organisations versus non-for-profit organisations.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) trials are 
reported separately.

Definition of multiple outcome strategy

For the purpose of this review, a multiple outcome strat-
egy was defined as any analysis or reporting strategy that 
incorporated multiple outcomes in the primary analysis. 
Primarily,  this  could  involve  using  multiplicity  adjust-
ment, composite outcomes, global test statistics or multi-
variate modelling. These are further described below:

Multiplicity  adjustment  involves  correcting  p-values 
for the number of outcomes/comparisons to preserve the 
overall type 1 error; multiple methods exist, the Bonfer-
roni-based  adjustment  [16]  being  the  most  well-known. 
Other  less  conservative  examples  include  the  Sidak  cor-
rection [17] and the Hommel/Simes multiple testing pro-
cedure [18].

A  composite  outcome  is  a  single  outcome  defined  as 
a  combination  of  multiple  separate  components  [19]. 
Composites  are  frequently  event-based  i.e.,  whether  a 
participant  has  experienced  one  or  more  of  the  qualify-
ing events. However, composites of continuous measures 
or other data types are possible; often combined linearly 
and/or including weights for the individual components.
Another approach is to test effects from different end-
points  using  a  single  global  test  statistic.  As  opposed  to 
a composite outcome, in this approach, treatment effects 
may be estimated individually on the original endpoints, 
but  the  hypothesis  testing  is  carried  out  using  an  over-
all  test  on  some  combined  variate.  Such  tests  may  be 
parametric  or  non-parametric.  Examples  of  global  tests 
include  O’Brien’s  test  [20],  the  Wei-Lachin  test  [21]  and 
the Win ratio [22].

Multivariate modelling  can be  seen as  an  extension of 
global  testing,  where  the  relationship  between  multiple 
outcomes and the treatment is modelled simultaneously. 
This can allow for estimation of treatment effects on each 
outcome individually or combined, and also account for 
the correlation between outcomes to potentially increase 
statistical  power,  especially  in  presence  of  missing  data. 
Multilevel  models  [23]  and  latent  variable  models  [24] 
are two examples of proposed methods. The latent vari-
able approach models the correlation between outcomes 
as a common latent factor. Multilevel models use random 
effects to model the multivariate hierarchical structure.

Results
Included articles

Of the 376 articles identified during the Ovid MEDLINE 
database  search,  147  eligible  trials  were  identified  and 
included  in  the  review.  The  PRISMA  flowchart  (Fig.  1) 
provides reasons for exclusions.

Characteristics of the included studies

Table 1 describes the characteristics of the 147 included 
studies.  Additional  characteristics  are  described  in  the 
supplementary materials (Section S1).

Only  four  trials  (2.7%)  were  reported  from  general 
medical  journals;  almost  all  were  reported  in  special-
ist  mental  health  journals  (n = 143).  The  majority  were 
academic  (or  not-for-profit)  initiated  (132,  90%),  with 
fewer  sponsored  by  pharmaceutical  companies  or  other 
for  profit  entities  (15,  10%).  The  majority  of  trials  (106, 
72%)  evaluated  a  complex  intervention,  followed  by  a 
medicinal  product  (32,  22%)  or  other  type  of  interven-
tion  (9,  6%).  However,  very  few  trials  (8/106,  8%)  stated 
explicitly  that  the  intervention  was  complex,  with  most 
interventions  inferred  by  the  reviewers  as  complex  as 
they  appeared  to  have  multiple  interacting  components. 
Phase of the trial was also mostly inferred (140, 95%), not 
unexpectedly  as  trial  phase  is  based  on  a  drug  develop-
ment framework [25] and most of the trials were of com-
plex interventions. The majority of trials were assessed as 
Phase  III  (70,48%)  or  as  Phase  IIb  and/or  Phase  III  (48, 
33%), although the latter category was used when it was 
unclear  which  of  these  phases  applied.  The  identified 
trials  cover  a  wide  spectrum  of  different  mental  health 
conditions.

Most trials included were two arm (122, 83%) and par-
allel group (120 ,82%), with a small number cluster ran-
domised  (16,11%),  crossover  (4,3%),  or  having  another 
design (7, 5%).

The  time  that  the  trials  started  recruitment  spanned 
over  a  long  period  of  time,  from  2000  to  2019  (Supple-
mentary table S1).

Number of outcomes reported

The  median  total  number  of  clinical  outcomes  reported 
was 8 (IQR: 5–11). 52 trials (36%) reported more than 10 
separate clinical outcomes.

97 (67%) trials clearly stated a single primary outcome 
as  per  CONSORT  2010  guidance.  An  additional  4  trials 
appeared to have a single primary outcome, but this was 
inferred rather than clearly stated.

29 (20%) trials clearly stated that they had multiple pri-
mary outcomes. Another 4 were inferred as having mul-
tiple primary outcomes. The median number of primary 
outcomes  in  these  trials  was  2  (IQR:  2–3)  with  a  mean 
of 2.9 primary outcomes. The highest number of primary 
outcomes  was  13,  in  this  case  the  trial  specified  several 
domains  as  primary  outcomes  which  each  incorporated 
several separate measures, namely parent and adolescent 
ratings of sleepiness, ADHD symptoms and oppositional 
behaviours. Many of the other trials with a large number 
of primary outcomes also specified one or more domains 
that actually translated into several separate measures.

10 (6.9%) trials did not clearly define any outcome(s) as 
the primary outcome, and this was not able to be inferred 
as  for  each  of  these  trials,  none  of  the  outcomes  were 
defined.

Fig. 1  Included articles flow diagram (PRISMA Flowchart)

125 (86%) trials defined secondary outcomes explicitly, 
the median number of secondary outcomes reported was 
4 (IQR: 1–8). Very few trials (11, 8%) described any out-
comes as exploratory outcomes. 40 (28%) trials reported 
additional  outcomes  that  were  not  defined  as  primary, 
secondary  or  exploratory  or  51  (35%)  including  the  11 
trials  described  above  which  did  not  define  any  of  the 
outcomes.

Multiple outcome strategies (for primary analysis).
Few  trials  reported  (n = 15,  10%)  using  any  strategy 
to  analyse  or  report  multiple  outcomes  as  part  of  the 
primary  analysis.  Of  these,  8  trials  reported  (or  it  was 
inferred)  that  the  primary  measure  was  a  composite 
endpoint  with  5  trials  using  an  unweighted  composite 
of events (composites were counted as a single outcome 
so are part of the n = 100 trials with a single primary out-
come as above). For example, Daly et al. [26] used relapse 

as  the  primary  outcome,  which  was  defined  as  a  Mont-
gomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total 
score  of  22  or  higher  or  hospitalisation  for  worsening 
depression  or  suicide  attempt.  Two  trials  used  compos-
ites  of  continuous  measures  without  reporting  weights 
(and  therefore  presumably  used  a  linear  combination 
with  equal  weights).  One  trial  (Haight  et  al.  [27])  used 
a  composite  percentage;  abstinence  from  opioid  use 
defined as “the percentage of each participant’s negative 
urine samples and self-reports of illicit opioid use among 
20  weekly  opioid  use  assessments”.  Implicitly  this  was 
also unweighted. Of the 8 trials that reported a compos-
ite, 5 also analysed the individual components separately.
None  of  the  trials  identified  in  the  review  reported 
using  global  statistical  tests,  multivariate  modelling, 
or  any  approach  that  might  account  for  the  correlation

between outcomes, to incorporate multiple outcomes in

Multiple primary outcomes

7/29 (24%) of trials which clearly stated multiple primary 
outcomes  used  a  multiplicity  correction  to  account  for 
these, which we counted as a multiple outcome strategy 
for  the  purpose  of  this  reviewOf  these,  2  trials  used  a 
Bonferroni correction, while one used a Bonferroni cor-
rection  only  within  domain  (7  primary  outcomes  were 
defined,  split  into  3  domains).  3  trials  did  not  specify  a 
named  correction  method  but  stated  that  they  would 
use  a  lower  alpha  for  each  outcome  to  correct  for  mul-
tiple testing for the primary outcomes. One of these tri-
als  justified  this  lower  alpha  based  on  the  correlation 
among  the  primary  outcomes.  One  trial  specified  that 
they used a group sequential test procedure described by 
Cui et al. [28] although this appeared to be to adjust only 
for the interim analysis rather than the multiple primary 
outcomes.

The  other  23/29  (79%)  trials  that  stated  multiple  pri-
mary outcomes made no multiplicity correction. None of 
the additional 4 trials that we inferred had multiple pri-
mary outcomes used multiplicity correction. In the previ-
ous review by Vickerstaff et al. [10], co-primary outcomes 
were  differentiated  from  multiple  primary  outcomes, 
with  co-primaries  defined  as  needing  to  show  an  effect 
on  all  co-primary  outcomes,  precluding  the  need  for 
multiplicity  correction.  3/29  trials  reported  the  primary 
outcomes  explicitly  as  “co-primary”  (and  of  the  other 
26/29, we could not infer that any considered the primary 
outcomes as “co-primary”) although 2 of these trials did 
still correct for multiple testing.

Additional strategies for other outcomes

Of the trials with a single primary outcome, 18/101 (18%) 
reported using a multiplicity correction for secondary or 
additional  outcomes.  A  small  number  of  trials  (5)  used 
strategies  that  incorporated  several  secondary  or  other 
undefined outcomes as part of a single analysis. 4 of these 
used  unweighted  composites  (2  continuous,  2  event-
based).  One  trial  used  principal  component  analysis  to 
create overarching measures of behaviour from child and 
parent rated scales.

Multicomponent outcomes

A large proportion of identified trials (68%) used a mul-
ticomponent  measure  as  the  primary  outcome,  these 
were counted as a single outcome. Multicomponent was 
loosely defined for the purpose of this review as any out-
come  that  is  commonly  treated  as  a  single  outcome  but 
arises from multiple questions or measures. Usually, this 
meant  a  validated  psychometric  measure,  which  may  or 
may  not  have  had  additional  subscales.  15  (15%)  trials 
with  a  multicomponent  primary  outcome  also  reported 
and analysed individual components or subscales as sep-
arate outcomes.

Longitudinal, using repeated measures

119  trials  recorded  the  primary  outcome  measure  at 
multiple  follow  up  timepoints.  68/119  (57%)  trials  pre-
specified  one  of  the  timepoints  as  the  primary  contrast. 
106/119  (89%)  specified  that  they  used  a  single  model 
to  analyse  all  of  the  timepoints,  with  7  trials  analysing 
the  timepoints  separately  (and  6  trials  not  adequately 
describing  the  analysis  to  determine  this).  Of  the  106 
trials  which  used  a  single  model,  77  (73%)  reported 
treatment  effects  at  each  of  the  timepoints,  with  27/77 
additionally reporting a summary measure. 28/106 (26%) 
trials reported only a summary measure. For 1 trial it was 
unclear. The summary measure reported was most often 
a  treatment  x  time  interaction  effect  or  equivalently  the 
difference in slopes over time.

Complex interventions

The  number  of  trials  that  explicitly  stated  the  primary 
outcome(s)  was  similar  for  trials  of  complex  interven-
tions  compared  to  non-complex  interventions,  with  a 
slightly  higher  proportion  of  complex  intervention  tri-
als  (34/103,  33%  compared  to  9/41,  22%)  stating  mul-
tiple  primary  outcomes.  The  median  number  of  clinical 
outcomes was similar for trials of complex interventions 
compared to non-complex interventions.

For profit vs. not for profit

There  was  only  a  small  number  of  for-profit  trials  (15) 
captured  in  the  review.  There  did  appear  to  be  a  higher 
proportion of for-profit trials that clearly stated the pri-
mary  outcome  compared  to  not-for-profit  trials,  and  a 
lower  median  number  of  outcomes  reported  in  the  for-
profit  trials.  A  larger  proportion  also  used  a  multiple

Page 8 of 11

outcome strategy (5/15, 33%) compared to not for profit 
(10/129,  8%).  Conversely,  there  was  a  lower  percentage 
who reported multiple primary outcomes (2/15, 13% ver-
sus 41/129, 31%).

Parallel versus Cluster randomised trials

As there were only a small number of crossover or other 
study  designs,  we  compared  parallel  individually  ran-
domised  trials  against  cluster  randomised  trials  only. 
Cluster  and  parallel  trials  had  similar  rates  of  clearly 
stating  the  primary  outcome(s),  although  a  higher  pro-
portion  of  the  cluster  randomised  trials  reported  mul-
tiple  primary  outcomes  (7/16,  44%  vs.  34/118,  29%). 
Similar rates of using a multiple outcomes strategy were 
observed across both types of study design.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

Three  trials  reported  outcomes  exclusively  using  fMRI 
data which we considered separately and are not counted 
in  the  reported  numbers  above.  fMRI  outcomes  are 
multidimensional  as  they  consider  changes  across  mul-
tiple  different  brain  regions  and  multivariate  analysis  is 
typically  used.  Of  these  trials,  one  clearly  stated  brain 
changes  as  the  intended  primary,  in  the  other  two  trials 
this was unclear or not mentioned. 2 of the 3 fMRI trials 
reported using multiplicity correction.

Discussion
Recommendations

The  low  number  of  trials  which  used  multiple  outcome 
strategies  imply  such  approaches  may  be  underutilised. 
Of  the  few  strategies  used,  these  were  mostly  simplis-
tic,  involving  multiplicity  correction  (which  reduce  effi-
ciency)  or  composite  outcomes.  The  trials  which  used 
composite  outcomes  did  so  in  a  straightforward  way 
without weighting, and most did not additionally report 
effects  on  the  components  separately.  Much  guidance 
cautions  against  composite  measures  as  composites 
can  be  driven  by  the  least  important  component,  so  it 
is  recommended  that  results  on  the  individual  compo-
nents should be additionally reported separately [14] and 
weighting should be considered [29].

Most  trials  in  the  review  did  specify  a  single  primary 
outcome and defined other outcomes as secondary with-
out correction for multiplicity. This is a common hierar-
chical  strategy  and  Li  et  al.  [30]  suggest  that  there  is  no 
need  to  correct  for  multiplicity  where  secondary  out-
comes  address  separate  objectives  and  are  exploratory. 
However,  we  found  a  large  number  of  trials  reported 
over 10 secondary clinical outcomes and we believe this 
lack of multiplicity correction or other strategy becomes 
less  justifiable  as  the  number  of  secondary  outcomes 
increases.  Many  trials  do  tend  to  overinterpret  “statisti-
cally  significant”  results  on  secondary  outcomes,  or  the 

reader may be liable to when there is ambiguous interpre-
tation. By increasing the number of secondary outcomes, 
there  is  a  greater  chance  of  a  family-wise  type  I  error  if 
interpreted as confirmatory rather than exploratory [31]. 
We  recommend  where  possible,  trialists  limit  the  num-
ber  of  secondary  outcomes  to  those  that  are  maximally 
important to stakeholders and to interpret al.l secondary 
outcomes as exploratory rather than confirmatory unless 
stated  otherwise  (in  the  latter  case,  multiplicity  correc-
tion  should  be  considered)  More  development  of,  and 
adherence to, core outcome sets in mental health would 
help with this issue.

A substantial proportion of trials specified multiple pri-
mary outcomes, CONSORT 2010 guidance warns against 
this because of the “the problems of interpretation asso-
ciated with multiplicity of analyses” [32]. A small number 
of these trials did use a multiplicity correction but most 
did not, as was also found by Vickerstaff et al. previously 
[10]. This lack of multiplicity correction contradicts regu-
latory  guidance  [12–14]  and  advice  on  multiplicity  [30]. 
We  recommend  that  trials  with  multiple  primary  out-
comes use multiplicity correction, another multiple out-
come  strategy  or  clearly  state  outcomes  as  co-primary 
i.e., all primary outcomes have to show a significant effect 
to conclude success.

Anecdotally,  a  number  of  trials  that  had  multiple  pri-
mary outcomes did not explicitly acknowledge that they 
had used multiple primary outcomes, stating a single pri-
mary “outcome” but measuring this outcome with several 
different  measures.  Trialists  need  to  be  clear  that  these 
do  in  fact  constitute  multiple  primary  outcomes,  and 
therefore a strategy to handle these is warranted.

A small minority of trials did not define any clear pri-
mary  outcome(s).  This  clearly  contradicts  CONSORT 
guidance.  This  proportion  is  similar  to  that  found  by 
Vickerstaff  et  al.  [10]  suggesting  no  improvement  since 
then. The latest version of CONSORT guidance was pub-
lished  in  2010,  and  all  journals  included  in  the  review 
state that trials should follow this guidance. Journal edi-
tors  and  peer  reviewers  need  to  be  more  stringent  in 
applying  the  CONSORT  guidance  on  specifying  a  clear 
primary outcome(s).

A  large  number  of  trials  reported  outcomes  that  were 
not  defined  as  primary,  secondary  or  exploratory  and 
counting the number of clinical outcomes was often not 
straightforward because of unclear reporting. We recom-
mend that all outcomes are reported in a clear hierarchy 
and  are  linked  to  clear  objectives,  to  aid  interpretation. 
If  outcomes  other  than  those  defined  as  primary/sec-
ondary  are  reported,  these  should  be  clearly  labelled  to 
indicate how these should be interpreted, for example as 
exploratory  or  mechanistic  outcomes.  For  example,  the 
FDA [14] recommends a hierarchy of primary, secondary 
and exploratory endpoints with primary endpoints those 

Stringer et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2024) 24:317 Page 9 of 11

required  for  marketing  approval,  secondary  endpoints 
those that support the primary endpoints or demonstrate 
additional clinical effects and exploratory endpoints that 
may be helpful for developing new hypotheses.

We  did  not  find  that  trials  of  complex  interventions 
reported more outcomes on average than medicinal drug 
trials; however, a larger percentage did use multiple pri-
mary outcomes, highlighting the difficulty in choosing a 
single  primary  outcome  for  complex  intervention  trials 
on transdiagnostic populations.

For  trials  that  recorded  repeated  measures  of  the  pri-
mary outcome, most trials appropriately modelled these 
in  a  single  model,  although  many  trials  (> 40%)  did  not 
appear  to  pre-specify  a  single  timepoint  as  the  primary 
contrast.  CONSORT  2010  guidance  states  “When  out-
comes are assessed at several time points after randomi-
sation, authors should also indicate the pre-specified time 
point  of  primary  interest“.  Mental  health  trials  need  to 
improve their compliance with this part of the guidance. 
Although  not  treated  as  such  in  this  review,  multiple 
repeated  measures  of  the  outcome  could  be  considered 
separate  outcomes  and  are  also  prone  to  problems  of 
interpretation with respect to multiplicity if a single pri-
mary time point is not pre-specified [30].

As noted in the results 68% of trials used a multicom-
ponent  measure  such  as  a  questionnaire  which  usually 
include  sub-domains  and  individual  items.  There  mea-
sures will often give a single total score; however, if multi-
ple scores are reported from a multicomponent measure 
as occurred for 15% of trials, (especially where correlated 
and/or  addressing  the  same  hypothesis)  we  think  multi-
plicity correction, or another strategy is warranted.

Comparison to other disease areas

The  issue  of  lack  of  multiplicity  correction  for  multiple 
outcomes  is  not  unique  to  mental  health  trials;  a  simi-
lar review in cardiovascular trials [33] showed that mul-
tiplicity  adjustments  were  also  infrequently  reported 
where  they  have  multiple  primary  outcomes  (or  other 
multiplicity).  A  broader  survey  of  CTUs  in  the  UK  [34] 
also  showed  that  adjustment  was  not  always  made  for 
multiplicity across a range of pragmatic RCTs.

Other disease areas do appear to use “multiple outcome 
strategies”  more  often  than  we  have  shown  for  mental 
health  trials  in  this  review.  In  particular  it  is  common 
in  cardiovascular  trials  to  use  composites  [35,  36]  (e.g. 
the  win  ratio  [22])  or  joint  modelling  approaches  [37] 
to  combine  outcomes  such  as  survival  and  functioning. 
We  think  it  is  important  that  these  are  also  considered 
in mental health trials where the primary outcome(s) of 
interest  are  typically  not  “hard”  outcomes  such  as  sur-
vival, and as such there is less agreement between clini-
cians and patients as to which is the important outcome. 
Therefore, multiple outcomes need to be incorporated in 

the primary analysis to address the interpretation of ben-
efit to both of these groups of stakeholders, as well as to 
potentially increase efficiency.

Limitations

The main limitation of this work is that, for practical rea-
sons,  we  restricted  the  search  criteria  to  selected  lead-
ing  journals  and  specific  years  published  (2019–2020) 
and  so  the  review  is  not  fully  systematic.  Our  expecta-
tion  was  that  this  would  capture  a  cross-section  at  the 
upper  end  of  current  practice  in  mental  health  trials,  in 
order  to  examine  these  issues  in  studies  which  are  oth-
erwise likely to be of high methodological quality. How-
ever, selecting leading journals does not necessarily make 
this true. Conversely, if it were true, we may have under-
represented the methodological issues in the reporting of 
multiple outcomes across the totality of published men-
tal  health  trials.  Also  consequent  to  this  selection,  the 
review may not be entirely representative, for example we 
may not have captured the totality of trials across differ-
ent mental health conditions.

By  using  a  restricted  number  of  years,  we  could  also 
not examine trends over time other than by comparing to 
previous reviews.

We only reviewed main papers and not additional sup-
porting  material  such  as  appendices  and  registered  pro-
tocols. Whilst these may have added additional detail that 
made reporting clearer, we think that the information we 
aimed  to  capture  should  really  be  clear  from  the  main 
paper as most readers will not read this additional mate-
rial. However, it is possible using the additional material 
could have demonstrated more outcome reporting issues 
that are not covered in this review, such as primary out-
come switching [38].

As  described  in  the  supplementary  table  S1,  9  of  the 
studies  started  recruitment  prior  to  2010  and  so  would 
not  have  had  CONSORT  2010  guidelines  to  adhere  to 
at  that  time.  Earlier  CONSORT  guidelines  existed  [39] 
but  did  not  make  recommendations  as  to  multiplicity. 
However, all were published after 2010 and so could have 
made changes accordingly.

Conclusions
While many mental health trials do appear to be follow-
ing  current  CONSORT  2010  guidance  and  the  CON-
SORT  2022  Outcomes  extension  (albeit  this  was  after 
when  these  trials  were  published)  in  reporting  and  ana-
lysing  the  primary  outcome(s),  a  small  minority  are  not 
and  improvements  in  the  analysis  and  reporting  of  out-
comes are still needed.

We  found  that  most  trials  in  mental  health  are  not 
taking  advantage  of  multiple  outcome  strategies  for  the 
primary  analysis.  This  may  be  because  of  the  perceived 
downsides of strategies such as composite outcomes and 

Stringer et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2024) 24:317 the complexity of implementing more advanced analyti-
cal strategies. Such strategies could be used to gain effi-
ciency, making trials cheaper and/or quicker to run and 
aid interpretation where multiple outcomes are of inter-
est to patients and clinicians.

To  achieve  this,  more  work  is  needed  to  show  that  (i) 
multivariate  modelling  strategies  exist  that  would  be 
of  benefit  (ii)  in  which  scenarios  such  strategies  would 
increase efficiency/power and (iii) such strategies are rel-
atively easy to use and implement in mental health trials.
