Abstract 
Background:  Multicomponent physical exercise is the most recommended type of physical intervention in older 
adults. Experimental data suggest the relevance of the muscle‑brain axis and the relationship between muscle 
contraction and release of brain‑derived neurotrophic factor, however, the impact of this relationship on cognition 
remains unclear, especially in people with diagnosis of cognitive impairment. This study assesses the effect of multi‑
component physical exercise on global cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.

Methods:  Randomized controlled trials published until January 2021 were searched across three electronic data‑
bases (PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Database). Data about exercises included in the multicomponent intervention 
(endurance, strength, balance, or flexibility), the inclusion of aerobic exercise, and the change in global cognition were 
extracted. The effect size was represented as a standardized mean difference. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB2 
tool.

Results:  A total of 8 studies were included. The overall effect size suggested an effect of multicomponent exercise on 
global cognition. However, the subgroup analysis showed an effect only when aerobic exercise was included in the 
intervention. No effect when mild cognitive impairment and dementia were assessed separately was found.

Conclusion:  This study suggests that multicomponent physical exercise could have an effect on global cognition in 
people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia only when aerobic exercise is included in the intervention. Our 
results support the inclusion of structured physical exercise programs in the management of people with cognitive 
impairment.

in the risk of functional decline, falls, need of long-term-
care, care given burden, and an increase in the direct and 
indirect  cost  related  with  the  attention,  among  others 
[3].  However,  although  most  developed  countries  have 
designed  and  implemented  national  strategies  to  reduce 
the  burden  of  dementia,  their  impact  has  been  slightly 
modified  [4,  5],  which  highlights  the  relevance  of  the 
implementation  of  any  intervention  that  could  reduce 
this burden.

Currently,  there  is  not  enough  evidence  available  for 
disease-modifying  pharmacological  treatments  [6],  and 
the benefits of these treatments on cognition are limited 
[7, 8]. For this reason, non-pharmacological treatments to 
manage dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
are  currently  a  relevant  research  topic  [9].  Research  on 
physical  activity  and  physical  exercise,  as  part  of  non-
pharmacological interventions, have been of interest not 
only for their effects on physical performance but also for 
their effects on cognitive function. Evidence provided by 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggests that phys-
ical  exercise  could  improve  global  cognition  in  people 
with MCI or dementia [10–12]. A network meta-analysis 
that  compared  the  effect  of  non-pharmacological  inter-
ventions on cognition in people with Alzheimer´s disease 
or  MCI,  showed  that  physical  exercise  could  produce  a 
significant  improvement  compared  with  other  interven-
tions [13].

Among  the  effects  of  the  different  types  of  physi-
cal  exercise  on  the  cognition  of  people  with  cognitive 
impairment,  some  questions  remain  unanswered,  such 
as  the  effect  of  multicomponent  physical  exercises.  This 
type  of  exercise  includes  endurance,  strength,  balance, 
and  flexibility  training  [14],  and  is  the  most  recom-
mended exercise for older people showing positive effects 
on  functional  decline  during  hospitalization  [15],  frailty 
[16], and sarcopenia [17]. From this perspective, the role 
of  multicomponent  physical  exercise  over  cognition  has 
aroused  interest.  Increase  evidence  suggests  the  exist-
ence  of  a  muscle-brain  axis  that  could  explain  the  exer-
cise-induced  neuroprotection,  which  may  be  related  to 
the  improvement  in  mitochondrial  function  by  exercise 
in  skeletal  muscle  [18].  In  addition,  muscle  contraction 
has  been  related  to  an  increase  in  the  expression  of  the 
brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF)  [19].  In  gen-
eral, physical exercise increases BDNF in neurodegenera-
tive diseases regardless of the duration, or intensity of the 
intervention  [20].  However,  when  the  effect  of  strength 
exercise is assessed, no association was found [21].

The  effects  of  multicomponent  physical  exercise  on 
cognitive  function,  especially  in  people  diagnosed  with 
cognitive impairment, are still unclear. Therefore, the aim 
of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate 

the effect of multicomponent physical exercise on global 
cognition in people with MCI or dementia.

Methods
Protocol and registration

The  protocol  of  this  systematic  review  was  registered 
at  the  International  Prospective  Register  of  System-
atic  Reviews  (PROSPERO),  with  the  register  identifica-
tion  CRD42020184660.  In  addition,  the  protocol  was 
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pontificia Uni-
versidad  Javeriana  and  the  Hospital  Universitario  San 
Ignacio.

Search strategy

A  search  was  performed  on  MEDLINE  (via  PubMed), 
Scopus,  and  Cochrane  Database  up  to  January  2021. 
The search was aimed to identify published randomized 
controlled  trials  assessing  the  effect  of  multicomponent 
physical  exercise  on  global  cognition  in  people  with 
dementia  and  MCI.  Global  cognition  was  considered 
the  outcome  because  it  is  the  best  measurement  of  the 
cognitive  function  in  patients  with  dementia  and  MCI 
and  is  the  most  common  way  to  assess  cognition  in  the 
included  randomized  controlled  trials.  We  examined 
the reference list of eligible studies to expand the search. 
The  complete  MEDLINE  search  strategy  is  displayed 
in  Supplementary  material  (Supplementary  Table  S1). 
The search was performed to identify any type of physi-
cal  exercise  that  could  be  part  of  the  multicomponent 
intervention  according  with  the  definition  proposed  by 
Cress et al [14]. Additionally, different types of cognitive 
impairment were included in the search strategy to try of 
encompass most of the etiologies.

Inclusion criteria

The  studies  included  in  this  systematic  review  met  the 
following  inclusion  criteria:  (i)  Participants:  adult  par-
ticipants  with  dementia  or  MCI  secondary  to  either.  (ii) 
Intervention:  multicomponent  physical  exercise  defined 
as  an  exercise  program  including  endurance,  strength, 
balance, or flexibility [14]. We included studies develop-
ing  any  intervention  program  that  included  at  least  two 
of  the  above-mentioned  exercises  without  other  inter-
vention  (e.g.,  cognitive  interventions),  and  regardless  of 
the inclusion of aerobic exercise as part of the interven-
tion.  (iii)  Outcome:  global  cognition  measured  by  any 
validate neuropsychological test. (iv) Control: any control 
was  accepted  except  those  with  a  physical  activity  com-
ponent. If the control intervention included a component 
of  cognitive  training  or  stimulation,  both  total  and  par-
tially,  the  RCT  was  included  in  the  analysis.  (v)  Type  of 
study: randomized controlled trials. We only included in

this review studies in English and Spanish. No exclusion 
criteria were considered.

Study identification and data extraction

After  defining  the  search  strategy,  all  records  were 
imported  into  the  reference  management  system  (Men-
deley,  desktop  version  1.19.4)  to  exclude  duplicate 
records. Two authors (LVS and CAB) independently per-
formed  the  search  literature  and  data  extraction,  with 
the  intervention  of  a  third  author  in  case  of  disagree-
ment (ICR). The following data were extracted from the 
selected  studies  using  an  ad-hoc  form:  author,  publica-
tion  year,  country,  sample  size,  losses,  female  propor-
tion,  mean  age  in  control  and  intervention  group,  type 
of  cognitive  impairment,  types  of  physical  exercises 
included  in  the  intervention,  length  of  the  intervention 
(weeks), number of sessions per week, duration per ses-
sion (minutes), type of control group, the intensity of the 
multicomponent  exercise  (as  reported  by  each  study), 
cognitive assessment tool and effect on global cognition.

Risk of bias

The  risk  of  bias  was  assessed  independently  by  two 
authors  using  the  revised  Cochrane  risk-of-bias  tool  for 
randomized trials (RoB2) [22]. The RoB2 included assess-
ment  of  six  domains:  randomization  process,  derivation 
for intended interventions, missing outcome data, meas-
urement of the outcome, selection of the reported results, 
and overall results. Each domain was rated as low, mod-
erate, and high risk of bias. To report on the risk of bias, a 
graphical representation was used.

Data analysis

The effect size (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the effect of physical exercise programs on global cogni-
tion were calculated using the Cohen’s d index. A pooled 
ES  was  estimated  using  a  random-effects  model  based 
on  the  Der  Simonian  and  Laird  method  [23].  We  con-
sider  the  ES  classified  as  proposed  by  Cohen  et  al.  [24]; 
small  effect  (0.2),  moderate  effect  (0.5),  and  large  effect 
(0.8). Inconsistence across studies was assessed using the 
 I2 statistic [25], whose values were considered as follows: 
not important (0%–40%), moderate (30–60%), substantial 
(50–90%),  and  considerable  (75–100%).  Moreover,  the 
corresponding  p  value  were  also  considered.  To  deter-
mine  the  size  and  clinical  relevance  of  heterogeneity, 
τ2  statistic  was  calculated  and  interpreted  as  low  when 
τ2  was  lower  than  0.04,  moderate  when  was  from  0.04 
to 0.14 and as substantial when it was from 0.14 to 0.40 
[26].  In  case  of  high  heterogeneity,  two  subgroup  analy-
ses  were  developed:  i)  by  type  of  cognitive  impairment, 
distinguishing  between  patients  with  MCI  and  demen-
tia,  and  ii)  by  the  inclusion  of  aerobic  exercise  in  the 

intervention. When global cognition was measured using 
more  than  one  scale,  a  pooled  ES  was  calculated.  To 
define the effect of individual studies in the overall effect 
size a sensitive analysis was performed.

The  small  study  effect  was  graphically  assessed  using 
a funnel plot, additionally, the Egger test was estimated. 
Finally, the trim-and-fill analysis was used to estimate the 
number  of  studies  needed  to  remove  publication  bias, 
and to estimate the ES without publication bias. Stata/IC 
software, version 16.1 for Windows was used for statisti-
cal analysis.

Results
Study identification

A total of 2789 records were found following the search 
strategy.  After  removing  duplicates,  and  reviewing  the 
title and abstract, 31 relevant papers were chosen for full 
reading. Finally, only 8 articles met the inclusion criteria 
(Fig. 1). The excluded articles and the reasons for exclu-
sion are reported in the Supplementary Table S2.

Characteristics of included studies

Eight  studies  assessing  the  effect  of  multicomponent 
physical  exercise  on  global  cognition  in  people  with 
dementia and MCI [27–34] were included in the review. 
The  studies  included  367  participants  from  seven  coun-
tries: France [29, 31], Spain [27], Brazil [28], Croatia [30], 
Korea [32], United States [33], and Japan [34]. The mean 
age was between 77.7 and 77.9 years in the intervention 
and  control  group,  respectively,  and  women  accounted 
for 70.3%. Five studies [28, 29, 31–33] included only par-
ticipants with dementia and three with MCI [27, 30, 34].
Regarding multicomponent physical exercise interven-
tions,  all  studies  included  at  least  two  types  of  exercise 
considered  in  the  definition  of  multicomponent  physi-
cal  exercise  [14].  All  studies  included  balance  exercises, 
four included flexibility exercises [27, 31–33] and one did 
not  include  strength  training  [31].  Aerobic  exercise  was 
part of the intervention in six studies [27, 29, 31–34]. The 
intensity of physical activity was considered low to mod-
erate  in  three  papers  [27,  31,  34],  moderate  in  two  [29, 
33], and low in one [32], additionally, two studies did not 
report  on  exercise  intensity  [28,  30].  The  length  of  the 
intervention programs was 8 to 52 weeks, including 1 to 
7 sessions per week, and 30 to 90 min per session.

The  Mini-Mental  State  Examination  [27–29,  32,  34] 
was  the  most  widely  used  cognitive  measurement  tool, 
other  tools  included  were  Montreal  Cognitive  Assess-
ment  (MoCA)  [30],  Brief  Cognitive  Screening  Battery 
(BCSB)  [28],  Rapid  Evaluation  of  Cognitive  Function 
(ERFC)  [31],  Boston  Naming  Test  (BNT)  [33],  Hop-
kins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) [33], and Alzheimer’s

Risk of bias

The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane 
risk-of-bias  tool  for  randomized  trials  (RoB2)  [22]. 
Depending  on  the  intervention  effect  of  interest,  the 
studies  were  divided  into  intention-to-treat  effect  [29, 
30,  32–34]  or  per-protocol  effect  [27,  28,  31].  Overall 
bias  was  reported  as  low  risk  in  20%  of  studies  with  an 
intention-to-treat analysis and 33.3% in those with a per-
protocol approach. Supplementary Figure S1.

Effect of physical activity on global cognition, subgroup 
analysis and sensitive analysis

The  ES  of  multicomponent  physical  exercise  on  global 
cognition  in  MCI  and  dementia  was  0.34  (95%  IC:  0.08, 
0.60).  We  found  a  moderate  inconsistence   (I2 = 41.21%). 
Between-trials  heterogeneity  was  considered  moderate 
(τ2 = 0.06).
For the subgroup analysis considering the type of cog-
nitive impairment, the pooled ES was 0.34 (95% CI: -0.05, 

0.74;  I2 = 57.59%)  for  dementia  and  0.34  (95%  CI:  0.00, 
0.69; I2 = 15.52%) for MCI. For the subgroup analysis by 
the inclusion of aerobic exercises in the exercises proto-
col, the ES was 0.32 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.61; I2 = 44.78%) for 
those  multicomponent  physical  exercise  including  aero-
bic exercise and 0.44 (95% CI: -0.38, 1.25; I2 = 62.39%) for 
those not including aerobic exercise, respectively (Figs. 2 
and 3).

When sensitivity analysis was performed the two stud-
ies which omission showed a higher impact on the overall 
effect size were de Souto Barreto et al. (ES: 0.4; 95% CI: 
0.11–0.7)  and  Kwak  et  al.  (ES:  0.25;  95%  CI:  0.02–0.48). 
Omitting the study of Kemoun et al., the only study that 
did not include strength exercises in the intervention, the 
effect size was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.02–0.52). (Fig. 4).

Small study effects

After visual inspection of the funnel plot and considering 
the Eger test, we found small study effects for the effect 
of multicomponent physical exercise on global cognition 
in MCI and dementia (p = 0.009). The trim-and-fill anal-
ysis  showed  that  only  one  study  was  needed  to  remove

the  small  study  effects  and  that  the  ES  of  observed  and 
imputed  studies  would  be  0.274  (95%  CI:  -0.01,  0.56) 
(Supplementary Figure S2).

Discussion
This  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  provides  evi-
dence  supporting  the  effectiveness  of  multicomponent 
physical  exercise  associated  with  aerobic  exercise  on 
global  cognition  in  people  with  MCI  or  dementia.  Fur-
thermore,  this  meta-analysis  shows  that  when  exercises 
protocol  did  not  include  aerobic  exercise  this  effect  dis-
appeared. Also, we did not find an effect when MCI and 
dementia were separately analyzed.

Our data suggest that multicomponent physical activity 
plus  aerobic  exercise  produces  positive  effects  on  global 
cognition in patients with MCI and dementia. However, 
only two studies did not include aerobic exercise as part 
of  the  intervention  and  presented  a  high  heterogeneity 
between them. Currently, multicomponent physical exer-
cise  is  the  one  most  frequently  recommended  for  high-
prevalent  conditions  in  older  adults  such  as  frailty  [35]. 
Although  the  relationship  between  this  type  of  exercise 
and  cognitive  functions  is  unclear,  the  effectiveness  of 
physical  exercise  in  reducing  frailty  and  improving  cog-
nition, emotions, and social networks has been reported 
among  frail  older  adults  [16],  using  multicomponent 
exercise  and  including  aerobic  exercise.  This  fact  makes 
difficult to isolate the effect of the multicomponent exer-
cise intervention approach, whose evidence on cognition 

remains  inconclusive  [36],  as  well  as  the  most  suitable 
combination  of  components,  duration  and  dose  [37]. 
Nevertheless and considering that physical activity is part 
of the intervention of the vast majority of conditions that 
affect  older  people,  the  inclusion  of  an  individualized 
physical exercise in the management of the older patients 
should be part of the daily clinical practice [38].

The  inclusion  of  aerobic  exercise  within  the  multi-
component  physical  exercise  programs  seems  to  be  of 
importance  in  positively  impacting  cognitive  function. 
The positive effect of aerobic exercise has been reported 
among  cognitively  healthy  individuals  [39],  and  appears 
to  be  stronger  as  age  increases,  suggesting  a  protective 
effect against age-related cognitive decline. Additionally, 
aerobic  exercise  has  demonstrated  to  positively  impact 
on the cognitive function, behavior, and mobility [40] of 
patients  with  dementia  and  the  global  cognitive  ability 
of older adults with MCI [10], although some individual 
domains  are  not  significantly  improved  (i.e.  attention, 
verbal fluency, and visuospatial domains).

Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the 
effects  of  multicomponent  physical  exercise  on  cogni-
tive function. The association between multicomponent 
physical  exercise  (a  composite  strength  and  balance 
training program associated with a walking recommen-
dation)  and  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF), 
a factor that promotes the growth and differentiation of 
neurons  and  supports  the  survival  of  existing  neurons, 
was  previously  explored.  It  seems  that  blood  levels  of

Fig. 4  Sensitivity analysis

BDNF  are  not  affected  by  the  multicomponent  physi-
cal  exercise  intervention  [41].  This  result  is  consistent 
with  animal  models  in  which  strength  exercise  reduces 
aerobic  exercise-induced  adult  hippocampal  neurogen-
esis  due  to  reduced  BDNF  and  β-hydroxybutyrate  [42], 
and with a study in young male participants that showed 
no  effect  of  acute  strength  exercise  on  plasma  levels  of 
BDNF  [43].  Similarly,  a  meta-analysis  that  assessed  the 
effect of physical activity on BDNF did not find the effect 
of strength exercises on BDNF levels [21]. These results 
suggest  that  the  multicomponent  physical  exercise,  or 

at  least  the  strength  exercises,  could  have  no  effect  on 
the  neurogenesis  processes  mediated  by  BDNF.  How-
ever,  the  BDNF  is  not  the  only  cytokine  with  a  role  in 
the  neurogenesis  and  neuroplasticity  process.  Ciliary 
neurotrophic  factor  (CNTF),  leukaemia  inhibitory  fac-
tor  (LIF),  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF) 
family, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are some 
cytokines  that  have  been  related  to  neuronal  plastic-
ity  [44].  IGF-I  level  is  related  to  neurotransmission, 
neuronal  plasticity  and  neurotrophic  potential,  and 
the  declined  serum  levels  have  been  associated  with 

Venegas‑Sanabria et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2022) 22:617 

Page 9 of 11

age-related  cognitive  decline  [45].  In  addition,  healthy 
levels  of  IGF-I  are  associated  with  an  increase  in  hip-
pocampal mass and verbal recall[44]. Related to physical 
activity,  a  contraction-induced  muscle  release  of  IGF-I 
has  been  shown,  independently  of  the  levels  of  Growth 
Hormone [46]. Moreover, muscle contraction and physi-
cal exercise have a relation to an improvement in mito-
chondrial  function,  that  is  related  to  a  neuroprotective 
role  through  both  brain  plasticity  and  angio-neurogen-
esis ways [18]. Finally, resistance training showed a posi-
tive effect on spatial memory in animal models, although 
it has not an effect on the reduction in oxidative param-
eter levels [47]. This evidence suggests that the impact of 
multicomponent  physical  exercise  in  cognition  implies 
different paths and supports the existence of a complex 
muscle-brain axis.

This  study  shows  the  importance  of  included  a 
physical  exercise  intervention  in  the  management  of 
patients  with  cognitive  decline  including  both  aero-
bic  and  multicomponent  exercise  (i.e.,  endurance, 
strength,  balance,  or  flexibility  exercises),  indepen-
dently  of  the  stage  of  cognitive  impairment.  As  far 
as  we  know,  this  is  the  first  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis  that  explores  the  effect  of  multicom-
ponent  physical  exercise  intervention  on  cognition  in 
patients  with  MCI  and  dementia,  using  the  accepted 
definition  of  multicomponent  physical  exercise  in  the 
inclusion criteria. However, our study has some limita-
tions.  First,  no  information  on  independent  cognitive 
domains  was  found,  so  only  data  on  global  cognition 
was reported. Second, few primary studies were found 
with  a  small  sample  size  and  therefore  small  study 
effects was found in the analysis. Third, only two stud-
ies did not include aerobic exercise as part of the inter-
vention  and  presented  a  high  heterogeneity  between 
them.  Finally,  only  published  papers  in  English  and 
Spanish  were  included,  so  no  information  on  other 
languages was included.

Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a posi-
tive  effect  of  the  multicomponent  physical  exercises  on 
global  cognition  in  people  with  MCI  or  dementia  spe-
cially when aerobic exercise was included in the exercise 
protocol. However, due to the limitations of the included 
studies,  these  findings  should  be  cautiously  interpreted. 
Well-designed  clinical  trials  comparing  aerobic  exer-
cise to multicomponent exercise should be conducted to 
clarify the true effect on cognition. However, our results 
support  the  needed  to  include  physical  exercise  in  the 
cognitive  rehabilitation  protocols  and  cognitive  impair-
ment therapies.
