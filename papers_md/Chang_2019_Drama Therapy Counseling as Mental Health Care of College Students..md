Abstract: (1) Background: This study aims to apply drama therapy to a counseling group to address
the mental health problems of college students in Taiwan due to the increasingly serious psychological
problems that have happened in recent times. Based on the healing factors in drama therapy,
we applied such therapy activities to four counseling groups composed of 12 high-risk students from
Taiwan. (2) Methods: “Questionnaire-based assessment, participant self-assessment and participant
attitude assessment” methods were used to evaluate the six mental health indicators of the participants
in the evaluation of drama therapy’s eﬀect and the groups’ pre-test and post-test (the ﬁrst group
and the last group). The six indicators were self-awareness, self-expression, interpersonal and
communication skills, self-cognitive reconstruction ability, social role ability, and decision-making
ability. Data were collected and assessed for the frequencies and percentages of each indicator item.
Sets of paired-samples t-tests, independent t-tests, and two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were
employed to evaluate the diﬀerent designs. (3) Results: The results revealed that drama therapy
could deliver signiﬁcantly positive eﬀects for and improve the six mental health indicators of the
participants. Males’ self-awareness and decision-making actions were more positively aﬀected than
females. (4) Conclusions: The study helps to provide a path of establishing the mental health module
of drama therapy in the education sector in Taiwan.

1. Introduction

Nowadays, there is increasing demand by college students for mental health counseling due to
the increased challenges posed by both the growing number of students with serious psychological
problems on campus and the increase in the number of students seeking counseling [1]. According to
the Taiwan Ministry of Education, because of the crime news “random homicide of a college student”
in Taipei Metro, in which many people were killed or injured [2], Taiwan’s colleges and universities
should increase their counseling manpower and strengthen counseling for students to prevent the
repetition of regret and potential violent action. In this paper, the implications of mental health
problems for college students in Taiwan are discussed, and some strategies for responding to the surge
in mental health needs on college campuses are proposed.

1.1. Purpose of the Study

Strengthening mental health care for college students through counseling is the primary task of
colleges and universities in Taiwan. For students with high-risk mental health, i.e., “major trauma
experience and poor life adaptation,” schools should formulate individual counseling and group

programs. If further behavioral deviation and major violations occur, they should even strengthen
counseling in combination with professionals [2].
In view of increasingly serious mental health
problems, researchers have proposed the application of a drama therapy counseling group for college
students who have mental health problems in Taiwan.

1.2. Literature Review

Drama is a process of role-playing. For human beings as a whole, drama is inherent in the
process of simulation and learning, which extends from life [3]. By using these innate instincts and
developments and by strengthening the function of learning in education, learners can apply their
roles and skills to life, understand their own and other people’s emotions, learn to self-understand and
understand other people’s situation, and then have a benign interaction with society [3–6].

Drama therapy is a term that combines the concepts of drama and therapy [6–8]. Literally,
it represents a form of drama as a form of therapy. “Drama” refers to a work (script) of “poetry” or
“prose” for performers to perform on stage and to simulate the process of life, characters, or narration
of a story through the “action” and “interpretation” of performers [6–12].

Drama therapy diﬀers greatly from traditional counseling methods in that it takes “language”
as the main assistant tool. Drama therapy is a combination of professional basis, psychology,
sociology and the pedagogy of the “action method” of “drama/theatre” as a tool of psychotherapy
and counseling. The process of drama therapy is to overcome the painful limitations of fantasy and
daydreaming, bring them to the realm of art, and give them “action performances” to help manage
basic conﬂicts [6–12].

The “action and performance” process of drama therapy, whether through “theatre games,”
“role-playing,” “storytelling” or “creative and expressive artistic activities,” aims at promoting physical
and mental harmony and seeking a “mediocre way” in the mind, and these experiences can help
individuals living in extreme situations to ﬁnd out the meaning of life and rebuild their balance so as
to acquire ability and try to play a new role; the increase of the role database in the treatment process
can also help prepare for the conﬂicts between roles and situations in future life [6–12].

The six-key model is a way of organizing material in drama therapeutic terms. The model provides
an integrative picture of drama therapy processes and furnishes us with six parameters for assessment.
The six-key model is shown below [7].

(1) An ability to transport oneself to and from ordinary reality.
(2) A particular quality.
(3) Roles and characters.
(4) Patterns: Plot, themes, and conﬂicts.
(5) A response to it.
(6) A subtext.

The model serves several purposes [7]:

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

(5)

It allows drama therapists to survey the process.
It organizes the material in a systematic way around six core points.
It reveals the charged parameters.
It helps the drama therapist to choose speciﬁc interventions or models, which could more
eﬀectively advance the therapeutic process.
It furthers drama therapeutic thinking by conceiving the picture in drama therapy terms.

1.3. Signiﬁcance of the Study

Drama therapy has six major healing indicators for high-risk trial subjects such as the self-awareness
ability, self-expression ability, interpersonal and communication skills, self-cognition reconstruction

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3560

3 of 11

ability, social role ability and decision-making ability of the subjects [3–5]. It is applied not only in
medical science but also in communities, education ﬁelds and other special ﬁelds. Based on the healing
factors of drama therapy, researchers are encouraged to think about how to apply drama therapy
activities to the counseling groups of high-risk students to develop and counsel the psychological
potential and sustainability of the college students. The group objectives include the above mentioned
six indicators of high-risk students.

1.4. Research Questions

The research questions focus on how to apply drama therapy to develop the mental health of
high-risk college students in Taiwan, how to evaluate the changes of the six indicators before and
after the implementation of the counseling group, and to evaluate the impact of gender diﬀerences
among participants.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Participants

The object of this drama therapy activity was a participant-centered design. The premise was
to understand the correlation between the eﬀect of drama therapy and the age, experience, needs,
interests, background, and other basic information of the participants. The participants included
12 students from a college counseling center, with a sex ratio of 7 males to 5 females. Participants
background notes: 1. New members: Those who had not yet participated in any counseling center
activities; 2. Voluntary participation: Those who were interested in drama therapy counseling groups;
3. Participation: Those who had better participation and cooperation eﬃciency in drama therapy
counseling groups; and 4. High-risk members: Those who had a major traumatic experience, poor life
adjustment, behavioral deviation, and major violations. The backgrounds of the participants were
provided by the counseling center, and the details and grouping are shown in Table 1.

Limitation of the Study

However, this research was not an experimental study. The limitation of the study was its small

sample size—12 students from a college counseling center, with a sex ratio of 7 males to 5 females.

2.2. Research Design

There were two parts of the design of the study. One was that researchers revised the concept of
group therapy according to the theory and technique of drama therapy [6–15], the concepts of group

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3560

4 of 11

and arts therapy [16–21], and the theory and practice of group psychotherapy. The other part was
designing the strategies and implementation methods of the drama therapy counseling group.

2.2.1. Seven Main Elements in the Design of Drama Therapy Counseling Group

6.

Relevant resources: This included human resources (such as the leader’s professional skills and
experience, and team, organization), material resources (such as equipment and venues) and
ﬁnancial resources (such as activity fees). In addition to providing assistance from the drama
therapy counseling group, resources also formed possible constraints.
The goals of the drama therapy counseling group: The goal of the drama therapy counseling
group was designed by the student counseling center and the researcher gate according to the
participants. Group objectives included six indicators of high-risk students’ self-awareness,
self-expression, interpersonal and communication skills, self-cognition reconstruction ability,
social role ability, and decision-making ability.
The theme and content of the drama therapy counseling group: These considered the development
stage of the participants and focused on the important issues of personal or life experience,
family and social issues.
The processes and activities of the drama therapy counseling group: Groups conducted intensive
and closed growth counseling groups. The drama therapy group activities were used as the main
axis of each unit. The introduction of the theme before group activities and the processes of
group warm-ups mainly consisted of the group activities of the drama therapy counseling. In the
stage of activities, the mode of “guidance, practice, group interaction, discussion and sharing”
was adopted.
Time: This could be divided into the arrangement time of the theme, the duration of the activity,
the implementation time of the period, and so on. In addition to meeting the needs of the
participants, it also cooperated with the college calendar. It was planned to adopt small group
counseling mode, which was divided into two stages and ten steps for a total of six months.
The 1st–4th time adopted intensive battalion courses to build group motivation, and the 5th–10th
time took place once a month.
Leader: The leader was not only the designer of the group and the implementer of the content
but also the guide. In the process of the group, the theory, goals and implementation situation
of the application of the drama therapy counseling group were reviewed at any time by the
action method. Researchers worked with college counselors in curriculum planning and design.
Researchers acted as group leaders. The ﬁrst researcher in the research team was the main leader,
the second researcher was the co-leader, and other researchers worked on group evaluation and
data integration.

2.2.2. The Implementation Methods of Drama Therapy Student Counseling Group

There were ﬁve methods in the drama therapy counseling group.

1.

2.

Sociometry: This was one of the techniques to measure interpersonal relationships as well as a
tool to measure interpersonal attraction or rejection in a group in order to determine the degree
of acceptance of an individual in a group, to discover existing relationships among individuals,
and to expose the structure of the group itself [22].
Theatre games: These helped in building trust, expression, tacit understanding and group
identiﬁcation [6–12]. By relaxing the body, opening up the rhythmic experience of the body,
releasing body energy in rhythm, the games improved body language and group motivation,
stimulating the sensory acuity of various bodies and developing the expressive potential of
the body.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3560

5 of 11

3. Mime: This consisted of regarding the body as a clay sculpture, because drama sculpture has
inﬁnite possibilities of dramatic moment and expression [23,24]. Using mime could build up
important scenes like dreams, life, family, and friends.

4. Mask projection techniques: The use of “mask” as a visual medium in the process of production
and performance was used to attempt to help participants reﬂect their own personality,
social competence, and other aspects, leading to the inquiry of speciﬁc roles or situations.
Role characters were created and the internal contradictions of diﬀerent types of characters in
the process of playing other people’s roles were experienced so as to carry out interpersonal
psychological interactions [6].
Playback theatre: This drew material from life stories as theatre materials. Using “ﬂuid sculpture,”
the most basic deductive form of playback theatre, allowed for a strong and fast rhythm that was
especially suitable for capturing simple feelings. Actors took turns to appear one after another on
join the stage merging into a “man-made statue” to make up the feeling of the storyteller [25].

2.3.1. Evaluation

Quantitative data collection and analysis are presented as the results of the group evaluation in

this study.

2.3.2. Data Collection

A “questionnaire-based assessment, participant self-assessment and participant attitude
assessment” designed by drama therapy experts and scholars [3–11] in the evaluation of drama
therapy, the group’s pre-test and post-test (the ﬁrst group and the last group) methods were used to
evaluate the change of the six indicators of participants, including A. self-awareness, B. self-expression,
C. interpersonal and communication skills, D. self-cognitive reconstruction ability, E. social role
ability, and F. decision-making ability, each with a total score of 100 points to represent the change of
the process.

2.3.3. Data Analysis

Data were assessed for the frequencies and percentages on each item. Sets of paired-samples t-tests,
independent t-tests, and a two-way ANOVA analysis was employed to evaluate the diﬀerent designs.

3. Results

The main reason why researchers choose drama therapy for student counseling groups is
that it provides an explorable ﬂexible space. Under the mode of group operation, drama therapy
can develop the life and psychological potential of counseling students, with group objectives
including the six indicators of high-risk students as deﬁned above, i.e., self-awareness, self-expression,
interpersonal and communication skills, self-cognition reconstruction ability, social role ability,
and decision-making ability.

Results of Assessments

The following is an analysis of the results of the implementation of the drama therapy student

counseling group.

In this study, the results of the paired t-tests are shown in Table 3. The overall evaluation shows
that drama therapy had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the participants, t = −34.48, p < 0.01. Several signiﬁcant
eﬀects for the dimensions of evaluation were found, with-subjects paired-sample t-tests revealed
that drama therapy signiﬁcantly increased the participants’ scores for self-awareness, t = −13.54,
p < 0.01; self-expression, t = −11.31, p < 0.01; interpersonal interaction and communication skills;
t = −12.21, p < 0.01; self-recognition ability; t = −34.12, p < 0.01, social role ability; t = −20.90, p < 0.01;
and decision-making ability, t = −12.90, p < 0.01. Thus, the result revealed that drama therapy could
deliver signiﬁcantly positive eﬀects and improve the self-awareness, self-expression, interpersonal
interaction and communication skills, self-recognition ability, social role ability, and decision-making
ability of participants.

Two-way repeated measures ANOVA results showed a signiﬁcant two-way interaction between
gender and the six dimensions of evaluation, whereby drama therapy more positively aﬀected female
participants’ perception of self-awareness (F = 9.10, p < 0.05, and decision-making ability, F = 5.56,
p < 0.05) than males. Males with a diﬀerentiation of self-awareness (Mpre-post = −11.43) showed
a stronger negative range score than females with a diﬀerentiation of self-awareness (Mpre-post
= −8.00). Males with a diﬀerentiation of decision action (Mpre-post = −8.28) showed a stronger
negative range score than females with a diﬀerentiation of decision action (Mpre-post = −6.00).
There was no signiﬁcant interaction between evaluations of self-expression, interpersonal interaction
and communication skills, self-recognition ability, and social role ability and gender (Table 4). Thus,
the results revealed an observable interaction between the self-awareness, decision-making ability,
and gender of participants. Males had more positive eﬀects on the self-awareness and decision action
than females after participating in the drama therapy group.

As predicted in the study, two signiﬁcant two-way interactions were found between the four
symptoms and the six dimensions of evaluation. Participants with the symptom of behavioral
bias reported a stronger negative range score in the diﬀerentiation of interpersonal interaction
and communication skill than those with the symptom of maladaptation (F(3,8) = 4.07, p < 0.05,
Mpre-post/behavioral bias-maladaptation = 10.00). Participants with the symptoms of behavioral bias
and trauma reported a stronger negative range score in the diﬀerentiation of interpersonal interaction
and communication skill than those with the symptom of violation (F(3,8) = 8.00, p < 0.05, Mpre-post/
behavioral bias-violation = 8.00, Mpre-post/trauma-violation = 10.00). There was also no signiﬁcant
interaction between evaluations of self-awareness, self-express, self-recognition ability, and social role
ability with the symptoms of violation, behavioral bias, maladaptation, and trauma (Table 5). Thus,
the results revealed that the interaction between symptoms and drama therapy improved participants’
symptoms. Participants with a behavioral bias had stronger depression in the interpersonal interaction
and communication skill than those with maladaptation. Participants with the symptoms of behavioral
bias and trauma showed a quicker decision action than those with the symptom of violation.

4. Discussion

In this study, researchers applied drama therapy methods to develop the mental health of 12
members of high-risk college students in Taiwan, with a sex ratio of seven males to ﬁve females.
The researchers evaluated the changes of the six indicators before and after the implementation of the
counseling group and the impact of gender diﬀerences among the participants.

The drama therapy group members’ scores in the pre-test and post-test changes of the questionnaire,

self-assessment, and participation attitude were signiﬁcantly improved.

Firstly, the biggest change in the chart was the “self-perception” part of the members. It could be
seen that the drama therapy groups had the greatest eﬀect on enhancing participants’ self-awareness
ability. The main reason for this is that the drama therapy groups focused on how to help members to
“materialize” their hidden feelings by means of action so that their inherent feelings, which are not
easily perceived, could be seen and discovered. Next, in the “self-expression ability” section, it was also
found that the drama therapy groups improved the members’ self-expression ability. The eﬀect was
excellent. To those who are not good at using spoken language to communicate with others, it increases
many chances of communicating freely, such as verbal and body language. In addition, by telling
life stories and roles, the drama therapy groups also helped members who had trouble expressing

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3560

10 of 11

their feelings to share their inner feelings with others. Finally, all six indicators of the group’s goal of
participant counseling showed obvious improvement.

5. Conclusions

The application of drama therapy in the education ﬁeld can strengthen the function of learning in
education. The learners can use the skills of roles in life, understand their own and other people’s
emotions, and then have a positive interaction with society. Because of the “random killing of college
students” in the Taipei Metro and the increasingly serious problems faced by students from high-risk
families in Taiwan, researchers have applied drama therapy to the counseling group of Taiwanese’
high-risk college students’ mental health.

Suggestions for future researchers: Drama therapy evolved mostly out of ﬁeldwork. Thus, like a
craft that incorporates professionals from various disciplines, researchers have tended to lean on
their own backgrounds when choosing their methods. The researchers should have drama therapy
and group counseling training and supervise to ensure participants’ well. Learning to deal with
participants’ complicated backgrounds is also important. Drama therapy counseling groups require a
lot of personal interactions including physical and verbal communication. It is challenging to build
up group security and trust, so eﬀective theatre games can build good relationships and lay good
foundations for research. Each group and individual has their own characteristics, so researchers
should be sure to customize their program accordingly.

At present, there are not many studies on the application of drama therapy in the school counseling
ﬁeld in China. The study provides a path to establish a mental health module of drama therapy in the
education ﬁeld of Taiwan.
