Alarmingly, 75% of children and young people who experience mental health problems aren’t getting the help they need.

Children’s emotional well-being is just as important as their physical health. Good mental health helps them develop the resilience to cope with whatever life throws at them and grow into well-rounded, healthy adults.

Things that can help keep children and young people mentally well include:

- being in goodphysical health, eating a balanceddietand gettingregular exercise

- having time and freedom to play, indoors and outdoors

- being part of a family that gets along well most of the time

- going to a school that looks after the wellbeing of all its pupils

- taking part in local activities

Other factors are also important, including feeling loved, trusted, understood and safe. Children who are optimistic, and resilient, have some control over their lives and feel like they belong are more likely to have good mental well-being.

Most children grow up mentally healthy, but surveys suggest that more children and young people have problems with their mental health today than 30 years ago.


### What can affect children and young people’s mental health?


Traumatic eventscan trigger mental health problems for children and young people who are already vulnerable.

Changessuch as moving home, changing school or the birth of a new sibling, etc., may act as triggers. Some children who start school feel excited about making new friends and doing new activities, but some may also feel anxious.

Teenagers often experience emotional turmoil as their minds and bodies develop. Working out and accepting who you are is important to growing up. Some young people find it hard to make this transition to adulthood and may experiment withalcohol,drugsor other substances that can affect mental health.


### Are some children and young people more likely to experience mental health problems?


Certain risk factors can make some children and young people more likely to experience mental health problems than others. However, experiencing them doesn’t mean a child will definitely – or even probably – go on to have mental health problems.

These factors include:

- having along-term physical illness

- a parent who has had mental health problems, problems with alcohol or has been in trouble with the law

- thedeathof someone close to them

- parents who separate or divorce

- experiencing severe bullying or physical or sexual abuse

- poverty or homelessness

- experiencingdiscrimination

- caring for a relative, taking on adult responsibilities

- having long-lasting difficulties at school


### What mental health problems commonly occur in children?


- Depressionaffects more children and young people today than in the last few decades. Teenagers are more likely to experience depression than young children.

- Self-harmis a very common problem among young people. Some people who experience intense emotional pain may try to deal with it by hurting themselves.

- Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)can cause young people to become extremely worried. Very young children or children starting or moving school may have separation anxiety.

- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)can follow physical or sexual abuse, witnessing something extremely frightening or traumatising, being the victim of violence or severe bullying or surviving a disaster.

- Children who are consistently overactive, impulsive and have difficulty paying attention may haveattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- Eating disordersusually start in the teenage years and are more common in girls than boys. The number of young people who develop an eating disorder is small. Still, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa can have serious consequences on their physical health and development.


### I’m a young person – what help is available?


If you’re a young person and you’re worried about your mental health, there is help available. You may want to try the following things.

- Talk to someone about how you feel, such as a parent, friend or adult you trust. Our page onfriendshiphas ideas on opening up to a friend.

- Visit your GP. They can answer any questions you have about how you’re feeling, talk you through different support options, and refer you to other services that could give you more help.

- Get in touch with services and organisations that help people with mental health problems. Visit ourgetting helppage, or look at ‘organisations that can help’ below for support that is specifically for young people.

Mindhas lots of information for young people about understanding your feelings, how to get help and support, what happens when you visit your GP, looking after yourself and more.


### I’m worried about my child – what can I do?


One of the most important ways parents or guardians can help is by listening to their children and taking their feelings seriously. They may want a hug, they may want you to help them change something, or they may want practical help.

Children and young people’s negative feelings usually pass. However, it’s a good idea to get help if your child is distressed for a long time if their feelings are stopping them from getting on with their lives, if their distress is disrupting family life or if they are repeatedly behaving in ways you wouldn’t expect at their age.

If your child is having problems at school, a teacher, school nurse, school counsellor or educational psychologist may be able to help. Otherwise, go to your GP or speak to a health visitor. They can refer a child for further help if necessary. Different professionals often work together in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).

Most mental health support for children and young people is provided free by the NHS, your child’s school or your local council’s social services department.

Young Minds has aParents’ Helplineyou can call if you’re worried about a child up to the age of 25. They provide advice, emotional support and signposting to other services.


### What treatment might young people be offered?


Treatment for children and young people often involves discussing the problem to work out the best way to tackle it. For young children, this may be done through play. They may be referred to a specialist, such as a trained counsellor, to help them explore their feelings and behaviour.

There is a lot of evidence thattalking therapiescan be effective for children and young people, butmedicationmay also help in some cases. Children need to be assessed by a specialist before they are prescribed any medication.

The professionals supporting a child will keep information about them and their families confidential. Young people can seek help on their own by ringing a helpline or approaching a professional directly. Still, they will usually need a parent’s consent for medical care if they’re under 16.

Young people have a right to privacy if they don’t want to talk to their family about their conversations with professionals.
