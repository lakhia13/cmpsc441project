Abstract

The goals of medicine tend to be framed around addressing suffering, pathology, and functional 
deficits. While this is a natural orientation when dealing with serious illness, it is also incomplete 
and neglects significant opportunities to improve the quality of life of patients, families, and 
clinicians. The “total enjoyment of life” is a multidimensional framework that can serve 
as a positive counterbalance to the “total pain of illness.” It allows clinicians, researchers, 
policymakers, and other stakeholders to take a systematic and comprehensive approach to the 
active promotion of well-being. The five opportunities for enhancing well-being in this framework 
are meaning, social connections, happiness/contentment, spiritual transcendence, and pleasure. 
Applying these concepts in clinical settings, patients, families, and clinicians can together find 
opportunities to increase the total enjoyment of life in the face of incurable and intractable 
illnesses. For family care partners, these concepts can be applied to improve self-care, enhance 
relationships, and develop more creative approaches to supporting a loved one living with illness. 
Clinicians working with these concepts may find their clinical work more satisfying and impactful 
and can also apply these concepts to their own lives to increase wellness. In clinical research, 
this framework can be applied to improve intervention effectiveness and relevance of outcome 
measures. Lastly, these concepts have the potential to impact public health approaches that focus 
on well-being and flourishing as the goal and metric of a healthy society.

Introduction: Can Joy Be a Goal of Medicine?

What are the goals of medicine? Although this may seem like an abstract question with 
mainly philosophical implications, the goals of medicine, whether stated explicitly or 
assumed implicitly, have a profound impact on the lives and well-being of patients, families, 
clinicians, and society.1 The most obvious answer, and one that has been the central goal of 
the biomedical model of illness for centuries, is that the goal of medicine is to cure diseases 
and treat related symptoms. While this model works fairly well for acute conditions such as 
sinus infections and broken ankles, an important question to consider is what happens when 
it is applied to chronic, intractable, and often progressive neurological illnesses. Framing 
success and failure within the rules of this model, neurologists find that there are only 
limited situations in which patients and clinicians can achieve victory, for example, epilepsy 
surgery or antithrombotic therapies in acute stroke. In this model, hope is predicated on 
future biomedical advances to cure diseases, ameliorate symptoms, and restore function.2 
In the meantime, patients and families do their best to muddle through their illness. At 
best, neurologists are able to provide partial relief from some symptoms but frequently find 
themselves feeling helpless and defeated by incurable diseases and intractable symptoms.

In the biopsychosocial model, of which palliative care is a well-developed and practical 
application, there are many more opportunities for victory in chronic neurologic conditions.3 
Although this philosophy of care was only articulated recently, it also has deep roots 
in medicine, as summarized by the 19th century physician Edward Trudeau: “To cure 
sometimes, to relieve often, to comfort always.” Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the 
modern palliative care movement, formulated this patient- and family-centered care around 
addressing the “total pain” of illness, referring to the potential physical, emotional, social, 
and spiritual sources of suffering an individual may experience as a result of serious illness.4 
Many examples exist of how palliative care principles can be applied to improve outcomes 
for people with neurologic illness. However, it must be noted that palliative care solely 
focused on the relief of suffering also has its limits in addressing intractable suffering. In 
particular, it restricts our view and options of the person living with illness to that of a 
patient, a person defined by their illness and rooted in the Latin word for one who suffers.

To move from patient- to person-centered care calls for an expanded view of the person 
with the illness and also what the possibilities are for victories.5 Importantly, shifting from 
a deficit mindset—in which care is focused on pathology, symptoms, and problems—to 
an assets mindset—in which care is subservient to life goals, solution-focused approaches 
are employed, and clinical teams work to actively incorporate the strengths and values 
of the person in front of them—allows for opportunities for joy, meaning, and love in 
clinical work.6 This radical frameshift is consistent with the World Health Organization’s 
conceptualization of quality of life (QOL), which explicitly acknowledges that QOL 
includes both negative (e.g., pain) and positive (e.g., pleasure) aspects.7 We discuss how 
these concepts can be applied to improve outcomes for patients with serious neurological 
illness and their family carers, improve well-being and engagement of clinicians, and 
transform the goals of medicine and research to embrace joy and well-being as aspirations 
of equal value to the amelioration of suffering. We also discuss caveats to the application

of these ideas to ensure that clinicians do not fall into toxic positivity or disregard of urgent 
suffering.

Using an Assets Mindset to Encourage and Empower

The traditional medical history and examination are focused on deficits. The deficit narrative 
focuses on what’s broken, including centering assessment on disability and symptoms, a 
reliance on experts to address problems, a framing of caregiving as a burden, and a future 
orientation of decline. While the elements of this narrative are clearly important aspects 
of providing care, the message of this narrative can be discouraging and contribute to 
feelings of demoralization and helplessness. In contrast, the intentional use and cultivation 
of an asset narrative can not only improve hope and self-efficacy but may also contribute 
to other improved outcomes including employability.8 The asset narrative shifts the focus 
to what’s working, with core elements that include highlighting the strengths patients and 
families bring to the current situation and building self-efficacy as a means of increasing 
resilience and control. It focuses on values, meaning, joy, and love to find sustainment in 
the midst of challenges, and a future orientation that includes not only physical decline but 
also the opportunity for spiritual and personal growth. Working within this narrative creates 
greater opportunities for patients, families, and clinicians to bring their full humanity and 
creativity to bear on improving QOL and allows for more opportunities to attain satisfying 
outcomes. It also aligns with more recent research that stresses the importance of meaning-
making and self-efficacy as a therapeutic strategy for improving person- and family-centered 
outcomes.9–13

Bringing the Total Enjoyment of Life Framework into Patient Care

The “total enjoyment of life” framework is a positive and complementary counterpoint to 
the “total pain of illness” framework that can be used by clinical teams and researchers to 
systematically assess and promote opportunities for joy in serious illness.14 To apply this 
framework clinically, one can start with general questions such as: “What do you enjoy?,” 
“What do you look forward to?,” and, for persons who do not report current enjoyment of 
life, “Tell me about what you enjoyed doing before this illness.” Within this framework, 
there are five dimensions of living that can be further explored to find opportunities for 
enjoyment (Fig. 1). Asking pertinent questions in clinical settings can elicit responses 
related to these dimensions (Table 1). Briefly, these dimensions are:

1.

Physical: within the physical dimension, enjoyment is tied to pleasure and the 
physical senses. Opportunities for joy may range, based on one’s abilities, from 
complex physical activities (e.g., skiing), to simple motion (e.g., walking), to 
more passive pleasures (e.g., favorite foods, touch, pleasant sounds). Exploration 
of this dimension may be particularly fruitful in persons with profound cognitive 
or physical disability, where more complex forms of enjoyment are not possible.

Emotional: within the emotional dimension, enjoyment is tied to happiness 
and other positive emotions such as hope, gratitude, awe, and contentment. 
Opportunities to enhance these emotions could include conscious attitudes (e.g.,

positive reframing), daily reminders (e.g., a mantra or inspirational quote), or 
congruent activities (e.g., watching a comedy).15

Cognitive: within the cognitive dimension, enjoyment is linked to meaning, 
learning, and intellectual pursuits. Opportunities to engage with meaning could 
include cognitively stimulating activities (e.g., reading, learning a new skill) or 
meaning-centered therapies (e.g., dignity therapy).11

Social: within the social dimension, enjoyment comes from love and meaningful 
relationships. Opportunities to build relationships could include spending time 
with friends and family, finding new social outlets (e.g., support groups, classes), 
and seeking other means of staying connected (e.g., phone, teleconference, or 
letters).

Spiritual: within the spiritual dimension, enjoyment comes from transcendence 
and connection to inner and outer sources of peace, love, and hope. Exploration 
of this dimension could include engagement with formal religious or spiritual 
practices and communities (e.g., church, prayer, meditation), spiritually informed 
counseling (e.g., working with a chaplain), or personal and intuitive practices 
(e.g., journaling, sitting in a favorite spot).

From a clinical perspective, bringing these concepts together in team-based care could 
include making an assessment for opportunities for enjoyment part of routine care, with 
more focused emphasis coming on critical care or life events. For example, for a patient 
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a clinical team might work with the patient and 
family to make the most of activities involving travel or ambulatory function if predictable 
losses in coming months could preclude certain enjoyable activities. While making large 
“bucket list” events may be important to some individuals,16 anticipate that small victories 
involving ordinary things will be more common and often equally impactful. Asking 
concrete questions such as, “what is one thing you could do to tomorrow to increase 
pleasure (or meaning or…)?” can be a good strategy to build patient engagement and 
identify opportunities for attainable victories. As will be discussed in more detail below, 
the intent of “total enjoyment” is not to deny the suffering or difficult realities of serious 
neurologic illness. It is sometimes helpful for clinicians to make an explicit statement about 
these intentions before talking about the plans for a visit, “As we work with you, we want to 
make sure you and your family feel safe discussing your suffering with our team and finding 
support for it. We also want to give you and your family encouragement to enjoy the time 
you have and to find opportunities for joy, love, and meaning when possible.”

The Need for Joy, Meaning, and Connection for Family and Carers

Applying a framework of total enjoyment to the role of carers may seem antithetical, as 
the etymology of the word “care” is “grief” and “suffering of the mind.” It is no surprise 
then that the act of “caregiving” is often framed in the context of burden, stress, and 
strain. “Caregiver burden” has been defined as “ the extent to which caregivers perceive 
that caregiving has an adverse effect on their emotional, social, financial, physical, and 
spiritual functioning.”17 As a result, “caregiver burden” across neurological illnesses has 
been clinically assessed and studied with ample evidence of multiple associated factors. For

example, higher carer burden is associated with greater physical impairment and disability 
among those with ALS,18 MS,19 and PD.20 It is also known that carers can experience 
greater depression and anxiety and worse QOL.19,21 Carers’ emotional and spiritual distress 
is often tied to witnessing with no recourse the progressive functional and mental decline of 
their loved ones.22,23 Knowledge of high “burden” is a starting place for acknowledging the 
need to support carers. However, pitted against the intractable nature of these neurological 
illnesses, a singular focus on “caregiver burden” can be further demoralizing for carers and 
clinicians alike. It would appear that finding joy, let alone sustaining joy, among carers is a 
battle lost even before it begins because it is hard to conceive of joy in the midst of suffering 
and burden.

And yet, that is exactly what is needed: to shift attention to the places where joy can and 
does exist. This is a paradigm shift that is not only an opportunity to revisit caregiving in 
neurological illness as comprising the bad and the good but also a necessity borne of chasing 
the unattainable goal of eliminating suffering. If carers are only asked about the burden 
and hardships associated with caregiving, then that is all that will be found. Asking and 
exploring their moments of joy provides both carers and clinicians an opportunity to find joy 
that must seem elusive in the midst of suffering.

The positive aspects of caregiving include reappraisal of difficult situations, opportunities for 
personal growth, and feelings of gratitude and love, and as Zarit pointed out these aspects 
are “more than looking on the bright side.24” In dementia caregiving, there is evidence of 
satisfaction, gratitude, sense of personal accomplishment, personal growth, and sense of 
purpose.25–27 These positive aspects of caregiving are also noted in MS,28 ALS,28 and PD.29

Applying the framework of total enjoyment to family carers provides an opportunity to go 
beyond burden and creates a space for clinicians and carers to acknowledge and intentionally 
identify areas of joy. For example, we can begin by asking carers “What made you smile this 
past week?” or “Who can make you laugh or is a comforting presence?” Carers are known 
to respond with examples of grandchildren or friends, even if those people are not physically 
close by to support them. Such questions not only shift attention away from the heavy 
challenges of caregiving but can serve as a reminder that there are always some hidden 
spaces where comfort and joy exist. While suffering and burden are apparent in caregiving, 
joy demands an intentional awareness. The most salient attributes of joy are its temporal and 
spontaneous nature (it is a sudden and transient moment) that we become aware of and that 
help us feel connected and content in the moment.30 When supporting carers, clinicians may 
need to remind themselves and carers of these attributes and pay attention to how joy can 
and does exist even in the midst of challenges.

Described below are the opportunities for enjoyment for carers within the five dimensions of 
living within the Total Enjoyment of Life Framework (See Table 1 for examples of questions 
that can be asked of caregivers to elicit responses related to these dimensions).

Physical

The simple act of holding hands or touch can lighten a moment and be a shared positive 
experience for both patients and carers. Physical aspects of caregiving can include feeding

patients with physical and cognitive difficulties that preclude self-feeding. In many cultures, 
feeding is viewed as an act of nurturing and affection.31

Emotional

Cognitive

Social

Spiritual

This dimension provides several opportunities for joy that have already been noted among 
carers of persons with dementia. These include opportunities for gratitude, calm, humor, 
and pride. Paying attention to instances of perceived caregiving competency often gives 
carers satisfaction that they are able to provide good care and enhances their self-efficacy. 
Similarly, moments of shared laughter, spending time together, feeling closeness, and love28 
contribute to the appreciation of the positive aspects of caregiving. Opportunities to enhance 
these emotions begin with asking carers to share such moments. Interventions such as the 
Life Enhancing Activities for Family Caregivers (LEAF) are based on positive psychology 
and have demonstrated enhancement of positive emotions and skill building.32 The LEAF 
intervention provides a space to explore positive events, gratitude, self-care, focusing on 
personal strengths, and positive reappraisal of stressful events.

For carers, this dimension can include finding meaning through building memories 
together as well as reminiscing. Meaning making therapeutic strategies33,34 and the use 
of photographs and sharing of life stories can help carers find joy in past experiences and at 
the same time build legacy.

Carers often emphasize the value of family and the bonds that facilitate sharing of 
experiences.35 Beyond the family, carers can be encouraged to improve social support by 
connecting with other carers through support groups. Many carer support groups nationwide 
are now virtual and therefore more accessible. Additionally, there may be opportunities to 
interact with former carers through clinics that provide opportunities for “peer mentorship.”

Finding meaning and purpose in caregiving often promotes spiritual well-being and 
opportunities for personal growth. Stressful situations can activate spirituality, which in turn 
can enhance positive aspects of caregiving.36 Reappraisal of stressful situations can include 
finding meaning and tapping into spiritual or religious beliefs. Chaplains and social workers 
trained in supporting the existential and spiritual needs of carers are vital members of a care 
team who can explore carers’ values and provide support as needed.

Relevance for Neurologists and Other Health Care Providers

The cultivation of joy has implications for health care professionals as well as patients as a 
value in itself, a key component of self-care, and possibly a salve for burnout. Gilmartin and 
Saint have written about this in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, where 
isolation was both a risk and a reality for health care professionals of many disciplines.37 
Serwint and Stewart describe how being open to the meaning and the larger implications 
of clinical work can itself lead to joy.38 Although they discuss this phenomenon in the

setting of pediatrics, the implications are relevant for professionals in neurology and any 
other setting. In the nursing literature, colleagues have postulated that joy might be a key 
component in reducing nursing burnout. In an article for the American Association of 
Critical Care Nurses, Fitzpatrick et al discuss interdisciplinary rounds and leadership focus 
as mechanisms for integrating joy into the workplace.39

This line of thinking for health care providers is not new. Almost a decade ago, in response 
to multiple studies40 that documented increasing burnout in multiple physician specialties, 
the Institute for Healthcare Improvement called for four basic steps to restore joy in health 
care.41 These steps included asking staff “what matters to you?”; identifying the unique 
impediments to joy in the local context; committing to making joy in work a shared 
responsibility at all levels; using improvement science to test validated approaches in your 
organization. Importantly, the authors suggested that the cultivation of joy has implications 
beyond reducing burnout, including its impact on patients and a reduction of turnover.

How do we recognize, assess, document, and share our own joy? We offer four steps in this 
process (Fig. 2).

First is a pause to ask ourselves: “Where have I found joy today? Where do I hope to find 
it?” The locus of joy may be in a patient care experience, an experience with a colleague, or 
an experience completely outside the workplace. An example in the setting of patient care 
is the concept of “sacred moments”: deeply meaningful (and often brief) experiences with 
patients that may lead to joy.42 The crucial step is the pause to ask the question and to think 
broadly about where we experience joy.

Second is an assessment of the experience of joy: “What is it about this experience that is 
bringing me joy? Is it telling me something about myself? Is it resonating with a personal 
experience of my own or a part of me? Is it helping me gain a new perspective? Is it helping 
me to see a colleague in a new light?” For example, when asked what her goal was in 
visiting a hospitalized patient, a colleague at a meeting answered, “I really enjoy seeing 
this patient.” On further reflection, she described their visits as emotionally meaningful, 
and she wondered if her feeling of enjoyment was mirroring his feelings. This step taps on 
clinicians’ experiences with patients when assessing what is underlying a symptom, a sign, 
or any finding. Importantly, it need not be only “traditional” providers (e.g., physicians and 
advanced practice providers) who can engage in this assessment, or a differential diagnosis 
of joy. In this case, the “finding” is that what any health care professional is assessing is joy, 
and the task is to assess what is underlying it: “What are the factors that are making me feel 
joyful at this moment? Is it something about my state? Is it something about the situation I 
am experiencing? The interaction between those two? Why is this important?” Like with the 
assessment of a patient, the hypothesis is that understanding what is underlying a finding can 
help us to manage it. While clinical management has the goal of leading to the alleviation, 
improvement or elimination of a symptom or a finding, the management of joy is actually 
the opposite: the goal of assessment is to identify the conditions that led to an experience of 
joy in order to help it happen again.

A third step in this sequence is documentation. This step helps to highlight and preserve 
the joy experienced. We can document joy in a personal way for ourselves (such as a 
journal) or document and share in a public way (one that respects privacy and intimacy 
if the situation involves a patient). The hypothesis is that the act of documenting (and the 
accompanying reflection) can help amplify and preserve the experience of joy. The act of 
journaling, specifically around gratitude, has received attention in a number of settings in 
recent years for patients43 and health care workers.44 In both settings, it has been shown to 
have psychological benefits. Although related, joy is a broader concept than gratitude, and 
the act of recording or journaling can help reinforce the experience.

Finally, sharing might also be a key component to preserving and connecting with others 
about joyful experiences. As described above, journaling is usually a private experience. 
“What would it mean and what would it look like to share moments of joy with each other as 
colleagues?” We usually share difficult moments with peers and colleagues. This can be both 
therapeutic and can also veer into “venting.” Connecting to patients and families who are 
suffering is clearly multidimensional, and the identification of joy is not meant to diminish 
the sadness that is often present in the lives of patients and families. That is not to say that 
the recognition of suffering is unimportant. It is a vital part of the work of palliative care. 
But sharing moments of joy and meaning is an equally vital and necessary balance to these 
harder moments.

Sharing moments of joy in the course of clinical work might take the form of a daily pause 
in rounds to simply ask ourselves, “what brought you joy today?” Or during a weekly time 
at a team meeting. A more complex task is considering how to share in a lasting form: the 
expansion of journal sections devoted to reflective essays are examples of settings where 
joyful moments are shared. Sharing moments of joy like this might benefit from a cycle that 
can build on itself, as sharing with others could encourage them to then recognize, assess, 
and share their own moments of joy.

Avoiding Toxic Positivity

One potential critique of this perspective is that it might lead to “toxic positivity.” Generally 
thought of in the lay literature as “the act of avoiding, suppressing, or rejecting negative 
emotions or experiences,”45 this concept has begun receiving attention in the health care 
literature.46 The danger of toxic positivity is the disregard for a person’s negative emotions 
such as anger, fear, or grief that could make them feel inadequate.47 However, denying the 
positive for fear of it being toxic deprives us of the opportunity to reap the many benefits 
of positivity. Moving beyond the negativity bias and considering positivity and joy can open 
doors to appreciation, thriving, and creative resources.48,49 Thus, the recognition of joy in 
our work as health care professionals can drown out the harder experiences of witnessing 
suffering.

Creating Space for Both the Positive and Negative Aspects of Illness and 

Life

Paying attention to the positive is not intended to imply that the suffering and challenges 
of serious neurological illnesses do not exist. On the contrary, exploring the positive along 
with the challenges provides patients, carers, and clinicians with a more balanced approach 
to the illness experience. Inviting patients and carers to share their joys can open the door to 
acknowledging that the positive and negative can coexist.

Likening the human condition to a “guest house,” the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi draws 
our attention to the often forgotten but simple fact that we are all visited “every morning” 
by the arrival of myriad contrary emotions and feelings such as joy, sorrow, meanness, or 
laughter. In inviting us to “treat each guest honorably,” Rumi throws light on the importance 
of acknowledging and accepting the impermanence of contradictory emotions, as they 
often can and do coexist. In a longitudinal study of carers of men with AIDS, Folkman 
described the co-occurrence of positive and negative states in the midst of stressful situations 
throughout the caregiving experience and later in bereavement.50 Folkman quotes a carer 
who said, “There is a duality in my life. There’s the hole caused by Jim’s death, and yet 
there’s also the ability to enjoy life. I just need to accept the fact that both aspects are there, 
and they can coexist.”50 Acceptance may require practice in paying intentional attention to 
the duality in everyday experiences. In inviting patients and carers to hold both truths of 
the positive and negative simultaneously, we can balance the scale of the illness experience, 
perhaps tip it away from burden, stress, and suffering, and open the doors to recognizing and 
attending to moments of joy.

Future Directions for Integrating Joy into the Practice of Neurology

By broadening the goals of medicine and neurology to include joy, meaning, love, and 
other positive life outcomes, we have an opportunity to radically expand the impact and 
scope of our work, and in the process enhance our own enjoyment and satisfaction in our 
clinical, research, educational, and advocacy work. As discussed above, there are many 
means by which these ideas can be integrated into clinical care, including expanding our 
histories to go beyond the present illness to the living person, and expanding our plans to 
address not only sources of suffering but also opportunities for joy, meaning, and love. As 
with anything important in medicine, a systematic and comprehensive approach to these 
issues is recommended. For example, adding questions into a patient history intake form on 
life before the diagnosis, or sources of meaning and support, could help clinicians better 
understand the person with the illness. Such questions may also provide an opportunity for 
documenting positive outcomes in note templates or previsit surveys. Similarly the practice 
of asking patients to bring in a photograph that highlights who they are as a person,51 as well 
as having questions on previsit surveys on what they enjoy and look forward to, can greatly 
enrich visits and set a tone for a more personal and engaging model of care.

There are several ways these concepts can be applied to research as well. First, interventions 
can be designed to enhance positive dimensions of living, even for patients with serious 
illness and at end-of-life.52 Second, utilizing or developing positive outcome measures

is a means of better capturing what matters most to patients and families and inspiring 
interventions to aim for these types of outcomes.53–58 Lastly, positive interventions may 
be utilized as a means of enhancing the effectiveness and engagement of behavioral 
interventions, as well as to attain a wide range of outcomes including to directly address 
pain and suffering.15,59–62

These concepts can be applied to education as well, where changes can be made not only 
to the content of what is taught (e.g., how to incorporate asset-based narratives into clinical 
work), but also to the approach to education as well as relationships with trainees. This 
includes prioritizing trainee well-being as an important educational outcome, and the use of 
nontraditional techniques to support the whole person of trainees.

Finally, when considering opportunities for advocacy, there is a need to include the 
positive when framing the goals of medicine for all stakeholders. This is consistent with 
broader societal movements to move beyond economic measures in assessing the success of 
communities and nations.63

Conclusion

There are significant opportunities to improve the lives of persons living with serious 
neurologic illnesses, their families, and health care providers by integrating joy, meaning, 
and love into the goals of medicine. These concepts can enrich clinical care, research, 
education, and advocacy efforts.
