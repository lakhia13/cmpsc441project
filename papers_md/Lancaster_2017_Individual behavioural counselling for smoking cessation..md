Background

Individual counselling from a smoking cessation specialist may help smokers to make a successful attempt to stop smoking.

A B S T R A C T

Objectives

The review addresses the following hypotheses:

1. Individual counselling is more effective than no treatment or brief advice in promoting smoking cessation.
2. Individual counselling is more effective than self-help materials in promoting smoking cessation.
3. A more intensive counselling intervention is more effective than a less intensive intervention.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for studies with counsel* in any field in May 2016.

Selection criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized trials with at least one treatment arm consisting of face-to-face individual counselling from a healthcare
worker  not  involved  in  routine  clinical  care.  The  outcome  was  smoking  cessation  at  follow-up  at  least  six  months  after  the  start  of
counselling.

Data collection and analysis

Both  authors  extracted  data  in  duplicate.  We  recorded  characteristics  of  the  intervention  and  the  target  population,  method  of
randomization  and  completeness  of  follow-up.  We  used  the  most  rigorous  definition  of  abstinence  in  each  trial,  and  biochemically-
validated rates where available. In analysis, we assumed that participants lost to follow-up continued to smoke. We expressed effects as
a risk ratio (RR) for cessation. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model. We assessed the
quality of evidence within each study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the GRADE approach.

Main results

We  identified  49  trials  with  around  19,000  participants.  Thirty-three  trials  compared  individual  counselling  to  a  minimal  behavioural
intervention. There was high-quality evidence that individual counselling was more effective than a minimal contact control (brief advice,
usual care, or provision of self-help materials) when pharmacotherapy was not offered to any participants (RR 1.57, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.40 to 1.77; 27 studies, 11,100 participants; I2 = 50%). There was moderate-quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) of a
benefit of counselling when all participants received pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy) (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.51; 6
studies, 2662 participants; I2 = 0%). There was moderate-quality evidence (downgraded due to imprecision) for a small benefit of more

intensive counselling compared to brief counselling (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.53; 11 studies, 2920 participants; I2 = 48%). None of the five
other trials that compared different counselling models of similar intensity detected significant differences.

Authors' conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that individually-delivered smoking cessation counselling can assist smokers to quit. There is moderate-
quality evidence of a smaller relative benefit when counselling is used in addition to pharmacotherapy, and of more intensive counselling
compared to a brief counselling intervention.

P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y

Does individually-delivered counselling help people to stop smoking?

Background

Individual counselling is commonly used to help people who are trying to quit smoking. The review looked at trials of counselling by a
trained therapist providing one or more face-to-face sessions, separate from medical care. The outcome was being a non smoker at least
six months later.

Study characteristics

We searched for trials in May 2016 and identified 49 trials Inlcuding around 19,000 participants. All the trials involved one or more face-
to-face counselling sessions lasting at least 10 minutes, but most were much longer. Many also included further telephone contact for
additional support. Thirty-three of the trials compared individual counselling to a control group that only had minimal support, which
could be usual care, brief advice about stopping smoking, or written materials. Of these, 27 did not offer any medication such as nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT), which also helps people stop. Six of the 33 provided NRT or other medication to everyone in the trial. Twelve
studies compared more intensive to less intensive counselling, and five compared different types of counselling.

Results and quality of evidence

Combining the results of the studies showed that having individual counselling could increase the chance of quitting by between 40% and
80%, compared to minimal support. This means that if seven out of 100 smokers managed to quit for at least six months using the sort
of brief support given to the control groups, then between 10 and 12 in 100 would be expected to be successful after having counselling.
We judged the quality of this evidence to be high. If everyone also had NRT or other medication, and 11 in 100 could quit in the control
group, between 11 and 16 in 100 would be expected to be successful with the addition of counselling. We assessed this evidence as being
of moderate quality, because the size of benefit was less certain. Having more intensive counselling support, for example more sessions,
probably helps more, but the additional benefit is likely to be small, and again was of moderate quality because the size of benefit was
uncertain. The few studies that compared different types of counselling did not show any differences between them.

Types of interventions

Psychological interventions to aid smoking cessation include self-
help  materials,  brief  therapist-delivered  interventions  such  as
advice  from  a  physician  or  nurse,  intensive  counselling  delivered
on  an  individual  basis  or  in  a  group,  and  combinations  of  these
approaches. Previous reviews have shown a small but consistent
effect of brief, therapist-delivered interventions (Stead 2013a). The
effect  of  self-help  interventions  is  less  clear  (Hartmann-Boyce
2014). More intensive intervention in a group setting increases quit
rates (Stead 2017).

In  this  review,  we  assess  the  effectiveness  of  more  intensive
counselling  delivered  by  a  smoking  cessation  counsellor  to  a
person  on  a  one-to-one  basis.  One  problem  in  assessing  the
value  of  individual  counselling  is  that  of  confounding  with  other
interventions.  For  example,  counselling  delivered  by  a  physician
in  the  context  of  a  clinical  encounter  may  have  different  effects
from that provided by a non-clinical counsellor. One approach to
this problem is to employ statistical modelling (logistic regression)
to  control  for  possible  confounders,  an  approach  used  by  the
US  Public  Health  Service  in  preparing  clinical  practice  guidelines
(AHCPR 1996; Fiore 2000; Fiore 2008). An alternative approach is to
review only unconfounded interventions. This is the approach we
have  adopted  in  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Review  Group.
We  therefore  specifically  exclude  from  this  review  counselling
provided by doctors or nurses during the routine clinical care of the
patient, and focus on smoking cessation counselling delivered by
specialist counsellors. We define counselling broadly, based only on
a minimum time spent in contact with the smoker, not according to
the use of any specific behavioural approach.

O B J E C T I V E S

The review addresses the following hypotheses:

1. Individual counselling is more effective than no treatment or brief
advice in promoting smoking cessation.
2. Individual counselling is more effective than self-help materials
in promoting smoking cessation.
3. A more intensive counselling intervention is more effective than
a less intensive intervention.

We  defined  individual  counselling  as  a  face-to-face  encounter
between  a  smoker  and  a  counsellor  trained  in  assisting  smoking
cessation. This review specifically excludes studies of counselling
delivered  by  doctors  and  nurses  as  part  of  clinical  care,  which
are  covered  in  separate  reviews  (Rice  2013;  Stead  2013a).  It  also
excludes studies of interventions that combined counselling with
provision  of  pharmacotherapy,  compared  to  brief  support  (Stead
2016), studies of motivational interviewing (Lindson-Hawley 2015)
and interventions which address multiple risk factors in addition to
smoking. We include studies that evaluate the effect of counselling
as an addition to pharmacotherapy.

We  include  studies  comparing  different  counselling  approaches
if  they  are  not  covered  by  other  Cochrane  Reviews  of  specific
interventions.  Comparisons  between  individual  counselling  and
behavioural  therapy  conducted  in  groups  are  covered  in  the
Cochrane Review of group behavioural therapy (Stead 2017).

Types of outcome measures

The  outcome  was  smoking  cessation  at  the  longest  reported
follow-up.  We  used  sustained  abstinence  where  available,  or
multiple  point  prevalence.  We  included  studies  using  self-report
with or without biochemically-validated cessation, and performed
sensitivity  analyses  to  determine  whether  the  estimates  differed
significantly in studies without verification.

Search methods for identification of studies

We  searched  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Group  Specialized
Register  for  studies  with  counsel*  in  title,  abstract  or  keyword
fields.  At  the  time  of  the  search  the  Register  included  the  results
of  searches  of  the  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  trials
(CENTRAL), issue 4, 2016; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20160513;
EMBASE  (via  OVID)  to  week  201621;  PsycINFO  (via  OVID)  to
update 20160516. See the Tobacco Addiction Group Module in the
Cochrane Library for full search strategies and list of other resources
searched. We also checked previous reviews and meta-analyses for
relevant studies, including all studies in the previous US guidelines
(AHCPR 1996; Fiore 2000; Fiore 2008). The most recent search was
conducted in May 2016.

M E T H O D S

Data collection and analysis

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomized  or  quasi-randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  with  a
minimum  follow-up  of  six  months,  where  at  least  one  treatment
arm consisted of an unconfounded intervention from a counsellor.
Studies  in  which  the  treatment  arm  combined  counselling  and
pharmacotherapy,  and  the  control  condition  had  neither,  are
covered in a separate review (Stead 2016).

One author (LS, who is also the Cochrane Information Specialist for
the Tobacco Addiction Group) prescreened results of the searches.
Both  authors  checked  reports  of  studies  of  potentially  relevant
interventions.

Both authors extracted data independently.

Information extracted included descriptive details on the setting of
the study, the population, and details of intervention(s) and control
conditions, including number and duration of planned sessions.

Types of participants

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Any  smokers,  except  pregnant  women  (smoking  cessation
interventions  in  pregnancy  are  addressed  by  a  separate  review,
Chamberlain 2013). We also exclude trials recruiting only children
and adolescents.

We  assessed  risk  of  selection,  detection  and  attrition  bias,
based  on  the  reported  methods  of  randomization  and  allocation
concealment (selection bias), use of biochemical validation of self-
reported abstinence (detection bias) and numbers lost to follow-up
(attrition bias).

Measures of treatment effect & data synthesis

We  summarized  individual  study  results  as  a  risk  ratio  (RR),
calculated  as:  (number  of  quitters  in  intervention  group/number
randomized to intervention group) / (number of quitters in control
group/number  randomized  to  control  group).  We  assumed  that
participants  lost  to  follow-up  continued  to  smoke  and  included
them as such in denominators. Where appropriate we performed
meta-analysis  using  a  Mantel-Haenszel  fixed-effect  method  to
estimate  a  pooled  risk  ratio  with  a  95%  confidence  interval
(CI)  (Greenland  1985).  We  estimated  the  amount  of  statistical
heterogeneity  between  trials  using  the  I2  statistic  (Higgins  2003).
Values over 50% can be regarded as moderate heterogeneity, and
values over 75% as high.

We made the following comparisons:

• Individual counselling versus no treatment, brief advice or self-

help materials

• More intensive versus less intensive individual counselling
• Comparisons  between  counselling  methods  matched  for

contact time

Description of studies

We  include  49  studies  in  this  updated  review,  with  around
19,000  participants.  Thirty-three  studies 
for  this
update)  contribute  to  the  primary  analysis  comparing  individual
counselling to a minimal contact behavioural intervention. Eleven
studies (six new) compared different intensities of counselling and
five (two new) compared different counselling approaches which
were similar in intensity of contact.

(11  new 

In  a  few  cases  we  resolved  difficulties  in  applying  the  inclusion
criteria  by  discussion.  In  two  cases  (Wiggers  2006;  Aveyard  2007)
we were uncertain whether the providers were acting as specialist
counsellors or were providing interventions as part of usual care in
other healthcare roles. We included both after discussion about this
aspect of their designs. We included one study that had only five
months follow-up (Kim 2005).

Study populations

Nineteen  of  the  49  studies  recruited  medical  or  surgical  hospital
inpatients  (Pederson  1991;  Ockene  1992;  Stevens  1993;  Rigotti
1997;  Simon  1997;  Dornelas  2000;  Molyneux  2003;  Simon  2003;
Hennrikus  2005;  Pedersen  2005;  Brunner  2012),  or  outpatients
(Weissfeld 1991; Kim 2005; Tonnesen 2006; Hennrikus 2010; Chan
2012; Ramon 2013; Thankappan 2013; Chen 2014). One recruited
some  inpatients  (Schmitz  1999).  Four  other  studies  recruited
drug-  and  alcohol-dependent  veterans  attending  residential
rehabilitation  (Bobo  1998;  Burling  1991;  Burling  2001;  Mueller
2012).  One  study  recruited  new  mothers  in  maternity  wards
(Hannover 2009); we considered the subgroup of trial participants
who were smoking at this point. Other studies recruited smokers
in  primary  care  clinics  (Fiore  2004;  Aveyard  2007;  Marley  2014;
Ramos 2010), dental clinics (Nohlert 2009), primary care and local
community  (Aleixandre  1998),  local  community  and  university
(Alterman 2001), communities and worksites (Nakamura 2004), at
a  periodic  healthcare  examination  (Bronson  1989),  at  a  Planned
Parenthood  clinic  (Glasgow  2000),  employees  volunteering  for

participants in a lung cancer screening study (Marshall 2016), and
community volunteers (Jorenby 1995; Lifrak 1997; Ahluwalia 2006;
Killen 2008; McCarthy 2008, Wu 2009; Garvey 2012; Kim 2015). Lack
of interest in quitting was not an explicit exclusion criterion in any
study, but the level of motivation to quit smoking was sometimes
difficult  to  assess.  One  trial  enrolled  all  smokers  admitted  to
hospital  (Stevens  1993),  whilst  one  enrolled  90%  of  smokers
approached (Rigotti 1997). In one large study in primary care 68%
of smokers agreed to participate and 52% met the inclusion criteria
and were recruited (Fiore 2004). In other studies a larger proportion
of eligible smokers may have declined randomization because of
lack of interest in quitting.

Special  populations 
included  Australian  Aboriginal  people
(Marley  2014),  homeless  people  (Okuyemi  2013),  people  under
community  corrections  supervision  (Cropsey  2015)  and  people
with  schizophrenia  (Williams  2010).  Two  studies  recruited  Asian
minority populations in the US; Kim 2015 (Koreans) and Wu 2009
(Chinese), and one recruited African Americans (Ahluwalia 2006).

Two  studies  recruited  only  women:  Schmitz  1999  recruited  53
women  hospitalized  with  coronary  artery  disease  (CAD)  and  107
volunteers  with  CAD  risk  factors.  Glasgow  2000  recruited  women
attending Planned Parenthood clinics, who were not selected for
motivation to quit. Weissfeld 1991 recruited only men, while Simon
2003 and Nakamura 2004 recruited predominantly men.

Thirty studies were conducted in the USA, three in Spain (Aleixandre
1998; Ramos 2010; Ramon 2013), three in Denmark (Pedersen 2005;
Tonnesen  2006;  Brunner  2012),  two  in  the  UK  (Molyneux  2003;
Aveyard 2007), two in Australia (Marley 2014; Marshall 2016), and
one each in Germany (Hannover 2009), Switzerland (Mueller 2012),
Sweden  (Nohlert  2009),  Netherlands  (Wiggers  2006),  Hong  Kong
(Chan  2012),  China  (Chen  2014),  Japan  (Nakamura  2004),  Korea
(Kim 2005), and India (Thankappan 2013).

Intervention components

The  counselling  interventions  typically  included  the  following
components:  review  of  a  participant's  smoking  history  and
motivation to quit, help in the identification of high-risk situations,
and  the  generation  of  problem-solving  strategies  to  deal  with
such situations. Counsellors may also have provided non-specific
support  and  encouragement.  Some  studies  provided  additional
components  such  as  written  materials,  video  or  audiotapes.
The  main  components  used  in  each  study  are  shown  in  the
Characteristics of included studies tables.

Intervention providers

The  therapists  who  provided  the  counselling  were  generally
described  as  smoking  cessation  counsellors.  Their  professional
backgrounds included social work, psychology, psychiatry, health
education  and  nursing.  In  one  study,  the  therapist  for  some  of
the sessions was a nurse practitioner (Alterman 2001), and in two
others  the  therapists  were  research  doctors  or  nurses  trained  in
counselling (Molyneux 2003; Hennrikus 2005). In Aveyard 2007 all
the  support  was  from  primary  care  nurses  who  were  not  full-
time counsellors. We included this study because the nurses were
trained  to  provide  counselling  support  as  part  of  the  National
Health Service Stop Smoking Services and were not offering it as
part of usual care. In Tonnesen 2006 the counselling was provided
by  nurses  employed  in  a  lung  clinic,  and  in  Wiggers  2006  it  was
provided by nurse practitioners in a cardiology outpatient clinic.

Studies with minimal contact controls

In  the  33  studies  with  a  minimal  contact  control  the  treatments
offered to the control comparison group ranged from usual care to
up to 15 minutes of advice, with or without the provision of self-
help materials. To be classified as individual counselling the trials
had to involve at least one session with face-to-face contact lasting
more than 10 minutes, although the duration was typically much
longer. The face-to-face counselling in Kim 2005 was the shortest,
at  only  11  minutes  on  average.  Three  tested  a  single  face-to-face
session without further support by telephone (Weissfeld 1991 (low-
intensity arm); Molyneux 2003; Marshall 2016). Nine others offered
a  single  face-to-face  session  with  further  support  by  telephone
(Windsor 1988; Weissfeld 1991 (high-intensity arm); Stevens 1993;
Rigotti 1997; Simon 1997; Dornelas 2000; Glasgow 2000; Hennrikus
2005; Kim 2005). All the other studies planned multiple sessions of
face-to-face support, and sometimes also telephone contacts.

In  the  meta-analysis  we  have  not  distinguished  between  brief
advice, usual care or provision of self-help materials as the control
intervention  with  which  counselling  is  compared.  Provision  of
written  materials  was  generally  accompanied  by  brief  advice;  no
trials directly addressed the effect of providing counselling as an
addition to a structured self-help programme. One trial offered 15
minutes of counselling on a healthy diet to controls (Chan 2012),
and one offered autogenic training, a relaxation-based programme
not shown to aid cessation (Mueller 2012).

Within this group of studies, pharmacotherapy was systematically
provided  to  participants  in  all  trial  arms  in  six  trials.  Nicotine
patch  was  provided  to  all  participants  in  Jorenby  1995;  Simon
2003; Fiore 2004; Okuyemi 2013. Cropsey 2015 provided bupropion
to  all  participants.  Wiggers  2006  provided  nicotine  patches  to
participants  ready  to  quit  in  either  trial  arm.  Since  the  use  of
pharmacotherapy  might  change  the  relative  effect  of  additional
counselling,  we  include  these  studies  in  a  subgroup  analysis.  In
one trial (Simon 1997) smokers randomized to receive counselling
were  given  a  prescription  for  nicotine  gum  if  there  were  no
contraindications. Although 65% in the counselling condition used
gum  compared  to  17%  of  the  control  group,  its  use  was  not
significantly associated with quitting.

Studies of counselling intensity

Eleven  studies  compared  intensive  counselling  to  less  intensive
interventions  that  also  met  our  definition  of  counselling  by
involving  more  than  10  minutes  of  face-to-face  contact.  We
considered  these  studies  separately  from  those  using  a  minimal-
contact control. Eight of these studies provided pharmacotherapy
to  all  participants  and  we  included  subgroups  for  studies  with
and without pharmacotherapy. Tonnesen 2006 contributed to both
subgroups.

• Weissfeld 1991 compared two intensities of counselling with a
control; both intensities are combined versus control in the first
analysis but compared in this analysis.

• Lifrak  1997  compared  two  intensities  of  counselling  as  an
adjunct to nicotine patch therapy. The lower-intensity one was
a four-session advice and education intervention from a nurse
practitioner  who  reviewed  self-help  materials  and  monitored
patch  use.  The  higher-intensity  intervention  added  16  weekly
sessions of cognitive behavioural relapse prevention therapy.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• Alterman  2001  used  similar  interventions  to  Lifrak  1997,  but
added  a  lower-intensity  control  of  a  single  30-minute  session
with a nurse practitioner.

• Tonnesen 2006 compared seven visits and five phone calls with
a contact time of 4½ hours to four visits and six calls taking 2½
hours. This trial had a factorial design, also comparing a nicotine
sublingual  tablet  and  placebo;  we  entered  the  arms  with  and
without NRT in separate subgroups.

• Aveyard  2007  compared  seven  weekly  contacts  with  four
contacts  for  people  receiving  cessation  support  with  nicotine
patches.

• Killen 2008 provided six counselling session and combined NRT
and bupropion, and compared different schedules of extended
contact.

• Nohlert  2009  compared  eight  40-minute  sessions  over  four
months with a single 30-minute session introducing a self-help
programme.

• Wu  2009  compared 

four  60-minute  culturally-tailored
counselling  sessions  to  four  60-minute  health  education
sessions  covering  general  health,  nutrition,  exercise  and
tobacco. All sessions were in Chinese, and all participants were
offered nicotine patch.

• Williams  2010  compared  24  weekly  45-minute  counselling
sessions to nine 20-minute sessions that focused on medication
management. All participants were given nicotine patches.
• Brunner  2012  provided  a  30-minute  counselling  session  and
offer of nicotine patch during a hospital stay and tested the effect
of an additional five outpatient sessions including free samples
of NRT; we included this in the non-pharmacotherapy subgroup,
as it was not provided as standard to all participants.

• Kim  2015  compared  eight  weekly  40-minute  sessions  of
culturally-tailored  counselling  to  eight  10-minute  sessions
focusing on medication management. All participants received
nicotine patches.

Studies of counselling methods or timing

Five studies compared different counselling approaches that had
similar  contact  times.  We  considered  these  separately  from  the
groups above.

• Schmitz 1999 involved six one-hour sessions. One intervention
used a coping skills relapse prevention model. It was compared
with  a  health  belief  model  that  focused  on  smoking-related
health information, the relationship with coronary disease and
the benefits of quitting.

• Ahluwalia  2006  provided  three  face-to-face  visits  and  three
phone  contacts  extending  over  six  weeks,  and  2  mg  nicotine
gum  for  eight  weeks.  One  intervention  used  motivational
interviewing and the other a health education focus.

• McCarthy  2008  provided  eight  10-minute  counselling  sessions
during assessment visits in a trial that also compared bupropion
to  placebo.  The  counselling  was  consistent  with  US  practice
guidelines.  The  control  focused  on  medication  use  and
adherence, and general support and encouragement.

• Garvey 2012 compared two different schedules of 14 counselling
sessions,  either  front-loaded  with  six  sessions  in  the  first  two
weeks after quit date, or just two in that period. All participants
received nicotine patches.

• Ramon  2013  directly  compared  delivery  of  counselling  either
entirely face-to-face or with a combination of face-to-face and
telephone to a control group where all contact after the pre-quit
session was by telephone.

Excluded studies

We  excluded  one  study  that  provided  motivational  interviewing
as  part  of  an  intervention  to  reduce  passive  smoke  exposure  in
households with young children (Emmons 2001). Cessation was a
secondary outcome and there was no significant difference in quit
rates,  which  were  not  reported  separately  by  group.  A  sensitivity
analysis including this study assuming equal quit rates did not alter
the review results.

We list 48 other studies identified as potentially relevant but which
did  not  meet  the  full  inclusion  criteria,  with  their  reasons  for
exclusion in the table Characteristics of excluded studies. We note
where studies were included in other Cochrane Reviews.

Risk of bias in included studies

We assessed the risks of selection bias, detection bias and attrition
bias.

Twenty-seven  studies  reported  the  method  for  generating  the
randomization  sequence  in  sufficient  detail  to  be  classified  as
having a low risk of bias, but only 14 also described a method of
allocation likely to ensure that the assignment was concealed until
after allocation, and thus being at low risk of selection bias (Simon
1997;  Weissfeld  1991;  Windsor  1988;  Kim  2005;  Ahluwalia  2006;
Wiggers 2006; Aveyard 2007; Killen 2008; McCarthy 2008; Williams
2010; Chan 2012; Ramon 2013; Marley 2014; Marshall 2016). In most
other  trials,  neither  the  method  of  randomization  nor  the  use  of
allocation concealment was described. We judged five trials to be

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

at high risk of selection bias, due to the method of randomization
or concealment, or both (Stevens 1993; Bobo 1998; Dornelas 2000;
Hannover 2009; Brunner 2012).

We  judged  the  risk  of  detection  bias  to  be  low  if  self-reported
abstinence was confirmed biochemically. Eight studies were at high
risk of bias because no validation was attempted and trial arms had
different  amounts  of  contact  with  study  staff,  making  differential
misreporting  of  abstinence  more  likely  (Bronson  1989;  Stevens
1993; Aleixandre 1998; Pedersen 2005; Nohlert 2009; Thankappan
2013; Kim 2005; Ahluwalia 2006). We rated three studies as unclear;
one  study  tested  for  cotinine  but  did  not  report  validated  rates
(Bobo  1998),  and  in  two  others  validation  was  incomplete  and
results were based on self-report (Pederson 1991; Marshall 2016).

We  judged  the  risk  of  attrition  bias  to  be  low  if  loss  to  follow-
up  was  reported  by  group,  was  no  greater  than  50%  and  not
substantially different between groups. Most studies reported the
number of participants who dropped out or were lost to follow-up,
and included these people as smokers in analysis denominators.
We  judged  most  studies  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias,  because  the
percentage  lost  was  small  and  similar  across  conditions.  We
classified  two  studies  as  being  at  high  risk  (Ramos  2010;  Mueller
2012),  and  one  as  unclear  (Burling  1991).  One  study  (Fiore  2004)
excluded randomized participants who failed to collect their free
supply  of  nicotine  patches,  and  as  a  consequence  also  did  not
receive  any  additional  behavioural  components  to  which  they
were  allocated.  The  proportions  excluded  were  similar  in  all  the
intervention groups, so we have used the denominators as given.

Overall we classified 11 of the 49 included studies (22%) as being
at low risk of bias on all the domains we considered. A summary is
displayed in Figure 1.

of bias from this aspect of design for this group of studies is high.

Counselling versus minimal contact control

We  estimated  a  pooled  effect  size  based  on  33  studies  of
counselling,  including  one  (Burling  1991)  where  there  were  no
quitters  and  which  therefore  did  not  contribute  to  the  meta-
analysis.  The  risk  ratio  (RR)  was  1.48  (95%  confidence  interval
(CI) 1.34 to 1.64, n = 13,762; Analysis 1.1), with some evidence of

heterogeneity (I2 = 46%). Restricting the analysis to seven studies
at low risk of bias on all domains (Windsor 1988; Weissfeld 1991;
Simon 1997; Kim 2005; Wiggers 2006; Chan 2012; Marley 2014) did
not alter the conclusions; the point estimate increased slightly (RR
1.65, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.06). The estimate was higher in the subgroup
of 27 studies where pharmacotherapy was not provided (RR 1.57,
95%  CI  1.40  to  1.77;  n  =  11,100;  I2  =  50%)  than  in  the  six  testing
the additional effect of counselling when participants had access
to  pharmacotherapy  (RR  1.24,  95%  CI  1.01  to  1.51;  n  =  2662;  I2
=  0%)  and  a  test  for  subgroup  difference  detected  a  difference
between subgroups with and without pharmacotherapy. We base
the estimates of absolute effect in Summary of findings for the main
comparison on the subgroup estimates.

More intensive versus less intensive counselling

Eight  of  the  studies  compared  different  levels  of  counselling  as
adjuncts  to  pharmacotherapy,  and  four  did  not  offer  medication
(Tonnesen  2006  contributes  different  arms  to  each  subgroup).
The  estimates  in  the  two  subgroups  overlapped.  Pooling  all  11

studies, there was evidence of a small benefit from more intensive
compared  to  brief  counselling  (RR  1.29,  95%  CI  1.09  to  1.53;  n  =
2920; I2 = 48%; Analysis 2.1), a change from the previous version
of the review in which pooling five studies did not detect evidence
of  benefit.  The  moderate  heterogeneity  was  attributable  to  two
new  studies  with  large  effects.  The  control  groups  in  these  were

distinct, with Wu 2009 offering general health education and Kim
2015  focusing  on  medication  management.  A  sensitivity  analysis
excluding these two studies no longer detected evidence of a dose
response  to  counselling  intensity.  Limiting  the  analysis  to  four
studies at low risk of bias also failed to suggest evidence of benefit.

Comparisons between counselling approaches

We  did  not  pool  these  clinically  heterogeneous  five  studies.
Only  one  of  them  detected  a  significant  difference  between
different  types  of  counselling,  where  number  of  contacts  and
general intensity were similar. Schmitz 1999, comparing a relapse
prevention  approach  to  a  health  belief  model,  showed  no
significant  difference,  but  with  wide  confidence  intervals  (RR
0.94,  95%  CI  0.45  to  1.98;  n  =  160;  analysis  3.1.1).  Ahluwalia
2006 compared a motivational interviewing to a health education
approach and the point estimate favoured the latter (RR 0.51, 95%
CI 0.34 to 0.76; n = 755; analysis 3.1.2). Participants were making
quit  attempts  and  using  nicotine  gum  or  placebo  and  therefore
the  motivational  aspect  may  have  been  less  relevant.  McCarthy
2008 was also a pharmacotherapy trial with a factorial design and
the specific behavioural components did not increase quitting over
instructions about medication and general support (RR 0.93, 95%
CI 0.62 to 1.39; n = 463; analysis 3.1.3). There was no evidence of
an interaction between medication and counselling in either of the
factorial  trials.  Garvey  2012  did  not  show  that  front-loading  the
schedule of sessions was associated with greater quit success, but
CIs did not exclude no effect (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.79 to 4.15; n = 242;
analysis  3.1.4).  Ramon  2013  did  not  detect  a  difference  between
face-to-face  and  telephone  counselling  (RR  1.39,  95%  CI  0.89  to
2.19; n = 301; analysis 3.1.5), or combined contact (face-to-face plus
telephone) versus telephone only (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.25; n =
299), but confidence intervals were again wide.

D I S C U S S I O N

There is consistent evidence that individual counselling increases
the  likelihood  of  cessation  compared  to  less  intensive  support.
Individual  counselling,  used  independently  of  pharmacotherapy,
was estimated to increase cessation by 40% to 80% after at least six
months, based on pooling 27 trials with over 11,000 participants.
Assuming a control group quit rate of 7% from a brief intervention,
the provision of counselling would be expected to result in 10% to
12% quit, an absolute increase of 3% to 5%. We rated the quality
of this evidence as high, using the GRADE approach (Summary of
findings  for  the  main  comparison).  This  estimate  was  based  on
using counselling without any pharmacotherapy. The six trials that
offered pharmacotherapy (typically nicotine replacement therapy)
to all participants had a smaller and less certain effect. Assuming
a  control  quit  rate  of  11%  reflecting  the  benefit  of  medication,
the  addition  of  counselling  could  result  in  an  absolute  increase
of  0%  to  5%.  We  rated  this  as  moderate  quality  using  GRADE,
because of the imprecision of the estimate. It is possible that the
relative  additional  benefit  is  smaller  when  the  quit  rates  in  the
control  group  are  already  increased  by  the  use  of  an  effective
pharmacotherapy, but the absolute benefit of counselling could be
similar, whether or not pharmacotherapy is used.

Almost half the trials recruited people in hospital settings, but there
was no evidence of heterogeneity of results in different settings.

These  results  are  consistent  with  the  US  Public  Health  Service
practice guideline (Fiore 2008), which supports the use of intensive

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

counselling. The guideline evidence in this area is based on meta-
analyses  conducted  for  the  previous  update  of  the  guideline
(Fiore  2000),  and  includes  indirect  comparisons.  These  included
an  analysis  of  58  trials  where  treatment  conditions  differed  in
format  (self-help,  individual  counselling  with  person-to-person
contact,  proactive  telephone  counselling  or  group  counselling)
and  estimated  an  odds  ratio  (OR)  for  successful  cessation  with
individual  counselling  compared  to  no  intervention  of  1.7  (95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.4 to 2.0) (Fiore 2008 Table 6.13). Individual
counselling  in  their  categorization  would  have  also  included
counselling from a physician. When they separately analysed the
effect  of  different  providers  of  care  the  estimates  suggest  that
non-physician clinicians (a category including psychologists, social
workers and counsellors) are similarly effective compared to a no-
provider reference group (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.1) as physicians
(OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.2) (Fiore 2008 Table 6.11).

In  our  review  there  was  no  evidence  of  significant  heterogeneity
between  relative  quit  rates  in  the  different  trials.  Absolute  quit
rates  varied  across  studies  but  this  is  likely  to  be  related  to
the  motivation  of  the  smokers  to  attempt  to  quit  and  the  way
in  which  cessation  was  defined.  Cessation  rates  were  generally
higher  in  trials  where  nicotine  replacement  therapy  (NRT)  was
also used (Alterman 2001; Jorenby 1995; Lifrak 1997; Simon 2003),
although  there  were  exceptions  (Ahluwalia  2006;  Aveyard  2007).
Rates were also higher amongst people with cardiovascular disease
(Ockene 1992 ; Dornelas 2000; Pedersen 2005). Quit rates tended
to be lower in studies recruiting hospitalized patients unselected
for  their  readiness  to  quit  (Stevens  1993;  Rigotti  1997;  Molyneux
2003). All these features of a trial are likely to affect absolute quit
rates,  confounding  a  possible  effect  of  the  exact  content  of  the
intervention.

Whilst  we  took  account  of  the  broad  nature  of  the  support
offered  to  the  control  group  when  pooling  studies,  variation
in  the  components  used  as  part  of,  for  example,  a  usual  care
control, may still give rise to heterogeneity. Treatment effects could
be  underestimated  if  those  studies  using  effective  interventions
tended to provide relatively helpful usual care or brief advice. An
ongoing  systematic  review  is  conducting  a  detailed  analysis  of
behavioural intervention and control elements, and is expected to
provide more evidence about this (de Bruin 2016).

The following description of the intervention used in the Coronary
Artery  Smoking  Intervention  Study  (CASIS)  (Ockene  1992)  is
broadly  typical  of  the  interventions  used:  "The  telephone  and
individual  counseling  sessions  were  based  on  a  behavioral
multicomponent  approach  in  which  counselors  used  a  series  of
open-ended  questions  to  assess  motivation  for  cessation,  areas
of  concern  regarding  smoking  cessation,  anticipated  problems
and possible solutions. Cognitive and behavioral self-management
strategies, presented in the self help materials, were discussed and
reinforced". Although we cannot exclude the possibility that small
differences in components, and in the therapists' training or skills,
have  an  effect  on  the  outcome,  it  is  not  possible  to  detect  such
differences in the meta-analysis.

Most  of  the  counselling  interventions  in  this  review  included
repeated  contact,  but  differed  according  to  whether  face-to-face
or telephone contact was used after an initial meeting. There are
too few trials to draw conclusions from indirect comparisons about
the  relative  efficacy  of  the  various  contact  strategies.  Again,  the
homogeneity of the results suggests that the way in which contact

of  telephone  counselling  suggests  that  telephone  support  aids
quitting (Stead 2013b).

Implications for practice

The  11  trials  that  directly  compared  different  intensities  of
individual support detected only weak evidence of a dose-response
effect  which  was  sensitive  to  exclusion  of  outlying  trials,  and
restriction to trials judged to be at low risk of bias. In some of the
trials  in  this  comparison  the  difference  between  the  counselling
protocols  may  be  too  small  to  affect  long-term  quitting.  The
intended  difference  may  also  be  eroded  if  the  more  intensive
support  cannot  be  consistently  delivered.  Eight  of  the  trials
provided  pharmacotherapy  to  all  participants,  so  were  testing
the  additional  benefit  of  more  intensive  individual  counselling.
As  seen  in  the  trials  offering  pharmacotherapy  in  the  primary
analysis, the relative effect of the additional support may be smaller
in  relation  to  the  higher  rates  of  cessation  in  the  control  arm
receiving  combined  behavioural  and  pharmacological  support.  A
separate Cochrane Review (Stead 2015) has assessed the effect of
increasing  the  amount  of  any  type  of  behavioural  support  when
used alongside pharmacotherapy. It analysed 47 studies including
relevant studies from this review, and concluded that "increasing
the amount of behavioural support is likely to increase the chance
of success by about 10% to 25%". The estimates in this review are
consistent with that range.

Counselling  interventions  given  outside  routine  clinical  care,  by
smoking  cessation  counsellors  including  health  educators  and
psychologists, assist smokers to quit.

Implications for research

Individual  counselling  is  an  established  treatment  for  smoking
cessation. Identifying the most effective and cost-effective intensity
and  duration  of  treatment  for  different  populations  of  smokers
is  still  an  area  for  research.  However,  differences  in  relative
effect  are  likely  to  be  small,  especially  when  counselling  is  used
alongside  pharmacotherapy.  Small  trials  are  unlikely  to  provide
clear evidence of long-term efficacy.

Study design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial

Setting: 12 residential centres for alcohol/drug treatment, USA
Recruitment: inpatient volunteers

(50 participants in each of 12 sites)
67% men, av. age 33
50% smoked > 1 pack/day

Therapists: centre staff for 1st session, trained counsellors for telephone sessions

"Patients were randomized using a computer-generated list of odd and even

had been assigned." No mention that envelopes were opaque. Intensive inter-
vention participants more likely to be younger, male, heavier smokers, sug-

Interventions

Therapists: research nurses with 12 hours training

1. Control: modified usual care: smoking cessation booklet in hospital (not used in meta-analysis)
2. Brief advice (A): as control, plus labels in records to prompt advice from nurses and physicians
3. Brief advice and counselling (A+C): As 2, plus 1 bedside (or phone) session using motivational inter-
viewing and relapse prevention approaches and 3 to 6 calls (2 - 3 days, 1 wk, 2 - 3 wks, 1 m, 6 m)

Abstinence at 12 m (7-day PP)

women, av. age ˜46, av. cpd ˜20

Therapists: 'one of three staff interventionists trained and supervised by the study psychologist and
psychiatrist who had previous training in behavioral therapy'

All participants received 6 x 30-min individual CBT sessions at baseline, TQD, 1, 2, 4, 6 wks, and combi-
nation pharmacotherapy (Bupropion (300 mg, 9 wks) and NRT (21 mg patch, 8 wks incl tapering))

1. Extended therapy: 4 x 30-min sessions at 8, 12, 16, 20 wks, and weekly check in calls to automated
system; report of relapse or craving prompted proactive calls

2. Standard therapy: 5-min general support calls at 8, 12, 16, 20 wks

Outcomes

Abstinence at 52 wks (7-day abstinence at both 20 and 52 wks) (Continuous abstinence also reported
but not used in MA as could underestimate any effect on recycling)

Validation: CO < 10 ppm (11 self-reported quitters no longer living in study area accepted as quitters

Reason for exclusion

Alonso-Pérez 2007

Allocation to behavioural treatment was by clinic attended; each of 3 primary care clinics provided
different treatment. Differences between outcomes could have been due to differences between
patients in different clinics; no way to estimate effect of clustering

Outcomes

The smoking cessation (intervention) group will receive an intensive participant-centred smoking
cessation intervention offered by the caseworker over a minimum of 3 face-to-face visits (each 2
weeks apart) which will begin immediately following baseline survey completion, followed by at
least 2 phone contacts (1 week apart). This intervention will constitute an add-on to participants'
usual regular counselling visits, reducing additional costs to the Centre and to participants. If a par-
ticipant requires further contact, staff will provide further quitting assistance and record what they
delivered on their checklist.

The control group will receive minimum ethical care.

2 primary outcome measures obtained at 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up: 
1) 24-hour expired air CO-validated self-reported smoking cessation; and 
2) 7-day self-reported smoking cessation. 
Continuous abstinence will also be measured at 6- and 12-month follow-up
