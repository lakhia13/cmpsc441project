Abstract

Background: Attention problems and decreased quality of life are frequently accompanied in Cerebral Palsy (CP),
which can negatively affect rehabilitation of physical disability. However, the majority of affected children remain
untreated in the aspects of attention or psychosocial factors. Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies (EAAT) use
horse as a therapeutic modality including grooming as well as mounted riding activities in which patients exercise
and experience mounted stimulation. It is known to help improve attention in children with ADHD, so that it can
be an exercise therapy that is expected to improvement of attention as well as rehabilitating effects in CP patients.
EAA may be a promising strategy to address the unmet need for CP patients. This study aims to investigate the
efficacy of EAA for children with CP, those with both CP and ADHD and confirm the comorbidity between CP and
ADHD.
Methods: Forty-six children with cerebral palsy participated in this study. For the exercise group, they participated
in a 40-min session twice a week for a 16-week period, while the control group engaged in daily life without any
special treatments. Each children individually were assessed on attention and psychological wellbeing at baseline
and post-treatment. Comorbidity were identified based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder
5th edition (DSM-5) and confirmed by Korean Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present
and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL).

Results: Perseveration rated using the Conner’s Performance Test (CPT) showed a significant decrease only in the
exercise group (p < .024). However, no significant improvement in children’s quality of life was observed after EAA
program compared with control group. Among the total participants, fifteen children (31.91%) were diagnosed with
ADHD. When conducting an additional analysis with the subsample of CP patients diagnosed with ADHD, the d’,
commission error and perseveration showed a significant decrease only in the exercise group. Children with CP and
ADHD reported an improvement in quality of life both in exercise and control group, but only in the exercise
group social functioning exhibited a significant difference.

Conclusion: The positive effects of the EAA on attention and quality of life were confirmed. Children with CP in the
exercise group were more capable to sustain their attention longer. Those with CP and ADHD showed an increase
in attention and perceived to have better social skills after receiving 16 weeks of EAA compared to those in the
control group. Considering high comorbidity of CP and ADHD, it seems that the EAA program could be the better
alternative treatment for CP with attentional problem. The results of this study will contribute to growing evidence
for the efficacy of EAA in children especially with CP and ADHD.
Trial registration: This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03870893). Registered 26 July 2017.

Background
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurological disorders
resulting from damage to the developing brain. It repre-
sents a heterogeneous group of motor impairments [1],
and often accompanies sensory, cognitive, intelligence,
and communicative disabilities [2]. It is a severe child-
hood disorder associated with a very high disease bur-
den. Regardless of the type and severity of CP, 52% of all
patients suffer from mental illness [2]. Similarly, children
with CP exhibit 3- to 4-fold higher internalized and ex-
ternalized problems than the healthy population [3].
Among the neurodevelopmental disorders, Attention-
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
is known to
manifest the highest comorbidity in CP [2]. Out of 90
Israel pediatric patients diagnosed with CP aged 1.8 to
15.4 years, 22.5% met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD
[4]. Similarly, among 47 Norwegian children with CP, 24
were diagnosed with ADHD [5]. Nevertheless, ADHD
symptoms are disregarded in CP patients, leading to de-
layed intervention.

ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders diagnosed in the field of child psychiatry,
with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 3–10%
[6]. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
persistent and developmentally inappropriate inatten-
tiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity [7]. These symp-
toms lead to substantial dysfunction in the home, social
relationships and academics [8, 9]. Further, many chil-
dren with ADHD show motor disturbances [10] and
most of them display clumsy motor performance below
the norms for their age [11].

Various studies have demonstrated that executive
function of the cognitive domain in children with neuro-
developmental disorders are not fully developed during
childhood. As a result, those with CP and ADHD appear

to continuously experience difficulties in the academic
fields and life than children with CP but without ADHD.
To start with, both populations experience difficulties
with sustained attention. The reduced processing speed
and performance interferes with complex cognitive tasks
that require cognitive and logical skills [12]. In fact, chil-
dren with CP and ADHD exhibit slower processing
speed compared to healthy peers [13]. They show select-
ive attention deficits and impaired response and sup-
pression to stimuli irrelevant to the task [14], so when
the demands for information processing are high, they
tend to exhibit poor performance. Further, they both
perceive reduced levels of quality of life, with 75% of CP
children expressing pain regardless of their gross move-
ment and functional levels, which positively correlated
with decreased quality of life [15, 16]. Due to consistent
negative feedback under multiple settings [17], children
diagnosed with CP or ADHD experience withdrawal and
decreased quality of life.

therapeutic

As mentioned above, numerous studies have shown
that the presence of concurrent CP and ADHD leads to
the accumulation of negative experience, which may in-
crease the risk of secondary psychological ailments [13,
15, 16]. As these conditions can be treated during child-
hood, the importance of early intervention is empha-
sized. Various
including
approaches,
therapy or medication to treat
cognitive behavioral
ADHD were adopted to those with CP or ADHD to alle-
viate the symptoms but showed restricted effects, which
can be the limitation for these approaches on this par-
ticular population. Cognitive therapy reinforces the core
network of brain associated with attention via systematic
programs that improve cognitive functions, such as plan-
ning and information processing [4], even though a re-
reported that cognitive therapy

showed a significant improvement in visual and language
working memory, it had no effect on suppression and in-
attentiveness. For this reason, it is recommended more
as a supplementary treatment rather than a primary
treatment for attention training [18]. Additionally, the
fact that CP children are characterized by difficulties
with fine motor skills, the positive effect of cognitive
therapy that requires repetitive usage of computer pro-
grams may be minimal. Medication is one of the most
widely used treatments. In a placebo-controlled study,
patients with a dual diagnosis of CP and ADHD were
treated with medication or placebo to investigate the ef-
fect on attention, and the results demonstrated short-
term drug effect and minimal side effects, including loss
of appetite or stomach aches [19]. However, some par-
ents are cautious in administering medications to their
children. Therefore, an alternative intervention appears
to be necessary.

Recently, Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies
(EAAT) have received attention as it helps people suffer-
issues. Equine
ing from a variety of psychological
Assisted Activities and Therapies (EAAT) is a broad
term that encompasses two main interventions; Equine
Assisted Activities (EAA) and Equine Assisted Therapies
(EAT). EAA includes instructions in riding skills, how to
control the horse with verbal and nonverbal cues and
horsemanship skills [20]. This intervention tends to
emphasize activities that promoted social, cognitive,
physical, psychological and social skills [20]. Earlier stud-
ies have adopted EAA in various fields of treatment. It
inculcates a sense of self-efficacy in patients with psychi-
atric disabilities [21], and patients with stress or those
who express irritability are more likely to experience a
positive effect due to the physiologic response to the
rhythmic repetitive movements of the horse [9, 22].

Although the effectiveness of EAA on attention or psy-
chosocial functioning has been investigated [8, 9], stud-
ies have yet to evaluate the collective improvement in
symptoms. Thus, the primary objective of this study was
to investigate the effectiveness of EAA on attention in
children with CP and their perceived quality of
life.
Moreover, the secondary objective was to evaluate the
comorbidity between CP and ADHD and examine the
effectiveness of EAA for those who have both CP and
ADHD. We hypothesized that the EAA program would
improve attention deficit/impulsivity and enhance pa-
tients’ quality of life. Also, we expected that CP accounts
for some of the increased prevalence with ADHD.

Methods
Study participants
The study involved 47 CP outpatients aged 6 to 13 years
who visited the Department of Rehabilitation within a
university hospital located in Seoul from August 2017 to

January 2019. The psychiatric diagnoses were based on
the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual for Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) and confirmed
the comorbidity by Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disor-
ders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime Version
(K-SADS-PL). The exclusion criteria were: patients with
weight exceeding 35 kg, uncontrolled seizures; inability
to perform one-step instruction due to visual and hear-
ing impairment or intellectual disability; hip dislocation;
scoliosis greater than 30°;
less than 1-year history of
musculoskeletal
surgery; unrecovered fracture; botu-
linum toxin injection within 3 months; or riding that
was inappropriate for other medical conditions.

The participants were randomly assigned to the EAA
exercise group or the control group. The participants
were assigned with trial ID numbers, created by a re-
searcher not otherwise involved in the study. Prior to
the 16-week study program, both groups participated in
a pre-comprehensive assessment within 2 weeks, includ-
ing intelligence, attention and psychological evaluation
using Korean-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-
Fourth Edition (K-WISC-IV), Conner’s Continuous Per-
formance Test (CPT), Korean ADHD Rating Scale (K-
ARS) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQl),
which were used in previous studies to examine thera-
peutic effects on ADHD or CP children [9, 23]. 2-weeks
after the program was completed, the post-test assess-
ment, including attention and psychological evaluation
was performed. Those who were assigned to the control
group were given the opportunity to participate in the
EAA program after the trial. All participants were fully
informed about the study and signed the participant
agreement form. One participant from the control group
dropped out from the study before completion and the
data was excluded for analysis. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical
Center (2017–06-045).

Equine-assisted activities program (EAA)
Those included in the EAA exercise group participated
in a 40-min class twice a week over the course of 16
weeks (total of 32 sessions). A single instructor con-
ducted a group program for three children, and each
child was assisted by a horse leader and a side walker.
therapeutic riding in-
The instructor holds national
structor certification and previously had obtained Profes-
sional Association
of Therapeutic Horsemanship
(PATH) registered therapeutic riding instructor certifica-
tion. The sessions focused on mounted activities which
consisted of exercises to facilitate accurate posture, bal-
ance and practice basic riding skills. The control group
did not receive intervention and continued with their
usual daily activities.

Measurement tools
Korean-Wechsler intelligence scale for children-fourth
edition (K-WISC-IV)
K-WISC-IV is a standardized measurement tool to as-
sess intellectual function in children between ages 6 and
16 years and 11 months. The profile provides Full Scale
Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) for overall intellectual abil-
ities and a total of five composite scores for specific cog-
nitive
abilities. K-WISC-IV showed high internal
consistency and good test-retest correlation in previous
studies [24].

Conner’s continuous performance test 2rd edition
This visual vigilance computerized test was developed to
measure attention problems and has been widely used as
a supplementary diagnostic tool for ADHD. The partici-
pants are instructed to respond to the computer screen
by pressing the left button for every picture presented
except the soccer ball. Based on the response, d’ (the ac-
curacy in discriminating non-targets from targets), omis-
sion error (the number of times that the subject has
failed to respond to the target), commission error (the
number of times that the subject provided an incorrect
response to the non-target), preservation error (the
number of random responses, anticipatory response or a
repeated response without consideration of the task re-
quirements), mean response time (measured between
the presentation of the target stimulus and a correct re-
sponse), standard deviation of reaction time (variability
or consistency of attention), and standard deviation of
variable response time are calculated to determine index
scores of attention and impulsivity. In the current study,
all subjects underwent a 3- to 4-min practice session be-
fore starting the main evaluation. The test required a
total of 30 min and the examiner remained in the room
during the administration.

Korean ADHD rating scale (K-ARS)
The scale is used to assess ADHD symptoms in children.
The score is based on each 9 items that reflect inatten-
tiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity, with a total of 18
items. Higher scores indicate increased attention impair-
ment and impulse inhibition abilities. The Korean ver-
sion of ARS was validated with reasonable internal
consistency of 0.77–0.89 [25].

Pediatric quality of life inventory 4.0 genetic Core scale
The scale measures children’s general quality of life. It is
composed of 21 items based on 4 dimensions: physical,
emotional, social and academic aspects. Higher scores
indicate higher quality of life. In this study, scores for
each subscale were used to evaluate the treatment effect.

Kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia
present and lifetime version (K-SADS-PL)
K-SADS-PL was introduced by Kaufman and his colleges
(1997) to assess current and past episodes of psychiatric
disorders listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). This semi-structured
diagnostic instrument has been reported to be valid for
the screening and diagnosis of childhood and adolescent
disorders. The Korean Version of K-SADS-PL was trans-
lated and validated by Kim and his colleagues (2004)
who reported excellent reliability and validity. In the
present study, the tool was used to confirm the diagno-
ses of any existing psychiatric diagnosis.

Statistical analysis
The demographic data of 46 participants (age, sex, and
FSIQ) were compared via independent t-test. Repeated
measures of analysis of variance (repeated ANOVA)
were used to compare the overall improvement in atten-
tion and quality of life before and after treatment in the
exercise and control group. The secondary analysis for
intra-group comparison among subjects who were diag-
nosed with ADHD was based on t-test. A p-value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant and re-
sults were analyzed using SPSS ver. 24 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA).

Results
General characteristics of the participants
Twenty-three participants were assigned to the exercise
group (12 males, 11 females) and the control group (11
males, 12 females). The average age of participants in
the exercise and control group is 7.78 ± 1.68 years,
7.30 ± 1.61 years, respectively. The average FSIQ for the
exercise and control group is 79.91 ± 19.86, 79.70 ±
16.03, respectively. There was no group difference in

The effects on quality of life suggest that physical (p =

existed. The above results are presented in Table 3.

Effects of intervention on attention and quality of life in
the ADHD subsample
A secondary analysis was conducted with 15 CP children
who were diagnosed with ADHD. For attention, in the
exercise group the change of d’ (t = 2.713, p = <.05),
commission (t = 2.499, p = <.05), and perseveration score
(t = 2.361, p = <.05) showed a significant difference dur-
ing the 16-week program. Further, omission, hit reaction
time, and hit block change showed a gradual improve-
ment but was not statistically significant. In the control

report, the scores showed a decrease in both groups but
without any significance.

In the case of quality of life, in the exercise group the
change in social function (t = − 2.48, p = < .05) showed a
significant increase after the intervention. Although the
results were insignificant, the domains of physical and
emotional functioning showed an increase whereas aca-
demic performance decreased. In the control group,
physical, emotional, social
functioning, and academic
performance showed an increase, but was statistically in-
significant. The above results are presented in Table 4.

Discussion
Previous studies that applied EAA to children with CP
or ADHD evaluated the changes in CP and ADHD sep-
arately in attention, social problems, and motor function
but did not consider symptomatic improvements collect-
ively or the comorbidity of these disorders. Therefore,
the primary purpose of the current study was to evaluate
the therapeutic effect of 16-week EAA on attention and
psychosocial functioning in children with CP. The sec-
ondary purpose was to confirm the comorbidity between
CP and ADHD and examine the effectiveness of EAA
for those who have both CP and ADHD.

The effects of EAA program on attention and quality
of life in CP children are as follows. Participants in the
in
EAA exercise group showed an improvement

attention. Specifically, their ability to distinguish target
from non-target stimulus was enhanced, suggesting that
the ability for sustained attention and suppression of im-
pulse to unrelated stimulus was improved by the inter-
vention. Our
results are consistent with previously
studies reporting that sustained visual and auditory at-
tention increased post-computerized EAA in children
with ADHD [26]. These findings suggest that the efforts
to focus on the horse lead to improvements in sustained
attention. However, it is important to note the discrep-
ancy between the results of CPT and ARS based on the
physical conditions of CP children. CP children exhibit a
wide range of behavioral problems including physical ac-
tivity, neuromuscular dysfunction, and muscle weakness
[27], and events extending to the presence of epilepsy,
limited or defective walking ability and severe pain [28].
Due to these physical conditions, it is strongly likely that
the caregivers fail to notice the inattentiveness or hyper-
activity, as the ARS hyperactivity score was reported in
the low range.

A secondary analysis of a subsample of CP children
who were diagnosed with ADHD was performed. The
overall function of the ADHD group performing exercise
showed a greater improvement than the control group
with ADHD. More specifically, most of the indices of at-
tention showed an increase. The sub-domain of social
functioning in quality of life showed an increase. Con-
sistent with earlier studies, the social skills of disabled
children improved significantly after an eight-week EAA
program, whereas the control group revealed no signifi-
cant differences [29]. This result is meaningful because
among the sub-domains of quality of life, social func-
tioning is known to be associated with the most dysfunc-
tion in this particular population. Compared to healthy
peers, those with CP were correlated with low levels of
including absence of close friends,
social adaptation,
loneliness and experience of being bullied [2]. Similarly,
55.3% of 66 parents of children with CP reported peer
problems [29]. Further, children with CP have low social
engagement and relationships and are at an increased

risk of being bullied [30]. In a similar context, ADHD
children not only fail to have peer relationships due to
lack of patience and high levels of distractibility but also
disrupt others with unnecessary hyperactivity [31]. Fur-
thermore, since ADHD children show multiple problem-
atic behaviors, actions before considering others’ feelings
and lack of the ability to control their urge in social situ-
ations [32], they are at a higher risk of being rejected by
peers. In addition, those with ADHD symptoms do not
respond appropriately to social cues during interpersonal
interactions due to social
immaturity [31]. Altogether,
these negative experiences lead to difficulties in social
participation. Therefore, the benefit of EAA for psycho-
social improvement is greatly enhanced.

The broader symptomatic improvement in attentional
and psychosocial aspects of the CP and ADHD comor-
bidity groups may suggest that EAA is highly appropri-
ate for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. In
fact, in the current study 31.91% of CP patients were di-
agnosed with ADHD. It is essential to scrutinize the
ADHD symptoms of CP patients under clinical settings.
As the coexistence of the disease is increased, the poor
adaptability interferes with functional ability for activities
of daily life, underscoring the importance of early inter-
vention in these children.

The mechanism of EAA in improving attention and
social skills is uncertain, but there are several possible
explanations. One of the possible hypotheses is that dur-
ing the repetitive and rhythmic movements of the horse

in EAA, every participant begins to anticipate every
movement. This practice leads to modification and
reorganization of multiple systems in the brain including
the sensory, muscular and limbic systems [33], which
eventually enhance the inhibitory, cognitive, memory
and attention domains of function. Further, the thera-
peutic effect promotes self-regulation in which riding a
horse enables development of problem-solving skills in
children and a sense of control over their impulsivity by
mastering direction and speed [34]. A few studies have
demonstrated that the interactive experience with the
horses enhance the motivation to learn [35]. Moreover,
an earlier study has been published that EAA in ADHD
could modulate functional connectivity in the regions re-
lated to default mode network and behavioral inhibition
system relating with ADHD symptom improvement [9].
A positive effect on social maladaptation may occur
via interactions with the horses. The behavioral response
and social structure of horses is similar to that of
humans, which provides an opportunity to simulate rela-
tionships in a non-threatening environment [9, 36]. Also,
nonverbal communication and joint attention is pro-
moted by interaction with horses [23] encouraging chil-
dren to learn and control their emotions via rapport
with the horse. In fact, a previous meta-analysis of EAA
found a moderate effect in improving social skills [37].

The strength of this study is that unlike previous stud-
ies, an objective measurement tool of CPT was used to
evaluate attention levels. In most previous studies, the

assessment of psychological symptoms in early childhood
relied heavily on caregivers or teachers’ response obtained
through self-reports [38]. This approach may lead to lack
of symptom validation. As a result, the importance of la-
boratory or objective evaluation to measure sustained at-
tention and vigilance are being increasingly emphasized
[38]. Compared with other laboratory tools, CPT is a stan-
dardized and computerized tool, which is easily accessible,
norm-referenced and thus relatively inexpensive to de-
velop, and easy to score [39].

The limitations are as follows. First, although partici-
pants were randomly assigned to each group the baseline
CPT scores showed a significant difference. However,
after the EAA exercise group showed a radical increase
in attention improvement post-treatment compared to
the control group, it could be interpreted as therapeutic
effect. Second, this study was restricted to a small sam-
ple of outpatients in one particular hospital, and there-
fore the findings may not be generalized to other CP
patients. Additional studies with larger samples are
needed to replicate the findings and determine whether
the results can be generalized across CP outpatients.
Lastly, the current study did not examine the long-term
therapeutic effect, so maintenance of the effect was not
shown. Further studies that include a follow-up session
after a certain period a time seems meaningful.

Conclusion
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study examining the clinical effects of EAA using
the objective measurement in the group with both CP
and ADHD for improving attention and social skills. For
the CP population, the exercise group showed an en-
hanced attention, establishing the effectiveness of EAA.
Furthermore, it seems to be more effective when CP and
ADHD coexists, as both attention and social skills im-
proved. Lastly, our study confirmed a high comorbidity
of CP and ADHD. Based on these results, EAA can be
considered as a non-pharmacological option to treat at-
tentional problems for children with CP, and especially
those with both CP and ADHD. Further epidemiological
investigations in this area are certainly warranted for fur-
ther understanding.
