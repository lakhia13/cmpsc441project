Abstract

Antipsychotic treatment resistance affects up to a third of individuals with schizophrenia. Of
those affected, 70–84% are reported to be treatment resistant from the outset. This raises the
possibility that the neurobiological mechanisms of treatment resistance emerge before the
onset of psychosis and have a neurodevelopmental origin. Neuropsychological investigations
can offer important insights into the nature, origin and pathophysiology of treatment-resistant
schizophrenia (TRS), but methodological limitations in a still emergent field of research have
obscured the neuropsychological discriminability of TRS. We report on the first systematic
review and meta-analysis to investigate neuropsychological differences between TRS patients
and treatment-responsive controls across 17 published studies (1864 participants). Five meta-
analyses were performed in relation to (1) executive function, (2) general cognitive function,
(3) attention, working memory and processing speed, (4) verbal memory and learning, and
(5) visual−spatial memory and learning. Small-to-moderate effect sizes emerged for all
domains. Similarly to previous comparisons between unselected, drug-naïve and first-episode
schizophrenia samples v. healthy controls in the literature, the largest effect size was observed
in verbal memory and learning [dl = −0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.29 to −0.76;
z = 4.42; p < 0.001]. A sub-analysis of language-related functions, extracted from across the
primary domains, yielded a comparable effect size (dl = −0.53, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.23;
z = 3.45; p < 0.001). Manipulating our sampling strategy to include or exclude samples selected
for clozapine response did not affect the pattern of findings. Our findings are discussed in
relation to possible aetiological contributions to TRS.

Introduction

Up to a third of individuals with schizophrenia show resistance to antipsychotic treatment (Elkis
& Buckley, 2016; Lally, Gaughran, Timms, & Curran, 2016b; Mørup, Kymes, & Oudin Åström,
2020; Stokes et al., 2020), i.e. they do not respond adequately to two or more trials of anti-
psychotic medication, each lasting 4–6 weeks, at doses in at least the mid-point of the licensed
therapeutic range (NICE guidelines; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2014). In
comparison to treatment responsive patients, those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS)
tend to experience multiple symptomatic relapses, are exposed to higher doses of antipsychotic
medication, and show poor functional recovery (Chan et al., 2021; Iasevoli et al., 2016).

Evidence of glutamatergic rather than dopaminergic abnormalities in TRS (Demjaha et al.,
2014; Gillespie, Samanaite, Mill, Egerton, & MacCabe, 2017; Goldstein, Anderson, Pillai,
Kydd, & Russell, 2015; Mouchlianitis et al., 2016) raises the possibility that the disorder is cat-
egorically distinct from treatment-responsive schizophrenia (Gillespie et al., 2017). Running
counter to this possibility, clozapine surpasses other antipsychotics in improving total and
positive symptoms in both TRS and treatment-responsive patients (Mizuno, McCutcheon,
Brugger, & Howes, 2020), supporting arguments against an illness subtype that responds spe-
cifically to clozapine (Mizuno et al., 2020). A possibility that merits exploration is that TRS is
aetiologically continuous with treatment-responsive schizophrenia but occupies a more
extreme position in a continuum of neurodevelopmental impairment. In support of this
hypothesis, 70–84% of patients with treatment-resistant psychosis are reported to be resistant
from the first episode (Demjaha et al., 2017; Lally et al., 2016a). In addition, some of the stron-
gest predictors of poor therapeutic response in schizophrenia are the same as the defining fea-
tures of what has been termed ‘neurodevelopmental’ schizophrenia: male sex, younger age at
disease onset, poor premorbid adjustment, and longer duration of untreated illness (Carbon &
Correll, 2014; Murray, O’Callaghan, Castle, & Lewis, 1992).

Understanding the aetiological and neurobiological mechanisms of TRS is important for
developing personalised medicine, for ensuring early detection, and for initiating timely and

2

appropriate treatment. The gold standard treatment for TRS is
clozapine (Kane, Honigfeld, Singer, & Meltzer, 1988), with early
pharmacological intervention improving functional outcomes in
∼80% of those treated (John, Ko, & Dominic, 2018; Üçok et al.,
2015; Yoshimura, Yada, So, Takaki, & Yamada, 2017). In contrast,
a 3-year delay in commencing clozapine reduces response rates to
only ∼30% (Yoshimura et al., 2017). Notwithstanding this evi-
dence and treatment guidelines, antipsychotic polypharmacy
and high doses are commonly used prior to clozapine, which is
initiated with a mean delay of 4 years (Howes et al., 2012).

Neuropsychological investigations can offer important insights
into the nature, origin and pathophysiology of TRS. To date, a
number of studies have reported deficits in verbal intelligence
and memory, attention, working memory, visuospatial processing,
and sensorimotor
function in TRS patients compared to
treatment-responsive controls (Anderson, McIlwain, Kydd, &
Russell, 2015; Bourque et al. 2013; de Bartolomeis et al. 2013;
Frydecka, Beszłej, Gościmski, Kiejna, & Misiak, 2016; Huang
et al. 2020; Joober et al., 2002; Lin, Chan, Peng, & Chen, 2019).
However, inconsistent findings, as well as methodological vari-
ability and limitations in a largely emergent field of research
make it difficult to elaborate on the neuropsychological profile
of TRS and to discern its discriminability compared to schizo-
phrenia at large. The only neuropsychological investigation to
date to directly compare longitudinally characterised treatment-
resistant and treatment-responsive patients at their first episode
of psychosis found relative deficits in language functions in the
former group (Kravariti et al., 2018). As such functions are largely
the authors concluded that
reflective of premorbid ability,
treatment-resistant psychosis is likely to represent a severe variant
of psychosis, embedded in aberrant neurodevelopmental pro-
cesses (Kravariti et al., 2018).

We report on the first systematic review and meta-analysis to
investigate and quantify differences in neuropsychological perform-
ance between patients with TRS and those responsive to anti-
psychotic treatment. Based on previous findings, we predicted that
TRS patients would perform worse than treatment-responsive
patients, and that verbal functions would yield the largest effect sizes.

Methods

Search strategy

Records were accessed from PsycINFO (1806 to October Week 3
2020), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to October 22nd 2020) and
Web of Science on 24th October 2020. Search terms were selected
using a PICO framework. Search terms which were exploded in
MEDLINE and PsychINFO are indicated with ‘a’ in the description
below, with asterisks (*) indicating a wildcard search term. This
meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019147035).
The following search terms were used: (Treatment-resistant
schizophrenia OR TRS OR Treatment-refractory schizophrenia
OR Antipsychotic-resistant OR Antipsychotic-refractory) AND
(Cognit* OR Neuropsy* OR Executive function (a) OR Memory
(a) OR Intelligence (a) OR Attention (a) OR Awareness (a) OR
Learning (a). Additional publications (N = 3) were sourced from
Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and Web of Science through search-
ing ‘Treatment-resistance.’ Figure 1 provides a summary of the lit-
erature search strategy, using the PRISMA Group’s guidelines for
systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Liberati et al., 2009; Moher,
Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & Group, 2009). The PRISMA checklist
is presented in online Supplementary Table S1.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis,
if they:

1. Reported neuropsychological findings from individuals with
treatment-resistant, and controls with treatment-responsive,
schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

2. Defined schizophrenia-spectrum disorders according to the
diagnostic criteria of
the International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
(online
Mental Disorders
Supplementary Table S2).

classification systems

(DSM)

3. Adopted one of two definitions of treatment resistance: i. not
responding adequately to antipsychotic treatment, despite the
use of two or more different antipsychotics, each lasting 4–6
weeks, at doses in at least the mid-point of the licensed thera-
peutic range (NICE guidelines; National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence, 2014), or ii. Currently treated with cloza-
pine (online Supplementary Table S2).

With the exception of two studies (Anderson et al., 2015; Lin
et al., 2019), all publications which met inclusion criteria com-
prised participants unselected for clozapine response. Anderson
et al. (2015) and Lin et al. (2019) included discrete subgroups
of clozapine-responsive and clozapine-resistant (termed ultra-
resistant) subgroups. To address the theoretical risk of inflated
(ultra-resistant) or deflated (clozapine-responsive) effect sizes of
cognitive deficits compared to unselected TRS samples, we
adopted the conservative strategy of excluding the two ultra-
treatment resistant subgroups from our main analyses. This
approach maximised the analytic sample (the clozapine-respon-
sive subgroups from both studies were retained in the main ana-
lysis), whilst cautiously biasing effect sizes towards conservative
rather than inflated estimates (by excluding ultra-resistant sam-
ples). To examine if manipulating our sampling strategy would
have any impact on our findings, the analysis was performed
before (main analysis) and after (sensitivity analysis) (a) excluding
clozapine-responsive samples (Anderson et al., 2015; Lin et al.,
2019); (b) adding clozapine-resistant samples (Anderson et al.,
2015; Lin et al., 2019).

As shown in Fig. 1, reviews, opinions, proceeding papers,
meeting abstracts, letters, proof of concept studies, and case stud-
ies were not included in the study. Of published studies with over-
lapping participant samples,
the largest study, or the one
reporting on the largest set of neuropsychological findings, was
included. This approach resulted in the exclusion of three publi-
cations (de Bartolomeis et al., 2018; Iasevoli et al., 2017, 2018b).
In cases of partial reporting on essential findings (e.g. means
and standard deviations of composite scores rather than individ-
ual variables), two attempts were made to obtain data from corre-
sponding authors before excluding the paper. Data were received
for four studies (Kravariti et al., 2018; Lawrie et al., 1995; Legge
et al., 2019; Vanes, Mouchlianitis, Collier, Averbeck, & Shergill,
2018a).

Data extraction

For our main analysis (see below), 41 cognitive tasks were
grouped into five primary cognitive domains by E.M. & E.K.
based on each task’s underpinning theoretical construct and earl-
ier groupings in the literature (Fatouros-Bergman, Cervenka,

Psychological Medicine

Flyckt, Edman, & Farde, 2014; Fett, Viechtbauer, Penn, van Os, &
Krabbendam, 2011; Fioravanti, Carlone, Vitale, Cinti, & Clare,
2005): (1) executive function, (2) general cognitive function, (3)
attention, working memory and processing speed, (4) verbal
memory and learning, and (5) visual−spatial memory and learn-
ing (Table 1). Three of the 41 tasks (National Adult Reading Test,
Phonological Verbal Fluency, Semantic Verbal Fluency) were also
included in our sub-analysis of language-related functions (see
below); the latter further included Vocabulary (which did not fea-
ture in the main analysis) (Table 1). The following information
was extracted from each publication by two independent investi-
gators (E.M. & O.H.): author names, publication year, diagnostic
criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the definition of
TRS, and, for each of the TRS and treatment-responsive groups,
number of cases, mean age, number of males, mean age of illness
onset, mean duration of illness, mean chlorpromazine equiva-
lents, mean years of education, mean positive and negative symp-
tom scale scores, as well as means and standard deviations of
cognitive tasks (online Supplementary Table S4).

Quality assessments for each publication were made using
the Quality Assessment Tool
for Observational Cohort and
Cross-Sectional Studies and Quality Assessment of Controlled
Intervention Studies tools from the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute (NIH, 2014a). Each publication was independently
rated by E.M and O.H, providing a ‘yes’, ‘no,’ ‘not applicable,’ ‘can-
not determine,’ or ‘not reported’ response to each of fourteen state-
ments. An overall quality rating (good, fair or poor) was derived
based on these responses (online Supplementary Table S3).

Main analysis: Meta-analysis of five primary cognitive domains

Data were analysed in relation to five cognitive domains using
the metan (Harris et al., 2008), metaan (Kontopantelis &
Reeves, 2010), metabias (Harbord, Harris, Sterne, & Steichen,
2009) and metafunnel (Sterne, 2003) commands in STATA/SE
Version 15. The metaan command runs meta-analyses off the
saved estimates from metan using a restricted maximum likeli-
hood model (REML) and providing I2 and Cochrane Q estimates
for heterogeneity. The REML method reduces the likelihood of
both positive and negative biases and has been recommended
over eight other methods in a recent comparison of nine different
heterogeneity variance estimators using simulated meta-analysis
data (Langan et al., 2019). Z statistics, p values and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) were estimated for the effect sizes following
Altman & Bland’s (2011) recommendations. Where two or more
tasks from the same study contributed to the same cognitive
domain, estimates from the metan command were used to create
a within-study weighted average prior to metaan. This step was
undertaken to preserve the independence of participant samples
within each cognitive domain. Findings of significant heterogen-
eity in any cognitive domain were followed by meta-regressions
using the metareg command (Harbord & Higgins, 2008) to exam-
ine potential demographic (age, sex, and years of education), clin-
ical (duration of illness, age at illness onset, positive and negative
symptom ratings) and medication (chlorpromazine equivalents)
sources of heterogeneity. Differences between groups in these
variables were included as individual predictors in the meta-
regression models.

aExtracted from the ‘General cognitive domain’ of the main analysis; bextracted from the ‘Executive function’ domain of the main analysis; cwas not included in the main analysis.
1The main analysis included all treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) samples across publications, except for the clozapine-resistant samples in Anderson et al., 2015 and Lin et al., 2019.
Both clozapine-resistant samples were added to the main analytic sample as part of our sensitivity analysis (see online Supplementary Fig. S3).
2The sub-analysis focused selectively on language-related functions that were extracted from across the primary cognitive domains of the main analysis, in addition to Wechsler Vocabulary;
the latter task was only included in the sub-analysis and did not feature in the main analysis.

Sub-analysis: Meta-analysis of language-related functions
from across primary cognitive domains

Earlier findings from our research group (Kravariti et al., 2018)
suggested that patients with a first episode of psychosis, who
were later found to be treatment resistant, were impaired in verbal
intelligence and fluency, but in no other composite scores, relative
to their treatment-responsive counterparts. To examine the sali-
ence of
language-related functions in the neuropsychological
profile of TRS, in a second step, we selectively extracted tasks
with a prominent language processing component from across
the five primary cognitive domains (General cognitive function:
National Adult Reading Test; Executive function: Phonological
Verbal Fluency; Semantic Verbal Fluency),
further adding
Wechsler Vocabulary (which did not feature in the main analysis)
to conduct a separate, language-focused meta-analysis (Table 1).

Sensitivity analysis: Clozapine response

sub-types of

Forty to 70% of TRS patients respond partially or poorly even
to clozapine (Farooq, Choudry, Cohen, Naeem, & Ayub, 2019;
Potkin et al., 2020; Siskind, Siskind, & Kisely, 2017) and are
termed ultra-resistant. For the latter group, non-pharmacological
augmentation strategies, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) are shown to
hold considerable promise (Lindenmayer et al., 2019; Moulier,
Krir, Dalmont, Guillin, & Rothärmel, 2021). These critical differ-
ences in treatment response have been proposed to correspond to
three
antipsychotic-responsive,
clozapine-responsive and clozapine-resistant (Farooq et al., 2019).
A direct comparison of neuropsychological performance across
the three subtypes would critically enhance the resolution and
impact of our analysis. However, all but two studies (Anderson
et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2019) included participants unselected
for clozapine response, preventing such comparison. We instead
examined the sensitivity of our analysis to (a) excluding the
clozapine-responsive subgroups of both studies
(these were
included in the main analysis for the reasons outlined in
‘Inclusion/exclusion criteria’); (b) adding the ultra-treatment resist-
ant subgroups from both studies. To approximate the predominant

schizophrenia:

(undifferentiated) sampling strategy in the literature (and to pre-
serve sample independence), the latter addition was performed
by averaging the cognitive scores across the clozapine-responsive
and the clozapine-resistant subgroups from each study (rather
than including two discrete TRS samples from each study).

Results

Study characteristics

A total of 17 studies (16 observational, one experimental) made
up our analytic sample (Fig. 1, Table 2). Table 1 lists the cognitive
tasks employed across publications in relation to each of the five
primary cognitive domains (main analysis) and in relation to the
language-related functions (sub-analysis). The descriptive charac-
teristics of the study samples are presented in Table 2. The 17
publications contributed 1864 participants (939 TRS) and 77 dis-
crete comparisons in cognitive performance between TRS and
treatment-responsive participants to the main analysis (online
Supplementary Table S4), and 1129 participants (584 TRS) and
10 discrete comparisons in cognitive performance between TRS
and treatment-responsive participants to the language sub-
analysis (online Supplementary Table S4). The sensitivity analy-
ses included 1678–1933 participants (857–994 TRS) (online
Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). Only baseline / pre-intervention
data were included from the experimental study by Rakitzi and
Georgila, 2019.

The specific list and number of publications that contributed
analytic data (i.e. discrete comparisons in cognitive performance
to the
between treatment-responsive and TRS participants)
main analysis and sub-analysis is listed in online Supplementary
Table S4, and included 10 publications (24 comparisons) for
executive function, nine publications (12 comparisons) for gen-
eral cognitive function, 10 publications (24 comparisons) for
attention, working memory and processing speed, eight publica-
tions (12 comparisons) for verbal memory and learning and
five publications (five comparisons) for visual−spatial memory
and learning (online Supplementary Table S4). Six publications
contributed analytic data (10 comparisons) to the sub-analysis
of language-related functions (online Supplementary Table S4).

Main analysis: Meta-analysis of five primary cognitive domains

Table 3 illustrates the REML findings and heterogeneity estimates
for the main analysis (five primary cognitive domains) and the
sub-analysis (language-related functions). TRS patients scored
lower than treatment-responsive patients, with effect sizes ranging
from small to moderate (based on Cohen’s thresholds: 0.2 = small,
0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large; Cohen, 1988). Effect sizes were statistic-
ally significantly different from 0, except for executive function
and visual−spatial memory and learning (Table 3). The largest
effect size (moderate) emerged for verbal memory and learning
(dl = −0.53). The remaining cognitive domains gave rise to
small effects (dl = −0.27 to −0.38) (Table 3).

Figure 2 shows the forest plots for the five primary meta-
analyses. Negative effect sizes (left) indicate worse cognitive per-
formance in treatment-resistant cases. The diamond line shows
the overall effect size for each meta-analysis.

Heterogeneity
Cochrane’s Q statistic was significant for ‘Executive function’,
indicating some degree of heterogeneity (Table 3). Using the I2
statistic, there was no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) for
‘Attention, working memory and processing speed’ and ‘Visual
−spatial memory’, and small heterogeneity (I2 = 17.59%) for
‘General cognitive function’ (Table 3). However, there was mod-
erate heterogeneity (defined as
for
‘Executive
and learning’
function’
(Table 3). Meta-regressions showed no significant effects of
demographic, clinical and medication variables on the overall
effect sizes of ‘Executive function’ and ‘Verbal memory and learn-
ing’ (online Supplementary Table S5).

‘30–60%’; Ryan, 2016)

and ‘Verbal memory

Publication bias

To assess the potential of publication bias, a funnel plot for all
datapoints across cognitive domains was generated and examined
using visual inspection and Egger’s test (Egger, Smith, Schneider,
& Minder, 1997). The latter can help detect bias with a smaller
number of publications (Egger et al., 1997). The funnel plot was
symmetrical (Fig. 3) and the Egger’s test indicated no presence
of publication bias (t(10) = −1.80, p = 0.109).

Quality of studies
All publications received ‘good’ (N = 12) or ‘fair’ (N = 5) ratings
following quality assessments (online Supplementary Table S3),
indicating no bias due to flaws in study design or implementation,
or some bias, but not sufficient to invalidate the study results
(NIH, 2014b).

Sub-analysis: Meta-analysis of language-related functions
from across primary cognitive domains

Table 3 illustrates the REML findings and heterogeneity estimates
for the main analysis (five primary cognitive domains) and sub-
analysis (language-related functions). The forest plot of the sub-
analysis is further presented in online Supplementary Fig. S1.
The meta-analysis of language-related functions gave rise to a
moderate effect size, closely comparable to the effect size for ver-
bal memory and learning (dl = −0.53, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.23;
z = 3.45; p < 0.001) (Table 3, online Supplementary Fig. S1). The

compared to those with treatment-responsive schizophrenia,
which are most salient in verbal functions. Manipulating our sam-
pling strategy to include or exclude samples selected for clozapine
response did not affect the main pattern of findings.

Sensitivity analysis: Clozapine response

Online Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 present the results of the
meta-analyses for the five cognitive domains after excluding the
clozapine-responsive TRS samples from Anderson et al. (2015)
and Lin et al. (2019) (online Supplementary Fig. S2) and after
adding the clozapine-resistant TRS samples from both studies
(Anderson et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2019) (online Supplementary
Fig. S3). Manipulating the sampling strategy in this way did not
alter the pattern of findings from that reported for the main ana-
lysis (online Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).

Discussion

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare
neuropsychological performance between treatment-resistant
(n = 925) and treatment-responsive (n = 939) patients with pre-
dominantly chronic schizophrenia across eligible published stud-
ies (n = 17). Meta-analyses were performed in relation to five
cognitive domains, including executive function, general cognitive
function, attention, working memory and processing speed, verbal
memory and learning, and visual−spatial memory and learning.
As part of a focused sub-analysis, we further meta-analysed
findings in relation to variables with a prominent language pro-
cessing component from across the primary cognitive domains.
We finally performed separate sensitivity analyses to examine
the effect of clozapine response on the main findings.

Confirming our hypotheses, all meta-analyses generated small
to moderate effect sizes, which were statistically significant for all
but two domains (executive function; visual−spatial memory and
learning) and most pronounced for verbal memory and learning
and language-related functions. These results suggest that chronic
patients with TRS show wide-ranging neuropsychological deficits

Salience of verbal memory deficits in TRS

Verbal memory and learning consistently show the largest effect
sizes in meta-analyses of neuropsychological deficits in first-epi-
sode (Mesholam-Gately, Giuliano, Goff, Faraone, & Seidman,
2009), drug-naïve (Fatouros-Bergman et al., 2014) and chronic
(Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998) schizophrenia patients compared
to healthy controls. The impairment is not secondary to IQ def-
icits (Kravariti et al., 2009) and is also seen in an attenuated form
in unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients (Bora,
Akdede, & Alptekin, 2017; Snitz, MacDonald, & Carter, 2006).
This empirical research suggests that verbal memory impairment
is an endophenotype for schizophrenia (McCarthy et al., 2018)
and taps into core pathophysiological processes in the disorder
(Kravariti et al., 2009).

Confirming our hypothesis and extending earlier findings
(Fatouros-Bergman et al., 2014; Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998;
Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009), verbal memory and learning
emerged as one of two cognitive aspects best discriminating
between treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive patients
in the present meta-analysis.

Salience of language function deficits in TRS

Language functions have been reported to distinguish between
TRS patients and treatment-responsive controls already at the
first episode (Kravariti et al., 2018). Our
sub-analysis of
language-related functions gave rise to an effect size comparable
to that detected for verbal memory and learning in the main ana-
lysis. Early emergence of language-related deficits in TRS patients
compared to treatment responders might reflect a greater contri-
bution of neurodevelopmental impairment in the former group.

et al., 2009;
Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009). For example, language functions
were only the fifth most impaired domain in a meta-analysis of
neuropsychological deficits in first-episode schizophrenia patients
compared to healthy controls (Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009),
while premorbid verbal and non-verbal intelligence are equally
(Khandaker, Barnett,
impaired in population-based studies
White, & Jones, 2011). A differential salience of language function
deficits in the comparative neuropsychological profiles of TRS
individuals and of schizophrenia patients at large might be under-
pinned by a qualitative neuropsychological difference between
treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive schizophrenia. If
confirmed, such distinction will be of great theoretical and prac-
tical interest, for example, in developing aetiological models and
personalised medicine in TRS.

Origins of neuropsychological deficits in TRS
The effect sizes that emerged in our meta-analyses (0.27–0.53) are
of similar magnitude to those reported in meta-analyses of neuro-
psychological findings from unaffected first-degree relatives of
schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls (0.20–0.66)
(Bora et al., 2017; Snitz et al., 2006). Combined, the above find-
ings raise the possibility of a genetic and cognitive continuum
of schizophrenia risk, which increases from undiagnosed commu-
nity controls to unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia
patients to treatment-responsive schizophrenia patients to TRS
patients.

A broader hypothesis is that TRS is aetiologically continuous
with treatment-responsive schizophrenia but occupies a more
extreme position in a continuum of neurodevelopmental liability.
This hypothesis is in keeping with findings relating to predictors
of poor therapeutic response, which largely coincide with the
defining features of neurodevelopmental schizophrenia (Carbon
& Correll, 2014; Murray et al., 1992).

The dearth of neuropsychological investigations into the first
psychotic episode of patients who develop TRS limits inferences
on the origin and stability of the neuropsychological gradient
between TRS and treatment-responsive schizophrenia. Based on
limited findings to date, this differential is likely to predate clinical
onset in relation to language functions (Kravariti et al., 2018).

Methodological considerations

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of neuro-
psychological deficits in treatment-resistant, relative to treat-
ment-responsive, schizophrenia. The originality of our research
undertaking, our systematic methodological approach, and the
fair/good quality of the original studies are strengths of the pre-
sent investigation.

Integrated with earlier research, our findings offer new insights
into possible aetiological contributions to TRS, but they need to
be viewed in the light of some limitations: Even though the largest
effects sizes for verbal memory and learning and for language-
related functions were moderate, thus distinguishable from the
remaining (small) effect sizes, there was substantial overlap in
95% CIs. This might suggest that the true mean differences
between the schizophrenia populations of interest might be less
pronounced than our estimates suggest. Our conservative sam-
pling and analytic strategies (biasing estimates towards conserva-
tive rather than inflated estimates) are likely to have mitigated this
risk.

Our heterogeneity analyses suggested moderate-to-substantial
inconsistency of effect sizes for executive function, verbal memory
and learning, and language-related functions. This inconsistency
was statistically addressed by employing random-effects models
(Langan et al., 2019; Tanriver-Ayder, Faes, van de Casteele,
McCann, & Macleod, 2021; Veroniki et al., 2019), and, where
(Ryan, 2016).
appropriate, by performing meta-regressions
However, the relatively small number of studies (n = 5–10) pre-
vented subgroup analyses and is likely to also explain the lack
of statistically significant findings in our meta-regressions.

Traditional conceptualisations of verbal fluency (VF) see VF as
primarily an ‘executive function’
in the literature (Henry &
Crawford, 2005; Joyce, Collinson, & Crichton, 1996). However,
more recent factor-analytic evidence suggests that both letter
(phonemic) and category (semantic) fluency are more closely
related to language than to executive function (Whiteside et al.,
2016). We addressed this duality by classifying verbal fluency as
an executive
a
function in our main analysis
language-related function in our sub-analysis.

and as

Most neuropsychological studies of TRS to date have been
cross-sectional and included chronic patient samples, which has
limited the scope of the present meta-analysis. In the absence of
first-episode studies and longitudinal designs, it is difficult to dis-
tinguish between neuropsychological deficits that tap into the core
pathophysiology of TRS from those secondary to the combined
effects of chronicity and persistent poor regulation of clinical
symptoms.

A noteworthy limitation of our meta-analysis is the scarcity of
publications that differentiated between clozapine-responsive and
clozapine-resistant TRS subgroups. The dearth of relevant studies
prevented us from addressing the critical importance of clozapine
response (Farooq et al., 2019; Lindenmayer et al., 2019; Moulier
et al., 2021; Potkin et al., 2020; Siskind et al., 2017) in subgroup
analyses. Although our sensitivity analysis produced nearly iden-
tical results to those of the main analysis, this is a likely reflection
of the small number of studies underpinning it.

Conclusions and future directions

Patients with TRS show wide-ranging deficits of small to moder-
ate effect sizes compared to treatment responders, which are most
salient in verbal memory and learning and in language functions.
The latter is of particular interest to theoretical and research
explorations of treatment resistance, as they are likely markers
of neurodevelopmental vulnerability to TRS.

A hypothesis that merits exploration in future research is that
core deficits in language functions, a neurodevelopmental aeti-
ology, and a primary glutamatergic dysfunction converge into a
single model of TRS. In support of a model which helps to bridge
glutamate and neurodevelopmental hypotheses of TRS, glutamate
is associated with schizophrenia in genetic association analyses
(Spangaro et al., 2012), with verbal fluency deficits in high-risk
individuals (Allen et al., 2015) and, critically, with several
language-related neurodevelopmental processes (Lebel, MacMaster,
& Dewey, 2016; Takenouchi et al., 2014).

Future studies should employ longitudinal controlled designs
extending from the high-risk to the first episode and onto the
chronic stages of TRS, as well as undertake incisive comparisons
across treatment-responsive, clozapine-responsive and clozapine-
resistant subgroups of schizophrenia patients. Digit Symbol
would be an interesting focus of future meta-analyses in TRS.

significant impairment, which exceeds that of other traditional
neuropsychological tasks (Dickinson, Ramsey, & Gold, 2007).
The ultimate goal of the neuropsychological characterisation of
TRS is to help advance the translational scope of research into
TRS, particularly in relation to personalised medicine. Recent
findings have stirred optimism in this direction. For example, a
reported significant alteration in cognitive flexibility in TRS is
believed to tap into a distinct underlying neurobiological mechan-
ism and may inform future treatment strategies (e.g. glutamatergic
targets and giving clozapine earlier in resistant patients) (Horne
et al., 2021). Our findings suggest that language-related tasks,
and potentially verbal memory and learning tasks, have likely
applications in multidisciplinary strategies to elucidating the
pathophysiology of TRS and to developing predictive models
and personalised medical approaches.
