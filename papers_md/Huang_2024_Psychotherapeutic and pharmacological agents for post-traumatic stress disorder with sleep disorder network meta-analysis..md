ABSTRACT
Objective: the current guidelines and canonical norms of diagnosis or treatment for Post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  (PtsD)  with  sleep  disorder  are  still  conflicting  and  have  not  yet  reached  a 
consensus.  this  study  aimed  to  unravel  the  most  effective  countermeasures  between  two 
categories  (psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy)  put  forward  by  the  National  institute  for  health 
and  clinical  excellence  (Nice)  and  World  Federation  of  societies  of  Biological  Psychiatry  (WFsBP) 
respectively  to  treat  PtsD  individuals  co-exist  with  sleep  disorders.
Methods:  Four  databases,  including  PubMed,  eMBase,  cochrane  library,  and  aPa  PsyNet,  were 
searched  from  inception  to  February  02,  2023.
Results:  twenty  articles  with  24  Randomized  controlled  trials  (Rcts)  and  a  total  number  of  1,647 
participants  were  included.  as  demonstrated  in  the  network  meta-analysis  comparison  results, 
cBt-i  (standardized  mean  differences  (sMD)  = –1.51,95%  confidence  interval  (ci):–2.55  to  −0.47), 
cBt-i  plus  iRt  (sMD = –1.71,  95%ci:–3.39,  −0.03),  prazosin  (sMD = –0.87,95%ci:–1.59  to  −0.16)  and 
hydroxyzine  (sMD = –1.06,  95%ci:  −1.94  to  −0.19)  significantly  reduced  PtsD  symptoms  compared 
with  placebo. 
in  contrast  to  placebo,  cBt-i  (sMD = –5.61,95%ci:-8.82  to  –2.40)  significantly 
improved  sleep  quality.  For  nightmare  severity,  iRt  (sMD =–0.65,  95%ci:-1.00  to  −0.31),  prazosin 
(sMD = –1.20,95%ci:–1.72 to −0.67) and hydroxyzine (sMD = –0.98,95%ci:-1.58 to −0.37) significantly 
reduced  nightmare  severity  in  comparison  with  placebo.
Conclusions:  this  study  suggested  that  under  most  circumstances,  psychotherapy  namely  cBt-i 
had  a  favorable  profile,  but  pharmacotherapy  with  prazosin  was  effective  in  managing  nightmare 
severity.  the  sole  avail  of  cBt-i  was  recommended  to  improving  sleep  quality  while  cBt-i  and 
cBt-i  plus  iRt  showed  excellent  management  of  PtsD  symptom  severity.  exposure  to  cBt-i 
isrecommended  for  depression. the  relevant  clinical  guidelines  for  the  management  of  individuals 
with  PtsD  and  sleep  disorders  may  regard  this  as  a  reference.

1.  Introduction

Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PtsD)  is  a  mental  health 
statue  that  arises  from  traumatic  events  featuring  by 
intrusive  memories  of  the  incident,  difficulty  in  inter-
personal  relationships,  recurrent  distress,  avoidance  of 
similar  situations  and  flashbacks  [1].  Diagnostic  and 
(DsM-5)  diagnosis  PtsD  by 
statistical  Manual-5 

checking  whether  the  client  expose  to  one  or  more 
traumatic  event(s),  which 
is  defined  as  one  that 
involved  death  or  threatened  death,  actual  or  threat-
ened  serious  injury,  or  actual  or  threatened  sexual  vio-
lence  [2].  Besides,  PtsD  is  regarded  as  a  multifaceted 
diagnosis  that  impacts  multiple  domains  of  function-
ing, 
including  depression.  typically,  the  clinician- 
administered  PtsD  scale  (caPs),  DsM  scale,  PtsD

symptom  scale  (Pss)  and  self-report  PtsD  checklist 
(Pcl)  areemployed  as  diagnostic  criteria 
in  clinical 
practice  [3,4].  Meanwhile,  sleep  disorder  is  regarded  as 
a  primary  complaint  of  a  massive  number  of  PtsD 
patients.  sleep  disorder  are  conditions  that  result  in 
changes  in  the  way  that  you  sleep.  however,  it  can  be 
qualitative  and  quantitative  analyzed  by  sleep  quality, 
nightmare  severity,  depression  and  total  sleep  time  [5]. 
it  can  be  concluded  from  recent  studies  that  there 
exists  great  potential  correlation  between  PtsD  and 
sleep  disorders.  a  research  paper  published  in  2019 
revealed  that  2647  PtsD  patients  diagnosed  by  the 
DsM-5  criteria  was  reported  92%  who  underwent  at 
least  one  sleep  disturbance  that  affects  sleep  quality 
[6].  and  another  proved  causality  between  PtsD  and 
sleep  disorder  that  once  PtsD  resolved  sleep  disorder 
subsided  [7,8].  ahmadi  one  of  the  lead  authors  previ-
ously  mentioned  endorse  that  insomnia  (one  of  the 
sleep  disorders)  occurs  63%  (95%ci:  45%~78%) 
in 
PtsD  patients,  also  in  the  same  way  they  suggest  that 
check-up  is  required  in  managing  insomnia  with  PtsD 
[7]. it’s lamenting that those who have PtsD co-existing 
with  sleep  disorders  will  suffer  a  lot.  as  the  symptoms 
limit  the  patients’  capability  to  refresh 
from  the 
botched  symptom  they  originally  have  and  the  daily 
errands  they  encounter,  this  is  a  vicious  cycle  where 
inadequate  sleep  time  impair  the  initially  abnormal 
physio-logical  balance  of  the  organism,  which  may  fur-
ther  increase  the  severity  of  PtsD  [9].

Psychotherapeutic  and  pharmacological  treatment 
regime  are  designated  as  the  main  countermeasures 
to  tackle  with  the  symptoms  of  PtsD  [10].  as  the 
evaluation  of  diagnostic  criteria  is  mostly  depending 
on  mental  illness  [3,11],  psychotherapeutic  counter-
measures  are  recommended  for  priority  use  accord-
ing  to  the  World  Federation  of  societies  of  Biological 
Psychiatry  (WFsBP)  guideline  [12].  Former  study  iden-
tified  that  neurobiological  mechanism  regulate  the 
relationship  between  sleep  disorders  and  PtsD  symp-
toms  and  it  was  downstream  effect  in  this  regulation 
system  [13,14],  as  it  can  be  seen  that  sleep  is  essen-
tial  for  healthy  emotional  regulation  processes.  as 
such,  psychotherapy  should  be  considered  for  PtsD 
patients  with  sleep  disorders.  Best  intervention  for 
PtsD  patients  with  sleep  disorders  is  cognitive  behav-
ioral  therapy  (cBt)  that  is  recommended  by  National 
institute  for  health  and  clinical  excellence  (Nice) 
listed  as 
include  various 
guideline,  which 
(cBt-i), 
for 
cognitive-behavioral  therapy 
cognitive  processing  therapy  (cPt),  exposure  therapy 
(et),  narrative  exposure  therapy  (Net)  among  them 
et  is  a  special  countermeasure  in  treating  the  disease 
that  it  introduces  individuals  to  increasing  levels  of 

forms 
insomnia 

the  stress-related  stimulus.  they  will  begin  to  learn 
how  to  cope  with  these  until  their  anxiety  levels 
lower  and,  ideally,  become  non-existent  when  con-
fronted  with  the  stimuli  [15,16].  While,  the  guideline 
also  notes  that  the  efficacy  of  how  long  it  can  be 
maintained  remains 
largely  dim  [15].  in  terms  of 
pharmacotherapy,  the  best  treatment  for  nightmares 
is  prazosin  as  WFsBP  referred  [12].  Prazosin 
is  a 
quinazoline  derivative  that  acts  as  a  competitive 
alpha1-antagonist,  not  only  can  it  treat  PtsD  with 
nightmares  but  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia,  hyper-
tension  as  well  [17].  Meanwhile,  prazosin  may  be  a 
promising  agent  for  the  PtsD  treatment  regime  [18]. 
From  the  perspective  of  specificity,  patients  suffer 
from  PtsD  co-exist  with  sleep  disorders  are  recom-
mended  in  the  combination  therapy  in  which  selec-
tive 
and 
psychotherapy  was  recommended  [10].  sleep  quality, 
nightmare  severity  and  total  sleep  time  (tst)  are 
included 
therapeutic 
the 
effects.  Nonetheless,  substantial  evidence  was  putting 
forward  in  accordance  with  the  long  been  known 
guidelines  [10,12,15],  the  information  to  ensure  the 
uniform  standard  of  treatment  for  patients  with  PtsD 
and  sleep  disorders  was  scarce.  consequently,  sub-
jects  with  PtsD  and  sleep  disorders  are  specific  pop-
ulations  to  whom  more  attention  should  be  paid.

in  this  research  detailed  treatments  (cBt-i,  cPt,  et, 
Net)  isn’t  mentioned  into  consideration,  and,  such  an 
analysis  is  beyond  the  scope  of  our  paper,  which  aims 
only  to  unveil  that  the  certain  population  (people  with 
PtsD)  suffered  specific  symptom  (sleep  disorder)  that 
which  regime  (psycho-  or  pharmaco-)  is  better  in  alle-
viating  symptoms  disease  had  caused.  Furthermore, 
the  study  focused  on  the  primary  leading  factor  (PtsD) 
of  the  disease,  and  from  the  primary  leading  factor, 
explores  the  impact  of  treatment  decisions  on  specific 
symptoms  (sleep  disorder).  the  research  gap  whether 
the  different  forms  of  treatment  on  earth  were  more 
beneficial  still  need  joint  effort  to  make  it  come  out  in 
the  wash.  thus,  to  summarize  the  extant  knowledge 
base  and  guide  future-oriented  research,  this  network 
meta-analysis  (NMa)  was  performed.  compared  with 
traditional  meta-analysis,  the  restriction  of  pairwise 
comparisons  of  the  two  interventions  was  abolished. 
the NMa also compares myriad interventions by simul-
taneously  synthesizing  available  direct  and  indirect 
evidence  [19].  With  regard  to  what  has  been  consid-
ered  above,  we  conducted  the  NMa  to  evaluate  the 
general  efficacy  of  psychotherapy  and  pharmacother-
apy  for  sleep  disorders  among  patients  with  PtsD  and 
recommend  the  most  practical  countermeasures  to 
treat  this  overwhelming  malaise.

the 
(1) 
Participants:  adults  who  had  a  concomitant  diagnosis 
of  PtsD  on  the  basis  of  standard  diagnostic  criteria, 
including  DsM-iii,  DsM-iV,  DsM-iV-tR,  DsM-5  and  a  sig-
nificant  sleep  disorder  as  clearly  defined  by  the  scale 
or  clinical.  one  thing  in  particular  need  for  better 
description  is  that  if  PtsD  is  the  principal  etiology  of 
sleep  disorders,  then  other  comorbidities  are  allowed; 
(2)  interventions:  all  types  of  interventions  (psycho-
included,  psycho-
therapeutic/pharmacological)  are 
therapeutic 
(iRt),  
cBt-i,  hypnosis  and  exposure)  and  pharmacological 
(hydroxyzine,  mianserin,  nabilone  and  prazosin). 
exposure  was  designated  as  a  psychotherapy  that  was 
developed  to  help  people  confront  their  fears  and  it 
might  help  break  the  pattern  of  evasion  [21];  (3) 
comparators:  placebo  or  other  psychotherapeutic/
pharmacological  interventions  (head-to-head  trial);  (4) 
outcomes:  outcomes  were  separated  into  three  classes 
PtsD  related-  (PtsD  symptoms  severity  and  depres-
sion),  sleep  related-  (sleep  quality,  nightmare  severity, 
total  sleep  time)  and  acceptability.  PtsD  symptoms 
severity was estimated by caPs (clinician-administered 
PtsD scale), Pcl (PtsD checklist), Pcl-c (PtsD checklist- 
civilian  Version),  Pss  (PtsD  symptom  scale),  PDs 
(Posttraumatic  Diagnostic  scale),  PtsD  score  and 
self-efficacy,  while  sleep  related  outcomes  were  esti-
mated  by  PsQi  (Pirrsburgh  sleep  Qualify  index),  ies 
(impact  of  event  scale),  isi  (insomnia  severity  index) 
and  insomnia  severity.  acceptability  was  defined  as  a 
multifaceted  concept  that  reflects  the  extent  to  which

restricted 

to  studies  conducted  on 

exclusion  criteria  were  as  follows:  (1)  reported  car-
diovascular  disease,  traumatic  brain  injury  and  other 
non-psychological  conditions  that  may  have  a  greater 
impact  on  the  patient’s  mental  state;  (2)  sleep  disor-
ders  not  caused  by  PtsD  while  incurred  by  other  
psychiatric  disorders  (e.g.  tBi,  other  neurocognitive  
disorders,  and  substance  use  disorders);  (3)  no  avail-
able  data  in  the  original  research  or  the  data  could 
not  be  converted;  (4)  prevention  of  relapse  trials;  (5)

2.3.  Data  extraction  and  quality  assessment

in  the  scale  evaluated  [23]. 

information  was  integrated  into  the  data  extraction  by 
two  independent  authors  (cYh  and  YFZ)  and,  proof-
read  by  a  final  investigator  (cZ).  With  regard  to  the 
selection  of  scales  for  symptom  remission  in  PtsD,  the 
caPs  score  is  the  gold  standard  in  the  process  of  eval-
uation  [3],  for  self-reported  PtsD,  the  Davidson trauma 
scale  served  as  the  gold  standard  [22].  as  for  the 
selection  of  scales  for  relieving  symptoms  of  insomnia, 
the  Pittsburgh  sleep  Quality  index  (PsQi)  score  is  the 
if  the 
gold  standard 
gold-standard  scale  was  not  adopted  in  this  study, 
other  optimal  scales  were  employed  under  careful 
consideration.  the  difference  between  pre-  and  post- 
change  was  selected  for  comparison,  if  the  included 
survey  was  unable  to  contain  this  segment  of  data, 
the  final  measurement  will  be  recruited  [24].  if  relevant 
data  were  not  reported  within  the  article,  the  most 
recent  data  were  calculated  based  on  the  related  data 
reported 
in  the  original  articles.  on  the  quality 
appraisal  of  included  study,  two  reviewers  (cYh  and 
YFZ)  independently  assessed  the  overall  quality  of  the 
included  studies  under  the  criterion  reported  in  the 
new  edition  of  the  cochrane  handbook  for  systematic 
Reviews  of  interventions  [24].

2.4.  Statistical  analysis

continuous  and  dichotomous  outcomes  were  denoted 
as  relative  ratios  (RR)  with  their  corresponding  95% 
confidence  intervals  (ci)  and  standardized  mean  differ-
ences  (sMD)  with  their  corresponding  95%ci  [25].  the 
chi-square  test  was  applied  to  assessing  heterogeneity, 
in  which  the  level  of  significance  was  set  to  p < 0.1,  i2 
values  ≥40%  were  interpreted  as  indicating  significant 
heterogeneity, in which circumstances a random-effects 
model  was  used  to  conduct  meta-analysis,  whereas  for 
i2  values  <40%,  a  fixed-effect  model  was  used  instead

[26].  according  to  the  underlying  assumption  of  tran-
sitivity  within 
the  network,  conflicts  may  exists 
between  pairwise  comparisons  and  the  distribution  of 
effect  modifiers  [27].  When  a  closed  loop  was  consid-
ered  present,  the  ‘loop 
inconsistency’  method  was 
used  for  test  the  inconsistency  [28]. thiswas  noticeable 
when  the  treatment  effects  around  a  loop  did  not  fit 
the  consistency  equations.  the  surface  under  the 
cumulative  ranking  curve  (sUcRa)  with  regard  to  sum-
marizing  probabilities,  was  used  to  provide  summary 
and  pooled  statistics  for  cumulative  ranking.  according 
to  this  definition,  sUcRa  values  mirror  the  effective-
ness  of  an  intervention;  therefore,  a  rank  plot  with 
larger  sUcRa  values  indicates  more  effective  interven-
tions.  Publication  bias  is  analyzed  by  using  funnel 
plots.  Funnel  plot  is  a  scatter  plot  of  the  effect  esti-
mates  from  individual  studies  against  some  measure 
of  each  study’s  size  or  precision.  Funnel  plots  was  used 
to  examine  bias 
in  the  results  of  meta-analyses, 
whereas  x-axis  is  comparison-specific  pooled  effect, 
while  y-axis  is  standard  error  of  sMD  or  standard  error 
of  logRR  [29].  all  statistical  analyses  were  performed 
and  accomplished  using  stata  version  15.0  (statacorp 
llc,  college  station,  tX,  Usa)  and  R  version  4.0.5 
(Vienna,  austria),  obtained  copyright  license.

3.1.  Study  characteristics  and  quality  assessment

the  search  yield  5,095  results.  after  the  initial  evalua-
tion,  1,048  duplicates  were  removed  and  4,026  studies 
were  regarded  as  irrelevant  (as  determined  by  reading 
the  titles  and  abstracts).  21  articles  with  24  Rcts  were 
determined  by  reading  the  full  text.  Ultimately,  20 
studies  were  included  in  the  NMa.  supplementary 
Figure  1  shows  the  work  flow  for  the  selection  of 
studies.

a  total  of  1,647  participants  from  20  articles  with  24 
Rcts  [30–49]  were  included  in  this  NMa.  Baseline  char-
acteristics  are  summarized  in  supplementary  table  1. 
the  two  categories  of  intervention  were  designated  as 
psycho- 
[32–35,37–39,41,44–46,48,49]  or  pharmaco- 
[30,31,36,40,42,43,47].  the  psychotherapy  included  in 
this  NMa  were  cBt-i  [35,39,41,46,48],  cBt-i  plus  iRt 
[33],  iRt  [34,37,38,44,45],  exposure  [49],  and  hypnosis 
[32].  While,  pharmacotherapy 
included  prazosin 
[31,40,42,43,47],  hydroxyzine  [31],  nabilone  [36]  and 
zolpidem  [30].  With  respect  to  the  included  studies, 
seven  studies  evaluated  PtsD  severity  using  caPs 
scale  [34,35,37,40,42,43,49]  and  12  studies  evaluated 
insomnia  severity  using  the  PsQi  scale  [31,33–35,37, 
38,42–45,48,49].

information  on  the  quality  and  bias  risk  assessment 
of  all  studies  is  summarized  in  supplementary  Figure  2 
and  supplementary  Figure  3.

3.2.1.  PTSD  symptom  severity
sixteen  studies  [30,31,33–39,41–44,46,48,49],  with  644 
participants  and  10 
intervention  categories  were 
included  in  the  NMa  to  assess  PtsD  symptoms.  a  net-
work  plot  of  PtsD  symptom  severity,  including  nine 
categories  of  active  interventions  (five  psychological 
and  four  pharmacological  interventions)  and  placebo, 
is  presented  in  Figure  1a.  No  inconsistencies  were 
found in the severity of PtsD symptoms (supplementary

chological  interventions,  including  cBt-i  (sMD=  −1.51,

interventions,  including  prazosin  (sMD=  −0.87,  95%ci:-
1.59  to  −0.16),  hydroxyzine  (sMD=  −1.06,  95%ci:  −1.94 
to  −0.19),  significantly  reduced  PtsD  symptom  severity 
compared  with  placebo,  while  zolpidem  (sMD=  2.71, 
95%ci:  0.56  to  4.86)  showed  significantly  poor  treat-
ment  compared  with  all  types  of  interventions  (table 
1).  comparisons  of  the  effects  of  other  active  interven-
tions  on  PtsD  symptom  severity  are  summarized  in

Note:  each  sector  is  colored  according  to  the  sUcRA  value  for  the  corresponding  treatment  and  outcome.  The  scale  consists  of  the  transformation  of 
three  colors  red  (0%),  yellow  (50%),  and  green  (100%).  each  color  is  associated  with  a  different  pattern.  Uncolored  sectors  show  that  the  underlying 
treatment  was  not  included  in  the  network  meta-analysis  for  a  particular  outcome.  sUcRA:  surface  under  cumulative  ranking.  sUcRA  is  a  numeric  repre-
sentation  of  the  overall  ranking  and  presents  a  single  number  associated  with  each  treatment.  sUcRA  values  ranged  from  0  to  100%.  The  higher  the 
sUcRA  value,  and  the  closer  to  100%,  the  higher  the  likelihood  that  a  therapy  is  in  the  top  rank  or  one  of  the  top  ranks;  the  closer  to  0  the  sUcRA  vaslue,

4.  Discussion

3.2.6.  Acceptability
twenty  studies  [30–49]  with  1,647  participants  and  11 
intervention  categories  were  included  in  the  NMa  to 

this  NMa  is  the  most  up-to-date  analysis  of  currently 
available  data  on  psychotherapeutic  and  pharmacolog-
ical  treatment  regimes  for  individuals  with  PtsD  and 

sleep  disorders  to  identify  the  most  effective  regime 
for  tackling  this  overwhelming  distress.  twenty-four 
Rcts  were  pooled  and  included  to  consider  the  direct 
and  indirect  evidence,  and  a  systematic  review  and 
NMa  were  performed  to  provide  a  basis  for  evidence- 
based  medicine  for  clinicians  and  clinical  researchers 
to  choose  more  effective  treatment  to  cope  with  PtsD 
individuals  with  sleep  disorders.  Based  on  these  data, 
psychotherapy  (cBt-i)  was  more  advised  than  pharma-
cological  therapy,  which  complied  with  the  highly  rec-
ommended  treatments  among  guidelines  put  forward 
by  the  american  academy  of  sleep  Medicine  that, 
under  most  circumstances,  this 
is  what  clinicians 
should  be  aware  of  and  adhereto  the  clinicians  [50]. 
the  present  reviews  focus  on  recent  psychotherapy 
and  pharmacotherapy  for  sleep  disorder 
in  PtsD, 
advocated  that  there  exists  a  bidirectional  relationship 
between  sleep  disorder  and  PtsD,  it  tends  that  there 
need  effective  interventions  for  PtsD  patients  have  a 
comorbid  sleep  disorder,  and  targeted  sleep  interven-
tions  can  ameliorate  sleep  symptoms  and  mitigate 
daytime  PtsD  symptoms  [8].  sertraline  was  suggested 
that  it  might  improve  sleep  in  PtsD  compared  to  pla-
cebo,  while  due  to  the  low  certainty  and  the  estimates 
they  calculated  are  not  robust  enough  to  guide  clinical 
decisions  [51].  as  the  treatment  plan  remains  to  be 
developed  in  a  more  acceptable  way  to  most  PtsD- 
diagnosed  patients,  also  before  further  develop  an 
appropriate  treatment  plan  for  these  patients  evaluate 
the  current  statues  of  PtsD  patients  have  a  comorbid-
ity  of  sleep  disorder  is  important  [52].

according  to  the  collected  data,  cBt-i  plus  iRt  and 
cBt-i  may  be  the  most  appropriate  countermeasures 
for  tackling  PtsD  symptom  severity.  For  sleep  quality, 
cBt-i  may  be  the  most  appropriate  optionforthe 
regimes.  as  for  nightmare  severity,  pharmacological 
therapy  was  more  dominant  in  reducing  the  frequency 
of  prazosin  and  hydroxyzine  having  a  higher  priority 
than  other  therapeutic  procedures.  in  addition,  cBt-i 
and  hypnosis  were  recommended  for  acceptability, 
while  there  was  no  difference  between  all  the  included 
interventions  and  the  placebo.  With  regard  to  tst, 
depression,  and  cBt-i  following  exposure,  cBt-i  was 
recommended  for  them  respectively. 
it  should  be 
noted  that  all  therapeutic  regimes  described  above 
were  recommended  sequentially. the  National  institute 
for  health  and  care  excellence 
(Nice)  guidelines 
 consider  cBt  as  the  most  effective  psychological  inter-
vention  when  aimed  at  specific  symptoms  such  as 
sleep  disturbance,  as  well  as  improving  overall  PtsD 
symptoms  [53].  this  was  largely  consistent  with  what 
has  been  found  in  this  NMa  that  psychotherapy  was 
for  high-priority  in  most  cases  except  for  a  mental

condition  that  develops  following  a  traumatic  event 
characterized.  For  this  kind  of  intrusive  thoughts,  phar-
macological  therapy  with  prazosin  was  recommended, 
which  was  in  accordance  with  the  clinical  guideline  as 
World  Federation  of  societies  of  Biological  Psychiatry 
(WFsBP)  referred  to  prazosin  as  effective  in  treating 
nightmares  in  PtsD  [12].

large  confidence 

While  there  also  exist  a  phenomenon  that  there 
exist 
intervals  that  border  zero, 
appropriate  explanations  can  be  attributed  as  follow, 
the  variance  of  the  research  results  increases,  the  fea-
sible  interval  widens  and  the  credibility  decreases. 
therefore,  the  interpretation  of  the  results  needs  to  be 
more cautious, and follow-up large-sample high-quality 
Rcts  are  required  to  verify  it.

the correlation between sleep disorder and PtsD has 
long  been  described  in  previous  research,  and  it  has 
been  reportedthat  insomnia  is  a  prevailing  clinical  man-
ifestation  of  PtsD,  which  develops  after  trauma  related 
cases  or  analog  trauma. to  take  things  further,  insomnia 
symptom  antecede  trauma  is  an  extreme  risk  factor  for 
the  progression  of  PtsD  [54,55].  in  addition,  there  are 
similarities  between  the  outcomes  expressed  by  one 
study:  a  cohort  of  15,204  military  personnel  found  that 
pre-deployment  insomnia  was  significantly  associated 
with  new-onset  PtsD,  depression,  anxiety  and  those 
described by another study that pre-deployment insom-
nia was conducive to forecasting post-deployment PtsD 
and suicidal ideation in army soldiers [56,57]. collectively, 
the  present  meta-analysis  manifest  there  exist  strong 
linkage  between  sleep  and  PtsD,  as  one  meta-analysis 
mentioned  PtsD  patients  have  significantly  lower  sleep 
efficiency  [58,59].

one  particular  phenomenon  was  observed  in  the 
NMa  result  of  PtsD  symptom  severity:  the  potency  of 
zolpidem  was  significantly  poorer  than  with  that  of  all 
other  interventions.  to  date,  there  is  no  exist  evidence  
or  related  clinical  research  exploring  the  potential  or 
relationship  between  zolpidem  and  PtsD. 
obscure 
Zolpidem,  commonly  recognized  as  a  Z-drug, 
is  a 
non-benzodiazepine  hypnotic  that  enhances  the  activity 
of  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GaBa)  at  the  GaBaa 
receptor.  in  most  cases,  it  is  administered  to  treat  dis-
abling  anxiety  and  insomnia  [60,61].  according  to  this 
unique algorithm, NMa allows the synthesis of data from 
a  network  of  Rcts  and  boosts  the  simultaneous  compar-
ison  of  many  interventions  [19,62].  Because  of  this,  zolp-
idem  was  compounded  in  the  potential  comparisons 
and  thus  concluded  that  zolpidem  was  nevertheless 
worse  than  any  other  contained  interventions.  however, 
this  conclusion  may  be  somewhat  limited  by  the  scarcity 
of the literature. therefore, further PtsD-zolpidem-related 
trials  should  be  conducted  in  the  future.

exposure  therapy  is  a  psychotherapy  developed  to 
help  people  confront  their  fears  and  it  might  help 
break  the  pattern  of  evasion.  in  this  procedure,  indi-
viduals  were  exposed  to  the  things  they  feared  and 
avoided  within  a  fairly  safe  and  sound  atmosphere  cre-
ated  by  psychologists.  in  relation  to  treatment  efficacy, 
four  functional  dimensions  were  considered  in  which 
habituation,  extinction,  self-efficacy  and  emotional 
processing  were  integrated  from  the  clinical  practice 
guidelines  for  the  treatment  of  PtsD  [21].  as  described 
in  the  consequence  of  this  NMa,  exposure  was  the 
most  distinguished  initiative  to  treat  depression  fol-
lowing  the  cBt-i.  a  clinical  trial  aimed  at  refugees 
revealed  that  there  were  no  discrepancies  between 
exposure  and  cBt,  and  that  exposure  led  to  a  54% 
reduction  in  depression  and  57%  reduction  in  cBt 
[63].  contrary  to  this  NMa  that  exposure  in  curtailing 
depression  was  more  efficacious  than  cBt-i,  with 
regard  to  this  the  possible  explanation  might  attribute 
to  the  reason  that  head-to-head  trials  (cBt-i  and  expo-
sure)  has  not  been  pulled  off.  Whereas  for  the  facet  of 
medical  usage  prazosin,  zolpidem  and  mianserin  was 
not  suitable  in  the  governance  of  depression  in  PtsD 
individuals,  as 
the  National  health  and  Medical 
Research  australian  Guidelines  suggested  that  ser-
traline,  paroxetine  or  fluoxetine  was  suggested  for 
those  who  is  unwilling  or  unable  to  access  psycholog-
ical  treatment  [10].

insomnia 

cBt-i,  a  short-term  therapy  model  that  specifically 
is  the  most  effective 
addresses  chronic 
non-medical  intervention  for  managing  insomnia  [64]. 
the  results  of  this  NMa  according  to  sleep  quality 
were  in  line  with  the  idea  that  cBt-i  is  effective  and 
has  significantly  improved  sleep  quality,  yet,  to  some 
extent,  dismantled  insomnia  severity.  hypnosis,  pra-
zosin,  hydroxyzine  and  mianserin  exhibited  signifi-
cantly  unsatisfactory  resuls  as  opposed  to  cBt-i.  other 
interventions,  especially  pharmacological  interventions 
(prazosin,  hydroxyzine  and  mianserin)  were  found  to 
be  more  worse  in  controlling  or  healing  sleep  quality 
in  contrast  with  cBt-i.  Prazosin  commonly  utilized 
treatment  for  PtsD  nightmares  is  an  alpha-1-blocker 
that  acts  as  an  inverse  agonist  at  alpha-1  adrenergic 
receptors,  works  to  block  noradrenergic  stimulation  of 
the  alpha-1  adrenoreceptor  [65].  a  previous  meta- 
analysis  confirmed  that  prazosin  has  a  statistically 
 significant  benefit  on  PtsD  symptoms  and  sleep  dis-
turbances,  as  well  as WFsBP  recommended:  prazosin  is 
effective  in  treating  nightmares  in  PtsD  [12,66],  which 
is  consistent  with  the  results  of  this  NMa  regarding 
nightmare  severity  that  pharmacological  treatments 
were  in  higher  priority  than  psychotherapy,  which  indi-
cated  that  prazosin  and  hydroxyzine  tended  to  be 

in  relieving  or 

more  potent 
improving  nightmare 
severity.  a  relevant  study  also  suggested  that  both 
prazosin  and  hydroxyzine  can  be  regarded  as  pharma-
cological  agent  for  treating  sleep  disorders  and  night-
mares  in  populations  who  experienced  PtsD,  which 
also  leads  to  reductions  in  PtsD  symptoms  [31].  on 
account  of  what  has  been  talked  over  above,  cBt-i 
and  prazosin  was  recommended  for  patients  who 
underwent  PtsD  with  sleep  quality 
impaired  and 
nightmares,  individually.

talks 

about  pharmacotherapy  prazosin 

as  can  be  seen  from  the  tst  outcome,  the  interven-
tions  were  plausibly  analogous  when  referring  to  the 
sleep  duration  prolonged  by  the  two  categories  of 
treatments  (psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy).  in 
agreement with the composed data on tst, NMa results 
showed  that  psychotherapy  (cBt-i)  tended  to  show 
greater  efficacy,  while  cBt-i  plus  iRt  and  pharmacologi-
cal  treatments  (prazosin  and  hydroxyzine)  did  not  dis-
play  any  disparities  in  contrast  with  placebo,  while 
considering  direct  results  the  outcomes  were  diametri-
cally opposite. Nice proposed cBt as an evidence-based 
targeting expedient in treating sleep disturbance and so 
long  as  the  symptom  of  sleep  disorder  was  alleviated, 
the  sleep  duration  will  also  be  increased,  which  indi-
rectly  boosted  tst  to  some  extent  [53].  howbeit,  when 
and 
it 
hydroxyzine,  both  kind  of  encaging  interventions  is 
hard  to  distinguish  the  efficacy  of  treating  tst,  as 
WFsBP  advocated  that  prazosin  was  utilized  in  treating 
nightmares  in  PtsD  [12],  once  the  medication  was  tak-
ing  effect  it  will  sooner  or  later  transfer  into  the  out-
come  that  the  sleep  duration  will  be 
increased. 
hydroxyzine,  an  antihistamine  with  active  ingredients  of 
hydroxyzine  hydrochloride,  is  mostly  used  to  treat  anxi-
ety  and  difficulty 
in  sleeping  as  counseled  by  the 
National  alliance  on  Mental  illness  [67].  considering  the 
major  points  mentioned  above  and  the  unclear  risk  of 
bias  of  included  trials,  which  could  lead  to  errors  that 
the  conclusion  of  this  outcome  could  not  easily  be  con-
firmed.  therefore,  more  high  quality  Rcts  investigating 
tst  and  PtsD  employing  different  categories  of  inter-
vention need to be conducted to further verify our find-
ings  and  probe  the  potential  between  them.  Based  on 
the  outcome  of  acceptability,  there  were  no  dissimilari-
ties  between  placebo  and  the  encompassed  interven-
tions,  indicating  that  the  encaged  interventions  pan  out 
a  seemingly  virtuous  conformance.

in  comparison  with  a  previously  published  meta- 
analysis  [68],  the  NMa  synthesized  psychotherapy  and 
pharmacotherapy  to  further  rank  the 
interventions 
with  regard  to  their  efficacy  in  treating  PtsD  and  sleep 
related  outcomes  to  evaluate  their  appropriateness. 
Notwithstanding  the  most  comprehensive  NMa  [69] 

appraised  the  efficacy  and  acceptability  of  both  cate-
gories  (psycho-  and  pharmaco-)  of  interventions  on 
trauma  related  nightmares,  concluding  that  iRt  and 
prazosin  should  be  considered  as  the  inaugural  choice 
of  psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy  separately, 
this  study  was  partially  consistent  with  the  referred 
NMa  in  which  iRt  and  prazosin  were  suggested.  the 
distinctness  of  this  NMa  was  that  we  comprehensively 
analyzed  the  above-mentioned  outcomes  related  to 
sleep  disorders  (e.g.  sleep  quality  and  total  sleep  time) 
in  which  these  efforts  could  be  regarded  as  supple-
mentary  for  the  quoted  NMa,  while  what  this  NMa 
had  done  was  more  encompassing  and  universal  fol-
lowing  stricter  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.

the  strengths  of  this  study  were  the  availability  of 
NMa  for  data  processing,  which  enhances  the  scope  of 
conventional  paired  analysis  by  concurrently  dissecting 
direct  and  indirect  evidence  from  different  studies, 
even  in  the  absence  of  a  comparison  between  two 
interventions  as  head-to-head  trials,  estimating  the  rel-
ative  potency  of  all  the  interventions  considered  and 
building  a  ranking  order  for  them.  in  addition,  our 
research  may  have  a  potential 
influence  on  the 
advancement  of  research  in  this  field  and  clinical  prac-
tice.  Due  to  the  paucity  of  related  clinical  guidelines, 
this  NMa  may  help  medical  and  health  service  person-
nel  and  scientists  or  researchers  to  buckle  down  to  
the  regimes  for  treatment  based  on  our  research  and 
further  intensively  inquiring  following  procedures  in 
promising  interventions  such  as  cBt-i  and  inserting 
exposure  into  cBt-i.  Furthermore,  if  the  Nice  guide-
lines  are  updated,  our  effort  may  be  identified  as  more 
viable,  as  this  NMa  hands  over  comprehensive  over-
views  of  the  current  evidence-based  approaches  of 
psycho-  and  pharmaco-  interventions  being  treated  for 
individuals  with  PtsD.

limitations  should  also  be  noted  when  presenting 
the  results  of  this  study.  (1)  the  head-to-head  studies 
were  sparse,  which  led  to  the  use  of  mostly  indirect 
estimates  for  all  comparisons  between  interventions 
which  might  directly  imprecise  estimates;  (2)  almost  all 
the  included  studies  reported  continuity  variables  such 
as  insomnia  duration,  nightmare  frequency  and  total 
sleep  time  pre-  and  post-  within  each  trail  as  well  as 
their  varied  follow-up  times,  which  might  explain  the 
high  heterogeneity  in  this  study;  (3)  among  certain  tri-
als  for  several  psycho-  or  pharmaco- 
intervention 
nodes  (e.g.  cBt-i,  zolpidem,  and  nabilone)  in  this  NMa 
were  diminutive,  however,  the  statistical  power  was 
limited.  For  these  reasons,  hierarchies  namely  sUcRa 
rankings  were  not  processed  and  interpreted  under 
the  limelight.

5.  Conclusion

to 

respect 

in  aggregate,  the  results  from  this  study  support  the 
use  of  psychotherapy;  specifically,  cBt-i  was  more  rec-
ommended  than  any  other  countermeasures  in  treat-
ing  adults  with  PtsD  co-existing  with  sleep  disorders. 
additionally,  for  PtsD  related  outcomes,  cBt-i  and 
cBt-i  plus  iRt  were  advised  to  treat  PtsD  symptom 
severity,  whereas  cBt-i  and  exposure  were  more  com-
pelling  with 
rehabilitating  depression. 
Regarding  sleep  related  outcomes,  cBt-i  could  be 
available  of  for  those  who  had  problems  in  sleep  qual-
ity;  however,  pharmacotherapy,  namely  prazosin  was 
effective  in  coping  with  nightmare  severity.  Besides, 
cBt-i  indicated  an  effect  in  improving tst,  but  data  on 
this  outcome  were  scarce  and  did  not  allow  firm  con-
clusions.  other  included  interventions  (e.g.  iRt,  cBt-i 
plus  iRt,  nabilone,  exposure,  hydroxyzine  and  hypno-
sis)  warranted  further  sampling  in  the  steadily  carried 
out  high-quality  Rcts.  additionally,  future  guidelines 
and  daily  errands  in  clinical  decision-making  on  alter-
native  interventions  for  PtsD  individuals  with  sleep 
disorders  should  consider  these  disclosures.  the  rele-
vant  clinical  guidelines  for  the  management  of  individ-
uals  with  PtsD  and  sleep  disorders  may  regard  this  as 
a  reference.  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  for  those 
who  would  like  to  interpret  our  results,  there  is  a  need 
to  keep  in  mind  the  restricted  available  information.
