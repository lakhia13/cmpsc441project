Abstract
Objective: Childhood attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
known to be associated with adult Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). We

investigated if any of the subdimensions of childhood ADHD, that is, impulsiv-
ity, inattention, or hyperactivity was more prominent in this association.
Methods: In a nation-wide cohort (N = 13,330), we utilized parent reported
symptoms of childhood ADHD and clinically ascertained adult BPD diagnoses.
The summed total scores of ADHD symptoms and its three subdimensions

were used and standardized for effect size comparison. Associations were ana-
lyzed using Cox regression with sex and birth-year adjustments. Secondary

outcomes were BPD-associated traits (i.e., self-harm and substance use) ana-

lyzed using logistic- and linear regression respectively.
Results: ADHD symptom severity was positively associated with BPD with a
hazard ratio (HR) of 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22–1.79) per standard
deviation increase in total ADHD symptoms. Impulsivity was the most promi-

nent subdimension with the only statistically significant association when
analyzed in a model mutually adjusted for all ADHD subdimensions—HR for
inattention: 1.15 (95% CI: 0.85–1.55), hyperactivity: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.69–1.26),
impulsivity: 1.46 (95% CI: 1.12–1.91). In secondary analyses, weak positive
associations were seen between total ADHD symptom score and self-harm and

substance use. In analyses by subdimensions of ADHD, associations were weak
and most prominent for inattention in the model with self-harm.
Conclusion: Childhood ADHD symptoms were associated with subsequent
development of BPD diagnosis and appeared to be driven primarily by impul-
sivity. Our findings are important for understanding the association between

childhood symptoms of ADHD and subsequent BPD.

I N T R O D U C T I O N

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a condition char-
acterized by instability in affect, self-image, and interper-
sonal relationships and by extreme sensitivity to perceived
interpersonal slights.1–3 Self-destructive behaviors, such as
self-harm and substance use are common and often fur-
ther aggravate the underlying condition.2–5 The symptoms
and difficulties of BPD are particularly prevalent during
adolescence and early adulthood.6 BPD and its associated
psychiatric and social consequences are associated with
significant suffering and studies have reported lifetime
BPD prevalence estimated to approximately 6%.7 Health
care consumption is disproportionally high alongside high
rates of suicide (4.7%8) in this group of patients.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
neuropsychiatric condition with childhood-onset charac-
terized by impairment because of difficulties with sus-
taining attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control.3
ADHD is a common comorbid condition in individuals
with BPD9–11 and the two conditions share symptoms of
impulsivity and emotional instability.

Etiological studies have shown genetic and environ-
mental causes for BPD.9,12 There are also indications in
the literature of ADHD and BPD sharing origin in terms
of genetic and environmental factors.13,14 It has been sug-
gested that ADHD could be an early stage of BPD15 and
that the two conditions constitute different manifestations
of a common underlying mechanism.16 This is supported
by findings of children diagnosed with ADHD being at
increased risk of developing BPD17,18 and of ADHD-
symptom severity in childhood being positively associated
with BPD-symptom severity in adulthood.19,20 However,
little is known if any subdimension of childhood ADHD is
particularly prominent in the association with later BPD.

Both the international classification of disorders
(ICD)21,22and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM)3 acknowledge three symptom
dimensions in ADHD; the inattentive, the hyperactive
and the impulsive, and previous studies of how the symp-
toms of ADHD covary have supported this three-factor
structure.23,24 However, most
research to date has
focused on ADHD subdivided into either the inattentive
subdimension or the hyperactive and impulsive subdi-
mension or all combined as defined in the DSM.25,26

To our knowledge only one previous study has
attempted to investigate if the subdimensions of ADHD
during childhood are differentially present in individuals

Significant Outcomes

• Results indicate that impulsivity impacts the
association between childhood symptoms of
ADHD and BPD the most out of the subdimen-
sions of ADHD, that is, inattention, hyperactiv-
ity and impulsivity.

• Clinical implications include the importance in
noting individual symptom profiles in children.
More specifically it highlights the importance
in noting children with impulse control diffi-
culties regardless of ADHD-diagnosis status
with regards to BPD, particularly in girls with
other predisposing factors for BPD.

• In practice, our finding could be helpful for cli-
nicians and policymakers to make informed
care
decisions when
resources, for example, to prioritize girls with
impulse control difficulties for follow up.

Limitations

• Individuals diagnosed with BPD are predomi-
nantly female in our sample, as previously
found in clinical populations, whereas more
evenly prevalent in the two sexes in population
studies. This may limit the generalizability of
our findings to male.

• We were unable to analyze the associations
between childhood symptoms of ADHD and
later BPD in a subsample of individuals with
limitation by
diagnosed ADHD because of
power. This may limit generalizability to a clin-
ical population of
individuals with diag-
nosed ADHD.

with BPD.27 That study aimed to identify classes of differ-
ent profiles of childhood symptoms of ADHD and accom-
panying adult symptoms of BPD and/or ADHD. The
findings suggested ten different developmental pathways
between specific childhood ADHD symptom combinations
and adult BPD- and ADHD symptom combinations. The
most common pathway was between childhood symptoms
of inattention, hyperactivity as well as impulsivity and
subsequent adult symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity
and impulsivity plus high levels of symptoms of BPD.

However, symptoms of ADHD in childhood were assessed
in retrospect in this study, inducing risk of recall bias. In
addition, the population was a clinical sample of adults
diagnosed with BPD and/or ADHD without general popu-
lation controls. The finding of developmental pathways
between specific childhood ADHD symptom profiles and
subsequent adult BPD/ADHD symptom profiles implied a
value in further investigating the association between the
subdimensions of ADHD and BPD.

1.1

| Aims of the study

The primary aim was to investigate if any of the subdi-
mensions of ADHD in childhood (i.e., inattention, hyper-
activity or impulsivity) was more prominent
in the
association between childhood symptoms of ADHD and
clinically ascertained BPD. The secondary aim was to
investigate if any of
those subdimensions was more
prominently associated with BPD-related behaviors, spe-
cifically self-harm, alcohol use, and drug use. Our
hypothesis was that impulsivity would consistently be
most prominently associated with all outcome measures.

| Study population

We used data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study
in Sweden (CATSS), which invites parents of all twins
born in Sweden from July 1, 1992 and onwards.28 We
included twins whose parents had responded to the
assessment of ADHD-symptoms in their children at age
9 or 12 (individuals in the first three birth cohort years
were contacted at age 12, the rest at age 9). The overall
participation rate in the age 9/12 assessment was 69%
(75% in the first birth cohorts).29 We also used assess-
ments at age 18 and national register data,
linked
through the individually unique Swedish personal num-
bers. See Figure S1 for study cohort selection.

Information about BPD diagnoses were extracted
from the National Patient Register (NPR)30 updated until
December 31, 2016. CATSS data were updated until
August 29, 2019.

In the primary outcome analyses investigating associ-
ations between childhood symptoms of ADHD and adult
BPD, individuals younger than 18 at the last NPR update
were excluded as BPD is generally not diagnosed before
age 18 in Swedish clinical practice (see e.g. Supplemental
eFigure 1 in Skoglund et al.9).

data from the CATSS self-assessments at age 18. Individ-
uals who had not responded to all the age 18 assessments
utilized in our study were excluded in these analyses.

The study cohort consisted of 13,330 individuals in
the primary analyses and 8995 individuals in secondary
analyses (see Figure S1 for information on inclusions and
exclusions).

2.2

| Exposure variables

At age 9 or 12, parent rated childhood ADHD symptoms
were assessed using the Autism—Tics, AD/HD and other
Comorbidities inventory (A-TAC), evaluating the degree
of the 18 symptoms of ADHD as defined in DSM IV31,32
and ICD 10.2,33 The A-TAC-items have three response
options 0 = No, 0.5 = Yes, to a certain degree, and
1 = Yes, refer to lifetime symptoms and have been found
to be of good reliability34 and of good validity31 regarding
clinically diagnosed ADHD. We constructed a sum score
of total ADHD-symptoms, and three of the subdimensions
of ADHD—inattention (9 questions), hyperactivity (5 ques-
tions) and impulsivity (4 questions), according to the
ICD-10 definition22,33—a subdivision previously con-
firmed through factor analysis.31 We confirmed the same
tree-factor structure, using an exploratory approach with
the principal component method, with an additional
approximately 15,000 individuals compared with the
original report31 (see Figure S2 and Table S1 for results
from the exploratory factor analysis with the principal
component method). The ADHD-scores and subdimen-
sions were standardized before analyses to facilitate effect
size comparison.

2.3

| Outcome variables

We obtained the first recorded date of diagnosed BPD,
defined as an F60.3 ICD-10-code in the NPR. We did not
differentiate between primary- and secondary diagnoses.
The diagnoses registered in the NPR are based on clinical
assessments. The national clinical guidelines for assess-
ment and treatment of personality disorder issued by the
Swedish Psychiatric Association recommends careful
clinical interviews, using validated interview instruments
for assessing BPD and SCID-II is emphasized.35 Two
medical chart validation studies have been performed
regarding BPD diagnosis in the NPR; a study by Kuoppis
et al. found a positive predictive value of 100% using
ICD-criteria,36 another study by Kuja-Halkola et al.
reported a positive predictive value of 81%.14

In secondary analyses the outcome measures were

ing or not having self-harmed up to the age of 18 based

on the combination of self-ratings in the Life History of
Aggression questionnaire (LHA), and the Brief Obsessive
Compulsive Scale (BOCS), and parental ratings in the
Adult Behavior Check List (ABCL). See Table S2 for
questionnaire details and Table S3 for distribution of
responses.

Sum scores of alcohol and drug use, were created from
self-ratings in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
Test (AUDIT) and the Drug Use Disorders Identification
Test (DUDIT), respectively (see Table S2).

| Covariates

Sex was considered a confounder and birthyear was
included to take diagnostic trends into account. Medica-
tion for ADHD before the childhood assessment was con-
sidered a possible confounder reducing both childhood
ADHD symptoms and adult BPD symptoms. ADHD-
medication before BPD or secondary outcomes were con-
sidered possible mediators as we expected the degree of
ADHD-symptoms in childhood to be positively associated
with medication status, which in turn was expected to be
associated with reduced symptoms of BPD compared
childhood ADHD-
with individuals with similar
symptoms who remained un-medicated. Therefore,
binary variables, indicating having or not having medi-
cated with drugs for ADHD, were created with data from
the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register.37 See Table S3 for
detailed information.

| Statistical analyses

2.5.1

| Descriptive information

We summarized the total number and percentages of
individuals with BPD diagnosis, means and numbers and
proportions of the exposure and outcome variables, the
numbers and proportions of those who had had medica-
tion in childhood and medication before the outcomes,
and the means of the ADHD-symptomatology at age 18.
We did this for the total population and by sex. We also
estimated the cumulative incidence of BPD, for the total

population and stratified by sex, using Kaplan–Meier
approach.

2.5.2

| Association with BPD diagnosis

To analyze the association between childhood ADHD-
symptoms and subsequent BPD diagnoses we used Cox
regression and estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). We performed separate ana-
lyses for the total ADHD-symptoms and for each subdi-
mension (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) to
analyze the effect of each exposure. To compare the
effects of each subdimension to each other, we also fitted
a mutually adjusted model. The estimates were adjusted
for sex and birth year. Since most individuals with BPD
diagnoses in our sample were female and the NPR BPD
diagnoses in females have been found to be of good valid-
ity, we additionally performed the same analyses among
females only.

2.5.3

| Association with secondary outcomes

To analyze associations between childhood ADHD symp-
toms and secondary BPD-associated outcomes up until
age 18, we used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios
(ORs) of self-harm, and linear regression to estimate asso-
ciations with alcohol- and drug use. Analogous to ana-
lyses with BPD as outcome, separate, and mutually
adjusted models were fitted. All analyses were adjusted
for sex and birth year.

Sensitivity analyses

For primary outcome analyses of BPD, analyses with
adjustment for medication before BPD and adult ADHD
symptoms were performed. For secondary outcomes
additional analyses with adjustments for medication in

Childhood mean ADHD-symptom scores were higher in
males than in females. Individuals with BPD diagnoses

For the BPD-associated behaviors we found positive asso-
ciations between total ADHD-score and self-harm, OR:
1.25 (95% CI: 1.17–1.32) (Figure 3). When examining the
associations by subdimension in separate models, the
most prominent positive association was with inattention
(OR: 1.24 [95% CI: 1.17–1.31]) and the tendency
remained in the combined model (OR: 1.20 [95% CI:
1.12–1.28]).

The results indicated no statistically significant associ-

To our knowledge this is the first longitudinal study
investigating the association between the childhood
ADHD subdimensions of inattention, hyperactivity, and
impulsivity and later BPD. The results of the present
study confirm results from previous studies of a positive
association between the degree of total ADHD-symptom
severity in childhood and later BPD. The subdimension
analyses indicate that childhood symptom of impulsivity
is the most prominent of the subdimensions, and drives
the association with later BPD.

Results from the secondary analyses indicate similar
positive associations between total ADHD symptom score
and self-harm and drug use but not with alcohol use.
Unlike the overall association with BPD, the most promi-
nent subdimensional association was between inatten-
tion and self-harm, but no positive association was found
for any of the subdimensions with alcohol- or drug use.
Lastly a weak negative association was found between
inattention and alcohol use in the combined model.

that
Within-pair analyses indicated that genetic and environ-
mental effects shared between twins may play a role in
the associations however, caution is warranted because
of limited statistical power.

The results of the current study confirm previously
raised hypotheses of impulsivity as a common underlying
feature in ADHD and BPD.42 This is in line with neuro-
function
imaging data indicating aberrant prefrontal
associated with impaired impulse control in both BPD
and ADHD in childhood as well as in adulthood.43,44

Clinical implications include the importance of not-
ing individual symptom profiles. Specifically, our findings
indicate a value in noting the subdimensions of ADHD
as separate entities as associations differ between those
and BPD and the associated behaviors self-harm, alcohol-
and drug use. For instance, for BPD the results indicate
that impulsivity is the most prominent and driving of the
subdimensions in the association with childhood symp-
toms of ADHD, whereas for self-harm, inattention is the
most prominent and driving of the subdimensions.

Regarding self-harm, the result deviates from the
hypothesis and previous findings25,45 where childhood
hyperactive/impulsive ADHD subtype has been found to
be associated with higher HR of suicide attempts. In

finding. The

contrast to previous studies based on the two subdimen-
sions inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, we ana-
lyzed hyperactivity and impulsivity as a separate
subdimensions which may explain the differences in
findings. The manner in which the self-harm variable
importance to the
was constructed may also be of
current
in using CATSS-
rationale
questionnaire data was to use a sensitive measure of
self-harm and the assumption that self-rating measures
are more sensitive than, for example, clinical diagnoses.
For instance, not all
individuals who self-harm seek
health care and self-rating measures are likely to capture
such behaviors at lower thresholds than routine clinical
interviews.46 Also, in contrast to merely studying associ-
ation with suicide attempts, we analyzed associations
with a combination of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)
and suicide attempts. This decision was made because
suicidal intent is often transient and unreliable and as
both behaviors are part of the diagnostic criteria for BPD
and constitute important risk factors for death by
suicide.47 Our prevalence estimates of self-harm are in-
line with previous Swedish population estimates,46 indi-
cating validity and thereby generalizability of the present
findings. In a clinical context these findings indicate that
it may be of particular importance to assess self-harm in
individuals with problems of inattention. The under-
standing of the association between subdimensions of
ADHD and self-harm may benefit from further studies
of NSSI and suicide attempts separately.

Of specific interest, the only statistically significant
associations regarding childhood ADHD symptoms and
quantity of alcohol- and drug use was a weak positive
association between total ADHD-score and DUDIT score
and a negative association between inattention and
AUDIT score. These findings are surprising, as they differ
from previous studies where total ADHD score and the
hyperactive/impulsive subtype has been found to be sig-
nificantly associated with AUDIT26 and ADHD and
impulsivity has been found to be associated with alcohol-
and drug use.48 Possible explanations for this difference,
may lie in the variable construction and study design.
The decision to use self-rated AUDIT and DUDIT data
from CATSS for these two secondary outcomes was based
on the same rationale as for the self-harm variable, that
is, aiming for sensitive measures of substance use. The
clinical scales AUDIT and DUDIT were designed for
early detection of harmful use.49 The study design only
captures problematic alcohol- and drug use around the
age of 18 and not with later onset. Also, individuals with
severe mental illness including alcohol- and drug use dis-
orders are under-represented in the CATSS cohort.28 In
contrast to previous studies, we analyzed the hyperactive
and not
and impulsive

together. Taken together, the estimates for alcohol- and
substance use should be interpreted with caution.

There are several strengths to our study. The study
population is large (N = 13,330 in analyses of BPD and
8995 in secondary analyses) and nation-wide, enabling
outcome estimates of good precision and generalizability.
The instrument used for measuring ADHD symptoms, A-
TAC, has a good reliability and validity adding to preci-
sion and accuracy respectively. BPD-diagnoses in the
NPR have good validity adding to accuracy. Also, the lon-
gitudinal design with prospective assessments reduces
recall bias.

Some limitations need to be mentioned. Regarding
our study population: A family history of psychiatric ill-
ness, lower socioeconomic status and diagnosed ADHD
is more common among nonparticipants.28 Individuals
diagnosed with BPD are predominantly female in our
sample, as previously found in clinical populations and
in the NPR,9,36 whereas more evenly prevalent in the two
sexes in studies based on face-to-face interviews in sam-
ples representative of general populations.7 The cumula-
tive incidence of BPD of 0.7% in the current study is low,
compared with that of general population interview
studies,7 particularly in men (0.1%) and those oldest at
study end are 24.5 years old. Even so, the estimates are in
line with previous clinical population estimates of a birth
cohort that overlaps with our study population (see sup-
plemental eFigure 1 in Skoglund et al.9). Taken together;
the population, the selection and variable definition, may
limit generalizability particularly in male and in individ-
uals with BPD symptomatology with later onset. Regard-
ing the ADHD symptom assessments at age 18 we lack
information related to other factors such as comorbidity
and substance use that may influence the reported symp-
toms, yet the association patterns persisted after adjust-
ment for ADHD symptoms at age 18 indicating no major
influence by those. Residual confounding cannot be ruled
out in the associations that were found. This includes
higher order psychiatric factors such as neuropsychiatric
symptomatology in general or overall general psychopa-
thology that could explain the associations between
childhood symptoms of ADHD and later BPD.50,51 Never-
theless, expanding the understanding of the association
between childhood symptoms of ADHD and later BPD is
important for potentially understanding how to reduce
suffering and impairments related to BPD.

In future studies, we suggest investigating if the associa-
tions between childhood symptoms and ADHD and partic-
ularly impulsivity and later BPD is more pronounced in
individuals with clinically ascertained ADHD compared
with those without to potentially understand if this group
should also be prioritized for neuropsychiatric evaluation.
Because of the limited number of individuals with BPD this

was not possible in our study. Further studies are needed
to elucidate if treatments specifically targeting impulsivity,
could reduce risks of later impairments related to BPD. In
children having problems sustaining attention, our results
indicate that assessing self-harm may be particularly
important but the associations between childhood ADHD
symptom subdimensions and self-harm, alcohol- and drug
use need to be further studied.
