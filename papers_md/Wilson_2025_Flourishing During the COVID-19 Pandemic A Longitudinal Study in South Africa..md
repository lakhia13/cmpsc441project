Abstract
In this longitudinal study, we examine changes in psychological distress and multidi-
mensional well-being from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic among South
African adults. As a secondary purpose, we explore whether pre-pandemic ﬂourishing
is protective against subsequent psychological distress during the public health crisis.
The analytic sample (n = 293; Mage = 44.27, SD = 14.28; female = 65.19%) completed
measures of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and well-being shortly before
the stringent nationwide lockdown started in South Africa (T1). A follow-up assess-
ment was completed approximately 6 months later (T2). Paired samples t-tests sup-
ported very small improvements in anxiety (d = (cid:1)0.09) and depression symptoms
(d = (cid:1)0.13). For domains of well-being, small increases were found in close social
relationships (d = 0.25) and ﬁnancial and material stability (d = 0.19). Positive changes in
the domains of character and virtue (d = 0.10) and meaning and purpose (d = 0.07)
were very small. Changes in physical and mental health (d = (cid:1)0.03) and life satisfaction
and happiness (d = 0.02) were more negligible. Results from the generalized linear
models indicated that continuous scores of secure ﬂourishing assessed before the
COVID-19 pandemic were associated with lower subsequent psychological distress
(particularly depression symptoms) during the public health crisis. We discuss the
implications of the ﬁndings for the development and delivery of interventions to
promote and sustain human ﬂourishing during public health crises, especially in
contexts of social-structural vulnerability.

Introduction

3

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December
2019 and rapidly became a global public health concern. Several countries instituted
public health measures to limit or control community transmission of SARS-CoV-2
(Counted et al., 2021; Shiba, Cowden, Gonzalez, et al., 2022). Shortly after the World
Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pan-
demic, the South African government implemented one of the most stringent national
lockdowns in the world (Counted et al., 2022; Govender et al., 2020). By the end of
March 2020, businesses were forced to close or shift their operations online, academic
programming at educational institutions was suspended, transportation and travel were
severely restricted, and all social gatherings were banned as part of the public health
measures that were implemented. Some measures were lifted after 10 weeks, but many
stringent measures remained in effect until October 2020. Although the stringent
national lockdown drastically altered the public and private lives of South Africans
(Govender et al., 2020), few rigorous studies have investigated the impacts of the
COVID-19 lockdown on different facets of well-being among the local population. In
the present study, we use prospective data from a sample of South African adults to
examine (1) changes in psychological distress and multidimensional well-being from
before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) the role of pre-pandemic ﬂourishing
in protecting against psychological distress during the public health crisis.

Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic upended many aspects of people’s lives (e.g., work, social
engagement, public religious/spiritual participation), leading to unprecedented re-
source loss that had the potential to disrupt different facets of well-being. Not sur-
prisingly, existing research — most of which has been conducted in the North America,
Europe, and Asia — suggests that the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in
psychological distress (e.g., elevated anxiety symptoms), lower psychological well-
being (e.g., loss of meaning in life), worse physical health (e.g., lower sleep quality),
ﬁnancial/material instability, social isolation and disconnectedness, and disruptions in
religious/spiritual life (Cowden et al., 2021; Daly et al., 2020; De Kock et al., 2022;
Grifﬁths et al., 2021; Jacobi et al., 2022; Philpot et al., 2021; Shiba, Cowden, Gonzalez,
et al., 2022; VanderWeele et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2020). However, not all evidence
corresponds with this picture of pandemic-related declines in well-being. For example,
one cross-sectional study of Australian adults found that most participants reported
being able to maintain overall well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic (up to
August/September 2020, when the study was conducted), although there was vari-
ability in the percentage of participants who reported sustained well-being in different
domains (Saikia et al., 2021). Similarly, a recent analysis of Gallup World Poll data
indicated that reported life evaluation and happiness in 2020 were largely comparable

4

Psychological Reports 0(0)

to the pooled average of 3 years (2017–2019) that preceded the COVID-19 pandemic
(Helliwell et al., 2021).

Other studies have reported evidence suggesting facets of well-being may have
improved relative to before the public health crisis. One cross-sectional study with a
sample of MTurk workers reported evidence of an increase in sense of relatedness
(i.e., feeling connected to signiﬁcant others) during the early part of the COVID-19
pandemic, and that enhanced indirect communication with family members and friends
through online technology was positively related to mental well-being (Cantarero et al.,
2021). A longitudinal study in the U.K. reported an increase in mental well-being
between March/April 2020 (O’Connor et al., 2021), when COVID-19 was declared a
global pandemic. Relatedly, Recchi et al.’s (2020) longitudinal study of French res-
idents found evidence of an increase in general health and subjective well-being from
before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, which the authors referred to as the ‘eye of
the hurricane’ paradox (i.e., those not directly affected by SARS-CoV-2 may have
viewed their physical health and subjective well-being in a more positive light than they
typically would).

Although there may be numerous reasons for the variation in ﬁndings across studies
(e.g., differences in sample characteristics, government interventions, public health
measures implemented, or local burden of COVID-19), one potentially important
distinction between many studies is the timing of assessments. After a period of
disruption that accompanied the acute and rapidly evolving initial phase of the COVID-
19 pandemic, with time people may have been able to adjust to their circumstances and
show improvements in their well-being. This theorizing resonates with conservation of
resources (COR) theory, which suggests that people are likely to gain resources over
time after experiencing resource loss (Hobfoll et al., 2018). The same principle can be
applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that those whom the public health crisis has
impacted might be able to regain or acquire, over time, the resources and skills needed
to manage the resource loss they have encountered (Cornell et al., 2021; Counted et al.,
2021). Some studies have provided evidence of this, with initial declines in indicators
of well-being (e.g., negative affect, anxiety symptoms) during the early part of the
COVID-19 pandemic gradually returning to pre-pandemic levels (Fancourt et al., 2021;
Foa et al., 2022). Considering these ﬁndings, studies that employ longer lags between
assessments of well-being from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic may ﬁnd that
changes in well-being are smaller compared to studies that use shorter lags because
people would have had more time to adjust to pandemic-related conditions. In such
instances, scores on assessments from before and during the public health crisis may be
more similar.

Well-being in South Africa during the COVID-19 Pandemic

Unlike people in more developed contexts who generally had greater access to social-
structural resources (e.g., high-quality health systems, economic impact payments) to
those in fragile social-structural
support

them during the COVID-19 pandemic,

contexts (e.g., South Africa) may not have been able to rely as heavily on resources
from their government to support their well-being as they navigated the public health
crisis (Counted et al., 2022; Govender et al., 2020). Moreover, different countries were
at various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and contextual conditions are likely to
inﬂuence region-speciﬁc well-being outcomes. Therefore, context-speciﬁc evidence is
needed to understand the unique impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being
of people living in different parts of the world, particularly in South Africa, where the
COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to magnify pervasive social-structural vul-
nerabilities (e.g., high unemployment, economic inequality) that existed before its
onset (Govender et al., 2020).

Several studies have reported on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
well-being of South Africans. Some studies have focused on indicators of material/
ﬁnancial well-being. For example, research has shown that employment in the country
declined by almost 20% between February and April 2020 (Casale & Posel, 2020).
There was a similar decrease in the percentage of adults who earned an income during
the stringent period of lockdown compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic
(Statistics South Africa, 2020). Along similar lines, Turok and Visagie (2021) used
nationally representative data to show that approximately 24% of peri-urban and
township dwellers lost paid employment in April 2020 (see also Daniels & Casale,
2022). Other studies have addressed mental health or indicators of psychological well-
being. For instance, one cross-sectional study of young adults revealed that 72% of
participants across all South African provinces met the criteria for depression during the
COVID-19 lockdown, which was signiﬁcantly higher (12% in 2017) compared to
before the public health crisis (Mudiriza & De Lannoy, 2020). Another cross-sectional
study of South African university employees found that almost 28% of participants
reported mild to severe psychological distress, with nearly 40% at risk of developing
mental health problems (van Niekerk & van Gent, 2021). Extending beyond self-report
survey data, one study of real-time Twitter data gathered during the ﬁrst half of
2020 showed a negative association between the overall stringency of COVID-19
lockdown regulations and happiness in South Africa (Greyling et al., 2021).

Taken together, the abovementioned ﬁndings demonstrate the impact that the
COVID-19 pandemic has had on the well-being of South Africans, but some important
gaps remain. First, a majority of studies have explored well-being at a single time point
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mudiriza & De Lannoy, 2020). Such cross-sectional
studies are generally unable to discern the temporal relation between the COVID-19
pandemic as a risk factor and well-being. Second, prior studies have typically focused
on one or a few facets of well-being (e.g., ﬁnancial/material security, anxiety symp-
toms), and a wider range of well-being outcomes is needed to paint a more complete
picture of how the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted individual well-being. In
one study, O’Connor et al. (2021) reported an increase in mental well-being, relative
stability in depression symptoms, and greater suicidal ideation, suggesting that the
impacts of the public health crisis may vary by facet of well-being. Therefore, if we are
to build a more holistic and robust understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has

6

affected the well-being of South Africans, longitudinal studies that track various in-
dicators of well-being over time are needed.

Can Flourishing Protect Against Psychological Distress During the COVID-19
Pandemic?
Although there is little research concerning the impact of self-reported ﬂourishing on
psychological distress amid the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence from related literature
(e.g., resilience) suggests that people with higher levels of ﬂourishing might experience
lower levels of psychological distress despite facing lockdown restrictions (Cowden
et al., 2022). Similar to the role that protective resources can play in promoting positive
adjustment following exposure to adversity (Davis et al., 2021; H¨oltge et al., 2021;
Wilson & Somhlaba, 2016), research involving some indicators of ﬂourishing suggests
it could serve as a resource that enables people to effectively cope with the stressors
arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, one cross-sectional study of
Austrian adults found that those who experienced social connectedness in the last week
of a 6-week lockdown reported lower levels of perceived stress, generalized anxiety,
and COVID-19-speciﬁc concerns (Nitschke et al., 2021). In another longitudinal study
involving South African adults, participants who retained their jobs (a proxy for
ﬁnancial/material security) had lower depression than those who lost employment
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Posel et al., 2021). These ﬁndings highlight the
potential for indicators of ﬂourishing (e.g., social relationships) to serve as resources
that can mitigate psychological distress. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that
people who reported higher levels of well-being across a range of domains before the
COVID-19 pandemic might experience lower psychological distress during the public
health crisis.

The Present Study

In the present study, we use prospective data from a sample of South African adults to
strengthen existing knowledge about the context-speciﬁc impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on human well-being and illuminate potential opportunities to promote post-
pandemic ﬂourishing in contexts of social-structural vulnerability. Building on prior
(predominantly cross-sectional) pandemic-related research that has explored the im-
plications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the well-being (mostly mental health and
ﬁnancial/material security) of South Africans, this is one of the ﬁrst longitudinal studies
to estimate changes in psychological distress and multidimensional well-being over
6 months from before to during the public health crisis among South Africans. We
expected to ﬁnd some evidence of elevated psychological distress and a decline in well-
being compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, although some variability was
anticipated across the outcomes. As a secondary objective, we explore the potential for
pre-pandemic ﬂourishing to protect against subsequent anxiety and depression
symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expected that higher levels of secure

ﬂourishing before the public health crisis would be associated with lower subsequent
psychological distress approximately 6 months later.

Method

Study Sample

This study used two waves of data from a longitudinal research project on forgiveness,
religion/spirituality, and well-being in South Africa (https://osf.io/r86ac/). Consumer
databases were used to recruit South African citizens through email and instant
messaging. Individuals who responded to an initial request for participation were
directed to a secure web-based platform and presented with further details about the
research. After providing electronic informed consent, participants completed an online
baseline survey at Time 1 (T1) that lasted approximately 45 minutes. Six months later,
all participants who completed T1 were re-contacted to request their participation in an
online follow-up survey at Time 2 (T2). All participants completed both surveys in
English. Institutional ethical approval to conduct this study was granted by the
University of the Free State (UFS-HSD2019/2259/0212) and the University of Pretoria
(T070/19).

Data collection at T1 followed a staggered enrolment process from December 5,
2019 to May 26, 2020, during which 590 participants completed the survey. Ap-
proximately 2 months of the T1 data collection period overlapped with the strict
national lockdown instituted in South Africa on March 27, 2020. This meant that a
portion of the participants (n = 78) did not complete T1 before the nationwide level ﬁve
lockdown began. Given the severe and stringent nature of the initial lockdown period in
South Africa (Counted et al., 2022; Govender et al., 2020), we attempted to minimize
the potential confound of the T1 participation date by making an a priori decision to
exclude from the current study those participants (n = 78) who completed T1 after
March 26, 2020. Therefore, the sample in this study was restricted to n = 512 par-
ticipants who completed T1 between December 5, 2019 and March 26, 2020.

Of the 512 participants who completed T1 before March 27, 2020, n = 219 (42.77%)
were lost to follow-up. We used independent samples t-tests and Chi-square tests of
independence to compare the baseline characteristics of participants who remained in
the cohort to those who were lost to follow-up (see Supplemental Table S1). Partic-
ipants who were older, identiﬁed racially as White, and resided within the province of
Gauteng had a higher likelihood of being retained over time (ps ≤ .021). No other
statistically signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed (ps > .05). Participants in the analytic
sample completed the T2 survey between May 27, 2020 and October 8, 2020, which
was an average of 6.00 months (SD = 0.68) after T1.

Sociodemographic characteristics of the analytic sample (n = 293) are reported in
Table 1. Participants included males (34.81%) and females (65.19%) ranging from
18 to 77 years of age (Mage = 44.27, SD = 14.28). Most participants resided in the
province of Gauteng (71.33%). A majority of the sample was White (55.29%), married

participants self-identiﬁed as Christian (93.86%).

Measures

Brief Symptom Inventory 18. The BSI 18 was used to measure psychological distress.
The 18-item instrument contains two subscales that assess self-reported symptoms of
anxiety (e.g., “Feeling tense or keyed up”) and depression (e.g., “Feeling hopeless
about the future”) experienced during the past 7 days (Derogatis, 2001). A ﬁve-point
response scale (0 = Not at all; 4 = Extremely) is used to rate each item. In this study,
participants completed all six items that form part of the depression subscale and ﬁve of
the six items that correspond with the anxiety subscale.1 We calculated anxiety and
depression symptom scores by averaging responses to the items on the respective
subscales.2

Secure Flourishing Index. The SFI contains 12 items and questions that collectively
provide a comprehensive measure of well-being (e.g., “In general, how happy or
unhappy do you usually feel?”) (VanderWeele, 2017). The ﬁrst 10 items are evenly
distributed across ﬁve underlying domains of ﬂourishing (i.e., life satisfaction and
happiness, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue,
close social relationships). The ﬁnal two items address the domain of ﬁnancial and
material stability, which is considered necessary for sustaining well-being over time
(H¨oltge et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). Items are rated on an 11-point response scale from
0 to 10, with orienting labels presented alongside anchor points at each end of the scale.
Scores for each of the six domains were calculated by averaging responses to each of
the respective two items. A secure ﬂourishing score was obtained by averaging re-
sponses to all 12 SFI items.

Changes in Psychological Distress and Well-being. Paired samples t-tests were performed
to assess changes in anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and domains of well-
being from before the nationwide COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in South Africa to
6 months later. Although reporting practices and recommendations for interpreting
effect sizes vary considerably, we report Cohen’s d and describe changes over time
using Funder and Ozer’s (2019) benchmarks of very small (0.10), small (0.20), medium
(0.41), large (0.63), and very large (0.87). We supplemented the analyses involving
domains of well-being with descriptive statistics for the 12 individual items and a
secure ﬂourishing score.

In sensitivity analyses, we replicated both sets of the above analyses with the
subsample of participants who completed T1 before the South African government
declared COVID-19 a national disaster on March 15, 2020. We also used generalized
linear modeling to test for mean differences in anxiety symptoms, depression
symptoms, and domains of well-being among the full analytic sample from T1 to T2,
after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics of age (continuous), gender (fe-
male, male), racial status (White, Black, other race), marital status (single, married or in
a committed relationship), religious status (not religious, religious), education level
(high school or less, postsecondary school education), and geographic location
(Gauteng province, other province) assessed at T1, and then replicated the model with
additional adjustment for T2 date of participation.

Associations of Secure Flourishing with Subsequent Psychological Distress. Two generalized
linear models were used to estimate the effects of secure ﬂourishing assessed before the
nationwide level ﬁve lockdown on subsequent anxiety and depression symptoms
assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic (one outcome at a time). In the ﬁrst model,
the exposure was a continuous score of secure ﬂourishing based on the average of all
12 ﬂourishing items assessed at T1. The exposure for the second model was a count
variable of secure ﬂourishing that reﬂected the number of well-being domains (from
0 to 6) on which participants scored above the 50th percentile at T1. Both models
adjusted for age, gender, racial status, marital status, religious status, education level,
geographic location, and prior values of both anxiety and depression symptoms as-
sessed at T1.

We performed a sensitivity analysis that involved replicating both multilevel models
among participants who completed T1 before the South African government declared
COVID-19 a national disaster on March 15, 2020. We also computed E-values to assess
the robustness of the associations between secure ﬂourishing and subsequent anxiety
and depression symptoms in the full analytic sample to potential unmeasured con-
founding (VanderWeele & Ding, 2017). E-values estimate the minimum strength of
association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have (on the risk ratio scale)
with both the exposure and the outcome to explain away the exposure-outcome

Wilson Fadiji et al.

11

association. The lowest possible E-value is one, in which case no unmeasured con-
founding would be needed to explain away the effect estimate.

Results

Changes in Psychological Distress and Well-being

For the primary analysis, descriptive statistics for anxiety symptoms, depression
symptoms, and domains of well-being assessed before the nationwide level ﬁve
lockdown and during the COVID-19 pandemic are reported in Table 2. We found very
small declines in symptoms of anxiety (d = (cid:1)0.09, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.20, 0.01) and de-
pression (d = (cid:1)0.13, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.24, (cid:1)0.02). Evaluating changes in domains of well-
being, small increases were found in close social relationships (d = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.14,
0.36) and ﬁnancial and material stability (d = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.29). Positive
changes in character and virtue (d = 0.10, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.01, 0.21) and meaning and
purpose (d = 0.07, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.02, 0.16) were very small. Changes in physical and
mental health (d = (cid:1)0.03, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.12, 0.06) and life satisfaction and happiness (d =
0.02, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.09, 0.12) were more negligible. Changes in individual components of
well-being over time were comparable to those found for the domains (see Table 3),
with the largest (though small) effects found for the items in the close social rela-
tionships domain.

similar after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and additionally for T2 date

both the domains (Table S3) and components of well-being (Table S4) were consistent
with those found in the full analytic sample.

Associations of Secure Flourishing with Subsequent Psychological Distress
Estimated effects of secure ﬂourishing assessed before the nationwide level ﬁve lockdown
on anxiety and depression symptoms assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic are
presented in Table 4. Continuous scores of secure ﬂourishing were associated with lower
subsequent depression symptoms (β = (cid:1)0.17, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.28, (cid:1)0.06), corresponding with
a medium effect. A slightly smaller effect size was found for the association between
continuous scores of secure ﬂourishing and lower subsequent anxiety symptoms
(β = (cid:1)0.09, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.20, 0.02). Effect sizes for both anxiety (β = (cid:1)0.13, 95%
CI: (cid:1)0.23, (cid:1)0.02) and depression symptoms (β = (cid:1)0.18, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.29, (cid:1)0.08)
strengthened marginally when secure ﬂourishing was modeled as a continuous
index representing the number of well-being domains on which participants
scored above the 50th percentile.

Psychological Reports 0(0)

The E-values for each regression model indicated that the estimated effects of secure
ﬂourishing on subsequent anxiety and depression symptoms were modestly robust to
potential unmeasured confounding (Table 4). For example, an unmeasured confounder
would need to be associated with both secure ﬂourishing (modeled as a continuous
score reﬂecting the average of all 12 items) and depression symptoms by risk ratios of
1.60, above and beyond all the adjusted covariates, to explain away the observed
association. Similarly, an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with
both secure ﬂourishing (modeled as a continuous score reﬂecting the average of all
12 items) and depression symptoms by risk ratios of 1.29 to shift the conﬁdence interval
to include the null, but weaker confounding could not. E-value estimates were generally
smaller for anxiety symptoms than for depression symptoms.

In the sensitivity analysis that focused on the subset of participants who completed
T1 before the South African government declared COVID-19 a national disaster on
March 15, 2020, negative associations of secure ﬂourishing (both as a continuous score
and a continuous index representing the number of domains on which participants
scored above the 50th percentile) with subsequent anxiety and depression symptoms
were somewhat larger compared to those found in the full analytic sample (Table S5).

Discussion

This two-wave longitudinal study examined psychological distress and multidimensional
well-being among a sample of South African adults over 6 months from before to during
the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed two key ﬁndings. First, we found evidence of
improvements in some of the psychological distress and well-being outcomes from
before the stringent nationwide level ﬁve COVID-19 pandemic lockdown was im-
plemented to during the public health crisis. Second, secure ﬂourishing reported prior to
the national lockdown was associated with a decline in subsequent depression symptoms
(and to a lesser extent anxiety symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our ﬁndings supported modest improvements in anxiety symptoms, depression
symptoms, and several domains of well-being compared to before the public health crisis,
with the largest (though small) changes found for the well-being domains of close social
relationships and ﬁnancial and material stability. Although a number of previous studies
have reported evidence of greater psychological distress (e.g., Xiong et al., 2020) and
lower well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., VanderWeele et al., 2021), one
potential explanation for our ﬁndings is the timing of the follow-up assessments.
Speciﬁcally, participants in our analytic sample completed the T2 survey between the end
of May and early October 2020 (between two and 7 months after the start of the level ﬁve
nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa). By this stage of the public health
crisis, many individuals might have managed to adjust psychologically to pandemic-
related conditions and demonstrate evidence of recovery in well-being (Shiba, Cowden,
Counted, et al., 2022). Indeed, prior research has documented evidence suggesting that
people were generally able to adapt to pandemic-related circumstances over a relatively
short period of time (Fancourt et al., 2021; Foa et al., 2022).

However, evidence of improvements in psychological distress and some domains of
well-being from before the COVID-19 pandemic indicates the picture may be more
complex than a mere return to homeostasis over time. According to the COR theory
(Hobfoll, 2010; Holmgreen et al., 2017), people are motivated to foster the acquisition
of resources (e.g., housing, employment, social support). When the nationwide level
ﬁve lockdown was ﬁrst instituted in South Africa, people encountered different forms
of resource loss (e.g., reduction in income) or were restricted from accessing valued
resources (e.g., places of signiﬁcance) in broader environment (Counted et al., 2021;
Cowden et al., 2022). Hence, many individuals were forced to acquire and draw on
alternative resources to support their well-being. During the period of T2 data collection
in this study, the South African government incrementally adjusted the national
lockdown from level ﬁve (in place until April 30, 2020) down to level one (beginning
on September 21, 2020), enabling people to regain valued resources that they were
restricted from accessing after the stringent level ﬁve lockdown was implemented. As a
result, people may have beneﬁtted both from pre-pandemic resources that became more
readily available again once the lockdown had eased and newly acquired resources that
materialized in the process of adapting to pandemic-related conditions (Cowden et al.,
in press).

The pattern of ﬁndings observed in this study may also reﬂect the socioeconomic
standing of the participants in our study. Although the COVID-19 pandemic signif-
icantly disrupted the lives of South Africans as a whole, research suggests that in-
dividuals with lower levels education were at increased risk of becoming unemployed
during the public health crisis because they were less likely to be employed in jobs that
could be performed remotely once the nationwide lockdown was instituted in South
Africa (Daniels & Casale, 2022; Turok & Visagie, 2021). Almost 60% of the par-
ticipants in our analytic sample had completed a university degree, which is signiﬁ-
cantly higher than the average education level of the broader population of adults in
South Africa (Ranchhod & Daniels, 2021). Therefore, it is possible that participants in
our sample were more likely than the average South African to be employed in roles
that could readily be performed remotely after the COVID-19 lockdown came into
effect. Although the depth of our interpretation is limited by the data that were collected
in this study, we speculate that working from home may have presented many par-
ticipants with novel opportunities to strengthen facets of well-being during the public
health crisis (e.g., being able to spend more quality time with signiﬁcant others). For
some individuals, the beneﬁts of being able to work remotely during the COVID-19
pandemic (e.g., greater job security, lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection) hypothet-
ically could have precipitated more favorable self-evaluations relative to others who
weren’t teleworking, which may have contributed to improvements in psychological
distress and some domains of well-being compared to before the public health crisis
(Maier et al., 2022). However, this theorizing requires further research.

In our secondary analysis that estimated the effects of pre-pandemic ﬂourishing on
anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that
higher secure ﬂourishing before the nationwide lockdown in South Africa was

16

Psychological Reports 0(0)

associated with a moderate decline in subsequent depression symptoms and a small
decline in subsequent anxiety symptoms during the public health crisis. This pattern of
ﬁndings points to the protective capacity of ﬂourishing as a stress-buffering mechanism
that may reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress. Our
ﬁndings align with the broader pandemic-related literature on resilience-promoting
protective factors (e.g., close signiﬁcant others, spirituality, meaning) that have been
found to support positive adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic (Blanc et al.,
2021; Giordano et al., 2022). By illuminating the protective potential of secure
ﬂourishing against subsequent psychological distress during this public health disaster,
the ﬁndings of our study introduce the possibility that interventions aimed at promoting
ﬂourishing before disasters could support post-disaster adjustment after they have
occurred. Further research is needed to identify the protective capacity of pre-disaster
ﬂourishing in other populations and contexts, both during this public health crisis and
future disasters.

Practical Implications
Although this study’s ﬁndings were generally consistent with improvements in psy-
chological distress and well-being over time, we found some evidence of variation in
the extent of change across the domains of well-being. For example, there was a small
increase in close social relationships but a negligible change in life satisfaction and
happiness. Our ﬁndings suggest that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
domains of well-being may have been somewhat heterogenous, highlighting the
importance of assessing and tracking multidimensional well-being during a public
health crisis (and other disasters). Monitoring multiple domains of well-being over time
could be of considerable value to healthcare professionals who provide services to
support individual well-being and policymakers who seek to make informed decisions
about strategies that could effectively promote population well-being. South Africa’s
post-pandemic recovery journey will likely beneﬁt from ongoing research that tracks
multidimensional well-being at the national level.

The current study also found evidence of pre-pandemic ﬂourishing serving as a
buffer against the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological
distress (particularly depression symptoms), suggesting that pre-disaster ﬂourishing
may play a protective role in reducing psychological distress during disasters.
Therefore, it may be important for policies and public health initiatives in South Africa
(and other contexts of social-structural vulnerability) to address well-being more
holistically by focusing on the promotion of ‘complete’ well-being. If resources are
more limited (as is often the case in developing countries), decisions will need to be
made about which domains of well-being ought to be given top priority. A systems
perspective of ﬂourishing could provide a useful lens for guiding such decisions, which
considers the dynamic interplay between the components that comprise ﬂourishing. For
example, evidence from a recent cross-cultural network analysis of ﬂourishing (H¨oltge
et al., 2022) suggests that when intervention opportunities are limited by resource

Wilson Fadiji et al.

17

constraints, attempts to promote ﬂourishing ought to focus on the domain/s of well-
being that have the most and strongest positive relations with other domains. According
to H¨oltge et al. (2022), one domain of well-being that evidenced more consistent and
stronger associations with other domains across many countries was meaning and
purpose, indicating that this domain may be a suitable target for promoting ﬂourishing
in resource-limited settings. However, interrelations between domains of well-being
varied to some extent by country. Therefore, any efforts to cultivate ﬂourishing in South
Africa must be sensitive to contextual particularities (e.g., culture, structural issues) that
might inﬂuence pathways to ﬂourishing and could impact the effectiveness of inter-
ventions and other initiatives aimed at supporting the well-being of the local
population.

Limitations

Although this study makes a useful contribution to the existing body of empirical
literature on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for people living in contexts
of social-structural vulnerability, there are several limitations. First, the rate of attrition
was more than 40%, which can introduce selection bias if retained participants differ
systematically from those who did not complete both T1 and T2 surveys. Descriptive
analyses revealed some differences (e.g., age, racial status) between the characteristics
of individuals who participated in both waves and those who dropped out, pointing to
the possibility that measured (or unmeasured) factors could have biased the results.
Second, our analytic sample was not representative of the South African population, as
a majority of the participants were White, middle-aged, and college educated.
Therefore, caution should be applied in generalizing our ﬁndings to the broader adult
population of South Africans, and additional research is needed to explore whether this
study’s ﬁndings are transportable to other populations and contexts in Africa. Third, our
ﬁndings are based on self-report measures, which may be subject to measurement error.
Fourth, although E-values suggested that the associations we observed for our sec-
ondary analysis were at least moderately robust to unmeasured confounding, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility that the associations of pre-pandemic ﬂourishing
with subsequent anxiety and depression symptoms may be biased due to potential
unmeasured confounders (e.g., personality traits, physical activity).

Conclusion

The present study used two waves of longitudinal data from a sample of South
African adults to examine changes in psychological distress and multidimensional
well-being from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to estimate the
effect of pre-pandemic ﬂourishing on reducing subsequent psychological distress
during the public health crisis. The ﬁndings provided evidence supporting modest
improvements in psychological distress and some domains of well-being from before
to during the COVID-19 pandemic, with larger (though small) improvements found

18

for the well-being domains of ﬁnancial and material stability and close social re-
lationships. We also found that higher levels of pre-pandemic ﬂourishing were as-
sociated with moderately lower subsequent depression symptoms (and to a lesser
extent anxiety symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, our ﬁndings
extend the existing empirical literature on the implications of the COVID-19 pan-
demic for individual well-being among non-Western populations living in contexts of
social-structural vulnerability, and highlight the potential for ﬂourishing to serve as a
resource that can protect against psychological stress during disasters.
