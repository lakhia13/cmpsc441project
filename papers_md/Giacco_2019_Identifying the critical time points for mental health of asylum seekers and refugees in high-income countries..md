Abstract

Aims. High heterogeneity was found in the prevalence rates of mental disorders in adult asy-
lum seekers and refugees in high-income countries. This may be related to different problems.
Among them, there is a changing exposure to risk and protective factors for mental health at
different phases of these people’s life before migration, and during the migratory journey and
resettlement. This study aimed at identifying and distinguishing time points in which distinct
risk and protective factors for the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees may occur.
Methods. Systematic review and narrative synthesis. A systematic search was carried out
for the period January 2017–August 2019, given the existence of systematic reviews of the
evidence up to January 2017.
Results. Two hundred and fifty-two studies were identified with our search and 31 studies
were included. The critical time points identified are: (a) before the travel; (b) during the tra-
vel; (c) at initial settlement in the host country; (d) when attempting to integrate in the host
country; (e) when the immigration status is challenged or revoked. Some factors such as sense
of belonging in the host country can be risk factors or protective factors depending on the
time point.
Conclusions. These five critical time points can guide the development and selection of
well-timed preventive and treatment interventions. They could also be used to stratify samples
in epidemiological studies and meta-analyses. At present, we know much more on risk factors
than on protective factors. Knowing more about protective factors may inform the develop-
ment of interventions to foster them.

Introduction

The recent refugee crisis and migratory waves have been the focus of much political attention
in high-income countries (Gianfreda, 2018). A major area of debate has been how to address
the health needs of the high numbers of new individuals coming into a country in a short
timeframe (Priebe et al., 2016).

Refugees’ mental health needs have been a particular concern. Specifically, the factors
i.e. exposure to political persecution and war

which may lead to refugees’ migration,
(UNHCR, 2019) can also predispose them to mental disorders (WHO, 2018).

This gave impetus to the research in this field and a number of studies have assessed pre-
valence rates in different groups of asylum seekers and refugees and for different mental
disorders (e.g. Priebe et al., 2016; Turrini et al., 2017; Giacco et al., 2018).

However, when assessing prevalence rates of mental disorders in these groups, a number of
problems may arise, which are reflected by a high heterogeneity in prevalence rates across
studies (Priebe et al., 2016; Giacco and Priebe, 2018; Giacco et al., 2018). These problems
are usually summarised as follows:

(a) There are pragmatic challenges in carrying out epidemiological studies in these groups,
lack of validity of research tools across different cultures
such as language barriers,
(Lewis-Fernandez and Aggarwal, 2013; Brisset et al., 2014; Giacco et al., 2014) and diffi-
culties in accessing some individuals or groups (Enticott et al., 2017); these challenges may
lead to bias within studies and methodological artefacts;

(b) There are differences among individuals and groups of asylum seekers and refugees based
on different personal backgrounds, as well as differing social situations in home countries
and host countries (Priebe et al., 2016; Giacco et al., 2018).

The challenges in achieving representative samples can be overcome to some extent by tech-
nical safeguards such as using well-trained interpreters or same language interviewers, adopt-
ing culturally validated instruments and using carefully designed sampling techniques.

The individual or group differences across asylum seekers and
refugees are, instead, true, not influenced by methodology, and, as
such, generate unavoidable heterogeneity across studies.

However,

there is a third type of problems, which have
received less attention from the epidemiological research so far.
The statuses of asylum seekers and refugees are determined by
legal frameworks and procedures and are transitory in nature.
They do not identify stable categories, with which rates of mental
disorders can be reliably associated.

These changing statuses can be summarised as follows. All
refugees are initially classed as asylum seekers (UNHCR, 2019).
The process of obtaining asylum and refugee status can last a
long time. During this time, they have the right to remain in
the host country but are uncertain as to whether their application
will be approved. If the asylum application is not approved, they
can leave that country (and move to another country), appeal or
become irregular migrants. The refugee status can also be revoked
(‘cessation of their refugee status’) (Kapferer, 2003) once a host
country court rules that the causes of political persecution or
lack of safety (e.g. wars, political regimes, etc.) have ceased in
the refugees’ home countries.

So far, refugees, asylum seekers and people who do not have a
recognised immigration status in a new country have usually been
pooled together in research studies and meta-analyses. This may
lead us to ignore differences in stressors which may have a consid-
erable impact on a person’s mental health.

The usual stratification of risk factors for mental health is
based on a simplified framework in which refugees encounter
pre-, peri- and post-migration factors (Priebe et al., 2016;
Giacco et al., 2018). This has not influenced sampling for epi-
demiological studies as these studies are usually carried out in
the host countries (i.e. post-migration).

Aims

This study aimed to carry out a systematic review of the evidence
on risk and protective factors for the mental health of asylum see-
kers, refugees and in general of people who have been forcibly dis-
placed from their countries. We then sought to classify these
factors according to different stages in the life before migration,
migration journey and resettlement of these people, with a par-
ticular attention to the increasing evidence on post-migration fac-
tors (Priebe et al., 2016; Miller and Rasmussen, 2017).

Methods

Design

This study is a systematic review with a narrative synthesis of the
findings.

Previous literature reviews appraised the evidence on risk and
protective factors for refugees’ and asylum seekers’ mental health
until January 2017 (Priebe et al., 2016; Giacco et al., 2018).

A systematic search of the evidence was carried out from
January 2017 to August 2019 in order to provide the most
updated findings. It used similar inclusion criteria but a simplified
search strategy and did not include grey literature. This is because
our previous reviews were also interested in identifying interven-
tions and good practices, which are often found in other types of
documents and sources. The current study, instead, was specific-
ally focused on risk and protective factors for mental health, for
which we are aware that an adequate amount of evidence is

available in the scientific peer-reviewed literature. Focusing on
peer-reviewed literature also ensured that sufficient quality stan-
dards were adhered to by all included papers.

Paper identification and selection
The search words used were the following: (‘refugee’ OR ‘asylum
seeker’ OR ‘irregular migrant’ OR ‘undocumented migrant’) AND
(‘mental health’) AND (‘risk factors’ OR ‘correlates’). EMBASE,
PsychINFO and OVID Medline databases were searched.

Papers were included if: (a) at least 50% of the research parti-
cipants were refugees and/or asylum seekers; (b) they assessed risk
or protective factors for mental disorders; (c) they focused on
adult populations (18 or older years of age); (d) they reported
on studies carried out in high-income countries (according to
the World Bank Classification); (e) they reported on primary
research or were literature reviews, excluding opinion pieces; (f)
they were published in full articles or full reports in scientific jour-
nals, excluding grey literature and conference presentations.

Papers were excluded if they focused only on aspects other
than risk and protective factors for mental disorders, e.g. inter-
ventions, prevalence rates without correlates, individuals’ experi-
ence of care or barriers to access care. Qualitative studies which
described patients’ or clinicians’ views about which were potential
risks or potential factors for mental health were also excluded.
They were deemed as ‘non-focusing on risk and protective factors
for mental health’ given that they failed to demonstrate the actual
association of those factors with mental health, only suggesting
that this may be.

Procedures and analysis

From each paper identified, risk and protective factors were cap-
tured and summarised in an excel extraction table.

The risk and protective factors identified from different studies
were initially grouped together according to when they occurred,
based on the usual framework (pre-, peri- and post-migration).
The analysis then continued with the aim of re-grouping risk
and protective factors in more specific and discrete time points
which generated the final time points described in the Results
section.

Results
Our search identified 252 papers in the period January 2017–
August 2019. After removal of duplicates and screening according
to inclusion criteria, 31 papers were included,
i.e. 28 papers
reporting on primary research and three literature reviews.

The PRISMA diagram can be found in Fig. 1.
The main characteristics of the included studies are synthe-

sised in Table 1.

Five time points were identified, in which all the risk and pro-
tective factors identified can be categorised. These time points are:
(a) before travel; (b) during travel; (c) initial settlement in the host
country; (d) integration in the host country; (e) challenges to or
revocation of the immigration status.

A summary of risk and protective factors at all of these time

points can be found in Fig. 2.

These different time points can all be experienced by indivi-
duals who are forced to migrate from their countries. However,
this is not necessarily the case for all of these individuals. For
them may have their asylum applications

rejected and never reach the status of a refugee. Others may inte-
grate successfully and, hence, remain in the host country as nat-
uralised citizens without their residence status being challenged.

Before travel

Exposure to potentially traumatic events (Chen et al., 2017a;
Myhrvold and Småstuen, 2017; Giacco et al., 2018; Hynie, 2018;
Kartal et al., 2018; Park et al., 2018), violent events witnessed or

experienced (Ben Fahrat et al., 2018; Kaltenbach et al., 2018,
Schweitzer et al., 2018; Rees et al., 2019) and particularly being
subjected to torture (Nickerson et al., 2017; Le et al., 2018;
Song et al., 2018) have all been linked to high likelihood of devel-
oping post-traumatic stress disorder and other forms of psycho-
logical distress. This is more likely if the experience of torture is
accompanied by intense emotions of anger, fear and perceived
uncontrollability (Le et al., 2018). The risk of developing a mental
disorder also increases if a person is exposed to multiple potentially

Risk factors: low social support, minority
ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, lack of
proficiency in host country language and
refugee/asylum-seeking status

Risk factors: affiliative feelings towards the
home country. Perceived discrimination among
men, but not women

Protective factors: a sense of belonging to host
country. Bridging social networks, particularly
for women

Risk factor: violent events before, during and
post-migration. Uncertainty about asylum
application

Risk factors: both pre-migration potentially
traumatic events and post-migration stressors
were positively associated with PTSD and severe
mental illness. Loneliness and the number of
social integration stressors increased the risk of
mental health problems particularly if there
were pre-migration traumatic events

Protective factors: less financial hardship
(economic integration dimension), better
English proficiency and self-sufficiency
(acculturation dimension), having the capacity
to communicate with locals, having friends from
different ethnic/religious groups and attending a
place of worship weekly or more often (social
capital dimension) and feeling welcomed and
having a strong sense of belonging in the host
country (self-identity dimension)

Risk factors: experiencing abuse, pain
post-birth, worried about family members left
behind, had food insecurity and had reduced
access to healthcare

Protective factors: higher levels of social support
and feeling they belonged to a community

Risk factors: downward mobility in subjectively
perceived social status is associated with
depression

Protective factors: ethnic density effect.
Refugees living in clusters tend to have less use
of mental healthcare services (proxy for mental
health problems)

Risk factors: exposure to violence and trauma,
particularly repeated exposures and extreme
violence such as torture, an increased length of
displacement

Risk factors: long asylum-decision waiting
periods were associated with an increased risk
of psychiatric disorders

Risk factors: a higher number of traumatic
experiences was related to a greater intensity of
PTSD symptoms. In addition, post-migrational
stressors were associated with a worsening of
PTSD symptoms over the course of the year.
Emotional distress was associated with current
negative life events, unemployment and
frequent visits to physicians

Risk factors: exposure to trauma and
acculturative stress mediating the effect of
traumatic exposure

traumatic events and/or if post-migration adversities occur in add-
ition to traumatic events before migration (Chen et al., 2017a; Lee
et al., 2017; Nickerson et al., 2017; Tinghög et al., 2017; Giacco
et al., 2018; Kartal et al., 2018; Nosè et al., 2018; Sangalang et al.,
2018; Schweitzer et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018).

As well as traumatic events, exposure to economic hardship
and social deprivation in home countries and a history of mental
health problems before migration can predict mental disorders
after settlement in host countries (Anderson et al., 2017; Giacco
and Priebe, 2018).

On the other hand, having experienced good financial condi-
tions and having attained a higher level of education in the home
country are associated with reduced rates of mental disorders after
migration (Lee et al., 2017; WHO, 2018).

Some studies have found that female gender is associated with
a higher likelihood of presenting clinically significant mental
health symptoms in asylum seekers and refugees (Poole et al.,
2018; Song et al., 2018; Mulugeta et al., 2019). However, most
studies did not identify differences across genders (see Table 1).

During travel

Refugees travel through dangerous land routes or via sea and can
be exposed to violent events or abuse during their journey.
Exposure to violent events during migration (Ben Fahrat et al.,
2018; Poole et al., 2018) and to human trafficking (Ottosova
et al., 2016; WHO, 2018) have been linked with poor mental
health after resettlement. Separation from family members as

Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences

part of the migration or during the migration (Miller et al., 2018)
also has been found to have negative consequences on mental
health.

There are no studies which have explored protective factors
during migration. However, it is likely that travelling through
less dangerous or more direct routes and having the support of
family members or trusted friends during the travel is associated
with less stress and impact on mental health.

Settlement in a host country

The risk factors encountered in the first period after settlement in
a host country are related to food insecurity, lack of accommoda-
tion (Dennis et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018) and dissatisfaction
with accommodation, particularly in refugee camps
(Poole
et al., 2018). A longer duration of the asylum seeking process
and lack of information can generate prolonged stress and uncer-
tainty which was found to be associated with clinically relevant
psychological symptoms (Ben Fahrat et al., 2018; Poole et al.,
2018).

Better conditions of settlement, access to health care (Dennis
et al., 2017) and a prompter and/or smoother process for obtain-
ing a residence status can have a positive impact on the mental
health of refugees (Müller et al., 2018; Kashyap et al., 2019).
The uncertainty related to asylum decisions is a factor which
has been found to be consistently associated with poor mental
health in a number of studies (Ben Fahrat et al., 2018; Leiler
et al., 2019; Hvidtfeldt et al., 2019).

Integration in a host country

Prevalence studies show higher rates of mental disorders (particu-
larly anxiety and depressive disorders) in long-term resettled refu-
gees (at least 5 years) than in those at first resettlement (Bogic
et al., 2015). Recent studies have also shown that an increased
length of displacement can be associated with an increased likeli-
hood of experiencing mental disorders (Hynie, 2018; Nosé et al.,
2018; Mulugeta et al., 2019).

al.,

2018;

2018),

During the process of integration in the host country, risk fac-
tors for mental health can be social isolation (Anderson et al.,
2017; Beiser and Hou, 2017; Chen et al., 2017a; Lee et al., 2017;
Hynie,
et
unemployment
(Kaltenbach et al., 2018), discrimination and victimisation
(Sangalang et al., 2018), struggles related to their cultural identity
and acculturation issues (Chen et al., 2017b; Lee et al., 2017) and
downward social mobility (Euteneuer and Schafer, 2018).

Schweitzer

from different

including people

A protective factor for mental health is having ‘bridging social
networks’ (Chen et al., 2017b; Beiser and Hou, 2017), i.e. social
networks
ethnic groups.
Developing a sense of belonging in the host country was also
found to be associated with reduced likelihood of mental disor-
ders (Chen et al., 2017b; Myhrvold and Småusten, 2017; Beiser
and Hou, 2017) and so were positive changes in post-migration
living arrangements (Shick et al., 2018). In particular, achieving
a visa or resident status was associated with better response to
treatment (Schick et al., 2018). Findings also suggest that refugees
living in areas where there is a high number of people from their
own ethnic group, i.e. a high ‘ethnic density’ may be less likely to
use mental health services and hence less likely to present severe
mental health needs (Finnvold and Ugreninov, 2018). In accord-
ance with this, a larger household size was found to be a protect-
ive factor for mental health (Yang and Mutchler, 2019).

Immigration status challenged or revoked

At this time point, threats of deportation, detention in immigra-
tion centres and losing jobs or accommodation are recognised risk
factors for psychological distress and diagnosable mental disor-
ders (Priebe et al., 2016; Kashyap et al., 2019). A sense of belong-
ing in the host country, which is a protective factor during
integration, can become a risk factor if the immigration status is
challenged (Lee et al., 2017).

No studies have assessed protective factors when immigration
status is challenged or revoked. It might be expected that a sense
of being safe in the home country, having a family or a social net-
work there and maintaining a strong sense of belonging to the
home country may be protective against psychological distress
(whilst ‘affiliative feelings towards the home country’ can be a
risk factor for mental health during the process of integration
in the host country, as found in Beiser and Hou, 2017).

Discussion

Main findings

This review has identified five time points at different stages of the
migration process of asylum seekers and refugees in which differ-
ent risk and protective factors may occur. The time points iden-
tified go beyond the usual and simplified distinction of
pre-migration, peri-migration and post-migration risk factors
and constitute a more comprehensive categorisation.

Implications

The risk and protective factors identified have all been variably
described in previous studies (Lindencrona et al., 2008; Steel
et al., 2009; Bogic et al., 2012; Bogic et al., 2015). This study
adds a novel categorisation with five distinct time points in
which risk and protective factors can be encountered by refugees
after migration. Despite the increased complexity of this categor-
isation, it may have a number of advantages as a framework for
research, psychosocial assessment and selection of interventions.
First, this more comprehensive categorisation may help in
interpreting the heterogeneity of prevalence studies (Bogic et al.,
2015; WHO, 2018). It can provide a useful way of stratifying
research participants in more homogeneous groups with regards
to risk and protective factors for their mental health, and these
groups may show more similar prevalence rates of mental
disorders.

Second, the risk and protective factors identified can be a target
of interventions aiming to address or foster them in prevention and
time
treatment programmes specifically provided at different
points.

Third, it is important to observe that some factors may act as
either risk or protective factors depending on the different time
points. For example, sense of belonging in the host country is a
protective
factor during integration (Chen et al., 2017b;
Myhrvold and Småusten, 2017; Beiser and Hou, 2017), but a
risk factor in case of immigration status being challenged or
revoked (Geraci (2011) and Lee et al., 2017). Similarly, affiliative
feelings towards the home country can be a source of anxiety dur-
ing migration, settlement or integration in the host country
(Beiser and Hou, 2017), but are likely to represent a protective fac-
tor in case of the possibility of repatriation. Interventions and psy-
chosocial assessments should take the variation in the role of
these factors into account.

Finally, decision making about the type of interventions to
prevent or alleviate psychological distress can be informed by
the critical time points identified. Addressing basic needs and
accommodation problems may be more important and effective
during the first resettlement than embarking in complex psycho-
logical or pharmacological interventions. If the immigration status
is challenged or revoked, supportive interventions to understand
and address concerns and fears about repatriation or to help peo-
ple plan their return may be provided, particularly if deportation
is inevitable (Geraci, 2011). Standard psychiatric interventions
may not address these specific concerns and be ineffective, if
such fears are a core reason for anxiety or disturbances in mood.

Limitations

The following limitations need to be acknowledged:

(a) our findings are based on an appraisal of research studies.
These studies may not have been able to reach people who
face barriers to access mental health services or research
teams (Enticott et al., 2017);

(b) the effect of risk and protective factors on rates of mental dis-
orders were not analysed quantitatively using a meta-analysis.
Hence we are unable to speculate on which of them has the
highest effect on mental health and should be prioritised.
However, a meta-analysis of individual risk factors was carried
out previously, reporting high heterogeneity and variable
methodological quality of the included studies (Steel et al.,
2009). In this study, the aim was to identify when risk and pro-
tective factors are likely to occur and this can also be of
importance for planning treatments and prevention strategies.
(c) a general consideration of risk factors, pooling all mental dis-
orders together, is likely to emphasise risk factors for the most
frequently diagnosed disorders (e.g. anxiety and depressive dis-
orders) with less of a focus on the factors associated to disor-
ders with comparatively lower prevalence rates (e.g. psychotic
disorders, somatisation disorders, etc.) (Giacco et al., 2018).
(d) low- and middle-income countries were excluded because it
was felt that examining the risk and protective factors for
mental health in these countries would justify a specific
review study. There is an increasing amount of studies explor-
ing the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees in low-
and middle-income countries. Twenty-three papers have
been written in this area in the last two and a half years
and had to be excluded from this review (see Fig. 2).
Moreover, in low- and middle-income countries, additional
factors might intervene which may complicate the categorisa-
tion proposed. A particular issue is that some of these coun-
tries can be deemed as ‘transit countries’. Migrants expect to
only spend some time in transit countries in preparation of
reaching the planned final destinations. Recent studies have
found high rates of mental disorders in transit countries
(Arsenijevic et al., 2017; Vukčević Marković et al., 2017;
WHO, 2018) and specific studies are required to understand
in detail why this is. Moreover, a difficult financial situation
in the host country might make the process of integration of
refugees even more difficult and challenging.

Suggestions for future research

There are a number of unresolved questions in this area, which
may be addressed by future research.

All refugees, by definition, have been exposed to stressful
events such as political persecution, war and/or torture (UNHCR,
2019). Yet, many of them will not present with diagnosable mental
disorders. Future studies should focus on understanding how these
individuals are able to show such resilience and use the mechan-
isms and factors underlying resilience to inform interventions.

With regard to high-income countries, there is a need to better
understand the potential selection processes which may occur
during migration (WHO, 2018). There may be differences in
socio-demographic characteristics among refugees who migrate
to high-income countries and those who stay in the home country
or migrate to other poorer or nearer countries. Selection processes
may also occur between people who stay for a longer time in a
given host country and those who leave that country after a
shorter period of time.

Finally, understanding the impact of changing social contexts
and political climates on the equilibrium between post-migration
risk and protective factors may need to be in the research agenda
too. Increasing negative (or, on the other hand, positive) social
attitudes in host countries may influence the level of discrimin-
ation that refugees encounter, the investment in social integration
programmes and the opportunities for refugees to flourish. This,
in turn, could have a negative impact on asylum seekers’ and refu-
gees’ mental health. Interventions provided within mental health
services may not be able to address these issues on their own.
