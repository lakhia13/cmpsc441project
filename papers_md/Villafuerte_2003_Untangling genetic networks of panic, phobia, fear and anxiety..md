Abstract

As  is  the  case  for  normal  individual  variation  in  anxiety  levels,  the  conditions  panic  disorder,
agoraphobia  and  other  phobias  have  a  significant  genetic  basis.  Recent  reports  have  started  to
untangle the genetic relationships between predispositions to anxiety and anxiety disorders.

“But  if  I  am  in  an  unfamiliar  place,  among a  number  of
strange people, or people whom I feel to be strangers, then
the  whole  room  presses  on  my  chest  and  I  am  unable  to
move, my  whole  personality  seems  virtually  to  get  under
their skins, and everything becomes hopeless.”

Franz Kafka [1]

Anxiety,  panic,  and  fear  are  natural  responses  to  a  hostile
environment.  Yet 
these
responses can wreak havoc. In extreme cases, people with
anxiety  disorders  may  be  unable  to  leave  home  for  fear  of
having a panic attack. Conversely, individuals vary in their
baseline level of anxiety. In recent months, several reports
on  linkage  studies  have  been  published  that  identify  loci
involved in normal variation in anxiety and/or that predis-
pose  to  several  anxiety  disorders.  These  studies  suggest
that  there  may  be  connections  between  anxiety  disorders
and normal variation in anxiety levels in humans and even
in mice. 

High  levels  of  baseline  anxiety  are  often  associated  with
depression  [2].  Feeling  depressed,  vulnerable,  and  anxious
is summarized by the personality trait described as neuroti-
cism,  abbreviated  N,  a  quantitative  trait  that  can  be  deter-
mined  for  anyone  using  the  NEO  personality  inventory
(NEO-PI)  [3].  People  scoring  high  on  the  anxiety  facet  of
neuroticism  tend  to  endorse  statements  such  as:  “I  often
feel  tense  and  jittery,”  “I  often  worry  about  things  that
might  go  wrong,”  or  ”I  am  easily  worried.”  About  40%  of

individual  variation  in  N  is  attributed  to  genes  [4],  and
about  55%  of  the  genetic  vulnerability  to  N  overlaps  with
that to depression [5].

In  contrast  to  normal  variation  in  baseline  anxiety  levels,
individuals  with  anxiety  disorders  such  as  panic  disorder,
agoraphobia  and  specific  phobias  (formerly  called  simple
phobias) are often severely handicapped by their fear. People
with  panic  disorder  experience  unprovoked  panic  attacks
with  terrifying  fear  and  physical  signs  of  panic,  such  as
increased  heart  rate,  sweating  and  feeling  choked.  Agora-
phobia is characterized by fear of being in public places and
often co-exists with panic disorder, whereas specific phobias
are  characterized  by  intense,  unreasonable  fear  of  specific
things  (such  as  spiders,  snakes  or  lightening)  or  situations
(flying an airplane or having blood drawn). These are famil-
ial  phenotypes  in  which  first-degree  relatives  of  those
affected  have  a  significantly  increased  risk  relative  to  the
general  population  risk.  For  panic  disorder,  the  risk  is  10-
20-fold higher in first-degree relatives [6], compared to the
general population incidence of about 2%. Phobias generally
show about a three-fold increase in first-degree relatives [7],
with  a  lifetime  prevalence  of  any  type  of  phobia  in  the
general  population  of  about  10%  [8].  Family  studies  show
that relatives usually have the same disorder as the proband
(the affected individual who brought the family to the atten-
tion  of  researchers),  except  that  relatives  of  probands  with
agoraphobia are also at increased risk for panic disorder [6].
Some therefore suggest that agoraphobia is a severe subtype
of  panic  disorder,  although  this  is  not  universally  accepted

[6]. Twin studies suggest heritability of 44% for panic disor-
der  [9],  39%  for  agoraphobia,  and  around  30%  for  anxiety
disorder and specific phobias [10].

These  disorders  can  segregate  in  large  families  and  have  a
significant  heritability.  The  genetics  are  complex,  however,
with a significant nongenetic contribution as well as partial
overlaps in phenotypes, all of which make linkage analysis to
identify genes a difficult endeavor. In spite of these difficul-
ties, several risk loci for anxiety-related traits have recently
been localized by linkage analysis [11-19]. While no specific
gene  has  been  identified,  localization  of  the  gene  regions
represents  not  just  progress  towards  gene  identification:  it
may  help  in  outlining  the  etiology  of  the  disorders.  We  are
now  starting  to  get  an  idea  of  which  disorders  may  be  dis-
tinct and which may overlap genetically. 

A more systematic way to identify genetic variants affecting
N is a whole-genome analysis. Recently Fullerton et al. [12]
reported  the  first  large-scale  systematic  linkage  analysis  of
N.  Over  80,000  individuals  in  over  20,000  sibships  of  at
least two individuals were identified, contacted and adminis-
tered the NEO-PI. Of these, over 600 sibships scoring at the
extremes  of  the  distribution  -  either  both  extremely  high,
both extremely low, or extremely discordant high-low - were
selected for the genome scan. Five loci were identified with
logarithm  of  odds  (LOD)  scores  above  3.8,  which  corre-
sponds  to  a  genome-wide  significance  p  <  0.05.  Some  loci
acted  only  in  females  and  others  only  in  males,  suggesting
that  gender  needs  to  be  considered  in  studies  of  anxiety.
Interestingly, one of these loci maps to a region of 1q homol-
ogous  to  the  region  containing  the  QTLs  found  in  mice  on
chromosome 1.

QTL studies of anxiety traits in human and mice
Candidate  genes  that  might  affect  anxiety  in  humans  are
many: dozens of genes when knocked-out show an increase
in  levels  of  anxiety  in  mice  [20].  Most  normal  variation  is,
however, not likely to be due to null alleles. Thus, analysis of
quantitative  trait  loci  (QTLs),  to  study  the  variations  in
anxiety  between  normal  mouse  strains,  may  be  a  better
model of normal human population variation. Many mouse
QTLs  related  to  anxiety  have  been  published  and  reviewed
recently [21]. But QTLs are often broad and cannot easily be
narrowed  down  to  small  intervals  or  genes.  Flint  and  co-
workers  have  recently  used  heterogeneous  stock  (HS)  mice
to overcome this problem. HS mice are akin to a population -
mice are mated to maximize heterogeneity, and each mouse
is  a  genetically  unique  individual.  But  HS  mice  are  derived
from a small number of inbred strains, typically eight, so the
number  of  different  alleles  is  limited.  Using  two  sets  of  HS
mice, Talbot et al. [18] recently narrowed down several dif-
ferent mouse anxiety traits (conditioned fear, contextual fear
and open-field exploration) to small, non-overlapping inter-
vals  on  mouse  chromosome  1,  in  a  region  previously  impli-
cated  by  other  studies.  These  results  suggest  that  there  are
several  anxiety  genes  in  close  proximity,  rather  than  one
gene with pleiotropic effects.

Testing  specific  candidate  genes  in  humans  can  be  done
by simple association tests that ask the following: does the
average N score depend significantly on the genotype? The
first such study implicating a specific gene was by Lesch et
al.  [22],  who  found  a  common  functional  promoter
variant  in  the  serotonin  transporter  associated  with  neu-
roticism. Similarly, we recently identified a coding variant
in  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF)  [23]  associ-
ated with N - and this variant is also found associated with
bipolar  disorder  [24],  confirming  the  link  between  N  and
depression. Each of these genetic variants has only a small
effect  size,  however,  influencing  just  a  few  percent  of  the
total variance. 

Linkage analysis of panic disorder and phobias 
Five  linkage  studies  have  investigated  panic  disorder  using
whole-genome  scans  [11,13,15,16,19]  and  one  scanned  tar-
geted regions [17]. These studies differed in their phenotypic
classification, however, several started out with panic disor-
der  probands  but  found  a  high  incidence  of  generalized
anxiety  disorders,  agoraphobia  and  specific  phobias  in  the
respective  pedigrees.  Thus,  some  of  the  etiology  may
overlap,  and  indeed,  linkage  analysis  in  some  studies
resulted in higher LOD scores when a more inclusive pheno-
type  was  used  [17].  But  other  studies  report  higher  LOD
scores when families with distinct phenotypes were separate
[13,15]. Comparing the loci found in different studies for the
different  chromosomes  results  in  a  complex  picture  that  is
summarized  in  Table  1.  Some  loci  seem  to  be  specific  to
fairly narrowly defined disorders, such as panic disorder on
chromosomes  9q,  13q,  and  22q,  and  phobias  on  distal  3q,
whereas others suggest linkage to multiple forms of anxiety
related to panic disorder, for example on 1q and 10q.

Many  chromosomal  regions  show  evidence  for  linkage  to
panic  disorder  and  related  phenotypes,  and  some  of  them
have been confirmed in more than one study (Table 1). Three
loci  (1q,  7p,  and  13q)  are  linked  to  both  panic  disorder  and
neuroticism  but  not  agoraphobia  or  simple  phobias.  Three
different studies found linkage of panic disorder to chromo-
some 1q [11,13,15] - but all map panic disorder distal to the 1q
locus  related  to  neuroticism  and  to  the  murine  anxiety  QTL
discussed  above.  Two  different  study  designs  implicated  the
same  region  of  chromosome  13q:  an  HLOD  score  (a  LOD
score under conditions of heterogeneity) of 3.57 was corrobo-
rated by multipoint analyses in 60 families segregating panic
disorder and bladder/kidney conditions [15], suggesting that
this locus includes genes involved in a pleiotropic syndrome.
In addition, this region was also implicated by a large sibling
study of neuroticism, at least in females [12]. Two studies also
found  linkage  to  7p  in  panic  disorder  [11,16],  which  is  also
associated with neuroticism [12].

*One family. †Human equivalents of mouse QTLs. The number of + signs indicates the approximate relative significance of the linkage.

In a more targeted approach, focusing on a single extended
pedigree and only on regions syntenic to suggested QTLs in
mice, linkage was obtained for panic disorder combined with
agoraphobia to 12q13 [17]. In addition, an HLOD score peak
on 12q22 - possibly another locus - was obtained for families
segregating  panic  disorder  and  bladder/kidney  conditions
[15].  Fullerton  and  colleagues’  [12]  study  of  discordant  and
concordant siblings found their highest LOD score of 4.7 for
a QTL for neuroticism in this region. In a linkage study of 25
Icelandic  extended  pedigrees,  linkage  to  chromosome  9q31
was  found  with  a  highly  significant  allele-scanning  LOD
score of 4.18 [19]. If the phenotype is broadened to include
anxiety  and  an  additional  37  pedigrees  are  included,  the
LOD score goes down to 2.0, suggesting that 9q31 harbors a
locus that is fairly specific for panic disorder. Two indepen-
dent  studies  in  non-Icelandic  Caucasians  [11,15]  showed
LOD  scores  between  1  and  2  for  panic  disorder  in  a  region
about 30 centiMorgans distal to 9q31. 

Modest  LOD  scores  for  panic  disorder  on  chromosome  3q
were reported in two studies [11,13]. One of these studies, a
genome  scan  of  families  segregating  panic  disorder,  agora-
phobia,  specific  phobias  and  other  anxiety  disorders,  also
identified  a  region  on  chromosome  14p  as  linked  to  panic
disorder and agoraphobia [13] as well as to specific phobias
[14].  If  a  narrow  phenotype  of  exclusively  agoraphobia  was
considered,  the  linkage  peak  on  3q  moved  to  a  more  distal
location,  but  this  result  was  dominated  by  a  single  family
that showed no linkage to 14p. Removal of this family from
the genome-scan analysis for specific phobias increased the
LOD score for 14p in the remaining families. Thus, by careful
attention to phenotypes, the differential contribution of 14p,
predominantly to phobias, and 3q, predominantly to agora-
phobia but also panic disorder, could be dissected in spite of
some overlap. These linkage studies suggest that agorapho-
bia  and  specific  phobias  may  have  different  etiologies,  a

conclusion  that  is  consistent  with  epidemiological  data  [6].
Moreover, in mouse one of five QTLs for open-field activity,
an anxiety-related trait, mapped to a region homologous to
14p [25].

Finally, linkage of a chromosome 22q marker, but not multi-
point linkage, was reported in the same families segregating
panic  disorder  and  bladder/kidney  conditions  that  showed
linkage  to  13q  [15].  In  addition,  association  was  reported
between panic disorder and a haplotype around a candidate
gene  on  22q12,  catechol-O-methyltransferase  (COMT),
which  may  have  a  biological  role  in  anxiety  [26].  A  mouse
QTL  for  transition  from  dark  to  light,  an  anxiety-related
phenotype,  has  been  mapped  to  a  mouse  chromosome  15
region  homologous  in  part  to  human  22q13  [27],  but  the
map position is too broad to conclude with certainty that the
mouse QTL is syntenic with human 22q. 

How many phenotypes?
The high comorbidity of multiple anxiety disorders within the
same individuals and between individuals in the same pedi-
gree presents a particular challenge for genetics. Are some of
these disorders extremes of a dimensional trait, do they share
some  susceptibility  genes,  or  are  they  completely  different
phenotypes  with  some  degree  of  overlap?  There  is  some
agreement between epidemiological and genetic linkage data
to suggest that panic disorder and agoraphobia are related to
each other but distinct from specific phobias. But there seem
to  be  genes  that  increase  risk  only  for  specific  disorders,  as
well as genes that broadly increase the risk for anxiety disor-
ders.  Some  (see  [6])  argue  strongly  that  dimensional  traits
such as neuroticism should be incorporated into the diagnos-
tic criteria for genetic studies. The fact that all five QTLs for
neuroticism identified in the large population study [12] also
map  near  anxiety  disorder  loci  strongly  supports  this

approach. The focus on extremes in this QTL study may have
introduced a bias towards anxiety disorders, however. On the
other hand, some studies have been quite successful by focus-
ing  on  rare  subtypes  such  as  panic  disorder  associated  with
bladder and renal abnormalities [15]. Estivill and colleagues
[28]  used  a  similar  narrow  subtype  approach,  and  found
many  patients  with  panic  disorder  and  hyperextendable
joints to have a somatic chromosome 15 abnormality. 

A  final  question  to  consider  is  whether  linkage  to  the  same
region always implies the same gene. Although a number of
related  phenotypes  may  map  to  the  same  chromosomal
interval, these regions are often large and may harbor more
than  one  susceptibility  locus.  This  is  exemplified  by  the
mouse study in which several anxiety-related QTLs mapped
to the same region of chromosome 1 but were later shown by
fine  mapping  to  map  to  more  than  one  locus  [18].  Thus,
while it is tempting to conclude that some loci are associated
with more generalized anxiety whereas others are more spe-
cific and linked to only one disorder, we have to be careful:
some of the ‘reproducible’ linkage regions may contain more
than  one  gene,  and  others  will  be  false  positives.  Neverthe-
less,  enormous  progress  has  been  made  in  the  past  year.
Careful  ascertainment  and  recording  of  all  relevant  pheno-
types  will  be  necessary  to  allow  linkage  and  association
analysis with both narrowly and more broadly defined traits
and  disorders,  and  will  probably  be  essential  if  we  are  to
succeed  with  the  next  step,  the  identification  of  the  genes
involved in these complex and disabling disorders.
