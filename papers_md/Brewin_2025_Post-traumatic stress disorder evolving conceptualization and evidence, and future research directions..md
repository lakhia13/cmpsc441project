The understanding of responses to traumatic events has been greatly influenced by the introduction of the diagnosis of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  
In this paper we review the initial versions of the diagnostic criteria for this condition and the associated epidemiological findings, including sociocultural 
differences. We consider evidence for post- traumatic reactions occurring in multiple contexts not previously defined as traumatic, and the implications that 
these observations have for the diagnosis. More recent developments such as the DSM- 5 dissociative subtype and the ICD- 11 diagnosis of complex PTSD 
are reviewed, adding to evidence that there are several distinct PTSD phenotypes. We describe the psychological foundations of PTSD, involving distur-
bances to memory as well as to identity. A broader focus on identity may be able to accommodate group and communal influences on the experience 
of trauma and PTSD, as well as the impact of resource loss. We then summarize current evidence concerning the biological foundations of PTSD, with a 
particular focus on genetic and neuroimaging studies. Whereas progress in prevention has been disappointing, there is now an extensive evidence support-
ing the efficacy of a variety of psychological treatments for established PTSD, including trauma- focused interventions – such as trauma- focused cognitive 
behavior therapy (TF- CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) – and non- trauma- focused therapies, which also include some 
emerging identity- based approaches such as present- centered and compassion- focused therapies. Additionally, there are promising interventions that are 
neither psychological nor pharmacological, or that combine a pharmacological and a psychological approach, such as 3,4- methylenedioxymethampheta-
mine (MDMA)- assisted psychotherapy. We review advances in the priority areas of adapting interventions in resource- limited settings and across cultural 
contexts, and of community- based approaches. We conclude by identifying future directions for work on trauma and mental health.

The world is currently experiencing the highest number of state- 
based conflicts (i.e., conflicts in which one of the actors is a govern-
ment or state) since the Second World War, as well as a very high 
number of non- state- based conflicts (i.e., conflicts between for-
mally or informally organized groups)1. Approximately 468 million 
children are currently living within a conflict zone, often in areas 
where armed groups or forces recruit and use them in those con-
flicts2. A variety of individual, relationship, community and societal 
factors are being associated with increased levels of gender- based 
violence3. Childhood and domestic abuse as well as exposure to 
traumatic events at work are on the rise4,5, and recent health- 
related events have had a huge traumatic impact at various levels of  
population worldwide6. In the coming years, climate change is like-
ly to further exacerbate the frequency of traumatic events, and their 
direct and indirect impact on adults and children7.

Since 1980, the management of psychological trauma has be-
come inextricably bound up with the diagnosis of post- traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD). Although there were initially numerous 
skeptics, this diagnosis has since established itself and has be-
come an extremely effective vehicle for publicizing the effects of 
all kinds of traumatic events. Not only has knowledge of trauma 
and its effects grown enormously as a result, but in many coun-
tries there is now an infrastructure to support these developments, 
and a high visibility of trauma- related conditions in the planning 
of governments and non- governmental organizations (NGOs).

With increasing knowledge has come a greater appreciation of 
the complexities of understanding people’s response to traumatic 

events. First, what is a traumatic event? Initially this was concep-
tualized as an event that would have an overwhelming effect on 
anyone, while now it is understood as an event that has a potential 
overwhelming effect on some people. This effect can take forms 
other than PTSD – for example, depression or prolonged grief. 
Thus, the definition of a traumatic event cannot be considered sole-
ly in the context of PTSD.

Views were initially shaped by the lists of traumatic events con-
tained in standard survey instruments, but greater recognition of 
the symptoms has led to trauma reactions being acknowledged in 
many other contexts, such as after a very difficult childbirth or a 
psy chotic breakdown. Moreover, there is increasing appreciation 
that events may impact whole families and communities, and that 
the relation of persons to their community may affect their indi vid-
ual response.

The effective management of psychological trauma requires 
that new knowledge is constantly reviewed, evaluated and reflect-
ed upon. In this paper, we start by discussing the current un der-
standing of what constitutes a traumatic event in different con texts.  
We continue by summarizing how PTSD has been di ag nosed for 
most of the time since its introduction in 1980, and what has been 
discovered about its epidemiology using the relevant diag nos tic 
criteria. Subsequent sections address changes and contro ver sies 
in the definition of a traumatic event, and more recent de vel op-
ments in diagnosis, including the introduction of com plex PTSD 
in ICD- 11. We then review some of the most impor tant psycho-
logical and biological processes involved in PTSD. Later sections

summarize how this condition can most effectively be prevented 
and treated, and identify trends and avenues for research and 
practice that are likely to be important in the future.

WHAT IS A TRAUMATIC EVENT AND WHAT MAY BE 
ITS EFFECTS?

A traumatic event is one with a potential to severely challenge 
the ability of an individual or a community to adapt, requiring ma-
jor changes to ways of living or thinking.

Exposure to this category of events is a universal aspect of the 
human experience. In the health literature, we tend to focus on 
the adverse effects that traumatic events can have on the lives of 
in di vid uals and communities8. However, it is worth noting at the 
out set that the effects of exposure to traumatic events are complex 
and varied, and that they may elicit strong reactions without lead-
ing to maladaptive responses9.

Normal reactions to traumatic events are often linked to the spe-
cifi c circumstances of the occurrence. For example, ongoing threat 
is associated with anxiety; loss is associated with grief and de pres-
sion; negligence by others, injustice and betrayal are associat ed 
with anger; and abandonment is associated with despair10,11. If 
the traumatic exposure is time- limited, these reactions are typi-
cal ly brief, and may be adaptive and occasionally lead to personal 
growth12. However, traumatic events can have a significant and 
some times widespread and devastating negative impact.

Many factors help explain the substantial variation in the im-
pact of trauma. Some of them depend on the characteristics of the 
traumatic event itself13,14. For example, the course of untreated 
PTSD arising from events that are considered intentional (e.g., do-
mes tic violence) has more frequently a worsening trajectory and 
shows a greater tendency to chronicity than that of untreated PTSD 
after unintentional events (e.g., natural disasters)15.

Moreover, individuals’ psychological, genetic and neurobiolo gi-
cal characteristics can predispose them to maladaptive reactions to  
trauma16- 18, and act in combination with their sociocultural and so    -  
ci etal- structural context. For example, exposure to traumatic events, 
urbanicity, ethnoracial discrimination, socioeconomic dep ri va tion, 
and limited opportunities as a migrant all act in con cert with genet-
ic and other forms of vulnerability to enhance the risk of psychotic 
symptoms and disorders19,20.

These interactions affect all aspects of traumatic exposure and 
its consequences, including the probability of exposure to psy-
chosocial trauma21; the range of emotional reactions to traumatic 
exposure22; variations in risk, symptoms and course of resulting 
trauma- related conditions22,23; the availability and type of sup-
ports that people can engage24; the availability and effectiveness of 
mental health interventions23; and the process of recovery25.

The sociocultural and societal- structural context exerts its influ-
ence by shaping people’s life circumstances and risks, their inter-
pretation of events, the coping and healing options that they have 
access to and use, and community reactions that influence their 
experience.

The impact of trauma can also be transmitted across generations, 

as in the case of children of survivors of the Second World War Ho-
locaust26 and the Cambodian genocide27. These community- level 
traumas have been argued to influence recurring cycles of mass 
violence. “Historical trauma”, a term coined by Native American re-
searchers to describe the impact of European and Anglo- American 
colonization, is thought to be a significant factor contributing to el-
evated rates of alcohol dependence and abuse, PTSD, suicide, vio-
lence and depression in Native communities28,29.

In more sociocentric or collectivistic societies, communal ele-
ments may exert a larger influence on trauma reactions than they 
do in more individualistic societies. In many parts of Africa, for 
example, the predominant Ubuntu worldview (“I am because we 
are”) holds that an individual’s fate and well- being are closely tied 
to those of others in his/her social network30,31. A person can then 
experience PTSD symptoms due to an event happening to anoth-
er member of the community.

Data from the World Mental Health Surveys have shown that, 
in societies that tend to be collectivistic (such as in South Africa 
and Japan), traumatic events occurring to others within a person’s 
social network are associated with a high conditional prevalence 
of PTSD32. Among North Korean defectors, PTSD severity was 
more strongly associated with witnessing trauma events involving 
family members than with exposure to physical abuse or political- 
ideological trauma (e.g., being a political detainee)33.

How do communal risk factors exert this influence on a person’s 
reactions to traumatic events? Several mechanisms are currently 
being examined. One involves the impact of contextual factors on 
individual experience. Even when traumatic events affect entire 
communities, sociocultural/structural factors apportion risk dif-
ferently, including by neighborhood characteristics and resources 
available to the person’s support systems34. For example, among 
residents affected by Hurricane Andrew in Florida, Latinxs were 
significantly more likely to experience PTSD symptoms than non- 
Latinx Whites, a vulnerability partly mediated by Latinxs’ accul-
turative stress as immigrants35. Specific living circumstances can 
also pattern trauma- related reactions. For instance, living among 
unpunished perpetrators in settings of mass violence can result in 
long- standing anger and frustration, complicating trauma- related 
psychopathology36,37.

Another mechanism of communal effects involves meaning tra  -
ditions that become part of personal identity, and shape col lective 
reality. For example, among Tibetan refugees fleeing Chinese gov-
ernment rule, religious persecution – e.g., witnessing the destruc-
tion of monasteries or being forced to publicly renounce the Dalai 
Lama – was more strongly associated with PTSD symptoms than 
torture or imprisonment38. Forced interruption of these meaning 
traditions can foster the onset and/or persistence of traumatic grief 
states, such as during the Rwandan genocide, when the grief of 
survivors was magnified by traditional beliefs about the precarious 
spiritual status of deceased relatives who had not been properly 
buried39.

Individual transgressions of collective moral codes can also 
have a greater pathogenic effect than other severe traumatic ex-
posures. Among US veterans in the National Vietnam Veterans 
Readjustment Study, harming civilians and prisoners was associ-

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025 

53

ated with higher odds of PTSD onset than either combat exposure 
or vulnerability factors preceding military service (e.g., childhood 
physical abuse)40.

A further mechanism of communal effects involves the pattern-
ing of trauma reactions by cultural syndromes and other idioms 
of distress41,42. These are culturally specific forms of expressing 
emotional distress that arise in local contexts in response to spe-
cific culturally- based attributions43. Examples relevant to trauma 
reactions include ataques de nervios (attacks of nerves) in Latinx 
populations, khyâl attacks among Cambodians, ihahamuka (liter-
ally, lungs without breath) among Rwandan genocide survivors, 
and “thinking too much” in many cultural settings41,44,45. These 
patterned behavioral responses may be evoked as an embodied 
reaction by traumatic events, if they are linked to a traumatic etiol-
ogy by the cultural group46.

Despite this variability in the contexts where potentially trau-
matic events occur and in the range of their effects, the literature 
has focused overwhelmingly on one specific type of psychopa-
thology, i.e. PTSD. However, issues raised in this section about the 
nature of traumatic events continue to be central in the remainder 
of the paper, whether it be how PTSD should be diagnosed, what 
are its psychological foundations, or how it can be treated.

DIAGNOSIS OF PTSD

DSM- III to DSM- IV- TR

Although many argue that post- traumatic stress syndromes 
have been described at least as far back as Homer’s Iliad47, PTSD 
was not codified as an official mental disorder diagnosis until pub-
lication of the DSM- III48. Earlier versions of the DSM had included 
combat- stress reaction as a syndrome, reflecting a long history of 
research documenting the psychological effects of war on soldiers, 
including large- scale empirical studies of First World War veterans 
conducted in the UK and elsewhere49.

The inclusion of PTSD in the DSM- III has been credited to the 
convergence of several social movements in the US in the 1960s 
and 1970s. These included veterans’ advocates recognizing the 
impact of the Vietnam war on those who served; feminists raising 
awareness of the prevalence and consequences of violence against 
women; and psychiatrists treating Holocaust survivors50.

From its introduction, PTSD has been unique in the DSM in 
requiring a specific environmental stressor for its diagnosis. This 
component of PTSD has been one of the most debated aspects of 
its diagnostic criteria. Actually, it plays a gatekeeper role in focus-
ing the disorder on reactions to events involving very high levels 
of physical threat. The intention has been to prevent a diagnosis 
of PTSD being applied following events that are regarded as more 
everyday stressors, such as financial problems.

Up to and including the publication of the DSM- IV- TR in 2000, 
four sets of symptoms have been consistently part of the PTSD di-
agnosis: re- experiencing of the traumatic event, avoidance of re-
minders of the event, numbing in the form of restricted affect or 
detachment from others, and symptoms of hyperarousal such as 

sleep disturbance and exaggerated startle response51. These have 
been distributed among three symptom groups, with the alloca-
tion of symptoms to groups changing somewhat with successive 
editions of the DSM. Survival guilt featured in the DSM- III only. 
Memory impairment for significant aspects of the event has re-
mained in all editions, although it is the symptom most weakly as-
sociated with the others52. The total number of PTSD symptoms 
increased from 12 in the DSM- III to 17 in the DSM- III- R.

Since the DSM- III- R, symptoms have been required to be pres-
ent for a minimum of one month prior to diagnosis, and since the 
DSM- IV there has been an additional requirement for them to be 
accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in 
functioning. These changes have reflected the prevailing view that 
the symptoms do not indicate pathology in themselves. Pathology 
is indicated by the failure of the symptoms to remit of their own 
accord, and by their impact on everyday life.

ICD- 10

PTSD was first recognized by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) as a diagnosis in the ICD- 1053, over a decade after the 
DSM- III publication. A key difference between the ICD- 10 and the 
DSM- III/IV was that the former used a descriptive text and “diag-
nostic guidelines” rather than requiring the presence of specific di-
agnostic criteria. Although potentially helpful in terms of facilitat-
ing clinician judgment and applicability in very diverse clinical and 
cultural settings, the ICD- 10 approach has not been easily trans-
lated into specific research instruments. This has likely contributed 
to the use of structured measures of the DSM construct of PTSD, 
rather than the ICD guidelines, in most research before 2013.

The ICD- 10 stressor description was “a stressful event or situa-
tion (either short-  or long- lasting) of an exceptionally threatening 
or catastrophic nature, which is likely to cause pervasive distress 
in almost anyone”. Symptom descriptions included the following 
phrases: “Commonly there is fear and avoidance of cues that re-
mind sufferers of the original trauma” and “There is usually a state 
of autonomic hyperarousal with hypervigilance, an enhanced 
startle reaction, and insomnia”. The diagnostic guidelines stated: 
“In addition to evidence of trauma, there must be a repetitive, in  -
trusive recollection or re- enactment of the event in memories, day-
time imagery, or dreams. Conspicuous emotional detachment, 
numbing of feeling, and avoidance of stimuli that might arouse 
recollection of the trauma are often present but are not essential  
for the diagnosis. The autonomic disturbances, mood disorder, and  
behavioural abnormalities all contribute to the diagnosis but are 
not of prime importance”.

These extracts highlight the many similarities between the two 
diagnostic systems, but also some differences. In the ICD- 10, there 
was also no requirement for symptoms to last a minimum length of  
time or to be accompanied by distress or functional impairment. 
In one large- scale study, agreement between the ICD- 10 and the 
DSM- IV was found to be moderate, with higher rates for the ICD- 
10 being mainly attributable to the requirement for significant dis-
tress or functional impairment in the DSM- IV54.

DSM- 5 and DSM- 5- TR

In the DSM- 555, PTSD was moved from Anxiety Disorders to a 
new diagnostic section named “Trauma-  and Stressor- Related Dis-
orders”, and the definition of trauma was narrowed to events requir-
ing “actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence”.

Significant restructuring of the symptom criteria also occurred. 
The symptom clusters were expanded from three to four, and the 
number of symptoms was increased from 17 to 20. To meet di-
ag nos tic criteria in the DSM- 5, the individual must have one re- 
  experiencing symptom, one avoidance symptom, two symptoms 
reflecting negative alterations in cognition or mood, and two symp-
toms reflecting alterations in arousal or reactivity. These changes 
resulted in a lower PTSD prevalence using the DSM- 5 crite ria, 
as compared to the DSM- IV ones. For example, Kilpatrick et al56 
found a lifetime prevalence of 9.8% using the DSM- IV and 8.3% 
with the DSM- 5, when assessing PTSD symptoms in relation to the 
same event.

The DSM- 5 criteria as described above apply to children over 6 
years of age, with some qualifications to the re- experiencing symp-
toms to ensure that they are developmentally appropriate. For ex-
ample, children may re- enact aspects of the trauma in play rath er 
than explicitly describe recurrent intrusive memories of the trau-
ma.

Following research that found under- diagnosis in pre- school 
children and tested the validity of alternative criteria57- 59, diag-
nostic criteria were added in the DSM- 5 for children aged 6 and 
under. These include specifying that the child could develop PTSD 
if he/she witnessed or heard about a traumatic event happening  
to a parent or caregiver. There are only three symptom clusters: re-     
experiencing (one symptom required), avoidance and negative al-
terations in cognition or mood (one symptom required), and al-
terations in arousal or reactivity (two symptoms required). More-
over, the descriptions of specific symptoms have been changed to 
be developmentally appropriate. For example, the adult symptom 
of irritability or aggression includes “extreme temper tantrums” in 
children.

The criteria for PTSD remained unchanged in the DSM- 5- TR60. 
The description of the disorder in the text was expanded in many 
areas, including more detailed discussion of what constitutes a 
traumatic event, the prevalence of PTSD from the World Mental 
Health Surveys and in conflict- affected populations, and the role 
of cultural factors and sex-  and gender- related issues in the devel-
opment and clinical expression of the disorder.

Delayed- onset PTSD

There has been an explicit recognition within successive edi-
tions of the DSM that PTSD does not always begin directly, or even 
soon, after the traumatic event. The “delayed- onset” form of PTSD 
(“with delayed expression” in the DSM- 5) is defined as occurring 
at least 6 months after the traumatic event.

This claim has been controversial in some quarters, because 
it appears to contradict the commonsense notion that traumatic 

events  overwhelm  physical,  emotional  and  psychological  de-
fenses. This assumption would imply that PTSD will almost always 
have an immediate onset. The ICD- 10 in fact suggested that onset 
almost always occurred within 6 months of the traumatic event. 
As we will see below, however, there is robust epidemiological evi-
dence for a distinct type of PTSD with delayed presentation.

Critiques of the PTSD diagnosis

One initial critique argued that PTSD was a Western construct 
of limited utility to other cultures and belief systems. However, 
subsequent research has determined the cross- cultural relevance 
of the diagnosis, while identifying culturally specific forms of trau-
ma- related distress41.

Other initial critiques suggested that PTSD did not offer anything 
additional to, and was not distinguishable from, existing diagnoses 
of anxiety and depressive disorders. However, PTSD did include 
symptoms that were not part of other disorders. Although some of 
these symptoms, such as intrusive memories and the avoidance of 
such memories, turned out to be present in other disorders61, other 
symptoms did discriminate. Following a traumatic event, flash-
backs and dissociative amnesia were found to be present in cases 
of PTSD but not in cases of non- PTSD psychiatric disorders62.

Longitudinal studies have successfully discriminated individ-
uals who developed PTSD following trauma from those who de-
veloped different psychiatric disorders, identifying separate risk 
factors for each trajectory63- 65. However, prospective work which 
followed people who had no history of depression before trauma 
exposure showed that depression only developed in those with 
PTSD66. High levels of comorbid depression remain a feature of 
PTSD, with some twin and molecular genetic studies reporting 
a high genetic correlation between PTSD and major depression. 
How best to understand this comorbidity remains a matter of de-
bate, given the limitations in all research designs. One possibility 
is that individuals with both disorders constitute a distinct pheno-
type from those with PTSD alone67.

A persistent critique focuses on the heterogeneity of PTSD, with  
more than 600,000 combinations of DSM- 5 symptoms theoreti-
cally able to lead to the diagnosis68. The analysis of a large military 
cohort confirmed that, in practice, over half of the participants 
who met criteria for PTSD had a unique pattern of symptoms, em-
phasizing that a DSM- 5 PTSD diagnosis does not reflect a uniform 
phenotype69. Some responses to this problem are described in a 
following section of this paper.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PTSD

Prevalence

Due to the ubiquity of trauma exposures globally, PTSD is a  -
mong the most prevalent mental disorders in the community. 
Strong evidence for the global burden of PTSD comes from the 
World Mental Health Surveys, a series of studies conducted using 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025 

55

the same measures across multiple countries, allowing for cross- 
country comparison. A study conducted in 24 countries, with 
71,083 respondents, found that the overall lifetime PTSD preva-
lence in the general population was 3.9%, and varied across high- 
in come (5.0%), upper- middle- income (2.3%), and low-  to lower- 
mid dle- income (2.1%) countries70.

Several country- specific population- based studies, and system-
atic reviews of these studies, confirm the cross- national – and even 
intra- national – heterogeneity in the prevalence of PTSD. Studies 
based on World Mental Health Surveys report lifetime prevalences 
ranging from as low as 1.3% in Japan71, through 2.2% in Spain72, 
and 2.3% in South Africa73, to the relatively high prevalence of 8.8% 
in Northern Ireland74. The first nationwide mental health survey in 
China reported a lifetime prevalence of 0.4%75. In the US general 
population, most studies find a lifetime prevalence around 5% in 
men and 10% in women, with an overall prevalence of about 8%76.
Studies of current or one- year prevalence of PTSD highlight the 
worldwide variation. An analysis of the Adult Psychiatric Morbid-
ity Survey in England reported a prevalence rate for current PTSD 
of 2.9%77, similar to the 2.4% reported for Canada78 and Italy79. 
The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well- Being 
found a 12- month prevalence of PTSD of 1.3%80. In contrast, a sys-
tematic review and meta- analysis of sub- Saharan African coun-
tries reported an overall prevalence during periods from the past 
week to the past year of 22%. There was substantial heterogeneity 
in the sample, with the pooled prevalence being 8% in conflict- 
unexposed and 30% in conflict- exposed regions81.

The prevalence of PTSD thus appears to vary widely. This is 
part ly due to the population studied, but also to variation in report-
ing of and exposure to traumatic events. For example, if specifi c 
trauma events that are associated with a high risk of PTSD, such as 
sexual assault, are not reported due to stigma, this will lead to un-
der es ti mates of PTSD prevalence at the population level.

Another source of variation is methodological. The World Men-
tal Health Surveys tend to report lower lifetime prevalence rates 
than other studies due to a key difference in assessing for PTSD. 
Most other studies have employed the “worst trauma” method, 
in which participants describe PTSD symptoms attributable to 
the worst traumatic event that they have ever experienced. This 
tends to overestimate the community prevalence of PTSD be-
cause “worst traumas” are not the most prevalent in any commu-
nity, and less severe traumas may have a different conditional risk 
for developing PTSD82. The World Mental Health Surveys, in con-
trast, use the “random event” method, in which a random event is 
selected from the list endorsed by a participant, and PTSD symp-
toms are assessed in relation to it. Random events might more ac-
curately reflect occurrence of traumatic events in the community, 
so the PTSD prevalence based on these events might be more 
representative of the actual burden in the community32. Surveys 
can also vary in numerous other ways, including their sampling 
frames, the use of interviews or self- administered questionnaires, 
and the choice of the survey instrument with its associated skip- 
outs, thresholds, or cut- off scores.

However, methodological standardization does not guarantee 
that diagnostic instruments are identifying equivalent concep-

tualizations and experiences of mental disorder. People endorse 
symptom queries within particular contexts of professional diag-
nostic practice; there are various levels of public awareness of no-
sologically defined forms of psychopathology across societies; and 
local variation affects response sets to survey instruments (e.g., dif-
ferent experiential thresholds at which a symptom is endorsed). 
All these factors may affect diagnosable rates of disorder41.

Conditional risk

Whereas the overall prevalence of PTSD reflects the number of 
cases of the disorder in a population – with a number of factors 
likely contributing to different cross- national estimates – condi-
tional risk refers to the prevalence of PTSD among those exposed 
to specific traumatic events, focusing on the variation by event 
type73. Overall prevalence is comparable to prevalence estimates 
for other psychiatric disorders, whereas conditional risk (which 
may be referred to as “prevalence” in some papers) is not. Condi-
tional risks for trauma- exposed populations are higher than over-
all prevalences documented in population- wide surveys32.

Most studies have shown that the conditional risk of PTSD var-
ies depending upon the type of traumatic event, although the or-
dering of risk across specific events tends to be different across 
studies. For example, a representative sample of US adults under 
the age of 45 found the highest conditional risk of PTSD after as-
saultive violence (20.9%)83. In a European study, the highest con-
ditional risks for PTSD were found after having a child with serious 
ill ness, being raped, being beaten by partner, being stalked, and 
being beaten by caregiver84. A study of a Brazilian urban popula-
tion found the highest conditional risks after war- related trauma, 
childhood sexual abuse, adult sexual violence, and interpersonal 
violence85.

In a range of studies, cumulative traumatic events have been 
found to be associated with greater subsequent risk of PTSD and 
great er severity of PTSD symptoms86.

Demographic differences

Women are reported to have a 2- 3 times higher risk of develop-
ing PTSD than men87. While men are more likely to experience 
trau matic events, women are about twice as likely to have PTSD af-
ter most of them. However, the conditional risk of PTSD is reported 
to be similar for men and women after childhood sexual abuse 
and sexual assault88. Importantly, traumatic events experienced 
by men and women tend to differ, with women experiencing more 
sexual assault and childhood sexual abuse, two of the traumatic 
events with the highest conditional risk for PTSD.

Evidence also suggests that gender non- binary and transgen-
der persons have a prevalence of PTSD three to ten times higher 
than that reported in general population studies89. Although fur-
ther research is needed, this higher prevalence is likely to reflect 
the higher burden of violence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) populations as well 

56

as the additional impact of discrimination90.

Age differences in PTSD are unclear. Findings from a German 
community- based study did not show substantial differences 
in PTSD reports by age91, consistent with a review of available 
studies92. In Northern Ireland, being younger than 65 was associ-
ated with increased PTSD risk74. Some smaller studies have noted 
diff er ences by age, including, for example, a longitudinal study of 
sur vivors of motor vehicle accidents, which found higher PTSD 
re ports among middle- aged vs. younger or older- aged women93.

Several individual- level markers of social and economic status 
have been documented to be linked to PTSD94. These include low 
education79, lower household income70, and being retired or un-
em ployed70,74.

Some of the previously mentioned demographic differences 
vary across cultural and ethnoracial groups. For example, in a large 
US community- based epidemiological study, gender differences 
were found for non- Latinx White, African American and Afro- 
Caribbean women, but not for Latinx or Asian- origin women102. 
Also, little association between PTSD and gender has been found 
in South Africa73. These differences have been attributed, among 
other factors, to variation in types of trauma exposure (e.g., simi-
lar exposure across genders to state- sponsored violence during 
the apartheid regime in South Africa), to shared societal- structural 
factors such as discrimination among US Latinx, and to cultural 
variations in gender- based expectations of what constitutes a-  
buse73,102.

Sociocultural differences

Mass traumatic events

The risk of PTSD differs by ethnoracial background, likely due to 
societal- structural factors, cultural interpretations, and/or trauma- 
exposure- related characteristics that covary with race/ethnicity in 
unequal societies41,95.

For example, a higher prevalence of PTSD has been reported 
among Latinx vs. non- Latinx White individuals in several circum-
stances, including as combat veterans of the Vietnam War (after 
ad justing for degree of exposure and other demographic charac-
teristics); as residents of lower Manhattan after the September 11, 
2001 attacks; as police officers exposed to line- of- duty trauma; 
and as survivors of a devastating hurricane (adjusting for trauma 
exposure)95.

The risk of PTSD also varies according to cultural interpreta-
tions and social contexts that influence the perceived severity of 
a stressor41. Among these are the relative severity of traumatic 
events affecting family members vs. the individual33, the impact of 
religious persecution over other stressors38, or the effect of being 
unable to conduct burial rituals beyond the impact of the death 
itself39.

Among the covariates that likely influence the relation between 
traumatic event exposure and risk of PTSD according to ethnora-
cial background are the availability of social support and other 
social resources that tend to facilitate recovery from traumatic 
events96, as well as the exposure to discrimination and persistent 
inequality (e.g., in wealth and other assets)97,98.

There are probably important cross- cultural differences in PTSD 
symptomatology, although they are incompletely documented. 
For instance, numbing- avoidance reactions vary cross- culturally, 
as noted in studies with Vietnamese refugees and Kalahari bush-
men, while somatic complaints are prototypical features of PTSD 
in some cultural groups while less common in others46,99. Some 
PTSD symptoms tend to be especially salient in certain groups, 
such as nightmares among Cambodians100 and American Indians/
Alaskan Natives101. These variations in PTSD symptoms are often 
influenced by the idioms of distress that are considered culturally 
normative responses to traumatic exposures. Nevertheless, despite 
these local variations, there is considerable cross- cultural validity 
of PTSD as a construct41.

There is a substantial literature suggesting that the population 
burden of PTSD can be high after mass traumatic events. For exam -
ple, a systematic review and meta- analysis of the global burden of 
PTSD in war- affected countries found an overall population preva-
lence of 26.5%103. However, variability in the mass traumatic events 
studied, the exposure among persons in samples, the methods of 
measurement, and the assessment tools used – in studies that are 
often conducted quickly after unexpected events – make general-
ization about the consequences of these mass traumatic events dif-
ficult.

It is probably not useful to provide single estimates of PTSD 
prevalence in the aftermath of mass traumatic events, given the di-
verse populations that likely experience the event differently from 
one another. For instance, a review that synthesized the available 
literature estimated the prevalence of PTSD after mass traumatic 
events at 30- 40% among direct victims, 10- 20% among rescue 
work ers, and 5- 10% in the general population104. The prevalence 
of PTSD has been documented to be particularly high among chil-
dren directly exposed to mass traumatic events105.

In recent years, several studies have documented the burden 
of PTSD in the context of global traumas such as the COVID- 19 
pandemic. A meta- analysis of 63 COVID- related studies found an 
overall PTSD prevalence of 17.5% at the population level106.

Trajectories after trauma and course of PTSD

After a traumatic event, four main trajectories have been usu-
ally reported: resilient (or resistant), in which persons have stable 
long- term healthy functioning and no (or few) PTSD symptoms; 
chronic, indicating long- lasting PTSD symptoms; recovered, with 
early onset of PTSD symptoms and subsequent remission; and 
delayed- onset, in which PTSD develops sometime after trauma ex-
posure107- 109. There is little consistency across studies about the rel-
ative prevalence of these trajectories. Among 54 studies reviewed, 
however, the resilience trajectory was the modal response (average 
of 65.7% across populations), followed by recovery (20.8%), chro-
nicity (10.6%), and delayed onset (8.9%)108.

The majority of research has been concerned with the course 
of established PTSD. A systematic review found that, after a mean 
observation period of 40 months, an average of 44.0% of individu-
als with PTSD at baseline no longer met disorder criteria. There 
was wide inter- study variation in remission rates from 8 to 89%, 
with rates being higher the sooner PTSD was measured after the 
traumatic event110. Among patients assessed in clinical settings, 
18- 50% experienced recovery within 3- 7 years, while the remain-
der had a recurrent or more chronic course111.

Most of the evidence suggests a dose- response effect of trau-
matic load on the probability of long- term spontaneous remission  
of  PTSD: a higher cumulative exposure to traumatic events is as-
sociated with a lower probability of remission112. The type of the 
experienced traumatic event(s) also contributes to the course of 
PTSD. One systematic review of untreated PTSD suggested that 
the perceived intentionality of traumatic events – such as domestic 
abuse (intentional) vs. natural disasters (unintentional) – was as-
sociated with worsening as opposed to improving trajectories, re-
spectively. In five studies of exposure to intentional trauma, about 
one- third of persons with PTSD remitted after 3 months, while an-
other third had chronic PTSD lasting more than 6 months15.

PTSD course may also be affected by social disadvantage, via the 
link between resources and access to treatment. The World Mental 
Health Surveys highlight substantial differences in treatment seek-
ing70, with the proportion of people with PTSD accessing treatment  
in the previous 12 months being 53.5% in high- income countries, 
28.7% in upper- middle- income countries, and 22.8% in low-  and 
lower- middle- income countries. A subsequent analysis of data 
from 17 surveys across 15 countries113 found that 43% of people 
with PTSD received any mental health services, including 50.6% 
in high- income countries vs. 19.8% in low-  and middle- income 
countries.

Of special interest has been delayed- onset PTSD. Meta- analyses 
of prospective studies report that around a quarter of PTSD cases 
have their onset at least 6 months after the traumatic event114,115. 
Factors associated with delayed- onset PTSD are found to be en-
countering trauma in a professional capacity (e.g., military per-
sonnel, firefighters, rescue workers, police) and “Western” cultural 
background (defined by country of origin).

A systematic review found that delayed- onset PTSD in the ab-
sence of any prior symptoms was rare116,117. Delayed onsets that 
represented exacerbations or reactivations of prior symptoms ac-
counted for 38.2% of military and 15.3% of civilian cases116.

ROLE OF THE TRAUMATIC EVENT

With  the  introduction  of  PTSD  in  the  DSM- III48,  traumatic 
events were conceptualized as being so extreme as to produce 
“significant symptoms of distress in almost anyone”. This claim 
helped to justify the need for PTSD as a disorder that, most un-
usually for a psychiatric diagnosis, was primarily caused by envi-
ronmental factors. The DSM- III- R118 further specified such events 
as being “outside the realm of normal experience” and added a 
list of characteristics, including serious threat or actual injury, de-

struction of one’s home or community, and witnessing mutilation 
or violent death. There was also a recognition that the events in-
cluded serious threat or harm to one’s children, spouse, or other 
close relatives and friends.

The DSM- IV119 expanded the range of qualifying stressors af-
fecting family and close friends to include learning about their 
sudden and unexpected death from any cause, and learning about 
traumatic events that they experienced. Furthermore, it included  
the person him/herself being sexually abused in childhood or di-
agnosed with a life- threatening illness. It recognized that traumatic 
events were not outside normal human experience but were rela-
tively common.

The DSM- IV also acknowledged a subjective component in 
how individuals responded, with events not having to be “mark-
edly distressing to almost anyone” but instead requiring that the 
“person’s response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror”. 
Whether this response had to be present at the time of the trauma 
itself or could arise later, for example with the development of 
delayed- onset PTSD, was not specified. Compared to the DSM- 
III- R, most of the additional PTSD cases brought about by expand-
ing the list of qualifying events were attributable to learning about 
the sudden unexpected death of a close relative or friend120, em-
phasizing the importance of social attachments in PTSD.

The subjective requirement introduced in the DSM- IV was ar-
gued to add little diagnostic specificity. In fact, in surveys, events 
that did not involve intense fear, helplessness or horror were un-
likely to meet the remaining criteria for the diagnosis. This finding 
was partly responsible for the requirement being dropped in the 
DSM- 5, with a consequent reduction in the role of subjectivity55. 
The DSM- 5 clarified that the diagnosis required exposure to ac-
tual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, either 
through direct experience, or witnessing in person the event hap-
pening to someone else, or learning that it occurred to close rela-
tives or friends.

In cases of the actual or threatened death of a family member 
or friend, the event was required to be violent or accidental. This 
eliminated many events considered traumatic under the DSM- IV, 
such as non- immediate, non- catastrophic, but nevertheless life- 
threatening medical events with natural causes. An extensive body 
of research documents that after such events, for example receiv-
ing a cancer diagnosis or having a heart attack, people may present 
symptoms of traumatic stress and meet other criteria for PTSD121-
 123.

A fourth type of exposure new in the DSM- 5 involved repeated 
or extreme encounters with aversive details of a traumatic event, 
e.g., first responders collecting human remains. Such exposure 
was excluded if it occurred solely via electronic media, unless this 
was work- related, for example police officers examining Internet 
sites for evidence of child abuse.

This persistent expansion of qualifying traumatic events led to 
concerns about “criterion creep”, whereby PTSD would become 
trivialized and associated with stressors such as divorce, finan-
cial problems, and verbal bullying124,125. This tendency has been 
evident in the proliferation of the term “trauma” in colloquial 
language and social media. However, concerns about criterion 

58 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

creep were mainly raised in the context of litigation and claims for 
damages, rather than arising in the clinic. We are unaware of any 
substantiated claims of PTSD being formally diagnosed after such 
stressors in the absence of a history of more serious trauma.

An opposite concern lies in the growing recognition that the 
voices of various relevant groups have been marginalized in the 
discussions and decisions made on what qualifies as a traumatic 
event. The diagnostic formulation has reflected the views of influ-
ential clinicians and researchers, but has not considered the input 
of people with lived experience of trauma in different contexts.

The approach taken by the DSM in specifying the objective na-
ture of traumatic events is designed to prevent the inappropriate 
use of the diagnosis and its application to non- traumatic stressors. 
There is an assumption that traumatic events involving life threat 
or risk to the integrity of one’s person are qualitatively different 
from other stressful life events, so that the PTSD trauma defini-
tion should be limited to events meeting this high bar of exposure 
severity126. Survey evidence, however, suggests that relaxing the 
criteria so that a broad range of events can potentially qualify as 
traumatic makes little difference to prevalence rates of PTSD as 
defined by the DSM- IV127,128.

Since even catastrophic events are generally followed by PTSD 
in some individuals but not others, there are likely to be complex 
interactions between individual risk factors and the harmfulness 
of a given stressful event129. The implication is that, in the presence 
of relevant risk factors, events not included in the DSM definition 
might be followed by a syndrome with the characteristics of PTSD. 
Consistent with this, there are least three categories of events not 
considered by the DSM that are empirically associated with high 
levels of PTSD symptoms. These include: a) repeated, cumulative 
aversive experiences such as stalking, bullying, emotional abuse,  
neglect and harassment, sometimes exacerbated by systemic dis  -
crim ination130- 132; b) terrifying hallucinations experienced by pa-
tients with psychosis or undergoing sedation in intensive care133,134; 
and c) stressors encountered by non- neurotypical groups such as 
people with autism135. Such cases have not been prominent in gen-
eral population surveys, but may account for significant degrees of 
morbidity in more specific groups.

In the DSM- 5, the majority of these presentations would cur-
rently have to be diagnosed as adjustment disorders, a situation 
that has been acknowledged as possibly incongruous if the same 
symptoms lead to two different diagnoses129. However, reports 
of PTSD diagnoses in response to events not considered in the 
DSM might instead be indicative of psychometric deficiencies in 
the measures used, particularly if these rely upon self- report. In 
the case of an individual experiencing terrifying hallucinations of 
events that did not occur in reality, the hallucination would not 
be considered a traumatic event by the DSM- 5, but would be ac-
counted for by the primary psychotic diagnosis and the associated 
impairment in reality testing.

We will see later on that the ICD- 11 allows a diagnosis of PTSD 
in a wide variety of traumatic situations, as it only requires expo-
sure to an event or series of events judged by the clinician to be 
extremely threatening or horrific. An alternative proposal136,137 is 
to acknowledge the poor validity of attempts to define traumatic 

events by dispensing with this altogether, relying instead on the 
pattern of symptoms and resulting disability to diagnose PTSD.

A related view is that PTSD is often an outcome of specific peri- 
traumatic and post- traumatic responses. These responses are usu-
ally associated with the objective circumstances identified in the 
DSM- 5, but may also occur in other situations. The responses may 
reflect a specific phenotype associated with a failure to recover 
from the normal effects of trauma18, or be related to prior exposure 
to childhood adversity, or to different patterns of environmental 
exposure such as overwhelming or cumulative trauma, or to spe-
cific types of appraisal, or to the use of certain coping strategies.

Peri- traumatic responses that increase the risk of PTSD can re-
flect both previous history and psychological or biological suscep-
tibility. They typically involve the subjective experience of fear, 
helplessness or horror, but may have additional components that 
mark them out from everyday stress responses. To date, psycho-
logical variables appear to be stronger markers of these responses 
than biological ones. They are characterized by cognitive overload 
(being unable to reflect or plan normally), mental defeat or resig-
nation, and dissociative symptoms such as changes to visual and 
body perception138- 140.

A frequent pattern of PTSD development takes place when 
these peri- traumatic responses are followed by negative appraisals 
and maladaptive post- traumatic behaviors such as thought sup-
pression and rumination141, or by negative social reactions such 
as criticism and rejection142- 144. The occurrence of subsequent 
stressors, not necessarily of a traumatic kind, is also an important 
contributor to onset94.

The adoption of fixed and objective versus more flexible criteria 
for what constitutes a traumatic event primarily reflects strategic 
priorities. The former approach helps to exclude invalid cases of 
PTSD, whereas the latter is designed to include all valid cases of 
the disorder. In moving forward, what is needed are more data on 
how PTSD presents following more “objectively” and more “sub-
jectively” traumatic events. It is important to establish, for exam-
ple, whether PTSD following repeated low- impact or hallucinated 
events, or occurring in non- neurotypical groups, is different in 
any respect from more conventionally recognized cases of PTSD, 
either in the way it develops, its symptom pattern, or its chronic-
ity. Studies may lead to the identification of additional conditions 
within a “family” of post- traumatic stress disorders.

A separate, but equally important, issue is whether the differ-
ent situations in which PTSD manifests require similar, or dissim-
ilar, treatment approaches. The expansion of potentially traumatic 
stressors may offer an important opportunity to better understand 
the nature of the condition, and to more appropriately tailor its  
man age ment.

DEVELOPMENTS IN DIAGNOSIS

The DSM- 5 dissociative subtype

The DSM- 5 introduced a dissociative subtype of PTSD charac-
terized by meeting full criteria for the disorder and exhibiting on-

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025 

59

going symptoms of depersonalization and/or derealization. This 
addition was based, in part, on the results of latent class and pro-
file analyses which showed that a small subset of individuals with 
PTSD (from 10 to 30%) exhibited prominent symptoms of deper-
sonalization or derealization, and that PTSD severity alone did not 
predict who would manifest these symptoms145.

Close to 20 studies have used latent class or profile analysis a -
cross a range of cohorts differing in age, geographic location, civil-  
 ian status, and primary trauma exposure type, and provided sup-
port for this unique presentation of PTSD146- 149. A recent study com -  
pared  the  fit  of  class  models  (which  directly  support  the  uni-
que group of individuals with the dissociative subtype) to confir-
matory factor models (which would account for the dissociative 
symptoms dimensionally by virtue of their correlation with PTSD 
symptom severity) and factor mixture models (a mix of factors and 
classes) among trauma- exposed veterans. The results indicated 
that, of these three types of models, the subtype structure provided 
the best fit to the data150.

Consistent with this, there is preliminary evidence that the disso-
ciative subtype may be associated with unique biological correlates 
relative to the core symptoms of PTSD. These include genotypes 
that are predictive of the dissociative symptoms after covarying for 
PTSD severity150, and alterations in brain morphology and func-
tion150- 154. However, the implicated brain regions and the nature of  
these alterations have varied greatly across studies150,152,155,156. It 
is also important to note that these studies have generally focused  
on trait dissociation (as opposed to a state of active dissociation), so  
that these alterations may reflect a vulnerability or proclivity to dis-
sociative experiences rather than the neurobiology of an active dis-
sociative experience. In addition to potential biological differences, 
there is also evidence that individuals with the dissociative subtype 
may respond less well to psychotherapy for PTSD157 and to phar-
macological treatment158.

Collectively, these differences in symptom presentation, biolo-
gy and treatment response highlight the importance of delineating 
the dissociative subtype for both research and clinical purposes.

ICD- 11 PTSD and complex PTSD

The ICD- 11 set out to achieve several goals in its definition of 
stress- related disorders. These included maximizing clinical utili-
ty, by making the diagnoses simpler and more focused on core fea-
tures to distinguish them from other disorders; raising the thresh-
old for PTSD relative to the ICD- 10 by including consideration of 
functional impairment; integrating PTSD more successfully with 
the ICD- 10 “enduring personality change after catastrophic expe-
rience” diagnosis; and addressing the perceived need for a diagno-
sis of complex PTSD. The Working Group who developed the pro-
posals included trauma experts from many parts of the globe159.

with these observations, PTSD is defined in the ICD- 11 by three 
sets of symptoms, with one indicator of each being required: a) 
re- experiencing of the event in the here- and- now (presence of 
flashbacks or nightmares); b) avoidance of traumatic reminders  
(avoidance of thoughts and memories or external situations and 
reminders); and c) a sense of current threat (presence of either 
hypervigilance or exaggerated startle response). Symptoms must 
follow an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events,  
last for several weeks, and be accompanied by functional impair-
ment159.

Although those symptoms also appear in the DSM- 5, the ICD- 
11 formulation is narrower and more specific. This is particularly 
true for the re- experiencing cluster. Intrusive thoughts and memo-
ries are found in many disorders. What characterizes PTSD is that 
the intrusive memories have strong sensory elements and are ex-
perienced as happening again in the present61. Like the DSM- 5, 
the ICD- 11 describes flashbacks as existing on a continuum, from 
intrusive memories with a fleeting sense of “nowness” to complete 
absorption in the traumatic memory and loss of awareness of the 
current environment.

The ICD- 11 also includes a separate diagnosis of complex PTSD,  
a more severe condition. This differs in several respects from 
previous formulations of complex PTSD163 and from the ICD- 10 
“enduring personality change after catastrophic experience”164. 
Unlike them, it requires the presence of ICD- 11 PTSD symptoms. 
Another difference is that exposure to chronic or repeated trauma 
is conceptualized as a risk factor, likely to be present but not re-
quired for the diagnosis.

In addition to the three PTSD symptom clusters, the ICD- 11 di-
agnosis of complex PTSD is defined by three further sets of symp-
toms that emerge or intensify following the traumatic event, i.e. 
affective dysregulation, negative self- concept, and disturbances 
in relationships. These symptoms are collectively labelled “dis-
turbances in self- organization”. Symptoms were selected because 
they were frequently reported by participants in the DSM- IV field 
trials of a complex form of PTSD165, and were identified by expert 
clinicians as the most common and impairing in clinical prac-
tice166.

In the ICD- 11, individuals may be diagnosed with PTSD or com  -
plex PTSD, but not both. A PTSD diagnosis implies that the re -
quirements for complex PTSD are not met. The requirements for 
ICD- 11 PTSD or complex PTSD are markedly harder to be met 
than those for ICD- 10 PTSD, and somewhat harder to be fulfilled 
than the DSM- IV or DSM- 5 criteria for PTSD167. Comorbid de-
pression, while still frequent, appears to be less common in PTSD 
diagnosed according to ICD- 11 than DSM- IV or DSM- 5167. Indi-
viduals who qualify for the diagnosis of PTSD according to ICD- 10 
or DSM- 5, but not for the ICD- 11 diagnosis of PTSD or complex 
PTSD, may meet requirements for alternative diagnoses such as 
major depressive disorder.

Attempts to establish the core features of PTSD have most com-  
 monly identified nightmares, flashbacks, exaggerated startle re-
sponse, and hypervigilance62,136,160- 162. Avoidance has been sug-
gested as another essential component of PTSD (even though one 
shared with other anxiety disorders and depression)136. In line 

The distinction between ICD- 11 PTSD and complex PTSD has 
been extensively tested by research167- 170. Confirmatory factor 
analysis carried out in many different cultures has found that 
complex PTSD includes six correlated first- order factors in line 
with the six symptom clusters, and two correlated second- order 

60 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

factors in line with the dimensions of PTSD and disturbances in  
self- organization. Distinct groups with symptom profiles cor re-
sponding to PTSD and complex PTSD have been repeatedly iden-
tified in mixture- modeling studies with disparate groups such as  
children and adolescents, military veterans, refugees, and asylum 
seekers. Those in the complex PTSD class typically report more 
functional impairment than those in the PTSD class.

It is sometimes suggested that complex PTSD is simply a more 
severe form of PTSD171. This possibility is addressed by factor- 
mixture modeling, a technique that combines dimensional and 
categorical analysis. An early study172 reported factor- mixture 
models in two cohorts and found that, after controlling for a gra-
dient of symptom severity, the PTSD and complex PTSD classes 
differed quantitatively but not qualitatively. In contrast, a study of 
refugees found evidence for qualitatively distinct PTSD and com-
plex PTSD classes173. However, both these studies were performed 
before tailored instruments for the assessment of ICD- 11 complex 
PTSD symptoms were available.

Two recent studies utilized the International Trauma Ques-
tionnaire174, specifically developed for ICD- 11 PTSD and complex 
PTSD, to assess symptom structure in a sample of young people 
and one of adults from the general population. Both studies found 
that ICD- 11 PTSD and complex PTSD formed distinct latent class-
es and did not simply differ on a severity dimension175,176. Addi-
tional research employing factor- mixture modeling in large and 
diverse cohorts is needed to further address this question.

The evidence base for ICD- 11 PTSD and complex PTSD now in-
cludes research, predominantly psychometric, carried out in five  
continents. It is not yet known whether these diagnoses will fulfil  
the WHO’s intention of improving the recognition of trauma- relat-
ed disorders. Studies are required that evaluate the relevance and 
practical utility of these diagnoses in different cultural settings, as 
exemplified by research among young people in violent neighbor-
hoods in Brazil177.

Another important issue is to understand why some people re-
ceive a PTSD diagnosis with the DSM- 5 but not with the ICD- 11. 
This could shed valuable light both on the nature of PTSD and on 
the strengths and weaknesses of both systems.

Comparing ICD- 11 and DSM- 5

The ICD- 11 and DSM- 5 approaches to representing post- trau-
matic psychopathology diverge in important ways. While the ICD- 
11 reduced the number of PTSD symptoms (relative to the ICD- 
10) to three core features of the disorder, and encompassed other 
enduring post- traumatic responses in the diagnosis of complex 
PTSD, the DSM- 5 increased the number of symptom clusters (to 
4) and symptoms (to 20) under the PTSD criteria.

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The DSM- 
 5 attempts to represent a greater breadth of symptoms under one 
diagnosis, and includes more items per symptom cluster, which 
allows for greater reliability178. However, the inclusion of more non- 
specific diagnostic criteria that are characteristic of generalized 
distress (e.g., chronic mood disturbance, distorted negative cogni-

tions, sleep and concentration difficulties) may artificially inflate 
diagnostic comorbidity and introduce redundancy into the diag-
nostic taxonomy across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders.

In contrast, the ICD- 11 approach is streamlined in its focus on 
the core and perhaps defining features of PTSD, but may fail to 
identify some individuals who experience alternative manifesta-
tions of post- traumatic psychopathology. For example, there may 
be some intrusive traumatic memories that do not meet the defi-
nition of flashbacks or nightmares. Given the transdiagnostic na-
ture of intrusive memories, and the need for accurate assessment 
to differentiate them from rumination about the causes or conse-
quences of a traumatic experience, additional research is needed 
to determine whether such manifestations are best considered as 
indicative of PTSD or as part of other disorders such as major de-
pression.

In contrast to the DSM- 5, the ICD- 11 does not include a disso-
ciative subtype of PTSD or complex PTSD. However, one of the two  
ways by which an individual can meet the ICD- 11 re- experiencing 
criterion is by having flashbacks, which are generally regarded as 
dissociative experiences. Further, affective dysregulation can be 
manifested as emotional numbing, which can be an expression of 
dissociation wherein an individual is separated from his/her own 
emotional experience. Thus, dissociation is actually represented 
in the current ICD- 11 criteria. There is also evidence that indi-
viduals with complex PTSD may be particularly prone to dissoci-
ation179,180, perhaps in relation to childhood trauma exposure181.

Additional research is needed to determine if dissociative ex-
periences are a core component of PTSD or complex PTSD, or 
are evident only in a unique subgroup of individuals with these 
conditions. The definition of dissociation employed will impact 
the results of research addressing this question, as some forms of 
dissociation (such as reduction in awareness of experience) are 
common and appear to covary linearly with PTSD symptom se-
verity, while other forms (such as derealization and depersonali-
zation) are far less common and are not strongly correlated with 
PTSD severity145.

PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF PTSD

PTSD involves many different psychological processes, includ-
ing attention, causal and other beliefs, affective reactions, coping 
strategies, and social interactions182. However, psychological theo-
ries of PTSD have mostly focused on disturbances to memory for 
the traumatic event and on the impact of the event on the survi-
vors’ identity, in particular the way in which they conceptualize 
and experience the self.

Trauma memory disturbance

Many different aspects of memory are affected in PTSD. When 
it comes to non- trauma- related material, people with this disorder 
have difficulty learning and remembering new items, particularly 
verbal items; their working memory functions less well; when giv-

en the task of recalling specific personal experiences to cue words, 
they tend to retrieve examples that are overgeneral in that they are 
repeated or last more than one day; they are also more prone to as-
sociative memory illusions183. However, more pertinent is the way 
in which memory for the person’s traumatic experiences functions 
– this is central to psychological theories of PTSD and to the aims 
of psychological therapy.

Enhanced re- experiencing

The most distressing and disruptive form of re- experiencing 
of the traumatic event in PTSD consists of flashbacks. These are 
usually brief and involve a few specific scenes, although they may 
involve a series of scenes that are experienced as like a video-
tape184,185. They contain very prominent sensory elements, as well 
as emotions and bodily sensations – such as heat, cold or pain – 
that were part of the traumatic event186, and cannot be retrieved 
deliberately as ordinary autobiographical memories can. Anoth-
er way in which they differ from ordinary memories is that there 
is a distortion in the sense of time, whereby they are to a greater or 
lesser degree re- experienced in the present or here- and- now187- 189 
rather than as belonging to the past.

Re- experiencing trauma memories in this way is predictive of 
the course of the disorder over and above the overall symptom se-
verity190,191. With treatment, intrusive memories of the traumatic 
event become less vivid, less distressing, and have less of a sense of 
being relived in the present192,193.

Less commonly, there may be intrusive images that are partly 
based on the traumatic event but contain fantasy elements such 
as “what could have happened”, as well as images that are entirely 
based on imagination194,195. There may also be involuntary auto-
biographical memories of aspects of the traumatic event that are 
experienced as belonging wholly to the past. Compared to flash-
backs, much less is known about the significance of these intru-
sions and how best to treat them.

Impaired voluntary recall

Trauma clinicians are familiar with PTSD patients reporting 
puzzling gaps in their memories for the index event(s) or, more fre-
quently, difficulty in constructing a coherent and ordered narrative. 
It is not uncommon for significant details to be recalled, apparently 
for the first time, during the course of psychological therapy196. More-
over, impairments in voluntary trauma memory have been found 
consistently to be related to self- reported dissociation, either during 
or after the traumatic event, and to predict the course of PTSD197.

Studies of coherence and disorganization in trauma memories 
have mostly used three types of measurement. First, respondents 
rate the overall amount of fragmentation or disorganization in 
their own memories, or write trauma narratives that are rated by 
themselves or independent judges. Second, similar overall mea-
sures assess narrative coherence, on the assumption that this is 
the opposite of fragmentation and disorganization. Third, trauma 

narratives are divided into individual utterance units, and raters 
assess linguistic markers of disorganization and fragmentation 
such as repetition and non- consecutive chunks.

There has been disagreement over whether these studies do197 
or do not198 provide evidence for greater fragmentation or disorga-
nization in the trauma narratives of PTSD patients compared to 
healthy controls. A recent meta- analysis199 found that there is a sig-
nificant association of moderate size between PTSD and fragment-
ed trauma narratives. However, this is qualified by the methods 
used. Measures that assess disorganization and fragmentation di-
rectly, whether by self- ratings or judge ratings, show a strong asso-
ciation, but measures that define them as an absence of coherence 
show little if any association. This indicates that a narrative may 
be clearly disorganized in parts, perhaps during the most terrify-
ing moments, without necessarily affecting elements of coherence 
such as having an overall story with a logical structure that makes 
sense.

Theoretical perspectives

Encoding of context

Some cognitive accounts of PTSD see the condition as re flect-  
 ing the operation of normal episodic, or more specifically au to bio-
graph ical, memory200,201. These accounts propose that – after trau-
matic events – factors such as the memory’s emotional intensity, its 
tendency to come repeatedly to mind, and its salience all strength-
en the accessibility of a memory, the links with its associated con-
text, and its ease of retrieval. Although these theories can account 
for many aspects of PTSD, the evidence for memory fragmentation 
and disorganization is counter to their predictions.

In contrast, clinical theories of PTSD have often incorporated the  
idea that contextual information is less strongly, not more strong  -
ly, associated with the traumatic stimuli. In conditioning theories, 
a process of stimulus generalization is thought to affect elements 
of the traumatic situation, such that similar stimuli encountered in 
dissimilar contexts act as reminders and lead to the return of the 
fear memory202. According to another model, the traumatic event 
alters the way in which contextual information is represented. For 
example, following an unexpected attack, many situations previ-
ously regarded as safe now become unsafe, so that a wide range of 
environmental cues can potentially trigger a fear memory203.

Other clinical theories emphasize that, in PTSD, frightening or 
horrific moments are poorly elaborated, not fully situated in time 
and place, and inadequately integrated into the person’s general 
autobiographical knowledge61,204. These clinical theories have 
much in common with biological models that also associate PTSD 
with impairments in the learning of context205,206.

Single versus multiple representational formats

Several authors have attributed the symptoms of PTSD to an 
ex cep tionally strongly encoded trauma memory in a single repre-

62 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

sentational format. An influential perspective203,207 holds that the 
trauma memory representations take the form of highly associ-
ated networks containing stimulus, response and meaning ele-
ments. The activation of any element, for example by encounter-
ing a trauma reminder, then activates all the elements in the net-
work, leading to a re- experiencing of the event.

Although these theories explain many aspects of PTSD, they 
cannot readily account for the subjective distinction that people 
with PTSD make between involuntary phenomena, such as flash-
backs, and ordinary memories that are easily retrieved, reflected 
upon, and communicated to others208. In contrast, dual repre-
sentation theory61 explicitly posits that traumatic events are en-
coded separately in a lower- level, image- based memory system 
governed by associative principles, and in a fully contextualized 
episodic memory system. Under normal conditions these systems 
are well integrated, but extreme fear, helplessness or horror causes 
the balance to shift, so that sensation- near images are strongly en-
coded while contextualized representations are weakened, failing 
to provide a context for re- experiencing. This model accounts for 
the fact that people with PTSD can appraise and provide linguistic 
accounts of many aspects of their trauma, while being unable to 
control the re- experiencing of specific moments.

Similarly, the cognitive model of PTSD204 refers to the existence  
of parallel data- driven and conceptual processing during traumat ic 
events. Data- driven processing is a lower- level form of processing 
and is associated with automatic, cue- driven retrieval of trauma 
memories and enhanced perceptual priming, defined as a reduced 
perceptual threshold for trauma- related sensory stimuli. Concep-
tual processing is language- based and is associated with the con-
scious appraisal of traumatic events and their sequelae.

Although differing in their emphasis on representations versus 
processes, both the cognitive model and the dual representation 
theory posit lower- level associative memories and higher- order, 
language- based memories of traumatic events141.

Identity disturbance

Identity is a construct that spans past and future, summarizing 
previous experience but also projecting into the years that remain  
to be lived. Objective identity, or the Me- self, consists of a person’s 
perception of his/her own traits and characteristics. Subjective 
 iden   tity, or the I- self, consists of the person’s experience, including 
the emotional and bodily states that accompany feelings such as 
pride, shame or guilt.

The way in which people have been treated, and are being treat-
ed, by family, friends, teachers, colleagues, employers, and the wid-
er community shapes their perceptions of who they are and what 
they can expect from social relationships. Not surprisingly, the 
quality of social relationships post- trauma is one of the strongest 
predictors of PTSD, with criticism or verbal attack being particu-
larly detrimental94,142,209.

Identity is multi- faceted, deriving from each person’s physical 
and mental attributes, from the many different experiences in the 
multiple roles that the person plays (e.g., child, sibling, student, 

employee) and the situations that he/she encounters (work, fam-
ily, school, interactions within own community, interactions with 
different communities), and from his/her goals and aspirations.  
Individuals differ in the degree to which these different facets are  
perceived to be integrated into a whole, with early childhood 
trauma making this process harder210. Some of these facets will 
correspond to identities that attract social stigma, whether or not 
this is observable to others211. Internalized stigma is the process by 
which people apply negative stereotypes to themselves, and ex-
pect to be rejected by others212. It is normal to try to manage one’s 
identity by strengthening the positive, desired aspects and avoid-
ing the negative or feared aspects coming to mind213.

The impact of the traumatic event on the Me- self of the indi-
vidual with PTSD has been regarded as a major feature of the con-
dition from the very beginning. The event is frequently seen as  
bringing about drastic negative changes in the person’s percep-
tion of him/herself, other people, and his/her future, that are of-
ten viewed as permanent214,215, and can become a central turning 
point in the person’s autobiographical narrative216.

The event can cause disruptions in beliefs about core social ex-
pectations of safety, trust, power, esteem and intimacy217. It can be 
seen as challenging long- held assumptions that the self is basically 
worthy and that other people have benevolent intentions218. Alter-
natively, it may strongly reinforce existing concerns about the self 
and others, created by processes such as self- stigmatization and 
previous exposure to adversity207.

It has been argued that survivors respond to these challenges in 
a number of different ways219. The situation may be reinterpreted 
in a distorted way, so that it can be assimilated into existing be-
liefs. For example, someone with a prior belief that bad things only 
happen to bad people may conclude that he/she must have done 
something wrong for the traumatic event to have occurred. Over- 
accommodation takes place when the event is followed by a com-
plete abandonment of the pre- existing belief and the adoption of 
a new, extreme variant. For example, after an unexpected assault, 
someone may adopt the belief that nowhere is safe for him/her 
and no one is to be trusted.

Identity- related perceptions in PTSD, such as self- blame and 
holding others to be untrustworthy, have been suggested to derive 
from deep- seated beliefs of the form “I am totally incompetent” or 
“The world is completely dangerous”207. People already holding 
such rigid negative views may have them confirmed by negative 
appraisals of the traumatic event, of symptoms that developed af-
terwards, of interference with successful functioning, and of others’ 
responses.

A focus on negative beliefs and cognitions plays a central role 
in the cognitive theory of PTSD204. Individuals may blame them-
selves for the event happening, for their reactions or behaviors 
during or after the event, or for the symptoms that they develop 
subsequently. They may perceive that the event has led to a perma-
nent change for the worse220. These appraisals predict the course 
of the disorder, often over and above initial symptoms190,221,222, as 
well as driving symptom change in PTSD therapy223,224. Identity- 
protective responses such as thought suppression, rumination, 
and safety behaviors (i.e., actions aimed to prevent the occurrence 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025 

63

of a feared outcome or reduce associated distress) appear to main-
tain the disorder141.

In PTSD, changes to the I- self are also routinely observed. It is 
common for people to experience their body differently, for exam-
ple with areas of medically unexplained pain179,225,226; to feel that 
their character or body is worthless or shameful227- 229; to experi-
ence themselves as defeated, empty or even dead204,230; and to feel 
alienated from others231.

Veterans with PTSD frequently report the experience of shame  
232, as well as feelings of disconnection from the civilian world  
233. One factor that is sometimes involved is moral injury, an ex-
perience of powerful negative emotions arising from the per-
son’s sense of having violated his/her own moral standards, or 
of  having been betrayed by others234. Moral injury is common to 
a wide range of professions, including emergency services and 
health care workers235, and is an important predictor of PTSD 
symptoms in former military samples236.

The Memory and Identity theory168 proposes that alterations 
in both the Me- self and the I- self are central to complex PTSD. 
Traumatic events confirm and prompt the reactivation of prior 
negative identities emerging due to childhood adversity, leading 
to a more pervasive and negative sense of self. The re- enactment 
of situations in which the self was experienced as worthless or in-
ferior is linked to pervasive negative self- concept symptoms. Re- 
enactment of the self being abandoned, betrayed and/or alien-
ated from others is linked to the disturbed relationship symptoms. 
Re- enactment of all these selves, and of experiencing being frag-
mented or non- existent, may foster the development of emotion 
regulation problems.

The theory further posits that chronic or repeated traumatic 
events may also create new negative identities, even in the absence  
of childhood adversity. For example, exposure to extreme situa-
tions such as torture can result not only in pain and suffering, but 
in de  humanization, degradation, and emotional isolation237. The 
repeated humiliation, criticism, and body shaming that are fre  -
quently part of intimate partner violence have been argued to be 
attempts to destroy positive identities and replace them with a 
sense of worthlessness238,239. War and genocide may also involve 
the conscious attempt to destroy the cultural identity of an entire 
population240.

Identity is also an important element of Conservation of Re-
sources theory, a general theory holding that stress emerges in 
response to actual, or threatened, loss of resources241,242. Among 
the many types of resources, some of the most important are the 
physical (e.g., housing), the social (e.g., family and community 
support), and the structural (e.g., employment) ones. Numerous 
studies have found an increased occurrence of PTSD to be associ-
ated with traumatic events producing greater resource loss243,244, 
and recovery to be predicted by resource gains245. This theory 
makes the important point that resource loss is critical to survival, 
social attachments, and social status. It thus generally threatens 
core aspects of the individual’s Me- self and I- self, and often the 
identity of the family and wider group in which the individual is 
embedded.

Delayed- onset PTSD

The mnemonic model of PTSD suggests that the disorder arises 
not from the traumatic event itself but from the memory of that 
event52. Delayed- onset PTSD illustrates that in some cases the 
traumatic memory does indeed appear to change over time, for 
example becoming more distressing and intrusive.

There has been little investigation of the foundations of this form 
of PTSD. One study that compared immediate and delayed on sets 
in military veterans232 found that the number of respondents re-
porting depression and alcohol abuse before the main trauma in 
service was significantly greater in the delayed- onset group. The 
two groups described similar amounts of military trauma expo-
sure, but those in the delayed- onset group reported significantly 
less peri- traumatic dissociation, anger and shame. The delayed- 
onset group also reported a gradual accumulation of symptoms 
that continued throughout their military career, with an excess of 
other stressors unrelated to their traumatic event occurring in the 
year preceding their onset.

If replicated, these findings suggest that many delayed onsets 
involve a more general stress sensitivity and a progressive failure 
to adapt to continued stress exposure, rather than an experience of 
being overwhelmed by reactions to a specific event. It may be use-
ful to consider biological processes that could explain the gradual 
build- up of cumulative stress effects, such as kindling or sensiti-
zation.

A small group of delayed onsets appears to occur in the absence 
of previous symptoms. These may reflect new circumstances that 
prevent reminders of a traumatic event being avoided, changes in 
the meaning of individual traumatic events over time, or the de-
velopment of a neurological or cognitive impairment that prevents 
unwanted memories being inhibited.

Implications

Of the two most central disturbances in PTSD, one involves ex-
cessive intrusion and fragmentation in traumatic memories, so 
that the person experiences a marked lack of control over when  
they come to mind, and over the emotional and physiological con   -
sequences of this occurring. The other involves sometimes pro-
found experiences of the self as being defeated, morally reprehen-
sible, divorced from others, and sometimes as barely existing. Both 
disturbances often involve experiences, such as psychic and somat-
ic dissociation, that are not integrated with the sense of self. These 
disturbances, and the compensatory behaviors adopted to mitigate 
them, are the main focus of psychological therapies, but are as yet 
poorly understood.

There is an urgent need for more phenomenological research to 
describe these core experiences in more detail. For example, little 
if anything is known about the extent to which intrusive mem    o    ries 
during an episode of PTSD include images of prior trau    mas as well 
as the index event, or how repeated events are represented. Bio-
logical research, especially neuroimaging, also has an important 

64 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

role to play, and has produced preliminary findings supporting  
the theoretical position that traumatic memories are fundamental-
ly different from ordinary episodic memories246,247. Disturbances 
in the sense of self, such as feeling the self to be fragmented or 
non- existent, have been linked to altered functioning in the default 
mode network248.

the same time inflammation may increase risk of PTSD258,259.

The findings concerning inflammation raise a key question rel-
evant to many areas of PTSD biological research: most studies are 
cross- sectional, and it is not clear whether the observed findings 
– be they related to inflammation, cortisol secretion, or autonomic 
nervous system dysfunction – reflect a vulnerability for PTSD, are 
acquired because of developing PTSD, or perhaps both.

BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF PTSD

Biological research on PTSD has expanded significantly in the 
past decade249. Several reviews on specific aspects of PTSD biology 
have been published in the last five years, including on inflamma-
tion250, the immune system251, neural circuits252, biomarkers253, 
and the microbiome254. In this section, we touch on a few areas that  
have been recently the subject of meta- analysis, and then sum    ma-
rize more deeply key findings in the fields of genomics and neuro-
imaging, which have advanced exponentially over the past decade 
through large multi- site studies producing robust and replicable 
findings. Preliminary findings in the areas of epigenomics and 
other “omics” are also considered.

Motivated by clinical observations of some of the core features 
of PTSD, such as exaggerated startle response and reactivity to trau  -
ma- related reminders, many of the early rigorous empirical studies 
on PTSD biology were focused on the autonomic nervous sys-
tem. These included key findings of increased heart rate and skin 
conductance, as well as facial electromyography reactivity, during 
traumatic script- driven imagery and during exposure to trauma- 
related stimuli in persons with PTSD249. A recent meta- analysis255 
reinforced these findings, concluding that PTSD is associated with 
autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Persons with PTSD were 
found to have significantly higher heart rate and lower heart rate 
variability (i.e., variation in time between heartbeats), both at rest 
and during stress paradigms.

The role of hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis altera-
tions in PTSD has also been an active area of research for many de-     
cades. Early findings suggested a differentiation in findings be-
tween PTSD and depression, with the former characterized by 
over- sensitization, and the latter by dysregulation of the axis256. 
However, findings from individual studies have been inconsistent. 
A recent meta- analysis reported that morning and 24- hour cortisol 
levels were lower, while evening dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 
levels were higher, in PTSD subjects than controls, but concluded 
that there was not a consistent pattern of HPA axis alteration in 
PTSD257.

The robust association of PTSD with chronic diseases – including 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and autoimmune conditions –  
has motivated studies of the role of inflammation and oxidative 
stress in PTSD biology. A recent systematic review and meta- 
analysis258 found that C- reactive protein, interleukin 6, and tumor 
necrosis factor- alpha were elevated in persons with PTSD versus 
controls. In contrast, oxidative stress markers were not associated 
with the disorder. The association between PTSD and inflamma-
tion appears to be bi- directional. Thus, it may be a mechanism 
through which PTSD increases risk of chronic diseases, while at 

Genomics

Genetic factors are appealing for biological research on PTSD 
due to temporality. That is, an individual’s DNA sequence is es-
tablished at conception and therefore must precede the develop-
ment of PTSD. Unlike many other biomarkers, a DNA sequence 
cannot be a consequence of developing the disorder. Genetic 
factors may increase the risk for PTSD through at least two path-
ways: increasing the likelihood of experiencing a traumatic event 
and increasing the risk of developing PTSD following trauma. 
Twin studies have shown that both the experience of trauma and 
PTSD are heritable, meaning that both are influenced by genetic 
factors260,261.

Genetic risk for experiencing trauma and/or developing PTSD 
is not limited to a handful of genetic variants but is highly poly-
genic, with thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
contributing to risk262. Here we focus on major findings related to 
PTSD risk. The role of genetic factors in trauma exposure263 and 
how trauma influences genetic risk for PTSD264 are discussed else-
where.

Identifying causal SNPs requires the use of genome- wide asso-
ciation studies (GWAS) while accounting for genetic influences on 
trauma exposure265. Very large sample sizes are necessary to con-
duct GWAS in complex disorders such as PTSD, which led to the 
creation of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium -  PTSD Working 
Group (PGC- PTSD). This combined studies of PTSD with genetic 
data from around the world266. Understanding of the genetics of 
PTSD has also advanced through the Million Veterans Program 
(MVP)267. Together, the PGC- PTSD and the MVP have produced 
four robust genetic findings for PTSD.

First, the most recent GWAS, which combined data from the 
PGC- PTSD and MVP, included over 1.2 million participants and 
150,000 PTSD cases. They identified 95 loci associated with PTSD, 
in genes related to neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic 
plasticity modulators; developmental, axon guidance and tran-
scription factors; synaptic structure and function; and endocrine 
and immune regulators268.

Second, SNP- based heritability of PTSD from PGC- PTSD and 
MVP ranges from 0.053 to 0.092267,268. No significant differences in 
the SNP- based heritability of PTSD were found between male and 
female subsets.

Third, PGC- PTSD and MVP analyses produced a robust poly-
genic risk score for PTSD. This score is created by summing the 
number of risk alleles for a participant weighted by the alleles’ 
effect estimates. Participants in the highest quintile of polygenic 
risk scores for PTSD were found to have 2.4 times the relative risk 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025 

65

for PTSD compared to individuals in the lowest quintile268. Overall, 
the polygenic risk score explained 6.6% of the variance in PTSD268.
Fourth, PTSD was found to be genetically correlated with at-
ten tion- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol dependence, an-
orex ia nervosa, autism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disor-
der, obsessive- compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette’s 
syndrome268. As found in previous studies269,270, PTSD and major 
depressive disorder were highly correlated. However, their genetic 
correlation varied with the population and method of assessment 
of PTSD. Genetic correlations between PTSD and major depres-
sion from a military cohort were around one- third lower than from 
an electronic health records- based cohort268.

There are several limitations to our current genetic knowledge 
of PTSD. Addressing these limitations is necessary to translate ge-
netic associations to causal biology, which remains an ongoing 
effort252,271,272.

First, the latest PGC- PTSD results were not conditional on life-
time trauma exposure, which previous analyses have found to al-
ter SNP- PTSD associations, as the genetic loci may increase risk 
for trauma exposure rather than PTSD270. This makes it difficult to 
disentangle risk for experiencing trauma and risk for PTSD.

Second, current GWAS combine cohorts that assess lifetime and 
current PTSD, thus losing the ability to determine if the identified 
genes are relevant to onset or course. Moreover, the latest and larg-
est GWAS of PTSD used a simple case- control definition of PTSD 
based on ICD codes from electronic health records for around two- 
thirds of participants, rather than a validated scale measuring each 
PTSD symptom267,268,273. Including participants with less- validated 
diagnoses is necessary for GWAS, as large numbers of participants 
are needed274. However, this also further increases the heteroge-
neity of PTSD case status. Lack of precision in PTSD diagnosis also 
likely inflates genetic correlation with other mental disorders such 
as major depression.

Third, GWAS of PTSD have focused primarily on participants 
of European ancestry. Recent work on polygenic risk scores in 
PTSD275- 277 shows limited cross- population transferability and, by 
extension, poorer performance in populations from other parts of 
the world. Until this inequity is corrected, there is also a significant 
risk that the recent advances in PTSD genetics will result in a wid-
ening of the massive research and treatment disparities. This ineq-
uity is particularly troubling given the disproportionately high bur-
den of trauma and PTSD faced by under- represented populations. 
For example, African Americans face a higher burden of PTSD 
driven by higher levels of exposure to violence at younger ages278.

MAD1L1, and TBXAS1 to be associated with PTSD279- 281,286.

PTSD has also been associated with two epigenetic markers of 
accelerated biological age: shorter telomere length and older DNA 
methylation estimated age.

Telomeres are repeating patterns of DNA at the end of chromo-
somes that protect DNA during cell division and whose shortening 
leads to apoptosis of cells287,288. Shorter telomere length is consid-
ered a marker of biological age289, as it has been associated with 
mortality290. Recent meta- analyses have found PTSD to be associ-
ated with shorter telomere length291,292.

DNA methylation has also been used to estimate biological age. 
Older estimated biological age is associated with mortality and 
chronic diseases293- 296. PTSD has been associated with accelerat-
ed DNA methylation age297, although these studies have primarily 
been conducted in cross- sectional military samples298- 305.

Finally, building on efforts in depression306, the PGC- PTSD 
Working Group is creating methylation risk scores to predict risk for  
PTSD by combining DNA methylation associations from across 
the genome, as is done with polygenic risk scores307.

Other “omics”

Other “omic” methods focus on the downstream products of  
genetic and epigenetic factors to identify biological pathways that  
differentiate PTSD cases from controls. In the largest meta- anal-
ysis to date, differential gene expression has been observed for in- 
           terleukin- 1 beta (a pro- inflammatory cytokine previously associ-
ated with PTSD) and integrin- linked kinase (which is expressed in 
the brain and associated with dysregulation of the hippocampus) 
308. Another study had also found differential expression in anoth-
er hippocampus- related gene (DSCAM)309. Beyond elucidating 
biological  pathways,  differential  gene  expression  profiles  (i.e., 
combinations of differentially expressed genes) have been used to 
predict PTSD, and have been reported to be a potential screening 
tool for the disorder310.

Proteomic studies, which focus on identifying and quantifying 
proteins that are critical for every aspect of cellular life, have detect-
ed biological pathways associated with PTSD including immune 
response and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. They have 
been used to create composite risk scores predictive of PTSD311,312. 
Finally, an emerging area for PTSD biological research is metabo-
lomics, although to date studies have focused on a small number of 
candidate metabolites, with inconsistent patterns of association313.

Epigenomics

Neuroimaging

While a person’s DNA sequence is established at conception, 
how genes work can be influenced by many epigenetic factors. The 
most commonly studied measure of epigenetics in PTSD research 
has been DNA methylation, which modifies gene expression by 
binding a methyl group to DNA, usually at cytosine- guanine dinu-
cleotides279- 285. Epigenome- wide association studies of blood have 
found changes in DNA methylation in the genes NRG1, AHRR, 

Many studies have examined structural and functional neural 
alterations associated with PTSD, primarily using magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI). Given the sample sizes required to observe 
small neuroimaging effects, and the need to adjust for multiple 
testing across brain voxels and regions, the most convincing work 
in this area is derived from a more limited number of large- scale  
consortia studies, such as the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genet-

66 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

ics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) collaboration314, which in-
cludes a PTSD Workgroup with relevant data from thousands of 
individuals.

This work has suggested PTSD- related differences in subcor-
tical structural brain parameters, including smaller hippocampal 
volume315 and reduced microstructural integrity of the tapetum 
area of the corpus callosum (which connects right and left hippo-
campus)316. Cortical brain structures have also been implicated in 
PTSD by consortium data (i.e., reduced volume of lateral orbito-
frontal gyri bilaterally317).

Smaller studies and meta- analyses involving hundreds of indi-
viduals have suggested that PTSD is associated with thinner cor-
tical tissue in the right fusiform gyrus318, and reduced gray matter 
in prefrontal (anterior cingulate and ventromedial) and temporal 
cortical regions319.

Meta- analytic studies of resting state functional connectivity  
parameters have revealed increased connectivity in the ventral 
anterior cingulate and parahippocampus/amygdala regions, and 
decreased connectivity in the posterior insula, cerebellar pyramis, 
and middle frontal gyrus. This is thought to reflect PTSD- associated 
decreased default mode network activity (associated with inter-
nally focused mentalization and self- reflection) and increased sa-
lience network connectivity (associated with attention to external 
stimuli)320,321.

Like many other biological investigations of PTSD, most neuro-
imaging studies are unable to determine if the structural or func-
tional alterations that are observed represent risk factors for PTSD 
or consequences of the disorder, or if they could be relevant to un-
derstanding the chronicity of symptoms and the likelihood of pos-
itive treatment response. Research has only just begun to address 
these questions. For example, there is some evidence from longi-
tudinal studies that the smaller hippocampal volume identified in 
individuals with PTSD represents a stable vulnerability factor for 
the disorder322.

This conceptualization is further supported by studies of in-
dividuals who undergo MRI shortly after trauma exposure. The 
following neural parameters are predictive of future PTSD (over 
3- 14 months) when measured shortly after trauma exposure, sug-
gesting that they represent premorbid vulnerability factors: a) less 
functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex and the arousal network (primarily defined by limbic struc-
tures); b) greater connectivity between the right inferior temporal 
gyrus and the default mode network; c) reduced right hypotha-
lamic volume; d) greater activation of the inferior frontal gyrus 
while performing an emotion modulation task; and e) hyperac-
tivation of the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during 
threat- related tasks323- 326.

However, in some of these studies of adult trauma exposure, 
individuals had also experienced childhood trauma, raising the 
possibility that the predictive results may have been confounded 
by trauma- related psychiatric symptoms that pre- dated the adult 
trauma exposure326. Further, failure to replicate associations be-
tween post- trauma task- based brain activation and future symp-
toms raises doubt about the utility of neural parameters for pre-
dicting chronicity of symptoms327.

Other studies have reported evidence for the reverse direction 
of association. A study of 254 veterans found that PTSD symptoms 
at baseline were associated with greater cortical degeneration over 
the course of two years. This effect was augmented among older 
veterans, suggesting that older individuals may be more neurolo-
gically vulnerable to the deleterious effects of traumatic stress328.

Implications

There are at least four future directions or next steps for biologi-
cal research on PTSD. First, except for genetic studies focused on 
DNA sequence variation, the majority of biological investigations 
are not designed to test whether biological factors increase risk of 
PTSD or are a consequence of developing the disorder. Second, 
most studies use a case- control design and, as a result, provide lim-
ited information on how biological factors may predict course or 
trajectories of PTSD. Third, because of the large numbers of sub-
jects needed for robust findings, consortium analyses tend to pool 
heterogeneous PTSD diagnoses and populations, which leaves 
questions about whether different PTSD presentations are related 
to biological variation. Finally, some populations, especially those 
from low-  and middle- income countries, have been neglected in 
PTSD biological research. This has been noted in genetic studies of 
PTSD, but is also the case in other areas. The result is limited knowl-
edge of how biological factors related to PTSD may be shaped by 
context.

PREVENTION

The requirement of exposure to a traumatic event with specific 
characteristics appears to lend itself to the development of effec-
tive preventive strategies for PTSD. Unfortunately, despite consid-
erable efforts, we are a long way from being able to prevent people 
from developing the disorder.

A systematic review329 identified six randomized controlled tri-
als (RCTs) considering pre- incident prevention, within the con text 
of exposure to combat trauma (five trials) or to fire and emergency- 
services trauma (one trial). Various interventions were investigat-
ed, including attention bias modification training330 and stress in-
oculation training331. The only statistically significant finding was in 
favor of attention bias modification training over a no- intervention 
control for the prevention of the development of PTSD after com-
bat trauma330, although replication is clearly required.

The same review identified 75 RCTs of post- incident preven-
tive interventions329. These were separated into those that were 
conducted over a single session and those delivered over multiple 
sessions.

Two interventions in the single- session group were found to be 
superior to no- intervention: single- session eye movement desen-
sitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and the Group 512 Psycho-
logical Intervention Model, an intervention for military personnel 
based on debriefing but supplemented with cohesion training332. 
Despite significant concerns around the quality of these studies

and the risk of bias, the positive signals from them should not be 
ignored, and both interventions appear to be good candidates for 
further evaluation.

Among multiple- session interventions, only brief dyadic ther-
apy333 and self- guided Internet- based cognitive- behavior therapy 
(CBT)334 were superior to no- intervention/care as usual, again 
with significant concerns about study quality and risk of bias.

As to multiple- session interventions for people with emerging 
symptoms but without a diagnosis of PTSD (indicated preven-
tion), stepped/collaborative care, brief CBT with a trauma focus 
(TF- CBT), EMDR, and Internet- based guided self- help were supe-
rior to no- intervention/care as usual, with the strongest evidence 
for stepped/collaborative care and brief TF- CBT329.

The International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) 
guidelines335 used the above results to identify Group 512 Psycho-
logical Intervention Model and EMDR as single- session interven-
tions, and brief dyadic therapy and self- guided Internet- based 
CBT as multiple- session interventions with emerging evidence 
for the prevention of PTSD. TF- CBT, cognitive therapy, and EMDR 
were recommended as multiple- session early treatment options, 
although the level of recommendation for them as preventive inter-
ventions was “standard”, as opposed to the “strong” recommenda-
tion given to them for the treatment of established PTSD. Stepped/
collaborative care was identified as an “intervention with low ef-
fect”, while Internet- based guided self- help and structured writing 
interventions were rated as having emerging evidence.

The guidelines also considered RCTs of pharmacological in-
terventions to prevent PTSD, and found hydrocortisone to be the 
only drug that was superior to a placebo control condition, which 
resulted in its rating as an intervention with emerging evidence.

For the prevention of PTSD in children and adolescents, the 
guidelines found emerging evidence for self- directed online psy-
choeducation for caregivers and children and for children alone, 
and emerging evidence not to recommend individual psychologi-
cal debriefing for children and adolescents.

The latest US Department of Veterans Affairs and Department 
of Defense (VA/DoD) guidelines336 state that “for the prevention of 
PTSD among individuals who have been exposed to trauma, there 
is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against psychother-
apy or pharmacotherapy in the immediate post- trauma period”.

The disappointing results of research to date mean that our fo-
cus should be on developing more effective preventive interven-
tions, and on subjecting those with emerging evidence to more 
rigorous evaluation. There are also some interesting novel devel-
opments with respect to early intervention, including the emer-
gence of interventions with a purported mechanism of consolida-
tion/reconsolidation of traumatic memories337.

The current evidence strongly suggests that, pending the emer-
gence of more effective universal and selective preventive inter-
ventions, a focus on practical pragmatic support delivered in an 
empathic manner may be the best way forward, coupled with the  
raising of societal awareness of PTSD to facilitate the early identi-
fication of people who would benefit from evidence- based treat-
ment338.

TREATMENT

In the last two decades, there has been a significant increase 
in the number of RCTs completed and in the types of treatment 
evaluated for PTSD. The systematic reviews that led to the ISTSS 
guidelines identified 361 RCTs339.

The main treatments developed and evaluated to date can be 
clas sified as either psychological or pharmacological, but there are  
an increasing number of interventions, such as transcranial mag-
netic stimulation and yoga, that cannot be readily classified as ei-
ther. There is also considerable interest in the development of phar-
macologically assisted psychotherapy.

Another developing paradigm concerns alternative methods of 
delivering established approaches to treatment. Examples are guid-
ed Internet- based programs of TF- CBT340, digital therapies such as 
capnometry- guided respiratory intervention341, and support tools 
such as PTSD Coach (https:// www. ptsd. va. gov/ appvid/ mobile).

The wide range of treatment approaches advocated for PTSD 
is to be welcomed, but brings with it challenges, not least in terms 
of evaluating the evidence available for different treatments and 
ac curately determining their true effectiveness. Moreover, very lit-
tle research has been done on matching individual persons with  
PTSD to the most effective treatments for them. This is further 
complicated by powerful lobbies for different approaches, poten-
tial conflicts of interests, the challenge of grouping related treat-
ments in a meaningful way, and generalizing results from one 
population to another. These challenges are, of course, not unique 
to PTSD, but are important to remember.

The current evidence base for the treatment of PTSD is much 
stronger than ever before, but it is vital to acknowledge that there 
remain major gaps in our knowledge. Although several treatments 
have been shown to be effective for people with PTSD, exactly how 
effective they are, who is likely to benefit from them, and who can 
deliver them are all up for debate. It is also clear that the treatments 
with the strongest evidence do not work for everyone, are relative-
ly costly to deliver in terms of time and other resources, and have 
been challenging to disseminate, so that we need to identify more 
effective treatments in the future.

Psychological treatments

Psychological treatments for PTSD are commonly described as 
either trauma- focused or non- trauma- focused approaches. The 
former are by far the most researched. Within this group, TF- CBTs 
have been studied more than any other form of treatment. These 
include TF- CBT for children and adolescents342, prolonged expo-
sure therapy343, cognitive processing therapy344, cognitive therapy 
for PTSD345, and more recently written exposure therapy346. Al-
though clearly drawing on a wider range of therapeutic approach-
es, a number of other interventions have also been grouped as 
TF- CBTs (e.g., brief eclectic psychotherapy347, narrative exposure 
therapy348,349, and skills training in affective and interpersonal reg-
ulation with narrative exposure350).

68 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

Although the relative emphases and exact methods vary, TF- 
CBTs tend to include two elements. First, there is graded or con-
trolled exposure to feared memories, particularly the content of 
flashbacks, or to feared situations, with the aim of making them 
less distressing and aversive. There are several candidate mecha-
nisms that could account for the value of exposure. Habituation, 
a form of non- associative learning, refers to the decrement in re-
sponse that occurs when a stimulus is repeated. Extinction refers 
to the loss of a learned association between a frightening event 
and previously neutral cues, which occurs when the cues are re-
peatedly presented in non- frightening situations. The current view 
is that extinction procedures create new memories of alternative 
contexts in which the cues are associated with safety rather than 
danger, and memories of these experiences inhibit retrieval of the 
memory of the original frightening event351.

The other element is the use of cognitive techniques to help 
people with PTSD challenge distorted patterns of thinking. These 
include believing oneself to be inadequate, weak, or as having no 
future; seeing others as untrustworthy; and blaming oneself for the 
traumatic event occurring, for one’s actions during it, and for sub-
sequent symptoms. Negative appraisals of the self, of other people, 
and of the future predict the course of the disorder, often over and 
above initial symptoms141,352.

The second most researched group of trauma- focused inter-
ventions is EMDR353. This involves focusing on a traumatic mem-
ory alongside the associated negative cognitions, affects and body  
sensations whilst being subjected to bilateral stimulation (e.g., 
through eye movements or taps). Distancing and free associa-
tion are also part of EMDR. The mechanism underpinning this 
treatment remains unknown, despite several hypotheses. Some 
experts argue that EMDR is a TF- CBT, but most guideline commit-
tees have considered EMDR and TF- CBT separately.

A new group of trauma- focused interventions that has gathered 
momentum over recent years are those purported to work through  
the mechanism of mobilizing and reconsolidating traumatic mem-
ories, so that they are less threatening337. Reconsolidation theory  
proposes that retrieval returns memories to a labile state in which 
they can be altered and then reconsolidated in a new form. These 
interventions use several different procedures, but all involve  
rapidly rewinding an imaginary film of the traumatic event with 
great precision. They are so brief that, despite exposure, habit ua-
tion seems unlikely to be the underpinning mechanism.

Reconsolidation therapies have many similarities with another 
trauma- focused intervention with good evidence for effective-
ness in PTSD, including cases related to childhood abuse. This is 
imagery rescripting354- 356. This therapy also involves deliberately 
manipulating traumatic imagery in one’s mind, in this case intro-
ducing new imaginary elements that increase feelings of mastery, 
control and self- acceptance. It has been suggested that the mech-
anism involves creating alternative, less threatening competitor 
memories that are then more likely to be retrieved when the per-
son encounters trauma reminders in the future357.

Non- trauma- focused approaches include a range of techniques, 
such as stress inoculation training (which aims to teach coping 
skills, so that the person can find new ways to deal with PTSD symp-

toms and to manage other stressful events in his/her life), relaxa tion 
techniques, supportive counseling, and interpersonal therapy358.

Other emerging interventions are present- centered therapy 
and compassion- focused therapy. The former addresses nega-
tive identity changes (for example, helping with interpersonal 
disconnection through developing a positive therapeutic relation-
ship and exploring interpersonal difficulties, or overcoming help-
lessness by problem- solving)359. The latter draws on the fact that 
people with PTSD can often express compassion to others but not 
to themselves, and addresses the experience of a shameful, inad-
equate or blameworthy self  by techniques such as vividly imagin-
ing being the recipient of compassionate responses from actual or 
fantasized others360.

Different forms of individual TF- CBT are recommended by all  
the main guidelines as a first- line treatment for PTSD. However, 
there are important differences, and some TF- CBTs are given more  
priority than others by different guidelines. For example, the ISTSS 
guidelines strongly recommend TF- CBT (undifferentiated), cogni-
tive processing therapy, cognitive therapy, and prolonged expo-
sure. Despite having similar evidence available, the latest VA/DoD 
guidelines only recommend cognitive processing therapy and pro-
longed exposure as first- line TF- CBTs; cognitive therapy is given a 
weaker recommendation336. Guidelines appear to consistently 
agree that group TF- CBTs have less supporting evidence than in-
dividual ones.

EMDR is also strongly recommended by most guidelines, al-
though the latest UK National Institute for Health and Care Ex-
cellence (NICE) guidelines specifically state that it is not recom-
mended for use in individuals with PTSD following combat expo-
sure361.

Guided Internet- based TF- CBT is given a lower- strength rec-
ommendation by ISTSS and NICE, although more recently pub-
lished RCTs362 have resulted in two specific forms of this interven-
tion being recommended by NICE363. Narrative exposure therapy 
is given a lower- strength recommendation by most guidelines, but 
a strong one by NICE, while VA/DoD found insufficient evidence 
to recommend for or against it.

There  is  considerable  heterogeneity  between  guidelines  in 
terms of recommendations for non- trauma- focused psychologi-
cal interventions. The VA/DoD guidelines include stress inocula-
tion training, present- centered therapy, and interpersonal therapy 
among recommended interventions. The ISTSS guidelines in-
clude present- centered therapy among recommended interven-
tions, while interpersonal therapy, relaxation training, and sup-
portive counseling are listed among therapies with “insufficient 
evidence to recommend”.

Pharmacological treatments

There is agreement across guidelines that various pharmacol-
ogical treatments can reduce the symptoms of PTSD, though most 
guidelines recommend them less strongly than psychological 
interventions. The reasons for this are worthy of some consider-
ation. In meta- analyses, effect sizes for pharmacological treat-

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

ments are much lower than those for psychological interventions 
and, consequently, a weaker recommendation appears to be jus-
tified. Notably, however, the standard comparator condition for 
pharmacological treatments is placebo, in contrast to either usual 
care or waitlist for psychological interventions. There are also ma-
jor differences in terms of “effective blinding” of participants and 
clinicians between pharmacological and psychological treatment 
trials.

Some guideline committees – e.g., that for ISTSS guidelines –  
have tried to address the control- group issue with a priori agree-
ments regarding the adjustment of evidence thresholds for differ-
ent levels of recommendation according to the control condition 
used. This is a step in the right direction, but such agreements re-
flect the consensus of a committee and should be considered in-
formed rather than necessarily correct.

Some treatment guidelines (e.g., NICE) group drugs together 
when making recommendations, whereas others do not. A clear  
ex ample is given by recommendations for selective serotonin re-
uptake inhibitors (SSRIs): NICE guidelines just recommend SSRIs;  
ISTSS guidelines recommend the SSRIs fluoxetine, paroxetine 
and sertraline, but not others (based on the availability of RCTs 
in PTSD for those three specific drugs); and VA/DoD guidelines 
only recommend paroxetine and sertraline. Venlafaxine is recom-
mended by name by most guidelines. Quetiapine is rated as an in-
tervention with emerging evidence by ISTSS guidelines.

Most guidelines do not consider augmentation, although sys-
tematic reviews and meta- analyses provide some evidence to sup-
port augmentation of either SSRIs or venlafaxine with the alpha1-   
adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin364. The VA/DoD guidelines, 
however, take a different stance and consider the evidence strong 
enough to recommend against prazosin for the treatment of PTSD.
Overall, it is clear that further research evidence is needed to 
guide the use of medications, especially SSRIs, in the treatment of 
PTSD. In particular, the features of the clinical picture of PTSD that 
can support their use, and their utility when combined with psy-
chological interventions, should be the focus of specific research.

Emerging treatments

RCTs of yoga and three RCTs of transcranial magnetic stimulation 
were considered by the ISTSS committee. This evidence, and sub-
sequent systematic reviews and meta- analyses369,370, suggest that 
both these interventions are likely to have a role in the treatment 
of PTSD in the future.

An example of an emerging intervention that combines a phar-
macological and a psychological approach is 3,4- methylenedioxy -  
methamphetamine (MDMA)- assisted psychotherapy. MDMA is a 
psychostimulant and hallucinogen. Although not yet recommend-
ed by any guideline, the evidence for this approach appears to be 
strengthening. Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but it 
has been proposed that the properties of MDMA allow exposure to 
traumatic memories without overwhelming distress that can ham-
per processing371.

Other non- invasive treatment approaches appear to show some 
promise for the future, for example controlled breathwork372, al-
though they clearly require more rigorous evaluation before being  
recommended. It is important to acknowledge that alternative ap-
proaches to the treatment of PTSD may be more acceptable to some  
people than the current recommended first- line treatments. As ar  -  
gued in a seminal paper over a quarter of century ago, effective 
evidence- based practice is not dictated by RCTs and guidelines al-
one, but is “about integrating individual clinical expertise and the 
best external evidence”373.

Treatment evidence for children and adolescents

Sadly, the level of evidence available to determine the most effi-
cacious treatments for children and adolescents with PTSD is lag-
ging far behind that for adults. However, there is enough evidence 
for most guidelines to make several treatment recommendations.
The main recommended psychological treatments for children 
and adolescents are TF- CBT delivered to caregiver and child, TF- 
CBT delivered to child alone, and EMDR, although the latter is less 
strongly recommended by NICE than by ISTSS. There is insuffi-
cient evidence to recommend any pharmacological treatments for 
children and adolescents with PTSD.

Increasing numbers of novel treatments for PTSD are being 
developed and tested. In the latest ISTSS treatment guidelines, 26 
treatments were recommended as interventions with emerging 
evidence. Psychological treatment examples for adults include 
couple TF- CBT365 and virtual reality exposure therapy366. Group 
TF- CBT and group psychoeducation367 were considered interven-
tions with emerging evidence for children and adolescents.

All these interventions have their proponents, and all appear 
worthy of further research. Interestingly, a meta- analysis of TF- 
CBTs for veterans368 found that the strongest effect sizes were for 
RCTs of reconsolidation of traumatic memories. Arguably, this 
treatment was wrongly classified as a TF- CBT, as it probably relies 
on a different mechanism.

Several emerging interventions use neither a psychological nor 
a pharmacological approach. To give two diverse examples, five 

Adapting interventions in resource- limited settings  
and across cultural contexts

The  translation  of  RCT  evidence  into  practice  represents  a 
challenge particularly in low- resource settings and across cultural 
contexts. The relatively few RCTs for PTSD that have been con-
ducted in resource- limited settings show promising results, for 
example in the case of group- based TF- CBT for bereaved children 
in Kenya and Tanzania374, and group- based CBT for survivors of 
sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo375.

Other promising approaches include Islamic healing therapy, 
based on the principles of TF- CBT, adapted using a community- 
based participatory research process to be more accessible in the 
Islamic context376; treatments developed in Indigenous communi-
ties for PTSD and other mental health consequences of historical 

70 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025

trauma377; and interventions aimed at helping persons address 
PTSD related to racial trauma132.

More research is required to determine how best to implement 
the most efficacious treatments in a sustainable manner in low- 
resource settings. There is clearly a need for more accessible and 
cost- efficient forms of treatment that can be delivered/facilitated 
by therapists without highly specialist training. Guided Internet- 
based TF- CBT appears to be a good candidate for this, along with  
currently less developed non- invasive interventions such as im-
agery rescripting, reconsolidation therapies, and various non- 
trauma- focused approaches.

A helpful briefing paper recently published by the ISTSS378 
notes multiple barriers to implementing evidence- based inter-
ventions to support people affected by PTSD and other conditions 
in low-  and middle- income countries. These include stigma and 
the lack of mental health professionals. The paper makes recom-
mendations for public health and policy, for researchers, and for 
practitioners/service providers. These include increasing mental 
health literacy and reducing stigma, training community health 
workers to deliver effective interventions, and developing cultur-
ally specific adaptations of evidence- based treatments.

Community- based interventions

It has sometimes been argued that the evidence supporting the 
effectiveness of trauma- informed psychological interventions at 
the community level is inconsistent, suggesting the need for al-
ternative approaches379. Among the considerations are that mea-
sures of symptom severity alone provide an incomplete picture of 
the individuals’ experience, making it necessary to evaluate other 
factors such as increased understanding of the mental health con-
dition, skills building, coping, and well- being380.

Since there is often a communal or societal component in the 
trau  ma experience, it is important to consider how this might be 
addressed. Community- based interventions would not only po-
tentially benefit collectivistic societies, but could find more general 
application in situations of mass trauma exposures and among mi-
noritized or under- served populations in high- income countries.
The Adaptation and Development after Persecution and Trau-
ma (ADAPT) model381 focuses on the core psychosocial pillars in  
a community that are likely to be disrupted and to need repair fol-
lowing mass trauma. These include the general sense of safety and 
security, the social bonds and networks that link community mem-
bers, the availability of justice, the reinstatement of lost roles and 
identities, and a shared existential meaning.

Similarly, other recommendations emphasize the importance  
of interventions that address the broader social context of trauma, 
and the need for community- level support and healing, facil-
itating recovery by rebuilding and strengthening social support 
mechanisms382.

Community capacity- building to foster resilience (conceptual-
ized as dissemination of trauma- informed education and training, 
community outreach and engagement, and linkage of community 
members to resources) showed benefits with regards to emotion-

al and instrumental support as well as in increasing the sense of 
community connectedness383.

However, the evidence for the efficacy of community- based in-
terventions in improving trauma- related symptoms is currently 
less than optimal, partly because less work has been done in this 
area compared to clinical- setting interventions, and the quality of 
research is also variable384. The small number of studies examin-
ing these interventions makes it difficult to evaluate their accept-
ability, feasibility and effectiveness380.

Implications

Despite the progress made, there are many evidence gaps in the 
treatment of PTSD. Even the best- evidenced treatments require 
more research, and there is an urgent need for more effective treat-
ments. Most RCTs to date have excluded people with more com-
plex presentations of PTSD and, given their prevalence and the 
morbidity associated with such presentations, a research focus on  
them is required. It is to be hoped that the ICD- 11 diagnosis of com-
plex PTSD will help in this regard. There are clearly major opportu-
nities to build on basic science to develop new interventions and to 
enhance the effects of existing treatments.

Evidence is currently lacking to determine whether recommend-
ed treatments work as well for people with certain characteristics as 
for others. Important relevant characteristics include age, gender, 
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, culture, nature and number of trau-
matic events exposed to. For some populations, significant adjust-
ments are likely required to existing treatments to maximize their 
effectiveness. Such work is in progress. Examples include a RCT of 
EMDR for people with learning disability385, and the development 
of approaches for older people with PTSD386. Asylum seekers and 
refugees clearly represent another group of people with a high prev-
alence of trauma- related problems and an urgent need for tailored 
approaches387,388.

TRAUMA AND MENTAL HEALTH: FUTURE 
DIRECTIONS

Following the successful introduction of the PTSD diagnosis, it 
is now possible to discern a second phase in research on trauma 
and mental health that is a product of that success. One manifes-
tation of this is the recognition that the construction of the PTSD 
diagnosis in terms of a response to a specific traumatic event 
does not reflect the reality of exposure to trauma389. A history of 
childhood and adult trauma, repeated episodes of trauma, or mul-
tiple types of traumatic event, are the rule rather than the excep-
tion. Subsequent stressors, not necessarily PTSD- qualifying trau-
matic events, contribute to the prediction of PTSD, particularly the 
delayed- onset type. In some individuals, particularly members of 
the military and emergency services, PTSD develops after lengthy  
periods of resilience to high levels of stressors and traumatic events.  
Yet, this knowledge is often not reflected in assessment in stru -
ments and research designs, or reported in scientific papers. Little 

World Psychiatry 24:1 - February 2025 

71

is known about how these different histories impact on core symp-
toms such as re- experiencing, a current sense of threat, or distur-
bance in the sense of self.

Another manifestation of this new phase of research is the ac tive 
questioning over the advantages and disadvantages of attempt ing 
to define trauma in objective terms. There is increasing recogni-
tion that the experience of socially marginalized, neurodiverse 
and other relevant groups has not been sufficiently valued as yet. 
Increased focus on different populations, including people under-
going intensive care or those with psychosis, can be highly infor-
mative about the relative contribution to symptoms of the subjec-
tive and objective impact of stressful events, and about the value of 
standard trauma- focused interventions in these different circum-
stances.

Relatedly, it is becoming evident that there are several different 
PTSD phenotypes, including those with delayed onset, the disso-
ciative subtype of DSM- 5 PTSD, and ICD- 11 complex PTSD. These 
developments suggest that, in the future, it will be necessary to talk 
about post- traumatic stress disorders in the plural. Some explana-
tory mechanisms are likely to be shared, but others may not. This 
has major implications for biological research, which is generally 
best served by focusing on a small number of clearly defined phe-
notypes.

An approach similar to the exploration of subjective experienc-
es in schizophrenia390, based on a greater involvement of experts 
by experience, could be useful in research on PTSD, focusing on 
intrusive memories and flashbacks, but also on shifts in the expe-
rience of the self in response to trauma reminders. Initial research 
in this area is promising, and provides both some theory and some  
methodological tools for isolating specific post- traumatic phenom-
ena246- 248.

The reinstatement of threat to identity as one of the psychologi-
cal foundations of PTSD has several advantages. As a broader con-
cept, it is not tied to the specific negative cognitions that have been 
found to be pathogenic in Western samples, but acknowledges the 
role of other cognitions, social practices, and value systems that 
are important in different cultural contexts. It brings into play a 
wide variety of long- standing observations about the subjective 
experience of being traumatized, for example that individuals 
sometimes feel deeply alienated from others or as though they 
have been mentally destroyed. It also helps to explain the efficacy 
of interventions that are not primarily focused on the traumatic 
memory, but address more general physical, social and mental re-
sources such as the quality of close relationships, self- acceptance, 
and problem- solving.

One question for the future is when interventions should focus 
primarily on disturbances to memory and when on disturbances 
to identity. In mass- trauma situations, there appears to be wide-
spread acceptance that the initial focus should be on the depletion 
of identity- relevant resources such as housing, employment, so-
cial norms, and community structures381,391,392. Response is likely 
to require local or national governmental involvement.

In individual trauma, clinical services are usually ill- equipped to 
restore specific resource losses and are set up to deliver physical or 
psychological interventions. We know that memory- focused inter-

ventions have the potential to bring about positive changes to iden-
tity in the form of improved relationships, greater optimism, and 
more positive beliefs about the self. There are promising develop-
ments in imagery- based interventions that may offer accel erated 
improvements. However, there is much to learn about whether and 
how identity- focused interventions, such as present- centered and 
compassion- focused therapies, reduce intrusive trauma memories 
and flashbacks. The optimal match between different interven-
tions and various PTSD phenotypes is likely to be crucial.

One important issue on which evidence is lacking is how low-  
and middle- income countries can design trauma- related interven-
tions that are tailored to be culturally and structurally valid, and how 
they can obtain the maximum return for their investment. There  
is already a focus on brief transdiagnostic interventions delivered 
by para- professionals or peers, such as Problem Management Plus 
393. These interventions can be made more available using Internet  
and mobile technology resources, which have the potential to reduce  
barriers created by geographical isolation, stigma and cost394,395. 
Lacking to an even greater degree is evidence concerning the ef-
fectiveness of interventions for specific cultural idioms or concepts 
of distress44.

To conclude, the explosion of knowledge about PTSD has re-
vealed its central importance, but also its limitations in capturing  
the variety of psychopathological reactions that are made more like  -
ly by traumatic events. The next ten years will probably see consol-
idation in the form of establishment of an accepted set of differ-
ent phenotypes, which will enable a more focused investigation of 
mechanisms and treatment response. Studies of different popu-
lations exposed to different types of stressors in different contexts 
will deepen our understanding of what is universal and what is 
specific about the response to trauma.
