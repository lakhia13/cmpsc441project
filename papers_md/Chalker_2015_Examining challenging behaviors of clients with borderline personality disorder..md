Abstract

Few studies have examined effects of challenging behaviors of clients with borderline personality 
disorder (BPD) on psychotherapy outcomes. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-
based treatment designed to treat chronic suicidality, self-directed violence (SDV), and emotion 
dysregulation, while targeting challenging behaviors. DBT has been shown to be effective with 
clients with BPD. We evaluated whether therapist reported challenging behaviors, such as high 
volume phone contacts or violating the therapist’s limits, during DBT would be associated with 
dropping out of DBT, severity and frequency of SDV, emotion regulation deficits, and client’s and 
therapist’s satisfaction of treatment. The current study examined challenging behaviors reported 
by therapists in a sample of 63 psychiatrically disabled outpatient DBT clients diagnosed with 
BPD (73% women, average age 37 years). More frequent phone contacts were associated with a 
decrease in dropout and psychological symptoms, and an increase in client and therapist 
satisfaction. More avoidance/disengagement behavior was associated with more than twice the 
risk of SDV and a decrease in therapist satisfaction. Findings suggest that the phone coaching 
might serve to maximize client satisfaction and reduce the likelihood of dropout.

Introduction

Borderline Personality Disorder

Page 2

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by 
emotional instability and impulsivity. Clients with BPD are often high utilizers of acute 
psychiatric services, including inpatient admissions, crisis, and emergency services 
(Bateman & Fonagy, 2009; Bender et al., 2001; Comtois, Elwood, Holdcraft, Simpson, & 
Smith, 2007; Zanarini, Frankenburg, Hennen, & Silk, 2004a). It is also common for clients 
with BPD to be diagnosed with one or more Axis I comorbidities, especially mood or 
anxiety disorders (Fyer, Frances, Sullivan, Hurt, & Clarkin, 1988; Grant et al., 2008; 
Zanarini et al., 1998; Zanarini, Frankenburg, Hennen, Reich, & Silk, 2004b). A desire for 
more treatment is characteristic of clients with BPD (Goodman et al., 2010), and there is 
often over-treatment with minimally effective results (Gunderson et al., 2011; Linehan & 
Heard, 1999; Skodol et al., 2002).

At the same time, clients with BPD are more likely to dropout of treatment prematurely 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2001; Ben-Porath, 2004). Clients with BPD have a poor 
response to traditional community outpatient treatments, and research has found that they 
consume up to 40% of mental health services provided in a given setting even on an 
outpatient basis (Geller, 1986; Surber et al., 1987; Widiger & Weissman, 1991; Woogh, 
1986).

There are many behaviors that can disrupt the course of psychotherapy and pose problems 
for both the therapist and client. These challenging behaviors, called therapy-interfering 
behaviors (TIBs) by Linehan (1993), have been defined as client or therapist behaviors that 
interfere with the client receiving or benefiting from the therapy offered. Clients with BPD 
tend to engage in multiple challenging behaviors that interfere with receiving therapy, such 
as calling the therapist at unreasonable hours outside of session (Dimeff & Linehan, 2001), 
behaving ineffectively on phone calls (Linehan, 2008), being non-collaborative (e.g., 
arguing with the therapist), and quitting therapy (Bados, Balaguer, & Saldaña, 2007; 
Espinosa, Grynberg, & Mendoza, 2009; Farrand, Booth, Gilbert, & Lankshear, 2009; 
Oumaya et al., 2010). This, paired with emotional and behavioral dyscontrol, including 
suicidal and non-suicidal self-directed violence (SDV), results in these individuals being 
difficult-to-treat, BPD being a highly stigmatized disorder, and trepidation by clinicians to 
provide treatment for clients with BPD (Gunderson et al., 2011; Linehan, Cochran, Mar, 
Levensky, & Comtois, 2000; Paris, 2005).

Dialectical Behavior Therapy

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993) is the dominant evidence-based 
treatment for borderline personality disorder in the community (Koons et al., 2001; Linehan, 
Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991; Linehan et al., 2002; Linehan et al., 2006; 
Lynch, Morse, Mendelson, & Robins, 2003; Telch, Agras, & Linehan, 2001; Verheul et al., 
2003). DBT consists of five treatment components, including 1) weekly individual 
psychotherapy, 2) weekly skills training groups, 3) skills coaching via telephone, 4) therapist

consultation team, and 5) ancillary treatments to help structure the environment (e.g., case 
management) as needed.

Skills coaching via telephone is a component of DBT designed to help strengthen behavioral 
skills learned in DBT. Skills coaching is not “telephone therapy” (Linehan, 1993) but 
instead utilizes specific strategies to generalize skills use to the client’s natural environment 
(Linehan, 1993; Linehan, 2008; Manning, 2011). Calls are generally brief and focused on 
helping clients use specific skills in the moment. As with many other DBT strategies, clients 
are oriented to the use of skills coaching and how to use it effectively (e.g., calling prior to 
engaging in SDV rather than after). DBT therapists are directed to observe their personal 
limits regarding the frequency, content, and timing of telephone calls (Ben-Porath, 2014). 
Limits around skills coaching in DBT are seen as fluid rather than static; that is, they may 
change throughout the course of treatment or differ between clients (Linehan, 1993). (For 
more information on skills coaching, see Linehan, 1993 and Ben-Porath, 2004).

The structure of DBT offers therapists strategies to directly address challenging behaviors, 
including suicidal behaviors and therapy-interfering behaviors (TIBs). DBT utilizes a 
treatment hierarchy of behavioral targets that explicitly includes TIBs as the second highest 
priority for treatment, following only suicidality, SDV, and violent behaviors. In DBT, TIBs 
can include behavior of both the therapist and the client. Therapist TIBs include behaviors 
such as having an imbalance of treatment strategies (e.g., too much change or too much 
acceptance), being disrespectful (e.g., being late, forgetting important information), or not 
knowing what to do in response to particular behaviors. Client TIBs include behaviors such 
as non-attendance, non-compliance, and non-collaboration, such as missing or arriving late 
to a therapy session, and not returning phone calls. Behaviors that do not follow therapist’s 
observed limits, such as calling for coaching outside of agreed upon times, are also targeted 
as client TIBs (Dimeff & Linehan, 2001).

The broader treatment literature has focused on challenging client behaviors related to 
dropout and phone contacts between the client and therapist. Dropout is considered to be the 
most serious form of TIBs and research in this area has shown that DBT is more effective at 
reducing dropout than treatment as usual (Dimeff & Linehan, 2001; Harley, Baity, Blais, & 
Jacobo, 2007; Koons et al., 2001; Linehan, et al., 1991; Linehan & Heard, 1999; Linehan et 
al., 2002; Linehan et al., 2006; McMain et al., 2009; Verheul et al., 2003). Beyond dropout, 
few studies have examined what predicts challenging client behaviors or the effect of these 
behaviors on the outcome of psychotherapy. Within the first randomized controlled trial of 
DBT, no significant correlation was found between the number of telephone calls and 
frequency of SDV in the DBT condition, whereas clients who engaged in more SDV had 
more telephone calls with their therapist in the treatment- as-usual condition (Linehan et al., 
1991; Linehan & Heard, 1993). One article offers case examples to explore the difficulties 
in problematic telephone consultation in DBT (Koons, 2011). Allen (1997) examined four 
diverse paradigms and suggested techniques of handling TIBs in a BPD population, though 
none of the techniques have been empirically tested. While not a challenging behavior itself, 
therapeutic alliance ruptures certainly can be an outcome of such behaviors. A review of the 
literature on therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome found evidence that repairing 
rupture therapeutic alliances is related to positive outcomes (Safran, Muran, & Eubanks-

Carter, 2011). Other than the first randomized clinical trial of DBT (Linehan et al., 1991; 
Linehan & Heard, 1993), no published studies have examined the impact of challenging 
behaviors on key DBT outcomes such as suicidal behavior or emotion regulation.

Current Study

There is a clear need to increase engagement, effectiveness, and efficiency and decrease 
dropout in treatments for clients with BPD, including in evidence-based treatments such as 
dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993). The current study examined how a wide 
range of challenging behaviors was associated with treatment outcomes.

The current study describes DBT therapists’ report of challenging behaviors amongst a 
sample of psychiatrically disabled clients with BPD in an outpatient DBT program. Four 
types of potentially challenging client behaviors were examined: (1) interpersonal negativity 
(e.g., the client behaving in an inflexible or defiant manner toward the therapist) and 
avoidant/disengaged behaviors (e.g., missing a session without calling), (2) extreme 
behavioral dysregulation (e.g., engaging in SDV in a way that is not medically serious), (3) 
the frequency of out-of-session contacts, regardless of whether it was described as a 
challenging behavior by the therapist, and (4) whether the therapist’s limits were observed in 
relation to each client. We examined the impact of these potentially challenging client 
behaviors on treatment outcomes. We hypothesized that more client challenging behaviors 
would be associated with seven outcomes: (1) premature dropout, (2) frequency of SDV, (3) 
severity of SDV, (4) emotion regulation deficits over the course of treatment, (5) the client’s 
satisfaction of treatment, (6) the therapist’s satisfaction of treatment, and (7) psychological 
symptom severity.

Methods

Setting

Participants

XXX is a large outpatient community mental health clinic with a DBT program serving 
psychiatrically disabled clients with BPD. XXX is a clinic within XXX, a large county 
medical center serving underserved individuals within XXX County. The DBT provided in 
this program adhered closely to the DBT manual (Linehan, 1993) including all DBT 
functions and modes of treatment (Comtois et al., 2007).

Client participants—All clients were psychiatrically disabled as determined by the state 
or federal government, an employer, or otherwise unable to work due primarily to 
psychiatric or emotional reasons for greater than six months. All clients met the XXX 
County definition of “severely impaired and for whom lack of treatment would result in 
serious dysfunction, failure in functioning, or involvement in more restrictive treatment” 
representing the most severe 4% of clients in the county mental health system.

There were 63 clients in the study. Clients were 19–58 years old (M = 37.2, SD = 10.4) and 
met criteria for borderline personality disorder as determined by the Structured Clinician 
Interview for the DSM-IV Axis-II (SCID-II). Following the process of consent and

completion of pre-treatment assessments, standard DBT was offered to all clients for one 
year.

Therapist participants—There were a total of seven DBT therapists providing treatment 
within the study with a range of DBT experience from 2–22 years. All therapists were 
trained and supervised by an expert in DBT (Dr. Linehan and/or author and DBT trainer, 
[LAST AUTHOR]). Therapists were assigned clients as they had openings to balance the 
acuity of caseloads and, when this was equivalent, randomly.

The team lead of the DBT team was intensively trained in 1994 and has since served as a 
research therapist on Dr. Linehan’s treatment outcome studies and now trains and supervises 
DBT internationally. All therapists received intensive DBT training (Landes & Linehan, 
2012) or the equivalent of intensive training (e.g., 6 month training course in a residency 
program) and have received supervision from the team lead or Dr. Linehan for periods of 
time ranging from 1–10 years.

Treatment adherence or fidelity was rated using the DBT Adherence Rating Scale; this scale 
generates a single item computed Global Score of DBT adherence that ranges from 1–5. 
Global scores >4.0 represent DBT adherence; scores below 4.0 signal need for consultation/
supervision. 33 tapes from individual psychotherapy sessions were randomly selected for 
each therapist and coded by three DBT therapists who have received extensive training in 
DBT and in adherence coding. Scores for all therapists ranged from 3.6 to 4.3, with an 
average score of 4.0 (SD = .17), indicating that therapists were generally at adherence. 
Supervision and/or consultation was provided for adherence scores lower than 4.0. These 
scores are similar to scores obtained by Linehan and colleagues (2006) in an RCT of DBT 
compared to treatment by experts. For individual therapy sessions, adherence scores ranged 
from 3.6 to 4.3, with a mean ± SD score of 4.0±0.2 (Linehan et al., 2006). Eight tapes from 
group skills training sessions were also randomly selected and coded. Scores ranged from 
4.0 to 4.3, with an average score of 4.1 (SD = .11), indicating skills group sessions were 
adherent.

Blind outcome assessments evaluated in this study were conducted at months 4, 8, and 12 
after DBT skills training began; treatment information was collected by unblinded research 
staff at each assessment point. Clients were asked to complete their outcome assessments 
regardless if they dropped out of treatment. Therapist Interviews were conducted after the 
therapist completed all treatment with that client. Clients were compensated $15 for the 
screening interview and an additional $20 for the pre-treatment assessment if accepted. Four 
and eight month assessments were $25 and 12 month assessments were $40 to provide 
additional incentive for this key assessment point. Clients were given additional incentive 
payments of $5 extra if they called to schedule their next appointment and an additional 
incentive of $5 if they completed their assessment when originally scheduled. Therapists 
were not compensated for interviews.

Measures

Page 6

The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1975) is a 53-item self-report questionnaire 
designed to assess distress of psychological symptoms. The range of possible scores is 0–
212; high scores indicate more distress of psychological symptoms. The BSI has high 
internal reliability and high test-retest reliability. The BSI has nine subscales to assess 
different symptoms along with three global scales. The Global Severity Index (GSI) (e.g., 
the mean of all BSI items) was used in the current study to report the distress change of 
psychological symptoms from baseline to end of the DBT year with a possible range of 0–4; 
high scores indicate more change.

The Demographic Data Scale (DDS; Linehan, 1982) was used to obtain a wide range of 
demographic data. It has high concurrent validity, and was initially established by 
comparing DDS responses to hospital chart data for a sample of psychiatric inpatients.

The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is an 8-item measure used to assess clients’ 
satisfaction with their therapy in the previous four months. The range of possible scores is 
8–32; higher score indicates greater satisfaction with therapy. This measure has been used 
widely for evaluating client opinion of standard community mental health care (Attkisson & 
Zwick, 1982; Gaston & Sabourin, 1992; Nguyen, Attkisson, & Stegner, 1983).

The Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) is a 36-item 
self-report questionnaire designed to assess multiple aspects of emotion dysregulation – an 
important treatment outcome of DBT. The range of possible scores is 36–180; higher score 
indicates more difficulty with emotion regulation. The DERS has been found to have high 
internal consistency and test-retest reliability and adequate construct and predictive validity 
within a standardization sample (Gratz & Roemer, 2004).

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Axis II (SCID-II) (First, 1997a; First 
Spitzer, Gibbon, Williams, et al., 1995; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1995) was used 
to diagnose borderline personality disorder. This 15-item measure is an interviewer-
administered assessment where clients can score 1 = absent or false, 2 = subthreshold, or 3 = 
threshold or true for each item. A client will meet criteria for borderline personality disorder 
if at least five of the 15 items are coded as 3 (threshold or true).

The Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count (SASI-Count; Linehan & Comtois, 1996) is an 
interviewer-administered assessment of the number and severity of past SDV with and 
without intent to assess the previous four months. A lifetime version was given at the pre-
treatment assessment to assess for all SDVs up to DBT. For each injury type (e.g., cutting, 
burning, overdosing), a lethality or severity rating is assigned by the assessor based on the 
client’s description of the injury on a scale from one to six (one being “very low” severity 
and six being “severe”) as per the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview (Linehan et al, 
2006).

The Therapist Interview (TI) is a brief interview developed by Linehan (1987) in previous 
DBT studies that asks about the nature of the treatment offered to the client, the therapist’s 
satisfaction with treatment, and ratings of outcome. The measure was completed for each

therapist-client dyad after termination of treatment. Items on the TI include three 
assessments of challenging behaviors of clients with BPD. First, the TI includes a list of 53 
challenging behaviors based on the DBT concept of therapy-interfering behaviors (Linehan, 
1993) that may be encountered while conducting therapy. Therapists are asked to endorse 
whether each challenging behavior occurred during the treatment they provided. Second, the 
TI assesses the number of out-of-session skills coaching contacts the therapist had with the 
client during the year of treatment. Out-of-session coaching included phone coaching (the 
modal method of coaching clients in DBT) as well as coaching by text messaging and email 
based on the client’s and therapist’s preference. Third, the TI assesses whether the client 
followed whatever out-of-session contact limits were established with the therapist (e.g., no 
calls after 9:00pm, only call if already tried using skills, etc.). The TI also includes three 
questions on the therapist’s satisfaction of the treatment with that client.

Data Analysis

The first task in the data analyses was to determine the dimensionality of the 53 DBT 
theory-derived challenging behavior items in the Therapist Interview and construct 
subscales. Because the challenging behavior items were binary (i.e., occurred or did not 
occur), the variance-covariance matrix of items was estimated using a robust estimation 
procedure (Schäfer & Strimmer, 2005). Due to the relatively small sample size, the 
procedure puts a slight constraint on the permissible values of the matrix, which has been 
shown to lead to more efficient and reliable results. The resulting variance-covariance 
matrix was factor analyzed and resulting item loadings were rotated using promax rotation 
for interpretation. Factors were retained that had three or more items with loadings of 0.40 
or greater, which resulted in three challenging behavior factors, described below in Results. 
Subscales based on the three challenging behavior factors were used as associations of 
treatment outcome in regression analyses. In addition to these challenging behavior-derived 
subscales, two other potential challenging behaviors were used: frequency of out-of-session 
contacts and whether or not the therapists’ out-of-session contact limits were followed. Due 
to skew and outliers, the frequency of out-of-session contacts was log transformed. The 
therapist’s satisfaction was determined by calculating the average of three 1 to 5, low to 
high, scaled items from the TI, which included the overall improvement of the client during 
the time the therapist saw him/her, how helpful the therapist believed he/she was to the 
client, and the therapist’s own satisfaction level concerning his/her therapy with the client.

Regression analyses were used to examine the association of the potential challenging 
behaviors with six outcomes. As is standard in DBT (Linehan, 1993), dropout was defined 
as missing four consecutive weeks of either individual therapy or skills training and 
evaluated using logistic regression. A total SDV count was calculated by totaling all injuries 
during the DBT year. SDV is an infrequent count variable with a large stack of zeroes that 
violates the Poisson distribution assumptions. SDVs were therefore modeled using a hurdle 
model (Atkins, Baldwin, Zheng, Gallop, & Neighbors, 2013; Hilbe, 2011). A hurdle model 
(sometimes called a two-part model) simultaneously fits two submodels: (1) a logistic 
regression for no SDV versus any SDV, and (2) a truncated count regression (negative 
binomial) for the amount of SDV, given that there is SDV. Severity of SDV was evaluated 
only for those who made a SDV (n = 23) using linear regression. The DERS and GSI were

evaluated as a change score between the clients’ pre-treatment and 12-month DERS total 
and GSI scores, respectively. The DERS, CSQ, therapist satisfaction, and GSI were modeled 
via linear regression. Hurdle model analyses were done in R v3.0.2 (R Core Team, 2013) 
and all other analyses were done in SPSS (Version 19).

Results

A description of sample characteristics can be found in Table 1. The average age was 37 (SD 
= 10.4), almost three-quarters (73%) were female, and over a quarter (28%) of clients had 
completed college. 76.2% were Caucasian followed by 12.7% Mixed Ethnicity, 4.8% each 
African-American and Asian or Pacific Islander, then 1.6% Latino/a. Determined by the 
DSM-IV, primary Axis I diagnosis was determined by consensus between individual 
therapist and study psychiatrist as the Axis I diagnosis was most relevant to the treatment 
they were receiving. Most clients met criteria for an Axis I disorder (95.2%), with almost 
half (49.2%) meeting criteria for a depressive disorder. During the DBT year, four clients 
changed therapists. The TI data that was used for analyses were from the clients’ first 
therapist for three of the four clients that changed therapists. The fourth client was assigned 
to their first therapist but never attended sessions with that therapist; therefore, we used the 
TI data of this client’s second therapist.

The factor analysis of the challenging behavior items included in the TI described above 
yielded three challenging behavior factors. The three factors contain items characterizing: 
(1) interpersonal negativity (e.g., behaved in an inflexible or defiant manner), (2) avoidance/
disengagement (e.g., withdrew of behaved in an inattentive or apathetic manner), and (3) 
general behavioral dysregulation not directly related to the therapy dynamic (e.g., made a 
medically serious suicide attempt, got arrested, arrived to treatment intoxicated). Table 2 
reports the frequency with which each challenging behavior was endorsed by the therapists 
during treatment organized by subscale. Out of the three subscales, therapists were most 
likely to report avoidant and disengaged behaviors seen in their clients. Subscale scores 
were created by taking the mean of items endorsed for each factor and the descriptive 
statistics are presented in Table 3.

Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics of the independent and dependent variables. 
Across all 63 clients, therapists reported a median of 12 out-of-session coaching calls per 
client during DBT with a range of 0 to 252 calls. 20.3% (n = 19) reported their limits 
regarding phone calls had been violated at least once.

Thirty-six of the sixty-three clients (57.1%) dropped out of DBT prematurely (i.e., before 
the 12 months of DBT concluded). A logistic regression of drop-out showed that only (log-
transformed) frequency of out-of-session contacts was significantly related to dropout (see 
Table 4). For each (log) increase in contacts, there was an associated 47% decrease in 
treatment dropout (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.83).

As noted earlier, SDV was fit using a hurdle model given the large stack of zeroes and 
skewed distribution; this includes a logistic regression for no SDV vs. any SDV, as well as a 
count regression of mean SDV, where there is SDV. Factor 3 reflecting behavioral

dysregulation was no included in this analysis as the underlying items of the factor were 
tautological (e.g., made a medically serious suicide attempt). As can be seen in Table 5, 
Factor 2 reflecting avoidant and disengaged behavior was significantly associated with 
frequency of SDV in the DBT year. A standard deviation increase in Factor 2 was associated 
with more than twice the risk of any SDV during DBT (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.06, 3.97). 
The number of SDV (given some SDV) increased almost three times for every standard 
deviation increase in Factor 2 (RR = 2.75, 95% CI =1.12, 6.73). No other variables were 
significantly associated with SDV frequency.

As seen in Table 6, linear regression was used to evaluate whether the challenging behavior 
variables were associated with severity of SDV during DBT (among the 23 clients who 
engaged in SDV), change in emotion regulation over the course of DBT using the DERS, 
client satisfaction at the end of treatment using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, 
therapist satisfaction at the end of treatment using the Therapist Interview, and in the change 
in severity of psychological symptoms over the course of DBT using the Global Severity 
Index from the BSI. None of the potential challenging behavior variables were associated 
with severity of SDV during DBT or change in emotion regulation scores. Higher client 
satisfaction was significantly associated with more frequent out-of-session contacts (β = 
0.45, t(40) = 2.79, p < .01). Higher therapist satisfaction was significantly associated with 
more frequent out-of-session contacts (β = 0.66, t(53) = 5.70, p < .01). A greater change of 
psychological symptoms over the DBT year was significantly associated with more frequent 
out-of-session contacts (β = 0.47, t(38) = 3.19, p < .01). For each standard deviation increase 
in Factor 2 (avoidant and disengaged behaviors) there was an associated .28 decrease in the 
therapist’s satisfaction (β = −0.27, t(53) = −2.45, p < .05).

Discussion

This study was to examine the relationship between potentially challenging behaviors and a 
range of clinical outcomes in a group of individuals with borderline personality disorder. 
The list of challenging behaviors developed from the DBT theory formed three factors. 
Avoidant and disengaged behavior was associated with higher frequency of SDV during the 
treatment year. Avoidant and disengaged behaviors were also associated with a decrease in 
therapist satisfaction. While general behavioral dysregulation behaviors (e.g., arrived to 
treatment intoxicated) were not associated with any of the outcomes, client interpersonal 
negativity behaviors (e.g., criticism and complaining) showed a trend in increasing the odds 
of SDV during the treatment year. The client behaving outside the therapist’s limits in 
regard to phone calls were not associated with any of the DBT outcomes (although report of 
this behavior was relatively infrequent). Frequency of out-of-session contacts was associated 
with lower dropout rates, higher treatment satisfaction by both the client and therapist, and 
an increased change in psychological symptoms over the DBT year. None of the potential 
challenging behaviors variables were associated with change in emotion regulation scores.

The dropout rate of 57.1% in the current sample is higher than in many published clinical 
trials of DBT. Examining reasons for dropout, no single reason stood out. There were a wide 
range of reasons for dropping treatment and the modal reason for leaving was endorsed by 
less than one-third of the sample. Grouping reasons for dropping out indicated 31% of the

clients dropped at least in part for a logistical reason (e.g., time, transportation), 40% 
dropped at least in part because of dissatisfaction with treatment, and 11% dropped because 
their problems improved and they no longer felt a need for treatment. While this dropout 
was higher than other clinical trials, it is comparable to other reported dropout rates of DBT 
in the community, which range from 24% to 58% (Comtois et al., 2007; Feigenbaum et al., 
2012; Priebe et al., 2012; Turner, 2000). The current study was conducted with a 
community-based outpatient DBT program serving psychiatrically disabled clients with 
severe BPD with varying comorbid Axis I disorders as shown in Table 1. Therefore, the 
results may or may not be generalized to a higher functioning sample.

Anecdotal data across various DBT trainings suggests that many clinicians are concerned 
about therapeutic limits being crossed by clients with BPD, which is likely to contribute to 
negative attitudes and trepidation among therapists providing treatment. Other treatment 
modalities shown to be effective in the treatment of clients with BPD, like Schema-Focused 
Therapy (Giesen-Bloo et al., 2006), have found out-of-session contacts to be a taxing 
component (Giesen-Bloo et al., 2006; Nadort et al., 2009a) and show no added benefit to 
therapy outcomes (Nadort et al., 2009a; Nadort et al., 2009b). The results of the current 
study found that in DBT the base rate of therapist limits regarding phone calls not being 
observed was about one in five clients, and that violating therapists’ limits were not 
associated with any clinical outcomes and were not associated with any other challenging 
behavior. Future studies of therapist responses to BPD clients should further evaluate this 
question and determine whether therapists have a fear out of proportion to the problem or 
whether the few cases where limits are violated that is so intolerable that therapists are 
inclined to avoid out-of-session contact in general.

Increased contact with the therapist via phone coaching was associated with four of the 
study’s outcomes: decreased odds of premature dropout, increased client and therapist 
satisfaction, and increased change of psychological symptoms. Though the effect size was 
small, the positive relationship between client and therapist satisfaction and increased 
frequency of phone calls suggests that clients and therapist are more satisfied with treatment 
when they have increased contact via phone coaching. Given these findings and the low 
occurrence of therapists reporting that they felt their limits about phone calls had been 
violated, out-of-session phone contact in DBT and the way it is structured may serve a 
variety of functions, including generalizing skills, increasing client satisfaction, and either 
not increasing or possibly reducing therapist burnout. This may also enhance the therapeutic 
relationship between the client and therapist. While more out-of-session contacts were 
associated with fewer dropouts, greater treatment satisfaction by both client and therapist in 
this study, and increased change of psychological symptoms, these contacts were not 
necessarily out of scheduled work hours. So this study could not determine whether greater 
availability outside of work hours is related to DBT outcomes. Interestingly, increased 
phone contacts was associated a greater change in psychological symptoms over the DBT 
year but there was no association of emotion regulation change. Additional research on the 
frequency of therapeutic contacts should examine whether the associations between 
frequency of contacts and satisfaction with treatment by both client and therapist are 
moderated by factors such as therapeutic alliance or whether the out-of-session contacts 
were within or outside of scheduled work hours. Future research should also examine why

Limitations

the frequency of therapeutic contacts may be associated with psychological symptoms but 
not emotion regulation, and these findings should be replicated in a larger sample.

Clients with BPD are often associated with challenging behaviors, which were categorized 
for the purpose of this study. Three challenging behavior factors were created from TI items 
and characterized: 1) interpersonal negativity (e.g., behaved in an inflexible or defiant 
manner), 2) avoidance/disengagement (e.g., withdrew of behaved in an inattentive or 
apathetic manner), and 3) behavioral dysregulation (e.g., made a medically serious suicide 
attempt, got arrested, arrived to treatment intoxicated). Avoidance/disengagement was 
associated with the frequency of SDV and therapist satisfaction. These challenging 
behaviors, which often disrupt the course of psychotherapy, were not associated with 
dropout or client satisfaction with treatment. Negative interpersonal behaviors or behavioral 
dysregulation, while likely interfering with the experience of the treatment and perhaps 
weakening the therapeutic alliance, were not associated with DBT outcomes. Future 
research is needed on which challenging behaviors are most relevant and perhaps creating a 
psychometrically strong measure of these behaviors.

There were several important limitations of the study. First, these phenomena are only 
associations and, therefore, do not prove that challenging behaviors result in more negative 
outcomes. Second, the TI only assesses the presences or absence of challenging behaviors, 
not the frequency through treatment or the severity. However, it could be potentially 
problematic to obtain an exact count of challenging behaviors looking back over the 
treatment year, so to account for this, the TI has been updated to include a ordinal scale to 
capture a more representative frequency and severity of challenging behaviors (i.e., how 
often did the specific challenging behavior occur: never, once, a few times, or repeatedly). 
While most individuals who engaged in challenging behaviors did so starting early in 
treatment and challenging behaviors were less likely over time as they improved in 
treatment, this limitation exists and can only be addressed with replication in similar larger 
samples. Third, only information about client challenging behaviors was included and was 
gathered from the therapist, not the client. Future research should include therapist and client 
report, as well as information about potential therapist TIBs. Additionally, due to the modest 
sample size, the presented factor structure of the challenging behaviors items and scale itself 
should be considered preliminary until replicated in a larger sample. Next, several measures 
were not completed by study clients at the follow-up assessment resulting in missing data on 
some outcome measures. In addition, because of the high dropout rate, there was less 
possible time for clients who dropped out to engage in challenging behaviors. Finally, there 
was no comparison condition and future studies examining challenging behaviors should 
consider including a comparison.

Future Directions

This study examined the presence of challenging behaviors in a community mental health 
DBT program with psychiatrically disabled clients with BPD in a large urban county. It is 
the first published research showing an increase in out-of-session contact as an association 
of positive client outcomes in DBT. This should be replicated in other studies. Strong

measures of challenging behaviors showing feasibility, reliability, and validity across 
treatment and client populations and therapist vs. client perspectives are clearly needed. 
Additional research is also needed on the association between potential challenging 
behaviors and other outcomes in treatment, such as therapeutic alliance, clinical burnout, 
and a broader range of clinical outcomes.
