To analyze health effects of mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions, including
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)
and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Additionally, we aimed to explore content
and delivery components in terms of procedure, instructors, mode, length, fidelity and
adherence in the included interventions.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search in the databases MEDLINE, PsychINFO,
CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central and AMED from 1990 to January 2019. We included
randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials analyzing health effects of mindfulness-
and acceptance-based interventions for patients with fibromyalgia compared to no interven-
tion, wait-list control, treatment as usual, or active interventions. MBSR combined with other
treatments were included. Predefined outcomes were pain, fatigue, sleep quality, psycho-
logical distress, depression, anxiety, mindfulness, health-related quality of life and work abil-
ity. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide
was used to explore content and delivery components in the interventions. Meta-analyses
were performed, and GRADE was used to assess the certainty in the evidence.

Results

The search identified 4430 records, of which nine original trials were included. The vast
majority of the participants were women. The analyses showed small to moderate effects in
favor of mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions compared to controls in pain
(SMD -0.46 [95% CI -0.75, -0.17]), depression (SMD -0.49 [95% CI -0.85, -0.12]), anxiety
(SMD -0.37 [95% CI -0.71, -0.02]), mindfulness (SMD -0.40 [-0.69, -0.11]), sleep quality
(SMD -0.33 [-0.70, 0.04]) and health-related quality of life (SMD -0.74 [95% CI -2.02, 0.54])

at end of treatment. The effects are uncertain due to individual study limitations, inconsistent
results and imprecision.

Conclusion

Health effects of mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions for patients with fibro-
myalgia are promising but uncertain. Future trials should consider investigating whether
strategies to improve adherence and fidelity of mindfulness- and acceptance-based inter-
ventions can improve health outcomes.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex and heterogeneous condition that may have important impact
on patients’ quality of life. Pain is the dominant symptom, but other symptoms such as non-
refreshed sleep, fatigue, mood disturbance and cognitive impairment are common [1]. Current
pharmacological treatments for FM are non-curative. European League Against Rheumatism
(EULAR) recommends non-pharmacological therapies as first-line therapy. Individualized
physical exercise should be recommended for all patients with FM. Additionally, cognitive
behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditative movement, hydrotherapy
or a combination of these therapies have shown promising effects for some patients, but the
evidence is still insufficient [1].

Physical and emotional stress-provoking life events and stress resulting from living with
pain may play a role in development of FM and exacerbation of the symptoms [2, 3]. Hence,
techniques that can help patients cope with their stress-related experiences may reduce symp-
toms and improve wellbeing [4]. Mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions, such as
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) [5], mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT) [6] and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) [7] address peoples´ relationship
to their internal experiences. The interventions aim to train the participants to intentionally
observe thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations as they are perceived on a moment-to-
moment basis with an open, non-judgmental attitude [8]. It is argued that when experiences
are not judged as good or bad, positive or negative, acceptance increases and one’s struggle to
control what might not be controllable decreases. This should eventually lead to greater self-
care and self-compassion [9].

MBSR and MBCT are typically provided as eight weekly 2–2.5 hours’ group sessions plus a
one-day retreat. They include practical and formal meditation training, such as body scan, sit-
ting and walking meditation, mindful yoga movements and individual practice between ses-
sions [5]. MBCT was adapted from MBSR to prevent recurrent depressions and replaces some
of the content of MBSR with education on specific patterns of negative thinking that people
with depression are vulnerable to [6]. ACT consists of a set of treatment methods and aims to
focus on other cognitive skills such as the participants’ ability to define and clarify values in dif-
ferent life domains, identify achievable goals that embody those values, and plan the future
based on identified life goals. ACT can be delivered in a wide array of applications including
group treatment, individual treatment, via internet and self-administered workbooks with
therapist support [10]. ACT is delivered to a variety of patient populations and settings and
focuses on different problems, e.g. depression, anxiety, chronic pain or the management of
chronic disease [11–13]. Ultimately, the purpose is to develop psychological flexibility, which
refers to the capacity to change or maintain one’s behavior in open contact with thoughts and
feelings [12, 14].

Mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions for patients with fibromyalgia – A systematic review

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions

for chronic pain conditions have showed a number of beneficial effects in patients with
chronic pain, especially in the long-term [15, 16]. For patients diagnosed with FM, the evi-
dence is scarcer. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that cognitive behav-
ioral therapies (CBT), including CBT, MBCT and ACT reduced key symptoms such as pain,
negative mood and disability compared to control interventions [17]. Another systematic
review on MBSR for patients with FM showed that MBSR improved health-related quality of
life and reduced pain intensity compared to usual care and active control groups [18].

There has been an upsurge of mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions across dif-
ferent fields of research. Although the interventions are relatively well described, there may be
differences in how they are delivered and implemented [19], and details of the interventions
may be lacking [20]. Hence, researchers may find it difficult to replicate the interventions in
future trials [21]. Moreover, for clinicians it may be challenging to implement the interven-
tions in clinical practice [22]. In the present systematic review we have applied the Template
for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide [23] (S1 Table) to
explore the intervention components in MBSR, MBCT and ACT as they were presented in
randomized controlled trials.

The aims of this study were:

• to explore content and delivery components in mindfulness- and acceptance-based interven-

tions for patients with FM

• to analyze health effects of mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions for patients

with FM

Materials and method

This systematic review was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook [24] and reported
according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
[25]. The reviewers comprised two experts on mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions
(TH, HAZ) and two methodologists (GS, KBH). Inclusion criteria, methods and analyses were
specified in advance, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018081119).

Search methods for identification of studies

The electronic databases MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central and
AMED were searched from 1990 to January 25th 2019. A medical librarian developed the
MEDLINE search strategy in consultation with the reviewers. The strategy was amended for
each database (S1 Text) and restricted to English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, German,
French, Spanish and Portuguese languages. The reference lists of included studies were exam-
ined for additional potentially eligible studies.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials on mindful-
ness- and acceptance-based interventions for patients with FM. Only full-text articles pub-
lished in peer-reviewed journals were included. The study population was limited to adult
patients (age � 18) diagnosed with FM based on the initial criteria defined by the American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1990 [26] or the revised ACR 2010 criteria [27].

Studies were considered if they followed the standardized format of MBSR, MBCT or ACT

and were compared to no intervention, wait-list control, treatment as usual, or active

interventions. Modified interventions were considered for inclusion if they referred to the
originators of the interventions in the reference list; for MBSR: Kabat-Zinn, MBCT: Teasdale,
Segal, Williams, and ACT: Hayes. The interventions had to comprise 6 to 12 sessions and
include group-based or online mindfulness meditation over at least 6 weeks.

Studies were included if they assessed at least one of the outcomes pain, fatigue, sleep quality,

psychological distress, depression, anxiety, mindfulness, health-related quality of life or work
ability. Effects were categorized as end-of-treatment and follow-up scores (2 to 6 months).

Selection of studies

After duplicate removal, two reviewers (TH and GS) independently screened the titles and
abstracts and selected studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, using Rayyan
screening tool [28]. The articles selected for full-text screening were examined independently
by the same reviewers. Disagreements were rechecked and consensus was achieved by discus-
sion before the final selection. A third reviewer (HAZ) was consulted in cases of dissension.
When needed, study authors were contacted for additional information to clarify study eligi-
bility and obtain further details.

Data extraction and management

General information, population, setting, methods, and participant data were extracted by one
reviewer (TH) and checked by a second reviewer (GS) using a data extraction form created for
the review (S2 Table).

TH and GS used the TIDieR-checklist to extract the intervention components in each study

(S1 Table). Disagreements were rechecked and consensus achieved by discussion before the
final checklist was completed.

Assessment of methodological quality

The Cochrane risk of bias tool [24] was used with six domains separately assessed: sequence gen-
eration, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors,
incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other potential threats to validity. Each domain
was explicitly rated by two reviewers (TH and GS) as low, high or unclear risk of bias (S1 Fig).

GRADEpro [29] was used to rate and summarize the certainty of evidence of the reported
outcomes as high, moderate, low, and very low. As only RCTs were included, the rating started
at high certainty and was downgraded by one or two levels for concerns in one of the five
domains; study limitations, inconsistent results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision and
publication bias [30].

Statistical analysis

If the studies were sufficiently similar regarding participants, interventions, comparisons and
outcomes, we conducted meta-analyses using Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3) from
the Cochrane collaboration [31]. Due to clinical heterogeneity, we decided to perform and
report random-effects analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using tau-squared and I-squared
statistics [32]. Considering shortcomings of the tau-squared estimator in RevMan (Der Simo-
nian and Laird [DL]) we repeated the analyses with the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (SJ)
estimator in R Studio Version 1.1.463 to verify the results [33]. Since the SJ results did not dif-
fer substantially from the DL results, we decided to keep the results from the RevMan analyses.
We computed standardized mean differences (SMDs) because different scales were used to
measure the same outcomes.

Controls included were no intervention, wait-list controls, treatment as usual and other
active interventions. In studies with more than one control arm, we calculated weighted aver-
ages. The mindfulness and health-related quality of life scales were inverted to be comparable
to the other outcomes.

Results
Selection process

Twenty-five of 4430 articles were identified as potentially eligible and screened in full-text (Fig
1). Nine trials met the inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion of 16 trials are presented in
S3 Table.

Trial characteristics

The included trials were published between 2003 and 2018 totaling 750 participants (Table 1).
FM was diagnosed with ACR 1990 classification criteria in seven trials [34–40], and with
ACR 2010 criteria in two trials [41, 42]. Two trials [38, 41] analyzed different outcomes within
the same study population. Both were therefore included in the meta-analysis with the number
of participants counted only once. Parra-Delgado et al. [37] measured pain in seven different
areas of the body without reporting a sum score. The trial was therefore not included for pain
outcomes in the meta-analysis. Simister et al. [42] delivered an internet-based ACT-interven-
tion. Five authors were contacted to clarify diagnostic criteria and randomization procedures.
Two authors provided the requested information; three did not respond.

Exploration of content and delivery components in the interventions

The specific aims, content and mode of delivery of each trial are described in the TIDieR-
checklist [23] (Table 2). The checklist revealed minor distinctions between trials in reporting
and assessment of adherence and fidelity. These are reported below.

Five of the nine included studies, Cash et al. [41], Septhon et al. [39], Luciano et al. [36],
Wicksell et al. [40] and Simister et al. [42] described strategies for adherence and fidelity. Cash
et al. [41] and Septhon et al. [39] monitored attendance and absent participants received a
reminder phone call to attend subsequent sessions. Wicksell et al. [40] provided a 30-minute
session summary for participants who were unable to attend. Absence from five sessions
resulted in discontinuation of the treatment program as well as exclusion from the study. Simis-
ter et al. [42] provided participants with weekly e-mail reminders to complete the program
along with a request to contact a team member if they had any questions or concerns. Luciano
et al. [36] and Wicksell et al. [40] video recorded the instructors’ activities in the sessions to
ensure fidelity and to assess treatment integrity. Luciano et al. [36] reviewed each group session
to assess if the instructors followed the treatment manual. Schmidt et al. [38] did not monitor
fidelity because they were concerned that it might disrupt or influence the intervention.

The adherence, defined as participants completing at least half of the sessions, was relatively

high, i.e. above 80%, in all but one intervention. One trial reported 61% adherence [34] and
the online intervention reported 100% adherence [42]. There were no differences in adherence
between the interventions that reported systematic strategies to maintain or improve fidelity
and interventions that did not report such strategies (S4 Table).

Health effects

The pooled effects were small to moderate in favor of mindfulness- and acceptance-based
interventions at the end of treatment for pain (SMD -0.46 [95% CI -0.75, -0.17]), depression

(SMD -0.49 [95% CI -0.85, -0.12]), anxiety (SMD -0.37 [95% CI -0.71, -0.02]), sleep quality
(SMD -0.33 [-0.70, 0.04]), health-related quality of life (SMD -0.74 [-2.02, 0.54]) and mindful-
ness (SMD -0.40 [-0.69, -0.11]). At follow-up, all effect sizes decreased except for anxiety that
exhibited a small increase in effect size (Fig 2 and Fig 3); (SMD -0.25 [95% CI -0.52, 0.01]),
depression (SMD -0.48 [95% CI -0.77, -0.19]), anxiety (SMD -0.44 [95% CI -0.90, 0.02]), sleep
quality (SMD -0.25 [-0.50, -0.00]), health-related quality of life (SMD -0.61 [-1.48, 0.26]) and

mindfulness (SMD -0.28 [-0.56, 0.01]). Study limitations, inconsistent results and imprecision
in the trials (GRADE), resulted in very low to moderate certainty (S5 Table).

Discussion

The TIDieR-checklist revealed minor differences in content and delivery components among
the nine included interventions. The pooled results from nine RCTs totaling 750 patients with
FM favored mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions in all reported outcomes com-
pared to controls. Using the GRADE criteria, the certainty of the evidence was down-graded
due to study limitations, inconsistent results and imprecision. These results correspond to
another recent systematic review analyzing the effects of CBTs, including ACT and MBCT, on
FM [17]. The majority of the included trials applied the ACR 1990 diagnostic criteria which
are favorably disposed towards women [27]. The vast majority of the study participants were
middle-aged women. The result from this systematic review cannot be generalized to younger
women or to men. As the ACR 2010 diagnostic criteria identify many more male patients,
future trials should aim to include more men [43].

Using the TIDieR-checklist we found that the included trials provided short descriptions of
the interventions and the procedures used (Item 3: Informational materials delivered and Item
4: Procedure used in the intervention) [23]. However, the trial authors referred to the origina-
tors of the interventions for further descriptions. All interventions except one were delivered
as face-to-face group interventions. Simister et al. [42] delivered an individual online ACT-
intervention with therapist support. Online delivery can make interventions more accessible

RCT = Randomized Controlled Trial

BDI = Beck Depression Inventory; 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory. Each question had a set of at least four possible responses, ranging in intensity

MOS SF-36 = Medical Outcome Study Shortform-36 Scores range from 0–100, Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability
VAS = Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity, 0–100, “no pain” (score of 0) and “pain as bad as it could be” or “worst imaginable pain” (score of 100)

SSQ = Stanford Sleep Questionnaire; 7-point scale with scale rating from 1 "feeling active, vital, alert, or awake" to 7 "No longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having

dream-like thoughts"
The Fatigue Symptom Inventory = scale composed of 14 items (one of which is not scored) designed to evaluate multiple aspects of fatigue, including its perceived

severity, frequency, and interference with daily functioning

HRQoL (PLC) = The Quality of life Profile for the Chronically Ill; Questionnaire composed of 40 Likert-scaled items (scale 0–4) with 0 representing minimum and 4
representing maximum satisfaction. The items measure physical, psychological and social capacity of performance and well-being

HADS = Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression

PPS = The Pain Perception Scale; 24-item scale that evaluates pain perception
EQ-5D = Visual analogue scale of EuroQol; EQ-5D self-reported questionnaire includes a visual analog scale (VAS), which records the respondent’s self-rated health

status on a graduated (0–100) scale, with higher scores for higher HRQoL. It also includes the EQ-5D descriptive system, which comprises 5 dimensions of health

CES-D = Center for Epidemiological Studies depression inventory; 20-item, self-report measure designed to measure symptoms of depression over the past week
STAI = State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory; 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale from ’not at all’ to ’very much

so’. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety

PSQI = Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; 19 individual items, creating 7 components producing one global score
FMI = Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory; a 14-item short form measuring Mindfulness

PDI = Pain Disability Index; a self-report tool used for measuring the degree of pain a patient is experiencing. Participants use a 0 (no disability) to 10 (total disability)

numeric rating scale
PIPS = Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale; 16-item scale used to assess psychological inflexibility. Respondents are asked to rate items on a 7-point scale ranging

from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). Higher scores indicate greater levels of psychological inflexibility

SF-MPQ = Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire; 15 items asking participants to rank their typical pain experience on a 4-point Likert scale, from 0 (no pain) to 3
(severe), and maximum total score of 45

FFMQ = Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; 39-items questionnaire measuring 5 facets of mindfulness

SF-36 = Short form-36 Healthy Survey, 36-item measure assessing health-related quality of life. Higher scores indicate better functioning
�The Quality of life Profile for the Chronically Ill was reported as six dimensions and therefore not included in this review
��The Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity was measured on seven different parts of the body and not included in this review
���The Pain Perception Scale was divided into affective and sensory and only sensory was included in this review

to patients e.g. in rural areas since logistic barriers such as travel or limited access to trained
therapists are eliminated [44]. As reported in S8, Simister et al. [42] obtained 100% adherence
which might support further development and exploration of online interventions for FM in
future research.

Crane et al. [19] have proposed that clarity regarding fidelity to the content and program
structure is essential in research on mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions. Review-
ing the TIDieR-checklist Item 12 (How well intervention adherence and fidelity was assessed)
we found no differences in actual adherence between trials that reported systematic strategies
to improve or maintain fidelity and adherence and the trials that did not report such strategies.
All over, actual adherence was relatively high in the included trials. Adherence might be influ-
enced by other aspects that are not explored in this review or not reported in the trials. Since
the included treatment interventions often deal with personal emotional issues and require an

atmosphere of trust, monitoring fidelity might be disruptive or influence the process [38].
However, we believe that strategies to improve or maintain fidelity and adherence are of
importance and might contribute to ensure the core intentions of the interventions in future
research [19].

Fatigue and work ability were predefined outcomes in our review. Importantly; none of the

included trials measured work ability, even though previous research has demonstrated that
FM can have a high impact on work ability [45]. Only one trial [41] measured fatigue and con-
sequently, this outcome was not included in the meta-analysis. Three of the nine included tri-
als, Schmidt et al. [38], Cash et al. [41] and Simister et al. [42], measured sleep quality. Fatigue
and sleep disturbances are common in FM [1], and can lower the pain threshold, trigger mus-
culoskeletal pain and increase emotional distress [46]. Future research should include mea-
surements for pain, fatigue, sleep and health-related quality of life to evaluate whether
mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions are more effective for particular outcomes
for patients with FM [16, 47].

We did not include the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) which captures the over-

all impact of FM symptomatology [48]. The reason for excluding FIQ was that it does not
allow separate measures of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety.

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis on mindfulness- and acceptance-based
interventions for patients with chronic pain conditions have reported beneficial long-term
effects on pain, depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life [15]. The longest follow-
up assessment in the trials included in our review was six months. Future studies with longer
follow-up periods are needed.

We estimated tau-squared using both the DL and the SJ estimator. The Knapp-Hartung
approach (SJ) is known to suit systematic reviews including few studies, particularly when
dealing with 5 or fewer trials [49]. The RevMan uses the DL method and is known as the stan-
dard estimator [31]. We have chosen to report the results from the meta-analyses computed in
RevMan since the results were mainly similar and the small differences had no influence on
the conclusion.

To our best knowledge, this review is the first to use the TIDieR-checklist to describe and

explore content and delivery components in mindfulness- and acceptance-based interven-
tions. The included trials met fairly rigorous criteria. Some studies were excluded because
ACR diagnostic criteria had not been followed or the randomization procedures were not
clearly reported. We contacted the authors of these studies and if they did not respond, the tri-
als were excluded.

The TIDieR-checklist may be appropriate to use in conjunction with the CONSORT-
checklist [50] when reporting randomized controlled trials. We expected that the TIDieR-
checklist would be appropriate for description and exploration of mindfulness- and accep-
tance-based interventions. MBSR and MBCT are relatively clearly described and manualized
interventions and major differences were not revealed in any TIDieR items except for the
items describing fidelity and adherence as discussed above. The TIDieR-checklist might be
more suitable for exploring more complex interventions that are not described in manuals.

Mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions for patients with fibromyalgia – A systematic review

Nevertheless, the TIDieR-checklist allows the authors to better describe interventions in suffi-
cient details to make replication possible [23].

Adopting the optimal version of mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions might
be difficult due to the heterogeneity between the included trials [22]. Some of the pooled effects
were also based on a small number of trials. Users of mindfulness- and acceptance-based inter-
ventions should consider the effects against risk of bias, adherence, and fidelity in the included
trials (Tables 1, 2) [20]. Future trials should investigate whether strategies to improve adher-
ence and fidelity of mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions can improve health
outcomes.

Conclusions

Overall, the mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions included in this review were
associated with small to moderate uncertain effects on pain, depression, anxiety, sleep quality,
health-related quality of life and mindfulness for female patients with FM compared to con-
trols. In our review we found no association between the mindfulness- and acceptance-based
interventions that reported strategies to improve adherence and fidelity and trials that did not
report such strategies. Future trials should monitor adherence and fidelity to explore this asso-
ciation more extensively. There was heterogeneity between trials, and down-grading in
GRADE resulted in very low, low and moderate certainty of evidence. Only limited conclu-
sions can therefore be drawn. The TIDieR-checklist is a useful supplement that can improve
the reporting of RCTs but might be less informative for manualized interventions.
