Depression is a common mental health condition for which many mobile apps aim to pro-
vide support. This review aims to identify self-help apps available exclusively for people
with depression and evaluate those that offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or beha-
vioural activation (BA). One hundred and seventeen apps have been identified after search-
ing both the scientific literature and the commercial market. 10.26% (n = 12) of these apps
identified through our search offer support that seems to be consistent with evidence-based
principles of CBT or BA. Taking into account the non existence of effectiveness/efficacy
studies, and the low level of adherence to the core ingredients of the CBT/BA models, the
utility of these CBT/BA apps are questionable. The usability of reviewed apps is highly vari-
able and they rarely are accompanied by explicit privacy or safety policies. Despite the
growing public demand, there is a concerning lack of appropiate CBT or BA apps, especially
from a clinical and legal point of view. The application of superior scientific, technological,
and legal knowledge is needed to improve the development, testing, and accessibility of
apps for people with depression.

Introduction

Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders [1] which often begins in ado-
lescence and if left untreated, may persist into adulthood [2]. It ranks 4th in the global burden
of disease [3]and is of significant economic cost to society[4]. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
(CBT) and Behavioural Activation (BA) are now an accepted evidence-based first-line treat-
ment for depression [5]. Both CBT and BA have meta-analytic level of evidence in the treat-
ment of depression[6,7]. Periodic face-to-face sessions between therapist and patient have been
the most traditional medium to deliver CBT and BA. However, with population estimates of

Systematic Review of CBT and BA Apps for Depression

Major Depression at 6.7% and even higher for Non-Major Depression [1], it is unlikely that
this traditional approach can reach everyone.

More recent research indicates that depression can be treated successfully with CBT and BA
based self-help interventions delivered over the Internet [8,9,10]. This type of therapy is suited
for digital delivery as demonstrated by the fact that there are more Internet-based studies on
CBT/BA than on other evidence-based models (e.g., Interpersonal Therapy or Acceptance and
Commitment Therpy). There is a strong case in healthcare for addressing access to CBT or BA
through the use of technology, with mobile applications (apps) being one possible means of
delivery. Apps could be especially useful in early treatment of depression in young people who
report high levels of smartphone device use [11].

Smartphone use is a growing phenomenon [12] and has the advantage of being accessible,
mobile, and easy to operate, with decreasing cost of use. Smartphones have been used to facili-
tate the delivery of healthcare interventions including treatment of mental health conditions
[13]. The number of apps intended to help people cope with depression is increasing rapidly,
especially in the commercial marketplace [14,15]; however the development process, usability,
feasibility, and efficacy of these apps developed in the commercial marketplace are rarely
assessed or reported. The quality of the available apps has not been the subject of any system-
atic reviews, until now.

It is vital to perform a systematic review of apps for depression to identify what currently
available apps are based on strong and recommended evidence models for depression. Evaluat-
ing the available apps can inform future development of effective smartphone delivered inter-
vention for depression. The purpose of this systematic review was twofold: (1) To identify all
currently-available native apps that provide information, support or treatment for depression;
(2) To evaluate CBT or BA self-help (either guided or unguided) apps on their usefulness,
usability, and integration and infrastructure, as recommended by Chan et al. [16]. Usefulness
was determined by evaluating how accurately each CBT/BA app tapped into the core of the
CBT and BA models, and by exploring whether the efficacy or effectiveness of the CBT/BA
apps have been proven or not. Usability was evaluated by comparing each CBT/BA app to a list
of heuristics, and integration and infrastructure was evaluated by looking whether the CBT/BA
apps included a privacy policy and addressed safety issues.

The results of this review can assist care providers in choosing appropriate apps for the
treatment or research of depression. The review will also identify areas for future development
to effectively provide CBT or BA for depression through smartphones.

Methods

Inclusion and Exclusion criteria

We included in our review those apps that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) the app
description stated that they provide treatment or support for depression as its exclusive goal;
(2) the app was publically available for download within Canada at the time this review was
performed (December, 2015), and consequently also fully available for evaluation by the
research team; (3) the app was defined as a native app (i.e., developed for one particular mobile
device and installed directly onto the device itself) compatible with smartphones. We excluded
from the review those apps which specifically addressed depressed subpopulations (e.g.,
depressed people with diabetes, postpartum depression) because they have special health care
needs that require different care. We also excluded those apps that were designed to support
health care professionals working with depressed populations because these apps are addressed
to a different audience. We excluded web-based/Internet-enabled apps only accessible via the

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0154248 May 2, 2016

mobile device’s Web browser because they are very challenging to identify in a systematic way.
Finally, we also excluded those apps which were only available in a non-English language.

Search strategy

The apps included in this review were identified by searching both the scientific literature and
commercial marketplace.

The search of the scientific literature. The following databases from health sciences and

computer science were searched: IEEE, ACM Digital Library, EMBASE, PubMed (Medline),
PsychINFO, and Web of Science. A library information specialist created the database-specific
search strategies by combining population-specific term (i.e., depression) and terms related to
technical delivery (i.e., app, smartphone, mobile phone, cell phone, text message, iphone, and
android), narrowing the results to those studies related to depression and mobile apps. Search
strategy in S1 Appendix displays the strategy for retrieving relevant manuscripts from PubMed.
The library information specialist did the search in November 2015. During the first level of
screening, two reviwers (AH, SR) independently assessed a random selection of 15% of the
titles and abstracts retrieved from search (350 electronic search results) to determine inter-
rater agreement on inclusion and exclusion criteria. With substantial levels of agreement
(kappa = 0.69) observed [17], the remaining titles and abstracts were screened by only one
reviewer (SR). At the second level of screening, potential relevant full- text articles were
reviewed and a random selection of 30% of articles (a subset of 50 articles) were independently
assessed by two reviewers (AH, SR). Articles were excluded at this stage from further consider-
ation for a number of reasons (i.e., article did not talk about depression, article did not make
mention of any native app, the app mentioned in the article was not addressed to people with
depression, the manuscript was not written in English). With substantial levels of agreement
observed at this second level of screening (kappa = 0.85) [17], the remaining full-text articles
were reviewed by only one reviewer (SR). The 53 manuscripts included at this stage mentioned
a total of 253 native apps for people with depression. Two independent reviewers (SR, AH)
independently evaluated whether a random selection of 50% of these 253 apps (n = 125) meet
the eligibility criteria based on our inclusion/exclusion criteria. With almost perfect agreement
observed at this third level of screening (kappa = 0.92) [17], the remaining apps were reviewed
by only one reviewer (SR). Contact was made with corresponding authors to request access to
any apps described in a manuscript where there was no information provided on public access
for downloading. Discrepancies at any level of screening were resolved by consensus among
reviewers. See Fig 1 for details about the screening process.

The search of the commercial market place. The search was restricted to apps available
through the two most popular mobile phone platforms, The Canadian Apple App Store and
Android Market (Google Play). The search was made in November 2015 using ‘depression’ as
the search query. One reviewer (JC) searched the stores to identify all of the available apps, and
two reviewers (AH, JC) independently evaluated each identified unique app for eligibility
based on our inclusion/exclusion criteria. The level of agreement between both independent
reviewers using the Cohen’s Kappa was 0.89. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
See Fig 1 for further details.

Data extraction

The apps retrieved by our searches were categorized by two independent reviewers (AH, JC)
according to the type(s) of support that they offered to the users. The categories, defined a pri-
ori, included: self- tracking tools, education, social support, CBT/BA treatment, state induction,
diagnostic/screening tools, and miscellaneous. One app could be categorized into different

Systematic Review of CBT and BA Apps for Depression

types of self-help apps when the app included more than one type of support. All the apps
included in the review were available in the app stores, regardless of where they were identified
(i.e., scientific literature vs commercial market). The app description displayed in the stores
and any available description provided in the manuscript was the only information used by the
reviewers to base their decisions on which category each app fell into. The level of agreement
between the two reviewers when categorizing the apps, using the Cohen’s kappa, was 0.92, indi-
cating almost perfect agreement [17]. When reviewers were in disagreement, they discussed it,
and came to an agreement. When an agreement could not be reached, a third reviewer was
called upon (SR). For those apps that were classified as CBT/BA the following information was
extracted: accessibility (i.e., iTunes, Google Play, scientific literature), cost, and indicators of
popularity (i.e., for the apps identified through the Google Play store, the number of times an
app has been downloaded to an android phone; for the apps identified through the Google
Play store or the iTunes store, the number of users that have rated the app on a scale of 1 to 5
as well as the average satisfaction rate provided by users; although both types of information
are only available when there is a large, unspecified amount of users that have rated the app).
Assessment of CBT/BA apps. Since our primary focus of attention was CBT or BA only
those apps that offered this type of treatment were downloaded for full evaluation. When both
a paid and free version of an app was available, the version requiring payment was purchased
and used, while the free version was excluded. This was done to ensure that the most compre-
hensive version of the app was considered. In accordance with Chan et al [16], who have
recently proposed a framework to evaluate mobile mental health apps, we evaluated each app
on three dimensions using the following criteria:

Usefulness: To determine the usefulness of the apps, the validity and accuracy (does the app
actually offer CBT or BA?), and effectiveness (is the app clinically effective–with demonstrated
improved outcomes- for people with depression?) criteria were used. To evaluate whether the app
actually offers CBT or BA, an experienced academic CBT clinician (SR) evaluated the apps for
their level of fidelity to theoretical CBT and BA principles by exploring what extent the apps
included the core ingredients of these models. The evaluator has extensive experience in training
CBT therapists and devising CBT clinical programmes. The core ingredients for CBT and BA
were derived by consulting with two academic experts and one CBT clinician, as well as reviewing
the literature for CBT and BA models in the treatment of depression [18,19]. The following were
considered as the core ingredients of a CBT approach for depression: 1) education about depres-
sion; 2) explanation of the model, 3) depression rating, 4) monitoring cognitions, 5) monitoring
emotions, 6) monitoring physical sensations, 7) monitoring behaviours, 8) conceptualization, 9)
behavioural techniques, and 10) cognitive techniques. The following were considered as the core
ingredients of the various BA approaches: 1) education about depression, 2) explanation of the
model, 3) depression rating, 4) activity monitoring, 5) giving each activity a rating for pleasure, 6)
giving each activity a rating for mastery, 7) activity scheduling of pleasant behaviours, and 8)
activity scheduling of avoided behaviours. The expert evaluated each app against each core ingre-
dient on a 0–2 scale where 0 meant that the core ingredient was not integrated at all into the app,
and 2 meant that the core ingredient was completely integrated. Table 1 displays the scoring sys-
tem devised for rating of the apps against each core ingredient. For each app, a percent total score
(sum of item scores/maximum possible score (cid:1) 100), representing the level of adherence of the
app to the theoretical principles of CBT and BA approaches, was then calculated. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the apps, we cross-referenced with apps identified in the scientific literature to see
whether there was any efficacy or effectiveness study on apps included in the review.

Usability: The usability of the app (can the user easily–or with minimal training- use and

understand the app?) was used to evaluate this dimension. Most apps retrieved from our
searches have been developed by small businesses or sole proprietors outside of academic

settings, and little information is available on the app development process or evidence of
formal usability testing. For this reason, a user experience designer (MW), who regulary per-
forms expert reviews on mobile apps and websites, where he applies heuristics and profes-
sional experience to evaluate user interfaces and suggest design improvements, evaluated
the usability of the apps. He evaluated the user interface of each app using a common list of
usability heuristics proposed by Nielsen & Mack [20]. The usability expert rated each app on
a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent) against each usability heuristic (see Table 2 for the
set of heuristics). A percentage total score (sum of item scores/maximum possible total
score (cid:1) 100) was then calculated, indicating the extent to which the user interface of the app
met the usability heuristics.

Integration and infrastructure: Privacy and safety were the criteria used to evaluate this
dimension. To evaluate privacy, an evaluator (SR) looked into whether the apps provided users
with a privacy policy (within the apps themselves or on a website linked to the app). If a privacy
policy was available the evaluator assessesed the scope and the level of transparency of the pol-
icy as done by Sunyaev et al. [21]. To this end, the evaluator determined whether the policy
addressed the following content categories important to users: type of information collected
(e.g., operational, behavioral, sensitive), rationale for collection (i.e., app operation, personali-
zation, secondary use), sharing of information (i.e., service provision, social interaction, third
party), and users controls (i.e., supervision, notification, correction). To evaluate safety, an
evaluator (SR) explored whether the apps had any mechanisms in place to handle high risk of
suicidality (e.g. providing emergency contact information whenever the app detects a user is at
high risk for committing suicide).

Analysis Plan

The system should always keep users informed about what is
going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

The system should speak the users' language, with words,
phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-
oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information
appear in a natural and logical order.

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a
clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state
without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo
and redo.

Users should not have to wonder whether different words,
situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform
conventions.

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which
prevents a problem from occurring in the ﬁrst place. Either
eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present
users with a conﬁrmation option before they commit to the action.
Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and
options visible. The user should not have to remember information
from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the
system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever
appropriate.
Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up
the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater
to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor
frequent actions.

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or
rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue
competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes
their relative visibility.

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no
codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest
a solution.

Even though it is better if the system can be used without
documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and
documentation. Any such information should be easy to search,
focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out,
and not be too large.

Basic summary statistics including counts and percentages were used to describe the character-
istics of the apps. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to explore whether a relationship
may exist between the adherence of the user interface to Nilsen’s principles of usability and
adherence to the core principles underlying CBT and BA. Spearman’s correlation coefficients
were also used to explore whether adherence to the core principlies underlying CBT and BA
and adherence to Nilsen’s principles of usability is related with any indicator of popularity and
acceptability (i.e., average rating of satisfaction, number of reviews and number of downloads).

Results

Search

Our search of commercial marketplace identified a total of 310 unique apps. One hundred and
four of these apps identified in the commercial marketplace meet our inclusion/exclusion

criteria. The literature search yielded 2,789 abstracts, and 160 full text manuscripts were
reviewed at the full-text level. Fifty-three out of 160 were relevant for our review because all
them mention at least one native app addressed to people for depression. Many of these manu-
scripts identified as relevant for our review were reports or reviews reporting on multiple apps.
For example, Shen et al. [14], has recently conducted a systematic review to identify and char-
acterize all the apps available in the app stores to support people with depression, their families
and health care professionals, based on the store description. The 53 manuscripts [9,14,15,22,
23,24, 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48, 49,50,51,52,
53,54,55, 56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65, 66,67,68,69,70,71] identified as relevant to the review
made mention of a total of 48 unique apps that met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thirty-
five of these 48 apps were also identified through our search of the commercial marketplace.
See Fig 1 for a flowchart of the screening process of the apps.

App characteristics

Out of the total 117 apps, 36 apps (30.77%) were available on iOS only, 74 (63.25%) were avail-
able on Android only, and 7 (5.98%) were available across both platforms. The most typical
type of self-help support delivered through these 117 apps was education (n = 32, 27.35%) and
diagnostic/screening support (n = 30, 25.64%), followed by state induction (n = 18, 15.38%).
The least typical types of self-help support delivered through these 117 apps were tracking
(n = 10, 8.55%) and social support (n = 3, 2.56%). Twelve of these 117 apps (10.26%) were clas-
sified by the reviewers as delivering CBT or BA; these CBT/BA apps were identified in the
description by their developers as CBT or BA apps or they seemed to offer CBT or BA based
on their general description (Table 3).

CBT/BA apps characteristics

Five of the 12 CBT/BA apps (41.67%) were available on iOS only and 5 (41.67%) on Android
only. The cost of these CBT/BA apps ranged from $0.00 to $8.99. The Depression CBT Self-
Help Guide and The Mood Tools–Depression Aid were those Android apps with the highest
number of downloads (i.e., between 100,000 and 500,000 downloads, and between 50,000 and
100,000, respectively) and received high user satisfaction ratings (average satisfaction rates
were 4.2 and 4.3, respectively). The iPhone app that received the highest user satisfaction rating
was The Depression Cure: The Free 12 Week Course app (average satisfaction rating = 4.5).
However, this app was not the one that received the highest number of reviews. The iPhone
apps that received the highest number of reviews were the Anti-depression and MoodTools–
Depression Aid apps, both of them also available for download in the Google Play store. For
further information about the characteristics of the CBT/BA apps see Table 4.

Regarding the validy and accuracy of the CBT/BA apps, the median level of adherence with
the CBT principles was 15% (range = 0–75%) and the median level of adherence with the BA
principles was 18.75% (range = 6.25–25%). The best apps from a theoretical perspective were
Depression CBT Self-Help Guide and eCBT Mood meeting 75% and 55% of the qualifying cri-
teria for CBT, respectively. The rest of the apps presented less than 50% of adherence for both
the CBT and BA principles (see Table 5). The core ingredients of CBT most commonly
included in these CBT/BA apps were: education about depression and depression ratings. The
core ingredients included least often were: monitoring physical sensations, monitoring behav-
iors, and conceptualization. The core ingredients of BA most commonly included were: educa-
tion about depression and depression ratings and the rest of the core ingredients were never
completely integrated into the apps. Regarding the effectiveness of the apps, there were no

a ASR- Average Satisfaction Rating
bSome apps do not have enough user reviews to have an average rating, stated by n/a.

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0154248.t004

scoring 98%, 98%, and 92% respectively. The most frequent heuristic violations of these CBT/
BA apps were: visibility of the system status, and consistency and standards. See Table 6.

Only the eCBT app and the Depression CBT Self-Help Guide app offer a privacy policy.
The eCBTapp has a brief privacy policy that states that the information collected in the app is
only accessed by the application on the device and they do not collect any information about
the user or the use of the app. The Depression CBT Self-Help Guide app’s privacy policy
applies to this app in particular, but also other products of its developer (other apps and its
homepage). This policy is available on the developer’s homepage but is also available to users
after they have downloaded the app. Its privacy policy indicates what information is collected
and for what purpose, whether this information is shared with others but it does not address
users control. Five out of the 12 apps (41.66%) provide important safety information during
crisis.See Table 7 for details about what information is provided and how.

No relationship was found between the level of adherence of the app to the theoretical CBT
or BA model and the level of adherence with the heuristics usability (rs = -0.45, p = 0.13 and rs
= 0.30, p = 0.33, respectively). Also, no relationship was found between level of adherence of
the app to the theoretical models and the indicators of popularity (range = rs = -0.02, p = 0.96

and rs = 0.57, p = 0.18), or between level of adherence of the app with the heuristic usability
with the indicators of popularity (range = rs = 0.15, p = 0.68 and rs = 0.59, p = 0.07).

Discussion

While there are a large number of phone apps designed to assist those with depression available
through the commercial market, few of these utilize a CBT or BA approach despite these being
the gold standard of first line psychological treatments [72]. The few apps that provide CBT or
BA seem to be popular based on the number of downloads, with 4 out of 7 of the Android
available apps achieving more than ten thousand downloads.

Chan et al. [16] have recently proposed a framework that can be used for patients and
health care providers to evaluate existing mental health mobile apps and help them make
informed choices about their use. Chan et al. [16] suggest evaluating apps on three broad
dimensions: usefulness, usability, and integration/infrastructure. After evaluating the useful-
ness dimension of the CBT/BA apps taking into account the main usefulness criteria of
‘effectiveness’, we can see that there is no available information on effectiveness. The few
available apps that offer CBT or BA have either not been tested or the results derived from
these tests have not been reported in the scientific literature. This means that we do not have
any direct evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these CBT/BA apps and consequently we
do not have direct scientific proof to support their use. All the apps identified through
searching the scientific literature were simply cited in reviews [14]; they were not evaluated
in primary research studies. Although no data on the efficacy of these CBT/BA apps have
been published, we need to acknowledge that evidence may exist outside scientific journals.
Knowledge can be disseminated through grey literature. The lack of direct scientific evidence
for these CBT/BA apps, however, becomes especially alarming after evaluating the validity
and accuracy of the content of these apps from an expert’s point of view. Of those apps which
do use CBT or BA, some apps may provide benefits by partially applying CBT or BA princi-
ples, but the majority do not come close to including the core ingredients of a CBT or BA
program. The lack of fidelity to proven CBT or BA principles could hamper the efficacy of
these programs.

When evaluating the usability dimension, we have seen that the usability of the available
CBT/BA apps is highly variable and likely serves as a barrier to adoption and regular usage for
those apps that violate a large number of heuristics. For instance, the Depression CBT Self-
Help Guide app has the highest fidely to CBT models, but the low usability score could compli-
cate its use. There is a danger that users of these available CBT/BA apps may interpret ineffec-
tiveness as a treatment failure, when in fact, ineffectiveness may be the result of usability
problems or the inappropriate application of the CBT or BA model.

On the one hand, there doesn’t appear to be a correlation between CBT/BA model adher-
ence and usability, which means that a good application of the clinical theoretical CBT or BA
knowledge when designing the app does not imply a good use of principles of usability, and/or
vice versa. On the other hand, the degree to which the apps contain these core ingredients of
the CBT and BA models does not appear to be correlated with the extent to which users like
the app, the number of downloads, or the number of reviews for the app. Equally, the level of
usability of the CBT/BA apps does not appear to be correlated with the extent to which users
like the app, the number of downloads or the number of reviews for the app. This finding is
not surprising; previous reviews have found no relationship between the quality of the apps
and consumers reviews or ratings [73,74]. Therefore, users should be careful when using the
information available on the app download page to judge the app, since this information can
be misleading.

Systematic Review of CBT and BA Apps for Depression

When evaluating the integration and infrastructure dimension, we have seen that safety
information is not always available in apps, and very rarely are users provided with a privacy
policy. This lack of availability of privacy information seems to be an issue for mental health
apps in general [21]. Research has shown that privacy is a concern for many health care profes-
sionals and patients [75] and this concern is a reason for them to decline the use information
technology [75,76,77] as part of their care.

We have identified through our systematic review four apps in English that offer CBT or
BA treatment for depression and have been studied by researchers and published in scientific
papers, the Behavioural Activation Scheduling [50], the Get Happy Program [40], CBT
Mobilwork [65] and Mobilyze [45]. However, these four apps have not been included in our
full analysis because they are not currently available for download by the public, at least from
within Canada. The lack of empirically tested apps identified during this review is consistent
with observations in other health fields [36] and raises concerns about relying on these tools
to support treatment for depression. We therefore launch a call for scientists and/or app
developers interested in the opportunities that mobile communication technology offers in
terms of improving access to mental health care to test the existing best apps and determine
from the outset how to best implement and sustain the apps over time given that technology
is evolving rapidly. It is also important when designing new CBT/BA apps to try to integrate
the core ingredients of these theoretical models, and to address the heuristics in order to opti-
mize clinical benefits and make the app more usable. Finally, it is important that scientists
and developers are more transparent about legal and regulatory aspects of the apps related to
privacy issues (e.g., [78]). Failure to effectively plan for sustainable dissemination of apps as
well as the lack of consideration of legal aspects may present significant barriers for using
apps.

This review is not without limitations. First, this review was limited to English download-
able apps in Canada and only looked at the two most popular platforms when exploring the
commercial market. Different apps may be available on less prevalent platforms or in other lan-
guages and/or countries, and in fact we excluded apps developed and tested in the academic
setting for these reasons[9,40]. Second, the evaluation of the CBT and BA apps was based on
the opinion of one expert. Although expert opinion plays an important role when no research
evidence exists, the use of an expert panel instead of only one expert could have increased the
credibility of the conclusions. Finally, although it was not the primary goal of this review, the
lack of common constructs, outcome measures, definitions and/or standards for tracking, state
induction, diagnostic/screening, and education apps make cross-case comparison of these dif-
ferent types of self-help apps impossible.

In summary, given the prevalence of depression [1] and the known effectiveness of CBT
and BA in addressing this mental health condition [6,7], a mobile app based on clinical best
practice, that meets the most basic usability standards, that is evaluated scientifically, has a pri-
vacy policy, and deals with safety matters has the potential to remove barriers to care and alle-
viate suffering for a large number of people with depression at a modest cost. Therefore, efforts
towards achieving this are necessary.
