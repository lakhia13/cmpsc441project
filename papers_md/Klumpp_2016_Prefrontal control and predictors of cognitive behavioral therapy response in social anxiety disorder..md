Abstract

Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with aberrant anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) response to threat dis-
tractors. Perceptual load has been shown to modulate ACC activity such that under high load, when demands on processing
capacity is restricted, individuals with gSAD exhibit compensatory activation to threat distractors yet under low load, there
is evidence of reduced activation. It is not known if neural predictors of response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
based on such emotional conﬂict resolution, interact with demands on controlled processes. Prior to CBT, 32 patients with
gSAD completed an fMRI task involving a target letter in a string of identical targets (low perceptual load) or a target letter in
a mixed letter string (high perceptual load) superimposed on fearful, angry and neutral face distractors. Whole-brain voxel-
wise analyses revealed better CBT outcome was predicted by more frontopartial activity that included dorsal ACC (dACC)
and insula to threat (vs neutral) distractors during high, but not low, perceptual load. Psychophysiological interaction analy-
sis with dACC as the seed region revealed less connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to threat distractors during
high load. Results indicate patients with less regulatory capability when demands on higher-order control are great may
beneﬁt more from CBT.

Introduction

Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is a common psychi-
atric illness characterized by inappropriate, pervasive fears of
potential scrutiny by others across a variety of social and/or per-
formance situations (American Psychiatric Association, 2000;
Kessler et al., 2005). ‘Gold standard’ psychotherapy for gSAD and
other internalizing disorders (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder,
major depressive disorder) is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
(Butler et al., 2006). While generally effective,
treatment
response varies and many remain symptomatic after complet-
ing CBT (Heimberg et al., 1998; Davidson et al., 2004).

The neurobiology of gSAD points to dysfunction in fear cir-
cuitry evinced by consistent reports of exaggerated amygdala
reactivity and abnormal prefrontal cortical activation to

threat-relevant signals (Bru¨ hl et al., 2014). In CBT, techniques
such as cognitive restructuring to alter maladaptive thoughts
and the facing of social fears (e.g. in vivo exposures) (Heimberg,
2002) suggest individual differences in regions involved in fear
processes (e.g. amygdala; LeDoux, 2000; Hariri and Whalen,
2011) and its regulation [e.g. anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), lat-
eral prefrontal cortex; Gross, 2002; Phillips et al., 2003; Ochsner
et al., 2009; Etkin, 2010] may help ‘set the stage’ in CBT outcome.
For example, in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), CBT suc-
cess was shown to be predicted by less responsivity to masked
fearful faces in amygdala and rostral ACC indicating excessive
anxiety to threat prior to CBT led to poorer response (Bryant
et al., 2008). In major depressive disorder (MDD), which shares

exaggerated amygdala and dorsal ACC response to negative
stimuli; Hamilton et al., 2012), less pre-CBT subgenual ACC
activity also corresponded with CBT success though, here,
greater treatment response was predicted by more amygdala
reactivity to negative words (Siegle et al., 2006). Thus, in MDD
patients with less ability to regulate affective state yet greater
reactivity to mood-congruent stimuli did better in CBT (Siegle
et al., 2006).

In gSAD, a slightly different pattern has been demonstrated.
Doehrmann et al. (2013) were the first to show patients with
enhanced ability to regulate emotions to threat-relevant stimuli
had greater symptom improvement as signified by more pre-CBT
activation in secondary visual areas (dorsal and ventral occipito-
temporal cortex) as well as dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal
regions, though these frontal areas emerged at a trend level.

We also observed a relationship between symptom improve-
ment and more activation in visual areas (middle temporal and
angular gyri) and prefrontal regions (e.g. medial orbitofrontal,
dorsomedial frontal gyrus) (Klumpp et al., 2013). Additionally, in
a study of emotion processing and sustained attentional control
to emotional face distractors, symptom change in gSAD was
predicted by less amygdala and more dorsal ACC activation,
respectively (Klumpp et al., 2014). Collectively, data suggest
gSAD patients with greater automatic emotion regulation and
less emotional reactivity to socioemotional signals prior to CBT
might better manage the distress evoked in CBT and conse-
quently gain more from treatment.

In a departure from emotion perception, Falconer et al. (2013)
examined neural predictors related to inhibitory control (Go/No
Go task) in PTSD and reported symptom improvement was fore-
told by activation in a discrete frontostriatal network (e.g. ante-
rior medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal/inferior
frontal
gyrus, dorsal striatum). In contrast, less improvement was asso-
ciated with activation in a widely distributed frontoparietal-
striatal
frontal/
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex/insula, precuneus, putamen,
cerebellum). Results indicate PTSD patients with more efficient
top-down control were likely to benefit more from CBT
(Falconer et al., 2013).

and

While methodological differences across studies, including
patient sample, may have contributed to mixed results, accu-
mulating data suggest pre-CBT cortical and/or limbic response
to relevant stimuli may serve as biomarkers in CBT outcome.
For gSAD, data suggest regulatory ability is capitalized on by
CBT; however, findings are largely based on studies of emotion
perception. A next step would be to examine predictors related
to higher-order control over threat distractors given cognitive
models of social anxiety propose attentional bias to threat plays
a key role in the maintenance of fears (Clark and Wells, 1995;
Mogg and Bradley, 1998). A means of evaluating attentional bias
relates to perceptual
load theory, which proposes task-
irrelevant stimuli (i.e. distractors) are subject to being processed
unless attentional load capacity is exhausted (Lavie, 1995, 2000;
Lavie et al., 2009). Thus, under low perceptual load, resources
towards cognitive goals are available to process distractors,
whereas, under high load, the restriction of attentional capacity
inhibits the processing of distractors. Therefore, an advantage
of the model is its ability to probe facilitatory and inhibitory
processes in the context of salient, task-irrelevant distractors.

In gSAD, difficulty ‘ignoring’ sensory-driven, bottom-up
threat distractors may be due in part to aberrant ACC. The ACC
is part of a corticolimbic system that plays a role in the
appraisal of salient stimuli, generation of adaptive responses
and regulation of emotional state (Bush et al., 2000; Etkin et al.,

H. Klumpp et al.

2011). The affective, ventral-rostral region has connections with
limbic (e.g. amygdala) and paralimbic (e.g. insula, orbitofrontal
cortex) structures (Devinsky et al., 1995) and is primarily associ-
ated with emotional conflict resolution (Etkin et al., 2006; Egner
et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2009) and evaluative functions (e.g.
assessing salience of stimuli) (Bush et al., 2000; Etkin et al., 2011).
The cognitive area instead, with interconnections to other corti-
cal regions (e.g. lateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor
cortex) (Devinsky et al., 1995), is more closely involved with con-
flict-related processes (e.g. conflict monitoring, error detection)
and adaptive response to motivationally relevant information
(Carter et al., 1998; Bush et al., 2000; MacDonald et al., 2000;
Botvinick et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2006; Banich et al., 2009; Etkin
et al., 2011).

Evidence of ACC dysfunction during emotional conflict in
gSAD include observations of exaggerated rostral (rACC) activa-
tion to threat distractors, relative to healthy controls, when
attentional capacity resources are restricted (high perceptual
load) denoting a compensatory response in gSAD to maintain
goal-directed behavior (Wheaton et al., 2014). However, when
demands on control are relatively low (i.e. task is fairly easy to
execute) gSAD is associated with deficient rACC recruitment to
salient face distractors (Klumpp et al., 2013; Wheaton et al.,
2014). These data are consistent with findings by Bishop et al.
(2007) who reported an inverse relationship between trait anxi-
ety level and recruitment in dorsal ACC, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and ventrolateral PFC (with a non-significant trend
towards rACC) to threat face distractors when perceptual load
was low. Together, when resources to process task-irrelevant
stimuli are very much constrained, there may be protracted
engagement of control processes in gSAD. Yet, when more
resources are available to process distractors (e.g. low percep-
tual load), there is evidence of impoverished frontal engage-
ment in anxious individuals.

Results suggest ACC activity is modulated by perceptual load
in gSAD and that individual differences in ACC, along the lines
of attenuated or compensatory neural response during conflict
resolution, may interact with CBT. Based on the literature, we
hypothesized greater control over task-irrelevant threat faces
prior to CBT would portend better response to CBT. Accordingly,
under low perceptual load, change in symptom severity was
expected to correspond with more activation in areas such as
dorsal ACC, lateral PFC and/or rostral medial PFC (Devinsky
et al., 1995; Bush et al., 2000; Ochsner et al., 2009; Etkin et al.,
2011). For high perceptual load, we hypothesized patients with
greater focal activation to threat distractors in medial and/or
lateral PFC would improve more after completing CBT. To
explore other areas that contributed to pre-CBT response during
cognitive control, significant a priori regions of interest were fol-
lowed-up with psychophysiological interactions analysis.

Method

Participants

All participants provided written informed consent as approved
by the local Institutional Review Board at the University of
Illinois at Chicago (UIC) (n ¼ 22) and University of Michigan (UM)
(n ¼ 10). Data on a portion of the University of Michigan partici-
pants (n ¼ 9) were published previously (Wheaton et al., 2014).
Participants were recruited through the Mood and Anxiety
Disorders Program (UIC) or Anxiety Disorders Treatment Clinic
(UM) by means of flyers posted throughout the communities,
newspaper and internet advertisement. Interested participants

632 | Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 4

completed a phone screen followed by a psychiatric evaluation
during which time participants reviewed the consent form.
After attaining consent, participants met with a clinician
trained in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (‘SCID-
IV’; First et al., 1995) and clinician-administered measures. The
participant’s medical history was reviewed by a Board Certified
physician and during the evaluation, participants completed
self-report measures. Diagnosis was based on the SCID-IV and
the clinician-administered Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
(‘LSAS’; Liebowitz, 1987) was used to assess symptom severity.
The self-reported Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(Spielberger, 1983) and Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al.,
1996) were used to evaluate general anxiety and depression lev-
els, respectively. Participants were compensated $15 per hour
for their time.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

All participants were between 18 and 55 years of age, free of
major medical or neurologic illness as confirmed by a Board
Certified physician. As long as gSAD was the primary complaint,
participants with a comorbid disorder were not excluded. All
participants were free of psychotropic medications and none
were receiving concurrent psychotherapy. None of the partici-
pants tested positive for drugs.

Exclusion criteria included contraindications to magnetic
resonance imaging (e.g. pregnancy, claustrophobia, non-
removable ferrous objects), current substance abuse or depend-
ence (within 6 months of study), or any history of major
psychiatric illness (e.g. bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder,
pervasive developmental disorder).

Treatment

Within a week of the first fMRI scan, patients began once-
weekly sessions of manualized individual CBT for 12 weeks,
which comprised psycho-education, strategies to reduce neg-
ative beliefs (e.g. cognitive restructuring), in vivo exposures to
fears and relapse prevention (Hope et al., 2006). A CBT-trained
licensed clinical psychologist or post-doctoral clinical psy-
chologist conducted treatment. The clinicians were super-
vised by a licensed clinical psychologist with expertise in CBT
and
Impression-
trials. The Clinical Global
Improvement (CGI-I; Busner and Targum, 2007), comprising a
7-point scale (1 ¼ very much improved, 7 ¼ worsening symp-
toms), was used to determine whether a patient responded to
treatment and remission was defined as patients who
achieved an LSAS score of (cid:2)30 (Mennin et al., 2002; Liebowitz
et al., 2005).

clinical

fMRI task

During fMRI, participants viewed a string of six letters superim-
posed on a task-irrelevant face distractor and were asked to
identify target letters (N or X). Specifically, they were instructed
as follows: ‘For the following task we want you to look at the let-
ters on each face. Press the first button (Index Finger) if there is
an X present. Press the second button (Middle Finger) if there is
an N present. Make your decisions as quickly and accurately as
possible. Please guess if you’re not sure.’

In low perceptual load trials, the string was comprised entirely
of target letters; under high perceptual load, the string included a
single target letter and five non-target letters (H, K, M, W, Z)
arranged in randomized order. Distractor faces were from a

standardized set of photographs and consisted of fearful, angry
individuals
and neutral expressions from eight different
(Eckman and Friesen, 1976). Our paradigm was adapted from
Bishop et al. (2007) wherein task-irrelevant fearful faces were
contrasted with task-irrelevant neutral faces to examine the
effects of anxiety level on threat distractors under low and high

included angry face distractors, as anger and fear have shown
differential effects in emotion processing circuitry (Whalen
et al., 2001). The experiment involved two image acquisition
runs, each comprising 12 blocks of 5 trials. A mixed block/event-
related design was employed whereby perceptual load (low vs
high) varied across blocks and facial expression (fearful, angry,
neutral) varied within blocks on a trial-by-trial basis. Images
were presented for 200 ms followed by a fixation cross
presented for 1800 ms; responses were made via button press.

fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing

This study was conducted on two 3 Tesla GE Signa System
(General Electric; Milwaukee, WI) scanners, all using the same
standard radiofrequency coil. All scanning was performed with
blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)-sensitive whole-brain
fMRI using the same GE software (LX 8.3, Neuro-optimized gra-
dients). At the University of Michigan (n ¼ 10)
images were
acquired with a gradient-echo reverse spiral acquisition with
the following parameters: TR ¼ 2 s, TE ¼ 25 ms, flip angle ¼ 77(cid:3),
field of view ¼ 24 (cid:4) 24 cm2, acquisition matrix 64 (cid:4) 64; 30 axial,
5-mm-thick slices with no gap. At the University of Illinois at
Chicago (n ¼ 22) images were acquired using a gradient-echo
echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters:
TR ¼ 2s, TE ¼ 25 ms, flip angle ¼ 90(cid:3), field of view ¼ 22 x 22 cm2,
acquisition matrix 64 x 64; 44 axial, 3-mm-thick slices with no
gap. For anatomical localization, a high-resolution, T1-weighted
volumetric anatomical scan was acquired.

Data from all participants met criteria for quality with mini-
mal motion correction (movements were < 3 mm and < 3
degrees rotation in any one direction) and the first four volumes
from each run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration
effects. Conventional preprocessing steps were used in Statistical
Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software package (Wellcome Trust
Centre for Neuroimaging, London www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).
Briefly, images were temporally corrected to account for differen-
ces in slice time collection, spatially realigned to the first image
of the first run, normalized to a Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) template, resampled to 2 (cid:4) 2 (cid:4) 2 mm3 voxels and smoothed
with an 8-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel.

fMRI analyses

A general linear model was applied to the time series, con-
volved with the canonical hemodynamic response function and
with a 128-s high-pass filter. Nuisance regressors comprising
six motion parameters were included to correct for motion
artifacts. Blocks of low and high perceptual load were modeled
separately based on task-irrelevant face type (fearful, angry,
neutral) resulting in six regressors (fearful low, fearful high,
angry low, angry high, neutral low, neutral high), the effects of
which were estimated for each voxel for each participant and
taken to the second level for random effects analysis.

imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Adapted from Bishop et al. (2007).

To assess predictors of CBT response, contrasts of interest
from gSAD pre-treatment scans were entered into a whole-
brain analysis of covariance, regressing LSAS change (DPreTx –
PostTx) while initial severity (LSASPreTx) and scanner site were
controlled for as regressors of no interest. Consistent with prior
fMRI studies of gSAD concerning whole-brain analysis (Amir
et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2008; Gentili et al., 2009; Phan et al., 2013;
Klumpp et al., 2014), significance was set at P < 0.001 (uncor-
rected) with a cluster extent threshold at least 10 contiguous
voxels (volume (cid:5) 80 mm3). This type of joint intensity and clus-
ter size threshold is within the recommended threshold to
attain a balance between Type I and Type II errors (Lieberman
and Cunningham, 2009). Frontal region(s) implicated in cogni-
tive control that emerged from whole-brain analysis were fol-
lowed-up with PsychoPhysiological Interactions (PPI) analysis
(Friston et al., 1997) as implemented in SPM8 to evaluate regions
functionally connected with baseline activation predictive of
symptom change.

To illustrate the magnitude and direction of activation,
parameter estimates of peak activation (b weights, arbitrary
units [a.u.]) were extracted from spherical (10-mm diameter)

regions of interest from each participant and submitted to post
hoc Pearson’s correlations (2-tailed with alpha level at .05) and
scatter plots in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) (Chicago, IL version 22).

Results

Participants

Thirty-two patients with gSAD (75% female) had a mean age
of 25.4 6 5.1 years. Self-reported onset of SAD was classified
in terms childhood (31.3%), adolescence (43.8%) and adult
(15.6%) as many patients described onset (e.g.
‘since I can
remember’, ‘around High School’) as opposed to a particular
age. Data was missing for three patients; nevertheless, find-
ings are consistent with reports of an early onset in SAD (e.g.,
before 25 years; Wittchen et al., 1999). At the start of treat-
ment, patients had an average symptom severity (LSAS total
score) of 74.3 6 14.9, which is consistent with a clinical cutoff
of (cid:5)60 for gSAD (Heimberg et al., 1999; Mennin et al., 2002).
With regard to comorbidity, two patients in the University of

634 | Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 4

Michigan cohort had concurrent specific phobia and one had
generalized anxiety disorder. In the University of Illinois at
Chicago sample, nine patients had generalized anxiety disor-
der; two, panic disorder; two, major depressive disorder; four,
dysthymia; one, specific phobia; one, posttraumatic stress
disorder; and one adjustment disorder. Six patients had more
than one comorbid disorder. Despite concurrent depression
for a portion of patients, average level of depression was in
the mild range 16.7 6 10.6 (Beck et al., 1996) and state and trait
anxiety averaged 48.3 6 12.1 and 53.2 6 9.6,
respectively.
Regarding race/ethnicity, 54.5% self-identified as Caucasian,
18.3% as Asian, 22.7% as Hispanic and 4.5% as African
American.

Treatment effects on social anxiety severity

After completing all 12 weeks of CBT, gSAD symptom severity,
as assessed with LSAS, significantly decreased from an aver-
age of 74.3 6 14.9 to 47.9 6 20.4 [(31) t ¼ 7.1, P < 0.001] as did
depression level (16.7 6 10.6 to 3.5 6 3.5) [(31) t ¼ 7.0, P < 0.002].
Based on the CGI-I, 69% of the gSAD group (22 of 32 patients)
were considered to be ‘Responders’ as they were rated to be
‘very much improved’ or ‘much improved’ (CGI-I score of 1 or
2) while 10 of 32 patients had a CGI-I score of >2 post-treat-
ment and were thus considered ‘Non-Responders’. Remission
rate was lower as approximately 16% (5 of 32 patients) reached
remission based on LSAS and about 84% (27 of 32) did not
attain an LSAS score of (cid:2) 30 (Mennin et al., 2002; Liebowitz
et al., 2005).

fMRI results

Fearful (vs Neutral) Distractors: High Perceptual Load. Whole-brain
findings from regression analysis revealed greater baseline acti-
vation in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) [((cid:6)8, 22, 38),
z ¼ 3.59, k ¼ 357, volume ¼ 2856 mm3] positively corresponded to
greater reduction in symptom severity after completing CBT
(Figure 2). Follow-up correlations in SPSS illustrated a positive
relationship between activation and symptom change (r ¼ 0.56,
P < 0.001).

Additional whole-brain findings showed more symptom
improvement was linked to greater pre-CBT activity in anterior
insula, frontal inferior triangularis, inferior parietal gyrus and
precentral gyrus. The only negative association with symptom
change was observed in the paracentral lobule. See Table 2 for
all regression results.

Exploratory PPI analysis with left dACC ((cid:6)8, 22, 38) as seed
region taken from whole-brain regression analysis showed less
co-activation with bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(dlPFC) [right (30, 10, 56), z ¼ 3.65, k ¼ 31, volume ¼ 248 mm3; left
((cid:6)42, 22, 52), z ¼ 3.43, k ¼ 38, volume ¼ 304 mm3]
(Figure 3).
Follow-up correlations in SPSS illustrated a negative relation-
ship between baseline dlPFC activity and symptom change
(right r ¼ (cid:6)0.47, P < 0.007; left r ¼ (cid:6)0.62, P < 0.001). Other regions
associated with decreased dACC connectivity were precuneus,
precentral gyrus and superior frontal medial gyrus. The only
region with increased connectivity with dACC was insula. See
Table 3 for all PPI results.

Angry (vs neutral) distractors: high perceptual load. Similar to the
fearful (vs neutral) condition, greater reduction in symptom
severity after CBT was foretold by more activation in dACC [(6,
38, 24), z ¼ 3.33, k ¼ 92, volume ¼ 736 mm3] (Figure 4). However,
here the activation was part of a large insula cluster [((cid:6)32, 6, 16),
z ¼ 4.55, k ¼ 361, volume ¼ 2888 mm3)]. Follow-up analysis in
SPSS verified a positive relationship between dACC activity and
symptom change (r ¼ 0.57, P < 0.001).

Additional whole-brain findings, beyond regions of interest,
revealed greater symptom change was related to greater base-
line activity in a set of regions that included paracentral lobule,
putamen, frontal superior medial gyrus and supplementary
motor area. There was no evidence CBT outcome was predicted
by less baseline activation. See Table 2 for all regression results.

co-varied less with dACC were precentral gyrus and superior

Discussion

Patients with gSAD exhibited a significant reduction in symp-
tom severity after completing CBT and the extent of symptom
improvement (i.e. LSAS change (DPreTx (cid:6) PostTx)) was predicted by
pre-CBT dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity to
threatening (vs neutral) face distractors during high perceptual
load when processing resources were restricted. The dACC was
a region of interest given its involvement in higher-order func-
tions such as monitoring occurrence of conflict and response
selection (Devinsky et al., 1995; Bush et al., 2000; Braver et al.,
2001), which plays a role in the recruitment of mechanisms to
execute control (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Kerns et al., 2004;
Fan et al., 2007; Soutschek et al., 2013).

In addition to dACC, increased activation to distractors in a
set of cortical regions was shown to correspond with symptom
change. For both angry and fearful distractors, CBT response
was predicted by regions implicated in conflict detection (e.g.
insula, frontal superior cortex) (Braver et al., 2001; Corbetta and
Shulman, 2002) and response anticipation/selection (e.g. supple
mentary motor area, precentral gyrus) (Corbetta and Shulman,
2002; Fan et al., 2007; Soutschek et al., 2013). Also, while respon-
sivity in some structures were more unique to distractor type
(e.g. putamen and frontal superior medial gyrus for angry dis-
tractors) pre-CBT activation in a frontoparietal network largely
predicted CBT success in high perceptual load. Results suggest
neural predictors did not generally interact with differences in
type of threat distractor.

The following observations indicate gSAD patients with
greater deficiency in controlled processes were more likely to
respond to CBT. First, there was wide-spread frontopartial
responsivity during high perceptual load, as opposed to activa-
tion circumscribed to regions integral to emotional conflict res-
olution (e.g. rostral medial prefrontal cortex; Ochsner et al.,

2009; Etkin et al., 2011). In our earlier study of conflict resolution,
gSAD was associated with a compensatory response to threat
distractors under high perceptual load (Wheaton et al., 2014).
Here, more diffuse activation when attentional capacity to proc-
ess threat was constrained suggests more resources were
needed to maintain goal-directed behavior though the insula
findings suggests the activation may be due in part to emotional
reactivity.

Reactivity in this context could signify the processing of threat
distractors or the aversive nature of conflict itself (e.g. experience
when confronted with discrepancy between response tendencies;
Inzlicht et al., 2015). For example, pre-CBT anterior insula activa-
tion, particularly for angry face distractors was robust under
high, but not low, perceptual load. Anterior insula and dACC are
core structures of the salience network (Seeley et al., 2007; Menon
and Uddin, 2010), thus, if activity connoted detection of bottom-
up, threat-relevant signals, insula effects in the low load condi-
tion would be expected as well. In other words, the cognitive goal
during low load was easier to carry out than in the high load con-
dition, as confirmed by behavioral data (i.e. greater accuracy and
shorter response time in low relative to high load). Consequently,
more resources were ‘left over’ to process threat distractors under
low perceptual load. Lack of insula results in the low load condi-
tion along with greater task difficulty in high load suggests reac-
tivity to conflict is implicated in insula effects during high
perceptual load.

Second, results from exploratory psychophysiological inter-
actions (PPI) analysis point to a relationship between deficiency
in controlled processes and CBT response. Using dACC as the
seed region from whole-brain regression analysis, we observed
reduced bilateral functional connectivity with dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex (dlPFC) to angry and fearful face distractors.
Interestingly, in a study of trait anxiety, greater anxiety level
was also shown to correlate with less dACC-dlPFC connectivity
during emotional conflict (Comte et al., 2015) suggesting reduced
cross-talk between these regions may function as a predictor in
other anxiety disorders.

The dlPFC is part of a cognitive control network which is
recruited, and functionally connected with dACC, when streams
of information compete for processing resources (Ochsner et al.,

638 | Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 2016, Vol. 11, No. 4

2009; Cieslik et al., 2013). Its connections with prefrontal cortex
(Barbas and Pandya, 1989; Miller and Cohen, 2001), medial fron-
tal lobe (Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993; Lu et al., 1994; Petrides
and Pandya, 1999) and parietal lobes (Petrides and Pandya, 1984;
Cavada and Goldman-Rakic, 1989; Andersen et al., 1990) position
the dlPFC well as a sensory-behavioral integration area to exert
optimal control to override prepotent response tendencies and
efficiently shift between different task sets (Miller and Cohen,
2001; Hoshi, 2006; Mansouri et al., 2009). In light of dlPFC
involvement in higher-order control and evidence symptom
improvement was predicted by reduced dlPFC-dACC coupling,
patients with less control capability in the context of high per-
ceptual load were more likely to benefit from CBT.

With regard to inverse relationships between symptom
change and pre-CBT neural response during conflict resolution,
lobule was observed. Specifically, greater
only paracentral
reduction in symptom severity was predicted by less paracen-
tral activity to fearful face distractors during high load. It is
somewhat surprising results were largely limited to the high
perceptual load condition. The only neural predictor to emerge
load was supramarginal gyrus with
during low perceptual
increased activation to angry face distractors foretelling better
CBT outcome. Even though these regions are involved in control
functions (e.g. target detection, conflict functions) (Corbetta and
Shulman, 2002; Fan et al., 2007), overall findings indicate the
high load condition was more sensitive at detecting brain-based
predictors in CBT response.

Beyond dlPFC, PPI results for dACC under high perceptual
load for both fearful (vs neutral) and angry (vs neutral) distrac-
tors were reduced functional connectivity with precentral
gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, regions associated with con-
flict resolution (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Ochsner et al.,
2009). Unique to fearful face distractors was increased dACC-
insula coupling indicating cognitive control was modulated by
salience of distractor. Additionally, precuneus which is also
implicated in cognitive control (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002;
Ochsner et al., 2009) co-varied less with dACC in the face of
fear distractors. Together, PPI findings point to reduced func-
tional connectivity to dACC in regions associated with con-
trolled processes.

In conclusion, the present study indicates better CBT out-
come in gSAD is associated with initial deficiency, or ineffi-
ciency, during emotional conflict resolution when demands on
control are high. CBT techniques such as cognitive restructur-
ing, aimed at altering maladaptive thoughts (e.g. disputation of
negative beliefs, generation of alternative responses), are
expected to draw on executive functions. Therefore, patients
with greater disruption in regions involved in higher-order proc-
esses may be helped more by explicit exercises directed at
recruiting prefrontal regions.

from the different scanners may have contributed to an
increased risk of false negatives. Fourth, lack of independent
evaluators for outcome measures, that is, CGI-I across institu-
tions and clinician-administered Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
at the University of Michigan warrants replication and further
investigation as we cannot rule out that findings may have
been inadvertently influenced by the therapist. Fifth, findings
are based at the group, as opposed to single-subject, level of
analysis thus reducing the clinical utility of using baseline fMRI
data to predict which patient will likely respond to CBT. Sixth,
results are based on a paradigm designed to probe automatic
(low perceptual load) and inhibitory (high perceptual load) proc-
esses thereby invoking mechanisms beyond cognitive control;
therefore, inferences cannot be limited to controlled processes
and may not generalize to other indices of control (e.g. Stroop
task, explicit emotion regulation). Lastly, neural response pre-
dictive of CBT outcome may not be impacted by treatment;
future studies should examine brain-based markers of response
in the context of post-CBT scans.

Notwithstanding limitations, this is the first study we are
aware of that examined brain-based markers of CBT response
in gSAD to emotional conflict resolution under low and high
perceptual load. Findings are inconsistent with previous gSAD
studies that predominately focused on neural predictors based
on emotion perception, which indicated greater regulatory abil-
ity was capitalized on by CBT. Assuming the functional archi-
tecture prior to CBT plays a role in CBT effects, mixed results
may reflect type of circuitry impinged on by a component of
treatment. Core CBT modules include in vivo exposures to fears
and strategies directed at reducing maladaptive thoughts (e.g.
cognitive restructuring). Consequently, some paradigms may be
more suitable at predicting CBT response insofar as type of
module is concerned. For example, when attending to social
fears, patients with less limbic reactivity and superior regula-
tory ability may especially benefit from exposures by aptly
managing surges in anxiety. Alternatively, those with poor reg-
ulatory capability when higher-order functions are targeted
may be helped more by exercises that directly challenge nega-
tive beliefs. It will be important for future investigations to
examine neural predictors of CBT success in the context of
threat processing and type of emotional regulation (e.g. implicit
vs explicit) to better understand whether certain patients bene-
fit from particular CBT elements or its combination.

Limitations

Conflict of interest. None declared.

The study is not without important limitations. First, there was
no wait-list control group, therefore, neural and clinical findings
cannot be causally attributed to CBT and could be related to a
number of factors not related to treatment such as natural
course of the illness over the 12-week period and differential
regression to the mean in patients. Second, the small sample
size may have increased the risk for false negatives and the
sample is only partially representative of typical patients with
SAD as none were taking a psychotropic medication. Third, the
fMRI studies occurred in two different sites, therefore, unknown
and un-estimated variance in imaging data not accounted for
