Abstract

The success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating Parkinson’s disease has led to its 
application to several other disorders, including treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Results 
with DBS for TRD have been heterogeneous, with inconsistencies largely driven by incomplete 
understanding of the brain networks regulating mood, especially on an individual basis. We report 
results from the first subject treated with DBS for TRD using an approach that incorporates 
intracranial recordings to personalize understanding of network behavior and its response to 
stimulation. These recordings enabled calculation of individually optimized DBS stimulation 
parameters using a novel “inverse solution” approach. In the ensuing double-blind randomized 
phase incorporating these bespoke parameter sets, DBS led to remission of symptoms and

Introduction

The success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating movement disorders such as 
Parkinson’s disease (1) has led to interest in its application to several psychiatric disorders 
including treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Previous open-label studies of DBS for 
TRD have demonstrated encouraging results (2–5), but two recent pivotal trials were aborted 
after interim analyses raised concern for futility (6, 7). These varied results underscore the 
great challenge and critical need for a strategy to individualize delivery of this therapy for a 
disorder as heterogeneous as depression (8).

We devised a novel personalized medicine platform for DBS therapy development (9) and 
designed a clinical trial of DBS for TRD focused on this essential aspect: the need to 
achieve an individualized understanding of the specific brain networks contributing to a 
patient’s particular depressive phenotype and their response to stimulation. To do so, we 
borrowed the well-established approach of using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) 
to individualize the understanding of epileptic networks (10). Although routinely used in 
epilepsy, the intracranial EEG platform has rarely been used for other disorders (11, 12). We 
adapted this platform to serve as a tool for individualized network analysis in TRD, with the 
hypothesis that doing so would enable personalized delivery of DBS therapy to symptomatic 
networks and thereby increase the likelihood of clinical success.

Our trial utilizes stereo-EEG (sEEG), a percutaneous method for placing recording 
electrodes within the brain and interpreting network-wide activity (13). For the first time, 
we couple this sEEG approach with simultaneous therapeutic DBS lead implantation, thus 
permitting both recording and stimulation. The implant strategy is individually tailored 
to the putative networks relevant to TRD based on patient-specific measures of structural 
connectivity. To fully investigate the distinct contributions of these networks, we targeted 
the DBS leads to two previously studied regions, the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) (2, 3) 
and the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) (4, 5). These DBS targets are thought 
to be hubs at the crossroads of critical white matter pathways that connect cortical and 
subcortical network regions relevant to the expression of depressive symptoms. The targets 
seem to have qualitative differences, with SCC stimulation more often reducing negative 
feelings (e.g., anhedonia, helplessness) and VC/VS stimulation increasing positive feelings 
(e.g., motivation, energy) (4, 14). Recent evidence correspondingly suggests that the brain 
networks associated with these two targets overlap but have distinct components (15–17).

We use this dual-target strategy to maximize accessibility to as much of the relevant 
TRD network as possible. We then use the intracranial sEEG recordings to narrow the

possible stimulation parameter space and choose those parameters that engage network 
sub-regions most effectively for the individual subject. Thus, this strategy initially casts a 
wide net and then uses the uniquely available electrophysiological data to focus stimulation 
delivery using bespoke parameter sets. This “sEEG-informed DBS” platform enables 
therapeutic development with an emphasis on individualized understanding of network 
(patho-)physiology. Here, we present results from the first patient treated with this approach 
in this FDA-approved (IDE G180300) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03437928). 
The subject is a 37-year-old Hispanic male with a history of severe treatment-resistant 
Major Depressive Disorder who met inclusion criteria of severity, chronicity, and treatment-
refractoriness and provided informed consent (BCM IRB H-43036) (Supplementary 
Information).

Methods

Network-Minded Implant Surgery

The initial surgery consisted of intracranially implanting 4 DBS leads (bilateral SCC 
and VC/VS) and 10 sEEG electrodes (Supplementary Information). To allow mapping of 
relevant brain networks and connections, target locations for both sEEG electrodes and 
DBS leads were determined based on high-resolution structural connectivity imaging. DBS 
leads were positioned to span the region of SCC and VC/VS with the joint maximal 
probability of connectivity with white matter tracts critically associated with each respective 
target, as we have previously described (18) (Supplementary Information). The DBS leads 
were externalized (19) to provide access for stimulation delivery. sEEG electrodes targeted 
downstream depression-relevant frontotemporal network regions: bilateral dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vlPFC, vmPFC), 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and mesial temporal lobe 
(MTL) (20, 21).

For the first time, our study supplemented traditional stereotactic planning tools with 
a holographic augmented reality platform that enabled interactive visualization of the 
DBS and sEEG targets and white matter tracts connecting them. This “HoloSEEG” 
platform created a collaborative planning environment and provided a more complete three-
dimensional appreciation of the extended networks that were targeted with this approach 
(Fig. 1).

Neurophysiological Data-Driven Stimulation

Following the initial surgery, the patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit, which 
we conceptually renamed the neurophysiology monitoring unit (NMU). We performed 9 
days of continuous high-resolution recordings from the 180 intracranial channels during 
unconstrained behavior, performance of specific behavioral tasks designed to assess affect 
and cognition, and delivery of stimulation across a wide parameter space (Supplementary 
Information). At the conclusion of the NMU period, we performed a second surgery to 
remove the sEEG electrodes and internalize the DBS leads to implanted pulse generators.

The critical goal of the NMU phase was to gather data to enable generation of personalized 
stimulation parameter sets to implement and evaluate during chronic outpatient DBS. 
The traditional method of choosing optimal parameters–trial-and-error exploration of the 
stimulation parameter space – would be infeasible for several reasons. The first is the 
sheer size of the parameter space. Conventional two-lead monopolar DBS with 4-contact 
leads allows 28 possible contact configurations. Factoring in multiple possible stimulation 
frequencies, pulse widths, and amplitudes, the possible combinations number in the 
thousands. Dimensionality of the parameter space in this case is exponentially larger: 
because we use four rather than two DBS leads, and because each segmented DBS lead 
has eight rather than four contacts, there are 232 (>4 billion) possible contact configurations 
alone. Another reason is the mismatch in temporal dynamics between DBS parameter 
adjustments and observable changes. In DBS for movement disorders, DBS adjustments 
often have immediately measurable effects (e.g., tremor suppression). In psychiatric DBS, 
however, the time delay and consistency between adjustments and observable effects 
are unpredictable. Thus brute force exploration of this high-dimensional parameter space 
would be extremely time-consuming and may only lead to the identification of somewhat 
effective parameters (local maximum) but perhaps not the most effective parameters (global 
maximum).

This trial replaces the effort-intensive, trial-and-error conventional method (Fig. 2A 
“Forward” solution) with a data-driven, rigorous approach utilizing the critical feature 
unique to this platform: the intracranial recordings. These recordings provide measures 
of network activity across a range of mood states occurring through natural variation or 
induced by specific behavioral tasks. They also provide measures of the network’s response 
to stimulation across the vast parameter space, which can be efficiently explored with this 
platform. Combining this information, we can calculate an “Inverse” solution (Fig. 2A): 
the set of computed stimulation parameters determined most likely to produce the desired 
behavioral outcome.

In this case, we calculated the inverse solution by defining a desired brain state and 
identifying the stimulation parameter set that produced a network-wide electrographic 
pattern that most closely matched it (Supplementary Information). We created correlation 
matrices between this desired brain state and the multiple stimulation parameter 
combinations tested per DBS lead, where each matrix correlated spectral power across 
all intracranial contacts. This process produced a rank-ordered list of parameter sets across 
the four DBS leads. Then, to determine the relative contributions of stimulation parameter 
features to the correlation match value, we modeled each component as a beta weight in a 
generalized linear model and used iterative model fitting to identify the most-contributing 
components.

Outpatient Phase

We implemented the NMU-derived stimulation parameters in the outpatient phase of the 
trial. We began with an 8-month period of open label optimization, in which we observed 
the effects of the chosen stimulation parameters without blinding. The subject then entered 
the double-blind discontinuation phase. We saw the patient in clinic weekly during this

time for close monitoring. At a timepoint unknown to the subject and blinded raters, we 
began reducing stimulation by 25% per visit on a randomly chosen DBS target pair. A 25% 
increase in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) over 2 consecutive 
visits, relative to pre-discontinuation, and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement 
scale (CGI-I) of 6 (“much worse”) were escape criteria that would trigger exit from the 
discontinuation phase and reinstatement of open label stimulation. Subject blinding was 
maintained by asking the subject to not access the patient programmer and to recharge the 
DBS pulse generator daily so that they would be unaware of differences in recharge duration 
that would tip off amount of battery usage.

Results

Inverse Solution for DBS Parameter Generation

We delivered stimulation across a wide range of parameter space, including single pulses 
and pulse trains of 1 sec, 15 sec, 5 minute, and 20 minute duration (Supplementary 
Information). The 1-second stimulation data were used for inverse solution generation. 
These short stimulation trains did not produce an observable behavioral response, but 15 
second stimulation and longer did. In general, SCC stimulation effects, when present, 
consisted of feelings of calmness and mental clarity. VC/VS effect, when present, were 
more energizing, consisting of increased talkativeness and feeling “online”. His symptom 
scores decreased rapidly during the 10 day NMU stay, decreasing by 56% (MADRS) to 67% 
(HAM-D) relative to his baseline severity (Figure S1).

We performed the inverse analysis in three ways to identify and confirm a solution. We first 
chose the subject’s baseline resting activity on day 9 of the NMU stay as the desired state. 
His symptom ratings were most improved at this point, and his performance on behavioral 
tasks was at its best (Supplementary Information). Subjectively, he stated that if he were 
able to consistently feel this way, he would function much better in life, emotionally and 
cognitively. Whether he had reached this state due to the accumulated stimulation delivery 
by that time or due to other non-stimulation-specific effects, it represented a desirable state. 
From the rank-ordered list generated by the inverse analysis targeting this state, we chose the 
top-ranked set as our prioritized set of stimulation parameters. This modeling approach does 
not allow us to quantify the significance of the difference between items in the list, however, 
so we are agnostic regarding the potential effect of choosing any other high-ranking set.

We performed two additional analyses to add confidence to this choice. First, we chose 
an alternate desired state: activity during one of the behavioral tasks that induced a 
positive mood state. This choice provided an objectively defined target state to balance 
the subjectivity of the original choice. The highest ranked match using this alternative was 
identical in all but one stimulation parameter to the original set. Second, we followed the 
same steps to match to an undesired brain state, which we chose as the baseline recording 
on day 2 in the NMU when his depression severity was still elevated (Supplementary 
Information). This rank-ordered list was in nearly the exact inverse order of the other two, 
providing further confirmation of the result.

Evaluation of the beta weights in the general linear model provided further information 
regarding the stimulation parameters that most influenced the match score. Contact 
configuration – the combination of DBS contacts through which stimulation was delivered 
– was consistently the most significant contributor. The second most significant contributor 
was stimulation frequency. Pulse width and amplitude were consistently least significant.

Clinical Outcome

We implemented the NMU-defined stimulation parameter sets during an initial eight-month 
period of open-label DBS. Of note, this sEEG-informed strategy changed the workflow for 
clinical programming visits. Because the stimulation sets were generated based on NMU 
data, little clinic time was spent exploring the parameter space to build stimulation sets for 
this complex 4-lead configuration.

During this time, the participant reported steady improvements in mood, increased interest 
in pleasurable activities, and closer emotional connections to loved ones. Professionally, 
he noticed increased concentration and improved performance at work, and decreased 
anxiety when making presentations to colleagues and clients. His partner reported increased 
talkativeness, emotional engagement, and interest in shared activities. Standard rating 
scales demonstrated progressive improvement in depression severity leading to remission 
of symptoms by week 22 relative to the initial surgery, or approximately 18 weeks 
following initiation of chronic DBS (Fig. 2B). He did not report treatment-emergent adverse 
events such as anxiety, hypomania, or suicidal ideation. Neuropsychological testing at the 
end of open-label optimization revealed improvement in semantic fluency, abstract visual 
reasoning, and long and short delay recall of non-contextual verbal material. Whether 
these cognitive improvements were a direct result of stimulation or secondary to mood 
improvements is difficult to determine.

At 37 weeks he entered the double-blind, randomized discontinuation phase of the trial to 
distinguish between true and sham response. He was randomized to SCC discontinuation 
first. Stimulation amplitude was reduced by 25% per visit beginning on the 3rd visit in 
double-blind fashion. The stability of his scores during this lead-in period (lack of nocebo 
effect) argues against unblinding. During the discontinuation, he reported steadily worsening 
mood and anxiety. His symptom scores increased during this period until he met rescue 
criteria. At this point, stimulation was reinstated at pre-discontinuation levels, and his 
depression symptoms again quickly remitted. He did not undergo discontinuation of the 
VC/VS target, as our protocol limits the discontinuation phase to a single target for patient 
safety.

Discussion

We present a novel platform for DBS therapy development and the first case of 
clinically effective “sEEG-informed DBS” for TRD. Our novel dual-target DBS strategy 
increased our access to a wider brain network than achievable by a single target. 
The intracranial monitoring platform of the NMU allowed first-of-its-kind rigorous 
electrophysiological characterization of depression-relevant networks and their response to 
a wide range of stimulation parameters. This approach enabled data-driven determination

of optimal stimulation parameters to engage the symptomatic network. The double-blind 
discontinuation results suggest that the observed robust response, which led to symptom 
remission, was a true stimulation-induced response and not a sham/placebo response.

Beyond the utilitarian purpose of enabling calculation of optimal DBS parameters, these 
results shed light on the relative influence of the various stimulation parameters on network 
activity. We consistently observed contact configuration as the most significant feature. 
These results argue for the value of using directionally steerable DBS leads, which allow 
finer grained control over the pattern of evoked neural activity (Supplementary Information). 
Stimulation frequency was consistently the next most significant feature. Of note, whereas 
the effect of contact configuration may be estimated using imaging methods (e.g., Fig. 1), 
the effect of stimulation frequency cannot. Pulse width and amplitude were consistently the 
least significant features in our model. Their lower significance does not mean that these 
parameters are unimportant, but rather that they have the least influence on the pattern of 
evoked activity and therefore the match to the target network state.

This report is the first to combine VC/VS and SCC DBS for TRD. When tested individually 
in the NMU, SCC and VC/VS stimulation produced behavioral effects as described in 
previous reports: SCC stimulation reduced “mental noise” and produced calmness and 
attention; VC/VS stimulation injected energy and motivation (5, 7, 14, 16, 22). A possible 
concern is that an inappropriate combination of these diverging effects could be antagonistic, 
but our results suggest otherwise. Before exiting the discontinuation phase, the subject’s 
symptom scores were approximately halfway back to his pre-surgical baseline. We cannot 
speculate how he would have fared for a longer time without SCC stimulation, but it is likely 
that stimulation in the two targets was constructive. Further experience with dual-target 
stimulation will shed light on this balance.

We envision this platform as one for DBS therapy development and optimization for 
challenging disorders during a critical period of knowledge acquisition, not as a replacement 
for standard DBS surgery. The goal of this trial is to determine whether an sEEG-based 
approach is feasible and whether the information obtained from the sEEG recordings 
can be used to select effective DBS stimulation parameters. In this first subject, we 
demonstrate initial feasibility and utility of the platform. Importantly, we did not try to prove 
that the sEEG-informed DBS parameters were better than parameters derived from other/
conventional methods. Such a test would require well-designed head-to-head comparisons, 
which may be done in the future should interest in this platform increase.

One possible future implementation of this sEEG platform may be for patients who do 
not respond to conventional DBS (for TRD or other disorders). Those who respond to 
conventional methods would have done so without intracranial recordings, but those who 
do not respond could undergo this process to gain the network-wide electrophysiological 
data that would permit derivation of new solutions and hopefully improve their outcome. 
Future work will also undoubtedly improve the inverse solution methodology. The specific 
computational form used to generate the inverse solution here is just the first example. 
Increasingly sophisticated techniques for decoding mood states from electrophysiological 
measurements and using intracranial stimulation to modulate them are the subject of active

investigation (23–25). Implementation of these methods will likely improve our ability to 
find optimal solutions.

The increased invasiveness of this platform over conventional DBS is meant to be a bridge 
to future less invasive approaches. This successful case is a necessary first demonstration of 
this novel strategy using direct intracranial measurements. Future work can test the success 
of substituting non-invasive techniques as readouts of neural activity (Fig. 2A, part 4) as they 
become increasingly reliable. More generally, an important advantage of this platform is that 
stimulation configurations derived from future analyses can be readily implemented as new 
sets of stimulation parameters to employ and test. This approach enables repeated iteration 
between computational analysis and clinical testing, providing a long-term testbed for the 
neuroscientist and continued hope for symptomatic relief for the patient.

In summary, our initial results demonstrate the feasibility of this novel platform for 
personalized DBS. We propose that this approach, if consistently demonstrated safe and 
effective, can be used to develop and improve surgical neuromodulation for a vast array of 
neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Figure 1. Network-guided implant planning.
A) Interactive trajectory planning for 4 DBS leads and 10 sEEG electrodes using structural 
connectivity hypotheses to guide the electrode positions. This process was performed using 
holographic augmented reality facilitated by custom software (HoloSEEG). B) VC/VS and 
SCC DBS leads target regions defined by patient-specific tractography (Supplementary 
Information). For clarity, we only show the left VC/VS and right SCC target regions. C, D) 
We used axonal pathway activation estimates of stimulation through the DBS leads (white 
arrowheads) to guide placement of the sEEG electrodes. Streamlines from VC/VS (C) and 
SCC (D) connect to distinct but partially overlapping frontotemporal regions. For sEEG 
trajectory planning, dorsal and lateral cortical termination regions of streamline estimates 
(e.g., dlPFC, vlPFC) were chosen as sEEG entry points. Ventral, medial, and orbital 
streamline termination regions (e.g., dACC, vmPFC, OFC) were chosen as sEEG target 
points. We thus tried to maximize sampling of relevant cortical areas while minimizing 
the number of sEEG electrodes. E,F) Frontal view and mesial view(26) showing actual 
implant locations in this subject. Stereo-EEG recording contacts (white) sample regions 
within depression-relevant frontotemporal networks, including dlPFC and dmPFC (blue), 
dACC (green), vmPFC (yellow), OFC (pink), and MTL (red). DBS lead contacts are also 
shown in pink (SCC) and orange (VC/VS).

Figure 2. “Inverse” DBS programming strategy and clinical outcome.
A) The NMU recordings uniquely enable us to generate data-driven “Inverse” solutions 
for DBS programming. Selection of programming parameters in conventional DBS 
progresses in the “Forward” (upper arrow) direction: 1) Using a trial-and-error strategy, 
the clinician chooses different combinations of input stimulation parameters, including 
contact configuration, frequency, pulse width, and amplitude. 2) These parameters produce 
unknown changes in the brain, which in turn lead to (3) measurable behaviors (e.g., 
mood changes in the case of DBS for TRD). As described in the text, optimizing this 
Forward solution is challenging even in conventional DBS for TRD because of the 
mismatch in time constants and inconsistencies between programming adjustments and 
behavioral changes. Exploring the vast possible stimulation parameter space using this brute 
force approach is extremely time consuming and inefficient. Our trial uses NMU-derived 
intracranial recordings to pioneer the “Inverse solution” (lower arrow). The recordings allow 
us to measure and define various “network states”, electrographic patterns characterizing 
various mood states, and the network’s response to stimulation (4). Armed with this 
information, we can select a desired behavioral outcome (3), identify its associated network 
state (4), and then compute the combination of stimulation parameters (1) that are most 
likely to achieve it. This approach will become progressively more effective with future 
improvements in our understanding of brain-behavior relationships – in particular, the neural 
encoding of mood states. It is also readily translatable to a non-invasive future, as less 
invasive methods of network state measurement improve and can be substituted in (4). 
B) We tested the stimulation parameters derived from the NMU (yellow bar) during the 
outpatient open-label optimization phase (pink). Depression scores decreased steadily to 
remission (HAM-D<=7, blue dashed line; MADRS<10, orange dashed line). At week 37 the 
subject initiated the double-blind, randomized discontinuation phase. He was randomized 
to SCC discontinuation first. Stimulation amplitude was reduced from 100% to 0% in 25% 
increments per week (corresponding to shades of dark to light blue). Only the unblinded 
programmer knew the stimulation amplitude; the subject and remainder of the research 
team, including symptom rater, were blinded. For the first three weeks when stimulation 
was maintained at 100% (dark blue), the subject’s scores did not appreciably change, 
indicating lack of a nocebo effect that would have confounded interpretation. As amplitude 
was reduced over subsequent weeks his scores worsened, suggesting that his response to

DBS was a true response, not a sham/placebo response. He met rescue criteria at week 
44 (MADRS >25% increase and CGI-I [values shown along x-axis] of 6 [‘much worse’] 
relative to pre-discontinuation). At this point the discontinuation phase ended and unblinded 
stimulation resumed. VC/VS stimulation was not tapered, as dictated by our study protocol, 
to reduce risk to the subject (see Supplement). He again quickly remitted following DBS 
reinstatement. Abbreviations: HAM-A, Hamilton Anxiety Inventory (magenta); MADRS,
