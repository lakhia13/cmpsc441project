Abstract

Background: Although Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychosocial treatment for borderline
personality disorder (BPD), the demand for it exceeds available resources. The commonly researched 12-month version of
DBT is lengthy; this can pose a barrier to its adoption in many health care settings. Further, there are no data on the
optimal length of psychotherapy for BPD. The aim of this study is to examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 6
versus 12 months of DBT for chronically suicidal individuals with BPD. A second aim of this study is to determine which
patients are as likely to benefit from shorter treatment as from longer treatment.
Methods/Design: Powered for non-inferiority testing, this two-site single-blind trial involves the random assignment of
240 patients diagnosed with BPD to 6 or 12 months of standard DBT. The primary outcome is the frequency of suicidal
or non-suicidal self-injurious episodes. Secondary outcomes include healthcare utilization, psychiatric and emotional
symptoms, general and social functioning, and health status. Cost-effectiveness outcomes will include the cost of
providing each treatment as well as health care and societal costs (e.g., missed work days and lost productivity).
Assessments are scheduled at pretreatment and at 3-month intervals until 24 months.
Discussion: This is the first study to directly examine the dose-effect of psychotherapy for chronically suicidal individuals
diagnosed with BPD. Examining both clinical and cost effectiveness in 6 versus 12 months of DBT will produce answers
to the question of how much treatment is good enough. Information from this study will help to guide decisions about
the allocation of scarce treatment resources and recommendations about the benefits of briefer treatment.

Background
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious and
debilitating psychiatric condition affecting 1 to 6% of the
population [1, 2]. Of particular concern, BPD is associ-
ated with exceedingly high rates (80%) of self-injury [3]
and suicide-related mortality (9–33%) [4, 5] comprising
28–47% of all mortalities by suicide [6–8]. Notably, indi-
viduals with BPD are overrepresented in primary care
[9] and mental health care settings [10, 11]. As such,
BPD is a serious health concern that heavily taxes the
mental health system [12–14]. Furthermore, individuals
with BPD frequently have difficulties with social and oc-
and disproportionately
cupational
functioning [15],
utilize social assistance [16]. Together,
these factors
make BPD a particularly costly disorder to treat [17–19].
Among the psychosocial treatments showing efficacy
for BPD [20–23], dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), a
comprehensive cognitive behavioural treatment, has ac-
crued the most empirical support [24]. DBT involves
weekly hour-long individual therapy, weekly group skills
training (typically 2–2.5 h), between-session telephone
consultation as needed to coach the patient in the use of
behavioural skills (typically by phone or other communi-
cation media), and weekly therapist consultation team
meetings designed to support, motivate, and enhance the
skills of therapists [25]. Several randomized controlled
trials have evaluated a standard 12-month version of
DBT. Results support the effectiveness of DBT relative to
treatment as usual for reducing self-injurious behaviours
and treatment dropout among BPD patients [26–28]. As
well, one trial demonstrated the superiority of DBT to
non-behavioural treatment by experts in terms of redu-
cing self-injurious behaviours, treatment dropouts, and
hospitalizations among suicidal patients with BPD [29]. In
addition, DBT has shown comparable efficacy to other
structured BPD-specific treatments
[21, 30]. Recent
meta-analyses demonstrate that DBT is associated with
medium to large effects in terms of improvements in
self-injurious behaviours [31, 32], anger, and overall men-
tal health [31]. Standard DBT is lengthy and resource in-
tensive [33] but it is associated with reduced overall cost
burden associated with BPD [34–36]. Due to its robust
support, international guidelines for effective psychosocial
treatment have identified DBT as a treatment for BPD that
has accumulated the most evidence, particularly for indi-
viduals with self-injurious behaviours [37, 38].

Although DBT is effective [31, 32], and cost-effective
[34, 36], the treatment remains lengthy (often 12 months
or longer) and comprehensive, requiring substantial re-
sources to implement. Public health care systems often
lack the resources to develop and sustain DBT programs
[39, 40]; thus, the vast majority of individuals with BPD
are left without access to evidence-based treatments. Fur-
thermore, private insurance often does not fully cover

comprehensive DBT [41]. Accordingly, many treatment
centres implement idiosyncratic, truncated versions of
standard DBT [42–44] that do not have the empirical
support of standard 1-year DBT [45]. The potential
cost-effectiveness and ease of delivery for brief DBT
(defined here as 6-months) would allow effective
treatment to reach larger numbers of patients. Conse-
quently, clinicians and researchers have identified the
need for brief, effective treatments for BPD as an ur-
gent health priority [43].

Despite the dearth of research on the optimal dur-
ation of specialized treatments for BPD such as DBT,
there is some evidence indicating that brief forms of
DBT are effective. Only one randomized controlled
trial (RCT) to date has examined 6-months of stand-
ard DBT [33], focusing on female veterans with BPD.
Compared with 6-months of treatment as usual, pa-
tients who received 6-months of DBT exhibited
greater improvements in suicidal
ideation, hopeless-
ness, depression, and anger expression [33]. This
study, however, was relatively small (n = 10 per arm)
and did not compare 6-months of DBT with a longer
course of DBT. More recently, findings from a larger
(n = 45 per arm) non-randomized trial suggested that
6-months of DBT for adults with BPD yielded im-
provements
department
visits, hospitalizations, depression, anxiety, and overall
functioning, relative to a treatment as usual wait list
condition [36]. Similarly, a small (n = 20) uncontrolled
study examined a 6-month version of standard DBT
for suicidal patients with BPD, and found excellent

suggest

Despite the urgent need to identify whether briefer
versions of DBT are clinically and cost effective for
individuals diagnosed with BPD, research in this area
is limited. First, extant studies of brief DBT have
been small and underpowered. Second,
there is a
dearth of RCTs, making it hard to draw conclusions
about
the findings. Third, no studies have directly
compared briefer forms of DBT with the most com-
monly used duration in the literature (12 months). Fi-
nally, the health economic impact of 6-months of DBT
has not been evaluated. Although the direct costs of
implementing 6-months of DBT will inevitably be lower
compared with 12-months, the long-term costs or savings

Further, given the considerable heterogeneity among
the symptoms, characteristics, and presenting problems

inevitable. Mean effect sizes for each group will likely
over- or underestimate the response to treatment for
some patients [47], and the identification of predictors
of treatment response is critical to informing the effect-
iveness and efficiency of therapies [48]. Therefore, it is
important to examine which patients do achieve super-
ior benefits from 6-months versus 12-months of DBT.

disorders

Few studies have examined predictors of treatment
outcomes for BPD patients. Although the treatments
in these studies did not include standard DBT and in-
volved acute (5-day [43]) or brief (≤5-month) adjunct-
ive treatments [49–51], several patient characteristics
were associated with outcome. For
instance, high
levels of clinical severity predicted greater improve-
ment in BPD symptoms [49] and high levels of im-
pulsivity and self-harm frequency [43, 50] predicted
greater improvements in self-harm although it’s unclear
whether these findings may be due to a regression to the
mean. Additionally, co-occurring generalized anxiety dis-
order (GAD) predicted less improvement in self-harm and
other self-destructive behaviours [50], and cluster A per-
sonality
in
self-destructive behaviours [50] and depression [51]. Fur-
thermore, co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and cluster C personality disorders predicted less
improvement of emotion dysregulation and quality of life
[50]. Taken together with the promising findings for
6-month versions of DBT in the treatment of BPD
patients with high rates self-harm and impulsive be-
haviours, these data suggest that some BPD patients
may not achieve sufficient benefits from brief treat-
ments. Predictors of poorer response to brief DBT
may include the presence of co-occurring PTSD,
GAD, and cluster A or C personality disorders. Clari-
fying how different lengths of DBT work for subsets
of patients with BPD will have a major impact on
how healthcare resources may be allocated and pa-
tients triaged.

In sum, though DBT is the most empirically-supported
psychosocial treatment for BPD, the 12-month version of
DBT studied most often in clinical trials requires substan-
tial resources. Currently, the optimal “dose” of treatment
is unknown. The present study will fill an important
gap in this research, by (1) comparing the benefits
of 6-months versus 12-months of DBT in a rigorous
RCT for BPD patients with chronic self-injury, (2)
examining
versus
12-months of DBT, and (3) identifying patient char-
acteristics
that differentiate which individuals do
and do not benefit from 6-months of DBT. With a
focus on high risk individuals with BPD, such re-
search will answer the question of whether and for
whom 6-months of DBT is clinically indicated and/
or economically attractive.

Methods/design
Study aims and hypotheses
Aim 1
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of DBT-6 compared
to DBT-12 for the treatment of chronically self-harming
individuals with BPD. The following main hypotheses
will be examined:

Hypothesis 1a: Patients in the DBT-6 arm will show
equivalent reductions in the frequency and severity of
self-harm across the treatment phase compared with pa-
tients in the DBT-12 arm. Hypothesis 1b: Patients in
the DBT-6 arm will show equivalent reductions in the
frequency and severity of self-harm across a 1-year post
treatment follow-up phase, compared with patients in
the DBT-12 arm.

Aim 2
To identify which subtypes of BPD patients are as likely
to benefit from DBT-6 versus DBT-12.

Hypothesis 2a: Patients who present with high rates
of self-harm and impulsive behaviours will have reduc-
tions in the frequency and severity of self-harm behav-
iours that are comparable in the DBT-6 arm and the
DBT-12 arm, over the course of both the treatment
phase and the 1-year post treatment follow-up.

Hypothesis 2b: Patients with co-occurring post-traumatic
stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or cluster A or
C personality disorders will exhibit lesser reductions in the
frequency and severity of self-harm behaviours in the
DBT-6 arm compared to the DBT-12 arm, over the course
of both the treatment phase and the 1-year post treatment
follow-up. In other words, a subtype by duration interaction
is expected.

Study design
This is a two-site, single-blind, two-arm randomized
controlled trial. To date, study enrollment is complete.
Two-hundred and forty participants were randomly
assigned to receive either 12-months of DBT (DBT-12)
or 6-months of DBT (DBT-6). Follow-up assessments
are occurring every 3 months, with the final assessment
occurring at 24-months.

Study setting and recruitment
The study is being conducted at two sites, the BPD
Clinic at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health
(CAMH) in Toronto, Ontario, and the Personality and
Emotion Research Laboratory in conjunction with the
DBT Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia. Of the 240
participants, 160 were enrolled in Toronto and another
80 participants were enrolled at the Vancouver site. Par-
ticipants were drawn from existing treatment or research
wait-lists at the respective sites, through advertisements
at hospitals, universities, and health service centres, and

via word of mouth referrals from clinicians seeing poten-
tially appropriate patients.

Prospective participants were pre-screened on the
phone by a research assistant. The research assistant de-
scribed the study, explained the screening process, and in-
formed potential participants that if found eligible, they
would be randomized to either 12 or 6-months of DBT. If
the individual was interested, the research assistant con-
ducted a telephone screen to gather information pertinent
to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals who met
eligibility criteria were invited to attend an in-person as-
session to determine their eligibility. The
sessment
in-person assessment was conducted by trained study as-
sessors, who were responsible for obtaining prospective
participant consent to participate in the trial. These asses-
sors were also responsible for administering structured in-
terviews and tests that focused on inclusion/exclusion
criteria. If the participant was deemed eligible for partici-
pation, the interview continued to include structured diag-
nostic
Statistical
Manual-IV Axis I and II disorders. The in-person assess-
ment, conducted over the course of 2 days included labora-
tory measures of attention and implicit associations of
emotion regulation with self-harm and the completion of
self-report questionnaires. All procedures were approved by
CAMH and SFU research ethics boards.

Participants
Inclusion criteria
Individuals aged 18–65 were eligible to participate if they
(a) met DSM-IV criteria for BPD based on the Inter-
national Personality Disorders Examination (IPDE), (b) ex-
hibited recent and chronic self-injurious behaviours,
operationalized as at least 2 episodes of self-injury or sui-
cide attempts in the past 5 years, including at least 1 epi-
sode in the past 8 weeks, (c) are proficient in English, (d)
consent to study participation, (e) have not received more
than 8 weeks of standard DBT in the past year, and (f) have
either Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage or
BC Medical Services Plan (MSP) health insurance for 1 year
or more.

Exclusion criteria
Participants were excluded from the study if they (a) met
the criteria for a specific psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder
I, or dementia, based on the DSM-IV [52], (b) have an esti-
mated IQ less than or equal to 70, (c) have a chronic or ser-
ious physical health problem expected to require
hospitalization within the next year (e.g., cancer), or (d)
have plans to move out of the province in the next 2 years.

Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria
Assessors masked to condition assignment and calibrated
with a gold-standard assessor on study instruments are

assessing participants’ symptoms of DSM-IV diagnoses.
BPD criteria are being assessed with the International Per-
sonality Disorder Examination [53], a well-established
semi-structured interview used by the World Health
Organization. Other personality disorders are being
assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for the
DSM-IV, Axis II (SCID-II [54]). DSM-IV Axis I disorders
will be assessed with the SCID-I (for Axis I disorders),
Patient Version ([55]). Cognitive functioning is being
assessed with the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading
(WTAR) [56], a brief measure of verbal intelligence.

Randomization
Individuals who provided informed consent and were
eligible were informed of the treatment arm to which
they were assigned by each site’s coordinator after the
baseline assessment. The allocation scheme was devel-
oped in order to maintain blindness and random assign-
ment, while minimizing wait-list
time and avoiding
unfilled slots in either treatment arm. The allocation
scheme used variable block sizes with permutations of 4
and was generated by the statistician. A research assist-
ant then put the allocation scheme into a series of con-
secutively numbered white, opaque, sealed envelopes
(numbered 1 to n, where n is the study site sample size).
When there was a minimum of 1 opening per each of
the 2 treatment conditions at either treatment site, the
research coordinator opened the next randomization en-
velope, which revealed participant assignment to either
6-months (DBT-6) or 12-months (DBT-12) of DBT.
Randomization was conducted independently at each
site.

Interventions
We are comparing two interventions: DBT 12-months
[25, 57, 58] and DBT 6-months.

DBT is a comprehensive therapy that blends acceptan-
ce-based techniques derived from the Zen tradition [25,
57–59] with strategies from traditional cognitive behav-
ioural therapy (CBT), including problem-solving, behav-
ioural analysis, contingency management, and skills
training techniques. DBT consisted of: 1) weekly 1-h in-
dividual therapy session, 2) a 2-hour weekly skills training
group, 3) access to 24 h/7 days a week telephone consult-
ation and, 4) weekly therapist consultation meetings.

Comparison of DBT-6 and DBT-12
The treatment conditions are comparable on all factors
except for length of treatment. Both treatment condi-
four treatment components, and an
tions involve all
equal number of treatment hours per week. In order to
control for hours of therapy received, participants are
expected to not engage in other primary psychosocial
treatments. Further, to control for possible confounding

effects of therapist characteristics, therapists across the 2
conditions are matched on a number of factors including
expertise, training in DBT, and availability of supervision.

Treatment dropouts
Consistent with the DBT treatment protocol, participants
who fail to attend four consecutive scheduled individual
or group sessions are discontinued from treatment and
will be considered dropouts.

Therapists
Therapists at both sites include doctoral and master’s
level therapists who have attended formal DBT basic
and advanced-level workshops, with a minimum of
2 years of supervised experience in DBT and treating
BPD patients. Senior therapists (SM, JK, AC) who are
certified DBT practitioners with the Linehan Board of
Certification and Accreditation are supervising the ther-
apists and leading supervision and therapist consultation
meetings at each site.

Treatment adherence
Therapist competence and treatment delivery is being
monitored via therapist adherence ratings,
individual
supervision (weekly for students and unregistered clini-
cians who require more monitoring), and weekly DBT
consultation team meetings. All
individual and group
therapy sessions are being videotaped, and therapist ad-
herence is being assessed using the University of Wash-
ington DBT Adherence Rating Scale [60]. This scale
provides scores on a scale of 0 to 5 across a range of
DBT strategies [25, 57–59], with global adherence scores
of ≥4.0 indicating adherence to DBT. Psychology gradu-
ate student coders masked to treatment assignment and
trained to an acceptable level of reliability at the Univer-
sity of Washington in Seattle, WA are independently rat-
ing a random selection of 5% of sessions from each
therapist-patient dyad, with an equal proportion of ses-
sions coded in the pre-treatment orientation (first
4 weeks), early, middle, and late stages of treatment. As
well, 5% of all group sessions are being evaluated for
adherence.

Assessments
Over the course of the study (i.e., 6 or 12 month treat-
ment and follow-up phase), participants are being
assessed at 9 time points: pretreatment, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
18, 21 and 24 months. Outcome measures are the same
as those used in previous RCTs of DBT [27–30, 61, 62],
allowing for comparability with previous outcomes. The
measures are described below, and Table 1 summarizes
the schedule of measures.

Clinical outcomes
Primary outcome
The primary outcome is the frequency and severity of
self-injurious episodes, measured by the Suicide Attempt
Self-Injury Interview (SASII
is a
semi-structured interview that measures frequency and
medical severity of self-injury and suicide attempts and
is administered by trained assessors at all assessment
points to measure self-injury over the previous 3-month
assessment interval.

[63]). The SASII

emergency

Secondary outcomes/predictors of response
Secondary outcomes and predictors of response mea-
sures assess a range of characteristics and suicidal and
self-harm behaviours, health-related outcomes, including
hospitalization,
room visits, psychiatric
symptoms, social functioning, general functioning, and
treatment retention. Characteristics of self-injury (in-
cluding suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury),
including frequency, medical severity, intent to die, le-
thality, and precipitants of self-injury, are being assessed
with the Lifetime Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count
(L-SASI) (Lifetime Parasuicide History; Linehan & Com-
tois, unpublished 1996). See Table 1 for schedule of mea-
sures. Healthcare utilization is being measured with the
Treatment History Interview − 2 (THI-2) (THI; Linehan
& Heard, unpublished 1987), which assesses the number
and type of outpatient psychosocial treatments, number
and duration of hospital admissions, frequency of emer-
gency department visits, and medication use. Borderline
personality disorder severity is being assessed using the
Borderline Symptom List – 23 (BSL-23 [64, 65]), a
self-report measure, assessing the severity of BPD symp-
toms in the past week. Impulsivity is being assessed
using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11 [66]), and
depressive symptoms are being measured using the Beck
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II [67]). The State-Trait
Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2 [68]) is being
used to measure participants’ experiences and expres-
sions of anger. The Symptom Checklist-90 Revised
(SCL-90-R [69]), a widely used self-report questionnaire,
is being used to measure past-week general symptom
distress. Interpersonal functioning is being assessed with
the Inventory of
Interpersonal Problems-64 (IIP-64
[70]), which assesses dysfunctional patterns in interper-
sonal interactions. Social functioning is being assessed
with the Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS-SR
[71]), which measures social adjustment. Health-related
quality of life outcomes are being monitored using the
EuroQol 5D-5 L (EQ-5D-5 L [72]) and the Medical Out-
comes Score Short Form (SF-36 [73]), which assesses
physical and mental health functioning. The Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT [74]) is a
10-item screening questionnaire regarding the amount

and frequency of alcohol consumption, dependence on
alcohol, and problems associated with alcohol use, and
is being used to assess for alcohol-related problems. The
Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST [75]), a 28-item
self-report questionnaire widely used in treatment evalu-
ation research, is being used to assess problems associ-
ated with drug misuse. The Inventory of Statements
About Self-Injury (ISAS [76]), is a self-report question-
naire that measures non-suicidal self-harm behaviors.
Suicidal intentions are assessed using the Beck Scale for
Suicidal Ideation (BSS [77]), a self-report questionnaire
consisting of 19 items. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5
(PCL-5 [78]) is a 20-item self-report measure used to as-
sess symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Emotion
dysregulation is measured using the Difficulties in Emo-
tion Regulation Scale (DERS [79]), a 36-item, self-report.
Mindfulness is being assessed with the Kentucky Inven-
tory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS [80]) self-report ques-
tionnaire. The Dialectical Behavior Therapy-Ways of
Coping Checklist (DBT-WCCL [81]) is used to assess
thoughts and behaviors related to coping strategies dur-
ing stressful events.

The following other measures are administered to as-
sess predictors of response. Demographic information
will be collected with the Demographic Data Schedule
(DDS [82]) at baseline. The NEO-Five Factor Inventory,
short form (NEO-SF [83]), a widely used personality
measure, is being used to assess personality dimensions
(i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness,
and conscientiousness) and is collected at baseline. The
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF
[84]), a self-report measure of childhood abuse and neg-
lect is being collected at 3-months and the Credibility/
Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ [85]) is being collected
at baseline. The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form
(WAI-S [86]), therapist and client version are collected
after each of the first 4 treatment sessions and at 3 and
6-months.

Finally, the Reasons for Early Termination from Treat-
ment Questionnaire (RET-C [87]) is administered to
evaluate reasons for premature termination and is ad-
ministered to participants who drop out of treatment.

Participants are being compensated at a rate of $10
Canadian dollars (CDN) per hour for the completion of
these study measures.

Health economic outcomes
One objective of this research is to compare the cost of
DBT-6 vs DBT-12. Costs include direct treatment cost,
(e.g., hospitalization, emergency
health services cost
room visits, day surgery or procedure, physician visits,
medications), productivity costs, and law enforcement
and related cost. The cost analysis will be based on the
healthcare resources data obtained from the THI-2 in

the trial and with participant consent, imported to and
linked with federal and provincial administrative data-
bases (for Ontario, the Institute for Clinical Evaluative
Sciences; for British Columbia, B.C. Population Health;
in addition to the Canadian Institute for Health Informa-
tion). Additionally, using established guidelines
for
cost-effectiveness research [88], data on therapist and
consultation team time devoted to research participants
(e.g.,
and group sessions,
individual
between-session communication) are being collected
and used to calculate per patient cost of
service
provision based on expected service provider costs (e.g.,
salary, benefits).

Genetic data
An amendment to the original protocol for the addition
of a genetic component to the study and collection of
saliva samples was approved in September, 2015. A sep-
arate consent form was developed for this data collec-
tion. Participants’ who provide consent to the genetic
study are required to provide five small saliva samples
(about half a teaspoon each) to the research team at the
following time points: a) at baseline, b) at 6-months, c)
1 year, d) one-and-a-half years, and e) 2 years into the
study. These time-based samples will be used specifically
for epigenetic comparisons before, during and after DBT
treatment. Patients are receiving $20 remuneration per
saliva sample.

Data collection for the study began in February, 2015

and is expected to be complete by July, 2019.

Interview outcome data will be double data-entered.
Other data collected via an electronic encrypted data
management system are not double data entered. Data is
stored on an encrypted server. Study outcome data is
stored in a locked cabinet in accordance with ethical
guidelines governing the management of data. All study
data collected will be maintained for 25 years before be-
ing destroyed.

Masking of treatment allocation
Several methods will be used to conceal treatment allo-
cation of participants and protect against sources of bias.
Therapists will not function as assessors, and vice versa.
Study assessors are masked to participants’ treatment as-
signment with the exception of assessors who administer
the Treatment History Interview-2 (THI-2) (THI; Line-
han & Heard, unpublished 1987). This measure includes
questions about the treatment received and may disclose
the condition to which the participant is assigned, there-
fore an RA who is not masked to the participant’s treat-
ment assignment will conduct
this interview. Third,
both therapists and assessors will consistently be
the study masking requirements, and

discussions about clients between therapists and asses-
sors will be discouraged.

specific, within individual, self-harm that can bias esti-
mates of true self-harm rates.

Sample size and power analysis
The study was designed to test whether DBT-6 is not in-
ferior to DBT-12 (an established treatment). The esti-
mate of the sample size required for a non-inferiority
test was based on the effect sizes from prior DBT RCTs
[30, 62]. Post-treatment suicide and self-harm estimates
over 4 months were 2.26 episodes for DBT-6 and 0.73
for DBT-12 (SDpooled = 4). We expected no significant
differences between the DBT-6 and DBT-12 conditions
in terms of reductions in the frequency and severity of
self-injury episodes at 1 year. We therefore defined our
delta, the clinically significant range of indifference for
our non-inferiority trial, as a difference in outcomes of
1.53 (SD = .04) episodes in the frequency of self-harm
episodes at post-treatment. To achieve this maximum of
1.53 or less in the difference of self-injury rates with ad-
equate power (α = .05; 1 - β = .80), 85 participants per
group are required to show non-inferiority of treatment.
Allowing for a 30% dropout rate, we will recruit 120 par-
ticipants per group. The sample size calculation also ad-
dresses the necessary power for secondary analyses,
given that the sample size required for null hypothesis
significance testing is typically less than those required
for non-inferiority [89].

Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics
We will examine rates of ineligibility. Demographic and
clinical characteristics will be summarized using descrip-
tive statistics.

Primary analyses
Comparison of DBT-6 versus DBT-12 Analyses will be
conducted at the end of treatment and at the end of
follow-up. No interim analyses are planned. The outcome
analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.
The primary outcomes, frequency and severity of suicide
and self-harm behaviours, are both expected to have a
skewed distribution. The count nature of the self-injury
frequency variable, as well as the self-injury severity rat-
ings, are integers bounded by zero. As well, given the de-
pendencies of the observations over time and individual
variability, our primary analyses will employ a multi-
level random effects Poisson growth curve model.
The occasion level random effects will capture sec-
ondary over-dispersion due to the heterogeneity of obser-
vations within participant self-injury reporting [88, 90].
These random effects will follow a log-normal distribution
[91], and will reduce or eliminate the disturbance effects
associated with the differences between rates and forms of

Specific tests of our primary hypotheses (non-inferiority
tests of equivalence and post hoc comparisons of differ-
ence) will be model-based [92] using contrasting means
and regression coefficients. Evaluation of model fit will be
provided by statistical indices including Akaike’s Informa-
tion Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria
(BIC) and likelihood ratio tests. To perform the compari-
son of self-injury outcomes at post-treatment (our primary
research interest), 1-sided non-inferiority t-tests of the
marginal means will be performed. If missing data are at
moderate levels or are related to a specific set of covariates
or outcome, we will compare multiple imputation [93],
growth curve analysis [94], and instrumental variables
analysis [95] since no one technique is demonstrably su-
perior [96]. We will also examine differences in sites and
therapist characteristics that may be evidenced in treat-
ment outcomes.

Health economic analyses
We will compare the cost of DBT-6 vs DBT-12 from the
perspective of the public healthcare payer. The output
will be the incremental cost of DBT-6 compared to
DBT-12. We will analyze the total cost as a dependent
variable, using a regression model to estimate the differ-
ence in expected healthcare cost between the two
groups. The intervention will be the primary independ-
ent variable and the regression model will adjust for po-
tential confounding variables. In theory, an ordinary least
squares model produces unbiased estimates even if the
data are skewed; however, additional estimation methods
(e.g., generalized linear models) and different uncertainty
methods (e.g., parametric and non-parametric bootstrap-
ping) will be explored to facilitate investigation of the im-
pact of various cost assumptions [97–99].

and

incremental

Additionally, as a secondary economic analysis, we will
explore the economic evaluation using the net benefit
regression framework [100]. The outcome will be the in-
cremental net benefit from DBT-6 for the intervention
group compared to the standard DBT-12 group. We will
also estimate the incremental cost per one self-injury
episode
per
the
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, derived from
the SF-36 and EQ-5D-5 L data. To estimate QALYs
gained, we will convert SF-36 and EQ-5D-5 L data col-
lected in the trial to utility scores using a validated algo-
rithm [101–103]. The QALY is the gold standard measure
of effectiveness recommended for economic evaluation
and allows for a more global measure of the impact of a
clinical
intervention. Calculating QALYs requires the
combination of health-related quality of life measures with
data on health state duration. The EQ-5D-5 L has been
life of patients with

schizophrenia [104] and depression [105]; however, re-
cently its validity in BPD studies has been questioned, so
the SF-36 will be used for comparison in a sensitivity ana-
lysis. Statistical uncertainty will be characterized using a
95% confidence interval and a cost-effectiveness accept-
ability curve (CEAC) [106].

Attrition and treatment implementation
We will examine rates of treatment completion and at-
trition across both groups. We will conduct survival ana-
lyses to examine differences in the timing of treatment
dropouts. In addition, we will compare rates of use of
psychotropic medications and other adjunctive treat-
ments at baseline and across both treatments. Treatment
adherence ratings across both treatment arms will be
evaluated. We also will examine potential site differences
between the CAMH and SFU sites in terms of partici-
pant characteristics, and attrition. We will also examine
potential therapist effects on treatment implementation
and dropout rates.

Secondary analysis

Analyses of subtypes of BPD patients likely to benefit
from DBT-6 versus DBT-12 Analyses related to predic-
tors of treatment response will
involve growth curve
modeling, with covariates, with the two arms using both
linear and over-dispersed Poisson hierarchical models.
The effects of impulsivity and the rates of self-injury will
be managed by person centering the variables. Growth
curve models will be used to estimate the trajectories of
the 4 diagnostic groups that are expected to moderate
treatment response (PTSD, GAD, Cluster A, and Cluster
C), but without the inclusion of covariates, provided they
are not needed. Each diagnostic category will be esti-
mated independently within a single model. The tests of
both slopes and marginal effects will be carried out
post-estimation, and will involve pair-wise multiple com-
parisons with alpha levels that are Holm’s Sequential
Bonferroni adjusted.

Data safety monitoring
A data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) was estab-
lished and composed of three independent researchers
specializing in BPD and self-harm, cognitive behavior
therapy, and biostatistics. The DSMC is responsible for
monitoring the research protocol, reviewing data, asses-
sing the safety of the trial, reporting adverse events,
reviewing unanticipated problems,
and monitoring
protocol violations in accordance with the policies and
procedures outlined in the institutional research ethics
boards (REBs) at each site and in accordance with Can-
adian Institutes of Health Research’s (CIHR) policies and
procedures concerning data and safety monitoring. The

DSMC will communicate any new information to the
REB at both sites over the course of the trial, and the
site supervisors (SM, AC), in consultation with the re-
search team will make the decision whether to continue,
suspend, modify or stop the trial, or amend the protocol.
The site supervisors (SM, AC) are responsible for moni-
toring and reporting serious adverse events to the
DSMC. Serious adverse events are defined as any unto-
ward medical occurrence that
is
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disabil-
ity/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect,
or any important medical event that may jeopardize the
health of the research participant or may require medical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Serious adverse events involving self-harm behaviour was
operationalized as very high to severe medical risk accord-
ing to the SASII lethality scale.

Discussion
This will be the first rigorously controlled trial compar-
ing two different lengths of DBT for individuals with
BPD and chronic suicidal behaviour. Given the severity
[4, 5] and societal costs of BPD [17–19], and the limited
resources available for psychotherapy for BPD [39, 40],
findings have the potential to significantly impact clinical
practice. If 6- months of DBT produces comparable clin-
ical outcomes to 1-year of DBT, the briefer version
would be an excellent, less resource intensive alternative
that could help to increase access to treatment, reducing
wait times and enable more people to be treated. If
6 months of DBT became the new standard length of
treatment, it would reduce the direct costs and resources
compared with 1-year. If the study hypotheses are con-
firmed, the findings could encourage decision-makers to
invest in the development of briefer programs, improv-
ing treatment accessibility.

Limitations of the study include the following: This
study design does not include a control arm that could
control for the passage of time. Though this would pro-
vide a more rigorous test of our study hypotheses, a
third control arm (e.g., wait-list or treatment as usual)
was ruled out due to ethical concerns and because of the
strong evidence base demonstrating that
standard
DBT-12 is superior to unstructured treatment as usual
controls. As well, concomitant psychotropic medications
will be uncontrolled. While psychotropic utilization is a
potential confound in the current study design, the re-
striction of medications would reduce referrals to the
study and also pose a threat to external validity. Indeed,
previous trials indicate that an estimated 80% of patients
will be on at least one psychotropic medication [107, 108]
and thus, restricting medication use would compromise
the representativeness of the study sample. Therefore, by
the trial, we
monitoring medication use throughout

McMain et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:230

believe that the current study balances the internal and
external validity in a manner that is the best way to ad-
vance treatment of this population.

Study timeframe
Study enrollment began in February, 2015 and the total
sample of 240 participants was completed by June, 2017.
The active treatment phase is expected to be finished in
June, 2018. The completion of follow-up assessments is
expected in July, 2019. The dissemination of final results
at international meetings is expected by the Fall of 2019.
Publication of the findings is planned for 2020.
