Abstract
Acquiring age-appropriate social skills, arguably a major prerequisite for favorable psychosocial development in children, 
is targeted in a range of interventions. Hence, identifying factors that limit this acquisition may inform preventative and 
treatment efforts. Personality disorders are characterized by pervasive and enduring dysfunctional interpersonal functioning, 
including parenting, and could thus entail risk for offspring in not developing adaptive interpersonal skills. However, no study 
has tested this possibility. A representative sample drawn from two birth cohorts of Norwegian 4-year-olds (n = 956) and 
their parents was followed up at ages 6, 8, and 10 years. Parents’ personality disorder symptoms were measured dimension-
ally with the DSM-IV and ICD-10 Personality Questionnaire, and children’s social skills were evaluated by the Social Skills 
Rating System. A difference-in-difference approach was applied to adjust for all unmeasured time-invariant confounders, and 
parental symptoms of depression and anxiety were entered as covariates. Increased Cluster B symptoms in parents of children 
aged 4 to 6 years predicted decreased social skill development in offspring (B = −0.97, 95% CI −1.58, −0.37, p = 0.002). 
On a more granular level, increased symptoms of borderline (B = −0.39, CI −0.65, −0.12, p = 0.004), histrionic (B = −0.55, 
CI −0.99, −0.11, p = 0.018), and avoidant (B = −0.46, CI−0.79, −0.13, p = 0.006) personality disorders in parents predicted 
decreased social skill development in offspring. Subclinical levels of borderline, histrionic and avoidant personality disor-
ders in parents may impair the development of social skills in offspring. Successfully treating these personality problems or 
considering them when providing services to children may facilitate children’s acquisition of social skills.

Introduction

Social competence is the ability to interact successfully and 
effectively with others [37], and social skills contribute to 
this efficacy. Attaining social skills is a significant devel-
opmental task and is considered an essential component of 
healthy functioning, development and adjustment, as indi-
cated by its ability to predict high academic achievement 
[9], better friendships and peer acceptance [44], and favora-
ble mental health [7]. Moreover, improving social skills is 
a prime focus for a range of interventions for a multitude 
of psychopathologies. Therefore, to aid the development

of effective health and educational policies, as well as pre-
ventative and treatment efforts, identifying determinants of 
social skills is a vital endeavor. Parental mental health prob-
lems have been identified as one factor limiting the acquisi-
tion of social skills in offspring [11]. To date, attention has 
predominantly been drawn to parental depression [24, 50] 
and anxiety [13]. By focusing extensively on emotional and 
behavioral disorders, researchers may have overlooked the 
potential contribution from other conditions.

Social skills are learned, shaped, and influenced through 
interaction with competent partners, such as parents [31]. Par-
ents are believed to help children learn social skills through 
their sensitive use of practices, such as induction, feedback, 
social coaching, and monitoring of their child’s interactions 
with others [31, 39]. In contrast, insensitive, unresponsive, 
inconsistent, harsh, or punitive parents may not only hinder 
the learning of prosocial behavior [36] but also directly model 
socially incompetent or even antisocial behavior [8]. Personal-
ity disorders (PDs) are characterized by enduring dysfunctional

interpersonal patterns, deviant cognitive and affective modu-
lation, low impulse control, unstable emotion regulation and 
affective lability [3]. Hence, it seems reasonable to hypothesize 
that parental PDs interfere with parenting in a way that is deci-
sive for offspring social skills acquisition. This contention was 
supported by multiple reviews and a meta-analysis conclud-
ing that paranoid, schizotypal, borderline, and avoidant PDs 
are indeed associated with impairments in parenting and par-
ent–child interactions [40, 49], whereas the other PDs were 
not associated with impairments in the parent–child domain. 
Notably, because research on PDs other than borderline and 
antisocial PDs (both belonging to Cluster B) is limited, any 
null effects in such summaries of previous findings should be 
interpreted cautiously; thus, available findings do not allow for 
specific hypothesis about differential effects of different PDs on 
offspring social skills. No study has investigated whether symp-
toms of parental PDs might limit the development of social 
skills in children, a task that we undertake herein.

The above indirect evidence linking parental PDs to offspring 
social skills stems from observational research. Both adult PDs 
[23] and child social skills [20] are heritable. Hence, although 
not directly examined, these heritabilities may overlap, and 
the associations between parental PDs and child social skills 
may be due to passive gene-environment correlation. To adjust 
for the impact of time-invariant between-person confounding 
(e.g., genes), we therefore test whether changes in parental PD 
symptoms predict changes in children’s social skills [1]. Even 
so, the findings may still be influenced by time-varying con-
founders. We therefore correct for the arguably most likely 
time-varying confounders [17], namely parental depression and 
anxiety. While the DSM-5 conceptualizes PDs as categorical, 
evidence strongly suggests that they are continuous in nature 
[47]. Consequently, we examine PDs dimensionally. Moreover, 
describing the 10 PDs as belonging to three clusters (A = odd-
eccentric: paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal; B = dramatic, 
emotional, or erratic: antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and nar-
cissistic; C = anxious or fearful: avoidant, dependent, and obses-
sive–compulsive) may prove useful in the current context, as the 
PDs within each cluster share some of the same interpersonal 
features and may hence affect children’s social skills in similar 
ways. Symptoms of PDs are therefore examined both cluster-
wise and individually. Given the above preliminary evidence, 
we hypothesize that an increase in symptoms of parental PDs 
when the child is aged 4–6 years will predict a decline in social 
skills in the child from age 4–10 years.

Methods

Procedure and participants

The  2003  and  2004  birth  cohorts  living  in  Trondheim 
(N = 3456),  Norway,  were  asked  to  participate  in  the 

Trondheim  Early  Secure  Study  (TESS)  [42]  through  a 
letter of invitation that included the Strength and Diffi-
culties Questionnaire for 4- to 16-year-olds, a screening 
tool for mental health problems (SDQ) [19,  43]. Parents 
were asked to complete the questionnaire and bring it with 
them when attending the well-child clinic for a regular 
health check for children at age 4 years (3358 attended). 
Parents who lacked sufficient proficiency in Norwegian 
to fill out the SDQ were excluded (n = 176), and 166 par-
ents were missed being asked. Health nurses informed 
the  parents  about  the  study  and  obtained  their  written 
consent to participate (n = 2477; 82.2% consent rate). To 
increase variability and statistical power, children with 
behavioral  and  emotional  problems  were  oversampled 
by allocating children to four strata based on their SDQ 
scores (cut-offs: 0–4, 5–8, 9–11 and 12–40). This over-
sampling was accounted for in the analyses. The likeli-
hood of being included in the study increased as SDQ 
scores increased (0.37, 0.48, 0.70, and 0.89 in the respec-
tive strata). Thus, 1,250 participants were randomly drawn, 
and 1,007 were successfully examined in the first wave 
(T1; Mage = 4.59, SD = 0.25). Children were followed up 
at  ages  6  (T2; n = 795;  Mage = 6.72,  SD = 0.19),  8  (T3; 
n = 699;  Mage = 8.79,  SD = 0.23)  and  10  (T4;  n = 702; 
Mage = 10.51,  SD = 0.17). Families with valid data from 
at least one wave were included and formed the analytical 
sample (n = 956; 49.1% boys). Parental PDs were exam-
ined at T1 and T2. Little’s MCAR test [28] including all 
study variables strongly suggested that data were missing 
completely at random, χ2 = 1785.23,  df = 7,064, p  = 1.00. 
In 44 cases, the parent accompanying the child at T2 was 
not the same as the parent at T1, and in those cases, values 
were considered missing at T2. The sample, adjusted for 
stratification, was similar to the population of parents of 
4-year-olds in Trondheim with respect to educational level, 
employment  and  type  of  position,  but  contained  more 
divorced parents (6.8%) than the population (2.1%). The 
population of Trondheim shares several similarities with 
the average Norwegian population in terms of employment 
(equal to the national rate), average gross income (99.5% 
of the national average) and households (two-parent fami-
lies account for 80.0% of the households compared to a 
national average of 81.4%) [46].

Measures

Parental symptoms of personality disorders: The DSM-IV 
and ICD-10 Personality Questionnaire (DIP-Q) [33] is a 
self-report questionnaire consisting of 140 items scored 
categorically (true/false) to capture both categorical diag-
noses and dimensional measures of all ten DSM-IV and all 
eight ICD-10 personality disorders. The number of scores 

1 3

1563

was summed. For diagnostic purposes, a five-item distress/
impairment scale is also included along with the Global 
Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale [2]. A score of ≥ 2 
on the distress/impairment scale and a GAF score of ≤ 70 
is required for a diagnosis to be set. Favorable reliabil-
ity and validity in clinical as well as non-clinical samples 
have been documented [33–35]. Because item responses 
were dichotomous, an ordinal theta coefficient was used 
to  examine  reliability  [51].  The  levels  of  internal  con-
sistency for Clusters A, B and C at the two time points 
were θ = 0.89/0.88; θ = 0.95/0.95; and θ = 0.89/0.88. With 
respect to individual PDs, acceptable values were identified 
as follows: paranoid: θ = 0.88/0.82; schizoid: θ = 0.70/0.70; 
schizotypal:  θ = 0.90/0.87;  antisocial:  θ = 85/0.80;  bor-
derline:  θ = 0.91/0.90;  histrionic:  θ = 0.76/0.78;  narcis-
sistic: θ = 0.77/0.77; avoidant:  θ = 0.87/0.89; dependent: 
θ = 0.75/0.74; and obsessive–compulsive: θ = 0.71/0.71.

Social skills in children: Parents evaluated their chil-
dren’s social skills using the Social Skills Rating System 
(SSRS) [21]. The SSRS measures four major social skills 
with 10 items each on a four-point scale that form the basis 
of socially competent behavior that facilitates social interac-
tions in different social settings: cooperation, assertiveness, 
self-control and responsibility. The reliability and validity 
of SSRS have been consistently established through a wide 
range of studied across the globe (e.g., [22]). Given that we 
had no specific hypotheses for the separate dimensions, the 
SSRS total scale was applied (α = 0.89–0.92).

Parental symptoms of depression and anxiety: The Beck 
Depression Inventory-II [5], α = 0.87/0.87, and the Beck 
Anxiety Inventory [4], α = 0.82/0.87 are 21-item measures 
applying a 4-point scale and were used to measure the covar-
iates parental symptoms of depression and anxiety. Their 
psychometric properties have been extensively documented 
in a range of studies [5, 18].

Statistical analysis

Analyses were conducted using Mplus version 8.1 [32] 
Population weights were applied to arrive at correct popu-
lation estimates, corresponding to the number of children 
in the population in a stratum divided by the number of 
participants in that stratum. A robust maximum likelihood 
estimator (MLR) that does not presuppose multivariate 
normality was used. The estimator also provides robust 
standard errors. Missing-ness was handled according to a 
full information maximum likelihood procedure using all 
available data.

To adjust for time-invariant confounding, we applied a 
change–predicting–change approach, which is essentially 
a fixed-effects analysis [1], using latent growth curves. In 
this model, each child’s development over time is modeled 
by two latent constructs, the intercept (level, relative to 
others) and slope (change, relative to oneself). Intercepts 
were set at T1, and the slopes were represented as yearly 
changes. To accommodate growth curve analysis with two 
measurement points (i.e., parental PD symptoms, depres-
sion, and anxiety), the variances in observed PDs at each 
point were set to zero, thereby transferring the variance to 
the latent constructs of interest (intercept and slope). We 
first tested a model comprising the three clusters, anxiety 
and depression. All slopes were regressed on all intercepts 
to control for regression toward the mean effects. Changes 
(latent growth) in social skills were regressed on the num-
ber of symptoms (intercept) and changes in the number of 
symptoms (slope) in each cluster, anxiety, and depression. 
All slopes and all intercepts were allowed to correlate, see 
Fig. 1 for a simplified version of the model. Second, we 
examined the effect of symptoms of specific PDs in three 
separate models—one for each cluster.

Results

At T1 and T2, respectively, 8.8% (95% CI: 7.7–10.2 and 
10.4% (95% CI: 9.1–12.0) fulfilled the criteria for at least 
one personality disorder. The level of social skills increased 
from age 4 to 10 years (Table 1), as reflected in an uncon-
ditional latent growth curve model (yearly increase = 4.80, 
p < 0.001). With respect to parental PD clusters, the mean 
number of symptoms was highest for parental PD Clus-
ter C at both the initial testing and 2 years later. Except 
for a negligible decrease in Cluster B symptoms (yearly 
change = −0.02,  p = 0.034), the number of symptoms did 
not change from T1 to T2 at the group level. Even so, vari-
ances in intra-individual changes were substantial (social

B = 0.09, p < 0.001, Cluster C = 0.17, p < 0.001).

Clusters  of  PDs:  A  change–predicting–change 
model  including  the  three  clusters  did  fit  the  data  well, 
χ2 = 72.63,  df = 28,  p < 0.001,  CFI = 0.986,  TLI = 0.954, 
RMSEA = 0.041 (90% CI 0.029, 0.052). Increased parental 
symptoms of Cluster B PDs, but not Cluster A or C PDs, 
predicted decreased social skills when adjusted for the social 
skills intercept (level) and intercept and slope (change) in 
parental depression and anxiety (Table 2). Higher levels of 
social skills were correlated with fewer symptoms of Clus-
ter A (r = −0.08, p = 0.013), B (r = −0.09, p = 0.015), and C 
(r = −0.16, p < 0.001) PDs, as well as less anxiety (r = −0.11, 
p < 0.001) and depression (r = −0.11, p = 0.001) in parents.
Individual PDs: Low levels (intercept) of social skills 
correlated with more symptoms (intercepts) of schizoid 
(r = −0.11,  p = 0.008), borderline (r  = −0.12,  p = 0.001), 
avoidant  (r = −0.15,  p < 0.001),  dependent  (r  = −0.18, 
p < 0.001), and obsessive–compulsive (r = −0.09, p = 0.024) 
PDs—but not with symptoms of schizotypal (r = −0.06, 
p = 0.095),  paranoid  (r  = −0.06,  p = 0.095),  antisocial 
(r = −0.01,  p = 0.93), histrionic (r = −0.02,  p = 0.64), and 
narcissistic (r = −0.04, p = 0.31) PDs.

With respect to symptoms of individual PDs predicting 
changes in social skills, increased borderline and histrionic 
PD  symptoms  predicted  decreased  social  skills  [model 
fit: χ2 = 0.57, df = 28, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.933, 
RMSEA = 0.042 (90% CI 0.030, 0.053)] (Table 3). Moreo-
ver, a higher level of parental antisocial PD at age 4 pre-
dicted declining social skills. Furthermore, no predictive 
effect of parental narcissistic PD symptoms was found with 
respect to either its intercept or slope. Although there were 
no observed associations between the level and change in 
overall (summed) symptoms of individual disorders belong-
ing to Cluster A [model fit: χ2 = 66.72, df = 23, p < 0.001,

symptoms (Cluster A) and both a higher level and increase 
in avoidant PD symptoms (Cluster C) predicted reduced 
social skills.

Discussion

Becoming socially competent is a prerequisite for favora-
ble psychosocial development and adjustment in children, 
and improving social skills is a focus of a range of treat-
ment and intervention efforts. Although there are several 
reasons  to  expect  elevated  PD  symptoms  in  parents  to 
make it more difficult for children to learn age-appropri-
ate social skills, this possibility has never been examined. 
Drawing on a representative community sample followed 
up over 4 waves with children aged 4–10 years, we found 

that increased Cluster B PD symptoms, specifically bor-
derline and histrionic PD symptoms, as well as avoidant 
PD (Cluster C) symptoms predicted decreased social skills 
in offspring, including when all unmeasured time-invariant 
confounding and time-varying levels of parental anxiety 
and depression were adjusted for. Additionally, more anti-
social, avoidant, and paranoid PD symptoms predicted 
reduced social skills.

Previous studies have chronicled children of parents with 
Cluster B PDs to be at risk for a variety of problems, such 
as insecure attachment, emotion dysregulation, and poor 
mental health [6, 16, 41]; the majority of studies addressed 
borderline PD and, to some extent, antisocial traits in par-
ents. We extend this research by showing that the acquisi-
tion of social skills in children may also suffer, that chil-
dren of parents with histrionic symptoms are at risk as 
well, and that this potential intergenerational transmission 
is not attributable to time-invariant factors, such as shared 
genes or stable socio-economic factors and living condi-
tions. Future work should detail the mechanisms by which 
parental PD symptoms affect the social skills of offspring, 
but we suggest three mechanisms. First, rapid shifts in emo-
tions, unpredictability and self-preoccupation are expected 
in parents with symptoms of borderline, antisocial and his-
trionic PDs. Social skills enhancing parenting, such as sen-
sitivity, consistency, scaffolding, and autonomy granting, 
may hence suffer [12, 15, 39]. Second, parents with these 
personality problems may also model ineffective ways of 
behaving in interpersonal relationships, including how to 
handle conflicts and intimacy, which their children adopt 
[38]. Third, such parental behavior may also compromise 
secure parent–child attachment [27, 29], thus leading chil-
dren to develop internal working models that undermine 
socially  competent  behavior.  Future  studies  should  test 
these propositions and examine the full mediating chain 
from symptoms of PDs via parenting practices, modeling, 
and attachment to the social skills of offspring.

In addition, higher levels and increased parental avoidant 
PD symptoms predicted declines in children’s social skills. 
Avoidant PD is characterized by social inhibition and avoid-
ance of interpersonal contact due to a fear of criticism and 
rejection and feelings of inadequacy [3]. Although avoidant 
PD has received far less attention than borderline and anti-
social PDs, available evidence suggests that these avoidant 
PD features may be mirrored in the parent–child relationship 
[49], possibly through overprotection, intrusive control and 
messages to the child that the outside world is dangerous 
[48], thereby limiting children’s social interaction with peers 
and other adults from whom social skills can be learned and 
refined. Considering the substantial comorbidity between 
avoidant PD and social anxiety disorder, arguably reflecting 
that avoidant PD represents a severe version of social anxi-
ety disorder [45], it is notable that symptoms of avoidant 

1 31566

PD predicted reduced social skills even when the degree 
of parental anxiety was adjusted for. Possibly, the lack of 
intimacy,  openness  and  self-respect  typical  of  avoidant 
PD but not necessarily seen in social anxiety [14, 30] may 
limit children’s social experiences as well as model socially 
incompetent behavior.

Contrary  to  our  hypothesis,  increased  symptoms  of 
Cluster A, most Cluster C PDs and narcissistic PD (Clus-
ter B) symptoms did not forecast decreased social skills. 
It is generally believed that the interpersonal problems 
inherent in PDs pervade all social relationships [3], but 
a  recent  meta-analysis  concluded  that  in  general,  not 
all relationships are affected and that the ones that are 
afflicted vary between PDs [49]. Except for the present 
predictive effect of avoidant PD symptoms and the lack 
of risk found for children of parents with symptoms of 
paranoid PD, the parental PD symptoms that we found to 
entail risk for reduced offspring social skills overlap with 
the PDs that have been associated with impairment in the 
parent–child domain [49]. We extend these cross-sectional 
findings by demonstrating prospective impacts of paren-
tal symptoms of PDs, even when the model is adjusted 
for all time-invariant confounders and comorbid anxiety 
and depression. Nonetheless, even if we did not detect 
effects in late pre-school and the first years of school, the 
parenting that is necessary for acquiring social skills may 
be different from that which is necessary in middle child-
hood and adolescence. Sensitivity, responsiveness, and the 
provision of external emotion regulation may prove par-
ticularly important during early childhood [26]—capaci-
ties that are distinctly impaired in Cluster B disorders. In 
late middle childhood and adolescence, however, auton-
omy-granting and monitoring activities outside the fam-
ily become increasingly relevant [15], and such parenting 
may be especially difficult for parents with Cluster A and 
C problems. Thus, the present findings, including the lack 
of effects of Cluster A and C PD symptoms, are confined 
to the age span studied and do not necessarily generalize 
to other developmental periods.

The finding that changes in parental antisocial and nar-
cissistic PD symptoms do not predict child social skills is 
surprising given the severity of these disorders. However, 
a high level of antisocial PD symptoms for a parent with a 
child aged 4 did predict decreased social skills of the child. 
The intercept captures one’s level relative to that of oth-
ers, and a range of unmeasured factors could influence it, 
including time-invariant factors, which might also impact 
future changes in social skills. Thus, causal interpretations 
are restricted compared to those possible with change–pre-
dicting–change results, as unmeasured time-invariant con-
founders are not ruled out. For example, shared genetic fac-
tors between parents and offspring could plausibly account 
for the effect.

Strengths and limitations

This study has several strengths, such as the use of a large, 
representative community sample, longitudinal design, and 
a within-person approach to analyze longitudinal relations. 
However, some limitations should be noted. First, although 
there is little to indicate that PDs are categorical in nature 
[47], we cannot be certain that the present findings extend to 
the categorical conceptualization of PDs, because functional 
impairment was not considered. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy 
that even low or moderate PD symptoms can impact chil-
dren. Second, information about PD symptoms was obtained 
through a self-report questionnaire, the DIP-Q. Although 
the DIP-Q ratings of symptoms concur with those obtained 
through diagnostic interviews [33], only a moderate level of 
correspondence has been reported for some disorders, par-
ticularly for narcissistic, schizoid and schizotypal symptoms. 
Hence, the present null findings with respect to these problems 
should be interpreted with caution. Third, parents reported 
on both their PD symptoms and their children’s social skills. 
Hence, correlations could emerge due to common methods. 
However, because we analyzed how changes in PD symptoms 
predicted changes in social skills, factors that did not change 
during the observation period (such as the rater) were adjusted 
for, thus limiting the impact of common methods. Fourth, 
although all unmeasured time-invariant factors and time-vary-
ing depression and anxiety were controlled, unmeasured time-
varying factors may still influence and aggravate parents’ PD 
symptoms and children’s social skills. Individuals with PDs 
are often very sensitive to environmental changes, which can 
lead to profound emotional, behavioral, and cognitive reac-
tions (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Hence, time-
varying factors, such as inter-parental conflicts and stress-
ful life events, may not only be responsible for aggravating 
parents’ PD symptoms but also negatively impact children’s 
social skills [10, 25]. Finally, this study focused exclusively 
on the predictive power of PD symptoms for child social skills 
but did not assess the hypothesized mediating parenting fac-
tors, a task awaiting future research.

Conclusion

The present study finds, for the first time, that an increase 
in parental symptoms of parental borderline, histrionic 
and avoidant PDs predicts a decrease in social skills in 
offspring from pre-school to middle childhood, includ-
ing when all unmeasured time-invariant confounders and 
parental depression and anxiety are accounted for. Hence, 
service providers for both children and adults should be 
aware that such personality problems, even at subclinical 
levels, may interfere with children’s acquisition of age-
appropriate social skills.
