Introduction: Childhood traumatization can result in physical and mental health
problems in adulthood, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which
negatively inﬂuences quality of life and social functioning. Although evidence
based trauma treatments beneﬁt clients with PTSD after childhood abuse and
comorbid personality disorders, they are less effective than in clients who were
traumatized in adulthood, and drop-out is substantial. The current study aims to
assess the effects of inpatient dialectical behavior therapy combined with
prolonged exposure (DBT-PTSD) on severity of PTSD, dissociation, parasuicidal
behavior and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in clients with severe PTSD
and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Secondary outcomes are social functioning,
quality of life, borderline and cluster C personality disorder symptoms as
treatment predictors, treatment trajectories, clients’ experiences and health
economic consequences.

Methods: The naturalistic, longitudinal Trauma Therapy Study is conducted from
January 2019 until May 2025 in a mental healthcare center in the Netherlands.
Clients with severe PTSD and comorbid conditions who are referred to inpatient
DBT-PTSD are included into the study. Based on power analyses a total sample
size of N=56 is needed. Measurements take place before the waiting list period,
at pre- and posttreatment and at six- and twelve-months follow-up. Clients ﬁll in
a daily DBT-PTSD diary, which gives insight into individual symptom trajectories.

Results: Statistical analyses include two-sided paired samples t-tests,
linear
mixed model analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses. Qualitative interviews
are conducted within two years posttreatment and analyzed using a
phenomenological approach. We correct for chance capitalization by using a
conservative a-level of.01. Multiple imputation is used to handle missing data.

Discussion: Research on the effects of integrated treatment programs for clients
with severe PTSD and co-morbid conditions is scarce. This study extends current
knowledge on the effects of inpatient DBT-PTSD on PTSD and BPD symptoms,
clients’ social functioning and quality of life. In addition, it provides insight into
inspiring future treatment
individual symptom trajectories and experiences,
improvements for clients with severe psychopathology.

1 Introduction

Adverse childhood experiences,

like physical, sexual or
emotional abuse can lead to physical and mental health problems
in adulthood (1), including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
or complex PTSD (see Box 1). PTSD symptoms, like intrusions,
avoidance, negative trauma-related cognitions and mood and
hyperarousal (4) have a great negative impact on quality of life
(5) and social functioning (6, 7). PTSD has a life-time prevalence of
3.9% (8) and often co-occurs with mental health problems, such as
depression, anxiety, dissociation, substance use disorders, eating
disorders and borderline personality disorder (BPD) (9–13). Clients
with histories of severe childhood trauma seem to experience more
severe PTSD symptoms and dissociation (14, 15), have more
trouble with emotion regulation (14) and report a poor quality of
life (5). Also, a greater number of childhood trauma types is related
to a poorer mental and physical quality of life (16).

Although clients with PTSD after childhood abuse do beneﬁt
from evidence-based treatments (17, 18), there is room for
improvement. For one, pooled drop-out rates vary between 16%
and 41.5% (19, 20), appear to be greater in trauma-focused
therapies and with childhood abuse-related PTSD (19, 21).
Further, symptoms seem to improve to a lesser extent after
interpersonal trauma (22), for clients with complex PTSD after
childhood (sexual) abuse (23) and for clients with comorbid

personality disorders (24). Also, emotion regulation and quality
of life do not automatically improve after PTSD treatment, as
shown in a systematic review and meta-analysis (18). For
example, women with PTSD after childhood trauma reported
very modest quality of life improvements that moved from ‘very
low’ before Cognitive Processing Therapy to ‘low’ afterwards (5).
Recently, more integrated and personalized interventions were
suggested to improve treatment results (25, 26).

One such approach is the integration of Dialectical Behaviour
Therapy (DBT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE). Several groups have
studied a combination of PE and DBT, to make PTSD treatment
accessible for clients with complex psychopathology, including
high-risk behavior (27), and to address the needs of clients with
chronic PTSD after childhood sexual abuse (28, 29). A systematic
review and meta-analysis of inpatient and outpatient treatments
that combine DBT and PE ﬁnds that PTSD and depressive
symptoms decrease (30). Steil et al. (2011) developed inpatient
DBT-PTSD for clients with severe PTSD after childhood sexual
abuse. This treatment program of 12 weeks is based on DBT
principles, includes PE as primary trauma-focused intervention
and incorporates elements of Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy and Compassion Focused Therapy (31). In a pilot
(N=29) and RCT (N=74), with a Treatment As Usual (TAU)
waiting list condition, women with and without comorbid BPD
reported signiﬁcant and clinically relevant improvements in PTSD
after inpatient DBT-PTSD (28, 29). Drop-out was low in both RCT

BOX 1

The International Classiﬁcation of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) differentiates between PTSD, complex PTSD and borderline personality disorder. Complex PTSD
includes negative self-concept, relational problems and emotion regulation difﬁculties (2). Although the classiﬁcations complex PTSD and borderline personality disorder
seem to overlap, most studies conclude that they are distinct classiﬁcations (3). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition Text Revision
(DSM-5-TR) classiﬁes PTSD as a single condition (4). Since the mental healthcare system of the Netherlands uses the DSM-5-TR, in this study we deﬁne PTSD and
BPD accordingly.

groups (DBT-PTSD: N=2, 5.5%; Control: N=3, 7.9%). Finally, in an
observational study clients reported more improvement in PTSD
symptoms, dissociation and disturbances in self-organization after
inpatient DBT-PTSD than those treated with an inpatient TAU that
included group interventions and trauma-focused treatment (32).
So far, these results of integrating DBT and PE are promising
for clients with severe PTSD, comorbid BPD and a history of
childhood sexual abuse. At the same time, studies on inpatient
DBT-PTSD are still rather scarce. Replication of the results in
various clinical settings and with a greater variation in PTSD client
populations, regarding gender and a wider variety of trauma
histories, are needed to inform treatment guidelines and clinical
practice. Furthermore, little is known about predictors of treatment.
In general, clients with PTSD and comorbid personality disorders
seem to beneﬁt somewhat less from PTSD treatments (24), but
exploratory analyses showed that comorbid BPD was not predictive
of DBT-PTSD treatment outcome (29). To improve our knowledge
about client characteristics that may predict treatment outcome in
DBT-PTSD, it is important that other personality disorders are also
taken into account. In addition, obtaining a better insight into client
perspectives and experiences with DBT-PTSD may also help
improve this treatment. Finally, we are interested in the economic
impact of DBT-PTSD, because the economic consequences of
childhood trauma in terms of productivity loss and health care
cost are high and increase with greater severity and complexity of
the associated psychopathology (33–35).

The primary aim of this longitudinal, within-subjects study is to
assess the effect of inpatient DBT-PTSD on PTSD severity in clients
with severe PTSD and comorbid disorders. Secondary outcomes are
dissociation, parasuicidal behavior, comorbid BPD symptoms,
social functioning and quality of life. We hypothesize that PTSD,
dissociation, parasuicidal behavior and BPD symptoms will
decrease signiﬁcantly after DBT-PTSD,
in contrast to no
signiﬁcant changes after the waiting list period. Since DBT-PTSD
offers training and therapy beyond trauma-focused treatment, we
hypothesize improvements in quality of life and social as well.
Especially at the six and twelve months follow-up measurements, as
clients were able to pick up their daily lives after leaving the clinic. A
more exploratory aim is to study whether BPD and cluster C
personality disorder symptoms predict the effects of DBT-PTSD
on PTSD symptoms. The fourth objective is to study the cost-
effectiveness of inpatient DBT-PTSD. Finally, we intend to study
clients’ experiences with the treatment program and, more
exploratory, the individual differences in symptom trajectories.

2 Methods

2.1 Study design

The Trauma Therapy Study (TTS) is a naturalistic, longitudinal
study with a within-subjects design. It takes place at GGZ Friesland,
a mental health institute in The Netherlands from January 2019 to
May 2025. Clients referred to inpatient DBT-PTSD are assessed at
the beginning of the waiting list period (T0), at pre (T1) and
posttreatment (T2) and at six (T3) and twelve months (T4) follow-

up (Figure 1). The waiting list period is estimated to be
approximately 12 weeks, based on the year before the start of the
study. It may vary in length depending on the number of referrals to
inpatient DBT-PTSD and unforeseen circumstances. When the
waiting list period exceeds the three months, the baseline
measurements are repeated to create a three months period
between baseline and start of
the intervention. Pre to
posttreatment differences are compared to the control period, the
pre to post waiting list period. During this period clients could
continue any form of TAU to treat PTSD, as this is the case in
everyday clinical practice.

2.2 Procedure

Clients eligible for DBT-PTSD are ﬁrst informed about the study
during the commitment interview. The importance of truly
committing to the treatment is then discussed and afterwards
clients committed to DBT-PTSD are then placed on the waiting
list. Those interested in study participation are sent detailed written
information and receive a follow-up telephone call to provide further
information. Clients are informed that study participation entails
extra questionnaires and interviews, beside the standard diagnostic
procedures and Routine Outcome Measurements (ROM).

During the baseline assessment (T0),

informed consent is
obtained by the research nurse. Interviews are performed by
independent research assistants and clinical psychologists (in
training). The interviewers are trained in the use of the
instruments and regularly attend group intervision meetings to
enhance reliability. Clients complete self-report questionnaires
online. To improve study participation and retention clients can
choose between being interviewed at the mental healthcare facility
of via video call, This is particularly convenient for those living far
away from the treatment center. We also approach clients enrolled
in the TTS who ﬁnished DBT-PTSD in the previous two years and
invite them for a qualitative interview about their experiences.
These interviews are conducted by two clinical psychologists in
training (AK and PV) who are unacquainted with these clients.
Clients give an additional informed consent before starting this
interview. Finally, we use the DBT-PTSD diary data from clients
that started DBT-PTSD between 2019 (when the diary was
digitalized) and December 2023 to study symptom trajectories.
Clients ﬁll in this daily diary as part of the treatment program.

Anonymized ROM assessments of non-participants is used to test
for selection bias, except when clients opted-out and wanted their
data removed from the research database of the mental health
institute. This applies to the anonymized use of diary data of both
participants and non-participants as well. As a standard procedure
at GGZ Friesland, a colleague of the research department who is not
involved in the project oversees the progress of the study. We
followed the SPIRIT writing guidelines (36) and added the SPIRIT
checklist to the submission of this study protocol.

2.4 Participants

Clients aged 18–65 are eligible for inpatient DBT-PTSD if they
meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD and suffer from severe
psychopathology. This includes various comorbid disorders.
Trauma type is not leading in the indication process, but clients
referred to the treatment center have often suffered from severe
interpersonal traumas during childhood. Exclusion criteria

employed by the treatment center are (1) current psychosis; (2)
substance dependence; (3) a body-mass-index < 17 (because of the
sports modules); (4) antisocial personality disorder; (5) war
veterans; (6) clients with a recent severe suicide attempt in the
last two months. Clients capable of comprehending the assessments
are eligible to participate in the study.

2.5 DBT-PTSD

This inpatient, modular DBT-PTSD treatment program of 12
weeks largely follows the original protocol developed by Bohus and
colleagues (28, 29). Table 1 provides an overview of all treatment
modalities. Protocol modiﬁcations include the addition of four
exposure sessions (total 16) and systemic therapy. In general, the
treatment consists of three phases and has both ﬁxed and optional
modules. In phase 1 (weeks 1 - 2) clients identify values they ﬁnd
important in life and goals they wish to work on during and after
ﬁnishing the treatment. They also learn to recognize their avoidance
mechanisms, determine their index trauma and acquire DBT skills.
Trauma-focused therapy is the main focus of phase 2 (weeks 3 - 10).
The individual psychotherapy consists primarily of PE, but has
elements of cognitive therapy as well. Also, therapists can, after
consultation with their client and the treatment team, use EMDR

when that seems appropriate. In the third phase (weeks 11-12) the
objective is to help clients accept trauma-related elements of their
personal history and focus on how they wish to pick-up their daily
lives after ﬁnishing treatment. Enhancing self-acceptance and self-
compassion are integrated throughout the treatment program.

2.6 Measurement instruments

An overview of all measurements is provided in Figure 2 and
shows which measures are part of ROM at the treatment center.
Treatment history is assessed at baseline. At follow-up, we register
treatments that clients received after inpatient DBT-PTSD.

2.6.1 Primary outcome: PTSD

The Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC-5) (37, 38) is a self-report
measure that assesses type of trauma. It consists of 16 traumatic
events that may lead to PTSD. The LEC-5 is administered a as part
of regular diagnostics.

With the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
(CAPS-5) (39, 40) we measure the presence and severity of PTSD.
The CAPS-5 has a range of 0-80 with higher scores indicating more
severe PTSD symptoms. In the last week of treatment the week-
version of the CAPS-5 is standardly used at the treatment Centre to
assess PTSD posttreatment (T2). The CAPS-5 has high interrater
reliability (ICC = .98) and internal consistency (a = .90) for
measuring PTSD severity. Based on considerations expressed by
Larsen et al. (41) and Varker et al. (42), we deﬁne treatment
response as a decrease of ≥9 points (11%) on the CAPS-5,
remission as a CAPS-5 score of <12 and sustained PTSD
remission at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

We use the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) (43) to assess
the self-reported severity of PTSD. This questionnaire consists of 20
items with a 5-point Likert Scale (0-4) and has a range of 0-80. It is
sensitive to measure change in PTSD symptoms and has good
psychometric properties (43, 44).

2.6.2 Dissociation

Dissociative experiences are assessed with the Dissociative
Experience Scale (DES) (45), a self-report questionnaire that
consists of 28 questions (range of 0-100). Items are scored on a
Likert-scale varying from 0% (never) till 100% (all the time).
Reliability and validity have been conﬁrmed (45, 46).

The Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire-20 (SDQ-20) (47, 48)
is a self-report questionnaire that assesses somatoform dissociative
symptoms. Two studies demonstrated convergent and criterion-related
validity and high internal consistency in Dutch samples (47). Third, we
assess the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization)
with two items (range of 0-8) of the CAPS-5.

2.6.3 Borderline and parasuicidal behavior

We use the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Interview
(BPDSI) (49) to determine the severity of borderline personality
disorder during the past three months. The BPDSI is a 70 item
(range 0-90) interview. It has excellent interrater reliability, good
internal consistency (a = 0.85) and excellent concurrent and
construct validity (49). We use the subscale ‘Parasuicidal’ to
assess non-suicidal self-injury and suicidality, because it has good
internal consistency (a = .81) (49).

2.6.4 Comorbid disorders

Comorbid personality disorders are assessed with the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders
(SCID-5-P) (50). The SCID-5-P is a semi-structured DSM-5-
based interview which assesses the presence of personality
disorders. It is supplemented with a screenings questionnaire to
shorten the duration of the interview. Interrater reliability of the
former version was excellent (51).

Comorbid syndrome disorders are assessed with the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Syndrome Disorders (SCID-5-S) (52).
This semi structured interview aims to assess DSM-5 syndrome
disorders. Two studies conﬁrmed the psychometric properties (53, 54).

2.6.5 Social functioning, quality of life and
economic evaluation

To study the effects of DBT-PTSD on social functioning, we use
the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). The WSAS
measures impaired functioning due to a disorder and contains
ﬁve items/domains (work, home management, social
leisure
activities, private leisure activities and maintaining close
relationships). Reliability and validity were demonstrated (56).
We operationalize functional recovery with a score of ≤10 on the
Work and Social Adjustment Scale.

We assess health-related quality of life with the EQ-5D-5L (55),
a self-report questionnaire with excellent psychometric properties
(57). It consists of ﬁve dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each

dimension has ﬁve levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate
problems, severe problems and extreme problems. We will calculate
Quality Adjusted Life Years (Qalys) with the EQ-5D-5L using the
Dutch tariff of Versteegh et al. (58).

The TiC-P is a reliable self-report questionnaire that assesses
healthcare consumption and productivity loss for clients with a
psychiatric disorder (59). The TiC-P has a recall period of three

months and aims to facilitate estimation of direct medical costs and
productivity costs in paid and unpaid work. It is widely used in the
Netherlands for economic evaluations in mental health. The TiC-P
captures for instance duration, intensity and type of (follow-up)
mental health and other treatment in the waiting period, during the
intervention and after discharge, as well as (emergency) admissions
to the hospital, before and after discharge.

2.6.6 Client perspectives and individual
symptom trajectories

With a qualitative semi-structured interview, we study clients’
experiences with DBT-PTSD. With open questions clients are asked
about subjects like, changes they experienced during and after
treatment, factors they perceived as helping or hindering the
treatment process and their suggestions for improvement.
Interviews will take 60 to 90 minutes and will be audiotaped and
afterwards verbatim transcribed.

We use the DBT-PTSD diary to assess symptom trajectories and
the individual differences herein between clients. The DBT diary
was developed and provided by Bohus and colleagues in the Central
Institute for Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany. As part of
treatment, clients keep a digital daily diary during the twelve weeks
of treatment. Items in this diary include among others, PTSD
intrusions, sleep, suicidality, problem behavior, happiness, time
spent on therapeutic assignments and frequency of exposure
assignments. Items vary from nominal, (yes/no), ordinal (5-point
Likert scale) to continuous.

2.6.7 Baseline screening

We use the Screener for Intelligence and Learning disabilities
(SCIL), which is a valid and reliable screening questionnaire
developed to detect an intelligence quotient of ≤ 84, indicated by
a cut-off score of 19 or lower (60). Out of consideration for clients’
wellbeing and the validity of the results, clients are offered to stop
the interviews or complete only part of the measurements when
they have a SCIL score <20, show difﬁculty understanding the
measurements, or seem too distressed.

The datasets of this study will not be publicly available because
information. Access to the dataset is
they contain personal
restricted to project
team members. The processed and
pseudonymized data can be obtained from the principal
investigator upon reasonable request, provided the research
question aligns with the informed consent. Study results will be
published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at
conferences, regardless of the outcomes.

2.8 Sample size calculation

Seven paired-samples t-tests are used to assess short term
within-subjects differences in 1. PTSD severity (measured with
the CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores); 2. BPD severity (measured with
the BPDSI total score and sum score of subscale Parasuicidal of the
BPDSI) and 3. dissociation (measured with the SDQ-20, DES and
sum scores of items 19 and 20 of the CAPS-5). To correct for chance
capitalization as a result of multiple testing we use a conservative
alpha level of 0.01, thereby lowering the chance of a type 1 error. We
choose a power of.80. The minimum needed sample size, based to
detect a medium difference (of 0.5 SDs) between the two paired
scores is N=51 (using G*power) with a=.01 and a power of.80. We
anticipate a minimal dropout of about 10%. This is based on the
smaller drop-out rates in the RCT of Bohus et al. (2013), in
combination with the naturalistic design of the current study
which may involve more drop-out. We compensate for possible
missing values or loss to follow-up by including an extra 10%,
yielding a total sample size of 56 clients.

2.7 Data management

3 Results

Two independent research nurses coordinate data collection.
They are the only ones that have access to client information in
combination to the data. In a separate registration database (a
password protected Excel ﬁle), basic personal data like name, sex,
date of birth, and where applicable, reasons for non-participation or
lost to follow-up of potential participants (i.e. all clients referred to
the trauma center for intake that are interested in participation) is
stored. The registration database supports the planning of all
assessments and is stored on a separate account accessible only to
the research nurses. The registration database includes the key to
the anonymized data. For the analyses, an anonymized dataset is
extracted from the online questionnaire system RoQua (Routine
Outcome and Quality Assessment). Data collected speciﬁcally for
the present study that cannot be stored in the RoQua system, is
stored on separate, anonymized (SPSS, Word and MPEG-4 Audio)
ﬁles. This concerns the treatment history questionnaire and the
qualitative interviews. During data collection and analysis, data ﬁles
are only accessible for the research nurses during data collection.
After terminating data collection, the researchers involved in the
project can access the anonymized data ﬁle. The only exception are
the qualitative interviews, which the interviewing researchers (PV
and AK) can access during the study.

3.1 Quantitative analyses

Data-analyses will be carried out by using the latest version of R
and Rstudio. Analyses will be done on an intention-to-treat basis.
Frequencies and percentages will be given for gender, co-morbid
disorders, trauma type (sexual/physical abuse <12 years, sexual/
physical abuse during adolescence (>12 - <18), sexual/physical
abuse adulthood, other trauma), treatment history (types of
previous treatment) and drop-out. Means, standard deviations,
range and medians will be calculated for age, number of different
traumata experienced in life and treatment history in years. To test
independent two-sided t-tests will be done
for selection bias,
comparing the data of the study sample with regular ROM
measurements (CAPS-5, PCL-5, SDQ-20 and DES) of non-
participants at T0a. For this purpose, a total sample of N=128
(N=64 in each group) is needed with a power of.80 and an
alpha of.05.

3.1.1 Short and long term effects of DBT-PTSD

To study short-term within-subjects differences, change scores
will be calculated with the ﬁrst
three time points (T2-
T1=Dtreatment and T1- T0=Dwaiting-list), resulting in four D-

variables for PTSD, six for dissociation, two for NNSI and suicidal
ideation and two for borderline symptomatology. Two-sided
paired-samples t-tests will be conducted to compare the
Dtreatment and Dwaiting-list scores. We use two-sided tests to
maintain a conservative a level. When the anticipated waiting list
period turns out to be less than three months, we will consider
excluding the participant from the paired t-test analyses. When, at
the end of the study, the waiting list period appears to vary much
more than expected, and we might need to exclude too many
patients, we will consider alternative statistical analyses that are able
to deal with this variability, such as linear mixed model analysis.
Post-hoc analyses to assess long term treatment effects in PTSD,
ideation, and borderline
dissociation, NNSI and suicidal
symptomatology will be carried out with linear mixed model
analyses with time as random effects. We will
include two
predictors of treatment effects on PTSD severity, as measured
with the CAPS-5 and PCL-5 into the PTSD model: 1) baseline
severity of BPD symptoms (using the total score on the BPDSI) and
2) cluster C personality disorders (with the sum of the dimensional
SCID-5-P scores of the three cluster C personality disorders).
Further, we will use linear mixed model analyses to study the
effects of DBT-PTSD on social functioning and quality of life
over time.

3.1.2 Symptom trajectories with diary data

Finally, as more explorative objectives, we intend to study
symptom trajectories on a group and individual level with the
diary data. We will use linear mixed model analyses and graphs to
show symptom trajectories over time with PTSD intrusive
symptoms, emotion dysregulation behaviors (non-suicidal self-
injury, high risk behavior, binge eating or self-induced vomiting,
alcohol use, drugs/medication use, anger, other problem behavior),
suicidality, hours of sleep, happiness and undertaking pleasant
activities. Linear mixed model analyses are capable of handling
missing data, even when a substantial part of the data is missing. We
hypothesize that when PTSD symptoms decrease, improvements on
the other variables will follow. To test this hypothesis, we will
include PTSD symptoms as a time-varying covariate with a two
week lag in our linear mixed models.

Second, we study the degree to which clients invest in their
‘time
treatment, operationalized by the DBT-PTSD diary items:
spent on therapeutic assignments’ (in minutes) and ‘exposure
assignments carried out’ (yes/no), as predictors of treatment
outcome. We will use the CAPS-5 and PTSD symptoms of the
diary to measure change in PTSD symptoms and the diaries
emotion dysregulation behavior items for emotion dysregulation.
We hypothesize that clients who are motivated and invest in their
treatment, by doing more exposure assignments and spending more
time on therapeutic assignments, will beneﬁt more from DBT-
PTSD. To test this hypothesis, we will split the sample in half to
compare clients with the highest and lowest scores on homework
and exposure assignments during the ﬁrst four weeks and over the
whole course of treatment. We will again use linear mixed model
analyses with a time x group interaction in our model.

3.2 Handling missing data

To thoroughly analyze missing data we will use a combination of
graphic inspection with missing data matrix plots and bar charts,
calculate frequencies and percentages of missing data for each
variable at every time point and use the Little’s test (61). This will
enable us to determine the extent of the missingness in our dataset
and its nature (missing completely at random or more systematic).
In our estimation of possible patterns we will take all the available
information into account, like the detailed records that are kept of
individual participants during data collection, the COVID-19
pandemic, symptom severity, etc. We intend to use multiple
imputation, if this is indeed the most optimal method to handle
missing data in our study. Multiple imputation is statistically the
most accurate way of dealing with missing data (62). The results of
the analyses in 20 imputed datasets will be pooled. We will only
delete cases from the analyses when there is too much data (≥50%)
missing for multiple imputation. For the linear mixed model
analyses we will use the original, unimputed dataset, because these
statistical analyses can deal with missing values. The information
about missing data in the study will be reported in detail, using the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) statement for observational studies (63).

3.3 Economic evaluation of DBT-PTSD

We will perform a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis from
a societal perspective. We calculate healthcare costs and productivity
loss over the past three months (measured with the Tic-P), using
standard unit cost units as described in the Zorginstituut Nederland
(ZiN) guidelines (64). Outcomes consist of PTSD severity (measured
with the CAPS-5) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY’s), which
will result in two Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs):
additional costs for one point improvement in PTSD severity and
additional costs per Qaly. Parallel to the analysis of effectiveness, in
the cost-effectiveness analysis we also compare within-subjects:
intervention versus waiting list. To obtain an estimate on longer-
term cost-effectiveness, costs and effects of inpatient DBT-PTSD will
be extrapolated from the six and twelve month follow-up data to a
ﬁve year outcome, using four different scenario’s to gain insight into
the upper and lower limits of the actual cost-effectiveness: 1) Care
consumption and PTSD severity will remain what they were during
the last six months follow-up; 2) Care consumption and PTSD
severity are (back) at baseline levels immediately after the end of 1
year follow-up (pessimistic); 3) Care consumption and PTSD severity
will gradually decrease after the follow-up has ended, with 25% in
total over ﬁve years (optimistic); 4) Care consumption and PTSD
severity will gradually increase again (after initial reduction) after the
follow-up ends, until the baseline levels are reached, linear in ﬁve
years (moderately pessimistic). Bootstrapping and cost-effectiveness
acceptability curves (CEAC) will be used to quantify the uncertainty
around the ICERs. We will use the CHEERS 2022 statement in
reporting our outcomes (65).

3.4 Qualitative analysis

A qualitative study will be conducted to better understand clients’
(short- and long-term) experiences with inpatient DBT-PTSD. We
include clients in this part of the study, based on maximum variation
sampling (age, gender, region of residence, treatment year) and
expect to reach data saturation with approximately 15 participants.
We will carry out a phenomenological reﬂective life world approach
as described by van der Meide (2014) (66). Interviews are audiotaped
and later verbatim transcribed. The ﬁrst four interviews are
transcribed by a researcher (PV) and the remaining by two
independent (reintegrating) colleagues of the mental health facility.
As it is an iterative process, analysis starts immediately after the ﬁrst
round of interviews. The supervising researcher (MA), specialized in
qualitative interviews, and the two interviewing researchers (AK and
PV) will be involved in the analyses. We follow the four phases of
the reﬂective life world approach as described by Van der Meide
(2014). The ﬁrst phase consists of re-reading and exploring the
interview data. Secondly, we will identify different units of meaning
(coding). The supervisor and the researcher will code the ﬁrst three
interviews independently. An inductive coding approach will be used
to categorize the variety of clients’ experiences. Throughout the data
collection and analysis, codes and clusters are open for re-
examination to get closer to the concepts and experiences targeted
by this study. After the ﬁrst round of manual coding, transcripts
will be coded further using Atlas.ti 24 (67). Third, we will cluster
the meaningful units that are related. As a fourth step, we will
formulate the essence of the phenomenon that is being studied.
To enhance the quality of the study, the analysis of the ﬁrst six
interviews will be discussed in a supervision group of qualitative
researchers. Additionally, peer-debrieﬁng with an afﬁliated researcher
(MA) will be utilized to overcome potential inaccurate assumptions
or biases. We will use the COREQ guidelines throughout the process
of reporting (68).

4 Discussion

This paper describes the design of a naturalistic study aimed at
examining short and long term effects of inpatient DBT-PTSD. It
will provide information about the effects on PTSD, dissociation,
parasuicidal behavior, borderline symptomatology, social
functioning, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. It
is the ﬁrst study that includes both the severity of BPD and cluster C
personality disorders as predictors of treatment effects. Another
novel aspect is the qualitative study of clients experiences with
DBT-PTSD. Finally, the use of diary data will show individual
symptom trajectories and whether clients’ investment into their
treatment in terms of homework predicts their treatment results.
The ﬁrst studies on DBT combined with trauma-focused
treatment, with varying designs and sample sizes, have shown
promising results in clients with severe PTSD, emotion regulation
problems and comorbid BPD (30). First, pilot studies and a
naturalistic study on outpatient DBT with PE indicate that PTSD
symptoms, suicidality, self-injurious behavior and social

functioning improve in women with PTSD and BPD (69–71). In
an RCT, outpatient Cognitive Processing Therapy and outpatient
DBT-PTSD were both effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in
women with a history of childhood abuse (72). DBT-PTSD led to
greater remission and recovery rates and less drop-out compared to
Cognitive Processing Therapy (respectively 25.5% vs. 39.0%). The
inpatient variant of DBT-PTSD has a shorter, intensive treatment
program. Compared to a waiting list group in which TAU was
continued DBT-PTSD was effective in reducing PTSD symptoms
(29). In an observational study DBT-PTSD outperformed an
inpatient treatment that included trauma-focused treatment on
PTSD, dissociation and disturbances in self-organization (32).

Replication of these results in mental healthcare settings beyond
those of the original developers is essential to inform treatment
guidelines. Also, information about treatment predictors (beside
BPD), symptom trajectories, cost-effectiveness and clients’
experiences with DBT-PTSD is currently limited or absent. The
present study addresses these knowledge gaps and extends the
evidence base for a broader client group (both men and women)
with severe PTSD and comorbid (personality) symptoms with a
more varied trauma history. Adjacent to this, we intend to increase
knowledge of both borderline and cluster C personality disorder
symptoms as predictors of inpatient DBT-PTSD outcomes.
Comorbid personality disorders negatively impact PTSD
treatment outcomes compared to outcomes of clients without
comorbid personality disorders, as was shown in a recent meta-
analysis (24). On the other hand, comorbid BPD was not predictive
of treatment outcome in an RCT on inpatient DBT-PTSD (29). As
an additional objective, next to symptomatic improvement, we
study the short and long term treatment effects on social
functioning and quality of life. The results of Bosch et al. (2020),
who studied the effect of Cognitive Processing Therapy in PTSD
clients with early trauma, suggests that symptom reduction does not
automatically lead to improvement of quality of life. Further, to our
knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to gain insight into symptom
trajectories and clients’ experiences with DBT-PTSD, by using daily
diaries and qualitative interviews. Finally, as a 12-week inpatient
treatment is costly, it seems highly relevant to study its incremental
cost-effectiveness on PTSD severity and cost-utility in terms of
QALYs, compared to outpatient TAU.

4.1 Strengths and limitations

Ideally, we would have conducted an RCT and compare DBT-
PTSD with an alternative evidence based PTSD treatment, as this is
considered the golden standard. However, a pilot with ten clients
showed that once referred, all refused randomization to either
inpatient DBT-PTSD or an intensive inpatient treatment of eight
days at another location in the Netherlands. A preference trial turned
out not feasible either. Apparently, once referred to a treatment
program, clients are focused on and prepared by their referrers to
start with this particular treatment. Furthermore, as clients are
referred to DBT-PTSD by a large number of organizations and
general practitioners located throughout the Netherlands, it was
not possible to randomize at an earlier stage. Finally, comparing

Frontiers in Psychiatry

Kamstra et al.

10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1538267

DBT-PTSD to a waiting list control group was considered unethical
by the local medical ethical committee, because one group of clients
would have waited longer for treatment.

The lack of control for possible confounding variables is of course
a limitation. However, by including measurements before and after
the waiting list period, clients may serve as their own control.
Moreover, most clients referred to inpatient DBT-PTSD have a
history of (severe) childhood traumatization and suffered from
PTSD and other symptoms for a long period of time. Hence, it
seems unlikely that their symptoms would signiﬁcantly improve
during a waiting list period. On the other hand, clients are free to
continue or start any other treatment or counselling during the
waiting list period. In our naturalistic study design we cannot rule out
TAU treatment effects in our waiting list control period. Another
limitation is that we cannot be certain that other factors than DBT-
PTSD inﬂuence the six and twelve-months follow-up measurements
of symptoms, social functioning and quality of life. To gain some
insight in this, we gather data about treatments between
posttreatment and the follow-up measurements. A ﬁnal limitation
to consider is that the CAPS-5 measures PTSD related to one index
trauma. Clients referred to the DBP-PTSD program have often
experienced multiple traumas. During the repeated measures with
the CAPS-5, the interviewers will refer to the index trauma at T0. This
may bias the results in overestimating treatment success. However,
besides the CAPS, we use the PCL-5 and the DBT-PTSD diary and
both measure PTSD symptoms irrespective of trauma experiences.

Our within-subject observational design has several advantages.
First, it allows us to study the short and long-term effects and individual
treatment trajectories of clients with severe PTSD and co-morbid
symptoms, including those with non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal
thoughts, in a naturalistic setting. Second, all clients that are considered
eligible for DBT-PTSD by de staff of the treatment center can
participate in the study. The absence of exclusion criteria enlarges
the generalizability of the results. Third, it is a pragmatic study, in the
sense that clinicians and clients are free to design a personal treatment
plan in which they choose optional modules they consider helpful in
achieving clients’ personal goals. This way, study results reﬂect DBT-
PTSD treatment as it is given in everyday clinical practice.
Furthermore, the study is carried out by researchers who were not
involved in the design of the treatment program, which enhances the
objective evaluation and generalizability of DBT-PTSD. Finally, the
qualitative study may lead to important insights into client perspectives
on treatment effects and helpful ingredients of DBT-PTSD.

4.2 Conclusion

In conclusion, the Trauma Therapy Study aims to extend the
evidence base of inpatient DBT-PTSD for clients with severe PTSD and
co-morbid psychiatric symptoms as a consequence of a traumatic
history in a day-to-day healthcare setting. Beside extending nomothetic
knowledge, (group level knowledge), idiographic knowledge is gained
by including qualitative interviews and diary data. Perspectives of
clients who participated in DBT-PTSD can inspire improvements to
the treatment program. Insight into individual symptom trajectories

may inform clinicians to adjust future treatments more timely.
Growing evidence of effective treatments for this client group and
knowledge of prognostic factors, gives both clients and involved
clinicians the opportunity to choose the most appropriate treatment
through shared decision-making (73).
