Abstract

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify associations between overall
and subtypes of CM, global/trait resilience, and five resilience domains (coping, self-esteem,
emotion regulation, self-efficacy, and well-being) in adults, and to examine moderators and
mediators of these associations. A systematic search was undertaken on 12 June 2024 to
identify published peer-reviewed articles in five databases (PROSPERO-CRD42023394120).
Of 15,262 records, 203 studies were included, comprising 145,317 adults (Mage = 29.62 years;
34.96% males); 183 studies and 557 effect sizes were pooled in random-effect meta-analyses.
Overall CM and its subtypes were negatively associated with global/trait resilience and its
domains (r = (cid:1)0.081 to (cid:1)0.330). Emotional abuse/neglect showed the largest magnitude of
effect (r = (cid:1)0.213 to (cid:1)0.321). There was no meta-analytic evidence for an association between
sexual abuse and coping, and physical abuse/neglect and self-esteem. Meta-regressions
identified age, sample size, and study quality as moderators. Subgroup analyses found that
associations between emotional abuse and emotion regulation were stronger, while associ-
ations between emotional abuse and self-esteem were weaker, in western versus non-western
countries. No differences were found in associations between CM and resilience in clinical
versus non-clinical samples. Narrative synthesis identified several mediators. Associations
were of small magnitude and there were a limited number of studies, especially studies
assessing CM subtypes, such as physical neglect, bullying, or domestic violence, and resilience
domains, such as coping or self-efficacy, in males, and clinical samples. CM exposure
negatively impacts resilience in adults, an effect observed across multiple maltreatment types
and resilience domains. Interventions focused on resilience in adults with CM histories are
needed to improve health and psychosocial outcomes.

Highlights
(cid:129) Being exposed to CM, especially emotional abuse and emotional neglect is associated with

impaired resilience in adults.

(cid:129) Age, sample size, study quality, and country/region moderate the association between CM

(cid:129)

and resilience.
Self-compassion, self-concept, emotional intelligence, social support, parental/peer relation-
ship quality, attachment style, PTSD, and mood symptoms mediate the association between
CM and resilience outcomes.

Introduction

Child maltreatment (CM), that is, sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, and physical and
emotional neglect, including witnessing domestic violence and bullying exposure under
18 years of age (Cowley et al., 2025; Fares-Otero & Seedat, 2024), is one of the most potent
and preventable risk factors for the development of physical and mental illnesses throughout
the lifespan (Baldwin et al., 2023; Mehta et al., 2023) and is further associated with a multitude

of negative psychosocial outcomes in both clinical (Fares-Otero,
Alameda et al., 2023; Fares-Otero, De Prisco et al., 2023) and non-
clinical populations (Pfaltz et al., 2022). However, outcomes of
CM vary widely, and not all individuals exposed to CM experi-
ence the same level or range of negative health issues or psycho-
social consequences. This suggests resiliency in some individuals
exposed to CM.

Resilience is the capacity of an individual to adapt successfully to
highly adverse events and, by harnessing resources, maintain healthy
functioning (Southwick et al., 2014). Resilience can be defined as a
personal characteristic (or trait) captured by personal and psycho-
social resources, and it can also be perceived as a process comprising
bouncing back and growth (Ayed, Toner, & Priebe, 2019). Resilience
may also enhance perceptions about one’s personal qualities, such as
self-confidence, adaptability, and the ability to endure stress (Choi
et al., 2019). As a dynamic system (Liu & Duan, 2023), resilience
refers to the ability to function competently and face future challenges
or adversities successfully, and can thus be regarded as both the
process of returning to pre-exposure health and well-being and an
outcome of one’s reaction to a stressful event (Bhatnagar, 2021).

To date, previous systematic reviews have reported on factors
that promote adaptive functioning and positive mental health (Fritz
et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2018) but were not able to draw firm
conclusions on resilience factors contributing to improved psycho-
social outcomes in adults with CM (Latham, Newbury, & Fisher,
2023). One meta-analysis examined associations between violence
exposure and protective factors for resilience in children, showing
that self-regulation and social support demonstrated significant
additive and/or buffering effects in longitudinal studies (Yule,
Houston, & Grych, 2019). A multivariate meta-analysis found that
trait resilience mediated the association between childhood trauma
and depression (Watters, Aloe, & Wojciak, 2023). An umbrella
synthesis of meta-analyses on CM antecedents and interventions
found that resilient individuals were characterised by lower sus-
ceptibility to changes in the environment and that these associ-
ations between resilience and susceptibility were moderated by
constitutional (e.g. easy temperament) and contextual protective
factors (e.g. parent intervention) (van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-
Kranenburg, Coughlan, & Reijman, 2020).

Although the association between CM and resilience has been
widely recognised, available reviews (Fritz et al., 2018; Latham et al.,
2023; Meng et al., 2018) and meta-analyses (van IJzendoorn et al., 2020;
Watters et al., 2023; Yule et al., 2019) have focused on broader concepts
of childhood adversity and protective factors that promote resilience. It
remains unclear whether CM and its specific subtypes are differentially
associated with resilience in adulthood using a multi-domain definition
and approach for resilience (Fares-Otero, O et al., 2023). Furthermore,
analyses of potential moderating (e.g. age, sex, mental condition) or
mediating factors (e.g. personality, mood symptoms) in the association
between CM and resilience have seldom been undertaken.

This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to address
these gaps by determining whether overall CM and its subtypes
are associated with global/trait resilience and distinct resilience
domains (coping, self-esteem, emotion regulation, self-efficacy,
and well-being) in adults. The review also explored potential mod-
erators that may modify the strength and/or direction of the
association between CM and resilience, and mediators that may
explain the association. Understanding CM-resilience associations
can guide clinical decision-making or policy development. Collect-
ively, this information can inform clinical practice guidelines and
strategies for improving prediction, early identification, and tar-
geted interventions.

Methods

Protocol

The study protocol was
registered on PROSPERO (CRD4
2023394120) and published elsewhere (Fares-Otero, O et al.,
2023) before the completion of the study. This review follows the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) (Moher et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021) (see
ST1 and ST2 in the Supplement), the Meta-Analysis of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE; Stroup et al., 2000) check-
list (see ST3 in the Supplement), and the Enhancing the Quality and
Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) (Altman et al., 2008)
reporting guidelines. For a comprehensive glossary of terms used in
this work, see SA1 in the Supplement.

Search strategy and selection criteria

A systematic search using multiple medical subject headings
(MeSH), terms, and keywords related to (1) ‘childhood maltreat-
ment’ and ‘resilience’ (domains) using the Boolean operator ‘AND’
adapted according to database thesauruses (see the search strategies
and terms appended in SA2 in the Supplement) was implemented
on PubMed (Medline), PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, and Web of
Science (core collection) to identify relevant studies on 18 April
2023 and updated on 12 June 2024. No language or date limits were
applied. To identify additional eligible studies, references of studies
of relevance were cross-referenced manually. This backward and
forward citation searching was carried out in PubMed and Google
Scholar (NEF-O).

Four independent reviewers (NEF-O, JC-N, JSW, GS) screened
the titles and abstracts according to the pre-specified eligibility
criteria and discrepancies were resolved through consensus. Art-
icles, that appeared eligible from the abstract, or were of unclear
eligibility, were full-text screened (NEF-O, JC-N, JSW, GS). Any
disagreements over study eligibility were discussed and an inde-
pendent senior researcher (SS) was consulted if a consensus could
not be reached among the reviewers. Rayyan QCRI software
(https://rayyan.qcri.org/) was used to manage citations, remove
duplicates, and screen titles and abstracts.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Only original research articles published in peer-reviewed journals
were included. Eligible studies reported quantitative associations
between at least one CM subtype (exposure variable; i.e. sexual,
physical, or emotional abuse; physical or emotional neglect, domes-
tic violence, bullying) and at least one resilience domain (outcome
variable; i.e. global/trait resilience, coping, self-esteem, emotion
regulation, self-efficacy, well-being) in adults (see the definition
and operationalisation of exposure and outcome variables in SA3 in
the Supplement). When more than one published study used the
same subjects and outcomes, the study with the larger sample size
was chosen to maximise power.

Studies were excluded if they: (1) were reviews, meta-analyses,
clinical case studies, abstracts, conference proceedings, study proto-
cols, letters to the editor not reporting original data, editorials,
commentaries, theoretical pieces, books, book chapters, preprints,
theses, or grey literature; (2) only included children and/or adoles-
cents; (3) were studies that exclusively assessed trauma experienced
in adulthood (≥ 18 years); (4) were qualitative studies; (5) aimed to
conduct or evaluate an intervention and/or to assess treatment
outcomes and did not provide baseline data.

According to the PECOS (Population, Exposure, Comparator,
Outcomes, Study design) framework (Morgan, Whaley, Thayer, &
Schünemann, 2018), studies were included if they: (1) (P) were
conducted on human adults (≥ 18 years) with or without current/
past mental or any medical condition and who were exposed to CM;
(2) (E) assessed the presence of CM (< 18 years) and measured
overall (total) or specific CM subtypes with validated measures or
through clinical interviews/reports; (3) (C) compared individuals
with and without CM within the same sample; (4) (O) evaluated
resilience with validated instruments; (5) quantitatively examined
and reported associations between CM and resilience or data that
allowed correlations to be calculated or provided these data on
request; (6) (S) were cross-sectional, or longitudinal (providing
baseline data).

and updated search (JN-C, JSW, AS, IS, and GS) using a modified
version of the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for non-randomised
studies as used in previous meta-analyses in the field (Fares-Otero,
Alameda et al., 2023; Fares-Otero, De Prisco et al., 2023). When
using the NOS, studies are rated depending on sample selection,
comparability of groups, and assessment of exposure or outcome,
items to assess
and the adapted version contains additional
sample size, confounders, and statistical tests as recommended
by the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins et al., 2011) (see ST5 in the
Supplement).

Any disagreements over data extraction and/or study quality
were discussed, and the lead researcher (NEF-O) was consulted if a
consensus could not be reached, with discrepancies resolved
through general consensus.

Study outcomes

Statistical analysis

The selection of resilience (outcome) domains was based on resili-
ence outcomes examined in the included studies, and categorisations
used in the trauma and resilience research fields (Rutten et al., 2013;
Southwick et al., 2014). After study selection, we categorised the
study outcomes into: (I) Global or trait resilience: conceived as a
relatively stable, personal innate characteristic that is marked by
psychological hardiness, and ego resilience (Connor & Davidson,
2003); and (II) Five separate domains of resilience, including: (1)
Coping: conscious, volitional efforts to regulate emotion, cognition,
behaviour, physiology, and the environment in response to stress
(Bonanno, Romero, & Klein, 2015; Bonanno, Westphal, & Mancini,
2011); (2) Self-esteem: one’s overall sense of self-worth or personal
value that represents a comprehensive evaluation of oneself, includ-
ing positive and negative evaluations (Brown, Dutton, & Cook,
2001); (3) Emotion regulation: the process by which individuals
influence the occurrence, timing, nature, experience, and expression
of their emotions (Kok, 2020); (4) Self-efficacy: sense of perceived
self-efficacy to cope with daily hassles and stresses and adapt after
experiencing all kinds of stressful life events, including a person’s
belief in their ability to complete a task or achieve a goal (Bandura,
1982); (5) Well-being: biological and psychological qualities of well-
being and mental health that enable successful adaptation or swift
recovery from life adversity, such as optimism, a sense of coherence,
the experience of positive emotions, having a purpose in life, and a
sense of mastery (Ruggeri et al., 2020; Rutten et al., 2013).

Appendix SA4 in the Supplement provides a complete definition
and operationalisation of each outcome domain and ST4 provides a
complete overview of assessments of each outcome domain.

Data extraction and study quality assessment

Data from eligible studies were extracted and tracked in Microsoft
Excel by two groups of independent reviewers in the initial (NEF-O,
JC-N, JSW, and GS) and updated search (NEF-O, JC-N, JSW, AS,
and GS) using a structured coding form.

Descriptive variables extracted comprised demographics, and
measurement instruments for CM, and resilience domains (see a
detailed description of the extracted variables in SA3 in the Sup-
plement). Correlation coefficients (r) were extracted as measures of
effect size index. If not reported in the original publication, infor-
mation was calculated from available statistics using established
formulas (Lenhard & Lenhard, 2017; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) or was
requested from the authors.

The included studies were assessed for study quality by two
groups of independent reviewers for the initial (JN-C, JSW, and GS)

Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted when a minimum of
five studies (Jackson & Turner, 2017) were available. If the number of
available effect sizes did not allow random effects meta-analysis, study
findings were summarised and appraised qualitatively in a narrative
synthesis (Popay et al., 2006). For those studies not reporting correl-
ation coefficients, information was transformed from available statis-
tics (e.g. mean and standard deviations between groups comparisons,
regression coefficients) (Lenhard & Lenhard, 2017). Pearson correl-
ation coefficients (effect sizes) were Fisher’s Z transformed to stabilise
the variance and calculate reliable confidence intervals (CIs) and back
transformed after pooling to allow for clearer interpretation, as per
procedures used in previous meta-analyses (Fares-Otero, Alameda
et al., 2023; Fares-Otero, De Prisco et al., 2023). Thus, all pooled effects
were reported as correlation coefficients.

For the studies conducting separate analyses for emotion regu-
lation subscales (i.e. acceptance, refocus on planning, positive
reappraisal, expressive suppression, rumination, and experiential
avoidance) (Güler, Demir, & Yurtseven, 2024; Mohammadpanah
Ardakan, Khosravani, Kamali, & Dabiri, 2024; Musella et al., 2024;
Peng et al., 2021; Sistad, Simons, Mojallal, & Simons, 2021), results
were pooled using correction estimates (Olkin & Pratt, 1958) before
inclusion in the meta-analysis.

The heterogeneity of effect estimates was investigated using
Cochran’s Q-test and I2 statistics (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, &
Altman, 2003). The between-study variance of the underlying
distribution of true effect sizes were reported using the tau square
(τ2) statistic. Alongside the 95% CIs and the mean pooled effect
provided, the prediction intervals estimating the extent to which
effect sizes vary across studies (Borenstein, 2022b) were displayed
as part of the forest plots (marked in red).

Additionally, the heterogeneity and content of studies were
qualitatively described and possible reasons for the variability were
considered by analysing the characteristics of the studies included.
Meta-regressions for pre-defined continuous variables were con-
ducted, including age (mean years), sex (% males), and the influ-
ence of sample size and study quality (NOS rating). Individual
subgroup analyses were conducted for categorical variables, that
is, western (EU and Scandinavian countries, the United Kingdom,
Iceland, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand)
versus non-western countries (Asia, Africa, Latin America, Eastern
Europe, Middle East), clinical samples (the presence of any diag-
nosis of mental disorders, according to DSM (Bell, 1994; Kübler,
2013) or ICD (World Health Organisation, 2019) criteria, versus
non-clinical samples (subjects recruited from the community and
who were not diagnosed with a disorder). Subgroup analyses used a

4

mixed-effects model (a random-effects model within subgroups
and a fixed-effect model across subgroups). Other evidence of
confounders and effect moderators and mediators on associations
between CM and resilience outcomes was narratively synthesised
(Popay et al., 2006).

One-study-removed sensitivity analyses were conducted to
determine whether a particular study or a set of studies were
contributing to potential heterogeneity and to determine the
robustness of the meta-analyses (Higgins & Thompson, 2004).

For any meta-analysis with ≥10 studies, funnel plot asymmetry
(Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997) was visually evaluated
and possible explanations for the asymmetry were considered
(small-study effects, publication bias). Publication bias was also
assessed and quantified by Egger’s linear regression asymmetry test
(Sterne, Gavaghan, & Egger, 2000). Given that these tests might be
underpowered if only a small number of studies are available, the
non-parametric trim-and-fill method (Duval & Tweedie, 2000) was
used to examine the extent to which publication bias may contrib-
ute to the meta-analysis results if the search yielded few studies.
Risk of bias analyses used a random-effects model, while a fixed-
effect model was used to determine missing studies.

Statistical significance was evaluated two-sided at the 5% thresh-
old (two-tailed). Interpretation of correlation coefficients was based
on pre-defined cut-offs as follows: r values between 0 and 0.3
indicate small, values between 0.3 and 0.7 indicate moderate, and
values above 0.7 indicate strong associations (Ratner, 2009).

Results

Study selection

The total sample of the included studies comprised 145,317
(range = 30–25,113) adults, of which 34.96% were males. The mean
age was 29.62 (range = 18.25–72.24) years. Of the 2023 included
studies, 78 (38.42%) studies were carried out in clinical samples, of
which 55 (27.09%) reported the presence of any diagnosis of mental
disorders according to DSM (Bell, 1994; Kübler, 2013) or ICD
(World Health Organisation, 2019) criteria. Three (1.48%) studies
were conducted in samples with physical conditions (Artime &
Peterson, 2012; Crosta et al., 2018; Kızılkurt, Demirkan, Gıynaş, &
Güleç, 2021).

Overall CM was examined in 122 (60.09%) of the included
studies, while 91 (44.83%) studies examined emotional abuse,
89 (43.84%) studies examined physical abuse, 97 (47.78%) studies
examined sexual abuse, 66 studies (32.51%) examined emotional
neglect, while 53 (26.11%) studies examined physical neglect.
Bullying (or peer victimisation) was examined in 13 (6.40%) stud-
ies, and domestic violence exposure was examined in 11 (5.42%)
studies.

Most of the included studies included retrospective assessments
of CM. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) short-form
(28 items) was used in 141 (69.46%) studies, including shortened
(25 items) or translated versions; while structured clinical inter-
views were used in seven (3.45%) studies and official case record
reviews were used in three (1.48%) studies.

Forty-eight (23.65%) studies controlled for confounders in their
analysis with a wide range of confounders being considered, includ-
ing sex/gender, age, race/ethnicity, household characteristics,
health measures, additional traumas, substance abuse, and mood
symptoms. See further descriptive characteristics of the included
studies in Table 1.

Among the 203 studies reviewed, 20 studies were only included in
the systematic review. For a description and qualitative synthesis of the
main results of CM and resilience domain associations that provided
insufficient data for meta-analyses, see SA7 in the Supplement.

From 15,262 identified records (15,240 through databases and
22 studies through manual searches), 482 were full-text screened,
and 203 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, of which
183 were included in the quantitative synthesis, contributing to
557 effect sizes pooled in meta-analyses (see the process of study
selection in detail in Figure 1, the full list of included studies in SA5,
and the full list of excluded studies with reasons in SA6 in the
Supplement).

Study quality
The mean quality rating (range = 0–8) of the included studies was
5.48 (range = 4–8). Overall, 52 (25.62%) studies were rated as ‘poor’
(NOS score = 3 or 4), 55 (27.09%) studies were rated as ‘fair’ (NOS
score = 5), 45 (22.17%) studies were rated as ‘good’ (NOS score = 6),
and 51 (25.12%) studies received a rating considered as ‘high’ (NOS
score > 6) (see further details of the study quality assessment in ST5
in the Supplement).

Characteristics of the included studies

The 203 included studies were published between 1994 and 2024 and
were conducted in North America (n = 64), Asia (n = 45), Europe
(n = 39), Turkey (n = 22), Middle East (n = 14), Oceania (n = 5), Latin
America (n = 4), and Africa (n = 1), with a total of 101 (49.75%)
studies conducted in western-countries, 93 (45.81%) studies con-
ducted in non-western countries, and nine studies conducted in
multiple countries/regions.

Most of the included studies were cross-sectional, except for
15 (7.39%) studies (Armitage et al., 2021; Billen et al., 2023; Chen,
Shen, & Dai, 2021; Daniels et al., 2012; Dereboy, Sahin Demirkapi,
Sakiroglu, & Safak Ozturk, 2018; ElBarazi, 2023; Guo et al., 2023;
Herrenkohl et al., 2012; Jones, Marsland, & Gianaros, 2023; Kong,
Homan, & Goldberg, 2024; Kumar et al., 2022; S. Liu et al., 2023;
Martin et al., 2023; Salles et al., 2024; Sexton et al., 2015) with a
longitudinal design.

Meta-analytic results of associations between CM and resilience
in adulthood

Separate meta-analyses with random-effects estimates were calcu-
lated to quantify associations between CM, separated by overall and
subtypes, global/trait resilience (n = 90, k = 98), and five resilience
domains: (1) Coping (n = 23, k = 26), (2) Self-esteem (n = 133, k =
154), (3) Emotion regulation (n = 192, k = 192), (4) Self-efficacy (n =
34, k = 34), and (5) Well-being (n = 52, k = 53). The main results are
presented in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 2. Forest plots of each
analysis can be found in SF1 in the Supplement.

Global/trait resilience
Overall CM and all subtypes were negatively associated with global/
trait resilience (r = (cid:1)0.091 to (cid:1)0.305; p = .002 to <.001). Emotional
neglect showed the largest magnitude of effect (n = 12, k = 13, r =
(cid:1)0.305, p < .001).

Figure 2. Overall results of the meta-analytic synthesis.

Resilience domains
Coping Overall CM (n = 9, k = 10; r = (cid:1)0.156, p = .018) and
physical abuse (n = 6, k = 7; r = (cid:1)0.143, p = .003) were negatively
associated with coping but unrelated to sexual abuse.

Self-esteem Overall CM and most subtypes were negatively asso-
ciated with self-esteem (r = (cid:1)0.110 to (cid:1)0.303, p < .001), except for
physical abuse and physical neglect. Emotional abuse showed the
largest magnitude of effect (n = 21, k = 24; r = (cid:1)0.303, p < .001).

Emotion regulation Overall CM and all subtypes were negatively
associated with emotion regulation (r = (cid:1)0.150 to (cid:1)0.272, p < .001).
Emotional abuse (n = 38, k = 38; r = (cid:1)0.272, p < .001) and emotional
neglect showed the largest magnitude of effect (n = 24, k = 24; r =
(cid:1)0.272, p < .001).

Self-efficacy Overall CM and all subtypes were negatively associ-
ated with self-efficacy (r = (cid:1)0.081 to (cid:1)0.330, p = 0.048 to < .001).
Emotional neglect showed the largest magnitude of effect (n = 5, k =
5; r = (cid:1)0.321, p < .001).

Well-being Overall CM and all subtypes were negatively associ-
ated with well-being (r = (cid:1)0.142 to (cid:1)0.310, p < .001). Emotional
neglect showed the largest magnitude of effect (n = 6, k = 6; r =
(cid:1)0.310, p < .001).

Heterogeneity, meta-regressions

Of the 33 meta-analyses completed, heterogeneity was high for
most results (see results on heterogeneity in Table 2).

Meta-regressions were conducted by overall CM and CM sub-
types. The following continuous variables were explored: (1) mean
age; (2) proportion of males; (3) sample size; and (4) study quality
(NOS score).

Global/ trait resilience
The magnitude of the association between sexual abuse and global/
trait resilience decreased with sample size (n = 12, k = 12, B = (cid:1)0.000,

95% CI [(cid:1)0.021; 0.002], p = 0.018) and increased with study quality
(n = 12, k = 12, B = 0.161, 95% CI [0.073; 0.249], p < 0.001).

Resilience domains
Coping: the magnitude of the association between overall CM and
coping increased with sample size (n = 7, k = 7, B = 0.001, 95% CI
[0.000; 0.001], p < 0.001) and decreased with age (n = 7, k = 7, B =
(cid:1)0.001, 95% CI [(cid:1)0.000; (cid:1)0.000], p = 0.003) and study quality (n =
7, k = 7, B = (cid:1)0.091, 95% CI [(cid:1)0.164; (cid:1)0.018], p = 0.014). The
association between physical abuse and coping decreased with age
(n = 7, k = 7, B = (cid:1)0.000, 95% CI [(cid:1)0.000; (cid:1)0.000], p = 0.002).

Emotion regulation: the association between sexual abuse and
emotion regulation decreased with study quality (n = 33, k = 33, B =
(cid:1)0.034, 95% CI [(cid:1)0.063; 0.005], p = 0.021). The association between
emotional neglect and emotion regulation increased with age (n = 20, k
= 20, B = 0.014, 95% CI [0.005; (cid:1)0.022], p = 0.002) and sample size (n
= 20, k = 20, B = (cid:1)0.000, 95% CI [(cid:1)0.000; (cid:1)0.000], p = 0.003). The
association between physical neglect and emotion regulation increased
with age (n = 6, k = 6, B = 0.010, 95% CI [0.000; (cid:1)0.095], p = 0.040).
No moderation effects of mean age, percentage of males, sample
size, or study quality were found for the associations between
overall or any subtype of CM and self-esteem, self-efficacy, or
well-being. For a detailed description of meta-regression results
see SF2 in the Supplement.

Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses were conducted by overall CM and subtypes.
The following categorical variables were explored: (1) western ver-
sus non-western countries; (2) clinical versus non-clinical samples.

Global/trait resilience
No differences were found for the associations between overall or
any subtype of CM and global/trait resilience in western versus non-
western countries, or in clinical versus non-clinical samples.

Resilience domains
The association between emotional abuse and emotion regulation was
stronger in western (n = 21, r = (cid:1)0.321, [(cid:1)0.364; (cid:1)0.277]) versus non-
western countries (n = 16, r = (cid:1)0.215, [(cid:1)0.282; (cid:1)0.1545), p = 0.010
(see Figure a in the Supplement). The association between emotional
abuse and self-esteem was weaker in western (n = 9, r = (cid:1)0.213,
[(cid:1)0.321; (cid:1)0.098]) versus non-western countries (n = 15, r = (cid:1)0.352,
[(cid:1)0.407; (cid:1)0.296]), p = 0.025 (see Figure b in the Supplement).

No differences were found for the associations between overall
or any subtype of CM and any resilience domains in clinical versus
non-clinical samples. For a detailed description of subgroup ana-
lyses results see SF3 (Figures a, b) in the Supplement.

Sensitivity analysis

To further assess possible causes of heterogeneity and the robustness of
findings, a one-study-removed sensitivity analysis (Borenstein, 2022a)
was conducted. Removal of single effect sizes did not change the
patterns of results with a few exceptions (see SF4 in the Supplement).

Publication bias

The visual inspection of the funnel plots (see SF5 in the Supple-
ment) and Egger’s test suggested publication bias for the associ-
ations between overall CM and self-esteem (z = (cid:1)0.375, p = 0.005),
and between emotional neglect and emotion regulation (z =
(cid:1)0.214, p = 0.036). The trim-and-fill corrected random-effect
estimate changed relative to the uncorrected estimate, yet both
associations remained significant (see Table 2).

Narrative synthesis of moderators and mediators reported in
the included studies

Three (Arslan & Genç, 2022; Shen & Soloski, 2024; Somers, Ibra-
him, & Luecken, 2017) of the 203 reviewed studies investigated
effect moderation, and 17 studies investigated effect mediation
between CM and resilience outcomes.

Moderators
One study found that heart rate reactivity moderated the effects of
CM on depressive symptoms and positive affect (well-being) in
young adults (Somers et al., 2017).

Another study in college students found that positive perception
moderated the adverse impact of emotional maltreatment on emo-
tional but not social well-being (Arslan & Genç, 2022).

Childhood attachment significantly predicted adult attachment,
psychological distress, and self-esteem in adulthood and moderated
the relation between child sexual abuse and anxious adult attachment.
In addition, secure attachment at least partially protected against a
negative long-term effects of child sexual abuse and fostered intra-
and interpersonal adjustment in survivors (Shen & Soloski, 2024).

Mediators
Two studies found that intrapersonal strength (Kapoor et al., 2018)
and perceived burdensomeness (Allbaugh et al., 2017) mediated the
relationship between CM and suicide resilience, especially in African
American females. Another study found that resilience and coping
strategies mediated the association between childhood abuse and
PTSD severity and that lower resilience and dysfunctional coping
strategies may accentuate the detrimental effects of childhood abuse
on PTSD (Kim et al., 2021).

A study found that negative religious coping related positively to
all forms of CM other than emotional neglect, while positive

religious coping related negatively only to child physical neglect.
Furthermore, PTSD symptoms acted as a mediator between abuse
and negative religious coping among low-income, African Ameri-
can women with a history of intimate partner violence and suicidal
behaviours (Bradley, Schwartz, & Kaslow, 2005).

Two studies found that parental and peer relationship quality
mediated the relationship between dual violence exposure to inter-
parental violence and child physical maltreatment and self-esteem in
young adulthood (Shen, 2009), while authenticity in close relation-
ships partially mediated the relation between emotional maltreatment
and negative self-esteem in college women (Theran & Han, 2013).

In a cross-national investigation, perceived negative (but not
positive) impact of bullying mediated the relationship between
adolescent bullying and self-esteem. In addition, perceived negative
impact of adolescent bullying victimisation partially mediated,
while perceived negative impact of adolescent bullying victimisa-
tion fully mediated the relationship between bullying and life
satisfaction (Pabian, Dehue, Völlink, & Vandebosch, 2022).

One study found that disorganised attachment, including fear,
distrust, and suspicion of attachment figures, as well as odd and
disoriented behaviours, mediated the relationship between CM and
difficulties in emotion dysregulation above what is captured by
anxious and avoidant attachment in emerging adulthood in the
context of emerging adult romantic relationships (Whittington,
2024).

In a serial mediation model, one study found that anxiety and
emotional dysregulation mediated the effect of childhood emo-
tional abuse on pain resilience among individuals with alcohol
use disorder (Zaorska et al., 2020).

Self-concept was shown to mediate the relationship between
specific forms of CM and abstinence motivation, and self-concept
mediated the relationship between CM and abstinence motivation,
as well as self-efficacy among drug addicts (Lu, Wen, Deng, & Tang,
2017).

Self-compassion mediated and mitigated the association between
CM severity and later emotion regulation difficulties in individuals
with substance use (Vettese, Dyer, Li, & Wekerle, 2011). Another
study concluded that self-compassion, while not a full mediator
between CM and psychological well-being, served as a partial medi-
ator for male survivors of CM (Tarber et al., 2016). In contrast,
researchers using serial mediation analysis found that self-critical
rumination was a partial mediator, and self-compassion was not a
mediator in the relationship between child emotional maltreatment,
and self-satisfaction and well-being (Cecen & Gümüş, 2024).

Another study found that emotional maltreatment was nega-
tively associated with life satisfaction through self-esteem and
through the pathway from self-esteem to self-compassion, suggest-
ing that self-processes are more vulnerable to emotional maltreat-
ment than to other maltreatment types in emerging adulthood
(Wu et al., 2022).

intermediary of ‘emotional

In a chain mediation model, positive affect, negative affect, and
emotional intelligence mediated the link between CM and life
satisfaction. In addition, CM influenced life satisfaction through
the sequential
intelligence-positive
affect’ and ‘emotional intelligence-negative affect’ (Xiang, Yuan,
& Zhao, 2021). Another study, using a two-step structural equation
modelling approach, found an association between childhood psy-
chological maltreatment and spiritual well-being, and that this
relationship is mediated by both intolerance of uncertainty and
emotion regulation in a Turkish sample (Yilmaz & Satici, 2024).

Finally,

in a prospective cohort study, although adolescent
bullying was a significant risk factor for the onset of depression

and poor well-being in adulthood, no mediating or moderating
effects of depression were found on the relationship between bully-
ing and well-being (Armitage et al., 2021).

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated associations
between overall and different subtypes of CM, global/trait resili-
ence, and domains of resilience in adults. Across the identified
studies, we confirmed overall CM was associated with resilience
in adulthood. Specifically, overall CM was associated with poorer
global/trait resilience, coping, self-esteem, emotion regulation, self-
efficacy, and well-being. We also found associations between dif-
ferent CM subtypes and impairment in both global/trait resilience
and most resilience domains. However, overall associations were
small in magnitude, and findings differed depending on the subtype
of CM and resilience domain considered, suggesting differential
and specific effects.

Given the vast evidence that CM increases the likelihood of
developing physical and mental health problems (Baldwin et al.,
2023; Mehta et al., 2023) and that resilience deficits are a core
component of adaptive functioning (Barton et al., 2023), it is
possible that a larger effect is being constrained by methodological
limitations in the literature. It should also be considered that some
of the significant results found in this review may be affected by
confounding variables not addressed by most of the included
studies (e.g. education level, intelligence, socioeconomic status)
and that there could be other, non-causal explanations, such as
poverty that may increase risk of CM exposure and impairment in
resilience outcomes. Future prospective studies should examine

whether a bidirectional relationship between CM and resilient
functioning exists.

The associations with CM found in this meta-analysis were weak,
suggesting that impairments in resilience in adults are likely influ-
enced by additional biological factors, such as brain structure and
functions (Fares-Otero, Verdolini et al., 2024). Future research
should explore how the timing of CM (Fares-Otero & Schalinski,
2024), especially during sensitive neurodevelopmental periods affects
resilience, and preferably employ multimodal approaches, including
neuroimaging and clinical assessments (Demers et al., 2022; Fares-
Otero, Halligan, Vieta, & Heilbronner, 2024) to capture the role of
neurobiological factors (Ioannidis, Askelund, Kievit, & van Harme-
len, 2020; Zhang, Rakesh, Cropley, & Whittle, 2023) and psycho-
social influences, such as cognitive reserve (Fares-Otero Borràs et al.,
2024). Despite the relevance of CM in health (Lawrence et al., 2023;
Telfar et al., 2023), studies examining its effects on resilience out-
comes are limited, particularly in those with mental and physical
conditions. Further research on the role of CM exposure, especially
neglect, on resilience outcomes, including coping abilities, and in
larger male samples (Davis et al., 2018; Fares-Otero et al., 2025), is
crucial to inform interventions and improve outcomes in adulthood.
See also Table 3 for a summary of methodological issues and further
recommendations for future studies.

Interestingly, the emotional types of CM showed the strongest
associations with impaired resilience. This is in line with previous
meta-analysis on CM and social functioning (Fares-Otero De
Prisco et al., 2023) and a substantial body of evidence demonstrat-
ing that emotional maltreatment may be more strongly associated
with high levels of affective instability (Palmier-Claus et al., 2025)
and depressive symptoms (Hutson et al., 2024), factors that may

may be biased, though retrospective self-reports of CM have shown
sufficient reliability (Badenes-Ribera, Georgieva, Tomás, & Navarro-
Pérez, 2024). Finally, we did not include unpublished work. However,
the inclusion of data from unpublished studies could also introduce
bias (Boutron et al., 2023).

Clinical implications

Clinically, our findings of poorer resilience in people with CM
histories align with and inform a growing body of research sug-
gesting that CM should be routinely considered during assessment,
diagnosis, and treatment. Assessing CM and resilience systematic-
ally in clinical and community settings could support early inter-
vention, mitigate detrimental effects on resilience, and may even
contribute to more accurate diagnoses. While some institutions
already include CM in standard assessments, broader adoption of
this practice across mental health settings would strengthen pre-
ventive and supportive care, particularly by addressing impairment
in CM-related resilience early in the illness.

Our findings suggest that early interventions promoting resilience,
such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy-based resili-
ence training (Zalta et al., 2016), therapeutic processes that encourage
social ties and therapeutic alliance (Burton, Cooper, Feeny, & Zoell-
ner, 2015; Snijders et al., 2018), and psychotherapy founded on the
Trauma Resiliency Model (Grabbe & Miller-Karas, 2018) might be
useful in helping adults with CM experience by focusing on main-
taining global and functional health. Moreover, psychotherapeutic
approaches should target self-compassion and self-concept, secure
attachment, emotional intelligence, PTSD and mood symptoms, and
advance training to help individuals to cope with life stressors that
may be preventing them from achieving or maintaining recovery.

Strengths and limitations

This study builds on the well-established evidence base for the role
of CM as a risk factor for adverse health and psychosocial outcomes
and reinforces that experiences of CM could be related to impaired
resilience in survivors. We performed a comprehensive and
up-to-date systematic review, allowing the inclusion of a large
number of studies. This is by far the first meta-analysis in the field
of CM and resilience with a multi-domain approach. This study
also benefitted from the wide range of pooled subjects, which
constitutes a geographically diverse sample. Although there was
some variability in which subtypes of CM were reported, most
studies used the same standard and validated instrument to assess
CM (CTQ). Other strengths of this study include the rigorous
methodology of the systematic search, study selection, and data
extraction performed by independent researchers.

Our work also includes some limitations. First, the number of
studies available for some meta-analysis was small, meaning that
analyses may not have been sufficiently powered for detecting small
effects (Jackson & Turner, 2017). The capacity to identify hetero-
geneity and moderators was also substantially limited, and extra
caution is needed for conclusions in meta-regressions when there
are <10 studies. Second, it was impossible to account for all the
possible variations across populations with different social envir-
onments, health conditions, and diagnoses, as well as variations
across measurement instruments utilised (and conditions of admin-
istration) in the included studies, although most assessed resilience
outcomes with robust tools. A sensitivity analysis confirmed that
omitting one study at a time did not change the overall findings.
Third, CM was retrospectively reported through assessments that

Conclusions

In conclusion, overall CM and its subtypes are linked to lower
global/trait resilience and more resilience impairments across sev-
eral domains, particularly coping, self-esteem, emotion regulation,
self-efficacy, and well-being in adulthood. While the associations
are weak, exploring socioeconomic status, education level, and the
timing and severity of CM, as well as moderators such as attach-
ment, mood symptoms, and personality features, may clarify these
relationships. This knowledge may reduce the burden associated
with negative health and psychosocial consequences in adulthood
and increase the likelihood that maltreated individuals receive
appropriate and/or optimal treatment.

Prospective and interventional studies are needed to address the
limitations of the current evidence, which mainly comprises cross-
sectional studies with retrospective reporting of CM. Our findings
nonetheless support CM as a key predictor of resilient functioning
in adulthood, underscoring the potential value of trauma-informed
interventions and approaches founded on trauma resiliency models.
Also, early interventions for at-risk children and adolescents may
help improve resilience and quality of life outcomes long-term,
including those with mental disorders.
