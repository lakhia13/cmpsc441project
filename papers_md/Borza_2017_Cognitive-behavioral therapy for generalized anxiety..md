Cognitive-behavioral therapy for generalized 
anxiety
Lucas Borza, PsyM

Current theoretical foundations

  Generalized  anxiety  disorder  (GAD)  has  been 

regarded as a primary diagnosis since 1987 (Diagnostic 
and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  third  revi-
sion [DSM-III-R]). Previously, GAD had been consid-
ered an “anxiety neurosis.” Its specification as a singular 
disorder has allowed the recognition of factors common 
to anxiety disorders, for example, anxious anticipation, 
cognitive  biases,  and  excessive  concern.  Additionally, 
GAD has specific factors that are not shared with other 
anxiety  disorders,  such  as  intolerance  of  uncertainty, 
and  excessive  concerns  in  several  important  areas.  It 
is  therefore  a  diagnosis  whose  conceptualization  has 
much evolved over the last 2 decades, and recent stud-
ies on the subject suggest that the individualization of 
GAD will continue into the future.1
  Nowadays,  DSM-52  defines  GAD  as “the  presence 
of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, 
events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not 
for  at  least  6  months  and  is  clearly  excessive.”  People 
suffering from GAD have great difficulty in controlling 
these worries. They may also present with edginess or 
restlessness, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating,

As a form of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
is  more  than  a  mere  “toolbox.”  CBT  allows  us  to  bet-
ter understand how the human mind is functioning be-
cause it is based on neuroscience and experimental and 
scientific psychology. At the beginning, the Diagnostic 
and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM)  was 
“nontheoretical,”  but  nowadays  (the  most  recent  ver-
sion being DSM-5), it is increasingly based on CBT para-
digms (with the insertion of important notions such as 
cognitions  and  behaviors).  This  Brief  Report  presents 
what  we  currently  know  about  generalized  anxiety 
disorder (GAD) and how we can treat this condition by 
nonpharmaceutical  means.  In  the  last  few  years,  GAD 
theories have evolved, becoming more precise about the 
cognitive functioning of GAD sufferers. Here, we look 
at current theoretical models and the main techniques 
of therapeutic care, as well as the advances in research 
about the “transdiagnostic” process and GAD in child-
hood. CBT is an effective treatment for GAD, typically 
leading to reductions in worry, and a study has shown 
that such therapy is equal to pharmaceutical treatment 
and more effective 6 months after study completion.

and an increase in muscle aches or soreness. GAD suf-
ferers are generally burdened by the significant conse-
quences  the  disorder  has  on  their  relationships  or  on 
their functioning.

In CBT, evaluation is crucial. Professionals rely on 
their clinical judgment, but they will also use standard-
ized  assessment  tools  to  evaluate  symptoms.3-7  Exces-
sive  worry  is  the  main  symptom  in  GAD.  Anxiety  is 
almost  always  present  in  the  minds  of  patients.  The 
themes of concern are relatively similar to those of the 
normal  population  but  are  experienced  in  more  cata-
strophic ways. The surrounding world is perceived with 
apprehension, vigilance, and pessimism (chronic feeling 
of insecurity, loss of contact with the experiential). 
The search for reassurance is the second core element.  
Anxiety levels are therefore higher than in the normal 
population, but they are less intense and more diffuse 
than in a panic disorder, for example (Figure 1).
  GAD  affects  approximately  6%  of  the  general 
population  in  France  if  one  considers  the  entire  lifes-
pan.7 The disorder is common and disabling. A recent 
review of epidemiological studies in Europe suggests a 
12-month prevalence of between 1.7% and 3.75% (be-
ing more common in old age), and the associated func-
tional impairment is similar to that observed with major 
depression.8  Comorbidities  may  be  frequent.  Indeed, 
66.3% of patients present with at least one concomitant 
psychopathology9; in 60% of cases, major depression or 
another anxious disorder is present10; and 90% of GAD 
sufferers are suspected to have a secondary anxious dis-
order, such as social anxiety or panic disorder.11

disorder versus generalized anxiety disorder. GAD, generalized 
anxiety disorder.  

  Concerns described in GAD are considered as a suc-
cession of thoughts in verbal or pictorial form12-14 and not 
as  a  feeling. The  emotion  of  anxiety  will  be  the  conse-
quence of these worries and concerns. For instance, one 
might think “if I get sick, I will not be able to work any-
more, I can lose my job and cannot support my family, we 
will find ourselves on the street…” and so on.

In order to understand the pathology, cognitive psy-
chology attempts to represent the functioning of each 
disorder  through  models.  Here,  we  describe  two  of 
these: Barlow’s model and the model of intolerance of 
uncertainty.
  Barlow’s model15 describes a biological and psycho-
logical  vulnerability  to  the  negative  elements  of  life. 
Focusing attention on potential threats fosters this vul-
nerability and promotes a perceived inability to control 
life events. Concerns have also been addressed as a way 
to  avoid  a  stronger  emotion. This  is  important  from  a 
therapeutic point of view. It explains how the disorder 
can maintain itself over time (maintaining factors) and 
which therapeutic techniques could be applied.
  The  model  of  intolerance  of  uncertainty16-18  is  also 
very important. The point here is to understand that it is 
thought that anxiety is related to the difficulty to tolerate 
doubt about future events and possible negative conse-
quences.  However,  why  then  don’t  people  who  realize 
that  nothing  bad  happens  end  up  worrying  less?  This 
could be explained by the creation of “false beliefs” or 
“positive beliefs” about worries. Indeed, worry is a cog-
nitive  attempt  to  generate  ways  to  prevent  bad  events 
from happening and/or to prepare oneself for their oc-
currence.  In  addition,  the  goal  of  not  feeling  the “full” 
emotion is reached. Patients do not question their beliefs 
because  they  are  happy  that  everything  goes  well. This 
is  explained  in  the  avoidance  model  of  worry.19-20 That 
model  also  explains  that  in  each  situation,  people  seek 
to eliminate an unpleasant thought, emotion, or memo-
ry. Most often, this leads to the anxious thought ending 
up  at  the  center  of  their  attention.  In  addition,  anxiety 
promotes  the  avoidance  of  mental  images  that  are  as-
sociated with greater negative emotion. Thinking about 
what could happen makes it possible to not suffer from 
emotional  images  that  are  more  emotionally  intense.21 
Safety behaviors are then set up (frequent calls to check 
if everything goes well, hypervigilance about public an-
nouncement information, etc). So, whereas safety behav-
iors  and  cognitive  avoidance  will  temporarily  decrease 
anxiety, they will reinforce worries over time.

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 19 . No. 2 . 2017

In summary, in the cognitive approach, worry can be 
used as a coping strategy because people believe in its 
usefulness.  Indeed,  some  GAD  sufferers  affirm  that  it 
would  not  be  normal  if  they  didn’t  worry  about  their 
family or their jobs, or even that it would increase the 
risk that an accident would occur. Sometimes, magical 
thoughts are present and very resistant to change. 

It is fundamental to explore and evaluate the beliefs 
about the function of concerns. They are powerful pre-
disposing  and  maintaining  factors.  It  is  the  same  with 
patients’  perception  of  their  own  emotions,  which  are 
often considered intolerable. They feel the need to sup-
press them as fast as they can (short-term strategy).22-26

Practical interventions

CBT as treatment for GAD includes the development 
of a functional analysis, providing information through 
psychoeducation, experimentation with new behaviors 
and emotions (exposition, relaxation), and a cognitive 
approach. 

Functional analysis

Functional analysis makes it possible to specify where, 
when,  with  what  frequency,  with  what  intensity,  and 
under what circumstances the anxious response is trig-
gered.  It  is  performed  with  the  patient  and  integrates 
the factors maintaining the difficulties. This functional 
analysis  is  crucial  to  the  smooth  running  of  therapy 
because  it  gradually  introduces  important  notions  of 
psychology. It makes it possible to visualize the mental 
functioning of the person, which is already therapeutic 
in and of itself.

Psychoeducation

Psychoeducation can easily be the next step. It is gener-
ally crucial because it makes it possible to understand 
what the future therapeutic tools will be and facilitates 
the increase in motivation to change. Patients begin to 
think in a different way about which behaviors could be 
the most useful. 

The emotional and behavioral approach

The emotional and behavioral approach is generally fa-
vored. The therapist tries to teach relaxation in order to 

instruct how to create positive emotions, not to manage 
negative ones. There is a double effect as follows: (i) the 
provision  of  a “psychological  tool”  to  prepare  for  ex-
position  exercises;  relaxation  allows  desensitization  of 
anxiogenic situations; and (ii) a balancing of the gener-
al mood by adding “cognitive break times” in thoughts 
and worries. 
  The behavioral dimension of CBT is the most im-
portant.  Patients  will  be  able  to  expose  themselves 
to  their  own  emotions  and  so  will  be  able  to  learn 
how  to  fight  maintaining  factors  and  avoidance 
behaviors  that  perpetuate  the  disorder. The  cogni-
tive  process  that  is  sought  is  habituation.  It  is  the 
acceptance  of  thoughts  as  normal  and  nonblocking 
that  initiates  cognitive  work.  An  example  of  men-
tal  exposition  is  the  instruction  “think  the  worst.” 
This strategy allows a rapid and effective reduction 
in  avoidance.  Exposure  to  anxiety  allows  patients 
to remain in the presence of images related to their 
possible  concerns  (disturbing  images  that  are  usu-
ally  avoided),  in  order  to  encourage  emotional  ha-
bituation.  Patients  can  learn  to  tolerate  their  fears, 
which  will  allow  them  to  think  less  often  and  less 
intensely about their worries. 

The cognitive approach

The  cognitive  approach  often  begins  with  a  self-ob-
servation  that  patients  will  carry  out  on  their  own 
thoughts.  Can  the  thoughts  be  spotted?  Can  patients 
isolate them from emotions? The aim of the cognitive 
work  is  to  help  patients  take  a  step  back  from  their 
automatic  thoughts  and  to  be  disjointed  from  those 
worries. The third wave in CBT (mindfulness) adopted 
this principle to create its therapeutic program with a 
different form. 

In a second step, therapy tends to modify the con-
tent of thoughts to reach a more objective evaluation 
of situations. The goal is to struggle against cognitive 
biases, such as overgeneralization or maximization of 
danger. A  second  evaluation  of  situations  is  possible 
by looking for objective indicators that allow relativiz-
ing. It is also possible to evaluate the consequences of 
worry and to understand subtle avoidance. The thera-
pist tries to help patients to fully treat anxious antici-
pations, make them aware of danger patterns, and pro-
pose alternatives to catastrophism (overestimation of 
risk). 27

GAD in children and the  
transdiagnostic process

Children,  too,  can  be  worried  in  a  pathological  way. 
Anxieties are normal during development, but with poor 
emotional  management  they  can  become  problematic. 
Always considering the “what if?” they ask a lot of ques-
tions  to  be  sure  and  certain  and  sometimes  they  try  to 
predict  every  possible  scenario.  Attentional  focus  on 
the threat appears to be a bias predisposing to GAD.28,29 
Prompt treatment would seem important to prevent this 
“cognitive  habit”  from  becoming  anchored  because  in-
tolerance of uncertainty can be the “fuel” of anxiety.30
  Children  with  GAD  show  difficulty  concentrating, 
and  they  are  always  thinking  about  what’s  next. They 
need  reassurance  and  approval  for  small  steps  and 
avoid a lot of uncertain situations. They try to minimize 
risks. They can present with perfectionism, a great fear 
of  making  mistakes  and  a  fear  of  criticism. They  also 
show  metacognitive  bias  by  thinking  that  worries  will 
prevent tragedies. 

  A child with GAD can look like he or she has de-
pression, whereas the real problem is closer to inhibi-
tion and resignation. Psychological work with children 
and adolescents requires a lot of imagination. Clinicians 
always  need  to  create  educational  support  and  adapt 
psychiatric classification to children. 

Conclusion

CBT as a treatment for GAD has been  established as 
an  excellent  way  to  change  pathological  worries  into 
normal worries. A lot of research must still be done to 
improve therapeutic tools that facilitate distancing one-
self from anxious thoughts. Current science has achieved 
a  good  understanding  of  psychological  mechanisms  in 
GAD, and further research in transdiagnostic fields may 
provide new approaches to GAD treatment. o

Terapia cognitiva-conductual para la ansiedad 
generalizada

La thérapie cognitivo-comportementale pour 
l’anxiété généralisée

La terapia cognitiva-conductual (TCC), como una forma 
de  terapia,  es  más  que  una  mera  “caja  de  herramien-
tas”. La TCC permite una mejor comprensión de cómo 
funciona la mente humana ya que se basa en las neu-
rociencias y en la psicología experimental y científica. El 
Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de los Trastornos Men-
tales  (DSM)  inicialmente  fue  “ateórico”,  pero  actual-
mente (la versión más reciente, el DSM 5) se basa cada 
vez más en paradigmas de TCC (con la inserción de im-
portantes nociones tales como cogniciones y conductas). 
Este reporte breve presenta el conocimiento actual so-
bre el trastorno de ansiedad generalizada (TAG) y cómo 
puede ser tratada esta condición a través de medios no 
farmacológicos. En los últimos años, las teorías del TAG 
han  evolucionado,  llegando  a  ser  más  precisas  acerca 
del  funcionamiento  cognitivo  de  quienes  lo  padecen. 
En este artículo se revisan los modelos teóricos actuales 
y las principales técnicas de manejo terapéutico, como 
también los avances en la investigación sobre el proce-
so  “transdiagnóstico”  y  el  TAG  en  la  niñez.  La  TCC  es 
un tratamiento efectivo para el TAG y lo característico 
es que reduzca las preocupaciones. Un estudio ha mos-
trado  que  dicha  terapia  es  equivalente  al  tratamiento 
farmacológico y más efectiva a los seis meses de haber 
completado el estudio.    

Mode  de  traitement,  la  thérapie  cognitivo-comporte-
mentale (TCC) est plus qu’une simple «boîte à outils ». 
Basée sur les neurosciences et sur la psychologie scien-
tifique et expérimentale, la TCC nous permet de mieux 
comprendre le fonctionnement cognitif chez l’homme. 
A ses débuts, le DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of  Mental  Disorders)  était  “non  théorique”,  mais  au-
jourd’hui (la version la plus récente étant le DSM-5), il 
se  base  de  plus  en  plus  sur  des  modèles  de  TCC  (avec 
l’insertion de notions importantes comme la cognition 
et  le  comportement).  Nous  présentons  ici  brièvement 
nos  connaissances  actuelles  sur  l’anxiété  généralisée 
(AG) et ses moyens de traitement non médicamenteux. 
Ces  dernières  années,  les  théories  sur  l’AG  ont  évolué 
en se précisant sur le fonctionnement cognitif des per-
sonnes qui en souffrent. Nous examinons ici les modèles 
théoriques actuels et les principales techniques de soin 
thérapeutique,  ainsi  que  les  avancées  de  la  recherche 
sur le processus « transdiagnostique » et l’AG dans l’en-
fance. La TCC est un traitement efficace de l’AG, dimi-
nuant typiquement l’inquiétude excessive et une étude 
a montré qu’un tel traitement est équivalent à un trai-
tement médicamenteux et plus efficace 6 mois après la 
fin de l’étude.
