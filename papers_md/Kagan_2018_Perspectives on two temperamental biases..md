This paper describes the contribution of two infant temperamental biases to
variation in behaviour and biology over the first 18 years in a sample of
middle-class Caucasian children. One bias, called high reactive, is defined
by frequent display of limb activity and crying in four-month-old infants
to unexpected or unfamiliar events. The other, called low reactive, is defined
by the opposite pair of behaviours to the same incentives. High reactive
infants are likely to display cautious, avoidant responses and signs of an
excitable amygdala to unexpected experiences. Low reactives are character-
ized by a sociable, emotionally spontaneous profile to the same experiences
and a minimally excitable amygdala. However, each bias is a better predictor
of the future traits that are unlikely to develop than the ones that do. The
final pattern of traits is a function of the person’s temperaments, life history,
and current circumstances.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Diverse perspectives on diversity:

multi-disciplinary approaches to taxonomies of individual differences’.

1. Definitions of temperamental categories
Every candidate that can be classified as a natural kind is a collection of properties
organized in a particular pattern. This claim applies to atoms, molecules,
species, and the psychological categories representing types of individuals
within a species. The concept of a temperamental bias includes two kinds of
phenomena requiring distinctive vocabularies. On the one hand, variation in
brain patterns affects a child’s susceptibility to displaying certain behaviours
should the setting invite them. Because most investigators assume that vari-
ation in brain chemistry or anatomy, inherited or acquired during gestation,
is the basis of most temperaments, it is reasonable to suggest the existence of
a very large number of human temperaments. This claim rests on the fact that
human brains vary in the concentrations of more than 150 molecules and in the
densities and locations of the varied receptors for each of these molecules. These
patterns have not been discovered. However, none of these brain profiles
generates only one class of behaviour. Rather, each is linked to an envelope
of possible responses. The person’s interpretation of a bodily feeling produced
by the brain profile, and always the features of the immediate setting, determine
the reaction most likely to occur.

On the other hand, variability in irritability, ease of being soothed, activity
level, and frequency of smiling and vocalization have been treated as observa-
ble reflections of a pair of complementary, abstract temperamental dimensions
called ease and regulation of arousal states. Because these terms fail to specify
the age of the agent, the source of the arousal, the form the arousal or regulation
assumes, or the measure used to quantify either dimension, their meanings are
ambiguous. The phenomena that reflect each dimension change as a joint func-
tion of maturation and the nature of the settings a child confronts. At the
moment, most investigators use the term temperament to refer to behaviours
rather than the brain profiles that render some children more or less likely to
exhibit particular actions.

This paper considers a pair of temperamental biases defined by the infant’s
behavioural response to unexpected or unfamiliar events that are not serious
threats. Every mammalian species displays intra-specific variation in the reac-
tions to unexpected or unfamiliar events. Variation in the excitability of one

or more nuclei of the amygdala is an important source of this
variation because these nuclei project to brain and bodily tar-
gets that generate the behavioural response to unfamiliarity.
For example, a small proportion of domestic cats that do
not approach or attack rats display heightened excitability
in a circuit that connects the basomedial amygdala with the
ventromedial hypothalamus. The latter, in turn, projects to
neurons in the central grey that mediate arches of the back [1].
An unexpected event, pleasant or unpleasant, is usually
followed by an increase in dopamine and/or norepinephrin,
which removes the tonic suppression of the central nucleus
by the intercalated cell mass. As a result, projections from
the anterior cingulate to the amygdala, which are excitatory,
become dominant [2– 4]. The amygdala projects to diverse
targets that mediate limb movement, arches of the back,
distress cries, and activity in many sites in the autonomic
nervous system [5–7].

2. High and low reactive infants
Human infants vary in the display of limb movements and
distress cries and, less frequently, back arches to unfamiliar
events they did not anticipate. We observed these behaviours
in a sample of 500 healthy, Caucasian, four-month-old infants
presented with unfamiliar mobiles moving in front of their
face, a blend of voices speaking sentences emitted by a
small speaker, and the smell of dilute alcohol.

We restricted the sample to Caucasians because children
from African, Asian, or Latin American pedigrees differ in
genes that might contribute to infant reactivity, later behav-
iour, and any biological measures we might gather [8].
Four-month-old Caucasian-American and Chinese-American
infants, for example, responded differently to some of the
unfamiliar events my colleagues and I used to classify infants
as high or low reactive. More Caucasian than Chinese infants
showed a combination of frequent limb activity and crying;
more Chinese than Caucasians combined low levels of limb
activity with infrequent crying [9]. Furthermore, Asian
fetuses and children display lower vagal tone on the heart
than Africans or Caucasians [10–12].

We also observed infants directly rather than relying on
parental descriptions because the relation between the two
sources of evidence for many psychological properties
ranges from poor to modest [13]. The contexts in which beha-
viours occur are one reason for the differential validities of
conclusions based on these different sources of evidence.
Parents typically rely on the child’s behaviour in the familiar
home setting, whereas psychologists base their inferences on
behaviours to less familiar incentives presented in an unfami-
liar laboratory. Most children who throw tantrums at home
rarely do so in a laboratory. Although scientists use the
same criteria when evaluating their subjects, parents do not
rely on the same criteria when they judge the degree of shy-
ness, fearfulness, or impulsivity of their child. Hence, these
two sources of
information necessarily invite different
inferences.

Twenty per cent of the infants in our large sample dis-
played high levels of
limb activity and crying to the
mobiles, speech, and smell of alcohol. These infants, classi-
fied as high reactive, were expected to exhibit a profile in
the second year marked by caution, crying, and hesitation
to approach or explore unfamiliar toys, people, or places

that were not serious threats. We called this pattern behav-
ioural inhibition or BI. By contrast, the 40% of infants who
were minimally active and rarely cried to the same incentives,
classified as low reactive, were expected to approach un-
familiar people and objects and display a pattern called
behaviourally uninhibited. These predictions were confirmed
when the children were observed in our laboratory at 14 and
21 months [14]. Two-year-olds from an independent study
who displayed BI behaviours to puppets, a clown, and an
unfamiliar woman seated several feet from the child were
often described by their parents as displaying BI when they
were three years old [15]. We continued to study samples
from each of these two groups when they were 4, 5, 7, 11,
15 and 18 years old. At each of these six ages, more high
than low reactives showed behavioural signs of uncertainty
in the form of caution, immobility, suppression of spontane-
ity, or avoidance of unfamiliar events. They talked and smiled
less often with an unfamiliar female examiner, were less soci-
able with unfamiliar peers, and, as adolescents, confessed to
more worries about low probability events, such as a parent’s
death in an airplane crash or an unpleasant experience on a
subway. Uncertainty over encountering events that
they
could neither predict nor control was a primary source of
tension and worry among high reactive adolescents.

In addition, 11- and 15-year-old high reactives were more
likely than low reactives to display signs of an excitable
amygdala. These signs included a higher and less variable
heart rate, more power in the low frequency band (less than
0.15 Hz) of the cardiac spectrum, which reflects more sym-
pathetic influence on resting heart
frontal
activation at rest (defined by less alpha band power in the
right than the left frontal lobe), larger N400 event related
wave forms to unfamiliar pictures, and a larger auditory
evoked potential from the inferior colliculus to a series of
clicks. Although each measure is influenced by multiple con-
ditions, high values on several of these indexes are more
likely to reflect a more reactive amygdala [13].

right

rate,

Carl Schwartz [16,17] provided the best support for the
hypothesis that high reactives are born with a neurochemistry
that renders their amygdala more responsive to unexpected
events. The magnitude of change in blood flow to the
amygdala in response to unexpected events—the BOLD
signal—revealed that 18-year-olds who had been high reactive
infants displayed both a larger and a shallower slope of habitu-
ation of the signal to the amygdala to pictures that were
unexpected. They also reported more symptoms of social
anxiety and/or depression. These results are detailed in various
publications [13,14,18,19]. Fox and his students have extended
our understanding of these two temperaments [20,21].

3. Current understanding of high or low

reactivity

We believe that the four-month-old high reactive infants
inherited a neurochemistry, not yet known, that lowered
the threshold of responsivity of the amygdala, and perhaps
to unexpected or unfamiliar
the hippocampus as well,
events. Children and adults with this bias are likely to experi-
ence unexpected rises in heart rate or tightening of muscles
that they cannot explain. Fetuses with higher than average
heart rates who also showed greater sympathetic tone on
the cardiovascular system during sleep at 2 and 16 weeks

postnatal were likely to be classified as high reactive at four
months [22].

Children become consciously aware of feelings that orig-
inate in the cardiovascular system, muscles and gut during
the second year. If a feeling occurs when a child is confront-
ing a large dog or hearing a sudden, loud sound, the child is
likely to interpret the feeling as fear of being harmed. Because
2-year-olds are not yet capable of controlling all the actions
prompted by this feeling, they show the behaviours that
define BI.

However, with each passing year children become more
capable of controlling public display of BI responses. Only
46% of high reactive 4-year-olds interacting with an unfami-
liar peer of the same age and gender in a laboratory play
room showed obvious signs of BI behaviour, compared
with 10% of low reactives [23]. Only 20% of high reactives
displayed BI behaviour on all
four assessments from
14 months to 7 years. This result is consistent with other data
affirming separate circuits for private feelings and public
behaviours [24].

Many 15- and 18-year-olds who had been high reactive
infants and displayed BI at age two were no longer shy
with strangers. One adolescent boy with this profile wrote
an essay describing how he successfully coped with his feel-
ings: ‘I have found that the manifestation of my anxiety can
be overcome by using simple mind over matter techniques.
. . . Because I now understand my predisposition towards
anxiety. I can talk myself out of simple fears.’

It is likely that parental practices contribute to the vari-
ation in BI behaviour among high reactive infants. Doreen
Arcus observed a sample of high reactive and other infants
on five occasions in the home between 5 and 13 months.
The high reactives raised by mothers who picked them up
immediately when they cried, were reluctant to yell when
they were in danger, and tried to protect them from situa-
tions that might evoke fear displayed more BI behaviour at
14 months than high reactives whose mothers were less
protective [25].

Although most high reactives learn to suppress BI
responses as they mature, they continue to experience an
uncomfortable feeling when unable to predict or prepare
for a future challenge. They also possess a more excitable
amygdala [16] and a thicker cortex in a small area in the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex of the right hemisphere that
projects to neurons in the lateral periaqueductal grey that
mediate arches of the back [17].

4. The need to measure patterns
Future studies of youths or adults who display inhibited or
uninhibited profiles should add biological measures that
might separate those who possess a high or low reactive tem-
perament from those whose behaviour is primarily the result
of experience. Five-year-olds who preserved a BI profile from
the second to the fifth year had higher values on several bio-
logical measures that were absent in those who did not
preserve their earlier BI pattern [26].

The measures that show promise of differentiating
between BI patterns due to a high reactive bias, rather than
experience alone,
include a high and minimally variable
heart rate at rest, decreased variability of pitch periods in
speech under stress, a large brain stem evoked potential

from the inferior colliculus in response to a series of clicks,
right frontal activation in the resting electroencephalogram
(EEG), a large and shallow rate of habituation of the P3a or
N400 wave form to unfamiliar events, activity in the corruga-
tor and infrahyoid muscles in response to novelty,
large
increase in pupillary dilation in response to challenge, and
a large BOLD signal to the amygdala in response to novelty
[13,27 –33].

Among Caucasian samples, eye colour, body mass index
(BMI), and facial width (ratio of width at the maxillae over
the height of the face) are also useful variables because
older, Caucasian children who had been classified as high
reactive and showed BI behaviour in the second year were
more likely than others to have a smaller BMI, narrower
face, smaller body size, and blue eyes [13]. Men with broad
than males with
faces are more likely to be dominant
narrow faces [34]. The same is true for brown capuchin mon-
keys [35]. Dog breeds with a large body size are less fearful of
both humans and dogs than small breeds, and red junglefowl
bred for low fear of humans are larger and more dominant
than smaller size fowl [36– 38].

Studies of many animals, including fish, rodents, foxes,
horses, dogs and cats, reveal associations between pigmenta-
tion of the skin or fur coat and behaviour. Mares from a large
sample of Tennessee walking horses who had a black coat
were more self-reliant than those with a more reddish coat,
called bays [39]. These observations invite the speculation
that the genes controlling the migration of neural crest cells
may contribute to high or low reactivity in Caucasian
samples. This claim is based on the fact that some neural
crest cells become the tissues that contribute to the shape of
the face while others become the melanocytes of skin and
iris which make either eumelanin (brown or black) or
pheomelanin (yellow or red) [40].

Northern Europeans are more likely than most human
populations to combine blue eyes with a narrow face. This
group had to endure long, cold winters for more than 400
generations. Hence, mutations that potentiated activity in the
sympathetic chain of the autonomic nervous system would
have been adaptive because sympathetic constriction of skin
capillaries facilitates the retention of body heat.

5. The case for categories
Instead of treating a behavioural or biological measure as
reflecting a continuous trait, it will prove more fruitful to
create categories of people based on their profiles on a pattern
of measures because those with extreme scores on a single,
continuous variable often display a unique pattern on
several measures [41]. About one in four high reactive infants
showed BI behaviour at 14 months and, at age 11, were
reserved with the examiner, reported disliking novel events
and crowds, and displayed one or more of four biological
signs of an excitable limbic system (right frontal activation,
large brain stem evoked potential from the inferior colliculus,
a high and minimally variable heart rate, or large N400 to
unfamiliar pictures). Not one low reactive infant showed
this pattern and only 5% of high reactives developed the
opposite profile of sociable traits, a preference for new experi-
ences, and a less excitable limbic system. The heritability of
in the second year was higher when the
observed BI
sample was restricted to children whose BI scores were

greater than one standard deviation from the mean of the
entire sample [42,43]. Only 10% of a large sample of
middle-class Caucasian children were described by their
parents as extremely fearful at 6, 12, 22 and 36 months [44].
Investigators quantifying social behaviour or anxious
symptoms in adults are unlikely to know whether they had
been high or low reactive infants. Each adult could belong
to one of four types defined by their scores on relevant
behavioural and biological measures.
If values in the
bottom or top tercile of the distribution of the adult measures
are treated as the criteria for classifying an adult as low or
high, most adults who had been high reactive infants
should be low on behavioural signs of shyness, caution and
avoidance of challenges, but high on several biological
indexes of an excitable amygdala or high on both behaviour
and biology. Adults who were high on BI responses but low
on the biological measures or low on both are least likely to
have been high reactive infants.

A high reactive temperamental bias is a better predictor of
the traits that will not develop than of the profile that emerges.
Few adolescents who had been high reactive infants would
say to an interviewer, as one low reactive did, ‘Everything is
fun’. Nor would many low reactives report a chronic mood
of worry and melancholy. Only 20% of high reactive infants
became extremely shy, anxious adolescents who showed two
or more signs of an excitable amygdala. But 90% of high reac-
tives were not consistently sociable, fearless adolescents with a
minimally excitable amygdala. Similarly, only 40% of low
reactives preserved a consistently sociable, minimally anxious
personality combined with no signs of an excitable amygdala.
But 90% of low reactives failed to show high levels of shyness,
social anxiety, and an excitable amygdala. Each temperamen-
tal bias limits the likelihood of acquiring select traits rather
than determining a particular profile.

The evidence invites a conception of high and low reactiv-
ity as well as adult personality patterns as categories rather

References

than continuous traits [23,41]. Because most psychological
outcomes can be the result of more than one cascade, it is
useful to invent categories defined by a pattern of measures
that includes behaviours, biology, and current or recent life
circumstances. Nine-year-olds who showed both a BI profile
at age three and a large error related wave form in the EEG to
an incorrect response at age six developed internalizing
symptoms after experiencing Hurricane Sandy [45].

Consider a hypothetical pair of monozygotic twins both
of whom were high reactive infants who displayed BI behav-
iour in the second year. One sibling remained in a small town
in rural Montana, married, and is the director of the local
library. Her sister left the town at age 17 to go to a university
in Chicago where her feelings of loneliness and anxiety made
it hard to study. As a result, she left college before gradu-
ation, found a job in a dry cleaning store, is living alone in
a small apartment, and is suffering from social anxiety and
depression. Local circumstances have to be added to tem-
perament and past experience in order to understand the
conditions that place a person at risk for a mental illness.

Unfortunately, scientists do not yet possess methods
capable of detecting temperamental biases in adults because
the brain state that was the basis for the infant’s temperament
has changed over time as a function of maturation and
experience and is no longer present in the adult. This early
brain state can be likened to the disappearance of a drop of
black ink stirred in a glass of glycerine. The task for future
investigators is to chart prospectively the envelopes of personas
temperamental biases, brain
that emerge from blends of
chemistry, childhood experiences, and local circumstances [46].
