Abstract

Background: Reproductive health counseling is essential for adolescents and young adults 
(AYAs). Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) AYAs would benefit from tailored counseling 
given concerns about iatrogenic infertility and sexual dysfunction, and high rates of interpersonal 
violence, unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, yet there are multiple 
obstacles to providing this care at the patient/family and clinician levels.

Objectives: This narrative review summarizes the literature on reproductive health 
considerations for TGD AYAs, current practices, and clinician barriers and facilitators to providing 
culturally sensitive reproductive care for TGD AYAs. Specific areas of focus include: reproductive 
health goals, risks, and access barriers; clinician knowledge practices and challenges; and 
strategies for improving counseling practices.

Materials/Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Web of Science, and PsycInfo 
databases were searched using the following terms: transgender, non-binary, gender expansive, 
gender non-conforming, reproductive health, sexual health, fertility, family planning/building,

provider knowledge and attitudes; counseling.

Results: Many TGD AYAs desire biological children and improved sexual experiences. 
TGD AYAs may experience infertility and sexual dysfunction associated with transition; have 
disproportionate HIV/STI risk; experience high rates of interpersonal/sexual violence and trauma; 
and encounter barriers to accessing competent medical care. Clinicians lack knowledge about 
reproductive health needs of TGD AYAs; inconsistently discuss family building options; perceive 
counseling challenges; and desire more training in this area.

Discussion: Enriched communication training for medical/mental health clinicians is necessary 
to provide a skilled workforce for TGD AYAs. Web-based reproductive health training with 
other populations (e.g., oncology) demonstrates efficacy for improving communication skills and 
confidence in counseling,

Conclusion: This review highlights barriers to adequate reproductive care encountered by TGD 
AYAs, exacerbated in underserved minority youth. Dedicated training for providers, and programs 
increasing access are important goals for improving care. The need for additional research is also 
emphasized.

Keywords

Transgender; gender diverse; adolescents and young adults; reproductive health

Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescents and young adults (AYAs) experience 
significant health disparities owing to historical marginalization in healthcare settings; a 
lack of trained healthcare providers;1–3 stigma;4 and intersecting identities5 that may impede 
access to and receipt of appropriate healthcare. Data from the Williams Institute showed 
~150,000 adolescents aged 13–17 years and 206,000 young adults aged 18–24 years in 
the United States (US) identify as TGD.6 More recent estimates suggest up to 2.7% of 
high-school students identify as TGD.7

Many of these youth experience gender dysphoria, defined as distress related to 
incongruence between gender identity and assigned sex at birth.8 Mental health risks are 
also prevalent in this population including significant anxiety9 and high rates of suicidality.10 
Early medical access to gender-affirming care is associated with reduced suicidality.11 
Increasing numbers of TGD AYAs are seeking medical and surgical interventions to 
reduce dysphoria by bringing their bodies and gender identities into alignment.12 A recent 
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement called for provider education to 
facilitate provision of comprehensive, gender-affirming, and developmentally appropriate 
care for TGD AYAs.13 The AAP also published guidelines recommending integrating 
reproductive health counseling into routine healthcare for all AYAs.14

Reproductive health, defined by the World Health Organization as a constellation of 
factors including family building, sexual function, contraception and HIV/STI prevention, 
is especially paramount to address in TGD AYAs.15 Reproductive health education and 
counseling is appropriate for all AYAs as a fundamental aspect of preventive health care. 
TGD AYAs, however, have several unique considerations and risks that make reproductive

health counseling both more critical and more complex than for AYAs in general. Gender­
affirming medical and surgical interventions can have negative effects on fertility and may 
also impact sexual function in a number of ways, both positive and negative, depending 
on an individual’s sexual function goals.16 Reproductive health risks are elevated further 
for TGD AYAs who have other minoritized and intersecting identities, such as race or 
immigration status for example.17

Although increasing numbers of TGD AYAs are seeking gender-affirming medical care,12 
tailored reproductive health counseling is often unavailable or inadequate.1 Recent surveys 
of medical and mental health providers involved in TGD healthcare have shown gaps in 
reproductive health knowledge, counseling practices, and referral patterns.9,18 The goals 
of this narrative review are to summarize the literature on TGD AYAs regarding: 1) 
reproductive health goals, risks, and access barriers; 2) clinician knowledge practices and 
challenges; and 3) strategies for improving counseling practices. Finally, priorities for future 
research are emphasized.

METHODS

To inform this narrative review, we searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed 
publications (English language) with the following key words: transgender, non-binary, 
gender expansive, gender non-conforming, reproductive health, sexual health, fertility, 
family planning, contraception, family building, sexual dysfunction; gender affirming 
surgery, gender affirming hormones, clinician, physician or provider knowledge and 
attitudes; counseling. No date restrictions were used. Consistent with a narrative review 
approach, we summarize research on each topic of interest.19

RESULTS

Reproductive health goals

Many TGD adults desire biological children.20–23 Organizations such as the American 
Society for Reproductive Medicine have asserted the same reproductive options should be 
offered to individuals at risk for fertility loss regardless of gender identity (e.g., TGD AYAs 
pursuing hormonal or surgical interventions that may impact fertility).24 Several published 
cases report transgender adults opting for fertility preservation and/or pregnancy.25–28 In 
contrast, studies among TGD AYA report variable rates of fertility preservation, ranging 
from <5% in the United States,29,30 to higher rates of sperm cryopreservation in other 
countries such as the Netherlands, Australia, and Israel.31–33 It is possible these rates are 
higher in countries where fertility preservation is covered by a national health plan, as 
opposed to the United States where coverage by public or private insurance is challenging.

Many TGD adolescents state they would prefer to adopt or possibly opt out of 
parenthood altogether.29,30,34,35 However, in one recent study, many of the youth surveyed 
acknowledged the possibility that their perspectives on parenthood may change with 
time.35 Acknowledgement by youth of the potential for change in parenthood goals as 
they age suggests they may regret lack of uptake of fertility preservation if they desire 
biological children in the future. Various studies have been conducted with transgender

adult participants who received gender affirming medical interventions (medical and or 
surgical), with general findings indicating considerable heterogeneity in parenting goals, 
many expressing the desire to parent, and some adults indicating a desire for biological 
children.20,36

Beyond fertility, providers of TGD AYAs should routinely consider and address sexual 
health and functioning. Transgender youth are no different than cisgender youth in their 
desire for satisfying sexual experiences.37 Routine counseling is needed to proactively 
promote positive sexual function among TGD AYAs who might be at risk for persistently 
poor quality of life (QoL) due to sexual inhibition, discomfort, and/or a history of sexual 
victimization.

Reproductive health risks

Fertility, contraception, and sexual function—Medical and surgical interventions 
used to facilitate gender transition may cause fertility impairment to varying degrees. 
Puberty blockers (gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists) do not permanently impair 
fertility but may prevent gamete maturation, which impacts oocyte maturation/ovulation 
and the development of viable sperm.38 Future fertility needs to be considered prior to 
starting puberty blockers, given that many adolescents begin treatment with gender affirming 
hormones (estrogen and testosterone) while still on blockers,39 impeding the gametes from 
further development. These discussions with patients can be particularly complex, given that 
established fertility preservation options are limited for youth who are early in puberty.

Gender affirming hormones and surgical interventions may have negative effects on fertility 
in certain cases. Research in transgender women treated with estrogen shows decreases 
in testicular volumes and impairment of spermatogenesis.40,41 Effects of testosterone on 
ovarian function are less clear, with some studies raising concerns about negative effects 
on fertility and other studies reporting pregnancies during or after testosterone treatment.42 
Surgical interventions to remove some or all reproductive organs have obvious implications 
for reproductive capacity.

While it is critical to discuss potential fertility impairment related to these gender-affirming 
hormonal treatments, providers must also emphasize that gender-affirming hormones are not 
effective forms of birth control. Research has shown TGD AYAs have this misconception 
when fertility preservation options have been discussed.43 Recent surveys show TGD 
AYAs inconsistently use contraception when engaging in penile- vaginal or penile – 
anal intercourse, increasing STI health risks and putting them at risk for unintentional 
pregnancy.25,44 Literature is limited on the frequency and type of contraception used among 
TGD AYAs.43,44 Two recent studies of TGD AYAs showed 43–46% of those assigned 
male at birth and 39–54% of those assigned female at birth did not use condoms or birth 
control during their last sexual encounter(the authors do not specify the type of sexual 
encounter).45,46 Lack of contraception use is also associated with use of substances, such 
as drugs or alcohol, which further exacerbates risky sexual behaviors.47 A Canadian study 
of 429 sexually active TGD AYA reported 6% (N=26) of TGD AYAs were involved in an 
unintentional pregnancy, compared to 2% of cisgender AYAs.5,48

Sexual function is also an issue to be addressed as transgender adults report lower 
sexual satisfaction (27–41%) and higher sexual dissatisfaction (27–39%) than cisgender 
adults.49 The exact reasons for these differences remain unclear. Gender affirming surgical 
treatments may results in adverse events. Although rare, the following complications have 
been reported and may impact sexual function: 1). vaginoplasty risks: bleeding, infection, 
skin or clitoral necrosis, suture line dehiscence, urinary retention, or vaginal stenosis 
or prolapse,50 rectovaginal or pararectal abscess, development of fistulae between the 
rectum and neovagina, vaginal prolapse; 2). phalloplasty and metoidioplasty risks: urethral 
strictures, fistulae,51 wound infections, wound breakdown, urinary catheter difficulties, flap 
loss, pelvic or groin hematomas, and rectal injury.50 Any of these complications are likely to 
impact sexual desire and function.52

Some studies report transgender adults engage in less frequent sexual activity than cisgender 
adults, particularly those who have body image concerns or have experienced sexual 
violence harassment.53 Other studies have shown increased sexual activity and higher 
satisfaction among TGD individuals who have had gender-affirming surgery.54 Gender­
affirming treatments can have a positive impact on body image, sexual function, and quality 
of life (QoL) in TGD adults,49 but the impact of these treatments on TGD AYAs is less clear. 
Further, access to gender-affirming treatments remains variable across centers and regions.

Sexually Transmitted Infections—High rates of risky sexual behaviors among TGD 
AYAs raise concerns about other significant and long-term deleterious health effects.55 An 
estimated 10% of all sex workers in the U.S. are transgender. A national survey of 6,400 
TGD people found that 15% were HIV positive,56 and transgender women are at particular 
risk as they have high likelihood of engaging in condom-less anal intercourse.57 Along these 
lines, a Canadian study showed TGD AYAs were six times more likely to be diagnosed with 
a STI than their cisgender counterparts.48 A study of 300 racial/ethnic minority transgender 
adults found perceived discrimination and expectations for rejection associated with sexual 
risk-taking.58 Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective method of preventing HIV 
infection. Recent guidelines suggest all sexually active TGD AYAs should be offered PrEP, 
in addition to the HPV vaccine to reduce cancer risk,59 but uptake among TGD AYAs is 
sub-optimal.60

Interpersonal violence and sexual assault—The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey 
found 47% of participants had a history of sexual assault, with higher prevalence among 
those engaged in sex work, were homeless or had disabilities.3 Additionally, 54% of 
respondents reported relationship-based violence.3 TGD people of color are at particular 
risk, as noted by the high homicide rates in transgender women of color. It is critical 
for reproductive health counselors to be trained to screen for these elevated risk factors: 
inquiring about sexual violence history, trauma, and other mental health sequelae related 
to victimization.3 Clinicians should also refer TGD AYAs for accessible gender sensitive 
sexual and teen violence assault counseling, sexual and relationship safety education, and 
gender and trauma informed mental health services when appropriate.

Reproductive health access barriers

Lack of access to sensitive and informed clinicians can pose barriers to reproductive 
health services,61 ultimately leading to increased rates of HIV/STIs, unplanned pregnancy, 
diminished sexual health and functioning, and potential future regret related to infertility.62 
Barriers to fertility preservation specific to TGD populations include sociocultural 
expectations regarding parenthood and the potential for worsening dysphoria associated 
with fertility preservation interventions, tissue reimplantation, and pregnancy. Additionally, 
fertility preservation options for early pubertal youth are limited to testicular tissue 
cryopreservation (which is currently experimental) and ovarian tissue cryopreservation 
(which may be of questionable benefit in TGD youth given unknown fertility impacts of 
testosterone and the potential risks of removing an ovary).63 Access to fertility specialists for 
preservation or other aspects of reproductive health care may also be hindered by the high 
costs of such services in many countries such as the United States.64

Further, people whose gender identity does not align with their reproductive anatomy may 
be uncomfortable seeking reproductive healthcare, which can lead to adverse outcomes and 
reduced quality of life.65 For example, a person born with a uterus and cervix who does not 
identity as female, may be reluctant to receive annual screening of those organs, or attend 
to health information on “women’s healthcare.”23 TGD AYAs may not mention reproductive 
health concerns to their providers or may address these concerns using unfamiliar vernacular 
(e.g., “my front hole doesn’t lube”), with the untrained provider unable to discern the 
complaint and/or be uncomfortable asking for clarification. Additionally, TGD AYAs 
may not know how or where to find providers knowledgeable about transgender health 
care, especially in resource poor settings such as rural communities. Further, an initial 
insensitive or traumatic medical experience (e.g. being misgendered by a provider) may 
reduce the likelihood of seeking subsequent important health-related care. Anticipated bias 
in healthcare is prevalent among the TGD population. A study of 350 TGD people reported 
41% had experienced healthcare discrimination, and 48% of 544 transmasculine individuals 
expressed mistrust of medical institutions and perceived stigma from providers.61

Intersecting minority identities in TGD AYAs further exacerbate health disparities in 
already marginalized populations. Intersectionality refers to the interlocking systems of 
oppression experienced by individuals embodying multiple minoritized identities, including 
those related to gender, race, ethnicity, social class, and sexual orientation.66,67 Due to 
structural systems of oppression, possessing minoritized identities differentially impacts an 
individual’s healthcare experiences. For instance, a recent U.S.-based survey of transgender 
individuals found transgender people of color experienced more significant patterns of 
discrimination than white transgender respondents, although all transgender individuals 
were at greater risk for discrimination than their cisgender counterparts.3 Transgender 
individuals who identified as undocumented, people of color, or disabled report higher rates 
of mistreatment, poverty and barriers to health care.3

Clinician knowledge, practices and challenges

Despite multiple guidelines stating reproductive health counseling (including discussions 
about fertility preservation) should occur routinely,68–72 and research showing TGD

individuals desire this counseling, recent studies indicate only a minority of TGD AYAs 
have these discussions with their healthcare teams.9,34 A recent survey of medical and 
mental health providers indicated that clinicians lacked knowledge of the reproductive health 
needs of TGD AYAs;9 inconsistently discussed family building options;9,18 and perceived 
counseling challenges due to a number of factors. These barriers included developmental 
factors related to counseling younger adolescents; knowledge limitations due to lack of data 
on long-term effects of hormonal interventions on fertility; and concerns about costs and 
invasiveness of fertility preservation interventions. A prevailing thought among respondents 
was the TGD AYAs were hyper-focused on their transition and access to gender affirming 
care, and were not interested in fertility preservation; further, clinicians in the United States 
felt the financial costs of fertility preservation were unaffordable for most families. Many 
respondents expressed a desire for more training.9,18 Importantly, increased knowledge is 
associated with increased frequency of counseling, and multiple studies document low levels 
of knowledge among clinicians caring for TGD AYAs.73–76

Regarding sexual health and STI prevention, studies show clinician awareness of PrEP for 
TGD AYA is low, particularly among clinicians who have small numbers of TGD AYA 
in their patient populations.77,78 Recommendations for HPV vaccine vary by age, sexual 
orientation and sex assigned at birth.59,79 There is little data on uptake of the HPV vaccine 
or rates of offering the vaccine to TGD youth. A recent study suggests providers might be 
offering the HPV vaccine based on presumed risk on the basis of sex assigned at birth vs. 
gender identity.80 Improving clinicians’ ability to sensitively take a sexual history and utilize 
cultural humility in counseling and treating TGD AYA may therefore increase offering and 
uptake of HPV vaccine in this group.

DISCUSSION

Strategies for improving reproductive health counseling practices

As outlined above, comprehensive reproductive health counseling for TGD AYAs should 
include discussions about: youths’ reproductive health goals; contraception use and safer sex 
practices; implications of gender-affirming hormonal and surgical interventions on fertility, 
sexual function and satisfaction; relationship safety and exposure to risks (e.g., sex work), 
violence and trauma; and preventive care to preserve reproductive health. Additionally, 
clinicians need to be sensitive to the specific needs and elevated reproductive health risks of 
TGD AYA with multiple minoritized identities.

With a steadily increasing number of TGD youth seeking hormonal interventions at earlier 
ages,6,81 these discussions are becoming more clinically and ethically complex. Beyond 
structural barriers such as cost, clinicians must address the AYA’s competing demands 
(i.e. urgency to start treatment) and developmental factors, in addition to family dynamics 
(e.g. discordance between AYAs’ and parents’ perspectives) and access barriers.65,82,83 
Additionally, clinicians are often tasked with providing education about topics AYAs do not 
view as important, such as contraceptive options, or that they are not well trained to address, 
such as sexual and other interpersonal violence.84–86 Given the numerous challenges and 
the sensitive nature of these topics, clinicians must be both knowledgeable and skilled at 
building rapport and trust with TGD AYAs.87 For example, inquiring about chosen names

and pronouns, using preferred terms for body parts and reproductive anatomy, approaching 
physical exams/procedures with caution and, as warranted, employing trauma sensitive 
approaches, are all necessary aspects of reproductive health encounters with TGD AYAs.

Recent research shows communication skills and confidence in reproductive health 
counseling are suboptimal for clinicians who provide care to TGD AYAs.88,89 Web-based 
training in reproductive health with other populations (e.g., oncology) demonstrates efficacy 
for improving communication skills and confidence in counseling, and for reaching 
clinicians in rural or under-resourced areas who may have difficulty accessing desired 
reproductive health training.88,90–92 Enhancing reproductive health counseling with TGD 
AYAs would improve the quality and sensitivity of care, reduce mistrust, increase 
satisfaction with health services and safety for youth, and optimize TGD AYA reproductive 
health outcomes. These programs should be geared towards a heterogeneous group of 
clinicians, as both medical (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners) and mental health (e.g., 
psychologists, social workers) clinicians, play important roles in the reproductive health care 
of all AYAs.91,92

Specific training needs may vary between groups – medical providers may have more 
knowledge in some domains (e.g., implications of medical/surgical interventions on fertility) 
whereas mental health providers may be more comfortable exploring patient priorities, 
taking into account cultural, social, developmental, and mental health considerations. 
However, certain topics such as health literacy are important for both provider groups. If 
clinicians use language that does not make sense to the patient this can create mistrust 
and contribute to non-adherence to treatment plans.93 Patient educational materials should 
be tested and assessed for health literacy by the demographic groups for which they are 
intended.

Communication training for medical and mental health clinicians can be enhanced by 
using talking points and scripts. Talking points may be helpful for initiating conversations 
on a topic that may be uncomfortable for both the clinician and patient, and could 
ensure consistency of messages across patients. Table 1 provides a list of objectives 
and talking points related to reproductive health topics.94 Counseling approaches should 
consider that many TGD AYAs may be highly anxious, traumatized, dysphoric and (at 
least initially) distrustful during these conversations, and eager to proceed with medical 
intervention.95 At the same time, TGD AYAs often have high levels of resilience.96 
A multi-disciplinary approach should be used to approach these discussions prior to 
initiation of medical interventions, and on an ongoing basis thereafter. In addition to 
addressing fertility, contraception, sexual function and STI prevention, any training on 
reproductive health counseling targeting TGD AYAs should include training on cultural 
sensitivity, as well as safety screening and counseling related to sexual assault, violence 
in interpersonal relationships, and referrals for self-protection and advocacy (e.g., domestic 
violence advocacy programs geared toward the needs of TGD AYAs). In summary, enriched 
communication training for clinicians is necessary to provide a skilled workforce for the 
TGD AYA population.

Priorities for future research

Clinical research is needed to better understand reproductive health goals and risks in 
TGD AYAs across ages and developmental stages. Perspectives of parents/caregivers (for 
adolescents) and partners should also be examined. The exponentially greater health risks 
associated with multiple minoritized identities requires research to identify the reproductive 
health experiences and barriers for members of the TGD AYA community who are most 
marginalized. These studies may be more difficult to undertake given that TGD AYA facing 
the most barriers to healthcare may be harder to recruit as much of this research takes 
place in academic clinic settings. Researchers have highlighted the need for intersectional 
frameworks to account for health inequities in transgender populations. For instance, the 
Intersectionality for Transgender Health Justice (ITHJ) framework specifies steps to guide 
researchers seeking to study transgender health to understand and disrupt power structures 
impeding adequate health care.17

There is great need to expand patient focused research on improving our understanding 
of issues of well-being surgical outcomes at different stages of transition for TGD AYAs. 
For example, transgender men who begin pubertal suppression at early stages of puberty 
may feel less need for follow-up mastectomies, or require less invasive mastectomies than 
those who do not take pubertal suppression. However, while there are advantages to early 
intervention, the limited phallic growth associated with puberty blockers in transgender 
women has implications for vaginoplasty, if desired at a later point, due to reduced penile 
growth and occasionally insufficient tissue to perform this feminizing surgery. Instead, 
additional tissue may be required from another part of the body, often intestinal tissue. 
Due to these complexities, counseling about potential impacts of pubertal suppression on 
future aspects of gender affirming medical care should account for various considerations 
and outcomes.97 There is a dearth of understanding about the extent to which each type of 
gender affirming treatment and the timing of the treatments by age positively or negatively 
affects sexual practices and satisfaction.

In addition to patient focused research, research with the clinical community is critically 
needed to understand: 1) best modalities for mental health and medical provider 
training; and 2) documentation of practice improvements based on trainings. Evidence­
based strategies are needed to facilitate developmentally, culturally and trauma sensitive 
counseling practices among TGD AYAs to mitigate potential distress and regret, , including 
those that may be associated with fertility loss after treatment. While regret and distress 
are well-documented in other AYA populations (e.g., those with cancer),98–102 we cannot 
assume TGD AYAs will have the same perspectives. Research with older adults who have 
transitioned is needed to determine if these negative feelings may be anticipated by TGD 
AYA youth in the future, to better inform counseling practices across the care continuum.

Recommended Reproductive Health Talking Points (adapted from Santa Maria et al94)

Table 1

Topic

Talking Points

Strategies

Private 
consultation

Request time alone with minors to discuss sexual 
health topics privately.

“I would like to have a few moments with you alone. Would that 
be okay?” Assure the youth that information will not be shared with 
the parent unless specifically required by law, such as in the case of 
abuse or suicidal ideation.

Sexual 
orientation

Inquire about sexual orientation, Provide local 
resources for counseling and peer support.

“Are you sexually attracted to men, women, transgender people or 
neither?”

Gender Identity

Inquire about how the youth identifies with 
regard to gender. Inquire about pronouns and 
offer your own.

“I’m Dr. Smith, my pronouns are she/her – what are your 
pronouns?”
“Do you identify as a man? Woman? Transgender” non-binary? 
Genderqueer/gender fluid or something else?”

HPV vaccination

Recommend HPV vaccination and support 
completion of the series.

“Have you started the HPV vaccine series to protect against various 
cancers and diseases caused by HPV?”

Fertility

Identify if potential infertility is a concern.
Provider referrals to reproductive endocrinology.

“Have you thought about having a biological child in the future? 
Do you know how hormones may affect your ability to create a 
pregnancy?”

High-risk sexual 
situations

Discuss anticipation of high-risk sexual 
situations, refusal and negotiation skills, role of 
alcohol and drugs in sexual behavior, and setting 
and maintaining personal boundaries.

Role-play scenarios such as parties, going out with friends who use 
drugs or alcohol, someone wanting to go farther sexually than you 
do. “Who can you go to where you work or live if you don’t feel 
safe?”

Healthy 
relationships, 
dating violence, 
safety and 
trauma

Condom and 
contraceptive use

STI/HIV testing

Inquire about coercive sex, dating violence, 
healthy relationships, safety at home and school, 
and sexual abuse. Inquire about whether past 
victimization experiences interfere with current 
sexual comfort and/or current well-being.
Provide education about and information 
regarding sexual assault and interpersonal 
violence services, as well as trauma interventions 
as needed

Educate on the efficacy and correct use of 
various contraceptive methods and on the need 
for another method with condom use. Discuss 
pregnancy and other risks of sexual activity. 
Support informed decision making and access to 
condoms and contraceptives.

Discuss recommendations for STI and HIV 
screening for sexually actives and the importance 
of partner testing and treatment if results are 
positive. Assess high-risk adolescents for the 
appropriateness of PrEP and PEP.

“Have you ever been hit, punched, slapped, made fun of, teased, or 
pressured where you work or where you live?
“Have you ever engaged in unwanted sexual activity?”

“Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?” 
Respond accordingly with pregnancy prevention counseling (see 
www.onekeyquestion.org).

“Have you had sex? Have you been sexually active with a person 
with a penis? Or a vagina? Have you had sex with a new partner? 
Have you and your partner been tested for HIV and STIs?” Role­
play discussing testing with a future sexual partner. “How many 
times did you have vaginal or anal sex where a condom wasn’t used? 
How many of your partners were HIV positive? ”

HPV = human papillomavirus; PEP = postexposure prophylaxis; PrEP = preexposure prophylaxis; STI = sexually transmitted infection.
