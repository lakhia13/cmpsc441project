REVIEW

CURRENTOPINION Suicide prevention efforts in the United States and

their effectiveness

Amy Barnhorsta,b,c,d, Hilary Gonzalesa,b,d, and Rameesha Asif-Sattara,b,d

Purpose of review
Suicide is a serious public health problem in the United States, and suicide rates have been increasing for
more than a decade. Rural areas are more impacted than urban areas, reinforcing that social, cultural,
and economic factors contribute to risk. This article reviews recent work about these contributors to suicide
and how they may inform prevention efforts.

Recent findings
Current research has shown that suicide is more than a mental health problem with a psychiatric or
medical solution. Universal screening and referral by gatekeepers target a large group with a low baseline
risk, and there are few treatments proven to reduce death by suicide, as well as a severe shortage of
mental health providers in the United States to provide them. Instead, suicide prevention polices can target
various other factors that contribute to elevated suicide risk at the population level, including reducing
socioeconomic deprivation and access to firearms, both of which are often higher in rural areas. Internet-
based interventions also hold promise as they are highly scalable, accessible almost anywhere, and often
anonymous.

Summary
Understanding factors that increase suicide risk guide development of evidence-based policies targeted at
high-risk groups. Population-level interventions should be developed in collaboration with the target
audience for cultural appropriateness.

INTRODUCTION
Suicide is a serious public health problem in the
United States, with 48,344 Americans taking their
own lives in 2018. It is a leading cause of death
across all age groups, and the second most common
cause among young adults ages 10 to 34 years. For
each completed suicide, an estimated 29 attempts
are made [1,2]. The suicide rates in the United States
rose nearly 30% from 1999 to 2016 [3], and con-
tinues to increase.

However, rates of suicide are not evenly distrib-
uted across the nation. Rates in the most rural areas
were higher initially in 1999 and accelerated more
quickly beginning around 2007 [3]. Alaska and
states in the intermountain west (Wyoming, Mon-
tana, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and New Mexico) have
the highest rates of suicide nationally, and are
among the most rural [4]. This finding is corrobo-
rated by a study that looked at rates in youth from
1996 to 2010. It found higher rates of youth suicides
in rural areas than in urban. This disparity increased

over the study period, and the use of firearms was
more prevalent in rural areas [5].

Suicide is also unevenly distributed across dem-
ographics. The lowest rates are among Blacks, His-
panics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, with higher rates
among whites [3]. American Indian and Alaska

The impact of urbanization on mental health

KEY POINTS

(cid:2) Suicide is a problem with psychiatric, social, economic,

and cultural roots, thus prevention efforts must be
accordingly broad in their approach.

(cid:2) Rural areas in the United States have higher rates of

suicide, likely reflecting higher rates of economic and
social deprivation, and higher rates of access
to firearms.

(cid:2) Individual prevention efforts that provide frequent check-

ins or other contact, internet-based therapy, or
screening and referral to services show promise for
rural areas especially those that are easily scalable and
offer a degree of anonymity (iCBT).

(cid:2) The efficacy of screening and referring for suicide

prevention may be limited by the severe shortage of
providers and facilities in rural areas.

(cid:2) Lethal means safety has been consistently shown to
reduce suicides and must be culturally sensitive and
acceptable to the target audience: gun owners.

urban areas have the highest rates by race/ethnicity;
suicide is the second leading cause of death in this
group [6].

Firearms continue to be a considerable contribu-
tor to suicide rates in the United States. Age-adjusted
firearm suicide rates, along with non-firearm sui-
cides, increased almost every year during the time
period of 2007 to 2018. Age-adjusted firearm suicide
rates also increased with increasing county rurality,
and were higher among men and older adults [7&].
This overall rural–urban disparity in suicide risk
in the United States likely reflects multiple cultural,
social, and economic factors that contribute to sui-
cide risk, in general. It also has important implica-
tions for prevention efforts.

EVIDENCE FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION
PROGRAMS AND APPLICABILITY TO
RURAL AREAS
Many of the suicide prevention programs in which
we have invested heavily as a nation lack good
studies supporting their efficacy, likely because of
a combination of factors. First, suicide is a relatively
rare event, and investigations can be difficult to
design in a way that would detect a change in the
outcome studied (suicide deaths).

Second, many programs focus on gatekeeper
training (GKT) and subsequent referral of people
at risk into a system of care. This requires extensive
training of gatekeepers, retention and utilization of
the information taught, and a system which has the
capacity to accept and treat the referred patients.

There is little support for their efficacy in the United
States as the intervention is aimed at a large group of
people with a low base rate of suicide. Trained gate-
keepers have few opportunities to use their skills,
which then degrade over time. One potential way to
address this is to identify and train gatekeepers who
are motivated to voluntarily acquire such training
and focus on training those who work with a higher
risk segment of the public [8&&].

(78%),

A systematic review of the long-term efficacy of
such programs was conducted and 23 articles met
the following inclusion criteria: studies involved a
suicide-specific program intervention, and pre-
training, post-training, and follow-up training must
have been delivered to general members of the
community. Knowledge of how to identify an at-
risk individual and intervene was the most continu-
ous outcome measured in the included GKT evalua-
tions
followed by self-efficacy (70%).
Behavioral intention and attitude towards suicide
risk assessment and intervention were measured in
35% and 29% of the included articles, respectively.
The highest rates of improvement were seen on
measures of knowledge and self-efficacy, though
these both decreased over time, with less impact
on provider attitudes. The improved knowledge and
self-efficacy, however, did not translate well to a
change in behavior (i.e. more interventions). The
authors conclude that GKT may have a larger impact
on behavior if it can change the attitudes of the
provider in addition to increasing their knowledge
and self-efficacy [8&&].

These types of approaches have been shown to
be promising for reducing suicides in the US military
as well as in other nations [9&,10&]. However,
another shortcoming of their use for the general
population of the United States is that once people
at risk are identified, there is often not a coordinated
system of care to respond to their needs. Due to lack
of provider availability, fragmented systems of care,
and lack of insurance coverage, referrals to services
often do not translate to receiving services. This
problem may be even further exacerbated in rural
areas, where mental health professionals are in dire
shortage. Additionally, the ‘rugged individualism’
mentality in many such areas may decrease people’s
willingness to access care when it is available.

A third factor may be the overall lack of effective
treatments. Despite 1 in 10 Americans taking them,
there is no evidence that antidepressants like SSRIs
reduce suicide. Lithium and clozapine have been
shown to reduce suicides in bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia, respectively [11&,12]. However, these
disorders are relatively rare, and while they each carry
an elevated risk of suicide, they constitute only a
small number of people over all who end their lives.

One treatment that has been shown to be effec-
tive in reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors is
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT, including a
specific subtype called dialectical behavioral therapy
(DBT), is a structured, manualized therapy practice
that requires consistent engagement for multiple
weeks. Access to long-term weekly therapy can be a
barrier to many patients for financial and logistical
reasons, and therapists are often in short supply.
However, internet-based cognitive behavioral ther-
apy (iCBT) shows promise in reaching a larger audi-
ence, particularly in rural areas where the few mental
health providers may be long distances away.

One recent meta-analysis examined six unique
randomized clinical trials of 1567 participants. Eli-
gible RCTs used internet-based self-help interven-
tions (ISIs) that directly targeted suicidal ideation,
were primarily delivered online, and were based on
psychological elements. Additional inclusion crite-
ria included control groups receiving usual treat-
ment, placebo, no intervention, active or passive
treatment, or a wait-list group. All eligible studies
had to report a quantitative measure of a suicide-
specific outcome. Individuals who met a threshold
measure of suicidality participated in an online
program that targeted suicidal ideation or behaviors
with a psychological framework.

Two of the treatments in the analysis were
‘guided’, meaning part of the program was admin-
istered by a therapist, whereas the rest were entirely
online. The treatments consisted largely of home-
work modules that focused on anxiety reduction,
mood regulation, and modification of automatic
thoughts. The authors found that participants in
the
showed significantly
reduced suicidal ideation after intervention com-
pared with controls [13&&]. An Australian meta-anal-
ysis of self-guided digital interventions targeted at
reducing suicidality found a similar reduction in
suicidal ideation [14&]. These trials did not measure
a reduction in suicide deaths overall.

iCBT interventions

Unguided iCBT programs show particular prom-
ise as they are highly scalable to reach large numbers
of people with suicidal ideation, thus are feasible,
low-risk, economical interventions even with a high
number needed to treat (NNT). Additionally, people
with suicidal ideation may be more likely to accept
anonymous, online interventions than in-person
care. This may be an especially important approach
in rural communities with few providers [13&&].

BACKGROUND INFO ON ELEVATION IN
RURAL AREAS
One recent cross-sectional study examined adult
suicide rates by county in the United States and

how they changed during 1999 to 2016. For the
purposes of this study, rural–urban continuum
codes (RUCC) were condensed to the following four
categories: large metropolitan counties, small met-
ropolitan counties, micropolitan counties, and rural
counties. They also created indices for societal fac-
tors known to contribute to suicidal ideation at an
individual
level. These included a deprivation
index, which took into account level of education,
unemployment rates, income, poverty, and use of
public assistance; a social capital index, which took
into account arts, nature, and sports facilities, and
civic, social, and religious organizations; and a social
fragmentation index that took into account number
of renters, housing turnover, and single residents.
They also measured age, sex, race/ethnicity, number
of veterans, amount of health insurance coverage,
and number of gun retailers in each county.

The authors found an increase in suicide rates in
all county types, and with the greatest and most
rapid increase in more rural counties. The regions
with the highest rates were the intermountain west,
Appalachia, and the Ozarks. An increase in county-
level suicide rates was also associated with higher
deprivation, higher social
lower
social capital, higher availability of gun shops,
and a greater proportion of veterans and an unin-
sured population residing within a county. Increases
in the presence of gun shops had a stronger associa-
tion on the increase in suicide rate in urban counties
than it did in rural ones, though in general, more
gun shops were associated with more suicides [15&&].

fragmentation,

OTHER RISK FACTORS
Suicide is commonly perceived as a psychiatric prob-
lem, and solutions are sought through mental
health avenues. However, there is little evidence
to support such a one-dimensional approach. Psy-
chiatric disorders are not more prevalent in rural
areas of the United States [16]. Therefore, other
factors that vary between rural and urban areas,
including those discussed in Steelsmith, et al.
(2019), must contribute to the higher rates of
suicide.

Access to care
One possible contributor is lack of access to mental
health services. Although the prevalence of mental
health disorders may not be higher in rural areas,
access to practitioners is much more limited. In rural
US counties, there are approximately 2.2 psychia-
trists per 100 000 people, in contrast to 612 psychia-
trists per 100 000 people in New York [17&]. Eighty
percent of rural counties have no psychiatrist at all,

and 94% have no community mental health facili-
ties [18,19]. This means that not only is it difficult
for residents to access treatment for disorders that
increase their risk of suicide, there are few hospitals
for them to go to in times of suicidal crises.

One study examined behavioral health treat-
ment capacity (measured by behavioral health
workers) over time and across the United States,
and compared it with changes in firearm suicide
rates. Using the state-year as the unit of analysis,
authors gathered data from five nationally represen-
tative health and labor surveys to construct a state-
year panel of repeated cross-sections for the 50 states
and the District of Columbia. The final data set
covered three-time intervals, 2005, 2010, and
2015 with 153 state-level observations. Number of
firearm suicides, obtained from WISQARS, was the
primary dependent variable. Measured per state-
year, the annual behavioral health workforce size
was the primary explanatory variable of interest.
This measure was composed using occupational
codes (e.g. clinical, counseling, and school psychol-
ogists or substance abuse and behavioral disorder
counselors) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Occupational Employment Statistics program. Addi-
tionally, study authors examined the annual num-
ber of outpatient substance use treatment facilities
using data from National Survey of Substance Abuse
Treatment Services. They concluded that for every
10% increase in the mental health workforce, there
was a 1.2% reduction in firearm suicides, the most
common method of suicide in the United States.
Given the difficulties in achieving that scale of
workforce increase, they suggest that focusing on
reducing high-risk people’s access to firearms would
be a more immediate and more economical
approach [20&&].

interventions

A meta-analysis of 14 brief suicide prevention
interventions indicated some promise for reducing
future attempts. Of these 14 articles, 7 were analyzed
for subsequent suicide attempts, 9 for linkage to
follow-up care, and 6 for depressive symptoms at
follow-up visits. The
analyzed
included four main components: brief contact (tele-
phone calls, handwritten notes, text messages), care
coordination (scheduling follow-up outpatient
mental health appointments), safety planning,
and other brief therapies. Validated patient self-
reporting and medical record review were used to
measure subsequent attempts and linkage to follow-
up care. Pooled data showed that such brief inter-
ventions reduced number of subsequent suicide
attempts and increased contact with follow-up care,
though no effect was seen on the third outcome
studied, depressive symptoms. Two of the studies
took place outside the United States, four were in the

Veteran’s Administration, and three were in a pedi-
atric setting. The settings are significant, as connect-
ing patients at risk with providers and mental health
systems was a primary strength of the interventions,
and these connections may be more readily accessi-
ble to those populations than to the general adult
population of the United States [21&&].

Firearms
Access to firearms is an important independent risk
factor for suicide. Firearms are used in less than 10%
of suicide attempts but more than half of completed
suicides. This is largely because of the high-case
fatality rate of guns: approximately 90% of attempts
made with a firearm are fatal, compared with less
than 5% of overdose attempts [22&].

States with higher rates of firearm ownership and
fewer regulations governing firearms have higher
suicide rates, though this relationship may not be
causal [23]. However, one study showed that after
other factors were accounted for, the presence of a
firearm in the home increased the risk of suicide of
one of the household members by a factor of 3.2 [24].
Another study found that this relationship between
firearm ownership and suicide was twice as strong
among adolescents as it was for adults [25&&].

LETHAL MEANS ACCESS REDUCTION
As the multiple contributing factors to suicidality
can be difficult to identify and address before a
person makes an attempt, one of the most effective
ways to reduce suicide is to ensure that any attempts
made will not be lethal. Various strategies can be
employed to put time and distance between a per-
son at risk of suicide and their firearms. These range
from temporary, voluntary relinquishment to invol-
untary removal and purchase prohibition. Known as
lethal means restriction or lethal means safety,
decreasing people’s access to methods of suicide
with high fatality rates has been shown to be an
effective method of suicide prevention at
the
individual level.

One study used population and firearm data
from the US Census to derive a simulated US
firearm-owning households
national sample of
where youth reside. They conducted a Monte Carlo
simulation, a quantitative risk analysis technique,
using 2015 data on youth (0–19 years of age) firearm
injury. Study authors
suicide and unintentional
created a death indicator variable equal to the num-
ber of observed 2015 youth firearm suicides
(n ¼ 1017) and youth unintentional firearm deaths
(n ¼ 100). They used this modeling to test a hypo-
thetical intervention, safe storage of firearms in the

home, then estimated the reduction in youth fire-
arm suicide and unintentional death by firearm if
firearms in the home had been stored locked and
unloaded by adults in the households. Findings
from the modeling suggest that if 20% of house-
holds locked all household firearms, then youth
firearm deaths (which are mostly suicides) would
decline by up to 32%. This study underscores the
importance of discussing safe storage of firearms in
the home with parents [26&&].

Counseling patients about access to lethal
means is often framed within the context of healthy
lifestyle advice, much as pediatricians might coun-
sel about car seats, swimming pools or bicycle hel-
mets. However,
significant
differences. Firearms are viewed by many as more
than just a tool; they are also symbolic for many
owners. Firearms are an important part of their
identity and represent values like freedom, indepen-
dence, and the ability to keep themselves and their
family safe. Understanding this is crucial for pro-
viders who wish to advise about safe storage or other
risk-reducing interventions.

some

One study assessed the relationship between
reasons for firearm ownership and the belief that
firearms contribute to suicide risk, the willingness to
safely store or remove firearms to reduce that risk,
and storage methods. Researchers asked a sample of
300 American firearm owners (53.0% men; 82.3%
white; Mage ¼ 36.11, age range ¼ 20–69 years) to com-
plete an online survey. Self-protection was the most
commonly cited reason for ownership, reported by
65.3% of survey respondents. Approximately 19%
reported owning a gun for hunting or other recrea-
tional purposes [27&&]. This finding is consistent with
that of a second study, which showed that recrea-
tional gun ownership in the United States has
decreased over the last two decades, while ownership
for self-protection has increased and is now the most
common reason [28&].

The first study also found that overall, few gun
owners believed that firearm ownership and storage
practices were linked to suicide risk. This belief was
significantly lower among those who owned a gun
for protection compared with those who owned for
other purposes. Those who owned for protection
were also less willing to engage in lethal means
safety practices, such as storing firearms securely
or removing them from the home, and were more
likely to store their guns loaded [27&&].

This study highlights the importance of cultur-
ally specific counseling about lethal means safety
with firearm owners. Clinicians should first estab-
lish the context of why they are initiating such a
conversation, and that it is about health and safety,
not politics. They should then seek to understand

the reasons the person owns firearms, and the mean-
ing of guns to them. Then they should take a col-
laborative, tailored approach that respects the needs
and belief system of the person at risk.

One survey-based study sought to determine,
which culturally specific suicide prevention mes-
sages would be more effective at restricting firearm
access during suicidal crises for those who are politi-
cally conservative, champion gun rights, and live in
rural areas. The authors conducted focus groups and
interviews with rural gun owners to help them craft
a culturally appropriate message about suicide pre-
vention and firearm access. Results showed that gun
owners, especially those individuals who strongly
identified as conservatives and advocated for gun
rights, were most impacted by culturally-specific
messaging on voluntarily reducing firearm access,
compared to other interventions. Therefore, it is
essential to use a culturally specific framework for
public health messaging to reach at-risk populations
when promoting firearm restriction for suicide pre-
vention. [29&&].

psychoeducation-based

In order to study firearm-specific lethal means
safety interventions, a pilot RCT enrolled 96 college
students between 18 and 31 years of age who had a
history of suicidal ideation and were familiar with
firearms. Each was randomized to one of four dif-
ferent
interventions.
Interventions varied in the level to which they
appealed to fear and in their emphasis on tempo-
rariness. The four intervention groups were as fol-
lows: group 1 (low fear/low temporariness), group 2
(low fear/high temporariness), group 3 (high fear/
low temporariness), and group 4 (high fear/high
temporariness). All four intervention approaches
in the study were rated by participants as acceptable
but those in groups that focused on temporariness
rather than fear, especially in group 2 (low fear/
high temporariness), reported significantly greater
intentions to limit access to firearms for safety
purposes. This finding suggests that interventions
emphasizing the temporary nature of separation
from firearms creates more acceptable messaging
for people at risk [30&&].

The

importance of

culturally competent
approaches to suicide prevention reaches beyond
messaging lethal means safety for gun owners. Sui-
cide has social, biological, and cultural origins, and
just as the contributors are heterogenous and situa-
tional, so should be the solutions. Approaches tai-
lored for urban LGBTQþ youth will not likely have
the same impact on older white men in rural areas.
Research on suicide prevention programs for Native
America communities and veterans supports the
importance of culturally tailored interventions
[31,32].

The impact of urbanization on mental health

CONCLUSION
People arrive at the decision to end their life for a
variety of reasons and over a variety of timeframes.
Reducing suicide is a problem with diverse solutions;
there is no one-size fits-all intervention that will be
effective across broad demographics, geographic
areas, and risk factors. Although focusing efforts on
risk factors like substance use disorders, depression,
poverty, and social disconnectedness is laudable,
solutions will be difficult, expensive, and delayed.
Restricting people’s access to lethal means, regardless
of what causes their suicidality, is a proven method
for reducing deaths by suicide. This is particularly
true for firearms, which cause over half the suicide
deaths in this country, particularly in rural areas.
Messages about putting time and distance between
an at-risk person and their guns must be culturally
tailored and appropriate. Internet-based CBT may
also be a feasible intervention in areas with severe
shortages of mental health providers.

Health Affairs (Project Hope) 2019; 38:1711–1718.

This time-series cross-sectional analysis underscores lack of access to treatment as
a contributor to increased risk of suicide. The study found that according to their
modeling, increasing the mental health treatment capacity in each state could reduce
ﬁrearm suicide rates, though the return on investment was small as compared with the
potential effect of ﬁrearm-focused lethal means safety initiatives.

interventions with subsequent suicide attempts, linkage to follow-up care, and
depression symptoms for acute care settings: a systematic review and meta-
analysis. JAMA Psychiatry 2020; 77:1021–1030.

This systematic review showed that brief
interventions delivered in a single
encounter reduced the number of subsequent suicide attempts and increased
patient engagement in follow-up mental healthcare. Therefore, the results of the
review provides important evidence that brief suicide prevention efforts in acute
care settings show promise for reducing risk of suicide attempts.

This study analyzed the association of ﬁrearm ownership and suicide between
adolescents and adults resulting in two times stronger association of ﬁrearm
ownership and suicide among adolescents relative to adults. Alternately, policies
mandating safe ﬁrearm storage was associated with reduced ﬁrearm suicide in
adolescents. This highlights access to ﬁrearms in the home is a risk factor for
suicide, especially among adolescents. If ﬁrearms are in the home, the risk of
suicide can be reduced by safely storing all ﬁrearms.

ﬁrearm storage with ﬁrearm suicide and unintentional death among US youths.
JAMA Pediatr 2019; 173:657–662.

Researchers used modeling to quantify the effect of adults in a home with ﬁrearms
practicing safe ﬁrearm storage, and calculated that increasing safe storage by merely
20% could approximately prevent up to 32% of ﬁrearm deaths among US youth by
suicide and unintentional ﬁrearm injury. This underscores the importance of safe
ﬁrearm storage in the home to reduce the risk of child and adolescent suicide.

This survey study on gun owners found that those who owned a ﬁrearm for
protection were less likely to engage in lethal means safety practice, store their
ﬁrearm loaded, and have lower beliefs that ﬁrearm ownership and storage
practices were linked to the risk of suicide.
It highlights the signiﬁcance of
understanding gun culture and the need to have culturally appropriate and
respectful conversations about lethal means safety with ﬁrearm owners.

This survey-based study uncovered that a culturally competent suicide prevention
message about voluntary ﬁrearm restriction was more impactful on gun owners,
especially those who identiﬁed as conservatives and advocated for gun rights. It
highlights the importance of implementing a culturally appropriate and respectful
framework in interventions for at-risk populations aimed at promoting ﬁrearm
restriction for suicide prevention.

of a lethal means safety intervention for young adults with ﬁrearm familiarity at
risk for suicide. J Consult Clin Psychol 2020; 88:372–383.

This randomized control trial examined the acceptability and efﬁcacy of lethal
means safety interventions by examining different methods that varied by
level of fear appeals and emphasis on temporariness. Participants in the
group that emphasized low fear and high temporariness reported the highest
likelihood of following recommendations. In order to gain buy-in from ﬁrearm
owners, interventions should deemphasize fear and emphasize temporari-
ness.
