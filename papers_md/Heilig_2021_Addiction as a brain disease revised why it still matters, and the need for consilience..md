The view that substance addiction is a brain disease, although widely accepted in the neuroscience community, has become
subject to acerbic criticism in recent years. These criticisms state that the brain disease view is deterministic, fails to account for
heterogeneity in remission and recovery, places too much emphasis on a compulsive dimension of addiction, and that a speciﬁc
neural signature of addiction has not been identiﬁed. We acknowledge that some of these criticisms have merit, but assert that the
foundational premise that addiction has a neurobiological basis is fundamentally sound. We also emphasize that denying that
addiction is a brain disease is a harmful standpoint since it contributes to reducing access to healthcare and treatment, the
consequences of which are catastrophic. Here, we therefore address these criticisms, and in doing so provide a contemporary
update of the brain disease view of addiction. We provide arguments to support this view, discuss why apparently spontaneous
remission does not negate it, and how seemingly compulsive behaviors can co-exist with the sensitivity to alternative
reinforcement in addiction. Most importantly, we argue that the brain is the biological substrate from which both addiction and the
capacity for behavior change arise, arguing for an intensiﬁed neuroscientiﬁc study of recovery. More broadly, we propose that these
disagreements reveal the need for multidisciplinary research that integrates neuroscientiﬁc, behavioral, clinical, and sociocultural
perspectives.

INTRODUCTION
Close to a quarter of a century ago, then director of the US
National Institute on Drug Abuse Alan Leshner famously asserted
that “addiction is a brain disease”, articulated a set of implications
of this position, and outlined an agenda for realizing its promise
[1]. The paper, now cited almost 2000 times, put forward a
position that has been highly inﬂuential in guiding the efforts of
researchers, and resource allocation by funding agencies. A
subsequent 2000 paper by McLellan et al. [2] examined whether
data justify distinguishing addiction from other conditions for
which a disease label
is rarely questioned, such as diabetes,
hypertension or asthma. It concluded that neither genetic risk, the
role of personal choices, nor the inﬂuence of environmental
factors differentiated addiction in a manner that would warrant
viewing it differently; neither did relapse rates, nor compliance
with treatment. The authors outlined an agenda closely related to
that put forward by Leshner, but with a more clinical focus. Their
conclusion was that addiction should be insured, treated, and
evaluated like other diseases. This paper,
too, has been
exceptionally inﬂuential by academic standards, as witnessed by
its ~3000 citations to date. What may be less appreciated among

scientists is that its impact in the real world of addiction treatment
has remained more limited, with large numbers of patients still
not receiving evidence-based treatments.

the brain disease view was mainly an attempt

In recent years, the conceptualization of addiction as a brain
disease has come under increasing criticism. When ﬁrst put
forward,
to
articulate an effective response to prevailing nonscientiﬁc,
moralizing, and stigmatizing attitudes to addiction. According to
these attitudes, addiction was simply the result of a person’s moral
failing or weakness of character, rather than a “real” disease [3].
These attitudes created barriers for people with substance use
problems to access evidence-based treatments, both those
available at
the time, such as opioid agonist maintenance,
cognitive behavioral therapy-based relapse prevention, commu-
nity reinforcement or contingency management, and those that
could result
from research. To promote patient access to
treatments, scientists needed to argue that there is a biological
basis beneath the challenging behaviors of individuals suffering
from addiction. This argument was particularly targeted to the
public, policymakers and health care professionals, many of whom
held that since addiction was a misery people brought upon

the conceptualization of
addiction as a brain disease is of a very different nature.
It
originates from within the scientiﬁc community itself, and asserts
that this conceptualization is neither supported by data, nor
helpful for people with substance use problems [4–8]. Addressing
these critiques requires a very different perspective, and is the
objective of our paper. We readily acknowledge that in some
cases, recent critiques of the notion of addiction as a brain disease
as postulated originally have merit, and that those critiques
require the postulates to be re-assessed and reﬁned.
In other
cases, we believe the arguments have less validity, but still provide
an opportunity to update the position of addiction as a brain
disease. Our overarching concern is that questionable arguments
against the notion of addiction as a brain disease may harm
patients, by impeding access to care, and slowing development of
novel treatments.

A premise of our argument is that any useful conceptualization
of addiction requires an understanding both of
the brains
involved, and of environmental factors that interact with those
brains [9]. These environmental factors critically include availability
of drugs, but also of healthy alternative rewards and opportunities.
As we will show, stating that brain mechanisms are critical for
understanding and treating addiction in no way negates the role
of psychological, social and socioeconomic processes as both
causes and consequences of substance use. To reﬂect
this
complex nature of addiction, we have assembled a team with
expertise that spans from molecular neuroscience, through animal
models of addiction, human brain imaging, clinical addiction

passionate commitment to improving the lives of people with

together

To achieve this goal, we ﬁrst discuss the nature of the disease
concept itself, and why we believe it is important for the science
and treatment of addiction. This is followed by a discussion of
the main points raised when the notion of addiction as a brain
disease has come under criticism. Key among those are claims that

pathology is lacking; and that people suffering from addiction,

process of discussing these issues, we also address the common
criticism that viewing addiction as a brain disease is a fully
deterministic theory of addiction. For our argument, we use the
term “addiction” as originally used by Leshner [1]; in Box 1, we
map out and discuss how this construct may relate to the current
diagnostic categories, such as Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and
its different levels of severity (Fig. 1).

Box 1 What’s in a name? Differentiating hazardous use,
substance use disorder, and addiction
Although our principal focus is on the brain disease model of addiction, the
deﬁnition of addiction itself is a source of ambiguity. Here, we provide a
perspective on the major forms of terminology in the ﬁeld.
Hazardous Substance Use
Hazardous (risky) substance use refers to quantitative levels of consumption that
increase an individual’s risk for adverse health consequences. In practice, this
pertains to alcohol use [110, 111]. Clinically, alcohol consumption that exceeds
guidelines for moderate drinking has been used to prompt brief interventions or
referral for specialist care [112]. More recently, a reduction in these quantitative
levels has been validated as treatment endpoints [113].
Substance Use Disorder
SUD refers to the DSM-5 diagnosis category that encompasses signiﬁcant
impairment or distress resulting from speciﬁc categories of psychoactive drug
use. The diagnosis of SUD is operationalized as 2 or more of 11 symptoms over
the past year. As a result, the diagnosis is heterogenous, with more than
1100 symptom permutations possible. The diagnosis in DSM-5 is the result of
combining two diagnoses from the DSM-IV, abuse and dependence, which
proved to be less valid than a single dimensional approach [114]. Critically, SUD
includes three levels of severity: mild (2–3 symptoms), moderate (4–5 symptoms),
and severe (6+ symptoms). The International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD)
system retains two diagnoses, harmful use (lower severity) and substance
dependence (higher severity).
Addiction
Addiction is a natural language concept, etymologically meaning enslavement,
with the contemporary meaning traceable to the Middle and Late Roman
Republic periods [115]. As a scientiﬁc construct, drug addiction can be deﬁned as
a state in which an individual exhibits an inability to self-regulate consumption of
a substance, although it does not have an operational deﬁnition. Regarding
clinical diagnosis, as it is typically used in scientiﬁc and clinical parlance,
addiction is not synonymous with the simple presence of SUD. Nowhere in DSM-
5 is it articulated that the diagnostic threshold (or any speciﬁc number/type of
symptoms) should be interpreted as reﬂecting addiction, which inherently
connotes a high degree of severity. Indeed, concerns were raised about setting
the diagnostic standard too low because of the issue of potentially conﬂating a
low-severity SUD with addiction [116]. In scientiﬁc and clinical usage, addiction
typically refers to individuals at a moderate or high severity of SUD. This is
consistent with the fact
the closest
correspondence with the more severe diagnosis in ICD [117–119]. Nonetheless,
akin to the undeﬁned overlap between hazardous use and SUD, the ﬁeld has not
identiﬁed the exact thresholds of SUD symptoms above which addiction would
be deﬁnitively present.
Integration
The ambiguous relationships among these terms contribute to misunderstand-
ings and disagreements. Figure 1 provides a simple working model of how these
terms overlap. Fundamentally, we consider that these terms represent successive
dimensions of severity, clinical “nesting dolls”. Not all
individuals consuming
substances at hazardous levels have an SUD, but a subgroup do. Not all
individuals with a SUD are addicted to the drug in question, but a subgroup are.
At the severe end of the spectrum, these domains converge (heavy consumption,
numerous symptoms, the unambiguous presence of addiction), but at low
severity, the overlap is more modest. The exact mapping of addiction onto SUD is
an open empirical question, warranting systematic study among scientists,
clinicians, and patients with lived experience. No less important will be future
research situating our deﬁnition of SUD using more objective indicators (e.g.,
[55, 120]), brain-based and otherwise, and more precisely in relation to clinical
needs [121]. Finally, such work should ultimately be codiﬁed in both the DSM and
ICD systems to demarcate clearly where the attribution of addiction belongs
within the clinical nosology, and to foster greater clarity and speciﬁcity in
scientiﬁc discourse.

that moderate-to-severe SUD has

What is a disease?
In his classic 1960 book “The Disease Concept of Alcoholism”,
Jellinek noted that in the alcohol ﬁeld, the debate over the disease
concept was plagued by too many deﬁnitions of “alcoholism” and
too few deﬁnitions of “disease” [10]. He suggested that the
addiction ﬁeld needed to follow the rest of medicine in moving
away from viewing disease as an “entity”, i.e., something that has
“its own independent existence, apart from other things” [11]. To
modern medicine, he pointed out, a disease is simply a label that
is agreed upon to describe a cluster of substantial, deteriorating
changes in the structure or function of the human body, and the
accompanying deterioration in biopsychosocial functioning. Thus,
he concluded that alcoholism can simply be deﬁned as changes in
structure or function of the body due to drinking that cause
disability or death. A disease label is useful to identify groups of
people with commonly co-occurring constellations of problems—
syndromes—that signiﬁcantly impair function, and that lead to

clinically signiﬁcant distress, harm, or both. This convention allows
a systematic study of the condition, and of whether group
members beneﬁt from a speciﬁc intervention.

It is not trivial to delineate the exact category of harmful
substance use for which a label such as addiction is warranted
(See Box 1). Challenges to diagnostic categorization are not
unique to addiction, however. Throughout clinical medicine,
diagnostic cut-offs are set by consensus, commonly based on an
evolving understanding of thresholds above which people tend to
beneﬁt from available interventions. Because assessing beneﬁts in
large patient groups over time is difﬁcult, diagnostic thresholds
are always subject to debate and adjustments. It can be debated
whether diagnostic thresholds “merely” capture the extreme of a
single underlying population, or actually identify a subpopulation
that
is at some level distinct. Resolving this issue remains
challenging in addiction, but once again, this is not different

Thus, as originally pointed out by McLellan and colleagues,
most of the criticisms of addiction as a disease could equally be
applied to other medical conditions [2]. This type of criticism could
also be applied to other psychiatric disorders, and that has indeed
been the case historically [23, 24]. Today, there is broad consensus
that those criticisms were misguided. Few,
if any healthcare
professionals continue to maintain that schizophrenia, rather than
being a disease, is a normal response to societal conditions. Why,
then, do people continue to question if addiction is a disease, but
not whether schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or post-
traumatic stress disorder are diseases? This is particularly troubling
given the decades of data showing high co-morbidity of addiction
with these conditions [25, 26]. We argue that it comes down to
stigma. Dysregulated substance use continues to be perceived as
a self-inﬂicted condition characterized by a lack of willpower, thus
falling outside the scope of medicine and into that of morality [3].

the critique targeted at

Chronic and relapsing, developmentally-limited, or spontaneously
remitting?
Much of
the conceptualization of
addiction as a brain disease focuses on its original assertion that
addiction is a chronic and relapsing condition. Epidemiological
data are cited in support of the notion that large proportions of
individuals achieve remission [27], frequently without any formal
treatment [28, 29] and in some cases resuming low risk substance
use [30]. For
instance, based on data from the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions
(NESARC) study [27], it has been pointed out that a signiﬁcant
proportion of people with an addictive disorder quit each year,
and that most afﬂicted individuals ultimately remit. These
spontaneous remission rates are argued to invalidate the concept
of a chronic, relapsing disease [4].

Interpreting these and similar data is complicated by several
methodological and conceptual issues. First, people may appear
to remit spontaneously because they actually do, but also because
of limited test–retest reliability of the diagnosis [31]. For instance,
using a validated diagnostic interview and trained interviewers,
the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism examined the
likelihood that an individual diagnosed with a lifetime history of
substance dependence would retain this classiﬁcation after 5
years. This is obviously a diagnosis that, once met, by deﬁnition
cannot truly remit. Lifetime alcohol dependence was indeed
stable in individuals recruited from addiction treatment units,
~90% for women, and 95% for men. In contrast, in a community-
based sample similar to that used in the NESARC [27], stability was
only ~30% and 65% for women and men, respectively. The most
important characteristic that determined diagnostic stability was
severity. Diagnosis was stable in severe, treatment-seeking cases,
but not in general population cases of alcohol dependence.

These data suggest that commonly used diagnostic criteria
alone are simply over-inclusive for a reliable, clinically meaningful
diagnosis of addiction. They do identify a core group of treatment
if applied to
seeking individuals with a reliable diagnosis, but,
nonclinical populations, also ﬂag as “cases” a considerable halo of
individuals for whom the diagnostic categorization is unreliable.
Any meaningful discussion of remission rates needs to take this
into account, and specify which of these two populations that is
being discussed. Unfortunately, the DSM-5 has not made this task
easier. With only 2 out of 11 symptoms being sufﬁcient for a
diagnosis of SUD,
it captures under a single diagnostic label
individuals in a “mild” category, whose diagnosis is likely to have
very low test–retest reliability, and who are unlikely to exhibit a
chronic relapsing course, together with people at the severe end
of the spectrum, whose diagnosis is reliable, many of whom do
show a chronic relapsing course.

The NESARC data nevertheless show that close to 10% of
people in the general population who are diagnosed with alcohol
addiction (here equated with DSM-IV “dependence” used in the

Fig. 1 A heuristic Venn diagram of the putative relationships
among risky (hazardous) substance use, substance use disorder
(SUD), and addiction. Risky (hazardous) substance use refers to
quantity/frequency indicators of consumption; SUD refers to
individuals who meet criteria for a DSM-5 diagnosis (mild, moderate,
or severe); and addiction refers to individuals who exhibit persistent
difﬁculties with self-regulation of drug consumption. Among high-
risk individuals, a subgroup will meet criteria for SUD and, among
those who have an SUD, a further subgroup would be considered to
be addicted to the drug. However, the boundary for addiction is
intentionally blurred to reﬂect that the dividing line for deﬁning
addiction within the category of SUD remains an open empirical
question.

from other areas of medicine [see e.g., [12] for type 2 diabetes].
Longitudinal studies that track patient trajectories over time may
have a better ability to identify subpopulations than cross-
sectional assessments [13].

By this pragmatic, clinical understanding of the disease concept,
it is difﬁcult to argue that “addiction” is unjustiﬁed as a disease
label. Among people who use drugs or alcohol, some progress to
using with a quantity and frequency that results in impaired
function and often death, making substance use a major cause of
global disease burden [14].
In these people, use occurs with a
pattern that in milder forms may be challenging to capture by
current diagnostic criteria (See Box 1), but is readily recognized by
patients, their families and treatment providers when it reaches a

discussion]. In some cases, such as opioid addiction, those who
receive the diagnosis stand to obtain some of the greatest beneﬁts
from medical treatments in all of clinical medicine [16, 17].
Although effect sizes of available treatments are more modest in
nicotine [18] and alcohol addiction [19], the evidence supporting
their efﬁcacy is also indisputable. A view of addiction as a disease is
justiﬁed, because it is beneﬁcial: a failure to diagnose addiction
drastically increases the risk of a failure to treat it [20].

is clinically signiﬁcant

[see [15]

Of course, establishing a diagnosis is not a requirement for
interventions to be meaningful. People with hazardous or harmful
substance use who have not (yet) developed addiction should
also be identiﬁed, and interventions should be initiated to address
their substance-related risks. This is particularly relevant
for
alcohol, where even in the absence of addiction, use is frequently
associated with risks or harm to self, e.g., through cardiovascular
disease,
liver disease or cancer, and to others, e.g., through
accidents or violence [21]. Interventions to reduce hazardous or
harmful substance use in people who have not developed
addiction are in fact particularly appealing. In these individuals,
limited interventions are able to achieve robust and meaningful
beneﬁts [22], presumably because patterns of misuse have not yet
become entrenched.

NESARC study) never remitted throughout their participation in
the survey. The base life-time prevalence of alcohol dependence
in NESARC was 12.5% [32]. Thus, the data cited against the
concept of addiction as a chronic relapsing disease in fact indicate
that over 1% of the US population develops an alcohol-related
condition that is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and
whose chronic and/or relapsing nature cannot be disputed, since
it does not remit.

the prevalence of

Secondly, the analysis of NESARC data [4, 27] omits opioid
addiction, which, together with alcohol and tobacco, is the largest
addiction-related public health problem in the US [33]. This is
probably the addictive condition where an analysis of cumulative
evidence most strikingly supports the notion of a chronic disorder
with frequent relapses in a large proportion of people affected [34].
Of course, a large number of people with opioid addiction are
unable to express the chronic, relapsing course of their disease,
because over the long term, their mortality rate is about 15 times
greater than that of the general population [35]. However, even
among those who remain alive,
stable
abstinence from opioid use after 10–30 years of observation is
<30%. Remission may not always require abstinence, for instance
in the case of alcohol addiction, but is a reasonable proxy for
remission with opioids, where return to controlled use is rare.
Embedded in these data is a message of literally vital importance:
when opioid addiction is diagnosed and treated as a chronic
relapsing disease, outcomes are markedly improved, and retention
in treatment is associated with a greater likelihood of abstinence.
The fact that signiﬁcant numbers of individuals exhibit a chronic
relapsing course does not negate that even larger numbers of
individuals with SUD according to current diagnostic criteria do
not. For instance, in many countries, the highest prevalence of
substance use problems is found among young adults, aged
these ‘age out’ of excessive

is also well documented that many

individuals with SUD achieve longstanding remission,
in many
cases without any formal treatment (see e.g., [27, 30, 38]).

Collectively, the data show that the course of SUD, as deﬁned
is highly heterogeneous. Accord-
by current diagnostic criteria,
ingly, we do not maintain that a chronic relapsing course is a
deﬁning feature of SUD. When present in a patient, however, such
as course is of clinical signiﬁcance, because it identiﬁes a need for
long-term disease management [2], rather than expectations of a
recovery that may not be within the individual’s reach [39]. From a
conceptual standpoint, however, a chronic relapsing course is
neither necessary nor implied in a view that addiction is a brain
disease. This view also does not mean that it is irreversible and
hopeless. Human neuroscience documents restoration of func-
tioning after abstinence [40, 41] and reveals predictors of clinical
success [42]. If anything, this evidence suggests a need to increase
efforts devoted to neuroscientiﬁc research on addiction recovery
[40, 43].

It

Lessons from genetics
For alcohol addiction, meta-analysis of twin and adoption studies
has estimated heritability at ~50%, while estimates for opioid
addiction are even higher [44, 45]. Genetic risk factors are to a
large extent shared across substances [46]. It has been argued that
a genetic contribution cannot support a disease view of a
behavior, because most behavioral traits, including religious and
political
inclinations, have a genetic contribution [4]. This
statement, while correct in pointing out broad heritability of
behavioral traits, misses a fundamental point. Genetic architecture
is much like organ structure. The fact that normal anatomy shapes
healthy organ function does not negate that an altered structure
can contribute to pathophysiology of disease. The structure of the
genetic landscape is no different. Critics further state that a
“genetic predisposition is not a recipe for compulsion”, but no
neuroscientist or geneticist would claim that genetic risk is “a

recipe for compulsion”. Genetic risk is probabilistic, not determi-
nistic. However, as we will see below, in the case of addiction, it
contributes to large, consistent probability shifts towards mala-
daptive behavior.

In dismissing the relevance of genetic risk for addiction, Hall
writes that “a large number of alleles are involved in the genetic
susceptibility to addiction and individually these alleles might very
weakly predict a risk of addiction”. He goes on to conclude that
“generally, genetic prediction of the risk of disease (even with
whole-genome sequencing data) is unlikely to be informative for
most people who have a so-called average risk of developing an
addiction disorder” [7]. This reﬂects a fundamental misunder-
standing of polygenic risk. It is true that a large number of risk
alleles are involved, and that the explanatory power of currently
available polygenic risk scores for addictive disorders lags behind
those for e.g., schizophrenia or major depression [47, 48]. The only
implication of this, however, is that low average effect sizes of risk
alleles in addiction necessitate larger study samples to construct
polygenic scores that account for a large proportion of the known
heritability.

However, a heritability of addiction of ~50% indicates that DNA
sequence variation accounts for 50% of the risk for this condition.
Once whole genome sequencing is readily available, it is likely that
it will be possible to identify most of that DNA variation. For
clinical purposes, those polygenic scores will of course not replace
an understanding of the intricate web of biological and social
factors that promote or prevent expression of addiction in an
[49]. Meanwhile,
individual case;
however, genome-wide association studies in addiction have
already provided important information. For instance, they have
established that the genetic underpinnings of alcohol addiction
only partially overlap with those for alcohol consumption,
underscoring the genetic distinction between pathological and
nonpathological drinking behaviors [50].

they will add to it

rather,

It thus seems that, rather than negating a rationale for a disease
view of addiction, the important implication of the polygenic
nature of addiction risk is a very different one. Genome-wide
association studies of complex traits have largely conﬁrmed the
century old “inﬁnitisemal model” in which Fisher
reconciled
Mendelian and polygenic traits [51]. A key implication of this
model is that genetic susceptibility for a complex, polygenic trait is
continuously distributed in the population. This may seem
antithetical to a view of addiction as a distinct disease category,
but the contradiction is only apparent, and one that has long been
familiar to quantitative genetics. Viewing addiction susceptibility as
a polygenic quantitative trait, and addiction as a disease category
is entirely in line with Falconer’s theorem, according to which, in a
given set of environmental conditions, a certain level of genetic
susceptibility will determine a threshold above which disease
will arise.

A brain disease? Then show me the brain lesion!
The notion of addiction as a brain disease is commonly criticized
with the argument that a speciﬁc pathognomonic brain lesion has
not been identiﬁed. Indeed, brain imaging ﬁndings in addiction
(perhaps with the exception of extensive neurotoxic gray matter
loss in advanced alcohol addiction) are nowhere near the level of
speciﬁcity and sensitivity required of clinical diagnostic tests.
However, this criticism neglects the fact that neuroimaging is not
used to diagnose many neurologic and psychiatric disorders,
including epilepsy, ALS, migraine, Huntington’s disease, bipolar
disorder, or schizophrenia. Even among conditions where signs of
disease can be detected using brain imaging, such as Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s disease, a scan is best used in conjunction with
clinical acumen when making the diagnosis. Thus, the require-
ment that addiction be detectable with a brain scan in order to be
classiﬁed as a disease does not recognize the role of neuroima-
ging in the clinic.

Neuropsychopharmacology (2021) 46:1715 – 1723

For the foreseeable future, the main objective of imaging in
addiction research is not to diagnose addiction, but rather to
improve our understanding of mechanisms that underlie it. The
hope is that mechanistic insights will help bring forward new
treatments, by identifying candidate targets for them, by pointing
to treatment-responsive biomarkers, or both [52]. Developing
innovative treatments is essential to address unmet treatment
needs, in particular in stimulant and cannabis addiction, where no
approved medications are currently available. Although the task to
develop novel treatments is challenging, promising candidates
await evaluation [53]. A particular opportunity for imaging-based
research is related to the complex and heterogeneous nature of
addictive disorders. Imaging-based biomarkers hold the promise
of allowing this complexity to be deconstructed into speciﬁc
functional domains, as proposed by the RDoC initiative [54] and its
application to addiction [55, 56]. This can ultimately guide the
development of personalized medicine strategies to addiction
treatment.

functional

Countless imaging studies have reported differences in brain
structure and function between people with addictive disorders
and those without them. Meta-analyses of structural data show
that alcohol addiction is associated with gray matter losses in the
prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, insula, and posterior cingulate
cortex [57], and similar results have been obtained in stimulant-
addicted individuals [58]. Meta-analysis of
imaging
studies has demonstrated common alterations in dorsal striatal,
and frontal circuits engaged in reward and salience processing,
habit formation, and executive control, across different substances
and task-paradigms [59]. Molecular imaging studies have shown
that large and fast increases in dopamine are associated with the
reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, but that after chronic drug
use and during withdrawal, brain dopamine function is markedly
decreased and that these decreases are associated with dysfunc-
tion of prefrontal regions [60]. Collectively, these ﬁndings have
given rise to a widely held view of addiction as a disorder of
fronto-striatal circuitry that mediates top-down regulation of
behavior [61].

Critics reply that none of the brain imaging ﬁndings are
sufﬁciently speciﬁc to distinguish between addiction and its
absence, and that they are typically obtained in cross-sectional
studies that can at best establish correlative rather than causal
links. In this, they are largely right, and an updated version of a
conceptualization of addiction as a brain disease needs to
acknowledge this. Many of the structural brain ﬁndings reported
are not speciﬁc for addiction, but rather shared across psychiatric
disorders [62]. Also, for now, the most sophisticated tools of
human brain imaging remain crude in face of complex neural
circuit function. Importantly however, a vast literature from animal
studies also documents functional changes in fronto-striatal
circuits, as well their limbic and midbrain inputs, associated with
addictive behaviors [63–68]. These are circuits akin to those
identiﬁed by neuroimaging studies in humans,
implicated in
positive and negative emotions, learning processes and executive
functions, altered function of which is thought
to underlie
addiction. These animal studies, by virtue of their cellular and
molecular level resolution, and their ability to establish causality
under experimental control, are therefore an important comple-
ment to human neuroimaging work.

Nevertheless, factors that seem remote from the activity of
brain circuits, such as policies, substance availability and cost, as
well as socioeconomic factors, also are critically important
determinants of substance use. In this complex landscape, is the
brain really a defensible focal point for research and treatment?
The answer is “yes”. As powerfully articulated by Francis Crick [69],
“You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your
ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact
no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and
their associated molecules”. Social and interpersonal factors are

critically important in addiction, but they can only exert their
inﬂuences by impacting neural processes. They must be encoded
as sensory data, represented together with memories of the past
and predictions about the future, and combined with representa-
tions of interoceptive and other inﬂuences to provide inputs to
the valuation machinery of the brain. Collectively, these inputs
drive action selection and execution of behavior—say, to drink or
not to drink, and then, within an episode, to stop drinking or keep
drinking. Stating that the pathophysiology of addiction is largely
about the brain does not ignore the role of other inﬂuences. It is
just the opposite:
it is attempting to understand how those
important inﬂuences contribute to drug seeking and taking in the
context of the brain, and vice versa.

But if the criticism is one of emphasis rather than of principle—
i.e., too much brain, too little social and environmental factors –
then neuroscientists need to acknowledge that they are in part
guilty as charged. Brain-centric accounts of addiction have for a
long time failed to pay enough attention to the inputs that social
factors provide to neural processing behind drug seeking and
taking [9]. This landscape is, however, rapidly changing. For
instance, using animal models, scientists are ﬁnding that lack of
social play early in life increases the motivation to take addictive
substances in adulthood [70]. Others ﬁnd that the opportunity to
interact with a fellow rat is protective against addiction-like
behaviors [71]. In humans, a relationship has been found between
perceived social support, socioeconomic status, and the avail-
ability of dopamine D2 receptors [72, 73], a biological marker of
addiction vulnerability. Those ﬁndings in turn provided translation
of data from nonhuman primates, which showed that D2 receptor
availability can be altered by changes in social hierarchy, and that
these changes are associated with the motivation to obtain
cocaine [74].

Epidemiologically, it is well established that social determinants
of health,
including major racial and ethnic disparities, play a
signiﬁcant role in the risk for addiction [75, 76]. Contemporary
neuroscience is illuminating how those factors penetrate the brain
[77] and, in some cases, reveals pathways of resilience [78] and
those adverse
how evidence-based prevention can interrupt
consequences [79, 80].
In other words, from our perspective,
viewing addiction as a brain disease in no way negates the
importance of social determinants of health or societal inequalities
as critical inﬂuences. In fact, as shown by the studies correlating
dopamine receptors with social experience, imaging is capable of
capturing the impact of the social environment on brain function.
This provides a platform for understanding how those inﬂuences
become embedded in the biology of the brain, which provides a
biological roadmap for prevention and intervention.

We therefore argue that a contemporary view of addiction as a
brain disease does not deny the inﬂuence of social, environ-
mental, developmental, or socioeconomic processes, but rather
proposes that the brain is the underlying material substrate upon
which those factors impinge and from which the responses
originate. Because of this, neurobiology is a critical level of analysis
for understanding addiction, although certainly not the only one.
It is recognized throughout modern medicine that a host of
biological and non-biological factors give rise to disease; under-
standing the biological pathophysiology is critical
for under-
standing etiology and informing treatment.

Is a view of addiction as a brain disease deterministic?
A common criticism of the notion that addiction is a brain disease
is that it is reductionist and in the end therefore deterministic
[81, 82]. This is a fundamental misrepresentation. As indicated
above, viewing addiction as a brain disease simply states that
neurobiology is an undeniable component of addiction. A reason
for deterministic interpretations may be that modern neu-
roscience emphasizes an understanding of proximal causality
within research designs (e.g., whether an observed link between

biological processes is mediated by a speciﬁc mechanism). That
does not in any way reﬂect a superordinate assumption that
neuroscience will achieve global causality. On the contrary, since
we realize that addiction involves interactions between biology,
environment and society, ultimate (complete) prediction of
behavior based on an understanding of neural processes alone
is neither expected, nor a goal.

A fairer representation of a contemporary neuroscience view is
that it believes insights from neurobiology allow useful probabil-
istic models to be developed of
the inherently stochastic
processes involved in behavior [see [83] for an elegant recent
example]. Changes in brain function and structure in addiction
exert a powerful probabilistic inﬂuence over a person’s behavior,
but one that is highly multifactorial, variable, and thus stochastic.
Philosophically, this is best understood as being aligned with
indeterminism, a perspective that has a deep history in philosophy
and psychology [84].
it refers to the
position that the dynamic complexity of the brain, given the
probabilistic threshold-gated nature of its biology (e.g., action
potential depolarization, ion channel gating), means that behavior
cannot be deﬁnitively predicted in any individual instance [85, 86].

In modern neuroscience,

Driven by compulsion, or free to choose?
A major criticism of the brain disease view of addiction, and one
that is related to the issue of determinism vs indeterminism,
centers around the term “compulsivity”
[6, 87–90] and the
different meanings it is given. Prominent addiction theories state
that addiction is characterized by a transition from controlled to
“compulsive” drug seeking and taking [91–95], but allocate
to “compulsivity”. By some
somewhat different meanings
accounts, compulsive substance use is habitual and insensitive
to its outcomes [92, 94, 96]. Others refer to compulsive use as a
result of increasing incentive value of drug associated cues [97],
while others view it as driven by a recruitment of systems that
encode negative affective states [95, 98].

The prototype for compulsive behavior

is provided by
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), where compulsion refers
to repeatedly and stereotypically carrying out actions that in
themselves may be meaningful, but lose their purpose and
become harmful when performed in excess, such as persistent
handwashing until skin injuries result. Crucially, this happens
despite a conscious desire to do otherwise. Attempts to resist
these compulsions result in increasing and ultimately intractable
anxiety [99]. This is in important ways different from the meaning
of compulsivity as commonly used in addiction theories. In the
addiction ﬁeld, compulsive drug use typically refers to inﬂexible,
drug-centered behavior in which substance use is insensitive to
adverse consequences [100]. Although this phenomenon is not

symptoms of clinical addiction, and is captured by several DSM-
5 criteria for SUD [101]. Examples are needle-sharing despite
knowledge of a risk to contract HIV or Hepatitis C, drinking despite
a knowledge of having liver cirrhosis, but also the neglect of social
and professional activities that previously were more important
than substance use. While these behaviors do show similarities
with the compulsions of OCD, there are also important differences.
“compulsive” substance use is not necessarily

chimpanzees would normally choose a banana over morphine.
However, when physically dependent and in a state of withdrawal,
their choice preference would reverse [102]. The critical role of
alternative reinforcers was elegantly brought
into modern
neuroscience by Ahmed et al., who showed that rats extensively
trained to self-administer cocaine would readily forego the drug if
offered a sweet solution as an alternative [103]. This was later also
found to be the case for heroin [103], methamphetamine [104]
and alcohol [105]. Early residential laboratory studies on alcohol
use disorder indeed revealed orderly operant control over alcohol
consumption [106]. Furthermore, efﬁcacy of treatment approaches

rather from a pathology of brain circuits that, through probabilistic

reward contingencies are within a normal range. To resolve this
it is critical to understand that the ability to choose
question,
advantageously is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, but rather is
about probabilities and their shifts, multiple faculties within
human cognition, and their interaction. Yes, it is clear that most
people whom we would consider to suffer from addiction remain
able to choose advantageously much, if not most, of the time.
However, it is also clear that the probability of them choosing to
their own disadvantage, even when more salutary options are
available and sometimes at the expense of losing their life,
is
systematically and quantiﬁably increased. There is a freedom of

that overvalue immediate reinforcement

Synthesized, the notion of addiction as a disease of choice and
addiction as a brain disease can be understood as two sides of the
same coin. Both of these perspectives are informative, and they
are complementary. Viewed this way, addiction is a brain disease
in which a person’s choice faculties become profoundly compro-
mised. To articulate it more speciﬁcally, embedded in and
principally executed by the central nervous system, addiction
can be understood as a disorder of choice preferences,
(both
preferences
positive and negative), preferences for drug-reinforcement in
spite of costs, and preferences that are unstable (“I’ll never drink
like that again;” “this will be my last cigarette”), prone to reversals in
the form of
lapses and relapse. From a contemporary neu-
roscience perspective, pre-existing vulnerabilities and persistent
drug use lead to a vicious circle of substantive disruptions in the
brain that impair and undermine choice capacities for adaptive
behavior, but do not annihilate them. Evidence of generally intact
decision making does not fundamentally contradict addiction as a
brain disease.

Critics question the existence of compulsivity in addiction
altogether [5–7, 89], typically using a literal interpretation, i.e., that
a person who uses alcohol or drugs simply can not do otherwise.
Were that the intended meaning in theories of addiction—which
it is not—it would clearly be invalidated by observations of
preserved sensitivity of behavior to contingencies in addiction.
Indeed, substance use is inﬂuenced both by the availability of
alternative reinforcers, and the state of the organism. The roots of
this insight date back to 1940, when Spragg found that

CONCLUSIONS
The present paper is a response to the increasing number of
criticisms of the view that addiction is a chronic relapsing brain
disease. In many cases, we show that those criticisms target tenets
that are neither needed nor held by a contemporary version of
this view. Common themes are that viewing addiction as a brain
disease is criticized for being both too narrow (addiction is only a
brain disease; no other perspectives or factors are important) or

too far reaching (it purports to discover the ﬁnal causes of
addiction). With regard to disease course, we propose that
viewing addiction as a chronic relapsing disease is appropriate
for some populations, and much less so for others, simply
necessitating better ways of delineating the populations being
discussed. We argue that when considering addiction as a disease,
the lens of neurobiology is valuable to use. It is not the only lens,
and it does not have supremacy over other scientiﬁc approaches.
We agree that critiques of neuroscience are warranted [108] and
that critical thinking is essential to avoid deterministic language
and scientiﬁc overreach.

Beyond making the case for a view of addiction as a brain
disease, perhaps the more important question is when a speciﬁc
level of analysis is most useful. For understanding the biology of
addiction and designing biological interventions, a neurobiologi-
cal view is almost certainly the most appropriate level of analysis,
in particular when informed by an understanding of

psychology of addiction and designing psychological
interven-
tions, behavioral science is the natural realm, but one that can
often beneﬁt from an understanding of the underlying neurobiol-
ogy. For designing policies, such as taxation and regulation of
access, economics and public administration provide the most
pertinent perspectives, but these also beneﬁt from biological and
behavioral science insights.

In contrast,

Finally, we argue that progress would come from integration of
these scientiﬁc perspectives and traditions. E.O. Wilson has argued
more broadly for greater consilience [109], unity of knowledge, in
science. We believe that addiction is among the areas where
consilience is most needed. A plurality of disciplines brings
important and trenchant insights to bear on this condition;
it is
the exclusive remit of no single perspective or ﬁeld. Addiction
inherently and necessarily requires multidisciplinary examination.
Moreover, those who suffer from addiction will beneﬁt most from
the application of the full armamentarium of scientiﬁc perspectives.
