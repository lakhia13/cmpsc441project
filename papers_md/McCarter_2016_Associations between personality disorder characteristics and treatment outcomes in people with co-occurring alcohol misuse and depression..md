Abstract

Background: Personality disorders are highly comorbid with alcohol misuse and depressive symptomatology; however,
few studies have investigated treatment outcomes in this population. The aim of this study was to examine relationships
between baseline personality disorder cluster profiles and overall and treatment-related changes for those with
co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression.
Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted using a subset of data (N = 290) from two randomised controlled
trials of psychological interventions for co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression, which did not specifically
target personality disorders. Baseline dimensional personality disorder cluster scores were derived from the
International Personality Disorder Examination Questionnaire (IPDEQ). Four treatment conditions were compared:
a brief integrated intervention, followed by no further treatment, or nine further sessions of integrated-, alcohol-,
or depression-focused treatment. Associations between IPDEQ scores and changes in alcohol use, depressive symptoms
and functioning from baseline to the 6- and the 12-month follow-ups were of primary interest.

Results: Personality disorder cluster scores moderately negatively impacted on overall change (primarily Cluster C), as
well as treatment-related outcomes (primarily Cluster A), particularly changes in depressive symptoms and psychosocial
functioning. Longer interventions appeared to be more effective in the longer-term (e.g., at 12-month follow-up), with
integrated interventions relatively more effective than single-focused ones for individuals with higher personality
disorder cluster scores.
Conclusions: Greater attention needs to be paid to particular personality disorder clusters during the assessment and
treatment of individuals with co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. Integrated interventions, incorporating
motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy, may provide a useful therapeutic framework. Integrated
interventions also provide opportunities for adjunctive components focussing on other issues and coping strategies
(e.g., to offset negative affective states), potentially tailored to the characteristics and needs of individual participants.

Background
Comorbidity
Co-morbid alcohol misuse and mental health problems
are a major health concern as they place significant bur-
den on the health care system [1] and are associated with
a broad range of negative outcomes, including more se-
vere depressive symptoms, poorer social functioning, in-
creased service utilisation, more days out of role, and
poorer treatment outcomes [2, 3]. A weakness of previous
comorbidity research is the tendency to focus on two co-
occurring disorders only. For example, the associations
between alcohol misuse and depressive symptoms have
been widely studied [4]. However, research has not ad-
dressed more complex clinical presentations, such as
where alcohol misuse, personality disorder and depressive
symptoms are all present within the same individual [5].
Although prevalence estimates of personality disorders in
the general population are approximately 6.5 % [6], esti-
mates in mental health settings are much higher, ranging
from 36 to 67 % [7]. Specifically, there appears to be an
elevated rate of personality disorders among individuals
with alcohol misuse [8, 9] and depression [10, 11].

Existing research on the co-occurrence of personality dis-
orders and either alcohol misuse or depressive symptom-
atology consists mainly of prevalence based studies that do
not address treatment outcomes [12, 13]. The existing stud-
ies are also limited by small sample sizes, inconsistent find-
ings [14, 15], and failure to examine particular personality
disorder cluster associations, even though these disorders
are not expressed homogenously [16]. Gianoli et al. [17]
reviewed pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment
options for individuals with comorbid borderline personal-
ity disorder and alcohol misuse, concluding that there are
currently few treatments that simultaneously address both
sets of symptoms.

There is also ongoing debate about categorical versus di-
mensional approaches to the assessment of personality
disorders [18], and about the relative merits of different
assessment techniques [19]. We have previously expressed
a preference for dimensional approaches [20], because
they offer greater flexibility across clinical and non-clinical
settings, and potentially facilitate a more integrative strat-
egy for better characterising complex comorbidities [21].

Interventions and treatment outcomes
Although it has been suggested by the World Health
Organization that alcohol use disorders and major depres-
sion may require concurrent treatment [22], few random-
ized controlled trials e.g., [23–26] have used integrated
psychological interventions for these co-occurring prob-
lems; see Kelly et al. [27] for a review of comorbid treat-
ments for substance abuse and psychiatric conditions.

In the first study of its kind, Baker et al. [28] compared
integrated (i.e., targeting both alcohol and depression)

and single-focused (only alcohol or depression) outpatient
treatment programs comprising of motivational interview-
ing (MI) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for alcohol
misuse and/or depressive symptoms. Based on short-term,
post-treatment outcomes (i.e., at 18-weeks), the authors re-
ported that integrated treatment was associated with a re-
duction in drinking days and greater improvement in
depressive symptoms. Although a dimensional screener for
personality disorders was included in the baseline phase of
this study, outcomes related to this assessment were not
reported.

People with co-occurring alcohol misuse and mental
health problems are often excluded from existing treat-
ment studies [28, 29]. To date, no studies have investi-
gated alcohol misuse, depressive symptomatology, and
psychosocial functioning treatment outcomes in a sam-
ple of individuals with these co-occurring problems and
personality disorder. However,
the available evidence
suggests that the presence of personality disorders is as-
sociated with a greater degree of psychiatric and alcohol
use severity [30–32].

Poorer response to treatment for depression has been
found among people with co-occurring personality dis-
orders and depression [11]. Higher rates of probable per-
sonality disorders (particularly borderline, antisocial, and
avoidant personality disorders) have also been linked to
lower smoking abstinence rates following group-based
CBT, although it is proposed that different personality
disorders may impact on initial treatment response and
maintenance of abstinence [33]. Treatment outcome stud-
ies also report higher rates of attrition [34], lower compli-
ance [32] and poorer outcomes on alcohol use measures at
follow-up [15] among individuals with comorbid alcohol
misuse and personality disorders. Among clients attending
substance misuse services, higher rates of psychopathology
(e.g., psychosis, affective and anxiety disorders) and service
use have also been reported for those with co-occurring
personality disorders [12]. On the other hand, several treat-
ment studies suggest that comorbid personality disorders
may not negatively affect alcohol misuse treatment out-
comes [35, 36]. The clinical picture may be further compli-
cated by the lack of research on effective evidence-based
treatment for personality disorders in this context [37].

Given the relatively high prevalence of co-existing
personality disorders, alcohol misuse and depressive
symptoms, and the lack of previous research investigat-
ing treatment outcomes when these disorders co-occur,
it is also important to generate greater understanding
of the ways they interact in order to develop effective
interventions.

The current study
We undertook secondary data analysis of composite data
from two large randomised controlled trials in an effort

McCarter et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:210 

Page 3 of 13

to achieve key preliminary insights into the complex
interaction between personality disorder cluster scores,
alcohol misuse and depressive symptoms. Specifically,
we investigated whether baseline personality disorder
cluster scores are associated with overall changes in
alcohol use, depressive symptoms and functioning, and
treatment-related changes at the 6- and the 12-month
for comorbid
follow-up,
alcohol misuse and depressive symptomatology.

for individuals in treatment

As hypothesised in the parent studies [28, 38, 39], we
expected that participants would display overall
im-
provement between the baseline and follow-up phases
on each of the treatment outcome measures. Specifically,
we hypothesised that longer (10-session) interventions
would result in greater improvements than a brief inter-
vention (comparison condition), that integrated treat-
ment would have greater benefit than single-focused
treatment (because interrelationships between comorbid
conditions could be better addressed), and that alcohol-
focused and depression-focused treatments would have
greater impacts on changes in alcohol use and depressive
symptoms, respectively. Of particular relevance for the
current paper, we also hypothesised that across these
outcomes there would be less improvement among par-
ticipants with higher personality disorder cluster scores,
given that specific treatment strategies relating to these
issues were not provided in any intervention.

Methods
Data sources
This study combined data from two randomized controlled
clinical trials co-ordinated by the Centre for Brain and
Mental Health Research, University of Newcastle, New
South Wales, Australia. Study 1, the Self-Help for Alcohol/
other drug use and DEpression (SHADE) project, included
273 participants with comorbid depressive and drug and
alcohol problems [39]. Study 2, the Depression and Alco-
hol Integrated and Single-focused Interventions (DAISI)
project, recruited 284 participants with comorbid depres-
sive symptoms and alcohol misuse [28]. Referrals for both
studies were accepted from a broad range of sources, in-
cluding self-referral and referrals by health professionals
(e.g., public drug treatment and mental health outpatient
clinics, general practices, and non-government support
agencies). See Baker et al. [28, 38] and Kay-Lambkin et al.
[39] for further details, including full descriptions of the
interventions. Several previous reports have also uti-
lised combined SHADE/DAISI datasets, including ana-
lyses examining: associations with tobacco smoking
ideation [41, 42]; and
[40], hopelessness and suicidal
the psychometric properties of the Drug Use Motives
Questionnaire [43]; see Handley et al. [41]; Section 2.2
for further comment on the rationale for combining
these data sources.

Across the two parent studies, a range of manualised
MI/CBT based interventions designed to reduce alcohol
consumption and/or improve depressive symptoms were
delivered. These included a single 90-min brief integrated
intervention (BI), followed by either: 1) no further treat-
ment; or 9 further sessions of 2) integrated (alcohol- and
depression-focused) therapy (delivered either by a therapist
or computer program), 3) alcohol-focused therapy, or 4)
depression-focused therapy; in addition, a person-centred
(supportive counselling) therapy was offered as a control
condition in the SHADE study. Participants provided in-
formed consent and received $20 reimbursement on each
assessment occasion (i.e., baseline and follow-up assess-
ments, but not treatment sessions).

Design and participants
This study involved a secondary analysis of a subset of
data from the two randomised controlled clinical trials
described above. Subset inclusion criteria for the current
study were: (i) hazardous alcohol consumption in the
12 months before baseline (≥ an average of four 10 g
ethanol drinks per day for men, ≥ two per day for
women); (ii) a BDI-II score ≥ 17; and (iii) assignment to
a therapy that specifically targeted alcohol misuse and/
or depressive symptoms; consequently SHADE study
participants receiving the person-centred therapy inter-
vention were not included in the current study, nor were
participants with only cannabis related substance use
problems. Among those who were eligible for the current
analysis (N = 398), the majority had a DSM-IV alcohol
dependence disorder (347/379, 92 %) and/or major de-
pression (303/391, 78 %) during the last 12 months.

In addition, potential participants were excluded from
the current analysis if they had insufficient data for the
primary measures, including: (i) missing personality dis-
order data at baseline; or (ii) an absence of outcome data
at 6- or 12-month follow-up (i.e., none of the primary out-
come measures at any follow-up: alcohol consumption,
depressive symptomatology or global level of functioning).

Measures
A description of the full set of assessments employed
across the parent studies and the rationale for their use
have been reported elsewhere [28, 38, 39]. The current
analysis focused on the following subset of measures.

Substance misuse, depressive symptoms, and functioning
A range of measures were used to quantify the duration
and severity of existing conditions and measure primary
outcomes. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-
TR (SCID) [44] was used at baseline to diagnose alcohol
dependence and abuse and major depressive episodes in
the last 12 months. The Opiate Treatment Index (OTI)
[45] estimated the average occasions of daily alcohol use

McCarter et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:210

in the previous month at baseline and follow-up. Depres-
sive symptoms were assessed at baseline and follow-up
using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) [46]. The
Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF) [47] pro-
vided a clinician-rated indicator of functioning at baseline
and follow-up.

International Personality Disorder Examination
Questionnaire (IPDEQ) [48]
The parent studies screened participants at baseline for
possible Axis II personality disorders using the Inter-
national Personality Disorder Examination Questionnaire
(IPDEQ). The World Health Organization developed the
IPDEQ self-report screener based on the International
Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE) [48], which is a
semi-structured clinician administered interview. The
59-item version of the IPDEQ screener includes items
assessing the nine ICD-10 personality disorders: Cluster
A – paranoid and schizoid; Cluster B – dissocial, impul-
sive, borderline and histrionic; and Cluster C – anankastic,
anxious and dependent. This instrument was chosen over
other possible personality disorder screeners as it is rela-
tively short, yet has been shown to have satisfactory psy-
chometric properties [20]. The current analysis used the
IPDEQ cluster scores for each participant, as per the
dimensional scoring method described in Lewin et al. [20].
This level of analysis has been shown to have greater
predictive power for continuous treatment outcomes
than simple categorical assignments [20, 49]. For the
current analysis, higher dimensional IPDEQ scores in-
dicate a greater likelihood of personality disorder; other
researchers have also used the IPDEQ screener as an
indicator of probable personality disorder e.g., [33].

Data analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows (version 19;
Chicago, IL., USA). Pearson correlations were used to
examine simple associations among continuous measures.
Single sample t-tests were used to compare IPDEQ profiles
with national survey data, while generalized estimating
equations were used to examine overall changes between
baseline and follow-up phases at 6- and 12-months.

For the major analyses, the primary outcome measures
were expressed as change from baseline (i.e., follow-up
phase minus baseline scores). Notwithstanding, our
focus here was essentially on clinical change at discrete
time points, with longer-term benefits (i.e., changes at
12-months) seen as the primary clinical outcome point,
and intermediate benefits (i.e., changes at 6-months)
viewed as being of lesser importance. Two-step hierarch-
ical linear regressions were used to assess the contributions
of socio-demographic, personality disorder and treatment
related predictors to change (from baseline) at 6- and 12-
months, whilst controlling for baseline scores for the set of

outcome measures. Three planned (Helmert) orthogonal
treatment condition (TC) contrasts were included at Step
1 in each of these analyses: Contrast TC1, BI vs. 10 ses-
sions (i.e., Group 1 vs. the other 3 groups); Contrast TC2,
integrated- vs. single-focused (i.e., Group 2 vs. the last 2
groups); and Contrast TC3, alcohol- vs. depression-focused
(i.e., Group 3 vs. the last group); this approach parallels
that reported previously for the DAISI trial [38]. All inter-
action variables were based on continuous standardised
scores for the selected predictors (i.e., product variables)
and were entered at Step 2 in the regression analyses. To
aid interpretation, significant interactions were examined
visually by dividing each of the component predictor vari-
ables into three approximately equal sub-groups (e.g., Low,
Medium and High) and plotting mean scores for the
resulting cross-tabulated subgroups for the outcome vari-
ables of interest.

Importantly, separate regression models were examined
using overall IPDEQ scores and associated interactions;
parallel analyses substituted the set of individual cluster
scores and associated interactions, providing an opportun-
ity to identify their unique contributions to prediction (i.e.,
whilst controlling for the other clusters). As a partial con-
trol for the number of statistical tests, the threshold for
significance was set at p < 0.01; however, trends at p < 0.05
are also reported.

Results
Baseline characteristics
The pattern of participation in the parent studies and
current analysis is summarized in Fig. 1. There were 398
eligible participants (i.e., who met the subset inclusion cri-
teria), of whom 290 (73 %) were retained in the current
analysis. Among those with insufficient data (N = 108), 54
did not have baseline personality disorder data, 36 did not
have any outcome data for at least one of the follow-up
assessments, and 18 failed to meet both of these cri-
teria. There were no significant differences in baseline
characteristics between those who were retained in the
current analysis and those with insufficient data; how-
ever, the latter subgroup attended fewer treatment ses-
sions (2.98 vs. 5.40, t(391) = 5.30, p < .001).

Baseline demographic, symptomatology and substance
use data for the selected sample is presented in Table 1.
The mean age was 44.58 years and just over half (55 %)
were men. Participants had left school at a mean age of
16.18 years and half (54 %) were receiving welfare sup-
port at baseline. They averaged 15.08 years of age when
they first used alcohol and reported consuming 10.50
standard drinks per day in the month before assessment,
well in excess of national recommended guidelines [50].
Participants’ mean BDI-II score was also indicative of
severe depression (>30).

Personality disorder characteristics
As shown in Table 2, all three mean dimensional scores
and the overall personality disorder score for the IPDEQ
were significantly higher for participants in the current
sample than for those in the national sample reported in
Lewin et al. [20]; in each case, the IPDEQ means for the
current sample were approximately twice those of the
national sample. Correlations between IPDEQ dimen-
sional scores were of a similar magnitude between the
three clusters (Clusters A and B: r = 0.40; Clusters A and
C: r = 0.44; and Clusters B and C: r = 0.34). These corre-
lations were also comparable to the subset IPDEQ values
reported in Lewin et al. [20], based on clinical data from
substance users in two community based intervention
studies, including 130 people with psychosis and comor-
bid substance use problems [51] and 155 regular am-
phetamine users [52].

Treatment outcome measures
Overall changes in primary outcomes between phases
Estimated mean changes in OTI alcohol scores, BDI-II
scores and GAF scores between phases are shown in
Table 3. Overall, there was a significant reduction in al-
cohol use (OTI score) and depressive symptomatology
(BDI-II total score) and an improvement in functioning
(GAF score) at the 6- and the 12-month follow-ups,
relative to baseline. However, improvements between 6-
and 12-months were modest, with only changes in

depression scores reaching statistical significance (p =
0.008). As detailed in Table 3, for all three measures, the
observed patterns could also be described as ‘curvilinear’
(i.e., significant
linear and quadratic components of
change).

Predictors of change in alcohol use (OTI)
The predictors of OTI change scores at the 6- and the
12-month follow-up are shown in Table 4. As is often
the case, baseline OTI scores were strongly associated
with OTI change scores at 6- or 12-month follow-up (β
= -.790, -.789 respectively); that is, higher baseline scores
were associated with more marked improvements. There
was also a tendency for those with poorer baseline func-
tioning (GAF) to display greater reductions in alcohol
use by 6-months (β = .094), and for females to experi-
ence greater reductions in alcohol consumption at 12-
months than males (β = -.104). Baseline IPDEQ scores
were not predictive of change in alcohol consumption at
either follow-up phase. However, among the single-
focused treatments,
the alcohol-focused intervention
tended to produce greater short-term benefits (contrast
TC3 at 6-months, β = -.091). There were no significant
interaction effects in the alcohol change analyses.

Predictors of change in depressive symptomatology (BDI-II)
The predictors of BDI-II change at the 6- and the 12-
month follow-up are shown in Table 5. Once again,

scores tended to be associated with less improvement in

depression at 6-months (β = .117). Higher baseline IPDEQ
Cluster C scores were predictive of smaller improvements
in BDI-II depressive symptomatology at 6- and 12-month
follow-up (β = .194,
.187 respectively). This relationship
was also reflected in the association between baseline
IPDEQ overall scores and BDI-II changes at 6- and 12-
month follow-up (β = .215, .216 respectively).

There were no significant treatment group differences
in BDI-II change scores at 6-month follow-up. However,
longer treatments produced more marked improvements
in depression at 12-months, relative to the BI condition
(contrast TC1, β = .216). As shown in Table 5, there were
no significant interaction effects at 6-months, although
there were three trend level
interaction effects at 12-
months. The differential benefit at 12-months of the lon-
ger interventions was less marked for those with higher
Cluster A scores (Cluster A x TC1, β = -.160). Moreover,
among the longer interventions, single-focused (vs. inte-
grated) interventions tended to be relatively less effective
at 12-months for those with higher Cluster A scores
(Cluster A x TC2, β = -.166), and for those with higher
IPDEQ overall scores (Overall score x TC2, β = -.138);
this latter interaction effect is described more fully in
the Discussion (and illustrated in Fig. 2).

Predictors of change in functioning (GAF)
The prediction of GAF change scores at the 6- and the
12-month follow-up is presented in Table 6. Higher
GAF scores at baseline (i.e., better functioning) were
associated with smaller improvements in functioning at
6- and 12-month follow-up (β = -.527, -.500 respectively).
Additionally, higher baseline IPDEQ overall scores were
associated significantly with less improvement in GAF
scores at 6- and 12-month follow-up (β = -.231, -.244
respectively); and, at 12-months this effect was due pri-
marily to the influence of baseline IPDEQ Cluster C and
Cluster A scores (β = -.108, -.164 respectively). As with
change in BDI-II scores, longer treatments produced more
marked improvements in functioning at 12-months, rela-
tive to the BI condition (contrast TC1, β = -.164). There
was also a tendency for greater differential benefit in
functioning at 6-months from integrated interventions
(vs. single-focused ones) for those with lower Cluster A
scores (Cluster A x TC2, β = -.143).

Discussion
This study strengthens our understanding of the comple-
xities associated with co-occurring alcohol misuse, depres-
sive symptoms and personality disorder. In broad terms,
we sought to investigate whether dimensional personality
disorder cluster scores were associated with changes in
selected outcomes at the 6- and the 12-month follow-up
among outpatients in treatment for comorbid alcohol mis-
use and depression.

Note: Change scores are expressed as the subsequent phase minus the earlier phase. Estimated mean changes and Wald chi-square (W2) statistics are from generalized
estimating equations utilising all available data. Expressing these changes across phases in orthogonal polynomial terms (as opposed to pair-wise comparisons): all of
the linear components of change were statistically significant (with equivalent W2 statistics to the 12-months vs. Baseline comparisons), as were all of the quadratic
components of change (OTI: W2 = 31.65, p < .001; BDI-II: W2 = 50.94, p < .001; GAF: W2 = 12.91, p < .001)

Treatment effects in this combined dataset
Our first set of hypotheses referred to patterns of change
in the outcome measures. As expected, participants’ scores
on the OTI, BDI-II and GAF improved across phases,
particularly between baseline and the 6-month follow-up.
With respect to key treatment related hypotheses derived
from the parent studies: longer interventions were more ef-
fective than the BI condition at 12-months, contributing to

larger reductions in depression and improvements in func-
tioning; collectively, single-focused treatments produced
reasonably comparable changes to integrated treatment;
and, within the single-focused treatments, alcohol-focused
treatment tended to be relatively more effective for alcohol
use outcomes, at least in the short-term. These findings are
consistent with those reported recently for comparable
phases of the DAISI project [38].

(R2 = 0.360)

The strong associations between baseline scores for
the three outcome measures and the corresponding
change scores at 6- and 12-months were not surprising,
for a range of reasons: because there is a mathematical
relationship between difference scores and their con-
stituent parts (e.g., baseline scores are involved in both
values); and because samples selected on the basis of
more extreme values (here, higher baseline alcohol use
and depression scores) would be expected to show some
‘regression to the mean’ effects.

More importantly, as discussed below, this secondary
analysis of the combined clinical trials dataset sheds
additional light on these treatment effects and associa-
tions by examining the contributions of personality dis-
order cluster scores to the overall prediction of change
and to the efficacy of the treatments provided. The pres-
ence of some personality disorder profiles negatively

impacted on overall change during the follow-up period
(primarily Cluster C) as well as treatment-related out-
comes (primarily Cluster A), especially in regards to de-
pressive symptoms and psychosocial functioning. These
implications, particularly
insights have several clinical
the potential to inform the development of effective in-
terventions for this comorbid population.

Limited associations between personality disorder and
alcohol outcomes
IPDEQ scores showed limited associations with changes
in alcohol use, with no statistically significant effects
(see Table 4); that is, there was no evidence that base-
line personality disorder severity impacted on subse-
quent changes in alcohol consumption. Likewise, unlike
the change prediction analyses for depression and func-
tioning, there were no significant interactions between

Page 9 of 13

Fig. 2 Change in depression (BDI-II) at 12-months by treatment condition and IPDEQ sub-group (N = 231)

IPDEQ scores and treatment condition effects in the
alcohol change analyses. This is consistent with earlier re-
search suggesting a limited impact of comorbid personality
disorders on alcohol related treatment outcomes [35, 36].

Framing the set of alcohol-related findings more posi-
tively: by 6-months, there was an estimated 4.94 drinks
per day mean reduction in alcohol consumption; the BI
tended to be almost as effective as the longer interven-
tions (with some additional evidence that the alcohol-
focused treatment variant was relatively better); and
comorbid personality disorder profiles made little contri-
bution. Consequently, from a stepped-care perspective
in particular e.g., [53], brief MI/CBT based interventions
addressing alcohol misuse should probably be initiated
regularly, regardless of personality disorder characteristics
(with monitoring of initial treatment responses); similarly,
individuals with personality disorders should not be rou-
tinely excluded from alcohol misuse treatment.

Associations between personality disorder, depression
and functioning outcomes
Participants with higher baseline IPDEQ overall scores and
Cluster C scores experienced smaller improvements in de-
pression at 6- and 12-months (see Table 5). Additionally,
the beneficial impacts of longer interventions and single-
focused interventions on changes in depression at 12-
months tended to be reduced among participants with
higher baseline personality disorder cluster scores, particu-
larly Cluster A scores. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 2,
the mean benefit associated with the BI was approximately
an 8 point reduction in BDI-II scores at 12-months, com-
pared with a more marked, 15 point reduction for the
longer interventions; however, participants within the top

third of overall IPDEQ scores who were assigned to the
depression-focused intervention fared no better than
those in the BI condition (i.e., mean improvement
around 8 points). Awareness of such possible impacts,
by clinicians and their clients, may be an important
component of treatment. That is, for individuals with
more pronounced personality disorder cluster profiles,
simply gaining a better understanding of depressive
symptoms and the factors that affect mood, substance
misuse and treatment response (as per the integrated
intervention condition) may aid recovery.

Consistent with the established impairment in psycho-
social functioning for those with personality disorders
[31, 54], we also found that higher baseline IPDEQ over-
all scores were predictive of lower improvement in GAF
scores at the 6- and the 12-month follow-up (see Table 6).
Furthermore, higher baseline Cluster A and C scores were
associated with poorer GAF improvement at 12-month
follow-up. Additionally, the impact of single-focused inter-
ventions on functioning at 6-months tended to be reduced
among participants with higher baseline Cluster A scores;
once again, this highlights the potential value of integrated
interventions, which may be the preferred approach for
individuals with personality disorders.

These observations provide some support for our overall
hypothesis that higher personality disorder cluster scores
would be associated with poorer outcomes. The social def-
icits particular to these individuals are not likely to be ad-
treatments for
dressed by standard (non-concurrent)
depressive symptoms and alcohol misuse. Although indi-
viduals with personality disorders are more likely to seek
treatment for their depression or alcohol use disorder than
it is feasible that
for their personality pathology [55],

individuals with Cluster C profiles may do so for improve-
ments in psychosocial functioning, particularly in regards
to interpersonal relationships. This may be less likely for
those with socially introverted tendencies, typical of Clus-
ter A personality disorder. Conversely, a recent study sug-
gests that some Cluster A characteristics may reduce the
likelihood of smoking relapse among those who have
stopped smoking, because of the reduced impact of social
pressures [33].

In the current analyses, there was also a tendency for
participants with higher baseline alcohol scores to experi-
ence less improvement in depression at 6-months, whereas
those with poorer baseline functioning experienced greater
reductions in alcohol consumption at 6-months. That is, in
the short-term, higher alcohol consumption tended to im-
pact in a similar way to the baseline personality disorder
scores, in restricting improvements in 6-month depression,
while lower baseline functioning scores were associated

with greater room for improvement in both alcohol con-
sumption and functioning.

Limitations
The major limitation of the current study is that it was a
secondary data analysis of selected composite data from
two randomised controlled trials that did not specifically
focus on personality disorder. Therefore, to confirm our
findings, a more comprehensive trial is required that in-
cludes a clinician administered structured diagnostic as-
sessment for personality disorder. Inclusion of a measure
of personality disorder at the conclusion of the follow-up
phases would have also been useful. With respect to our
current functioning measure, it should also be acknowl-
edged that the GAF has been removed from DSM-5 in
favour of more comprehensive assessments of disability
and functioning [56]; however, as noted previously [38],

McCarter et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:210 

Page 11 of 13

the GAF has been found to be more reliable in research
settings than in routine clinical practice [57].

Utilisation of separate analyses of change scores at the
6-month and the 12-month follow-ups also raises some
potential statistical/methodological concerns, since such
outcome scores would be expected to be correlated (and
other, more powerful statistical approaches might be
possible); however, as noted earlier, for the current ana-
lyses change at 12-months was regarded as the primary
clinical outcome point. For researchers interested in longi-
tudinal profiles across multiple time points (e.g., linear
and non-linear components of change) and their predic-
tors and mediators, different analytical approaches would
be preferable, which simultaneously consider data from all
phases e.g., [58].

Although we observed significant improvement from
baseline in OTI, BDI-II and GAF scores, it should also
be acknowledged that 12-month impairment remained
substantial; suggesting that the scope and intensity of
our interventions needs to be revisited. For example,
mean alcohol consumption per day at 12 months (5.32
drinks) was still well above recommended levels, and
mean BDI-II scores at 12 months (17.2) were indicative
of mild-moderate depression, albeit at the threshold for
entry to the parent studies.

It should also be noted that all of the interaction effects
detected were at trend significance level (p < 0.05); conse-
quently, they await replication elsewhere. On the other
hand, studies often lack statistical power to detect com-
plex interactions (in this instance, changes over time by
dimensional personality disorder cluster scores by treat-
ment condition effects). However, in the 12-month de-
pression analyses, the (Step 2) interaction effects added
5.9 % to the explained variance (see Table 5, and Fig. 2),
suggesting that this effect, in particular, may be worthy of
closer investigation.

Conclusions
In the current analyses (within the combined dataset), lon-
ger (10-session) psychological interventions appeared to be
more effective in the longer-term (at 12-months), especially
for changing depressive symptoms and improving function-
ing. Moreover, integrated interventions were also relatively
more effective than single-focused ones for individuals with
higher personality disorder cluster scores. Consequently,
longer integrated interventions may be a sensible general
strategy for this subgroup, perhaps delivered within a
stepped-care framework [53]. However, the observed mod-
erate contributions of higher personality disorder cluster
scores to lower improvements in depression and function-
ing (at 6- and 12-months) also suggests that we need fur-
ther refinements to our therapeutic approach.

At the very least, adjunctive components need to be in-
corporated into our integrated therapy programs to more

fully engage individuals with particular personality disorder
cluster profiles, in an attempt to counteract the potentially
negative consequences associated with these conditions,
perhaps with a specific focus on emotion or affect regula-
tion and coping strategies. An integrated framework may
also provide opportunities to tailor some intervention
components to the characteristics and needs of individual
participants. We also encourage researchers and clinicians
to more actively consider the influence of particular per-
sonality disorder clusters in assessing, treating and moni-
toring individuals engaged in treatment for co-occurring
alcohol misuse and depression.
