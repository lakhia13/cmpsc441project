using digital media for adolescents 
with intellectual disabilities

Introduction: In art therapy, digital art therapy is a new method in which clients 
use digital  media to express themselves  creatively.  We  wanted  to  explore what 
this  means  for  adolescents  with  disabilities.  The  purpose  of  this  qualitative 
case study was to explain what kind of experience they had when digital media 
was  applied  as  an  expressive  and  therapeutic  medium  in  group  art  therapy  in 
which  adolescents  with  intellectual  disabilities  were  participants  and  what  kind 
of  therapeutic  meaning  the  experience  had.  We  tried  to  know  the  therapeutic 
factors by extracting the implications of meaning.

Methods:  Participants  were  second-year  high  school  students  with  intellectual 
disabilities who belonged to special classes. They were selected in an intentional 
purposive  sampling  method.  Five  teenagers  with 
intellectual  disabilities 
participated  in  11  group  art  therapy  sessions.  Data  were  collected  through 
interviews, observation, and digital artwork collection. Collected data were case 
studies analyzed using an inductive approach. In this study, the use of digital media 
was defined and utilized as “Digital Art Therapy” by setting the scope related to the 
study according to client’s behavioral method.

Results:  As  a  digital  generation  accustomed  to  smartphones,  the  participants 
gained confidence by repeatedly acquiring new technologies through familiarity 
with the media. Interaction with the media through touch and the use of apps have 
promoted autonomy with interest and pleasure to disabled teenagers, allowing 
them  to  express  themselves  actively.  In  particular,  digital  art  therapy  induces 
a  holistic  sensory  experience  by  mobilizing  visual  images  that  could  represent 
various expressions, emotions felt in music and tactile senses that made texts for 
people with intellectual disabilities with difficulty in verbal communication.

Discussion: Art therapy using digital media has become an important experience 
that  provides  opportunities  to  arouse  curiosity,  enjoy  creative  activities,  and 
express positive emotions vividly to adolescents with intellectual disabilities who 
have  difficulties  with  expression  and  communication  and  a  sense  of  lethargy. 
Therefore, it is suggested that an in-depth understanding of the characteristics 
and  differences  between  traditional  and  digital  media  is  necessary,  and  that 
complementary  use  to  help  create  therapeutic  purposes  and  art  therapy  is 
important.

1. Introduction

We are currently living in an era of digital transformation. The 
emergence of the 4th Industrial Revolution has led to an acceleration 
of  digital  technology.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  only  further 
accelerated the use of digital technology (1). New digital technologies 
including metaverse, Augmented Reality (AR), and Internet of Things 
(IoT) focusing on artificial intelligence (AI). Telemedicine and online 
education  are  all  expected  to  spread,  evolve,  and  continue  to 
be extensively developed with increasing demands throughout the 
world (2, 3).

One arena in which the importance of digital technology can 
be  highlighted  is  art  therapy.  Art  therapy  can  promote  self-
exploration  and  understanding  by  using  the  creative  process  of 
artwork as a means of self-expression and communication (4–6). 
Recently, the field of art therapy is using online platforms to activate 
community and creativity among therapists (7), With the COVID-19 
pandemic  started  in  2020,  the  field  of  art  therapy  is  rapidly 
transitioning to remote work to cope with the pandemic (8). It also 
prepares for the future by improving accessibility and acceptability 
to treatment using new art media (9).

Digital  media  was  first  used  as  a  communication  tool  in  art 
therapy  by  Weinberg  (10),  who  attempted  to  apply  computer 
technology to rehabilitation for people with disabilities. The medium 
used in art therapy is a media of expression. Digital media has been 
attracting  attention  as  a  new  tool  to  attract  interest  and  provide 
opportunities  for  artistic  expression  due  to  the  characteristics  of 
digital media (11).

In the new media era, digital media has evolved and developed in 
a wide range of areas, including remote art therapy, phototherapy, 
animation,  and  virtual  reality  (VR)  using  computer  and  graphic 
programs as well as creative expressions (12, 13). Recently, numerous 
apps for digital art production have been released that target a wide 
range  of  users,  including  many  young  customers  of  the  digital 
generation. Despite the explosive spread of art-making apps (e.g., apps 
for  digital  drawing  and  painting,  visual  journalism,  storytelling, 
animation, and multimedia), many art therapists lack experience and 
skills in using digital media in treatment (14). Moreover, research on 
this topic has progressed relatively slowly (9). Those who were born 
in the digital age, i.e., “digital natives” (15), recognize the utility of 
technology in treatment with familiarity and convenience (16). They 
also prefer to express their feelings through images, text, or video in 
their work activities, as they consider the digital space their main 
space (17, 18).

Malchiodi (11) has stated that digital media accessible to people 
with disabilities can promote a new therapeutic relationship. Previous 
studies have shown that the use of digital media with hospitalized 
children (19, 20) or in limited medical environments in clinical art 
therapy can allow patients to virtually experience media that they 
cannot experience in real life (11). Studies have revealed the usefulness 
of  digital  media  in  art  therapy  because  digital  media  can  enable 
patients to experience media that they could not experience in real life 
through digital media (21–24).

International Classification of Health of Functioning Disability 
was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001. 
International  Classification  of  Functioning,  Disability  and  Health 
(ICF) defines “disability” as an interaction between multidimensional 
factors at the individual, social, and physical levels (25). People with 

disabilities have more limited access to digital technology than the 
general  public  (26,  27).  The  National  Telecommunications  and 
Information Administration (NTIA) has reported that people with 
disabilities have digital information gaps in their online activities and 
internet use in various environments compared to people without 
disabilities (28). In the rapidly changing environment of the modern 
world,  digital  technology’s  hyperconnectivity,  convenience,  and 
subjectivity are more needed for people with disabilities who require 
some form of assistance or have physical constraints. To reduce such 
digital information gap, there is a need for digital inclusion that does 
not  exclude  or  marginalize  anybody  (29).  Moreover,  using  digital 
media for communication is essential for students with disabilities to 
live 
successfully  transition  to  society  after  graduation  and 
meaningfully (30).

According to the US National Center for Education Statistics (31), 
from 2020 to 2021, 7.2 million students from 3 to 21 years old received 
special education services under the Disabled Education Act (IDEA), 
thus accounting for 15% of all public school students. This number has 
also been showing an increasing trend. Intellectual disability is defined 
as a condition characterized by significant limitations in intellectual 
functioning and adaptive behavior before age 22 (32, 33).

According to the American Psychiatry Association (APA, 2013), 
intellectual disability is a condition that begins during development 
and is characterized by deficits in both intellectual intelligence and 
adaptive functioning in conceptual, social, and practical domains (34). 
In the Republic of Korea, intellectual disabilities account for the most 
significant proportion of the total number of students with disabilities 
at 51.8% (35). For teenagers with intellectual disabilities, attending 
special classes can cause various psychological stresses such as anxiety 
and perceived inferiority because of one’s disability, the formation of 
low  self-esteem,  frustration,  and  atrophy  due  to  frequent  failure 
experiences (36). They might also face difficulties in social adaptability 
due to emotional expression that is either socially marginalized or 
limited and contraction of interpersonal relationships (32). Therefore, 
there is a greater need for therapeutic intervention for psychological 
and emotional problems of students with intellectual disabilities than 
among general students.

Art  therapy  for  adolescents  with  intellectual  disabilities  can 
provide  them  opportunities  for  expression  and  communication 
through alternative visual media (37). Art therapy in the educational 
scene was, initiated by Edith Kramer (38), It has been shown that art 
could  be  a  powerful  communication  tool  based  on  all  humans’ 
creativity  (39).  In  addition,  for  students  with  disabilities  who  are 
usually  protected  and  raised,  art  provides  them  a  significant 
opportunity to function independently. They can feel joy, pleasure, 
and a sense of achievement in the experience of controlling materials 
at will (40).

In the Republic of Korea, art therapy services are provided during 
creative experience classes and after-school classes in special schools 
and general schools for children and adolescents with disabilities. For 
children and adolescents with special needs, art therapy in a school 
environment can provide them an opportunity to overcome obstacles 
to educational success (41, 42). In addition, strengthening programs 
for students who are identified as disabled can help them realize their 
social  and  academic  potential  by  promoting  appropriate  social 
behavior and emotional development (41, 42). In this way, the clinical 
work of art therapy is gradually expanding into education and special 
education environments (43).

Technology provides many people with pleasant experiences and 
new opportunities (44). The playful interaction behavior offered by 
digital media provides sensory enjoyment, which drives art creation 
(45–48). The spontaneous and action-promoting characteristics of 
such interaction behavior have positive functions that can be useful 
for adolescents with intellectual disabilities who have low expression, 
who are depressed, who have low self-esteem, and who lack attention 
and motivation (49). Studies on the use of digital media for people 
with intellectual disabilities in art therapy (49–51) are very lacking, 
especially  in  group  art  therapy  for  adolescents  with  intellectual 
disabilities.  It  was  difficult  to  find  case  studies  that  applied  it  as  a 
medium of communication. Therefore, in art therapy using digital 
media, there is a need for extensive research on various subjects and 
case studies to understand the therapeutic process.

This study proposes a new method of participation for creative 
expression, selection, and control by therapeutically applying digital 
media,  a  form  of  communication  and  self-expression  culture,  to 
teenagers  with  intellectual  disabilities  so  that  they  can  enjoy  the 
universal right to human equality. Moreover, a case study has been 
performed  to  obtain  specific  knowledge  by  understanding  and 
exploring research participants through a therapeutic process and to 
understand the phenomenon in the art therapy process. To this end, 
the following research questions are explored in this study:

  1.  What  are  experiences  of  adolescents  with  intellectual 

disabilities in group art therapy using digital media?

  2.  What are meanings that can be extracted from experiences of 
adolescents with intellectual disabilities with group art therapy 
using digital media?

  3.  What are therapeutic factors of group art therapy using digital 

media for adolescents with intellectual disabilities?

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Research design

The present work used a qualitative case study approach to explore 
and understand experiences of individuals who had group art therapy 
in 11 sessions, from surface level observations in a natural setting to 
in-depth analyses (52). Phenomena of specific cases were described in 
a deep and natural context. New meanings were discovered based on 
the experiences reported by participants and data obtained from the 
phenomena observed by the researcher (53). The goal of the case study 
method was to investigate how, why, what was happening and what 
factors  were  related  to  the  phenomenon  (54).  The  purpose  of 
qualitative case study is to explore and understand the experiences, 
meanings, and therapeutic factors of research participants through 
various  data  collection  and  analysis  steps,  while  considering 
characteristics of manners (55).

2.2. Research procedure

The participants in this study were five students (one male student 
and four female students) in special classes at M high school in S city. 
The group art therapy program was conducted once a week from 

September 2019 to December 2019 by connecting creative experience 
classes for a semester over a total of 11 sessions (120 min for each 
session). This study used an institutional-centered art therapy program 
composed  for  special  purposes.  After  explaining  the  purpose  and 
method of the study to the teacher in charge of the special class, this 
study was reviewed and approved by the school.

Participants  were  all  second-year  high  school  students  with 
intellectual disabilities who belonged to special classes. They were 
selected  with  a  purposive  sampling  method  (52).  Based  on  the 
selection  criteria  for  adolescents  who  submitted  written  consent, 
research  participants  and  their  parents  (main  guardians)  were 
explained about the purpose and procedure of this study.

Personal information and characteristics of the participants in this 
study were obtained based on reports of special class teachers and 
observations of researchers. In this paper, aliases were used to protect 
research subjects (Table 1).

2.3. Case conceptualization

A case conceptualization is a method and clinical strategy for 
organizing obtained information about clients, for understanding and 
explaining  clients,  planning  treatment  interventions,  and  for 
establishing  a  consistent  treatment  strategy  (56,  57).  Case 
conceptualization is essential in psychotherapy (58). It was developed 
for art therapist responsibility and confidence in treatment (59). It has 
been used to increase the likelihood of treatment goals (57). Thus, the 
researcher identified problems, causes, and strengths based on various 
information  related  to  the  main  complaints  of  participants  and 
planned  treatment  using  case  conceptualization  to  obtain  further 
improved results (Table 2) (60, 61).

2.4. Data collection and data analysis

Data  were  collected  through  interviews,  observation,  and 
document collection using the triangulation method (62). The average 
interview  was  about  30 min,  there  were  two  semi-structured 
interviews after initial and mid-term sessions along with one group 
interview after the end of sessions. Group dynamics were observed by 
having participants fill out semi-structured questionnaires to obtain 
abundant information (63).

Before  starting  the  interview,  the  researcher  explained  to  the 
participant  that  the  interview  content  would  be  recorded  and 
transcribed by the researcher, with anonymity and confidentiality of 
the interview content guaranteed. Consent was then obtained from 
each participant before the interview. We also shared individual results 
with  participants  after  the  study.  In  this  process,  terms  related  to 
informed  consent  were  converted  into  easy-to-understand  terms 
according  to  the  level  of  understanding  of  the  participants.  The 
researcher proceeded with open questions within a large framework 
of the research problem (63). Participants were able to understand the 
purpose  of  this  study  and  express  their  opinions  based  on  their 
own experiences.

The document collection process included audio recordings and 
transcriptions of each session of art therapy by researcher, observation 
notes taken on-site, structured behavioral evaluations, and texts and 
artworks (audio-visual materials such as images and videos). Data

Main component

Case concept explanation

Background and referral information

This case considered five intellectually disabled adolescents in the second grade of a special class at a general high school, and the 

therapeutic issue was commissioned by a special class teacher due to emotional difficulties and conflicts with peers.

Strengths

Limitations

Willingness to participate in art therapy, supportive families and schools, the degree of intellectual disability was not severe, and 

accessibility allowing for the quick establishment of an alliance with the media without resistance to digital media.

First, difficulty in expressing emotions, and second, lack of interpersonal skills.

Due to the abundance of visual opportunities, digital media is essential for people with intellectual disabilities who do not 

understand the language well.

Therapeutic digital media that affects emotional and emotional changes are used to express and communicate art therapy to 

promote various types of emotional expression.

Diagnostic impressions, Treatment 

To improve the sociality of participants through group interactive art therapy that fosters collaboration using small social groups 

guidance, prognosis

for treatment purposes (60).

In the treatment process, the difficulty level was applied, specifically, step by step; considering the characteristics of adolescents 

with intellectual disabilities, techniques and materials were repeatedly utilized, and play elements were applied (61).

The strategy was to have participants share symbolic images, strengthen interactions, and experience a sense of accomplishment 

and confidence.

analysis involved describing cases and contexts. Repeated comparative 
analyses using open coding, categorization, and category verification 
procedures were performed (64).

The researcher tried to find meaningful patterns, concepts, and 
topics  by  repeatedly  reading  the  data  (65).  The  interpretation 
summarized greater meanings of cases discovered by the researcher 
through analysis strategies using direct interpretation from the overall 
perspective according to the researcher’s intuition, reflective thinking, 
use  of  imagery,  and  application  and  search  of  new  and  diverse 
perspectives (66).

2.5. Trustworthiness

Ethical  problems  related  to  the  use  of  digital  media  were 
supplemented by considering ethics codes for the confidentiality of 
electronic information suggested by the British Columbia Art Therapy 
Association (5), the American Art Therapy Qualification Board (68), 
and the Korean Art Therapy Association (KATA) (69).

All six iPads used in this study were set and encrypted with the 
researcher’s IDs so that information on these six iPads used in this 
study would not be leaked. After using the app, the tablet device used 
by participants was initialized to prevent data leakage. All data files 
stored  in  the  form  of  electronic  information  were  stored  with 
passwords.  All  recorded  contents  and  data  were  guaranteed  to 
be discarded following completion of the study.

To secure the reliability of this study, opinions were exchanged 
with  an  academic  adviser  during  research  analysis  and 
interpretation.  The  appropriateness  of  the  data  collection  and 
coding  contents  was  supervised.  The  researcher  focused  on 
revealing the experience and meaning of the research participants 
through data analyzed with a focus on fairness and consistency to 
minimize  preconceptions.  In  order  to  exclude  the  researcher’s 
subjectivity as much as possible and to strengthen the sensitivity 
and  reliability  of  the  collected  data,  colleagues  with  a  master’s 
degree  who  participated  as  observers  and  assistant  therapists 
checked before and after the session and received feedback. A peer 
debriefing session was then held (67).

2.7. Procedure: description of group 
process

In the art therapy environment, students’ desks were relocated to 
the center to face each other, and their interactions were observed. 
Technical education and practice on the iPad and the app are known 
to  be  important  (70).  Thus,  a  TV  monitor  located  in  front  of  the 
classroom was connected to the researcher’s laptop and iPad to model 
the app’s usage and iPad drawing process. Audio-visual materials on 
art therapy topics were shared by participants (Figure 1A). Moreover, 
five new iPad 9.7 32G units were rented for participants to have a 1:1 
iPad art therapy environment (Figure 1B).

2.6. Ethical considerations

2.8. Treatment plans

This study was conducted in class hours and within the scope of 
the curriculum at the special class of the school. After explaining the 
purpose and intended use of the study to all participants and their 
guardians in advance, written consent was voluntarily provided by 
them. The written consent form promised to protect the information 
and  ensure  anonymity  of  the  participants.  Participants  and  their 
guardians  were  explained  that  research  data  of  this  study  would 
be discarded after being stored in a safe place for 5 years.

This study applied Richter’s (71) “Art therapy’s approach to art 
therapy education based on education” by changing the difficulty and 
technique of digital media in consideration of the characteristics and 
learning levels of adolescents with intellectual disabilities (72).

The goal of art therapy is to improve emotional expression and 
strengthen sociality so that participants can complete high-quality 
works through the complementary usage of traditional media and 
digital  media  (73).  Participants  planned  to  freely  express  their

psychological state using various functions of media as a generation 
familiar with digital media (74, 75). When using digital media in 
art activities, the therapist’s competence and ethical understanding 
of  the  media  are  essential  factors  (22,  76).  The  researcher 
participated  in  Today  at  Apple  (experiential  group  session) 
provided by the Apple Store to increase their literacy and acquire 
skills in digital media utilization. They also received training on 
how to use apps, devices, photos, videos, coding, art, and design. 
The researcher demonstrated and supplemented a direct program 
before each session. The therapy was based on the experience of 
using digital media in clinical practice.

The researcher chose an iPad and iOS app considering that 
they are familiar to teenagers using smartphones, easy to access, 
and easy to carry. Specific expression techniques used in digital art 
therapy include digital painting, photography, video, stop motion, 
and digital collage. Apps used in this study for this are summarized 
in Table 3.

2.9. Sessions

2.9.1. Initial stage (sessions 1–3)

In the initial stage, the focus was on relieving tension and building 
a relationship of trust. To build trust with participants, guidelines for 
art therapy and the rules to be followed within the therapy time were 
set together.

2.9.1.1. Session 1: creating my own story

In the first session, traditional media (Colored pencil, felt-tip pen, 
and eight-section drawing paper) and picture cards were used to draw 
story  pictures  (Figures  2A,B).  Participants  actively  and  sincerely 
engaged in the work process, although their progress was slow. For 
that reason, it seemed necessary to distribute planned time.

Participants  were  observed  to  habitually  say  negative  words 
created by the experience of failure, such as “I’m doomed, “and “It is 
driving me crazy, “in the creative process. Thus, continuous emotional 
support and encouragement for the participants seemed necessary. 
The first session was a meaningful session as an opportunity for social 
interaction within the group, taking the first step in experiencing and 
expressing  empathy  by  telling  stories  about  themselves,  although 
participants were not familiar with using art images.

The digital art therapy program was conducted in three stages: 
initial, intermediate, and advanced (Table 4). It was structured in 
consideration  of  cognitive,  social,  emotional  and  short-term 
aspects  of  adolescents  with  intellectual  disabilities.  After  the 
intermediate stage, it was flexibly changed and finally implemented 
so that participants could autonomously decide on the topic they 
wanted.  In  terms  of  digital  media  utilization,  the  process  and 
changes in the session were observed in an initial session followed 
by ten further sessions. The first session used traditional media. 
Another five sessions (2, 5, 7, 9, 10) had the complementary use of 
traditional media and digital media. Another five sessions (3, 4, 6, 
8, 11) used digital media.

2.9.1.2. Session 2: safe space

In the second session, clay was used for emotional expression or 
sensory activation (Figure 3A). Opportunities for expression were 
expanded  by  using  different  types  of  digital  media  together.  The 
researcher used the easy-to-access Storymation Studio: Disney Edition 
app to motivate participants and attract the interest of teenagers who

(77). They showed interest in the function of the app and willingness 
to  use  it  on  their  own  from  filming  to  editing.  In  the  process  of 
creating an animation, participants said “Wow, it is like a game,” “It is 
like being a film director,” “It is fun,” “I like it because it is like a movie, 
“I  like  this  music  the  most,  and  This  is  the  prettiest,  ‘unlike  their

relaxing  appearance  in  clay  work’”.  They  were  careful  in  choosing 
backgrounds,  effects,  and  music.  Participants  increased  their 
interactions  by  showing 
their  digital  artwork  (Figure  3B; 
Supplementary Video S1). While watching the completed artworks 
together, they were all delighted by the moving visual images and the 
vitality given to the animation by the music.

After  the  session,  Sea  approached  the  researcher  and  asked, 
“What’s the name of this app?” and said, “I want to go home and try it 
again” while smiling brightly. Participants showed emotional changes 
in  the  process  of  their  artwork  and  put  metaphors  into  the  work. 
Attractive aspects of digital media also helped form a trust relationship 
between the participants and researchers.

2.9.1.3. Session 3: creating emotions

Before starting this session, the researcher modeled the process of 
drawing by connecting the iPad to a TV monitor. This session involved 
the  use  of  the  Procreate  app  under  the  theme  of  making  friendly 
emoticons  that  could  be  easily  accessed  due  to  the  role-played  by 
smartphones in daily life (Figure 4). Participants used iPad as a canvas 
and  worked  as  shown  in  (Figure  5)  using  their  fingers  and  Apple 
pencil or Stylus pen.

This was an opportunity for participants to understand each other 
by sharing emotional images. After completion, they made statements 
such as “It was fun and fun after expressing my feelings,” “I felt relieved 
and  comfortable,”  and  “I  was  just  happy  without  thinking  about 
anything.” All participants responded that it was much more fun than 
drawing  on  drawing  paper.  They  were  also  satisfied  with  the 
convenience involved in resizing images using digital media and easily 
correcting mistakes.

Although  it  was  difficult  for  participants  to  express  emotions 
using spoken language, they could better express themselves through 
digital  artworks.  Participants  were  able  to  share  information  and 
understand each other by talking about emoticons that expressed each 
other’s feelings.

2.9.2. Intermediate stage (sessions 4–8)

Starting from sessions in the intermediate stage, participants were 
given autonomy and flexibility so that they could decide on the desired 
topic on their own. The app was used repeatedly, so that participants 
would master the technical aspects.

2.9.2.1. Session 4: a self-portrait of pop art

In the 4th session, with the theme of self-portrait drawing in pop 
art, the Procreate app used last time was used repeatedly. Pink started 
by saying she was not confident, but after completing the self-portrait, 
Pink praised herself, saying that “I did a great job, Pink.” She was 
delighted to write her name on her work (Figure 6A). After completing 
the self-portrait, Handsome man wrote “disabled fool” on his work 
and  showed  a  negative  self-concept  (Figure  6B).  Handsome  man 
recognized  his  disability  and  revealed  his  thoughts  about  himself 
through self-portraits.

Participants  enjoyed  the  process  of  painting  the  self-portrait, 
expressed a sense of accomplishment after completion, and showed 
therapeutic  importance  of  the  artwork  by  valuing  it.  Participants 
familiarized themselves with technical aspects by repeatedly using the 
same app. During the talk time, they used the AirDrop app to instantly 
share their artwork which helped the group communicate.

2.9.2.2. Session 5: me and our garden

In the fifth session, participants smelled the scent of flowers. The 
classroom  was  full  of  flowers,  which  awakened  their  senses,  thus 
allowing them to have a moment of relaxation and healing. In this 
session, the Perfect Image app with a photo collage function was used. 
Participants all experienced unity through cooperative artwork while 
creating  a  garden  together  (Figure  7B).  After  completion,  they 
captured their desired parts by taking pictures to recreate a photo 
collage (Figure 7A).

While participants were creating the mandala works (diameter 
25 cm), their emotions were stabilized with positive emotions were 
aroused. There was a change in interaction that provided altruism, 
praise, and encouragement to friends. Handsome man took more than 
140 pictures while producing a nice photo collage and said, “It’s a nice 
garden.” Actively created photos re-visualize images through photo 
collages  and  create  new  stories.  Creative  possibilities  were  also 
expanded to photo collage artworks that fused traditional media and 
digital media.

2.9.2.3. Session 6: if I were ~

In the sixth session, the Procreate app was used. The participants 
drew pictures on their iPads, handed them over to other participants, 
and created a “Digital painting rotation” in which they drew pictures 
in  addition  to  the  pictures  they  received  from  other  participants. 
Participants had to add layers to the received picture and draw it to 
prevent other people’s paintings from being erased, and the record of 
the  picture  was  stored  separately  (Figure  8A).  Therefore,  it  was 
possible  to  confirm  the  contribution  of  each  participant  to  the 
single work.

Pink expressed her complex feelings with colors and lines, saying 
that she was not in good condition. When her painting (Figure 8B) 
was returned, she smiled, saying that she was pretty when she left, but 
that she was struck by lightning. Pink talked about the pleasant parts 
and the unpleasant parts in the additional painting. Digital painting, 
which can be drawn by dividing the picture into separate layers, was

activity with less burden.

This session gave participants opportunities to sympathize with

expressed  her  joy  and  satisfaction  by  inserting  the  words. 
“Satisfaction with what I made today, Today is the best day, Hooray” 
in the video. Participants started to praise themselves by feeling a 
sense of accomplishment. They encouraged each other and showed 
positive  relationship  experiences  and  interactions  in  the  group 
art therapy.

2.9.2.4. Session 7: making wishes

2.9.2.5. Session 8: a fantasy trip

For  the  seventh  session,  Participants  were  motivated  by  the 
program of ‘Making a wish bracelet’ that they selected themselves. 
They worked with an immersive focus. This session involved creating 
a video (Figure 9) that documented the process of artistic expression 
as a Clips app for video production. The process of making bracelets 
gave them an opportunity to solve problems while being original. 
Participants chose colors, shapes, and materials. They edited videos 
together and expressed positive emotions through the experience of 
collaborative work.

Participants showed the importance of their digital artwork by 
inserting various moving stickers and text to express emotions. Sea 

The theme of the trip, which was the most frequently expressed 
theme in participants’ wishes in the seventh session, was made into a 
video  using  the  Clips  app.  Participants  said  they  were  happy  just 
thinking  about  the  trip  plan.  Photos  of  their  travel  destinations 
contained emotions and information through symbolic meanings. 
Participants were immersed in making videos of their dream trip. 
They expressed excitement and expectation.

Summer often expressed her expectations and excitement after 
deciding on New York and Hawaii as travel destinations, for which she 
carefully planned, saying, “There are so many places I want to go here.” 
She made a highly complete work called “Exciting Travel” (Figure 10).

Participants were able to actively express themselves with audio-
visual stimulation of multimedia. Emotions they felt in the music were 
harmonized with their visual stimuli. The liveliness of the completed 
video satisfied their emotions by mobilizing the touch of making text.

2.9.3. Advanced stage (sessions 9–11)

In the advanced stage, with goals of enhancing self-confidence 
and improving social skills through positive emotional experiences 
and a sense of achievement, the process of change in the past was 

examined, focusing on completion of collaborative works, exhibitions 
of works, and art journaling.

2.9.3.1. Session 9: our seasonal trees

In the ninth session, the participants drew trees together on a 50P 
(Paysage) canvas as a collaboration project in the advanced stage. With 
the Stop Motion Studio app, the work activity process was captured 
with a total of 417 photos, ultimately leading to the completion of a 
1-min and 25-s-long stop-motion movie (Figure 11B). Participants

completed their respective areas, looked at the overall harmony, cared 
for and helped their friends, and showed a mature appearance that 
gave meaning to the importance of the process of completing the work 
together.  Participants  coordinated  their  opinions  and  showed 
teamwork in determining the title, music, background, and effect of 
the  artwork  together.  They  were  also  able  to  appreciate  the  stop-
motion movie artwork and view their roles objectively. When setting 
the title of the work, Handsome man surprised everyone by loudly 
suggesting “Our Seasonal Tree” (Figure 11A).

2.9.3.2. Session 10: Christmas gift

This session began with a laugh among participants who prepared 
Santa hats and Rudolph headbands. The 10th session involves the 
creation of a digital collage (Figure 12A) and a Christmas wreath using 
the Line camera app. Participants had experience in magazine collage. 
Thus, they understood the digital collage quickly and completed the 
work  in  a  short  time  because  it  was  easy  to  edit.  Parts  that  could 
be transformed without damaging the original, such as adjusting the 
size of the picture, aroused participants’ interest. Collage is a technique 
with the greatest metaphorical potential (78). Participants felt grateful 
and happy. They expressed positive emotions as they thought about 
the grand prize under the theme of Christmas gifts. Afterward, they 
gathered their completed wreaths and made a Christmas Garland 
together, turned on the lights, and cheered and applauded. Participants 
were very proud of their work. They took pictures together in front of 

their  works  (Figure  12B)  and  hung  them  in  the  classroom  to 
display them.

2.9.3.3. Session 11: say “goodbye”

As the “Media Art Exhibition” was held as a closing session that 
involved  a  group  celebration,  participants  aimed  to  reflect  on  the 
process of growth throughout the therapy process and became aware 
of their changes. The 11th session involved using the Clips app to 
complete a modern media art journal in which images, narratives, 
music, and editing were done within a single digital media. During 
digital artwork activities, participants approached their friends and 
worked together. They showed an improved relationship wherein they 
were interested in. They cheered for their friends’ artwork. Titles of art 
journals  created  by  participants  reflected  main  themes  of 
their experiences.

Pink was embarrassed while looking at her works in each session 
and danced while choosing music during the media art journal. She 
showed elevated expressions in terms of behavior as well as verbal 
expressions. Summer said that she could get to know more about her 
friends by watching the exhibition. She laughed and said about her 
work, “It’s a very well-made video, but there are so many things I want 
to say right now, so it’s a pity that I could not put them all into the 
work.” Images and writings had been added to each work to the end. 
Expressing high satisfaction after completion, the title of the artwork 
was called ‘Precious Memories’ (Figure 13).

3. Results

The main results of this study were an analysis of participants’ 
experiences and meanings of participants using digital media and 
descriptions of therapeutic factors.

3.1. Analysis of experience and meaning of 
group art therapy using digital media

Experiences  and  associated  meaning  of  the  group  art  
therapy  were  identified  through  coding,  categorization,  and 
subjectification by comparing and reviewing artworks, interview 
transcription contents, and observation journals for 11 sessions of 
group art therapy. Meaning was derived from a total of six themes 
and 13 subcategories representing experiences derived through 
repetitive  comparison  and  line-by-line  analysis  were  found 
(Table 5).

3.1.1. Theme 1. New and fun digital art therapy

In the interview, participants said that their first experience 
of  creating  work  using  an  iPad  was  “incredible.”  This  new 
experience might represent the first step toward life improvement 
and change.

Participants  had  more  stories  and  laughter  as  they  created 
artworks  with  digital  media.  Interactions  with  digital  media  can 
enhance the aspect of play. Their effects give pleasure (79). Fun is the 
core of humanity (80). Fun has important implications for human 
development (81).

3.1.2. Theme 2. Enjoying daily choices as the 
protagonist of life

Participants  felt  more  freedom  and  satisfaction  in  the  session 
about subject they voluntarily selected. Adolescents with intellectual 
disabilities  have  limited  choices  and  opportunities  due  to  family 
control and social exclusion, and they experience exclusion due to a 
lack of awareness regarding technology and digital information (82).

positive power such as competence and confidence. Participants were 
more  motivated  by  the  acquisition  of  skills  in  the  use  of  iPads 
and apps.

due to various deficiencies. Participants experienced various new self-
expressions  and  rich  emotional  experiences  through  convergence 
between  media.  The  difference  between  digital  art  therapy  and 
traditional art therapy is that digital media has a non-material aspect, 
which not only amplifies bodily sensations but also triggers heightened 
behaviors, bringing participants another bodily experience.

3.1.5. Theme 5. Preciousness and joyfulness of 
the process of “being together”

Participants said that the experience of group art therapy would 
represent a pleasant memory. They put the importance on cherishing 
times  during  which  they  complete  the  work  with  friends  and 
collaborated happily together. Through group art therapy, participants 
attached meaning to the importance of collaboration. The connectivity 
of  digital  media  helped  communicate  by  allowing  their  work  to 
be  shared  immediately  and  quickly.  It  also  improved  sociality  by 
having  a  positive  effect  as  a  tool  for  communication  between 
participants, thus improving their social skills.

3.1.6. Theme 6. Sublimation to digital art through 
immersion

Participants said that when making digital art works with iPads, 
they concentrated better, and time went by faster. This meant that 
digital media increased participants’ immersion and motivation to 
participate (84–88) and sublimated them into emotional sublimation 

through the expression of catharsis and integrated digital art creation 
in the art therapy process.

3.2. Therapeutic factors of group art 
therapy using digital media in adolescents 
with intellectual disabilities

Therapeutic factors that were extracted and used to investigate the 
meaning  of  the  group  art  therapy  experience  of  adolescents  with 
intellectual  disabilities  using  digital  media  were  playfulness, 
interactivity, and scalability of digital media (Table 6) (9, 48, 89–97).

4. Discussion

This  study  aimed  to  explore  participants’  experiences  and 
meanings when applying using digital hardware tablets and software 
apps as delivery devices for expressive and therapeutic media in group 
art therapy for adolescents with intellectual disabilities.

Results of the present study are consistent with those of Weinberg 
(10),  who  argues  that  computer-based  art  therapy  has  unique 
advantages  to  grant  curiosity  and  motivation  for  patients  with 
disabilities as a new approach to a successful art experience. Malchiodi 
(11) has also shown that digital media can improve concentration and

self-esteem, consistent with the results of the present study. This study 
is also in line with the study of Garner (12), who argues that the use 
of digital art media can improve choice and autonomy among students 
with disabilities. Wehmeyer and Metzler (98) have emphasized the 
importance  of  autonomy  for  students  with  disabilities  to  have  a 
successful transition to social life.

Participants in the present work experienced sensory expansion, 
various  emotional  experiences,  and  natural  convergence  between 
media  in  the  process  of  engaging  in  the  artwork  activities.  This 
supports  Mcniff ’s  belief  (13)  that  all-in-one  digital  devices  are 
promising as a fusion art production tool. The results of this study are 
also  consistent  with  Hallas  and  Cleave’s  (51)  claim  that,  for  many 
people,  technology  can  increase  opportunities  for  realizable 
experiences such as playing, creativity, and improving quality of life, 
therefore contributing to primary prevention and health promotion.
Therapeutic  use  of  digital  media  can  enhance  the  emotions  of 
adolescents with less expression and lethargy. It can also maximize the 
experience of participants in various expression methods to provide 
satisfaction and achievement. Therefore, it has the potential to become 
a strong therapeutic factor. Characteristics of digital media also support 
studies of Ehinger (99) and L’Esperance (100), who have explained that 
digital media can increase adaptation and increase both communication 

and relationship formation in art therapy. Results of this study are also 
consistent with a recent study by Albrecht et al. (45), which has shown 
that interactive digital art can be a useful therapeutic intervention, 
particularly for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
This study was meaningful in that it applied therapeutic digital 
media to adolescents with intellectual disabilities in special education 
classes who had emotional difficulties to help them understand the 
process,  and  draw  conclusions  through  an  actual  case  analysis 
depicting  the  phenomenon  of  digital  art  therapy  with  rich  and 
detailed technology.

5. Limitations and recommendations 
for future studies

First,  this  study  considered  adolescents  with  intellectual 
disabilities attending special classes in a high school in the Republic 
of Korea. Therefore, there is a need for future studies using various 
media to determine the possibility of using digital art therapy for 
adolescents with other types of disabilities.

Second, the initial purchase price of digital media is high. There 
might be an economic burden when it is used in group art therapy.

TABLE 6  Therapeutic factors of group art therapy using digital media.

Therapeutic factors

Description of therapeutic factors

Playfulness

Interactivity

The playfulness of digital media (89, 90) is a powerful therapeutic element. Various play factors, such as realistic images, colors, 

sounds, and touches, stimulated the curiosity and interest of intellectually disabled adolescents who had attention problems and 

synchronization defects. Therefore, it is a therapeutic factor because it has aspects of motivating (90) treatment, relieving tension, 

and expressing itself (91).

Interaction is the most important characteristic of digital media (92). Media and humans are influenced by interaction (93). In 

particular, playful interactions with digital media are attractive to children and adolescents (46). Creativity is created through 

immediate interactions with digital media, and the sensory space that is the result of interaction with media exists within the 

expressive characteristics of digital technology (94). Digital art therapy can comprehensively present visual images, colors, sound, 

photo editing, and storytelling, thus inducing a holistic sensory experience different from traditional art therapy (48). It can be used 

as a therapeutic factor by conveying strong meanings and emotions (95).

The scalability of digital media led to the expansion of time and space, the expansion of expression methods, the expansion of 

physical constraints, the expansion of senses, the expansion of media, and the expansion of experience as therapeutic factors. In 

McLuhan (96)’s core proposition, the term of ‘media is human expansion’ means that the body and senses are expanded through 

Scalability

technology. It is much more suitable as a medium that can expand creativity and flexibility for coping in a changing world (97). It 

can extend physical constraints to new environments that require high levels of participation from people with disabilities or 

underprivileged people. The use of digital technology in art therapy means new possibilities for extending adaptation and esthetic 

experience to new media beyond the increase in access to expanding time and space (9).

However, in the long term, compared to high-quality traditional art 
materials, apps—which are software—can be transformed into cost-
effective tools.

Third, to use digital media, there is a need for further research on 
software that can be combined with art therapy, and education in 
various application programs. Moreover, since few apps have been 
developed  for  use  in  art  therapy,  convergence  research  and 
development between interdisciplinary studies are necessary.

Fourth,  digital  art  therapy  and  traditional  art  therapy  are 
complementary  to  each  other.  Traditional  and  digital  media  have 
different characteristics in nature or expressive characteristics (11). 
Therefore,  it  is  necessary  for  practitioners  to  have  an  in-depth 
understanding  of  both  characteristics  and  differences  between 
traditional and digital media. The author would like to suggest the 
importance of a complementary use of them for therapeutic purposes 
and for assisting in art therapy activities.

6. Conclusion

This study analyzed experiences and therapeutic meanings of 
adolescents with intellectual disabilities in group art therapy using 
digital  media  to  derive  six  themes:  (1)  New  and  fun  digital  art 
therapy;  (2)  enjoying  daily  choices  as  the  protagonist  of  life;  (3) 
Discovery  of  the  positive  power  and  possibilities;  (4)  Digital  art 
therapy enriching experience; (5) Preciousness, and joyfulness of the 
process  of  “being  together”;  and  (6)  Sublimation  to  digital  art 
through immersion. Therapeutic factors that these themes imply in 
digital media have been identified as playfulness, interactionality, 
and scalability. The results of this study show that the use of digital 
media  provides  unlimited  possibilities  for  participants  to  freely 
express their emotions in new ways and can improve various sensory 
experiences  and  creativity.  This  was  an  opportunity  to  develop 
positive  relationships,  improve  self-esteem,  and  develop  digital 
literacy skills by amplifying emotions of teenagers with intellectual 
disabilities and by changing their thinking, feelings, and acting in 

the process of communicating with the media. This qualitative case 
study provides implications that digital media can be a beneficial 
therapeutic  intervention  as  it  can  provide  everyone  with  more 
opportunities, including those with disabilities.
