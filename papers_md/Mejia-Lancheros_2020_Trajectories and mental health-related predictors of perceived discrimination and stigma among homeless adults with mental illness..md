Abstract

Stigma and discrimination toward individuals experiencing homelessness and mental disor-
ders remain pervasive across societies. However, there are few longitudinal studies of
stigma and discrimination among homeless adults with mental illness. This study aimed to
identify the two-year group trajectories of stigma and discrimination and examine the predic-
tive role of mental health characteristics among 414 homeless adults with mental illness par-
ticipating in the extended follow-up phase of the Toronto At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS)
randomized trial site. Mental health-related perceived stigma and discrimination were mea-
sured at baseline, one, and two years using validated scales. Group-based-trajectory
modelling was used to identify stigma and discrimination group trajectory memberships and
the effect of the Housing First treatment (rent supplements and mental health support ser-
vices) vs treatment as usual on these trajectories. The associations between mental health-
related characteristics and trajectory group memberships were also assessed using multi-
nomial logistic regression. Over two-years, three group trajectories of stigma and discrimi-
nation were identified. For discrimination, participants followed a low, moderate, or
increasingly high discrimination group trajectory, while for stigma, participants followed a
low, moderate or high stigma group trajectory. The Housing First treatment had no signifi-
cant effect on discrimination or stigma trajectories groups. For the discrimination trajecto-
ries, major depressive episode, mood disorder with psychotic features, alcohol abuse,
suicidality, severity of mental health symptoms, and substance use severity in the previous
year were predictors of moderate and increasingly high discrimination trajectories. History
of discrimination within healthcare setting was also positively associated with following a
moderate or high discrimination trajectory. For the stigma trajectories, substance depen-
dence, high mental health symptoms severity, substance use severity, and discrimination
experiences within healthcare settings were the main predictors for the moderate trajectory

group; while substance dependence, suicidality, mental health symptom severity, sub-
stance use severity and discrimination experiences within health care setting were also pos-
itive predictors for the high stigma trajectory group. Ethno-racial status modified the
association between having a major depression episode, alcohol dependence, and the likeli-
hood of being a member of the high stigma trajectory group. This study showed that adults
experiencing mental illness and homelessness followed distinct stigma and discrimination
group trajectories based on their mental health-problems. There is an urgent need to
increase focus on strategies and policies to reduce stigma and discrimination in this
population.

Introduction

Stigma and discrimination are pervasive in many societies. Individuals often report feeling dis-
criminated or stigmatized because of their economic situation, gender or sexual orientation,
housing status, social position, ethno-racial status, mental health issues, and substance and
alcohol use [1–7]. Furthermore, individuals with mental disorders face frequent stigma and
discrimination even within social services and healthcare settings designed to support them
[8–11]. Several stereotypes, including violent or dangerous behaviour, anti-social traits, and
being responsible for their situation [12,13], and substance and alcohol use [6] have led to gen-
eralized stigma and discrimination against individuals with mental health problems.

Individuals with mental disorders are at a higher risk of homelessness, and a high propor-
tion of individuals experiencing homelessness are also living with mental illness[14]. Homeless
individuals are commonly stereotyped and discriminated against for their mental health status,
substance and alcohol use, while also being blamed for their condition of being poor, home-
less, unemployed, and for relying on social support benefits[11,15–17]. These experiences of
stigma and discrimination happen in different settings, from everyday surroundings to health-
care, law enforcement, and social service environments [18,19]. In this population, stigma and
discrimination constructs are not only attached to the state of homelessness but also to their
other attributes including their health conditions (e.g., being HIV positive or having mental
health problems)[20–22].

Stigma and discrimination can have a devastating impact on overall wellbeing, health and
recovery of persons experiencing homelessness with and without co-occurring mental disor-
ders[23]. Previous research suggests that discrimination is positively associated with higher
emotional distress[24] and reduced social connections and group membership[25], while
higher levels of internalized stigma are associated with worse mental health symptoms, such as
depressive and psychotic symptoms, and suicidal ideation [26,27].

Limited research has examined longitudinal patterns of perceived stigma and discrimina-
tion among individuals who are homeless or have a mental illness[28]. The existing literature
has mainly focused on single time point prevalence estimates, although longitudinal data is the
only way to understand the persistence of, or changes in, experiences of stigma and discrimi-
nation over time. Moreover, while many studies focus on stereotypes and discrimination
related to mental health in general, or specifically alcohol and substance use [6,7,29], there is a
paucity of research on other mental disorders associated with persistent stigma and discrimi-
nation, either in the general population or among people experiencing homelessness. This lim-
its our understanding of stigma and discrimination related to mental disorders, and therefore,

the implementation of the policies and actions needed to reduce their persistence across
settings.

In this study, we aimed to identify two-year group-based trajectories for mental health-
related stigma and discrimination experienced by homeless adults with mental illness who par-
ticipated in the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) randomized trial of Housing
First with rent supplements and mental health support services. We also aimed to examine the
predictive role of specific mental health diagnoses and problems on membership on these
group trajectories. Finally, we tested the potential modifying effect of ethno-racial status on the
association between mental health problems and discrimination and stigma group trajectories.

Methods
Study population and design

This study includes participants at the Toronto site of the AH/CS study, a large multi-site prag-
matic randomized trial of Housing First (HF) services, conducted between 2009 and 2013 in 5
cities across Canada (Toronto, Moncton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver)[30]. Detailed
information of the Toronto AH/CS study design has been published elsewhere [31]. Briefly,
575 participants were enrolled between October 2009 and July 2011. To be eligible they (i)
were at least 18 years old; (ii) were absolutely homeless or precariously housed, with at least 2
episodes of absolute homelessness or one episode lasting over four weeks in the past year; and
(iii) had a serious mental disorder with or without co-occurring alcohol or substance use
disorder.

Participants were classified as having high needs (HN) for mental health support services if

they exhibited low community functioning (<62 on the Multnomah Community Ability
Scale), had psychotic or bipolar disorder, and met criteria for at least one of the following: two
psychiatric hospitalizations in any one year in the past 5 years, comorbid alcohol or substance
use disorder; or recent arrest or incarceration. The remaining participants were classified as
having moderate needs (MN) for mental health support services [31]. HN and MN partici-
pants were randomized to receive either the HF treatment (rent supplements with assertive
community treatment or intensive case management) or treatment as usual (TAU).

Participants were initially followed for two years between 2009 and 2013 (Phase I). Of the
original 575 participants, 414 consented to additional follow-up from 2014 to 2017 (Phase II).
This study includes Phase II participants, as stigma and discrimination were longitudinally
assessed at yearly intervals over three-time points during this period. Of the 414 participants,
410 (99.0%) and 404 (97.6%) were included in the stigma and discrimination trajectory analy-
ses because they contributed at least one data point during the data collection period.

Ethics approval

The Toronto site of the AH/CS study received approval by the Research Ethics Board of
St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, Canada. All study participants provided written informed
consent to participate in both Phases I and II of the study. The AH/CS study is also registered
with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register
(ISRCTN42520374).

Outcome measures

Discrimination. The ‘Unfair treatment” subscale of the Discrimination and Stigma Scale
(DISC-12) developed by Thornicroft et al. [32] was used to measure perceived discrimination
due to mental problems among our study participants. The scale was administered by face-to-

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229385 February 27, 2020

face interviews at three-time points during Phase II of the AH/CS study: baseline, one-year,
and two-year follow-up. The reference discrimination timeframe was set up to the previous six
months from the administration date using the following question format: “I would like to ask
about times when you have been treated unfairly because of mental health problems in the last
six months. There are 22 questions in this section. For each question, I will ask you to let me
know whether each event has happened not at all [0], a little [1], moderately [2], or a lot [3]”.
The mean score (range 0–3) was calculated as the sum of each item score (0, 1, 2, or 3) divided
by the number of applicable and non-missing items[32]. Higher values indicate greater
discrimination.

Stigma. The 10-item Stigma Experiences Scale [33] was used to assess perceived stigma
experienced by our participants at baseline, one-year and two-years post-baseline of the AH/
CS Phase II. During a face-to-face interview, the following introductory format was used for
the administration of the scale: “The next section asks about your own experiences with stigma.
By stigma, we mean negative feelings people have toward people with a mental illness. In general,
please tell me how often you think or feel about the following: [example] Do you think that people
think less of you if they know you have a mental illness?” The first two items were scored on a
5-point scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, always), while the remaining items were scored
on a 3-point scale (no, unsure, yes). The stigma index scores were calculated following the
methodology used by Stuart H et al [33]. First, we dichotomized the original 5-point questions
as 0 (never, rarely, sometimes) and 1 (often/always), and the 3-point scales as 0 (no, unsure)
and 1 (yes). Next, the 0 and 1 values were summed into an overall count-based stigma index
score ranging between 0 and 10 [33]. Higher values indicate a greater count of stigma
experiences.

Mental health measures

Mental disorders. The following mental health disorders were identified at baseline of the

AH/CS Phase I based on DSM-IV criteria using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview 6.0 [34]: Major Depressive Episode; Manic Episode or Hypomanic Episode; Post-
traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Panic Disorder; Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features;
Psychotic Disorder; Alcohol and Substance Dependence Disorders; Alcohol Abuse, and Sub-
stance Abuse Disorders; and Suicidality.

Mental health symptom severity. The 14-question Colorado Symptom Index (CSI)

[35,36] quantified the frequency of psychiatric symptoms. The overall summary CSI score ran-
ged from 14 to 70 with lower scores indicating lower severity of mental illness.

Substance use severity. The first 5-items of the Substance Use Disorder Scale Short

Screener (GAIN-SS score)[37] were used to assess substance use-related problems experienced
in the previous year. GAIN scores range from 0 to 5, with higher values denoting greater sever-
ity of substance use problems.

Level of need for mental health services. HN and MN levels were based on the algorithm

previously described in the study population and design.

Discrimination in health settings due to mental health problems. Participants were
asked to report at baseline whether they had experienced discrimination within health setting
due to their mental health problems in the previous year (no, yes). Discrimination was assessed
using the following question: “Of all the healthcare visit experiences in the last 12 months, have
you ever felt that the doctor or healthcare staff you saw judged you unfairly or treated you with
disrespect because of: your mental health issues?”[38]

Covariates

Age, gender and ethno-racial status were adjusted for in the analysis. Gender was dichoto-
mized as men/women. Transgender and transsexual participants (n = 6) were included in the
female category as their number was too small to carry out meaningful analyses as a separate
category, and most self-identified as women. Furthermore, ethno-racial status (non-ethno-
racial/ethno-racial) was also assessed as a modifying effect of mental health-related characteris-
tics on the stigma and discrimination group trajectories membership. Since the present study
was embedded within an HF randomized trial, the HF intervention group (HF treatment vs
TAU) was included to adjust for any potential effect of the intervention on the estimates of the
outcomes trajectories.

Data analysis

We identified the stigma and discrimination trajectory groups using the Group-Based Trajec-
tory Model framework[39–41] using the traj statistical program developed by Nagin et al
[42,43].

Discrimination trajectories were estimated using a censored normal distribution model, as

it a psychometric scale with clusters of values at the scales minimum and maximum. Stigma
trajectories were estimated using the Zero-Inflated Poisson model (ZIP), as it is a count-based
scale and to accommodate for the zero occurrences. We used the following steps to identify
the discrimination and stigma trajectories memberships. First, we identified the number and
shape of the group-based trajectories for both discrimination and stigma (unadjusted trajec-
tory model) by fitting several models using the intercept (0), slope (1), quadratic (2) and cubic
(3) functions. We selected the most suitable based-trajectory model for our participants by
considering the following criteria as a whole [39]: (1) the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) (lower values indicate better fit); (2) the average values of the posterior probability of the
assignment to the trajectory groups (> 0.70 for all groups is an indication that participants are
well classified); (3) the weighted odds of correct classification into the corresponding trajectory
group (values > 5 for all identified group indicate better assignment accuracy); (4) the confi-
dence interval for the group membership probabilities (narrower confidence intervals indi-
cates more accuracy of the estimated group probability).

Second, in order to adjust for the potential effect of the HF intervention on the observed
trajectories, we added an indicator of the intervention group (HF vs TAU) in the final selected
model. The trajectory groups derived from the adjusted models were used for subsequent anal-
yses. We labelled low, moderate and high trajectory groups according to the group pathway
participants followed.

For the discrimination group trajectories, we assigned the following labels: low, moderate,

and increasing high. The ‘low trajectory group’ denotes the group of participants who had
lower discrimination values at baseline and continued to have similar low values at the first
and second year of follow-up. The ‘moderate trajectory group’ includes participants who had
similar moderate mean discrimination values at baseline and 2-years follow-up, with slightly
higher values at the 1-year of follow-up. The ‘increasing high trajectory group’ denotes the
group of participants who started with higher discrimination mean values at baseline, had
slightly lower values at 1 year of follow-up but had rising discrimination score values at the
2-year follow-up point.

Similarly, for the stigma group trajectories, we assigned the following labels: low, moderate,
and high. The ‘low trajectory group’ denotes the group of participants who reported low values
of stigma from baseline to the 2-year of the follow-up period. The ‘moderate trajectory group’
includes participants with similar moderate stigma values at baseline and year 2 follow up,

Discrimination and stigma trajectories in homeless adults with mental illness

with slightly decreased values at the 1-year of follow-up. The ‘high trajectory group’ denotes
the group of participants who had persisting higher stigma values from baseline to the 2-year
follow-up.

Third, for both outcomes, separate multinomial logistic models were used to evaluate the

association between each mental health characteristic and group trajectory membership,
adjusting for age, gender and ethno-racial group membership.

Finally, we explored the modifying effect of ethno-racial status by including a set of interac-
tion terms between each mental health characteristic and ethno-racial status. We used the pre-
dictive margin effects (margins and marginsplot commands) to estimate the probability of our
participants being a member of a discrimination and stigma trajectory group based on ethno-
racial status and mental-health characteristics (this were only performed for those interactions
that were statistically significant).

The Toronto AH/CS study was sampled to detect an effect size of 0.5 between HF and TAU

groups for the major outcomes (housing stability, community functioning, quality of life),
assuming statistical power of 80%[30,31,44]. For this secondary analysis, the statistical power
remained >80% following a power calculation performed using the power and sample-size fea-
tures in the Stata Software/SE 15.0 [45]. We also assumed a statistical significance level of 0.05
in our analyses. All the analyses were performed using Stata Software/SE 15.0 [45].

Results

The description of baseline demographic and mental health characteristics of Phase II study
participants (N = 414) are presented in S1 Table. Participants were on average 40.4 (±11.6)
years old, were more often men (67.6%), and identified as having non-white ethno-racial status
(56.8%). Substance dependence (39.6%), depression (36.5%), psychosis (35.3%), and alcohol
dependence (30.7%) were the more prevalent mental disorders in our sample. Of our partici-
pants, 34.1% had a high level of need for mental health services, and 68.1% experienced
suicidality.

Discrimination group trajectories

Fig 1 shows the unadjusted (panel A) and adjusted for HF intervention (panel B) trajectory
groups for discrimination. The BIC criteria for the several groups and polynomial combina-
tion trajectories models are presented in S2 Table, and the growth functions and fitting esti-
mates of the model growth are presented in S3 and S4 Tables, respectively. The HF
intervention was not associated (S5 Table) with the probability of membership in any of the
trajectory groups (Fig 1B). Both the unadjusted and adjusted group trajectory models (Fig 1)
showed similar percentage of people within each trajectory group. In the adjusted trajectory
groups, 70.6% of participants were more likely to be in the low discrimination trajectory,
22.4% in the moderate discrimination group trajectory, and approximately 6.9% in the
increasing high discrimination trajectory group.

Mental health characteristics and discrimination group trajectories

Table 1 summarizes the unadjusted and adjusted associations between mental-health charac-
teristics and discrimination group trajectory. Participants with major depressive episodes were
more likely to belong to the low discrimination trajectory group than moderate discrimination
trajectory group. Participants with a mood disorder with psychotic symptoms or suicidality
were significantly more likely to be a member of the moderate discrimination group than the
low discrimination group. In contrast, participants with higher severity of mental health symp-
toms and those experiencing discrimination within health settings were more likely to be

abuse were significantly more likely to be in the high discrimination trajectory group than in
the low discrimination group. Ethno-racial status was not an effect modifier for discrimination
trajectory groups.

Stigma trajectory group trajectories

groups for stigma. The BIC criteria for the group and polynomial combination trajectory mod-
els are shown in S6 Table, while the estimates of the growth parameters and those of the assign-
ment and classification accuracy for the trajectory models are shown in S7 and S8 Tables,
respectively. The adjustment of the stigma group trajectory for the HF intervention group
showed a minimal and non-statistically significant effect on the trajectory membership proba-
bility values (S9 Table). Both the unadjusted and adjusted stigma trajectories models (Fig 2A
and 2B) showed that the proportion of people in the stigma trajectory groups was similar for
unadjusted and adjusted estimates. In the adjusted stigma trajectory model, 18.0% of partici-
pants were in the low stigma trajectory group, 27.2% of participants were more likely to be a
member of the moderate stigma group, while over half (54.8%) of the participants were more
likely to be in the high stigma trajectory group.

in the low stigma trajectory group. Participants with suicidality were more likely to be members
of the high stigma trajectory group than of the low stigma trajectory group. Participants with
manic episode or hypomanic episode also tended to be part of the high stigma trajectory group,
approaching but not reaching the statistical significance threshold (p = 0.077).

Ethno-racial status had a modifying effect on the associations between major depressive
episodes, alcohol dependence or suicidality on stigma trajectory group membership. Specifi-
cally, participants with a major depressive episode or alcohol dependence who also identified
as ethno-racial were more likely to be a member of the high stigma trajectory group (Fig 3A
and 3B). Conversely, participants with suicidality who also identified as ethno-racial were
more likely to be a member of the low stigma trajectory group (Fig 3C). There was no observed
effect modifications of ethno-racial status for the other studied mental health characteristics.

Discussion

In this two-year longitudinal cohort study of homeless adults with mental illness participating
in Phase II of the AH/CS study at the Toronto site, we identified that our participants followed

three distinct group trajectories for both discrimination (low, moderate, and increasing high)
and stigma (low, moderate and high). We also found several baseline mental-health-related
characteristics to predict discrimination and stigma trajectory group membership. For the
stigma trajectory groups specifically, our study additionally identified an interaction between
ethno-racial status and major depressive disorder, alcohol dependence, and suicidality.

The longitudinal trajectories analyses provide new information on perceived stigma and

discrimination due to mental health problems among homeless adults with mental illness,
showing that these attitudes and behaviours remain persistent over time, even within a more
socially inclusive context as is Canada. A previous point in time analysis from Phase I of the
AH/CS study showed that 23.8% of participants experienced discriminated due to their mental
health problems, based on a different measuring tool, used to assess discrimination within the
health care setting [38]. Similarly, Corrigan et al. found that around 19.1% of 696 people with
mental health disabilities reported discrimination because of their mental disability, with
27.5% of these experiences occurring within the mental health system [46]. High levels of per-
ceived stigma and discrimination toward people who are homeless and living with mental ill-
ness have also been previously reported in studies with cross-sectional design [15,17,47,48].

Our study also highlighted that receiving the HF intervention (rent supplements with asser-
tive community treatment or intensive case management) did not influence the probability of
membership in discrimination or stigma group trajectories. While the HF model has a positive
impact on housing stability[49], these findings suggest the potential impact of HF on non-
housing outcomes such as stigma and discrimination is limited. Therefore, multidimensional
support services and efforts are needed [50] to address the structural socioeconomic barriers

and mechanisms that contribute to stigma and of people experiencing or at risk of homeless-
ness, with and without mental illness.

We found that several baseline clinical characteristics were significant predictors of partici-

pants’ membership to stigma and discrimination trajectory groups. In particular, we found
that participants who had a major depressive episode at baseline were more likely to follow the
low discrimination trajectory group. These findings may be explained by symptom resolution
by the time of the Phase II study. Alternatively, depression might affect the perception and
views of the nature and degree of everyday life circumstances [51,52], including discrimination
experiences. Another potential explanation may be that depressive symptoms may be more
acceptable compared to other mental disorders, possibly due to the high prevalence of depres-
sion in the general population, or to the passive acceptance or non-reactive or confrontational
response by individuals with depression disorders [53].

Furthermore, we found that having a mood disorder with psychotic features, suicidality,
and more severe mental health symptoms were associated with being a member of the moder-
ate or high discrimination and stigma trajectory groups. Although death by suicide is quite
common among homeless people [54–57], no previous studies have examined suicidality as a
predictor of health-related discrimination and stigma trajectories in this population. Studies

carried out in the general population or subgroups of people with mental illness and those
from social minorities, have found general stigma and mental health-related stigma to be asso-
ciated with suicidal ideation and high suicide risk [58–61]. Higher levels of prejudicial and
stigmatizing attitudes have also been reported by individuals experiencing suicidal ideation or
who have attempted suicide [59]. Mental illness severity has previously been identified as a
predictor of stigma among people with mental health problems [62,63].

In our study, participants with alcohol abuse were also more likely to be a member of the
high discrimination trajectory group, and those with substances dependence tended to be part
of the moderate to high stigma group trajectory. In addition, when examining substance use
severity, participants with higher severity scores were more likely to be a member of the mod-
erate or high discrimination and stigma trajectory groups. Homeless people with alcohol and
substance use disorders frequently experience generalized and health-related discrimination
and stigma [12,64–66].

In addition, experiences of discrimination due to the mental health problems in a health
care setting was a particularly strong predictor of membership to the high discrimination and
stigma trajectory groups in our study population. Homeless people often feel unwelcome, mis-
judged and mistreated when visiting health care settings or attending health care encounters
[67], reflecting pervasive discriminatory and stigmatizing attitudes and behaviours against the
homeless population at the societal level.

Discrimination and stigma trajectories in homeless adults with mental illness

Finally, we found that the participants’ ethno-racial status could modify the association

between having a major depression episode or alcohol dependence and stigma trajectory
group membership. Existing studies in non-homeless populations suggest that ethno-racial
and cultural identities can contribute to variations in the perception of mental illness and the
associated stigma[2,68]. Moreover, homeless individuals with a mental illness who identify as
ethno-racially diverse not only face discrimination and stigma due to their homelessness state
or mental health problems but also due to their skin colour[20], which can have a devastating
impact on their recovery and overall wellbeing.

The following limitations should be noted when interpreting our study findings. First, we

were only able to use two years of the follow-up data to estimate discrimination and stigma
group trajectories. While this improves upon the one point in time measures in previous stud-
ies, the limited time points analysed may have reduced the variability and number of trajecto-
ries identified. Still, the final trajectories models were chosen based on the suggested criteria
and methodology for this type of analysis [39,41–43]. Second, the identified discrimination
and stigma group trajectories are flexible rather than fixed and individual pathways [39,40],
and therefore their generalizability to other homeless populations may be limited. However,
by accounting for the heterogeneity of the characteristics and features of the studied popula-
tions [35,36], these findings allow a closer understanding of the potential predictive factors of
the longitudinal patterns of stigma and discrimination. Third, we used mental health-related
factors that were assessed on average 2.8 years prior to the first discrimination and stigma mea-
sures, which may not represent mental health-related disorders and problems at the time
when stigma and discrimination outcomes were measured. Finally, the number of transgen-
dered and transsexual individuals was too small to analyze separately, and given that most self-
identified as women, they were categorized with females in the analysis, foregoing the opportu-
nity to explore their unique experiences.

The present study findings have the following research, practice, and policy implications.
First, findings suggest that stigma and discrimination towards homeless people with mental ill-
ness are pervasive. Both social and health policy interventions are needed to reduce stigma and
discrimination against vulnerable groups, including interventions within social services and
health care settings. Our study also highlighted that clinical characteristics can predict the dis-
crimination and stigma trajectories followed by homeless adults with mental illness. Therefore,
efforts to reduce the detrimental effects of stigma and discrimination faced by adults
experiencing homelessness with a mental illness may be targeted to particularly vulnerable
subgroups [69,70]. For example, public anti-stigma and anti-discrimination educational cam-
paigns that target specific population groups, such as students or health care providers
[50,71,72], can contribute to increasing awareness and knowledge of mental health, alcohol
and substance use problems, and homelessness. Interventions that centre around social-con-
tact between people with and without mental illness have also been effective in improving
stigma-related knowledge and attitude in a short term[72]; thus, it can also be a great strategy
to reduce the stereotypes and discrimination against individuals who experience homelessness
with a mental illness. Furthermore, systematic screening for experiences of stigma and dis-
crimination could be implemented within social support and health-related service environ-
ments, in order to measurably reduce stereotyping and negative behaviours. Finally, given the
persistently high levels of stigma and discrimination experienced by many vulnerable groups,
further research on effective interventions is needed to impact policy and practice.

In conclusion, adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness face moderate to high
trajectories of stigma and discrimination over time. Membership in each trajectory group can
depend on specific mental health-related problems, such as major depressive episodes,

suicidality or alcohol use. As such, there is a need to implement strategies and policies to
