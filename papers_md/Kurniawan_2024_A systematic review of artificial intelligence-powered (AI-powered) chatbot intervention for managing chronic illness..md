ABSTRACT
Background:  Utilizing  artificial  intelligence  (ai)  in  chatbots,  especially  for  chronic  diseases,  has 
become  increasingly  prevalent.  these  ai-powered  chatbots  serve  as  crucial  tools  for  enhancing 
patient  communication,  addressing  the  rising  prevalence  of  chronic  conditions,  and  meeting  the 
growing  demand  for  supportive  healthcare  applications.  however,  there  is  a  notable  gap  in 
comprehensive  reviews  evaluating  the  impact  of  ai-powered  chatbot  interventions  in  healthcare 
within  academic  literature.  this  study  aimed  to  assess  user  satisfaction,  intervention  efficacy,  and 
the  specific  characteristics  and  ai  architectures  of  chatbot  systems  designed  for  chronic  diseases.
Method:  a  thorough  exploration  of  the  existing  literature  was  undertaken  by  employing  diverse 
databases such as PubMed MeDliNe,  ciNahl,  eMBase, PsyciNFO,  acM Digital  library and  scopus. 
the  studies  incorporated  in  this  analysis  encompassed  primary  research  that  employed  chatbots 
or  other  forms  of  ai  architecture  in  the  context  of  preventing,  treating  or  rehabilitating  chronic 
diseases.  the  assessment  of  bias  risk  was  conducted  using  Risk  of  2.0  tools.
Results:  seven  hundred  and  eighty-four  results  were  obtained,  and  subsequently,  eight  studies 
were  found  to  align  with  the  inclusion  criteria.  the  intervention  methods  encompassed  health 
education (n = 3), behaviour change theory (n = 1), stress and coping (n = 1), cognitive behavioural 
therapy  (n  =  2)  and  self-care  behaviour  (n  =  1).  the  research  provided  valuable  insights  into  the 
effectiveness  and  user-friendliness  of  ai-powered  chatbots  in  handling  various  chronic  conditions. 
Overall,  users  showed  favourable  acceptance  of  these  chatbots  for  self-managing  chronic  illnesses.
Conclusions:  the  reviewed  studies  suggest  promising  acceptance  of  ai-powered  chatbots  for 
self-managing  chronic  conditions.  however,  limited  evidence  on  their  efficacy  due  to  insufficient 
technical  documentation  calls  for  future  studies  to  provide  detailed  descriptions  and  prioritize 
patient  safety.  these  chatbots  employ  natural  language  processing  and  multimodal  interaction. 
subsequent  research  should  focus  on  evidence-based  evaluations,  facilitating  comparisons  across 
diverse  chronic  health  conditions.

Introduction

the  incidence  of  chronic  illnesses  is  experiencing  a 
worldwide  upsurge,  presenting  one  of  the  foremost 
healthcare  challenges  in  the  twenty-first  century  [1]. 
these  enduring  conditions  have  long-lasting  ramifica-
tions,  extending  over  an  individual’s  entire  lifespan, 
necessitating  ongoing  management  by  both  patients 
and  healthcare  practitioners  [2].  the  enduring  nature 
of  chronic  ailments  significantly  impacts  individuals’ 
health  related  quality  life  and  generates  substantial 
healthcare  costs  due  to  disability,  recurrent  hospitaliza-
tions  and  treatment  measures  [3].

Digital  health  interventions  have  garnered  special 
attention  from  the  World  health  Organization  (WhO) 
as  a  means  to  improve  public  healthcare  services  and 
attain  universal  health  coverage.  in  more  recent  times, 
the focal point of digital health intervention has veered 
from  conventional  domains  such  as  ehealth  or  mobile 
health  towards  the  frontiers  of  advanced  computa-
tional  sciences,  notably  encompassing  big  data  analyt-
ics,  genomics  and  artificial  intelligence  (ai)  [4].  the 
utilization  of  ai  in  the  realm  of  healthcare  has  gar-
nered  extensive  traction,  encompassing  pivotal  facets 
such  as  early-stage  disease  detection,  interpretation  of 
treatment 
disease  progression,  optimization  of

regimens,  and  the  advent  of  pioneering  intervention 
strategies  [5].

Digital  intervention  in  healthcare  using  ai-powered 
chatbots  has  become  increasingly  pervasive  as  a  result 
of  improvements  in  ai,  natural  language  processing 
(NlP)  and  voice  recognition.  these  sophisticated  com-
puter  programs  are  meticulously  crafted  to  emulate 
and  effectively  process  human  dialogues,  whether  they 
are  in  written  or  spoken  form.  consequently,  users  are 
afforded  the  unique  opportunity  to  interact  with  digi-
in  a  manner  that  strikingly  resembles 
tal  devices 
engaging  in  a  conversation  with  an  authentic  human 
interlocutor  [2,6,7].  the  most  recent  developments  in 
ai  enable  interactions  that  are  more  and  more  like 
those  between  people  and  their  computer  agent 
counterparts  [8,9].  the  simulation  of  communication 
between  humans  and  machines  has  become  increas-
intricate  and  sophisticated  [10].  the  chatbot 
ingly 
industry  has  witnessed  a  substantial  growth  in  sectors 
such  as  e-commerce,  travel,  tourism  and  healthcare, 
which  are  aiming  to  achieve 
interactions  with  a 
human-like  quality  [11].

ai-powered  chatbots  have  demonstrated  significant 
benefits  across  various  industries,  with  the  healthcare 
sector  being  a  prime  example.  they  have  been 
employed  to  provide  cost-effective,  scalable  medical 
support  solutions  that  can  be  accessed  anytime 
through  online  platforms  or  smartphone  applications 
[12,13].  For  instance,  chatbots  providing  assistance  and 
monitoring  to  adults  receiving  cancer  treatment  led  to 
reduced  levels  of  anxiety,  eliminating  the  need  for  the 
involvement  of  a  healthcare  professional  [14].  chatbots 
can  play  a  crucial  role  in  enhancing  consultations  by 
assisting  patients  and  clinicians,  supporting  individuals 
in  modifying  their  behaviour,  and  aiding  senior  citizens 
in  their  homes  [15].  in  addition,  chatbots  possess  the 
capacity  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  achievement  of 
particular  objectives,  such  as  self-monitoring  and  sur-
mounting  barriers  to  self-management.  these  func-
tions  hold  significant 
in  the  realm  of 
chronic  illness  management  [2,16].

Numerous  research  has  reported  various  advan-

implementation  of 
ai-powered  chatbots  in  diverse  healthcare  contexts. 
these  advantages  encompass  but  are  not  limited  to 
promoting  behaviour  modification,  delivering  guid-
ance  for  adopting  a  healthy  lifestyle,  offering  assis-
tance  to  individuals  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer,  and 
enabling  self-reporting  of  medical  histories  among 
therapy  patients  [17,18].

Prior  investigations  primarily  emphasized  the  tech-
nical  facets  of  ai-powered  chatbot  development, 
often  involving  a  limited  participant  pool  or  adopting 

studies 

a  pilot  study  framework  [19].  Furthermore,  three 
reviews  on  ai-powered  chatbots  interventions  predi-
cated  on  conversational  modalities  within  healthcare 
settings  encompassed 
characterized  by 
diverse  methodologies,  case  studies,  uncontrolled 
clinical  trials  and  single-group  designs  [19–21].  some 
reviews  adopted  a  singular  and  focused  intervention 
approach,  such  as  exclusively  examining  social  robots 
within  psychosocial 
interventions  [22],  or  concen-
trated  solely  on  specific  outcomes,  particularly  men-
tal  well-being  [23].

there is a conspicuous absence of systematic reviews 
that  have  systematically  assessed  the  evidence  derived 
from  randomized  controlled  trials  (Rcts)  pertaining  to 
interventions  employing  ai-powered  chatbot  within  the 
healthcare  domain.  the  matter  of  information  quality 
concerning  ai-powered  chatbot 
in  the  context  of 
healthcare  interventions  remains  a  facet  insufficiently 
addressed  by  prior  systematic  reviews.  consequently, 
this  systematic  review  is  poised  to  specifically  scrutinize 
Rct  concerning  the 
implementation  of  ai-powered 
interventions  within  the  healthcare  setting.

Notably,  this  review  will  encompass  a  rigorous  evalua-
tion  and  discourse  on  the  information  quality  associ-
ated  with  the  examined  ai-powered  chatbot.  it  will 
undertake  a  comprehensive  and  thorough  examination 
of  the  existing  body  of  evidence  related  to  ai-powered 
chatbot  healthcare  interventions  to  date.  the  review 
will  delve  into  aspects  encompassing  the  user  satisfac-
tion,  effectiveness  and  patient  safety  of  these  interven-
tions.  Furthermore,  it  will  culminate  in  the  formulation 
of  recommendations  for  prospective  research  endeav-
ours  and  the  pragmatic  utilization  of  ai-powered  chat-
bot  interventions  in  healthcare  settings.

Search  strategy

in  February  2023,  an  extensive  search  was  performed 
on  english-language  articles  published  from  2013  to 
2023,  using  multiple  reputable  databases  including 
PubMed  MeDliNe,  ciNahl,  eMBase,  PsyciNFO,  acM 

Digital  library  and  scopus.  Various  search  terms  were 
employed  and  applied  consistently  across  all  data-
bases.  these  terms  included:  (chatbot  or  ‘conversa-
tional  agent’  or  ‘social  bot*’  or  ‘softbot*’  or  ‘virtual 
agent’  or  ‘automated  agent’  or  ‘automated  bot’  or  ‘vir-
tual  therap*’)  aND  (randomi*)  aND  (clinical  or  stud*  or 
trial)  aND  (health  or  nurs*  or  disease*  or  illness*).  the 
detailed  search  strategy  for  PubMed  can  be  found  in 
appendix  1.  similar  combinations  of  search  terms  were 
utilized  for  the  other  databases.

involvement; 

incorporated  within  this  study  were  original  research 
investigations  meeting  the  following  criteria:  (1)  incor-
poration  of  elements  pertaining  to  ai-powered  chat-
bots  within  their  intervention  framework,  regardless  of 
intention  to  assess  the 
therapist 
impact  of  the  intervention  on  outcomes  relevant  to 
healthcare;  (3)  classification  as  primary  studies  employ-
ing  a  Rct,  encompassing  both  pilot  and  feasibility 
studies;  (4)  focal  point  on  a  chronic  illness  condition, 
with  participants  being  a  minimum  of  18  years  of  age. 
conversely,  studies  were  excluded  if  they:  (1)  were 
solely  available  in  abstract  form  without  access  to  the 
full  text;  (2)  constituted  study  protocols  or  trial  regis-
trations  lacking  the  dissemination  of  research  out-
comes;  (3)  were  studies  not  published  in  the  english 
language.

Screening,  data  extraction  and  data  synthesis

after  the  searches  were  concluded,  all  identified  cita-
tions  were  obtained.  then,  reference  management 
software  like  endnote©  and  Mendeley©,  used  under 
proper  copyright  authorization,  was  utilized  to  remove 
any  duplicate  entries.  subsequently,  the  titles  and 
abstracts  of  each  article  were  extracted  from  the  refer-
ence  manager  and  imported  into  an  excel  spreadsheet 
for  additional  analysis.

Prior  to  commencing  the  screening  process,  prelim-
inary  screenings  were  conducted.  subsequently,  an 
investigating  filter  based  on  the  information  available 
in  the  article  titles  and  abstracts  was  applied  as  the 
initial  filtering  criterion.  this  screening  procedure  was

additionally,  the  full-text  screening  was  performed  by 
two  impartial  evaluators.  in  order  to  address  any  dis-
agreements  regarding  the  exclusion  of  specific  articles, 
two  independent  reviewers  engaged  in  a  Zoom  meet-

from 

the  evaluation  of  user  satisfaction  in  relation  to 
chatbots  entailed  an  examination  of  the  system’s  prop-
erties  or  components  from  the  perspectives  of  users. 
Both  quantitative  and  qualitative  techniques  were 
employed  to  assess  user  satisfaction.  in  addition  to 
examining  health  outcomes  such  as  diagnostic  accu-
racy  or  symptom  alleviation,  considerations  were  given 
to  health-related  metrics  and  patient  safety  within  the 
included  studies.  the  assessed  characteristics  of  the 
chatbots  identified  in  the  selected  studies  remain  per-
tinent.  a  meta-analysis  was  precluded  by  the  diversity 
observed  in  the  types  of  interventions,  outcomes  and 
settings  across  the  studies  under  review.

Study  risk  of  bias  assessment

two expert reviewers (hh and tN) individually assessed 
the  quality  of  eligible  studies.  the  Rcts  underwent 
evaluation  using  the  cochrane  Risk  of  Bias  2.0  tool 
[25].  this  tool  scrutinized  various  aspects  such  as  ran-
dom  allocation  concealment,  sequence  generation, 
blinding  of  participants  and  personnel, 
incomplete 
outcome  data,  blinding  of  outcome  assessment,  selec-
tive  reporting  and  other  potential  biases.  Reviewers 
were  instructed  to  render  a  judgment  of  ‘yes’  (indicat-
ing  low  bias),  ‘no’  (indicating  high  bias)  or  ‘unclear’ 
(suggesting  either  a  lack  of  pertinent  information  or 
uncertainty  regarding  bias)  for  each  criterion.  any  dis-
agreements  arising  from  the  quality  assessment  con-
ducted  by  the  two  reviewers  (hh  and  tN)  were 
resolved  by  a  third  reviewer  (Rt).

Results

in  this  study,  an  extensive  search  was  carried  out  in 
six  databases,  resulting 
in  a  total  of  784  articles. 
Following  the  removal  of  duplicates,  247  unique  arti-
cles  were  retained.  these  articles  underwent  initial 
assessment  based  on  their  titles  and  abstracts,  leading 
to  the  identification  of  97  relevant  studies.  after  a 
thorough  examination  of  the  full  texts,  97  articles 
were  excluded.  Furthermore,  89  studies  were  elimi-
nated  based  on  the  predefined  criteria,  ultimately 
resulting  in  eight  articles  qualified  for  included  stud-
ies.  a  visual  depiction  of  this  selection  process  is  pre-
sented  in  Figure  1.

platforms,  web  or  mobile  applications.  Out  of  the  eight 
ai-powered  chatbots  considered 
in  this  review,  all 
studies  were  classified  as  chatbots,  which  are  software 
systems  designed  to  emulate  human  conversation 
through  voice  or  text-based  interactions.  three  studies 
were  not  specified  in  ai  methods  [14,28,30].  table  3 
presents  the  characterization  of  ai-powered  chatbots 
as  described  in  the  reviewed  papers.  the  chatbots  dis-
cussed  in  these  papers  employed  a  range  of  ai  tech-
niques, such as speech recognition and NlP, to facilitate 
their  functionality.

the  encompassed  studies  featured  various  theoreti-
cal  approaches,  such  as  health  education  (n  =  3), 
behaviour  change  theory  (n  =  1),  stress  and  coping 
(n  =  1),  cognitive  behaviour  therapy  (n  =  2)  and 
self-care  behaviour  (n  =  1).  the  duration  of  interven-
tions  utilizing  ai-powered  chatbots  varied,  ranging 
from  short-term  (four  weeks)  to  long-term  (one  or  two 
years),  contingent  on  the  intended  purpose  and  tar-
geted  health  concerns.  some  studies  (n  =  3)  allowed 
for  flexible  usage  with  unrestricted  access  to  the  con-
versational  agent  throughout  the  intervention  phase,

Description  of  included  studies

according  to  the  data  presented  in  table  1,  a  compre-
hensive  total  of  10  studies  were  included  in  this  review. 
Out  of  the  eight  studies,  five  focused  primarily  on 
patients,  providing  support  for  education  and  self-care 
[27–31]. three studies offered assistance to both patients 
and  healthcare  professionals 
in  utilizing  ai-powered 
chatbots  for  treatment  and  education  [14,26,32].

investigated,  cancer, 
including  breast  cancer,  post-cancer  treatment  and 
geriatric  oncology,  was  the  subject  of  investigation  in 
four  studies  [14,26,27,32].  One  studying  type  2  diabe-
tes  [29].  One  studying  irritable  bowel  syndrome  [31]. 
Other  conditions  studied  chronic  pain  [30],  and  hyper-
tension  [28].

Regarding methods, all studies used Rcts [14,26–32].

available,  while  five  [14,26–28,31]  raised  some  con-
cerns  regarding  potential  bias  in  outcome  measure-
ment.  this  was  attributed  to  either  the  omission  of 
blinding  in  the  assessment  process  or  the  utilization 
of  an  unsuitable  method  to  evaluate  the  interven-
tion’s  effects.  Detailed  results  are  presented

One  study  noted  notable  enhancements  in  quality

interventions  employing  ai-powered  chatbots  could 
furnish  disease-related  information  with  a  satisfaction 
level  comparable  to  responses  from  clinicians  [27].

Discussion

this  study  represents  the  inaugural  systematic  review 
dedicated  to  evaluating  the  user  satisfaction  of  inter-
ventions  employing  ai-powered  chatbots  within  the 
healthcare  sector.  the  comprehensive  findings  affirm 
the  feasibility,  acceptability  and  effectiveness  of  inter-
ventions  incorporating  ai-powered  chatbots  in  improv-
ing  various  healthcare  outcomes, 
including  health- 
related  metrics  and  patient  safety.  these  results  have 
significant  implications  for  the  potential  integration  of 
ai-powered  chatbots 
interven-
tions.  however,  it  is  essential  to  approach  these  find-
ings  with  caution  due  to  certain  trials  having  modest 
sample  sizes,  and  a  notable  proportion  of  included 
studies  displaying  a  heightened 
risk  of  bias. 
Furthermore,  this  review  addresses  a  notable  gap  in 
prior  research  by  evaluating  the  quality  of  information, 
augmenting  the  existing  literature  on  the  subject.

in  future  healthcare 

the  results  of  this  review  highlight  that  interven-
tions  utilizing  ai-powered  chatbots  offer  notable 
advantages  in  terms  of  accessibility  and  engagement, 
potentially  contributing  to  the  observed  low  attrition 
rates  and  high  adherence  to  intervention  protocols. 
however,  qualitative  insights  from  the  review  also  shed 
light on challenges faced in the adoption of ai-powered 
chatbot  interventions.  Future  research  should  focus  on 
enhancing  these  interventions  by  proactively  address-
ing  issues  such  as  technical  glitches  and  refining  artifi-
cial  methods 
through  more  comprehensive  and 
insightful  training  of  the  ai  systems.

the  interventions  incorporating  ai-powered  chat-
bots,  as  examined  in  the  reviewed  studies,  demon-
strated  significant  impacts  across  various  health  and 
nursing  dimensions.  these  encompassed 
improve-
ments  in  physical  function,  adoption  of  healthier  life-
style  practices,  enhancement  of  mental  health, 

promotion  of  psychosocial  well-being,  and  improve-
ments  in  pain  management  and  related  parameters. 
importantly,  some  of  the  reviewed  studies  suggested 
that  ai-powered  chatbot  interventions  demonstrated 
efficacy  comparable  to  interventions  led  by  healthcare 
professionals  or  physicians,  consistent  with  findings 
from  previous  reviews  [19].  these  positive  outcomes 
underscore  the  potential  of  ai-powered  chatbots  in 
addressing  the  growing  healthcare  demands,  particu-
larly  in  providing  support  during  and  after  hospital 
visits  or  patient  appointments.

a  recent  systematic  review  assessed  the  effects  of 
automated  telephone  communication  systems,  which 
lack  natural  language  understanding,  on  preventive 
healthcare  and  chronic  condition  management.  this 
review  by  Posadzki  et  al.  [33]  indicated  that  these  sys-
tems  have  the  potential  to  enhance  specific  health 
improve  health  outcomes.  Notably, 
behaviours  and 
advancements  in  dialogue  management  and  NlP  tech-
niques  have  surpassed  the  rule-based  approaches 
prevalent  in  the  studies  included  in  our  investigation 
[14,28,30].  While  rule-based  approaches  in  finite-state 
dialogue  management  systems  have  a  straightforward 
construction process and are suitable for well-structured 
tasks,  they  restrict  user  input  to  predefined  words  and 
phrases,  limiting  the  user’s  ability  to  initiate  dialogues 
and  correct  misrecognized  elements  [34].  in  contrast, 
frame-based  systems  provide  enhanced  capabilities  for 
system  and  mixed-initiative  interactions,  allowing  for  a 
more  flexible  dialogue  structure  [34].

to  provide  additional 

Both  finite-state  and  frame-based  methodologies 
can  manage  tasks  by  requesting  user  input  through 
form  completion,  but  frame-based  systems  excel  in 
accommodating  user  responses  in  a  non-linear  fashion, 
enabling  users 
information 
beyond  what  is  strictly  required  by  the  system.  in  this 
context,  the  ai-powered  chatbot  effectively  maintains 
and  organizes  essential  information,  adapting  its  inqui-
ries  accordingly.  through  our  comprehensive  review, 
we  identified  five  ai-powered  chatbots  (consisting  of 
three  task-oriented  and  two  non-task-oriented)  that 
utilized  the  frame-based  approach  to  manage  dia-
logues.  these  agents  primarily  focused  on  facilitating 
self-management  tasks  and  gathering  data  [26,27,29, 
31,32].

agent-based  systems,  in  comparison  to  finite-state 
and  frame-based  systems,  exhibit  notable  capacity  for 
effectively  managing  complex  dialogues,  empowering 
users  to  initiate  and  guide  the  conversation.  Dialogue 
management  techniques  in  agent-based  systems  often 
employ  statistical  models  trained  on  authentic  human–
computer  dialogues,  offering  advantages  such  as 
enhanced  speech  recognition,  improved  performance, 

greater  scalability  and  increased  adaptability  [34,35]. 
Recent  advancements  in  machine  learning,  along  with 
a  resurgence  of  interest  in  neural  networks,  have  sig-
nificantly  advanced  the  development  of  advanced  and 
efficient  conversational  agents  [35,36]. 
interestingly, 
the  utilization  of  agent  based  dialogue  management 
techniques  seems  to  be  limited  in  healthcare  applica-
tion  programs.  Within  the  scope  of  our  review,  no 
studies  were  found  that  examined  the  implementation 
of  such  ai-powered  chatbots  specifically  within  the 
healthcare  domain.

it  was  observed  that 

the  reviewed  studies  demonstrate  that  interven-
tions  utilizing  ai-powered  chatbot  have  yielded  signif-
icant  effects  on  a  range  of  health  and  nursing 
outcomes. these  encompass  enhancements  in  physical 
function,  improvements  in  quality  of  life,  psychosocial 
well-being,  as  well  as  outcomes  related  to  pain. 
in  certain  studies, 
Moreover, 
ai-powered  chatbot  interventions  yielded  results  on 
par  with  those  achieved  through  physical  interventions 
or  those  led  by  healthcare  worker.  this  corroborates 
findings  from  previous  reviews  which  consistently 
reported  positive  impacts  of  ai-powered  chatbot  inter-
ventions  on  healthcare  outcomes  [19].  the  positive 
outcomes  of  ai-powered  chatbot  interventions  under-
score  their  potential  in  meeting  the  expanding  health-
care  demands,  especially 
in  the  context  of  health 
intervention,  including  the  need  for  assistance  during 
and  after  hospital  visits  or  hospital  appointments  [37]. 
forms  of  support  encompass  consultations 
these 
regarding  disease  information,  management  of  medi-
cations,  post-hospital  discharge  self-care  at  home,  and 
provision  of  emotional  support 
[15].  Furthermore, 
interventions  offer  clients  the 
ai-powered  chatbot 
prospect  of  accessing  healthcare  services  in  geograph-
ically  isolated  or  remote  areas,  obtaining  support  ear-
lier  in  the  progression  of  a  disease,  and  curbing  the 
[38]. 
expenses  associated  with  physician  visits 
additionally,  health  professionals  stand  to  gain  from 
these 
interventions  as  they  enable  more  efficient 
access  to  patient  data,  ultimately  leading  to  time  sav-
ings  for  physicians.  this,  in  turn,  allows  them  to  allo-
cate  more  attention  to  critical  cases  demanding  urgent 
treatment.

the  utilization  of  ai-powered  chatbots  in  automat-
ing  healthcare  activities  and  promoting  consumer 
self-care  is  projected  to  grow  as  they  become  more 
capable  and  dependable  [21].  however,  these  gains 
necessitate  thorough  and  ongoing  examination.  the 
impact  of  automation  on  human  activities  has  serious 
safety consequences, with the hazards varying depend-
ing  on  the  extent  of  automation  and  the  individual

imperative  to  exercise  careful  monitoring  of  the  utiliza-
tion  of  ai-powered  chatbots  with  unrestricted  input 
capabilities  of  natural  language,  as  well  as  other  ai 
applications,  in  the  healthcare  domain  [40].  By  closely 
monitoring  these  advancements,  potential  safety  con-
cerns  can  be  addressed  and  mitigated  effectively.

Remarkably,  existing  research  on  ai-powered  chat-
bots  lacks  a  comprehensive  social-systems  analysis,  a 
gap  that  has  also  been  identified  in  previous  literature 
examining  ai  applications  [41].  currently,  there  is  a 
lack  of  agreement  on  the  approaches  utilized  to  eval-
uate  the  lasting  impacts  of  this  technology  on  human 
populations.  it  is  essential  to  acknowledge  the  poten-
tial  for  biased  design  in  these  applications,  as  they  can 
reinforce  stereotypes  or  have  disproportionate  effects 
on  already  marginalized  groups,  influenced  by  factors 
such as gender, race or socioeconomic status. therefore, 
it  is  vital  to  consistently  incorporate  a  consideration  of 
the  social  implications  of  ai-powered  chatbot  at  all 
stages,  from  their  inception  to  their  practical  imple-
mentation.  Neglecting  this  aspect  may  lead  to  adverse 
outcomes  for  the  health  and  well-being  of  certain 
populations.

Limitations

however,  it  is  crucial  to  acknowledge  some  limitations 
in the reviewed studies. First, while each study adhered 
to  a  Rct  design,  certain  studies  exhibited  a  notable 
degree  of  bias  risk,  potentially  influencing  the  internal 
validity  of  their  findings.  Furthermore,  the  diversity 
among  the  ai-powered  chatbot  interventions  exam-
ined  in  this  review  prevented  the  possibility  of  con-
ducting a meta-analysis. Moreover, the included studies 
lacked  comprehensive  technical  performance  details, 
which  impedes  the  replicability  and  comparability  of 
the  findings.

Implication  of  this  study  for  nursing  practice

the  integration  of  ai-powered  chatbots  holds  tremen-
dous  potential  in  augmenting  patient  care  and  out-
comes  across  a  spectrum  of  healthcare  domains. these 
interventions  have  demonstrated  notable  feasibility, 
acceptability  and  effectiveness  in  improving  diverse 
healthcare  metrics,  ranging  from  patient  safety  to 
mental  health.  the  accessibility  and  engagement 
offered  by  ai-powered  chatbots  can  significantly 
enhance  patient  adherence  and  participation  in  inter-
vention  protocols.  Moreover,  the  study  suggests  that 
these  interventions  can  yield  outcomes  on  par  with 
those  led  by  healthcare  professionals.  this  indicates  a

transformative  shift  in  the  way  nursing  care  can  be 
delivered,  potentially  allowing  nurses  to  allocate  their 
expertise  and  time  towards  more  critical  cases,  while 
ai-powered  chatbots  handle  routine  consultations  and 
information  dissemination.  however,  it  is  crucial  for 
nurses  to  approach  these  interventions  with  a  discern-
ing  eye,  recognizing  the  potential  limitations  high-
lighted  in  the  study,  such  as  the  need  for  ongoing 
monitoring  and  mitigation  of  safety  concerns.  in  navi-
gating  this  evolving  landscape,  nurses  have  a  pivotal 
role  in  championing  the  responsible  integration  of 
ai-powered  chatbots,  ensuring  they  complement  and 
enhance  the  quality  of  care  provided  to  patients.

Conclusions

reporting  positive  user 

the  evaluated  research  offered  valuable  insights  into 
the  effectiveness  and  usability  of  ai-powered  chatbots 
in  managing  diverse  chronic  conditions.  Generally,  users 
exhibited  promising  acceptance  of  ai-powered  chatbots 
for  self-management  of  chronic  illnesses,  with  all  of  the 
feedback 
included  studies 
regarding  perceived  helpfulness,  satisfaction  and  ease 
of  use.  to  address  this  knowledge  gap,  future  research 
should  strive  to  provide  comprehensive  and  explicit 
descriptions  of  the  technical  aspects  of  the  ai-powered 
chatbots  employed,  supported  by  the  development  of  a 
clear  and  comprehensive  taxonomy  specific  to  health-
care  ai-powered  chatbots.  Furthermore,  the  aspect  of 
safety  in  ai-powered  chatbots  has  been  largely  over-
looked  and  should  be  considered  as  a  fundamental 
consideration  in  the  design  process.
