Abstract: Vitamin D has a promising role in multiple sclerosis (MS) management, and it has been
found to be beneﬁcial for patients’ mental health, which is reduced in MS patients. The aim of
the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the inﬂuence of
vitamin D supplementation on mental health in MS patients. The systematic review was registered
in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779) and it was conducted on the basis of the PRISMA
guidelines. The search procedure was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science databases and it
included studies published up until September 2021. Six studies were included in the systematic
review. The risk of bias was analyzed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). Within the included
studies, there were two studies randomized against placebo and four other prospective studies. The
studies presented vitamin D interventions randomized against placebo or not randomized, while
supplementation was applied for various durations—from 4 weeks to 12 months, or the studies
compared patients who applied vitamin D supplementation and those who did not apply it and
veriﬁed the effect of the supplementation after a number of years. The mental health outcomes that
were assessed included quality of life, depression/depressive symptoms, and fatigue as an additional
element. The majority of studies supported the positive inﬂuence of vitamin D on the mental health
of MS patients, including the study characterized as having the highest quality (randomized against
placebo with the highest NOS score). All the studies that assessed the quality of life indicated the
positive inﬂuence of vitamin D while the studies that did not ﬁnd a positive inﬂuence of vitamin D
were conducted for depression/depressive symptoms. In spite of the fact that only a small number
of studies have been conducted so far, and only two studies were randomized against a placebo,
some conclusions may be formulated. The systematic review allowed us to conclude that there
may be a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation in MS patients, which was stated in all
of the studies analyzing quality of life, as well as in one study analyzing depressive symptoms.
Considering that vitamin D deﬁciency is common in MS patients, and the potential positive inﬂuence
of supplementation on the quality of life, supplementation should be applied at least in doses that
cover the recommended intake.

1. Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is deﬁned as an immune-mediated disease of the central
nervous system [1], which is characterized by chronic inﬂammation, demyelination, gliosis,
and neuronal loss, leading to physical or cognitive disability and neurological defects [2].

There are several subtypes of MS, while the most common is relapsing remitting MS (about
87% of MS patients are diagnosed with this subtype), which is characterized by alternating
periods of remission and unpredictable attacks [3].

The prevalence of MS is increasing in all regions of the world and in 2020 the number
of affected individuals was estimated as 2.8 million worldwide (with a global frequency
of 35.9 per 100,000 individuals) [4]. The typical symptoms of MS include weakness or
numbness in one or more limbs; optic neuritis, associated with painful monocular visual
loss; tremor and ataxic gait from cerebellar dysfunction; double vision, dysarthria, or
dizziness from brainstem dysfunction; and fatigue [5]. At the same time, MS is also
associated with other potential consequences, for example, a systematic review and meta-
analysis by Hong et al. [6] indicated the increased risk of developing any type of stroke,
and especially, the increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. Taking this into account,
MS is associated with severe disabilities resulting in a reduction in life expectancy of
7–14 years [7].

However, not only physical consequences are observed; the systematic review by
Neuhaus et al. [8] proved that among other cognitive measures, the decision-making
abilities of MS patients may be impaired, which may inﬂuence their everyday life. The
prevalence of depression in MS is also higher than for the general population, by even
up to 60% depending on the group studied. [9]. Similarly, the quality of life in MS pa-
tients is reduced when compared with the general population [10]. The systematic review
by Gil-González et al. [11] revealed that MS is associated mainly with disability, fatigue,
depression, cognitive impairment and unemployment. Such a situation causes an in-
creased risk of suicide in MS, and its frequency is twice as high as that for the general
population [12,13].

Taking into consideration the course of MS, it is emphasized that adequate manage-
ment of the disease should include not only palliative care, but also a dedicated approach
to improve life expectancy and quality of life [14]. A dietary approach is among various
possible actions that are indicated, as some dietary modiﬁcations may inﬂuence the course
of the disease and resultant quality of life. Various dietary factors, including vitamin D,
have been linked with MS incidence and course, thus they are indicated as a potentially
inﬂuencing factors [15].

Low blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are associated with increased
risk of MS [16] and in the early disease course it is a strong risk factor for long-term
MS activity and progression [17]. As vitamin D receptors are present in almost every
immune cell, while the active form of vitamin D is crucial for lymphocyte regulation
and cells proliferation, vitamin D has been linked with a predisposition to autoimmune
diseases [18]. Furthermore, numerous environmental factors linked to MS incidence may
also alter vitamin D levels. The susceptibility to these environmental risk factors may be
modulated by genetic variation and epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation,
histone modiﬁcation, and ncRNA [19].

The systematic review and meta-analysis by Martínez-Lapiscina et al. [20] indicated
that serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with a modest decrease in the relapse rate and
radiological inﬂammatory activities in patients with MS. However, a systematic review
and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by Doosti-Irani et al. [21] indicated that
vitamin D supplementation in MS had no signiﬁcant effect on the expanded disability
status scale (EDSS) and the meta-analysis by Zheng et al. [22] indicated that it had no
signiﬁcant effect on EDSS, or on annual relapse rate. Based on the gathered evidence,
it was concluded in a comprehensive review by Sintzel et al. [23], that the impact of
vitamin D supplementation on MS activity remains inadequately investigated. Moreover,
there is a knowledge gap in regard to chronic and high-dose therapy, which can lead to
life-threatening complications related to vitamin D toxicity in this group [24].

It has been suggested that vitamin D plays a role not only in the physical health,
but also the mental health of healthy individuals. It has been indicated for reducing the
risk of depression, as concluded by the meta-analyses of Vellekkatt and Menon [25], Shaf-

fer et al. [26], and Spedding [27], as well as for reducing negative emotions, as concluded
in the meta-analysis of Cheng et al. [28]. Taking into account the promising role of vitamin
D in MS management, as well as the mental health problems of MS patients, the aim of the
present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the inﬂuence of
vitamin D supplementation on mental health in MS patients.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. The Systematic Review Registration and Design

The systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42020155779). Systematic reviews to assess the
inﬂuence of vitamin D on mental health in children [29], as well as in adults with dia-
betes [30] and in adults with inﬂammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome
were conducted [31] within the project.

The systematic review was conducted on the basis of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [32]. The search procedure
was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science databases and it included all studies
published in English, as full-texts in peer-reviewed journals. The search was conducted
in the following stages: (1) a search within studies published up until October 2019 (as
described in the previous study [29]), and (2) a search within studies published from
October 2019 to September 2021 (as described in the previous studies [30,31]).

2.2. Criteria for Including Studies in a Systematic Review

The search was conducted in order to select studies analyzing the inﬂuence of any
vitamin D supplementation on any mental health outcome in adult MS patients. The
subtype and course of MS, as well as the country or population, were not deﬁned in order
to include all the studies assessing the studied inﬂuence.

The inclusion criteria were formulated as follows:

(1) Population of adults;
(2) Conﬁrmed diagnosis of MS;
(3) Any vitamin D supplementation applied;
(4) Any mental

outcome

health

assessed

(including

subjective

and/or

objective measures).

The exclusion criteria were formulated as follows:

Studies in animal models;

(1)
(2) Conﬁrmed concurrent diagnosis of any intellectual disabilities;
(3) Conﬁrmed concurrent diagnosis of any eating disorders;
(4) Conﬁrmed concurrent diagnosis of any other neurological disorders, changing dietary

behaviors (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy);

(5) Vitamin D applied within multiple nutrients supplementation.

The summary of the patient, intervention/exposure, comparator, outcome, and study
design (PICOS) criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies to a systematic review are
presented in Table 1.

2.3. The Search and Inclusion Procedure

The electronic search strategy applied for the systematic review of PubMed and Web

of Science databases is presented in the Supplementary Materials, Table S1.

The search procedure was followed by removing duplicated records and identifying
potentially eligible studies, which was based on the established inclusion criteria and
exclusion criteria. The identiﬁcation of potentially eligible studies was conducted in
3 phases, which were based on title screening, abstract screening and full texts screening.
Titles and abstracts were based on PubMed and Web of Science databases, and if studies
were deﬁned as potentially eligible, the full texts were obtained. If full texts were not
available, the corresponding authors were contacted to obtain them. The assessment of

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4207

titles, abstracts and full texts was conducted independently by 2 researchers and in case of
any disagreement, the third researcher participated.

The process of identiﬁcation, screening, eligibility assessment and the inclusion of

studies in the systematic review is presented in Figure 1.

2.4. Data Extraction and Studies Assessment Procedure

The included studies were used to obtain the data necessary to describe the ob-
served inﬂuence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health outcomes. The extracted
data included:

(1) The general presentation of the studies included and of the populations assessed
within (authors and year; study design; country/location; population assessed; time);
(2) The description of the studied group (number of participants; number of female

participants; age; inclusion criteria; exclusion criteria);

(3) The description of the vitamin D supplementation/intervention (vitamin D measure
and dosage regimen) and of the mental health outcome (assessed outcome and
psychological measure);

(4) The observations and conclusions.

The data were obtained from the published version of the manuscript, but if such
information was not presented, the corresponding authors were contacted to obtain them
(such data are within the study presented as provided on request). The data extraction
was conducted independently by 2 researchers and in case of any disagreement, the third
researcher participated.

The quality of the included studies was assessed while using the Newcastle–Ottawa
Scale (NOS) dedicated to non-randomized studies [33]. The included studies were assessed
within the criteria for selection (scored from 0 to 4), comparability (scored from 0 to 2) and
exposure/outcome (scored from 0 to 3). The ﬁnal score was attributed to a speciﬁc category
of very high risk of bias (total scored from 0 to 3), high risk of bias (total scored from 4 to 6)
and low risk of bias (total scored from 7 to 9), as it is commonly applied [34].

3. Results

The design and basic details of the studies of MS patients included in the systematic
review [35–40] are presented in Table 2. Of the included studies, there were two studies
randomized against placebo [35,36] and four other prospective studies [37–40]. They were
conducted in international cohorts [39,40], as well as speciﬁc countries—Iran [35], The
Netherlands [36], and Saudi Arabia [37]. There were studies conducted in populations
of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis [35–37], and studies conducted in
populations of patients with an undeﬁned subtype of MS [38–40].

The characteristics of the MS patients assessed within the studies included in the
systematic review are presented in Table 3. The included studies presented observations
formulated in samples of various sizes—small samples of less than 50 participants [36,37],
medium size sample of about 100 participants [35,38], or a large international sample [39,40].
The majority of studies were conducted in participants of about 30–40 years [35–38],

Data Extraction and Studies Assessment Procedure The included studies were used to obtain the data necessary to describe the observed influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health outcomes. The extracted data included: (1) The general presentation of the studies included and of the populations assessed within (authors and year; study design; country/location; population assessed; time); (2) The description of the studied group (number of participants; number of female par-ticipants; age; inclusion criteria; exclusion criteria); (3) The description of the vitamin D supplementation/intervention (vitamin D measure and dosage regimen) and of the mental health outcome (assessed outcome and psy-chological measure); (4) The observations and conclusions. The data were obtained from the published version of the manuscript, but if such information was not presented, the corresponding authors were contacted to obtain them (such data are within the study presented as provided on request). The data extraction was conducted independently by 2 researchers and in case of any disagreement, the third researcher participated. The quality of the included studies was assessed while using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) dedicated to non-randomized studies [33]. The included studies were as-sessed within the criteria for selection (scored from 0 to 4), comparability (scored from 0 to 2) and exposure/outcome (scored from 0 to 3). The final score was attributed to a specific category of very high risk of bias (total scored from 0 to 3), high risk of bias (total scored from 4 to 6) and low risk of bias (total scored from 7 to 9), as it is commonly applied [34].   Nutrients 2021, 13, 4207

but the largest international study included older participants of age almost 50 years
old [39,40]. The majority of studies included patients with MS diagnosed based on Mc-
Donald criteria [35–38], sometimes accompanied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
results [36,37], but the largest international study was based on the self-reported informa-
tion about MS diagnosis [39,40].

The description of the vitamin D exposures applied within the studies and mental
health outcomes assessed within the studies of MS patients included in the systematic
review is presented in Table 4. The majority of studies presented deﬁned vitamin D
intervention in a population randomized against placebo [35,36] or not randomized [37,38],
which were applied for various durations—from 4 weeks [36] to 12 months [37]. However,
the largest international study [39,40] did not present a planned intervention, but compared
patients declaring they applied vitamin D supplementation and those who did not declare
it, and it veriﬁed the effect of the supplementation after 2.5 years. The mental health
outcomes that were assessed, included quality of life [35,38,40], and depression/depressive
symptoms [36,37,39], but also fatigue as an additional element [36,38].

The observations and conclusion formulated within the studies of MS patients in-
cluded in the systematic review are presented in Table 5. All the included studies indicated
some positive association between vitamin D supplementation and the mental health of
MS patients, but in some studies, they were observed only in some of the analysis or only
for some aspects of mental health. Even if the authors of the study concluded there was
no evidence for a reduction in depressive symptoms upon vitamin D supplementation,
it should be noted that within the study they observed a signiﬁcant decrease in Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale (HADS-D) scores in a group receiving
vitamin D supplements, but only a trend towards a decrease within a placebo group [36].
Similarly, in a study that indicated no association between vitamin D supplementation and
depression risk, such a situation was observed after adjusting for potential confounders,
but the authors observed an existing association before the adjustment [39].

A summary of the conclusions from the studies of MS patients included in the system-
atic review accompanied by the assessment of the quality of studies based on the design of
the studies and the NOS score is presented in Table 6. The majority of studies supported the
positive inﬂuence of vitamin D on the mental health of MS patients [35,37,38,40], including
the study characterized as having highest quality (study randomized against placebo with
the highest NOS score) [35]. However, among two studies that did not support the positive
inﬂuence of vitamin D [36,39], one study was also randomized against placebo [36]. All the
studies assessing the quality of life indicated the positive inﬂuence of vitamin D [35,38,40],
while the studies that did not ﬁnd a positive inﬂuence of vitamin D were conducted for
depression/depressive symptoms [36,39].

(median HADS-D 4.0 to 3.0, p = 0.02), a trend towards a decrease within
the placebo group (median HADS-D 3.0 to 2.0, p = 0.06), but no
signiﬁcantly different reductions between groups (p = 0.78).

Depressive symptoms were high at baseline and improved with
vitamin D replacement although, Expanded Disability Status Scale
(EDSS) score was not improving. Vitamin D levels correlated negatively
with depressive symptoms at baseline and follow up periods.

After vitamin D supplementation, health-related quality of life and
fatigue scores improved signiﬁcantly. There was a direct association
between health-related quality of life with absence of fatigue and
vitamin D status at the end of study.

There was no evidence for a reduction of
depressive symptoms upon vitamin D3
supplementation in relapsing remitting multiple
sclerosis patients.

Lower vitamin D levels are associated with
higher depressive scores, and vitamin D
replacement could improve depressive
symptoms in patients with relapsing remitting
multiple sclerosis.

The 90% frequency of multiple sclerosis patients
with vitamin D deﬁciency, together with the
signiﬁcant association of vitamin D status with
the absence of fatigue and improved physical
and functional well-being, points to vitamin D
supplementation as a potential therapy to
enhance the patient’s quality of life.

Vitamin D supplementation at baseline was associated with lower
frequency of positive depression-screen 2.5 years later. After adjusting
for potential confounders, vitamin D supplementation was not
associated with a change in risk for depression.

Vitamin D supplementation was associated with
lower frequencies of depression risk, but this
association was no longer signiﬁcant after
adjusting for potential confounders.

At 2.5-year follow-up, quality of life scores were higher among
participants reporting taking vitamin D supplements (physical: aβ =
3.58, 95% CI = 1.35–5.80; mental: aβ = 3.08, 95% CI = 0.72–5.44),
particularly average daily dose over 125 µg/d. Baseline-reported
vitamin D supplementation was associated with greater increase in
physical (aβ = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.22–1.81), but not mental quality of life
(aβ = 0.11, 95% CI = −1.00–1.23).

CI—conﬁdence interval.

Self-reported vitamin D supplement use was
cross-sectionally associated with higher physical
and mental quality of life, but prospectively only
with increased physical quality of life.

4. Discussion

In spite of the fact that only a small number of studies have assessed the effect of vita-
min D supplementation on mental health in MS patients, those that were gathered indicate
the potential positive inﬂuence of such supplementation. In particular, the results of the
prospective intervention-based studies should be taken into account [35–40], including the
results of the studies randomized against placebo [35,36]. Moreover, it should be noted that
the studies based on the self-reported vitamin D supplementation, not being applied within
an intervention study [39,40], were elaborated based on the results of the same Health
Outcomes and Lifestyle In a Sample of people with Multiple Sclerosis (HOLISM) Study
and the sample size was identical in two studies, thus it may be supposed that the studies
present the same group that were analyzed separately for the inﬂuence on depression [39]
and quality of life [40]. Taking this into account, it may be suggested that in this studied
group, the beneﬁcial effect of the applied supplementation was conﬁrmed for the quality of
life [40], but was not conﬁrmed for depression [39]. As a result, it cannot be stated that two
studies did not conﬁrm any positive effect of vitamin D supplementation for the mental
health of MS patients, but only one [36], as the other study, namely, the HOLISM Study,
conﬁrmed this effect but only for one assessed mental health outcome—quality of life [40].
The gathered observations indicated that quality of life was a mental health out-
come inﬂuenced by vitamin D supplementation in MS patients in all the presented
studies [35,38,40]. Quality of life is deﬁned by the World Health Organization (WHO)
as individuals’ perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value
systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and
concerns. This deﬁnition includes not only physical health, or level of independence
(both important for MS patients), but also psychological state, social relationships, and
personal beliefs [41]. While clinicians focus mainly on the physical aspects of quality of
life, MS patients emphasize the role of the mental health aspects of the quality of life [42],
and consider that vitality, pain, as well as general, emotional, and mental health are also
relevant [43], which conﬁrms the role of quality of life within general mental health. In MS
patients the quality of life is signiﬁcantly decreased compared to healthy individuals [44]
and this is indicated within the factors associated with the disease progression [45]. Taking
this into account, the possibility of improving the quality of life of MS patients by applying
vitamin D supplementation is of a great value.

Additionally, for depressive symptoms [37], one study in this systematic review
indicated a beneﬁcial inﬂuence, so depressive symptoms may also be potentially inﬂuenced
by vitamin D supplementation. However, the inﬂuence of vitamin D supplementation
was not studied for other mental health outcomes that are also inﬂuenced by MS, such as
well-being [46], sleep quality [47], life satisfaction [48], self-efﬁcacy and self-esteem [49],
optimism [50], stress [51], mood disorders [52], anxiety [53], psychiatric syndromes [54],
and suicidal ideation [55].

Vitamin D is indicated as a factor associated with MS incidence [16] and progres-
sion [17,20], but it is emphasized that high doses of vitamin D generate a risk of toxicity
in this group [24]. However, it should be also noted that vitamin D deﬁciency in the
general population is a global public health problem in all age groups [56], and due to the
frequency of this deﬁciency and its role in the treatment of many diseases, it is indicated as
an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases [57]. Additionally,
in case of MS, patients generally have a low vitamin D dietary intake [58], and as a result, a
low 25(OH)D blood level [59,60]. Taking this into account, in case of documented vitamin
D deﬁciency, its supplementation is recommended to replenish vitamin D stores [61], thus
it should be applied to MS patients with documented vitamin D deﬁciency. However,
based on the risk of its toxicity [24], the doses should ﬁrstly meet the general dietary
intake recommendations [62]. The second-line target should be based on the potential
beneﬁts of increased vitamin D supply, in association with the course of MS [17,20], but
also, as indicated in the presented systematic review, in association with the patient’s
mental health [35,37,38,40]. However, this area needs more studies that are randomized

Nutrients 2021, 13, 4207

against placebo. Based on the conducted systematic review of the inﬂuence of vitamin D
supplementation on the mental health of MS patients, supplementation should be applied
at least in doses that cover the recommended intake and further research is needed to
deﬁne the level required to obtain additional beneﬁts. However, to deepen our knowledge,
not only the association between vitamin D supplementation and mental health should
be studied, but also the potential further consequences associated with MS symptoms
or course.

5. Conclusions

This systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess the inﬂuence of
vitamin D supplementation on mental health in MS patients. Based on this review, we
concluded that there may be a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation. Such a positive
effect was found in all the studies analyzing quality of life, as well as in one study that
analyzed depressive symptoms. Taking into consideration that vitamin D deﬁciency is
common in MS patients, and the potential positive inﬂuence of supplementation on the
quality of life in this group, supplementation should be applied at least in a dose that
covers the recommended intake.
