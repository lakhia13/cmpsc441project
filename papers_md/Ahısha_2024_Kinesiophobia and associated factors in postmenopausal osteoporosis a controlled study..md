Kinesiophobia and associated factors in postmenopausal 
osteoporosis: a controlled study

Büşra Şirin Ahısha1*

SUMMARY
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate kinesiophobia levels in patients with osteoporosis compared to healthy controls and investigate the 
associations with pain, depression, anxiety, fear of falling, and quality of life.
METHODS: The study involved 60 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and 60 healthy controls aged 50 years and above. Kinesiophobia was 
assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, while quality of life, psychological symptoms, and fear of falling were evaluated using the Quality 
of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale.
RESULTS: Kinesiophobia levels were significantly higher in the osteoporosis group compared to controls (p<0.05). Positive correlations were observed 
between kinesiophobia and Falls Efficacy Scale (r=0.278, p=0.002), as well as with Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for 
Osteoporosis physical function scores (r=0.185, p=0.043). No significant relationship was found between kinesiophobia and depression or anxiety scores.
CONCLUSION: Kinesiophobia is notably higher in osteoporosis patients compared to healthy individuals, correlating with an increased fear of falling 
and reduced physical function. Early identification and management of kinesiophobia are essential to prevent reduced physical activity and associated 
risks, such as decreased bone mineral density and higher fracture risk.
KEYWORDS: Osteoporosis. Kinesiophobia. Quality of life. Depression. Anxiety.

INTRODUCTION
Osteoporosis is a systemic metabolic disorder that leads to 
decreased bone mineral density and a higher risk of frac-
tures, especially in older adults and women. Fragility fractures 
often occur in the vertebrae, hip, and distal radius, resulting 
in increased morbidity, mortality, and a significant economic 
burden on healthcare systems1. Low physical activity contrib-
utes to decreased bone mineral density and higher fracture 
risk from falls. Physical activity helps maintain bone mass and 
stimulates bone development, highlighting its importance in 
osteoporosis treatment and prevention2.

In patients diagnosed with osteoporosis, irrational fear 
of movement and physical activity, known as kinesiopho-
bia, and avoidance behaviors can develop due to the thought 
that their bones are weak and prone to fractures. This situa-
tion leads to restrictions in physical activity and, in a vicious 
cycle, results in decreased bone density and consequently 
an increased risk of fractures3. Kinesiophobia is a condition 
encountered in many groups within the field of rehabilita-
tion, including those with fibromyalgia4, chronic low back 
pain5, older individuals6, and systemic lupus erythematosus7. 
Kinesiophobia limits daily activities, impairs pain manage-
ment, hampers rehabilitation, and delays return to sports 

and work. This leads to reduced physical performance, car-
diac issues from insufficient activity, muscle loss, emotional 
problems, and worsened quality of life6. In the literature, 
fear of falling has been more extensively studied in patients 
with osteoporosis, with a limited number of studies evaluat-
ing kinesiophobia. The aim of this study is to fill this gap in 
the literature by investigating the presence of kinesiophobia 
in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and comparing the 
level of kinesiophobia with healthy controls. Additionally, the 
relationship between the level of kinesiophobia and symp-
toms of anxiety and depression, fear of falling, and quality 
of life has been evaluated.

METHODS
Our clinical cross-sectional study included 60 postmeno-
pausal women with osteoporosis and 60 healthy postmeno-
pausal women, recruited from Beylikdüzü State  Hospital’s 
Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation clinics between January 
21, 2024, and February 21, 2024. The study was approved by 
the Istanbul Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation  Training 
and Research Hospital Ethics Committee (protocol number 
2023-03) and obtained informed consent from all participants.

Bone mineral density was measured using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry, classifying osteoporosis as lumbar L1–L4 
and femoral neck T-scores of ≤-2.5, osteopenia as -1 to -2.5, 
and normal as >-18.

Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of postmenopausal oste-
oporosis for at least six months, exclusion of secondary causes, 
and age 50 years or older. Exclusion criteria included other 
conditions causing kinesiophobia, cognitive or communication 
issues, acute pain, history of falls and fractures, and conditions 
affecting balance or function.

At the beginning of the study, sociodemographic data, comor-
bidities, smoking habits, and sports activities were recorded. 
To assess the presence and level of kinesiophobia, the Turkish 
version of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)9 was used. 
Quality of life was assessed using the Turkish version of the 
Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation 
for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41)10. Depression and anxiety 
were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS)11, and fear of falling was evaluated using the Tinetti 
Falls Efficacy Scale (TFES)12.

The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia
The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) was developed by 
Miller et al.13. The Turkish version of this scale, which was val-
idated and found reliable in 2011, consists of 17 items that 
inquire about thoughts related to injury and physical activity. 
Each item is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly 
agree). Items 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reverse-scored. Total scores 
range from 17 to 68, with higher scores indicating higher lev-
els of kinesiophobia9.

Quality of Life Questionnaire of the  
European Foundation for Osteoporosis
The Turkish version of this scale, translated by Koçyigit et al.10, 
consists of four categories: pain, physical function, general 
health, and mental health. Separate scores for each category and 
a total score are calculated. The scores range from 0 to 100, with 
higher scores indicating poorer quality of life in that domain10.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
The Turkish version of the HADS was validated and found 
reliable by Aydemir et al.11. This scale consists of a total of 14 
items, with 7 items assessing anxiety symptoms and 7 items 
assessing depression symptoms. Each item is scored between 
0 and 3. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety and 
depression. The cutoff value is defined as 7 for the depression 
subscale and 10 for the anxiety subscale11.

Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale
The Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale (TFES), developed by Tinetti 
et al.12, was translated into Turkish by Erdem and Emel14. 
This scale consists of 10 items, each assessing the level of confi-
dence in performing daily activities. Each item is scored between 
1 (very confident) and 10 (not confident at all). The total score 
is the sum of these item scores, with higher scores indicating 
a greater fear of falling.

Sample size calculation
Sample size calculation, based on Gunendi et al.’s3 study, used 
TSK scores with means of 39±6.3 for healthy individuals and 
43±8.6 for osteoporosis patients, resulting in an effect size of 
0.53. With an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 56 partici-
pants per group were needed. Our study included 60 partic-
ipants per group, with calculations done using the G*Power 
software version 3.1.9.4.

Statistical analysis
Data normality was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test. Quantitative data are presented as mean and standard 
deviation, while qualitative data are presented as frequencies 
and percentages. For normally distributed data, independent 
sample t-tests will be used; otherwise, Mann-Whitney U tests 
will be used. The chi-square test will assess qualitative data. 
A p<0.05 is considered significant. Pearson and Spearman 
correlation tests will be used for normally and non-normally 
distributed data, respectively.

RESULTS
Table 1 presents the study’s descriptive data. The mean age was 
61.08±7.20 years in the osteoporosis group and 58.72±6.96 years 
in the control group, with no significant age difference (p>0.05). 
BMI was higher in the control group. Both groups were similar 
in education, occupation, marital status, smoking habits, and 
pain characteristics. Hypothyroidism and diabetes were more 
common in the control group, but there were no significant dif-
ferences in hypertension and coronary artery disease (Table 1).
In the osteoporosis group, TSK scores were significantly 
higher compared to the control group (p<0.05). However, no 
significant differences were found between the two groups 
in terms of QUALEFFO-41 pain, physical function, general 
health, mental health, and total scores (p>0.05). HADS depres-
sion and anxiety scores, as well as TFES scores, were similar 
between the two groups (Table 2).

There were no significant relationships between the TSK 
scores and age, BMI, femoral neck bone mineral density, lumbar

general health, mental health, and total scores. However, the 
level of kinesiophobia was positively correlated with TFES 
scores (r=0.278, p=0.002) and QUALEFFO-41 physical func-
tion scores (r=0.185, p=0.043). No significant relationship was 
found between TSK scores and HADS anxiety and depression 
scores (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
In this study, the level of kinesiophobia was found to be sig-
nificantly higher in patients with osteoporosis compared to the 
control group. It was also observed that patients with higher lev-
els of kinesiophobia had a greater fear of falling. Additionally, a 
positive correlation was found between kinesiophobia scores 
and QUALEFFO-41 physical function subscale scores.

Mısırcı et al.15 found similar kinesiophobia levels in oste-
oporotic and osteopenic groups, both higher than the control 
group, and reported positive correlations with quality of life, 
fear of falling, depression, and anxiety. Similarly, another study3 
observed higher kinesiophobia in osteoporotic patients versus 
controls. Our study supports these findings, showing higher 
kinesiophobia in the osteoporosis group. Excluding participants

with painful musculoskeletal disorders suggests that kinesio-
phobia can arise independently of pain, aligning with the lit-
erature that links it directly to osteoporosis3,15.

In the literature, studies have found correlations between 
kinesiophobia levels and age and BMI in knee osteoarthritis 
and chronic low back pain16,17. Turgay et al.18 reported no sig-
nificant relationship between kinesiophobia and BMI in post-
menopausal osteoporotic patients but did find a positive cor-
relation between age and kinesiophobia. Mısırcı et al.15 found 
correlations between kinesiophobia and age and BMI only in 
the osteopenic group. However, our study found no associa-
tion between kinesiophobia and age or BMI.

In our study, fear of falling was similar between the osteo-
porosis and control groups, although kinesiophobia levels were 
positively correlated with fear of falling. Contrary to our results, 
other studies found higher fear of falling in the osteoporosis 
group19,20. Mısırcı et al.15 reported significantly higher fear of 
falling in both osteoporotic and osteopenic groups compared 
to controls, with no significant difference between the two 
groups. They also found a positive correlation between kinesi-
ophobia and fear of falling. Similarly, a study on rheumatoid 
arthritis patients showed a significant relationship between 
kinesiophobia and fear of falling, aligning with our results21.

In our study, the osteoporosis and control groups were 
found to be similar in terms of depression and anxiety symp-
toms. Similarly, the study by Gunendi et al.3 reported no signif-
icant differences in depression and anxiety symptoms between 
the osteoporosis and control groups, consistent with our find-
ings. However, Kashfi et al.22 found significantly higher depres-
sion scores in the osteoporotic group compared to the control 
group. Additionally, a study involving 11,603 adults reported 
that individuals with osteoporosis exhibited 1.73 times more 
depressive symptoms compared to those without osteoporosis23. 
Other studies in the literature have also reported higher levels of 
depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with osteoporosis15.
Our study found no significant relationship between kine-
siophobia and depression or anxiety scores. This contrasts with 
Mısırcı et al.15, who reported higher depression and anxiety in 
patients with high kinesiophobia. Similar correlations have 
been observed in conditions like ischemic stroke24 and sys-
temic lupus erythematosus7. A study of elderly nursing home 
residents also found a positive correlation between kinesiopho-
bia and anxiety and depression symptoms25. However, a study 
on fibromyalgia patients did not find an association between 
kinesiophobia and depression4.

In Altuğ et al.’s study5, kinesiophobia scores were negatively 
correlated with physical function subscale scores of quality of life 
in chronic low back pain, similar to our findings. However, we 

4

Rev Assoc Med Bras. 2024;70(12):e20241042Kinesiophobia in postmenopausal osteoporosisdid not find significant relationships with pain, general health, 
or mental health parameters. Gunendi et al.3 reported that 
higher kinesiophobia levels were associated with a decline in 
quality of life in osteoporosis patients. Conversely, another 
study15 found a positive correlation between kinesiophobia 
and total QUALEFFO-41 scores, without analyzing sub-
scales separately. Turgay et al.18 observed a positive correla-
tion between kinesiophobia and both total QUALEFFO-41 
scores and all subscales.

One of the limitations of our study is its single-center 
cross-sectional design. Although the sample size was calculated 
at the beginning of the study, there is a need for studies with 
larger sample sizes. Additionally, the use of the TSK, which 
is not specific to osteoporosis, also constitutes a limitation. 
However, a strong aspect of our study is the relatively small 

number of studies comparing kinesiophobia in osteoporosis 
patients with depression, anxiety, fear of falling, and quality 
of life in a control group.

In conclusion, our research highlights that kinesiophobia 
levels are higher in the osteoporotic patient group compared 
to healthy controls. As restricted physical activity can lead to 
decreased bone mineral density and an increased risk of frac-
tures, early identification of kinesiophobia and implementing 
measures to ensure patients remain active is crucial for the 
treatment and rehabilitation process.
