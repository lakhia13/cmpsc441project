Abstract 
Background  Cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder (CT-SAD) has extensive empirical support and is recom-
mended in several national guidelines. However, ensuring access to evidence-based psychological therapies such 
as CT-SAD remains a global challenge. An internet-delivered version of this treatment protocol (iCT-SAD) has recently 
been developed in the UK as a way to overcome this challenge, demonstrating comparable outcomes to face-to-
face CT-SAD whilst requiring less therapist time per client. Initial findings also suggest its cross-cultural transferability, 
but the previous studies in other cultural settings used the English language programme and only included English-
fluent participants as a second language. It is not yet known what outcomes can be achieved once the programme 
has been translated and adapted for a different cultural context. Therefore, this trial aims to evaluate the clinical 
efficacy of Japanese iCT-SAD when combined with treatment as usual (TAU) in clients with SAD.

Methods  This two-arm, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial will recruit 60 Japanese participants 
with SAD, randomly assigning them to either Japanese iCT-SAD + TAU or TAU alone at a ratio of 1:1. The primary 
outcome measure is the self-report Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and secondary.outcomes include other meas-
ures of social anxiety symptoms and processes, general mood and functioning, and response to treatment. We will 
also assess treatment acceptability and gather participant feedback. Assessments will take place at baseline (week 
0), mid-treatment (week 8), and post-treatment (week 15), with a further 3-month follow-up (week 27) for the iCT-
SAD + TAU arm. The primary analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat basis, comparing the primary and sec-
ondary outcome measures between groups using linear mixed-effect models, along with additional mediation 
analysis.

Discussion  Investigating the efficacy of translated and culturally adapted iCT-SAD in different cultural contexts 
is an important step in evaluating the global reach of internet interventions. This trial will provide valuable insights 
into the effects of iCT-SAD combined with usual care, and how this treatment could be delivered in routine clinical 
settings in Japan.

Introduction
Background and rationale {6a}

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and chronic 
mental  health  problem,  which  typically  has  an  early  age 
of onset, leading to a substantial negative impact on indi-
viduals’  quality  of  life  [1].  Individual  face-to-face  cogni-
tive  therapy  for  SAD  (CT-SAD)  based  on  the  Clark  and 
Wells model [2] has extensive empirical support [3] and 
as a result is recommended in national guidelines in both 
the  UK  [4]  and  Japan  [5].  Although  there  is  evidence  to 
suggest  that  people  with  mental  health  problems  pre-
fer  psychological  over  pharmacological  treatments  [6], 
ensuring  access  to  evidence-based  psychological  thera-
pies such as CT-SAD remains a global challenge [7].

In  the  UK,  an  internet-delivered  version  of  this  treat-
ment  protocol  (iCT-SAD)  was  developed  to  support 
wider access and dissemination [8, 9]. In order to increase 
the  number  of  people  receiving  empirically  supported 
psychotherapies,  the  National  Institute  for  Health  and 
Care Excellence (NICE) has conditionally recommended 
iCT-SAD for use in the national health service [10]. iCT-
SAD  is  a  therapist-guided  internet  intervention,  which 
uses  a  modular  structure  to  deliver  the  same  treatment 
components as face-to-face CT-SAD. A randomised con-
trolled  trial  in  the  UK  found  it  to  show  strong  efficacy, 
with  outcomes  comparable  to  face-to-face  CT-SAD,  but 
requiring much less therapist time per client [8]. Results 
of  a  pilot  trial  and  randomised  controlled  trial  in  Hong 
Kong  showed  outcomes  comparable  to  the  UK  trial, 
which  suggests  that  it  is  possible  to  transport  iCT-SAD 
between  cultures  without  a  substantial  drop  in  efficacy 
[11, 12].

As  the  Hong  Kong  trials  used  the  English  version  of 
iCT-SAD  and  included  only  English-speaking  partici-
pants, it is not yet known what outcomes can be achieved 
once  the  programme  has  been  translated  and  adapted 
for a different cultural context such as Japan. Initial evi-
dence has suggested that the translation from English to 

Yoshinaga et al. Trials          (2024) 25:492 

Page 3 of 12

Japanese  has  been  achieved  successfully,  incorporating 
a  number  of  small  cultural  adaptations  where  appropri-
ate  [13].  A  subsequent  single-arm  pilot  trial  indicated 
that Japanese iCT-SAD showed good acceptability to cli-
ents and preliminary evidence of strong efficacy in Japa-
nese clinical settings [14]. A randomised controlled trial 
is  now  warranted  to  evaluate  Japanese  iCT-SAD  more 
robustly. The primary aim of this trial is to  examine the 
clinical  efficacy  of  the  translated  and  culturally  adapted 
Japanese  iCT-SAD  when  combined  with  treatment  as 
usual  in  Japanese  individuals  with  SAD  through  a  ran-
domised controlled design.

Objectives {7}
The  primary  objective  of  the  current  trial  is  to  examine 
whether  a  Japanese  version  of  iCT-SAD  in  combination 
with treatment as usual (iCT-SAD + TAU) is superior to 
TAU alone.

The secondary objectives are as follows:

and  post-treatment  feedback  from  participants  will  be 
collected online.

Eligibility criteria {10}

The inclusion criteria for participants are as follows:

•  Primary diagnosis of SAD based on the Diagnostic and 
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Edition 
(DSM-5)

•  Aged 18 years or over
•  Regular, private access to an appropriate internet ena-

ble device

•  Resident  in  Japan  and  proficient  in  Japanese  (written 

and spoken)

•  Able to visit their primary psychiatrist regularly during 
the trial (at least monthly in person) for safety monitor-
ing

•  Participant not currently undertaking other structured 
psychological  therapy  and  agrees  not  to  start  such 
interventions during the trial

•  To  examine  whether  the  Japanese  iCT-SAD  pro-

gramme is acceptable to clients

The exclusion criteria for participants are as follows:

•  To  evaluate  how 

the  outcomes  of 

iCT-
SAD + TAU  intervention  compare  to  previous  stud-
ies of the iCT-SAD programme in the UK and Hong 
Kong

the 

•  An exploratory examination of whether baseline clin-
ical  and  demographic  characteristics  are  associated 
with clinical outcomes in the iCT-SAD + TAU arm
•  An  exploratory  examination  of  candidate  mediators 
of the relationship between treatment arm and clini-
cal outcome

Trial design {8}
This  trial  employs  a  two-arm,  parallel-group,  superior-
ity  randomised  controlled  design,  comparing  Japanese 
iCT-SAD  in  combination  with  treatment  as  usual  (iCT-
SAD + TAU) to TAU alone. Participants will be allocated 
using a 1:1 ratio. Participants will not be blinded to treat-
ment allocation.

Methods: participants, interventions and outcomes
Study setting {9}

Participants will be recruited from outpatient sites at dif-
ferent  psychiatric  hospitals  and  clinics  across  Japan  via 
referral  from  their  primary  psychiatrist.  All  screening 
and assessments will be conducted remotely or in person, 
and iCT-SAD will be provided on a dedicated online plat-
form.  TAU  from  their  primary  psychiatrist  will  be  pro-
vided in person. Questionnaires for measuring outcomes 

•  Current psychosis, bipolar disorder, antisocial person-
ality disorder, or alcohol/substance use disorder (mod-
erate  or  severe);  this  comorbidity  is  likely  to  interfere 
with  the  client’s  ability  to  use  the  treatment  website 
regularly and to process and apply the treatment con-
tent

•  Active suicidal ideation with intent or plan; this would 
indicate that immediate support is required to ensure 
the client’s safety and that allocation to the intervention 
or control arm would not be sufficient at that time
•  Previously  received  CT  or  cognitive  behavioural 
therapy  for  SAD  (defined  as  at  least  five  sessions  and 
including an exposure component); this may confound 
the  study’s  outcomes,  especially  with  regard  to  iCT-
SAD

Who will take informed consent? {26a}

Informed consent will be obtained by the assessor during 
the eligibility assessment. Prior to this assessment, poten-
tial  participants  will  have  been  sent  the  trial  information 
sheet,  which  includes  details  of  the  purpose,  design,  cri-
teria,  and  protection  of  personal  information.  During  the 
eligibility  assessment,  potential  participants  will  have  the 
opportunity  to  ask  questions  about  the  trial.  If  they  are 
happy  to  proceed,  informed  consent  will  be  taken  elec-
tronically  by  them  submitting  an  online  form.  This  form 
includes checkboxes for participants to state that they have 

 Yoshinaga et al. Trials          (2024) 25:492 

Page 4 of 12

received  the  trial  information  and  agree  to  participate  in 
the trial.

Additional consent provisions for collection and use 
of participant data and biological specimens {26b}

The  consent  form  includes  permission  to  store  an 
anonymised  version  of  the  dataset  in  an  online  reposi-
tory. No biological specimens will be collected.

Interventions
Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}

The  comparator  for  this  trial  is  TAU  alone.  TAU  con-
sists  of  standard  psychiatric  care,  where  participants 
visit their regular psychiatrist on a monthly basis. These 
appointments  focus  on  mood  and  symptom  monitor-
ing,  ongoing  assessment  of  safety  and  clinical  risk, 
and  medication  management.  TAU  was  chosen  as  the 
comparator  as  it  represents  standard  practice  for  the 
treatment of SAD in Japan. Japanese government regu-
lations and implementation guidelines require that any 
internet-delivered intervention must be combined with 
regular face-to-face ambulatory care provided [15,  16]. 
TAU  as  described  therefore  represents  an  appropriate 
comparator  for  the  intervention  arm,  which  combines 
iCT-SAD with TAU. After the post-assessment, partici-
pants in the control arm (TAU alone) will be offered the 
option to receive iCT-SAD.

Intervention description {11a}

The  intervention  for  this  trial  is  iCT-SAD  combined 
with TAU (iCT-SAD + TAU) (see the above item 6b for 
more details about TAU). iCT-SAD is an internet-deliv-
ered  therapist-guided  intervention  (see  ‘Introduction’) 
[8,  9].  iCT-SAD  contains  eight  core  modules  which 
cover  key  concepts  on  the  nature  and  maintenance  of 
social anxiety problems, plus 16 optional modules cov-
ering  common  beliefs  and  difficulties  associated  with 
SAD.  Participants  are  supported  to  complete  the  core 
modules  across  the  first  two  weeks  of  treatment.  Sub-
sequently,  the  therapist  releases  those  optional  mod-
ules  that  are  particularly  relevant  to  each  participant’s 
concerns.  Participants  are  also  supported  to  conduct 
‘behavioural  experiments’,  in  which  they  test  out  their 
feared  concerns  in  social  situations  whilst  focussing 
their  attention  externally  and  dropping  their  safety 
behaviours.  Trained  therapists  support  participants  by 
telephone,  text  messages,  and  video  calls  via  webcam. 
Each  telephone  call  lasts  approximately  20  min  and  is 
used  to  review  questionnaire  measures,  progress  with 
modules  and  behavioural  experiments,  and  planning 
for  the  coming  week.  To  support  initial  engagement, 
two phone calls per week are scheduled during the first 
2  weeks  of  treatment,  followed  by  once-weekly  phone 

calls  until  the  end  of  the  14-week  treatment  phase. 
During  the  subsequent  follow-up  period,  up  to  three 
booster calls are scheduled at monthly intervals.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated 
interventions {11b}

If  participants  have  a  concern  about  their  treatment  or 
participation in the trial, they will be encouraged to dis-
cuss  this  with  their  therapist  in  the  first  instance.  The 
therapist and trial team will then consider whether these 
concerns  can  be  addressed  through  more  careful  tailor-
ing of the intervention to the participant’s needs. If this is 
not possible and the participant wishes to withdraw from 
the trial, they are free to do so.

If  negative  events  occur  that  require  some  form  of 
urgent  alternative  treatment  (e.g.  substance  misuse, 
deliberate  self-harm,  suicidal  ideation  or  attempts),  the 
project  lead  will  be  informed  immediately  to  consider 
appropriate  actions,  liaising  with  the  participant’s  pri-
mary psychiatrist to arrange onward referrals.

Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}

All  trial  therapists  have  previous  experience  of  using 
cognitive  therapy  approaches  to  treat  SAD.  They  have 
received specialist training in iCT-SAD from an expert in 
this  treatment  protocol  and  have  experience  of  treating 
clients using iCT-SAD from a recent pilot trial. All thera-
pists  will  receive  regular  group  supervision  throughout 
the  trial,  which  will  include  reviewing  therapists’  use 
of  the  iCT-SAD  site  to  support  adherence  to  protocol. 
Monthly  supervision-of-supervision  will  be  provided  by 
the UK team to ensure delivery is consistent with previ-
ous studies of iCT-SAD.

Participants  are  supported  to  adhere  to  the  interven-
tion  protocol  in  a  number  of  ways.  Treatment  begins 
with a more intensive phase in the first 2 weeks, support-
ing participants to make a strong start on their treatment, 
to  develop  engagement  and  motivation.  Their  therapist 
can  review  their  progress  working  through  treatment 
modules  and  behavioural  experiments  and  will  provide 
encouragement, help, and reminders as necessary. Thera-
pists and supervisors will review participants’ activity on 
the iCT-SAD regularly. This provides an effective method 
for  adherence  monitoring,  for  example  by  examining 
whether  modules  or  other  therapy  exercises  have  been 
completed.

Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited 
during the trial {11d}

There are no restrictions on the TAU component of each 
treatment arm. Each primary psychiatrist will continue to 
provide usual treatment as clinically indicated, including 
medication changes if necessary. However, the initiation 

Yoshinaga et al. Trials          (2024) 25:492 

Page 5 of 12

of  other  structured  psychological  therapy  is  prohibited 
in  order  to  measure  directly  the  effectiveness  of  iCT-
SAD.  All  treatment  changes,  with  the  reasons  for  these 
changes, will be recorded throughout the trial period.

Provisions for post‑trial care {30}

Following trial participation, all participants will remain 
under  the  care  of  their  primary  psychiatrist,  who  will 
review their clinical needs and arrange further treatment 
as appropriate.

studies  of  iCT-SAD  [8,  9,  11,  12].  Response  is  defined 
as an improvement in the LSAS between pre- and post-
treatment  greater  than  31%.  This  is  comparable  to  an 
improvement  subscore  of  2  ‘much  improved’  on  the 
Clinical  Global  Impression,  a  psychiatric  measure  com-
monly  used  to  define  a  response.  Remission  is  defined 
as a decrease in the LSAS score of at least 12 points and 
post-treatment  score  of  38  points  or  less.  Reliable  dete-
rioration is defined as an increase of at least 12 points in 
the LSAS score.

Outcomes {12}

Acceptability

The  principal  assessment  points  for  outcome  measures 
will  be  baseline (week 0), mid-treatment (week  8), post-
treatment  (week  15),  and  3-month  follow-up  (week  27, 
intervention  arm  only).  The  primary  assessment  time-
point is post-treatment (week 15).

Primary outcome measure

The  primary  outcome  is  a  self-report  version  of  the 
Liebowitz  Social  Anxiety  Scale  (LSAS)  [17],  one  of  the 
most  widely  used  scales  to  assess  the  severity  of  social 
anxiety.

Secondary outcome measures

Secondary outcome measures will be as follows.

Social anxiety symptoms and processes

The  proportion  of  participants  who  no  longer  meet  the 
SAD diagnostic criteria will be evaluated using the Anxi-
ety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 
(ADIS-5)  [18,  19]  conducted  by  an  independent  asses-
sor  blinded  to  the  treatment  arm  at  the  post-treatment 
time point. Psychological processes that maintain SAD in 
the Clark and Wells model [2] will be assessed using the 
Social  Cognitions  Questionnaire  (SCQ),  Social  Behav-
iour  Questionnaire  (SBQ),  Social  Attitudes  Question-
naire  (SAQ),  and  Social  Phobia  Weekly  Summary  Scale 
(SPWSS), as described in Clark (2005) [20]. Social partic-
ipation and social satisfaction will also be assessed [21].

General mood and functioning

Depressive  symptoms  will  be  assessed  with  the  Patient 
Health  Questionnaire  (PHQ-9)  [22,  23],  generalised 
anxiety  symptoms  with  the  Generalised  Anxiety  Dis-
order  Questionnaire  (GAD-7)  [24,  25],  and  functional 
impairments with the Work and Social Adjustment Scale 
(WSAS) [26].

Response to treatment

Response to treatment, remission from SAD, and reliable 
deterioration  are  defined  using  the  criteria  described  in 
a  pilot  trial  in  Japan  [14],  which  are  based  on  previous 

To  examine  the  acceptability  of  iCT-SAD,  we  will  also 
evaluate  the  dropout  rate,  rates  of  module  completion, 
and  participants’  feedback  about  their  experience  with 
the intervention.

Participant timeline {13}

Participant  enrolment  will  proceed  in  three  stages  as 
described below.

Stage 1

Psychiatrist  discusses  the  trial  with  a  potential  partici-
pant and makes a referral to the trial team if appropriate. 
They provide relevant contact details, clinical assessment 
information, and confirmation that they are able to pro-
vide  ongoing  TAU  throughout  the  trial.  The  trial  office 
will then send the potential participant the trial informa-
tion, eligibility screening questions, and initial question-
naire  pack  to  complete  and  return.  Eligible  participants 
are then invited for an assessment session.

Stage 2

The  assessment  session  is  conducted  by  one  of  the  trial 
therapists  in  person  or  via  videoconference.  It  will  con-
firm the primary diagnosis of SAD using ADIS-5, assess 
comorbid conditions using the Structured Clinical Inter-
view for DSM-5 Disorders (SCID-5) [27], and assess eli-
gibility  criteria,  risk,  and  current  medication.  Informed 
consent  will  be  taken  electronically.  The  trial  team  will 
then discuss whether the participant is eligible.

Stage 3

The  trial  office  will  contact  the  participant  to  inform 
them whether they are eligible to take part, and if so, to 
confirm that they are still willing to participate and pro-
ceed  with  randomisation.  If  they  agree  to  proceed,  the 
assessor  will  inform  the  trial  office  for  randomisation. 
The  assessor  will  inform  the  participant  of  the  alloca-
tion. A trial therapist is then assigned and appointments 
are arranged. For an overview of the trial procedure, see 
Table 1 (time schedule) and Fig. 1 (flow diagram).

Sample size {14}

Sample size was calculated a priori for the between-group 
comparison  of  LSAS  scores  from  baseline  to  post-treat-
ment. The controlled effect size (Cohen’s d) observed in 
a previous randomised controlled trial of iCT-SAD com-
pared to a waitlist control group with continuing primary 
care in the UK [8] was 2.2, which equates to a mean dif-
ference of 44 LSAS points. However, as the present trial 
uses a different population and cultural setting and is the 
first  randomised  controlled  trial  of  iCT-SAD  translated 
into another language, we used a conservative estimated 
mean difference of half this value (22 points). This calcu-
lation (using β = 0.9, α = 0.05, and a LSAS standard devia-
tion  of  19)  indicated  a  required  minimum  sample  of  16 
participants per arm. Given the planned analyses of sec-
ondary  measures  and  allowing  for  attrition  (up  to  20% 
dropout),  we  need  30  participants  per  group,  making  a 
total sample size of 60 to ensure the trial is fully powered 
to answer the research questions.

Assignment of interventions: allocation
Sequence generation {16a}

Participants  will  be  randomly  assigned  to  either  the 
intervention  or  control  arm  at  a  ratio  of  1:1,  with  the 
assignments made by the Internet Data and Information 
Center  for  Medical  Research  (INDICE)  cloud,  provided 
by the University Hospital Medical Information Network 
(UMIN).  Randomisation  will  be  stratified  by  baseline 
LSAS  severity  (≥ 78  or  less).  A  minimization  algorithm 
will be used to ensure a balance between arms.

Concealment mechanism {16b}

The random allocation will be carried out by the UMIN 
INDICE  cloud,  an  internet-based  central  randomisation 
system.  Allocation  concealment  will  be  ensured,  as  the 
allocation result for each participant will not be visible to 
the  trial  team  before  they  have  been  assigned  to  one  of 
the treatment arms.

Recruitment {15}

Implementation {16c}

Participants  will  be  recruited  from  psychiatric  institu-
tions  in  Japan,  via  referrals  from  their  primary  psychia-
trist.  To  ensure  sufficient  participant  recruitment,  the 
trial  will  be  promoted  via  trial  therapists’  networks  and 
relevant  medical  institutions  using  posters,  leaflets,  and 
digital media.

Once  an  eligible  participant  has  agreed  to  participate, 
the  assessor  will  inform  the  trial  office.  An  independent 
research  assistant  will  access  the  UMIN  INDICE  cloud 
and  enter  the  necessary  baseline  information.  The  ran-
dom allocation to either arm will be centrally generated. 
The trial office will inform the therapist of the allocation 
result and the therapist will then contact the participant.

Assignment of interventions: blinding
Who will be blinded {17a}

Owing  to  the  nature  of  psychological  interventions, 
it  is  not  possible  to  blind  participants  or  therapists  to 

the  intervention  condition.  A  qualified  independent 
assessor  who  conducts  ADIS-5  for  SAD  at  the  post-
treatment  point  will  be  blinded  to  the  intervention 
condition.

Page 8 of 12

Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b}

The  independent  assessor  of  ADIS-5  for  SAD  will 
remain blinded throughout the trial. No other blinding is 
planned so unblinding will not occur.

Data collection and management
Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a}

All  participants  will  be  given  baseline  questionnaires 
through  an  online  survey  platform.  Settings  will  be 
used to alert participants to items they have missed and 
require  a  response  to  prevent  missing  data.  Participants 
in  the  intervention  arm  will  complete  questionnaires 
using the iCT-SAD programme. Participants in the con-
trol arm will complete questionnaires through an online 
survey  platform,  with  email  reminders  from  the  trial 
office. Japanese language versions of the below question-
naires will be used.

LSAS  (primary  outcome)  is  a  24-item  scale  with  two 
subscales, fear/anxiety and avoidance of social situations. 
Each  item  is  rated  on  a  four-item  Likert  scale  ranging 
from  0  (no  fear/never  avoidance)  to  3  (high  fear/usually 
avoidance),  with  lower  scores  indicating  a  better  out-
come.  The  Japanese  version  of  LSAS  has  good  internal 
consistency and construct validity [28, 29].

SPWSS  is  a  6-item  scale  of  self-focused  attention, 
anticipatory processing, post-event processing, and other 
variables, with each item rated on a scale from 0 to 8 [20].
SCQ is a 22-item scale that assesses the most common 
negative  automatic  thoughts  related  to  SAD  [20].  Each 
thought is rated in terms of how often it occurred in the 
last week and how much it is believed. The mean scores 
for  frequency  (mean  ranges  from  1  to  5)  and  for  belief 
(mean  ranges  from  0  to  100)  are  computed  separately, 
with lower scores indicating a better outcome.

PHQ-9  is  a  validated  scale  for  assessing  depres-
sive  symptoms  [22,  23].  This  scale  contains  9  questions 
answered on a 4-point Likert scale, with numbers from 0 
(not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A higher score reflects 
more severe symptoms.

GAD-7 is a validated questionnaire commonly used to 
assess  generalised  anxiety  symptoms  and  their  severity 
[24,  30].  This  scale  consists  of  7  questions  answered  on 
a 4-item Likert scale, with numbers from 0 (not at all) to 
3 (nearly every day). A higher score reflects more severe 
symptoms.

WSAS  is  a  five-item  scale  that  measures  perceived 
functional  impairment  across  five  domains:  work,  home 
management,  social  leisure  activities,  private  leisure 
activities,  and  relationships  with  others  [26].  Each  item 
is  rated  on  a  9-point  severity  scale  ranging  from  0  (not 
at all) to 8 (very severely), based on the degree to which 
the issue impedes one’s ability to perform an activity. The 

Japanese version of the WSAS has good internal consist-
ency and construct validity [31].

SBQ is a 29-item scale that assesses the extent to which 
patients  engage  in  a  range  of  common  social  anxiety 
related safety behaviours [20]. Each of the 29 behaviours 
are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 3 
(Always), with lower scores indicating a better outcome.

SAQ  is  a  50-item  scale  that  assesses  a  range  of  com-
mon beliefs about oneself and social interactions that are 
thought to make individuals vulnerable to SAD [20]. The 
beliefs  fall  into  three  broad  categories:  ‘Excessively  high 
standards  for  social  performance’,  ‘Conditional  Beliefs’ 
and ‘Unconditional Beliefs’. Each item is rated on a 7-item 
Likert scale ranging from 1 (Totally disagree) to 7 (Totally 
agree), with lower scores indicating a good outcome.

Social  participation  and  social  satisfaction  are  meas-
ured  with  Alden  and  Taylor’s  scales  [21].  Social  par-
ticipation  has  13  items  that  ask  about  the  frequency  of 
participation in social interactions, events, and conversa-
tions in the last month. Each item is rated from 1 (not at 
all) to 7 (frequently). Social satisfaction has five items that 
ask about satisfaction with relationships with colleagues, 
friends, and partners in the last month. Each item is rated 
from 1 (not satisfied at all) to 7 (very satisfied).

Plans to promote participant retention and complete 
follow‑up {18b}

Participants will be in regular contact with their primary 
psychiatrist and/or iCT-SAD therapist, who will provide 
support and encouragement, and are available to discuss 
any  concerns  participants  may  have  about  treatment  or 
trial  participation.  Trial  information  and  initial  assess-
ment  procedures  will  clarify  the  timescale  of  treatment 
and  explain  the  clinical  importance  of  receiving  a  full 
‘dose’ of iCT-SAD. Any participants who withdraw early 
from  either  arm  will  be  invited  to  complete  follow-up 
questionnaires  at  the  relevant  remaining  principal  time 
points.

Data management {19}

Most of the data gathered online and saved to a database 
will be coded automatically. Metadata about participants’ 
activity on the iCT-SAD programme (e.g. time spent on 
different  parts  of  the  programme)  will  be  automatically 
recorded. As most of the data will be collected automati-
cally  via  secure  online  platforms  specifically  designed 
for  research  purposes,  high  data  quality  will  generally 
be  guaranteed.  Only  a  small  fraction  of  data  (e.g.  base-
line  demographic  data,  diagnostic  assessment  by  an 
independent assessor) will be entered and uploaded to a 
secure server by the assessor or the trial office. The trial 
office  will  regularly  check  the  overall  data  quality  and 
completeness.

Confidentiality {27}

Personal  information  of  potential  and  enrolled  par-
ticipants  will  be  collected  and  stored  on  a  secure  server 
available  only  to  the  trial  office.  Participant’s  name,  tel-
ephone  number,  and  e-mail  address  will  be  informed 
only to the trial office and the trial therapist who will be 
assigned to them. Upon enrolment, each participant will 
be  assigned  a  unique  participant  identification  number 
for use in the data files created for the analysis. Data are 
kept in a secured storage and only authorised researchers 
or staff at the trial office are granted access by the princi-
pal investigator.

The  iCT-SAD  programme  has  numerous  security  fea-
tures  representing  current  best  practice  and  complies 
with high data security standards. It employs secure cli-
ent–server communication, full encryption of the server 
database,  enforcement  of  strong  passwords,  two-factor 
authentication,  and  hosting  on  a  tier  4  hosting  server. 
External  access  to  the  database  using  the  Secure  Shell 
Protocol is prohibited. The system has been subjected to 
industry-standard  penetration  testing.  Online  data  are 
secured  by  encryption  to  prevent  access  from  outside 
parties.  Access  to  the  server  data  by  the  software  com-
pany hosting the online therapy programmes (Whiskered 
Wizard)  is  protected  by  non-disclosure  agreements  and 
the Data Protection Act.

Plans for collection, laboratory evaluation, and storage 
of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis 
in this trial/future use {33}

Not applicable. See the above item 26b; there will be no 
biological specimens collected.

Statistical methods
Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes 
{20a}

A  separate  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  will  be  devel-
oped and approved by the trial team and an independent 
statistician before the database is locked. A detailed SAP 
will be uploaded to the trial registry (ISRCTN82859645). 
A brief overview of these analyses is given below.

Statistical  analysis  and  reporting  of  this  trial  will  be 
conducted  in  accordance  with  CONSORT  guidelines, 
with  the  primary  analyses  based  on  the  intent-to-treat 
principle  without  imputing  missing  observations.  All 
statistical tests will be two-sided, and the level of signifi-
cance will be set to 0.05. For the baseline variables, sum-
mary  statistics  are  constructed  employing  frequencies 
and  proportions  for  categorical  variables  and  mean  and 
standard deviation for continuous variables.

Linear mixed effect models will be used to analyse the 
primary  and  continuous  secondary  outcome  measures. 

Time (mid, post), treatment arm (TAU + iCT-SAD, TAU 
alone), and the time-by-arm interaction will be specified 
as categorical fixed factors, with the stratification variable 
(baseline  LSAS)  as  a  fixed  covariate  and  participant  as 
a  random  effect.  For  the  analysis  of  secondary  outcome 
measures,  the  baseline  score  of  the  analysed  measure  is 
also included as a fixed covariate.

Standardised  between-group  effect  sizes  will  be  cal-
culated by dividing the adjusted group difference by the 
baseline  standard  deviation  of  the  whole  sample.  Stand-
ardised within-group effect sizes will be calculated from 
separate  models  that  use  the  baseline  score  as  a  time-
point rather than a covariate.

Categorical secondary outcome measures (loss of diag-
nosis, response to treatment, and categorical acceptabil-
ity  outcomes)  will  be  analysed  using  Fisher’s  exact  test. 
All other results will be reported descriptively.

Benchmarking  will  be  performed  through  descriptive 
comparisons  of  the  present  results  in  relation  to  previous 
studies of iCT-SAD in the UK and Hong Kong [8, 9, 11, 12].
Baseline  clinical  and  demographic  characteristics  will 
be  examined  as  moderators  of  treatment  outcomes  by 
running  linear  mixed  effect  models  (iCT-SAD + TAU 
only) with each candidate moderator added.

Mediation  models  will  examine  candidate  media-
tors  of  the  relationship  between  randomisation  (treat-
ment  arm)  and  post-treatment  LSAS  scores  following 
the  procedure  described  by  Freeman  et  al.  [32].  The 
candidate  mediators  will  be  negative  social  cognitions 
(SCQ),  safety  behaviours  (SBQ),  self-focused  attention 
(the  general  self-focused  attention  item  of  the  SPWSS), 
rumination  (the  rumination  item  of  the  SPWSS),  and 
depressed  mood  (PHQ).  Mid-timepoint  scores  are  used 
as  the  mediator,  and  post-treatment  LSAS  scores  as  the 
outcome. All models include baseline LSAS and baseline 
mediator scores as covariates.

Interim analyses {21b}

No interim analyses are planned.

Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) 
{20b}

No additional analyses are planned.

Methods in analysis to handle protocol non‑adherence 
and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c}

Primary analyses will be performed based on the intent-
to-treat  principle.  Data  completeness  will  be  evaluated 
and  reported  at  each  timepoint  in  each  arm.  Linear 
mixed  effect  models  implicitly  account  for  data  missing 
at  random;  therefore,  multiple  imputation  of  missing 
observations is not planned.

Plans to give access to the full protocol, participant 
level‑data, and statistical code {31c}

The  trial  protocol  was  prospectively  registered 
in 
ISRCTN and UMIN-CTR. After the data have been used 
for all trial purposes, an anonymised version of the data-
set  will  be  deposited  in  an  online  repository  for  perma-
nent archiving to use in future studies or meta-analyses.

Oversight and monitoring
Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering 
committee {5d}

This  trial  does  not  have  a  coordinating  centre  or  trial 
steering  committee.  The  principal  investigator  (NY)  is 
responsible  for  the  overall  aspects  of  the  trial.  The  trial 
team  meets  every  week  to  oversee  the  progress  of  the 
trial  and  the  completion  of  tasks  and  to  review  neces-
sary  changes  to  the  protocol  to  facilitate  the  smooth 
running of the trial. Any major changes to the trial pro-
tocol will be reviewed and verified by the Research Ethics 
Committee.

Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role, 
and reporting structure {21a}

Due to the low-risk nature of the intervention, the short 
duration  of  the  trial,  and  the  fact  that  interim  analyses 
may not provide necessarily informative results given the 
nature  of  the  trial,  the  establishment  of  a  data  monitor-
ing committee is not considered necessary. All outcome 
measures are coded directly into a web programme that 
cannot  be  adjusted  with  all  actions  being  logged.  Data 
will  be  monitored  for  completeness  and  consistency  by 
the trial team. The trial team and statistician will have full 
access to the final trial dataset.

SAEs are defined as negative events that occur during 
treatment  that  require  some  form  of  urgent  alternative 
treatment  (e.g.  substance  misuse,  deliberate  self-harm, 
suicidal ideation or attempts).

Trial  therapists  will  identify  and  record  their  partici-
pants’  AE/SAEs  when  providing  iCT-SAD  treatment. 
Participants in both arms will also be asked to report any 
negative effects experienced during the trial, via a check-
list  included  in  the  mid-,  post-treatment,  and  3-month 
FU  assessment  packs.  AEs  will  be  reviewed  on  a  regu-
lar  basis  by  the  trial  team,  including  in  clinical  supervi-
sion. SAEs will be brought to the project lead’s attention 
immediately  to  consider  what  actions  may  be  appropri-
ate.  This  would  likely  include  contact  with  the  partici-
pant’s primary psychiatrist.

Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23}

No audit is planned for trial conduct. The principal inves-
tigator is obliged to and will inform the Research Ethics 
Committee in case of any major deviations from the trial 
design approved by the Committee.

Plans for communicating important protocol amendments 
to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical 
committees) {25}

All  protocol  amendments  will  follow  the  Research  Eth-
ics  Committee  revision  process  and  will  be  approved 
prior to their implementation. Where necessary, the trial 
team  members  will  be  informed  via  email  or  in  clinical 
supervision. Deviations from the published protocol will 
be documented in the trial registration on ISRCTN and 
UMIN-CTR.

Adverse event reporting and harms {22}

Dissemination plans {31a}

All  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  severe  adverse  events 
(SAEs),  which  may  or  may  not  be  related  to  treatment, 
will  be  logged  throughout  the  trial.  Based  on  the  guid-
ance of Rozental et al. [33], these include the following:

•  Worsening of SAD symptoms
•  Negative  events  probably  emerging  from  treatment 

perceived as adverse by the patient

•  Emergence  of  new  psychological  symptoms  unre-
lated to those targeted in treatment (e.g. new occur-
rence of insomnia, panic attacks, etc.).

•  External  negative  events  in  participant’s  life  (e.g. 

bereavement, other stressors)

•  Other  events  experienced  as  negative  by  the  patient 
during  treatment,  which  may  or  may  not  be  related 
to  treatment  (e.g.  issues  related  to  treatment  con-
tent, increased anxiety during experiments, technical 
issues).

The findings of this trial will be disseminated to academic 
and  professional  audiences  via  publications  in  peer-
reviewed  journals  and  presentations  at  academic  con-
ferences,  and  to  the  broader  public  via  public  talks  and 
media/press releases. All findings from the trial, whether 
negative or positive, will be reported.

Discussion
Investigating the efficacy of internet interventions in dif-
ferent cultural contexts is an important step in determin-
ing whether the potential global reach of such treatments 
can be achieved. This trial provides a valuable examina-
tion  of  iCT-SAD  combined  with  usual  care,  which  is  a 
good reflection of how the treatment might subsequently 
be provided in routine settings. It offers a further contri-
bution  to  the  small  but  growing  literature  on  the  inter-
national  dissemination  of  internet  interventions  and  to 
our  understanding  of  treating  social  anxiety  in  Japan.  A 

Yoshinaga et al. Trials          (2024) 25:492

limitation  of  this  trial  is  that  an  active  comparator  arm 
will not be employed, meaning the specific effects of iCT-
SAD  relative  to  other  internet  interventions  cannot  be 
revealed.

Trial status
Protocol  version  1.0,  2023-October-18.  The  study  is 
planned to begin in November 2023 and is estimated to 
be completed in December 2025. Recruitment is planned 
to  begin  in  January  2024  and  is  estimated  to  be  com-
pleted in May 2025.
