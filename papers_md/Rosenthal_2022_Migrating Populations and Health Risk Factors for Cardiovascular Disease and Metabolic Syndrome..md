Abstract
Purpose of Review  To summarize results of recent studies of migrants in Europe and North America and ongoing efforts to 
adapt strategies to provide them with inclusive sensitive health care.
Recent Findings  Major predisposing factors for developing hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome 
in migrating populations and refugees were identified. Susceptibility to the metabolic syndrome is predominantly due to 
environmental factors and psychological stress. Acculturation also contributes to the emergence of cardiovascular (CV) 
risk factors in first-generation adult immigrants. Increased risk for later development of hypertension and dyslipidemia has 
also been detected in adolescent immigrants. Targets for public health efforts were based on data that show important dif-
ferences in CV risk factors and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among ethnic immigrant groups. Studies in young 
adults focused on lifestyle and dietary behaviors and perceptions about weight and body image, while the focus for older 
adults was end-of-life issues.
Summary  Two important themes have emerged: barriers to health care, with a focus on cultural and language barriers, and 
violence and its impact on immigrants’ mental health.

Introduction

This is an update of the comprehensive reviews of the effects 
of migration on hypertension and cardiac risk factors pub-
lished in 2014 and 2018 [1, 2]. Here we focus on challenges 
that  affect  the  health  and  well-being  of  immigrants  and 
refugees in different countries (Fig. 1). Acculturation, the 
process by which an individual adopts, acquires, and adjusts 
to a new cultural environment, is usually defined in two

dimensions: degree of contact and participation in the larger 
“new” society and the maintenance of the “old” heritage, 
culture, and identity [3••, 4]. Four acculturation strategies 
have been described: (1) “assimilation strategy,” seeking 
daily interaction with the host culture, (2) “separation strat-
egy,” maintaining cultural identity and avoiding interaction 
with the host culture, (3) “integration strategy,” combining 
features of both assimilation and separation strategies, and 
(4) “marginalization strategy,” reflecting loss of the ability 
and interest to connect with other cultures. These strategies 
have been adopted, individually or in combination, by immi-
grant groups. Studies suggest that increased participation, 
integration, and assimilation in the host culture is associ-
ated with better health and disease management compared 
with adoption of marginalization and separation strategies 
[1, 2, 3••, 4]. Those who successfully apply dual modes 
of social behavior and develop attachment to both the host 
culture and the culture of origin are expected to be better 
self-managers. Acculturation results in changes in lifestyle, 
including the level and type of physical activity, as well as 
dietary changes such as consuming higher levels of sodium 
and fats and more processed foods, common in developed

countries. These lifestyle changes are perceived as major 
predisposing factors for developing hypertension, obesity, 
diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome [1, 2, 3••, 4, 5].

Migration is associated with increased stress and risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) [6–12]. Blood pressure (BP) 
elevation occurs early with migration, and may be a useful 
strategy for measuring the impact of acculturation [1]. Some 
studies indicate that immigrants’ eating patterns serve as an 
index of their degree of acculturation and associated health 
risks, but others consider the stress associated with cultural 
change, reflected in higher BP, to have a greater effect than 
changes in diet or physical activity [2]. Other studies suggest 
that effects of acculturation on BP are common and that the 
magnitude of the effects is not region-specific, but similar 
worldwide. However, there are differences between immi-
grants’ cultures, countries of origin, and host countries that 
modify the effects of acculturation on BP [13, 14].

Definition of Migrating Populations

The studies included in this review refer to three popula-
tions: immigrants, migrants, and refugees. An immigrant 
is a person who comes to a country to take up permanent 
residence. A migrant is any individual who moves across 
international borders away from their country of origin, 

regardless of legal status or cause [3••, 4, 15]. A refugee is 
a person who, resulting from a well-founded fear of persecu-
tion for reasons of race, religion, nationality, and/or mem-
bership of a particular social group or political opinion, is 
outside the country of his/her nationality and is either unable 
or too afraid to seek protection of the host country. Each 
of these migrating populations places a different burden on 
the host country to provide health care, humanitarian aid, 
and social care. The distinction between these populations 
is often the result of the host country’s assessment based on 
their political stance in granting temporary or permanent sta-
tus. Refugees are not generally screened for chronic diseases 
and may not be up to date on immunizations against vaccine-
preventable diseases [16, 17]. Determining the health care 
needs of specific groups should lead to the establishment 
of evidence-based guidelines for providing screening and 
health care services to immigrant populations. This will ben-
efit both the migrant and the host country [1, 2].

The majority of investigations evaluating cardiovascular 
and metabolic risks in migrants are population-based, cross-
sectional studies of trends and rates of hypertension, hyper-
cholesterolemia, diabetes, abdominal obesity, and high body 
mass index (BMI) [14, 18]. These studies make comparisons 
between the migrating populations and native populations 
in  the  host  country,  including  comparing  newly  arrived 
migrants  and  refugees  with  settled,  urbanized  migrant

populations, populations in the migrants’ country of origin, 
and age-matched non-immigrants in the host country [18].

Health Issues and Refugees in Europe

There has been a continuous flow of immigrants from the 
global south to northwestern countries, including Germany, 
the Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy [19, 20]. Immigrants are 
typically motivated to leave their native countries due to the 
inability to achieve economic and social development. They 
flee from countries where dictatorial regimes have impov-
erished the population and sown hatred and famine during 
years of wars between states, civil wars, and tribal clashes. 
In 2015, over one million displaced people entered Europe. 
Numerous studies have found that a major challenge fac-
ing health care systems is providing inclusive and culturally 
sensitive health care to refugee populations. Collaborative 
efforts should focus on forming multidisciplinary teams 
coordinated with local health care systems and organiza-
tions to meet the needs of the refugees. Upon arrival, refu-
gees should receive an immediate health assessment. Fur-
ther interventions then need to be coordinated. Health care 
providers and services need to be informed about the special 
needs of the refugees for their mental and physical care, 
and transportation must be arranged to ensure the efficient 
delivery of that care [21, 22]. Many health problems, includ-
ing maternal and reproductive issues, high risk of sexual 
abuse, and pregnancy, are specific for female refugees [23]. 
Access to preventative health screening as well as prenatal 
and obstetric care upon arrival is crucial in order to identify 
problems stemming from poor nutrition, exposure to vio-
lence, and drug and alcohol abuse [19].

The duration of migration or refugee status can impact 
health and should be taken into consideration, as most com-
mon health problems of refugees may be related to the situ-
ation in their home countries and the journey to the host 
countries. The increasing burden of hosting and caring for 
large immigrant populations requires cooperation and coor-
dination by the host countries. The long-term solution for 
these refugees will involve a coordinated effort to reduce the 
socioeconomic and health inequalities that drive increas-
ing populations worldwide to become refugees. In the short 
term, there is a need to increase preparedness for the man-
agement  of  both  communicable  and  non-communicable 
diseases with interventions based on evidence collected on 
global disease and medical needs during migration. Early 
intervention in refugee camps, as well as longer term inter-
vention strategies and collaboration between physicians, 
health care workers, and public health authorities, is impor-
tant for the integration of these populations into the host 
countries [19, 20, 24].

A systematic review of 26 articles on refugees’ experi-
ences with health care in European host countries showed 
that refugees suffer from worse mental and physical health 
and are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality compared 
to the native populations of the host countries [25]. Factors 
that contribute to increased morbidity due to chronic dis-
eases in migrants include (i) poor communication between 
migrants and health care providers in the host country, (ii) 
violence and mental health, (iii) unvaccinated status, (iv) 
poor maternal health, and (v) impact of western cultures on 
adolescents.

Cultural and Language Barriers to Health Care

Poor communication due to linguistic and cultural differ-
ences often leads to refugees experiencing discrimination 
due to low proficiency in the language of the host coun-
try and because of their race or accent [26, 27]. Culturally 
appropriate health care is needed and includes improved 
communication between the migrants and the health care 
providers. Providing support to refugees through good com-
munications allows them to have a positive experience with 
health care. Furthermore, refugees need written and oral 
information about the host country’s health care system and 
their rights to its utilization.

Violence and Mental Health

A study of newly arrived migrants and refugees in Europe 
showed that mental illness and social difficulties significantly 
impacted morbidity rates [24]. Asylum seekers in Belgium 
and the Netherlands suffer primarily from psychological 
illness [28]. It is impossible to discuss refugees, migrants, 
and immigration without mention of violence: both the vio-
lence that led to the movement from the home country and 
the violence faced in the host country [29]. Refugees, asy-
lum seekers, and undocumented migrants, even those with 
a higher education and past professional experience, often 
suffer a decline in socioeconomic position and low social 
status linked to their immigration status [30]. This restricts 
them from working, participating freely in civil society, and 
investing in the host country by turning their human capital 
potential into economic and social capital. Low social status 
predicts ill health, and low income is associated with the 
progression of ill health. Women, young people, and refu-
gees are particularly vulnerable to sexual and gender-based 
violence worldwide, putting these populations at great risk 
of high morbidity [31, 32].

Vaccine‑Preventable Diseases

Infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines play a 
significant role in the overall burden of disease. A systematic 

1 3328 

Current Hypertension Reports (2022) 24:325–340

review  of  vaccine-preventable  diseases  in  Europe  (i.e., 
hepatitis B, measles, rubella, mumps, tetanus, poliomyeli-
tis, pertussis, diphtheria, meningitis, and varicella) found 
that migrants and refugees have lower immunization rates 
compared to European-born individuals [33]. The factors 
that determine the vulnerability of immigrants to infectious 
diseases include the country of origin, the period of time the 
migrants traveled until they first arrived, whether they settled 
in refugee camps or other reception sites, and further reset-
tlement. Information on immunization status of migrants is 
often lacking, and the lack of coordination among public 
health authorities of neighboring countries may result in 
either duplicate or absent vaccine administration. Migrants 
often refuse registration with medical authorities for fear of 
legal consequences. In addition, migrants often continue to 
move about in their host country, which is problematic since 
many vaccines require multiple doses at regular intervals. 
Finally, prevention of disease by immunization suffers the 
same barriers as prevention or treatment of any other dis-
ease: lack of the patient’s understanding of treatment due to 
challenges in communication between health care providers 
and services and the refugees, migrants, and immigrants in 
need of treatment. Elderly migrants and their children are 
particularly susceptible to infectious diseases [34].

Poor Maternal Health

Pregnant migrants and refugees are at increased risk of car-
diovascular and metabolic diseases compared to native-born 
women [35]. These inequities are compounded by the bar-
riers to care that many migrant and refugee women expe-
rience, such as cultural or linguistic challenges. A recent 
systemic review suggested various strategies to improve 
maternal and postpartum care, including culturally respon-
sive, woman-centered care, ensuring continuity of care, 
providing effective communications, and psychosocial and 
practical support to navigate health care systems in host 
countries. However, it is not clear which practices provide 
the greatest benefit [36].

was also present in urban areas in North African countries. 
Important contributing factors included westernization of 
eating habits, lack of physical activity, and body image per-
ception. Factors linked to acculturation in the host society 
and factors originating in the country of origin play a role in 
determining childhood overweight and obesity among North 
African immigrants in Europe [38].

Trends in Germany

During the past decade, with large numbers of refugees flee-
ing war-torn home countries, the German health care system 
has had to accommodate an increasing number of immi-
grants (20% of the population). Research of immigrant ori-
gin populations of all ages, from young children and adoles-
cents to elderly and aged, has been undertaken [39]. While 
studies in younger populations focused on lifestyle, dietary 
behaviors, and perceptions about weight and body image, the 
focus shifted to end of life issues in the older populations.

Hospice/Palliative Care Among Immigrants 
in Germany

An epidemiological study examined usage of hospice and 
palliative care (HPC) among 51- to 90-year-old immigrants 
in Berlin, Germany, in the 1960s and 1970s [40]. Although 
many of the immigrants needed hospice and palliative care, 
a significantly lower proportion of them used these facili-
ties compared to the general population. There were also 
differences in usage among ethnic groups. Turkish immi-
grants accounted for 24% of the immigrant population in 
Berlin, but only 14% used HPC facilities. Russian and Polish 
immigrants comprised 5% and 9% of this population and 
accounted for 11% and 24% of HPC usage, respectively. Pos-
sible reasons for these differences include lack of awareness 
of these populations by palliative care providers and insuf-
ficient knowledge on the part of immigrants regarding the 
type of care that was available to them.

Effect of Western Culture on Metabolic Health 
of Adolescent Immigrants

Vitamin D Deficiency in Turkish Women in Germany 
vs. Native German Women

Studies of young children and adolescents of immigrant ori-
gin often focus on behaviors (i.e., lifestyle, physical activity, 
and dietary habits) and perceptions about weight and body 
image since these children are particularly at risk of develop-
ing overweight and obesity, important risk factors for CVD 
and the metabolic syndrome [37•]. A review of longitudinal 
and cross-sectional studies in Europe found that the preva-
lence of childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity in 
ethnic groups from North Africa was higher compared with 
the European population, especially among girls. This trend 

Compared to native German women, Turkish women in 
Germany had a significantly higher prevalence of vitamin 
D insufficiency (74 percent vs 33 percent) and deficiency 
(44 percent vs 11 percent) [41]. Vitamin D insufficiency was 
most prevalent in Turkish women who wore traditional gar-
ments, perhaps limiting their exposure to sunlight. Providing 
vitamin D supplements and access to facilities that permit 
exposure to sunlight has been recommended as part of an 
overall preventative strategy to reduce the burden of vitamin 
D insufficiency in this immigrant group [42].

Transnational Travel Among Immigrant Groups 
in Germany

A  comparison  of  between-group  differences  and  indi-
vidual  level  determinants  of  transnational  travel  (i.e., 
frequency of return trips to their country of origin) was 
carried out among immigrant women in Germany [43]. 
Participants were of Russian, Jewish, or Turkish origin. 
There was substantial transnational travel by all groups, 
with the highest levels reported among Turkish immi-
grants. A major determinant of the frequency of transna-
tional travel in all three ethnicities was the network size in 
their home country. Co-ethnic identifying was a positive 
determinant only among the Turkish women. Importantly, 
as opposed to their emotional state when leaving Ger-
many, all of the women were happy and calm upon return 
from their homeland.

Metabolic Syndrome Among Non‑immigrant 
Adolescents in Germany and Iran

There were major differences in the prevalence of the 
metabolic  syndrome  and  its  three  main  components, 
defined  according  to  Pediatric  International  Diabetes 
Federation  (IDF)  criteria,  between  adolescents  from 
Germany and Iran [44]. The metabolic syndrome was 
four times more prevalent in Iranian than in German ado-
lescents. These ethnic disparities were revealed in two 
separate studies. The German adolescents were part of 
the German Prevention Education Program (PEP) Fam-
ily Heart Study, a prospective controlled study of the 
efficacy of family-oriented life style modification in the 
reduction of CV risk and disease [45]. The Iranian ado-
lescents were part of the Childhood and Adolescence 
Surveillance and Prevention of Adult Non-communicable 
Disease (CASPIAN) Study, a large national, cross-sec-
tional study of 14,440 Iranian children and adolescents 
[46]. Schwandt et al. confirmed the ethnic predisposition 
of non-Europeans, especially Asians, to central body fat 
deposition and the metabolic syndrome [44]. They agreed 
with the recommendation of the American Heart Asso-
ciation to consider the use of race and ethnicity-specific 
criteria in evaluation for the metabolic syndrome [47]. 
An additional analysis of PEP Family Heart Study data 
on German adolescents aged 12 to 18 years concluded 
that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as 
dyslipidemia and elevated BP can be detected in adoles-
cents by anthropometric screening. They found that risk 
factor clustering was three to four times higher among 
adolescents with abdominal obesity than in adolescents 
without abdominal obesity. Significant associations of 

abdominal obesity with hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 4.9), 
elevated LDL-C (OR: 2.0), low HDL-C (OR: 1.6), fast-
ing blood glucose (OR: 1.3), and a 2.5-fold higher risk 
of hypertension were also found [48].

The increasing prevalence of the metabolic syndrome 
in children and adolescents in recent decades has been 
attributed to changes in adolescent lifestyle (i.e., decrease 
in physical activity, changes in eating habits, and smok-
ing)  and  a  higher  prevalence  of  obesity  [49].  In  Iran, 
additional  factors,  including  epidemiologic  transition 
state  and  the  double  burden  of  nutritional  disorders, 
have led the authors of the CASPIAN study to review the 
prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Iranian children and 
adolescents. They found prevalence rates of metabolic 
syndrome of 1 to 22 percent, with higher rates in older 
children, likely as a result of changes occurring around 
puberty,  i.e.,  increased  insulin  resistance,  increased 
body fat, increased BP, and decreased insulin sensitiv-
ity  [50 ••].  These  findings  provide  useful  information 
for health policy makers for the prevention of the meta-
bolic syndrome and resultant CVD in the population. An 
additional analysis of the CASPIAN-V cross-sectional 
nationwide study collected data from 14,440 students, 
7 to 18 years of age, using validated questionnaires to 
gauge the students’ weight perception and psychological 
distress. Weight misperception, a discordance between 
an individual’s actual weight and perceived weight sta-
tus, which may indirectly reflect body dissatisfaction, 
was highly prevalent (59%) among Iranian children and 
adolescents, associated with their dietary patterns and 
physical activity behaviors [51].

Turkish and German Adolescents in Germany

Among adolescents, studies have focused on differences 
in  eating  behaviors  between  migrants  and  natives  and 
between ethnic groups in their home country vs. in their 
host  country.  Two  studies  examined  the  differences  in 
eating behavior between adolescents living in their home 
countries (Turkey and Germany) and Turkish migrant ado-
lescents living in Germany [52]. The longitudinal study 
included adolescent Turkish migrants and adolescent Ger-
mans. The cross-sectional study included adolescent Turk-
ish migrants and adolescent Turks living in Turkey. Both 
studies assessed eating behaviors (eating either unhealthy 
or healthy foods) using a prototype-willingness model, and 
data were collected with a questionnaire. Regulation of 
eating behavior among adolescent Turkish migrants was 
intentional, as compared to both native German and Turk-
ish adolescents, whose eating behavior was both impulsive 
and intentional.

Trends in Italy

Overweight and Obesity Among Adult Immigrants 
to Italy from Sub‑Saharan Africa, Central‑Western 
Asia, and the Americas

In 2012, there were nearly three million foreign citizens 
in Italy, according to the Italian National Institute of Sta-
tistics [53]. Currently, there are almost 5 million non-Ital-
ian citizens in Italy, representing about 8 percent of the 
country’s population [54]. This increase places a greater 
burden  on  Italy’s  health  care  system.  In  2011–2012,  a 
cross-sectional study of a subsample of 15,195 foreign-
ers aged 18 to 64 years evaluated sociodemographic and 
behavioral factors associated with overweight and obesity, 
defined as BMI > 25 kg/m2 and ≥ 30 kg/m2, respectively. 
Among foreigners in Italy, 31 percent were overweight 
(40 percent of men and 23 percent of women) and 7.5 
percent were obese. The probability of overweight and 
obesity was found to increase with age and with length of 
stay in Italy and to be higher among the unemployed and 
less educated immigrants. Compared to European born 
persons, the probability of overweight and obesity was 
lower among immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa and 
Central-Western Asia, and higher among immigrants from 
the Americas [54].

Weight and Nutritional Status in Moroccan Women 
in Rural Morocco and Immigrants to Urban Italy

A study evaluated the nutritional status and physical struc-
ture of immigrant Moroccan women in Italy as compared to 
their nonimmigrant counterparts living a traditional, rural 
lifestyle in Morocco in 2012 [55]. Changes in dietary hab-
its and lifestyle and in cultural, social, and economic status 
resulting from their migration were assessed. The immigrant 
group included Moroccan immigrant women (20–59 years), 
mostly leading an urban lifestyle; the non-immigrant Moroc-
can group included women (29–65 years) living a rural life-
style in the province of El Jadida. The immigrant women 
had major increases in weight, as assessed by both anthro-
pometric and impedentiometric parameters, with fat mass 
substantially greater than the women remaining in Morocco. 
Non-immigrant women had an average weight of 63 kg; the 
immigrant women, 70 kg. The BMI of immigrant Moroccan 
women in Italy was 34 percent; the BMI for nonimmigrant 
women living in Morocco was 29 percent. While immi-
grant Moroccan women tended to adopt a diet that included 
both traditional food and food typical of their host country 
(pasta), native women in Morocco had a diet based on non-
processed traditional food and local products.

Violence Among Immigrants and Refugees in Italy

In  a  cross-sectional  study,  interviews  were  conducted 
with immigrants and refugees, average age 35 years (15 
to 74 years) [56]. A total of 46 percent had experienced 
some form of violence since having arrived in Italy, with 40 
percent experiencing violence in the last 12 months and 21 
percent being victims of more than one form of violence. 
Among women, 56 percent experienced at least one form of 
violence and 28 percent experienced multiple victimizations, 
most of these occurring during the 12 months prior to the 
survey. Additionally, 62 percent experienced at least one epi-
sode of violence with racial discrimination; 69 percent did 
not know their attacker; 21 percent were attacked by their 
employer; and 6.5 percent were attacked by their partners. 
Furthermore, 69 percent of these attacks took place in the 
street. Over half of those interviewed experienced stress and 
anxiety disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder), and one-
third experienced chronic anxiety. In 75 percent of these vio-
lent attacks, the victim did not report the incident to anyone.

Belgium

Adolescents’ Health Behavior Regarding Diet and 
Effect on Overweight, According to Migration Status

The cross-national Health Behavior in School-Aged Chil-
dren survey was first conducted in 2014 in Belgium among 
19,172  adolescents  10–19  years  old,  70  percent  native 
Belgian, 22 percent second-generation immigrants, and 8 
percent first-generation immigrants [57]. Food consump-
tion, estimated using a self-administrated food frequency 
questionnaire, showed that 17.2 percent of adolescents ate 
fruits and 18.8 percent ate vegetables > once a day, while 
20.2 percent ate fish ≥ two days a week and 80 percent ate 
dairy products > once a day. Nearly half of the adolescents 
(43.7 percent) drank sugar-sweetened beverages ≥ once a 
day, and 12.2 percent ate chips and fries ≥ once a day. First- 
and second-generation immigrant adolescents consumed 
healthy foods (fruits, vegetables, and fish) but not dairy 
products, and also unhealthy foods (chips, fries, and sugar-
sweetened  beverages)  significantly  more  often  than  did 
natives. Girls ate fruits and vegetables more often, possibly 
due to taste preferences, health beliefs, and concern about 
weight. A study based on the same cross-national survey of 
adolescents in Brussels found that young immigrants were 
more likely to be overweight than young natives or first-
generation immigrants (OR 1.76). This was also true for 
second-generation immigrants with both parents born abroad 
vs. natives (OR 2.06) and for second-generation immigrants 
with one parent born abroad vs. natives (OR 1.69). This

effect was partially explained by sociodemographic status 
and health-related behaviors [58•].

Disparities in health care utilization were also documented in 
studies of terminally ill older Turkish and Moroccan immi-
grants in the Netherlands [62].

The Netherlands

Disease Disparity Among Ethnic Populations 
in the Netherlands: the HELIUS Study

The  Dutch  conducted  a  study  to  examine  CVD,  mental 
health and infectious diseases across various ethnic groups 
living in Amsterdam in order to uncover the causes of an 
unequal burden of disease. The Healthy Life in an Urban 
Setting (HELIUS) is a prospective cohort study that col-
lected data from 2011 to 2015 on health and health care 
utilization  among  adults  (18  to  70  years)  of  six  similar 
sized  ethnic  groups:  Dutch,  African  Surinamese,  South 
Asian Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish, and Moroccan, liv-
ing in Amsterdam [59]. Data from participants (n = 24,789) 
in HELIUS were collected from questionnaires, physical 
exams, and blood tests. Initial results showed large dispari-
ties among ethnic groups in the prevalence of diabetes and 
chronic kidney disease, depressive symptoms, and early 
markers of disease, including arterial wave reflection. Differ-
ences in traditional risk factors, obesity, and socioeconomic 
status were not sufficient to fully explain these disparities. 
These findings are key for targeting health care and disease 
prevention.

Data based on 12,974 participants in the HELIUS study 
found large differences in the prevalence of hypertension: 
lowest in Moroccan men and women (24 percent and 16 
percent) and highest in Ghanaian men and women (52 per-
cent and 62 percent) [60]. With the exception of Moroc-
can women, age-adjusted prevalence rates of hypertension 
were higher in all ethnic minority groups compared to those 
of Dutch origin. Furthermore, BP control rates in ethnic 
minority groups, particularly among African Surinamese 
and South Asian Surinamese, were poor despite high treat-
ment levels.

Older Immigrants from Turkey, Morocco, Surinam, 
and the Netherlands Antilles

The population of older immigrants in the Netherlands is 
growing. A cross-sectional study based on data collected from 
the 2003 survey Social Position, Health and Well-being of 
Elderly Immigrants found major ethnic disparities in health 
and health care utilization among four first-generation immi-
grant groups, including participants from Turkey, Morocco, 
Surinam, and the Netherlands Antilles compared to Dutch 
natives, aged 55 years and older [61]. Older immigrants had 
greater use of general medical services and lower use of phys-
ical therapy and home care than Dutch natives of similar age. 

Acculturation Strategies in Older Turkish 
Immigrants in the Netherlands

A cross-sectional study among community-dwelling older 
[average 73, range 66 to 95 years] Turkish immigrants resid-
ing in the Netherlands assessed the relationship between 
acculturation strategies (attachment to the Dutch host coun-
try) and broader self-management abilities [63]. The major-
ity (80 percent) had low education levels. Women, single 
individuals, and those with multimorbidity used the separa-
tion strategy more often and experienced lower levels of 
attachment to the Dutch culture. Older Turkish women also 
reported poorer self-management abilities, possibly because 
they had to rely more on relatives and the government. In 
multivariate analyses, multimorbidity negatively affected the 
self-management abilities of older Turkish people living in 
the Netherlands.

Trends in Sweden

Undocumented migrants in Europe are typically in a vulner-
able and marginalized situation, as most have been rejected 
for  asylum  and  protection  from  war  and  persecution.  A 
cross-sectional  study  of  undocumented  adult  migrants 
was conducted in the three largest cities in Sweden [64•]. 
Migrants were screened for psychiatric symptoms (Beck’s 
Depression Inventory II, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory, and 
the PTSD Checklist (PCL) for civilians). Of these, 68 per-
cent suffered from moderate or severe anxiety, 71 percent 
suffered from moderate or severe depression, and 58 per-
cent scored significantly higher for PTSD. The majority 
expressed fear of returning to their country of origin for 
political reasons. While 45 percent of the women and 31 
percent of the men had a university/college degree, more 
than half reported that they were often hungry; 57 percent 
suffered from food insecurity and 56 percent reported long-
standing illness. There was a constant fear of disclosure, 
potentially leading to deportation, and these stressors had 
detrimental effects on mental health.

Depression in Second‑Generation Immigrants 
in Sweden

A study interviewed young adult Swedish citizens born in 
1990 to assess symptoms of depression [65]. Participants 
were divided into three groups according to the country of 
origin of their parents. The groups with either Yugoslav 
or native Swedish parents had similar levels of depressive 

1 3332 

Current Hypertension Reports (2022) 24:325–340

symptoms, while the group with Iranian parentage had a sig-
nificantly higher prevalence of depressive symptoms. Thus, 
the increased tendency for depressive symptoms may be the 
result of concerns about maintaining social status and fear 
of the expected social ramifications of having an occupation 
based on manual labor, leading to ostracism and/or margin-
alization. The variation of results in depression was also 
explained by perceived ethnic identity.

Mental Health and Risk of Psychotic Disorders 
in Second Generation Iraqis in Sweden

Studies have demonstrated that some non-Western immi-
grant groups in Europe have increased risk of psychosis 
compared  to  native-born  people.  A  study  of  1,442,931 
individuals 15 to 60 years of age without prevalent psycho-
pathology who were followed from 2005 to 2010 showed 
that the cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorders was 
greater in Iraqi enclaves than in predominantly Swedish 
neighborhoods [66]. Second-generation Iraqis had higher 
risk of psychotic disorders than first-generation immigrants.

Quality of Life Among Iraqi Women Immigrants 
in Sweden

Poor self-rated health is commonly used to estimate qual-
ity of life and to predict mortality, yet is seldom studied in 
immigrant populations. A cross-sectional population-based 
study conducted from 2010 to 2012 among Iraqi immigrants 
and native Swedes found a significant difference in poor self-
rated health between those born in Iraq (44 percent) and 
native Swedes (22 percent) [67]. The highest prevalence 
(56 percent) of poor self-rated health occurred among Iraqi 
women, and this excess risk could not be fully attributed to 
known risk factors such as socioeconomic status, lifestyle, 
or comorbidity.

Vitamin D Deficiency in Non‑Western Immigrants 
and Refugees

Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in various chronic 
diseases, including CVD and metabolic disorders [68, 69]. 
Severe vitamin D deficiency and rickets are common in 
non-western immigrants and refugees [70, 71]. Vitamin D 
deficiency is often due to low sunshine exposure in host 
countries, while pigmented skin and skin-covering clothing 
style due to cultural or religious habits further decrease the 
potential for cutaneous vitamin D production. This leads 
to a fivefold higher risk of vitamin D deficiency in immi-
grants, which is exacerbated by low calcium intake. A meta-
analysis found an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency 
with longer residence in the host country [72]. Vitamin D 
status was found to be lower in Turkish, Moroccan, Indian, 

and sub-Sahara African populations in Europe than in their 
countries of origin [73]. Consequences of severe vitamin D 
deficiency in immigrants include musculoskeletal pain and 
fatigue. In adolescents and adults, the presenting symptoms 
of clinical vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia are muscle 
weakness and bone pain. The myopathy is often localized to 
the shoulder and pelvic girdle, causing difficulties in stand-
ing up from a sitting position, walking, and stair climbing. 
In case of severe osteomalacia, bone mineral density (BMD) 
can be very low, suggestive of severe osteoporosis. Heal-
ing of nutritional osteomalacia can be achieved with vita-
min D (800–1200 IU) supplementation, while higher doses 
(2000–3000 IU/d) can result in accelerated healing of osteo-
malacia [71]. Prevention of vitamin D deficiency is feasible 
with administration of vitamin D3, 400–800 IU/d depending 
on age. Children < 1 year require 400 IU/d; older children 
and adults require 600 IU/d, while older persons (> 70 year) 
require 800 IU/d. Vitamin D supplementation should begin 
with suspicion of vitamin D deficiency and blood should be 
tested to confirm the diagnosis.

Vitamin D Status in Immigrants from Africa 
and the Middle East

A  cross-sectional  population-based  study  of  the  preva-
lence and determinants of vitamin D deficiency included 
1306 immigrants from Africa and the Middle East living in 
Umeå, Sweden [74, 75]. Twelve percent of these had vita-
min D deficiency (25(OH)D ˂25 nmol/L), which was twice 
as common in African immigrants as in the Middle Eastern 
group. This study found an association between vitamin D 
deficiency and reduced muscle strength. A diet including a 
high intake of fatty fish (> twice a week) helped to prevent 
vitamin D deficiency, while absence of travel abroad from 
Sweden and use of long-sleeved clothing in summer were 
detrimental to vitamin D status. An open, partially rand-
omized controlled trial concluded that oral cholecalciferol 
supplementation was safe and effective in increasing 25(OH)
D in healthy individuals with initial 25(OH)D deficiency 
[76].

Elevated COVID‑19 Risks Among Immigrants

During  the  COVID-19  pandemic  of  the  last  two  years, 
already-marginalized communities, including immigrants 
and racial minorities, suffered disproportionately from the 
impact of the virus. Though the US Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s coronavirus case report form does 

1 3Current Hypertension Reports (2022) 24:325–340 

333

not track nativity and immigration status, information from 
other surveys found that non-citizens were more likely than 
citizens to face economic and other barriers to physical dis-
tancing as well as other factors such as food insecurity that 
has left them more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic 
[77–79].

Hypertension in Mexican Immigrants 
and Mexican‑Americans

Many health care institutions have increased their efforts to 
provide services designed to examine experiences of Mexi-
can immigrants and those of Mexican origin living with 
hypertension in the USA. Rates of hypertension are similar 
in people of Mexican origin and in non-Hispanic whites, 
but rates of BP control are lower in the Mexican immigrants 
and Mexican Americans [80]. Major differences also exist 
between Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans in 
the experience of living with hypertension. Misconceptions 
regarding the causes and treatment of hypertension and 
the prohibitive cost of antihypertensive medications were 
substantially greater issues for Mexican immigrants than 
Mexican-Americans. The authors concluded that, in order 
to improve BP control in Mexican immigrants, information 
about the disorder needs to be available in both English and 
Spanish.

Alcohol and Drug Use Among Young Immigrants 
from Mexico in the USA

Persons  who  immigrated  to  the  USA  from  Mexico  at  a 
young age frequently have had migration-related experiences 
that adversely affected their health later in life. Those who 
migrated before the age of 14 years have been found to have 
more alcohol- and drug-related problems than those who 
migrated at a later age. Migration before the age of 20 years 
was also associated with a higher prevalence of CVD mor-
tality than migration later in life, even after adjusting for age, 
sex, education, income, and baseline CV health. Non-CVD 
deaths did not differ according to age at migration [81].

Violence on the USA‑Mexico Border

A study of the effects of enforced immigration policy and 
militarization in the Arizona border region on permanent 
residents of Mexican descent in 2006–2008 examined their 
experience with everyday violence and the normalization 
of that violence by the immigration enforcement policy 
[82]. The study documented the frequency and nature of 
immigration-related  profiling  and  mistreatment,  as  well 
as resistance to institutionalized victimization. Data were 
taken from a random household sample of US citizens and 
permanent Mexican residents who reported that they were 

living and working in a militarized environment in which 
immigration-related profiling and mistreatment were com-
mon practice among law enforcement officials. A total of 25 
percent of respondents reported a mistreatment event related 
to immigration; 62 percent of these were personally victim-
ized and 75 percent of events took place in a community 
location. The immigration-related mistreatment appeared 
to have been accepted as normal by both law enforcement 
officials and residents. Militarization of immigration policies 
had a detrimental effect on the daily lives of Mexican-born 
US permanent residents and their non-immigrant Mexican 
descendants. These policies enabled institutionalized acts 
of discrimination, such as racial profiling and mistreatment. 
To deal with this, the authors recommended metrics and 
systems for monitoring immigration and border enforcement 
policies and for establishing programs for eliminating insti-
tutional practices deleterious to the health of US citizens 
and residents.

Blood Pressure‑Related CVD Mortality Among 
Non‑immigrant Mexicans in Mexico

While immigration clearly plays a part in increasing risk fac-
tors for disease, the effects of globalization as a contributing 
factor cannot be overlooked. This is evident in research pub-
lished in 2014 showing that in the Mexican adult population 
aged 50 + years, 32 percent had systolic hypertension and 47 
percent had systolic prehypertension [83]. In this popula-
tion, 48 percent of all CVD-related deaths were attributed 
to high systolic BP. Hypertension accounted for the highest 
rate (83 percent) of CVD-related death; of these, 67 percent 
were among patients over 70 years of age. In 16.5 percent 
of CVD-related death, patients had systolic prehyperten-
sion. Additionally, one-third of adult Mexicans had either 
untreated or uncontrolled systolic hypertension, and there 
was a significantly higher prevalence of systolic hyperten-
sion in women.

Cross‑Border Health Care Usage by Mexican 
Immigrants in the USA

Recent research has found that hundreds of thousands of 
Mexican immigrants in the USA return to Mexico annually 
to seek health care there [84]. For many, this is motivated by 
barriers to access to health care in the USA, such as a lack of 
health insurance, language barriers, or the high cost of US 
health care. However, some are not using care in Mexico 
as a replacement for care in the USA, but as a supplement 
to it. Raudenbush found that the reasons behind utilizing 
health care in both countries included factors such as dis-
satisfaction with treatment of medical issues in the USA, less 
personal interactions with doctors in Mexico, refusal of US 
doctors to refer cases to specialists, costs of procedures in 

1 3334 

Current Hypertension Reports (2022) 24:325–340

both countries, and the lower cost of some pharmaceuticals 
in Mexico. Whether these immigrants return to Mexico for 
all of their health care needs or merely some of them, the 
existence of this practice speaks to the failure of the US 
health care system to provide for all of its residents’ needs.

Results of this study suggest a high prevalence of CVD risk 
factors in Ethiopian American adults and indicate the need 
for comprehensive, systematic assessment of their health 
needs with regard to chronic disease prevention.

Obesity Among Philippine Immigrants in the USA

Overweight and Obesity Among Asian Men 
in the USA

A study based on data from the 2002 to 2015 National Health 
Review Survey used relevance ratios to determine the corre-
lation of overweight, obesity, and ethnicity in Non-Hispanic 
white men (n = 199,767) and Asian men (n = 21,609) in the 
USA [85]. The Asian ethnic subgroups included Chinese 
(n = 4,473, 2%), Filipino (n = 4,293), Asian Indian (n = 4,819), 
and Other Asian (n = 8,024). Asian men, when compared to 
Non-Hispanic white men, had a higher prevalence of over-
weight, while Filipinos had a higher prevalence of obesity. 
Thus, Asian men are at higher risk for the metabolic syndrome 
then their Non-Hispanic white counterparts.

Metabolic Syndrome Among Immigrants in the USA

An analysis of data from the 2010–2016 National Health 
Interview Survey (USA) that included 41,717 immigrants 
with a mean age of 46.5 years examined the prevalence of 
CVD risk factors (hypertension, obesity, and diabetes) in 
a diverse population of immigrants, including those from 
Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, Central America, 
and the Caribbean [86]. The highest prevalence of diag-
nosed hypertension was in immigrants from Russia and 
Southeast Asia. Female European immigrants reported a 
higher prevalence of diagnosed hypertension then female 
Asians. Immigrants from Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, 
Central America, and the Caribbean had a higher prevalence 
of hypertension compared with European immigrants, while 
those from South America had a lower prevalence. Female 
Asian immigrants reported hypertension diagnosis at lower 
rates than did female European immigrants, and male Rus-
sian immigrants had higher prevalence of hypertension than 
male European immigrants.

Hypertension Among Ethiopian Immigrants 
in the USA

A community-based, cross-sectional, nonrandomized study 
carried out in Minnesota in 2007–2012 assessed the preva-
lence of hypertension in adult Ethiopian immigrants who 
were participants in a parish nursing CVD risk factor screen-
ing program [87]. BP was in the normal range in only 31.6 
percent of participants and was significantly higher in men 
than in women. Women had significantly higher levels of 
total and LDL cholesterol and blood glucose than men. 

The Health of Philippine Emigrants Study (HoPES) investi-
gated factors underlying the rise in obesity among Philippine 
emigrants to the USA [88]. The study found that immigrants 
to the USA tended to be healthier upon arrival than their 
native-born counterparts, but that their health deteriorated 
with time. Additional analyses of the HoPES data suggest 
that pre-acculturation (the process by which one becomes 
familiar with the culture of a country before moving to it) 
may be a risk factor for obesity in Philippine migrants to the 
USA [89]. Pre-acculturation was associated with increases in 
BMI, waist circumference, and waist to height ratio.

Quality of Life in Nonwhite Residents or Immigrants 
in the USA

The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) assessed 
perception of discrimination in health care, its association 
with worse quality of life and mental health outcomes and 
poorer physical health, and whether it was associated with 
racial and ethnic health disparities among California resi-
dents from 2003–2017 [90]. Analyses of CHIS data from 
2003 and 2005 found that participants who reported non-
white race ethnicity, were immigrants, or had limited Eng-
lish proficiency were more likely to report discrimination in 
health care. The question on discrimination in health care 
was removed from the survey after 2005, and then reintro-
duced in 2015. Over the intervening 10 years, California’s 
health  care  community  and  legislature  made  concerted 
efforts to address health care disparities. It was proposed that 
that perception of discrimination in health care decreased 
over time overall and for all subgroups of the population. To 
determine whether perceptions of discrimination in health 
care had indeed changed over time in California, the cross-
sectional study combined CHIS data sets from 2003 to 2005 
and from 2015 to 2017. While overall perceptions of dis-
crimination showed a slight decrease (from 6 to 4%), there 
was no significant statistical difference in the proportion of 
immigrants.

Another growing trend of immigration to developed 
countries is late-life immigration by seniors to be reu-
nited with their families. A study used the World Health 
Organization’s  Quality  of  Life  instrument  short  form 
(WHOQOL-BREF)  combined  with  other  psychosocial 
measures to examine the quality of life (QoL) of Asian 
Indian seniors who immigrated to reunite with their adult 
children in the USA [91]. The scores on overall QoL and 

1 3Current Hypertension Reports (2022) 24:325–340 

335

QoL domains (physical and psychological health, social 
relationships, and environment) were similar to established 
norms in non-immigrant populations.

Chinese Immigrants in Canada

Individuals of Chinese origin make up the largest (27.5 
percent) visible minority population in Canada. There is 
a notable lack of awareness of heart disease and stroke 
among Chinese-Canadians, and data suggest that they have 
a relatively low or even total lack of awareness of warn-
ing symptoms for common CV emergency situations. A 
study of elderly Chinese-Canadians with hypertension who 
participated in the intervention group of the DASHNa-CC 
study assessed factors that influenced their adherence to 
the dietary training in the study [92, 93]. While the train-
ing succeeded in conveying nutritional information, other 
factors influenced the eating habits of these immigrants, 
including their belief in traditional Chinese medicine and 
their visits to Chinese medicine practitioners. Traditional 
Chinese medicine is based on belief in a need for balance 
between Yin and Yang as well as the balance between hot 
and cold in the body, which is facilitated by diet. There-
fore, the Chinese medicine practitioner is considered an 
authority for dietary advice [92].

A study in first generation Chinese immigrants living 
in four urban centers across Canada (Vancouver, Toronto, 
Halifax, and St Catherine’s) found that most immigrants 
preferred the Chinese diet, while availability of food was 
determined by local markets [94]. Few participants pre-
ferred making friends with mainstream Caucasian Cana-
dians. The authors concluded that health interventions, 
including diet and lifestyle education for this population, 
should be communicated in Chinese languages and via 
channels this population is already using. This conclusion 
is congruent with similar findings and recommendations 
for first-generation migrant populations in the USA. A 
study that used Leininger’s Sunrise Model of culture care 
theory to examine Chinese Canadians’ high prevalence of 
hypertension determined it to be a result of the traditional 
Chinese diet, which is high in sodium and low in potas-
sium, in combination with the tendency of the Canadian 
diet to be low in calcium [95].

Infectious Disease

Many host countries put strict measures into place to prevent 
migrants with infectious diseases from entering. However, 
infections, such as hepatitis C, tuberculosis, and HIV, are 
common in migrants and refugees [96–98].

Hepatitis C Virus Infection

Studies on the epidemiology and management of hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infections have shown a worldwide prevalence 
of 0.5 to 6.5 percent, with wide variation from region to 
region: 0.5 to 1.5 percent in Western countries, Australia, 
and India; 2.3 percent in Southeast Asia and Eastern Medi-
terranean; 3.2 percent in China; 6.5 percent in Pakistan; and 
4 to 9 percent in sub-Saharan Africa [99, 100••, 101]. The 
risk of HCV infection in immigrant populations is less clear. 
Coppola et al. concluded that immigrants are more likely to 
have an increased risk due to HCV exposure in their coun-
tries of origin, assuming that immigrants and refugees from 
intermediate/high HCV endemic countries move to less- or 
non-endemic areas [100••]. An alternate view is that we 
should examine how the prevalence in the migrant popu-
lations reflects the prevalence in their countries of origin 
[101]. Much can be learned from the report on chronic HCV 
infection in undocumented immigrants and low-income refu-
gees in Italy [102]. The majority of those offered testing 
agreed to be tested, suggesting that the environment was 
welcoming and adequate pre-test counseling was provided, a 
key factor that must be considered when developing similar 
programs. Following diagnosis, the reality in most parts of 
the world is that major barriers persist in accessing optimal 
HCV treatment [103, 104]. Cost remains a major barrier, and 
other concerns include access to providers. Future efforts 
should focus on screening programs that reach out into the 
community with the help of cultural mediators to identify 
immigrants living with HCV and offer them ongoing care 
and support.

Tuberculosis Infection

Immigrants with hypertension, overweight, obesity, or dia-
betes may be at increased risk for communicable diseases 
such as tuberculosis (TB). More than 50% of non-US born 
persons diagnosed with TB had migrated from five coun-
tries: Mexico, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, and China. 
Nationwide, statistics from 2010–2014 showed that 65 per-
cent of all patients with TB in Hawaii were immigrants, as 
were 81 percent of those in the Philippines [105]. Between 
1995 and 2012, the relationship between immigration and 
TB was explored in the Netherlands to determine if immigra-
tion can be a predictor for TB in immigrants from countries 
of origin with high incidences of TB, including Morocco, 
Somalia,  and  Turkey  [106].  A  17-month  lag  was  found 
between Somali immigration and the emergence of Somali 
immigrant TB cases, but no time lag was seen for Moroc-
can or Turkish immigrants. The authors concluded that the 
absence of a time lag may have been due to the relatively 
low prevalence of TB in their countries of origin, combined 
with increased likelihood of reactivation TB in an aging 

1 3336 

Current Hypertension Reports (2022) 24:325–340

immigrant population. Understanding the time lag between 
Somali immigration and occurrence of TB disease would 
benefit from a closer epidemiological analysis of cohorts of 
Somali cases diagnosed within the first years after entry. A 
study based on sentinel surveillance data on migrant trave-
lers to Canada from Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, 
South Central Asia, the Philippines, China, and Vietnam, 
collected through the CanTravNet website, concluded that, 
compared with non-migrant travelers, migrants were more 
likely to present with a communicable infectious disease, 
such as TB, potentially complicated by an underlying immu-
nosuppressive condition such as HIV [107•].

Conclusions

A comprehensive understanding of the effects of migra-
tion on health must take into account the heterogeneity of 
immigrants, due predominately to their countries of origin 
and different behaviors relating to their cultural, ethnic, and 
religious backgrounds, as well as to their socioeconomic sta-
tus and education. Previous analyses found that the overall 
well-being of immigrant groups is likely to improve despite 
an increased risk of hypertension and weight gain. Migrants 
and refugees are at increased risk of both non-communicable 
diseases (hypertension, CVD, obesity, diabetes, and the meta-
bolic syndrome) and communicable diseases. For example, 
there have been outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis among 
Syrian refugees in Arab host countries and a re-emergence of 
TB among migrants to Europe and North America. Vaccine-
preventable diseases, including measles, are also prevalent. 
Refugees are often not up to date on routine immunizations. 
In addition, many immigrants have stress- and trauma-related 
mental health problems due to continued violence and gender 
victimization, which are often not addressed by the health 
care systems where they reside. Determining the health care 
needs of specific immigrant groups should lead to the estab-
lishment of evidence-based guidelines for providing screen-
ing and health care services to immigrant populations for 
the benefit of the individuals concerned, as well as the host 
countries. Health screening of refugees after resettlement is 
now conducted according to varying local policies, and there 
are vast differences in which health conditions are covered in 
the screening and for whom screening is available.

Overcoming barriers to controlling disease in immigrants 
requires culturally appropriate health care that includes writ-
ten and oral information in the migrants’ native language 
about the host country’s healthcare system and their right 
to its utilization. This is needed to establish among refugees 
and immigrants a positive experience with healthcare in the 
host country that will lead to future successful implementa-
tion of preventative and treatment interventions, including 
dietary and lifestyle change for control of BP and diabetes. 

Further studies are needed to explore the factors, including 
the environment, continuous psychological stress, possible 
epigenetic markers, and other patterns that increase the sus-
ceptibility of second- and third-generation populations of 
immigrant origin to the development of hypertension, CVD, 
diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome, all of which contrib-
ute to the global burden of chronic disease.

study found a high rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 
in immigrants who move from high to lower HCV endemic 
countries and concluded that health screening and treatment 
programs for immigrants are needed to prevent the ultimate 
development of cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carci-
noma in immigrants from countries with high HCV infection 
rates.

tay117. The CanTravNet site has established a detailed epide-
miologic framework of the immigrant population of Canada 
for the use of Canadian medical practitioners. A major find-
ing of this study was that migrants were more likely than 
non-migrant travelers to have a pre-existing immunocom-
promising medical condition such as HIV or diabetes and 
therefore are in need of increased healthcare services.
