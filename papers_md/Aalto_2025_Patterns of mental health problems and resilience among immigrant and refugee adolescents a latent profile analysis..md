ABSTRACT
Background:  Immigrant  and  refugee  adolescents  often  face  traumatic  experiences  and  are 
vulnerable  to  mental  health  problems,  such  as  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  anxiety 
and  depression.  Yet,  they  also  show  remarkable  resilience  in  the  face  of  these  stressors. 
Research  is  still  scarce  on  how  both  mental  health  problems  and  resilience  dynamically 
interplay in immigrant and refugee adolescents’ development.
Objective:  We  aimed  to  identify  latent  profiles  of  immigrant  and  refugee  adolescents’ 
wellbeing,  consisting  of  externalizing  and  internalizing  symptoms,  PTSD  (intrusion  and 
avoidance),  and  resilience,  and  analyse  the  demographic  and  contextual  determinants  of 
these profiles.
Method:  We  employed  cross-sectional  survey  data  from  the  RefugeesWellSchool  project  for 
1607  immigrant  and  refugee  adolescents  (mean  age  15.3  years,  SD  2.15,  42.3%  girls)  from 
six  European  countries:  Belgium,  Denmark,  Finland,  Norway,  Sweden,  and  the  United 
Kingdom.  Latent  profile  analysis  and  three-step  procedure  with  BCH  weights  were  used  to 
identify the wellbeing profiles and their determinants.
Results:  Results  identified  four  adolescent  wellbeing  profiles:  (1)  Low  symptoms  (49.7%,  n =  
791);  (2) High symptoms with intrusion  (10.6%,  n = 169); (3) Moderate  symptoms  (26.9%, n =  
428);  and  (4)  Resilient  avoidant  (12.8%,  n = 203).  Older  participants,  those  with  refugee 
background,  shorter  residence  in  the  host  country,  more  experiences  of  daily  stressors  or 
discrimination,  or  low  family  support  were  less  likely  to  belong  to  the  Low  symptoms  or 
Resilient avoidant groups (p ≤ .001).
Conclusions:  The  profiles  reflected  distinct  differentiation  of  intrusive  and  avoidance 
dimensions  of  the  PTSD-symptoms.  Intrusion  clustered  with  high  level  of  other  mental 
health  problems, whereas avoidance  co-occurred with high resilience. Experiences related  to 
immigration, stressors, and family support were crucial determinants of the wellbeing profile 
membership.  Future  interventions  should  utilize  information  obtained  by  person-centered 
studies to create better targeted and tailored support for immigrant and refugee adolescents.

Patrones de problemas de salud mental y resiliencia entre adolescentes 
inmigrantes y refugiados: un análisis de perfil latente  

Antecedentes:  Los  adolescentes  inmigrantes  y  refugiados  a  menudo  enfrentan  experiencias 
traumáticas  y  son  vulnerables  a  problemas  de  salud  mental,  como  el  trastorno  de  estrés 
postraumático  (TEPT),  la  ansiedad  y  la  depresión.  Sin  embargo,  también  muestran  una 
resiliencia  notable  frente  a  estos  factores  estresantes.  La  investigación  aún  es  escasa  sobre 
cómo  los  problemas  de  salud  mental  y  la  resiliencia  interactúan  dinámicamente  en  el 
desarrollo de los adolescentes inmigrantes y refugiados.
Objetivo:  Nos  propusimos  identificar  perfiles  latentes  del  bienestar  de  los  adolescentes 
inmigrantes  y  refugiados,  que  consisten  en  síntomas  externalizantes  e  internalizantes,  TEPT 
(intrusión  y  evitación)  y  resiliencia,  y  analizar  los  determinantes  demográficos  y  contextuales 
de estos perfiles.
Método: Utilizamos datos de una encuesta transversal del proyecto RefugeesWellSchool para 
1.607 adolescentes inmigrantes y refugiados (edad media 15.3 años, DE 2.15, 42.3% niñas) de

HIGHLIGHTS
•  Mental  health  symptoms 
and  resilience  were not 
mutually  exclusive  in 
immigrant  and  refugee 
adolescents’  wellbeing, 
highlighting  that  they  are 
two  separate  continua.
•  Intrusive  and  avoidance 
symptoms  of  the  PTSD 
showed  distinct 
differentiation  in 
adolescent wellbeing, with 
intrusion  being  prevalent 
with  other  mental health 
symptoms  and  avoidance 
with  high  resilience.

•  Refugee background, older 
age,  and experiences  of 
discrimination,  daily 
stressors  and low  familial 
support  were  related  to 
belonging  in  profiles with 
high  mental health 
symptoms.

seis países europeos: Bélgica, Dinamarca, Finlandia, Noruega, Suecia y Reino Unido. Se utilizó 
un  análisis  de  perfil  latente  y  un  procedimiento  de  tres  pasos  con  ponderaciones  BCH  para 
identificar los perfiles de bienestar y sus determinantes.
Resultados: Los resultados identificaron cuatro perfiles de bienestar adolescente: (1) síntomas 
bajos  (49.7  %,  n  =  791);  2)  síntomas  altos  con  intrusión  (10.6  %,  n  =  169);  (3)  síntomas 
moderados  (26.9  %,  n  =  428);  y  4)  resiliente  evitativo  (12.8  %,  n  =  203).  Los  participantes  de 
mayor  edad,  aquellos  con  antecedentes  de  refugiados,  con  una  residencia  más  corta  en  el 
país  de  acogida,  con  más  experiencias  de  factores  estresantes  diarios  o  discriminación,  o 
con  un  bajo  apoyo  familiar  tenían  menos  probabilidades  de  pertenecer  a  los  grupos  de 
resiliente evitativo o con síntomas bajos (p  ≤ .001).
Conclusiones: Los perfiles reflejaban una diferenciación clara de las dimensiones intrusivas y 
de  evitación  de  los  síntomas  de  TEPT.  La  intrusión  se  agrupó  con  un  alto  nivel  de  otros 
problemas de salud mental, mientras que la evitación se presentó simultáneamente con una 
alta  resiliencia.  Las  experiencias  relacionadas  con  la  inmigración,  los  factores  estresantes  y  el 
apoyo  familiar  fueron  determinantes  cruciales  de  la  pertenencia  al  perfil  de  bienestar.  Las 
intervenciones futuras deberían utilizar la información obtenida por estudios centrados en la 
persona  para  crear  un  apoyo  mejor  dirigido  y  personalizado  para 
los  adolescentes 
inmigrantes y refugiados.

1.  Introduction

In addition to the normative developmental challenges 
that take place in adolescence, young people with immi-
grant or refugee backgrounds often need to renegotiate 
their ethnic identities, manage migration-related stres-
sors,  and  possibly  also  cope  with  discrimination  in  a 
new host society (Marley & Mauki, 2019). These stres-
sors have been consistently linked with adverse mental 
health outcomes like anxiety, depression, and post-trau-
matic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  (Belhadj  Kouider  et  al., 
2014; Spaas et al., 2021). In addition, many young refu-
gees have been exposed to traumatic events such as loss, 
threats to life, and war atrocities, which further height-
ens  their  vulnerability  to  mental  health  problems 
(Fazel  et  al.,  2012).  However,  research  also  highlights 
the remarkable resilience of these adolescents in coping 
with  immigration  stress  and  displacement,  and  effec-
tively  managing  traumatic  experiences  (Marley  & 
Mauki,  2019).  Despite  this,  there  is  a  lack  of  research 
on the interplay of resilience and mental health symp-
toms among immigrant and refugee youth, particularly 
involving the role of PTSD symptoms of intrusion and 
avoidance (Andersson et al., 2024). This study aims to 
fill this gap by exploring the distinct subgroups of immi-
grant and refugee adolescents based on their wellbeing, 
consisting of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, 
PTSD intrusion and avoidance, and resilience. The study 
further  examines  the  differences  across  the  identified 
subgroups  in  demographic  and  contextual  factors, 
including age, gender, migration status, length of stay, 
daily material stress, discrimination, and social support.

1.1.  Wellbeing  profiles  reflecting  both 
symptoms  and  resilience

A person’s wellbeing can be regarded as composing of 
two  distinct,  yet  related  continuums  that  depict  both 
mental  health  vulnerabilities  and  resources  (Moore 

et  al.,  2019).  Research  on  adolescents  with  immigrant 
and  refugee  background  has  been  largely  variable- 
centred,  focusing  on  the  vulnerabilities  by  showing 
high  prevalence  of  mental  health  problems  such  as 
PTSD  (23%),  anxiety  (16%)  and  depression  (14%) 
(Blackmore  et  al.,  2020),  with  potentially  comorbid 
overlapping  symptomatology  (Fazel  et  al.,  2012;  Huk-
kelberg  &  Jensen,  2011;  Thabet  et  al.,  2004).  Some 
studies have, however, also acknowledged the resources 
by identifying resilience, the process involving biologi-
cal,  psychological,  social,  and  ecological  factors  that 
help  individuals  regain  or  maintain  wellbeing,  to  pro-
tect  against  or  associate  with  less  mental  health  pro-
blems  and  PTSD  symptoms  (Masten  et  al.,  2021; 
Ungar  &  Theron,  2020;  Veronese  et  al.,  2021;  Wu 
et  al.,  2018).  A  person-centred  approach,  identifying 
subpopulations  of  the  heterogenous  group  of  immi-
grant  and  refugee  youth  based  on  their  wellbeing  can 
offer insightful ways to capture the dynamics of mental 
health  symptoms  and  resilience  that  can  enable  pro-
fessionals  to  tailor  targeted  and  differentiated  support 
(Andersson et al., 2024; Howard & Hoffman, 2017).

Research  concerning  latent  profiles  of  youth  with 
immigrant  or  refugee  background  including  both 
mental health symptoms and resilience is largely lack-
ing, as outlined in the review concerning refugee chil-
dren  and  young  adults  by  Andersson  et  al.  (2024). 
Among immigrant background and native youth, Kas-
sis  et  al.  (2021)  identified  three  wellbeing  profiles 
based  on  mental  health  problems  (depression  and 
anxiety)  and  psychosocial  resources  (e.g.  satisfaction 
in  life  and  school  grades,  self-efficacy,  and  self- 
esteem), representing high, middle, and low wellbeing 
among  both  immigrant  and  native  youth.  The  high 
wellbeing  profile  was  characterized  by  low  levels  of 
mental  health  symptoms  and  high  resources;  middle 
wellbeing  profile  by  average  levels  of  both,  and  low 
wellbeing  by  high  mental  health  symptoms  and  low 
to  average  levels  of  resources,  representing  therefore 

mainly  quantitative  rather  than  nuanced  qualitative 
differences  between  the  profiles.  However,  studies 
examining  similar  wellbeing  profiles  among  general 
adolescent  samples  have  found  mainly  four  profiles 
with  similar  profiles  of  high,  medium  and  low  well-
being, but also a profile with high levels of both mental 
health symptoms and resources (Janousch et al., 2022; 
Moore et al., 2019).

Other  related  latent  profile  studies  among  refugee 
adolescents have found also distinct groups of individ-
uals based on their self-regulation skills and emotional 
well-being  (Aber  et  al.,  2024),  or  trauma  exposure, 
mental health and post-traumatic growth (PTG; a con-
cept  close  to  resilience)  (Ryu  et  al.,  2024).  Interest-
ingly,  the  two  groups  having  experienced  the  most 
traumatic  events  were  considerably  different:  the 
other was termed ‘High growth class’ with the highest 
PTG  and  low  depression  and  social  withdrawal, 
whereas  the  ‘High  trauma  with  high  comorbidity’ 
group had low PTG, high depression and social with-
drawal  (Ryu  et  al.,  2024).  In  line  with  a  large  meta- 
analysis by Alisic et al. (2014), it is not the traumatic 
events  per  se  that  lead  to  psychopathology.  Instead, 
there  are  other  important  trauma  –  as  well  as  resili-
ence-related  factors  such  as  family  support  and  per-
sonal  characteristics  that  may  be  crucial  in  the 
interplay  of  symptom  and  resilience  manifestation. 
To sum, the few studies available suggest that mental 
health symptoms and resources may show both inver-
sely related patterns but also more nuanced clustering 
within individuals. Considering immigrants and refu-
gees, many of whom have been exposed to traumatic 
events, it would important to study also PTSD symp-
toms in the context of other mental health symptoms 
due to their frequent comorbidity (Hukkelberg & Jen-
sen, 2011). However, current research lacks the under-
standing of PTSD symptoms in the interplay of mental 
health  and  resilience  and  more  research  is  needed  to 
account  for  the  potentially  varying  migration  experi-
ences of immigrants and refugees.

1.2.  Determinants  of  profile  membership

Demographic and contextual factors potentially affect 
immigrant and refugee adolescents’ mental health and 
resilience,  contributing  to  unique  wellbeing  profiles 
(Bajo Marcos et al., 2021). However, research is largely 
lacking on the role of these factors in profile member-
ship.  Mental  health  problems  often  tend  to  increase 
during  adolescence,  but  the  developmental  timing 
and  amount  of  adversities  may  play  a  crucial  role  in 
defining  the  pathway  to  either  resilient  or  sympto-
matic  outcomes  (Masten  &  Barnes,  2018;  Spaas 
et  al.,  2021).  However,  over  time  spent  in  the  new 
home  country,  the  mental  health  of  both  immigrant 
and  refugee  youth  generally  tends  to  improve  (Fazel 
et  al.,  2012).  Many  studies  have  also  shown  gender

differences  with  PTSD  and  internalizing  symptoms 
being  more  prevalent  among  immigrant  and  refugee 
girls,  and  externalizing  problems  more  common 
among  boys  (Belhadj  Kouider  et  al.,  2014;  Dyregrov 
& Yule, 2005; Fazel et al., 2012).

Although research has demonstrated the more fre-
quent  exposure  of  refugee  youth  to  traumatic  events 
compared to immigrant or native youth, and the sub-
sequent  heightened  vulnerability  to  mental  health 
symptoms  (Betancourt  et  al.,  2017),  also  immigrant 
youth  are  often  exposed  to  several  migration-related 
stressors,  exacerbating  their  wellbeing  (Fazel  et  al., 
2012; Spaas et al., 2021). Discrimination is consistently 
linked  to  increased  internalizing  and  externalizing 
symptoms  and  lower  self-esteem,  while  poverty  and 
low economic opportunities are found major risk fac-
tors for mental health throughout the lifespan (Benner 
et al., 2018; Hynie, 2018). On the positive side, ample 
evidence shows social support from family and friends 
to decrease immigrant and refugee adolescents’ men-
tal  health  problems  and  increase  resilience  (Fazel 
et  al.,  2012;  Masten  et  al.,  2021).  The  current  study, 
therefore, aims to analyse these demographic and con-
textual factors as determinants of wellbeing profiles.

1.3.  Aims  of  the  study

and 

arise 

among 

immigrant 

This  study  examines  wellbeing  profiles  and  their 
determinants.  The  first  objective  is  to  explore  what 
kind of distinct wellbeing profiles of both vulnerabil-
ities  (mental  health  symptoms)  and  resources  (resili-
ence) 
refugee 
adolescents  across  multiple  countries.  Using  latent 
profile analysis, we classify adolescents into subgroups 
based on mental health indicators of externalizing and 
internalizing  symptoms,  PTSD  intrusion  and  avoid-
ance, and resilience. The second objective is to explore 
how demographic and contextual factors (age, gender, 
migration status, time in host country, discrimination, 
daily  material  stress,  and  social  support  from  family 
and  friends)  associate  with  these  profiles.  Given  the 
sparsity of prior research, we approach both analyses 
exploratorily without predefined hypotheses.

2. Method

2.1.  Study  setting  and  participants

This  cross-sectional  study  was  part  of  the  Refugees-
WellSchool project evaluating school-based psychoso-
cial  interventions  for  immigrant  and  refugee  youth 
(RefugeesWellSchool, 2021). The study was conducted 
across  six  European  countries:  Belgium,  Denmark, 
Finland,  Norway,  Sweden,  and  the  United  Kingdom. 
Ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  national  ethics 
committees in all participating countries, except Den-
mark, where formal approval is not required; however, 

4

the study was registered with the Danish Data Protec-
tion  Agency.  Additionally,  ethical  statement  was 
received  from  Ghent  University  Ethical  Board,  Bel-
gium  (the  coordinating  institute)  and  was  approved 
by  the  Horizon  2020  Ethical  Review.  Schools  were 
recruited  between  January  2018  and  October  2019. 
Recruitment  methods  varied  by  country,  using 
municipal and national education departments in Bel-
gium,  Denmark,  and  Norway,  and  direct  contact  in 
Finland,  Sweden,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  Schools 
with significant proportions of immigrant and refugee 
students  were  targeted.  A  total  of  1607  adolescents 
answered  the  survey.  All  participants  were  born 
abroad  and  were  distributed  across  86  schools  (Bel-
gium n = 10; Denmark n = 28; Finland n = 16; Norway 
n = 21; Sweden n = 9; United Kingdom n = 2). Partici-
pation  was  voluntary  and  the  adolescent  participants 
information  and  consent 
were  provided  written 
forms  in  their  mother  tongue.  Parental  consent  was 
not  asked,  because  the  majority  of  participants  were 
over  15  years  of  age.  However,  the  parents  or  guar-
dians of all participants were provided with an infor-
mation  letter  about  the  research  and  for  those 
participants  under  15,  the  passive  parental  consent 
was applied. Participants were informed of confidenti-
ality and the possibility to withdraw at any time with-
out consequences.

2.2.  Procedure

LimeSurvey 

Data  collection  occurred  between  January  2019  and 
September  2020.  The  questionnaire  was  translated 
and back-translated into 22 languages, but when there 
were  already  validated  translations  of  existing  scales, 
they  were  used  instead  of  new  translations.  The  ques-
tionnaire was completed independently by each partici-
pant  either  on  paper  (Belgium,  Denmark,  United 
Kingdom) or electronically (Finland, Norway, Sweden) 
(https://www.limesurvey.org/) 
using 
during  a  60-minute  school  lesson.  The  research  team 
and teachers provided practical help for the participants 
if  needed.  For  the  participants  with  limited  literacy 
skills,  assistance of  qualified interpreters  was provided 
in  Belgium,  Norway  and  Sweden.  At  the  beginning  of 
the  questionnaire,  participants  provided  demographic 
data,  including  age  and  gender  (male,  female,  other). 
Due  to  the  small  number  of  youth  reporting  gender 
as  ‘other’  (n = 7),  their  gender  was  treated  as  missing 
in the analyses. Migration status was coded as ‘refugee’ 
or 
‘immigrant’  and  determined  primarily  on  the 
reported motive for migration (e.g. ‘fleeing war or per-
secution’  for  refugees,  versus  ‘my  parents  came  for 
work’ for immigrants). When the motive did not clearly 
categorize the participant (e.g. ‘family reunification,’ or 
missing  data),  classification  was  based  on  country  of 
origin.  Drawing  from  combined  information  from 
Eurostat  of  the  most  prevalent  countries  of  origin  of 

refugees,  and  reports 
from  UNHRC  describing 
countries’ political situations and risks for war or perse-
cution,  the  participants  whose  country  of  origin  was 
Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Eritrea, State of Pales-
tine,  Kurdistan,  or  Yemen  were  classified  as  refugees. 
For  participants  with  other  countries  of  origin,  the 
information  was  left  missing.  Asylum-seeking  partici-
pants and unaccompanied minors were categorized as 
refugees.  Participants  also  reported  the  length  of  time 
they had resided in the host country. The information 
on  the  demographic  characteristics  of  the  sample  by 
country  is  described  in  Appendix  1.  After  demo-
graphics, the participants answered the scales in the fol-
lowing  order:  PTSD  symptoms,  daily  material  stress, 
internalizing  and  externalizing  symptoms,  resilience, 
social support, and discrimination. The total question-
naire included yet two scales but these were not used in 
the current study.

2.3.  Measures

The construct validity of the multi-item measures for 
adolescents’  profile 
indicators  (internalizing  and 
externalizing  symptoms,  PTSD-intrusion,  PTSD- 
avoidance,  and  resilience)  and  profile  determinants 
(discrimination,  daily  stress,  and  social  support)  was 
first  evaluated  using  confirmatory  factor  analysis 
(CFA). The analyses are described in detail in Appen-
dix 2, and the final scales and their reliabilities (McDo-
nald’s  omega)  are  depicted  below.  Composite  mean 
scores were calculated for all scales or subscales.

Internalizing  and  externalizing  symptoms  were 
assessed  with  the  Strengths  and  difficulties  question-
naire  (SDQ)  (Goodman  et  al.,  1998).  Participants 
rated  on  a  three-point  scale  (0 = Not  true,  1 = Some-
what  true,  2 = Certainly  true)  how  well  statements 
like ‘I worry a lot’ or ‘I get very angry and often lose 
my temper’ described them. The reliability for intern-
alization  was  Ω = .69  and  for  externalization  Ω = .63 
with higher scores representing more symptoms.

PTSD  symptoms  were  measured  using  the  8-item 
Children’s  Revised  Impact  of  Event  Scale  (CRIES-8) 
(Dyregrov  et  al.,  1996)  as  recommended  by  an  inter-
national  consortium  of  experts  (Krause  et  al.,  2021). 
The  scale  has  two  subscales:  intrusion  and  avoidance, 
each  with  four  items.  Participants  rated  on  a  four- 
point  scale  (Not  at  all = 0,  Rarely = 1,  Sometimes = 3, 
Often = 5)  how  often  they  experienced 
intrusive 
thoughts (‘Do pictures about it  pop into your mind?’) 
and  avoidance  behaviours  (‘Do  you  try  not  to  think 
about  it?’).  As  CFA  did  not  support  the  use  of  the 
total scale for PTSD symptom mean scores (see Appen-
dix  2  for  further  information),  the  composite  mean 
scores  for  the  two  subscales  were  calculated  and  used 
in  the following  analyses separately.  The  reliability for 
intrusion  was  Ω = .83  and  for  avoidance  Ω = .81  with 
higher scores representing more symptoms.

Resilience was measured using the unidimensional 
12-item Child and Youth Resilience measure (CYRM- 
12)  (Liebenberg  et  al.,  2013).  Participants  rated  on  a 
five-point  scale  (1 = Not  at  all,  2 = A  little,  3 = Some-
what,  4 = Quite  a  bit,  5 = A  lot)  how  well  statements 
like ‘Do you feel you fit in with other peers?’ described 
them.  The  reliability  of  the  scale  was  Ω = .75  with 
higher scores representing more resilience.

Daily material stress due to lack of sufficient nutri-
tion, clothing, money, healthcare, and general feeling 
of  security  was  measured  using  six  items  from  the 
unpublished Daily Stressors Scale for Young Refugees 
(DSSYR) by Vervliet et al. Participants rated on a four- 
point  scale  (1 = Never,  2 = Sometimes,  3 = Often,  4 =  
Always)  how  often  they  lacked  resources  like  ‘an  ok 
place to live’ or ‘enough medical care.’ The reliability 
of  the  unidimensional  scale  was  Ω = .85,  with  higher 
scores representing more resources, ie. less daily stress.
Discrimination  was  measured  using  eight  items  of 
the  discrimination  at  school  and  stigmatization/disva-
luation subscales from the Brief Perceived Ethnic Dis-
crimination  Questionnaire  (PEDQ)  (Brondolo  et  al., 
2005).  Participants  rated  on  a  four-point  scale  (1 =  
Never,  2 = Sometimes,  3 = Often,  4 = Always)  how 
often  they  experienced  discrimination,  such  as  ‘Have 
you been treated unfairly by classmates?’ The reliability 
for  the  total  unidimensional  scale  was  Ω = .77,  with 
higher scores representing more discrimination.

Social  support  from  family  and  friends  was 
measured  using  the  Multidimensional  Scale  of  Per-
ceived  Social  Support  (MSPSS)  with  eight  items 
divided into two subscales: family support and friend 
support  (Zimet  et  al.,  1988).  Participants  rated  on  a 
four-point  scale  (Not  at  all = 1,  A  little  bit = 2,  Quite 
a  bit = 3,  A  lot = 4)  how  much  support  they  received 
from family (e.g. ‘I get the emotional help & support 
I  need  from  my  family’)  and  friends  (e.g.  ‘I  can 
count  on  my  friends  when  things  go  wrong’).  The 
reliabilities  for  the  two  subscales  were  Ω = .81  for 
family  support  and  Ω = .88  for  friend  support,  with 
higher scores representing more support.

2.4.  Statistical  analyses

All  analyses  were  conducted  using  cross-sectional 
baseline data. First, to determine the optimal number 
of  subgroups,  we  estimated  latent  profile  analyses 
(LPA)  with  k = 2  to  k = 8  profiles.  This  was  done 
using  the  mplus.lca  function from  the  Misty  package 
in R, which generates Mplus input files for conducting 
the analyses (Mplus version 8.4) (Muthén & Muthén, 
1998/2017; Yanagida, 2024). Following the procedure 
used  by  Turunen  et  al.  (2024)  the  profile  indicators 
(externalization, 
internalization,  PTSD-intrusion, 
PTSD-avoidance,  and  resilience)  were  standardized 
to assess their levels relative to the average of the entire 
sample  (Turunen  et  al.,  2024).  Six  within-profile

variance-covariance  structures  were  initially  exam-
ined,  but  only  two  converged,  resulting  in  a  total  of 
13 models (Masyn, 2013). Detailed description of the 
structures,  representing  various  assumptions  regard-
ing  the  variance  and  covariance  of  the  indicators 
within and between the profiles is provided in appen-
dix  3.  As  the  most  suitable  within-profile  variance- 
covariance  structure  is  not  known  beforehand,  it  is 
necessary  to  test  all  different  structures  to  identify 
the best model (Masyn, 2013).

likelihood  ratio 

To  select  the  optimal  latent  profile  model  from  the 
13  candidates,  we  combined  statistical  indicators  with 
theoretical  considerations.  The  model  with  the  lowest 
Akaike  information  criterion  (AIC),  Bayesian  infor-
mation  criterion  (BIC),  and  sample  size-adjusted  BIC 
(aBIC) values was considered the best relative fit across 
all  within-profile  variance-covariance  structures.  In 
test 
addition,  Lo-Mendell-Rubin 
(LMR-LRT), Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted LRT test (A- 
LRT), entropy values to measure classification accuracy, 
and profile prevalence (i.e. dismissing profiles with less 
than  5%  of  participants)  were  used  to  select  the  best 
model.  Moreover,  theoretical  interpretability  of  the 
profiles and the principle of parsimony (a more parsi-
monious  model  should  be  chosen  if  an  additional 
profile in a k-profile model represents only a slight vari-
ation from a profile in the k-1 model) were considered. 
All analyses were performed using the maximum like-
lihood  estimation  with  robust  standard  errors  (MLR). 
We requested 500 random sets of starting values, with 
100  initial  stage  iterations  and  50  final  stage  optimiz-
ations,  ensuring  that  the  highest  log-likelihood  value 
was  replicated  in  at  least  two  final  stage  iterations  to 
confirm the global solution.

Second, three-step procedure with BCH weights was 
used  to  examine  mean  differences  between  profiles 
regarding  the  demographic  and  contextual  determi-
nants. The BCH method is suitable for analysing both 
categorical and continuous variables (Vermunt, 2010). 
BCH  weighing  adjusts  for  the  downward  bias  in  the 
SEs,  avoids  shifts  in  latent  class  in  the  final  stage,  and 
seems  to  be  robust  to  non-normality  in  the  outcome 
variables  (Asparouhov  &  Muthén,  2021).  For  further 
information  on  the  three-step  BCH  method,  see 
Nylund-Gibson  et  al.  (2019)  and  Asparouhov  and 
Muthén  (2014).  To  account  for  familywise  error  rates 
for multiple hypothesis tests, Holm’s Sequential Bonfer-
roni  Procedure  was  followed  separately  for  each  out-
come  (Holm,  1979).  All  variables  considered  were 
unstandardized.  Missing  data  was  handled  using  the 
Full 
(FIML) 
(Muthén & Muthén, 1998/2017).

42.3%  were  girls,  with  mean  age  of  15.3  years  (SD 
2.15). A majority of the adolescents were refugees (n  
= 871,  54.2%)  and  a  third  were  immigrants  (n = 546, 
34.0%).  The  remaining  190  (11.8%)  adolescents’ 
migration  status  could  not  be  determined  based  on 
the information provided. The adolescents had resided 
in the host country on average for 2.6 years (SD 2.97). 
Gender  correlated  with  internalizing  symptoms  and 
PTSD-intrusion with girls reporting more symptoms. 
Female  gender  also  correlated  with  more  resilience, 
less  discrimination,  and  more  social  support  from 
family and friends. Age correlated with migration sta-
tus  with  refugee  adolescents  being  younger  than  the 
immigrant  adolescents.  Age  correlated  also  with  the 
number  of  daily  stressors,  internalizing  symptoms 
and  PTSD-intrusion  and  PTSD-avoidance,  with 
older participants reporting more stressors and symp-
toms.  Migration  status  correlated  with  the  length  of 
stay  in  the  host  country  with  refugees  having  longer 
residences.  Migration  status  correlated  with  daily 
stressors, discrimination, PTSD-symptoms, and resili-
ence with refugees having more daily stressors, more 
PTSD-intrusion and PTSD-avoidance, and more resi-
lience,  but 
immigrants 
less  discrimination  than 
(Table 1).

The  results  of  the  latent  profile  models  with  all  6 
within-profile  variance-covariance  structures  with  k  
= 2  to  k = 8  profiles  are  presented  in  Table  2.  Only 
13  of  the  models  converged  and  could  replicate  the 
highest  log-likelihood.  Overall,  the  profiles  in  the 
within-profile  variance-covariance  structure  C  (Class 
Invariant  umm,  Class  Invariant  Unrestricted  Sk) 
yielded  the  lowest  AIC,  BIC,  and  aBIC  values  and 
for this reason, the within-profile variance-covariance 
structure  A  (Class  Invariant  umm,  diagonal  Sk)  was 
dismissed.  The  Lo-Mendell-Rubin  likelihood  ratio 
tests  (LMR-LRT)  were  significant  until  k = 7,  but 
after  k = 4  the  class  sizes  were  reduced  to  less  than 
5%  of  the  sample.  For  this  reason,  the  k = 4  profile 
model,  with  an  acceptable  classification  accuracy 
according to the entropy value, was selected (Table 2).
Graphical representation of the profiles is presented 
in  Figure  1,  and  descriptive  information  on  mental 
health  symptoms  and  resilience  across  the  profiles  is 
available  in  Table  3.  All  profile  indicator  variables 
were  standardized,  so  each  measure  in  Figure  1 rep-
resents  the  degree  to  which  it  was  below  or  above 
the  average  sample  mean.  Results  revealed  four  dis-
tinct wellbeing profiles: The Low symptoms with aver-
age resilience (‘Low symptoms’) profile included 49.7% 
(n = 791) of the participants, characterized by less than 
average  mental  health  symptoms  (externalization, 
internalization,  PTSD-intrusion  and  PTSD-avoid-
ance)  and  an  average  level  of  resilience.  The  High 
intrusive  symptoms  with  average  resilience  (‘High 
symptoms  with  intrusion’)  profile  included  10.6% 
(n = 169)  of  participants,  showing  high  levels  of  all

mental  health  symptoms  and  a  markedly  high  level 
of  intrusive  PTSD  symptoms,  but  an  average  level  of 
resilience. The Moderate Symptoms with low resilience 
(‘Moderate  symptoms’)  profile  included  26.9%  (n =  
428) of participants, characterized by moderately elev-
ated  level  of  all  mental  health  symptoms  and  slightly 
less  than  average  resilience.  Finally,  the  Avoidant 
symptoms  with  high  resilience  (‘Resilient  avoidant’) 
profile  included  12.8%  (n = 203)  of  participants,  with 
less  than  average  externalization,  internalization  and 
PTSD-intrusion,  but  markedly  high  PTSD-avoidance 
symptoms  and  more  than  average  resilience.  The 
differences 
indicators 
in  unstandardized  profile 
between  the  profiles  are  shown  in  Appendix  4  and 
the division of participants in the profiles per country 
are presented in Appendix 1.

Table  4 presents  the  mean  differences  between 
profiles  regarding  all  demographic  and  contextual 
factors. Age was significantly associated with  profile 
membership (χ2 = 43.515, p < .001), with adolescents 
in  the  Low  symptoms  profile  being  younger  than 
those in the profiles with High symptoms with intru-
sion or Moderate symptoms. Gender distribution was 
not  significantly  different  between  the  profiles. 
Migration  status  was  significantly  associated  with 
profile  membership  (χ2 = 28.268,  p < .001),  as  there 
were  more 
in  the  Low  symptoms 
profile  compared  to  all  other  profiles.  The  time 
spent  in  the  host  country  also  had  a  significant 
effect  on  profile  membership  (χ2 = 38.864,  p < .001), 
with adolescents in the Low symptoms profile having 
resided in the host country longer than those in the 
other profiles.

immigrants 

The profiles differed also according to the exposure 
to  daily  stress  (χ2 = 15.902,  p = .001)  and  discrimi-
nation (χ2 = 23.698, p < .001). Adolescents in the Low 
symptoms  profile  had  a  lower  level  of  daily  stressors 
than  those  in  the  High  symptoms  with  intrusion 
profile.  Further,  the  High  symptoms  with  intrusion 
profile had experienced more daily stressors than the 
Moderate  symptoms  and  Resilient  avoidant  profiles. 
Regarding  discrimination,  adolescents  in  the  Low 
symptoms profile had experienced less discrimination 
than adolescents in the High symptoms with intrusion 
and  Moderate  symptoms  groups.  The  Resilient  avoi-
dant  profile  reported  less  discrimination  than  the 
High  symptoms  with  intrusion  profile.  In  addition, 
social  support  received  from  the  family  was  signifi-
cantly  associated  with  profile  membership  (χ2 =  
27.990, p < .001). Adolescents in the Resilient avoidant 
profile reported more familial social support than ado-
lescents  in  the  High  symptoms  with  intrusion  and 
Moderate  symptoms  profiles.  The  Low  symptoms 
group  also  had  significantly  more  family  support 
than the High symptoms with intrusion profile. Social 
support  from  friends  did  not  show  significant  differ-
ences between the profiles.

Figure  1.  Identified  four  wellbeing  profiles  with  externalizing  symptoms,  internalizing  symptoms,  PTSD-intrusion,  PTSD-avoid-
ance,  and  resilience.
Note.  All  variables  are  presented  as  standardized  z-scores.

4.  Discussion

Our study aimed to understand what kind of wellbeing 
profiles arise among immigrant and refugee youth and 
identified  four  profiles  with  both  quantitative  and 
qualitative  differences.  As  suggested  by  previous 
research  (Janousch  et  al.,  2022;  Kassis  et  al.,  2021; 
Moore  et  al.,  2019),  we  found  profiles  characterized 
by  quantitative  differences  in  the  level  of  all  mental 
health  symptoms,  i.e.  profiles  with  low,  moderate 
and  high  symptomatology.  In  addition,  we  distin-
guished  a  qualitatively  different  profile  with  differing 
levels of mental health symptoms. Interestingly, resili-
ence  did  not  consistently  correspond  with  symptom 
levels,  and  it  appeared  more  nuanced,  existing  along

a separate continuum. This finding suggests the need 
to  view  mental  health  and  resilience  as  co-occurring 
yet  distinct  elements,  which  lays  a  foundation  for 
further exploration in the paragraphs that follow.

In our analyses the distinguished profiles could be 
split into two categories. We identified two ‘Flourish-
ing’ profiles; Low symptoms profile with low levels of 
all  mental  health  symptoms  and  average  resilience, 
and  Resilient  avoidant  profile  characterized  by  low 
externalization,  internalization,  and  PTSD-intrusion, 
but  at  the  same  time  high  PTSD-avoidance  and  high 
resilience. In addition, we identified two ‘Languishing’ 
profiles; High symptoms with intrusion characterized 
by  high  level  of  all  mental  health  symptoms  but 
especially  marked  PTSD-intrusion,  and  Moderate 
symptoms  showing  moderately  elevated  symptoma-
tology on all scales and low resilience.

Our  findings  show  a  distinct  differentiation 
between the PTSD symptom dimensions of avoidance 
and intrusion across the wellbeing profiles. Avoidance 
symptoms were pronounced in the profile with higher 
resilience,  while  intrusion  symptoms  were  more 
prevalent  in  profiles  marked  by  higher  levels  of  dis-
tress.  While  previous  research  has  shown  that  avoid-
ance  can  serve  as  a  short-term  coping  mechanism 
leading  to 
for  traumatic  experiences,  potentially 
increased  PTSD  symptoms  over  time  (Thompson 
et  al.,  2018),  this  relationship  remains  complex  and 
warrants further investigation. Additionally, it is poss-
ible  that  adolescents  displaying  avoidance  symptoms

may  underreport  or  be  less  aware  of  their  distress  in 
self-reported  measures,  which  could  have  influenced 
our results. Also, as this study did not measure trauma 
exposure,  it  is  possible  that  the  avoidance  symptoms 
represent  a  more  general  avoidance  of  adversities 
instead  of  diagnostic  avoidance  symptoms  of  PTSD. 
Intrusions,  however,  are  a  core  symptom  of  PTSD 
(Bar-Haim et al., 2021) and  therefore the  group with 
significant 
intrusions  could  better  represent  the 
group  with  PTSD  symptoms.  Intrusions  are  also 
known  to  share  aetiology  and  prevalence  with  a 
range of other mental health symptoms, which is likely 
to  indicate  a  general  vulnerability  to  poor  mental 
health  (Lawrence-Wood  et  al.,  2016).  Longitudinal 
studies  and  explicit  inquiry  of  trauma  exposure 
would thus be needed to better understand how avoid-
ance  and  intrusion  symptoms  of  PTSD  evolve  in 
relation to other mental health outcomes.

Our  finding  also  revealed  multiple  contextual  fac-
tors that were important in determining the wellbeing 
profile  membership.  Immigrants,  younger  adoles-
cents,  and  those  who  had  resided  longer  in  the  new 
host  country  belonged  more  often  to  the  Low  symp-
toms  profile.  Furthermore,  adolescents  with  lower 
amount  of  daily  material  stress,  less  discrimination 
experiences,  and  high  social  support  from  family 
were more often members of either of the flourishing 
groups.  While  a  direct  comparison  with  previous 
studies  on  wellbeing  profiles  among  immigrant  and 
refugee youth is not possible due to the lack of similar 
research, our findings are consistent with existing evi-
dence that highlights refugees’ increased susceptibility 
to  mental  health  symptoms  (Betancourt  et  al.,  2017; 
Spaas  et  al.,  2021).  Mental  health  of  immigrant  and 
refugee  youth  also  appears  to  increase  as  they  have 
had  the  chance  to  integrate  into  the  new  home 
country, and create social ties. In accordance with pre-
vious  research,  lacking  access  to  sufficient  resources 
such as money, food, or housing, or experiencing dis-
crimination  were  serious  threats  to  adolescent  well-
being  (Benner  et  al.,  2018;  Hynie,  2018).  This 
highlights  the  need  to  create  supportive  and  stable 
life  conditions  with  sufficient  resources  in  order  to 

support  wellbeing,  as  socioeconomic  daily  stressors 
can  also  become  an  obstacle  to  how  youth  can 
benefit  from  wellbeing  interventions  (Peltonen  et  al., 
refugee  youth, 
immigrant  and 
2022).  Among 
especially support from the family seems to contribute 
to flourishing, as these youth may not yet have had the 
chance  to  create  trustful  friendships  in  the  new 
country,  and  migrating  as  a  family  may  create  a 
sense  of  unity  while  navigating  the  new  cultural  sur-
roundings together.

4.1.  Strengths  and  limitations

Our study has several strengths, such as providing new 
insights  into  the  wellbeing  of  immigrant  and  refugee 
adolescents  and  achieving  a  substantial  sample  size 
for  this  hard-to-reach  population.  However,  there 
are  limitations  to  consider.  First,  although  we  aimed 
to analyse both positive and negative aspects of well-
being,  our  profiles  were  mainly  shaped  by  varying 
levels  of  PTSD  and  other  mental  health  symptoms, 
as  resilience  showed  low  variance.  While  the  lack  of 
symptoms can be interpreted as an indicator of well-
being,  future  research  should  include  more  nuanced 
measures  of  resources.  Second,  while  our  data  is 
enriched  by  participants  from  multiple  European 
countries,  small  sample  sizes  in  some  countries  pre-
vented  country-specific  comparisons,  limiting  the 
generalizability  of  our  findings.  The  results  should 
therefore  be  considered  as  initial,  general  findings, 
and future studies should seek to replicate the results 
in  different  contexts.  Third,  the  categorization  of 
migration  status  was  based  on  somewhat  subjective 
inferences  from  the  country  of  origin,  which  may 
have introduced classification errors. Lastly, although 
the  CRIES-8  scale  aims  to  measure  explicitly  PTSD 
symptoms,  which  should  by  definition  be  the  conse-
quence of a traumatic event, the survey lacked a ques-
tion of traumatic experiences. Therefore, the measures 
of avoidance and intrusions could also indicate more 
general  tendency  to  avoid  adversities  or  engage  in 
imagery-related  intrusive  rumination  that  may  also 
be  present  in  other  mental  health  conditions  (Bar- 

Haim  et  al.,  2021).  In  future  studies  to  better  dis-
tinguish PTSD symptoms from related symptomatol-
ogy in other mental health conditions, it would be of 
utmost importance to also inquire about the exposure 
to traumatic events.

In  conclusion,  despite  some  limitations,  our  study 
shows interesting differences in the wellbeing profiles 
of  European  immigrant  and  refugee  youth  especially 
related to PTSD symptoms. It seems that experiencing 
fewer daily stressors and discrimination and receiving 
substantial  family  support  may  collectively  bolster 
resilience  and  help  adolescents  manage  symptoms 
effectively,  while  avoidance  may  also  initially  aid  in 
coping.  In  contrast,  higher  levels  of  discrimination 
and  stress,  coupled  with  minimal  family  support  is 
associated  with  more  pronounced  symptoms  and 
intrusive  experiences.  This  study  highlights  that 
PTSD symptoms are importantly related to resources 
and  life  circumstances  and  that  they  have  an  impor-
tant  role  in  the  interplay  of  resilience  and  mental 
health  symptoms.  Future interventions  should  utilize 
the  new  person-centered  information  to  create  more 
differentiated  support  that  is  tailored  to  address  the 
specific  requirements  for  the  different  profiles  of 
these young people.
