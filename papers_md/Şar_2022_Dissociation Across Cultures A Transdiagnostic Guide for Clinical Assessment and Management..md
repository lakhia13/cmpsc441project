Dissociation Across Cultures: A Transdiagnostic Guide 
for Clinical Assessment and Management

ABSTRACT

The clinical heterogeneity of dissociation constitutes a challenge to the culture-sensitive 
clinician. Variability in experiencing dissociation, the interplay between acute and chronic 
conditions,  and  the  predominance  of  a  nosologically  interface-type  of  clinical  surface 
conceal core dissociative symptoms. While the latter (amnesia, depersonalization, dere-
alization,  identity  confusion,  and  identity  alteration)  usually  remain  underreported,  the 
clinical surface may be dominated by acute (functional neurological symptoms, brief psy-
chosis,  an  experience  of  possession,  or  acute  dissociative  reaction  to  a  stressful  event) 
or chronic (mood and personality disorders) secondary syndromes. However, these syn-
dromes  also  constitute  gateways  in  pursuing  the  clues  of  core  dissociation.  Given  that 
culture influences communication between clinician and patient, accurate expression of 
mental  content  requires  the  idiomatic  armamentarium  describing  the  experience.  The 
latter is problematic in dealing with phenomena of core dissociation while the second-
ary representations have a relatively universal character for both clinicians and patients. 
Nevertheless, this approach requires a transdiagnostic understanding in conceiving this 
clinical  interface.  This  interface  reflects,  in  fact,  complications  of  dissociative  disorders 
which require to be addressed in the first line. This is either due to the medical and psychi-
atric urgency (e.g., functional neurological symptoms, brief psychosis) or due to resistance 
to treatment (e.g., antidepressant pharmacotherapy) which seem to be indicated for the 
particular condition. This transdiagnostic schema is based on a combined utilization of 
etic  and  emic  principles  in  the  cultural  understanding  of  psychiatric  disorders.  Namely, 
universal  medical-psychiatric  categories  are  conceived  as  tools  of  communication  and 
mutual understanding rather than being mere appearances or primary disturbances.

Introduction

Closely related to experiences of stress and polysymptomatic character, dissociative disor-
ders (DDs) constitute a culture-sensitive domain of psychiatry.1 However, a lack of systematic 
knowledge about the modern understanding of DDs prevented clinicians in many countries 
from making specific diagnoses on this spectrum, before the introduction of their diagnos-
tic criteria in DSM-III.2 In fact, the DDs as described in the DSM-5 are not limited to certain 
cultures.3

One major challenge for culture-sensitive clinicians is the intrinsic nature of chronic disso-
ciation to remain hidden. This is mainly due to the avoidance and denial of negative emo-
tions (e.g., shame) and painful memories of a traumatic childhood.4 Moreover, awareness of 
potentially traumatic impact of life events and relatively subtle types of developmental trau-
matization (e.g., insecure attachment and emotional neglect) may differ between cultures. 
Cultural and local sanctions against open communication and disclosure may also interfere 
with accurate reporting of developmental adversities, a factor which further boosts dissocia-
tion and DDs.

Given the mental avoidance inherent to dissociation, three aspects of clinical psychopathol-
ogy are critical in better assessment of patients belonging to diverse areas of the world: the

variability in experiencing dissociation, the interplay between acute 
and  chronic  conditions,  and  the  predominance  of  a  nosologically 
interface-type  of  clinical  surface  which  conceals  core  dissociative 
symptoms.  The  diversity  in  culturally  shaped  ways  of  expressing 
conflict, stress, and of coping further confounds this already existing 
heterogeneity.

From Possession to Personality State
A  distinct  personality  state  is  a  concept  of  modern  psychiatry. 
However,  possession  is  a  description  with  long  historical  past  and 
worldwide recognition. Possession syndromes are considered as the 
transient  replacement  of  the  individual’s  identity  by  one  or  more 
entities or source of power originating from the external world. Such 
agents  may  typically  be  a  culturally  accepted  jinnie,  spirit,  demon, 
or the spirit of a deceased person or any entity of supranatural qual-
ity.5 In fact, either in its lucid or its trance version, an experience of 
“being possessed” is present in all patients with “modern” cases of 
Western dissociative identity disorder (DID) or its subthreshold forms 
as well. However, rather than having external origin, this influence is 
perceived as a mental intrusion from within; that is, originating from 
a distinct personality state. Occasionally, “modern” cases may come 
up with a mixture of both phenomena.

From Secondary to the Core
Dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, identity con-
fusion, and identity alteration are the core clinical symptoms of disso-
ciation.6 Studies conducted in diverse geographies have consistently 
demonstrated that these core symptoms do occur among patients 
with DDs from various cultures. However, several syndromes second-
ary to dissociation create a clinical surface which may hide the core 
dissociative psychopathology underneath.7 In fact, secondary symp-
toms do not replace the core symptoms; they exist alongside them. 
Covering an unusually broad range of psychiatric phenomenology, 
syndromes  secondary  to  DDs  constitute  a  diagnostic  challenge  to 
the  clinician  due  to  their  variability  across  patients  and  cultures. 
Moreover,  almost  all  psychiatric  disorders  may  be  accompanied  by 
dissociative  symptoms.8,9  In  communities  where  information  about 
DDs  is  not  widespread,  patients  with  DDs  may  not  even  be  aware 
of the pathological quality of some of their dissociative experiences. 
They seek help when the DD has led to complications, in the form 
of  secondary  symptoms. These  syndromes  may  remain  resistant  to 
treatment  by  interventions  shaped  for  their  primary  forms,  as  the 
underlying  dissociative  psychopathology  would  not  have  been 
addressed then.

MAIN POINTS

•  As conditions related to traumatic stress, dissociative disorders are 

critically important for culture-sensitive psychiatry.

•  Dissociation  may  cause  disturbances  of  sense  of  self  and  altered 

states of consciousness. 

•  There is a discrepancy between clinical surface and core psychopa-

thology in dissociative disorders.

•  The clinical surface of dissociative disorders covers a broad spec-
trum of psychiatric nosology including mood, somatic symptoms, 
personality, and psychotic disorders.

•  As  an  interface  between  various  psychiatric  conditions,  dissocia-
tion represents transdiagnostic consequences of early-life stress.

From Acute to Chronic
The  early  predominance  of Western  empirical  research  on  chronic 
DDs such as DID and its subthreshold forms led to the impression 
that they were limited to North America, while acute-transient DDs 
were  considered  culture-bound  and  most  prevalent  in  Asian  and 
African continents. The more dramatic acute dissociative phenom-
ena attract clinical attention more readily as they constitute medi-
cal  and/or  psychiatric  emergencies,  in  particular  when  functional 
neurological symptoms (FNSs) or loss of control of behavior prevail. 
Recognition of chronic types of DDs is affected in particular due to 
the subtle nature of their core symptoms which may remain hidden 
behind  the  polysymptomatic  “surface.”  However,  these  patients 
may  enter  intermittent  crisis  episodes,  whose  descriptions  are  dis-
persed across a large spectrum; for example, a suddenly emerging 
functional neurological symptom disorder (FNSD), a brief psychotic 
disorder, an acute dissociative reaction to stress, or an experience of 
possession. Such crisis episodes may serve as a “diagnostic window” 
for  chronic  DDs  in  diverse  cultures  because  acute  DDs  are  better-
known than the chronic DDs worldwide. However, unless follow-up 
examinations are conducted, a preexisting and ongoing chronic dis-
sociative process may remain dormant. Once the patient has calmed 
down  and  the  urgent  condition  is  over,  the  initial  motivation  to 
seek help may diminish despite the presence of subtle dissociative 
symptoms.

In this paper, clinical presentations of DDs are reviewed in consider-
ation  of  these  3  perspectives.  Six  conditions  have  been  chosen  for 
this review as they challenge the widely accepted categories of the 
general  psychiatric  nosology.  These  presentations  serve  the  clini-
cian as gateways leading to the recognition of DDs in their patients. 
For the sake of clinical utility, these conditions have been presented 
according to their acute or chronic status.

Acute Presentations of Dissociative Disorders

Dissociation  Presenting  as  a  Functional  Neurological  Symptom 
Disorder: Clinicians of the nineteenth century (Charcot, Janet, Freud, 
and others) considered both psychological and somatic symptoms of 
dissociation  under  the  concept  of  hysteria.10  Indeed,  a  complete 
separation of somatic and psychological components of dissociation 
may not fit the clinical reality.11 Patients diagnosed considering the 
psychological  dissociation  also  have  high  scores  on  measures  of 
somatic  symptoms  of  dissociation,  including  nonepileptic  seizures 
(i.e., pseudo seizures).12 While several types of somatic symptoms and 
related disorders are also prevalent among patients with DDs, FNSD 
is the one most specifically related. Recognizing this close connection, 
the  DSM-5  covers  alteration  of  somatosensory  functions  in  the 
diagnostic criteria of DID.13

Clinical  Presentation:  Patients  with  FNSD  often  apply  to  an 
emergency outpatient unit, considering the urgency of the situation 
due  to  its  medical  nature.  Such  symptoms  may  cover  a  very  large 
spectrum; for example, fainting fits, muscle contractions, disturbances 
of  gait,  or  blindness.  Although  FNSs  may  constitute  a  disorder  on 
their  own,  they  may  also  occur  in  a  DSM-5  DD.14,15  Reflecting  this 
connection,  in  an  epidemiological  study  among  women  in  the 
general  population  in  Turkey,  presence  of  a  DD  was  one  of  the 
predictors of having ever experienced at least one FNS.16 In patients 
with  a  chronic  DD,  the  superimposed  FNSs  may  have  a  fluctuating 
course  over  time.14  FNSD  may  also  be  part  of  an  acute  dissociative

reaction to a stressful event; for example, “ataque de nervios” seen in 
Latino cultures.17

Associated  Symptoms:  Patients  with  FNSD  may  enter  transiently 
into stupor or trance and may report experiences of depersonalization 
and derealization during the attack. They may remain amnesic to the 
episode.  A  2-year  follow-up  study  on  patients  with  FNSD  in Turkey 
demonstrated  that  patients  with  a  concurrent  DSM-5  DD  had  an 
elevated  number  of  general  psychiatric  comorbidity,  childhood 
trauma  history,  and  self-destructive  behavior  compared  to  those 
who did not have a DD.18

Geography:  Compared  to Western  Europe  and  North  America,  the 
figures obtained in Turkey point to a strongly heightened prevalence 
of FNSD.18 While a North American review estimated the prevalence 
rate of nonepileptic seizures as 1/3000 and 1/50 000, in Turkey, their 
lifetime  prevalence  was  reported  as  3.8%  among  women  in  the 
general  population.16,19  In  another  epidemiological  study  in Turkey, 
the prevalence of FNS was 5.6% equally for both genders.20 In a semi-
rural area of Turkey, the prevalence of FNSs in the preceding month 
was  27.2%  and  the  lifetime  prevalence  was  48.2%  among  primary 
care outpatients.21 FNSD was the most prevalent cause of admittance 
in a survey of consecutive admissions to a medical emergency center 
in Turkey over 1 year. Namely, FNSD was observed in 62.6% of women 
and 45.9% of men among applications due to a psychiatric reason.22 
The prevalence of fainting spells was 48.1%. In a comparison among 
patients  with  a  chronic  DD,  nonepileptic  seizures  were  seen  more 
frequently in the Turkish than in the Dutch group.23

Assessment,  Differential  Diagnosis,  and  Management:  Any 
neurological symptom requires a medical work-up to determine its 
functional  nature.  Besides  other  psychiatric  comorbidities,  the 
possibility of a concurrent acute or chronic DD should be evaluated. 
In Turkey, 30.5% of patients in a university psychiatric inpatient unit 
who  were  admitted  due  to  a  FNSD  met  the  lifetime  criteria  for  a 
DSM-IV DD.15 The denial by these patients about anxiety-provoking 
traumatic mental content has led to the historical designation of “la 
belle  indifference,”  which  itself  points  to  the  dissociative  nature  of 
the  condition.  Psychoeducation  about  the  potential  course  of  the 
condition and possible relapse of somatic symptoms is necessary to 
prevent repetitive emergency department visits. Such orientation is 
also indicated for the relatives of the patient. Somatic symptoms may 
have induced fear both in the patient as well as in his or her social 
network,  who  may  have  denied  the  psychological  origin  of  the 
problem. Beside events of traumatic scope, even mild levels of stress 
may be linked to FNSs, which underlines the importance of mediating 
factors including dissociation.

Dissociation Presenting as a Brief Psychotic Disorder
Culturally structured spontaneous trances that may be reactions to 
environmental stress and psychological trauma may cause functional 
psychoses.24  Formerly  called  hysterical  or  dissociative  psychosis,  a 
brief psychotic disorder of dissociative origin is the most severe type 
of acute dissociative reaction to a stressful event.25 Such an episode 
may also constitute a transient crisis superimposed on a chronic DD 
such as DID or its subthreshold forms.26

Clinical  Presentation:  In  acute  dissociative  psychotic  episodes, 
mixed  dissociative  symptoms  may  occur  such  as  flashbacks;  vivid 
visual  and  auditory  hallucinations;  child-like  attitude;  disorganized 

behavior; fugue; suicidal tendency; transient disturbances of reality 
testing; acute disorientation to person, place, and time, and affective 
instability. The condition may cease in a few hours or days, or may 
continue for a few weeks, sometimes ending as suddenly as it began, 
with no schizotypal residue. Amnesia of the episode may remain. A 
3-year follow-up study in India reported that 68.3% of these patients 
had  no  further  psychotic  symptoms,  20%  had  further  dissociative 
psychotic attacks, and 11.6% had episodes of FNSD.27

Associated  Symptoms:  When  in  an  acute  attack,  the  patient  may 
enter  into  trance  and  possession  states.  Aggression  against  self  or 
others and mystical experiences or excessive religious behavior (e.g., 
praying)  may  occur.  Altered  states  of  consciousness  and  amnesia 
may  be  observed.  Rapid  dissociative  personality  switches  may 
resemble an organic mental disorder or disturbance of thought flow. 
Affectivity  may  be  volatile  but  not  flat.  Thought  disorders  are 
generally circumscribed and transient. Unlike in other types of brief 
psychotic  disorder,  FNSs  (e.g.,  nonepileptic  seizures  or  fainting  fits) 
are common.

Geography: Psychotic disorders with acute onset and brief duration 
which usually occur in response to a stressful event, show a higher 
prevalence in the developing world than in industrialized societies. A 
recent  opinion  paper  on  the  DSM-5  underlined  that  stress-related 
brief psychotic disorder is common in India.28 Among 4390 patients 
admitted to a psychiatric unit in India, 2% were diagnosed as having 
acute dissociative psychosis.27 Compared to those with schizophrenia, 
these patients tended to be female and young (i.e., before age of 20). 
In  a  screening  study  among  1366  patients  admitted  to  a  general 
hospital  in  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia  between  1988  and  1998,  the 
prevalence  of  acute  and  transient  psychotic  disorders  was  8.6%.29 
Most  non-Arab  expatriates  were  diagnosed  as  having  acute  and 
transient psychotic, stress-related, or dissociative disorders.

Assessment,  Differential  Diagnosis,  and  Management:  A  patient 
with  brief  dissociative  psychosis  usually  presents  as  an  emergency 
case.  A  schizophrenic  disorder  should  be  excluded  on  the  basis  of 
features such as flattened affect and other negative symptoms. For 
cases  with  an  underlying  DID,  a  careful  observation  may  lead  to 
recognition of a “revolving door crisis” (as described by Putnam) due 
to  frequent  switching  between  distinct  personality  states  or  a 
“co-consciousness  crisis” 
(as  described  by  Kluft,  personal 
communication, 1995) due to temporary breakdown of dissociative 
barriers leading to flooding of the consciousness with trauma-related 
content.30 Selected questions from the Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) are helpful in determining 
the dissociative character of the episode.6

In  an  Indian  study,  50%  of  a  consecutively  admitted  patients  with 
dissociative psychosis required hospitalization.27 The condition typi-
cally begins to remit in a few days after the patient is hospitalized. 
Atypical  and  low-potency  antipsychotics  may  be  used  in  moder-
ate  doses,  particularly  for  sedation.  Anecdotal  reports  point  to  the 
option  of  cognitive–analytic  psychotherapy  which  should  address 
current  interpersonal  problems  rather  than  past  traumatic  experi-
ences.31  Suicidality  should  be  carefully  assessed  and  monitored,  so 
that the wrong decision of outpatient treatment is not made. After 
cessation  of  the  acute  episode,  screening  of  chronic  dissociative 
experiences may be helpful to detect an underlying chronic DD.

Dissociation Presenting as an Acute Reaction to a Stressful Event

An acute stress disorder in response to  a traumatic  experience  has 
been a diagnostic category covering dissociative symptoms since its 
inception in DSM-IV. However, an adjustment disorder (a milder but 
longer-lasting form of reaction to stress of non-traumatic scope) with 
dissociative features has not been defined. The new DSM-5 category 
of acute dissociative reaction to a stressful event fills this gap in terms 
of mild severity of the stressor and response; however, unlike adjust-
ment disorders overall, it is limited to conditions of less than 1 month 
duration.

Clinical Presentation: Acute dissociative reaction to a stressful event 
is  characterized  by  one  or  more  of  the  experiences  such  as 
trance,  and 
depersonalization,  derealization,  anxiety,  stupor, 
possession.  A  frightening  experience,  tension 
in  a  significant 
interpersonal  relationship,  an  internal  conflict  challenged  by  an 
event, intense anger, or similar circumstances may lead to an acute 
dissociative reaction.

Associated Symptoms: FNSs, self-mutilation, suicidality, flashbacks, 
and dissociative amnesia with or without fugue may occur. An Indian 
study  proposed  “brief  dissociative  stupor”  as  a  type  of  acute 
reaction.32  These  patients,  mostly  women,  had 
dissociative 
significantly more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and panic attacks. 
While  the  dissociative  subtype  of  PTSD 
is  characterized  by 
experiences  of  depersonalization  and/or  derealization,  FNSs  and 
possession experiences (as a cultural equivalent of depersonalization 
and/or derealization) may accompany the condition as well.33

Geography: The lifetime prevalence of ataque de nervios, an acute 
transient anxiety episode with strong dissociative features, has been 
reported  as  10.2%  in  a  representative  community  study  in  Puerto 
Rico and as 52-55% in Puerto Rican psychiatric outpatients both in 
Puerto Rico and the northeastern United States.17,34 Acute dissociative 
reaction to stress is expected to be most prevalent in mass trauma 
populations (refugees, natural disaster and terrorism victims) as well 
as populations under risk such as those in military and prison settings.

Assessment,  Differential  Diagnosis,  and  Management:  An  acute 
dissociative reaction to a stressful event has to be differentiated from 
acute stress disorder, PTSD, adjustment disorders, and chronic DDs 
such as DID and its subthreshold forms (i.e., other specified DDs or 
OSDDs). If present, details of the previous episodes may provide hints 
about  vulnerabilities  (e.g.,  possible  precipitants  of  the  current 
episode, if not reported yet) and the resiliency level of the patient. 
Unless  comorbidity  is  present,  such  reactions  require  a  supportive 
approach  to  assist  the  patient  in  grounding.  Relatively  persistent 
conditions  may  benefit  from  anxiolytics.  Psychoeducation  for  the 
patient  and  for  the  relatives  is  helpful  subsequent  to  the  episode. 
Family  conflicts  are  not  uncommon.  Treatment-resistant  and 
repetitive episodes are suspect for comorbidity such as a chronic DD. 
Hypnotherapeutic  interventions  may  be  helpful  in  resolving  a 
transient crisis superposed on a chronic DD.

Dissociation Presenting as an Experience of Possession
The  DSM-5  includes  presentations  characterized  by  pathological 
possession  in  the  diagnostic  criteria  of  DID  as  a  cultural  variant  of 
experiencing  the  disruption  of  identity.6 They  are  distinguished  by 

98

the  experience  of  incorporation  of  an  external  identity  rather  than 
fragmentation of internal identity. Indeed, as shown both in Turkey 
and  North  America,  a  subgroup  of  patients  with  DID  experience, 
alongside distinct personality states, the presence of possessing enti-
ties that cause an alteration in their sense of self and agency.33,35

In  a  Turkish  study  on  women  from  the  general  population,  pos-
session states were associated with traumatic experiences of both 
childhood and adulthood.33 They were related to DDs, depression, 
and PTSD as well. A North American study conducted in the general 
population also revealed a significant relationship between experi-
ences  of  possession  and  childhood  trauma.36  Pathological  posses-
sion cases in Uganda had significantly higher exposure to traumatic 
events than the randomly selected mentally healthy inhabitants of 
the  same  villages.37  However,  in  accordance  with  the  cultural  per-
ception of dissociative symptoms, the affected individuals subjec-
tively  did  not  associate  dissociative  symptoms  with  traumatizing 
events.  Childhood  trauma  histories  of  women  with  somatization 
disorder  from  a  non-industrialized  region  of  eastern  Turkey  also 
did not correlate with dissociation but with experiences of posses-
sion.38 Hence, in certain cultural contexts, an experience of posses-
sion  may  point  to  a  traumatic  antecedent  better  than  “classical” 
dissociation.

Dissociative  phenomena  and  experiences  of  possession  are  con-
sidered  non-pathological  if  they  are  part  of  a  broadly  accepted 
cultural  practice  such  as  a  religious  ceremony.  Culturally  accepted 
incidents  are  not  presented  to  an  expert  for  treatment  unless  the 
affected person or his acquaintances become anxious or fearful due 
to the experience. These emotions may affect both the patient and 
his  acquaintances  as  they  may  interpret  this  unwanted  experience 
as  an  indicator  of  an  unknown  misconduct  or  sin  or,  alternatively, 
the  experience  of  possession  itself  may  violate  or  threaten  a  social 
code; for example, being invited to sexual relationship or even being 
“raped” by the “intruding entity” which may be associated with “loss 
of honor.” As there is usually an ambiguity about the origin of such 
conditions among affected people, a medical person and/or a para-
medical healer or a quasi-religious advisor may be approached with 
questions inquiring this; that is, whether the experience represents 
a  medical-psychiatric  condition  or  an  influence  by  a  supranatural 
entity which may be explained by religious conceptualizations. 

Historically, experiences of trance possession have served as cultur-
ally accepted practices perceived as equivalent to modern psycho-
therapy.  Paramedical  or  folk  healers  seen  in  some  contemporary 
communities which are in cultural transition may be considered as 
an anachronistic sequela of such traditions. For example, Stambali, a 
Tunisian trance-dance practiced as a healing ritual against demonic 
possession, actually serves as a culturally accepted way of express-
ing anger.39 Asian shamanism practices as seen in Nepal serve as rite 
of passage.40 Protagonists of such practices cannot be diagnosed as 
having  a  DD  unless  they  fit  the  diagnostic  requirements  of  suffer-
ing subjective distress or psychosocial dysfunctionality due to these 
experiences.41

Possession is a strong belief system in the developing world for social 
factors  such  as  isolation,  educational  deprivation,  polyglotism,  and 
lack of an adequate medical infrastructure. It also represents a need 
for  hope.  In  such  countries,  possession,  and  the  practice  of  exor-
cism, are not only an explanatory system based on superstition and 

Şar. Dissociation Across Cultures

folklore but also a social structure that facilitates a first step from the 
community to the medical system.42 

Clinical Presentation: In classical DID, the discontinuity in the sense 
of self and agency is usually accompanied by the experience of being 
possessed by an entity described as a personality state or an aspect 
of personality. Although an “alternate” personality state has more or 
less the quality of estrangement, it is never perceived as originating 
from  an  externally  located  power  or  source.  Alternate  personality 
states represent an individual reality for the affected person; however, 
possessing entities usually display a collective existence. For example, 
the same spirit may possess other individuals.34

Possession  states  themselves  also  show  great  diversity  in  develop-
ing countries such as Uganda and India.43,44 In a prospective screen-
ing  study  on  psychiatric  outpatients  in  Jordan,  the  duration  of  the 
disorder  was  longer  than  2  years  for  53.1%  of  the  patients.45  The 
possessing  agent  (usually  labeled  as  a  Jinn)  was  usually  reported 
by the patient as located in the body such as in the head and neck, 
chest,  upper  limbs,  or  multiple  sites.  It  was  perceived  in  auditory, 
visual, and/or somatic ways. The most common behavioral changes 
induced by a possessing agent were loss of control, abnormal move-
ment, nonepileptic seizure, loss of consciousness, and change in tone 
of voice. The possessing agent may be perceived as male or female 
(including the opposite gender of the patient); 38% of the patients 
reported  sexual  intercourse  with  the  possessing  agent  and  71.5% 
of the patients experienced psychosocial stress prior to the onset of 
their illness. Almost all patients visited a paramedical healer prior to 
their application to psychiatric treatment.

In a study in Uganda, illness stories described 2 different phases of 
spirit  possession.  Namely,  passive  influence  experiences  occurred 
first, and the actual possession states followed this.37 Shaking move-
ments,  changes  in  consciousness,  and  talking  in  a  voice  attributed 
to spirits were fitting the DSM-5 DID criteria. Although not explicitly 
described in the diagnostic criteria of DID in DSM-5, hearing voices, 
strange  dreams,  and  passive  influence  experiences,  such  as  feeling 
influenced  by  external  powers,  were  common.  Possession  by  Zar 
spirits  is  characterized  by  involuntary  movements  such  as  nonepi-
leptic seizures, mutism, and incomprehensible language.46 In a series 
of  young  adults  with  Djinnati  possession  in  Baluchistan  (Iran),  epi-
sodes of impaired consciousness and unresponsiveness to external 
stimuli  were  the  chief  complaints.47  The  patients  were  completely 
amnesic about the “attacks.” Behaviors suggesting visual or auditory 
hallucinations,  for  example,  looking  scared  and  self  talking;  speak-
ing in a changed voice, accent, or even language; and a change in 
identity  were  common.  The  new  identity  was  strange  both  to  the 
patients and their relatives. It was typically of the opposite gender, 
and presented itself as a djinnie. Psychomotor agitation with an urge 
for escape, often accompanied by screaming, were also common. 

that  the  majority  of  the  individuals  who  had  an  experience  of 
possession also reported at least one paranormal experience such as 
precognition  and  contact  or  communication  with  non-human 
entities.33 A factor analysis yielded 4 types: possession and/or contact 
with non-human entities, extrasensory communications, possession 
by human entities (dead or alive), and precognition. Most dissociative 
and  traumatized  women  had  the  highest  scores  on  all  4  factors. 
Extrasensory experiences and paranormal phenomena were related 
to DDs in an Israeli study as well.49

in  certain 
Geography:  Possession  syndromes  are  observed 
geographic areas more commonly; for example, in the Middle East, 
India,  and  Africa.  In  many  parts  of  India,  health  care  is  delivered 
through  the  practice  of  possession.42 The  prevalence  of  possession 
syndrome in rural India has been estimated at 0.97% (over 6 months) 
to 3.5% (over 1 year), depending on the region, sample, and method 
of assessment.22 In Turkey, a screening study among women in the 
general  population  revealed  a  lifetime  prevalence  of  2.1%.33  The 
significant majority (12 of 13) of these women had a DD. A systematic 
epidemiological  and  community-based  study 
India 
documented a 1-year period prevalence of 3.7%, and 44.9% of the 
respondents  in  the  study  believed  in  spirit  possession;  6.1%  of 
outpatients  and  6.7%  of  inpatients  attending  a  tertiary  referral 
psychiatric  hospital  were  diagnosed  to  have  DDs  over  a  10-year 
period; 11.5% of the outpatients had trance and possession disorder. 
Among  inpatients,  this  rate  was  5.3%.  In  a  prospective  screening 
study  conducted  on  psychiatric  outpatients  in  Jordan,  possession 
syndrome was more prevalent among men than women, with a ratio 
of 1.6 : 1.45 The belief in possession by Zar spirits is one of the most 
common possession phenomena in Africa and in other continents.46

in  South 

Assessment,  Differential  Diagnosis,  and  Management:  An 
experience of possession may occur in various ways: as a culturally 
accepted normative phenomenon, an acute dissociative reaction to 
a stressful event, or as part of a chronic DD. Although not described 
as  such  in  the  DSM-5,  the  dissociative  subtype  of  PTSD  (with 
depersonalization or derealization) may have also a cultural variant 
characterized by possession experiences.33 A delusion of possession 
due to a psychotic disorder should be ruled out.50

In a review of 114 patients in 19 articles, psychotherapy was the most 
commonly used treatment (59%) which was helpful for most of the 
patients.51 Nevertheless, the attribution of the stress experience to an 
external source rather than dealing with it as an individual process 
is a challenge.52 Psychoeducation is the first step in the intervention. 
Acceptance  of  this  subjective  experience  as  a  legitimate  phenom-
enon by the therapist is important to prevent antagonism and rejec-
tion. The  therapy  should  be  navigated  toward  the  pathogenesis  of 
the stressful condition, such as facilitating reconciliation in a family to 
overcome unresolved anger and guilt in the patient.53,54

Associated Symptoms: In a review of 28 articles reporting 402 cases 
of patients with dissociative trance disorder worldwide, there were 
no  significant  differences  in  the  prevalence  between  genders. 
Experiences of possession (69%) were predominant compared with 
trance  (31%).  Twenty  percent  of  patients  reported  amnesia. 
Hallucinatory symptoms during possession episodes were found in 
56% and somatic complaints in 34% of patients.48 A screening study 
among  women  in  the  general  population  in Turkey  demonstrated 

Attempts of “exorcism” (“removal of the possessing entity”) have been 
reported as not being helpful in patients with DID.55 Experiences of 
possession may lead to seeking help from paramedical or quasi-reli-
gious folk healers. Such unlicensed practices which usually focus on 
“removal  of  the  possessing  entity”  may  be  harmful  and  abusive  as 
they usually tend to reaffirm oppressive cultural norms rather than 
allowing the patients an avenue of expressing themselves. In some 
circumstances,  it  is  reasonable  for  the  modern  therapist  to  work 

99

within the client’s belief system and culture-specific components of 
his or her illness, without necessarily endorsing the validity of such 
beliefs.56 The  strategic  combination  of  culture-specific  and  modern 
psychiatric  approach  (e.g.,  joining  the  patient’s  explanatory  model 
while  adding  cognitive-behavioral  or  hypnotic  interventions)  may 
lead to the best outcome in those situations.57,58

Chronic Presentations of Dissociative Disorders

Dissociation Presenting as a Mood Disorder
Most  of  the  patients  with  a  chronic  DD  suffer  from  a  concurrent 
depressive  disorder  which  tends  also  to  be  chronic.59,60  While  the 
frequent, even daily fluctuations of affect restrict the diagnosis to a 
dysthymic disorder, a superposed major depression episode (“dou-
ble depression”) may complicate the condition. The vast majority of 
the patients suffer from affect dysregulation. These daily changes in 
affectivity  constitute  almost  a  “dissociative  mood  disorder”  which 
may be erroneously perceived as a “bipolar disorder.”

Clinical Presentation: The age of onset of the depressive symptoms 
is unclear to vast majority of the patients. Clear-cut remission periods 
may not be identified either. The depressive mood of the patient may 
have an existential flavor. A study on Turkish women in the general 
population revealed that, compared to non-dissociative depression, 
those participants with concurrent depression and dissociation had 
thoughts  of  guilt  and  worthlessness,  concentration  difficulties, 
weight changes, and suicidal ideas more frequently.60 Şar proposed 
the term of “dissociative depression” to differentiate such conditions 
from a primary depressive disorder.59,60

Associated  Features:  In  the  same  epidemiological  study,  women 
with  dissociative  depression  reported  passive  influence  (including 
possession) in experiences resembling Schneiderian symptoms with 
borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  criteria  and  suicide  attempts, 
more  frequently  than  the  non-dissociative  depressive  group.  In  a 
European study, depressive patients with a childhood trauma history 
in  particular  reported  higher  dissociation  scores  in  the  form  of 
absorption and imaginative involvement.61

Geography: In cultures where self-expression and self-realization are 
rather restricted, dissociative depression may be more prevalent. The 
educational  deprivation  of  girls  as  a  predictor  of  dissociative 
depression  in  a  semi-rural  area  of Turkey  is  such  an  example.60 The 
prevalence of major depressive disorder accompanied by a DD was 
4.1%  among Turkish  women  in  the  general  population.60  A  type  of 
chronic depression due to dissociation is endemic in Japan (affecting 
more  than  one  million  individuals)  and  called  “hikikomori”  (social 
withdrawal).62  Representing  a  chronic  DD  composed  of  only  2 
personality states, this condition is characterized by sequestration of 
emotions (anger toward parents in particular) in a personality state 
ignored by the depleted “host” personality. In a series of 35 patients 
with  hikikomori,  71%  had  high  levels  of  dissociative  symptoms  in 
general,  26%  had  depersonalization,  and  23%  had  dissociative 
amnesia.63  In  this  series,  90%  of  the  patients  reported  parental 
neglect in childhood. In a Korean study on firefighters, the relationship 
between  posttraumatic  stress  symptoms  and  dissociation  was 
mediated by depression.64 In another Korean study on patients with 
a history of psychological trauma, depression alongside infrequency, 

hypomania,  and  hypochondriasis  scales  of  the  MMPI  correctly 
discriminated  86.8%  of  the  population  with  elevated  dissociation 
scores.65

Assessment, Differential Diagnosis, and Management: To identify a 
dissociative  depression,  the  clinician  should  first  recognize  the 
irregularity  of  the  depressive  mood.  The  onset  of  depressive 
symptoms  is  reported  to  be  early  in  life,  even  in  childhood.  The 
irregularity of depressive mood may be both due to the subtle shifts 
between personality states as well as the affect dysregulation which 
in 
characterizes  patients  with  developmental 
general.66  The  latter  phenomenon  should  not  be  confused  with 
cyclothymia  or  bipolar  disorder.  Namely,  mood  changes  of  the 
dissociative  patient  may  occur  instantly  and  may  hold  even  only  a 
few minutes if not hours. Patients may describe this as feeling “down” 
or  “up”  without  any  reason  suddenly.  These  changes  may  also  be 
triggered by external cues and also turn into anger or fear.

traumatization 

Such patients may be subsumed under the rubric of treatment-resis-
tant  depression  and  multiple  attempts  at  treatment  interventions 
may be exhausting for both the clinician and the patient. To prevent 
an eventual disappointment, the potential limits of drug treatment 
should  be  explained  to  the  patient  and  attendance  to  psychother-
apy  should  be  encouraged,  which  should  be  extended  beyond  an 
episode of major depression. This is crucial to prevent loss of hope, 
which  provokes  suicidal  ideas.  Dissociation  is  one  of  the  strongest 
predictors of multiple suicide attempts in the psychiatric outpatient 
population.67 The reason of suicidality cannot be well-articulated by 
the patient. From a qualitative perspective, the immense feeling of 
being oppressed “from within” is usually accompanied by thoughts 
of  death  or  suicidal  ideas,  whereas  completed  suicide  is  relatively 
uncommon  unless  the  condition  becomes  complicated  by  a  more 
pervasive  major  depressive  episode.59,68 The  latter  is  characterized 
by  the  presence  of  depressive  mood  across  a  vast  majority  of  dis-
tinct personality states of the patient and may be the main reason of 
psychiatric help-seeking due to the temporarily increased suffering. 
An episode of a pervasive major depression superposed to the DD 
and persistent dysthymia should not be overlooked and should be 
treated rather aggressively.

Dissociation Presenting as a Personality Disorder
While a DD may resemble or may be involved with any personality 
disorder, BPD is the one which has the most explicit relationship with 
DDs.69,70 The DSM-5 criteria of BPD cover transient dissociative symp-
toms  in  response  to  a  stressful  event.13  However,  the  scope  of  dis-
sociation exceeds the boundaries of this criterion in many of these 
patients.69-71 Subtle dissociative amnesias in these individuals may be 
difficult to identify by direct questions.72 Identity alterations unrecog-
nized by the clinician lead to a diagnosis of BPD rather than a DD.73

Clinical  Presentation:  Dissociative  conditions 
resembling  a 
personality  disorder  may  apply  by  means  of  suicidality  and  self-
mutilative  behavior.  Such  appearances  affect  a  relatively  young 
population  covering  adolescence  and  young  adulthood.  Switching 
between personality states carrying different moods may be subtle; 
for example, relatively identical personality states differing in mood 
are  not  uncommon  among  dissociative  children,  adolescents,  and 
young adults in particular.73

the 

influencing 

therapist–patient 

Associated  Features:  In  patients  having  a  condition  resembling  a 
personality disorder, dissociation is experienced in the interpersonal 
field  as  well, 
relationship 
immediately.  Due  to  a  prevailing  insecure  attachment  pattern, 
striving to control the relationship and testing the reliability of the 
therapist are common. Personality states related to angry emotions 
may  come  forward  frequently  to  control  the  relationship  with  the 
therapist. These patients usually suffer  from unstable  interpersonal 
relationships due to insecure attachment, mostly affecting intimacy 
and marriage.

Geography: In a college population in Turkey, 8.5 % of the students 
met the DSM-IV criteria of BPD, with 72.5% having a DD.70 In China, 
the frequency of BPD among psychiatric outpatients was 5.8%, with 
a  frequency  of  3.5%  among  males  and  7.5%  among  females.74  In 
Turkey, this rate was 10.4%.71 This study proves that BPD does occur 
in  China;  however,  the  detected  frequency  among  outpatients  is 
lower than that reported in North America and Turkey.

Assessment,  Differential  Diagnosis,  and  Management:  Covert 
switching in a dissociative patient may be interpreted by the therapist 
merely  as  a  transference-related  reaction  or  acting-out,  inspiring  a 
BPD diagnosis. Many of these patients may be diagnosed with other 
specific DD rather than DID because the experience of separateness 
between personality states is not evident and dissociative amnesias 
are difficult to identify even if they have occurred.

A  comparison  between Turkish  and  Dutch  patients  with  DID  dem-
onstrates  great  variability  between  2  groups  on  the  BPD  criteria 
fitted.  Turkish  patients  reported  intense  anger  and  lack  of  control 
over anger, chronic feelings of emptiness and boredom, and efforts 
to  avoid  abandonment  frequently,  whereas  this  was  valid  for  fre-
quent  mood  swings,  physically  self-damaging  acts,  identity  con-
fusion,  and  impulsive  and  unpredictable  behavior  among  Dutch 
patients.75 Among all criteria, only intense but unstable relationships 
did  not  differ  between  the  2  groups  representing  the  universality 
of insecure attachment on this spectrum. The differences, however, 
seem to originate from diversity in developmental traumatization as 
well as culturally shaped perception of selfhood as a personal and/or 
interpersonal experience.

The blurred boundary between BPD and DDs is not only important 
for making the accurate diagnosis but it also may have implications 
for  management  of  the  condition.  The  clinician  should  be  flexible 
in  approaching  such  conditions  before  referring  the  patient  to  a 
treatment program strictly shaped for BPD, which a predominantly 
dissociative  patient  may  not  be  able  to  adjust  to  unless  modified 
accordingly.76

Conclusion

The heterogeneity on the clinical surface of DDs requires a clinician’s 
skill to trace their core symptoms to arrive at an accurate diagnosis 
and  treatment.  While  the  core  symptoms  of  dissociation  may  be 
difficult  for  patients  to  articulate,  their  consequences  and  compli-
cations are more easily described.77 Thus, the culturally sensitive cli-
nician  should  be  able  to  pursue  the  traces  of  dissociation  not  only 
by  a  familiarity  with  the  culturally  shaped  communication  style  of 
the  patient  but  also  through  the  lens  of  a  fragmented  nosological 

appearance. Rather than constituting a hindrance and source of con-
fusion, the familiarity with the relationship between this nosological 
fragmentation and core dissociation may serve as a gateway to the 
well-informed clinician in grasping the truth behind the appearance, 
including the challenges of a cultural interface.
