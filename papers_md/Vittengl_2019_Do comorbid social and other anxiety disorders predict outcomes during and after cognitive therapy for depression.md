Abstract

Background.—Cognitive therapy (CT) improves symptoms in adults with major depressive 
disorder (MDD) plus comorbid anxiety disorder, but the specific type of anxiety may influence 
outcomes. This study compared CT outcomes among adults with MDD plus social, other, or no 
comorbid anxiety disorders.

Methods.—Outpatients with recurrent MDD (N=523, including 87 with social and 110 with 
other comorbid anxiety disorders) received acute-phase CT. Higher risk responders (n=241 with 
partial or unstable response) were randomized to 8 months of continuation treatment (CT or 
clinical management plus fluoxetine or pill placebo), followed by 24 months of assessment. Lower 
risk responders (n=49) were assessed for 32 months without additional research treatment. 
Depression, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance were measured repeatedly.

Results.—Other (non-social), but not social, anxiety disorders predicted elevated depression and 
anxiety symptoms throughout and after acute-phase CT. Social, but not other, anxiety disorder

predicted greater reduction in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT and elevated social 
avoidance during and after acute-phase CT.

Limitations.—Anxiety disorders were assessed only before acute-phase treatment. The anxiety 
symptom measure was brief. Generalization to other patient populations and treatments is 
unknown.

Conclusions.—Non-social comorbid anxiety disorders may reduce the efficacy of acute-phase 
CT for MDD by diminishing both short-and longer term outcomes relative to depressed patients 
without comorbid anxiety disorders. Comorbid social anxiety disorder may increase relative 
reductions in depressive symptoms during acute-phase CT for MDD, but patients with comorbid 
social anxiety disorder may require specialized focus on social avoidance during CT.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are often comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD; Kessler et al., 
2005; Kessler et al., 2015). Relations of comorbid anxiety disorders with MDD treatment 
outcomes are incompletely understood, although augmenting or sequencing medications or 
psychotherapies in varying combinations have been suggested for particular comorbid 
disorders (e.g., Coplan et al., 2015; Schoevers et al., 2008). The current study clarified short-
and longer-term prognoses of outpatients who received cognitive therapy (CT) for recurrent 
MDD, comparing patients with social, other, or no comorbid anxiety disorders (Jarrett & 
Thase, 2010). These findings may expand the CT literature by differentiating social from 
other anxiety disorders and inform need for additional assessment and treatment.

Comorbid anxiety often predicts poorer outcomes during treatment of MDD, but prognoses 
may vary by types of treatment, as well as particular anxiety disorder diagnoses or 
symptoms (Schaffer et al., 2012). The literature is perhaps clearest for acute-phase 
pharmacotherapy, during which comorbid anxiety has often (but not always) predicted less 
response and remission and more relapse (e.g., Andreescu et al., 2007; Fava et al., 2008; 
Saveanu et al., 2015), and also greater psychosocial dysfunction despite increased 
medication prescription (Petersen et al., 2009). Anxiety has also predicted poorer outcomes 
in continuation pharmacotherapy or CT for depression employed in treatment augmentation 
or switch strategies (Farabaugh et al., 2012).

A smaller, inconsistent literature addresses comorbid anxiety during acute-phase CT (A-CT) 
for depression. A recent meta-analysis showed that psychotherapy for depression improved 
symptoms of both depression and anxiety compared to control conditions, with moderate-to-
large effect sizes for both sets of symptoms (Weitz, et al., 2018). In addition, anxiety 
symptoms among patients with MDD have predicted more severe depression at intake and 
quicker reduction in depressive symptoms during CT (Forand et al., 2011; Forand et al., 
2013; Smits et al., 2012). However, anxiety symptoms have also predicted lower rates of 
response and remission and more frequent relapse after response to A-CT (Forand et al.,

2013; Smits et al., 2012). Similarly, anxiety symptoms have predicted delayed remission 
during interpersonal psychotherapy for MDD (Frank et al., 2011) and may become more 
closely tied to depression as time in treatment progresses (Wright et al., 2014). Finally, 
depressed patients with comorbid anxiety had better acute-phase outcomes when treated 
with CT compared to interpersonal psychotherapy; however the difference was not sustained 
afterward (van Bronswijk et al., 2018).

Rather than anxiety symptoms, other studies focused on anxiety disorder diagnoses. Among 
the anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder has especially strong theoretico-empirical 
connections to depression. Many anxiety disorders (e.g., social anxiety disorder, generalized 
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia) share with depression elevations in non-
specific negative emotionality. However, unlike other anxiety disorders, social anxiety 
disorder also shares with depression substantially reduced positive emotionality (Adams et 
al., 2016; Brown et al., 1998; Langer & Rodebaugh, 2014; Watson, Clark, & Carey, 1988; 
Watson, Gamez, & Simms, 2005). Cognitive therapy for depression targets both negative 
(e.g., via restructuring of negative automatic thoughts to reduce distress in response to 
internal and external stimuli) and positive (e.g., via behavioral activation to increase 
engagement with sources of reinforcement) emotionality (Beck et al., 1979). Because of 
stronger match of MDD with social versus other anxiety disorders in emotionality, and 
because CT for depression targets both positive and negative emotionality, MDD patients 
with comorbid social anxiety disorder may show better outcomes during CT for depression 
than do patients with other comorbid anxiety disorders.

Diagnosis of comorbid social anxiety disorder predicted more depressive symptoms after A-
CT for MDD in one study, but with a small effect size and at a trend level of statistical 
significance (DeRubeis et al. 2005). Another study, however, found no evidence of less 
completion, response, remission, or rate of improvement in depressive symptoms among 
patients with comorbid social anxiety disorder receiving A-CT for MDD (Smits et al., 2009). 
Moreover, although comorbid anxiety disorders in general predict poorer long-term 
outcomes among individuals with MDD, many analyses, including those reported on by 
DeRubeis et al. and Smits et al., have not differentiated particular anxiety disorder diagnoses 
(Burcusa & Iacono, 2007).

In this context and to move the literature forward, the current study compared CT outcomes 
by type of anxiety disorder through secondary analyses of a clinical trial dataset (N = 523; 
Jarrett & Thase, 2010). The size and distribution of comorbid anxiety disorders in this 
dataset (see Table 1) supported differentiation of social from other (non-social) anxiety 
disorders. We tested the hypothesis that comorbid anxiety disorders, particularly other (non-
social) compared to social anxiety disorders, predict poorer depression outcomes in A-CT 
for recurrent MDD (i.e., higher depressive symptoms and less frequent response) and for 32 
months after A-CT response (i.e., higher depressive symptoms and more frequent relapse/
recurrence). Parallel to this hypothesis about depression outcomes, we tested whether 
anxiety disorders predicted anxiety symptoms and social avoidance, which may be more 
specific consequences of these comorbid diagnoses, during and after response to A-CT for 
recurrent MDD. Thus, our analyses clarified how social versus other anxiety disorders 
predict several outcomes to inform efforts to increase CT’s efficacy.

Method

Participants

Page 4

Data were drawn from a randomized clinical trial detailed by Jarrett and Thase (2010) and 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00118404, NCT00183664, and NCT00218764). We 
summarize below methods relevant to the current analyses.

Participants (N = 523) were outpatients who (a) provided written informed consent; (b) met 
DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) assessed with 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 
1996); (c) had remitted between prior depressive episodes, ≥ 1 depressive episode with 
complete inter-episode recovery, or antecedent dysthymic disorder; and (d) scored ≥ 14 on 
the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD; Hamilton, 1960).1 Exclusion 
criteria were (a) severe or poorly controlled concurrent medical disorders that could cause 
depression, (b) psychotic or organic mental disorders, bipolar disorder, active substance 
dependence, or primary obsessive-compulsive or eating disorders, (c) could not complete 
questionnaires in English, (d) active suicide risk, (e) < 18 or > 70 years old, (f) previous 
failure to respond to ≥ 8 weeks of CT or 6 weeks of fluoxetine, or (g) pregnancy, current or 
planned during the first 11 months after intake.

The SCID was administered and scored by trained evaluators (nurses, psychologists, or 
research associates). In addition to MDD, other DSM-IV disorders were diagnosed using the 
SCID. In the current analyses, we focused on the subset of DSM-IV anxiety disorders that 
remained classified as anxiety disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 
2013). Diagnosed anxiety disorders are listed in Table 1, and other patient characteristics are 
summarized in Table 2. Supplement 1 depicts the flow of participants through the study 
phases described following.

Acute-phase CT

Consenting patients (N = 523) withdrew from any psychotropic medications before CT. The 
cognitive therapists (12 doctoral, 4 masters-level; 12 women, 4 men) completed ≥ 1 year of 
supervised training in CT and demonstrated competence by maintaining Cognitive Therapy 
Scale (Young & Beck, 1980) mean scores ≥ 40. Therapists submitted videotaped sessions for 
review, participated in weekly group supervision, and received feedback. The acute-phase 
protocol lasted 12 weeks, with 2 additional weeks allowed for rescheduling. Patients 
received two CT sessions per week for 4 weeks. Then, patients with ≥ 40% reduction in 
HRSD scores received 8 additional weekly sessions (16 total sessions), whereas patients 
with < 40% reduction in HRSD scores received eight additional twice-weekly then four 
weekly sessions (20 total sessions).2 Patients with less early improvement received more 
sessions to increase their chances of response, defined as no MDD and HRSD ≤ 12 by 
independent evaluation at the end of A-CT. Responders were stratified by a priori criteria 

1Two patients entered CT erroneously with HRSD = 13 at one of two diagnostic visits. During CT, one of these patients responded 
and one dropped out. As recommended by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), the patients are analyzed here as they were 
treated during data collection.
2Four patients were incorrectly assigned to 16 or 20 session protocols. As recommended by the DSMB, they are analyzed here as they 
were treated during data collection.

into lower risk (the last 7 acute-phase HRSD scores all ≤ 6) and higher risk (≥1 of the last 7 
acute-phase HRSD scores ≥7) groups.

Continuation Phase

Higher risk A-CT responders (n = 241) were randomized to 8 months of continuation-phase 
CT (n = 86) or to clinical management with either fluoxetine (n = 86) or pill placebo (n = 
69).3 A blinded evaluator assessed patients at the ends of months 4 and 8 (and during 
interims if relapse was suspected) for DSM-IV criteria for MDD using the SCID and the 
Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (Keller et al., 1987). Lower risk A-CT 
responders (n = 49) were assessed on the same schedule but did not receive additional 
protocol treatment. Patients who relapsed were referred for non-research treatment.

The continuation CT protocol included 10 sessions (four biweekly then six monthly 
sessions) of approximately 60 minutes each (Jarrett et al., 1989; Jarrett, Vittengl, & Clark, 
2008). Continuation CT patients applied compensatory skills to residual and emergent 
depressive symptoms; generalized CT skills across problems, time, and situation; and 
practiced preemptive coping to cognitive and behavioral risks identified previously. Patients’ 
acute and continuation CT therapists were the same, with few exceptions (e.g., due to a 
therapist’s maternity leave).

The fluoxetine and pill-placebo clinical-management protocol (Fawcett et al., 1987) was 
double blinded, provided by experienced pharmacotherapists, and included 10 sessions on 
the same schedule as continuation CT. The first session lasted up to 45 minutes and 
remaining sessions up to 30 minutes. Pharmacotherapists were prohibited from using any 
specific continuation CT methods. Research pharmacies dispensed active fluoxetine or 
identical placebo capsules. Patients first received 10 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 20 mg/day for 
2 weeks, and 40 mg/day thereafter. Pharmacotherapists were allowed to decrease doses to 
lessen side effects. Patients who could not tolerate at least 10 mg/day were removed from 
medication and received only clinical management. Most patients (73%) achieved the target 
dose of 40 mg/day (Jarrett et al., 2013). All randomized patients are analyzed here.

Follow-up Phase

Patients completing the continuation phase entered a 24-month follow-up. Blinded 
evaluators assessed patients every 4 months. Patients experiencing depressive symptoms 
were encouraged to contact study personnel for interim evaluation. Patients were referred 
out for treatment in the event of relapse or recurrence.

Measures

Depression symptoms.—Patients completed the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI; Beck et al., 1961) and 30-item Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology self-report 
(IDS-SR; Rush et al., 1996), and clinicians completed the 17-item HRSD. Because these 
measures reflect the same construct during treatment of depression (Vittengl, Clark, Kraft, & 

3Three non-responders were randomized in error. As recommended by the DSMB, they are analyzed here as they were treated during 
data collection. Also, during the final years of randomization, allocation to placebo was reduced to increase the proportions of patients 
randomly assigned to the two depression-specific treatments.

Jarrett, 2005; Vittengl et al., 2013), we standardized (M = 50, SD = 10) the measures’ total 
scores based on their distributions at acute-phase intake and averaged them to form a robust 
composite, after excluding 4 items directly referencing anxiety symptoms (detailed 
subsequently). Higher scores indicated more severe depressive symptomatology. Treating 
the three scales as items, alpha reliability for the depression composite was high in the 
current sample (.96).4

Anxiety symptoms.—Two items each on the HRSD (“psychic anxiety,” “somatic 
anxiety”) and IDS-SR (“feeling tense or anxious,” “panic/phobic symptoms”) referenced 
anxiety directly. These item ratings were standardized as the percentage of maximum 
possible score (HRSD items were rated 0–4, whereas IDS-SR items were rated 0–3) and 
averaged to form an anxiety scale. Alpha reliability for the 4-item anxiety scale was 
moderate in the current dataset (.73; average inter-item r = .42, within the recommended 
range; Clark & Watson, 1995).

Social avoidance.—Patients completed the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems 
(Horowitz et al., 1988) to measure problematic behaviors, thoughts, and feelings in social 
relationships. We scored an eight-item subscale reflecting social avoidance (Horowitz et al., 
2000) because social avoidance is central to social anxiety disorder. Higher scores reflect 
greater social avoidance. Alpha reliability for the social avoidance subscale (.89) was high in 
the current sample.

Completion and response.—Completion of A-CT was defined as missing no more than 
two CT sessions in the 16-or 20-session protocol described above. Acute-phase response 
was defined as no longer meeting criteria for MDD and having a final acute-phase HRSD 
score ≤ 12.

Relapse and recurrence.—Independent evaluators completed the Longitudinal Interval 
Follow-Up Evaluation (Keller et al., 1987) every 4 months after A-CT, at study exit, and 
when patients, therapists, or follow-up evaluators suspected major depressive relapse or 
recurrence. This semi-structured retrospective interview yielded weekly psychiatric status 
ratings of DSM-IV MDD. Ratings of 1 (no MDD symptoms) or 2 (one or two mild 
symptoms) for ≥ 35 continuous weeks defined recovery. Ratings of 5 (meets MDD criteria) 
or 6 (meets MDD criteria with severe impairment and/or psychosis) for ≥ 2 weeks defined 
relapse and recurrence before and after recovery, respectively (Jarrett & Thase, 2010). 
Patients who relapsed or recurred were censored at that point for survival analyses.

Related Previous Analyses

In previous analyses of the current dataset, anxiety symptoms (measured with HRSD items) 
predicted greater severity and faster improvement in depressive symptoms but less response 
and remission during A-CT (Smits et al., 2012). Beyond anxiety symptoms, the current 
analyses focused on formal anxiety-disorder diagnoses as predictors of outcomes, 

4We computed alpha internal consistency reliability estimates after pooling data across time points because measures had restricted 
ranges at some points in the clinical trial (e.g., pre-treatment when all patients had MDD).

contrasting social with other anxiety disorders. In addition, the current analyses extended the 
time frame to consider outcomes in A-CT plus 32 subsequent months for responders.

During the first 8 months after A-CT, continuation CT or fluoxetine reduced relapse and 
residual depressive symptoms compared to pill placebo among higher risk acute-phase 
responders (Jarrett et al., 2013; Vittengl et al., 2014). In addition, lower versus higher risk 
patients were less likely to experience relapse during the continuation phase (Jarrett et al, 
2016). Finally, gains in social-interpersonal functioning made during acute-phase CT were 
maintained for 32 months among higher-risk responders but not further improved by 
continuation treatment (Vittengl et al., 2016). In this context, we controlled but did not 
report differences among continuation-phase arms here.

Analyses Testing the Current Hypotheses and Research Questions

We predicted A-CT response and completion using logistic regression models, and we 
described effect sizes using the odds ratio. Among A-CT responders, we predicted time to 
relapse over the 8 month continuation phase, and relapse or recurrence over the 8 month 
continuation plus 24 month follow-up phases (32 total months), using Cox regression 
models with the hazard ratio as a measure of effect size. In the Cox regression models, 
patients were censored when they first exited the study, experienced relapse or recurrence, or 
completed the follow-up phase. During A-CT, and after A-CT among responders, we 
predicted depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance using repeated-
measures multilevel linear models employing maximum likelihood estimation, 
autoregressive error structures, and the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom. 
In multilevel models, effect size d was estimated as the difference in least-squares estimated 
means divided by the outcome variable’s SD at acute-phase intake.

Statistical models used to test hypotheses controlled a number of variables to isolate the 
effects of social and other anxiety disorders. All models controlled patient age, gender, 
ethnicity, years of education, and age of MDD onset. In addition, all models controlled 
depressive symptom severity at intake, except models of acute-phase depressive symptom 
severity that already included this variable. Post-acute-phase models also controlled 
continuation-phase arm (dummy coded: lower risk—assessment only, higher risk—
continuation CT, higher risk—continuation fluoxetine, or higher-risk—continuation pill 
placebo with clinical management). Finally, repeated-measures multilevel models included 
the effect of time (dummy coded, during A-CT: pre-, mid-, or post-CT; after A-CT: 
continuation phase, follow-up year 1 or 2).

For hypothesis tests, the fixed effects of interest were the main effects of anxiety disorder 
diagnoses (dummy coded: the presence or absence of any anxiety disorder; or the presence 
or absence of social anxiety disorder and other anxiety disorders). Because main effects of 
social and other anxiety disorders were entered simultaneously in the statistical models, 
results reflected the diagnostic variables’ unique relations with outcomes. In the multilevel 
models, we also tested interactions of anxiety disorders with time and trimmed non-
significant interactions (p > .05) from final models to clarify main effects. We did not test 
interactions of social with other anxiety disorders, or anxiety disorders with continuation-
phase arm, because we had no a priori hypotheses about these interactions and interaction

tests would have relied on some small cell sizes (e.g., as few as 7 patients during 
continuation and 2 during follow-up phases).

Acute-phase response and completion data were complete in logistic regression models. A 
strength of Cox regression models is that they accurately handle patients with censored data, 
such as when patients exited the study before a relapse or recurrence event (e.g., Cohen et 
al., 2003). A strength of repeated-measures multilevel models with maximum likelihood 
estimation is that they support valid inferences when data are missing completely at random 
or missing for reasons predictable from variables included in the model (e.g., Schafer & 
Graham, 2002).

Preliminary Analyses

At intake to A-CT, correlations of depressive symptom severity with anxiety symptoms (.43) 
and social avoidance (.35), and between anxiety symptoms and social avoidance (.16), were 
statistically significant, ps < .001, but small-moderate in size. Similarly, acute-phase pre/post 
change correlations of depressive symptom severity with anxiety symptoms (.59) and social 
avoidance (.42), and between anxiety symptoms and social avoidance (.35), were 
statistically significant, ps < .001, and moderate in size. Thus, these three variables tapped 
related but partly distinct information about the current sample of patients with recurrent 
MDD.

To examine missing data patterns, we tallied the number of missing data points during the 
acute-phase, and after the acute phase for A-CT responders, among the depressive symptom, 
anxiety symptom, and social avoidance scales. Spearman correlations of any comorbid 
anxiety disorder, depressive symptom severity, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance at 
intake with the number of missing data points were small (median rs = .10, range −.03 to .
15). Statistically significant (p < .05) correlates of missing data included an anxiety disorder 
(.11), depressive symptoms (.14), and anxiety symptoms (.10) during the acute phase, and an 
anxiety disorder (.13) and depressive symptoms (.15) after the acute phase. However, the 
other statistically significant correlates of missing data became non-significant when 
depressive symptom severity at intake was partialled. Consequently, depressive symptom 
severity at intake appeared central to the pattern of missing data was included in all 
hypothesis-testing models.

Results

Patient Characteristics at Study Intake

Table 1 shows frequencies of anxiety disorders comorbid with recurrent MDD at intake to 
A-CT. The majority of patients (67.9%) had no comorbid anxiety disorder, but substantial 
subgroups had comorbid social anxiety disorder (16.6%) and/or other comorbid anxiety 
disorders (21.0%). The correlation between social and other anxiety disorder diagnoses was 
small but statistically significant (phi = .13, p = .004). A few patients (5.5%) had both social 
and other anxiety disorder diagnoses. All patients were included in the analyses.

Table 2 shows demographic and illness information. Gender, marital/partnered status, length 
of MDD, number of major depressive episodes, and length of the current depressive at intake

did not relate significantly to anxiety disorder diagnoses. Patients with social or other 
anxiety disorders had about one more total Axis I diagnosis than did patients without 
comorbid anxiety disorders, as would be expected. Compared to patients without comorbid 
anxiety disorders, patients with social anxiety disorder were younger, had less formal 
education, an earlier age of MDD onset, and more severe depressive symptoms, anxiety 
symptoms, and social avoidance at intake. Similarly, compared to patients without comorbid 
anxiety disorders, patients with other anxiety disorders had less education plus more severe 
depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance at intake, and were less often 
of white ethnicity. However, anxiety symptoms were higher among patients with other 
versus social anxiety disorders, whereas social avoidance was higher among patients with 
social versus other anxiety disorders at intake.

Acute-phase CT

Our hypothesis tests first predicted outcomes from any anxiety disorder. We then 
differentiated social and other anxiety disorders. On average across the acute phase, patients 
with any versus no anxiety disorder had more depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and 
social avoidance (see Table 3).

However, results varied by type of anxiety disorder (Table 3). Compared to patients with no 
anxiety disorder, those with social anxiety disorder did not show significant elevations in 
depressive or anxiety symptoms, overall, but did have greater social avoidance. In contrast, 
compared to patients with no anxiety disorder, patients with other anxiety disorders showed 
significant elevations in anxiety and depression symptoms but not social avoidance. Finally, 
patients with social anxiety disorder had fewer anxiety and depression symptoms, but more 
social avoidance, than patients with other anxiety disorders.

The main effect of social/other/no anxiety disorder on depression severity was qualified by a 
significant interaction with time, as illustrated in Figure 1. From pre- to post-A-CT, patients 
with social anxiety disorder improved more than did patients with other (d = 0.49, CI95% 
0.06 to 0.92) or no (d = 0.40, CI95% 0.04 to 0.75) anxiety disorders. Improvement did not 
differ significantly between patients with other versus no anxiety disorders (d = −0.09, 
CI95% −0.43 to 0.24). Post-A-CT, patients with other anxiety disorders had higher 
depression severity than patients with no (d = 0.51, CI95% 0.22 to 0.81) or social (d = 0.67, 
CI95% 0.29 to 1.05) anxiety disorder, but patients with social versus no anxiety disorder did 
not differ significantly (d= −0.16, CI95% −0.47 to 0.16).

Finally, we tested whether anxiety disorders predicted A-CT completion and response (Table 
4). Completion or response did not differ significantly by any/no or social/other/no anxiety 
disorder.

Responders after Acute-phase CT

Pre-acute-phase anxiety disorders were tested as predictors of outcomes for 32 months after 
response to A-CT. On average for 32 months after response to acute-phase CT, patients with 
any versus no anxiety disorder had more anxiety symptoms and more social avoidance but 
did not differ in level of depressive symptoms (Table 5).

Similar to the acute phase, results varied by type of anxiety disorder. Responders with social 
anxiety disorder had greater social avoidance, but did not have significantly more depression 
or anxiety symptoms, compared to responders with no anxiety disorder. Responders with 
other versus no anxiety disorders had greater depression and anxiety symptoms but not more 
social avoidance. Finally, responders with other versus social anxiety disorder had more 
anxiety and depression symptoms, but not social avoidance (Table 5).

Finally, we predicted time to MDD relapse during the continuation phase (8 months) and 
relapse/recurrence during the continuation plus follow-up phases (32 total months). Any/
noor social/other/no anxiety disorders did not predict relapse or recurrence among A-CT 
responders (Table 4).

Discussion

The current analyses clarified the potential impact of comorbid social and other (i.e., non-
social) anxiety disorders on treatment of MDD with A-CT. Other anxiety disorders predicted 
more depressive and anxiety symptoms throughout A-CT and for 32 months after A-CT 
response, on average. In contrast, social anxiety disorder did not predict increased 
depression or anxiety symptoms during A-CT or for the 32 months following acute-phase 
response. Instead, social anxiety disorder predicted larger decreases in depression symptoms 
during A-CT. Even so, social anxiety disorder predicted higher social avoidance throughout 
A-CT that persisted for 32 months among A-CT responders. Anxiety disorders did not 
predict categorical A-CT completion, response, or subsequent relapse/recurrence.

Other comorbid anxiety disorders in the current sample (primarily specific phobias, panic 
disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder) presented a serious challenge during CT for 
depression. Patients with other anxiety disorders had elevated depressive symptoms both 
pre-and post-CT, compared to patients without comorbid anxiety disorders. This result 
matches past studies showing that comorbid anxiety reduced efficacy of antidepressants 
(e.g., Fava et al., 2008; Saveanu et al. 2015) and interpersonal psychotherapy (van Bronswijk 
et al., 2018). Our finding that comorbid anxiety disorders did not predict completion of CT 
for depression also replicated past research (Smits et al., 2009; Forand et al., 2011) and 
suggested that cognitive therapists engaged these patients successfully.

Engagement in CT may provide a platform to improve treatment of depression with 
comorbid anxiety. For example, clinicians who provide CT for depression may need to focus 
more on homework or action plans involving exposure for anxious patients. Additionally, 
transdiagnostic psychotherapies focusing on core processes underlying anxiety and 
depression hold potential for improved outcomes by flexibly addressing individual patients’ 
strengths and weaknesses (Barlow et al., 2017; Titov et al., 2015). These core processes may 
include both positive (extraversion) and negative (neuroticism or low emotional stability) 
emotionality that are improved moderately in several types of psychotherapy (Roberts et al., 
2017). Although current substance dependence was an exclusionary criterion in the current 
clinical trial, “self-medication” with alcohol or other substances may also need to be 
addressed in some patients with depression and comorbid anxiety (Howland et al., 2009; 
Windle et al., 2012). Finally, functional analysis that was central to “first and second wave”

behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapists’ practice (Ferster, 1973) provided an 
empirical platform for tailoring treatment to individual patients’ behaviors (e.g., marked by 
comorbid diagnoses), but may have been deemphasized during the field’s more recent 
dissemination of disorder-specific protocols. Perhaps new technologies can be developed to 
assist cognitive behavioral therapists with incorporating functional analyses more fully into 
their daily practice.

Although comorbid social anxiety disorder did not hinder depression outcomes in CT, the 
current findings suggest that patients with MDD plus comorbid social anxiety disorder 
receiving CT for depression may need additional treatment for social avoidance. Focusing 
on anxiety during CT for depression is one option, but a process study suggested that doing 
may hamper reduction of both depression and anxiety (Gibbons & DeRubeis, 2008). Instead, 
increased therapeutic focus on avoidance behavior (e.g., through activity scheduling in CT, 
including pleasant social activities) might help comorbid patients resolve a “behavioral trap” 
in which coping with actual or perceived threats of social exclusion by withdrawing is 
negatively reinforcing in the short-term but in the long-run amplifies negative emotion and 
dampens positive emotion (Langer & Rodebaugh, 2014 ). Thus, whether CT for depression 
can be augmented in focus, length, or other parameters to address comorbid social avoidance 
more fully and effectively, or whether parallel or sequential treatment is needed for social 
avoidance, are questions requiring empirical clarification.

Patients with comorbid social anxiety disorder had higher depressive symptoms initially but 
greater reductions in depressive symptoms during A-CT, replicating past research on 
comorbid anxiety symptoms (Forand et al. 2011; Forand et al., 2013) but not social anxiety 
disorder (Smits et al., 2009). Whether the difference between the current study and Smits et 
al. (2009) regarding greater change in depressive symptoms with social anxiety disorder is 
due to sampling error or some unknown systematic factor (e.g., subtypes of social anxiety or 
depression) would be an important topic for future research. It is worth noting, for example, 
that Smits et al (2009) simply compared those with comorbid versus those without comorbid 
social anxiety disorder without considering or controlling for different anxiety disorder 
diagnoses. Assuming patients with comorbid social anxiety disorder do experience greater/
faster reduction in depressive symptoms during CT for depression, possible explanations 
might be profitably tested in future research. For example, anxious physiological arousal 
possibly increases activity level and engagement during CT (Forand et al., 2011), and/or CT 
might be a better therapeutic “fit” for patients with more strongly decreased positive and 
increased negative emotionality common to social anxiety and depression (Watson et al., 
2005).

Limitations

The current analyses have important limitations. First, assessment of anxiety disorders 
occurred only before A-CT and not again after response. Consequently, how many patients 
remitted from anxiety disorders during A-CT and before post-acute data were collected is 
unknown. Further, inter-rater reliability for anxiety disorder diagnoses was not evaluated in 
the current clinical trial focused on recurrent MDD. Second, the measure of anxiety 
symptoms was brief, derived from depression scales, and not designed for the current

Conclusions

analytic purposes. Future research using psychometrically stronger, more nuanced measures 
of depression and anxiety chosen a priori may yield greater insights into treatment issues 
identified here (e.g., Kessler et al., 2017; Watson et al., 2007). Third, future research with 
larger samples might allow finer differentiation of other (non-social) anxiety disorders (e.g., 
generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia), their impact on A-CT outcomes, 
and interactions of anxiety disorders with continuation treatments for A-CT responders. 
Finally, generalization of the current findings beyond outpatient adults with recurrent MDD 
who displayed a specific pattern of comorbidity and were treated by expert cognitive 
therapists is unknown. For example, the study recruited patients who sought CT as first-line 
treatment for depression, but this group may or may not vary in important ways from 
patients seeking pharmacotherapy.

Studying comorbidity that influences CT’s efficacy may inform efforts to improve treatment 
outcomes. Our findings suggest that the influence of comorbid anxiety disorders on the 
efficacy of CT for patients presenting with recurrent depression may vary depending on the 
specific anxiety disorder. Anxiety symptoms improved notably during CT for depression in 
the current dataset, consistent with past research (Weitz et al., 2018). Nonetheless, further 
improving anxiety and depression outcomes through personalized or precision medicine 
(Simon & Perlis, 2010) may require modifying, augmenting, tailoring a focus to comorbid 
symptoms or underlying processes (i.e., core perceived threats, maladaptive safety/avoidance 
behaviors), or sequencing CT for depression with comorbid social or other anxiety disorders. 
The current findings present some initial guidance in these efforts by addressing patient 
outcomes in A-CT and 32 months after response.

Cognitive therapy (CT) for major depressive disorder (MDD) is often helpful.

We predicted outcomes for CT patients with MDD plus anxiety disorders.

Social anxiety disorder did not limit depression outcomes during or after CT.

Other anxiety disorders predicted more depression symptoms during and after 
CT.

Modified treatment may improve outcomes for MDD with other anxiety 
disorders.

Axis I diagnoses), or linear (remaining continuous variables) regression models. When the omnibus test for a row yielded p < .05, pairwise 
contrasts were computed and means or proportions without a common superscript varied at p < .05, two-tailed.

models. Anxiety disorders and time period were dummy coded (1 = present, 0 = absent) and centered. Non-significant (p > .05) interactions of 
anxiety disorders and time period were trimmed from the final models. CT = acute-phase cognitive therapy. CI = confidence interval.

Models controlled depressive symptom severity at study intake, age, age of depression onset, education, ethnicity, and gender; and models 5–8 also 
controlled continuation-phase arm (lower risk responders received no continuation treatment; higher risk responders were randomized to 8 months 
of cognitive therapy, or clinical management with fluoxetine or pill placebo). Effect sizes for models 1–4 and 5–8 are odds ratios and hazard ratios, 
respectively. CI = confidence interval.
