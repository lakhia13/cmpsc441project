Generalized anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent mental disorder. Previous data indicate that more
than 18 million Brazilians suffer from this condition. Traditionally, generalized anxiety disorder has
been considered a mild mental health disorder, despite its links to lower
life expectancy,
cardiovascular disease, and suicide. The aim of this article is to combine elements of systematic
and critical reviews to produce a synthesis of the best evidence about generalized anxiety disorder
treatment. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials were included. The
descriptor used in the search was ‘‘generalized anxiety disorder,’’ which resulted in 4,860 articles and
seven other studies, of which 59 were selected. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines were indicated,
as was pregabalin, and atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, have been studied. Individual
cognitive behavior therapy (third wave) has proven effective. There is extensive literature on many
effective treatments for generalized anxiety disorder. The present review summarizes the therapeutic
possibilities, emphasizing those available in Brazil. Further studies are needed to compare other
available medications, assess psychotherapies and new treatments in greater depth, as well as to
assess the ideal duration of therapy.

Introduction

Anxiety is a normal response to stressful situations, but it
is diagnosed as a pathological problem when it becomes
severe and uncontrollable. Generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD) is a group of anxiety or fear-related disorders
characterized by persistent anxiety symptoms lasting X 6
months, manifesting as general apprehension (i.e., ‘‘free-
ﬂoating anxiety’’) or excessive worry about
routine
activities.1,2 Most often, anxiety is focused on academic
or professional performance,
family, health, ﬁnances,
school or work, and can involve additional symptoms,
restlessness, sympathetic
such as muscle tension,

autonomic hyperactivity, nervousness, difﬁculty maintain-
ing concentration, irritability, fatigue, and sleep disturb-
ances.1,2 These symptoms are neither a sign of another
health condition nor the result of a chemical or drug that
affects the central nervous system. GAD may co-occur
illnesses, including different forms of
with other mental
anxiety, unipolar depression, drug use disorders, beha-
vior disorder, psychosis, and neurodevelopmental and
neurocognitive abnormalities.1,2

The overall GAD prevalence has been reported at
4.5%, being lower in low- and middle-income countries
(2.8%)
than high-income countries (5.3%); 34.6% of
respondents with lifetime GAD reported receiving

income countries (19.2%) than high-income countries
(38.4%). The World Health Organization considers GAD a
public health issue in Brazil. GAD affects 18 million
Brazilians, or 9.3% of the population. Between 55 and
60% of GAD patients are women.3 Anxiety symptoms are
also a risk factor for myocardial
infarction and other
illnesses.4 Additionally, there is a signiﬁcant correlation
between GAD and suicidal behavior.5

We used the PICO (‘‘patient/population,’’

‘‘control/comparison,’’ and ‘‘result’’) search
strategy to identify studies for inclusion. Men, women, and
children with GAD (participants) who were treated with
pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy (interventions), using
different comparators (placebo or other interventions),
were eligible for inclusion. The outcome was a reduction

excluded.

Keywords were determined using Medical Subject
Headings in PubMed. We searched for articles published
in any language using the keywords ‘‘generalized anxiety
disorder’’ AND ‘‘treatment,’’ which resulted in 4,860
articles and another seven studies. We used efﬁcacy
(i.e., symptom reduction) as the main outcome. We
removed the publication time criterion, accepting older
studies in order to assess important treatment strategies
not addressed in more recent publications. Other pub-
lications were used to support the Introduction, Methods,
and Discussion. This process was performed by two
authors (ABP and AFP). In case of disagreement, a third
party (LR) performed a new evaluation.

We included meta-analyses or systematic reviews that
analyzed randomized clinical
trials focusing on GAD
treatment among male and female patients. We used

RCT and other study types only when there was
inconclusive data from meta-analyses or systematic
reviews. The exclusion criteria were observational stu-
dies, case reports and series, editorials, non-systematic
reviews, studies with fewer than 20 participants, insufﬁ-
cient data, and poor statistical analysis, as well as studies
with selection bias,
insufﬁcient sample size, statistical
bias, or risk of bias in the synthesis or the review that
compromised interpretation of the data. Studies with high
or unclear bias according to Risk of Bias VISualisation (for
systematic reviews)10-12 and the Cochrane Bias Risk
Assessment (RoB 2) tool12-14 were also excluded.

Information sources

MEDLINE (via PubMed), SciELO, and the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews were searched.

Selection criteria (screening)

The selection process was performed independently by
two reviewers (ABP and AFP) using the Rayyan (https://
www.rayyan.ai) selection platform (http://www.rayyan.ai).
There were some difﬁculties evaluating the results,
especially assesseing GAD when diagnosed using
different sets of criteria, assessing and monitoring GAD
in different contexts with different criteria and instruments,
and some studies analyzed interventions in a small
number of patients. As a result, the following criteria were
established: 1) GAD studies in children, adolescents,
adults, or older adults; 2) male or female samples only;
and 3) objective response assessment, either according
to symptom reduction or an objective scale. Of the 438
initially selected abstracts, 323 were rejected, leaving 155
reports for retrieval (Figure 1 presents the study selection
ﬂowchart).

Data collection process (eligibility)

ABP and AFP analyzed 52 full-text articles and another
seven manuscripts for eligibility. The selected articles
were read in full; only those fulﬁlling the inclusion/
exclusion criteria and without signiﬁcant bias were
included.

Data items (outcomes)

The main outcome was treatment efﬁcacy (symptom
reduction X 50% according to the scale used during
treatment). The most common instrument was the
Hamilton Anxiety Scale in adults and older adults, with
post-treatment score reduction being the response
criterion. Other instruments included the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale and the Clinical Global Impression
Severity Scale. Several scales were used for children,
including the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, the Hamilton
Anxiety Scale, the Social Anxiety Scale for Children, the
Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory, and the Kiddie
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia.

Synthesis and evidence

In the evidence synthesis process, all authors read
the relevant articles in full, then critically analyzed the
evidence, extracted the results, and categorized the
strength of
the evidence. The levels of evidence and
recommendation grades were chosen in accordance with
Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 criteria
(see https://www.cebm.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/
CEBM-Levels-of-Evidence-2.1.pdf).

Results

Tables 1 and 2 show the main recommendations for
pharmacological treatment (Table 1) and psychotherapy
(Table 2). Figure 2 shows the main recommendations of
this guideline. Risk of bias tables were inserted as
supplemental material
in Tables S1, S2, and S3, and
the summary of all results based on the PICO framework
and level of evidence is shown in the supplemental
material (Tables S4 and S5 – all available online-only).

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

Adults. Medications considered efﬁcacious were sertra-
line,16,17 paroxetine,16-18 and escitalopram (level 1 evi-
dence).16-19 There was insufﬁcient evidence about
ﬂuoxetine, citalopram, and ﬂuvoxamine.

Children and adolescents. Although fewer studies
focused on these age groups, sertraline (5-17 years of
age; level 2 evidence),20 ﬂuoxetine (7-17 years of age;
level 3 evidence), and paroxetine (for 8 to 17 years of age;
level 3 evidence) were found efﬁcacious.20 No evidence
could be found about ﬂuvoxamine, citalopram, or escita-
lopram in this age group.

Older adults. Despite having a high risk of bias,
Balasubramaniam et al.21 was included due to the
scarcity of data on pharmacological GAD treatment in
older adults. Level 3 evidence was found for sertraline,
paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram.21 Two studies
provided level 3 evidence on escitalopram,22,23 while two
others provided level 3 evidence speciﬁcally for patients
aged 60 to 65 years,18,19 although all of these studies had
a high risk of bias. However, these medications cause few
side effects, have a simple dosage, and have been

studied for several years in this age group. The prescrib-
ing physician should begin with low doses and should be
aware of possible drug interactions, side effects (more
intense in this group) and, especially, the cost-effective-
ness of the treatment.

Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors

Adults. Level 1 evidence was found for duloxetine. This
medication, along with escitalopram, had larger effect
sizes (-3.1 [-4 to -2.2] and -3.2 [-4.2 to -2.2], respec-
tively) than paroxetine, sertraline, ﬂuoxetine, or venla-
faxine in a study lasting at least 4 weeks.16 Although the
results were comparable to placebo in previous studies,24
duloxetine has been considered a ﬁrst-line treatment for
GAD.25 Duloxetine was assessed in short-term treatment,
result-

ing in improved psychic anxiety and somatic symptoms.
Level 1 evidence was found for venlafaxine ER. Two meta-
analyses found venlafaxine efﬁcacious in 3,622 adults with
GAD in interventions ranging from 6 to 12 weeks.23,26 The
extended-release formulation was effective and well
tolerated (odds ratio = 1.83, 95%CI 1.58- 2.12).26

Children and adolescents. A meta-analysis of 1,673
patients found duloxetine superior to placebo in interven-
tions X 12 weeks20 (effect size 17.3 [SD, 2.2]). Another
study with a 10-week intervention corroborates this data27
(7 to 17 years of age; level 2 evidence). Level 2 evidence
was found for venlafaxine ER among 6- to 17-year-olds.20

Older adults. Among older adults, level 3 evidence was
found for duloxetine and venlafaxine ER due to the
study’s high risk of bias.21

Tricyclic antidepressants

Despite being an older antidepressant with several
potential adverse effects, this drug class is well-known
and inexpensive. A comprehensive evaluation of three
trials comparing tricyclic antidepressants and benzodia-
zepines (BZDs) indicated that imipramine was superior to
BZD for reducing GAD symptoms. As measured by pre-
to post-treatment improvement in Hamilton Anxiety Scale
scores, alprazolam was substantially more efﬁcacious

anxiety.28

In contrast, the beneﬁts of imipramine were greater

symptoms and a similar effect on physical symptoms.

effects are headaches, nausea, sweating,

severe with venlafaxine than other antidepressants.

Atypical antidepressants

Agomelatine. The results for agomelatine were similar to
escitalopram.30 Stein et al.30 found agomelatine to be
effective in short-term therapy, reducing the relapse risk
over 6 months. Although the incidence of most adverse
events was similar
to placebo, agomelatine cannot
be widely recommended for long-term GAD treatment due
to concerns about liver injury23 (adults; level 2 evidence).

Precautions with antidepressants and side effects at the
beginning of treatment

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Owing to
increased serotonin levels in the central nervous system
and other areas, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the
onset of side effects may be quick. It is important to point
out that the majority of adverse effects diminish or vanish
after the 1st month of medication use. The most common
adverse reactions are nausea, diarrhea, appetite loss, dry
mouth (gastrointestinal side effect), sleeplessness,
tre-
mors, headache, dizziness, and sexual dysfunction.
Episodes of mania, bleeding (usually when associated
with anti-inﬂammatory drugs), and excessive perspiration
are also possible. Gradual dose progression should be
recommended due to adverse effects and somatic
symptoms. Patients can tolerate these effects with
reassurance and guidance about their transient nature.
Nevertheless,
that selective
it should be pointed out
serotonin reuptake inhibitors are generally safe and well
tolerated.

Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The
adverse effects of selective norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors are similar
to those of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors. In addition, owing to their noradre-
nergic activity, dry mouth and constipation are possible.
There is also a risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures
with selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

Tricyclic antidepressants. Due to the anticholinergic
properties of tricyclic antidepressants, diarrhea, constipa-
tion, drowsiness, dry mouth, and impaired vision are
frequent side effects. Sedation and weight gain are also
possible due to their antihistamine characteristics. Block-
ade of alpha-adrenergic receptors frequently results in
hypotension and vertigo, whereas the blockade of ionic
channels can lead to fatal conditions, such as cardiac
arrhythmias and seizures.

Agomelatine. Agomelatine acts on melatonergic and
5HT2C receptors, which can cause nausea, dizziness,
drowsiness,
insomnia, headache, anxiety,
abdominal pain, risk of liver injury, and hypertension.

fatigue,

Pharmacological treatment: benzodiazepines

According to a meta-analysis of 56 trials (n=12,655),
BZDs are more effective for GAD than selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors or selective norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors.31 A second meta-analysis found that patients
with severe baseline symptoms who received short-term
therapy had the greatest response (alprazolam [p =
0.001], clobazam [p = 0.01], diazepam [p = 0.003],
estazolam [p = 0.001],
lorazepam [p = 0.0004], and
zopiclone [p = 0.007]).32 However, the possibility of long-
term negative effects and dependency must be consid-
ered prior to prescription. The Canadian Study of Health
and Aging reported that deteriorating cognitive function
was a possibility, but no correlation was found between
dementia diagnosis and BZD use.33 No long-term
relationships were found between BZD use and dementia
diagnosis in a second trial with 235,465 participants.34
BZDs are effective and generally safe, and should be
prescribed with the same caution as any other psychiatric
medicine (level 1 evidence: adults only).

Precautions and side effects

Sedation, tiredness, dizziness, weakness, ataxia, hyper-
arousal, and irritability are common with BZDs. Since
GAD is a chronic disorder, chronic BZD use increases the
risk of dependence and tolerance, possibly resulting in a
paradoxical consequence. No information exists on the
minimum or maximum duration of BZD therapy in GAD.

Pharmacological treatment: pregabalin

In a meta-analysis (n = 2,299) by Generoso et al.35
(Hedges’ g = 0.37; 95%CI 0.30-0.44), pregabalin was
superior to placebo for GAD treatment (0.30-0.44). Other
meta-analyses have found similar efﬁcacy in long-term
therapy (CI
-2.61 [-3.21-2.01]; Hedges’ g = 0.364,
respectively).23,36,37 A randomized controlled trial of 1-12
weeks suggested that pregabalin may be a safe choice for
terminating chronic BZD use (51.4% (cid:1) 37.6%, respec-
tively).38 Level 1 evidence was found for adults only.

Precautions and side effects

Blocking calcium channels in the central nervous sys-
tem may cause sedation, dizziness, ataxia,
lethargy,
disorientation, and mood swings. Nausea, dry mouth,
increased hunger, change in body weight, and impaired
eyesight may occur.

Pharmacological treatment: quetiapine

Precautions for antidepressant discontinuation

When discontinuing antidepressants, symptoms usually
subside within a few days and continue to decrease
gradually over a few weeks. The most prevalent side

Three previous meta-analyses and a systematic review
found evidence supporting the efﬁcacy of quetiapine
as monotherapy39-41 and in long-term maintenance.
Zhornitsky et al.42
reported that quetiapine was
more efﬁcacious than paroxetine and placebo in a

Braz J Psychiatry. 2024;46:e20233235

comprehensive analysis of two studies that spanned 8-52
weeks.23 Level 1 evidence was found for extended-
release quetiapine in adults only.

Precautions and side effects

Quetiapine can cause sedation, weight gain, dizziness,
dry mouth, constipation, metabolic dysfunction, and an
increased risk of diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder

The number of articles discussing instances of treatment-
resistant anxiety has increased in recent years. Never-
theless, this idea is often ambiguous or poorly described.
Determining the parameters of a sufﬁcient trial (e.g., the
number and duration of prior trials) is heterogeneous and
imprecise in the majority of studies. Response and
remission analysis should include anxiety symptoms,
functional impairment, and comorbidities.43

treatment

in terms of

Pollack et al.44 proposed considering response to
anxiety disorder
remission or
signiﬁcant response in core anxious symptoms, functional
impairment, and comorbid depressive symptoms. A
systematic review found that combining olanzapine or
risperidone with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or BZDs was
effective for treatment-resistant GAD.45 Since relevant
studies were few and had small effect sizes, we will not
provide a level of evidence; psychiatrists should deter-
mine the best individualized therapy in cases of treat-
ment-resistant GAD.

Pharmacological treatment duration

The proper length of pharmacological therapy was a very
pressing issue that our investigation could not answer.
Patients who responded to the same course of therapy
with a particular medicine and were subsequently
randomized to placebo or continuous blind treatment with
the drug for 6 to 18 months and subsequently participated
in relapse prevention trials for at
least one anxiety
disorder.17 All of these studies found that remaining in
active therapy was far more beneﬁcial than switching to
placebo. According to the ﬁndings of
these clinical
experiments on relapse prevention, pharmaceutical treat-
ment should be maintained for at
least 1 year after
remission. Given the chronic nature of anxiety disorders,
it
is curious that almost no controlled studies have
examined treatment durations 4 1 year.17 To minimize
withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be progressively
reduced over 2 weeks after therapy is completed.17

Since studies are inconclusive about the time-depen-
dent risks or beneﬁts of BZDs, doctors and their patients
should determine treatment duration, always bearing in
mind the risk of dependence.

Psychotherapies

Psychotherapies involve great heterogeneity of variables
and are difﬁcult

the same diagnosis, precisely reproducing the technique
within the same group by different professionals, and
even to choosing a comparator
(which may be a
psychological placebo or a drug).

Adults

Level 1 evidence was found for cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) in the short term. CBT was more effective
than other psychotherapies,
including psychodynamic
and supportive therapies.46,47 A review found that none
of the studies comparing CBT with treatment as usual or
wait-listing assessed the long-term efﬁcacy of CBT.46
Level 2 evidence was found for group psychodynamic
therapy and CBT.17

The evidence for applied relaxation, biofeedback, and
supportive psychotherapy was also considered level 2.47

Children and adolescents

Compared to wait-listing or no treatment, CBT signiﬁ-
cantly improved primary anxiety symptoms, remission,
and response. CBT led to a greater reduction in primary
anxiety symptoms than ﬂuoxetine and a higher remission
rate than sertraline. Combining sertraline and CBT led
to a signiﬁcantly greater reduction in clinician-reported
primary anxiety symptoms and response than either
treatment alone48 (level 1 evidence). However, this study
involved several anxiety disorders and did not limit its
evaluation to anxiety reduction in GAD alone. Until further
reviews can be conducted, we support these authors’
recommendations.

Older adults

At the end of treatment and at 6 months of follow-up,
signiﬁcant treatment effects were found for CBT in older
adults compared to wait-listing or treatment as usual.
Compared to active controls, CBT led to a small
treatment,
nonsigniﬁcant advantage at
the end of
although the outcomes were equivalent at
follow-up.
CBT’s treatment effect size for GAD was signiﬁcantly
associated with attrition rates and depression outcomes49
(level 1 evidence).

Psychotherapy duration

The minimum treatment duration necessary to maintain
the effects of psychotherapy was not described in the
literature. Due to the chronic nature of GAD symptoms,
new studies are needed to describe the required
frequency and duration of sessions for each approach
to produce psychotherapeutic effects in GAD. However,
according to the included literature, the average duration
of psychotherapy is longer than drug treatments since its
effects may not be immediately apparent. Thus, duration
is unfeasible as a moderator. Drug studies were
signiﬁcantly shorter (9.2 [SD, 4.4] weeks on average)
than psychotherapy studies (12.4 [SD, 5.5] weeks).17 The
mean treatment duration of psychotherapeutic interven-
tions was between 8 and 12 weeks.5,50-52

Discussion

further

research is required for safer

Combined therapy

A network meta-analysis5 observed that most pharmaco-
logical interventions had larger effect sizes than psycho-
logical interventions, and most psychological interventions
had larger effect sizes than self-help interventions. Accord-
ing to one author, many experts recommended combined
treatment despite insufﬁcient evidence that combined
therapy is more effective than monotherapy for GAD.53
Although both of these studies focused on monotherapy, we
have presented what we could ﬁnd in the literature, i.e.,
studies on combined therapy for patients with GAD are
scarce. Only one RCT could be found, which compared the
efﬁcacy of CBT plus venlafaxine XR to venlafaxine
monotherapy and found similar treatment outcomes.54

Perspectives

Neurostimulation

A meta-analysis with 61 participants found that transcra-
nial magnetic stimulation was efﬁcacious for treating GAD
symptoms.55 The overall effect size was -2.06 (95%CI
-2.64 to -1.48) in favor of active repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation treatment (level 2 evidence; adults
only). A systematic review with 475 participants found that
transcranial direct current stimulation reduced the severity
of GAD symptoms.56 Nevertheless, there is still
insufﬁ-
cient evidence to recommend this intervention as a ﬁrst-
line treatment due to the low number of studies.

Mindfulness

Although we decided to mention mindfulness therapy in
this guideline,
involves several modalities and con-
ceptual difﬁculties, as well as a relationship with self-help
therapies. This modality may be promising but requires
further research to determine its efﬁcacy.57,58

it

Exercise

A recent meta-analysis with 13,574 participants found
that exercise alone could reduce GAD symptoms.59
Another meta-analysis in university students with GAD
(49 students:75% female; age: 20.68 [SD, 5.8] years)
concluded exercise signiﬁcantly reduced GAD symp-
toms.60 It should be pointed out that exercise programs,
which are widely available and have no side effects, may
be an alternative to pharmacological
treatment or
cognitive-behavioral therapy61 (level 5 evidence).

supplements, lavender oil (Lavandula angustifolia), and

A previous Brazilian guideline on the diagnosis and
treatment of anxiety disorders proposed venlafaxine and
sertraline as ﬁrst-line treatments, paroxetine as a second-
line treatment, and short-term BZD as a third-line
treatment was

The present review found the following the medications
efﬁcacious for GAD: sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram,
imipramine, pregabalin, BZD,
duloxetine, venlafaxine,
and quetiapine. Buspirone may be an option, despite
weak effects and a lower level of evidence. In pediatric
patients, ﬂuoxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline,
duloxetine, and venlafaxine were efﬁcacious.
In older
adults, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline,
duloxetine, and venlafaxine were efﬁcacious. At
least
12 months of treatment is recommended. For treatment-
resistant GAD, a systematic review found that risperidone
and olanzapine to be effective when used as adjunctive
treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and BZDs.45
BZDs are an effective option for GAD. Their effects are
almost immediate, and they have muscle relaxant and
hypnotic effects. However, there is a risk of dependence
in individuals previously diagnosed with a substance use
disorder. Another problem is that neither a maximum nor
a minimum dose has been recommend in the literature.
Thus, the decision must be left up to the psychiatrist and
patient.

individual, and continuous follow-up with a professional
capable of evaluating improvement in GAD symptoms is
recommended. Although some patients may relapse,
others will not and may avoid side effects. Given that
GAD is often a chronic condition, if a pharmaceutical
beneﬁt seems likely, maintenance treatment of at least
1 year has been reasonably well-established and is
endorsed by most evidence-based guidelines.37

These guidelines aimed to discuss the various ther-
apeutic approaches to GAD in a manner adapted to the
Brazilian context, offering evidence-based recommenda-
tions for health professionals. Some limitations should be
mentioned. The samples were heterogeneous, response
was assessed at various times, and different outcome
measures were used. However, the studies were well
selected regarding diagnosis, which is a strong point.

The pharmaceutical industry has supported a number
trials involving GAD to present new medications.

Because this guideline focused only on GAD, many
studies were excluded because they did not separate
interventions according to anxiety disorder subtype.
There was great difﬁculty in determining the technique

fact that they involve other biases that cannot always be
resolved.

The efﬁcacy of many GAD treatments was assessed.
Antidepressants (with some exceptions) and BZDs are
recommended, as are pregabalin (an anticonvulsant) and
quetiapine (atypical antipsychotic). CBT and psychody-
namic therapy were found effective. Treatment access
and side effects must be considered when selecting the
best therapeutic strategy. There was insufﬁcient evidence
regarding neuromodulation, mindfulness, exercise, kava-
kava (Piper methysticum), chamomile, nutritional supple-
ments, lavender oil (Lavandula angustifolia), or probiotics
to make any recommendations;
further studies are
needed to determine their efﬁcacy.
