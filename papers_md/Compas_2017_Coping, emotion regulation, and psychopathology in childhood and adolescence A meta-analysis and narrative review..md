Abstract

In this meta-analytic and narrative review, we examine several overarching issues related to the 
study of coping, emotion regulation, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of 
psychopathology in childhood and adolescence, including the conceptualization and measurement 
of these constructs. We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) 
that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of 
internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the 
association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion 
regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, 
secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional 
expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-
sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine three potential 
moderators: age, measure quality, and single vs. multiple informants. Finally, we separately 
consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After 
accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and

adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related 
to lower symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of 
disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance and denial are 
related to higher symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of 
the field and outline an agenda for future research.

The identification of processes of risk and resilience is crucial for understanding the etiology 
of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and disorders in childhood and adolescence and 
for the development of interventions for the prevention and treatment of these symptoms and 
disorders (e.g., Cicchetti & Curtis, 2007; Kraemer, Lowe, & Kupfer, 2005; Luthar, 2006; 
Masten, 2001, 2014; Troy & Mauss, 2011). Exposure to acute and chronic stressful events 
and adversity is one of the most potent risk factors for psychopathology during childhood 
and adolescence (e.g., Evans, Li, & Whipple, 2013; Grant et al., 2003; Kushner, 2015). Yet 
not all who experience stress and adversity go on to develop symptoms of psychopathology, 
raising the question, why are some children and adolescents adversely affected while others 
are resilient? The ability to cope with stressful events and circumstances and regulate 
emotions across situations may play a primary role in the development of resilience and 
reducing the risk for psychopathology during childhood and adolescence (Compas, Gruhn, 
& Bettis, 2017; McRae & Mauss, 2016; Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2016). Given the 
potential to inform our understanding of processes of risk, resilience, and intervention, 
research on coping and emotion regulation in children and adolescents is of considerable 
importance for the field of developmental psychopathology and prevention science. 
However, despite a large and growing body of research, there has been no quantitative meta-
analysis of the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing 
and externalizing psychopathology in children and adolescents. Therefore, an integrative, 
quantitative review of this research is a high priority.

Although there are many commonalities between these constructs, research on coping and 
emotion regulation has remained relatively separate (e.g., Compas, Jaser, & Benson, 2009; 
Compas et al., 2014a; Kopp, 1989; Zalewski, Lengua, Wilson, Trancik, & Bazinet, 2011; 
Zimmer-Gembeck et al., 2014). For example, Compas et al. (2014a) found that although 
both coping and emotion regulation are active areas of research, only 208 of 20,804 
publications (1%) between 2003 and 2012 identified in a PsycINFO search included both of 
these concepts as key terms. There has been little integration of the conceptualization and 
measurement of these two processes. Further, confusion in defining and conceptualizing 
coping and emotion regulation in youth, as well as identifying clear dimensions or subtypes 
of these processes, has inhibited the synthesis and integration of findings (Skinner, Edge, 
Altman, & Sherwood, 2003). In addition, the measurement of coping and emotion regulation 
is characterized by a large and ever-expanding number of measures, many of which are of 
unknown psychometric quality. Finally, it has been 16 years since the last comprehensive 
review of coping and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in children and

adolescents (Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman, Thomsen, & Wadsworth, 2001) and 7 years 
since the last review of emotion regulation and these broad domains of psychopathology in 
young people (Eisenberg, Spinrad, & Eggum, 2010). Notably, neither of these reviews 
provided quantitative meta-analyses.

To address these gaps in the field, we begin by examining several overarching issues related 
to the study of coping, emotion regulation, and psychopathology in children and adolescents. 
First, we consider several broad issues in this field including definitions and 
conceptualizations of coping and emotion regulation in childhood and adolescence, the 
status of the measurement of coping and emotion regulation, the role of exposure to acute 
and chronic stressors and the experience of emotions in the development of 
psychopathology, and previous reviews on the associations of coping and emotion regulation 
with symptoms of psychopathology. In the primary section of this review, we report on a 
quantitative meta-analysis of the associations between coping and emotion regulation and 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms. We also consider three possible moderators of the 
association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology: child age, 
the quality of measures of coping and emotion regulation, and the use of single vs. multiple 
informants to measure coping and emotion regulation and symptoms of psychopathology. 
Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for research 
to advance our understanding of coping and emotion regulation in youth.

Coping and Emotion Regulation: Definitions and Conceptualization

Previous reviews have noted a lack of consensus in the definition and conceptualization of 
coping and emotion regulation in children and adolescents (e.g., Adrian, Zeman, & Veits, 
2011; Compas et al., 2001; Eisenberg et al., 2010; Skinner et al., 2003). Clear consensus on 
the definitions of coping and emotion regulation is needed in order to identify the boundaries 
of what is and is not included within each of these constructs, shape the identification of the 
structure and subtypes of coping and emotion regulation, and guide the selection of 
measures for research on the association of coping and emotion regulation with 
psychopathology. It is encouraging, therefore, that since earlier reviews of coping and 
emotion regulation there have been some signs of convergence on the central features of 
these constructs.

Definitions of Coping and Emotion Regulation

The challenge of establishing consensus regarding definitions of coping and emotion 
regulation is reflected in the 212 studies included in the meta-analysis reported below. The 
most widely used definitions of coping and emotion regulation in childhood and adolescence 
are presented in Table 1. Both the Lazarus and Folkman (1984) and Compas et al. (2001) 
definitions of coping highlight the role of coping as a process of responding to stress. 
Further, both definitions emphasize coping as a controlled, effortful process; i.e., responses 
that require conscious, purposeful, and intentional thoughts and behaviors. However, 
Lazarus and Folkman (1984) emphasize cognitive appraisals of stress as precipitants of 
coping responses, whereas Compas et al. (2001) focus on objectively stressful events or 
circumstances in the environment as precipitants of coping responses. The Lazarus and

Folkman model incorporates two broad types of coping that differ based on the focus and 
goals of coping efforts: problem-focused coping (i.e., efforts to resolve the source of stress, 
including problem solving) and emotion-focused coping (i.e., efforts to palliate one’s 
emotions, including seeking social support and escape/avoidance) (e.g., Folkman & 
Moskowitz, 2004). The Compas et al. (2001) definition is linked to a control-based model of 
coping that includes primary control coping (i.e., efforts to directly act on the source of 
stress or one’s emotions, including problem solving and emotional expression), secondary 
control coping (i.e., efforts to adapt to the source of stress, including acceptance and 
cognitive reappraisal), and disengagement coping (i.e., efforts to orient away from the source 
of stress or one’s emotions, including avoidance or denial) (e.g., Compas, Jaser, Dunn, & 
Rodriguez, 2012; Rudolph, Dennig, & Weisz, 1995; Weisz, McCabe, & Dennig, 1994). 
Further, the scope of the construct of coping has broadened since the earlier work of Lazarus 
and Folkman (1984), with a growing emphasis on coping as the regulation of a wider range 
of functions, including emotion, behavior, cognitions, physiology, and the environment, in 
response to stress (e.g., Compas et al., 2001; Eisenberg, Fabes, & Guthrie, 1997; Kopp, 
1989).

The most commonly cited definition of emotion regulation emphasizes processes of 
monitoring, evaluation, and modification of emotional reactions. Specifically, Thompson 
(1994) defines emotion regulation as, “the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for 
monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions, especially their intensive and 
temporal features, to accomplish one’s goals” (pp. 27–28). These regulation processes 
involve a series of steps that include the selection and modification of situations that give 
rise to emotions, the deployment of attention in response to emotion, cognitive change, and 
modulation of emotional responses. This process model of emotion regulation includes 
strategies such as problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, and emotional suppression and 
emphasizes the deployment of these strategies as part of the temporal process of the 
experience and regulation of emotions (Gross & Thompson, 2007). Similar elements can be 
found in the work of Eisenberg et al. (2010) who focus on the construct of emotion-related 
self-regulation, defined as, “processes used to manage and change if, when, and how (e.g., 
how intensely) one experiences emotions and emotion-related motivational and 
physiological states, as well as how emotions are expressed behaviorally” (p. 516). We now 
consider in more detail several key issues reflected in these definitions of coping and 
emotion regulation.

Shared features of coping and emotion regulation.—Although research on these 
constructs has predominately been conducted separately, there is considerable overlap in the 
concepts of coping and emotion regulation. A unifying feature of conceptualizations of 
coping and emotion regulation is the central role of regulatory processes (e.g., Compas et al., 
2014a; Eisenberg et al., 1997; Gross & Thompson, 2007; Zimmer-Gembeck et al., 2014). 
Regulation involves a broad array of responses, including efforts to initiate, delay, terminate, 
modify the form/content, or modulate the amount or intensity of a thought, emotion, 
behavior, or physiological reaction (Compas et al., 2001). Coping includes the regulation of 
these processes that occur specifically in response to a stressor, whereas emotion regulation

occurs in response to the presence of an emotion whether or not the emotion arises in 
response to a stressor (Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Schweizer, 2010; Thompson, 1994).

Kopp (1989) argued that, “emotion regulation is a term used to characterize the processes 
and characteristics involved in coping with heightened levels of positive and negative 
emotions” (p. 343; italics added). Similarly, Skinner, Zimmer-Gembeck and colleagues (e.g., 
Skinner & Wellborn, 1994; Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007; Zimmer-Gembeck & 
Skinner, 2011; Zimmer-Gembeck et al., 2014) define coping as action regulation under 
stress, which includes coordination, mobilization, energizing, directing and guiding 
behavior, emotion, and orientation when responding to stress. Thus, the terms coping and 
regulation are used somewhat interchangeably in definitions of coping and emotion 
regulation.

In addition, the process model of emotion regulation by Gross, Thompson and colleagues 
includes responses that are directed toward other processes in addition to emotions (e.g., 
Gross, 2015; Gross & Thompson, 2007; Thompson, 1991, 1994; Thompson & Calkins, 
1996; Thompson & Goodman, 2010). As noted above, this conceptual model includes 
efforts directed at the context in which emotions occur, the cognitive processes that may 
shape and influence emotions, and modulation of behavioral responses. Similarly, Eisenberg, 
Hofer, and Vaughan (2007) include emotions, emotion-related motivational and 
physiological states, and the behavioral expression of emotions within the realm of emotion 
regulation. In this way, emotion regulation encompasses the broad array of processes (i.e., 
emotion, cognition, behavior, context) that are also included within the concept of coping. 
Further, as discussed in more detail below, there is significant overlap in the strategies that 
are included as subtypes of both coping and emotion regulation. For example, problem 
solving, cognitive reappraisal, acceptance, emotional expression, and avoidance have all 
been included as strategies in both coping and emotion regulation research (Aldao et al., 
2010; Skinner et al., 2003).

Conceptualizations of coping and emotion regulation also share a distinction between 
automatic and controlled processes (e.g., Mauss, Bunge, & Gross, 2007). A fundamental 
contrast throughout psychological science is made between dual-processes that are 
characterized as automatic vs. controlled, including distinctions between processes that are 
labeled as regulation vs. reactivity, intentional vs. incidental, conscious vs. non-conscious, 
and voluntary vs. involuntary (e.g., Bargh & Williams, 2007; Connor-Smith et al., 2000; 
Eisenberg et al. 2007, 2010; Gross & Thompson, 2007). Automatic, incidental, involuntary 
processes are rooted in temperamental differences in reactivity to the environment that 
emerge early in development; further, some responses are acquired through processes of 
associative conditioning that do not involve conscious control (e.g., Compas, Connor-Smith, 
& Jaser, 2004). In contrast, controlled, intentional, voluntary responses often involve higher-
order, complex cognitive processes that are thought to develop more fully in middle and late 
childhood (Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2016).

There are several reasons to focus on controlled as opposed to automatic processes in 
examining the relations of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of 
psychopathology. Controlled processes reflect both covert cognitive and overt behavioral

strategies that children and adolescents purposefully use to cope with stress and regulate 
their emotions. These responses occur in both stressful and emotionally arousing situations 
and may be more accessible to conscious awareness than non-conscious processes (Rabiner, 
Lenhart, & Lochman, 1990). Consequently, controlled processes, or at least those within 
conscious awareness, may be more amenable to self-reports and reports by other informants 
of these efforts (e.g., Compas et al., 2014a). In addition, controlled processes are less likely 
than automatic processes to be confounded with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing 
psychopathology. For example, an automatic anger response may be highly correlated with 
symptoms of externalizing psychopathology in part because anger is included as an 
externalizing symptom (e.g., Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). Lastly, controlled processes can 
be more readily changed than automatic processes through interventions that are designed to 
enhance resilience by teaching skills for coping with stress and regulating emotions. A 
growing body of evidence suggests that interventions targeting coping and emotion 
regulation skills are efficacious in the prevention and treatment of psychopathology in 
children and adolescents (e.g., Compas et al., 2010; Lochman & Wells, 2004; Tein, Sandler, 
Ayers, & Wolchik, 2006; Tein, Sandler, MacKinnon, & Wolchik 2004). Thus, the focus of 
the current meta-analysis will be on controlled processes of coping and emotion regulation 
in childhood and adolescence.

In spite of the relative importance of focusing on controlled processes of coping and emotion 
regulation, some examples of these processes present significant challenges, as they may 
reflect both automatic and controlled processes. Rather than a simple dichotomy, automatic 
and controlled processes lie on a continuum (Gross & Thompson, 2007; Hopp, Troy, & 
Mauss, 2011). Some processes that are initially automatic may be brought under purposeful 
control, and processes that require effort may become automatized with repeated practice 
(e.g., Evers et al., 2014; Hankin, Badanes, Smolen, & Young, 2015; Mauss et al., 2007). 
However, the distinction between controlled and automatic processes remains central to 
understanding both coping and emotion regulation. One noteworthy example of this comes 
from research on rumination (e.g., Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, & Lyubomirksy, 2008). 
Rumination can occur in the form of uncontrollable, intrusive thoughts or as purposefully 
dwelling on thoughts about one’s emotions, as in the case of depressive rumination. Because 
rumination is conceptualized and measured as both an automatic and controlled process and 
because previous meta-analyses have established that rumination has a large positive 
correlation with symptoms of psychopathology (Aldao et al., 2010), rumination and other 
constructs that may reflect both automatic and controlled processes were excluded from the 
current review.

Unique features of coping and emotion regulation.—These shared features 
notwithstanding, a primary distinction between models of coping and emotion regulation 
centers on the precipitants for these two processes. As noted above, coping refers to 
processes that are generated specifically in response to stressful events or circumstances. 
This encompasses efforts to regulate responses (including emotions) to acute life events, 
chronic stressors, daily hassles, and conditions of chronic adversity, all of which have been 
shown to be significant risk factors for symptoms of psychopathology (Harkness & Monroe, 
2016). In contrast, emotion regulation includes responses aimed at the generation and

modulation of emotions. Emotions arise in response to stress and adversity but also occur as 
a part of ongoing, normative experiences of daily life that do not involve stressful events or 
circumstances (e.g., an emotionally moving film or book). This contrast suggests that coping 
is both a narrower and broader construct than emotion regulation. Coping is a narrower 
construct in that it is limited to responses in the context of stressors while emotion regulation 
occurs in response to both stressful and non-stressful circumstances. However, coping is also 
a broader construct in that it encompasses the regulation of a wider range of processes that 
includes not only emotions, but also cognition, behavior, physiology, and sources of stress in 
the environment. These differences notwithstanding, given the increasing recognition of 
common elements between coping and emotion regulation, a review of the ways that both of 
these processes relate to internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in childhood and 
adolescence is timely and needed.

Structure and Subtypes of Coping and Emotion Regulation

A quantitative analysis of the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms 
of psychopathology requires the clear delineation of subtypes of these constructs; however, 
as noted above there has been relatively little agreement regarding the structure of coping 
and emotion regulation. For example, in a seminal review of the structure of coping, Skinner 
et al. (2003) identified over 400 different subtypes that have appeared in research across 
childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. These include widely studied coping and emotion 
regulation strategies such as problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, cognitive avoidance, 
emotional expression, and acceptance, as well as less frequently examined strategies such as 
physical exercise, stoicism, and thought stopping.

The lack of consensus about the structure of coping and emotion regulation has slowed 
progress in the field (Compas et al., 2001, 2014a; Skinner et al., 2003). The most obvious 
problem is the difficulty in comparing and accumulating results from different 
investigations. Measures differ in the items that are included within dimensions of coping 
and emotion regulation, making it difficult to aggregate findings relevant to the same stressor 
or precipitant or to compare results across different stressors or precipitants. Compas et al. 
(2001) concluded that “There has been little consistency in the application of these various 
subtypes of coping across different measures and studies … leading to considerable 
difficulty developing a cohesive picture of the structure of coping in childhood and 
adolescence” (p. 92). Notably, relatively little progress has been made to address this 
problem in the last 16 years.

The identification of the structure of coping and emotion regulation has been approached 
using either bottom-up models (i.e., derived through exploratory factor analysis [EFA] or 
through rational grouping of strategies) or top-down models (i.e., theory-driven and tested 
using confirmatory factor analysis [CFA]) systems). Problems identified with bottom-up 
approaches include lack of clarity, limited comprehensiveness of categories, inability to 
determine hierarchical structures, and difficulty determining whether categories are distinct 
(Skinner et al., 2003). In contrast, Skinner et al. (2003) highlight the merits of three top-
down coping structures that have been supported using CFA with reference to children and 
adolescents (Ayers, Sandler, & Twohey, 1998; Connor-Smith et al., 2000; Walker, Smith,

Garber, & Van Slyke, 1997). The strengths of these and other top-down approaches include 
tests of clear conceptual models of the structure of coping and emotion regulation, the 
development of measures that reflect these models, use detailed and complex data analytic 
approaches, and cross-validation with multiple large samples (Skinner et al., 2003). Further, 
Skinner et al. (2003) note that although these models are not without problems they 
“represent guideposts for empirical efforts to search for the structure of coping” (p. 232).

We consider these models of coping in more detail in the measurement section that follows. 
Further, we include those measures based on top-down theory-driven systems with factor 
structures that have been tested using CFA as an indicator of measurement quality in the 
moderator analyses presented as a part of the meta-analysis below. It is noteworthy that no 
similar efforts to catalogue and examine the structure of emotion regulation have appeared in 
the literature; however, some emotion regulation measures were derived using a top-down 
approach (e.g., Children’s Emotion Management Scales; Zeman, Cassano, Suveg, & 
Shipman, 2010; Zeman, Shipman, & Penza-Clyve, 2001) and construct validity has been 
established for these measures with CFA.

Summary

In spite of some distinctions in their conceptualization, we believe that coping and emotion 
regulation have many more similarities than differences and that it is timely and 
advantageous to collectively examine research on these processes in children and 
adolescents. Driven in part by these similarities, the current meta-analysis is the first to 
examine both coping and emotion regulation in relation to internalizing and externalizing 
symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents.

Measurement of Coping and Emotion Regulation

To test the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and 
externalizing psychopathology, measures must meet accepted standards of reliability and 
validity. As research on these constructs has grown, this growth would ideally be reflected in 
increasing consensus and rigor in research designs and methods of measurement. It is a 
concern, therefore, that the number of measures of coping and emotion regulation in 
children and adolescents is large and still increasing. Further, the continued proliferation of 
measures is partly a reflection of the lack of consensus regarding the structure of coping and 
emotion regulation. The over 400 subtypes of coping identified by Skinner et al. (2003) were 
drawn from more than 100 different measures of coping, and over a decade later, new 
measures continue to be developed (e.g., Maxwell & Cole, 2012; Sveinbjornsdottir & 
Thorsteinsson, 2014). The field of emotion regulation is somewhat newer and still emerging. 
Nonetheless, Adrian et al. (2011) reported on 100 measures of emotion regulation used in 
studies from 1975 through 2010, and new emotion regulation measures continue to be 
developed. In this section, we review the measures used to study the association of coping 
and emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents, 
with a focus on self-report and other informant (e.g., parents, teachers) measures used most 
frequently in the meta-analysis that follows.

The measurement of coping and emotion regulation has been primarily characterized by four 
approaches: questionnaires completed by children and adolescents or other informants, 
interviews, direct observations of behavior, and measures of physiological processes (e.g., 
Adrian et al., 2011; Blount et al., 2008; Compas et al., 2001; Eisenberg et al., 2010; Skinner 
et al., 2003). Research on emotion regulation in particular has employed experimental 
designs to examine the processes of regulation in the laboratory, including the use if 
observational and physiological measures. Examples of this include paradigms that elicit 
negative emotions and instruct participants to use specific emotion regulation strategies to 
regulate the experience of negative emotion (e.g., Gross & John, 2003; Morris et al., 2011; 
Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008; Webb, Schweiger, Miles, Gollwitzer, & Sheeran, 2012). 
Although direct observations of behavior (e.g., displays of emotion) and measurement of 
physiological processes (e.g., heart rate) provide important information on how people 
respond to stress, these methods do not allow for the direct measurement of controlled, often 
covert, cognitive strategies that children and adolescents use to cope with stress and regulate 
their emotions. There is evidence that both self-reports and reports from other informants 
can provide reliable measurement of children’s coping and emotion regulation strategies, 
including covert cognitive strategies, as evidenced by studies demonstrating significant 
cross-informant correlations, such as secondary control coping (e.g., Compas et al., 2006a, 
2014b; Connor-Smith et al., 2000). The focus of the current review, therefore, is on self- or 
other-report measures of coping and emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing 
symptoms.

Quality of Questionnaire Measures of Coping and Emotion Regulation

Several features of questionnaire measures of coping and emotion regulation are important 
to consider: (a) the sources of stress and specific emotions that are the precipitant(s) of the 
regulatory responses assessed by the measure, (b) the source of information/informant, and 
(c) types of coping and emotion regulation that are captured by these measures. The studies 
included in the meta-analysis that follows were selected in part based on the criteria that 
they employed measures designed to assess coping or emotion regulation and that, at 
minimum, reliability data had been reported in the literature. In the 212 studies included, 87 
distinct measures were used. Of these measures, thirteen were modified versions of existing 
measures; these modifications included using a single subscale from an established measure 
or adding or omitting items from an established measure.

In Table 2, we highlight the 16 coping and emotion regulation measures that were used in at 
least three studies included in the meta-analysis. The most commonly used coping measures 
were the Responses to Stress Questionnaire (RSQ; Connor-Smith et al., 2000) and the 
Children’s Coping Strategies Checklist (CCSC; Ayers, Sandler, West, & Roosa, 1996). The 
most commonly used measures of emotion regulation were the Emotion Regulation 
Checklist (ERC; Molina et al., 2014; Shields & Cicchetti, 1997) and the Cognitive Emotion 
Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ; Garnefski, Kraaij, & Spinhoven, 2001).

Coping and emotion regulation: Domains, factors, and strategies.—Given the 
large number of measures and labels used across the studies included in the current meta-
analysis, we employed an organizational framework to combine data. Studies of coping and

emotion regulation in children and adolescents have examined these constructs on at least 
three levels: domains, factors, and strategies (see Methods and Appendix). These three levels 
reflect current, albeit somewhat overlapping approaches to the measurement of coping and 
emotion regulation in children and adolescents.

At the broadest level, domains of coping and emotion regulation are grouped into relatively 
undifferentiated categories including total coping, emotion regulation, emotion 
dysregulation, adaptive coping, and maladaptive coping. These broad domains include 
varied and heterogeneous coping and emotion regulation strategies. For example, 
examination of the association between total coping and symptoms of psychopathology 
ostensibly addresses the question of whether it is “better or worse” to engage in more vs. 
less coping, with no consideration of the strategies used to cope. The only distinction that 
has been made at the broadest level of domains is between those strategies that are 
distinguished as adaptive vs. maladaptive (or as regulation vs. dysregulation) on an a priori 
basis. However, the basis for this distinction is often not clear, as these categories remain 
very heterogeneous with regard to the strategies that they encompass. Further, labeling types 
of coping and emotion regulation as adaptive or maladaptive on an a priori basis can result in 
circular tests of the association between these processes and symptoms of psychopathology. 
That is, a positive association between maladaptive coping and symptoms is interpreted as 
evidence that this domain of coping is indeed maladaptive, which was already assumed at 
the outset.

Studies included in the current meta-analysis that measured the domain of total coping used 
a wide range of measures that capture a diverse array of strategies (e.g., Adolescent Coping 
Scale, ACS; Frydenberg & Lewis, 1993; CCSC; Ayers et al., 1996; CEMS; Zeman et al., 
2010; Kidcope; Spirito, Stark, & Williams, 1988). Total coping captures any efforts to cope 
with or regulate emotions in response to stress, and therefore total coping is typically the 
sum or total score of all coping items on a measure. Because these scores do not differentiate 
among types of coping efforts, they provide little information regarding types of coping that 
may be more or less beneficial than others under specific stressful circumstances. Similarly, 
studies measuring adaptive coping in the current review used a variety of measures (e.g., A-
COPE; Patterson & McCubbin, 1991; ACS; Frydenberg & Lewis, 1993; Kidcope; Spirito et 
al., 1988). The domain of maladaptive coping, however, was predominantly measured using 
the non-productive coping scale of the ACS (Frydenberg & Lewis, 1993). This scale 
includes items that assess the degree to which children and adolescents use strategies such as 
self-blame, withdrawal, wishful thinking, and avoidance to cope with stress.

Some measures of the broad domain of emotion regulation may capture more trait-like 
aspects of cognition and behavior rather than specific strategies used to regulate one’s 
emotions (e.g., ERC; Shields & Cicchetti, 1997). Emotion dysregulation has been measured 
primarily with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004). 
Items on the DERS capture the inability to use or the ineffective use of strategies to regulate 
emotions. A concern with the DERS and other measures of emotion dysregulation is the 
considerable overlap with measures of psychopathology, particularly internalizing 
symptoms.

At the intermediate level, coping and emotion regulation are grouped into empirically 
derived or theoretically derived factors that include problem-focused coping, emotion-
focused coping, engagement/approach coping, disengagement coping, primary control 
coping, secondary control coping, and social support coping. The most common approach to 
identifying coping factors has been the use of bottom-up approaches (EFA) that do not 
involve testing a priori models. Relatively fewer studies have used top-town approaches 
(CFA) to test theory-driven models of coping and emotion regulation (Skinner et al., 2003). 
Although these mid-level factors also include a wide range of specific strategies, they are 
more homogeneous with regard to the strategies that they encompass.

Presently, the most stringent tests and, therefore the strongest evidence for the structure of 
coping and emotion regulation come from measures that are designed to assess the factors of 
coping and emotion regulation. In addition to the three models of coping using CFA 
highlighted by Skinner et al. (2003) noted above (Ayers et al., 1996; Connor-Smith et al., 
2000; Walker et al., 1997), two additional models of coping have been tested using CFA 
(Frydenberg & Lewis, 1993; Seiffge-Krenke, 1995). The most extensive support for the 
structure of coping has been generated using the RSQ (Connor-Smith et al., 2000), which 
has been tested using CFA in samples of children and adolescents. A total of six studies 
reporting on seven independent samples faced with a wide range of different stressors across 
a number of countries and ethnic groups using CFA have confirmed the three-factor 
structure of the RSQ: primary control coping (problem-solving, emotional expression, 
emotional modulation), secondary control coping (acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, positive 
thinking, distraction), and disengagement coping (avoidance, denial, wishful thinking) 
(Benson et al., 2011; Compas et al., 2006b; Connor-Smith & Calvete, 2004; Connor-Smith 
et al., 2000; Wadsworth, Rieckmann, Benson, & Compas, 2004; Xiao et al., 2010). The three 
factors in the RSQ parallel factors included in two other coping measures: the Pain Response 
Inventory (PRI; active, accommodative, passive coping; Walker et al., 1997) and the 
Children’s Coping Strategies Checklist (CCSC; active coping, avoidance, distraction; Ayers 
et al., 1996). It is noteworthy that, although several of the emotion regulation measures have 
established construct validity using CFA, no emotion regulation measures include scales at 
the factor level.

The third level includes specific strategies of coping and emotion regulation, including 
emotional expression, emotional suppression, problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, 
distraction, acceptance, avoidance, wishful thinking, denial, emotional modulation, 
unregulated release of emotions, and humor. Although Skinner et al. (2003) identified over 
400 coping strategies, we grouped individual strategies into these 12 categories to create a 
manageable number for the current meta-analysis and because these were the most 
commonly used categories among the included studies (see Appendix). These categories 
provide a fine-grained analysis of specific strategies that children and adolescents use to 
cope with stress and regulate their emotions. However, measures at this level reflect only a 
relatively small sample of the larger set of coping and emotion regulation strategies that 
children and adolescents may enact when faced with a stressor or emotion, and there is 
relatively less data on the psychometric properties of measures used to assess specific 
strategies.

Potential Moderators of Associations of Coping and Emotion Regulation 

with Psychopathology

Given the absence of a comprehensive quantitative review of the association of coping and 
emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents, the 
primary focus of the current review is on the direct associations between these constructs. 
However, we recognize the importance of taking initial steps to examine constructs that may 
moderate these associations. Therefore, in addition to the direct association of coping and 
emotion regulation with internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in children and 
adolescents, we also examine age, measure quality, and informant as potential moderators of 
these associations in the meta-analysis that follows.

Age and Development

Processes of biological, cognitive, social, and emotional development during childhood and 
adolescence have implications for the development of coping and emotion regulation skills 
and their association with symptoms of psychopathology. Several reviews have outlined 
possible developmental patterns in coping and emotion regulation that would suggest 
increasing efficacy and flexibility in the use of specific strategies with age (Skinner & 
Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007, 2010; Thompson & Goodman, 2010; Zimmer-Gembeck & 
Skinner, 2011, 2016). Although these constructs have been analyzed relatively 
independently in developmentally focused research, several parallel themes in the 
development of coping and emotion regulation have emerged from these reviews. These 
include developmental shifts in the use of social partners in coping and regulating emotions 
vs. self-reliance to enact these processes, an increased ability to utilize cognitively complex 
processes (e.g., cognitive reappraisal), changes in the use of overt behavioral strategies (e.g., 
avoidance, distraction), and an increased capacity to use a wider range of strategies flexibly 
in response to stress or emotions (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007, 2010; Thompson & 
Goodman, 2010; Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011).

Although important developmental changes in the coping and emotion regulation may occur 
in infancy and toddlerhood (Thompson & Goodman, 2010), we focus here on early and 
middle childhood and adolescence because these are the developmental periods 
encompassed by the studies included in the current meta-analytic review. During early 
childhood, children’s increased understanding of emotions enables parents to shift from 
directly controlling children’s emotional reactions to coaching them in the development of 
emotion regulation strategies. In middle childhood, children begin to use strategies that are 
more cognitive in nature (e.g., cognitive reappraisal or distraction) as well as relaxation 
strategies to reduce physiological arousal (e.g., deep breathing) (Goodman & Thompson, 
2010). From middle childhood into adolescence, peer relationships gain importance and 
serve as a source of support as well as further learning about emotional experiences, norms 
for expression, and emotion regulation strategies. During middle and late adolescence, 
increased ability to think about one’s own and others’ emotions allows for more independent 
management of emotions. Additionally, the development of executive function skills allows 
adolescents to enlist additional cognitive emotion regulation strategies and to be more 
controlled in their expression of emotions (Thompson & Goodman, 2010).

In contrast, there is less clarity regarding the development of coping. This is due in part to 
inconsistencies in the measurement of coping across ages and studies, and in part because 
research has not been designed for the specific purpose of examining coping development 
(Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007; Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011). However, the 
aforementioned reviews provide evidence for developmental changes, many of which 
parallel changes in the development of emotion regulation. In early childhood (i.e., the 5 to 
7-year-old-shift) social support begins to incorporate peers in addition to a continued 
reliance on caregivers, and children use problem solving and behavioral distraction with 
increasing frequency. Further, as noted above, in middle childhood, cognitive strategies 
develop, support seeking becomes more complex, and the ability to take others’ perspectives 
and understand that different situations may require different coping responses begins to 
form. With increased reliance on cognitive strategies, declines in the use of behavioral 
strategies such as escape and avoidance are observed (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007; 
Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011). In adolescence, coping repertoires expand and coping 
efforts become more self-reliant. The importance of peers increases during adolescence, and 
adolescents continue to seek social support as a means of coping with stress; however, the 
majority of coping efforts are at the individual level with social partners in the role of a 
“back up system” if independent efforts fail (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2010, p. 19). 
Additionally, adolescents are more effective at selecting different sources of social support 
depending on the type of stressor (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007). Furthermore, with 
the development of meta-cognitive skills, adolescents achieve greater flexibility and 
sophistication in their coping, and coping strategies continue to become more cognitive in 
nature (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2010).

Especially relevant for the current study, the connections of coping and emotion regulation 
with psychopathology may become stronger as children develop and move into adolescence. 
As the implementation of coping and emotion regulation efforts increase in complexity, the 
stressful events and circumstances children and adolescents encounter likely also increase in 
complexity (Grant et al., 2006). Further, there is a significant increase in the incidence and 
prevalence of some forms of psychopathology in adolescence, including increased rates of 
anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and conduct problems (e.g., Copeland, Shanahan, 
Costello, & Angold, 2011). Notably, little research has been devoted to examining the 
developmental trajectory of both coping and emotion regulation and symptoms of 
psychopathology in tandem.

In order to further explore developmental variations in associations among coping and 
emotion regulation and psychopathology, we examined age as a moderator by testing these 
associations in studies with child samples as compared to adolescent samples. As noted 
above, this distinction captures a critical developmental transition, including increasing self-
reliance in coping, the use of peers as social resources, and the growth of meta-cognitive and 
executive function skills that may provide a foundation for the use of more complex 
cognitive coping and emotion regulation strategies (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2010; 
Thompson & Goodman, 2010).

Measure Quality

Page 14

The present review includes measures of coping and emotion regulation that meet at least 
the most basic psychometric criterion; i.e., the availability of data on internal consistency. 
More stringent criteria for evidence-based methods of assessment include test-retest 
reliability and construct and criterion validity (e.g., Blount et al., 2008); however, these 
standards are rarely met in measures of coping and emotion regulation. Only three coping 
measures (CCSC, Ayers et al. 1996; RSQ, Connor-Smith et al., 2000; PRI, Walker et al. 
1997) meet the criteria for top-down, theory-based measures of coping laid out by Skinner et 
al. (2003). These criteria include the use of CFA to test the fit of items into lower order 
coping categories and empirically examine hierarchical systems that also test the fit of 
multiple lower order ways of coping into higher order categories. Further, only three 
emotion regulation measures (DERS, Gratz & Roemer, 2004; ERQ, Gross & John, 2003; 
CEMS, Zeman et al., 2010) report on convergent and/or discriminant validity with other 
measures of emotion regulation or coping. Notably, the majority of validity data reported is 
from EFA or principal components analysis. These tests have typically not been replicated 
and therefore are not viewed as strong as tests of theoretically derived models that have been 
tested using CFA (Skinner et al., 2003).

Validity has also been examined infrequently through multi-informant reports of coping and 
emotion regulation (i.e., report from child and their caregiver). For example, the ways in 
which children cope with chronic pain as reported by parents and children have been shown 
to predict cross-informant reports of anxiety and depression in latent variable analyses 
(Compas et al., 2006b). Further, self-report coping questionnaires have been validated 
through associations with physiological measures, including glycemic control in children 
with diabetes (e.g., Jaser et al., 2012) and heart rate reactivity to laboratory stressors 
(Connor-Smith et al., 2000; Dufton, Dunn, Slosky, & Compas, 2011). Overall, the 
introduction of some psychometrically strong measures since the previous narrative analyses 
(e.g., Compas et al., 2001) suggests that more recent studies may reflect improvement in 
measurement quality.

Because of enduring concerns about the ability of questionnaires to adequately capture 
processes of coping and emotion regulation, we have included measurement quality as a 
potential moderator of effects in the meta-analysis that follows. To code measure quality, we 
used the criterion of the presence of data on the internal consistency of measures of domains, 
factors and strategies (see Rueger, Malecki, Pyun, Aycock, & Coyle, 2016; Skinner et al., 
2003).

The assessment of child and adolescent psychopathology has a long tradition of obtaining 
reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms from children’s and adolescents’ self-
reports and reports from other informants including parents, teachers, mental health 
professionals, and trained observers (e.g., Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987; De 
Los Reyes et al., 2015; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2012; Rescorla et al., 2013). 
By comparison, the measurement of coping and emotion regulation in young people has 
relied predominantly on self-report measures. The majority of the coping and emotion

regulation measures included in the current meta-analysis were designed only for self-report 
and a much smaller number were designed to only obtain reports from other informants 
(typically parents). As a consequence, much of the literature is characterized by studies that 
have relied on single informant report of both coping and emotion regulation and 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The use of the same informant for both constructs 
may artificially inflate the magnitude of these associations due to problems of shared 
method variance in the measures of coping and emotion regulation with measures of 
psychopathology (see LeGrange & Cole, 2008). As such, we have included the use of a 
single informant to assess both coping and emotion regulation and psychopathology vs. the 
use of different informants to assess these constructs (i.e., multi-informant) as a possible 
moderator of the magnitude of these associations.

Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Research Designs

Studies of the association of coping and emotion regulation with internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms have varied with regard to the use of cross-sectional vs. longitudinal 
designs. Cross-sectional designs cannot test the temporal sequence of the association 
between coping and emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing symptoms 
(Podsakoff et al., 2012). Although longitudinal designs cannot provide evidence for causal 
relations, these designs are a more rigorous test of the degree to which coping and emotion 
regulation account for variance in symptoms across time. Therefore, studies that include 
longitudinal data provide important tests of the association between coping and emotion 
regulation and symptoms of psychopathology over time. In the meta-analytic review below, 
we present findings for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies separately.

Stress, Emotions and Psychopathology in Children and Adolescents

The backdrop to research on coping and emotion regulation in children and adolescents lies 
in current conceptualizations of psychopathology, the role of exposure to stressful events and 
circumstances as a source of risk, and relations between stress and emotions. As summarized 
in a series of reviews by Grant and colleagues (Grant et al., 2003, 2006; Grant, Compas, 
Thurm, McMahon, & Gipson, 2004; Grant, McMahon, Duffy, Taylor, & Compas, 2011; 
McMahon, Grant, Compas, Thurm, & Ey, 2003), exposure to psychosocial stressors and 
conditions of chronic adversity is well established as a major risk factor for internalizing and 
externalizing psychopathology during childhood and adolescence. Grant et al. (2004) 
identified over 50 prospective longitudinal studies that provided evidence that exposure to 
stressful events and chronic adversity predicts increases in both internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms over time. Consistent with the heuristic model of Nolen-Hoeksema 
and Watkins (2011), exposure to stressful life events appears to function as a distal risk 
factor whose association with internalizing and externalizing symptoms is both mediated 
and moderated by more proximal factors, including the ways children and adolescents cope 
with stressful events and regulate their emotions (Grant et al., 2003, 2006). Further, 
McMahon et al. (2003) found evidence that exposure to stressful events and chronic 
adversity is a nonspecific risk factor that places children and adolescents at risk for the full 
range of internalizing and externalizing forms of psychopathology.

Exposure to stressors (i.e., environmental events or chronic conditions that objectively 
threaten the physical and/or psychological health of individuals) is distinct from the concept 
of psychological stress, which is defined as an internal state experienced by the individual 
rather than the occurrence of stressors in the environment (Grant et al., 2003). Psychological 
stress as a concept has been criticized as overly vague and has been supplanted by a focus on 
specific emotions (Gross, 1999, 2001; Lazarus, 1999, 2006). Further, research has moved 
toward an increasing emphasis on physiological aspects of the stress response system 
including reactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., Doom & Gunnar, 2013; 
Han, Miller, Cole, Zahn-Waxler, & Hasting, 2016) and cardiac vagal tone (e.g., McLaughlin, 
Alves, & Sheridan, 2014). With the shift in focus from psychological stress to specific 
emotions, research on emotion regulation has emphasized the importance of identifying and 
regulating discrete emotions including sadness, anger, and anxiety (e.g., Zeman, Cassano, 
Suveg, & Shipman, 2010; Zeman, Shipman, & Suveg, 2002). Further, in the process model 
of emotion regulation (e.g., Gross, 2001; Gross & Jazaieri, 2014; Gross, Sheppes, & Urry, 
2011), efforts are distinguished in the context of the phases of the emotion-generative 
process. The phases during which specific emotions are regulated include both antecedent-
focused strategies, which influence an emotion before it is fully formed, and response-
focused strategies, which influence an emotion once it has been fully developed. 
Antecedent-focused strategies include situation selection (e.g., avoidance of emotionally 
arousing situations), situation modification (e.g., problem solving), attentional deployment 
(e.g., distraction), and cognitive change (e.g., cognitive reappraisal), and response-focused 
strategies include response modulation (e.g., emotional suppression).

Together, this research suggests that it is important to consider both how children and 
adolescents cope with the occurrence of stressors in the form of stressful events and 
conditions of chronic adversity in the environment and regulate specific emotions as they 
arise in ongoing transactions with the environment. We return to these issues in the 
Discussion after presenting the findings of the current meta-analysis.

Dimensional and Categorical Features of Internalizing and Externalizing Psychopathology

Examination of the association of coping and emotion regulation with psychopathology also 
requires careful consideration of the nature of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and 
disorders, as this shaped the selection of relevant studies for inclusion in this meta-analysis. 
After a longstanding debate regarding the structure of psychopathology, a significant shift 
has occurred in the conceptualization of psychopathology, with recognition that symptoms 
of disorder occur both on continua as well as in discrete categories (Hyman, 2010; Rutter et 
al., 2011). Further, the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria 
(RDoC; Casey, Oliveri, & Insel, 2014; Insel, 2010; Insel & Cuthbert, 2015) represents a 
dimensional framework that conceptualizes mechanisms underlying psychopathology in five 
domains (negative valence systems, positive valence systems, cognitive systems, systems for 
social processes, and arousal and regulatory systems) that can be assessed across multiple 
levels of analysis.

The preponderance of research on coping and emotion regulation in children and adolescents 
has focused on dimensional approaches to psychopathology, reflected in both broad and

narrowband syndromes of psychopathology. Evidence for the broad factors of internalizing 
and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology and narrow subtypes within these broad 
categories initially described by Achenbach (1966) provides strong support for dimensional 
models (e.g., Krueger & Markon, 2006; Lahey, Van Hulle, Singh, Waldman, & Rathouz, 
2011; Seeley, Kosty, Farmer, & Lewinsohn, 2011). These dimensions have been identified in 
studies of children, adolescents, and adults and across a wide range of cultures and countries 
(e.g., Ivanova et al., 2007a; Ivanova et al., 2007b; Rescorla et al., 2012). In addition, 
Kraemer, Noda and O’Hara (2004) note that although both categorical and dimensional 
approaches are fundamentally equivalent, dimensional approaches are advantageous for 
hypothesis testing because of the loss of power associated with the use of categorical 
variables. Given the strong evidence for the broad dimensions of internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), these are the focus of the current 
review.

Evidence of the co-occurrence of symptoms and diagnostic comorbidity (Rhee, Lahey, & 
Waldman, 2015) both within and across internalizing and externalizing symptoms of 
psychopathology has led to research on sources of risk and resilience that are either specific 
to or common across multiple symptom dimensions and disorders. As reflected in the 212 
studies included in the current meta-analytic review, processes of coping and emotion 
regulation are prime candidates for transdiagnostic sources of risk and/or resilience in 
children and adolescents (Compas, Watson, Reising, & Dunbar, 2013).

Previous Reviews of the Association of Coping and Emotion Regulation 

with Psychopathology

Several reviews have examined the associations between coping and emotion regulation and 
symptoms of psychopathology in adults (e.g., Aldao et al., 2010; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012; 
Webb et al., 2012). In one of the most comprehensive meta-analyses to date, Aldao et al. 
(2010) estimated associations for dispositional measures of six emotion regulation strategies 
with four types of symptoms of psychopathology from 114 studies (108 studies with adults 
and 6 studies with children). This meta-analysis found medium to large positive associations 
for rumination with symptoms of anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and substance use, 
and small to medium positive associations for avoidance and suppression with symptoms of 
anxiety, depression, and disordered eating. In addition, they found small to medium negative 
associations for problem solving with anxiety, depression, and disordered eating, and a small 
negative association for reappraisal with symptoms of depression. No significant 
associations were found for acceptance. It is noteworthy that the emotion regulation 
strategies included in this review have also been commonly studied as examples of coping 
strategies (Aldao et al., 2010). The current review builds on this important meta-analysis by 
focusing exclusively on coping and emotion regulation in children and adolescents and using 
an inclusive framework for what is considered coping and emotion regulation.

In addition, several narrative reviews have examined the relations between coping and 
emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Eisenberg et al. (2010) 
described the association of children’s emotion regulation with internalizing and

externalizing problems. They reported a general pattern of negative associations between 
emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing problems in samples ranging from 
infancy through childhood and adolescence. More narrowly focused reviews have examined 
coping and emotion regulation with specific samples or subgroups and specific outcomes. 
Examples include adolescents coping with social stressors (Clarke, 2006), adolescents 
coping with relationship stressors (Seiffge-Krenke, 2011), children coping with the chronic 
stress associated with poverty (Evans & Kim, 2013), and children and adolescents coping 
with chronic illness (Aldridge & Roesch, 2007; Blount et al., 2008; Compas et al., 2012). 
We extend these narrative reviews by conducting a meta-analysis to estimate the associations 
of a broad range of domains, factors, and strategies of coping and emotion regulation in 
response to a wide range of stressors and emotions with symptoms of internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms in children and adolescents.

In one of the only previous meta-analyses of coping and emotion regulation in childhood 
and adolescence, Clarke (2006) examined the relations between active coping and 
psychosocial health among youth in 40 studies of coping with interpersonal stress. Four 
areas of psychosocial functioning were examined: externalizing and internalizing behavior 
problems, social competence, and academic performance. The association between active 
coping and psychosocial functioning across the four areas examined was small, with 
correlations ranging from .02 to .12 (Clarke, 2006). In a second meta-analysis of 26 studies 
including children and adolescents, Aldridge and Roesch (2007) examined how children 
cope with cancer-related stress based on two coping taxonomies: approach vs. avoidance 
coping and problem-focused vs. emotion-focused coping. In this analysis, approach, 
avoidance, and emotion-focused coping were unrelated to overall adjustment. A small 
positive association was found between problem-focused coping and adjustment, indicating 
use of problem-focused coping was associated with poorer adjustment. Most recently 
Schäfer, Naumann, Holmes, Tuschen-Caffier, and Samson (2017) conducted a meta-analysis 
of the association between emotion regulation strategies and symptoms of depression and 
anxiety in adolescence. Results from this review of 35 studies indicated that emotion 
regulation strategies considered to be adaptive (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and 
acceptance) were significantly negatively related to symptoms of anxiety and depression and 
those considered to be maladaptive (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) were 
significantly positively related to symptoms of depression and anxiety. The present meta-
analysis builds on these reviews by integrating a larger and more inclusive set of studies of 
coping and emotion regulation in response to a wider range of stressors and emotions and 
including studies of both internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

The most recent comprehensive review of coping and internalizing and externalizing 
psychopathology in childhood and adolescence appeared 16 years ago (Compas et al., 2001). 
This review provided a summary of findings from 63 published studies that reported on 
analyses of coping and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in 
children and adolescents. The authors conducted a narrative review as a function of two 
broad dimensions of coping: engagement vs. disengagement coping and problem-focused 
vs. emotion-focused coping. The general pattern of findings suggested that forms of 
engagement coping and problem-focused coping were associated with lower internalizing 
and externalizing symptoms. In contrast, disengagement coping and emotion-focused coping

were generally associated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. 
However, this review did not provide quantitative analyses of these patterns of findings.

In spite of these contributions from recent reviews, several key issues have not yet been 
examined. First, none of these reviews have explicitly included processes of both coping and 
emotion regulation in children and adolescents. Second, measures of coping and emotion 
regulation have not been evaluated with regard to their psychometric quality. Third, there has 
been no quantitative meta-analysis of the associations of coping and emotion regulation with 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children and adolescents.

The Present Study: Meta-Analysis

To determine the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of 
internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in children and adolescents, we examine 
studies from 2001 through 2012 in which these constructs were measured. Our goal is to 
estimate effect sizes for broad domains, intermediate factors, and specific strategies of 
coping and emotion regulation. We examine effects for internalizing symptoms and 
externalizing symptoms of psychopathology.

We address three central questions: (1) Are broad domains of coping and emotion regulation 
associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in children 
and adolescents? (2) Are intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation associated 
with internalizing and externalizing symptoms? (3) Are specific coping and emotion 
regulation strategies associated with total internalizing and externalizing symptoms? We also 
examine three potential moderators of these associations: age, measure quality, and 
informant (i.e., single informant vs. multiple informant). We also examine findings 
separately for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. We consider the implications of the 
answers to these questions for the conceptualization of coping and emotion regulation, the 
measurement of these constructs, and directions for future research.

Method

Literature Search

We searched for empirical reports published from January 2001 to December 2012 to 
identify articles that examined coping or emotion regulation in relation to internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents. The start date of 
2001 covers articles since the last comprehensive review of coping and internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms in children and adolescents (Compas et al., 2001). We selected the 
date of this earlier review as the starting point for the current meta-analysis because this 
marked a significant shift in the measures that were most frequently used to measure coping 
and emotion regulation. Our systematic literature search was conducted using the PsycINFO 
database, with the specific search terms coping OR emotion regulation AND child* (for 
child or children) OR adolesc*(for adolescents or adolescence) across all fields (i.e., title, 
abstract, keywords). We further limited the search to peer-reviewed, English language 
journal articles. The initial search process yielded 7,085 articles (see Figure 1 for a PRISMA 
flow diagram). In addition, we supplemented our search by reviewing the reference sections

of published review articles on coping and emotion regulation, yielding an additional 24 
articles. A brief review of the titles and abstracts resulted in 1,107 articles that appeared to 
report an association between coping or emotion regulation and psychopathology in children 
or adolescents. Based on inclusion criteria outlined below, 212 studies were included in the 
quantitative meta-analysis. Book chapters, non-peer reviewed journal articles, review 
articles, and dissertations were not included, consistent with recent meta-analytic reviews of 
coping and emotion regulation (e.g., Aldao et al., 2010). We believed that restricting our 
search to published peer-reviewed articles would yield higher quality studies. Further, we 
reduced the concern for file-drawer effects by including all reported effects of coping or 
emotion regulation in each study, including non-significant effects.

Inclusion Criteria

The following criteria determined the selection of studies included in the meta-analysis:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Studies were included if they assessed children or adolescents between the ages 
of 5 to 19-years-old. We excluded studies that included younger children (infants 
or preschool age) because the methodologies used to study coping and emotion 
regulation in children under age 5 differ substantially from those used with 
school-aged children (e.g., observation of behavior to draw inferences about 
regulatory strategies). Further, research on the development of coping and 
emotion regulation indicates that infants and preschool age children have not yet 
fully developed the cognitive skills needed to employ many of the more complex 
cognitive strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, problem solving) that are the 
focus of this review (Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2016). We excluded older 
adolescents (i.e., age 20) to avoid confounding our results with college age 
samples.

Studies were included if they used a measure of coping and/or emotion 
regulation that reported reliability data in the study sample or if reliability data 
for that measure was reported elsewhere in the literature (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha). 
Further, because reliability cannot be calculated with two items or less, coping or 
emotion regulation scales with fewer than three items were excluded from 
analyses.

Studies were included if they measured reports of coping and/or emotion 
regulation in response to emotions or actual stressors or events. Measures that 
elicited responses to hypothetical scenarios, or asked participants how they 
would cope or regulate their emotions in a given situation, were excluded.

Studies were included if measures of coping and/or emotion regulation assessed 
controlled processes. Coping and/or emotion regulation scales that may reflect 
more automatic or involuntary responses to stress (e.g., catastrophizing, 
rumination, emotional or physiological reactivity) were excluded from analyses.

Studies were included if they used at least one reliable measure of internalizing 
or externalizing symptoms of psychopathology. The measures that were included 
in these studies are widely used in research on child and adolescent 
psychopathology (see Table 3 for a list of the measures used in the included

studies). Similar to the criteria for coping and emotion regulation measures, we 
did not include psychopathology measures that consisted of only one or two 
items (e.g., alcohol use in past week).

6.

7.

Studies were included if they reported a test of the relationship between coping 
and/or emotion regulation and internalizing and/or externalizing symptoms, and 
if the study reported adequate statistics to calculate effect sizes. Thus, qualitative 
studies were not included.

Studies were excluded if they involved experimental manipulation of coping 
and/or emotion regulation (e.g., intervention studies). However, if pre-
intervention tests of the association between coping and/or emotion regulation 
with symptoms of internalizing or externalizing psychopathology were reported, 
these were included in the meta-analysis.

Data Coding Procedure

A standard procedure was used to structure the coding process. Each study was coded for the 
measure of coping and/or emotion regulation, the measure of internalizing and/or 
externalizing psychopathology, including scale reliabilities, sample size, and the statistics 
describing the relationship between coping or emotion regulation and psychopathology. We 
also recorded descriptive information, including year of publication and the country where 
the study was conducted. Studies using modified versions of validated measures were noted. 
Each study was independently coded by two of the study authors, and coding discrepancies 
were resolved through discussion between the authors of the meta-analysis.

As noted above, coping and emotion regulation scales were coded into three levels: domains, 
factors, and strategies (see Appendix). Each coping and emotion regulation domain, factor, 
and strategy was independently coded by two of the study authors (89.1% inter-rater 
reliability), and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The broad domains of 
coping and emotion regulation included (1) total coping (e.g., self-coping, unitary coping), 
(2) emotion regulation (e.g., adaptive affect regulation, sadness regulation, anger 
management, palliative emotion regulation), (3) emotion dysregulation (e.g., abreacting, 
dysregulation), (4) adaptive coping (e.g., adaptive coping, positive coping, productive 
coping), and (5) maladaptive coping (e.g., dysfunctional coping, helpless coping, negative 
coping, nonproductive coping).

Second, we identified intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation that included 
(1) problem-focused (e.g., problem-directed coping, task-oriented coping), (2) emotion-
focused (e.g., emotional engagement, internal coping, emotion-oriented coping), (3) 
engagement/approach (e.g., active coping, approach coping, behavioral coping), (4) 
disengagement (e.g., behavioral disengagement, passive coping, detached coping), (5) 
primary control coping (e.g., primary control coping), (6) secondary control coping (e.g., 
accommodative coping), and (7) social support coping (e.g., asking for help, developing 
social support, seeking guidance, support coping).

Finally, specific coping and emotion regulation strategies were categorized into (1) problem 
solving (e.g., cognitive problem solving, decision making, planning), (2) emotional

expression (e.g., expressing feelings, verbal sharing), (3) emotional suppression (e.g., anger 
inhibition, expressive reluctance, repression), (4) cognitive reappraisal (e.g., minimization, 
positive reappraisal, rationalization), (5) distraction (e.g., behavioral distraction, 
entertainment, seeking diversions), (6) acceptance (e.g., rational acceptance, resignation), (7) 
avoidance (e.g., avoidant activities, cognitive distancing, withdrawal), (8) denial (e.g., 
blaming others, defensive coping), and (9) wishful thinking (e.g., fantasizing, imagining), 
(10) emotional modulation (e.g., anger control, relaxation, tension reduction), (11) 
unregulated release of emotions (e.g., emotional discharge, externalizing negative coping, 
vent coping), and (12) humor (e.g., humor).

Similarly, the psychopathology measures were coded into categories of dependent variables. 
Based on the well-validated measures of Achenbach System of Empirically Based 
Assessment (ASEBA) of behavioral and emotional problems (Achenbach & Rescorla, 
2001), the broadband categories of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were used. 
Internalizing symptoms included measures of depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints, 
and externalizing symptoms included measures of aggression, conduct problems, and 
substance use.

All analyses were conducted with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program (Borenstein, 
Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2005), using random effects models, as the studies varied in 
methodology and design, using study as the unit of analysis and the mean of the selected 
outcomes. The mean effect size for each study (r) was used as the level of analysis; 
therefore, if a single study tested associations between multiple coping strategies or 
symptoms within the same category, the mean effect size was calculated. Similarly, when 
authors published different studies using the same sample or a smaller subset of the same 
sample, a mean effect size was used in analysis. When studies selectively reported only 
significant associations (e.g., “All other correlations were non-significant”), missing tests 
were conservatively coded as r = .00. As such, 54 effect sizes were estimated as .00. 
Excluding these non-significant effect sizes would have biased the meta-analysis, potentially 
overestimating the mean effect size for the association between coping and emotion 
regulation and symptoms. We utilized Cohen’s (1988) guidelines to interpret the magnitude 
of the effect size for significant correlations (i.e., r = .10 as small, .30 as medium, and 
above .50 as large).

In analyses, we used correlations or mean differences where reported. In line with other 
recent meta-analyses (e.g., Robles, Slatcher, Trombello, & McGinn, 2014), if the only 
statistic reported was from a multivariate analysis (standardized β), we converted the β to r 
using the formula (r = β + .05λ, where λ equals 0 when the β is negative and λ equals 1 
when the β is nonnegative) recommended by Peterson and Brown (2005). Effect sizes in 
meta-analyses based on very small number of studies are subject to problem in data 
synthesis (Davey, Turner, Clarke, & Higgins, 2011); therefore, we set a threshold of a 
minimum of five studies (k = 5) to estimate effect sizes for the cross-sectional studies. 
However, because there were relatively few longitudinal studies (k = 17), we set the 
threshold at a minimum of three studies (k = 3) to estimate effects for longitudinal analyses.

For each coping and emotion regulation domain, factor, and strategy with internalizing and 
externalizing psychopathology, weighted mean effect sizes (r), 95% confidence intervals, 
and estimated a heterogeneity statistic (Q) were calculated using the procedures outlined by 
Hedges and Olking (1985). The 95% confidence intervals on the effect sizes represent the 
range in which the mean effect size falls in 95% of cases; the calculation for confidence 
intervals (lower limit and upper limit) is as follows:

LLCI = M* − Z V M*

ULCI = M* − Z V M*

where M* is the mean effect size in the sample, Z is the critical z value representing the 
confidence level, and VM* is the variance of M* (Borenstein et al., 2005). A mean effect is 
considered significant when the confidence interval does not include zero. The number of 
studies (k), total sample size (N), mean effect size (r) and significance value of the effect, 
95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the mean effect size, and Q statistic and its 
significance value are reported for cross-sectional analyses in Table 4 and for longitudinal 
analyses in the text below.

Moderation.—For cross-sectional analyses, categorical moderator analyses were 
conducted to determine whether age, measure quality, or informant significantly moderated 
the associations between coping and emotion regulation and symptoms of psychopathology. 
A significant Q statistic indicates that there is significant heterogeneity within the studies 
contributing to the overall effect size, and suggests that there may be moderating variables to 
consider (Borenstein et al., 2009). As such, for any cross-sectional effect size with a 
significant Q statistic, we ran analyses to determine whether age, measure quality, or 
informant significantly moderated associations between coping and emotion regulation and 
symptoms of psychopathology. Consistent with previous meta-analyses, a minimum of three 
studies (k = 3) per level of the moderator was required for moderator analyses (e.g., Slaget et 
al., 2016).

First, we coded the study sample as “child” (mean age 5–10) or “adolescent” (mean age 11–
19), using the mean age of each sample. Second, measures were coded as “high quality” if 
they were based on a conceptual model of coping or emotion regulation and if reliability and 
convergent or discriminant validity data were reported. Studies were coded as “adequate 
quality” if the measure used reported only reliability data or minimal information on 
validity, following criteria for measurement quality described in previous reviews and meta-
analyses (e.g., Rueger, Malecki, Pyun, Aycock, & Coyle, 2016; Skinner et al., 2003). Finally, 
we coded studies as “single informant” if the same respondent completed the measure of 
coping and emotion regulation and psychopathology. Studies were coded as “multi-
informant” if one informant reported on the child’s coping and emotion regulation and 
another informant reported on child’s symptoms.

In the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program, associations within studies were treated as 
non-independent. As such, when a study reported associations for both levels of a moderator 
variable (e.g., reported effects for the same category of coping/emotion regulation and 
symptoms for both children and adolescent samples), the effect sizes from the study were 
not included in the analysis. For both levels of the moderating variable, the number of 
studies (k), total sample size (N), mean effect size (r), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
for the mean effect size are reported, in addition to the mixed effects total between groups 
factor (Qb) and its significance level.

Publication bias.—Several steps were taken to investigate the possibility of publication 
bias, which occurs as a result of selective publication of research findings based on the 
direction and size of the results. It is important for meta-analytic studies to assess its 
presence and impact, because this systematic bias can lead to an inflated effect size 
estimates and inaccurate conclusions. First, we visually examined the funnel plot for each 
significant effect size. The funnel plot for an effect size is a plot of the standard error of each 
study contributing to the overall effect size (a reflection of sample size) on the y-axis with 
the study’s effect estimate on the x-axis. The effect estimate should be more precise with 
increasing sample size. As such, in the absence of publication bias, effect estimates from 
studies with smaller sample sizes should be scattered symmetrically at the bottom of the plot 
and center more closely around the mean effect estimate at the top of the plot as the sample 
size increases, which creates a funnel shape. In the presence of publication bias, the plot will 
appear asymmetrical, suggesting that small samples reporting small to non-significant effect 
sizes were less likely to be published.

Second, we calculated Egger’s tests to assist in the interpretation of the funnel plots, which 
is a statistical test used to detect funnel plot asymmetry (Egger et al., 1997). Of note, the 
Egger’s test has been reported to have lower power when used for associations with fewer 
than 10 studies (Higgins & Green, 2011).

Third, we conducted trim and fill analyses (Duval & Tweedie, 2000) to determine how many 
studies would need to be included above or below the meta-analytic mean to make the 
funnel plot symmetrical. A higher number of studies denotes greater publication bias. Trim 
and fill analyses also impute the missing studies and calculate adjusted meta-analytic effect 
sizes that account for publication bias.

Based on the inclusion criteria, a total of 212 studies with 80,850 participants were included 
in the analyses (see Table 3 for study details). Of the included studies, 24 studies conducted 
different analyses using the same sample or variants of the same sample. Several studies 
reported associations separately for subsamples (e.g., boys vs. girls), and some studies 
reported more than one measure of coping and emotion regulation or psychopathology. The 
number of associations ranged from 1 to 55 per article, with most articles reporting multiple 
effect sizes, providing a total of 1,649 effects coded for the meta-analysis. Forty-two studies 
used measures of emotion regulation, 169 studies used measures of coping, and one study 
referred to “emotion regulation coping.” Forty-six studies included a child sample, 163

studies included an adolescent sample, and three studies included both child and adolescent 
samples. Seventy-four studies used measures classified as “high quality”, and 138 studies 
used measures classified as “adequate quality”. One hundred and fifty-eight studies used 
reports from single informants, 30 studies used reports from multiple informants, and 24 
studies reported both single and multiple informant reports. There were not a sufficient 
number of studies to calculate cross-sectional (k = 5 or more) or longitudinal (k = 3 or more) 
effect sizes for emotion modulation, unregulated release of emotions, and humor with 
internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Therefore, these three strategies are not included in 
Table 4 and are not presented in the results.

Cross-Sectional Effect Sizes

Effect sizes for the cross-sectional studies of the coping and emotion regulation domains, 
factors, and strategies and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms are presented in 
Table 4 and summarized below.

Domains.—Maladaptive coping was significantly positively associated with internalizing 
symptoms, indicating greater use of maladaptive coping was associated with higher levels of 
symptoms. A negative effect size was found for adaptive coping and externalizing 
symptoms, indicating greater use of adaptive coping was associated with lower symptoms. 
Emotion regulation was significantly negatively associated with both internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms, such that greater use of emotion regulation was associated with 
lower levels of symptoms. All other effect sizes for domains of coping and emotion 
regulation were non-significant or could not be calculated due to too few studies (k < 5) 
examining that particular domain (see Table 4).

Factors.—Engagement/approach coping was significantly negatively associated with 
internalizing symptoms, such that greater use of engagement/approach coping was 
associated with lower symptoms. A significant negative effect size was found for problem-
focused coping and externalizing symptoms, indicating greater use of problem-focused 
coping was associated with lower symptoms. Disengagement coping was significantly 
positively associated with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms, such that greater 
use of disengagement coping was related to higher levels of symptoms. Both primary control 
coping and secondary control coping were significantly negatively associated with 
symptoms. Thus, greater use of these coping factors was related to lower internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms. All other effect sizes for factors of coping and emotion regulation 
were non-significant (see Table 4).

Strategies.—Emotional suppression and denial were significantly positively associated 
with internalizing symptoms, and avoidance was significantly positively associated with 
both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. That is, greater use of emotional 
suppression, denial and avoidance was associated with higher levels of symptoms. All other 
effect sizes for coping and emotion regulation strategies were non-significant or could not be 
calculated due to too few studies (k < 5) examining that particular strategy (see Table 4).

Heterogeneity of effect sizes.—For all calculated cross-sectional effects, with the 
exception of two effect sizes, there was a significant Q statistic (see Table 4). For all cross-
sectional associations with a significant Q statistic, we analyzed age, measure quality, and 
informant as potential moderators. The Q statistic for maladaptive coping and internalizing 
symptoms and for emotional suppression and externalizing symptoms was not significant, 
and therefore moderator analyses were not conducted for these associations.

Moderator Analyses

Moderation analyses for the cross-sectional studies of the coping and emotion regulation 
domains, factors, and strategies are presented in Table 5 and the text below.

Age.—At the domain level, there were no significant moderating effects of age for the 
domains of adaptive coping or emotion regulation (see Table 5).

Among factors of coping and emotion regulation, age was a significant moderator for the 
association between engagement/approach coping and internalizing symptoms. Specifically, 
there was a significant negative association between engagement/approach coping and 
internalizing symptoms for adolescents, but not children. However, age was not a significant 
moderator of the relationship between engagement/approach coping and externalizing 
symptoms. All other effect sizes that could be estimated at the factor level of coping and 
emotion regulation with age as a moderator were non-significant (see Table 5).

For strategies of coping and emotion regulation, age was a significant moderator of the 
association between cognitive reappraisal and internalizing symptoms such that the 
association was larger for adolescents than for children. A significant moderating effect for 
age was also found for emotional suppression and internalizing symptoms, indicating this 
association was significant for adolescent samples but not child samples. All other effects of 
coping and emotion regulation strategies that could be estimated with age as a moderator 
were non-significant (see Table 5).

Measure quality.—There were no significant moderating effects of measure quality for 
domains, factors or strategies of coping and emotion regulation (see Table 5).

Informant.—For domains, factors, and strategies of coping and emotion regulation, 
informant for measures of coping and symptoms yielded no significant moderator effects 
(see Table 5).

Longitudinal Effect Sizes

As noted above, given the small number of longitudinal studies (k = 17; sample sizes ranged 
from n = 68 to 1,444) in the current meta-analysis, we calculated effects for any domain, 
factor, or strategy that had three or more studies contributing to the effect size.

Domains.—At the domain level, only one effect size could be calculated. Emotion 
regulation was not significantly associated with internalizing symptoms (k = 3, r = −.08, p 
= .52, 95% CI [−. −.37, .22]).

Factors.—Seven effect sizes could be calculated for factors of coping and emotion 
regulation, and two were significant. Disengagement coping (k = 4, r = .18, p = .01, 95% CI 
[.04, .31]) and social support coping (k = 4, r = .12, p < .001, 95% CI [.05, .18]) were 
significantly positively associated with internalizing symptoms. That is, greater use of 
disengagement coping and social support coping was associated with higher levels of 
internalizing symptoms. However, social support coping was not significantly associated 
with externalizing symptoms (k = 4, r = −.02, p = .72, 95% CI [−.12, .09]). Primary control 
coping (k = 3, r = −.07, p = .58, CI [−.29, .16]) and secondary control coping (k = 5, r = 
−.00, p = .90, CI [−.07, .07]) were not significantly associated with internalizing symptoms. 
Further, engagement/approach coping was not associated with internalizing symptoms (k = 
9, r = −.02, p = .76, 95% CI [−.16, .12]) or externalizing symptoms (k = 5, r = .05, p = .20, 
95% CI [−.03, .12]).

Strategies.—Four effect sizes could be calculated for coping and emotion regulation 
strategies, and one was significant. Avoidance was significantly positively associated with 
internalizing symptoms (k = 6, r = .08, p = .003, 95% CI [.03, .13]), such that greater use of 
avoidance was associated with higher internalizing symptoms. However, avoidance was not 
significantly associated with externalizing symptoms (k = 4, r = .04, p = .62, 95% CI 
[−.12, .19]). In addition, distraction was not significantly associated with either internalizing 
(k = 4, r = −.02, p = .55, 95% CI [−.11, .06]) or externalizing (k = 3, r = .02, p = .60, 95% CI 
[−.06, .10]) symptoms.

Heterogeneity of effect sizes.—For longitudinal associations, all but four effect sizes 
had a significant Q statistic. The Q statistic for the association between emotion regulation, 
engagement/approach coping, disengagement coping, and primary control coping with 
internalizing symptoms was significant. In addition, the Q statistic for the association 
between avoidance and social support with externalizing symptoms was significant. As such, 
there was significant heterogeneity within the studies contributing to these overall effect 
sizes. However, due to the small number of studies contributing to these effect sizes, we did 
not analyze potential moderators of these relationships.

Publication Bias

Of the 16 significant cross-sectional effect sizes, four effect sizes produced significant 
Egger’s tests, and of the three significant longitudinal effect sizes, none of these effect sizes 
produced significant Egger’s tests. First, at the domain level, the Egger’s test for the cross-
sectional association between emotion regulation and internalizing symptoms (k = 15, 
regression intercept = −5.03, 95% CI [−9.62, −0.44]) as well as externalizing symptoms (k = 
18, regression intercept = −4.63, 95% CI [−8.85, −0.41]) was significant. Second, at the 
factor level, the Egger’s test for the cross-sectional association between disengagement 
coping and externalizing symptoms (k = 7, regression intercept = −3.50, 95% CI [−6.30, 
−0.69]) was significant. Finally, at the strategy level, there was a significant Egger’s test for 
the cross-sectional association between emotional suppression and internalizing symptoms 
(k = 10, regression intercept = −6.91, 95% CI [−10.18, −3.64]).

The funnel plots for the four effect sizes with significant Egger’s tests are presented 
separately in Figure 2. A visual inspection of these plots shows data asymmetry for these 
effect estimates, suggesting that they may be affected by publication bias. It is noteworthy 
that data asymmetry was not evident in the other 12 significant cross-sectional effect 
estimates or the three longitudinal effect estimates.

As a third step, we conducted trim and fill analyses for all significant meta-analytic effect 
sizes. The results of the trim and fill analyses are presented as adjusted effect sizes in Table 
4. Of the 16 significant cross-sectional effect sizes, six effect sizes required values to be 
added to create a symmetrical funnel plot. Of these six effect sizes, five remained significant. 
Notably, all five significant adjusted effect sizes were smaller in magnitude as a result of the 
trim and fill analyses. The effect size for the association between engagement coping and 
internalizing symptoms was no longer significant as a result of the trim and fill analyses.

For the longitudinal analyses, the effect size for the association between disengagement 
coping and internalizing symptoms had no values that needed to be added as a result of the 
trim and fill analyses. Two longitudinal effect sizes required values to be added to create a 
symmetrical funnel plot. Of these two effect sizes, the effect size for the association between 
social support and internalizing symptoms remained significant, and the effect size for the 
association between avoidance and internalizing symptoms was no longer significant.

Discussion

Coping and emotion regulation play central roles in models of risk and resilience for 
psychopathology in children and adolescents. In spite of the importance of these constructs, 
there has been no comprehensive quantitative meta-analysis of their association with 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms in childhood and adolescence. The primary goal of 
this meta-analysis is to address this gap and determine if there is evidence for an association 
of domains, factors, and strategies of coping and emotion regulation with internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms of psychopathology. The results of the meta-analysis lead to an 
answer of a qualified yes. Evidence of publication bias was found in both the cross-sectional 
and longitudinal analyses, yet clear evidence was found for significant associations between 
coping and emotion regulation and symptoms of internalizing and externalizing 
psychopathology, as the majority of findings remained significant after adjusting for 
publication bias. However, progress in the field has become stagnant with regard to both 
conceptualization and methodology. We summarize the findings from our meta-analysis as a 
benchmark of the current state of the field, followed by a critique and a proposed agenda for 
improving our understanding of coping and emotion regulation in children and adolescents.

Meta-analytic Findings

The current meta-analysis drew on a large body of evidence from 212 studies with 80,850 
participants. Significant findings were found for associations between specific domains, 
factors and strategies of coping and emotion regulation with internalizing and externalizing 
symptoms of psychopathology in cross-sectional studies. Tests of three possible moderators 
(age, measure quality, single vs. multiple informant) yielded relatively few significant

moderation effects. Further, substantially fewer significant effect sizes were found in 
longitudinal studies as compared to cross-sectional studies.

Publication bias.—All publication bias methods have limitations and no one approach is 
fully accurate; therefore, we have included multiple approaches to considering publication 
bias to help better approximate accurate estimations of effect sizes in the literature to date. 
Evidence was found for the possible influence of publication bias in both the cross-sectional 
and longitudinal findings. Four of the 16 significant cross-sectional effects had a significant 
Egger’s test, although none of the three significant longitudinal effects had significant 
Egger’s tests. Inspection of the funnel plots associated with the four significant Egger’s tests 
suggested possible publication bias in cross-sectional analyses. Further, the trim and fill 
analyses indicated publication bias for six of the 16 cross-sectional effect sizes. However, 
only one cross-sectional effect size was no longer significant in the adjusted analyses. Trim 
and fill analyses indicated publication bias in two of the three significant longitudinal 
effects, and one of these longitudinal effect sizes was no longer significant in the adjusted 
analyses. Taken together, the overall pattern found in the unadjusted analyses was retained in 
the adjusted effect sizes. However, because we focused only on published studies we cannot 
rule out possible additional effects of publication bias on the findings in the current meta-
analysis.

Cross-sectional studies.—At the domain level, significant effect sizes ranged from 
small to medium in magnitude (unadjusted and adjusted ranged from r = −.11 to .27). 
Significant medium negative associations were found for the broad domain of emotion 
regulation with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms and a small significant 
negative association was found for the broad domain of adaptive coping with externalizing 
symptoms. Conversely, a significant medium positive association was found between 
maladaptive coping and internalizing symptoms. These findings are important in providing 
the first quantitative evidence that broad measures of both coping and emotion regulation are 
associated with symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents.

However, a closer examination of the items included in the broad domains of coping and 
emotion regulation suggests that they provide relatively limited information about what 
children and adolescents do to regulate their emotions or cope with stress. For example, the 
emotion regulation subscale of the ERC (Shields & Cicchetti, 1997) includes items such as, 
“Displays appropriate negative emotions in response to hostile, aggressive, or intrusive acts 
by peers;” “Transitions well from one activity to another; does not become anxious, angry, 
distressed, or overly excited when moving from one activity to another;” and “Is able to 
delay gratification.” Similarly, the emotion regulation coping subscale from the CEMS (e.g., 
Zeman, Shipman, & Penza-Clyve, 2011; Zeman et al., 2010) includes: “I keep myself from 
losing control of my worried/angry/sad feelings;” “I try to calmly settle the problem when I 
feel worried/mad/sad.” These items reflect descriptions of the degree to which children are 
able to regulate their emotions but do not include information about the strategies used to 
achieve regulation. We discuss this limitation in more detail below when we consider 
findings from the meta-analysis at the level of intermediate factors and specific strategies. 
Further, findings on the use of maladaptive coping are largely tautological. That is, if coping

and emotion regulation are labeled a priori as maladaptive or dysregulated then it is circular 
to show that these strategies are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. 
Therefore, we suggest that researchers discontinue the use of measures that label coping and 
emotion regulation as adaptive or maladaptive on an a priori basis in favor of measures that 
provide more detailed descriptions of factors or strategies that are used to cope with stress 
and regulate emotions.

We found evidence that intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation are associated 
with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The general factor of engagement/
approach coping had small but significant negative associations with internalizing 
symptoms; however, this effect was no longer significant after adjusting for possible 
publication bias. Disengagement coping had small significant positive associations with both 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The most consistent factor-level evidence was 
found for primary control coping and secondary control coping, both of which were 
significantly negatively associated with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms with 
the effect sizes ranging from small to medium in magnitude (unadjusted and adjusted effect 
sizes ranged from r = −.14 to −.30). These findings suggest that the control-based model that 
includes primary and secondary control coping has promise for understanding types of 
coping that are related to lower levels of symptoms (Compas et al., 2012, 2014a). At the 
time of the last comprehensive review of coping in children and adolescents (Compas et al., 
2001), problem-focused and emotion-focused coping were the most commonly studied 
factors. Therefore it is noteworthy that in the current meta-analysis, problem-focused coping 
had only a small negative association with internalizing symptoms and neither of the effect 
sizes for emotion-focused coping was significant. It appears that problem-focused and 
emotion-focused coping have played a smaller role in research on coping in children and 
adolescents in the past decade and may have been supplanted at the factor level by primary 
control and secondary control coping, both in terms of the frequency that they are studied 
and the magnitude of effects they produce. Finally, social support coping continues to be 
widely studied, yet, despite having enough studies to calculate effect sizes, we found no 
significant associations between social support and symptoms of psychopathology. While 
these findings suggest that using social support may not be an effective means of coping or 
regulating emotions for children and adolescents, it is also plausible that measures of social 
support may not be capturing the way that social networks are used by children and 
adolescents to cope with stress and regulate emotions (see Rueger et al., 2016, for a meta-
analysis of available and enacted social support and depressive symptoms in adolescence).

It is important to note that, although there are no emotion regulation measures that are 
categorized at the factor level, emotion regulation strategies are embedded within factors 
derived from coping measures. For example, primary control coping includes problem 
solving, emotional expression, and emotional modulation; secondary control coping includes 
cognitive reappraisal, distraction, and acceptance; and disengagement coping includes 
avoidance and wishful thinking (Connor-Smith et al., 2000). All of these strategies are also 
included in studies of emotion regulation (Aldao et al., 2010; Gross & Jazaieri, 2014; 
Sheppes, Suri, & Goss, 2015). Thus, findings regarding coping factors also provide indirect 
support for emotion regulation factors and highlight the somewhat artificial distinctions

between these constructs in terms of current approaches to measurement. We return to this 
issue in our proposed directions for future research.

In spite of the hope that measures of specific strategies would yield a more detailed and 
nuanced picture of the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms, there 
was relatively little evidence at the level of strategies. Small but significant positive 
associations with symptoms were found for emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial. 
However, none of the other 11 effect sizes that could be estimated were significant. These 
findings differ from those reported by Aldao et al. (2010) and Schäfer et al. (2017) which 
found significant associations between specific strategies (e.g., avoidance, acceptance) and 
symptoms of psychopathology. This discrepancy may be due in part to differences in 
measurement; while the studies included in the current meta-analysis included reports of 
how children and adolescents coped with or regulated specific stressors or emotions, the 
studies included in the reviews by both Aldao and Schafer focused on dispositional or 
“habitual” use of strategies, or how individuals typically respond to stressors.

Overall this pattern of findings presents a challenge for the field. The limited findings for 
measures assessing specific strategies of coping and emotion regulation may reflect 
problems in the quality of these measures (e.g., a limited number of items in these scales). 
Alternatively, this may suggest that examining specific strategies in isolation may provide 
only a partial picture of the ways that individuals use multiple strategies to regulate their 
emotions and cope with stress. That is, effective coping and emotion regulation may require 
a repertoire of skills that can be used flexibly in response to different emotions or stressors 
(e.g., Aldao, Sheppes, & Gross, 2015; Cheng, Lau, & Chen, 2014). The most consistent 
effect sizes in the current meta-analysis were found for measures that aggregate coping and 
emotion regulation strategies into intermediate-level factors. This level of analysis may 
capture cohesive factors of coping and emotion regulation strategies that are often used 
together and provide a more complete picture of how these strategies function in relation to 
symptoms of psychopathology. For example, the effect sizes for cognitive reappraisal and 
acceptance were not significant but the use of secondary control coping, which includes 
these two strategies along with distraction, was significantly associated with fewer 
symptoms.

In spite of the potential benefits that may accrue from analyses of coping and emotion 
regulation strategies that have been aggregated into factors, a limitation of studying these 
processes at the factor level is the lack of information about specific strategies that may be 
carrying the effects and the relative use of different strategies that are included within these 
factors. An important step for future research is to unpack these factors to examine the 
associations of more comprehensive measures that include larger samples of items reflecting 
the specific coping and emotion regulation strategies that comprise them. That is, 
improvement is needed in the quality of measures of specific strategies that can be used in 
various combinations to understand which of a given set of strategies may have the strongest 
effects. For example, the RSQ (Connor-Smith et al., 2000) includes only three items to 
assess each of four strategies that make up secondary control coping (acceptance, cognitive 
reappraisal, positive thinking, distraction). Analyses of parcels that include a larger number 
of items for each strategy could yield more information about how the strategies that

these patterns are related to psychopathology. As discussed below, this will also require 
research designs that are more sensitive to processes of coping and emotion regulation as 
they unfold during specific events or periods of time.

Moderator analyses of cross-sectional studies.—We examined three possible 
moderators of the cross-sectional associations between coping and emotion regulation and 
symptoms of psychopathology: age, measure quality, and informant. First, analyses of age as 
moderator yielded a significant effect size for the association of engagement/approach 
coping with internalizing symptoms, with a small but significant negative effect size for 
adolescents and a non-significant effect for children. There was also an effect for age as a 
moderator of cognitive reappraisal and internalizing symptoms with a small negative 
association for adolescents and a small positive association for children. Finally, age was 
moderator of the association of emotional suppression and internalizing symptoms; there 
was a significant positive association for adolescents while the association for children was 
non-significant. Although these findings do not support a clear developmental pattern for the 
association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms, results are similar to those 
reported in previous reviews. Aldao et al. (2010) evaluated the role of age group (children 
and adolescents vs. adults) and found a significant moderating effect for age on the 
association of problem solving and suppression with symptoms of psychopathology such 
that the association was stronger for adults than children and adolescents. Similarly, Cheng 
et al. (2014) compared effect sizes for participants under age 30 (including a small number 
of studies with adolescents) and over age 30 and reported a significantly larger effect size for 
the association of coping flexibility and measures of psychological adjustment for older than 
younger participants. However, it is important to note that given relatively small numbers of 
studies in each category for some analyses, there may not have been sufficient power to 
detect age as a moderator in the current meta-analysis.

Consistent with developmental models of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., Zimmer-
Gembeck & Skinner, 2016), the few significant age effects in the present met-analysis 
indicate a stronger association between coping and emotion regulation strategies with 
internalizing symptoms for adolescents as compared with children. However, the majority of 
the tests of age as a moderator of effect sizes were non-significant. While reviews of the 
development of coping and emotion regulation suggest more frequent use of cognitively 
demanding strategies, such as secondary control coping, in adolescents as compared to 
children (e.g., Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007; Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011, 
2016), it is still unknown whether the use of these strategies is more adaptive in adolescents 
as compared to children. Further, the current meta-analysis indicates few differences in 
associations among coping and emotion regulation and symptoms related to age. It is 
important to note, however, that the wide variation in samples made it difficult to conduct 
clear comparisons by age, as the mean age of the study sample was used to code the sample 
as child or adolescent. For example, a study with an age range of 8–18 years may be coded 
as an “adolescent” sample if the mean age was above 11, as would a study with an age range 
of 15–17. These necessary approximations of age may have obscured findings related to 
development. Notably, in a recent meta-analysis by Schäfer and colleagues (2017), age was

not a significant moderator of the association between emotion regulation and symptoms of 
depression and anxiety in adolescents. We return to the importance of understanding 
developmental differences in coping and emotion regulation in the agenda for future 
research presented below.

There was no evidence that the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms 
was affected by measure quality. The absence of significant effects for measure quality 
suggests that the findings are not compromised by the psychometric quality of the measures 
of coping and emotion regulation that were included in this review. This may be a 
consequence of our requirement that authors reported at least some reliability data or that 
reliability data be reported for the measure elsewhere in the literature, and that each scale 
have more than two items to be included in the current review. In addition, as noted above, 
we may have also had low power to detect measure quality as a moderator.

Finally, no significant moderator effects were identified for studies that used a single 
informant to assess coping and emotion with symptoms as compared with studies that 
examined effects using different informants for each construct (e.g., children and their 
parents). This provides some evidence that the association of coping and emotion regulation 
with symptoms is not simply an artifact of shared method variance that can be the 
consequence of obtaining self-reports of both of these constructs (Compas et al., 2014b). 
However, these findings should be viewed with caution as we identified relatively fewer 
studies that used multi-informant reports compared to those that used single-informant 
designs, resulting in relatively low statistical power. Further, multi-informant analyses 
provide the most stringent test of the association of coping and emotion regulation with 
symptoms of psychopathology and continue to be the method of choice (see below).

Longitudinal studies.—The evidence for the association of coping and emotion 
regulation with internalizing and externalizing symptoms was not supported in longitudinal 
studies. Specifically, only disengagement coping, social support coping, and avoidance were 
significantly positively associated with internalizing symptoms in longitudinal analyses 
(effect sizes ranged from r = .12 to .18). Thus, there is substantially less evidence for the 
association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology in 
longitudinal as compared with cross-sectional studies. Several factors may have contributed 
to these diminished effect sizes. First, there were only 17 studies with longitudinal data that 
could be included in the meta-analysis, yielding a smaller body of evidence to evaluate these 
associations. Second, it is possible that the only longitudinal associations between coping 
and emotion regulation and symptoms are for those factors or strategies that are related to 
higher levels of symptoms over time. In contrast, factors that are associated with lower levels 
of symptoms (e.g., primary control coping and secondary control coping) may only be 
correlates of symptoms when measured at the same point in time, as evidenced by the 
consistent cross-sectional findings in the current meta-analysis for these factors, and may not 
be associated with symptoms longitudinally. We consider the implications of these findings 
in greater detail below.

Comparison with Previous Reviews

The pattern and magnitude of the findings in the current meta-analysis can be evaluated in 
part through comparison with previous meta-analyses of the association of coping and 
emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology. First, previous meta-analyses 
examining coping and emotion regulation and symptoms in children and adolescents found 
only small effects for these associations (Aldridge & Roesch, 2007; Clarke, 2006). The 
effect sizes reported in the current meta-analysis provide substantially stronger support for 
the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology than 
either of these two previous meta-analyses focused on research with children and 
adolescents. Further, compared with these previous meta-analyses with children and 
adolescents, the current study found much clearer and stronger evidence for associations 
between coping and emotion regulation factors (i.e., primary control coping and secondary 
control coping) and lower levels of symptoms (i.e., effect sizes that are reflected in negative 
correlations).

Several other meta-analyses have included only a small portion of studies with children or 
adolescents along with a much larger number of studies with adults. For example, a recent 
meta-analysis examined the association of coping flexibility in adults with psychological 
adjustment, and found that coping flexibility was positively associated with better 
adjustment (overall effect size r = .23) and the overall association between coping flexibility 
and psychological adjustment was moderated by individualism, SES, and age (Cheng, Lau, 
& Chen, 2014). In addition, Rueger et al. (2016) found a significant positive association 
between social support coping and depressive symptoms (overall effect size r = .26). Aldao 
et al. (2010) reported a meta-analysis of associations between emotion regulation strategies 
and symptoms of psychopathology in studies with primarily adult samples. Significant 
medium positive effect sizes were found for avoidance, rumination, and suppression and 
significant negative effect sizes were found for reappraisal and problem solving with 
symptoms of psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and substance 
use). Similarly, Schäfer et al. (2017) reported significant medium negative effect sizes for 
cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance, and significant positive effect sizes 
for avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with symptoms of anxiety and depression in 
adolescence. The results of the current meta-analysis found associations of similar 
magnitude as these previous meta-analyses, while extending these findings specifically to 
children and adolescents and including studies of both coping and emotion regulation. Thus, 
the findings of the current study are in line with and expand on those of previous meta-
analyses of coping and emotion regulation.

Limitations of Previous Research

In spite of the significance of these findings, research on coping and emotion regulation in 
children and adolescents is constrained by two fundamental limitations. First, there is a 
continued overreliance on the use of questionnaires to assess these processes. Although 
questionnaires can provide important information on the ways that children and adolescents 
cope with stress and regulate their emotions in their daily lives, the limitations of 
questionnaires to assess coping and emotion regulation are well documented. Some 
limitations of questionnaire measures of coping and emotion regulation include reliance on

retrospective reports and concerns about accuracy of recall (particularly with children and 
adolescents), confounding of items with their outcomes, and variations in the recall period 
across different measures (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2004). As outlined in greater detail 
below, rather than simply recommending against the use of questionnaires to assess coping 
and emotion regulation, we believe questionnaires must be augmented by other methods that 
can provide more objective evidence for the strategies children and adolescents use to cope 
with stress and regulate their emotions. Second, the majority of studies included in the 
current meta-analysis were cross-sectional and single informant. The direction of the 
associations of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms cannot be determined when 
both are measured at a single, contemporaneous time point. Although this design remains 
useful as an initial step in addressing new or novel research questions, it cannot be the focus 
for advances in this area of research. Further, by relying on a single source of information 
for both coping and emotion regulation and symptoms, this level of evidence may be 
confounded by shared method variance. Notably, it is encouraging that the moderator 
analyses of informant effects were not significant, suggesting that the findings were not 
limited to the use of single informants. However, in some cases there were small numbers of 
studies contributing to the moderator analyses, and therefore these analyses may have been 
limited by low statistical power. Despite this limitation, it is important that the field uses the 
most rigorous designs possible to test the association of coping and emotion regulation with 
symptoms of psychopathology.

An Agenda for Future Research

The clearest conclusion that can be drawn from this meta-analysis is that questionnaire 
measures of coping and emotion regulation are associated with questionnaire measures of 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. Although these 
findings provide an important foundation for this field, the aim of future research on these 
constructs cannot be limited to showing these simple associations using a limited set of 
methods. We now outline an agenda for next steps in research on coping, emotion regulation 
and psychopathology in children and adolescents. We draw extensively on reviews of 
constructs that are closely related to coping and emotion regulation, including effortful 
control, executive function, and cognitive factors in child and adolescent psychopathology 
(e.g., Hankin, Snyder, & Gulley, 2016; Zhou, Chen, & Main, 2012; Zimmer-Gembeck & 
Skinner, 2016).

Improve conceptualization.—Research on coping and emotion regulation in children 
and adolescents is at a crossroads. To varying degrees, both of these constructs involve 
adaptive processes to regulate emotion, cognition, behavior, and physiology (Compas et al., 
2014a; Skinner et al., 2003; Thompson, 1994; Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2016). 
However, as clearly illustrated by the studies included in the current meta-analysis, research 
on coping and emotion regulation continues to be reflected in separate literatures without a 
shared conceptual framework and little to no integration of findings from research across 
constructs. Based on the findings presented here, we propose that many of the distinctions 
between these two constructs are artificial and synthesis of these two lines of theory and 
research is long overdue. The following steps are suggested to increase the coordination and 
integration of future research.

First, the processes of coping and emotion regulation are concerned with the same set of 
strategies of adaptation. Specifically, all of the strategies identified in the current meta-
analysis have appeared in studies of both emotion regulation and coping. The distinction 
between these constructs and the factors and strategies they encompass has led to an 
underestimation of our knowledge base of these processes. Reviews have summarized 
findings from studies of coping to the exclusion of studies of emotion regulation (e.g., 
Aldridge & Roesch, 2007) and similarly, reviews of evidence on emotion regulation have 
overlooked much of the research on coping (e.g., Schäfer et al., 2017). An example from 
recent research is illustrative. Christensen, Aldao, Sheridan, and McLaughlin (2017) 
presented important findings on the differential effects of emotion regulation strategies in 
response to controllable versus uncontrollable stressors. However, the findings regarding 
emotion regulation and controllable and uncontrollable stressors will be better understood 
when considered in light of a rich history of similar research on coping with stressors. For 
example, several studies have found an interaction of type of coping by controllability of a 
stressor in predicting levels of internalizing symptoms (e.g., Compas et al., 2012; Forsythe 
& Compas, 1987; Folkman, Chesney, Pollack, & Coates, 1993; Osowiecki & Compas, 1998, 
1999). The current review is a first step in bringing these lines of research together for a 
comprehensive analysis.

Second, coping research will be informed by closer attention to specific emotions that arise 
in response to stress. Likewise, emotion regulation research will be informed by closer 
attention to the sources of stress and events that give rise to specific emotions. It can be 
argued that all efforts to cope with stress are motivated by the goal of reducing negative 
emotions and enhancing positive emotions in response stressful events and circumstances. 
However, coping efforts may be aimed at other goals in addition to the regulation of emotion 
such as altruistic efforts to help another or more instrumental goals related to personal 
achievement (e.g., Gross, 1999; Scheier, Weinbtraub, & Carver, 1986). A primary division 
between coping and emotion regulation centers on the precipitants of regulatory efforts. As 
discussed above, coping is conceptualized as a response to stressful events or stressful 
conditions in the environment, whereas emotion regulation is directed toward emotions that 
may occur in reaction to both stressful and normative, non-stressful experiences (e.g., Gross 
& Jazaieri, 2014). Conversely, many emotions arise in response to stressful events and 
chronic sources of adversity and one important function of coping responses is the 
regulation of emotions that arise in these circumstances.

Third, coping and emotion regulation include cognitive and behavioral processes that are 
organized and goal directed. However, the field has been lacking a framework that 
encompasses both of these constructs. Synthesis of research and theory will benefit from 
tests of competing or complementary models that include both of these processes. We 
propose that at least three models could be tested: (a) coping and emotion regulation are 
organized around specific emotions, (b) coping and emotion regulation are organized as 
temporal processes, and (c) coping and emotion regulation are organized around the degree 
actual or perceived control of precipitating events or circumstances.

Studies of coping and emotion regulation frequently examine these processes in relation to 
overall negative emotion that is typically measured at the aggregate level. However, it is

possible that coping and emotion regulation strategies are differentiated in response to 
specific negative emotions, such as sadness, anger, or anxiety. This is reflected in the work 
of Zeman and colleagues (Zeman et al., 2001, 2002, 2010) who have developed measures of 
emotion regulation for use in response to specific negative emotions. Different strategies 
may be enacted in response to different emotions and strategies or sets of strategies may 
differ in their effectiveness in managing specific emotions. For example, fear and anger have 
different effects on attentional processes, have both shared and distinct environmental and 
genetic correlates, and maybe related to different processes of self-regulation (Clifford et al., 
2015; Engen et al., 2017; Kim-Spoon et al., 2015). Coping and emotion regulation factors 
such as primary and secondary control coping or strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and 
distraction may have different effects on these two emotions. Testing emotion-specific 
models will require careful measurement of both discrete emotions and the use of sets of 
strategies as measured at the level of factors in response to these emotions.

The importance of process is seen most clearly in the process model of emotion regulation 
of Gross and colleagues (e.g., Gross, 2015; Sheppes, Suri, & Gross, 2015). As described 
above, in this model, emotion regulation strategies are grouped into five broad categories 
that act on specific stages of the emotion generative cycle as an emotion is experienced: 
situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and 
response modulation (Gross, 1998). The process model posits that these skills are deployed 
sequentially with different strategies potentially being more appropriate or adaptive prior to, 
during, or after the experience of an emotion. Current conceptualizations of coping in 
children and adolescents can be expanded by considering ways in which the process of 
coping may unfold over the course of a stressful event or prolonged exposure to chronic 
stress. For example, a diagnosis of cancer or diabetes may present children and adolescents 
with different stressors over the course of the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term adaptation, 
and these stressors may require different coping and emotion regulation responses (e.g., 
Compas et al., 2012, 2014b; Jaser, Patel, Xu, Tamborlane, & Grey, 2016). As noted below, 
this will require the use of short and long-term prospective studies in which coping and 
emotion regulation and symptoms of psychopathology are assessed at carefully selected 
times over the course of a stressor. Little empirical research has tested process models in 
children and adolescents, either under the rubric of coping or emotion regulation, and thus 
more research is needed to test this proposed structure of these processes.

Levels of actual and perceived control over stressors play a central role in several 
conceptualizations of coping across the lifespan (e.g., Allen et al., 2016; Landau, Kay, & 
Whitson, 2105; Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2010; Troy, Ford, McRae, Zarolia, & Mauss, 
2016; Troy, Shallcross, & Mauss, 2013). Further, current conceptualization of learned 
helplessness and psychopathology emphasize the importance of both controllable and 
uncontrollable stress in the development of adaptive and maladaptive responses to stress 
(Maier & Seligman, 2016). As described above, a control-based model of coping in 
childhood and adolescence (Compas et al., 2001, 2012, 2014a; Weisz et al., 1994) has 
received considerable empirical support from studies using the RSQ and is robust across 
cultures and nationalities and types of stressors (Connor-Smith et al., 2000). Support for this 
model has come from studies using CFA with Euro-American adolescents (Compas et al., 
2006b; Connor-Smith et al., 2000), Native American (Navajo) adolescents (Wadsworth et

al., 2004), and adolescents in Spain (Connor-Smith & Calvete, 2004), Bosnia (Benson et al., 
2011), and China (Xiao et al., 2010). This model has also been supported in CFAs using the 
RSQ in response to a wide range of stressors including war-related trauma (Benson et al., 
2011), chronic pain (Compas et al., 2006b), and peer stress (Connor-Smith et al., 2000; 
Connor-Smith & Calvete, 2004; Xiao et al., 2010). However, support for a control-based 
model of coping and emotion regulation also has several limitations. The most significant 
concern is that empirical evidence has not been provided that the coping responses on the 
RSQ are purposefully organized around the perceived or actual controllability of stressors, 
as the three-factor model implies. Thus, future research will benefit from more direct tests of 
controllability of the stressors with which children and adolescents are faced.

The potential importance of both the process model of emotion regulation and the control-
based model of coping can be found in their shared emphasis on adapting responses to the 
demands of specific situations. That is, these models both posit that the effectiveness of 
types of coping and emotion regulation may depend on the context in which they are used. 
For example, the goodness-of-fit hypothesis suggests that the effectiveness of some coping 
strategies depends on the controllability of the stressor (e.g., Forsythe & Compas, 1987; 
Gidron, 2013; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Similarly, flexibility in the use of different 
emotion regulation strategies is related to greater regulation efficacy (e.g., Aldao & Nolen-
Hoeksema, 2012, 2013; Aldao, Sheppes, & Gross, 2015; Christensen et al., 2017). We return 
to the broader importance of context in more detail below.

In summary, there are still issues to be resolved in defining and conceptualizing coping and 
emotion regulation. We propose that in instances where the context or precipitant for the 
process being studied is specific to the emotions that arise in the fabric of daily life (i.e., 
contexts and events that are not sources of stress), the process represents emotion regulation 
specifically. However, once a precipitating situation or context is identified as stressful, the 
process of adaptation lies broadly in the domain of coping. At this point, however, there is 
not enough evidence to distinguish coping and emotion regulation along the lines of 
presence or absence of a stressor. Until these distinctions are clarified empirically, we 
encourage the field to use the terms coping and emotion regulation together in order to be 
inclusive and representative of the state of the field and to lead to greater integration and 
synthesis of research findings. As an example of the importance of including these two 
concepts together, if we had used only coping or emotion regulation as search terms we 
would have identified very different sets of studies and drawn very different conclusions. 
Therefore, an approach that includes both of these concepts will provide a more complete 
picture of research on these adaptive processes.

Prioritize development.—Understanding the development of skills to regulate emotions 
and cope with stress across childhood and adolescence is central to understanding sources of 
risk and resilience and for the development of interventions to enhance these skills. Current 
knowledge about how coping and emotion regulation may change in their association with 
psychopathology with age is disappointing at best, as we found relatively little evidence in 
the current meta-analysis that the association of coping and emotion regulation with 
symptoms is different in childhood compared to adolescence. Guidance for future research 
can come from descriptive research on the development of coping and emotion regulation

skills from early childhood through adolescence and into adulthood (Skinner & Zimmer-
Gembeck, 2007, 2010; Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011, 2016). Further, a roadmap for 
the development of coping and emotion regulation can be drawn from models of closely 
related constructs, including effortful control, executive function, and other related cognitive 
processes that develop across childhood and adolescence (Hankin et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 
2012).

What is not known is whether the use of these strategies is more adaptive in adolescence as 
compared to childhood, or how the use of these skills changes across development. In some 
cases, the use of a strategy that is adaptive for one age group in response to a specific source 
of stress may either have no effect or be maladaptive for another age group faced with the 
same stressor. For example, seeking social support may be an adaptive strategy for a child to 
regulate feelings of sadness, but it may be maladaptive for adolescents if social support does 
not involve coping of controlled regulation of emotion and instead takes the form of co-
rumination (e.g., Stone, Hankin, Gibb, & Abela, 2011).

Further, risk for psychopathology differs for boys and girls as they reach adolescence (e.g., 
Angold, 2008; Zahn-Waxler, Shirtcliff, & Marceau, 2008). Therefore, the associations of 
coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology may differ by gender 
depending on the developmental stage at which these constructs are measured (e.g., Carlson 
& Grant, 2008; Sontag & Graber, 2010). This suggests that future research needs to examine 
carefully selected periods of development during which changes may occur both in the 
emergence of emotion regulation and coping skills and internalizing and externalizing 
symptoms. For example, it may be most important to study coping and emotion regulation as 
a source of risk and resilience for depressive symptoms during early and middle 
adolescence, as the rate of depressive symptoms and the onset of depressive disorders 
increases significantly during middle adolescence (e.g., Hankin et al., 1998).

We propose that the developmental course of coping and emotion regulation (a) is 
cumulative such that new skills are developed over time to build a broader skill set rather 
than replacing earlier ones as youth move into adolescence and young adulthood; (b) moves 
from a reliance on automatic processes in early childhood to both automatic and controlled 
processes in childhood and adolescence; (c) progresses from dependence primarily on 
caregivers to co-regulate or guide in regulation towards greater autonomy in the 
implementation of these processes; (d) becomes more differentiated moving into 
adolescence; and (e) involves increasingly more complex cognitive skills, which coincides 
with the development of language and executive function skills. For example, we 
hypothesize that coping and emotion regulation skills are used in largely undifferentiated 
ways in early childhood and will be best captured by the broad distinction of engagement/
approach strategies vs. disengagement strategies. During late childhood and adolescence we 
propose that the use of engagement strategies become more differentiated based on 
increasing abilities to recognize varying degrees of control in stressful events and 
circumstances.

As a consequence of the development of the ability to perceive control, coping and emotion 
regulation attempts can be further differentiated into primary control and secondary control

efforts (see also Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2010). This pattern of greater differentiation 
would reflect heterotypic continuity of coping and emotion regulation across childhood and 
adolescence (see Hankin et al., 2016). In contrast, an example of the homotypic continuity in 
the structure of coping and emotion regulation in adolescence and adulthood can be found in 
tests of the factor structure of a control-based model of coping. The three-factor structure of 
primary control coping, secondary control coping, and disengagement coping has been 
confirmed using CFA in diverse samples of adolescents (e.g., Benson et al., 2011; Xiao et 
al., 2010) and adults (e.g., Compas et al., 2006ab). However, this model has not been tested 
in younger children to determine if these factors are less differentiated earlier in 
development.

Despite a number of remaining questions regarding the developmental course of processes 
of coping and emotion regulation, the skilled use of these processes emerges over the course 
of childhood and adolescence. Therefore coping and emotion regulation may act as a source 
of risk or resilience at later points in development (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007; 
Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2016). Interventions to enhance those coping and emotion 
regulation skills that promote resilience could be guided by more specific information about 
the likely points in development (i.e., sensitive periods) when children and adolescents will 
be responsive to learning and applying various skills and strategies.

Improve measurement and research design.—Since the previous broad reviews of 
measures of coping and emotion regulation in childhood and adolescence (Adrian et al., 
2011; Compas et al., 2001), there has been progress in the availability of measures with 
established reliability and validity. We identified 16 measures of coping and emotion 
regulation that were used in over half of the studies reported in the meta-analysis (see Table 
2). All of these measures have adequate reliability. Fourteen of these measures have at least 
some form of validity data, with five providing data on convergent and discriminant validity, 
and seven have reported findings from CFA to test the hypothesized structure of coping and 
emotion regulation. It is promising that research has progressed by more frequently using 
measures with acceptable psychometric properties. Further, because many researchers are 
interested in the ways that children and adolescents cope with stress and regulate their 
emotions in their daily lives, questionnaires and especially self-reports, will remain a central 
tool to study these processes.

The use of multiple informants to assess coping, emotion regulation and symptoms is 
important to improve the methodological rigor of the field. For example, the RSQ (Connor-
Smith et al., 2000) is one of the few measures of coping with both self- and parent-report 
versions available. Obtaining reports on coping and emotion regulation using different 
methods than those used to assess symptoms of psychopathology provides stronger evidence 
for these associations that is not limited by problems of shared method variance that is 
inherent in single-informant methods (e.g., Compas et al., 2014b). Multi-informant methods 
need to become a standard for the field.

However, these measures need to be used in concert with other methodologies to improve 
external validity and generalizability. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of coping 
and emotion regulation offers an important method to understand these processes in real

world contexts and closer to real time. For example, Allen et al. (2016) used EMA with a 
sample of children and adolescents (9–14 years old) during which they reported on 
perceived control, emotional reactivity (anxiety and physiological arousal), and emotion 
regulation strategy use in response to daily negative life events. Children’s perceptions of 
control over negative life events were related to less anxious reactivity and greater use of 
both problem solving and cognitive restructuring as reported in EMA. Tan et al. (2012) 
utilized an EMA approach to compare real-world emotional experiences of youth (9–13 
years old) with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or social phobia and 
age-matched healthy controls. Anxious youth reported more frequent physiological reactions 
in response to a negative event, and reports of avoidance, distraction and problem solving 
using EMA were associated with the down-regulation of negative emotions for both anxious 
and control youth. Further, Price et al. (2016) used EMA to assess avoidance, suppression 
and distraction during negative life events and linked these findings to functional 
neuroimaging data in a sample of adolescents. In this study, vigilance toward threat was 
positively associated with EMA distraction and suppression. These findings suggest the 
potential importance of using EMA methods along with child or adolescent and parent 
reports of children’s coping and emotion regulation to provide a more comprehensive 
picture of these processes.

Experimental designs and methods are also needed in which coping and emotion regulation 
are directly manipulated and causal effects on proxy measures of symptoms can be assessed 
under controlled conditions. Examples of this approach can be found in the rich tradition of 
experimental studies of emotion regulation in adults and children (e.g., Eisenberg, Smith, & 
Spinrad, 2011; Fox, Kirwan, & Reeb-Sutherland, 2012; Gross & Jazaieri, 2014; Penela, 
Walker, Degnan, Fox, & Henderson, 2015). Studies with children and adolescents have 
employed experimental designs to elicit negative emotions in the laboratory setting and 
observe automatic processes that reflect aspects of reactivity and arousal, while instructing 
participants to use a specific emotion regulation strategy (or strategies) to regulate the 
experience of the emotion in real time (e.g., Morris et al., 2011; Santucci et al., 2008). 
Experimental studies are not without their own limitations (e.g., only analogues of stress can 
be generated in the laboratory; observational methods cannot access covert cognitive forms 
of coping and emotion regulation) but it will be important to complement correlational 
designs with evidence obtained under controlled, experimental conditions.

In addition, relatively little attention has been given to sample characteristics with regard to 
important sources of diversity (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) or to comparisons 
of clinical as compared with non-clinical samples. It is possible that these processes differ in 
their associations with symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents faced with 
greater cumulative sociodemographic risk and subsequently greater levels of stress 
(Wadsworth, 2015). Further, it is possible that strategies typically considered a source of risk 
(e.g., avoidance), may be more strongly associated with psychopathology in a clinical 
sample, whereas those strategies may be unrelated to psychopathology in a non-clinical 
sample. More careful selection of samples that differ in ways that may have bearing on the 
association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of psychopathology is an 
important direction for future research.

Lastly, longitudinal designs are needed to test the directions of the relations of coping and 
emotion regulation with symptoms. Similar to multi-informant methods, longitudinal studies 
have been used with increasing frequency in recent research, but this design, although more 
costly and time consuming for researchers, needs to be prioritized. Longitudinal designs 
offer the opportunity to examine the direction of the association between coping and 
emotion regulation and symptoms of psychopathology. The degree to which coping and 
emotion regulation can predict changes or residual variance in levels of symptoms across 
time can provide better evidence about the direction of the relationship of these constructs 
with psychopathology. However, it is also possible that initial levels of internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms predict later coping and emotion regulation, in part because high 
levels of symptoms may impede the development of or the ability to effectively use these 
skills. Longitudinal designs can be used to test whether coping, emotion regulation, and 
symptoms of psychopathology are correlated because of the shared effect of a third variable. 
Finally, longitudinal designs are essential to test the developmental course of coping and 
emotion regulation to determine if these constructs are stable in their form across childhood 
and adolescence (homotypic continuity) or change in form with development (heterotypic 
continuity) (see Hankin et al., 2016). For example, the hypothesis presented above that 
coping becomes more differentiated with development would reflect heterotypic continuity 
and requires longitudinal studies that span childhood and the transition to adolescence to test 
this possibility.

Further, greater attention is needed to matching research designs to the specific questions 
and models being tested. For example, studies of an acute stressful event (e.g., the diagnosis 
of a serious illness) require assessments spaced over short periods of time, as the 
associations between coping and emotion regulation and symptoms may be strongest closest 
to and/or during the experience of that specific event (e.g., Compas et al., 2014b). In 
addition, an acute stressful event may also require long-term follow-up to assess the residual 
effects of this event and the ways in which youth coped with and regulated emotions in 
response to it (e.g., Compas et al., 2017). On the other hand, studies of chronic stressful 
conditions and adversity (e.g., economic disadvantage) need to examine processes of coping 
and emotion regulation over longer time frames during which the stressor is experienced.

Identify cognitive and neurobiological substrates of coping and emotion 
regulation.—Research in psychopathology has been reshaped by an emphasis on 
underlying processes as reflected in the RDoC from the National Institute of Mental Health 
(Casey et al., 2014; Insel & Cuthbert, 2015). A similar approach is needed to provide a 
better understanding of the processes that reflect the neurobiological foundations and 
substrates of coping and emotion regulation (see Etkin, Buchel, & Gross, 2015; Fernandez, 
Jazaieri, & Gross, 2016). One important avenue for future research involves the examination 
of neurocognitive correlates of coping and emotion regulation. Several aspects of executive 
function (e.g., working memory, attentional control) may provide a foundation for the use of 
coping and emotion regulation, as these processes often require the use of complex cognitive 
skills (Campbell et al., 2009; Eisenberg & Zhou, 2016; McRae et al., 2010).

Researchers have begun to identify neurobiological substrates of these processes using 
neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging in order to identify

patterns of activation in specific brain regions in children and adolescents that are associated 
with coping and emotion regulation skills. The most frequent target of these studies has been 
the use of cognitive reappraisal as a coping and emotion regulation strategy. A consistent 
pattern of findings has emerged, suggesting that increased activation during reappraisal of 
emotional stimuli occurs in several areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the 
ventromedial, ventrolateral, and dorsolateral PFC (e.g., Belden et al., 2014, 2015; Dougherty 
et al., 2015; McRae et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2015; Stephanou et al., 2015). The 
associations between executive function and coping and emotion regulation can also be 
examined using neuroimaging methods. For example, Robinson et al. (2015) found 
significant correlations between activation of prefrontal brain regions in response to a 
standard working memory (n-back) task and parent and child reports of children’s use of 
secondary control coping strategies in a sample of pediatric brain tumor patients and healthy 
controls. Similarly, Reising et al (2017, in press) found that activation in the DLPFC, dACC, 
and APFC was significantly related to adolescents’ reports of their use of secondary control 
coping and accounted for adverse effects of stress exposure on adolescents’ coping. 
Neuroimaging methods can shed light on the associations between rapid automatic processes 
as contrasted with controlled processes of coping and emotion regulation by examining 
responses of both emotion (e.g., the amygdala) and executive function regions (e.g., areas of 
the PFC) of the brain (e.g., Belden et al., 2014, 2015).

Further, coping and emotion regulation may play an important role in explicating individual 
differences in genetic sources of risk and resilience (e.g., Ford, Mauss, Troy, Smolen, & 
Hankin, 2014). Individual differences in coping and emotion regulation may be associated 
with specific patterns of polymorphisms of genes that are related to stress sensitivity 
including the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and corticotropin-releasing 
hormone receptors (CRHR) (Hankin, Badanes, Smolen, & Young, 2015). Examining 
correlates of coping and emotion regulation at multiple levels of analyses will provide a 
much richer understanding of factors that contribute to the development of these skills.

Examine context.—Research on the neurobiological substrates of coping and emotion 
regulation needs to be balanced by careful attention to the context in which children and 
adolescents are engaged in the processes of coping and emotion regulation. First, emotion 
regulation will be better understood by examining this process in the context in which 
emotions arise. For example, a child or adolescent who experiences sadness in the context of 
a peer rejection (e.g., not being included in a party with classmates) may be faced with a 
very different challenge than one who experiences sadness in the context of chronic stress 
associated with living with a depressed parent. Current questionnaire measures of emotion 
regulation often do not assess the context in which emotions occur and as a consequence 
possible differences in emotions as a function of the context in which they arise. Second, as 
noted above, it will be important to examine flexibility in coping with different types of 
stress including levels of objective and perceived control as important aspects of context 
(Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2010). Third, it will be important to give greater attention to 
the broader social context in which coping and emotion regulation occur, especially poverty 
and economic hardship. For example, the work of Wadsworth and colleagues has shown that 
the types of coping that may be adaptive for children and adolescents exposed to chronic

economic hardship may differ from youth who live in more economically advantaged 
environments (e.g., Wadsworth, 2015; Wadsworth & Compas, 2002; Wadsworth, Rindlaub, 
Hurwich-Reiss, Rienks, Bianco, & Markman, 2013).

Intervention research.—Studies of the effects of interventions that target coping and 
emotion regulation skills represent an important next step for research in this field for 
several reasons. First, intervention studies using randomized designs can provide true 
experimental tests of the associations of coping and emotion regulation with 
psychopathology in real-world contexts. Second, intervention trials, especially preventive 
interventions, can provide information on the role of coping and emotion regulation in the 
etiology of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. And most importantly, intervention 
research can clarify the role that coping and emotion regulation can play in alleviating and 
preventing psychopathology in young people. There is promising evidence that interventions 
can lead to changes in specific types of coping and that these changes account for the effects 
of these interventions on changes in symptoms (e.g., Compas et al., 2010; Tein et al., 2004, 
2006). For example, in a randomized trial testing a preventive intervention for children of 
parents with a history of depression, Compas et al. (2010) found that changes in children’s 
use of secondary control coping skills as reported by children and their parents after 
completion of the intervention (6 months after baseline) partially accounted for (i.e., 
mediated) the effects of the intervention on child and parent reports of children’s 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 12-months. Continued research in this area is a 
high priority to establish the importance of coping and emotion regulation in treating and 
preventing psychopathology.

Summary and Conclusions

This review provides another important step in the integration of research on coping and 
emotion regulation in children and adolescents by considering the shared features of these 
two concepts and providing a synthesis of empirical research on their associations with 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology. The findings from the meta-
analysis provide the first clear benchmark of empirical research for the field and a base of 
evidence for the association of coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of 
internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in children and adolescents. The findings 
from the current review also highlight significant limitations in the field, including 
stagnation in conceptualization and methods. To move the field forward we have outlined an 
ambitious and challenging agenda for next step in this research.

Public significance:

This meta-analysis reveals small to medium associations between the ways that children 
and adolescents cope with stress and regulate their emotions with symptoms of 
psychopathology. The findings have important implications for understanding the ways 
that some children and adolescents may be resilient to stress in their lives.
