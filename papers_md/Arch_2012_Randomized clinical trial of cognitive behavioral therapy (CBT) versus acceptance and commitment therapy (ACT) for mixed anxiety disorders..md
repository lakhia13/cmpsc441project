Abstract

Objective—Randomized comparisons of acceptance-based treatments with traditional cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders are lacking. To address this research gap, we 
compared acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to CBT for heterogeneous anxiety 
disorders.

Method—One hundred twenty eight individuals (52% female, mean age = 38, 33% minority) 
with one or more DSM-IV anxiety disorders began treatment following randomization to 12 
sessions of CBT or ACT; both treatments included behavioral exposure. Assessments at pre-
treatment, post-treatment, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up measured anxiety specific (principal 
disorder Clinical Severity Ratings [CSR], Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Penn State Worry 
Questionnaire, Fear Questionnaire avoidance) and non-anxiety specific (Quality of Life Index 
[QOLI], Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-16 [AAQ]) outcomes. Treatment adherence and 
therapist competency ratings, treatment credibility, and co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders 
were investigated.

Results—CBT and ACT improved similarly across all outcomes from pre- to post-treatment. 
During follow-up, ACT showed steeper CSR improvements than CBT (p < .05, d = 1.33) and at 
12-month follow-up, ACT showed lower CSRs than CBT among completers (p < .05, d = 1.05). 
At 12-month follow-up, ACT reported higher AAQ than CBT (p = .08, d = .42; Completers: p < .
05, d = .59) whereas CBT reported higher QOLI than ACT (p < .05, d = .43). Attrition and

comorbidity improvements were similar, although ACT utilized more non-study psychotherapy at 
6-month follow-up. Therapist adherence and competency were good; treatment credibility was 
higher in CBT.

Conclusions—Overall improvement was similar between ACT and CBT, indicating that ACT is 
a highly viable treatment for anxiety disorders.

INTRODUCTION

Several decades ago, the development of behavioral and cognitive behavioral therapy for 
anxiety disorders (Barlow & Cerny, 1988; Beck, Emery, & Greenberg, 1985) introduced 
time-limited, relatively effective treatments. Numerous randomized clinical trials and meta-
analyses (e.g. Butler, Chapman, Forman, & Beck, 2006; Hofmann & Smits, 2008; Norton & 
Price, 2007; Tolin, 2010) have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders, 
including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive 
compulsive disorder, specific phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder, relative to wait-list 
and/or psychological control conditions. As a result of clinical efficacy and ease of 
implementation, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has become the dominant empirically 
validated treatment for anxiety disorders. However, a significant percentage of individuals 
with anxiety disorders do not respond to CBT (e.g., Barlow, Gorman, Shear, & Woods, 
2000), relapse following successful treatment (Brown & Barlow, 1995), seek additional 
treatment (Brown & Barlow, 1995), or remain vulnerable to developing anxiety and mood 
disorders throughout the lifespan (see Craske, 2003). Further, the cognitive model, which 
posits that anxiety disorders stem from faulty cognitions and are treated by modifying the 
content of these cognitions, has been challenged by insufficient supporting evidence (see 
Longmore & Worrell, 2007) and theoretical arguments (see Brewin, 1996)

In attempt to broaden, improve upon, and provide theoretically strong alternatives to 
traditional (cognitive model-based) CBT, clinical researchers have shown increasing interest 
in mindfulness and acceptance-based treatments for psychopathology. Multiple treatment 
approaches have developed out of this exploration, including Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999), a behavioral therapy that cultivates 
mindfulness, acceptance, cognitive defusion (flexible distancing from the literal meaning of 
cognitions), and other strategies to increase psychological flexibility and promote behavior 
change consistent with personal values. Within ACT, psychological flexibility is defined as 
enhancing the capacity to make contact with experience in the present moment, and based 
on what is possible in that moment, persisting in or changing behavior in the pursuit of goals 
and values (Hayes et al., 1999). Case studies, multiple-baseline treatment studies and a 
single randomized clinical trial provide nascent evidence that ACT is an effective treatment 
for anxiety disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (Twohig et al., 2010), social 
anxiety disorder (Dalrymple & Herbert, 2007), panic disorder (Eifert et al., 2009), 
generalized anxiety disorder (Wetherell et al., 2011), and posttraumatic stress disorder 
(Orsillo & Batten, 2005). However, no randomized clinical trials for anxiety disorders have 
yet compared ACT with the gold standard therapy for anxiety disorders, CBT.

Several studies have compared ACT and CBT within general clinic samples. One 
randomized effectiveness trial (n=101) in undiagnosed anxious and depressed patients 
(Forman, Herbert, Moitra, Yeomans, & Geller, 2007) compared ACT and CBT1, concluding 
that the two treatments were equally effective across symptom outcome measures, but 
operated via somewhat different mechanisms. A small (n=28) randomized treatment study 
comparing ACT and CBT for undiagnosed “general clinic patients” (Lappalainen et al., 
2007) found that ACT reduced symptoms to a greater degree than CBT and effected 
treatment processes at a different rate. In neither study, however, were anxiety disorders 
formally diagnosed, significantly limiting the conclusions for the treatment of anxiety 
disorders. Roemer, Orsillo and colleagues (2008) developed an acceptance-based treatment 
for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) that integrated several ACT principles, and found it 
to be significantly superior to a waitlist control group for the treatment of generalized 
anxiety disorder. However, this promising treatment was developed for generalized anxiety 
disorder alone and it has not yet been compared to another active treatment.

In summary, important work has begun to investigate ACT for anxiety disorders but studies 
to date have not compared ACT to the most evidence-based psychotherapy for most anxiety 
disorders, CBT. Directly comparing traditional CBT and ACT for anxiety disorders within a 
randomized clinical trial bridges a vital gap in the empirical treatment literature, fulfilling 
the gold-standard method for investigating the relative efficacy of two treatments for anxiety 
disorders (Chambless & Hollon, 1998). Further, it provides an opportunity to compare the 
efficacy of treatment packages that contain distinct strategies for dealing with maladaptive 
cognitions (change the content of thoughts in CBT vs. change the context by challenging the 
need to respond rigidly and literally to cognitions in ACT) and uncomfortable internal 
experiences (to master and reduce anxiety in CBT vs. open towards and accept anxiety in 
ACT), and that promote different treatment goals (anxiety reduction in CBT vs. living a 
valued life in ACT).

The current study compares ACT and CBT in a mixed anxiety disorders sample for two 
reasons. First, ACT (Hayes et al., 1999) originally was developed for the treatment of 
psychopathology in general rather than a specific disorder in particular. The ACT protocol 
used in the current study (Eifert & Forsyth, 2005) was designed for application across all of 
the anxiety disorders, with the content of values-guided behavioral exercises tailored to 
specific anxiety disorders. Second, CBT shares common treatment elements across the 
anxiety disorders with variation in content specific to each disorder. We thus designed a 
CBT manual that addressed all anxiety disorders via branching mechanisms specific to each 
disorder. Our CBT protocol included the same basic treatment elements across all of the 
disorders (e.g., psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure – see Methods) but 
tailored the content of these elements to each specific disorder, an approach we have 
successfully tested in previous studies (e.g., Craske et al., 2011).

We assessed patients at four longitudinal measurement points, including pre-treatment, post-
treatment, 6-month follow up, and 12-month follow up, providing a thorough assessment of 

1The study called their approach “cognitive therapy” which they defined as the Beck-based treatment subtype of CBT, see Forman et 
al, 2007.

treatment-related change over time. Due to limited extant data, we did not make specific 
predictions regarding whether one treatment would lead to greater reductions in anxiety 
disorder-related symptoms than the other treatment. Rather, investigating this question 
represented a central study aim. However, given the emphasis in ACT on psychological 
flexibility and valued living, we hypothesized that these measures would improve to a 
greater degree following ACT than CBT.

METHODS

Participants

One hundred and forty-three participants (Ps) meeting DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of 
one or more anxiety disorders, including panic disorder with or without agoraphobia 
(PD/A), social anxiety disorder (SAD), specific phobia (SP), obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)2, were randomized to ACT (n = 65) or CBT 
(n = 78). All Ps who began treatment (n = 128) were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
sample (n=57 ACT, n=71 CBT). See Table 1 for ITT sample characteristics and Figure 1 for 
patient flow. Fifteen of the original 143 Ps, blinded to treatment randomization (unaware if 
they had been randomized to ACT or CBT), dropped prior to treatment initiation. Because 
pre-treatment attrition gave us no information about treatment preference or response, we 
did not analyze those Ps further. Ps who dropped prior to treatment did not differ 
significantly from Ps who began treatment on any sociodemographic variable from Table 1 
(ps ≥ .20), nor did not differ by blind assignment to ACT vs. CBT (n = 8 each, p = .66). Ps 
who dropped treatment showed somewhat higher CSRs (M = 6.07, SD = .96) relative to Ps 
who began treatment (M = 5.63, SD = .92), but group differences were small and did not 
reach statistical significance p = .08. pη2 = 02. Eleven of the 15 Ps (73%) dropped prior to 
completing the pretreatment questionnaire assessment; therefore, we could not determine if 
they differed from Ps who initiated treatment on questionnaire measures.

Ps were recruited from the Los Angeles area in response to local flyers, Craig’s List and 
local newspaper advertisements, and referrals. The study took place at the Anxiety Disorders 
Research Center at the University of California Los Angeles, Department of Psychology.

Ps were either medication-free or stabilized on psychotropic medications for a minimum 
standard length of time (1 month for benzodiazepines and beta blockers, 3 months for 
SSRIs/SNRIs and heterocyclics). Also, Ps were psychotherapy-free or stabilized on 
alternative psychotherapies other than cognitive or behavioral therapies, that were not 
focused on their anxiety disorder, for at least 6 months prior to study entry3. Ps were 
encouraged not to change their non-study medication or alternative psychotherapy during 
the course of the study. Exclusion criteria included active suicidal ideation, severe 
depression (CSR > 6 on ADIS-IV, see below), or a history of bipolar disorder, psychosis, 

2Only 4 Ps met principal diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) perhaps because our recruitment materials stated “anxiety 
disorders” but not “trauma”, therefore attracting fewer PTSD Ps. Of these, 1 did not begin treatment, 1 dropped treatment, and 2 
completed treatment. Due to the very small n for this disorder (3 total PTSD Ps who began treatment, only 1 in ACT), these 
participants were excluded from analyses.
3In order to match eligibility requirements between non-study psychotropic medication and non-study psychotherapy, we required a 
six month stabilization for each type of non-study treatment.

mental retardation or organic brain damage. Ps with substance abuse or dependence within 
the last 6 months, or with respiratory, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, muscular-
skeletal diseases or pregnancy were excluded.

Ps received 12 weeks of reduced-cost, sliding scale ($0–100/session) individual treatment, 
and received $15–$25 in cash or a gift certificate upon completion of the post-treatment and 
each followup assessment. Ps were reimbursed for UCLA parking fees for the assessments 
($8–$10). The study was fully approved by the UCLA human subjects protection 
committee; full informed consent was obtained from all Ps, including for video- and 
audiorecordings.

Design—Ps were assessed at pre-treatment (Pre), post-treatment (Post), and at 6 months 
(6mFU) and 12 months (12mFU) after Pre. Assessments included a diagnostic interview, 
self-report questionnaires, and a 2 to 3 hour laboratory assessment (except at 6mFU) 
reported elsewhere. Assessors were blind to treatment condition. Randomization sequences 
were produced by www.randomizer.org CBT to ACT. Because fewer Ps were recruited in 
the fourth compared to the third quarter, the total number of Ps who began treatment in each 
condition was unequal (n = 57 to ACT; n = 71 to CBT). To maximize statistical power for 
the main group comparison hypotheses, we did not stratify patients on any variables.

Treatments—Following the Pre ADIS-IV and laboratory assessments, Ps were 
randomized to treatment condition. Ps received twelve weekly, 1-hour individual CBT or 
ACT therapy sessions based on detailed treatment manuals delivered by doctoral student 
therapists4. If clients presented with multiple anxiety disorders, treatment focused on the 
principal disorder. Following the 12 sessions, therapists conducted follow up phone calls 
once per month for 6 months, allowing 20–35 minutes per call to check in and troubleshoot 
in a manner consistent with the assigned therapy condition, to enhance long term outcomes 
(see Craske et al., 2006).

Clinical psychology doctoral students at UCLA served as study therapists. The majority of 
therapists were relatively naïve to CBT and ACT and inexperienced more generally (i.e., in 
their first or second year of treating patients)5. Therapists were assigned to ACT, CBT, or 
both (i.e., treated in both CBT and ACT, though never at the same time), depending on the 
need for therapists in a particular condition and the availability of training in that condition 
(e.g., a multi-day training workshop with an ACT or CBT expert, see below). There were a 
total of 39 therapists; eighteen therapists worked exclusively in CBT, 9 worked exclusively 
in ACT, and 11 treated both ACT and CBT Ps (but never at the same time). Generally, 
therapists treated 1–2 patients at a time and 3–6 therapists worked within each treatment 
condition at a time. The mean number of patients treated by CBT-only therapists was M = 
1.94, SD = 1.16 (range 1–4) for a total of 35 Ps, by ACT-only therapists was M = 1.89, SD = 
1.05 (range 1–4) for a total of 17 Ps, and by therapists who treated in both conditions was M

= 6.82, SD = 1.60 (range 4–9) for a total of 75 Ps. The mean patient number for therapists 
treating in both conditions was significantly higher than the mean for ACT- or CBT-only 
therapists, ps < .001, pη2= .77 for each comparison; there were no differences between 
ACT- and CBT-only therapists. This is because therapists were allowed to gain training in 
the second treatment modality (e.g., in CBT if they started out in ACT) only if they had seen 
at least several patients in their original modality (e.g., in ACT). Consequently, therapists 
who treated in both conditions treated more overall Ps. We tested the possibility, therefore, 
that therapists treating in different conditions evidenced systematic differences in 
competency that impacted study findings, see Results, below.

Weekly, hour-long group supervision for study therapists was led separately by the principal 
authors of the treatment manuals and by advanced therapists from UCLA and from Dr. 
Hayes’ laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, where ACT was originally developed. 
All sessions were videotaped for supervision purposes with a hidden video camera; sessions 
were also audiotaped for therapy adherence purposes with a discrete digital recorder. Videos 
were generally played in supervision sessions or watched beforehand by supervisors. ACT 
supervision occurred by phone and Skype with offsite supervisors supplemented by 
occasional face-to-face sessions whereas CBT supervision was face-to-face. All therapists 
completed extensive training including an intensive 3-day workshop with the principal 
treatment manual author (author M.G.C. for CBT, and author G.E. or Dr. Hayes for ACT) 
prior to treating Ps. ACT and CBT manuals were matched on the number of sessions 
devoted to exposure but differed in coping skills and the framing of the intent of exposure.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT for anxiety disorders followed a protocol 
authored by Craske (2005), which involved a single manual with branching mechanisms that 
listed cognitive restructuring and behavioral exposure content for each anxiety disorder. 
Session 1 focused on assessment, self-monitoring, and psychoeducation. Sessions 2–4 
emphasized cognitive restructuring with hypothesis testing, self-monitoring, and breathing 
retraining. Exposure (e.g., interoceptive, in-vivo, and imaginal) was tailored to the principal 
diagnosis and focused on empiricism and anxiety reduction over time was introduced in 
Session 5, and emphasized strongly in Sessions 6–11. Session 12 focused on relapse 
prevention.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): ACT for anxiety disorders followed a 
manual authored by Eifert and Forsyth (2005). Session 1 focused on psychoeducation, 
experiential exercises and discussion that introduced acceptance, creative hopelessness, and 
valued action. Creative hopelessness involved a process of exploring whether efforts to 
manage and control anxiety had “worked” and experiencing how such efforts had led to the 
reduction or elimination of valued life activities. Ps were encouraged to behave in ways that 
enacted their personal values (“valued action”), rather than spend time managing anxiety. 
Acceptance was explored as an alternative to controlling anxiety. Sessions 2–3 further 
explored creative hopelessness and acceptance. Sessions 4 and 5 emphasized mindfulness, 
acceptance and cognitive defusion, or the process of experiencing anxiety-related language 
(e.g., thoughts, self-talk, etc.) as part of the broader, ongoing stream of present experience 
rather than getting stuck in responding to its literal meaning. Sessions 6–11 continued to

hone acceptance, mindfulness, and defusion, and added values exploration and clarification 
with the goal of increasing willingness to pursue valued life activities. Behavioral exposures, 
including interoceptive, in-vivo, and imaginal, were employed as needed to provide 
opportunities to practice making room for, mindfully observing, and accepting anxiety (all 
types of exposure) and to practice engaging in valued activities while experiencing anxiety 
(in-vivo exposures). Session 12 reviewed what worked and how to continue moving 
forward. See supplementary materials for additional details.

Outcome measures—Because CBT emphasized symptom reduction whereas ACT 
emphasized broader aims of psychological flexibility and valued living, we investigated two 
sets of primary outcomes across both treatments: anxiety specific (i.e., symptom reduction 
related) and non-anxiety specific, or broader outcomes. For the anxiety-specific measures, 
we included the severity of each principal disorder. In addition, the mixed anxiety disorder 
nature of our sample required utilization of anxiety-specific outcome measures that were 
relevant across the anxiety disorders. We selected measures of worry, fear, and behavioral 
avoidance, features that characterize all anxiety disorders (Craske et al., 2009), and 
empirically tested them to ensure that they changed following treatment across the entire 
sample (not merely within a single disorder). For the non-anxiety specific, broader measures 
we assessed quality of life and psychological flexibility.

Anxiety-Specific Primary Outcomes

Diagnostic Interview Assessment: Clinical diagnoses were ascertained using the Anxiety 
Disorders Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV) (Brown, DiNardo, & Barlow, 1994). Doctoral 
students in clinical psychology or research assistants served as interviewers after completing 
15–20 hours of training and demonstrating adequate diagnostic reliability on 3 consecutive 
interviews. ‘Clinical severity ratings’ (CSR) were made for each disorder by group 
consensus on a 0 to 8 scale (0=none, 8=extremely severe). Ratings of “4” or higher indicated 
clinical significance based on symptom severity, distress and disablement, and served as the 
cutoff for study eligibility (see Craske et al., 2007). ADIS-IV interviews were audio-
recorded and 15% (n = 22) were randomly selected for blind rating by a second interviewer.
6 Inter-rater reliability on the principal diagnosis was 100%. Inter-rater agreement on 
dimensional CSR ratings was .65 with a single-measure, one-way mixed intraclass 
correlation7 coefficient across the anxiety disorders. Inter-rater agreement for each specific 
disorder (met DSM-IV criteria vs. subclinical vs. none) was as follows: SAD (10 subclinical 
or clinical cases) and OCD (3 cases) ICC = 1.00 (100% agreement), PD/A (11 cases) ICC 
= .91, GAD (8 cases) ICC = .85, and SP (7 cases) ICC = .75.

The Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson & Reiss, 1992; Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & 
McNally, 1986)8 assesses fear of anxiety-related sensations (e.g. shortness of breath) based 
on the belief that such sensations are harmful. Although particularly elevated in panic 

6Given the mixed anxiety disorder sample and subsequently low n per disorder, ICCs for individual disorders should be interpreted 
cautiously. Note, however, that agreement was based on all 22 rated audiotapes, not just the audiotapes of Ps with clinically significant 
symptoms.
7This test was selected because the second interviewers included several different trained assessors who rated several tapes each.
8We used the original ASI because the revised ASI-3 (Taylor et al., 2007) was not yet published at study initiation.

disorder (Taylor, Koch, & McNally, 1992), the ASI shows elevation across most anxiety 
disorders (Rapee, Brown, Antony, & Barlow, 1992) relative to nonanxious controls 
(Peterson & Reiss, 1992). Current sample α’s = .85 (Pre) and .93 (Post). The Penn State 
Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer, Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990) assesses 
clinically relevant worry. Although particularly elevated in GAD, the PSWQ shows 
elevations across all anxiety disorders relative to non-anxious controls (Brown, Antony, & 
Barlow, 1992). Current sample αs = .90 (Pre) and .93 (Post). The Fear Questionnaire’s (FQ; 
Marks & Mathews, 1979) Main Target Phobia Scale, a single-item avoidance rating for each 
P’s “main phobia”, was used as the behavioral avoidance outcome.

Broader (Non-Anxiety Specific) Primary Outcomes—The Quality of Life Inventory 
(QOLI; Frisch, 1994b) assesses values and life satisfaction across 16 broad life domains and 
has good test-retest reliability and internal validity (Frisch et al., 2005). Current αs = .86 
(Pre) and .84 (Post). The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-16 (AAQ; Bond & Bunce, 
2000; Hayes et al., 2004) assesses psychological flexibility (Bond et al., 2011). The AAQ-16 
is a 16-item version of the 7- and 9-item AAQ that is hypothesized to be more sensitive to 
clinical change (Hayes et al., 2004). Both one and two-factor solutions have been fit to the 
16-item AAQ (Bond & Bunce, 2000, 2003). Herein, a one-factor scale was used, with higher 
scores indicating greater psychological flexibility. Current αs were .78 (Pre) and .86 (Post). 
See supplementary materials for additional psychometrics on primary outcomes.

Secondary Outcomes

Use of Additional Treatment: As a behavioral indication of the degree to which each 
treatment met clients’ needs, we assessed Ps reported use of additional (non-study-related) 
psychotherapy and psychotropic medication at Post-12m FU with questions on the ADIS-
IV..At each assessment point, we compared groups on the portion of Ps who initiated new, 
dropped (e.g., among Ps using therapy or medication at the previous assessment point), or 
were using any form (e.g., either new or continued from the previous assessment) of non-
study psychotherapy or psychotropic medication.

Generalization of Treatment Effects: Based on the ADIS interview, co-occurring mood 
and anxiety disorders (with CSR of 4+) at Post-12mFU were analyzed as an index of the 
generalization of treatment effects. We examined the number of co-occurring anxiety 
disorders, the presence of co-occurring mood disorders, and the total number of co-
occurring anxiety and mood disorders as indices of the generalization of treatment effects.

Treatment Credibility—Prior to the second therapy session, after the treatment rationale 
had been fully described, Ps completed a six-item treatment credibility questionnaire 
adapted from Borkovec and Nau (1972), see Supplementary materials. Total sample α = .94; 
ACT α = .92 and CBT α = .95.

Treatment Adherence and Therapist competence—Treatment sessions were 
audiotaped and 143 sessions from 91 participants (50 in CBT, 41 in ACT) were randomly 
selected for treatment adherence and therapist competency ratings using the Drexel 
University ACT/CT Therapist Adherence and Competence Rating Scale (DUACRS;

McGrath, Forman, & Herbert, in preparation). The treatment adherence items (n = 49) 
included 5 scales: general therapy adherence (12 items), general behavioral therapy 
adherence (11 items), cognitive therapy adherence (10 items), ACT adherence (16 items) 
and a therapist competence (5 items), see Supplementary materials. The first author of the 
DUACRS (McGrath), who had no involvement with the current study and extensive training 
in both ACT and CBT, completed adherence ratings. To check treatment integrity, the blind 
rater (McGrath) noted which of 49 therapist adherence items (e.g., specific therapist 
behaviors or therapy content) occurred in each 5-minute segment of therapy. Treatment-
specific subscale scores (indicating adherence to ACT or CBT) were calculated by dividing 
the number of segments during which subscale-specific therapist behavior was present (i.e., 
at least one of the items composing a subscale was coded for that five-minute segment) by 
the total number of segments in the session, yielding an estimate of the percentage of time 
spent by the therapist on treatment-specific behavior. The general therapy adherence and 
general behavioral therapy adherence scales were computed in similar manner. At the end of 
each recording, therapist competence was rated and the mean of the scale items represented 
the therapist competency rating for that session.

Statistical analyses—Raw data were inspected graphically; outliers (3SD) were replaced 
with the next higher value, following the Winsor method (Guttman, 1973), prior to data 
analysis. In full HLM models (see below), Level 1 and 2 residuals were examined for model 
outliers and fit, and outliers (3SD) were treated in the Winsor method and on two occasions, 
eliminated due to particularly strong and uncorrectable influence. Less than 5% of the data 
were modified or eliminated during outlier correction.

Longitudinal data were analyzed with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and hierarchical 
multiple linear modeling (HMLM) in HLM 6.0 (Raudenbush, Bryk, & Congdon, 2004). 
HLM/HMLM random effects models examined within and between group change across 
time (pre, post, 6m FU, 12m FU) and by condition (ACT and CBT). HLM/HMLM 
incorporates Ps with missing data by estimating the best fitting model from the data 
available for each P (Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006). Therefore, for the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
analyses, all data points for Ps who entered treatment were entered into the model. For 
Completer results, which are reported when different from ITT results, analyses included Ps 
who completed treatment and at least one subsequent assessment (Post, 6mFU, 12mFU). In 
fitting models to the longitudinal data, different variance-covariance structures were 
assessed starting with the simplest, the HLM compound symmetry model. HLM model fit 
was compared with multiple HMLM level 1 variance-covariance options (homogenous, 
heterogeneous, first order autoregressive, unstructured) using restricted log likelihood values 
(−2LL) in chi-square comparisons (see Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, & Congdon, 2004). The 
model with the best fit was selected; if models were not significantly different, the model 
with the fewest parameters was selected.

In the HLM/HMLM models, assessment time points (Pre, Post, 6mFU, 12mFU) were 
entered on Level 1, and nested within individuals on Level 2. Demographic and clinical 
covariates, and Group (dummy coded ACT vs. CBT) were entered on Level 2. Between-
group differences focused on group differences in change slopes over time and at Post and 
12mFU time points. Due to curvilinear patterns over time, quadratic and cubic time terms

were tested on Level 1 and kept in final models if they were significant and significantly 
reduced model deviance (−2LL) according to chi-square based model comparisons. Cubic 
terms were fixed in order to not overestimate the model’s random effects. For analyses of 
non-CSR outcomes, pre-CSR was covaried on the intercept to account for pre-treatment 
diagnostic severity. Effect sizes for within-group change at each assessment point were 
examined in models that included linear and quadratic slopes only for the sake of clarity and 
brevity and to avoid overinflating within-group linear effect sizes, which can occur when 
both quadratic and cubic terms are in the model. We computed d effect sizes that accounted 
for the number of repeated measurement points as needed (Feingold, 2009)9 and used 
Cohen’s (1988) guidelines for interpretation.

Differences in rate of improvement should translate into different outcomes at post-
treatment or follow up. Therefore, the Post and 12mFU time points represented our main 
time points of interest for examining cross sectional group differences.

For comorbidity analyses, we compared groups at Pre using chi-square and over time using 
repeated measures GHLM random effects repeated measure models (see Raudenbush, Bryk, 
Cheong, et al., 2004), which utilize Ps with incomplete data.

Three separate indices examined treatment response in terms of the percent of responders at 
each assessment point (Post, 6mFU, 12mFU); chi-square analyses examined between group 
differences. Diagnostic status improvement was defined in accordance with recent clinical 
trials (Newman et al., 2011; Roemer et al., 2008) as a principal diagnosis CSR of 3 or 
below. Reliable change was computed using the Jacobson & Truax (1991) method, using the 
more conservative denominator recommended by Maassen (2004). To remain consistent 
with previous randomized clinical trials, we focused the response indices on anxiety-specific 
outcomes. Due to the range of principal disorders and conservative method of defining 
change, we examined group differences in reliable change on at least 2/4 anxiety-specific 
primary outcomes (reliable change status), as well as reliable change plus falling within 1 
SD of the nonclinical normative range (or 3 or less on CSR) on at least 2/4 anxiety-specific 
primary outcomes (high end state functioning status), and reliable change on the principal 
disorder CSR plus CSR of 3 or below (diagnostic change status) (e.g., Newman et al., 2011; 
Roemer et al., 2008). See supplementary materials for employed norms and computations 
details, and Table 6 for reliable change critical values.

To assess if data were missing at random, we conducted chi-square comparisons on primary 
outcomes comparing Ps who dropped out vs. finished treatment, and treatment finishers with 
complete vs. incomplete data at 6mFU and 12mFU. For dropouts vs. finishers, no significant 
differences emerged at Pre on any primary outcome variable. For treatment finishers with 
complete vs. incomplete data, no significant differences emerged at Pre or Post, with the 
minor exception that Ps with incomplete FU data had higher ASI scores at Pre (p = .04, pη2 
=.05) but not at Post. The findings suggest that the data were missing at random.

9We did not report 95% confidence intervals for our Feingold (2009) effect sizes because there is not yet a method for doing so (see 
Feingold, 2009; Odgaard & Fowler, 2010).

Power analyses, conducted in Optimal Design (see Raudenbush & Liu, 2000), indicated that 
to reach 80% power, a cross sectional between-group difference (e.g., at 12mFU) with an 
effect size of .70 required 67 total Ps, whereas a between-group effect size of .50 required 
126 total Ps. Therefore, our total sample size (n = 128) was sufficient to detect between 
group differences of moderate size at each assessment point.

RESULTS

Pre-treatment Group Differences

At pre-treatment, ACT and CBT evidenced no significant differences on anxiety specific or 
broader outcome measures, although ASI differences approached significance, t(111) = 
1.91, p = .058 (all other outcome ps > .2). Further, ACT (8.82%, 3/34) and CBT (9.68%, 
3/31)10 showed no differences in use of non-study psychotherapy at Pre, χ2 = .01, p = .91, 
nor in use of psychotropic medication, see Table 1. ACT and CBT showed no significant 
differences on socio-demographic or clinical characteristics in Table 1 with one exception. 
Despite randomization procedures, there was a trend for higher rates of a principal diagnosis 
of PD/A in CBT (49.3%) than in ACT (32.1%), χ2 = 3.79, p = .052. In HLM analyses, 
principal PD/A diagnosis predicted superior CSR outcomes compared to non-PD/A 
principal diagnoses, at Post (B = −1.14, SE = .45, t(126) = −2.53, p = .01, d = 1.31) and 
6mFU (B = −1.01, SE = .51, t(126) = −2.11, p = .04, d = 1.16), but not at 12mFU (B = −.62, 
p = .26). Despite the significant impact of PD/A on CSR outcomes, we did not covary PD/A 
in further HLM/HMLM analyses to avoid further stratification of Ps into additional 
subgroups that lacked apriori significance and to avoid reduced statistical power to examine 
our principal comparison of CBT versus ACT. Principal PD/A did not predict other primary 
outcomes for which we found significant CBT versus ACT differences.

Treatment Credibility

Treatment credibility scores (immediately prior to Session 2) differed significantly by 
Group, F(1, 76) = 9.08, p= .004, pη2 = .11, with CBT evidencing higher scores (M = 6.08, 
SD = 1.44, n = 51) than ACT (M = 4.92, SD = 1.91, n = 27). Missing treatment credibility 
data from the first 24 ACT participants11 resulted in a lower n in this group. When the first 
24 CBT participants were excluded from analyses, group differences held: F(1, 62) = 6.34, p 
= .01, pη2=.09, with CBT again showing significantly higher scores (M = 6.00, SD = 1.53, n 
= 37) than ACT (M = 4.92, SD = 1.91, n = 27).

Therapist competence and Treatment Integrity

Therapist competency scale scores (e.g., “knowledge of treatment”, “skill in delivering 
treatment”, and “relationship with client”; 1=poor, 3=good, 5=excellent) indicated “good” 
therapist skills in CBT (M = 3.08, SD = .64) and ACT (M = 3.25, SD = .77). ACT therapists 

10To comply with IRB requirements, the original ADISs were already shred for the remaining half of the sample by the point at which 
we extracted these data. There is no reason to believe, however, that the remaining half differed from the first half in use of non-study 
psychotherapy.
11Due to administrative error in which it was not understood that the treatment credibility measure should be administered to both the 
CBT and ACT Ps.

and CBT therapists did not significantly differ on competency ratings F(1,77) = 1.17, p = .
28, pη2 = .02.

Cognitive therapy adherence scores were higher for CBT (M=62.23, SD = 18.07) than ACT 
(M = 5.03, SD = 9.83), F(1, 87) = 316.88, p < .001, pη2 = .76. Conversely, ACT adherence 
scores were higher for ACT (M = 82.26, SD = 18.04) than CBT (M = 3.94, SD = 6.40), F(1, 
87) = 813.58, p < .001, pη2 = .90. On the behavioral adherence scale, CBT (M = 47.41, SD = 
23.59) scored significantly higher than ACT (M = 25.35, SD = 18.83), F(1, 87) = 22.77, p 
< .001, pη2 = .21, however, this scale included a range of behavioral items such as therapist 
modeling that are more commonly used in CBT. We explored group differences on 
behavioral exposure-related items from the behavioral adherence scale; differences between 
CBT (M = 14.25, SD = 18.34) and ACT (M = 8.01, SD = 11.77) on behavioral exposure 
items, p = .07 pη2 = .04 did not reach full significance. The general therapy adherence scale 
did not differ significantly between CBT (M = 96.89, SD = 9.86) and ACT (M = 99.10, SD = 
4.27), F(1, 87) = 1.72, p = .19, pη2 = .02. The combined results show that therapists 
exhibited strong adherence to their assigned treatment.

To test the possibility that therapists treating in different conditions varied in competence, 
we compared CBT-only, ACT-only, and both-type (e.g., treated Ps in both CBT and ACT) 
therapists on competence. CBT-only (M = 2.96, SD = .64) and ACT-only therapists (M = 
3.02, SD = .62) showed no differences in competence (p = .81), nor did ACT-only and both-
type therapists (p = .13). Both-type therapists, however, showed significantly higher 
competence (M = 3.36, SD = .72) than CBT-only therapists (M = 2.96, SD = .64), F (1, 73) = 
5.18, p = .03, pη2 = .07. To determine if therapists who treated in a single condition 
impacted study findings, we reran the CSR analyses twice, once without CBT-only 
therapists and once without CBT- and ACT-only therapists. Although reduced power from 
lower n (which meant the analyses fell below the 80% statistical power level) meant that 
group differences were not statistically significant, the pattern of findings for group 
differences matched those reported for the full sample below, suggesting that therapist 
assignment did not impact study findings. See supplementary materials for an example of 
these results.

Treatment Attrition

Eighty-five of 128 Ps (66%) completed the full 12 sessions of therapy, including 68% 
(48/71) in CBT and 65% (37/57) in ACT. The additional 43 Ps (34%) received a partial dose 
of therapy: 13 Ps attended 1 session (5 ACT, 8 CBT) and 30 Ps (15 in each ACT and CBT) 
attended 2 to 11 therapy sessions. The portion of Ps who did not complete the full 12 
sessions did not differ by Group, χ2(1)= .40, n.s. Finally, the total number of treatment 
sessions attended by the ITT sample did not differ by Group; CBT M = 9.62 (SD = 4.08), 
ACT M = 9.37 (SD = 4.05), F(1, 126) = .12, p = .73, pη2 = .00.

group and between-group change are listed by group in Table 3. Table 4 provides the means, 
SDs, effect sizes, and diagnostic response rates for primary outcomes at Post for each 
anxiety disorder. Individual disorder outcomes were not analyzed or discussed further, 
however, because we did not design or power this study to examine group differences in 
outcomes for individual anxiety disorders.

Primary Outcomes Change Slopes: ITT

Anxiety Specific Outcomes: With the intercept (0) representing Pre, the HLM ITT model 
for CSR outcomes showed significant effects of linear, quadratic and cubic change over 
Time, all ps <.001, but no significant Group × Time interactions. However, after treatment, 
the groups showed significant differences in CSR linear slope (within the full model 
accounting for Group on higher order change terms) such that ACT continued to improve 
from Post to 12mFU, whereas CBT maintained but did not continue to improve as much, B 
= .58, SE = .28, t(126) = 2.03, p = .04, d = 1.33 (effect size of group difference from Post to 
12mFU), see Figure 2a. The CSR slopes after treatment were best fit within a HMLM 
unrestricted covariance model.

The HLM ITT model for ASI, PSWQ, and FQ outcomes showed significant effects of 
linear, quadratic, and cubic change over Time, all ps <.01, but no significant Group × Time 
interactions from pre- to post-treatment, or after treatment.

Broader Outcomes: The HLM ITT models for AAQ and QOLI outcomes showed 
significant effects of linear, quadratic, and cubic change over Time, all ps ≤ .001, but no 
significant Group × Time interactions from pre- to post-treatment, or after treatment.

Primary Outcomes Change Slopes: Completers

Anxiety Specific Outcomes: Completers evidenced a similar but smaller Group × Linear 
slope interaction for CSR after treatment, B = .43, SE = .21, t(77) = 2.05, p = .04, d = .90, 
favoring ACT. A HMLM homogenous covariance structure best fit the data.

Primary Outcomes at Post: ITT Sample

Anxiety Specific and Broader Outcomes: At Post, ACT and CBT did not differ 
significantly on any anxiety specific measure or broader outcome measure.

Primary Outcomes at 12mFU: ITT Sample

Anxiety Specific Outcomes: At 12mFU, ACT and CBT did not differ on any anxiety 
specific measure.

Broader Outcomes: At 12mFU, CBT demonstrated higher QOLI ratings than ACT, B = .
83, SE = .41, t(113) 2.05, p = .04, d = .43, see Figure 2b. In addition, group differences in 
AAQ approached significance, B = 5.10, SE = 2.86, t(117) = 1.78, p = .08, d = .42, with 
ACT showing greater psychological flexibility than CBT, see Figure 2c. An HLM 
covariance structure was the best fit for 12mFU outcomes.

Primary Outcomes at 12mFU: Completer Sample

Anxiety Specific Outcomes: ACT was assigned significantly lower CSR ratings for the 
principal anxiety disorder than CBT, B = 1.01, SE = .49, t(83) = 2.04, p = .04, d = 1.0512. A 
homogenous level 1 variance HMLM model best fit the CSR data. At this assessment point 
(12mFU), PD/A status was unrelated to CSR outcomes (see Results, above), bolstering the 
significance of this finding. The groups did not differ significantly on the ASI, PSWQ or 
FQ.

Broader Outcomes: CBT showed higher QOLI values than ACT, B = .68, SE = .32, t(65) = 
2.12, p = .03, d = .36. ACT showed significantly higher AAQ scores than CBT, B = 6.76, SE 
= 2.65, t(66) = 2.65, p = .01, d = .59.

Secondary Outcomes

Use of Additional Psychotherapy and Medication: There were no group differences at 
Post, 6mFU or 12mFU in use of new or any (e.g., new or continued) psychotropic 
medication, all ps > .44, see Supplementary materials. For dropped medication, there was no 
group difference at 6mFU, p > .69, with n’s at 12mFU too small to compare. At Post, 
however, CBT resulted in borderline greater dropped medication than ACT, B = 2.13, SE = 
1.10, p = .05 (p = .053), Exp(B) = 8.42 (95% CI: .97 to 73.06), with 37.04% (10/27) of CBT 
versus 7.14% (1/14) of ACT Ps dropping medication from Pre to Post. Because there were 
no group differences in overall medication use at Post (p = .86), however, we did not further 
analyze this borderline significant finding.

The groups did not differ in new, dropped, or any outside psychotherapy use at either Post or 
12mFU, ps > .26. At 6mFU, groups did not differ on new (p = .13) psychotherapy, however, 
ACT reported greater use of any psychotherapy (e.g., new or continued) than CBT, B = 1.29, 
SE = .63, Wald (1) = 4.28, p = .04, Exp(B) = 3.65 (95% CI: 1.07 to 12.42): 39% (11/28) of 
ACT Ps versus 19% (5/27) of CBT Ps. To explore the clinical impact of this finding, we 
reran the CSR analyses dropping the Ps who reported any psychotherapy use at 6mFU, and 
found that the results followed the same pattern as the ITT analysis reported above. Further, 
we assessed whether psychotherapy use at 6mFU predicted principal diagnosis CSRs at 
6mFU or 12mFU and found that it did not (ps > .4 for both ACT and CBT). Given these two 
sets of null findings, additional psychotherapy at 6mFU was not covaried in subsequent 
analyses. Exploratory analyses showed, however, that ACT patients who remained severe 
(CSR 4+) following treatment were somewhat more likely to seek additional treatment than 
CBT patients that remained severe, p = .07, see Supplementary materials.

Generalization of Treatment Effects: The groups did not differ significantly in the number 
of co-occurring anxiety, mood, or anxiety and mood disorders combined at Pre, ps >. 18. 
Nor did the groups differ significantly in rates of reduction of co-occurring disorders over 

12Due to the fact that study selection criteria required a CSR of 4 or above, the pre-treatment CSR range was restricted. Thus, the pre-
treatment SD, which serves as the denominator in the Feingold (2009) effect size formula, was less than half the SD of the 12m FU 
CSRs in magnitude (whereas 12m FU SDs on other outcome measures were ≤ their SDs at pre-treatment). If we use the SD at 12m FU 
to compute effect size for 12m FU group differences on CSR, d = .44.

Treatment Response Rates—The groups did not significantly differ in treatment

DISCUSSION

Within a randomized clinical trial, we aimed to test the efficacy of ACT relative to a gold 
standard treatment for anxiety disorders, CBT. Because ACT represents a transdiagnostic 
treatment approach (Hayes et al., 1999), we focused on a mixed anxiety disorder sample. 
We explored the degree to which each treatment reduced anxiety symptoms, and tested the 
hypothesis that ACT would improve measures of quality of life and psychological flexibility 
to a greater extent than CBT.

Overall, the findings demonstrated that ACT and CBT did not differ significantly at post-
treatment on either anxiety specific or broader outcomes. Over the follow up interval, group 
differences emerged with ACT showing superiority over CBT on principal disorder severity 
and psychological flexibility outcomes. However, the follow-up group differences are 
complicated by the fact that significantly more ACT participants utilized outside 
psychotherapy during the initial followup interval than CBT participants. Our hypothesis 
that ACT would improve more than CBT on broader outcomes met with limited support; on 
one broad outcome, ACT improved more than CBT but on the other, CBT improved more 
than ACT.

Primary Outcomes

On all primary outcomes, ACT and CBT showed substantial improvement from pre- to post-
treatment. On anxiety-specific outcomes, within-group linear effect sizes in ACT and CBT 
from pre- to post-treatment ranged from very large for principal disorder severity (CSR) to 
moderate or large for other anxiety outcomes. Thus, both treatments were highly efficacious. 
Anxiety-related outcomes continued to improve through the six-month follow-up assessment 
within both ACT and CBT. From six to twelve months, improvement slowed but treatment 
gains endured. On broader outcomes, both groups showed large improvements in 
psychological flexibility and more moderate improvements in quality of life at post-
treatment. Broader outcomes continue to improve through six-month follow up and gains 
endured from six to twelve-month follow up. In summary, ACT and CBT resulted in 
significant improvements from pre- to post-treatment that were maintained or improved 
upon during follow up, on both anxiety-specific and broader outcomes. Further, 
improvements were evident across two different dimensions of treatment response, namely, 
more objective, clinician-rated CSR outcomes as well as subjective, patient-rated self-report 
outcomes.

From the end of treatment through to the 12-month follow up, several noteworthy group 
differences emerged. On anxiety-specific outcomes, ACT demonstrated a steeper 
improvement rate than CBT in the principal disorder severity rating, a difference of large 
effect size. ACT’s steeper improvement rates resulted in lower principal disorder severity

ratings than CBT at the 12 month follow up, again of large effect size, although statistically 
significant effects were limited to the Completer sample. Over the long term, therefore, ACT 
more effectively reduced principal anxiety disorder severity than CBT among those who 
completed treatment. This finding is consistent with a previous study (Lappalainen et al., 
2007) that found that ACT resulted in more symptom improvement that CBT, albeit in a 
much smaller sample (n = 28) of unselected outpatients. However, since more ACT than 
CBT patients in the current study utilized outside therapy during the initial follow up 
interval, we cannot fully determine whether ACT’s superiority resulted from the ACT 
treatment alone or ACT plus additional psychotherapy. Excluding patients using non-study 
therapy from the principal disorder severity analyses, however, did not change the pattern of 
results, suggesting that use of non-study therapy did not influence the principal disorder 
severity findings.

For broader outcomes, one unexpected finding was that CBT participants reported 
significantly higher quality of life than ACT at 12-month follow up, a difference of 
moderate effect size. It had been hypothesized that the explicit focus on valued living in 
ACT would lead to greater improvements in quality of life. Conceivably, our measure of 
quality of life was too general to capture values-specific improvements. Consistent with 
hypotheses, however, ACT participants reported higher levels of psychological flexibility 
than CBT at 12-month follow up on a measure specifically designed to capture ACT-related 
improvement (Hayes et al., 2004). Please refer to the Supplementary materials for further 
discussion of primary outcomes.

Finally, ACT and CBT produced similar rates of reliable change, diagnostic improvement, 
and high end state functioning, comparable to our recent review showing that on average the 
mean response rate for CBT across anxiety disorder studies from 2000–2011 was 51.36% at 
post-treatment (180 studies) and 54.80% at follow-up (71 studies) (Loerinc, Meuret, 
Twohig, Rosenfield, & Craske, in submission). Very few studies (of the 180) used reliable 
change index methods to compute treatment response rates but the few that did (e.g., Addis 
et al., 2004; Carter, Sbrocco, Gore, Marin, & Lewis, 2003) evidenced response rates 
comparable to those in the present study.

Secondary outcomes

As noted above, more ACT than CBT patients reported non-study psychotherapy (new or 
continued psychotherapy) at the 6-month follow-up assessment, although there were no 
group differences in the initiation of new psychotherapy during this period nor in medication 
use, nor any group differences on these variables at 12-month follow up. Reasons for this 
group difference, nonetheless, were explored. The data showed some support for the notion 
that ACT patients who remained distressed following treatment were more likely to seek 
additional psychotherapy than CBT patients who remained distressed. Another possibility is 
that the broader focus on exploring personal values, pursuing meaningful life behaviors, and 
contacting the full range of emotions in ACT inspired patients to continue engaging in 
psychotherapy.

Both ACT and CBT resulted in robust reductions in co-occurring mood and anxiety 
disorders. This finding demonstrates that treatment effects generalized in both groups,

replicating and extending previous work on the broader effects of CBT for panic disorder 
and generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., Borkovec, Abel, & Newman, 1995; Tsao, 
Mystkowski, Zucker, & Craske, 2005).

Treatment and Therapist Variables

Attrition rates were relatively high across both ACT and CBT; however, no group 
differences emerged. Attrition was comparable to some large trials of CBT for anxiety 
disorders (e.g. Barlow et al., 2000) but was higher than the mean attrition (23%) reported in 
a meta-analysis of CBT studies for anxiety disorders (Hofmann & Smits, 2008). Although 
attrition reasons for many patients remain unknown, we suspect that four features of our 
study may have contributed to attrition. First, the study took place in a difficult to locate, 
high-traffic, parking-challenged clinic with limited public transportation options, and travel 
times to and from treatment often exceeded 45 minutes each way. Second, our assessments 
included a 2 to 3 hour physiological laboratory session that was strongly anxiety provoking 
for many patients (e.g. involving hyperventilation, negative picture slide viewing, etc.), 
which may have discouraged patients from study completion. Third, unlike many studies 
where treatment is free or low cost for all, most patients paid for treatment, and incurred 
significant parking costs. Fourth, we offered few incentives for treatment completion and 
failed to sufficiently incentivize post-treatment and follow-up assessment completion. 
Higher incentives may have been particularly needed in a study with such significant 
treatment barriers (e.g., long travel times, parking fees and difficulties, treatment fees, etc.).

An important finding to emerge from blind treatment integrity ratings was that ACT and 
CBT were clearly distinguished from one another and that therapists strongly adhered to the 
designated treatment. Despite the use of novice student therapists, therapists averaged 
“good” overall skills across both treatments with no differences between treatment groups. 
Therapists treating patients in both CBT and ACT nonetheless evidenced significantly 
higher competence than therapists treating in CBT only. Principal diagnostic severity 
analyses of patients treated only by “both-type” therapists showed the same pattern of 
outcomes, however, suggesting that these differences did not impact overall study findings.

Early in treatment, CBT was rated as a more credible treatment than ACT by a medium 
effect size. Thus, ACT therapists were not as successful as CBT therapists in convincing 
patients early on that they offered a credible treatment. This difference did not appear to 
influence attrition rates, which did not differ by group. Conceivably, abstract ideas of 
acceptance and creative hopelessness in initial ACT sessions (rather than concrete skills in 
CBT) contributed to a diminished sense of treatment credibility. Future studies should assess 
treatment credibility regularly throughout ACT to determine whether ACT follows a delayed 
trajectory in convincing patients that it offers something credible, or whether ACT patients 
remain skeptical throughout treatment but improve anyway. The latter would suggest that 
treatment credibility is relatively unimportant to the success of ACT. Certainly, in the 
current study, the lowered credibility ratings relative to CBT did not appear to disadvantage 
ACT outcomes relative to CBT outcomes.

Study Limitations

Page 18

Several study limitations should be noted. First, our mixed anxiety disorder sample limits 
the conclusions that may be drawn about any single anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders 
typically co-occur at high rates with other anxiety disorders and share many common 
features (see Barlow, 2002; Craske et al., 2009), however, strengthening the ecological 
validity of this approach. Second, relatively high attrition rates may have resulted in 
underestimated treatment effects or compromised ability to accurately assess treatment-
related improvements in the ITT sample. On the other hand, we utilized a sophisticated 
statistical approach (HLM, HMLM) that utilized patients with incomplete data and drew 
upon all available data in the ITT analyses; we also conducted a separate Completers 
analyses. Third, we did not assess therapist allegiance, which may have impacted treatment 
results given that the study was conducted within a CBT-renowned research clinic. Based on 
the relatively inexperienced and junior nature of the therapists, however, allegiance is 
unlikely to be a significant factor. Therapist experience raises another limitation, which is 
that the results may differ in the hands of more experienced therapists. Fourth, CBT 
supervision was conducted onsite in a face-to-face manner whereas most ACT supervision 
was conducted via phone or Skype with offsite supervisors. We did not assess supervision 
quality and thus could not investigate the impact of this group difference. Fifth, we did not 
systematically assess reasons for attrition, and thus could not assess whether ACT and CBT 
differed in the extent to which patients dropped out because they were unsatisfied with 
treatment. Future ACT/CBT studies should assess group differences in stated reasons for 
attrition. Sixth, we utilized a single item rating from the Fear Questionnaire for behavioral 
avoidance due to the lack of avoidance measures relevant to all anxiety disorders. Seventh, 
we used a website to generate the randomization sequence whereas use of an external 
agency would have been preferable. Eighth, we did not include a no-treatment or treatment-
as-usual control group, which may have obscured our capacity to assess improvement due to 
treatment versus the passage of time. It has been argued, however, that comparing a newer 
to a well-established treatment does not require a no-treatment or waitlist control group and 
is more ethical without one (Kazdin, 2002). Also, the roughly equal number of treatment 
sessions devoted to behavioral exposure in ACT and CBT may have obscured treatment 
differences. The two treatment conditions were matched on exposure, albeit framed with 
different intents, given the potency of exposure as a change agent. This feature may have 
altered the way that ACT is typically done. In addition, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire 
scores at pre-treatment in the GAD subsample were considerably lower that those in recently 
published randomized trials for GAD (Newman et al., 2011; Roemer et al., 2008), which 
may hold implications for the interpretation of findings in this subgroup. Finally, regarding 
the generalizability of our findings, our sample largely reflected the racial, ethnic, and sex 
distribution of U.S. residents at the time of data collection (Bureau, 2012), supporting the 
broad generalizability of our findings. On the other hand, our sample was relatively educated 
(the average participant had completed 3.5 years of college) and thus, our findings may not 
generalize to less educated samples. Further, we cannot assume that treatment was equally 
efficacious across racial subgroups because we lacked the statistical power to examine 
whether outcomes differed by race. This remains an important question for future research.

Summary and conclusion

To our knowledge, this study represents the first randomized clinical trial comparing ACT 
and CBT for anxiety disorders. Despite differences in underlying treatment models, the 
overall findings are characterized by similarities in the immediate and long-term impact of 
both treatments. We have argued elsewhere (Arch & Craske, 2008) that ACT and CBT for 
anxiety disorders may represent different approaches to affecting common therapeutic 
changes. This study largely supports this hypothesis. On the other hand, some differences 
did emerge, in that CBT resulted in higher quality of life whereas ACT resulted in greater 
psychological flexibility, and, among those who completed treatment, lower principal 
anxiety disorder severity, over the follow-up. Overall, our findings suggest that ACT is a 
highly viable psychosocial treatment alternative to CBT, the current gold standard 
psychosocial treatment for anxiety disorders. Further, they pave the way for future 
investigations of for whom each treatment approach is most effective, and the shared versus 
unique mechanisms of therapeutic change.
