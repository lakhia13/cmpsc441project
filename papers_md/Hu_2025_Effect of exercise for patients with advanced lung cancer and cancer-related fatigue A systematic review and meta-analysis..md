Abstract

Background: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a signiﬁcant burden for patients with advanced lung cancer. While exercise is recommended for
managing CRF during pre- and active treatment phases, evidence supporting its efﬁcacy in advanced stage remains limited. This systematic
review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the effects of exercise on CRF and its common complications in patients with advanced lung cancer.
Methods: A systematic search of 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science) was conducted up to July 10, 2024 to identify
relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were selected based on predeﬁned eligibility criteria, including adult patients with
advanced lung cancer reporting fatigue as an outcome. Study selection followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0). The quality of evidence
was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Random- or ﬁxed-effects
models were used for meta-analyses based on heterogeneity levels.
Results: Eight RCTs involving 749 patients were included. Meta-analysis revealed that exercise signiﬁcantly improved CRF in patients with
advanced lung cancer (standardized mean difference (SMD) = (cid:1)0.33; 95% conﬁdence interval (95%CI): (cid:1)0.54 to (cid:1)0.12); p = 0.00; I2 = 0.00%).
Subgroup analysis showed greater efﬁcacy in patients aged (cid:1)60 years (p = 0.028), those engaging in traditional Chinese exercise (p = 0.003),
and interventions lasting fewer than 12 weeks (p = 0.017). Exercise also signiﬁcantly improved quality of life (SMD = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.02(cid:1)0.55;
p = 0.04; I2 = 0.00%) and reduced dyspnea (SMD = (cid:1)0.43; 95%CI: (cid:1)0.71 to (cid:1)0.16; p = 0.00; I2 = 0.00%). No signiﬁcant effects were observed
on sleep quality, anxiety, or depression. The risk of bias across studies was moderate, and the quality of evidence, as evaluated by GRADE, was
rated as low due to study limitations. Adverse events were minimal, with only one mild, exercise-related event reported.
Conclusion: Exercise signiﬁcantly alleviates CRF in patients with advanced lung cancer, improves certain complications, and enhances quality
of life. The intervention’s effectiveness varies by age, type of exercise, and duration. Further high-quality studies are needed to validate these
ﬁndings.

1. Introduction

Lung cancer is the second most prevalent malignancy
worldwide.1 Advancements in anti-tumor
therapies have
extended the treatment cycle and survival period of patients
with lung cancer.2 Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common
and frequent symptom burden associated with cancer and its
treatment, occurring in 39%(cid:1)90% of patients undergoing anti-

Peer review under responsibility of Shanghai University of Sport.

cancer treatment.3 Studies indicate that patients with lung
cancer endure a heavier burden of fatigue compared to other
cancer types, with 81.5% of advanced lung cancer cases
fatigue.4 The National
experiencing varying degrees of
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines deﬁne
CRF as a distressing, persistent, and subjective sense of
physical, emotional, and/or cognitive fatigue or exhaustion
that is disproportionate to recent activity and interferes with
normal functioning.5

The pathogenesis of CRF remains unclear and may involve
inﬂammatory response, and

skeletal muscle metabolism,

nervous or central nervous system dysfunction.6 Additionally,
CRF rarely exists alone and is often accompanied by insomnia,
emotional disorders, dyspnea, and other symptoms. Current
guidelines lack speciﬁc drug recommendations, and potential
therapeutic agents, such as psychotropic drugs and corticoste-
roids, have limited efﬁcacy and may pose potential toxicity
with long-term use.7 As a result, in recent years, doctors and
patients worldwide have increasingly turned to complementary
medicine. Previous studies have demonstrated that non-drug
therapies, particularly exercise, can alleviate CRF and various
improve
concomitant symptoms in patients with cancer,
quality of life and survival rate, and are more effective than
drug therapies.8,9

While some systematic reviews have explored the effects of
exercise on CRF in patients with lung cancer, most have
concentrated on early- and mid-stage disease, with relatively
few addressing advanced-stage cases.10,11 Studies have
demonstrated that exercise is safe for patients with advanced
lung cancer12,13 and that the occurrence of CRF in this popula-
tion is closely associated with various factors,
including
treatment modalities and individual conditions of patients.14
The etiology of CRF in advanced-stage lung cancer differs
from earlier stages due to the additional impact of tumor
burden, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy,5 which signiﬁcantly
reduce cardiopulmonary function and exercise capacity. These
complexities make it challenging to fully determine the precise
impact of exercise interventions in this group. While recent
studies have begun to explore the effects of different exercise
modalities (e.g., aerobic vs. resistance training) on CRF across
various types of cancer, including lung cancer,15 the optimal
intervention is still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to
evaluate the effectiveness and safety of exercise interventions
in patients with advanced lung cancer and CRF through
meta-analysis, providing medical evidence for the clinical
practice and application of exercise.

2. Methods

This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide-
lines16 and has been registered in the International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO) database
(CRD: 42024528936).

2.1. Literature search

Following the Population,

Intervention, Comparison,
Outcome, and Study Design (PICOS) principles outlined in
PRISMA Guideline,16 all included studies met these criteria:
(a) Participant type: Age 18 or older; and only patients with
advanced lung cancer, including those clinically diagnosed
with stage IIIb-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Studies were
included if patients with advanced lung cancer comprised
more than 50% of the total patient population.17 (b) Interven-
tion type: Exercise only, including combinations of aerobic
exercise, endurance exercise, resistance training, and tradi-
tional Chinese exercise, with no restrictions on the exercise

type, frequency, session length, or overall duration. Studies
not exclusively focusing on exercise were excluded, including
those combining other interventions like medication, nutri-
tional support, and breathing training. Control group included
general supportive care, health education, low frequency exer-
cise, or no intervention. (c) Outcome type: Fatigue must be an
outcome indicator, and CRF should be evaluated using a vali-
dated scale, such as Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy(cid:1)Fatigue (FACT-F). (d) Study
type: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including single-
blind, open-label, 2-arm or 3-arm studies are allowed.

Electronic searches were conducted through July 10, 2024
across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science
databases without restrictions on language or publication
period. The search strategy involved a combination of free
words and Mesh terms, and the search terms mainly included
“Lung Neoplasms”, “cancer related fatigue”, “exercise”, and
“RCT”. Detailed search strategies for each database are avail-
able in the Supplementary materials.

After removing duplicate articles, 2 reviewers (YH and SG)
independently assessed the search results using Endnote21
(Clarivate, London, UK). Following the screening criteria,
irrelevant studies were excluded based on the titles and
abstracts, while the remaining studies were retrieved and
thoroughly reviewed. When disagreements arose,
the 2
reviewers (YH and SG) discussed the issues until a consensus
was achieved. If a consensus was still not achieved, the matter
was discussed and resolved with the third senior author (YX).

2.2. Data extraction

All data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers (YH
and SG) and recorded in a pre-prepared Excel table (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA). Extracted information included the ﬁrst
author, study type, study year, study population, sample size,
ages of participants, type and stage of lung cancer, intervention
type, duration, exercise session length, frequency, and number
of follow-up visits. CRF and associated complications were
evaluated using validated scales and scores before and after
including
intervention. Statistical variables were extracted,
mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), and 95%
conﬁdence interval (95%CI).

2.3. Statistical analysis

p

Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 16 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, TX, USA). Outcome indicators, evaluated via
scale scores as continuous data, included the mean and SD for
all experiments. For experiments lacking SD, conversion used
the number of sample size (n), SE, applying the formula
ﬃﬃﬃ
SD = SE £
. Due to differences in the rating scales, stan-
n
dardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to standardize
the results, facilitating comparison across all studies. If the
scales in different studies had varying directions (e.g., some
scales were positively correlated with outcome measures
while others were negatively correlated), the mean of the
measures from negatively correlated scales was multiplied by
(cid:1)1 to ensure consistency.18

The I2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity. An I2
value less than 50% indicated low heterogeneity, while a value
of 50% or more indicated medium to high heterogeneity. If
moderate or high heterogeneity was determined in the study, a
random effects model was employed; otherwise, a ﬁxed effects
model was used. To investigate the impact of various factors on
the effectiveness of exercise interventions, studies were grouped
for subgroup analysis based on characteristics, such as patient
demographics, exercise type, frequency, and duration.

2.4. Risk of bias, quality of evidence, and sensitivity analysis

Two examiners independently assessed the methodological
quality of the studies. The Cochrane Bias Risk Assessment
Tool (RoB 2.0)19 was used to evaluate random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, investigator and subject
blinding, outcome blinding, data integrity, selective reporting,
and other biases. The quality of evidence was assessed using
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation (GRADE) system,20 evaluating factors such as
risk of bias, inconsistencies, indirectness, imprecision, publica-
tion bias. Based on these evaluations, evidence quality was
classiﬁed as high, medium, low, or very low. GRADE pro soft-
ware was used to evaluate the evidence and summarize the
ﬁndings. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion
among reviewers, including senior authors when necessary.

To ensure the robustness of the meta-analysis results, a
sensitivity analysis was conducted to exclude highly heteroge-
neous studies. This analysis assessed the impact of individual
studies on the overall results using a one-by-one exclusion
method, aiming to identify sources of high heterogeneity and
to verify the reliability of the results.

3. Results

3.1. Study selection

The search strategies were conducted in PubMed, Embase,
Cochrane, and Web of Science, retrieving a total of 842 refer-
ences. After excluding duplicates and retracted studies, 621
articles remained. After title screening, 415 articles were
excluded; and 106 articles were excluded after abstract
screening, leaving 100 articles. After full text review, 92 litera-
tures were excluded for reasons including lack of full text
(n = 46), no results (n = 24), unclear advanced lung cancer stage
(n = 13), no RCT (n = 5), and lack of fatigue as an outcome
(n = 4). Additionally, 4 articles were excluded because fewer
than 50% of participants were patients with advanced lung
cancer. Ultimately, 8 articles were included in the ﬁnal review:
6 for data analysis and 2 for systematic review only. Fig. 1
provides a ﬂowchart summarizing the study screening process,
in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines.16

with advanced lung cancer. In 4 cases, the average participant
age was over 60.22(cid:1)25 The intervention methods included 3 cate-
gories: (a) aerobic exercises, such as walking or cycling; (b)
traditional Chinese exercises, such as Tai Chi and Qigong; (c)
mixed exercises, combining aerobic exercise and strength
training. Exercise sessions lasted from 90 min to 480 min, with
intervention durations spanning 8(cid:1)24 weeks. A total of 2 studies
were conducted exclusively under the supervision of profes-
sional coaches or physical therapists,23,26 5 studies included both
professional supervision and self-practice,21,24,25,27,28 and 1
study was conducted under monitoring via a pedometer.22 Exer-
cise intensity ranged from low to high. Three studies explicitly
mentioned exercise goals.22,23,25 Motivational strategies included
and
sending scheduled messages, making phone
encouraging patients to keep exercise diaries. Six studies tailored
the exercise plans based on participants’ baseline status or
recovery conditions,21(cid:1)25,27 and 3 studies regularly adjusted the
exercise plans.22,23,25 Exercise adherence ranged from 61.5% to
89.0%. Control groups received interventions ranging from low
frequency exercise to health education, health care, group talk,
or no intervention. CRF assessment scales varied across studies,
including BFI, FACT-F, European Organisation for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)(cid:1)Fatigue, and the Multi-
dimensional Fatigue Symptom List(cid:1)Short Form (MFSI-SF).
More details related to the interventions, including speciﬁc exer-
cise protocols, are summarized in Table 1.

software). One study did not mention allocation hiding,22 6
studies explicitly described the process,21,24(cid:1)28 and 1 study did
not implement it based on research characteristics.23 Two studies
were open-label,22,23 while 3 employed single-blinding or
assessor-blinding.21,24,28 Five studies showed a high risk of
implementation bias because participant blinding was not feasible
due to speciﬁcity.22,23,25,26,28 The remaining 3 studies, either
3-arm21,24 or involving low-frequency exercise,27 were assessed
as low risk. Outcome assessment blinding was clearly reported in
4 studies,22,23,26,27 while it was unclear in the remaining 4. Two
studies reported only inter-group comparative data,21,23 omitting
complete intra-group data. Reporting bias was unclear in all
studies except for those conducted by Dhillon et al.23 and Take-
mura et al.21 All studies exhibited a low risk for other biases. The
bias risk map is detailed in the Supplementary materials.

One study23 characterized by a high risk of bias and low
quality was excluded in a one-by-one sensitivity analysis,
revealing no signiﬁcant effect on the overall results (Supple-
mentary materials).

3.4. Primary outcome

3.4.1. Fatigue

All studies used CRF as an outcome indicator, with data
reported in 6 studies.22,24(cid:1)28 The studies available for analysis
used different scales to evaluate changes in CRF, including
EORTC,22,26 FACT-F,25,28 BFI,24 and MFSI.27 Except for the
FACT-F scale, higher scores indicated greater
levels of
fatigue. The summary analysis, as shown in Fig. 2, indicated
the intervention endpoint, exercise signiﬁcantly
that at
improved CRF in patients with advanced lung cancer
compared to the control group (SMD = (cid:1)0.33; 95%CI:
(cid:1)0.54 to (cid:1)0.12; p = 0.00; I2 = 0.00%).

3.4.2. Subgroup analysis

To explore the potential differences caused by various
clinical factors, a subgroup analysis was conducted, as shown
in Fig. 3. It was found that an exercise duration of fewer than
12 weeks (p = 0.017; I2 = 19.60%), traditional Chinese exercise
(p = 0.003; I2 = 0.00%), and patients aged 60 years or younger
(p = 0.028; I2 = 16%) signiﬁcantly impacted CRF in patients
with advanced lung cancer.

3.5. Secondary outcomes
3.5.1. Quality of life (cid:1) functional status

Three studies reported quality of life(cid:1)functional status
assessment,24,25,28 2 using the EORTC scale24,28 and one using
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy(cid:1)General
(FACT-G) scale.25 Higher scores represented better functional
status and quality of life. The results indicated that exercise
signiﬁcantly improved the quality of life in patients with
advanced lung cancer compared to the control group
(SMD = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.02(cid:1)0.55; p = 0.04; I2 = 0.00%), as
shown in Fig. 4.

3.5.2. Dyspnea

Three studies

for dyspnea,22,26,28
reported outcomes
assessed using the EORTC(cid:1)Speciﬁc Symptom Scale, where
higher scores indicated more severe symptoms. The results
demonstrated that, compared to conventional care, exercise
signiﬁcantly reduced dyspnea in patients with advanced lung
cancer (SMD = (cid:1)0.43; 95%CI: (cid:1)0.71 to (cid:1)0.16; p = 0.00;
I2 = 0.00%), as shown in Fig. 5.

3.5.3. Insomnia

Two studies reported outcomes for sleep quality24,25: one
used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale,24 where
higher scores indicated poorer sleep quality, and the other

used the Pain and Sleep Quality(cid:1)Sleep Scale,25 where higher
scores indicated better sleep quality. The results demonstrated
that exercise did not signiﬁcantly improve sleep quality in
patients with advanced lung cancer compared to controls
(SMD = (cid:1)0.15; 95%CI: (cid:1)1.03 to 0.73; p = 0.74; I2 = 71.04%),
as shown in Fig. 6.

3.5.4. Anxiety

Two studies reported outcomes for anxiety,24,28 one using
and Depression Scale(cid:1)Anxiety
the Hospital Anxiety
subscale24 and the other using the Depression Anxiety Stress
Scales(cid:1)Anxiety subscale.28 In both scales, higher scores indi-
cated more severe anxiety. The results demonstrated that

exercise did not signiﬁcantly improve anxiety in patients with
advanced lung cancer compared to the control group
(SMD = (cid:1)0.48; 95%CI: (cid:1)1.17 to 0.21; p = 0.18; I2 = 67.49%),
as shown in Fig. 6.

3.5.5. Depression

Two studies reported outcomes for depression,22,24 one using
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(cid:1)Depression
subscale24 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
scale,22 both indicating that the higher scores reﬂect more severe
depression. The results demonstrated that exercise did not signif-
icantly improve depressive symptoms in patients with advanced
lung cancer compared to controls (SMD = 0.15; 95%CI: (cid:1)0.61
to 0.91; p = 0.71; I2 = 63.35%), as shown in Fig. 6.

3.6. Adverse events

Adverse events were observed in 721(cid:1)26,28 of the 8 studies,
as summarized in the Supplementary materials. Only 1 study

reported 4 mild adverse events23 (back or muscle soreness)
associated with the exercise intervention, all of which resolved
without treatment.

3.7. Certainty of evidence

The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low. The
downgrading reasons included: (a) Serious risk of bias: Several
studies lacked researcher and participant blinding, potentially
leading to biased outcome evaluations. Additionally, some
studies failed to directly report CRF outcomes, with instances
of selective reporting and incomplete outcome data.
(b)
Serious indirectness: Some studies included patients with
other types and stages of cancer and were not fully representa-
tive of the target population of patients with advanced lung
cancer. In addition, CRF was only used as a secondary
outcome indicator in most studies, limiting the direct applica-
bility of the results. See Supplementary materials for GRADE
grading tables.

4. Discussion

and

The incidence of fatigue is highest

in advanced-stage
patients, particularly among those with lung cancer, who expe-
challenging-to-manage CRF
rience more
severe
symptoms.29 Complementary therapies,
including exercise,
massage, and psychological interventions are recommended in
guidelines5 for both active and post-treatment CRF patients
due to their proven efﬁcacy and minimal side effects.30,31
Previous studies on exercise for patients with lung cancer
primarily focused on early and middle stages, lacking evidence
on the effectiveness and safety of exercise for patients with
advanced lung cancer. Some studies suggest that exercise can
effectively improve CRF in advanced-stage patients32,33 while
others indicate that it has minimal impact in patients with lung
cancer.34 These earlier systematic reviews did not specify
tumor types and stages, and thus failed to elucidate the role of
exercise in patients with advanced lung cancer. Therefore, this
review analyzed the latest RCTs from the past 11 years
(2012(cid:1)2023), summarizing the characteristics of these studies
and speciﬁcally focusing on advanced lung cancer. Since CRF
rarely occurs as an isolated symptom,5 this study also focused
on the intervention effects of exercise on common complica-
tions of CRF in patients with advanced lung cancer, providing
valuable insights for clinical symptom management. Further-
more, by including only RCTs, the study ensured high research
quality and allowed for comprehensive subgroup analysis of
clinical factors, resulting in more robust conclusions. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst meta-analysis to investigate the
effects of exercise on CRF in patients with advanced lung
cancer, providing novel insights and reinforcing the evidence
base for current guideline recommendations.

In our study, exercise signiﬁcantly improved CRF in
patients with advanced lung cancer. Although an MCID
speciﬁcally for CRF in lung cancer has not yet been estab-
lished, research has proposed MCID values for other cancer
types or multiple cancer populations.35 Notably, 5 out of 6
studies exceeded the MCID for scales such as EORTC,22,26
FACT-F,25,28 and MFSI,27 indicating that exercise interven-
tions may offer meaningful improvements in CRF for this
population. Exercise could be a valuable non-pharmacological
approach, helping to improve daily functioning,
treatment
tolerance, and overall quality of life for patients with advanced
lung cancer. Further research is needed to establish a consis-
tent MCID for CRF in lung cancer patients, which would
enhance the precision of clinical assessments and interven-
tions. Subgroup analysis revealed that short-term exercise
(t < 12 weeks) had signiﬁcant effects. This may be because as
tumors progress in patients with advanced lung cancer, their
physical function gradually declines. Over time, the burden of
severe fatigue and other symptoms prevents them from
meeting the high exercise standards required by many
studies.36 Additionally, cancer treatments such as radiotherapy
and chemotherapy can cause cardiotoxicity, damage the
cardiopulmonary system, and impair exercise capacity.37 The
effectiveness of CRF treatment is closely related to cancer
progression, and non-drug therapies are often insufﬁcient to

traditional Chinese

reverse the condition in terminal patients.31 The effect of exer-
cise on CRF was signiﬁcant in patients aged 60 years or
younger, suggesting that the effect of intervention on fatigue
was closely related to baseline condition.29 Furthermore, the
effect of
intervention was
notable.38,39 Growing evidence suggests that physical and
mental exercises, such as tai chi and Qigong, have a positive
impact on patients with lung cancer. However, the long-term
effects of
traditional Chinese exercise on CRF remain
unclear,40 necessitating further clinical trials to conﬁrm their
effectiveness. This study also concluded that exercise could
improve dyspnea, functional status, and quality of life in
patients with advanced lung cancer, corroborating ﬁndings
from previous systematic reviews.4,33,41,42 Given that patients
with lung cancer often experience more severe anxiety and
depression compared to other cancer patients,43 and their
mental health tends to deteriorate as the disease progresses,
exercise may not effectively mitigate anxiety and depression
in patients with advanced lung cancer.

Research indicates that patients with advanced lung cancer
often suffer from severe cardiopulmonary limitations and
muscle atrophy. Exercise can potentially slow tumor progres-
sion by modulating the immune microenvironment, promoting
tumor cell apoptosis, and regulating the tumor extracellular
matrix.44 Exercise may also alleviate treatment side effects
and improve patient tolerability.45 Additionally, exercise can
enhance cardiorespiratory ﬁtness, promote muscle recovery,46
and generally improve overall patient status and quality of life.
Clinical studies have observed that while most participants
attempted an exercise program, fewer than half completed the
intervention, and those who completed the program exhibited
positive results.47 Therefore, it is essential to approach the
clinical prescription of exercise rehabilitation programs with
caution.37 It is necessary to carefully consider the patient’s
current tolerance and expected outcomes48 as well as strategies
to enhance patient compliance and reduce dropout rates. Only
1 of the included studies reported a minor adverse event
related to the exercise intervention, speciﬁcally lower back
muscle soreness, which was resolved without
treatment.
Compared to drug therapy, exercise is highly safe, free of
signiﬁcant side effects, and relatively low-cost, making it a
suitable option for patients with advanced lung cancer and a
potential clinical treatment approach.

In summary, patients with advanced lung cancer and CRF
may beneﬁt from starting exercise interventions as early as
possible under appropriate conditions. In clinical practice,
exercise plans for patients with advanced lung cancer and CRF
should be individualized by medical staff and physical thera-
pists, considering the patient’s age, gender, exercise tolerance,
and need for supervision. Plans should be adjusted moderately
to achieve optimal improvement in CRF.48

There are several limitations in the included studies, which
may affect the conclusions of this research. Firstly, the total
number of included studies is small, and the sample size of
some studies is limited. Due to the characteristics of these
studies, double blinding was not achieved, resulting in a high

Y. Hu et al.

J Sport Health Sci 2025;14:101017

risk of bias of all studies. Moreover, most studies only used
CRF as a secondary outcome indicator, which lowered the
quality of the research evidence. This limitation challenges the
interpretation and generalization of the results. Secondly, only
2 studies included insomnia, anxiety, and depression as
outcome indicators, with one having a small sample size; this
likely lead to statistical insigniﬁcance and high heterogeneity
among these secondary outcome indicators and potentially
misrepresented the true effects of exercise on patients with
advanced lung cancer. Future RCTs should provide detailed
demographic data and exercise programs, conduct clinical
registration, prioritize CRF as the primary outcome indicator,
observe patient compliance, and include comprehensive
reports on the feasibility and safety of exercise.

5. Conclusion

The results of this study show that exercise can signiﬁcantly
improve CRF in patients with advanced lung cancer. It is safe,
feasible, and the effectiveness of the intervention is closely
related to various factors. Exercise can also alleviate common
complications associated with CRF and enhance patients’
quality of life. In clinical practice, when using exercise to
manage CRF in patients with advanced lung cancer, doctors
should tailor exercise prescriptions based on the patient.
Further large, multicenter, high-quality RCTs are needed to
evaluate optimal intervention strategies and effects of exercise
on CRF in patients with advanced lung cancer.
