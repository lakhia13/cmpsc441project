Abstract

Evidence supports the antidepressant effects of resistance exercise training (RET); however, 
findings among young adults at-risk for elevated depressive symptoms are limited. This 
randomized controlled trial examined the effects of eight weeks of ecologically-valid, guidelines-
based RET, compared to a wait-list control, on depressive symptoms among 55 young adults 
(26±5y; 36 female) with and without subclinical, or analogue, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
(AGAD; Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire GAD subscale ≥6 and Penn State 
Worry Questionnaire ≥45) and Major Depressive Disorder (AMDD). Following a three-week 
familiarization period, participants completed one-on-one, twice-weekly RET sessions. The 16-
item, self-reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) assessed depressive 
symptoms. RM-ANCOVAs examined between-group differences, and significant interactions 
were decomposed with simple effects analysis. Hedges’ d effect sizes (95%CI) quantified 
the magnitude of differences in change between groups across time. Stratified analyses were

conducted among subsamples with AMDD and AGAD. There were no baseline depressive 
symptom differences between groups. Attendance was 83%, and compliance was 80%. RET 
induced statistically significant, clinically-meaningful, large-magnitude reductions in depressive 
symptoms from baseline to week eight in the total (d = 1.01; [95%CI: 0.44–1.57]), AMDD (d = 
1.71; [95%CI: 0.96–2.46]), and AGAD (d = 1.39; [95%CI: 0.55–2.24]) samples. These findings 
support guidelines-based RET as a promising treatment for mild depression.

Introduction

Depression has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 15.4% (Lim et al., 2018). It is 
characterized by symptoms including depressed mood, loss of interest and/or pleasure, 
poor concentration, and disturbed sleep or appetite (National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence 2022). Depression is associated with increased risk of suicide (Bernal et al., 
2007), all-cause mortality (Cuijpers and Smit, 2002), cardiovascular disease (Correll et al., 
2017), Alzheimer’s disease (Green et al., 2003), social dysfunction (Fombonne et al., 2001), 
and a major economic burden, costing approximately €118 billion per annum in Europe 
(Sobocki et al., 2006). Approximately 55% of people with depression receive contact with 
primary care or specialist services, of which only 32% receive adequate treatment (Andrews 
et al., 2000). First-line depression treatments include medication and psychotherapy. The 
effectiveness of antidepressant medications increase with greater depression severity, but 
these medications have minimal effectiveness for mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms 
(Cohen’s d = 0.11; number needed to treat (NNT)=16) (Fournier et al., 2010). Negative 
side-effects of antidepressant medications can also cause poor treatment adherence and low 
tolerability (Wang et al., 2018). Psychotherapy, while effective (Cuijpers et al., 2020), can 
also be expensive and inaccessible. Consequently, alternative and augmentative treatments, 
such as exercise training, are needed for depression.

The antidepressant effects of exercise are well-documented (Herring et al., 2012; Schuch 
et al., 2016), and are underpinned by several biologically plausible mechanisms. These 
mechanisms include improved regulation of the monoaminergic system (Dishman et 
al., 2006) and stress-response (Sheline et al., 2003; Duman, 2004), reductions in 
inflammatory markers (Olson et al., 2007), and increased IGF-1 (Cassilhas et al., 2010). 
The overwhelming majority of interventions that have examined the effects of exercise on 
depressive symptoms have used aerobic exercise training (AET). The promising effects of 
resistance exercise training (RET) on depressive symptoms remain understudied (Garber 
et al., 2011; Cooney et al., 2013; Netz, 2017). Recent meta-analytic evidence showed that 
RET significantly reduces depressive symptoms among otherwise healthy (mean effect size 
delta (Δ)=0.81) and mentally-ill adults (Δ=1.00) ( Gordon et al., 2018). Only three trials 
focused on young adults (d = 0.52 to 1.48) (Doyne et al., 1987; Herring et al., 2011; 
Vizza et al., 2016), all of which included participants with baseline depressive symptoms

indicative of at least mild depression. One trial examined depressive symptom changes 
among participants with clinically-meaningful anxiety (d = 0.52) (Herring et al., 2011). 
This lack of research among young adults, and those with clinically-meaningful anxiety, are 
intertwined limitations of the available evidence.

Depressive disorders typically develop later in adulthood. However, the median age of onset 
has progressively declined (Kessler et al., 2003), and approximately 36.9% of cases first 
develop before 25 years of age (Solmi et al., 2022). Additionally, GAD typically develops in 
young adulthood (Baxter et al., 2013, 2014), and is highly comorbid with Major Depressive 
Disorder (MDD) (Lieb et al., 2005), suggesting that young adults with clinically-meaningful 
anxiety may be at-risk for elevated or clinically-meaningful depressive symptoms. The 
frequent comorbidity of depression and anxiety, and lack of evidence of the effects of RET, 
warrants a greater focus on these populations.

Heterogeneity of the design and protocols of RET interventions is another limitation that 
potentially limits the widespread prescription of RET as a therapy for depression. The 
World Health Organization (WHO) and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 
muscle-strengthening guidelines provide a widely implementable, ecologically-valid RET 
option. The WHO recommends engaging in muscle-strengthening activities involving major 
muscle groups on two or more days per week (WHO, 2011). More detailed guidelines from 
ACSM recommend progressive strength training on two to three days per week, with 2–3 
sets of 8–12 repetitions for muscle strength benefits among individuals with limited or no 
RET experience (ACSM, 2019). RET designed in accordance with ACSM guidelines has 
demonstrated anxiolytic effects among young adults with (d = 0.71) (Gordon et al., 2021) 
and without (d = 0.85) (Gordon et al., 2020b) clinically-meaningful anxiety.

Therefore, this secondary analysis of existing randomized controlled trial (RCT) data 
extends past reports by quantifying the effects of ecologically-valid, guidelines-based RET 
on depressive symptoms among young adults with and without subclinical, or analogue, 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (AGAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (AMDD).

2.  Methods

This pilot efficacy trial adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
(CONSORT) Checklist (Schulz et al., 2010).

2.1.  Trial design

Secondary analyses of existing data from two parallel, eight-week RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier: NCT04116944) were completed; the full methods (Gordon et al., 2020a) 
and primary outcomes (Gordon et al., 2020b, 2021) are published. The research 
protocol was approved by the University’s Research Ethics Committee (EHSREC No: 
2017_03_18_EHS); all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation 
which was not compensated. This trial had rolling recruitment; data collection commenced 
in January 2018, and concluded in June 2019.

2.2.  Participants

Page 4

Participants were recruited via posters, emails, and word of mouth, and initially completed 
an electronic battery of questionnaires to establish eligibility; Fig. 1 presents a flowchart of 
participant recruitment (Gordon et al., 2020a).

Given that the primary outcome of these trials was AGAD symptoms, participants were not 
recruited based on depressive symptoms. At baseline, participants completed questionnaires 
including the 10-item GAD subscale of the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire 
(PDSQ-GAD) (Zimmerman and Mattia, 2001), 16-item Penn State Worry Questionnaire 
(PSWQ) (Meyer et al., 1990), and several other measures of signs and symptoms of GAD 
(e.g., depressive symptoms) (Rush et al., 2003). Participants were classified as either AGAD 
(PDSQ-GAD ≥6 and PSWQ ≥45) or non-AGAD, and were diverted to parallel, identical 
RCTs evaluating the effect of the same RET program on AGAD symptoms in young adults 
either with or without AGAD. Participants were then randomized, stratified by sex and 
AGAD status, to RET or a wait-list control using www.randomizer.org. This study includes 
pooled data from both RCTs (i.e., AGAD and non-AGAD).

Inclusion criteria for both RCTs were: i) age 18–40y; ii) no medical contra-indication 
to participation in RET; and iii) no current pregnancy or lactation. Participants were not 
excluded for currently or previously engaging in RET or physical activity at or before 
baseline. To account for RET-specific familiarity and baseline physical activity levels, 
participants were asked, in reference to the time at baseline assessment, how long they 
had been involved in a formalized RET program; this was determined in weeks and used to 
quantify participant training age. Although not an exclusion criterion, no participants were 
currently involved in RET. RET and wait-list participants in both RCTs were advised to 
maintain their current levels of physical activity throughout the trial. Participants were not 
excluded for receiving other treatments for any mental health disorder. Ten participants were 
currently receiving treatment for depression (pharmacotherapy-only (n = 8), psychotherapy-
only (n = 1), or both (n = 1)). No participants were receiving treatment for GAD. Four 
participants currently receiving treatment completed the trial (RET n = 2, wait-list n = 2); the 
other six withdrew (RET n = 2, wait-list n = 4).

This trial was originally powered to detect changes in anxiety and worry symptoms, 
which were the primary outcomes (Gordon et al., 2020a). Based on previous meta-analytic 
evidence of the small-to-moderate effect of RET on anxiety symptoms (Δ=0.31) ( Gordon 
et al., 2017), and the moderate-to-large effect of RET on depressive symptoms (Δ=0.66) 
(Gordon et al., 2018), a priori power analyses were conducted using G*Power 3.1. These 
analyses indicated that for each parallel arm, sample sizes of 24 (12 per group) would 
provide >80% statistical power (two-tailed α=0.05, four repeated measures) to detect a 
small-to-moderate effect of RET on anxiety symptoms, and a slightly lower than anticipated 
(i.e., more conservative) small-to-moderate effect of RET on depressive symptoms.

2.3.  RET intervention

RET was designed in accordance with WHO and ACSM guidelines (WHO, 2011; ACSM, 
2019). The eight-week, twice-weekly intervention increased resistance progressively, such

that the participant could complete two sets of between 8 and 12 repetitions before a 
deterioration in lifting form, or failure to complete a repetition. The investigator specified 
the resistance in accordance with guidelines rather than self-selection by participants. Load 
progressions were small and gradual. When participants completed two sets of 12 repetitions 
on an exercise, load was increased by 5% in the following session. When participants 
failed to complete two sets of at least 8 repetitions on an exercise, load was decreased by 
5% in the following session. The eight exercises were barbell back squat, barbell bench 
press, hexagon bar deadlift, seated dumbbell shoulder lateral raise, barbell bent over rows, 
dumbbell lunges, seated dumbbell curls, and abdominal crunches. After baseline assessment, 
participants randomized to RET completed a three-week, twice-weekly familiarization 
process to ensure safety, correct lifting technique, and that the intervention was delivered 
at the correct resistance, starting at week one. Exercise sessions lasted approximately 25 min 
and were fully supervised on a one-to-one basis in a small, private, university-owned RET 
facility. All investigators were fully trained in delivering the exercise protocol consistently 
and identifying proper and improper lifting mechanics. Prior to RET sessions, participants 
completed primary and secondary outcome questionnaires in the RET facility. Further 
specifics of the RET intervention have been published previously (Gordon et al., 2020a).

2.4.  Control condition

Participants randomized to the wait-list condition completed online questionnaires weekly, 
and were subsequently offered the RET intervention upon completion of their wait-list 
condition, but no data were collected.

2.5.  Primary outcome

The primary outcome for this analysis was depressive symptom severity among the 
total sample. The 16-item self-report version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (QIDS) (Rush et al., 2003) was used to assess depressive symptom 
severity at baseline, week one, four, and eight; symptoms were measured before the RET 
sessions. The QIDS has previously shown strong internal consistency (a = 0.86), and is 
a treatment-sensitive measure of depressive symptom severity (Trivedi et al., 2004). The 
internal consistency of the QIDS for the total sample was a = 0.77 (95%CI: 0.66 to 0.85). 
Correlations between repeated measures at baseline and week one were r = 0.67 (p<0.001) 
and r = 0.87 (p<0.001) for the RET and wait-list groups, respectively.

2.6.  Covariates

Baseline physical activity was assessed using an online, self-report version of a seven-day 
Physical Activity Recall (Blair et al., 1985). Participants reported time engaged in sleep, and 
moderate, hard, and very hard activities during the prior week. Estimated energy expenditure 
was calculated as kilocalories per week. According to thresholds validated by Dishman and 
Steinhardt (1988) among young adult university samples, participants can be considered 
inactive (<245 kcal·kg−1·wk−1) to highly active (≥280 kcal·kg−1·wk−1).

2.7. 

Intervention fidelity and manipulation check

To calculate attendance percentage, the number of RET sessions attended was divided by 
16 (two sessions per week for eight weeks) and multiplied by 100. To calculate compliance 
to the RET protocol, the number of sets in which at least eight repetitions were completed 
was divided by the total number of sets prescribed across the eight weeks (n = 256) and 
multiplied by 100.

To facilitate setting of the initial load, and to quantify anticipated changes in strength as a 
manipulation check, participants completed a five-repetition maximum (5RM) assessment 
for the barbell bench press, barbell back squat, and hexagon bar deadlift at baseline 
and postintervention. Total strength changes were measured as load changes on all three 
5RM lifts combined. During the six familiarization sessions, participants completed two 
familiarizations with the 5RM process, and one maximal 5RM assessment.

2.8.  Statistical analyses

Data analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0. Four percent of data were missing from 
the QIDS. Missing data were imputed for nine participants: sex and time-variant responses 
for each variable were entered as predictors into separate multiple linear regression models 
for condition, and predicted values were retained. Participants (n = 44) were excluded if 
they were missing primary outcome data for more than one time-point. These participants 
were predominately those who withdrew following randomization, but prior to completing 
any exercise or waitlist control condition protocol. Intention-to-treat analyses included all 
participants, and analyses of complete-cases only are reported as sensitivity analyses.

Independent samples t-tests examined baseline differences between conditions and sexes. 
The magnitudes of baseline differences were quantified using Cohen’s d effect sizes 
(Rosenthal et al., 1994). A two-group (RET/wait-list) x four time-point (baseline/week one/
week four/week eight) repeated measures ANCOVA examined differences between RET and 
wait-list; age, sex, and baseline physical activity were covariates. A two-sex x two-group 
x four time-point repeated measures ANCOVA, adjusted for baseline physical activity, 
examined potential sex-related differences in the effects of RET compared to wait-list. 
The Huynh-Feldt adjustment was applied when the assumption of sphericity was violated. 
Significant interactions were decomposed using simple effects analyses. Standardized mean 
differences (SMD) quantified the magnitude of within-condition change. The magnitude of 
difference in outcome change between groups was quantified by Hedges’ d effect sizes by 
subtracting the mean change in the wait-list from the mean change in the RET condition 
and dividing this difference by the pooled standard deviation of baseline scores (Hedges and 
Olkin, 1985); effect sizes were adjusted for small sample size bias and calculated such that 
larger depressive symptom reductions among RET compared to wait-list resulted in positive 
effect sizes. Changes in strength were examined using paired-samples t-tests. Associations 
between changes in strength and changes in depressive symptoms were quantified using 
Pearson correlation coefficients of associations between change scores. Sub-analyses were 
performed for four subsamples: young adults with AGAD, without AGAD, with AMDD 
(QIDS ≥ 6), and without AMDD (QIDS ≤ 5).

3.  Results

Page 7

Tables 1 and 2 present baseline participant characteristics and changes in depressive 
symptoms across the trial, respectively, for the total sample and each subsample. There 
were no baseline differences between groups for any outcomes, supporting successful 
randomization; there were also no baseline differences between sexes for any outcomes 
(all p>0.14).

3.1. 

Intervention fidelity and manipulation check

The average attendance to the RET intervention was 83% (13 out of 16 sessions). The 
average compliance with RET was 80% (205 out of 256 sets). As previously reported, 
these attendance and compliance rates indicated that participants missed approximately 
three sessions over the course of the eight-week intervention, and were almost fully 
compliant when they attended. No adverse events arose from trial participation; however, 
one participant randomized to RET reported a headache during an exercise bout. The 
investigator supervising the bout immediately stopped the session, and the participant 
subsequently withdrew from the trial after consulting with a physician. The average 6–20 
rating of perceived exertion was 14±1 (i.e., between somewhat hard and hard), and the 
average muscle soreness was 4 ± 2 (i.e., between mild and some soreness present) (Heath, 
1998). As anticipated, participants in the RET intervention significantly increased their total 
strength (t(20)=−9.2, p<0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.01[95%CI: 1.25 to 2.75]), mean increase: 
23.4%±13.2).

3.2.  Depressive symptoms among the total sample

Table 2 presents descriptives, SMDs, and Hedges’ d [95%CI] effect sizes for changes in 
depressive symptoms from baseline. Results for males and females are reported in Table 1 in 
the Supplementary Materials.

At baseline, depressive symptom scores for the total sample were indicative of mild 
depression (QIDS: RET: 8.7; wait-list: 8.0; 6–10=mild depression). Among the total 
sample, no significant sex X group X time interaction was found for depressive 
symptoms (F(2.3,114)=0.942, p = 0.403). A significant group X time interaction was found 
(F(2.3,113)=10.18, p<0.001, d = 1.01[0.44 to 1.57]), such that RET significantly reduced 
depressive symptoms from baseline to week eight compared to the wait-list control (mean 
difference [Mdiff]=−5.82, p<0.001). When examining raw changes, depressive symptoms 
reduced among 39 participants (RET=24; wait-list=15) from baseline to week eight; 
symptoms increased (i.e., worsened) among eight participants (RET=2; wait-list=6), of 
which three transitioned from non-AMDD to AMDD (RET=2; wait-list=1), and did not 
change among eight wait-list participants. Findings were materially the same for intention-
to-treat analyses (d = 0.88[0.45 to 1.31]) and analyses of complete cases only (d = 0.89[0.28 
to 1.50]). Changes in strength were not significantly associated with changes in depressive 
symptoms (r(21)=−0.12, p ≥ 0.62).

3.3.  Depressive symptoms and remission among AMDD, AGAD, and non-AGAD 
subsamples

Results for dichotomized subsamples (e.g., AMDD without AGAD) are reported in Table 2 
in the supplementary materials. As would be expected, given the comorbidity of GAD and 
MDD, there is comorbidity in the current sample such that some participants were classified 
(and thus included in analyses) for both AGAD and AMDD.

Baseline depressive symptoms among the AMDD and AGAD samples were indicative 
of moderate depression (all QIDS>10). Among the AMDD sample, a significant group 
X time interaction was found for depressive symptoms (F(2.5,80)=10.72, p<0.001, d = 
1.71[0.96 to 2.46]). RET significantly reduced depressive symptoms from baseline to week 
eight compared to the wait-list control ([Mdiff]=−7.73, p<0.001). RET reduced depressive 
symptoms among every member of the AMDD sample; 18 of the 19 (95%) RET participants 
remitted (QIDS<6) from AMDD by week eight. Among the wait-list (n = 18), 4 of 18 
participants (22%) remitted from AMDD by week eight; symptoms remained the same 
among four, increased among four, and reduced without remission among six (33%).

Significant group X time interactions were also found for depressive symptoms among 
young adults with (F(2.2,49)=5.81, p ≤ 0.004, d = 1.39 [0.54 to 2.23]) and without 
(F(2.7,62)=5.46, p = 0.003, d = 1.24[0.43 to 2.05]) AGAD. RET significantly reduced 
depressive symptoms from baseline to week eight among those with ([Mdiff]=−7.81, 
p<0.001) and without ([Mdiff]=−4.13, p<0.001) AGAD compared to the wait-list control. 
Of the 27 participants with AGAD, 24 had comorbid AMDD.

Table 3 presents Hedges’ d effect sizes (95%CIs) for changes in depressive symptoms across 
successive measurement time-points.

4.  Discussion

WHO and ACSM guidelines-based RET was an efficacious intervention for reducing 
depressive symptoms among young adults with limited RET experience. The efficacy of 
RET also appeared to be high among young adults with AGAD and AMDD, supporting 
RET as a promising treatment for mild or subclinical depression among young adults.

4.1.  RET among the total sample

Attendance of 83% and compliance of 80%, and the absence of adverse events occurring 
from RET, supports that the RET intervention, which was representative of common, real-
world RET practises, was feasible and tolerable. Further, a beneficial side-effect of RET 
was the large-magnitude increase in strength (d = 2.01); however, changes in strength 
were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms, and, consequently, RET that is 
programmed to improve strength may not be required for antidepressant benefits from RET 
among young adults with limited RET experience. Feasible, tolerable, and conservatively 
progressive RET that facilitates continuous engagement with RET activity may induce 
antidepressant benefits among young adults with limited RET experience.

Compared to a wait-list control group, RET significantly reduced depressive symptoms from 
baseline to week one (i.e., pre-post three-week familiarization protocol), and week four 
to week eight. Although reductions in depressive symptoms plateaued from week one to 
week four, the antidepressant effect of RET from baseline to week eight appeared larger 
than that of baseline to week four, and was materially the same among males (d = 1.11) 
and females (d = 0.89). Based on the threshold for clinical meaningfulness of at least 
half a standard deviation reduction from baseline scores (Norman et al., 2003), the large-
magnitude reduction in depressive symptoms from baseline to week eight (d = 1.01[0.44 to 
1.57]) is clinically meaningful. This antidepressant effect of RET is larger than previously 
reported findings for aerobic and resistance exercise (Δ=0.62) ( Cooney et al., 2013), and for 
RET among older (≥55 years) adults (Δ=0.72) ( Gordon et al., 2018), and comparable to that 
for mentally-ill adults (Δ=1.00) ( Gordon et al., 2018). It is also larger than antidepressant 
effects of RET found in two previous experimental studies of young adults (d = 0.52, 0.84) 
(Herring et al., 2011; Vizza et al., 2016), but smaller than effects found in another trial of 
clinically depressed young adults (Δ=1.48) ( Doyne et al., 1987). This is the third RET trial 
to report large-magnitude reductions in depressive symptoms among young adults, and the 
first to do so using ecologically-valid RET designed in accordance with WHO and ACSM 
guidelines.

The large-magnitude antidepressant effect found in this study supports RET as a promising 
treatment for mild or subclinical depression among young adults. This antidepressant 
effect is larger than those found for antidepressant medications, which have shown limited 
effectiveness for reducing mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (Cohen’s d = 0.11) 
(Fournier et al., 2010), and are unlikely to be used for preventing the onset of clinical 
depression. The increased likelihood of young people who endorse depressed mood later 
developing clinical depression (odds ratio=2.52) (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2014) increases 
the potential importance of this finding. RET may be a particularly effective intervention 
for preventing the onset of clinical depression among individuals lower on the depressive 
symptom severity spectrum, while concurrently improving aspects of physical health and 
function.

4.2.  RET among the AMDD and AGAD samples

The prevalent comorbidity of AMDD and AGAD in the current sample reflects the frequent 
comorbidity of GAD and MDD (Lieb et al., 2005). The current study is the first to 
investigate the antidepressant effects of ecologically valid, guidelines-based RET among 
young adults with clinically-meaningful symptoms of GAD, in whom depressive symptoms 
are frequently comorbid and may impact overall symptom severity, treatment compliance, 
and treatment response. RET induced large-magnitude, clinically-meaningful reductions in 
depressive symptoms from baseline to week eight among the AMDD and AGAD samples. 
Depressive symptoms among the AMDD and AGAD samples were similar to that of the 
total sample at week eight (QIDS: AMDD: 2.7; AGAD: 3.3; total: 2.8), and almost the 
entire AMDD sample (95%) remitted from AMDD. Consequently, RET reduced depressive 
symptoms among the AMDD and AGAD samples to the degree whereby those initially 
meeting criteria for AMDD no longer met those criteria by week eight.

The antidepressant effect of RET among the AMDD sample in this study is larger 
in magnitude than that of previous meta-analytic evidence for RET among participants 
with symptoms indicative of mild-to-moderate depression (Gordon et al., 2018). This 
antidepressant effect is also larger than those found in previous RCTs of young adults 
with major or minor depression (Doyne et al., 1987), and depressive symptoms indicative 
of mild-to-severe depression (Herring et al., 2011; Vizza et al., 2016). There are now 
four RCTs that have examined the effect of RET on depressive symptoms among young 
adults with either clinically-diagnosed depression, or symptoms indicative of at least mild 
depression. Three RCTs found large antidepressant effects (d = 0.84 to 1.71) using full-body 
RET among young adults with symptoms indicative of moderate-to-severe depression, while 
one found a moderate antidepressant effect (d = 0.52) using lower body RET among 
young adults with symptoms indicative of mild depression. Consequently, higher baseline 
depressive symptoms, using full-body RET, or both, potentially increase the effectiveness of 
RET for reducing depressive symptoms among young adults.

The antidepressant effect found among the AGAD sample is larger in magnitude than 
that of the only previous experimental trial to examine the effects of RET on depressive 
symptoms among young adults with clinically-meaningful anxiety (i.e., GAD) (Herring et 
al., 2011). Comorbidity is a fundamental characteristic of GAD, which is associated with 
an increased risk of depression (odds ratio=8.7) (Copeland et al., 2014). Such comorbidity 
among mental health disorders intensifies symptom severity, and makes treating both the 
primary and secondary disorder more difficult. The increased difficulty of treating comorbid 
mental health disorders adds significance to the reductions in both depressive and anxiety (d 
= 0.71) (Gordon et al., 2021) symptoms found among the AGAD sample in this RET trial. 
The large magnitude antidepressant effect of RET among those with AGAD suggests that 
RET may be a promising primary or adjunctive treatment for moderate depressive symptoms 
among young adults with clinically-meaningful anxiety, and little previous RET experience. 
The size of the large magnitude reductions in depressive symptoms among participants 
with AGAD (d = 1.39) could be due to their higher baseline depressive symptoms 
(QIDS: 11.4) (Gordon et al., 2018). There could also be a synergistic effect, whereby 
the simultaneous reductions in symptoms of GAD and depression augment each other, 
resulting in further symptom reductions. The overlapping aetiologies of GAD and MDD 
may explain these simultaneous antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Greater psychosocial 
and psychobiological benefits of RET among those with a greater anxiety symptom burden 
may have also contributed to the larger-magnitude antidepressant effect among the AGAD 
sample.

4.3.  Limitations and future research

Limitations of this study include the lack of an attention-control condition. Social 
interaction, attention, mastery experiences, and expectations for improvement, all of which 
cannot be controlled for with a non-active control group, may have contributed to the 
antidepressant effect found among the RET group. Still, the comparison to a non-active 
control gives a baseline indication of the efficacy of a RET intervention for reducing 
depressive symptoms. Future trials should use active attention-controls, such as minimal-
intensity exercise, to examine the antidepressant effect of RET while controlling for non-

exercise intervention components. Further, there were no post-intervention follow-ups in 
the current study; given the commonality of relapse following the cessation of treatment 
among patients with MDD (Ramana et al., 1995), long-term follow-ups are needed to 
examine whether depressive symptom reductions, and involvement in RET, are maintained. 
Future trials should also control for the use of contraceptive medications, due to their 
effects on reproductive hormonal balance. Inter-individual variation in depressive symptom 
responses to RET also remains unclear. As this was a pilot efficacy trial, though adequately 
powered, the sample size was small; future trials with larger sample sizes will allow for 
moderation and mediation analyses to examine such response variation. Using the QIDS 
as the diagnostic measure of depression status for the AMDD sample was also a potential 
limitation. The QIDS is primarily used to measure changes in symptoms across time, rather 
than diagnosing depression status. Future trials should use diagnostic questionnaires to 
diagnose depression status. The effect of RET on depressive symptoms among young adults 
with clinically-meaningful MDD with or without comorbid, clinically-meaningful GAD, 
remains unclear. Given the prevalence and additional burden of comorbid GAD and MDD, 
the associated increased treatment difficulty, and the potential synergistic effect, whereby 
simultaneous reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms following RET augment 
each other, continued evaluation of RET as a treatment for comorbid GAD and MDD is 
warranted.

5.  Conclusion

Eight weeks of ecologically-valid RET designed in accordance with WHO and ACSM 
guidelines resulted in clinically-meaningful, large-magnitude reductions in depressive 
symptoms among an otherwise healthy sample of young adults. Sub-analyses also revealed 
large anti-depressant effects among participants with AMDD and AGAD. There is a 
potential synergistic effect among those with AGAD, such that reductions in depressive 
and anxiety symptoms following RET augment each other. The large-magnitude increase 
in strength was a beneficial side-effect of RET, and was not associated with changes in 
depressive symptoms.
