Abstract

People  with  bipolar  disorder  frequently  experience  persistent  residual  symptoms,  problems  in  psychosocial  functioning, 
cognitive impairment, and poor quality of life. In the last decade, the treatment target in clinical and research settings has 
focused  not  only  on  clinical  remission,  but  also  on  functional  recovery  and,  more  lately,  in  personal  recovery,  taking  into 
account patients’ well-being and quality of life. Hence, the trend in psychiatry and psychology is to treat bipolar disorder in 
an integrative and holistic manner. This literature review offers an overview regarding psychosocial functioning in bipolar 
disorder. First, a brief summary is provided regarding the definition of psychosocial functioning and the tools to measure it. 
Then, the most reported variables influencing the functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder are listed. Thereafter, 
we include a section discussing therapies with proven efficacy at enhancing functional outcomes. Other possible therapies 
that could be useful to prevent functional decline and improve functioning are presented in another section. Finally, in the 
last part of this review, different interventions directed to improve patients’ well-being, quality of life, and personal recovery 
are briefly described.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a recurrent and chronic disorder char-
acterized  by  fluctuations  in  mood  state  and  energy  that  af-
fects around 2.4% of the global population (Merikangas et al., 
2011). As a lifelong and recurrent illness, BD is associated with 
functional  decline,  cognitive  impairment,  and  a  reduction  in 
quality of life (QoL) (Martínez-Arán et al., 2004; Michalak et al., 
2005; Bonnín et al., 2012). Given the complexity of this illness 
and its consequences, researchers and clinicians are not only 
focused  on  clinical  remission  but  also  functional  recovery 
and, more lately, well-being too (Vieta and Torrent, 2016). This 
emergent  paradigm  includes  not  only  symptom  recovery  but 

also return to normal functioning and attainment of a mean-
ingful life. In fact, in 1988, Dion and colleagues already pointed 
out  that  factors  other  than  symptoms  were  related  to  func-
tioning of patients with BD and that treatment should target 
symptom amelioration as well as reduce a patient’s disability 
(Dion et al., 1988). It is known that even after the first manic 
episode,  only  1  out  of  3  patients  regains  psychosocial  func-
tioning at 1 year follow-up (Tohen et al., 2000), suggesting that 
functional outcomes in BD are undoubtedly impaired from the 
very  beginning  and  should  become  a  priority  in  therapeutic 
interventions.

In the last decade, many efforts have been made to improve 
functioning and well-being in BD; hence, this review aims at pro-
viding  a  brief  overview  of  both  issues.  First,  the  definition  and 
how  to  measure  functioning  is  discussed. Then,  a  brief  review 
of  the  variables  influencing  psychosocial  functioning  is  per-
formed. The  following  sections  present  some  treatments  that 
have  proven  to  be  effective  at  enhancing  functional  outcomes 
and  other  promising  treatments  that  might  also  be  useful  at 
targeting  functional  impairment  and  prevent  functional  de-
cline. Finally, a brief overview of therapies directed to improve 
well-being and QoL is also presented.

Definition of Psychosocial Functioning and 
How to Measure It

Despite the importance of psychosocial functioning in BD there 
is  not  a  clear  consensus  regarding  its  definition.  In  the  Task 
Force  for  the  International  Society  for  Bipolar  Disorders  con-
ducted by Tohen and colleagues in 2009, different definitions of 
psychosocial functioning were examined but without reaching 
a  consensus.  The  experts  highlighted  the  definition  provided 
by  the  International  Classification  of  Functioning,  Disability 
and  Health  (ICF)  in  which  functioning  comprises  3  different 
components: body structures and functions; activities and par-
ticipation;  and  personal  environmental  factors.  Moreover,  the 
authors of these guidelines underlined that this construct was 
complex  to  measure  and  that  besides  the  ICF,  the  Functioning 
Assessment  Short Thest  (FAST)  scale  (Rosa  et  al.,  2007)  might 
also constitute a good approach to measure functioning (Tohen 
et al., 2009). Before these guidelines, there were other attempts 
to define psychosocial functioning. For instance, in 2000, Zarate 
and colleagues suggested the assessment of psychosocial func-
tioning should involve different behavioral domains such as the 
individuals’ ability to function socially or occupationally, to live 
independently, and to engage in a romantic life, with functional 
recovery  typically  being  defined  as  the  restoration  of  normal 
role  functioning  in  the  domains  under  scrutiny  (Zarate  et  al., 
2000). This definition represented a breakthrough in the field be-
cause in that moment, psychosocial functioning was measured 
by  means  of  the  Global  Assessment  Functioning  Scale  (GAF), 
endorsed by several consecutive editions of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM).  The  GAF  pro-
vides 1 single score without differentiating between the behav-
ioral domains pointed by Zarate and colleagues. Despite all, the 
GAF  is  still  the  most  commonly  used  clinician  rating  scale  to 
measure disability, at least in the United States (Von Korff et al., 
2011). In 2007, Rosa and colleagues developed a tool to measure 
functioning, the already mentioned FAST scale. It was specific-
ally  created  to  measure  the  most  common  difficulties  experi-
enced by patients with BD. The rationale behind this scale is in 
line with the definition of functioning proposed by Zarate and 
colleagues  in  2000,  mostly  focused  on  the  assessment  of  dif-
ferent  behavioral  domains.  More  specifically,  the  FAST  targets 
the  following  areas:  autonomy,  occupational  functioning,  cog-
nitive  functioning,  financial  issues,  interpersonal  functioning, 
and  leisure  time.  In  this  regard,  the  FAST  represented  several 
advantages  over  the  GAF,  mainly  that  it  assesses  different  be-
havioral  domains,  it  does  not  rate  the  symptomatology,  and  it 
is specific for BD.

functioning and disability irrespective of diagnosis; that is, it can 
reflect  difficulties  due  to  any  medical  or  psychiatric  illness.  In 
contrast, both the GAF and the FAST are limited to the impact of 
the psychiatric disease on functioning, excluding the medical or 
environmental limitations. The GAF, FAST, WHODAS 2.0, or ICF 
core sets specific for BD (Vieta et al., 2007; Ayuso-Mateos et al., 
2013)  are  clinical  tools,  either  rater  administered  (GAF,  FAST, 
ICF core sets) or self-administered (WHODAS 2.0), but other ap-
proaches exist. For instance, the UCSD Performance-based skills 
Assessment (UPSA) (Patterson et al., 2001) is based on task per-
formance and measures functional capacity, assessing the skills 
involved in community tasks such as comprehension and plan-
ning,  finance,  communication,  mobility,  and  house  manage-
ment. Figure 1 represents an overview of some different scales 
available to measure functioning in BD during the last 40 years, 
starting in 1980, when the GAF was first endorsed by the DSM-III 
until the present.

The scales presented in Figure 1 are just a little part of the big 
picture of the measurement of psychosocial functioning in BD. 
Nevertheless, it fairly represents the great variability that exists. 
It is likely that the way the researcher or clinician defines psy-
chosocial functioning will determine the tool to measure it, but 
the reverse is true as well: the use of one tool or another implies 
how the concept of psychosocial functioning is understood. To 
overcome  this  bias,  it  would  be  ideal  that  psychosocial  func-
tioning could be measured taking into account 3 different per-
spectives: (1) a subjective view using a self-administered scale, 
such  as  the  Sheehan  Disability  Scale  for  BD  (SDS)  (Arbuckle 
et al., 2009) or the WHODAS 2.0; (2) a semi-objective scale, using 
the FAST, GAF, or LIFE-RIFT (Leon et al., 1999), which are inter-
viewer rated based on patients’ answers; and finally (3) an ob-
jective  scale,  like  the  UPSA,  which  is  performance  based  and 
measures  functional  capacity.  Combining  these  3  different  ap-
proaches might help to disentangle all the variables associated 
with functional impairment observed in BD.

Variables Influencing Functional Outcome 
in BD

Many variables have been associated with functional outcome in 
BD, including demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive factors. 
The brief summary presented below includes findings reported 
in  some  studies  that  use  different  scales,  including  the  GAF, 
FAST, The  Multidimensional  Scale  of  Independent  Functioning 
(Berns et al., 2007), and SDS among others. As mentioned above, 
there is a great variability not only in the assessment of func-
tioning  but  also  in  the  variables  reported  to  influencing  it. 
Despite this, the next paragraphs are useful to reveal the mag-
nitude of the complex construct that researchers and clinicians 
are trying to predict.

Concerning  the  sociodemographic  factors,  it  seems  that 
male patients (Tohen et al., 1990; Sanchez-Moreno et al., 2018) as 
well as older patients (Sanchez-Moreno et al., 2018) show poorer 
functional  outcomes.  On  the  other  hand,  being  married  could 
represent  a  protective  factor  against  functional  impairment 
(Kupfer  et  al.,  2002; Wingo  et  al.,  2010).  Higher  socioeconomic 
status,  based  on  education  and  employment,  has  also  been 
associated  with  better  functional  outcomes  (Keck  et  al.,  1998; 
Wingo et al., 2010).

Currently,  the  DSM-5  no  longer  encourages  the  use  of  the 
GAF. Instead, the use of the World Health Organization Disability 
Assessment  Schedule  2.0  (WHODAS  2.0)  (Üstün  et  al.,  2010)  is 
recommended.  The  WHODAS  2.0  allows  the  assessment  of 

Regarding the clinical variables, the presence of subsyndromal 
depressive  symptoms  has  been  consistently  reported  as 
the  strongest  factor  associated  with  functional  impairment 
(Tohen  et  al.,  1990;  Bonnín  et  al.,  2010,  2012;  Gitlin  et  al.,  2011;

Gutiérrez-Rojas  et  al.,  2011; Reinares  et  al.,  2013; Samalin  et  al., 
2016; Murru et al., 2018). Other clinical variables include history of 
psychosis, episode density, poor sleep quality, and longer illness 
duration (Huxley and Baldessarini, 2007; Sanchez-Moreno et al., 
2009a, 2010; Reinares et al., 2013; Etain et al., 2017; Murru et al., 
2018).  Psychiatric  comorbidity,  particularly  with  substance  use 
disorder  (e.g.,  cannabis,  alcohol)  and  personality  disorders,  can 
also  negatively  influence  functional  outcomes  in  patients  with 
BD  (Sánchez-Moreno  et  al.,  2009b;  Leen  et  al.,  2013;  Icick  et  al., 
2017; Kizilkurt et al., 2018; Williams and Simms, 2018).

Finally,  regarding  neurocognitive  variables,  verbal  memory 
has been found to be a good predictor of functional outcome in 
several  studies  (Martinez-Aran  et  al.,  2007;  Bonnín  et  al.,  2010, 
2014,  Torres  et  al.,  2011;  Jiménez-López  et  al.,  2018),  However, 
variables  related  to  other  neurocognitive  areas  have  also  been 
reported,  including  executive  functions,  processing  speed,  and 
attention (Jaeger et al., 2007; Mur et al., 2009; Wingo et al., 2010). 
It  might  be  hypothesized  that  the  neurocognitive  variables 
influencing  functional  outcome  in  BD  may  vary  depending  on 
illness progression. For instance, patients in early stages of the 
disease seem to present a more selective profile of cognitive im-
pairment, with some domains capable of improving 1 year after 
the first manic episode, including improvements in processing 
speed and executive functions (Torres et al., 2014). In this line, 
at  least  2  studies  have  found  that  first-episode  patients  who 
did  not  relapse  during  1-year  follow-up  could  improve  their 
neurocognitive functioning (Kozicky et al., 2014; Demmo et al., 
2018);  hence,  preserving  neurocognition  from  the  very  begin-
ning of the illness might guarantee better functional outcomes.

Restoring Psychosocial Functioning: 
Therapies That Have Improved Functional 
Outcome

Pharmacological Interventions

Research  on  pharmacological  and  nonpharmacological  treat-
ments  to  restore  functioning  in  BD  is  still  immature.  As 

previously  mentioned,  the  link  between  functional  outcomes 
and  neurocognition  is  well  recognized,  which  is  why  in  recent 
years  many  efforts  have  improved  cognition,  including  both 
pharmacological  and  psychological  treatments.  In  fact,  new 
trends  in  pharmacological  treatments  include  focusing  on  re-
storing  cognitive  functioning  rather  than  psychosocial  func-
tioning.  Among  the  most  promising  medical  treatments  to 
improve cognition in BD are mifepristone (Watson et al., 2012), 
lurasidone (Yatham et al., 2017), and erythropoietin (Miskowiak 
et  al.,  2014,  2015).  Given  the  link  between  neurocognition  and 
psychosocial functioning, it is likely that the efforts directed to 
improve neurocognition will also improve functional outcome; 
however, so far, no studies on pharmacological treatments have 
addressed both issues at the same time. It is worth mentioning 
that  the  methodological  recommendations  for  cognition  trials 
by  the  Cognition  Task  Force  from  the  International  Society 
for  Bipolar  Disorders  encourage  the  inclusion  of  a  functional 
measure  as  a  key  secondary  outcome  (Miskowiak  et  al.,  2017). 
In  this  regard,  a  tool  to  measure  functional  improvement  that 
allows  the  researchers  and  clinicians  to  classify  patients  into 
different  categories  of  functional  performance  could  be  useful 
to assess the efficacy of these treatments (Bonnín et al., 2018a).

Psychological Therapies

In  contrast  to  the  area  of  pharmacological  treatments,  in  the 
field  of  psychological  interventions  several  efforts  have  been 
made  lately  to  design  therapies  to  restore  psychosocial  func-
tioning in BD. The first attempt was an open trial using a pro-
gram named Cognitive Rehabilitation (Deckersbach et al., 2010). 
The authors included a total of 18 patients with subsyndromal 
depressive symptoms and after 14 session of cognitive rehabili-
tation, patients improved cognitive performance and functional 
outcome. More interestingly, the findings showed that changes 
in executive function accounted, in part, for the improvements 
in  occupational  functioning.  The  first  randomized  controlled 
trial  (RCT)  implementing  a  similar  therapy  was  conducted  in 
2013  by  Torrent  and  colleagues  (Torrent  et  al.,  2013).  The  ef-
ficacy  of  functional  remediation  (FR)  was  proved  in  terms  of 

470

improving functional outcomes in euthymic patients with mod-
erate  to  severe  functional  impairment  at  baseline.  Moreover, 
improvement in psychosocial functioning was maintained after 
6 months’ follow-up (Bonnin et al., 2016). However, the impact 
of  the  intervention  was  low  in  terms  of  cognition.  Contrary  to 
others  therapies  labeled  as “cognitive  remediation,”  FR  is  spe-
cially centered on functional recovery, focusing on the training 
of  neurocognitive  skills  that  are  useful  for  daily  functioning. 
Hence,  this  approach  might  be  suitable  especially  for  patients 
in late stages of the illness and who present moderate to severe 
functional  impairment.  Another  preliminary  study  conducted 
in  the  Netherlands  included  12  patients  and  replicated  the 
positive results in functional outcome after receiving a shorter 
FR  program  (Zyto  et  al.,  2016).  However,  not  all  the  interven-
tions  targeting  cognitive  rehabilitation  were  found  to  improve 
functional  outcome.  For  instance,  another  RCT  conducted  by 
Demant and colleagues (2015) found no improvement on either 
cognition  or  functional  outcome  after  a  12-week  interven-
tion.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  these  negative  results  might 
be  explained  by  some  methodological  limitations  of  the  trial, 
including  the  length  of  the  intervention  (too  short)  or  the  fact 
that  patients  were  subsyndromic  at  study  enrolment. Another 
study  leaded  by  Lewandowski  and  colleagues  (2017)  assessed 
the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive remediation program 
in patients with BD compared with an active control group both 
in neurocognition and community functioning. After treatment, 
patients  who  received  the  internet-based  program  improved 
cognitive  performance  in  processing  speed,  visual  learning 
and  memory  domains,  and  the  composite  score. These  results 
were  maintained  over  6  months  after  finishing  the  interven-
tion; however, the intervention was not associated with change 
in  community  functioning,  although  cognitive  change  was  as-
sociated  with  functional  change  across  the  sample. There  are 
other ongoing trials targeting cognition including action-based 
cognitive remediation programs in which computerized training 
is combined with practical in-session activities and cognitively 
challenging  tasks  between  sessions. This  novel  approach  may 
have greater effect at enhancing functional outcomes than trad-
itional  cognitive  remediation  programs  (Bowie  et  al.,  2017;  Ott 
et al., 2018).

It  is  difficult  to  measure  the  power  of  these  current  ap-
proaches  in  changing  functioning,  since  very  few  studies  have 
used psychosocial functioning as a primary outcome. In this re-
gard, meta-analyses providing these data are urgently needed.

How to Prevent Functional Decline: 
Promising Therapies

So  far,  there  is  no  strong  evidence  regarding  the  prevention  of 
functional  decline  in  BD. The  following  section  includes  some 
targets  and  treatments  that  could  address  this  issue  and  de-
serve to be further explored.

Addressing Subthreshold Depressive Symptoms

A considerable portion of the patients with BD (more than 50%) 
experience  inter-episode  residual  depressive  symptoms  (De 
Dios et al., 2010; Gitlin et al., 1995), preventing them from living 
to the fullest. In this regard, subthreshold depressive symptoms 
together  with  neurocognitive  impairment  might  be  one  of  the 
strongest predictors of functional outcome (Bonnín et al., 2010, 
2012, 2014; Reinares et al., 2013; Martinez-Aran and Vieta, 2015; 
Samalin  et  al.,  2017).  However,  the  relationship  between  func-
tional  outcome  and  subthreshold  depressive  symptoms  might 

not  be  linear  and  unidirectional;  instead,  they  seem  to  influ-
ence  one  another  (Gitlin  and  Miklowitz,  2017;  Weinstock  and 
Miller,  2008).  Besides  the  implications  in  functional  outcome, 
residual depressive symptoms are also a major cause of relapse 
(Vieta  and  Garriga,  2016;  Radua  et  al.,  2017),  consequently  af-
fecting  psychosocial  functioning  and  QoL  (Bonnín  et  al.,  2012; 
Xiang et al., 2014). The treatment of residual depressive symp-
toms during euthymia is an unmet need, but fortunately, clin-
ical research has begun to investigate how to tackle them. One 
recent RCT proved that adjunctive extended-release quetiapine 
at a dose of 300 mg daily was significantly more effective than 
placebo in the treatment of subthreshold depressive symptoms 
(Garriga  et  al.,  2017),  but  no  significant  improvement  was  de-
tected in functional outcome. One possible explanation is that 
the  sample  size  was  not  powered  enough  to  detect  significant 
changes in this secondary outcome.

Regarding  psychological  interventions,  a  limited  number 
of  therapies  have  addressed  subthreshold  depressive  symp-
toms  as  a  primary  outcome.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge, 
only one pilot RCT study assessed the effect of Eye Movement 
Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy on this type of symp-
tomatology. Specifically, patients in the treatment group showed 
a statistically significant improvement in depressive and hypo-
manic  symptoms  when  compared  with  treatment  as  usual  at 
12-month  follow-up;  however,  psychosocial  functioning  was 
not  assessed  (Novo  et  al.,  2014).  Another  multicenter  study  of 
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing with a bigger 
sample  is  underway  with  the  objective  to  reduce  symptoms 
and  relapses  and  improve  psychosocial  functioning  (Moreno-
Alcázar et al., 2017). Regarding FR, secondary analyses showed 
that patients with subsyndromal symptoms could also improve 
psychosocial  functioning  after  the  therapy  (Sanchez-Moreno 
et al., 2017).

Other  therapies  include  an  approach  testing  the  long-term 
efficacy  of  an  intervention  that  combined  cognitive  behavior 
therapy  (CBT)  and  psychoeducation,  which  has  also  been 
described  to  be  effective  in  terms  of  symptoms  and  social-
occupational  functioning  improvement  (González-Isasi  et  al., 
2014). Positive results in social functioning were also found with 
CBT (Lam et al., 2003). Inder and colleagues (2015) randomized 
a group of patients with BD to Interpersonal and Social Rhythm 
Therapy or specialist supportive care, and both groups improved 
in  depressive/manic  symptoms  and  social  functioning.  Finally, 
an  intensive  psychotherapy  (family-focused  treatment  [FFT], 
Interpersonal  and  Social  Rhythm Therapy,  or  CBT)  in  patients 
with BD during an acute depressive episode also showed bene-
ficial functional outcomes (Miklowitz et al., 2007a). Finally, posi-
tive results have also been reported on anxious and depressive 
symptoms using mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (Williams 
et al., 2008; Ives-Delipery et al., 2013; Perich et al., 2013).

Although more research is needed, it might be hypothesized 
that treating subthreshold depressive symptoms could be an in-
direct pathway to improve psychosocial functioning.

Enhancing Cognitive Reserve

Cognitive  reserve  (CR)  is  the  capacity  of  the  adult  brain  to  en-
dure  neuropathology,  minimizing  clinical  manifestations  and 
allowing a successful accomplishment of cognitive tasks (Stern, 
2009). Genetics determine, to some extent, CR; however, environ-
mental factors such as an active lifestyle, education, and brain 
stimulation  (mental  activities)  can  also  influence  it.  In  BD  the 
most common ways to measure CR include years of education, 
premorbid  Intelligence  Quotient,  and  leisure  activities.  So  far, 

no  interventions  have  tested  whether  improving  CR  enhances 
functioning,  but  some  studies  suggest  that  CR  is  a  good  pre-
dictor of both cognitive and psychosocial outcome in euthymic 
patients with BD (Anaya et al., 2012; Forcada et al., 2015). Further, 
it could also play an important role in patients with first psych-
otic episode since CR has shown to predict psychosocial func-
tioning  2  years  after  the  first  episode  (Amoretti  et  al.,  2016). 
Hence, given the role of CR both in chronic patients and at early 
stages, this might constitute an area to explore and enhance to 
prevent functional decline (Vieta, 2015). In this regard, there is 
another ongoing trial by Torrent and colleagues (NCT03722082) 
that aims to enhance CR in child, adolescent, and young adult 
offspring of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or BD; how-
ever, so far, no preliminary results are available. 

Diet and Physical Exercise

Nutrition  and  physical  exercise  play  a  critical  role  in  both  the 
mental  and  physical  health  of  patients  with  BD.  Physical  in-
activity and poor diet habits can contribute to obesity, diabetes, 
hypertension, and dyslipidemia, which, in turn, increase the risk 
for cardiovascular disease (Soreca et al., 2008). At any rate, these 
risk  factors  should  be  targeted  since  it  has  been  shown  that 
obesity can also impact cognitive functioning (Mora et al., 2017), 
and in turn, cognitive impairment could be a predictor of weight 
gain  (Bond  et  al.,  2017).  Hence,  it  seems  that  weight  increase 
and cognitive impairment can influence one another. Moreover, 
another study has found that increased body mass index (BMI) 
was associated with a more chronic course of the disease, longer 
duration of illness, and lower psychosocial functioning (Calkin 
et al., 2009). In line with this, Bond and colleagues (2010) found 
that those patients who suffered a clinically significant weight 
gain (defined as gaining ≥7% of baseline weight over 12 months) 
had  significantly  poorer  functional  outcomes  at  12-month 
follow-up,  and,  interestingly,  functional  impairment  was  inde-
pendent from current mood symptoms.

Poor  dietary  habits  and  a  sedentary  lifestyle  can  increase 
physical  and  psychiatric  morbidity,  worsen  psychosocial  and 
cognitive  functioning,  and  predict  a  poor  pharmacological  re-
sponse. That is why clinicians treating individuals with BD face 
a  dual  challenge  of  treating  not  only  patients’  brains  but  also 
their  bodies.  Interventions  targeting  healthy  habits  (including 
nutrition  and  exercise)  are  expected  to  benefit  patients  with 
BD. One RCT examined the effects of a 20-week CBT interven-
tion  (NEW  tx)  for  BD  consisting  of  3  modules:  nutrition,  exer-
cise, and wellness (Sylvia et al., 2013); patients who underwent 
the  treatment  showed  improvements  in  nutritional  habits, 
exercise, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning. Hence, 
this study provides preliminary evidence that improving nutri-
tion and promoting an active lifestyle is associated with func-
tional improvement and mood symptoms in patients with BD. 
Another previous study showed the efficacy of an intervention 
on healthy lifestyle, nutrition, and physical exercise on muscle 
mass index, particularly in women (Gillhoff et al., 2010). These 
lifestyle  interventions  are  promising  since  they  demonstrate 
that people with BD can engage and be successful in these types 
of  therapies.  Therapeutic  mechanisms  of  action  are  still  un-
known  but  might  include  different  pathways,  for  example,  by 
reducing  morbidity  (i.e.,  depressive  symptoms),  which  in  turn 
would  improve  functional  outcome  (Ernst  et  al.,  2006),  or  by 
enhancing  treatment  effects,  including  the  synergistic  effects 
of exercise in combination with other treatments. For instance, 
in schizophrenia there is some preliminary evidence suggesting 
that cognitive remediation efficacy can be enhanced by aerobic

exercise-induced BDNF upregulation (Nuechterlein et al., 2016; 
Campos et al., 2017).

Multicomponent Programs

One  advantage  of  this  type  of  intervention  is  to  tackle  different 
areas to be improved at the same time, hence, allowing a holistic 
treatment of patients, taking into account not only education on 
the  illness  but  also  how  to  improve  healthy  lifestyles  and  func-
tional outcomes. Following the premise that no single psychosocial 
intervention might be sufficient to address the morbidity, the func-
tional impairment and the consequences associated with severe 
mental illnesses (Kern et al., 2009), multicomponent programs, and 
care packages are being developed for patients with BD.

An example of this kind of treatment that has proven to be 
effective in BD is the Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention de-
veloped  by  Frank  and  colleagues  (2015).  More  specifically,  this 
program  consists  of  17  sessions  grouped  in  different  modules, 
including  psychoeducation,  training  to  improve  sleep/wake 
patterns  and  social  rhythm  regularity,  nutrition,  physical  ac-
tivity, and healthy habits (smoking cessation). Results from this 
study showed that patients who followed the intervention sig-
nificantly  reduce  their  BMI.  Moreover,  3  variables  (C-reactive 
protein, total cholesterol, and instability of total sleep time) con-
tributed to a combined moderator of faster decrease in BMI with 
Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention treatment.

Recently, the Bipolar Disorder and Depression Unit in Barcelona 
has developed an integrative approach consisting of therapeutic 
components  of  broader  programs  that  the  Barcelona  Bipolar 
Disorders  Program  had  previously  developed  and  whose  effect-
iveness had been proven separately, such as psychoeducation for 
patients  (Colom  et  al.,  2003),  psychoeducation  for  family  mem-
bers (Reinares et al., 2008), and FR (Torrent et al., 2013). In addition, 
an  important  emphasis  is  given  to  the  promotion  of  a  healthy 
lifestyle,  and  a  module  focused  on  mindfulness-based  cogni-
tive therapy has also been included. Therefore, some contents of 
psychoeducation for patients have been combined with a session 
for family members and complemented with aspects related to 
health  promotion,  mindfulness  training,  and  strategies  for  cog-
nitive  and  functional  enhancement,  always  as  adjunctive  to 
pharmacological treatment. This integrative approach combines 
the  main  components  of  different  treatments  to  cover  broader 
therapeutic objectives, to improve the prognosis of the disease in 
both clinical and functional aspects, as well as the well-being and 
QoL  of  those  who  suffer  from  BD  (Reinares,  Martínez-Arán  and 
Vieta, in press). Due to the characteristics of the intervention (12 
sessions of 90 minutes each), in case it shows its efficacy, it could 
be easily implemented in routine clinical care.

Personal Recovery: Well-being and QoL 

Subjective assessments and patient-reported outcomes are gaining 
ground in the field of BD (Morton et al., 2017; Bonnín et al., 2018b). 
As in psychosocial functioning, the problem with subjective meas-
ures is the variability in the definitions and in the instruments to 
assess the subjective experience of these patients (Morton et al., 
2017). It is common that terms such as QoL, well-being or life satis-
faction are used as synonyms and interchangeable terms (Morton 
et al., 2017). Moreover, the current lack of consensus between these 
construct  definitions  add  uncertainty  and  complication  to  select 
an  appropriate  instrument  to  measure  this  dimension.  Despite 
all, the subjective experience should always be taken into account 
since it can also impact on the course of the illness. Some studies 
indicate that the improvement in well-being provides a protective 

472

effect against recurrence (Keyes et al., 2010), and it has also been 
found that low levels in QoL are associated with an increase in oxi-
dative stress (Nunes et al., 2018). For this reason, it is important to 
evaluate not only objective outcomes (symptoms and functioning) 
but also to assess patients’ subjective experience, since they can 
provide valuable information and might be an essential part to en-
sure better outcomes in BD.

Pharmacological Interventions

Rajagopalan  et  al.  (2016)  tested  the  effects  of  lurasidone  as 
monotherapy  or  as  adjunctive  to  lithium/valproate  on  health-
related  QoL  (HRQoL). They  found  that  patients  in  both  condi-
tions  increased  HRQoL.  However,  this  improvement  was  not 
independent of changes in depression, indicating that the effect 
of lurasidone on improving patient HRQoL may act through a re-
duction in depressive symptoms associated with BD. Similarly, 
Gonda and colleagues (2016) found that patients enhanced both 
their work functional outcome and QoL after receiving prophy-
lactic  lamotrigine  therapy  at  6-months  follow-up.  In  young 
patients (10–17 years old) with an acute episode of bipolar de-
pression,  it  was  found  that  those  who  received  olanzapine/
fluoxetine  combination  presented  better  QoL  scores  compared 
with those receiving placebo (Walker et al., 2017).

Psychological Interventions

Even  though  physical  activity  is  not  a  psychological  interven-
tion  itself,  it  is  well-known  for  increasing  well-being  and  QoL; 
however, the impact of this kind of interventions has been less 
studied  in  the  field  of  BD.  Vancampfort  and  colleagues  (2017) 
proved  the  effect  of  150  min/wk  of  physical  activity  on  phys-
ical,  psychological,  social,  and  environmental  QoL;  those  pa-
tients who did not meet the established minimum (150 minutes) 
showed lower QoL outcomes.

Involving  the  family,  O’Donnell  and  colleagues  (2017)  tested 
the  effect  of  2  psychological  interventions  on  QoL  scores  in  a 
sample of adolescents with BD. They compared the efficacy of a 
FFTplus pharmacotherapy vs brief psychoeducation plus pharma-
cotherapy  on  self-related  QoL  over  2  years.  They  found  the  2 
groups did not differ in overall QoL scores at 24 months follow-up. 
However, adolescents who received the FFT had greater improve-
ments in quality of family relationships and physical well-being 
compared  with  the  brief  psychoeducation  program.  Besides, 
internet-based approaches using smartphones are gaining trac-
tion (Lauder et al., 2015; Hidalgo-Mazzei et al., 2018), representing 
a  useful  and  attractive  tool  especially  for  the  young  population 
with BD (Bauer et al., 2018). So far, some preliminary studies using 
a mobile application (SIMPLe) have reported an improvement of 
biological  rhythms  (Hidalgo-Mazzei  et  al.,  2017)  and  increased 
QoL and well-being (Hidalgo-Mazzei et al., 2018).

There  is  much  room  for  improvement  in  the  field  of  sub-
jective  well-being  and  QoL.  These  above-mentioned  inter-
ventions  may  shed  some  light  regarding  the  path  to  follow. 
Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that those patients 
who  suffer  from  more  depressive  symptoms,  irritability,  and 
psychiatric  comorbid  conditions  present  lower  QoL  and  func-
tional  outcomes  (IsHak  et  al.,  2012;  Sylvia  et  al.,  2017);  hence, 
all  the  strategies  directed  to  reduce  medical  and  psychiatric 
burdens  might  also  be  useful  to  increase  patients’  well-being 
and QoL. It is also worth mentioning that some authors defend 
that  QoL  depends  not  only  on  clinical  remission  but  also  re-
lies on functional recovery (Vieta and Torrent, 2016). In this line, 
poor QoL is also associated with poor occupational outcome, re-
duced academic attainment (Marwaha et al., 2013), and difficul-
ties in activities of daily life (Träger et al., 2017). Future studies 
should include subjective measures (such as QoL, well-being) to 
better understand the relationship with these clinical variables. 
Figure 2 represents a brief summary of the therapies and strat-
egies that have been presented in this review.

Conclusions

Because  the  construct  of  psychosocial  functioning  is  complex 
and difficult to measure, it is therefore recommended to assess 
it based on the combination of 3 different approaches: (1) a sub-
jective  assessment  that  involves  a  self-administered  measure 
(SDS, WHODAS 2.0, etc.), (2) a semi-objective measure including 
an  interviewer-rated  assessment  (FAST,  LIFE-RIFT,  GAF,  etc.), 
and  (3)  an  objective  assessment  based  on  performance-based 
measurements (i.e., UPSA). Taking into account these different 
approaches  might  help  to  better  disentangle  the  variables  as-
sociated  with  the  functional  outcomes  in  BD,  which  are  often 
heterogeneous  and  influenced  by  demographic,  clinical,  and 
neurocognitive factors.

Regardless of the great variability in the assessment of psy-
chosocial functioning, many efforts have successfully improved 
functional  outcomes  in  BD.  But  where  are  we  now?  At  the 
present  moment,  the  interventions  that  have  proven  to  be  ef-
fective at enhancing functioning and/or QoL include lurasidone, 
lamotrigine, FR, some programs of cognitive remediation, ISPRT, 
FFT,  and  NEW  tx,  among  others. These  therapies  have  set  the 
stage  for  developing  further  interventions  to  prevent  func-
tional decline and ensure well-being, because this is where we 
go. Ideally, future therapies should focus not only on restoring 
functional outcomes but also preventing functional decline and 
enhancing  QoL  and  well-being.  In  this  regard,  those  programs 
that  target  cognitive  enhancement  and  promote  healthy  life-
styles  (including  healthy  nutrition  patterns  and  physical  ac-
tivity)  are  urgently  needed,  since  they  constitute  a  preventive 
tool for cognitive and functional decline. Although more studies 
are still needed, multicomponent therapies might be also a good 
option since they include different approaches to cover several 
areas  at  a  time  (symptoms,  functioning,  cognition,  well-being, 
etc.). Finally, it is likely that the future will also include person-
alized  treatments  focusing  on  tailored  interventions  that  may 
differ from one patient to another (Salagre et al., 2018); in this 
sense, the type and duration of interventions might differ from 
patients recently diagnosed and patients with a complex course 
of the illness who might take advantage of restorative therapies 
such as cognitive and FR (Solé et al., 2017).
