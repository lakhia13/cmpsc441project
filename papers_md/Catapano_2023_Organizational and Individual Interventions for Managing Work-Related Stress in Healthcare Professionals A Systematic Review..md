Abstract: The workplace represents a relevant source of stress for workers, being a risk factor for
many mental disorders and psychological difﬁculties, including burn-out syndrome. Healthcare
workers and other help-professions are particularly susceptible to work-related stress. The present
systematic review aims to (1) identify available interventions for managing workplace-related stress
symptoms; (2) assess their efﬁcacy; and (3) discuss the current limitations of available interven-
tions. A systematic review has been conducted, searching on PubMed, APA PsycInfo, and Scopus
databases. Eighteen papers have been identiﬁed, which included different interventions for the
management of work-related stress in healthcare professionals. These approaches can be grouped
as follows: (1) interventions focusing on the individual level using cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT) approaches; (2) interventions focusing on the individual level using relaxation techniques;
and (3) interventions focusing on the organizational level. As regards interventions targeting the
individual level using CBT approaches, mindfulness-based interventions were effective in reducing
levels of burn-out, stress, and anxiety and in improving quality of life. As regards intervention
using relaxation techniques, including art therapy, Emotional Freedom Techniques (ECT) and brief
resilience retreats had a positive effect on the levels of anxiety, stress, and burnout. As regards inter-
ventions at the organizational level, we found no evidence for supporting its effectiveness in reducing
the levels of burnout. Furthermore, available studies are heterogeneous in terms of assessment tools,
target populations, and type of interventions, which limits the generalizability of ﬁndings.

1. Introduction

Work-related stress is a complex phenomenon, which has been deﬁned by the World
Health Organization as “the response people may have when presented with work de-
mands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which
challenge their ability to cope” [1]. Stress can affect workers in many different situations,
and it is due to a lack of support from supervisors and other colleagues or to having little
control over work processes [2]. The relationship between levels of stress and working
performance is bidirectional: perceived pressure can be useful to keep the individual alert,
motivated, able to work, and learn, but, when it exceeds a certain threshold—which varies
among individuals—becomes excessive or unmanageable, causing stress. Stress can nega-
tively inﬂuence employees’ health and their work performance. The workplace represents
a relevant source of stress for workers due to excessive workloads, moral violence, work
processes, interactions with patients’ families, professional and administrative demands,
resource constraints, and lack of management support [3]. Therefore, workplaces can play
a central role in the development of mental health problems—such as burn-out syndrome
or full-blown mental disorders, mainly anxiety or depressive disorders. Burnout syndrome

is composed of three dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,
and personal accomplishment [4]. The term “burnout” describes a physical and emotional
strain speciﬁcally occurring in the work environment. Burnout syndrome is also known as
chronic work-related stress syndrome [4–10].

As with other helping professions, healthcare workers are particularly susceptible
to work-related stress due to the demands of their everyday clinical practice and the
continuous exposure to patients’ suffering [11,12]. In particular, stress among healthcare
workers ranges from 27 to 87.4% and it signiﬁcantly affects their physical and mental
health, risk of substance use, work-related delays, absenteeism, and presenteeism, as well
as emigration rate [13]. Additionally, it can lead to patient safety concerns and poor quality
of care. The mismatch between job requirements and available resources, work overload,
working environment, work experience, workplace conﬂicts, gender discrimination, marital
status, educational status, job satisfaction, and not being rewarded properly are some of
the factors signiﬁcantly associated with occupational stress among healthcare professionals.
Moreover, an important element which can mediate the impact of job-related stress on
the mental health of healthcare professionals is represented by the sense of coherence
(SOC). This construct is deﬁned as the general orientation of seeing life as understandable,
manageable, and meaningful, and having the ability to cope with stressful situations.
A recent systematic review by Pablo González-Siles (2022) has pointed out that stress,
depression, burnout, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) negatively correlate with
SOC; in contrast, job satisfaction, well-being, and quality of life positively correlate with
SOC [14].

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced additional stressors,
such as staff redeployment and fear of infection [15]. During the pandemic, increased
levels of work-related stress and of burn-out symptoms have been reported by healthcare
professionals [16], due to the need to manage an unexpected public health emergency
without adequate knowledge and safety means [17–23]. According to EU-OSHA’s workers’
survey OSH Pulse—occupational safety and health in post-pandemic workplaces---almost
half of healthcare workers (44%) reported that their work stress had increased in particular
during the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic [24–29].

In the initial phase of the pandemic, levels of stress, anxiety symptoms, and sleep
difﬁculties increased in ﬁrst-line professionals [30–32]. Also, suicidal risk and suicidal
ideation initially increased [33], with a further worsening of the burden associated with
workplace stress [34–37]. Therefore, the need to develop supportive interventions for
promoting the mental health of healthcare workers has been advocated, and, actually,
many hospitals dealing with COVID-19 patients have established helplines or promoted
psychological help for all healthcare professionals in need of some support [38–40].

Work-related stress on mental health has been recognized as one of the most power-
ful stressful events for mental health by the World Health Organization and by several
international scientiﬁc associations, such as the World Psychiatric Association and the
European Psychiatric Association, who are committed to implement and disseminate strate-
gies and multilevel interventions for the prevention, early detection, and management of
work-related stress symptoms.

Interventions for work-related stress symptoms can be grouped into those focusing on
the individual level, using cognitive-behavioural techniques or relaxation approaches, and
those focusing on the organizational level [41].

The present systematic review aims to (1) identify available individual or organization-
level interventions for the management of workplace-related stress symptoms; (2) assess
their efﬁcacy; and (3) discuss the eventual limitations of the available interventions.

2. Methods
2.1. Search Strategy

An extensive literature search for relevant articles has been performed on PubMed,
APA PsycInfo, and Scopus databases entering the following terms: “Occupational Stress”
[Mesh] AND (“Anxiety” [Mesh] OR “Depression” [Mesh] OR “Stress, Physiological”
[Mesh]) AND (“Health Personnel” [Mesh] OR “Health Care Facilities, Manpower, and Ser-
vices” [Mesh]) AND (“prevention and control” [Subheading] OR prevention [Text Word]),
using “Abstract”, “Humans”, “English” as ﬁlters on Pubmed; (TITLE-ABS-KEY (occu-
pational AND stress AND (anxiety AND depression AND stress)) AND ((health AND
personnel) OR (health AND care AND facilities AND manpower AND services)) AND
(prevention) AND PUBYEAR > 2014 AND PUBYEAR < 2024AND (LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE,
“ar”)) AND (LIMIT-TO (LANGUAGE, “English”))), on Scopus; (abstract(occupational
stress) AND noft (anxiety) AND noft (depression) AND noft (stress) AND abstract (health
personnel) OR abstract(health care facility) OR abstract (health care facilities) AND noft
(prevention)) on APA PsycInfo.

The search method has been conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for

Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement, as applicable [42].

2.2. Selection Criteria

The literature search was limited to the period from 2015 up to May 2023, since studies
previously published are already covered in the review by Ruotsalainen et al. [41]. Only
papers written in English were included. The reference lists of included articles were
screened to identify additional relevant studies. The following inclusion criteria were used:
(1) studies involving medical doctors, nurses, health personnel or medical students, student
nurses or physicians in training; (2) studies describing interventions aiming to prevent or
reduce work-related stress; and (3) studies reporting occupational and work-related stress
or burnout levels as outcomes. Only studies reporting work-related stress evaluated at the
individual/personal level were included.

2.3. Selection Process

A total of 580 papers were identiﬁed, 14 papers were duplicates and were removed,
while the remaining (N = 548) were excluded because they were not relevant. Therefore,
N = 18 papers were evaluated in detail and included in the analysis (Figure 1).

SC and PC extracted the relevant data and synthetized them in a tabular format; GS

and FP triple-checked the extracted data for accuracy.

Inter-rater reliability, referring to the degree of agreement between researchers, has

been calculated, with a Cohen’s kappa score of 0.9.

2.4. Risk-of-Bias Assessment

Two authors (SC and PC) independently evaluated each selected study for the risk
of bias, using the criteria recommended for Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [43] and the recommended
tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomized studies of intervention (NRSI) called
ROBINS-I [44], p. 25.

The overall risk of bias was rated as moderate to high in all non-randomized studies
included in the review; Supplementary Table S1 shows the considered domains and sub-
domains. Two authors resolved disagreements through discussion or by involving a third
author (GS). Results of risk of bias assessment for the RCTs are reported in Supplementary
Table S2. One study was considered to be at a low risk of bias.

3. Results

Based on Ruotsalainen et al.’s seminal work [41], included studies have been grouped
in three categories: (1) studies focusing on the individual level using cognitive-behavioural
therapy approaches (Table 1); (2) studies focusing on the individual level using relaxation
techniques (Table 2); and (3) studies focusing on the organizational level (Table 3).

The most frequently used tools to assess burnout, work-related stress, its impact on
quality of life, and psychopathological and psychological symptoms were the Maslach
Burnout Inventory (MBI) for burnout (6 out of 18 studies) [45–50]; the Professional Qual-
ity of Life Scale (Pro-QOL) [51,52] and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWS) [46,49] for
quality of life; the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [46–48,53,54]; the State and Trait Anxiety
Inventory (STAI) [46,48,49,55,56]; the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale—Revised
(CAMS-R) [47,48]; and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS) [50,53] for the assessment of stress and clinical symptoms. The tools used in
each study, grouped by category, are reported in Table 4.

3.1. Studies Focusing on the Individual Level Using Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy or Other
Psychotherapeutic Approaches

A total of 11 studies (out of 18) were focused on reducing the individual levels of stress
and burn-out using CBT or other psychotherapeutic approaches (Table 1). Studies were
carried out mainly in the USA and Spain, with sample sizes ranging from 13 participants

in the study by dos Santos et al. [46] to 105 healthcare workers in Montaner et al. [49].
Included participants were mainly nurses (N = 8 studies) [44,45,48,51,53,56–58], other
healthcare workers (N = 4 studies) [49,57,59,60], physicians (N = 3 studies) [49,54,57],
and trainees in healthcare professions (N = 2 studies) [48,51]. Interventions provided to
participants included a cognitive-behavioural component, ranging from mindfulness-based
programmes [45,46,54,59,60] to informative interventions [48,51].

Many different assessment tools have been adopted for evaluating the levels of
burn-out and stress reported by professionals, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory
(MBI) [45,46,48,49], Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [46,48,54], Depression, anxiety, and stress
scale (DASS-21) [51,60], Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) [60], Distress Thermometer
Assessment (DTA) [45], The World Health Organization Health and Work Performance
Questionnaire (HPQ) [45], and Work Stress Scale (WSS) [46]. Tools for assessing quality of
life included the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) [51,52], Satisfaction With Life
Scale (SWLS) [46,49], EuroQol (EQ-5D) [45], General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) [57], and
WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) [46] (Table 4). Studies [46,54,59,60] conﬁrm
that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the short-term in reducing levels
of burn-out, stress, and anxiety and in improving quality of life. However, longitudinal
studies—such as those by dos Santos et al. and by Haghighinejad et al. [46,60]—showed
that the effect was not sustained at two/three months of follow-up. Furthermore, in two
RCTs [45,51] group stress management programs were not effective in reducing the levels of
burnout and work-related stress compared to the control group. No signiﬁcant differences
were found in other secondary outcomes, such as risk of depression and alcohol abuse.

In the study by Tarquinio et al. [58], carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic,
at-a-distance EMDR intervention provided to healthcare professionals previously treated
with the same in-person technique was effective in reducing the levels of stress, although
data on the long-term effectiveness are not available. Encouraging results were obtained
from clinical trials using humor-based training sessions, stress-resilience courses, and
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) [48,49,57]. On the other hand, the reduction
in secondary traumatic stress obtained by Sullivan throughout self-care practices was not
conﬁrmed at the 6-month follow-up [52].

3.2. Studies Focusing on the Reduction in the Levels of Stress and Burn-Out Using Relaxation
Techniques

Five studies, mainly from the US, were included, with sample sizes ranging from
34 to 106 participants [53,61], who were mainly nurses (N = 4 studies) [53,55,56,61],
trainees in healthcare professions (N = 3 studies) [53,61,62], and other healthcare workers
(N = 3 studies) [53,61,62] (Table 2). Only the study by Kaimal et al. [53] included family
caregivers. The interventions provided to participants shared relaxation techniques, such
as breathing sessions [55], art therapy [53], acupressure points stimulation [56], group
retreats [61], and nature and forest therapy [62].

Studies using art therapy, Emotional Freedom Tecniques (ECT), and brief resilience
retreats [53,56,61] had a positive effect on the levels of anxiety, stress, and burnout (Table 4).
However, these positive effects were not conﬁrmed by biological markers, such as the
salivary levels of IL-6, cortisol, and CRP [53]. Other relaxation practices, such as Shinrin-
Yoku [62] and Relaxation Response [55], did not yield any signiﬁcant effect.

3.3. Studies Focused on Organizational Level

Two studies, both carried out in the US, were included, with a total of 221 participants,
mainly physicians [50], residents, and clinical fellows [47], not all engaged in clinical ac-
tivities (Table 3). Lebares et al., who used a mixed-intervention program including the
application of mindfulness in association with organizational initiatives, found that the in-
tegrated intervention reduced negative emotions and improved workplace satisfaction [47].
However, the only RCT involving an organizational intervention found no evidence for
supporting its effectiveness in reducing levels of burnout [50].

Results suggest that a SRP involving mindfulness may be a potentially
effective approach to improve stress, depression, and QoL in a hospital
setting. Comparison between pre- and post-intervention revealed a
signiﬁcant reduction in scores for perceived stress-PSS (p = 0.001),
burnout-MBI (p = 0.02), depression-BDI (p = 0.007), and anxiety trait-STAI
(p = 0.049), and a signiﬁcant increase in scores for physical (p = 0.002) and
psychological (p = 0.007) domains of the quality-of-life scale. These values
remained stable six weeks after the intervention, except for the physical
and psychological domains of the QoL scale, which showed a signiﬁcant
decline at follow-up (p < 0.05).

There was a small but not statistically signiﬁcant reduction in alcohol use
(p = 0.23), depression (p = 0.49), and burnout (p = 0.83) in the intervention
group compared to the control group, measured at the primary endpoint at
6 months.

Integration of mindfulness-based interventions as part of staff meetings
decreased members’ physical and emotional stress-related symptoms and
increased members’ sense of calm. The distress scores were noted to
decrease in session 1 (p = 0.001) and in session 2 (p = 0.39). Breathing rate
also decreased during both sessions (p = 0.001).

training, it was observed a reduction of 10-5% of potential cases of minor
psychiatric disorder (from 62.1% to 51.7% using a 6-point cut-off in GHQ;
from 55.2% to 50% using a 7-point cut-off).

(p < 0.010). No differences between pre- and
post-intervention tests were found in the
control group.

There was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in
state anxiety scores following the retreat
(p < 0.001). Brief resilience retreats can reduce
perceived anxiety and facilitate engagement in
contemplative practices, which are associated
with a decrease in the risk of burnout.

The data from this randomized controlled trial did
not demonstrate a change in burnout symptoms
from participating in a single Shinrin-Yoku walk
when compared to baseline burnout scores or
when compared to a control group.

No statistically signiﬁcant differences
were seen in mean changes in
burnout scale scores, meaning, or
social support, although numeric
differences generally favored
the intervention.

Results reflected the potency of both
social support and affective regulation
skills in their ability to mitigate

4. Discussion

Work-related stress is a growing concern for healthcare professionals. In fact, more
than 20% of European workers report suffering from stress related to the workplace. More-
over, work-related stress has been associated with a number of negative health outcomes,
including cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders (particularly back problems),
and absenteeism. Work-related stress develops because a person is unable to cope with
work demands [63]. Factors causing work stress include poor communication or coop-
eration within the organization and lack of control over work pace or work processes.
Protective factors for reducing work-related stress have also recently been identiﬁed, in-
cluding resilience and sense of coherence (SOC). In particular, people reporting high levels
of SOC have an opinion on reality and their environment that is more comprehensive,
manageable, and meaningful [64].

Work-related stress can have a negative impact on the workers themselves, patients,
communities, and the general population at large. Furthermore, burnout and work-related
stress in healthcare professionals is associated with work-to-family conﬂict and unre-
alistic expectations of patients, which are factors that have been worsened during the
pandemic [65].

The selected articles highlight that high levels of work-related stress and burnout can
cause a signiﬁcant reduction in life and job satisfaction, worsening quality of life, and can
lead to the onset of psychiatric disorders such as depression. In fact, many authors use
assessment tools for quality of life, job satisfaction, and depressive symptoms to evaluate
the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work-related stress.

Therefore, the implementation and dissemination of preventive interventions for
work-related stress represents an urgent priority from a public health perspective [66–68].
Based on the present systematic review, different interventions are currently available
for addressing work-related stress in healthcare professionals. Studies included in this
review are very heterogeneous in terms of assessment tools, target populations, and types
of interventions, thus limiting the generalizability of the ﬁndings.

Among interventions focused on the individual level using CBT or other psychother-
apeutic approaches, our ﬁndings conﬁrm the effectiveness of mindfulness techniques in
reducing work-related stress [46,54,59,60], which was already shown in healthy adults and
children [69,70]. Speciﬁc features of mindfulness can be beneﬁcial for preventing stress
in the workplace: it can be easily practiced after a short training and it does not require
particular tools nor settings, and it is usually well accepted by participants. The appar-
ently conﬂicting data by Watanabe et al., could be due to the peculiarities of the speciﬁc
interventions (techniques, duration, environment) and the different study design [45].

The main limitations of the included interventions are related to the extreme hetero-
geneity and to the short-term evaluation of their effectiveness. Therefore, it should be
needed to promote further rigorous longitudinal studies, aiming to assess the preventive
and protective effects of these interventions in the long-term. Encouraging results in re-
ducing stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, as well as emotional exhaustion, are
seen with other psychotherapeutic approaches, such as ESRT, EMDR, and ACT [48,49,58].
Also, referring to these latter approaches, there is not a speciﬁc protocol of intervention
that is work-related stress oriented. Although CBT-based techniques may be useful in
mitigating stress and promoting coping and resilience, further research to investigate the
effects of SOC-strengthening interventions may be useful, since SOC has been shown to be
a work-related stress-speciﬁc protective factor. [64]

As regards relaxation techniques, a promising intervention carried out by Dincer and
Inangil utilizing Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) led to a signiﬁcant reduction in
stress, anxiety, and burnout levels [56]. EFT had already been shown to be effective in
reducing depressive symptoms [71] and in improving stress-related conditions such as
tension-type headaches [72]. Instead, Cunningham and Çayir, while reporting an efﬁcacy
in reducing the anxiety at group sessions of daylong resilience retreats, did not use any
validated tools but a self-produced questionnaire [61]. On the other hand, Kaimal et al.

Medicina 2023, 59, 1866

14 of 17

measured the effectiveness of art-based relaxation techniques in reducing stress, but these
data were not supported by changes in biomarkers, suggesting a potential placebo effect
and suggesting that further studies are needed [53]. Similarly, two RCTs [55,62] found a
small effectiveness for interventions based on relaxation techniques that seek to reduce and
prevent burnout. Overall, relaxation techniques can be considered effective in reducing
stress and can be easily applied in the workplace; in particular, they are simple techniques
that do not require special training conducted by qualiﬁed personnel, are cost-effective,
and can be repeated over time. On the other hand, the need to repeat the interventions
several times with the same people in the workplace could represent a limitation in itself.

Limitations

The present review has some limitations which must be acknowledged. First, the
search strategy has been limited to healthcare professionals in general, without a speciﬁc
comparison among the different professional roles of participants. In fact, it could be
that protective and risk factors for speciﬁc groups of professionals, such as early career
professionals or nurses, are completely different from those relevant for senior medical
doctors. Furthermore, the work environment, the type of patients, the tasks required,
the level of responsibility, and the career opportunities available signiﬁcantly change for
each category and can play a role in determining the risk of developing workplace-related
stress or burnout symptoms. Another limitation is due to the extreme heterogeneity of
the assessment tools used for measuring the levels of workplace-related stress. This could
be due to the fact that “workplace-related stress” is a complex phenomenon, including
both structural and organizational factors as well as personal dimensions, such as coping
strategies, temperament traits, and cognitive styles. Therefore, a complex phenomenon
cannot be measured by a unique assessment tool. Finally, most of the interventions were
conducted with volunteers and control groups not clearly deﬁned. This may have led to a
selection bias and to a “placebo” effect. However, the difﬁculty in selecting participants
among healthcare professionals may explain the lack of RCTs on the subject, despite the
growing interest of the scientiﬁc community.

5. Conclusions

The ﬁndings of the present systematic review clearly highlight the complexity of the
management and prevention of work-related stress, which requires a multicomponent and
multilevel approach. Despite the growing interest in the topic, it is not possible to draw
deﬁnite conclusions on the “best practice” to adopt in order to prevent work-related stress
among healthcare workers. It can be useful to run randomized controlled trials examining
the most promising intervention techniques (such as mindfulness), which need to be well-
structured and reliable. Interventions should be carried out on restricted categories of
healthcare professionals, taking into account age, tasks, and type of treated patients. It is
also necessary to deﬁne which assessment tools shall be used in order to compare more
objectively the results and to investigate all the dimensions of burnout [73,74].
