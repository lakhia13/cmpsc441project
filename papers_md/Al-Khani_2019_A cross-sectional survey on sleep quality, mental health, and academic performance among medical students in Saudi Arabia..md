Abstract 
Objective:  Adequate sleep is integral to better mental health and facilitates students’ learning. We aimed to assess 
sleep quality among medical students and to see whether it was associated with their mental health (e.g., depression, 
anxiety, and stress) and academic performance.

Results:  A total of 206 responded, and 95 of them had complete data on demography, lifestyle, academic per‑
formance, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and mental health (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales). The 
prevalence of poor sleep was 63.2%; it was higher among students who were physically inactive and had more screen 
time. Poor sleepers demonstrated higher academic performance than sufficient sleepers (p 
 0.04). The prevalence of 
depression, anxiety, and stress were 42%, 53%, and 31% respectively. Sleep quality was significantly associated with 
depression (p 

 0.007), and stress (p 

 0. 03), anxiety (p 

 0.01).

Introduction
Sleep  is  central  to  health  and  well-being  [1].  For  older 
adults  (46–60  years),  the  recommended  sleep  duration 
is  7  h  or  more  per  night  on  a  regular  basis;  for  younger 
adults (18–45 years), an even longer duration (> 9) is con-
sidered  appropriate  [2].  Sleep  greatly  influences  mental 
function, and thus, affects performance. Insufficient sleep 
decreases general alertness, impairs attention, and slows 
cognitive processing [3, 4].

All  available  Saudi  Arabian  studies  on  sleep  quality 
among medical students were conducted at governmen-
tal colleges; these studies used disparate instruments for 
the assessment of sleep quality [5–9]. For example, stud-
ies  that  used  the  Pittsburgh  Sleep  Quality  Index  (PSQI) 
reported  that  three-quarters  (70–76%)  of  medical  stu-
dents were poor sleepers [7–9].

Both  sleep  quality  and  academic  performance  can 
affect students’ mental wellbeing [10, 11]. In private med-
ical  colleges,  where  the  students  are  mostly  non-Saudi, 
there are additional challenges to mental health, such as 
stress  about  tuition  fees.  Scholarships  to  cover  tuition 
fees are available, but students must obtain and/or main-
tain  academic  excellence  to  qualify. This  fact  likely  adds 
mental pressure on students above and beyond what they 
feel by being in the program itself.

Therefore, in this paper, we assessed sleep quality, aca-
demic  performance,  and  mental  health  in  a  sample  of 
medical students enrolled in a private medical college in 
the Al-Qassim region of Saudi Arabia.

protocol (SRC/01/2018/008). The study was conducted in 
March of 2018.

The  survey  was  sent  to  all  enrolled  medical  students 
(n = 446)  via  their  college  e-mail.  The  students  could 
access  the  survey  with  any  electronic  device  that  was 
capable of accessing their email. The survey began with a 
brief description of the study itself, followed by a detailed 
informed consent that explained the participants’ rights, 
the perceived risks and benefits of participation, and the 
measures  taken  by  the  investigators  to  keep  their  per-
sonal information confidential. The students could access 
the  survey  only  after  they  agreed  to  this  informed  con-
sent.  It  took  a  participant  around  10  min  to  fill  out  the 
survey.

Participants  had  to  be  at  least  18  years  old  (inclusion 
criterion) and currently enrolled in the medical program. 
Students with a chronic medical condition were not eli-
gible  (exclusion  criterion).  A  chronic  medical  condition 
was defined as a self-reported presence of any of the fol-
lowing  conditions:  diabetes  mellitus,  hypertension,  or 
bronchial asthma.

A  total  of  206  students  responded  to  the  survey  (rate 
46%);  nine  did  not  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  (one  stu-
dent  was  < 18  years  old  and  another  eight  reported 
chronic  medical  illnesses).  A  total  of  102  were  excluded 
for missing data (missing data on all variables = 67; miss-
ing  data  on  key  variables  such  as  sleep,  mental  health, 
and  academic  performance  related  questions = 35). 
Therefore, 95 students who had complete data on all vari-
ables were included in the analyses.

Questionnaire contents

The  survey  included,  among  other  questions,  two  vali-
dated and widely used screening tools: (1) the Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [12], and (2) the Depression 
Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) [13]. The PSQI is a tool 
used  to  evaluate  two  sleep  domains:  sleep  quality  and 
sleep  disturbances.  The  questionnaire  yields  an  overall 
score  ranging  from  0  to  21.  A  score  of  5  or  greater  was 
indicative  of  poor  overall  sleep  quality,  whereas  a  score 
of less than 5 was indicative of good overall sleep quality.
The  DASS-21  is  a  clinical  assessment  tool  that  meas-
ures  psychological  distress.  It  contains  21  items  divided 
into  three  subscales  of  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress, 
with  7  items  allocated  for  each  subscale.  The  items  are 
scored  on  a  4-point  scale  ranging  from  0  (did  not  apply 
to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most of the 
time). The range of score a participant could get for each 
subscale  varied  from  0  to  21.  The  recommended  cutoff 
points  were  used  to  classify  participants  into  normal, 
mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe in terms of 
depression, anxiety, and stress [14].

Academic  performance  was  assessed  with  a  self-
reported grade point average (GPA) in the last year. GPA 
is  a  well-established  method  to  assess  academic  per-
formance  in  research  [11,  15,  16].  At  SRC,  a  minimum 
GPA of 4.0 is required to maintain a college scholarship. 
Therefore, it was used to categorise the students into high 
(GPA ≥ 4.0)  and  low  (GPA < 4.0)  achievers.  Additionally, 
students  were  asked  about  a  number  of  socio-demo-
graphic variables seen in Table 1.

Data analysis

The statistical analysis for our study was carried out using 
SPSS software version 25 for Windows. The significance 
level was set at 5%. The characteristics of the sample were 
summarised  using  means  and  standard  deviations  (SD) 
for  continuous  variables  and  frequencies  with  percent-
ages for categorical variables. Independent sample t test 
was  used  for  continuous  variables  while  Chi  square  test 
(χ2)  was  used  for  categorical  variables.  Univariate  and 
multivariate regression analyses were used to model the 
predictors of academic performance.

Results
Socio‑demographic characteristics

Male  students  constituted  around  76%  of  the  sample. 
The  sample’s  mean  age  was  20.8  years  (standard  devia-
tion = 1.95,  range = 18–28  years).  The  preparatory, 
preclinical  (years  1–2),  and  clinical  (years  3–5)  stu-
dents  made  up  20.0%,  52.6%,  and  27.4%  of  the  sample, 
respectively.

Thirty-nine  percent  of  the  students  described  their 
lifestyle  as  either  ‘very’  or  ‘somewhat’  inactive;  60% 
described their dietary habits as ‘unhealthy.’ Smoking was 
reported by 11.6% of the students. Less than half (46.3%) 
reported  a  screen  time  of  5  to  10  h/day.  Approximately 
two-thirds  of  the  students  (66%)  were  sharing  a  room 
with a roommate, 20% lived with their families, and 14% 
lived  alone.  A  summary  of  demographic  and  lifestyle 
characteristics is shown in Table 1.

Academic performance

The  overwhelming  majority  of  the  students  reported 
regular  attendance  at  academic  activities  (90.5%)  and 
reported  enjoying  working  in  group  academic  activities 
(93.7%).  The  sample  had  almost  equal  proportions  of 
high (50.5%) and low (49.5%) achievers.

Subjective sleep quality (PSQI)
The  PSQI  score  ranged  from  0  to  16  (mean = 5.7, 
SD = 3.2);  36.8%  were  good  sleepers.  Sleep  quality  was 
significantly  associated  with  physical  activity 
level 
(p = 0.014) and screen time (p = 0.046). Gender, academic 
year, dietary habits, smoking status, Quran reading, and

The  participants’  depression  scores  ranged  from  0  to  20 
(mean = 5.31,  SD = 4.89).  27.3%  of  the  participants  had 
mild  to  moderate  depression  and  14.7%  had  severe  to 
extremely  severe  depression.  The  anxiety  scores  ranged 
from 0 and 19 (mean = 4.86, SD = 4.27). Only 3% had mild 
to  moderate  anxiety  and  25.3%  had  severe  to  extremely 
severe anxiety. Lastly, the stress scores ranged between 0 
and 21 (mean = 6.18, SD = 4.86); 17.9% had mild to mod-
erate  stress  and  12.7%  had  severe  to  extremely  severe 
stress.  Sleep  quality  was  significantly  associated  with 
depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  (p = 0.013),  (p = 0.003), 
(p = 0.004),  respectively.  Table  2  shows  significance  val-
ues of subjective sleep quality compared with DASS-21.

Predictors of academic performance

Unadjusted analyses of academic performance with vari-
ous sample characteristics showed that sleep quality and 
academic  year  were  significantly  associated  with  aca-
demic  achievement.  Poor  sleepers  were  42%  less  likely 
to  have  been  low  achievers  compared  to  good  sleepers 
(OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.17–0.99%). Similarly, preparatory-
year  students  were  19%  less  likely  to  be  low  achievers. 
The  associations  remained  more  or  less  the  same  in  the 
multivariate model, but lost their statistical significance. 
The regression model is summarised in Table 3.

Discussion
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  prevalence  of 
poor sleep quality among college students in Saudi Ara-
bia. Results showed that almost two-thirds (63.2%) of the

students were poor sleepers. These numbers were consid-
erably  higher  than  numbers  reported  by  other  students 
in the Middle East: 37.1% in Lebanon [17] and 55.7% in 
Egypt [18]. Studies in Saudi Arabia reported similar per-
centages (70–76%) [7–9].

Another  objective  was  to  assess  the  relationship 
between  poor  sleep  quality  and  students’  lifestyle,  aca-
demic performance, stress, anxiety, and depression levels. 
The results of this study showed that poor sleepers were 
significantly  more  likely  to  be  physically  inactive  than 
good sleepers. This aligns with the results of other studies 
that  demonstrated  a  bidirectional  relationship  between 
sleep and physical activity [19].

Results  showed  that  almost  60%  of  the  poor  sleepers 
were  high  achievers.  In  fact,  high  achievers  were  42% 
more  likely  to  be  poor  sleepers  when  compared  to  low 
achievers.  However,  students  who  were  poor  sleepers 
were more likely to score high on the depression, anxiety, 
and  stress  scales.  Other  studies  have  reported  that  aca-
demic performance is associated with the timing of sleep 
and wakefulness, but not with total sleep duration [20].

Depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  in  this  sample  were 
42.1%, 52.6%, and 30.5%, respectively. These proportions 
are comparably lower than proportions reported by other 
Middle  Eastern  studies  (depression,  anxiety,  and  stress 
were  65%,  73%,  and  59.9%,  respectively)  [18].  Results 
show  that  poor  sleep  is  significantly  related  to  the  pres-
ence  of  depression  (p = 0.  03),  anxiety  (p = 0.007),  and 
stress,  (p = 0.01).  Those  findings  are  similar  to  findings 
reported by other studies in the Middle East [18].

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study showed that poor sleep habits 
were associated with a higher level of depression, anxi-
ety,  and  stress  among  medical  students.  Despite  this, 
students  with  poor  sleep  habits  had  higher  academic 

performance  than  students  with  better  sleep  habits. 
Medical students should be aware of the importance of 
sleep quality and how it affects their mental health.

Limitations
The current study had several limitations. The response 
rate  of  46%  of  the  eligible  students  was  lower  than  its 
corresponding  estimate  from  other  studies  [17,  20]. 
Medical  students  are  overwhelmingly  busy  with  their 
studies  and  have  immense  test  anxiety,  which  might 
explain a low response rate (46%) as well as a high rate 
of incomplete data (50%) among those who responded. 
That the questions in the survey were vague or difficult 
is  an  unlikely  explanation  for  the  missing  data  since 
the  majority  of  the  records  were  completely  empty. 
The length of the survey also does not explain the low 
response  rate.  Whatever  the  cause,  this  high  rate  of 
missing data seriously compromised the study, and this 
needs  to  be  taken  into  account  while  interpreting  the 
findings.
