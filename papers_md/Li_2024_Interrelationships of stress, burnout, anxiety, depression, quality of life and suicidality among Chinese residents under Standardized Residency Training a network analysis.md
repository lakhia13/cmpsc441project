ABSTRACT
Background:  chinese  resident  physicians  confront  challenges  such  as  staff  shortages  and  heavy 
workloads,  leading  to  a  heightened  prevalence  of  mental  distress.  this  study  aims  to  investigate 
the  symptom  network  of  stress,  burnout,  anxiety,  depression  (sBaD)  and  adverse  personal 
outcomes  in  this  cohort.
Methods:  From  October  2020  to  april  2022,  994  physicians  were  recruited  across  china  through 
snowball  sampling.  stress,  burnout,  anxiety  and  depression  were  assessed  using  the  10-item 
Perceived  stress  scale,  a  two-item  burnout  questionnaire,  Generalized  anxiety  Disorder  scale-7 
and  the  Patient  health  Questionnaire-9,  respectively.  Data  on  adverse  personal  outcomes  (low 
quality  of  life  [QOl]  and  suicidal  ideation)  were  collected.  We  constructed  and  visualized  two 
networks,  calculating  expected  influence  (ei)  and  bridge  ei  indices  to  identify  central  and  bridge 
symptoms.
Results:  in  the  sBaD  network,  perceived  helplessness  was  the  most  central  and  critical  bridge 
symptom  connecting  stress  and  mental  distress,  with  emotional  exhaustion  identified  as  the 
secondary  bridge  symptom.  Perceived  helplessness,  perceived  self-efficacy  and  emotional 
exhaustion  exhibited  the  highest  negative  correlations  with  QOl.  Worthless  (PhQ6)  and  motor 
(PhQ8)  symptoms  were  strongly  correlated  with  suicidal  ideation.  the  estimated  sBaD  network 
showed  excellent  stability  and  accuracy.
Conclusions:  Our  study  emphasizes  that  perceived  helplessness  may  be  a  high-priority  target  for 
preventing  and  intervening  in  mental  distress  and  improving  QOl  among  residents.  Burnout 
transcends  workplace  problems  and  is  widely  connected  to  depression,  anxiety  and  QOl. 
implementing  early  detection  and  intervention  measures  at  three  levels—the  individual  physician, 
health  system  and  professional  colleges,  and  external  regulators—is  crucial  for  preventing  and 
alleviating  stress  and  mental  distress  among  residents.

HIGHLIGHTS
•  this  study  provided  the  first  quantitative  network  analysis  on  the  interactions  of  stress, 
burnout,  anxiety,  depression,  quality  of  life  and  suicidal  ideation  among  resident  physicians.
•  this  study  emphasizes  the  critical  role  of  perceived  helplessness,  emerging  as  the  most  central 
and bridge symptom connecting stress and mental distress, driving comorbidity and impacting 
quality  of  life.

•  Perceived  helplessness  may  be  a  high-priority  target  for  prevention  and  intervention.
•  Burnout  transcends  workplace  problems  and  is  widely  connected  to  depression,  anxiety  and 

quality  of  life.

•  Our  findings  provide  meaningful  guidance  for  organizations  and  managers  in  implementing 

early  detection  and  intervention  measures.

Introduction

are 

the 

issues 

exacerbated 

the  mental  health  of  physicians  is  a  significant  public 
health concern globally [1–5]. approximately one-third 
of 
resident  physicians  experience  symptoms  of 
depression and anxiety [5, 6]. a meta-analysis revealed 
that  the  global  prevalence  of  burnout  among  medical 
and  surgical  residents  is  as  high  as  51%  [7].  in  china, 
these 
low 
physician-to-population  ratio  and  strained  doctor–
patient  relationships.  since  the  launch  of  the  nation-
wide  standardized  Residency  training  (sRt)  program 
in  2014,  resident  physicians  have  shouldered  a  major 
burden  of  daily  medical  duties  [2].  in  addition  to  chal-
lenges  common  to  all  physicians,  residents  may  face 
unique  stressors  during  their  sRt  phase,  such  as 
excessive  working  hours,  academic  and  examination 
stress,  financial  pressures  and  job  insecurity  [1,  8]. 
these  factors  make  residents  particularly  vulnerable 
to  mental  distress,  including  burnout,  anxiety  and 
depression  [2–6].  such  distress  could  lead  to  adverse 
personal  outcomes,  including  diminished  quality  of 
life  [QOl]  and  suicidal  ideation,  and  even  jeopardize 
patient  care  [9–11].  studies  have  shown  that  depres-
sive  symptoms  and  suicidal  ideation  are  more  preva-
lent  among  physicians  in  training  and  residency  than 
among their senior counterparts [1, 12]. the well-being 
of  residents  is  a  benchmark  for  the  sustainability  of 
healthcare  systems  [4,  13].  therefore,  it  is  crucial  to 
better  understand  how  stress,  burnout,  anxiety  and 
depression  interrelate  and  affect  the  personal  out-
comes  among  residents.

individual 

it  is  worth  noting  that  most  previous  studies  on  the 
associations  among  stress,  mental  distress  and  per-
sonal  outcomes  have  utilized  syndrome-level  analyses 
(based  on  total  scale  score)  [1,  10,  14–23].  Network 
analysis  (Na),  a  symptom-based  approach,  provides 
novel  insights  into  these  complex  relationships  [24]. 
Na  enables  us  to  clarify  how  specific  symptoms  (based 
on 
item  scores  or  dimension  scores)  of 
stress,  burnout,  anxiety  and  depression  symptoms  cor-
relate,  interact  and  reinforce  each  other  and  how  they 
impact  personal  outcomes  in  resident  physicians  [25]. 
this  method  quantifies  the  importance  of  each  symp-
tom  and  identifies  a  central  symptom  that  is  most 
closely  linked  to  and  has  the  most  significant  impact 
on  other  symptoms  in  the  network  [25–27].  By  map-
ping  these  symptoms  into  the  network,  Na  pinpoints 
the  ‘bridge  symptoms’  connecting  these  four  con-
structs  and  playing  critical  roles  in  their  comorbidity 
[28,  29].  Moreover,  Na  highlights  which  symptoms 
exhibit  the  strongest  connections  to  specific  adverse 
outcomes  through  visualization.  these  central  and 

bridge  symptoms,  as  well  as  those  most  strongly  con-
nected  to  adverse  outcomes,  could  serve  as  pivotal 
targets  for  prevention  and  intervention  [30].

to  our  knowledge,  only  two  studies  have  docu-
mented  the  intricate  network  of  burnout,  anxiety  and 
depression  among  non-chinese  physicians  [31,  32]. 
however,  these  studies  did  not  investigate  the  rela-
tionships  between  mental  distress  and  stress  among 
resident  physicians  despite  the  substantial  professional 
pressures  they  face.  hence,  to  address  these  gaps,  we 
employed  Na  to  quantify  the  relationships  between 
stress  and  mental  distress  and  explore  their  associa-
tions  with  adverse  outcomes.  the  purposes  of  our 
study  were  (1)  to  explore  the  network  structure  of  per-
ceived  stress-burnout-anxiety-depression  (sBaD),  (2)  to 
determine  the  central  and  bridge  symptoms  across  the 
network  and  (3)  to 
identify  which  symptoms  are 
uniquely  associated  with  adverse  personal  outcomes, 
including  low  QOl  and  suicidal  ideation.

Methods

Study  procedure  and  participants

We  conducted  a  cross-sectional  online  survey  from 
October  2020  to  april  2022  using  the  Wenjuanxing 
platform  (www.wjx.cn),  a  well-known  chinese  online 
questionnaire  website.  During  this  period,  china  had 
entered  the  controlled  stage  of  the  cOViD-19  pan-
demic.  Participants  meeting  the  following  criteria  were 
recruited  through  snowball  sampling:  (1)  chinese,  age 
20–50 years  old;  (2)  being  able  to  understand  chinese 
and  willing  to  participate  in  the  survey  and  (3)  resi-
dent  physicians  undergoing  sRt  in  chinese  hospitals, 
regardless  of  their  specialty.  all  participants  provided 
written  informed  consent  through  an  online  survey 
platform  (www.wjx.cn).  Participation  was  anonymous 
and  voluntary,  and  they  could  withdraw  from  the 
study  at  any  time.  however,  participants  were  required 
to  complete  all  questions  before  submitting  the  ques-
tionnaire. the  ethics  committee  of  the  second  Xiangya 
hospital  of  central  south  University  approved  the 
study  (JY20200326).

Measurements

Demographic  information

We collected basic information through a self-designed 
questionnaire,  including  age,  gender,  marital  status, 
education 
illness,  training 
mode  and  training  stage.  additionally,  we  added  a 
trap  question,  ‘When  is  the  chinese  national  day?’  to 

level,  history  of  mental 

identify  and  exclude 
invalid  responses.  Participants 
who  answered  incorrectly  were  excluded  from  the  final 
analysis.

Perceived  stress

We  used  the  10-item  Perceived  stress  scale  (Pss-10)  to 
evaluate  perceived  stress.  Previous  studies  have  indi-
cated  that  the  Pss-10  comprises  two  factors:  perceived 
helplessness  (Phs)  and  perceived  self-efficacy  (Pses) 
[33].  the  total  Pss-10  score  ranges  from  0  to  40,  with 
higher  scores  suggesting  higher  levels  of  perceived 
stress.  a  cutoff  point  of  19  was  used  to  identify  high 
perceived  stress  [34].

Burnout

to  measure  burnout  levels,  we  utilized  the  two-item 
burnout  questionnaire,  which 
includes  emotional 
exhaustion  (eX)  (‘i  feel  burned  out  from  my  job’)  and 
depersonalization  (DP)  (‘i  have  become  more  callous 
towards  persons  since  i  started  this  work’).  Participants 
rated  the  frequency  of  these  symptoms  on  a  7-point 
likert  scale,  ranging  from  1  (not  at  all)  to  7  (every 
day).  individuals  who  responded ‘once  a  week’  or  more 
frequently  to  either  item  were  classified  as  experienc-
ing  burnout.  these  two  single  items  have  been  vali-
dated  and  widely  used  in  examining  burnout  among 
medical  staff  [35–37].

Depression  and  anxiety

the  9-item  Patient  health  Questionnaire  (PhQ-9)  and 
the  7-item  Generalized  anxiety  Disorder  scale  (GaD-7) 
were  used  to  evaluate  depressive  and  anxiety  symp-
toms,  respectively.  Both  scales  have  been  validated 
among chinese healthcare workers [38–40]. Participants 
rated  their  depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms  on  a 
4-point  likert  scale  from  0  (not  at  all)  to  3  (almost 
every  day),  with  higher  scores  indicating  more  severe 
mental  distress.  a  cutoff  point  of  10  was  used  to 
screen  clinically  relevant  depressive  and  anxiety  symp-
toms  [34].

Suicidal  ideation

to  identify  current  suicidal  ideation  (si),  we  utilized  the 
ninth  item  of  PhQ-9  (‘thoughts  that  you  would  be 
better  off  dead,  or  thoughts  of  hurting  yourself  in 
some  way?’).  this  single  item  has  been  extensively 
used  to  assess  suicidal  ideation  in  previous  epidemio-
logical  studies  [42].  Participants  who  scored  one  or 
above on this item were classified into the si group [43].

Statistical  analysis

Descriptive  analysis

We  used  the  shapiro–Wilks  test  to  check  the  normality 
of  the  continuous  data  and  observed  a  non-normal 
distribution.  therefore,  continuous  data  were  pre-
sented  as  the  median  and  inter-quartile  range  (iQR). 
categorical  data  were  expressed  as  percentages  and 
frequencies.  We  performed  all  the  statistical  analyses 
using  R  (R  Foundation  for  statistical  computing  ver-
sion  4.3.2,  Vienna,  austria).  We  constructed  two  net-
works.  in  network  1,  we  analysed  the  interactions 
among  perceived  stress,  burnout,  anxiety  and  depres-
sion  symptoms  and  further  assessed  the  association  of 
these  symptoms  with  suicidal  ideation.  in  network  2, 
we  explored  the  associations  between  these  mental 
distress  symptoms  and  QOl.

Network  estimation  and  visualization

We  modelled  and  visualized  the  sBaD  network  of  res-
idents  in  sRt  using  the  ‘estimateNetwork’  function  in 
the  R  package  ‘bootnet’  [44].  the  Gaussian  graphical 
model  was  selected  with  the  default  setting  of 
eBicglasso  and  the  ‘spearman’  method  [45].  the  net-
work  consisted  of  ‘nodes’  (i.e.  the  items  of  Pss-10, 
two-item  burnout  questionnaire,  PhQ-9  and  GaD-7) 
and  ‘edges’  (i.e.  the  partial  correlations  between  two 
nodes  after  controlling  for  other  variables  in  the  net-
work).  thicker  edges  indicate  stronger  associations, 
with  red  edges  representing  negative  associations  and 
blue  edges  denoting  positive  associations  [46].

Quality  of  life

We  assessed  the  quality  of  life  (QOl)  using  a  standard-
ized  linear  analogue  scale,  with  scores  ranging  from  0 
(as  bad  as  it  can  be)  to  10  (as  good  as  it  can  be)  [41]. 
in  alignment  with  previous  studies  [34,  41],  we  defined 
low  QOl  as  scores  ≥  1/2  standard  deviation  (sD)  below 
the  gender-matched  mean  score.

Central  and  bridge  symptoms

We  used  the  R  package  ‘qgraph’  to  estimate  each 
node’s  expected  influence  (ei)  within  the  network,  thus 
providing  a  quantitative  measure  of  the  importance  of 
individual  nodes 
in  the  overall  network  structure  
[47,  48].  Nodes  with  higher  ei  were  identified  as  cen-
tral  symptoms,  which  may  have  a  crucial  role  in  initi-
ating  and  maintaining  the  sBaD  network.  We  also 

4

Z. li et al.

utilized  the  R  package  ‘mgm’  to  assess  the  node  pre-
dictability  in  the  network  [49].  Predictability,  defined 
as  the  variance  in  a  node  that  is  explained  by  all  other 
nodes  in  the  network,  serves  as  a  crucial  indicator  of 
network  controllability.  Nodes  exhibiting  high  predict-
ability  could  potentially  be  influenced  or  controlled 
in  their  neighbouring  nodes 
through  modifications 
[50].  in  addition,  we  computed  the  bridge  expected 
influence  (Bei)  index  to  identify  symptoms  acting  as 
bridges  across  the  sBaD  network  [28].  Nodes  with 
higher  Bei  exhibited  stronger  associations  with  symp-
toms  in  other  distress  domains. the  selection  of  bridge 
symptoms  was  determined  using  the  80th  percentile 
Bei  threshold  [28,  51].

Network  stability  and  accuracy

We  applied  the  bootstrapping  method  to  assess  the 
accuracy  and  robustness  of  the  network  estimate  uti-
lizing  the  ‘bootnet’  package  [52].  the  stability  of  both 
node  and  Bei  was  evaluated  using  the  case-dropping 
procedure.  the  correlation  stability  coefficient  (cs-c) 
quantifies  the  stability  of  the  network,  with  a  cs-c 
value  greater  than  0.5  indicating  a  high  level  of  net-
work  stability. to  verify  the  accuracy  of  estimated  edge 
weights  in  the  network,  we  employed  a  nonparametric 
bootstrapping  procedure  with  1000  bootstrap  samples. 
additionally,  we  performed  bootstrapping  on  the 
paired  differences  of  edge  weights  and  the  paired  dif-
ferences  of  centrality  of  different  nodes  to  examine 
whether  edges  or  nodes  differed  significantly  from  one 
another.

The  association  of  SBAD  with  adverse  outcomes

Finally,  we  incorporated  the  variable ‘quality  of  life’  into 
network  1  (sBaD  network),  generating  new  network  2. 
subsequently,  the ‘flow’  function  was  utilized  to  visual-
ize  symptoms  directly  associated  with  low  QOl  as  well 
as  suicidal  ideation  [53].

Results

Sample  characteristics

a  total  of  994  resident  physicians  in  sRt  completed 
the  online  questionnaire,  and  after  the  screening,  927 
(96.9%)  of  them  were  available  for  further  analysis 
(table  1).  the  median  age  of  participants  was  25 years 
old  (iQR,  24–27),  and  most  were  female  (n = 672,  72%), 
unmarried  (n = 786,  85%)  and  held  a  bachelor’s  degree 
(n = 734,  79%).  Nearly  half  of  the  residents  (n = 423, 
46%)  were  concurrently  enrolled  in  graduate  school 

alongside  their  sRt.  there  were  51  (5.5%)  individuals 
with  a  history  of  mental  illness.  Participants  in  the 
three  grades  of  sRt  were  evenly  distributed,  with 
approximately  one-third  in  each  grade:  306  (33%)  in 
the  1st  year,  286  (31%)  in  the  2nd  year  and  335  (36%) 
in  the  3rd  year. the  prevalence  rates  of  high  perceived 
stress,  depression,  anxiety,  burnout,  low  QOl  and  sui-
cidal  ideation  were  43%  (n = 403),  36%  (n = 336),  20% 
(n = 184), 43% (n = 401), 36% (n = 338) and 27% (n = 247), 
respectively.

The  stress-burnout-anxiety-depression  network

table  2  presents  the  content,  mean  and  standard  devia-
tions  (sD)  for  Pss-10,  two-item  burnout  questionnaire, 
GaD-7  and  PhQ-9.  Figure  1  depicts  the  network  struc-
ture  of  stress,  burnout,  anxiety  and  depression  among 
chinese  residents  in  sRt.  the  network  consisted  of  20 
nodes  with  a  density  of  0.674  (128/190).  all  edges  within 
the  network  were  positive,  with  a  mean  weight  of  0.046. 
the  most  substantial  edges  were  PhQ1  (anhedonia)-
PhQ2  (sad  mood),  followed  by  GaD1  (Nervous)-GaD2 
(Uncontrollable  worry),  GaD2 
(Uncontrollable  wor-
ry)-GaD3  (excessive  worry)  and  Phs-eX.  according  to  the 
bootstrap  test,  these  edges  were  statistically  more  robust 
link  between 
than  others  (Figure  s1).  the  strongest 
depressive and anxiety symptoms was PhQ2 (sad mood)-
GaD1  (Nervous). the  closest  edge  between  burnout  and 
anxiety  symptoms  was  DP-GaD7  (concentration).

Figure  1.  network  structure  of  stress,  burnout,  depression  and  anxiety  symptoms  in  resident  physicians.  edge  thickness  represents 
the  degree  of  association.  All  edges  within  the  network  were  positive  (blue).  The  coloured  area  in  the  rings  around  the  nodes 
depicts  predictability  (the  variance  of  a  given  node  explained  by  all  its  neighbours).

Phs  and  eX  exhibited  different  levels  of  association 
with  anxiety  and  depressive  symptoms.  Phs  was  posi-
tively associated with eight out of nine depression symp-
toms  and  seven  anxiety  symptoms.  eX  exhibited  positive 
associations  with  two  depressive  symptoms  and  four 
anxiety  symptoms.  Phs  showed  the  most  robust  positive 

associations  with  eX,  GaD6 
(irritability)  and  PhQ6 
(Worthless),  while  eX  had  the  strongest  positive  relation-

predictability  of  the  nodes  was  0.51,  suggesting  that 
approximately  half  of  the  invariances  of  the  symptoms 
could  be  predicted  by  other  symptoms  within  the  net-
work.  anxiety  symptoms,  such  as  Uncontrollable  worry 
(GaD2),  excessive  worry  (GaD3),  Nervous  (GaD1)  and 
trouble  relaxing  (GaD4),  displayed  high  predictability 
(0.70  to  0.74).  On  the  other  hand,  Pses  showed  the 
lowest  predictability  with  a  value  of  0.10  (table  s2).

Central  and  bridge  symptoms

Figure  2(a)  and table  s3  display  the  centrality  of  nodes 
within  the  sBaD  network.  Phs  had  the  highest  ei  
centrality  across  the  entire  network,  statistically 
stronger  than  all  other  symptoms  (Figure  s2  a). 
Other  central  symptoms 
included  Uncontrollable 
worry  (GaD2),  trouble  relaxing  (GaD4)  and  Nervous 
(GaD1).  Figure  2(B)  presents  the  bridge  expected 
influence  of  each  node.  Phs,  eX  and  irritability  (GaD6) 
held  the  strongest  Bei,  serving  as  bridge  symptoms 
and  driving  the  comorbid  symptoms.  these  symptoms 
held  significantly  higher  Bei  than  other  nodes  within 
the  network  (Figure  s2  B).

Stability  and  accuracy  of  the  network

the  network  exhibited  excellent  stability  and  accuracy. 
the  cs-c  of  ei  and  Bei  was  0.75  (Figure  3(a)),  suggest-
ing  that  the  network  remained  highly  correlated  with 
the  original  data  after  dropping  out  75%  of  the  data. 
Figure  3(B)  displays  the  results  of  the  nonparametric 

bootstrapping  procedure.  the  grey  area  represents  the 
bootstrap  95%  confidence  interval,  which  was  narrow 
and  indicated  high  accuracy  of  the  estimated  edges.

Symptoms  directly  related  to  negative 
consequences

Figure  4(a,B)  illustrates  the  symptoms  directly  associ-
ated  with  negative  consequences,  including  suicidal 
ideation and low QOl. We found that PhQ6 (Worthless), 
PhQ8  (Motor),  PhQ2  (sad  mood)  and  GaD7  (Feeling 
afraid)  had  the  strongest  associations  with  suicidal  ide-
ation.  QOl  was  associated  with  13  symptoms  of  sBaD. 
specifically,  Phs,  Pses,  eX  and  PhQ4  (Fatigue)  had  the 
strongest  negative  correlations  with  QOl.

Discussion

to  our  knowledge,  this  study  provided  the  first  net-
work  analysis  of  stress,  burnout,  anxiety  and  depres-
sion  symptoms  and  their  associations  with  adverse 
personal  outcomes  (low  QOl  and  suicidal  ideation) 
among  physicians  in  sRt.  the  major  findings  included 
the  following:  (1)  the  sBaD  network  showed  a  dense 
structure,  indicating  that  stress,  burnout,  anxiety  and 
depression  were  highly  correlated  at  the  symptom 
level.  (2)  Perceived  helplessness  was  the  most  central 
and  bridge  symptom,  while  emotional  exhaustion  was 
the  second  bridge  symptom.  (3)  sBaD  symptoms  dis-
played  varied  levels  of  association  with  adverse  out-
comes.  Phs,  Pses  and  eX  had  the  strongest  negative

correlations  with  QOl,  while  Worthless  (PhQ6)  and 
Motor  (PhQ8)  were  most  strongly  associated  with  sui-
cidal  ideation.  these  results  provide  possible  targets 
for  preventing  mental  distress,  reducing  suicide  and 
improving  the  quality  of  life  among  residents.

Our  study  first  identified  Perceived  helplessness  as 
both  the  most  central  and  bridge  symptom  in  the 
sBaD  network  of  physicians  in  sRt.  Our  results  empha-
size  the  importance  of  Phs  in  initiating  and  maintain-
ing  the  stress  and  mental  distress  network.  consistent 
with  our  findings,  previous  studies  using  non-network 
analysis  have  shown  that  stress  was  strongly  correlated 
with  burnout,  anxiety  and  depressive  symptoms  
[15–17].  Numerous  studies  have  revealed  that  stress  is 
a  major  contributor  to  both  physical  and  mental  ill-
nesses  [54,  55].  according  to  the  transactional  concept 
of  stress,  they  become  stressors  when  an  individual 
perceives  environmental  influences  as  threats  and  as 
something  that  exceeds  their  capacity  to  deal  with 
[56].  exposure  to  persistent  stressors  could  lead  to  pro-
longed,  excessive  or 
insufficient  activation  of  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis  (hPa),  which  may 
subsequently  result  in  the  development  of  psychiatric 
disorders,  including  depression  and  anxiety  [55,  57, 
58].  When  subdividing  the  dimensions  of  stress,  help-
lessness  is  perceived  as  an  essential  component  of  psy-
chopathological  symptoms  [59].  the  Phs  dimension 
assesses  how  individuals  perceive  situations  in  their 
lives  as  unpredictable,  uncontrollable  and  overloaded, 

reflecting  the  lack  of  control  and  negative  emotions 
[60].  it  is  a  belief  of  powerlessness  that  someone’s 
actions  do  not  influence  the  action’s  outcomes,  known 
as  learned  helplessness  [61].  learned  helplessness  is  a 
maladaptive  response  to  uncontrollable  stress  charac-
terized  by  impaired  motor  escape  responses,  reduced 
motivation  and  learning  deficits  [59,  62],  which  could 
lead  to  emotional  distress  and  adverse  outcomes  in 
the  long  term.  Moreover,  research  has  shown  that 
helplessness  was  a  strong  predictor  of  emotional 
exhaustion  [63].  this  emotional  exhaustion  could  lead 
to  emotional  and  cognitive  distancing,  thus  negatively 
impacting  physicians’  mental  health  [64].

QOl  includes  various  aspects  of  a  person’s  physical 
condition,  psychological  state,  level  of  independence, 
social  relationships,  environment  and  spirituality  [65]. 
the  results  of  this  study  revealed  that  Phs  and  Pses 
were  significantly  and  negatively  correlated  with  qual-
ity  of  life. this  finding  is  consistent  with  previous  stud-
ies  that  showed  a  significant  association  between 
stress  and  poor  QOl  [21–23].  Prioritizing  work  over 
personal  life  or  lacking  a  work–life  balance  could  lead 
to  high  levels  of  stress,  further  increasing  the  risk  of 
mental  distress  and  decreasing  overall  well-being  
[66–68].  therefore,  how  to  identify  and  reduce  help-
lessness  among  residents  in  sRt  is  an  urgent  issue  for 
researchers  and  healthcare  administrators.  improving 
self-efficacy  and  individual  interventions  such  as  cog-
therapy  and  mindfulness-based

techniques  have  proven  effective  and  essential  in  alle-
viating  Phs  and  stress  [69–73].  at  the  same  time, 
healthcare 
implement 
facility  administrators  must 
to  manage  workload  or 
organizational  strategies 
schedules  to  alleviate  stress,  prevent  mental  distress 
and  mitigate  adverse  outcomes  [71,  72,  74].

Our  research  also  underscored  the  significance  of 
burnout  in  the  network  of  mental  distress  and  QOl. 
this  study  revealed  that  burnout  symptoms  exhibited 
diverse  and  extensive  connections  with  depressive  and 
anxiety  symptoms,  with  emotional  exhaustion  serving 

as  the  bridge  symptom  connecting  the  sBaD  network. 
there  has  been  an  ongoing  debate  regarding  the 
overlap  between  burnout  and  depression  constructs 
[1,  18–20].  specifically,  recent  studies  have  increasingly 
highlighted  a  substantial  overlap  between  burnout 
and depression [75–78], suggesting that burnout might 
be  considered  as  one  dimension  of  depression  rather 
[79]. 
than  a  distinct  psychological  phenomenon 
however,  other  studies  argued  for  the  distinctiveness 
of  depression  and  burnout  as  ‘two  different  robust 
[32,  80].  therefore,  further  studies  are 
constructs’ 

urgently  needed  to  provide  a  deeper  understanding  of 
the  intricate  relationship  between  burnout  and  depres-
sion  [81].  in  addition,  we  also  found  that  eX  signifi-
cantly  negatively  impacted  the  quality  of  life.  these 
findings  emphasize  that  burnout  goes  beyond  an 
‘occupational  phenomenon’  and  is  highly  correlated 
with  mental  distress  and  poor  QOl,  with  profound 
effects  on  individuals.  consequently,  routine  screen-
ings  for  burnout  become  imperative,  particularly  high-
lighting  the  identification  of  symptoms  of  depression, 
anxiety  and  diminished  quality  of  life  among  residency 
training  physicians  experiencing  burnout.  Furthermore, 
healthcare organizations should develop a well-established 
support system and implement both individual-focused 
and  structural  or  organizational  strategies  to  reduce 
burnout  and  promote  the  overall  mental  health  of  res-
idents  [1,  82,  83].

the  network  analysis  reveals  several  noteworthy 
implications.  Firstly,  our  study  highlights  the  critical 
need  to  consistently  and  systematically  screen  stress, 
burnout,  anxiety,  depression  and  adverse  outcomes  in 
physicians  during  sRt.  secondly,  our  study  emphasizes 
perceived  helplessness  as  the  most  central  and  bridge 
symptom,  standing  out  as  the  most  influential  predic-
tor  for  low  QOl.  thus,  Phs  may  be  a  promising  target 
for  the  prevention  and  intervention  of  stress  and  men-
tal  distress  among  residents  in  sRt.  Finally,  our  find-
ings 
illustrated  that  burnout  extends  beyond  the 
general  occupational  phenomenon,  correlating  closely 
with  mental  distress  and  QOl.  these  findings  offer 
essential  guidance  for  healthcare  organizations  and 
residency  training  administrators  to  enhance  the  men-
tal  health  and  well-being  of  their  residents  in  sRt.

insights,  several 

Despite  the  valuable 

limitations 
should  be  acknowledged.  First,  the  representativeness 
of  our  findings  might  be  compromised  by  the  online 
introducing 
snowball  sampling  method,  potentially 
selection  bias.  additionally,  the  relatively  modest  sam-
ple  size  might  not  capture  the  full  diversity  of  china’s 
residency-training  physician  population.  Nevertheless, 
the  incidence  of  mental  distress  and  negative  conse-
quences  align  closely  with  other  large-scale  studies 
among  chinese  physicians,  suggesting  that  these 
biases  might  be  relatively  minor  [53,  84].  second,  the 
cross-sectional  nature  of  this  study  inhibited  us  from 
drawing  causal  relationships.  third,  our  evaluation  of 
burnout  utilized  only  two 
items,  overlooking  the 
dimension  of  low  personal  accomplishment.  Utilizing 
more  comprehensive  assessments  for  these  key  vari-
ables  might  help  better  understand  the  association 
between  stress,  burnout,  anxiety,  depression  and  neg-
the  measurement  of 
ative  consequences.  lastly,

burnout  in  this  study  did  not  consider  the  impact  of 
the  cOViD-19  pandemic.  the  pandemic  has  also  been 
recognized  as  a  significant  contributor  to  burnout, 
characterized  by  symptoms  such  as  overwhelming 
exhaustion,  reduced  personal  accomplishment,  emo-
tional  drainage  and  decreased  motivation  [85].  Further 
longitudinal  research  with  comprehensive  assessments 
is  essential  to  validate  and  build  upon  our  findings.

Conclusions

in  conclusion,  this  study  establishes  the  first  network 
linking  stress,  burnout,  depression,  anxiety,  quality  of 
life  and  suicidal  ideation  among  chinese  resident  phy-
sicians.  Our  findings  emphasize  the  important  role  of 
perceived  helplessness  in  sustaining  this  network,  driv-
ing comorbidity and impacting quality of life. Perceived 
helplessness  should  thus  be  a  major  prioritized  target 
for  prevention  and  intervention.  additionally,  our  study 
indicates  that  burnout  transcends  workplace  problems 
and  is  deeply  connected  to  depression,  anxiety  and 
quality  of  life.  implementing  early  detection  and  inter-
vention  measures  at  three  levels—the  individual  physi-
cian,  health  system  and  professional  colleges,  and 
external  regulators—is  crucial  for  preventing  and  alle-
viating  stress  and  mental  distress  among  resident 
physicians.
