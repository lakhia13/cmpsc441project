Background: Attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are generally
considered early-onset disorders so most research has therefore tended to focus on children. Differences between
ADHD/ASD in adult life and childhood have been noted, but few population-based studies have examined them in
adulthood. Furthermore, the interpretation of ﬁndings is hampered by changes in measure and from parent report to
self-report. Method: We examined continuous/trait measures of parent- and self-rated ADHD and ASD in adulthood
(age 25 years) in a UK prospective longitudinal sample ALPSAC (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children), using many of the same measures that parents reported on in childhood (N = 6,064). Our aim was to
investigate these traits in this population for mean-level sex differences, overlaps with other cognitive, learning and
communication problems and their associations with polygenic risk scores (PRS) for neuropsychiatric disorders
(ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety). Results: ADHD and ASD traits in adulthood, as in childhood,
showed associations with childhood cognitive, learning and communication problems and adult communication/
language measures, although less so for self-ratings than parent-ratings. Males had higher ADHD and ASD trait
levels, but this was not as marked as in childhood. In adulthood, ADHD (both parent- and self-rated) and ASD
(parent-rated) symptoms showed associations with ADHD PRS; self-reported ADHD also showed association with
depression PRS, whereas self-reported ASD did not show strong PRS associations. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings
suggest that in young adults, ADHD and ASD symptoms have similar characteristics as they do in childhood.
Associations with other cognitive, learning and communication problems, and ADHD PRS were somewhat less
pronounced for self-reported adult ADHD and ASD symptoms, suggesting that even at age 25, parent reports, where
available, could be clinically useful. Keywords: Neurodevelopmental; attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder; autism

Introduction
Attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are viewed in DSM-
5 as neurodevelopmental disorders (American Psy-
chiatric Association, 2013): alongside other disor-
ders such as intellectual disability, speciﬁc learning
disorders and communication disorders. While
ADHD and ASD are deﬁned categorically for clinical
purposes, in population-based samples, total symp-
tom scores behave as continuously distributed traits
without clear-cut thresholds in terms of associations
with adverse outcomes (Rutter et al., 2011; Thapar &
Cooper, 2016). Childhood ADHD and ASD traits also
show associations with the same set of early envi-
ronmental and genetic risks as their respective
clinical disorders (Mandy & Lai, 2016; Robinson
et al., 2016; Thapar & Cooper, 2016). Traditionally,
because neurodevelopmental disorders have been
considered as early-life conditions, most research
has focused on children. In childhood, ADHD and
ASD traits are highly correlated with each other and
with other DSM-5 neurodevelopmental problems

intellectual disability,

(e.g.
language disorders),
show a male preponderance and are highly heritable
(Sullivan, Daly, & O’Donovan, 2012; Thapar,
Cooper, & Rutter, 2017).

More recent population-based studies have uti-
lised polygenic risk scores (PRS), an index of genetic
liability derived from genome-wide association study
(GWAS) data for different psychiatric disorders. Such
studies have observed that child ADHD and ASD
traits are associated with PRS for ADHD diagnosis
(Demontis et al., 2019; Serdarevic et al., 2020) and
that child ASD traits also are associated with both
ASD and schizophrenia PRS (St Pourcain et al.,
2018). Genome-wide association studies further
show genetic correlations between ADHD and ASD
diagnoses and that ADHD and ASD diagnoses
genetically overlap with other psychiatric disorders,
in particular depression (Demontis et al., 2019;
Grove et al., 2019) and also anxiety (in the case of
ADHD; Purves et al., 2019).

Although increasingly recognised that ADHD and
ASD extend into adult life in many cases, popula-
tion-based research into adult ADHD and ASD is
limited (Brugha et al., 2011; Brugha et al., 2012;

Kessler et al., 2006; Magiati, Tay, & Howlin, 2014;
Simon, Czobor, Balint, Meszaros, & Bitter, 2009;
Thapar & Cooper, 2016). Some research suggests
differences between these disorders in adulthood
compared with childhood. First, twin studies initially
observed lower heritability estimates for adult ADHD
and ASD symptoms compared with those reported in
childhood (Larsson et al., 2013; Polderman, Hoek-
stra, Posthuma, & Larsson, 2014; Reiersen, Con-
stantino, Grimmer, Martin, & Todd, 2008). However,
this may be due to differences in informant –
reﬂecting a switch from parent-report to self-report,
rather than due to genuine developmental differ-
ences. Consistent with this, a patient registry-based
study found similar heritability estimates for child-
hood and adulthood ADHD (Larsson, Chang,
D’Onofrio, & Lichtenstein, 2014) and a twin study
of parent-reported ASD symptoms in both childhood
and at age 18 years reported similar heritability
estimates at both ages (Taylor, Gillberg, Lichten-
stein, & Lundstr€om, 2017) – although only moderate
genetic stability was observed (rG = 0.49, CI = 0.70–
0.81). A recent GWAS of adult ADHD diagnosis
found a genetic correlation with an independent
GWAS of child ADHD to be 0.81 (SE = 0.09), sug-
gesting considerable genetic overlap, although this
study could not distinguish childhood-limited ADHD
from ADHD that persisted into adulthood (Rovira
et al., 2019).

ASD in adult life, as in childhood, appears to be
more common in males than females (Brugha et al.,
2011), whereas for ADHD, reported developmental
differences include the observation that adult ADHD
does not appear to show the same male excess
(Biederman et al., 1994), or extent of cognitive
deﬁcits (Mofﬁtt et al., 2015; Schoechlin & Engel,
2005) as childhood ADHD. However, it is not clear
whether these apparent differences also could result
issues including changes in
from methodological
informant or ADHD measure, delayed detection in
females or referral bias in adult clinic-based studies;
those with the most severe neurodevelopmental
disorders may be under-represented in healthcare
settings because they do not seek help in adult life,
or vanish into the criminal justice rather than health
system (Young et al., 2011; Young et al., 2018).
Furthermore, some individuals with adult ADHD
show a late onset (Asherson & Agnew-Blais, 2019),
and it is unclear whether this group differs from
early-onset cases with respect to sex ratio, or degree
of cognitive deﬁcit.

Our aim was to examine young adult ADHD and
ASD at age 25 years in a UK pregnancy birth cohort,
ALSPAC, using many of the same measures and
informants as were used in childhood. We set out to
investigate whether ADHD and ASD traits in young
adulthood show similar characteristics as have been
reported in childhood, by examining associations
with other neurodevelopmental problems (IQ, read-
ing and spelling ability, pragmatic language and

communication) and examining the pattern of asso-
ciations with neuropsychiatric PRS (focussing on
disorders where previous research suggests genetic
overlap in childhood: ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia,
depression and anxiety). We also explored whether
the patterns of association were different when using
self-reports as compared to parent-reports.

Method
Sample

We analysed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children (ALSPAC), a well-established prospective, longi-
tudinal birth cohort study. Details of this study are provided in
Appendix S1.

ADHD and ASD symptoms

At age 25 years, young adult ADHD symptoms were measured
using the parent-rated 5-item ADHD subscale of the Strengths
and Difﬁculties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 1997) (range:
0–10) and ASD symptoms using the parent-rated 12-item
(Skuse,
Social Communication Disorders Checklist (SCDC)
Mandy, & Scourﬁeld, 2005) (range: 0–24). Childhood ADHD
and ASD symptoms were assessed using the same parent-
rated measures at age 11/12 years. Self-rated symptom
reports from the adults themselves were additionally obtained
at age 25 years using the same 5-item subscale of the SDQ
(Goodman, 1997) for ADHD and the 50-item Autism Spectrum
Quotient (AQ) (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, &
Clubley, 2001) (range: 0–50) for ASD symptoms.

Our primary measures are continuous, although we also
report the proportion of individuals with ’high’ symptoms for
descriptive purposes. Elevated ADHD symptoms were deﬁned
using the childhood/adolescence recommended cut points of
≥8 for the parent-rated SDQ and ≥7 for the self-rated SDQ
(Goodman, 1997) as there is currently no research to guide
appropriate cut points for adult ADHD. We used the cut point
of ≥9 for the parent-rated SCDC (Skuse et al., 2005) and the
recommended ≥32 cut point for the AQ (Baron-Cohen et al.,
2001).

Other neurodevelopmental problems

Based on the DSM-5 conceptualisation of neurodevelopmental
disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), we inves-
tigated the following neurodevelopmental problems in addition
to ADHD and ASD: IQ, reading, spelling, pragmatic language
and communication.

IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children (Wechsler, Golombok, & Rust, 1992) at age 8 years.
Childhood reading ability was measured using the Wechsler
Objective Reading Dimensions (Rust, Golombok, & Trickey,
1993) and spelling ability based on 15 age-appropriate words
developed by Nunes and Bryant (Nunes, Bryant, & Bindman,
1997) at age 7 years. Childhood pragmatic language was
assessed using the parent-reported Children’s Communication
Checklist (CCC) (Bishop, 1998) at age 9 years, which is derived
as the sum of 5 subscales: inappropriate initiation, coherence,
stereotyped conversation, use of conversational context and
conversational rapport. Young adult communication was
assessed using the parent-rated Communication Checklist –
Adult (CC-A) (Whitehouse, Coon, Miller, Salisbury, & Bishop,
2010) at age 25 years, which includes the three subscales:
language structure, pragmatic skills and social engagement.
The CC-A was reverse-coded so that higher scores reﬂect better
communication skills.

Polygenic risk scores

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were generated using PRSice
version 1.25 (Euesden, Lewis, & O’Reilly, 2015) based on
GWAS of ADHD (Demontis et al., 2019), ASD (Grove et al.,
2019), schizophrenia (Pardinas et al., 2018), depression (Wray
et al., 2018) and anxiety (Purves et al., 2019). Genotyping
details as well as full methods for generating the PRS are
presented in Appendix S2.

Analyses

Individuals with parent-rated or self-rated ADHD and/or ASD
data in young adulthood were included in our analyses
(N = 6,064). Missing data were addressed by combining impu-
tation with inverse probability weighting (Seaman, White,
Copas, & Li, 2012), which is described in Appendix S3.
Sensitivity analyses using alternative methods for addressing
missing data including using multiple imputation for the full
ALSPAC sample (i.e. including those with and without young
adult data, N = 14,692), using inverse probability weighting
without multiple imputation and using complete cases are also
described in Appendix S3.

Associations between ADHD and ASD symptoms and with
other neurodevelopmental problems were examined using
separate univariable regressions with ADHD/ASD symptoms
as the outcome. Multivariable regression was used to investi-
gate associations with PRS for ADHD, ASD, schizophrenia,
depression and anxiety diagnoses simultaneously (i.e. to focus
on variance explained by the speciﬁc PRS rather than that
shared across the PRS); sensitivity analyses were conducted to
investigate associations for each of the ﬁve PRS separately.
Both unstandardised coefﬁcients (i.e. the ADHD/ASD score
increase per one unit change in the exposure variable) and

standardised (beta) coefﬁcients (i.e. the ADHD/ASD standard
deviation increase per standard deviation change in the
exposure variable: generated by standardising variables to
mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1) are presented. Sensitiv-
ity analyses were conducted stratifying analyses by sex and for
persistent/late-onset ADHD. Late-onset ADHD was deﬁned
using our previous published criterion of symptom onset after
age 12 years, based on 4 childhood assessments using the
recommended cut points (see Appendix S4) (Cooper et al.,
2018).

Results
ADHD and ASD mean scores at age 25 years and the
proportion of individuals with high symptoms (for
descriptive purposes only) are shown in Table 1.
Both parent-rated and self-rated ADHD symptoms
using the SDQ were higher in males than females

(cid:1)211). Parent-rated ADHD
CI = 0.57–0.64, p = 1 9 10
symptoms in adulthood were moderately correlated
with parent-reported ADHD and ASD symptoms at
age 11/12 years (childhood ADHD r = 0.51, 95%
(cid:1)141 and childhood ASD
CI = 0.47–0.54, p = 8 9 10
(cid:1)77), as
r = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.35–0.43, p = 1 9 10
were adult parent-rated ASD symptoms (childhood
(cid:1)48
ADHD r = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.29–0.38, p = 2 9 10
and childhood ASD r = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.38–0.48,
p = 2 9 10

(cid:1)66).

Associations between adult ADHD and ASD symp-
toms and other neurodevelopmental problems are
shown in Table 2; associations for childhood ADHD
and ASD symptoms in ALSPAC are shown in
Table S1 for comparison. At age 25 years, there
was strong evidence of both parent-rated ADHD and
ASD symptoms being associated with lower child-
hood IQ, reading and spelling ability, pragmatic
language and communication problems in adult life.
Self-rated ADHD and ASD symptoms at age
25 years were also correlated with each other
(cid:1)79) and
(r = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.33–0.40, p = 2 9 10
with other neurodevelopmental problems (also
shown in Table 2): the magnitudes of the associa-
tions were generally smaller than observed for par-
ent-rated symptoms, although for ASD symptoms
some of the conﬁdence intervals for the different
informants were overlapping.

Association with neuropsychiatric genetic risk scores

Associations with PRS are shown in Table 3. Both
parent-rated ADHD and ASD symptoms in adult-
hood were associated with ADHD PRS; associations
with childhood ADHD and ASD symptoms are shown
in Table S1 for comparison. Self-reported ADHD
symptoms were also associated with ADHD PRS but
showed additional association with depression PRS.
We did not ﬁnd strong evidence of association with
self-rated ASD
any neuropsychiatric PRS for

symptoms: neither parent- nor self-rated ASD symp-
toms were associated with higher ASD PRS. Sensi-
tivity analyses examining the ﬁve PRS separately
(univariable analyses) showed a similar pattern of
results (Table S2), with the exception that
the
association with depression and schizophrenia PRS
was stronger for parent-rated ASD symptoms when
the other PRS were not included in the model.

Sensitivity analyses: stratifying by sex and persistent/
late-onset ADHD

Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that associa-
tions observed for ADHD and ASD in our primary
analyses differed in males and females (Tables S3
and S4).

Investigating associations separately for persistent
and late-onset ADHD found somewhat stronger
associations with male sex, other neurodevelopmen-
tal problems and ADHD PRS for persistent ADHD; in
particular, self-rated late-onset ADHD was not asso-
ciated with other neurodevelopmental problems
(Tables S5 and S6), although conﬁdence intervals
were largely overlapping and given the small sample
size for the categorical deﬁnitions, statistical power
to detect association was low.

Sensitivity analyses: missing data

Male sex, other neurodevelopmental problems and
higher neuropsychiatric PRS were associated with
missing data in adulthood (Table S7). Sensitivity
analyses using different approaches to handle miss-
ing data found a similar pattern of associations
(Tables S8–S11).

Discussion
This study aimed to examine ADHD and ASD traits
in young adulthood in a UK population birth cohort.

Adult ADHD and ASD traits in the general population

453

Speciﬁcally, we explored associations with other
neurodevelopmental problems and genetic risk for
neuropsychiatric disorders using many of the same
measures and informants as were used in childhood.
For adults, parent-reported ADHD traits behaved
in a similar fashion to those reported in childhood;
we observed strong associations with current ASD
symptoms and communication problems as well as
with lower childhood IQ, reading and spelling ability
and pragmatic language. As far as we are aware,
there have been no studies of adult ADHD symptoms
that have investigated overlap with additional child-
hood neurodevelopmental problems. We also found
ADHD traits to be associated with ADHD polygenic
risk scores (PRS), without strong associations with
the other neuropsychiatric PRS. This is consistent
with previous childhood research (although this did
not investigate anxiety PRS) (Demontis et al., 2019;
Martin, Hamshere, Stergiakouli, O’Donovan, & Tha-
par, 2015; Riglin et al., 2019) and thus indicates that
parents rate a similar ADHD construct in their
offspring both in childhood and adult life. This
suggests that, where available, parents – whose
reports are typically no longer used after the age of
18 years – may still provide useful additional infor-
mation in assessment clinics when ﬁrst diagnosing
adult ADHD.

Consistent with previous work (Biederman et al.,
1994; Simon et al., 2009), we observed a weaker
association with male sex for parent-rated ADHD
symptoms at age 25 years compared with that in
childhood. Sensitivity analyses suggested this differ-
ence may be accounted for by the late-onset ADHD
group as persistent ADHD did show a male excess,
while late onset did not. In keeping with previously
reported ﬁndings in ALSPAC at age 17 years, late-
onset symptoms at age 25 years did not show the
typical
proﬁle
observed for childhood-onset persistent symptoms
(Cooper et al., 2018) but interestingly were associ-
ated with poorer parent-reported communication/
language at age 25 years.

neurodevelopmental

childhood

Self-rated ADHD symptoms also were associated
with earlier childhood neurodevelopmental prob-
lems, although less obviously so than parent-re-
ported ADHD. Also, the association between self-
rated ADHD and male sex was less marked in adult
life than what is typically reported in childhood.
However, self-rated ADHD symptoms were similar to
parent-reported ADHD symptoms in that
they
showed association with ADHD PRS. Unlike parent-
rated ADHD symptoms, they also showed associa-
tion with depression PRS. This raises the possibility
that self-endorsement of ADHD symptoms may be
associated with additional genetic liabilities or that
self-ratings are less speciﬁc than parent ratings,
although this would need further investigation.
Sensitivity analyses suggest that this could be driven
by (self-rated) late-onset ADHD, although differing

associations with PRS for different raters could also
be driven in part by rater effects in the discovery
GWAS patient samples used to derive the PRS. For
example, the ADHD and ASD PRS are derived from
primarily childhood samples which will rely more
ratings, compared with the
heavily on parent
schizophrenia, depression and anxiety PRS, which
are derived from adult samples and therefore are
based on interviews, clinical notes and self-reports,
all of which will predominantly reﬂect patient infor-
mation rather than parents.

When deﬁning categorical outcome measures, we
noted that the rate of self-reported adult ADHD was
much higher than when using parent reports, and
also higher than reported prevalence rates in epi-
demiological studies. The mean level of self-reported
(continuous) ADHD symptoms was also higher than
parent-rated symptoms, although the difference was
less pronounced than for categorical deﬁnitions
because the (childhood-based) symptom cut point
for a categorical outcome is lower for self-reports
than parent reports (Goodman, 1997). It is important
to note that we deﬁned categorical ADHD using the
recommended parent- and self-reported cut points
for childhood/adolescence (lower for self-reports),
because there is currently no recommended cut
point for adulthood. Had we used the same cut point
for self-reports as parent reports (≥8), this would
have captured 4.3% of the sample which although
still higher than the 1.2% observed when using
parent reports, is a less pronounced difference (than
9.4% using the self-report threshold of ≥7). While
some research suggests that adults with ADHD are
likely to under-report their symptoms and impair-
ment compared with parent reports (Barkley, Fis-
cher, Smallish, & Fletcher, 2002), our ﬁndings
suggest that for general population samples, self-
reported questionnaire-based measures of ADHD
may require a more stringent cut point in adult life
for deﬁning elevated symptoms, although this needs
further investigation. As our analyses focussed on
continuous measures of ADHD and ASD, the cut
point used for categorical deﬁnitions of ADHD will
not have affected our reported associations for
ADHD/ASD traits; determining the most appropriate
cut points in adulthood is nevertheless an important
area for future research.

For ASD, both parent- and self-rated adult ASD
symptoms were associated with male sex,
lower
childhood IQ, reading and spelling scores and lan-
guage and communication problems. While the
the associations were somewhat
magnitudes of
smaller for self- than parent-rated, this informant
difference was less pronounced than was observed
for ADHD symptoms – particularly for objective
measures (IQ, reading, spelling). This is despite
having different measures for each informant,
because our primary aim was to utilise parent
reports using the same measures used in childhood

and a self-reported version of the SCDC was not
available: we used the self-rated AQ. Previous work
in ASD samples has called into question the validity
of the self-rated AQ, suggesting that for some indi-
viduals, self-report responses may relate to factors
other than ASD, such as lack of interest in social
interactions (Bishop & Seltzer, 2012). While our
research does not exclude this possibility, associa-
tions between self-rated ASD symptoms and other
neurodevelopmental problems suggest that in gen-
eral population samples, self-rated ASD measures
can to some extent tap neurodevelopmental impair-
ment.

Genetic ﬁndings for continuous measures of ASD
have been mixed in previous studies, although as far
as we know PRS associations with adult ASD traits
have not been previously examined. As previously
observed in childhood, parent-rated but not self-
rated adult ASD symptoms were associated with
ADHD PRS. Again, stronger associations for parent-
rated symptoms with ADHD PRS could be partly
driven by a greater reliance on parent-rated com-
pared with self-rated symptoms in the ADHD GWAS
used to derive these PRS. Weak associations were
additionally found for both parent- and self-rated
ASD symptoms with schizophrenia and depression
PRS, with less strong evidence for anxiety PRS.
Previous work in ALSPAC in childhood has shown
association between ASD traits and schizophrenia
PRS, particularly in adolescence (St Pourcain et al.,
2018): our work suggests that strong associations
may not extend into young adulthood. Sensitivity
analyses with the PRS separately (univariable
instead of multivariable analyses) uncovered stron-
ger evidence of association with depression and
schizophrenia PRS for parent-rated ASD symptoms.
This suggests that these associations are not inde-
pendent of ADHD PRS (which is associated with
parent-rated ASD). Neither parent- or self-rated ASD
symptoms at age 25 years were associated with ASD
PRS, nor did sensitivity analyses on age 12 ASD
symptoms ﬁnd association with ASD PRS. Previous
work on children in ALSPAC reported association
with ASD PRS for this same measure of ASD at age
8 years, but not at older ages (spanning 11–
17 years), again suggesting that the genetic archi-
tecture of these traits may vary across development
(St Pourcain et al., 2018). Another potential expla-
nation for the lack of association with ASD PRS is
that the ASD measure could be capturing pheno-
typic characteristics that are not necessarily autism-
like in an adult population cohort. Our null ﬁnding
could also be due to the relatively small ASD
discovery GWAS or the characteristics of cases and
controls included in these studies:
for example,
unlike other neuropsychiatric PRS, ASD PRS are
associated with higher cognitive ability (Grove et al.,
2019). We did not investigate whether possible ’late-
onset’ ASD may have affected ﬁndings, as such cases

have not been highlighted (as they have for ADHD;
Asherson & Agnew-Blais, 2019): it was beyond the
scope of this paper to investigate age at onset in
detail, although this is a possible area for future
research.

Overall, our ﬁndings add to discussion about the
characteristics of ADHD and ASD in adulthood: we
found that these traits mainly behave similarly in
childhood and adulthood even when using scales
validated in younger populations and with the switch
to self-report in adult life. However, self-reported
ADHD in general appeared to be less strongly
associated with other neurodevelopmental prob-
lems, although late-onset ADHD may have con-
tributed to this observation. Our ﬁndings highlight
the beneﬁts of prospective studies that use the same
measures and same rater overtime and across ages:
had we only investigated self-rated symptoms in
adulthood, weaker associations with other neurode-
velopmental problems could have been attributed to
age rather than reporter. This suggests there may be
potential beneﬁts to gathering additional informa-
tion from parents, where available, about
their
young adult offspring for clinical purposes, which
merits further investigation.

Our ﬁndings should be considered in the light of
several limitations. In particular, parents included
in our sample had typically already completed
multiple questionnaires about
their offspring’s
ADHD and ASD symptoms across childhood and
adolescence (a median seven and four times for the
SDQ and SCDC, respectively), which may have
affected their ratings both through increased aware-
ness of these traits and if current ratings were
inﬂuenced by previous ratings. We were also reliant
on repeated measures of ADHD and ASD symptoms
that have yet to be validated in adulthood, including
what the optimum cut points for deﬁning high
symptoms are. Also, the constellation of symptoms
for ADHD and ASD may change with age. With
regard to the genetic liability associations, PRS
currently only explain a small proportion of genetic
liability to psychiatric disorders (Schizophrenia
Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Con-
sortium, 2014). Our sensitivity analyses investigat-
ing late-onset ADHD were underpowered and
limited by uncertainty in classiﬁcation for some
individuals (e.g. those with subthreshold childhood
symptoms): a comprehensive investigation of late-
onset symptoms was beyond the scope of this paper
and the possible differences between late-onset and
persistent adult ADHD symptoms that we observed
require further study. Like many longitudinal sam-
ples, ALSPAC also suffers from nonrandom attri-
tion, whereby individuals at elevated risk of
psychopathology and with higher neuropsychiatric
PRS are more likely to drop out of the study (Martin
et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2018). We used multiple
imputation with inverse probability weighting to try

to minimise the effect of missingness, although this
assumes that missingness is independent of the
unobserved missing data (given the variables in the
imputation model) and that the imputation model is
correctly speciﬁed. Finally, our study examined
young adulthood population ADHD and ASD traits:
while there is evidence that ADHD and ASD symp-
toms behave as continuously distributed traits
without clear-cut thresholds in terms of associa-
tions with adverse outcome (Mandy & Lai, 2016;
Robinson et al., 2016; Rutter et al., 2011; Thapar &
Cooper, 2016), this research has focused on child-
hood. It is therefore not clear whether our ﬁndings
about ADHD and ASD traits in young adulthood are
generalisable to clinical diagnoses.

Conclusion
ADHD and ASD symptoms in young adulthood
generally show a similar pattern of association with
other neurodevelopmental problems and genetic
liability to ADHD as observed in childhood; associ-
ations were somewhat weaker for self-reported adult
ADHD and ASD symptoms. These ﬁndings support
the validity of ADHD and ASD traits in adulthood
including the use of self-report, but also suggest that
where available, parent reports even at age 25 may
still be useful.

Key points

(cid:3) ADHD and ASD are now widely recognised as affecting adults.
(cid:3) Although ADHD and ASD are assumed to behave similarly in adult life as in childhood, lack of investigation

and changes in measurement/informant hinder comparisons.

(cid:3) This study examined the characteristics of parent- and self-rated adult ADHD and ASD traits in a longitudinal

population sample using many of the same parent-rated measures used in childhood.

(cid:3) Parent-rated and self-rated adult ADHD and ASD traits showed the expected overlap with lower IQ, spelling
and reading problems and language and communication difﬁculties as well as association with ADHD
genetic risk scores, a similar pattern previously reported for childhood traits.

(cid:3) Results support the validity of neurodevelopmental traits in young adulthood but also suggest potential

beneﬁts to including parent reports of ADHD.
