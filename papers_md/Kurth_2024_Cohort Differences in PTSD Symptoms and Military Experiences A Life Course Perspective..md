Abstract 
Background and Objectives: There have been major changes in military service over the past 50 years. Most research on posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) among combat Veterans comes from help-seeking Vietnam and WWII cohorts; results from more recent cohort comparisons 
are mixed. The present study addressed these gaps by exploring cohort differences among Vietnam, Persian Gulf, and Post-9/11 combat Veterans 
from a life course perspective.
Research Design and Methods: We recruited community-dwelling combat and war zone Veterans (N = 167), primarily from Veterans’ asso-
ciations in Oregon from three cohorts: Vietnam, Persian Gulf, and Post-911. Online surveys assessed current PTSD symptoms, life course 
(demographics and cohort membership), and experiential variables (combat severity, appraisals of military service, homecoming, and social 
support).

Results: Cohorts were comparable in demographics and war experiences. Step one of a hierarchical regression found that PTSD symptoms 
were higher among Veterans of color and those with lower incomes, R2 = 0.37, p < .001. When cohort was added, Vietnam Veterans had 
higher symptoms than Post-9/11; income and race/ethnicity remained significant, ΔR2 = 0.01, p = .13. The final model added experiential 
variables, ΔR2 = 0.38, p < .001; cohort and income were no longer significant, although Veterans of color still reported higher symptoms. 
Those  with  more  undesirable  service  appraisals  and  who  sought  social  support  had  higher  symptoms,  while  desirable  appraisals  were 
protective.

Discussion and Implications: From a life course perspective, the particular war zone that Veterans served in was less important than demo-
graphics and both service and postservice experiences, suggesting generalizability of risk and protective factors, as well as treatment modali-
ties, across cohorts.

Numerous changes in military service have been made over 
the past 50 years. There has been a sevenfold increase in wom-
en  service  members  (Patten  &  Parker,  2011),  who  can  now 
serve  in  combat  roles  (Vergun,  2013).  Further,  the  Veteran 
population  is  becoming  more  racially  diverse  (Department 
of Veteran Affairs  [DVA],  2018b). There  are  also  differenc-
es in military experiences. Post-Vietnam conflicts rely on the 
All-Volunteer Force, resulting in a smaller number of active- 
duty soldiers who experience more deployments (Taylor et al., 
2011), with a higher proportion in combat zones (Edwards, 
2015). However, advances in military medicine have signifi-
cantly reduced the mortality rate between WWII and more re-
cent conflicts (DVA, 2017). Thus, more soldiers return home, 
but  with  higher  rates  of  service-connected  disability  (i.e., 
Post-9/11  [43%]  vs Vietnam Veterans  [16%]; Vespa,  2020), 
which has important implications for aging Veterans.

The  incidence  of  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD) 
greatly increases with combat deployment (e.g., Brewin et al., 

2000;  National  Center  for  PTSD,  2023). These  effects  may 
last  for  several  decades  (e.g.,  Aldwin  et  al.,  2018;  Spiro  et 
al.,  1994),  underscoring  the  need  to  understand  long-term 
effects  of  service,  especially  combat  exposure  (Davison  et 
al., 2016). Most long-term studies have focused on Vietnam 
and earlier cohorts, raising questions about more recent com-
bat Veterans. Following Spiro and colleagues’ (2016) urgent 
call for studies on the long-term effects of military service in 
Vietnam  and  later  eras,  we  examined  cohort  differences  in 
demographics,  military  service,  and  postwar  factors  related 
to PTSD symptoms.

Theoretical Perspective
Spiro and colleagues’ (2016) conceptual model of long-term 
effects of military service was informed by life course theory 
(Elder et al., 2015), which focuses on the influence of socio-
historical context and cohort differences. This reflects factors

such as demographic composition of troops or social climate 
during/after  each  war  or  conflict.  Life  course  theory  postu-
lates that cohort differences often manifest through individ-
ual  differences  in  experiential  variables  (e.g.,  appraisals  of 
military service or postservice social support). Thus, current 
Veteran well-being is affected through a combination of both 
contextual and individual factors; both are examined in the 
present study to examine differences in current PTSD symp-
toms among Veterans of Vietnam, Persian Gulf, and Post-9/11 
conflicts.

Cohort Differences in PTSD
Results  are  mixed  as  to  which  cohort  (Vietnam,  Persian 
Gulf,  and  Post-9/11)  is  at  greater  risk  for  PTSD.  Boscarino 
et  al.  (2018)  found  Post-9/11 Veterans  had  the  highest  rate 
of PTSD. Others have found Vietnam Veterans are at greater 
risk  for  PTSD  (Fontana  et  al.,  2010;  Magruder  &  Yeager, 
2009).  Measurement  methods  could  account  for  differences 
between studies; items are rated slightly higher on self-report 
questionnaires than clinician-administered interviews (Resick 
et al., 2023). However, diagnoses are comparable (Franklin et 
al., 2018) and there is likewise high concordance (Bovin et al., 
2022) between DSM-IV and V versions of the PTSD check-
list (PCL). Thus, rather than measurement variability, cohort 
differences may reflect characteristics (e.g., gender) or expe-
riences (e.g., homecoming) which are associated with PTSD 
symptoms, that may differ across conflicts (Spiro et al., 2016).

Cohort Differences in Predictors of PTSD 
Symptoms
Several types of variables may affect long-term military ser-
vice outcomes (Spiro et al., 2016): the current study focused 
on some life course-related (demographics and cohort mem-
bership) and experiential (e.g., military and postmilitary ser-
vice) variables.

Demographics
Several  sociocultural  characteristics  could  confound  PTSD 
comparisons.  Like  cohort  differences,  evidence  is  mixed 
as  to  whether  older  (Goldberg,  2014)  or  younger  Veterans 
(Magruder et al., 2004) and whether women or men (Haskell 
et  al.,  2010;  Turner  et  al.,  2007)  have  more  PTSD.  Among 
women,  Vietnam  Veterans  had  higher  levels  of  PTSD  diag-
noses  than  Persian  Gulf  and  Post-9/11  Veterans  (Fontana 
et  al.,  2010),  perhaps  because  they  are  more  likely  to  have 
delayed-onset PTSD (Schnurr et al., 2003). Third, Veterans of 
color seem at greater risk for PTSD (for reviews, see Brewin 
et  al.,  2000;  Xue  et  al.,  2015),  which  could  reflect  racism 
and other trauma during service (e.g., Carlson et al., 2018). 
Finally, Veterans with higher income and education reported 
fewer  symptoms  (Goldberg  et  al.,  2014;  Magruder  et  al., 
2004;  Xue  et  al.,  2015).  Thus,  some  of  the  varying  results 
in  cohort  differences  could  reflect  whether  and  how  demo-
graphic factors were analyzed.

Military Experiences
Combat severity
Combat exposure, a risk factor for PTSD (see Xue et al., 2015), 
varies by cohort. For example, 92% of Post-9/11 and 44% of 
Vietnam  Veterans  self-reported  combat  exposure  (Edwards, 

2015). The severity of combat is also a risk factor for PTSD (see 
Able & Benedek, 2019), which reflects the frequency of vari-
ous combat experiences, such as being under fire (e.g., King et 
al., 2006). Indeed, Boscarino and colleagues (2018) found high 
combat severity was a risk factor for PTSD and was associated 
with different PTSD diagnostic groups (Khan et al., 2023).

Appraisal of service
Appraisals of military experiences, which reflect perceptions 
of  service  experiences  (Settersten  et  al.,  2018),  also  predict 
PTSD  symptoms.  Positive  appraisals  (e.g.,  made  lifelong 
friends)  were  protective  against  stressful  service  experiences 
and  PTSD  symptoms  for  Vietnam  Veterans  (Dohrenwend 
et  al.,  2004).  Negative  appraisals  (e.g.,  lonely  for  my  fam-
ily) were associated with more symptoms among WWII and 
Korea-era Veterans (e.g., Aldwin et al., 1994; Lee et al., 2017). 
To our knowledge, there are no studies which compare these 
appraisals among post-Vietnam cohorts.

Postmilitary Experiences
Homecoming
Homecoming experiences reflect the degree to which Veterans 
felt accepted by and could reintegrate into civilian communi-
ties. Negative experiences in Vietnam-Post-9/11 cohorts were 
associated with high PTSD symptom levels (Bosacarino et al., 
2018;  Han  et  al.,  2014;  Steenkamp  et  al.,  2017),  although 
few studies have compared experiences across conflicts, espe-
cially  in  recent  cohorts.  Vietnam  Veterans  had  much  lower 
support than post-Vietnam conflicts (Boscarino et al., 2018), 
although approval for both Vietnam and Post-9/11 conflicts 
decreased across time (Rosentiel, 2009). Societal rejection for 
both cohorts was associated with (lack of) treatment  initia-
tion for PTSD (Sayer et al., 2009).

Social support
Talking with a spouse about service experiences was associ-
ated with more desirable appraisals of service for WWII and 
Korean Veterans (Settersten et al., 2018). PTSD was lower for 
Vietnam,  Persian  Gulf,  and  Post-9/11  Veterans  when  social 
support  was  high  (Steenkamp  et  al.,  2017;  Wright  et  al., 
2013). However, only two studies to our knowledge directly 
compared Vietnam Veterans  with  later  cohorts,  with  mixed 
results. Boscarino et al. (2018) found no cohort differences, 
whereas Fontana et al. (2010) found that women from more 
recent  cohorts  reported  more  support;  neither  examined 
associations  with  PTSD  symptoms.  However,  support  seek-
ing may be associated with poorer outcomes, as distress may 
lead to seeking others out or may simply reflect rumination 
(Monroe & Steiner, 1986).

Present Study
We  examined  current  PTSD  symptoms  (i.e.,  long-term  out-
comes) among combat Veterans of Vietnam, Persian Gulf, and 
Post-9/11 eras. Reliance on clinical samples and/or failure to 
control for demographics may account for different findings 
regarding cohort differences. To our knowledge, this is one of 
the  few  studies  that  recruited  community-dwelling Veterans 
from these cohorts (but see Boscarino et al., 2018; Magruder 
& Yeager,  2009).  Cohort  effects  may  be  expressed  through 
differences in individual experiences (Elder et al., 2015); thus, 
we took a life course approach to the following two research 
questions.

The Gerontologist, 2024, Vol. 64, No. 2

RQ1: Are  there  cohort  differences  in  (a)  life  course  vari-
ables (e.g., demographics); (b) experiential variables (e.g., 
perceptions  of  combat  severity,  [un]desirable  service  ap-
praisals,  and  homecoming  experiences);  and  (c)  PTSD 
symptoms?
RQ2:  Are  life  course  and  experiential  variables  related 
to PTSD symptoms? Does cohort predict symptoms con-
trolling for demographics, and are the effects of life course 
variables  attenuated  once  experiential  variables  entered 
into the model?

Method
Procedure and Sample
The  purpose  of  the Veterans Aging:  Longitudinal  studies  in 
Oregon (VALOR) is to understand long-term effects of mili-
tary service across three cohorts of aging Veterans. To recruit 
a  wide  range  of  community-dwelling  Veterans,  we  solic-
ited  the  aid  of  several  organizations,  including  the  Oregon 
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (ODVA),  a  subject  pool 
of  older  Oregonians  aged  50+,  and  a  Military  and Veteran 
Resource  Center’s  newsletter,  which  was  managed  at  a 
university.

We  collected  data  through  an  online  survey  (Qualtrics, 
2019). Eligibility criteria was service in one of three cohorts 
and quotas were set to 100 participants in each (due to fund-
ing restrictions): Vietnam, Persian Gulf, and Post-9/11 (quota 
was 50 Veterans in this cohort, as another focus of VALOR 
was  military  couples).  The  analytic  sample,  N  =  167,  was 
restricted to only to those who self-reported combat exposure 
or  service  in  a  war  zone  (70%  of  original  sample),  as  they 

Table 1.  Sociodemographic Characteristics of Combat Veterans by War Era

were  the  only  participants  who  completed  the  experiential 
items  (e.g.,  service  appraisals).  Veterans  were  compensated 
for their participation. This study was approved by the uni-
versity’s Institutional Review Board.

Oregon has a higher percentage of Veterans than the United 
States (10% vs 6.6%; DVA, 2018a). Our sample was slightly 
higher  than  Oregon  Veterans  in  race/ethnicity  (Veterans  of 
color: 13% vs 9%), the proportion of women (31% vs 8%), 
and completion of at least a bachelor’s degree (51% vs 29%). 
We  had  fewer  Veterans  over  the  age  of  65  (35%  vs  51%; 
DVA, 2018b; US Census Bureau, n.d.). See Table 1 for demo-
graphics by cohort.

Measures
PTSD symptoms
The 20-item PTSD checklist (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) 
is validated for use with Veteran samples (Wortmann et al., 
2016) and assessed symptoms over the last month. Items were 
rated on a 5-point scale, from (0) not at all to (4) extremely 
(if the latter, a pop-up screen of crisis hotline contact infor-
mation appeared). Symptoms were summed (M = 18.14, SD 
= 17.53, α = .98) and the distribution was nonnormal. A sub-
set  of  the  ladder  powers  for  transformation  (version  15.1; 
StataCorp,  2017)  suggested  the  square-root  transformation 
was  the  best  fit;  scores  were  transformed  (M  =  3.07,  SD  = 
2.07).

into less than bachelor’s or bachelor’s degree or higher), and 
income.  Race  (White,  Black/African  American,  American 
Indian/Alaska  Native,  Asian,  Pacific  Islander,  Other)  and 
ethnicity  (Spanish,  Hispanic,  or  Latino)  were  combined  to 
categorize race/ethnicity; participants who selected identities 
other than White and non-Hispanic/Spanish/Latino were cat-
egorized as Veterans of color (e.g., White Hispanic, biracial, 
multiracial; n = 21).

Cohort
We  used Wilmoth  et  al.  (2018)  recommendations  for  defin-
ing  cohorts:  Vietnam  (August  1964–April  1975),  Gulf  War 
(August 1990–August 2001), and Post-9/11 (September 2001 
or later).

Experiential Variables
Combat severity
The  15-item  combat  experience  subscale  (CES)  assessed 
combat intensity, from (0) never to (4) daily or almost daily 
(King  et  al.,  2006).  Items  were  summed  and  higher  scores 
suggested more extensive combat (M = 21.5, SD = 9.19, α 
= .91).

Appraisals of service
A total of 27 items on a 4-point scale, from (0) not at all to 
(3) a lot (Aldwin et al., 1994; Elder & Clipp, 1989) captured 
perceptions of service; higher summed scores reflected more 
desirable  or  undesirable  appraisals,  respectively. There  were 
14 desirable (e.g., learned to cope with adversity; (M = 34.77, 
SD = 4.71; α = .83) and 13 undesirable items (M = 11.62, SD 
= 9.04, α = .94; one was dropped [bad memories/nightmares] 
for overlap with a PTSD symptom).

The undesirable subscale was not normally distributed and 
had  high  collinearity  with  PTSD  symptoms  (r  =  .85). After 
examining  scatterplots,  clusters  were  visible  that  inflated 
the  correlation;  thus,  we  utilized  a  k-means  cluster  analysis 
using PROC FASTCLUS (SAS, 2019; for more information, 
see Supplementary Material, Section A). A three-cluster solu-
tion was selected based on pseudo-f statistics (Supplementary 
Table 1) and cluster differentiation. The clusters had distinc-
tive profiles (Supplementary Figure 1), with generally low (n = 
91; Mundesirable = 4.09, SD = 1.74, moderate (n = 51; Mundesirable = 
16.92, SD = 2.46), and high ratings (n = 24; Mundesirable = 24.52, 
SD = 3.34). These varied from a trichotomy based on mean 
rating,  as  the  moderate  cluster  scored  similarly  to  the  high 
profile on service experiences and loss of friends, but lower 
on other items.

Homecoming experiences
Five  items  captured  community  support  and  perceptions  of 
service  (e.g.,  Readjusting  to  civilian  life  was  more  difficult 
than most people imagine; Lee et al., 1995). Items were rated 
on a 4-point scale from (1) strongly disagree to (4) strongly 
agree, and summed; higher scores reflect positive homecom-
ing (M = 15.39, SD = 3.27, α = .83).

Social support
Five items assessed the frequency (0 = not applicable to 4 = 
frequently) with which Veterans talked about military expe-
riences with their parents, spouse, children, and friends with 
and without military experience (Aldwin et al., 1994). Higher 
summed scores reflected more discussion of military experi-
ences (M = 12.23, SD = 2.98).

Analytic Plan
Differences among cohorts (χ2, Fisher exact test, or ANOVA) 
were  tested  using  SAS  software  (SAS,  2014).  A  three-block 
hierarchical  regression  (in  Mplus;  Muthén  &  Muthén, 
2017) tested if PTSD symptoms varied by life course (block 
1  included  demographics;  block  2  added  cohort)  and  expe-
riential  variables  (block  3  added  military  and  post-service 
experiences). These blocks tested whether there were cohort 
differences  above  and  beyond  demographics  and  whether 
any  differences  could  be  explained  by  individual  experi-
ences.  Confidence  intervals  (CI)  were  set  to  95%.  Multiple 
imputation  and  maximum  likelihood  estimation  were  used 
to  account  for  the  small  amount  (≤3%)  of  missing  predic-
tor values. A sensitivity analysis (G*Power; Faul et al., 2007) 
showed  the  final  model  was  powered  at  .95  to  detect  small 
effect sizes, f2 (13, 153) = 0.17.

Results
RQ1: Cohort Differences in Demographics and 
Military Experiences
Cohorts significantly varied in age and educational attainment 
(see Table 1). Vietnam was older than Persian Gulf, who were 
older  than  the  Post-9/11  Veterans  (all  post  hoc  ps  <  .001). 
A higher proportion of Persian Gulf Veterans completed col-
lege than Post-9/11 Veterans, post hoc p < .01; Vietnam and 
Post-9/11  Veterans  were  similar.  There  were  no  differences 
in (post-) service or PTSD symptoms. We also computed the 
rate of current PTSD caseness, which was 17% (cutoff of 33; 
National Center for PTSD, 2022). There were no significant 
differences between cohorts, X2(2) = 0.94, p = .63 (Vietnam = 
13%, Persian Gulf = 18%, Post-9/11 = 21%).

RQ2: Life Course, Experiential Variables, and PTSD 
Symptoms
Table  2  presents  correlations  among  study  variables.  Older 
Veterans reported more desirable experiences but sought less 
social  support.  Men  were  more  likely  than  women  to  com-
plete  higher  education  but  also  reported  significantly  lower 
desirable appraisals, social support, and worse homecoming 
experiences. Veterans  with  higher  incomes  were  more  likely 
to be married and had more positive service and postservice 
experiences. Veterans of color were younger, more likely to be 
men,  reported  lower  income,  perceived  less  positive  service 
appraisals, and had worse homecoming experiences.

Men  and  Veterans  of  color  reported  significantly  higher 
PTSD  symptoms,  while  those  with  higher  income  reported 
fewer symptoms. Combat severity and the moderate and high 
undesirable  appraisal  variables  were  positively  associated 
with PTSD symptoms, while desirable appraisals and better 
homecoming experiences were inversely associated.

Most  of  these  bivariate  relationships  were  mirrored  in 
the hierarchical regression (Table 3). Model 1 contained the 
demographics  and  explained  37%  of  PTSD  symptom  vari-
ance. Veterans  of  color,  B  =  2.73,  95%  CI  [2.00,  3.46]  and 
those with lower incomes, B = −0.24 [−0.49, −0.18], endorsed 
higher symptom severity.

Model 2 added cohort membership, with Vietnam-era serv-
ing  as  the  reference  group;  model  fit  was  not  significantly 
improved, ∆R2 = 0.01, p = .13. Veterans of color and those 
with  lower  income  still  reported  more  symptoms.  Further, 
only Post-9/11 Veterans had lower PTSD symptoms than the 
Vietnam cohort, B = −1.83 [−3.31, −0.36].

Notes: Relationships between cohort and the study variables were presented in Table 1. CES = Combat exposure severity; High_undes = high undesirable 
appraisal cluster; Mod_undes = moderate undesirable appraisal cluster; PTSD = posttraumatic stress disorder; VOC = Veterans of color. PTSD symptoms 
were square-root transformed.
*p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.

Model 3 included the experiential variables, improving the 
model  fit  considerably  (∆R2  =  0.37,  p  <  .001).  Veterans  of 
color still reported higher PTSD symptoms, although income 
and cohort were no longer significant. Veterans who reported 
fewer  desirable  appraisals  had  higher  levels  of  PTSD  symp-
toms B = −0.82 [−0.13, −0.03]. Those in the moderate, B = 
2.34  [1.80,  2.67],  and  high  undesirable  clusters,  B  =  2.91 
[2.11, 3.72], reported higher symptoms than the low group. 
Those who sought more social support had higher symptoms, 
B = 0.10 [0.02, 0.17].

Discussion
The  present  study  took  a  life  course  approach  to  exam-
ine  cohort  differences  in  current  PTSD  symptoms  using  a  
community-dwelling Veteran sample to disentangle the rela-
tionships among age, cohort, demographics, and military and 
postmilitary experiences.

Despite  the  dramatic  historical  change  in  military  service 
across cohorts, the similarity in demographics and experiences 
across these combat and war zone Veterans was surprising. For 
example, there are higher proportions of women in the more 
recent cohorts, as they can now serve in more combat-related 
roles (Vergun, 2013). However, we included individuals who 
served  in  war  zones,  and  our  female Vietnam Veterans  were 
likely nurses in those zones (e.g., Pless-Kaiser et al., 2017).

Unlike  Boscarino  et  al.  (2018),  military  and  postservice 
experiences  were  similar  across  cohorts,  despite  different 
historical contexts. For example, we did not find cohort dif-
ferences in severity of combat exposure, perhaps because we 
included  war  zone  experience. Although  we  found  a  signif-
icant  inverse  correlation  between  homecoming  and  PTSD 
symptoms, supporting Boscarino et al., this became nonsignif-
icant in the multivariate analyses, perhaps because homecom-
ing was strongly positively correlated with positive appraisals 
of  military  service,  and  inversely  correlated  with  negative 
appraisals.

Similar to that found in older cohorts (Aldwin et al., 1994; 
Settersten  et  al.,  2018),  our  Veterans  frequently  reported 

positive  aspects  of  service  but  readily  acknowledged  nega-
tive  aspects.  Further,  positive  aspects  were  strongly  protec-
tive against PTSD symptoms, whereas the inverse pattern was 
found with negative appraisals.

Like  Boscarino  et  al.  (2018),  we  found  no  cohort  differ-
ences  in  social  support  frequency.  Although  the  correlation 
between seeking social support and PTSD symptoms was not 
significant, it became positively associated in the multivariate 
analyses. Inspection of the correlation matrix showed that it 
was significantly associated with both positive appraisals and 
moderately  undesirable  appraisals,  suggesting  that  seeking 
social support may have different effects, depending upon its 
use (i.e., positive support vs rumination).

Similarly,  we  found  no  cohort  differences  in  PTSD  symp-
toms in the bivariate analyses. However, in the multivariate 
analyses  controlling  for  demographics,  Post-9/11  Veterans 
had  significantly  lower  symptoms  than  Vietnam  Veterans, 
similar  to  other  community-dwelling  samples  (Boscarino  et 
al., 2018; Magruder & Yeager, 2009). Thus, the mixed find-
ings  on  cohort  differences  in  PTSD  symptoms  may  be  due 
to  a  lack  of  controlling  for  demographic  differences  and/or 
differences in which demographics were utilized.

All  demographic  and  cohort  differences  became  nonsig-
nificant when experiential variables were entered (Boscarino 
et  al.,  2018),  with  the  exception  of  race/ethnicity.  Veterans 
of  color  consistently  reported  higher  PTSD  symptoms  than 
non-Hispanic  Whites.  Veterans  of  color  seek  mental  health 
services  at  a  lower  rate,  citing  discrimination  as  one  reason 
(e.g., Miller et al., 2023), which is associated with PTSD (e.g., 
Carlson et al., 2018; Kirkins et al., 2018).

The  final  model  included  service  appraisals  and  postser-
vice  experiences  that  appeared  central  to  PTSD  symptoms. 
Veterans  with  more  undesirable  (Aldwin  et  al.,  1994;  Lee 
et  al.,  2017)  and  fewer  desirable  appraisals  reported  higher 
symptoms. The cross-sectional nature of the design precludes 
ascribing  causality,  as  PTSD  symptoms  could  influence  ser-
vice appraisals. However, similar studies in Korea and WWII 
Veterans  (Aldwin  et  al.,  1994)  and  South  Korean  Vietnam 
Veterans (Lee et al., 2022) controlled for reporting biases and

the  associations  between  appraisals  of  military  service  and 
PTSD symptoms and/or well-being were still significant.

Limitations and Future Research
Although this study used community-dwelling Veterans and 
a  strong  theoretical  perspective,  there  were  several  limita-
tions. First, online surveys were used, limiting participation to 
Veterans with internet access. Older adults (65+) had the low-
est rate of internet usage/connection among all adult groups, 
but  it  was  higher  among  those  with  higher  incomes  (Pew 
Research Center, 2021). Therefore, the Vietnam sample might 
reflect older, advantaged Veterans. Future research should aim 
to recruit older participants from other sources, such as senior 
centers and Veteran service organizations.

Second,  a  more  ethnically  diverse  sample  may  have  pro-
duced  different  results,  as  we  had  fewer  Veterans  of  color 

than  nationally  (12%  vs  23%;  Vespa,  2020),  but  slightly 
more than among Oregon Veterans. Concerned over sample 
selectivity,  we  calculated  the  overall  PTSD  rate  using  stan-
dard criteria, which was 22%, comparable to other Veteran 
samples and our cohorts (National Center for PTSD, 2022). 
To  our  knowledge,  this  is  one  of  the  first  studies  to  exam-
ine  race/ethnicity  differences  in  appraisals  among  recent 
cohorts. Given the associations with PTSD symptoms, it will 
be important to consider these factors for long-term health 
of the increasingly racially diverse Veteran population (DVA, 
2018b).

Third, the cross-sectional design makes causal directionality 
impossible  to  determine.  PTSD  symptoms  might  reflect  war 
experiences (Davison et al., 2016) or recent events from the 
past month. For example, Veterans often select first-responding  
careers (Armed Forces Benefit Association, 2019), which may 
further expose them to trauma. Nonetheless, military service

experiences  are  important  to  consider  for Veterans’  current 
well-being (e.g., Sachs-Ericcson et al., 2016). Future research 
could  disentangle  this  with  a  cohort-sequential  research 
design.

Conclusion and Implications
War  and  combat  experiences  have  changed  dramatically  in 
the  past  50  years,  putting  into  question  whether  the  under-
standing of PTSD gained from studies of older cohorts is gen-
eralizable  to  more  current  ones.  In  this  study,  psychosocial 
experiences  during  and  postservice,  especially  desirable  and 
undesirable appraisals, had the largest effects on current men-
tal health (along with race/ethnicity), which was similar across 
cohorts,  suggesting  that  the  original  findings  do  generalize 
to  current  cohorts.  Further,  these  appraisals  are  apparently 
stable across several decades (WWII; Settersten et al., 2012), 
suggesting an interesting possibility for therapeutic interven-
tion.  Cohort  sequential  designs  of  the  long-term  impacts  of 
combat exposure are crucial to understand the positive and 
negative effects of military service in late life.
