There's no quick and simple treatment for schizophrenia. You might find your symptoms never go away completely. Everyone is different.

But with the right treatment and support it's possible to manage your symptoms.

Over time you can learn ways of coping. This can make your symptoms less distressing, so they don't interfere with your life so much.

This page covers:

- Early intervention (EI) teams

- Talking therapies

- Antipsychotic medication

- Hospital treatment

This page is part of our guide to:

If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency.

I was so disconnected from the world. I went to see a doctor who finally diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I was prescribed medication and I started to look forward to recovery and stability.


## Early intervention (EI) teams


Early intervention (EI) teams work with you during your first experience of symptoms such as psychosis.

You can usually be referred to an EI team by your GP, or you can sometimes self-refer. If you're referred to the EI team, you should be seen and assessed as soon as possible.

They usually include a group of people who can help you in different ways. For example, depending on the service, an EI team might give you:

- Information to help you understand what you're experiencing

- Talking therapies and access to medication

- Regular physical health checks and monitoring

- The opportunity to develop a crisis plan

- A care coordinator who can support with any health and social care needs

- Support with employment, training or education

- Support for friends, family and carers

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)says EI services should be open to people of all ages. But some places only offer services to people between certain ages. Some services only work with people between the ages of 14 to 65, for example.


## Talking therapies


Talking therapies can help you understand your experiences. And develop coping strategies to deal with them. Some therapy might be more effective at treating symptoms when combined with antipsychotic medication.

Talking therapies for schizophrenia should focus on helping you recognise and cope with your symptoms.

The type of talking therapy your doctor may offer you includes CBT, family intervention and arts therapies.


### Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)


CBT teaches you coping skills for dealing with different problems.

You will work with a therapist to think about how your thoughts or beliefs affect your symptoms. It can help you find different ways to cope with them and improve your quality of life.

For more information, see our page onCBT.

I was very lucky to get referred to cognitive behavioural therapy, which I found very useful in developing coping strategies and learning to live with my illness.


### Family intervention


Experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia can sometimes impact those closest to you.

Family intervention focuses on supporting you together with your family members, friends, partners or carers. You talk to each other about what helps, solving problems and planning for a crisis.

Arts therapies can help you express how you're feeling in different ways and at a pace that suits you. They can help you learn new ways of relating to other people.

Some people find it satisfying to be able to visually show their experience.

Our page onarts and creative therapieshas more information.


## Antipsychotic medication


Your doctor is likely to offer youantipsychotic medicationas a way of managing symptoms.

They may also offer you other drugs if you experience mood symptoms. For exampleantidepressantsormood stabilisers. And they might offer you more medication to help reduce any side effects.

Medication for schizophrenia affects people in different ways. Some people find it helps reduce symptoms of psychosis. Others don't feel much better.

Doctors recommend that you take antipsychotics for between 1 and 2 years to help stop your symptoms coming back.

Smoking, or stopping smoking can change the effects of antipsychotic drugs. If you decide to stop smoking, you should talk to a healthcare professional. They can support you to do this safely. You may need to change the dose of some medications.


### If you want to come off your medication


At some point, you might decide you want to come off your medication. Perhaps because you feel better. Or because of side effects.

Butit's very important not to stop medication suddenly. This can cause serious withdrawal symptoms. It's safest to reduce your dose slowly.It's a good idea to speak to your doctor or care team first if you want to come off your meds. Even if you think you don't need medication anymore.

Our page oncoming off medicationhas more advice.


## Hospital treatment


If you're in crisis, sometimes staying in hospital might be the best way to keep you safe. And give you the level of treatment you need.
