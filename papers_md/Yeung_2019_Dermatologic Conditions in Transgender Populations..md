Synopsis

Transgender persons face unique burdens of dermatologic conditions related to cutaneous effects 
of gender-affirming hormone therapy and procedures. Skin diseases in transgender patients often 
underdiagnosed and underrecognized despite potential for significant impairments quality of life 
and mental health from skin diseases. We discuss basic pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment 
of common skin diseases in the transgender populations. For transmasculine patients, common 
conditions include acne vulgaris and male pattern hair loss. For transfeminine patients, common 
conditions include hirsutism, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and melasma. Post-procedural keloids and 
other cutaneous complications are discussed. Unique aspects of skin health in transgender persons 
should be considered in the context of multidisciplinary gender-affirming care.

Introduction

Transgender persons, particularly those receiving gender-affirming hormone and/or surgical 
treatments, may face specific dermatologic concerns. Hormone therapies and gender-
affirming procedures can affect the skin and change the prevalence and presentation of 
routine skin conditions. Transgender patients with dermatologic disease may face body 
image dissatisfaction, which is closely tied to levels of gender dysphoria, anxiety, 
depression, and other secondary health problems.1 Transgender patients also face greater 
barriers to care and often benefit from a comprehensive approach to care from providers they 
do see.2 Therefore, it is important for clinicians caring for transgender persons should 
recognize and address common dermatologic conditions relevant to gender-affirming

treatments. We will review the clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of skin 
conditions common in transgender patients, particularly for transmasculine and 
transfeminine patients undergoing gender-affirming endocrine or surgical therapies, as well 
as indications for dermatology referral.

Hormone therapy

Gender-affirming hormone therapy for transmasculine persons consists of testosterone to 
develop secondary male sex characteristics.3 In the skin, testosterone increases sebum 
production, increases facial and body hair growth, decreases scalp hair, and redistributes 
body fat (Table 1).3 Gender-affirming hormone therapy for transfeminine persons consists of 
estrogen and/or antiandrogens such as spironolactone in the USA and cyproterone in most of 
Europe and GnRH agonists in the UK.4 In the skin, estrogen decreases skin sebum 
production, reduces facial and body hair growth, promotes epidermal thickness, stimulates 
melanocytes, and changes sweat and odor pattern.3,5 Masculinizing and feminizing effects in 
the skin may be observed within one month of hormone therapy initiation but may not reach 
maximum effect until a few years later.3

Common Transmasculine Skin Conditions

Acne vulgaris

Acne vulgaris is a common and chronic skin disease characterized by the formation of 
comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts.6 Clogged 
hair follicles, increased skin sebum production, and the inflammatory response incited by 
Propionibacterium acnes contribute to the development of acne.7 Acne is frequently driven 
by androgens.8-10 Other risk factors may include chest binding, diet, stress, and medications 
– such as corticosteroids and lithium.8,11

Acne often impacts the psychosocial health of affected individuals.12 Conspicuous acne 
lesions, secondary post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scars can be disfiguring and 
stigmatizing (Figure 1). Patients with acne experience higher rates of low self-esteem, 
depression, and withdrawal from social activities and relationships.13 A survey of 3,775 
18-19 year-old young adults found those with significant acne were more likely to have 
suicidal ideation and mental health problems as compared with those without acne.14 Sexual 
minority patients with acne were shown to also have increased risks of suicidal ideation and 
antidepressant use as compared with sexual minority patients without acne.15

This is particularly relevant due to high rates of acne with testosterone therapy.11 For 
example, one study of 21 transmasculine adults found 94% had facial acne and 88% back 
acne after four months of testosterone therapy, an increase from pre-treatment rates of 29% 
and 17%, respectively.16 While the natural history of hormone therapy-induced acne remains 
poorly understood, small studies suggest that acne severity often peaks in the first six 
months of testosterone therapy and may gradually improve over 1-2 years.17-19 The 
psychosocial effects of acne may compound gender dysphoria and high pre-existing rates of 
psychiatric comorbidity in transgender patients.20,21 Since clinicians often underestimate the 
patients’ negative experience and impact from acne, signs and symptoms of acne should be

inquired and addressed, and treated if symptomatic, even if considered mild based on the 
clinician’s initial impression.21

Acne severity should direct initial therapy (Figure 2).22 The Investigator Global Assessment 
severity scale (Table 2) is a commonly used tool to classify acne as clear, almost clear, mild, 
moderate, or severe. Acne with cysts, nodules, or significant scarring is often treated as 
severe.22 First-line therapy for mild acne is a topical retinoid, topical benzoyl peroxide, or a 
combination of the two.7 Topical retinoids, such as tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene, are 
comedolytic and anti-inflammatory agents that serve as the core of acne therapy.7 They help 
resolve precursor microcomedone lesions and improve secondary scarring and 
hyperpigmentation.23 Topical adapalene 0.1% gel is now available over-the-counter and may 
be considered for patients whose insurance plans do not cover topical retinoids. Common 
side effects of topical retinoids include photosensitivity, skin dryness, peeling, erythema, and 
irritation. Side effects are minimized by slow up-titration and typically peak in the first 2-4 
weeks of use, improving over time. Anticipatory guidance is crucial to improve adherence 
and prevent premature treatment discontinuation.23 Patients should be counseled to apply a 
small pea-size amount every 2-3 nights, then gradually increase frequency to nightly over 
2-4 weeks as tolerated, with concurrent daily moisturizer and sunscreen use.7 Benzoyl 
peroxide (BP, available over the counter in 2.5%-10% washes, creams, or gels) is effective 
for mild to moderate inflammatory acne. It can be used as monotherapy or in combination 
with various concentrations of topical clindamycin or erythromycin and/or topical retinoids. 
Notably, current guidelines do not recommend topical antibiotic monotherapy without BP 
due to emerging bacterial resistance. For moderate acne, combination topical therapy with 
BP +/− topical antibiotics +/− topical retinoids should be initially used. Systemic antibiotics 
– most commonly oral doxycycline or minocycyline – should also be considered for 
moderate to severe acne. Oral antibiotics should be limited to the shortest possible duration 
(<3 months). Concurrent topical therapy is crucial to sustain acne improvement following 
antibiotic tapering. Patients with moderate to severe acne, as well as those with significant 
postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or scarring, should be referred to dermatology for 
aggressive treatment to prevent further scarring or disfiguration.

Oral isotretinoin has been effective at treating severe, refractory, or nodulocystic hormone-
induced acne in transgender patients without interfering with testosterone dosing.18 
Isotretinoin is a potent teratogen and all U.S. patients are required to registered in the 
iPLEDGE system by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Isotretinoin patients with 
reproductive potential must concurrently use 2 forms of effective contraception and undergo 
monthly pregnancy tests and counseling with their isotretinoin prescriber. Unfortunately, 
iPLEDGE currently enforces a gender-binary patient classification system requiring patients 
to be registered and provided contraception management based on sex assigned at birth 
rather than focusing on anatomic inventory and sexual behaviors with reproductive potential.
24 Gender-neutral reform of the iPLEDGE system has been advocated. Notably, isotretinoin 
may be associated with increased risks of depression and suicidality, as well as delayed 
surgical wound healing for up to 6-12 months after isotretinoin completion. 
Multidisciplinary care coordination among dermatologists, mental health providers, 
gynecologists, endocrinologists, and/or surgeons is crucial.

Male Pattern Hair Loss / Androgenetic alopecia

Male pattern hair loss (MPHL), also known as androgenetic or androgenic alopecia, is the 
most common cause of progressive hair loss. The multifactorial causes include age, 
androgens, and genetic predisposition.25 In cisgender men, MPHL is associated with 
anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction.26

MPHL is characterized by hair loss in the temporal scalp, midfrontal scalp, or vertex area of 
the scalp in a “horseshoe” pattern. The mid-occipital region is mostly unaffected.27 
Circulating 5α-dihydroxytestosterone (DHT), converted from testosterone by 5α-reductase, 
interacts with androgen receptors in hair follicles. DHT miniaturizes scalp hair follicles and 
shortens the anagen stage that is the primary growth stage of hair, resulting in progressively 
decreasing hair coverage of the scalp.28 Concomitant nail pitting, scalp itch, or focal hair 
loss beyond the scalp vertex may warrant dermatology referral.28

Hormone-induced MPHL presents similarly in transmasculine patients as in cisgender men. 
It often begins a few years after initiation of testosterone.17,29 A cross-sectional study of 50 
transmasculine patients showed mild to severe hair-loss in 62% of the participants on long-
term testosterone; only one transmasculine person acquired MPHL within the first year of 
therapy.17 MPHL may be a desirable masculine feature for some TM patients, but unwanted 
by others.30

Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are first-line therapies for MPHL.29 Topical minoxidil 
(brand name Rogaine), a potent vasodilator, is available over-the-counter for men as a 5% 
solution or foam. It is safe for long-term use and improves hair survival, increases the 
duration of the anagen growth phase, revitalizes hair-keratin proteins, and decreases 
inflammatory signals on the scalp.31-33 In one study, 51% of patients noted benefit from 5% 
minoxidil compared to 26% with placebo and significantly higher hair count was noted in 
the minoxidil group.34 Side effects may include scalp irritation, dryness, itching, and 
redness. Patients with MPHL refractory to minoxidil should be referred to a dermatologist 
for more extensive treatment. Oral finasteride, an FDA-approved treatment for MPHL, is a 
competitive inhibitor of type II 5α-reductase enzyme on hair follicles to inhibit conversion 
of testosterone to DHT. It improves scalp coverage in cis-men, one meta-analysis suggested 
a 25% increase in hair counts.26,35,36 It does not interfere with serum testosterone level in 
transmasculine patients but effects on secondary sex characteristics are still unclear.30,37 
Some have suggested that finasteride should be delayed until all desired gender-affirming 
changes secondary to hormone therapy are complete (usually after two years of testosterone 
therapy).30 Finasteride was safe and effective in one study of 10 transmasculine patients.37 
Side effects of finasteride may include teratogenicity, sexual dysfunction, depression, breast 
enlargement, and the potential to mask elevations in PSA.25

Common Transfeminine Dermatologic Conditions

Hirsutism / Pseudofolliculitis barbae

Estrogen and antiandrogen treatments generally do not cause cessation of facial hair growth.
38 Facial hair is visually prominent and common male secondary sex characteristic that is 
associated with body image dissatisfaction in transfeminine persons.39 Facial hirsutism in

transfeminine persons can be disfiguring and contribute to gender dysphoria. Hair removal is 
considered medically necessary for transfeminine persons suffering from associated gender 
dysphoria40. Additionally, hair removal is important prior to genital gender-affirming 
surgeries. Hair follicles on surgically inverted skin flaps can lead to postoperative intra-
vaginal or intra-urethral hair growth and serve as a nidus for irritation and infection.30 Mild 
hirsutism can be treated with shaving, plucking, threading, waxing, or topical eflornithine 
(brand name Vaniqa), which is FDA-approved to treat hirsutism in women. More permanent 
treatment options for facial hair and for preoperative skin flap hair removal include 
electrolysis and laser hair removal (LHR).

The frequent shaving or trimming of facial hair in transfeminine patients with hirsutism can 
lead to pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), also known as razor bumps. PFB is a common 
condition of the bearded area, axilla, pubic region, and legs.41 It is a chronic inflammatory 
disorder that primarily affects individuals with curled hair. Prevalence rates reach 80% in 
African-American and Hispanic cisgender men and cisgender women with facial hirsutism 
or hypertrichosis.42,43 Curved hair can grow back into the skin after being shaved or 
trimmed, causing inflammation and a foreign body reaction.43 This presents as painful, itchy 
papules with erythema and hyperpigmentation. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or 
keloid scarring may develop. Patients often find the disorder distressing and it may 
exacerbate gender dysphoria.43 Discontinuation of shaving is typically curative for PFB, but 
this is generally inappropriate for transfeminine persons. It can be alleviated with proper 
shaving techniques or use of topical depilatories. Pre-shave preparation with mild soap and 
warm water is recommended before applying shaving cream, followed by shaving in non-
overlapping and unidirectional strokes.43 More likely, medical therapy will be needed 
(Figure 3). Topical retinoids and low-potency topical corticosteroid may be used as first-line 
therapy.42 Combination BP and topical clindamycin may also reduce inflammation and 
lesion count.44 Eflornithine may be added to reduce hair growth.42 Destruction of hair 
follicles through LHR has become the gold standard for a permanent treatment option, 
although electrolysis can also be used.45 PFB can be difficult to treat and early referral to 
dermatology should be considered to prevent post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and 
scarring.29,46

Dermal Fillers and Facial/Body Contouring

Facial feminization and body contouring procedures are common for transfeminine persons. 
Neuromodulators such as botulinum toxin A injections and dermal fillers yield immediate 
and long-lasting contouring and feminizing effect. Transgender individuals often face 
barriers to care and are affected by the high-cost of these procedures, and are at risk to 
engage in unsafe practices such as receiving fillers from unlicensed personnel.47,48 
Injections of illicit “filler” material by non-licensed persons are often toxic with 
complications including foreign-body granulomas; bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial 
infections; bleeding; pain; scarring and keloid formation; ulceration and necrosis; gross 
disfiguration; silicone embolism; and death (Figure 4).47,48 Prevalence estimates of 
unlicensed silicone injections in the transfeminine population have ranged from 25-32%, this 
is of particular concern given the high complication rate of silicone injections.49,50 
Commonly used FDA-approved materials include collagen, hyaluronic acid, calcium

hydroxylapatite, poly-L-lactic acid, and polymethylmethacrylate.51 Physicians should refer 
patients to licensed physicians, such as board-certified dermatologists and plastic surgeons, 
for dermal fillers, and to treat dermal complications from illicit filler use.51

Keloids and Hypertrophic scars

Keloids and hypertrophic scars are fibrous proliferation initially caused by dermal injury.52 
Hypertrophic scars and keloids present as firm and elevated flesh-colored papules and 
nodules.53 Hypertrophic scars remain within the borders of the original scar, while keloids 
extend beyond the original scar. They are occasionally pruritic or painful. The appearance 
and physical discomfort can significantly impact a patient’s quality of life and can lead to 
depression and social withdrawal.54

Like all individuals undergoing surgery, transgender patients undergoing gender-affirming 
surgery are at risk for hypertrophic scar and keloid development, especially if they have a 
darker-skin type, a family or personal history of keloids, or undergo surgery at high-tension 
skin areas such as the chest.55 Keloid scarring can hinder a transgender patient’s ability to 
“pass” as their identified gender.30 Keloids and hypertrophic scars usually develop over a 
period of weeks or months. Surgical scar prevention and management should be discussed in 
at-risk patients. These patients should be carefully monitored even several months after 
surgery.

The first-line therapy for both treatment and prevention of keloid and hypertrophic scars is 
intralesional corticosteroid injections.53 Repeated triamcinolone injections yield moderate 
reduction of the scar with 50% reoccurrence rate a few years after injection.56 Surgical 
excision is an option for treatment-resistant keloids, but there is a high risk of reoccurrence 
without both post-operative and follow-up injections of intralesional corticosteroids.53 
Dermatology referral is warranted given the often refractory or recurrent nature of keloids.

Melasma, also known as chloasma, is a skin pigmentary disorder that affects 8% to 40% of 
the population and is the one of the most frequent dermatologic complaint worldwide.57 
Melasma affects over 5 million Americans of all skin types and ethnic groups. Higher 
prevalence is observed in population in intertropical areas where there is greater exposure to 
UV, such as Washington, DC and Texas, and those of skin types III-V.58 Melasma can be 
disfiguring and impactful to the patient’s social life and emotional well-being.59

Melasma presents as symmetrical hyperpigmented brown to blueish-gray macules and 
patches on the sun-exposed skin, especially the face. Darker skin types, UV exposure, and 
hormones, particularly estrogen, are risk factors for melasma.60 There is no pain or other 
associated symptoms. Transfeminine patients undergoing estrogen hormone therapy are at 
risk of developing melasma. Melasma management includes prevention of further 
hyperpigmentation and lightening of affected skin. Strict use of sunscreen and 
photoprotection is required. Hydroquinone 2-4% cream is the first-line skin lightening agent 
and can be combined with topical retinoids or corticosteroids.60 Dermatology referral is 
warranted for treatment of refractory melasma with additional treatment options such as 
chemical peels and lasers.

Miscellaneous Dermatologic Conditions

Other dermatological conditions described in transgender persons is lichen sclerosus. Lichen 
sclerosus presents as crinkled or thickened patches of skin with pruritus and tenderness at 
the anogenital area.61 LS has been reported in transfeminine patients and ought to be treated 
and monitored.62,63 Complications of lichen sclerosus may include scarring, pruritus, pain, 
obliteration of external genitalia, as well as squamous cell carcinoma.

HPV infection and HPV-related skin diseases has also occurred in the neovagina of 
transfeminine patients. These include condylomas, which can be treated with topical 
application of trichloroacetic acid, cryotherapy, or surgical excision. Low-risk dysplasia, 
high-risk dysplasia, and HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma have also all been reported.
64,65

The transgender population has increased prevalence of HIV rates and is subsequently at risk 
for HIV-associated dermatologic conditions.66 HIV patients with normal CD4 T-cell levels 
can develop psoriasis, folliculitis, condylomas, seborrheic dermatitis, and dry skin. Lower T-
cell levels can predispose patients to basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi 
sarcoma, resistant herpes simplex, molluscum contagiousm, fungal infection, etc.67

Conclusion

Transgender persons face unique burdens of dermatologic conditions related to cutaneous 
effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy and procedures. Skin diseases in transgender 
patients often underdiagnosed and underrecognized despite potential for significant 
impairments quality of life and mental health from skin diseases. For transmasculine 
patients, common conditions include acne vulgaris and male pattern hair loss. For 
transfeminine patients, common conditions include hirsutism, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and 
melasma. Post-procedural keloids and complications of filler injections should be 
considered. Unique aspects of skin health in transgender persons should be considered in the 
context of multidisciplinary gender-affirming care. Greater recognition and implementation 
of dermatologic care will improve overall clinical outcomes of gender-affirming care in 
transgender patients.

Key Points:

1.

3.

Skin conditions are often underdiagnosed and undertreated in transgender 
patients despite potential for significant impairments quality of life and 
mental health from skin diseases.

Hormone therapy affects the skin and changes the prevalence and severity of 
many dermatologic conditions, including acne, male-pattern hair loss, 
hirsutism and pseudofolliculitis barbae, and more.

Clinicians caring for transgender persons should recognize and address 
common dermatologic conditions relevant to gender-affirming treatments.
