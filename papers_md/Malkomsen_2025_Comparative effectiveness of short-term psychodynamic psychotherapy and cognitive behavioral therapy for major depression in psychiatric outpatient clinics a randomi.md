Abstract
Background  More studies with low risk of bias on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and short-
term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) for major depressive disorder (MDD) are needed. This study compares 
the outcome of CBT and STPP and examines the improvements in each treatment, focusing on effect sizes, reliable 
change, dropout rates, and remission rates, using broad inclusion criteria (e.g. participants using antidepressants or 
with strong suicidal ideation).

Methods  One hundred patients were randomly allocated to CBT or STPP. All patients were offered either 16 weekly 
sessions followed by 3 monthly booster sessions in CBT, or 28 weekly sessions in STPP. Primary outcome measures 
were Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck’s Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Secondary outcome 
measures were Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Global Assessment 
of Functioning (GAF) and Short Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12).

Results  No significant differences in outcomes were found between the two treatment groups on any of the 
measures. The within-group effects were large (> 0.8) for the primary outcome measures and moderate to large for 
the secondary outcome measures. According to the reliable change index (RCI), 79% of patients reliably improved on 
HDRS and 76% improved on BDI-II, whereas respectively 6% and 10% reliably deteriorated.

Conclusions  These findings support the assumption that CBT and STPP are equally effective treatments for 
patients with depressive disorders in psychiatric outpatient clinics. Additionally, they strengthen the evidence for the 
effectiveness of both CBT and STPP in these settings, while also highlighting that not all depressed patients respond 
to short-term treatment.

Background
Depression is a common mental disorder, a leading cause 
of  disability  and  a  significant  contributor  to  the  global 
burden of disease [1]. Major depressive disorder (MDD) 
is expected to rank first in overall disease burden in high 
income  countries  by  2030  [2].  The  effectiveness  of  both 
psychotherapy  and  antidepressants  in  treating  MDD  is 
firmly established, with evidence suggesting that a com-
bination could be the best option for those with moder-
ate and severe depression [3]. However, more than half of 
patients receiving therapy do not respond and only about 
one third remit [4]. The debate regarding which psycho-
therapeutic  approach  is  most  efficient  has  persisted  for 
decades.  Numerous  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analy-
ses have demonstrated comparable effects across various 
bona  fide  therapies,  including  cognitive  behavioral  ther-
apy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy (PDT) [5–10].

A network meta-analysis by Cuijpers et al. [7] compar-
ing all common psychotherapies for depression in terms 
of efficacy, acceptability and long-term outcomes, found 
that all therapies were more effective than care-as-usual 
and  waiting  list.  However,  dropout  rates  were  higher  in 
PDT as compared with care-as-usual, which may indicate 
that this treatment approach was less acceptable. Of the 
331 randomized controlled trials included, only one third 
were assessed as having a low risk of bias, with 211 stud-
ies examining CBT and only 21 examining PDT.

An  umbrella  review  applying  the  new  model  for  an 
empirically  supported  treatment  (EST)  using  the  con-
servative  and  strict  Grading  of  Recommendations 
Assessment,  Development,  and  Evaluation  (GRADE) 
system  for  common  mental  disorders,  concluded  that 
PDT  is  an  empirically  supported  treatment  [8].  PDT 
was  found  superior  to  both  active  and  inactive  con-
trol  groups  in  reducing  depressive  symptoms.  However, 
the  authors  suggest  downgrading  the  evidence  for  PDT 
vs.  other  active  therapies  for  mood  disorders  by  one 
level  (from  high  to  moderate),  due  to  two  methodologi-
cal  shortcomings  in  several  studies,  i.e.,  the  risk  of  bias 
concerning  random  sequence  generation  and  allocation 
concealment.

In a comprehensive overview of randomized controlled 
trials  conducted  on  the  effectiveness  of  PDT  in  various 
disorders, Lilliengren [9] identified 298 studies, including 
86  studies  comparing  PDT  and  CBT.  Most  studies  were 
conducted  on  therapies  offering  12–40  sessions  (63%). 
Of the included studies, 59 concluded with no significant 
differences,  while  21  favored  CBT  and  6  favored  PDT. 
Yet  only  22.5%  of  the  studies  focused  on  mood  disor-
ders. Given the recurrent debate concerning the relative 

efficacy of PDT to CBT, the fact that about a quarter of 
all the included comparisons indicated an advantage for 
CBT,  is  interesting.  Lilliengren  notes  that  some  studies 
supporting  CBT  have  been  criticized  for  misrepresent-
ing PDT, highlighting the necessity of sound study design 
and balanced research group composition in comparative 
research.

Several  previous  studies  comparing  CBT  and  PDT 
for  depression  have  involved  highly  selective  patient 
groups, included only a small number of participants, or 
employed  methodologies,  designs  and  treatment  proto-
cols that differ significantly [11–16]. As a result, existing 
reviews and meta-analyses typically include studies from 
a range of clinical settings and timeframes.

To our knowledge, only five studies have examined dif-
ferences  and  similarities  in  outcomes  between  CBT  and 
short-term  psychodynamic  therapy  (STPP)  for  MDD  in 
regular  clinical  outpatient  settings.  Shapiro  et  al.  [17] 
included  117  patients  with  mild  to  severe  depression  in 
a  randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT)  comparing  CBT 
and  psychodynamic-interpersonal  psychotherapy  (PI). 
To minimize confounding between therapist characteris-
tics and treatment methods, the same therapists treated 
patients  in  both  approaches.  They  found  that  CBT  and 
PI were equally effective on most measures, irrespective 
of the severity of depression or the duration of treatment 
(8 and 16 sessions), except for a small advantage of CBT 
on  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI).  Gibbons  et  al. 
[18]  found  no  differences  in  Hamilton  Depression  Rat-
ing Scale (HDRS) scores between CBT and STPP (16 ses-
sions)  in  a  non-inferiority  study  including  237  patients 
with  MDD  from  a  community  mental  health  center. 
However, they could not conclude that STPP was signifi-
cantly non-inferior to CBT regarding psychosocial func-
tioning or quality of life, as statistical power was only set 
for testing non-inferiority on the primary outcome mea-
sure. Further, they excluded all patients who had suicidal 
thoughts judged to require more intensive psychotherapy, 
which may decrease the ecological validity of their find-
ings. Driessen et al. [19] included 341 patients with MDD 
from three psychiatric outpatient clinics and proved non-
inferiority of STPP relative to CBT for HDRS scores, but 
not for remission (HDRS ≤ 7) rates. The HDRS assessors 
were not blinded to the treatment condition, which may 
have increased the risk of concealment bias. Meganck et 
al.  [20]  randomized  100  patients  with  MDD  and  either 
self-critical  or  dependent  personality  styles  to  receive 
16  to  20  sessions  CBT  or  STPP,  with  the  aim  of  explor-
ing possible moderator effects. They found no interaction 
and no evidence for a difference in effectiveness between

the  treatments.  While  their  study  design  was  rigorous, 
the results were somewhat weakened by a relatively large 
dropout  rate,  with  23  participants  receiving  four  or  less 
therapy  sessions.  Dos  Santos  et  al.  compared  the  long-
term effects of CBT and STPP on depression, measured 
by  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory-II  (BDI-II),  and  on 
functioning,  assessed  with  the  Functioning  Assessment 
Short  Test  (FAST),  three  years  post-intervention  [21]. 
Their findings showed no significant differences between 
the groups, and a sustained effect on both depression and 
functioning  among  those  who  completed  treatment  and 
participated  in  the  follow-up.  These  results  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution,  as  only  unmedicated  patients 
without  comorbidities  or  suicide  risk  were  included, 
and the number of patients who completed therapy and 
responded at follow-up was reduced to 40 (20 per group) 
from the initial 243 that were included.

In  clinical  practice,  psychodynamic  treatments  have 
traditionally  been  of  longer  duration  and  involved  more 
sessions  than  CBT.  Consequently,  some  studies  have 
compared  the  outcomes  of  longer-term  PDT  with  CBT. 
A study of patients with depression by Huber et al. [22], 
which included on average 88 sessions of PDT and 45 ses-
sions of CBT, found no significant differences in depres-
sive symptoms after three years. However, psychoanalytic 
therapy  (PA)  outperformed  both  PDT  and  CBT.  Critics, 
such as Siegfried Zepf [23], have argued that this may be 
explained by the fact that PA provided patients with more 
sessions  (mean  234  sessions).  Another  study  by  Leuz-
inger-Bohleber  et  al.  compared  long-term  CBT  (average 
of  57  sessions)  and  long-term  psychoanalytic  therapy 
(PAT) (average of 234 sessions) for chronically depressed 
patients,  and  found  no  significant  differences  between 
the groups after three years [24], but more change in per-
sonality  structure  in  the  PAT  condition  compared  with 
the  CBT  condition  at  5-year  follow-up  [25].  The  same 
challenge with different number of sessions also apply to 
their  study,  but  the  authors  argue  that  this  is  necessary 
as  the  approaches  have  different  conceptualizations  of 
depression,  which  demands  different  treatment  intensi-
ties and durations.

In sum, most studies show no major significant differ-
ences between neither longer-term PDT nor STPP com-
pared  to  CBT  in  the  treatment  of  depression.  However, 
there is still a scarcity of studies with rigorous design in 
regular outpatient clinics, and more effectiveness studies 
with sound methods and lack of bias are still needed.

The current study was designed to meet the limitations 
of  previous  studies  and  is  part  of  the  research  project 
Mechanisms of Change in Psychotherapy (MOP), an RCT 
for  patients  with  MDD  at  two  public  outpatient  clinics 
in  Norway.  Depressed  patients  were  randomly  assigned 
to  receive  either  19  sessions  of  CBT  within  a  28-week 
period,  or  28  weekly  sessions  of  STPP,  as  described  in 

more detail in the study protocol [26]. Several measures 
were  taken  to  reduce  the  risk  of  bias  concerning  ran-
dom  sequence  generation  and  allocation  concealment, 
and the research group has a balanced composition with 
allegiances  to  both  CBT  and  PDT.  In  addition,  patients 
receiving  antidepressant  medication  or  having  suicidal 
ideation  were  not  excluded.  The  results  from  this  study 
may  consequently  have  high  ecological  validity  and  low 
risk of bias.

The  main  aims  of  the  MOP  project  were  to  examine 
moderators and mediators of change and not differences 
in  overall  outcome  between  CBT  and  STPP.  Our  initial 
assumption was that there would be no significant differ-
ences in the outcome measures between the two groups, 
and  the  small  sample  size  in  the  project  does  not  allow 
for  non-inferiority  testing.  However,  on  the  background 
of  the  need  for  more  studies  comparing  STPP  and  CBT 
as documented above, the present study may contribute 
to fill some important gaps in the current knowledge.

The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  examine  the  out-
come  of  CBT  and  STPP  in  the  setting  of  two  public 
psychiatric  outpatient  clinics  in  Norway.  The  primary 
outcome  was  severity  of  depressive  symptoms  assessed 
by  the  observer-rated  HDRS,  measured  at  baseline  and 
after 28 weeks, and the patient-rated BDI-II, measured at 
baseline and after 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 28 weeks. Sec-
ondary outcomes were psychosocial functioning, anxiety 
and quality of life, measured with Global Assessment of 
Functioning  scale  (GAF),  Work  and  Social  Adjustment 
Scale  (WSAS),  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  7  (GAD-
7)  and  Short  Form  Health  Survey-12  (SF-12).  The  GAF, 
SF-12  (MCS)  and  SF-12  (PCS)  were  assessed  at  base-
line  and  after  28  weeks,  while  WSAS  and  GAD-7  were 
assessed  at  baseline  and  after  8  weeks,  16  weeks  and  28 
weeks.  More  specifically,  we  investigated  the  following 
research questions:

1.  Primary outcomes

a.  What are the effect sizes, both between and 

within groups, of the primary outcome measures, 
i.e., observer-rated and self-reported depressive 
symptoms?

b.  What are the response and remission rates based 
on observer-rated and self-reported depressive 
symptoms?

c.  What is the proportion of patients showing reliable 
improvement and deterioration for the primary 
outcomes?

2.  What is the proportion of patients in diagnostic 

remission?

3.  What are the effect sizes, both between and within 

groups, for the secondary outcomes?

4.  What are the dropout rates and are there indications 
that these rates differ between treatment modalities?

Methods
Setting, participants and randomization

Two  psychiatric  outpatient  clinics  in  Oslo,  Nydalen  and 
Vinderen, participated in the MOP study. The clinics are 
part  of  the  public  health  care  system  and  require  that 
patients  are  referred  by  a  psychologist  or  doctor,  often 
a  general  practitioner.  Both  clinics  treat  patients  with  a 
wide  range  of  mental  illnesses.  Patients  pay  for  sessions 
until  they  reach  the  limit  of  230  euros,  after  which  all 
health care is free of charge.

The  study  included  100  patients.  The  sample  size  was 
determined  by  considering  both  direct  and  indirect 
effects [26]. With reference to a t-test comparison of two 
independent  groups  as  the  total  effect,  a  sample  size  of 
100  participants  would  provide  a  power  of  0.84  (two-
sided t-test, significance level of 5%) to detect a difference 
of a medium (0.6) effect size.

Patients  were  recruited  consecutively  as  they  were 
referred  to  the  outpatient  clinics  with  depressive  symp-
toms  as  their  main  reason  for  referral.  The  inclusion 
criteria  were  MDD  according  to  the  fourth  edition  of 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders 
(DSM-IV) [27], age 18–65 years, an ability to understand, 
write  and  speak  a  Scandinavian  language,  and  willing-
ness  to  give  informed  consent.  Exclusion  criteria  were 
current or past neurological illness, psychotic disorders, 
traumatic  brain  injury,  bipolar  disorder  type  1,  current 
alcohol and/or substance dependence disorders, develop-
mental disorders, and intellectual disability.

After  baseline  assessments,  patients  were  assigned  a 
trial  ID  and  allocated  to  either  CBT  or  STPP  by  using 
computer randomization. Randomization was not strati-
fied, and no block randomization was applied. This pro-
cedure  was  conducted  by  the  principal  investigator. 
Randomization  was  performed  by  the  generation  of  a 
sequence of random numbers that determined to which 
group  the  trial  participants  were  allocated.  The  princi-
pal  investigator  received  the  treatment  allocation  (CBT 
or  STPP)  from  an  independent  third  party  located  in  a 
separate part of the hospital, ensuring no influence from 
study personnel. To minimize bias, strict allocation con-
cealment  made  sure  that  the  person  judging  eligibility 
was not aware of the assigned study condition.

Therapists and steering group

A  total  of  18  therapists  participated  in  the  treatment, 
comprising 12 women and six men. Among them, there 
were nine psychologists, six psychiatrists and three psy-
chiatric  nurses.  All  therapists  had  a  minimum  of  two 
years  of  training  in  CBT  or  PDT.  For  this  study  they  all 
went  through  one  year  of  training  on  the  principles  of 

CBT  and  STPP  in  supervision  groups,  including  a  trial 
case,  before  receiving  patients  in  the  study.  The  mean 
number  of  patients  treated  by  each  therapist  was  5.6, 
ranging  from  one  to  12.  The  average  age  was  45  years 
(SD = 8.5), ranging from 31 to 63, with a mean of 47 in the 
CBT group and 43 in the STPP group. They had a mean 
of 14 years (SD = 5.5) of experience as therapists, 15 years 
in the CBT group and 13 in the STPP group.

The  steering  group  of  the  project  consists  of  two  pro-
fessors  (TD  and  JIR)  and  one  senior  researcher  (JHE) 
specialized  in  CBT,  and  two  professors  specialized  in 
PDT  (TW  and  RU).  One  member  of  the  steering  group 
(KO)  has  no  formal  training  in  any  of  the  psychothera-
peutic approaches. They have weekly in-person meetings 
to  oversee  the  agreed  project  goals.  The  three  steering 
group members specialized in CBT supervised the CBT 
therapists in the project, while the two members special-
ized in PDT supervised the STPP therapists.

Treatment interventions
Cognitive behavioral therapy

The  CBT  treatment  consisted  of  16  weekly  sessions  fol-
lowed  by  three  booster  sessions  at  monthly  intervals. 
The treatment was thus offered within a time frame of 28 
weeks.  Treatment  principles  were  based  on  «Cognitive 
Therapy of Depression» by Aaron Beck [28].

The sessions were structured yet flexible. The therapists 
were active and facilitated collaboration with the patient. 
The patients were given relevant homework assignments 
and encouraged to conduct behavioral experiments. Each 
session  typically  began  with  a  mood  score  assessment 
from 0 to 100, followed by a review of the previous week’s 
homework  assignments,  and  an  agenda  was  collabora-
tively set for the current session. At the end of each ses-
sion, the therapist summarized the content of the session 
and proposed homework assignments based on the pre-
senting problems and current state of the patient.

Therapists  were  encouraged  to  utilize  interventions 
such  as  Socratic  questioning,  using  the  ABC  and  Dia-
mond  model,  challenging  automatic  thoughts,  focusing 
on  behavioral  activation  and  identifying  thinking  traps. 
Socratic questioning is a technique where therapists use 
open-ended,  probing  questions  to  help  clients  examine 
and challenge their thoughts and beliefs, fostering insight 
and  promoting  more  balanced,  adaptive  thinking.  The 
ABC model is a framework that explains how an Activat-
ing event (A) triggers Beliefs (B), which then lead to Con-
sequences (C), emphasizing the role of beliefs in shaping 
reactions to events. The Diamond model illustrates how 
thoughts,  emotions,  physical  sensations,  and  behav-
iors  are  interconnected.  Challenging  automatic  negative 
thoughts  involves  identifying  and  critically  examining 
distorted  or  unhelpful  thoughts  to  replace  them  with 
thinking.  Behavioral 
more  realistic  and  balanced 

Malkomsen et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:113 Page 5 of 15

activation  is  about  helping  patients  identify  and  engage 
in  positive,  rewarding  activities  to  reduce  depression  by 
breaking  the  cycle  of  avoidance  and  inactivity.  Think-
ing traps are distorted patterns of thinking that contrib-
ute  to  negative  emotions  and  unhelpful  behaviors,  such 
as  catastrophizing,  overgeneralizing,  or  black-and-white 
thinking.

In  session  1–3,  patient  and  therapist  co-created  a  list 
of  the  patients’  current  treatment  goals  and  challenges, 
as well as a case formulation describing the relationship 
between  past  experiences,  current  dysfunctional  beliefs, 
and response patterns. In addition, the therapists focused 
on  building  the  therapeutic  alliance  and  socialization  to 
the  therapeutic  model.  In  session  4–16,  the  therapists 
aimed  to  alleviate  depressive  symptoms  by  using  the 
abovementioned  techniques  to  change  patients’  dys-
functional  cognitions,  assumptions,  and  attitudes.  The 
booster  sessions,  16–19,  which  were  provided  by  the 
same  therapist,  offered  patients  an  opportunity  to  con-
solidate  the  improvement  made  during  therapy,  and  to 
address any potential relapse.

Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy

The  STPP  treatment  consisted  of  28  weekly  sessions. 
Treatment  principles  were  based  on  «Long-term  psy-
chodynamic  psychotherapy»  by  Glen  O.  Gabbard  [29], 
which according to the author can be applied to shorter 
as  well  as  time-limited  therapies.  This  basic  text  out-
lines central principles of psychodynamic psychotherapy 
such as the significance of unconscious mental function-
ing, the importance of childhood experiences in concert 
with  genetic  factors  in  shaping  adult  mental  life,  and 
how  the  phenomena  transference,  countertransference 
and  the  patient’s  defenses  and  resistance  may  affect  the 
therapy process. In the present study, the same time-lim-
ited frame of STPP was applied as in two other random-
ized studies investigating STPP and CBT. Both the RCT 
by  Goodyer  et  al.  comparing  STPP,  CBT  and  treatment 
as usual [30], and the RCT by Ulberg et al. investigating 
a  specific  treatment  technique  in  STPP  [31],  applied  a 
28-session time frame as described by Cregeen et al. [32].
The  STPP  therapists  aimed  to  alleviate  depressive 
symptoms  by  providing  new  insights  into  the  connec-
tions between past and present experiences, focusing on 
relational  challenges,  difficult  emotions,  defense  mecha-
nisms  and  other  unconscious  material.  Guidelines  as  to 
how  to  present  the  treatment  rationale  of  STPP  to  the 
patient, as well as the respective roles of the patient and 
the  therapist,  were  co-developed  by  the  therapists  and 
the researchers. These included the treatment frame, ses-
sion  frequency,  arrangements  for  holidays  and  absences 
from sessions. The therapists were also involved in creat-
ing written treatment procedures for this study.

Within  the  first  three  sessions,  the  therapists  made 
a  case  formulation  together  with  their  patients  that 
included symptoms and problems, predisposing and pre-
cipitating life events or stressors, and offered suggestions 
on what could be the maintaining influences of their diffi-
culties. Therapist and patient then agreed on what should 
be  the  focus  of  the  treatment.  Within  session  8–12,  the 
therapists were instructed to make at least one reference 
to  treatment  focus  and  the  patient’s  perception  of  the 
therapy  so  far.  How  the  themes  the  patient  brought  to 
sessions  related  to  the  focus,  and  potential  insights  and 
views  about  the  treatment,  should  also  be  mentioned  at 
least  once  within  session  16–20.  During  this  period  the 
therapists were asked to bring up the forthcoming treat-
ment termination at least once. The end of treatment, the 
patient’s  current  problems,  potential  insights  and  how 
to  make  use  of  such  insights  after  treatment  should  be 
major themes during session 20–28.

During  treatment,  the  therapists  explored  sensitive 
topics,  addressed  transactions  in  the  therapeutic  rela-
tionship, used material about interpersonal relationships 
outside  therapy  as  the  basis  for  interventions,  encour-
aged exploration of thoughts and feelings about therapy, 
and  interpreted  direct  manifestations  of  transference 
with  moderate  intensity.  In  line  with  Leichsenring  and 
Schauenburg’s  [33]  suggestions  for  an  evidence-based 
unified  protocol  for  STPP  in  depression,  these  elements 
were  to  be  applied  in  a  flexible  manner  adapted  to  the 
individual patient’s motivation, severity of pathology and 
needs.

Treatment integrity

All  therapy  sessions  were  video-recorded  and  manual 
fidelity  was  monitored  by  experienced  supervisors  in 
one-hour weekly (STPP) and two hours bi-weekly (CBT) 
group  supervisions. The  supervision  focused  on  the  ini-
tial  phase  of  treatment,  case  formulation,  individual 
treatment strategies and termination of therapy.

To  ensure  that  the  two  therapy  approaches  differed,  a 
subset  of  video  recordings  from  randomly  selected  ses-
sions  were  evaluated  by  using  the  Comparative  Psy-
chotherapy  Process  Scale  (CPPS)  [34].  An  expert  panel, 
comprising  both  STPP  and  CBT  supervisors,  collabo-
rated  with  the  raters  to  establish  a  consensus  on  item 
interpretation. Two independent raters, blinded to treat-
ment  allocation,  then  each  assessed  10  randomly  cho-
sen  sessions  from  both  CBT  and  STPP  (in  total  N = 40 
sessions). To examine the reliability, a subset of sessions 
(N = 10) were assessed by both raters, and reliability was 
estimated  by  intraclass  correlation  (ICC),  more  specifi-
cally ICC (2.1) [35]. The single-measure ICC, employing 
a  consistency  definition,  indicated  good  reliability  for 
both  the  psychodynamic  subscale  (ICC = 0.94,  CI:0.76–
0.98)  and  the  cognitive-behavioral  subscale  (ICC = 0.95, 

Malkomsen et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:113 Page 6 of 15

CI:0.82–0.99).  The  independent  raters  scored  the  STPP 
therapists  significantly  higher  on  the  psychodynamic 
subscale than the CBT therapists (2.56 vs. 0.42, p < 0.001) 
and  the  CBT  therapists  significantly  higher  on  the  cog-
nitive-behavioral subscale than the STPP therapists (3.33 
vs. 0.61, p < 0.001).

Diagnostics

Patients were assessed for symptom disorders according 
to DSM-IV criteria using the Mini International Neuro-
psychiatric  Interview  6.0.0  (MINI)  [36].  The  MINI  was 
administered  both  pre-  and  post-treatment.  Personal-
ity  disorders  were  assessed  using  the  Structured  Clini-
cal  Interview  for  DSM-IV  Axis  II  Personality  Disorders 
(SCID-II) [37].

In DSM-IV, the classification of personality disorders is 
polythetic.  That  is,  the  criteria  within  each  disorder  are 
neither  necessary  nor  sufficient.  Psychometrically  spo-
ken, the criteria are “causal indicators” gradually creating 
the  construct,  rather  than  “effect  indicators”  affected  by 
variations of a latent construct [38]. A variable counting 
the  number  of  fulfilled  personality  disorder  criteria  can 
thus  be  seen  as  a  severity  index.  In  the  current  sample, 
the  reliability  of  this  severity  index,  estimated  by  ICC 
(2.1) based on scores from six raters scoring 11 patients, 
was 0.99 (CI:0.97-1.00).

Primary outcomes
Hamilton depression rating scale. The level of depres-
sion  was  assessed  by  an  observer  using  the  HDRS  at 
baseline and after 28 weeks [39]. The HDRS is composed 
of 17 items, each rated on a scale from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, 
covering a range of symptoms experienced by the patient 
within  the  last  week,  including  depressed  mood,  guilt, 
suicidal  ideation,  insomnia,  agitation,  and  weight  loss. 
The  total  score  on  the  HDRS  provides  a  measure  of  the 
severity  of  depression,  with  scores  typically  categorized 
as follows: 0–7 (normal), 8–13 (mild depression), 14–18 
(moderate  depression),  19–22  (severe  depression),  and 
≥ 23  (very  severe  depression).  To  examine  the  reliability 
of HDRS, we used ICC (2.K) [35]. Four raters scored 10 
patients.  The  reliability  coefficient  for  HDRS  was  0.97 
(CI:0.92–0.99)  for  relative  decision  and  0.96  (CI:0.86–
0.99) for absolute decision.

The  Beck  depression  inventory-II.  The  level  of 
depression was also assessed by self-report using BDI-II 
at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 28 weeks [40]. Com-
prising  21  items,  the  BDI-II  assesses  various  depres-
sive  symptoms  experienced  during  the  preceding  two 
weeks,  including  feelings  of  sadness,  pessimism,  guilt, 
and  fatigue,  among  others.  Patients  rate  the  severity 
of  each  symptom  on  a  scale  ranging  from  0  to  3,  with 
higher  scores  indicating  greater  severity  of  depressive 
symptoms. The total score is calculated by summing the 

individual  item  scores,  with  the  following  established 
cut-offs: 0–13 (minimal depression), 14–19 (mild depres-
sion),  20–28  (moderate  depression),  and  29–63  (severe 
depression).  BDI-II  has  demonstrated  excellent  psycho-
metric properties in diverse samples [41]. The combina-
tion of HDRS and BDI- II cover many of the domains that 
are shown to be important to depressed patients [42].

Secondary outcomes
Generalized anxiety disorder 7. The level of anxiety was 
measured  by  self-report  using  GAD-7  [43].  The  GAD-7 
consists of seven items that capture common symptoms 
of  anxiety,  including  excessive  worry,  restlessness,  and 
difficulty  concentrating.  Patients  rate  the  frequency  of 
each symptom over the past two weeks on a scale rang-
ing from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores 
range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater 
severity of symptoms. Established cut-offs are as follows: 
0–4 (minimal anxiety), 5–9 (mild anxiety), 10–14 (mod-
erate  anxiety),  and  15–21  (severe  anxiety).  The  GAD-7 
has shown excellent internal consistency [44], and strong 
validity and reliability [45].

Global assessment of functioning scale. The level of 
psychosocial  functioning  was  measured  by  an  observer 
using  GAF  [46].  The  scores  were  split  into  a  function 
score  (GAF-F)  and  symptom  score  (GAF-S)  to  measure 
the level of functioning and symptom severity separately 
[47].  The  GAF-F  score  encompasses  a  broad  range  of 
functioning,  from  severe  impairment  (e.g.,  inability  to 
maintain personal hygiene) to superior functioning (e.g., 
stable relationships, high productivity). The GAF-S score 
encompasses  a  broad  range  of  symptom  severity,  from 
no  symptoms  to  severe  symptomatology  (e.g.  suicide 
attempts  with  a  clear  intention  to  die).  To  examine  the 
reliability of GAF-F and GAF-S, we used ICC (2.K) [35]. 
Four raters scored 11 patients. For GAF-F, the reliability 
coefficient  for  relative  decision  was  0.83  (CI:0.57–0.95) 
and  0.82  (CI:0.57–0.95)  for  absolute  decision.  For  GAF-
S, the reliability coefficients were 0.92 (CI:0.80–0.98) and 
0.90 (CI:0.74–0.97), respectively.

Work  and  social  adjustment  scale.  Functioning  was 
also  assessed  by  self-report  using  WSAS  [48].  WSAS 
consists of five items that measure impairment in work, 
social  leisure  activities,  private  leisure  activities,  home 
management,  and  close  relationships.  Patients  rate  the 
extent to which their mental health difficulties have inter-
fered  with  each  domain  on  a  scale  ranging  from  0  (not 
at  all)  to  8  (severely).  The  total  score  is  40,  with  higher 
scores  indicating  greater  impairment.  WSAS  has  been 
shown to have high internal reliability, and is sensitive to 
treatment effects [49].

12-Item short form health survey. The health-related 
quality  of  life  was  measured  by  self-report  using  SF-12 
[50].  The  SF-12  consists  of  12  items  that  assess  eight 

Malkomsen et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:113 Page 7 of 15

health  domains  covering  the  past  four  weeks:  physi-
cal  functioning,  role  limitations  due  to  physical  health 
problems,  bodily  pain,  general  health  perceptions,  vital-
ity,  social  functioning,  role  limitations  due  to  emotional 
problems,  and  mental  health.  These  items  are  aggre-
gated  to  generate  two  measures:  Physical  Component 
Summary  (PCS)  and  the  Mental  Component  Summary 
(MCS).  The  SF-12  is  a  psychometrically  sound  instru-
ment for measuring health-related quality of life for peo-
ple with severe mental illness [51].

Assessments and reliability

As  prespecified  in  the  protocol,  HDRS,  GAF-S,  GAF-
F,  SF-12  (MCS),  SF-12  (PCS)  were  assessed  at  baseline 
and after 28 weeks, and BDI-II, WSAS and GAD-7 were 
assessed  at  baseline  and  after  8  weeks,  16  weeks  and  28 
weeks.

The  baseline  and  follow-up  assessments  were  con-
ducted by a group of clinicians who did not take part in 
the  study  treatments. Their  training  consisted  of  several 
sessions in which they reviewed video recordings of pre-
vious assessments, and reviews of their own assessments 
alongside  clinical  experts  in  both  CBT  and  STPP.  The 
assessors also received supervision on a regular basis by 
experienced  raters  and  clinicians,  and  consensus  meet-
ings  were  held  to  assure  reliability  of  assessments.  To 
minimize bias, the assessors were blinded to the therapy 
approach.

Statistical methods

All  statistical  analyses  were  done  in  SPSS  29.0.  We 
adhered to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, includ-
ing  all  patients  regardless  of  noncompliance,  protocol 
deviations,  or  withdrawal.  To  investigate  whether  there 
were  indications  that  the  “missing-at-random”  assump-
tion  was  met,  we  conducted  several  t-tests  and  chi-
square tests to determine potential differences in baseline 
variables between patients with missing data and patients 
without missing data. In total, 81 patients (81%) attended 
the 28-week  evaluation (CBT: 39, STPP:  42).  No signifi-
cant  differences  were  found  between  those  lost  to  fol-
low-up  and  those  assessed  at  28  weeks  with  respect  to 
demographics  (age,  gender),  treatment  variables  (previ-
ous  treatment  and  antidepressant  medication),  baseline 
symptoms (HDRS and BDI-II), or psychosocial function-
ing (GAF and WSAS). These findings provide support for 
the assumption that the data are “missing at random”.

Dichotomous  data  (response  rates,  remission  rates, 
diagnostic status, and dropout) were analyzed using Chi-
Square  statistics.  Cohen’s  d  was  calculated  by  using  the 
mean  differences  between  and  within  groups,  divided 
by  the  total  variance  in  the  model  (including  residuals, 
intercept, and slope), following the method described by 
Westfall et al. [52].

We  used  the  Reliable  Change  Index  (RCI)  to  calculate 
the  number  of  patients  who  were  reliably  changed  on 
HDRS  and  BDI-II  during  treatment  [53].  The  RCI  is  an 
index  of  change  based  on  the  standard  error  of  the  dif-
ference  between  two  time-points,  taking  the  reliability 
of the measure into account (RCI = 1.96 x SEDiff). For the 
calculation of RCI for HDRS, we used the inter-rater reli-
ability  of  HDRS  in  the  present  sample,  0.97,  which  cor-
responds to the reliability of 0.96 and 0.98 in two studies 
of one day test-retest reliability of HDRS [54]. A change 
of  3.10  represented  reliable  change.  Consequently, 
patients with decrease in HDRS equal or above 3.10 were 
regarded  as  reliably  improved,  whereas  those  with  an 
increase  in  HDRS  equal  or  above  3.10  were  regarded  as 
reliably  deteriorated.  The  RCI  for  BDI-II  was  based  on 
the  pooled  seven  days  test-retest  reliability  of  BDI-II  in 
clinical  populations,  i.e.,  Pearson’s  r = 0.92  reported  by 
Wang & Gorenstein [41]. A pre-post change of 5.88 rep-
resented reliable change. Patients with decrease in BDI-II 
equal  or  above  5.88  were  regarded  as  reliably  improved, 
and those with an increase in BDI-II equal or above 5.88 
as reliably deteriorated.

Linear  mixed  models  were  used  for  all  outcome  vari-
ables [55, 56]. These outcome variables were included as 
the  dependent  variables  whereas  time  and  the  interac-
tion  between  time  and  treatment  (time*treatment)  were 
included  as  the  independent  variables.  Time  was  coded 
as 0-2-4-7 for variables that were measured at four time 
points  (BDI,  WSAS,  and  GAD-7),  which  implies  that 
each  whole  number  represents  a  duration  of  approxi-
mately one month. For outcome variables with two mea-
surement occasions, time was coded as 0–1. All outcome 
variables  were  approximately  normally  distributed  for 
all time points, allowing the use of maximum likelihood 
estimation.

We  adhered  to  the  principles  of  model  building  by 
comparing  a  simple  linear  regression  model  (“baseline 
model”)  against  more  complex  models.  The  baseline 
model  only  included  the  time  variable  and  intercept  as 
fixed effects. The − 2 Log Likelihood (LLH) and Akaike’s 
Information Criterion (AIC) were utilized as the primary 
indices for assessing model fit. The AIC adjusts for model 
complexity  by  penalizing  the  inclusion  of  additional 
parameters,  making  it  particularly  useful  for  comparing 
models of varying complexity. Consequently, the AIC was 
given  the  greatest  weight  when  interpreting  models  rel-
evant to the research hypotheses. Dependency in the lon-
gitudinal data was accounted for by including a random 
intercept  and  random  slope  at  the  individual  level,  with 
the autoregressive heterogeneous order I (ARH1) covari-
ance  structure  for  the  random  effects  [56].  However,  in 
those  instances  where  the  model  did  not  converge,  the 
covariance structure was simplified to the autoregressive 

Malkomsen et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:113 model (AR1). See supplement for details about the model 
fit of the different models.

To evaluate whether there were differences in outcomes 
between the two treatment sites, we included site in the 
third step and the site*time interaction in the fourth step 
(only primary outcome variables). Similarly, the effect of 
the  number  of  sessions  was  evaluated  by  including  an 
interaction  between  time  and  the  number  of  sessions, 
which was treated as a continuous variable.

For  the  analysis  of  the  therapist  effect  (n = 18),  a  third 
level was added, implying that patients are nested within 
therapists. This  implies the inclusion of  a  random inter-
cept and random slope at the therapist level. A significant 
effect  for  random  slope,  as  well  as  improved  model  fit, 
would imply differences in outcome across therapists.

Results
Participant flow and characteristics

Recruitment occurred from November 2017 to Septem-
ber 2022. In total, 242 patients were assessed for eligibil-
ity. Of these, 104 did not meet the inclusion criteria, 29 
declined to participate, and nine were excluded for other 
reasons.  After  28  weeks,  11  patients  were  lost  to  follow 
up  in  the  CBT  group,  and  eight  were  lost  in  the  STPP 
group.  A  flow-diagram  is  presented  in  Fig.  1.  Clinical 
characteristics and demographic information about par-
ticipants are shown in Table 1.

Primary outcomes (HDRS and BDI-II)
Effect sizes

There  were  no  significant  differences  in  HDRS  between 
CBT and STPP at 28 weeks, as the time*treatment inter-
action  was  not  significant  (p = 0.283)  (Table  2).  Accord-
ingly,  the  between-group  effect  size  was  small  (d < 0.3) 
(Table  3).  The  effect  of  time  was  highly  significant 
(p < 0.001)  (Table  2),  and  the  within-group  effect  sizes 
were large (d > 0.80).

Similarly, there were no significant differences between 
groups  in  BDI-II  after  28  weeks,  indicated  by  a  non-
significant  time*treatment  interaction  (p = 0.720),  and  a 
small  effect  size  between  groups  (d < 0.2).  The  effect  of 
time  was  highly  significant  (p < 0.001),  and  the  within-
group  effect  sizes  were  large  (d > 0.80).  Fig.  2  illus-
trates  the  significant  reduction  in  depressive  symptoms 
observed  in  both  groups  on  BDI-II.  The  graphs  show 
comparable  rates  of  change  between  the  two  interven-
tions, with consistent reductions in BDI-II scores across 
all time intervals.

Symptomatic response and remission rates

Response  to  treatment  in  HDRS,  defined  as  a  reduc-
tion  of  ≥ 50%  from  baseline  to  28  weeks,  was  achieved 
by 42% of the patients (34 out of 81) (Table 4). The Odds 
Ratio  (OR),  comparing  the  odds  of  achieving  treatment 
response  between  the  two  groups,  was  0.59  (CI:  0.24–
1.42),  indicating  no  statistically  significant  difference 
(χ² = 1.40,  p = 0.24)  (Table  4).  The  proportion  of  patients 
in  remission,  defined  as  HDRS ≤ 7,  was  32%  (26  out  of 
81). The OR for remission was 0.71 (CI: 0.28–1.82), which 
was not statistically significant (χ² = 0.50, p = 0.48).

Response  to  treatment  in  BDI-II,  defined  as  a  reduc-
tion of ≥ 50% from baseline to 28 weeks, was achieved by 
52.5% of patients (42 out of 80). The discrepancy between 
the  number  of  patients  in  the  BDI-II  and  HDRS  (80  vs. 
81) is due to one patient not returning the self-completed 
forms.  The  Odds  Ratio  (OR)  was  0.91  (CI:  0.38–2.19), 
indicating  no  significant  difference  between  the  groups 
(χ² = 0.05,  p = 0.83).  The  proportion  of  patients  in  remis-
sion, defined as BDI-II ≤ 9, was 36.6% (27 out of 80). The 
OR  for  remission  was  0.77  (CI:  0.30–1.95),  with  no  sig-
nificant between-group difference (χ² = 0.30, p = 0.58).

Reliable change and deterioration

In  the  HDRS,  79%  of  patients  showed  reliable  improve-
ment, while 6% (n = 5) experienced reliable deterioration. 
There were no statistically significant differences between 
the  groups  in  rates  of  reliable  improvement  (χ² = 0.01, 
p = 0.92), with an OR of 0.95 (CI: 0.32–2.76). Similarly, no 
significant  difference  was  found  in  reliable  deterioration 
(χ² = 0.14,  p = 1.00),  with  an  OR  of  1.42  (CI:  0.23–9.00) 
(Table 4).

For the BDI-II, 76% of patients were reliably improved, 
and 10% (n = 8) showed reliable deterioration. No signifi-
cant  between-group  differences  were  observed  for  reli-
able improvement (χ² = 0.17, p = 0.68), with an Odds Ratio 
(OR) of 0.80 (CI: 0.28–2.30). Similarly, no significant dif-
ference  was  found  for  reliable  deterioration  (χ² = 0.01, 
p = 1.00), with an OR of 0.95 (CI: 0.22–4.08).

Diagnostic remission according to MINI

Of  the  81  patients  who  attended  the  28-week  evalua-
tion,  61  (75%)  no  longer  met  the  criteria  for  MDD  and 
were  considered  in  diagnostic  remission,  with  an  OR  of 
1.55  (CI:  0.56–4.32)  (Table  4).  There  was  no  significant 
difference  between  the  two  treatment  groups  (χ² = 0.71, 
p = 0.40).

Secondary outcomes (GAF, WSAS, GAD-7 and SF-12)
Effect sizes

There  were  no  significant  differences  between  CBT  and 
STPP  on  any  of  the  secondary  outcome  measures,  as 
none of the time*treatment interactions were significant

(Table  2).  All  between-group  effect  sizes  were  small 
(d < 0.2), except for WSAS (d = 0.39) (Table 3). In contrast,

Treatment dropout

Dropout was defined as attending fewer than eight ther-
apy  sessions.  On  average,  patients  in  the  CBT  group 
attended 14.9 (SD = 5.2) sessions, while those in the STPP 
group  attended  22.5  (SD = 7.7)  sessions.  A  total  of  11 
patients  dropped  out  of  therapy,  including  six  from  the 
CBT group and five from the STPP group, resulting in an 
OR of 0.82 (CI: 0.23–2.87). There were no significant dif-
ferences  in  dropout  rates  between  the  groups  (χ² = 0.10, 
p = 0.75).

Number of sessions, treatment sites, and therapist effects

The interaction between time and the number of sessions 
was  non-significant  for  both  primary  outcomes  (HDRS: 
p = 0.577, F = 0.31; BDI-II: p = 0.757, F = 0.096). This indi-
cates that the amount of therapy delivered had no overall 
effect  on  outcomes.  This  finding  was  further  supported 
by the lack of improvement of the model (see Supplemen-
tary materials for details on model building and testing).
We  also  examined  whether  one  treatment  site  pro-
duced better results than the other. The time × site inter-
action was not significant for BDI-II (p = 0.169, F = 1.93),

but  significant  for  HDRS  (p = 0.032,  F = 4.7).  The  esti-
mated difference in change of HDRS across the two sites 
was 3.4 points (SD: 1.6).

Finally,  to  assess  whether  there  were  differences  in 
change  trajectories  across  therapists,  we  included  ran-
dom  slope  for  therapists  and  random  intercept  for 
patients.  We  then  tested  the  significance  of  the  slope 
variance  for  the  therapist  effect.  For  HDRS,  the  model 
did not converge. For BDI-II, the slope variance was non-
significant  (p = 0.686),  indicating  no  significant  differ-
ences in outcomes across therapists.

Discussion
There were no statistically significant differences between 
CBT  and  STPP  in  any  of  the  outcome  measures.  How-
ever,  we  found  that  both  CBT  and  STPP  are  associ-
ated  with  an  improvement  in  depressive  symptoms  and 
increase in psychosocial functioning and mental health-
related  quality  of  life.  This  supports  CBT  and  STPP  as 
evidence-based  treatments  for  MDD  in  regular  outpa-
tient settings. However, while most patients showed reli-
able  improvement,  many  did  not  achieve  symptomatic 
remission,  and  some  even  deteriorated.  The  following

discussion will address the comparability of these results 
and their potential implications.

Regarding primary outcomes, the treatment effects on 
depressive  symptoms  and  remission  rates  are  compa-
rable  to  other  head-to-head  comparisons  between  CBT 
and  STPP.  The  patients  in  the  present  study  improved 
about  eight  points  on  HDRS,  which  is  more  than  the 
5-point improvement in Gibbons et al. [18] and equal to 
the  8-point  improvement  found  by  Driessen  et  al.  [19] 
in  their  study.  Both  studies  have  treatment  protocols 
that  are  similar  to  ours,  but  the  treatment  course  in  the 
present  study  is  longer  (16  vs.  28  sessions  in  STPP  and 
16  vs.  19  in  CBT).  At  post-treatment,  our  patients  were 
less depressed than patients in both the study by Gibbons 
et al. (HDRS of 10 versus 15) and Driessen et al. (HDRS 
of  10  versus  16).  This  may  be  partly  explained  by  the 
fact that our patients are also less depressed at baseline. 
Compared to Meganck et al. [20], the results of the cur-
rent study were very similar to their pre-treatment HDRS 
score of 18.2 and reduction to 11.3 after 6 months.

The  remission  rate  in  the  study  by  Driessen  et  al.  [19] 
was  22.7%  when  defined  as  HDRS ≤ 7,  which  again  is 
somewhat  lower  than  in  the  current  study  (32%).  It 
might be that our larger proportion of patients in remis-
sion  is  because  our  patients  are  less  severely  depressed 
at  baseline.  Driessen  et  al.  [19]  speculate  that  their  low 
remission rate may be related to the relatively low socio-
economic  status  and  income  levels  of  their  patients. 
Comparing  socioeconomic  factors  across  studies  poses 
a challenge, but it is not obvious that our patients differ 
significantly from their sample. Driessen et al. also argue 
that the low remission rates observed in their study could 
indicate  that  extending  the  treatment  courses  is  neces-
sary to get better outcomes. As our treatment courses are 
longer and with better results, this may be taken as sup-
port to this claim. However, we did not find any evidence 
that  the  number  of  sessions  was  related  to  outcome. 
The present results are in line with those in the study by 
Meganck et al. [20], where 31.2% of participants were in 
remission by the criteria of HDRS ≤ 7 after being offered 

16 sessions of CBT or STPP. Together these results raise 
some important questions about the cost-effectiveness of 
additional  sessions.  Findings  from  our  one-  and  three-
year follow-ups will provide insights into long-term out-
comes,  including  consideration  of  cost-effectiveness.  Of 
note, however, all these studies concern short-term ther-
apies, and as indicated in the review by Bone et al. [57], 
different  patients  may  respond  to  therapy  at  different 
rates, indicating that longer duration of treatment could 
help more patients.

When defining response as a reduction in HDRS ≥ 50%, 
the  response  rate  in  our  sample  was  42%  (CBT:  49%, 
STPP:  36%).  Again,  this  is  somewhat  higher  than  that 
in  the  study  by  Driessen  et  al.  [19],  who  found  a  total 
response  rate  of  38%  (CBT:  39%,  STPP:  37%).  The 
response  rate  in  the  current  study  is  also  consider-
ably  higher  than  in  the  study  by  Gibbons  et  al.  [18]  in 
both  CBT  (22%)  and  STPP  (16%).  These  differences  in 
response  rates  may  also  be  a  result  of  the  factors  men-
tioned above. Furthermore, nearly half of their study pop-
ulation consisted of patients with a minority background, 
primarily African American, whereas in our dataset, the 
minority population was only 4%. This may also contrib-
ute, as being in a minority group is a known risk factor of 
non-response in psychotherapy [57].

Regarding  secondary  outcomes,  Driessen  et  al.  found 
no  significant  differences  between  CBT  and  STPP  in 
either anxiety or quality of life [58], or in therapist-rated 
psychosocial  functioning  [59].  As  they  found  that  the 
therapist ratings were influenced by therapist character-
istics,  they  called  for  more  research  including  blinded 
observer-rated  outcome  measures  concerning  psycho-
social functioning. The present study provides observer-
rated  GAF-F  scores  with  high  reliability  and  show 
improvements  in  GAF-F  scores  from  approximately  56 
to  68,  which  align  closely  with  the  findings  reported  by 
Driessen et al. [59].

The dropout rate in the current study is low. According 
to a meta-analysis of RCTs by Cooper & Conklin [60], the 
mean  dropout  rate  in  treatment  of  MDD  is  17.5%  They 

Malkomsen et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:113 Page 13 of 15

define  dropout  as  unexpected  patient  attrition  among 
individuals  who  were  randomized  to  a  treatment,  but 
failed  to  complete  it.  We  defined  dropout  as  attending 
less than eight sessions of therapy, with a dropout rate of 
11%  (CBT:  12%,  STPP:  10%).  This  is  significantly  lower 
than  that  reported  by  Driessen  et  al.  (31%  in  CBT  and 
26%  in  STPP)  with  a  similar  definition  of  dropout  [19]. 
It is also lower than in the study by Meganck et al. [20], 
where 23% of patients dropped out before receiving four 
or  less  therapy  sessions  (CBT:  9%,  STPP:  14%).  It  is  dif-
ficult  to  speculate  whether  differences  in  setting,  thera-
pists  or  research  design  may  play  a  role  in  explaining 
differences  in  dropout  rates  across  studies,  and  neither 
Driessen  et  al.  [19]  or  Meganck  et  al.  [20]  provide  any 
explanation to their large dropout rates.

In  a  study  by  van  Dijk  et  al.  [61]  on  risk  factors  for 
dropout  in  a  large  outpatient  sample  with  depressed 
patients,  they  found  that  higher  socio-economic  status, 
higher  severity  of  the  depression,  comorbid  personal-
ity disorders, or higher levels of anxiety symptoms, were 
associated  with  lower  risk  of  dropout  in  the  treatment 
of  depression.  The  patients  in  Driessen  et  al.  [19]  were 
more depressed at baseline, which would suggest a lower 
chance of dropout. Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly 
compare  socioeconomic  factors  across  studies,  and  nei-
ther  Driessen  et  al.  [19]  or  Meganck  et  al.  [20]  provide 
information on personality disorders.

In line with several other studies of depression, a large 
proportion of the patients did not respond to treatment 
or  had  residual  symptoms.  As  the  long-term  prognosis 
of  depression  concerning  relapse  and  recurrence  is  still 
poor  [3],  and  this  appears  to  correlate  with  the  persis-
tence  of  significant  residual  symptoms  [62],  there  is  an 
urgent need for even more effective treatment. The pres-
ent  study  adds  additional  support  to  the  assertion  that 
CBT  and  STPP  are  effective,  but  also  demonstrate  that 
not all patients remit from short-term treatments, while 
some even deteriorate. This prompts the question of how 
we can enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy even 
further.  Subsequent  research  should  prioritize  investi-
gating  critical  factors,  such  as  identifying  moderators 
and mediators of change to address the crucial question 
of  what  therapeutic  approaches  work  for  whom,  and 
under what circumstances. Our results suggest that some 
patients may benefit from being offered alternative ther-
apy  formats,  additional  medications,  or  non-pharmaco-
logical biological treatments.

Strengths and limitations

The study was conducted in two outpatient clinics within 
the  public  mental  health  services.  In  contrast  to  previ-
ous  studies,  we  have  included  patients  with  current  sui-
cidal  ideation  and  patients  using  antidepressants.  Thus, 
our  results  may  be  generalizable  to  regular  outpatient 

settings.  The  risk  of  allegiance  bias  is  lowered  by  the 
fact  that  the  study  steering  group  consists  of  both  CBT 
and STPP therapists. In addition, our randomized study 
design  with  random  sequence  generation,  allocation 
concealment  and  good  psychometric  inter-rater  reliabil-
ity further reduced the risk of bias. In addition, we have 
included several measures both during and after therapy 
that are seldom reported in effectiveness studies.

However,  this  study  also  has  several  limitations.  The 
relatively  small  number  of  patients  is  a  major  limita-
tion  as  we  are  not  able  to  state  non-inferiority  of  STPP. 
The  MOP  study  was  mainly  designed  to  answer  other 
research  questions,  such  as  identifying  moderators  and 
mediators of change. For the same reason, no untreated 
control group was included. Another aspect that may be 
perceived  as  a  limitation  is  the  disparity  in  the  number 
of  sessions  provided,  with  CBT  offering  16  weekly  ses-
sions and 3 monthly booster sessions, and STPP offering 
28 weekly sessions. We decided to have a dissimilar num-
ber  of  sessions  to  respect  the  fact  that  psychodynamic 
therapies  are  often  longer  and  with  more  sessions  than 
cognitive therapies in regular outpatient clinics. Further-
more, our statistical analyses showed that the number of 
sessions provided was not associated with outcome. The 
different number of sessions in the treatment groups may 
increase  the  external  validity  of  the  study  and  make  the 
results more applicable to a regular outpatient setting.

The therapists received regular supervision using video-
recorded sessions to make sure they provided therapy of 
high quality and adhered to the treatment protocol. How-
ever,  such  supervision  is  rarely  implemented  in  routine 
clinical  practice,  which  could  be  considered  a  limitation 
of  the  study.  Additionally,  it  should  be  acknowledged  as 
a limitation that some patients started using antidepres-
sant medication during therapy, which may have further 
contributed  to  their  improvement.  While  maintaining 
stable medication regimens is typically recommended in 
psychotherapy studies, such restrictions can compromise 
the ecological validity of the results, which was a priority 
in the study design.

Conclusions
The present study revealed no statistically significant dif-
ferences between STPP and CBT in any of the outcome 
measures.  Both  treatments  were  associated  with  large 
effect sizes. With wide inclusion criteria, this study adds 
to  the  current  research  by  providing  results  with  high 
ecological  validity.  In  addition,  our  findings  add  further 
support to the evidence that STPP compares well to CBT 
in  improving  depressive  symptoms,  psychosocial  func-
tioning, anxiety, and mental health-related quality of life 
in  regular  psychiatric  outpatient  clinics.  However,  the 
findings  also  demonstrate  that  not  all  patients  benefit 
from short-term treatment.
