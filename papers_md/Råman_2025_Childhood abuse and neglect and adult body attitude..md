HIGHLIGHTS
•  Over  40%  of  the studied 

adults  reported  emotional 
or  physical  abuse/neglect 
or  sexual  abuse.

•  Negative  adult  body 
attitude  is associated 
strongest  with  childhood 
sexual abuse, but also with 
childhood  emotional 
abuse  and  physical  and 
emotional  neglect.

•  Childhood  physical  abuse 
is associated with a slightly 
more  positive adult  body 
attitude.

ABSTRACT
Background: The body is the medium through which humans experience the world, and the 
body is key to most suffering, healing, and clinical mental diagnoses. Body attitude refers to the 
affective, cognitive, and behavioural aspects of embodiment, which typically is more negative 
in clinical samples.
Objective:  We  examine  how  adult  body  attitude  is  associated  with  self-reported  childhood 
abuse  and  neglect.  We  hypothesised  that  child  sexual  abuse  is  associated  stronger  with  a 
negative  adult  body  attitude  than  emotional  or  physical  abuse/neglect  would.  Second,  we 
expected  that  the  association  between  body  attitude  and  childhood  sexual  abuse  was 
gender  equivalent.  Third,  we  expected  a  more  positive  body  attitude  in  men  than  women 
after childhood physical abuse/neglect or emotional abuse/neglect.
Method: Body attitude was measured with the Dresden Body Image Questionnaire (DBIQ-NL) 
and the severity and type of childhood trauma with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short 
Form (CTQ-SF) in 749 Dutch adults aged 18-77. We fit multiple regression models and focused 
on childhood abuse and neglect with moderate to severe intensity.
Results:  Childhood  sexual  abuse  (∼15%),  physical  neglect  (∼14%),  emotional  abuse  (∼20%) 
and  emotional  neglect  (∼30%)  are  associated  with  a  more  negative  body  attitude,  while 
childhood  physical  abuse  (moderate/severe,  ∼6%)  associated  with  a  slightly  more  positive 
adult  body  attitude.  Body  attitude  associations  with  childhood  abuse/neglect  were  similar 
for both genders (no moderation).
Conclusion: Child maltreatment seems to precede the development of a more negative adult 
body  attitude  and  more  negative  body  experiences  compared  to  individuals  without  child 
maltreatment.

El abuso y negligencia infantil y la actitud corporal adulta  

Antecedentes:  El  cuerpo  es  el  medio  a  través  del  cual  los  seres  humanos  experimentan  el 
mundo,  y  el  cuerpo  es  clave  para  la  mayoría  de  los  diagnósticos  de  sufrimiento,  curación  y 
salud  mental.  La  actitud  corporal  se  refiere  a 
los  aspectos  afectivos,  cognitivos  y 
conductuales de la corporalidad, que normalmente es más negativa en las muestras clínicas.
Objetivo: Examinamos cómo la actitud corporal adulta se asocia con el abuso y la negligencia 
infantil  autoinformados.  Planteamos  la  hipótesis  de  que  el  abuso  sexual  infantil  se  asociaba 
más  fuertemente  con 
la  actitud  corporal  adulta  negativa  que  el  abuso/negligencia 
emocional  o  física.  En  segundo  lugar,  esperábamos  que  la  asociación  entre  la  actitud 
corporal  y  el  abuso  sexual  infantil  fuera  equivalente  en  función  del  género.  En  tercer  lugar, 
esperábamos  una  actitud  corporal  más  positiva  en  los  hombres  que  en  las  mujeres  después 
del abuso/negligencia física o emocional en la infancia.
Método:  La  actitud  corporal  se  midió  con  el  Cuestionario  de  imagen  corporal  de  Dresden 
(DBIQ-NL  en su  sigla en inglés) y la gravedad y el  tipo de trauma  infantil  con el  Cuestionario 
de  trauma  infantil-Formulario  breve  (CTQ-SF  en  sus  siglas  en  inglés)  en  749  adultos 
holandeses  de  entre  18  y  77  años.  Ajustamos  modelos  de  regresión  múltiple  y  nos 
centramos en el abuso y la negligencia infantil con una intensidad de moderada a grave.
Resultados: El abuso sexual infantil (∼15%), la negligencia física (∼14%), el abuso emocional 
(∼20%) y la negligencia emocional (∼30%) se asociaron con una actitud corporal más negativa, 
mientras que el abuso físico infantil (moderado/grave, ∼6%) se asoció con una actitud corporal 
adulta  ligeramente  más  positiva.  Las  asociaciones  de  la  actitud  corporal  con  el  abuso/la 
negligencia infantil fueron similares para ambos sexos (sin moderación).
Conclusión:  El  maltrato  infantil  parece  preceder  al  desarrollo  de  una  actitud  corporal  adulta 
más negativa y de experiencias corporales más negativas en comparación con los individuos 
sin maltrato infantil.

1.  Introduction

We  experience  the  world  through  our  body  and  also 
most of our suffering, healing, and well-being (Geuter, 
2016;  Radley,  2000).  ‘Out-of-tune  embodiment’  and 
experiential issues such as body dissociation, somatic 
complaints,  and/or  body  shame  and  dissatisfaction, 
are  part  and  parcel  of  many  psychiatric  disorders; 
especially stress and trauma disorders, such as anxiety 
and  mood  disorders,  and  somatic  symptom  disorder 
(American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013;  Rønberg, 
2019;  Scheffers,  van  Busschbach  et  al.,  2017). 
Depression, for example, is marked by bodily experi-
ences,  next  to  depressed  affect  and  thoughts  (APA, 
2013).  Childhood  maltreatment  (CM,  i.e.  abuse/ 
neglect)  proves  to  be  a  key  pathway  to  disrupted 
body experience (Bodicker et al., 2022) and is reported 
by  up  to  ∼40%  of  adults  around  the  world  (Stolten-
borgh  et  al.,  2014).  Also,  European  community  esti-
mates  indicate  a  high  prevalence  of  the  five  types  of 
child  maltreatment  that  are  often  distinguished  (see 
Table 1), and which have strong adverse effects on life-
span  development  (Norman  et  al.,  2012).  Reductions 
in  child  maltreatment  are  therefore  a  key  societal 
issue (Gilbert et al., 2009; Sethi et al., 2013).

We aimed to examine how childhood maltreatment 
types  are  associate  with  adult  body  attitude,  such  as 
body  acceptance,  vitality,  self-aggrandisement,  phys-
ical  contact  and  sexual  fulfilment  (e.g.  Scheffers,  van 
Duijn  et  al.,  2017).  From  a  biopsychosocial 

perspective, our body attitude is a combined outcome 
of  biological  factors  (e.g.  body  size),  psychological 
characteristics  (e.g.  negative  affect,  low  self-esteem, 
perfectionism),  childhood  experiences  (e.g.  abuse 
and  neglect,  see  Table  1),  and  sociocultural  pressure 
from  caretakers,  family,  peers,  and  media  (Nichols 
et  al.,  2018).  Childhood  abuse  and  neglect  can  have 
enduring adverse effects on brain development (Hein 
&  Monk,  2017)  and  adult  well-being  (van  der  Kolk, 
2014), such as a 1.5–3.4 times higher risk of fulfilling 
common  clinical  diagnoses  (Norman  et  al.,  2012) 
and  an  86%  higher  risk  of  premature  mortality 
(D’Arcy-Bewick  et  al.,  2022).  Child  maltreatment 
influences  development  via  the  multimodal  systems 
that  underlie  adult  self-awareness  of  the  body  and 
mind  (Ogden  et  al.,  2006;  Tsakiris,  2017).  We  know 
child  maltreatment  types  are  associated  with  differ-
ences  in  emotion  dynamics  (Myroniuk  et  al.,  2024) 
and  specific  somatic  complaints  (Eilers  et  al.,  2023), 
among others. We also know young women typically 
report greater body dissatisfaction than men (Lacroix 
et  al.,  2023),  and  that  child  maltreatment  predicts 
greater  body  dissatisfaction  among  young  women 
(Momeñe  et  al.,  2023).  We  examined  whether  differ-
ences in adult body attitude are associated with differ-
ent  types  of  child  abuse/neglect.  Below  we  first 
introduce  embodied  experiences  and  the  concept  of 
body attitude before, we present our models and syn-
thesise and discuss our results.

CEA+CPA+CSA.  Prime  examples are  verbal  abuse,  humiliation,  and  acts  that  scare  or  terrorise  a  child.

∼29% Acts  of  threat  against  a  minor  child  that  (could  have)  caused  conduct,  cognitive,  affective  or  other  mental disturbance, 
such as verbal abuse, excessive demands on a child’s performance that may lead to negative self-image and disturbed 
behaviour. Verbal assaults on a child’s sense of worth or well-being or any humiliating or demeaning behaviour directed 
towards a child by an adult or older person. Examples incl. disregard for a child’s requests or needs and manipulation of 
emotions,  e.g. withholding  affection,  intentional  social  deprivation,  intimidation/threats,  or  gaslighting.

Physical

CPA

∼23% Actual or attempted infliction of physical pain or injury by adult or older person with or without use of an object or weapon 

Sexual

and  including  use  of  severe  corporal  punishment.  Examples  include  beating,  shaking,  choking, slapping,  biting,  and 
throwing  objects.

∼10% Unwanted and/or coercive (attempted) sexual contact and exposure to age-inappropriate sexual material, environments, 
or  exploitation,  often  conducted  by  adult  or  older  person.  A  dependent,  developmentally  immature  child/adolescent 
(aged <18) is exposed to sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, for which they cannot give consent, and/ 
or  which  violate social  taboo  or  family  roles.

(clothing/food)  and  inattentiveness  to  a  child’s  emotional  and  developmental  needs.

∼18% Acts of deprivation against a minor child that caused or could have caused conduct, cognitive, affective or other mental 
disturbance,  such  as caretakers  who  fail  to  meet  basic  emotional  and  psychological needs,  including  love,  belonging, 
nurturance,  and  support.  One  example  is parents  who  fail  to  arrange  appropriate  education  or  failure  in  providing 
support,  warmth.

∼16% Failure  to  provide  for  a  child’s  basic  survival  needs,  such  as  nutrition,  clothing,  shelter,  hygiene, and  medical  care  (e.g. 
caries). Physical neglect may also involve inadequate supervision of a child and other forms of reckless disregard of the 
child’s  safety  and  welfare,  such  as  seeking needed  medical  care.

Affective and cognitive evaluations of the body i.e. thoughts, perceptions, and beliefs, and the behavioural consequences.
‘I  wish  I  had a  different  body’.  Reflects  how  much  one  accepts  their  body.
‘I  am  physically  fit.’  The  ability  to  live,  grow,  and  develop,  and  to  have  energy  to  be  vigorous  and  active.
‘I use my body to attract attention’. The way how the body is actively used in social interactions to enhance self-esteem.
‘I  do  not  like  people  touching  me’.  The  importance  physical  contact  has  in  one’s  relationships  with  other  people.
‘I  am  very  satisfied  with  my  sexual  experiences’.  Evaluation  of  positive  aspects  of  one’s  own  sexual  experience and 

satisfaction  with  it.

2.  Embodied experiences

One’s  sense  of  self  develops  in  social  interactions 
between  the  infant  and  caregivers  (Shai  &  Fonagy, 
2014),  where  the  body  serves  as  a  prime  medium 
via  touch,  movement,  and  dyadic  synchronisation 
(Ogden  et  al.,  2006).  Body  experience  evolves 
through  different  developmental  processes,  expand-
ing  a  body-centred  experience  of  the  self  (body– 
object) over time into an experience of the self as sub-
ject (body-subject; e.g. Joraschky (1988)) when chil-
dren  start  to  compare  themselves  with  others 
(Lacroix  et  al.,  2023).  A  multimodal  internal  body 
representation  emerges  during  development  from 
bottom-up  and  top-down  processes  that  align  the 
system  levels  (Kearney  &  Lanius,  2022;  Tsakiris, 
2017).  The  development  of  a  healthy  embodied  self 
requires  people  to  be  able  to  distinguish  between 
self  and  other  (Joraschky,  1988),  and  to  experience 
body  ownership,  which  emerges  from  interactions 
between  the  developing  individual  and  the  environ-
ment,  including  caregivers.  The  quality  of  these 
childhood  interactions  may  lead  to  different  out-
comes,  depending  on  whether  the  interaction  sup-
ports  healthy  development,  or  causes  disruptions 
(Sigelman  &  Rider,  2021).  Child  maltreatment  is 
the  key  example  of  disruptive  interaction  that  can 
lead  to  trauma  symptoms  in  adulthood,  and  is  con-
sidered to be a distal risk factor for the development 
of  a  negative  cognitive–affective  body  image  (see 
meta-analysis  by  Bodicker  et  al.,  2022),  in  support 
of  the  expected  link  between  child  abuse/neglect 
and adult body attitude.

interoceptive 

Researchers  use  body  experience  as  an  umbrella 
term that captures at least the domains of body aware-
ness,  body  satisfaction,  and  body  attitude  (Emck  & 
Scheffers,  2019;  Piran,  2019).  Body  awareness  is 
defined  as  the  perception  of  one’s  bodily  states,  pro-
cesses,  and  actions  presumed  to  originate  from  sen-
sory,  proprioceptive,  and 
signals 
accessible  to  conscious  awareness  (Mehling  et  al., 
2009).  Body  satisfaction  refers  to  the  degree  of  con-
tentment  with  body  appearance  or  functionality 
(Orlandi  et  al.,  2006).  In  this  paper,  we  focus  on 
body  attitude  (Fazio  &  Olson,  2003),  which  refers  to 
affective  and  cognitive  evaluations  of  the  body,  as 
well  as  the  behavioural  consequences  (Scheffers, 
Hoek  et  al.,  2017),  and  thus  captures  a  subjective 
and  holistic  view  of  an  individual’s  relationship  with 
their  body  (Pöhlmann  et  al.,  2008).  Body  image,  in 
contrast,  is  a  more  narrow  concept,  that  focuses  on 
visual and perceptual aspects such as one’s dissatisfac-
tion  with  specific  body  parts  or  one’s  appearance,  or 
the  discrepancy  between  one’s  perceived  and  ideal 
body  size.  By  studying  the  broader  concept  of  body 
attitude  we  aim  for  a  deeper  understanding  of  how 
individuals  relate  to  their  bodies  (embodiment),

including  their  emotional  and  cognitive  investment 
towards the self. This approach allows for a more com-
prehensive assessment of body-related issues.

Maltreatment  in  childhood  can  profoundly  influ-
ence body attitude through the disruption of a child’s 
developing sense of self and bodily integrity (Scheffers, 
2018). Experiences of abuse or neglect often lead to an 
altered  state  of  psychological  arousal  and  chronic 
stress,  which  can  result  in  a  distorted  body  attitude 
as  a  protective  mechanism,  such  as  chronic  detach-
ment or self-objectification (Kearney & Lanius, 2022; 
van der Kolk, 2014). The two most harmful character-
istics of traumatic events are the violation of the body- 
boundaries  and  of  physical  integrity (Scheffers,  2018; 
Scheffers, Hoek et al., 2017; van der Kolk, 2006). Pre-
vious  studies  have  shown a  negative  body  attitude  to 
be  associated  with  anxiety  and  depression  (Röhricht 
et  al.,  2002)  and  trauma  and  eating  disorders  (Dyer 
et  al.,  2013),  but  we  enrich  the  literature  with  this 
study of body attitude in a population sample.

3. Childhood maltreatment

Child  abuse  has  an  interpersonal  nature  and  includes 
violation of physical integrity during vulnerable devel-
opmental periods and often circumstances a child can-
not escape (Maercker et al., 2022). Sexual and physical 
abuse have been studied more often than emotional and 
physical  neglect  (Mennen  et  al.,  2010;  Stoltenborgh 
et  al.,  2014).  Although  there  has  long  been  awareness 
of  emotional  abuse  and  neglect  being  child  maltreat-
ment  types  with  different  downstream  consequences, 
only a few validated instruments distinguish child mal-
treatment subtypes, which typically co-occur (Mennen 
et  al.,  2010;  Myroniuk  et  al.,  2024).  The  most  used 
instrument  to  study  child  maltreatment  types  is  the 
Childhood  Trauma  Questionnaire-Short  Form  (CTQ- 
SF;  Bernstein  et  al.,  2003),  which  distinguishes  the 
child  maltreatment  types  mentioned  and  studied  in 
this  paper  (see  Table  1).  Child  maltreatment  has  been 
studied  widely  in  clinical  populations  because  of  its 
increased risk of common mental disorders (Borgmann 
et al., 2014; Dyer et al., 2013; Rohde et al., 2008).

Studies  on  the  relationship  between  child  maltreat-
ment  and  body  attitude  in  clinical  populations  have 
emerged  recently  (Scheffers,  Hoek  et  al.,  2017)  but 
there  is  no  data  on  their  relationship  in  adult  popu-
lation samples, although associations with related con-
cepts  have  been  established  (Bodicker  et  al.,  2022). 
Thus, although a history of child maltreatment is linked 
to  a  variety  of  social,  psychological  and  somatic  pro-
blems  later  in  life  (Clemens  et  al.,  2018;  Sack  et  al., 
2010; Scheffers, Hoek et al., 2017), the question remains 
whether  and  how  these  early  traumatic  experiences 
associate  with  adult  body  attitude  in  non-clinical 
adult populations. The differential associations between 

4 

L. RÅMAN ET AL.

types of abuse/neglect and specific adult somatic com-
plaints (Eilers et al., 2023) and emotion dynamics (Myr-
oniuk  et al., 2024) also  suggest diverging relationships 
for  body  attitude.  Moreover,  studies  of  clinical  popu-
lations  suggest  that  sexual  abuse  leads  to  more,  and 
more  severe,  problems  in  body  experience  and  body 
satisfaction  than  other  types  of  maltreatment  (Sack 
et al., 2010). This paper aimed to explore the relation-
ship  between  exposure  to  five  child  maltreatment 
types  and  adult  body  attitude  in  a  sample  of  Dutch 
adults from the general population.

4.  Gender differences

Research  on  gender  differences  in  body  image  and 
body attitude concepts is inconsistent. Gender differ-
ences in body appreciation across forty studies in the 
general  population  indicated  that  men  tend  to  be 
more  appreciative  of  their  bodies  than  women  (He 
et al., 2020). A meta-analysis of gender differences in 
self-esteem concluded that in non-clinical populations 
men  tend  to  have  more  self-esteem  than  women  do 
(Bleidorn et al., 2016). The prevalence of child sexual 
abuse in women seems to be at least twice that in men 
(Sawyerr  &  Adam-Bagley,  2023),  and  the  conse-
quences  of  child  sexual  abuse  in  women  received 
more  attention  than  those  in  men  (O’Leary  et  al., 
2017). Clinical samples with early child maltreatment 
in  women  showed  severely  impaired  self-reported 
body attitude (on the Dresden Body Image Question-
naire  (DBIQ-NL;  Scheffers,  van  Duijn  et  al.,  2017)). 
There are indications that sexual abuse amongst men 
is  underreported  (O’Leary  et  al.,  2017),  as  men  tend 
to struggle with disclosure (often delayed by 20 years 
or  more)  and  non-disclosure,  compromised  masculi-
nity,  shame,  and  confused  sexuality  (O’Leary  et  al., 
2017), and clinical and societal bias (Gruenfeld et al., 
2017).  In  the  few  studies  that  examined  child  sexual 
abuse 
long-term  effects  were 
observed, similar to women, including serious disturb-
ances  of  mental  functioning  (O’Leary  et  al.,  2017). 
Since  sexual  abuse  violates  the  body-boundaries  and 
physical  integrity  in  both  genders  and  other  popu-
lation  studies  of  child  sexual  abuse  did  not  observe 
salient gender differences (Myroniuk et al., 2024), we 
expected that child sexual abuse affected body attitude 
in both women and men in comparable ways. We also 
explore gender differences in the association between 
physical  and  emotional  abuse/neglect  and  body  atti-
tude and expected affected men to report less negative 
body  attitude  than  women  do,  on  average,  based  on 
the aforementioned reviews.

in  men,  adverse 

5.  This study

In  this  paper,  we  examine  the  relationships  between 
five  different  child  maltreatment  types  (see  Table  1) 

and adult body attitude. We hypothesise (H1) that sex-
ual  abuse  has  a  more  severe  and  negative  impact  on 
body  attitude  than  physical  or  emotional  abuse  or 
physical  or  emotional  neglect.  Second,  we  examine 
gender differences in how the five types of child mal-
treatment are associated with adult body attitude. We 
expect (H2a) that sexual abuse is associated with simi-
lar  differences  in  body  attitude  in  both  women  and 
men.  For  physical  (H2b)  and  emotional  abuse  and 
neglect  (H2c),  however,  we  hypothesise  that  men 
report  a  more  positive  body  attitude  than  neglected/ 
abused  women  do.  We  hope  that  our  study  results 
help  propel  our  understanding  of  the  link  between 
different  types  of  child  maltreatment  and  body  atti-
tude  and  help  identify  the  vulnerabilities  that  nega-
tively influence lifespan development.

6. Method

6.1.  Participants

Data  were  derived  from  a  Dutch  crowdsourcing 
research  project 
called  HowNutsAreTheDutch 
(HND),  which  was  designed  to  study  mental  health 
as  a dimensional  and  dynamic phenomenon,  charac-
terised  by  both  vulnerabilities  and  strengths  (see  van 
der  Krieke  et  al.,  2016).  We  selected  adults  (aged 
≥18  years)  who  completed  the  Dutch  version  of  the 
Dresden  Body  Image  Questionnaire  (DBIQ-NL) 
measuring body attitude (N =  811) and the Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), which 
left  us  with  a  final  sample  of  749  participants.  Com-
parisons  between  included  participants  and  those 
who did not complete these instruments are provided 
in the supplement.

6.2.  Procedure

Dutch citizens were invited to participate in the HND 
project at www.HoeGekIs.nl by means of radio broad-
casts, television, newspapers, magazines, podium dis-
cussions,  and  social  media.  Participants  had  to 
register  on  the  website  and  create  an  account  and 
could then complete multiple mental health question-
naires  (or  topical  modules)  and/or  take  part  in  a  30- 
day ecological momentary assessment (EMA, see van 
der  Krieke  et  al.,  2016).  The  HND  platform  was 
launched  on  December  19th,  2013,  and  the  data  set 
for  the  present  study  was  extracted  on  December 
19th, 2017. The first four questionnaires pertained to 
sociodemographic  variables  and  affect/mood  and 
well-being. After completing these, all other question-
naires  became  available,  including  the  body  attitude 
and  childhood  trauma  questionnaires.  The  com-
pletion of all questionnaires was voluntary and could 
be  completed  in  any  order.  The  participants  had  no 
specific  information  about  the  kinds  of  studies  that 

would be conducted on the collected data. The HND 
study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee 
of the University Medical Center Groningen, Nether-
lands 
and 
(registration  numbers  M13.147422 
M14.160855). All details and procedures are described 
in van der Krieke et al. (2016).

6.3.  Measures

Child  maltreatment  was  measured  with  the  28-item 
Childhood  Trauma  Questionnaire-Short  Form 
(CTQ-SF, Bernstein et al., 2003). The CTQ-SF exam-
ines  recollections  of  five  dimensions  of  childhood 
trauma subdivided into physical, emotional, and sex-
ual  abuse,  and  physical  and  emotional  neglect,  with 
five items each. The frequency of each item is scored 
on  a  5-point  Likert  scale  from  1  (never  true)  to  5 
(very often true). Clinical cut-off values are given for 
four trauma severity levels for each subscale: none or 
minimal  (CEA:  5-8;  CPA:  5-7;  CSA:  5;  CEN:  5-9; 
CPN:  5-7);  mild  (CEA:  9-12;  CPA:  8-9;  CSA:  6-7; 
CEN:  10-14;  CPN:  8-9);  moderate  (CEA:  13-15; 
CPA:  10-12;  CSA:  8-12;  CEN:  15-17;  CPN:  10-12) 
and severe trauma (CEA: ≥16; CPA: ≥13; CSA: ≥13; 
CEN:  ≥18;  CPN:  ≥13)  (see  Bernstein  &  Fink,  1998). 
Although a retrospective questionnaire on child mal-
treatment  may  suffer  from  both  underreporting  and 
overreporting,  previous  work  has  found  different 
scores for groups known to vary on childhood trauma, 
validity 
thereby 
(Thombs  et  al.,  2009).  Besides,  the  CTQ-SF  has 
shown  convergence  with  a  childhood  trauma  inter-
view,  indicating  similarity  in  self-rated  versus  clini-
cian-rated  reports  of  trauma  (Bernstein  &  Fink, 
1998)  and  with  data  from  knowledgeable  informants 
(Bernstein et al., 2003).

demonstrating

for 

The internal consistency of the Dutch translation of 
the CTQ-SF administered to community and psychia-
tric  populations  varied  in  terms  of  Cronbach  α 
between .63–.95 (Thombs et al., 2009). In the present 
sample,  the  subscales  proved  reliable  (CPN  α = .59, 
CPA  α =   .79,  CSA  α =   .87,  CEA  α =   .88,  and  CEN 
α =   .92).  Both  Thombs  et  al.  (2009)  and  Spinhoven 
et  al.  (2014)  dropped  the  ‘molested’  item  in  the 
Dutch  version,  resulting  in  four  rather  than  five 
items 
the  subscale  sexual  abuse.  Although 
‘molested’  more  clearly  refers  to  sexually  abusive 
behaviour  in  English,  the  translated  Dutch  word 
does  not  necessarily  have  this  sexual  connotation. 
We  chose  to  keep  the  dropped  item  (item  24)  in  the 
present  study,  to  be  able  to  compare  our  results  to 
those  in  other  studies  using  the  English  CTQ-SF  or 
translations  to  other  languages.  Furthermore,  this 
enables  us  to  use  the  recommended  cut-off  scores 
(Bernstein  &  Fink,  1998).  Good  internal  consistency 
of  the  sexual  abuse  subscale  suggests  that  this  was 
not a problem.

Body attitude was assessed using the Dutch version 
of  the  35-item  Dresden  Body  Image  Questionnaire 
(DBIQ-NL; Scheffers, van Duijn et al., 2017). Dresden 
Körperbildfragebogen 
instrument 
derived  from  three  German  questionnaires  of  body 
image: ‘Fragebogen zum Körperbild’ (FKB20), ‘Frage-
bogen  zur  Bewertung  des  eigenen  Körpers’  (FBeK), 
and  the  ‘Frankfurter  Körper  Konzept  Skalen’  (FKKS, 
see  Scheffers,  van  Duijn  et  al.,  2017).  The  DBIQ-NL 
measures  the  multidimensional  character  of  body 
attitude  with  five  dimensions  determined  by  factor 
analysis: body vitality, body acceptance, self-aggrand-
isement,  physical  contact,  and  sexual  fulfilment,  see 
Table  1 for  items  (Pöhlmann  et  al.,  2008;  Pöhlmann 
et  al.,  2014).  Responses  were  scored  on  a  five-point 
Likert  scale  from  (1)  ‘not  at  all’  to  (5)  ‘entirely’  and 
higher  scores  indicate  a  more  positive  body  attitude. 
The  internal  consistency  of  the  Dutch  translation 
(DBIQ-NL) administered in a non-clinical sample var-
ied from α =  .83 for self-aggrandisement to α =  .92 for 
sexual  fulfilment  (Scheffers,  van  Duijn  et  al.,  2017). 
The  alphas  for  the  subscales  in  the  present  study 
were:  body  acceptance  α =   .81,  physical  contact  α =  
.86, self-aggrandisement α =  .91, vitality α =  .91, and 
sexual  fulfilment  α =   .92.  Finally,  scale  invariance 
across  sex  and  age  were  reported  by  Scheffers,  van 
Duijn et  al.  (2017) who  concluded that  the question-
naire is invariant in non-clinical groups.

6.4.  Covariates

The  sociodemographic  covariates  age  (continuous) 
and  gender  (0 =  female,  1 =  male)  were  included  as 
covariates in the analyses because of their correlation 
with  the  CTQ-SF  (Witt  et  al.,  2017)  and  DBIQ-NL 
(Scheffers,  van  Duijn  et  al.,  2017)  and  because  of 
their distribution in the sample (see Table 2).

6.5.  Statistical  analysis

All analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 
29.0.1.0.  For  descriptives,  the  sum  scores  for  child 
maltreatment  types  were  computed.  Bernstein  and 
Fink  (1998)  categorised  the  severity  of  the  trauma 
exposure  of  the  child  maltreatment  types  (see  Table 
1)  into  four  categories,  namely,  none  to  minimal, 
mild,  moderate  and  severe  trauma.  We  recoded  the 
categories into a dummy: 0 =  none to mild exposure 
and  1 =   moderate  to  severe  exposure  to  examine 
differences  in  group  means  between  participants 
with  moderate  to  severe  abuse  and  neglect  (1)  in 
terms  of  adult  body  attitude,  to  facilitate  analytic 
ease  and  communication  clarity,  albeit  at  the  cost  of 
reduced  statistical  power  (Iacobucci  et  al.,  2015). 
This can be offset by our larger sample. We estimated 
the  differences  between  (sub-)groups  with  t-tests.

divided  by  standard  deviation)  were  expressed  as 
Cohen’s  d  and  group  differences  were  considered  to 
be  small  between  0.20  and  0.49,  moderate  between 
0.50 and 0.79, and large if >0.80 (Cohen, 1992).

To  explore  the  relationship  between  exposure  to 
different types of trauma and body attitude, a multiple 
linear  regression  analysis  was  conducted.  Childhood 
maltreatment subscale scores were taken as predictor 
variables of body attitude in adulthood. In the adjusted 
analysis gender and age were included as covariates.

To determine whether (H1) sexual abuse leads to a 
more  negative  body  attitude  than  the  other  maltreat-
ment  types,  several  dummy  variables  were  used.  We 
noted that child maltreatment intensity (0/1) was indi-
cated by ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’ exposure on a particular 
subscale,  a  dummy  code  that  was  used  to  estimate 
differences  between  (a)  abuse  (CPA/CEA),  (b)  neglect 
(CPN/CEN),  and  (c)  no  abuse/neglect.  The  presence 
of  sexual  abuse  (CSA)  was  the  reference  group.  In 
this analysis, the participants who suffered both neglect 
and abuse in the absence of sexual abuse were excluded.
In  the  second  multiple  regression  analysis,  every-
one  who  reported  childhood  sexual  abuse  was 
included as the reference group (CSA). Dummy cod-
ing  was  used  for  all  possible  combinations  of  abuse 
and neglect (CPA, CEA, CPN and CEN) and the par-
ticipants without child maltreatment experiences.

To test (H2a, H2b, H2c) for an interaction effect of 
gender  and  child  maltreatment  in  the  prediction  of 
body  attitude,  a  multiple  linear  regression  analysis 
with  the  interaction  terms  (type  of  CM  ×  gender)  as 
independent variables and body attitude as dependent 
variable  was  conducted.  Significance  was  defined  as 
p ≤ .05 following convention.

7. Results

Sample  characteristics  are  given  in  Table  2.  Partici-
pants were aged 18–77 years. Men were about a decade 
older than women, on average (Mage =  52.5 ± 12.7 vs. 
42.6  ±  14.3,  t(747) = −8.10,  p<.001).  Approximately 
80% of the participants were highly educated. Second-
ary education was the highest completed level for 15%, 
and basic education for 4%.

The prevalence of the different types of child mal-
treatment  in  the  sample  is  presented  in  Table  3.  The 
cut-off  scores  for  moderate  maltreatment  intensity 
were  used  for  all  subscales  (Bernstein  &  Fink,  1998), 
which  resulted  in  43.1%  of  the  participants  who 
reported  child  maltreatment,  most  commonly 
emotional  neglect  (31.1%),  followed  by  emotional 
abuse  (19.5%),  sexual  abuse  (15.2%)  and  physical 
neglect  (13.9%).  The  prevalence  of  physical  abuse 
(5.7%) was comparatively low.

7.1.  Child  maltreatment  and  body  attitude

To examine whether sexual abuse stood out as a pre-
dictor  of  body  attitude  we  fit  a  multiple  regression 
analysis to predict adult body attitude with differences 
in  five  child  maltreatment  types  (Model  F(7,  741) =  
11.87,  p  <  .001).  The  five  trauma  types  explained 
10%  of  differences  in  body  attitude  (R² = .10).  Sexual 
abuse, physical abuse and emotional neglect were sig-
nificant  predictors  of  body  attitude  differences,  but 
physical  neglect  and  emotional  abuse  were  unrelated 
(see  Table  4).  There  was  an  unexpected  positive  sig-
nificant association between physical abuse and body 
attitude.  Gender  showed  a  significant  main  effect  (B  
= 0.161, 95% CI [0.060, 0.262], p = .002). Age seemed 
unrelated to differences in body attitude.

To examine whether sexual abuse predicted a more 
negative  body  attitude  than  nonsexual  types  of  child 
maltreatment  we  used  dummy  coding  for  at  least 
moderate severity (a) abuse (physical and emotional), 
(b) neglect (physical and emotional), and (c) no abuse/ 
neglect. Sexual abuse was the reference category. The 
group having suffered both abuse and neglect without 
sexual  abuse  were  excluded  (resulting  in  n =   665 
included).  Indeed,  child  maltreatment  predicted  6% 
of  body  attitude  (R² = .061,  F(5,  659) = 8.62,  p<.001) 
and  those  without  child  maltreatment  and  neglected 
participants  showed  differences  in  body  attitude  (see 
Table 5). Abuse was unrelated to body attitude. Gen-
der  scores  indicated  that  men  scored  significantly 
higher on body attitude than women.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

The model in Table 5 also shows that an individual 
without child maltreatment reported a more positive 
average body attitude (+0.32 points) than an individ-
ual who experienced sexual abuse. An individual hav-
ing  suffered  abuse  (excluding  sexual  abuse)  as  a 
minor, scored a more positive average body attitude 
(+0.26  points)  than  an  individual  who  has  suffered 
childhood  sexual  abuse,  but  the  difference  was  not 
statistically significant. An individual having suffered 
neglect  in  childhood  also  reported  a  more  positive 
average body attitude (+0.18 points) than an individ-
ual  who  has  suffered  sexual  abuse.  This  value  was 
significant.

When  looking  at  the  differences  in  body  attitude 
between  the  groups  that  have  suffered  (a)  sexual 
abuse,  (b)  all  possible  combinations  of  physical/ 
emotional  abuse/neglect,  and  (c)  no  abuse/neglect, 
the  overall  regression  was  statistically  significant  (R²  
=  .059, F(4,  744) =  11.75, p< .001).

An  individual  having  suffered  any  type  of  child 
maltreatment  other  than  sexual  abuse,  on  average, 
reports  a  more  positive  body  attitude  (+0.16  points) 
than  those  exposed  to  sexual  abuse.  An  individual 
with no experience of child maltreatment, on average, 
scores  a  more  positive  body  attitude  (+0.32  points) 
than  those  who  experienced  child  sexual  abuse. 
Both,  the  dummy  variable  abuse  and  neglect  in  one 
and  no  child  maltreatment,  were  found  to  be  signifi-
cant predictors of body attitude. Gender showed a sig-
nificant main effect in which men were more positive 
on average, while age seemed unrelated (see Table 6).

To  explore  gender  differences  in  the  associations, 
first,  an  independent  samples  t-test  was  performed 
to  compare  the  scores  of  the  child  maltreatment 
types between women (n =  579) and men (n =  170). 
As  shown  in  Table  7,  women  reported  more  sexual 
abuse  (d =   0.19)  and  emotional  abuse  (d =   0.24) 
than  men  did.  The  other  child  maltreatment  scales 
did not differ.

To determine whether gender moderated the influ-
ence of child maltreatment on body attitude (H2a-c), 
interaction  terms  were  calculated  for  gender  and  the 
types  of  child  maltreatment.  In  Table  8 we  present 
the  results  of  Model  2  which  predicted  10.2%  of 
body  attitude  (R² =   .102,  F(7,  737) =   7.63,  p<.001). 
Model 2 was expanded with interaction terms for gen-
der,  which  accounted  for  an  additional  0.2%  of  the 
variation in  the body  attitude  scores,  but these inter-
statistically  nonsignificant.

Childhood  sexual  abuse,  physical  abuse,  emotional

effects.  Childhood  emotional  abuse  and  physical 
neglect  were  not  significant  predictors,  as  was  the 
case  also  in  Model  1  (not  including  the  interaction 
terms).

Table 9 and Figure 1 show the mean scores for body 
attitude and the mean scores for the five subscales with 
the sample divided into three groups (a) sexual abuse 
present, (b) abuse and/or neglect present (nonsexual), 
(c) no child maltreatment.

8. Discussion

In this study, we examined associations between body 
attitude  and  five  types  of  child  maltreatment  in 
749  adults  from  the  Dutch  general  population  (see 
Tables  1 and  2).  Participants  who  experienced

childhood  sexual  abuse  reported  more  severe  adult 
problems  in  body  attitude  than  other  child  maltreat-
ment  types,  when  analysing  the  five  trauma  types  as 
separate  variables,  or  all  five  types  combined,  when 
especially sexual abuse helped to differentiate between 
adult  body  attitude,  whereas  emotional  and  physical 
abuse provided no additional information. Body atti-
tude  was  also  lower  in  participants  who  reported 
emotional  abuse  and  emotional  and  physical  neglect 
(vs. participants without). Three additional key obser-
vations were that childhood physical abuse (moderate/ 
severe) was associated with a more positive adult body 
attitude.  Associations  between  child  maltreatment 
types  and  adult  body  attitude  were  similar  for  both 
genders  (i.e.  no  moderation).  Emotional  neglect  was 
most  common  and  reported  by  ∼30%  of  the  respon-
dents,  and  emotional  abuse  by  ∼20%,  sexual  abuse

by  ∼15%,  physical  neglect  by  ∼14%,  physical  abuse 
by ∼6%. These five observations will now be discussed 
in more detail below.

Body  attitude,  including  cognitive,  affective  and 
behavioural  components,  was  poorer  in  adults  with 
child  maltreatment  experiences  than  among  those 
without.  Maltreatment  seems  to  disturb  the  healthy 
development  of  the  self,  which  starts  in  infancy  and 
is first and foremost situated in the body in the early 
phase  (Tsakiris,  2017).  As  outlined  in  the  introduc-
tion,  a  healthy  development  of  the  embodied  self 
requires people to be able to distinguish between self 
and  other,  thus  establishing  stable  body  boundaries 
(Joraschky,  1988).  Maltreatment  in  the  early  attach-
ment period can destabilise these boundaries, compli-
cating  this  differentiation  process,  as  is  evident  in 
disturbances  in  social  information  processing  net-
works  (e.g.  Hein  &  Monk,  2017;  van  der  Kolk, 
2014). Child sexual abuse and physical abuse are con-
sidered a violation of the developing body boundaries 
(see  Table  1),  and  are  seen  as  disruptive  to  healthy 
development. A lower body attitude  score was  found 
in  the  group  that  had  suffered  childhood  sexual 
abuse  than  in  the  group  that  had  suffered  nonsexual 
child maltreatment types or no child maltreatment.

Previous  work  also  detected  that  body  dissatisfac-
tion was stronger among women who survived sexual 
trauma than those with nonsexual trauma or without 
trauma (Sack et al., 2010). However, Sack et al. (2010) 
did not specify at what age the participant experienced 
the traumatic event, as often is the case in retrospec-
tive  studies.  A  survey  of  adolescents  (15-year  olds) 
found  that  sexual  abuse  history  was  associated  with 
poorer  body  image  and  lower  self-esteem  in  the

victims compared to non-victims (Mignot et al., 2018). 
Our study was restricted to adults, while maltreatment 
was  limited  to  childhood  and  adolescence  (Bernstein 
et  al.,  2003).  None  of  the  reviewed  studies  collected 
more specific information on the age when child mal-
treatment  occurred,  even  though  age  gives  a  good 
indication  of  the  developmental  phase  of  a  child 
which seems to influence the consequences of (sexual) 
abuse (e.g. Andersen et al., 2008). Sexual development 
in adolescence is an example of such a specific phase, 
when sexual thoughts, feelings, and behaviours change 
and  mature  (Sigelman  &  Rider,  2021).  Positive  sexu-
ality  development  is  considered  beneficial  for  well- 
being outcomes (Maes et al., 2023). Variation in out-
comes  among  adults  exposed  to  childhood  maltreat-
ment  may  be  explained  (in  part)  by  the  timing  of 
maltreatment  or  specific  windows  of  vulnerability  in 
development, although the literature on such age win-
dows of vulnerability for child maltreatment remains 
inconclusive (Schaefer et al., 2022).

Sexual  abuse  and  physical  abuse  are  violations  of 
the body boundaries and physical integrity. In the cur-
rent study sexual abuse correlated, as expected, nega-
tively  with  body  attitude,  whereas  physical  abuse 
showed  surprisingly  positive  correlations.  Different 
attitudes  towards  the  maltreatment  subtypes  may 
play  a  role.  In  past  decennia,  a  fundamental  change 
can  be  detected,  especially  in  the  attitude  towards 
physical abuse (Bullinger et al., 2020). The boundaries 
between  right  and  wrong  are  mostly  clear-cut  when 
considering  child  sexual  abuse.  On  the  other  hand, 
some forms of physical abuse, such as spanking or cor-
poral  punishment,  have  long  been  culturally  con-
sidered  an  accepted  parental  disciplinary  method 
(Benjet & Kazdin, 2003). Since 2007, the Dutch Civil 
Code  has  stated  that  caregivers  are  not  allowed  to 
use  physical  violence  when  educating  or  correcting 
children’s  behaviour.  The  cultural  change  towards 
no  acceptance  of  parental  disciplinarian  behaviours 
falling  under  physical  abuse  unfolded  over  years 
before it became part of the Civil Code. The low occur-
rence of physical abuse in the current sample is hope-
fully  an  effect  of  the  change  in  legislature  and  the 
general  attitude,  as  child  maltreatment  rates  have 
been steadily decreasing in the past decades (e.g. Bul-
linger et al., 2020).

The  positive  correlation  between  physical  abuse 
and  body  attitude  may  be  explained  by  a  study  on 
the  consequences  of  spanking,  which  reported  little 
evidence  that  mild  and  incidental  physical  punish-
ment  would  have  strong  negative  consequences  for 
the  development  of  the  child  (Benjet  &  Kazdin, 
2003). One explanation might be that childhood phys-
ical abuse always contains interaction, however nega-
tive. From a developmental perspective, even negative 
interaction,  presumably  with  the  caregivers,  might 
satisfy  a  need  for  interaction  or  satisfy  a  sense  of 

being  seen.  Alternatively,  once  children  become 
adults,  they  can  no  longer  be  so  easily  physically 
hurt  and  dominated,  which  increases  their  sense  of 
control.  Previous  work  connected  physical  abuse  to 
adaptive  and  positive  adult  outcomes  such  as  higher 
positive affect and lower anxiety and depression (Myr-
oniuk et al., 2024; Sudbrack et al., 2015). In the present 
dataset,  physical  abuse  is  also  associated  positively 
with  well-being  domains  such  as  personal  autonomy 
(Jeronimus et al., 2024).

With regard to gender differences, we hypothesised 
that victims of sexual abuse would show no difference 
in  body  attitude  score,  while  for  the  other  four  child 
maltreatment  types  we  expected  that  women  would 
report  a  lower  body  attitude,  based  on  studies  in 
which women  reported  worse on  body  image  related 
domains than men (Cash et al., 2004; He et al., 2020; 
Longobardi  et  al.,  2022).  In  our  sample,  none  of  the 
interaction  terms  were  found  to  be  significant.  Thus, 
the  association  between  any  of  the  physical  or 
emotional  maltreatment  types  and  body  attitude  was 
not dependent on gender, as was also the case for sex-
ual abuse.

The maltreatment subtypes have not received equal 
attention in the past. Research on the prevalence and 
effects  of  sexual  abuse  emerged  some  four  decades 
ago  and  was  soon  followed  by  research  on  physical 
abuse  and  only  later  on  the  other  types  of  maltreat-
ment (Stoltenborgh et al., 2014). When the five child 
maltreatment  types  were  included  separately  as  pre-
dictors  of  body  attitude,  emotional  neglect,  sexual 
abuse and physical abuse were found to be significant 
predictors  of  body  attitude.  In  a  German  general 
population  sample  aged  14–21,  Wendler-Bodicker 
et  al.  (2023)  found  emotional  neglect  and  emotional 
abuse to be significant predictors of body dissatisfac-
tion.  In  our  adult  sample,  as  in  the  youth  sample  of 
Wendler-Bodicker  et  al.  (2023),  the  occurrence  of 
emotional  neglect  was  most  frequent  compared  to 
the other four maltreatment subtypes.

One  characteristic  difference  between  abuse  and 
neglect is that abuse can be a onetime event, whereas 
neglect is  more structural and  happens  over a  longer 
period  of  time.  Shai  and  Fonagy  (2014)  postulate 
that  the  development  of  the  subjective  self  depends 
on  the  verbal  and  non-verbal  interaction  with  the 
caregiver.  In  childhood  emotional  neglect  there  is  a 
lack  in  the  amount  of  contact  between  the  child  and 
caregiver, the  child’s  emotions  are not  seen  and  vali-
dated,  or  the  presence  of  the  caregiver  is  completely 
missing (Table 1). Thus, emotional neglect is the omis-
sion of essential and necessary components for normal 
development.  A  possible  explanation  for  an  altered 
body  attitude  after  emotional  neglect  could  be  its 
effect  on  the  attachment  relationship.  Associations 
between  attachment  styles  and  body  appreciation  in 
adolescents  with  and  without  eating  disorders 

indicated  that  safe  attachment  is  related  to  a  higher 
body  appreciation  than  dysfunctional  attachment 
styles,  which  was  observed  both in  the  clinical  group 
and among ‘healthy’ controls (Laporta-Herrero et al., 
2022).  Evidently,  child  attachment  styles  have  conse-
quences for the development of adult body experience 
in  a  broader  sense  and  specifically  the  attitudes  and 
behaviours  one  applies  to  one’s  body  later  in  life. 
Based on the high prevalence of emotional neglect in 
retrospective  reports  and  the  harmful  consequences 
for attachment and further development, neglect as a 
type of child maltreatment deserves more attention.

As different types  of maltreatment often co-occur, 
the  influence  of  the  separate  forms  of  maltreatment 
on  body  attitude  should  be  interpreted  with  caution. 
Clemens et al. (2018) studied the effects of child mal-
treatment  on  long-term  physical  health  and  found  a 
cumulative  effect  when  a  combination  of  two  or 
three maltreatment types was experienced. Body atti-
tude could also be negatively affected by the cumulat-
ive  effect  of multiple  child maltreatment types, as  we 
observed  a  substantial  overlap  in  the  maltreatment 
subtypes in our sample.

9.  Strengths and limitations

Strengths of the present study include the large commu-
nity  sample  including  men  and  women  of  a  wide  age 
range. The study of child maltreatment is built on predo-
minantly female-samples and a strength of our study lies 
in  the  crowdsourcing  data  collection  method  in  the 
HND-project, which allowed participants to fill out the 
questionnaires  in  any  order  they  liked  (reduces  order 
effects),  and  participants  perceived  themselves  to  be 
anonymous,  which  reduces  social  desirability  and  self- 
representation bias. At the time of filling out the ques-
tionnaires participants had no knowledge of which ques-
tionnaires  would  later  be  combined  in  research.  The 
online crowdsourcing strategy may result in recruitment 
bias,  and  the  HND  sample  comprised  predominantly 
women  and  higher-educated  individuals,  but  was  in 
many  ways  more  diverse  and  representative  of  mental 
health states or elderly Dutch than the large population 
samples in the Netherlands (e.g. Lifelines, NESDA), see 
van der Krieke et al. (2016) for details.

Sexuality is often a problematic body-related issue 
in  patients  with  mental  disorders  as  well  as  somatic 
disorders  and 
instruments  measuring  attitudes 
towards  sexuality  are  scarce.  The  subscale  of  sexual 
fulfilment  in  Dresden  Body  Image  Questionnaire 
measures just that and the subscale emerged as a sep-
arate factor in the original German version (Pöhlmann 
et al., 2008) as well as in the Dutch version (Scheffers, 
van Duijn et al., 2017). Filling out a self-report ques-
tionnaire  via  the  online  crowdsourcing  strategy  has 
enabled  the  collection  of  data  in  this  area  in  the 
Dutch adult population.

One  limitation  is  the  cross-sectional  design  which 
does not allow causal inferences. A further limitation 
is  the  use  of  retrospective  self-report  questionnaires 
for  data  collection,  which  may  result  in  recall  bias, 
and  manifest  in  several  ways  (e.g.  Baldwin  et  al., 
2024).  Young  adults  report  their  childhood  experi-
ences closer in time than older adults and could there-
fore be expected to have less memory bias. The lack of 
distance to the experiences at a younger age might also 
be  problematic  if  hurtful  memories  are  repressed  or 
denied.  Older  adults  have  had  more  time  to  reflect 
on  their  upbringing  and  the  relationship  with  their 
caregivers,  which  might  help  them  to  come  to  terms 
with  the  possible  shortcomings,  accepting  the  past 
for  what  it  is.  On  the  other  hand  anonymity  may 
help  the  respondent  answer  the  questions  truthfully 
by  diminishing  the  fear  factor  of  speaking  against 
one’s  caregivers  or  by  lifting  the  need  to  protect 
one’s  childhood  memories,  regardless  of  age.  After 
all, in the field of child maltreatment anonymous ret-
rospective self-reports are a highly valuable source of 
information (Clemens et al., 2018).

The  DBIQ  has  been  studied  for  its  psychometric 
properties  in  Western  cultures  only.  It  is  possible 
that in non-Western cultures the concept of body atti-
tude based on the present items would take a different 
factorial structure. Results thus cannot be generalised. 
The  influence  of  culture  on  body  attitude  should  be 
explored in future studies.

Our study lacked exact information on the age one 
was  maltreated,  which  is  a  shared  feature  in  studies 
using  the  Childhood  Trauma  Questionnaire-Short 
Form  (CTQ-SF).  This  questionnaire  determines  the 
presence or absence of abuse and neglect during child-
hood  and  adolescence  and  gives  an  indication  of  the 
severity  per  maltreatment  subtype.  The  CTQ-SF 
does  not  capture  information  on  whether  an  experi-
ence was ongoing, or during which age-related devel-
opmental phase it took place. In future studies, more 
specific information on age and duration of child mal-
treatment  is  relevant  to  identify  ‘windows  of  sensi-
tivity’,  such  as  the  first  five  years  of  life.  However, 
child maltreatment occurring during, or across, differ-
ent developmental stages, may affect body attitude in 
different ways.

To  conclude,  in  the  past  child  maltreatment  has 
been  shown  to  influence  different  domains  of  well- 
being.  The  current  study  indicated  a  high  risk  that 
the domain of body attitude is also affected. Child mal-
treatment can be seen as a risk factor for the develop-
ment of a more negative body attitude. Although body 
attitude  is  a  subjective  evaluation  of  one’s  own  feel-
ings,  thoughts  and  beliefs  about  one’s  body,  these 
evaluations  are  formed  during  interactions  with 
others.  Harmful  childhood  interactions,  such  as 
abuse  and  neglect,  may  result  in  a  problematic  body 
attitude  far  into  the  future.  It  is  important  that  this 

12

link  gains  more  attention.  Experiences  of  child  mal-
treatment are common as is shown in our non-clinical 
sample.  And  after  all,  body  attitude  deserves  more 
attention  because  it  is  a  central  theme  in  every 
human being.
