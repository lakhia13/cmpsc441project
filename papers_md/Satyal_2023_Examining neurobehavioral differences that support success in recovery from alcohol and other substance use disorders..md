Abstract

Objective:  Substance use disorders (SUDs) are brain disorders associated with impairments 
resulting from the recurrent use of alcohol, drugs, or both. Though recovery is possible, SUDs 
are chronic, relapsing-remitting disorders, with estimates of SUD relapse at 40–60%. Currently, 
we know little about the mechanisms underlying successful recovery processes and whether 
substance-specific mechanisms exist. The current study sought to examine delay discounting (a 
measure of future valuation), executive skills, abstinence duration, and health behaviors in a 
population of individuals in recovery from alcohol, stimulants, opioids, and other substances.

Methods:  In this observational study, we utilized a cohort of individuals (n=238) from the 
International Quit and Recovery Registry, an online registry for those in recovery from SUDs 
around the world. We assessed delay discounting through a neurobehavioral task, and assessed 
abstinence duration, executive skills, and engagement in positive health behaviors through self-
report measures.

Results:  We found that delay discounting, executive skills, and engagement in positive health 
behaviors were similar among individuals in recovery from different substances. Abstinence 
duration was associated with delay discounting and engagement in health behaviors. Additionally, 
executive skills and engagement in health behaviors were positively associated.

Conclusion:  These findings suggest that common behavioral mechanisms support recovery from 
misuse of various substances. As both delay discounting and executive skills are dependent upon 
executive brain centers, such as the prefrontal cortex, strategies that target executive functioning,

Introduction

Substance use disorders (SUDs) are brain disorders characterized by impairments caused 
by the recurrent use of alcohol, drugs, or both. This impairment may be manifested in 
areas such as physical/mental health, educational/work responsibilities, or relationships 
with friends, families, or other social counterparts. SUDs afflict approximately 7.4% of 
individuals living in the United States each year (Merikangas & McClair, 2012; Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2019). SUDs are treatable and can be 
managed through medical, psychological, and other behavioral treatments. However, SUDs 
are chronic, relapsing-remitting disorders, and therefore the return to substances is common, 
with estimates of SUD relapse at 40–60%, similar to relapse rates of other chronic illnesses 
(McLellan et al., 2000).

Historically, definitions of recovery focused on the concept of abstinence. However, newer 
definitions focus on a multitude of factors that promote successful recovery (Witkiewitz 
et al., 2020). Success in recovery could mean engaging in education, obtaining gainful 
employment, acquiring new hobbies; healing relationships with family, friends, or co-
workers; or making new friendships altogether (Neale et al., 2014). Importantly, research 
has identified that, “recovery goes well beyond abstinence; it is experienced as a bountiful 
‘new life’, an ongoing process of growth, self-change and of reclaiming the self” (Laudet, 
2007). That is, new definitions focus on the concept of recovery as an ongoing, dynamic 
process of behavioral change resulting in improvements in biopsychosocial functioning 
and quality of life (Witkiewitz et al., 2020). Engagement in health behaviors is one 
important aspect of recovery. These behaviors include eating well, participating in an 
exercise routine, engaging in preventative health care, and getting enough sleep. However, 
the neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting engagement in health behaviors in individuals 
in recovery from SUDs are unknown. Here, we use the term neurobehavior/al to describe 
behaviors that are known to be dependent on distinct regions of the brain (from studies that 
have utilized neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging); that 
is, tasks such as executive function that are known to rely on the prefrontal cortex.

The Competing Neurobehavioral Decision Systems (CNDS) theory proposes that the 
reward-driven impulsive system and the regulatory executive system work in balance to 
promote healthy decision-making and engagement in positive behaviors (Bickel et al., 2007, 
2018). The executive system is governed by frontal cortical brain regions (e.g., dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex), while the impulsive system is governed by 
limbic and paralimbic regions (e.g., amygdala, insula, striatum). CNDS balance can be 
assessed behaviorally via neurocognitive tasks of delay discounting and executive functions 
or skills. Delay discounting is a behavioral indicator of future valuation and assesses the

balance between the impulsive and executive systems. Delay discounting is a behavioral 
mechanism underlying a range of health behaviors, most notably SUDs (Bickel et al., 2012, 
2019; Bickel, Koffarnus, et al., 2014; García-Rodríguez et al., 2013; Perry et al., 2005; 
Phung et al., 2019). Additionally, previous research has suggested that individuals with 
SUDs display deficits in a range of executive functions, including inhibition, attention, and 
working memory as a consequence of substance use disorder (Fernández-Serrano et al., 
2010). Deficits in executive functioning may also be a risk factor for the onset of behaviors 
such as binge drinking and polysubstance use (Gustavson et al., 2017; Peeters et al., 2015). 
A shift in CNDS activity toward increased executive functions and future valuation may be 
critical to successful recovery.

The findings to date regarding executive and impulsive functions during recovery from 
SUDs have been mixed, with some studies suggesting that individuals in recovery from 
chronic substance use may experience persistent impairments in these domains (Ellis 
et al., 2016), while others suggest that these deficits improve with abstinence (Pope 
et al., 2002). Further, though polysubstance use is associated with impaired cognitive 
functioning compared to single substance use (e.g., alcohol use disorder) (Schmidt et 
al., 2017), less work has examined differences in the recovery processes of distinct 
SUDs. Various substances, including alcohol, stimulants, and opioids, have different 
biochemical, pharmacokinetic, toxicity, psychopharmacological, and behavioral profiles, 
therefore affecting users in distinctly different ways (e.g., differences in tolerance and 
withdrawal) (Shmulewitz et al., 2015). Additionally, patients with multiple SUDs, compared 
to single SUDs, demonstrate differences including a more persistent pattern and course of 
use (McCabe et al., 2017). Yet despite these differences, diagnostic and treatment guidelines 
are largely universal across substances. Distinguishing behavioral and other differences 
between SUDs is crucial to investigating the differential recovery processes of unique SUDs, 
and thereby providing substance-specific prevention and intervention to encourage sustained 
recovery (Shmulewitz et al., 2015).

Therefore, we sought to examine the neurobehavioral determinants of success in recovery by 
exploring the relationship among delay discounting, executive functions, health behaviors, 
and abstinence duration in a population of individuals in recovery from several different 
types of SUDs (including alcohol, stimulants, and opioids). Based on the concept 
that current diagnostic and treatment guidelines are consistent across substances, we 
hypothesized that delay discounting, executive functions, and health behaviors would be 
similar across substances but that these factors would be significantly associated with 
abstinence duration, suggesting that they support success in recovery across each category of 
SUD.

2.  Methods

The study recruited participants from the International Quit and Recovery Registry (IQRR; 
https://quitandrecovery.org), an online community and registry of adults (≥18 years old) 
who self-report being in recovery from substance misuse and/or behavioral addictions 
(e.g., gambling, excessive video game playing). To register as a member of the IQRR, 
individuals provide contact information and complete an initial assessment, which contains

questions about demographics and personal history of substance misuse and behavioral 
addictions. After registration, IQRR members gain access to the benefits of the registry and 
can complete any available research assessments. Participation in assessments is voluntary, 
and membership is not contingent upon the number of assessments that an individual 
completes. Participants are compensated for each assessment completed. Assessments were 
programmed and presented in LimeSurvey. In addition to providing research assessments to 
help members learn more about their trends and trajectories in recovery, the IQRR provides 
a community of support for members as well as resources aimed at promoting successful 
recovery.

The Institutional Review Board at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University 
approved the current investigation. All participants provided an online approved consent 
prior to beginning any study procedures.

2.1  Study measures

Demographics:  The study collected demographic data in the IQRR initial assessment, 
which included gender, race, ethnicity, year of birth, level of education, and household 
income. We calculated age by subtracting the year of birth from the year in which the 
assessment was completed. To determine the primary addiction of each participant, we used 
a standard IQRR multiple-choice question in the initial assessment, “What was your primary 
addiction?” with the options: a) tranquilizers/depressants; b) prescription pain relievers; 
c) nicotine; d) cannabis products; e) cocaine; f) stimulants; g) opioids; h) alcohol; i) 
overeating; j) gambling; k) viewing pornography; l) shopping; or m) other. Examples were 
provided for each addiction (e.g., “opioids (heroin, opium, morphine, methadone)”). The 
study categorized individuals with alcohol use disorder as those participants who responded 
“alcohol”; stimulant use disorder for those participants who responded “stimulants” or 
“cocaine”; opioid use disorder for those participants who responded “opioids”; all other 
substances were categorized as other SUD. We use the term “substance misuse” in reference 
to this population, as we did not obtain information required to diagnose a DSM-V SUD.

Abstinence duration:  The quit date of the participant’s primary substance was collected 
in the IQRR initial assessment. The current assessment asked participants whether they 
have engaged in their primary substance since they joined the IQRR. The study calculated 
abstinence duration for those who answered “No” by subtracting the self-reported quit 
date collected at the initial assessment from the date on which the current assessment 
was completed. Those who answered “Yes” and indicated engagement in their primary 
substance since they joined the IQRR were subsequently asked if their substance use was 
ongoing (Yes/No). Participants who indicated ongoing use were considered to have 0 days of 
abstinence. Those who indicated no ongoing substance use were asked to report an updated 
quit date and the study calculated the abstinence duration by subtracting the updated quit 
date from the date on which the assessment was completed. Abstinence duration in days is 
used in all analyses.

Delay Discounting:  The study used the five-trial adjusting delay discounting task 
(Koffarnus & Bickel, 2014) to assess future valuation. Participants are first asked if they

would rather receive $1000 in 3 weeks or $500 now. The delay of the larger reward in 
the subsequent trial increases or decreases based on the answer to the previous question. 
This process of adjusting delays repeats for a total of five trials. In delay discounting, the 
ED50, or the delay expected to reduce the value of the larger reward by 50%, is known as 
the indifference point (Mazur, 1987). The inverse of the ED50 was calculated to provide 
an estimate of the discount rate (k). The natural log of k was used in all analyses. Though 
test-retest reliability of this task has not been assessed, discount rates for the five-trial 
adjusting delay discounting task are similar and correlate to discount rates from the adjusting 
amount task, and each of the four effects related to delay discounting (i.e., amount effect; 
past versus future reinforcers; consumable versus generalized reinforcers; zero amounts 
explicitly described) have been shown to be replicated with this task (Koffarnus & Bickel, 
2014).

Executive functions:  The study assessed executive functions using the Executive Skills 
Questionnaire, a 36-item self-report questionnaire used to assess executive skills. The 
questionnaire assesses 12 executive skills including response inhibition, working memory, 
emotional control, sustained attention, task initiation, planning/prioritization, organization, 
time management, goal-directed persistence, flexibility, metacognition, and stress tolerance 
(Dawson & Guare, 2010, 2012, 2018; Strait et al., 2020). Each item is scored on a range 
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), with “1” indicating lower executive 
functioning and “7” indicating higher executive functioning. Items are summed for a 
total score ranging between 36 and 252, with higher scores indicating stronger executive 
functioning. All analyses used the total score. Though the original version of the Executive 
Skills Questionnaire that we utilized does not have psychometric properties available, 
a more recent revised version with 25 items found that the test has excellent internal 
consistency (alpha = .91), adequate test-retest reliability (.70), moderate correlations with 
other executive function (.56–.74) and psychological symptom scales (.38–.55), and is 
significantly correlated with academic engagement (− .40) (Strait et al., 2020).

Health behaviors: The study assessed health behaviors using the Health and Finance Related 
Behaviors Questionnaire, a 39 item self-report measure used to assess participants’ level 
of engagement in health-related and finance-related behaviors (Supplementary Document 
1). This questionnaire was designed in a laboratory. Items were created based on health 
behaviors as assessed in previous work (Daugherty & Brase, 2010; DeHart et al., 2020; 
Snider et al., 2018). The questionnaire assesses 6 domains of health- and finance-related 
behaviors: addictive behaviors, preventative, or health-related behaviors, driving behaviors, 
environmental behaviors, and financial behaviors. Each item was scored on a range from 
1 (never) to 5 (almost always), with items reflecting poor health behaviors reverse scored. 
Items are summed for a total score ranging from 39 to 195, with a higher score indicating a 
higher level of engagement in positive health- and finance-related decisions.

2.2  Data cleaning

A total of 271 IQRR members submitted the current assessment. Individuals indicating a 
primary addiction that was not substance related (n=11) were excluded from the analysis 
due to the unique set of complications that SUDs present compared to other behavioral

addictions, such as the effects of addictive substances on the functioning of both the 
brain and body (including effects on discounting rates) (Bickel, Johnson, et al., 2014). 
Non-substance-related primary addictions included binge eating or other eating disorders 
(n=1), gambling (n=2), excessive viewing of pornography (n=4), overeating (n=2), excessive 
video gaming (n=1), and other (i.e., self-injury) (n=1). Given the need for information about 
abstinence duration provided by the IQRR initial assessment as described above, individuals 
who had not completed the IQRR initial assessment (n=6) or who reported a quit date that 
was after the date they completed the questionnaire (n=2) were excluded from the analysis. 
Additionally, the study excluded participants who did not complete the delay discounting 
task (n=15) from the analysis, as delay discounting was a primary variable of interest. 
Based on these criteria, a total of 33 (~12%) participants were excluded from the analysis, 
including 1 participant who was excluded on the basis of more than one criterion. Thus, the 
final sample consisted of 238 participants (Figure 1).

2.3  Statistics

The study conducted chi-square tests of independence to compare categorical demographic 
variables (i.e., gender, race, ethnicity, education, income) among substance groups. We 
conducted one-way analysis of variance for between groups comparisons of age and 
abstinence duration. We utilized analysis of covariance to compare delay discounting, 
executive skills, and engagement in health behaviors among groups controlling for 
significant demographic variables. Relationships among abstinence duration, delay 
discounting, executive skills, and engagement in health behaviors were probed using 
Pearson’s product-moment correlations. The study determined statistical significance at 
an alpha level of 0.05. A Bonferroni correction was applied to the correlational statistics, 
resulting in an adjusted alpha value of 0.008. We considered a trend a value between 0.05 
and 0.008. The study team analyzed all data using IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0 and RStudio.

3.  Results

Demographics:

The analysis included a total of 238 participants. The study found a statistically significant 
difference among groups in age, race, ethnicity, education, and income categories (Table 1).

Examining between-group differences in delay discounting, executive skills, and health 
behaviors:

The study found no differences among substance groups in delay discounting (F(3, 
229)=0.161, p=0.922), executive skills (F(3, 229)=0.680, p=0.565), or engagement in health 
behaviors (F(3, 229)=0.549, p=0.649) after controlling for age, race, ethnicity, education, 
and income (Figure 2).

Examining correlations between outcomes of interest:

As the study observed no between groups differences in outcomes, we conducted 
correlational analyses on the full sample of 238 participants. Correlational analyses 
indicated that health behaviors were significantly positively correlated with executive skills 
(r=0.44, p<0.001) and abstinence duration (r=0.17, p=0.007) (Figure 3). Additionally,

the study found a significant negative correlation between abstinence duration and delay 
discounting (r=−0.14, p=0.031 [trend]).

4.  Discussion

4.1  Behavioral similarities are seen amongst individuals recovering from different types 
of substance misuse

In this cross-sectional examination, we found that individuals in recovery from misuse of 
alcohol, stimulants, opioids, and other substances have similar levels of executive skills 
and engagement in health behaviors as well as similar delay discounting rates. Although a 
number of studies have suggested that there are common behavioral and neural mechanisms 
of the various drugs (Volkow et al., 2019), the recovery process is less studied. Previous 
studies have reported differences in factors such as motivation, social and personal identity, 
self-control, and religious involvement among individuals in recovery from different types 
of substances (Koski-Jannes, 2002; Koski-jännes & Turner, 1999; McBride et al., 1994). 
The current study adds evidence to this literature that certain other factors (i.e., delay 
discounting, executive skills, health behaviors) are similar among individuals recovering 
from misuse of different substances.

This finding has important clinical implications in regard to treatment. Specifically, our 
findings suggest that treatment plans can be integrated across a range of SUDs, especially 
for treatments that target both delay discounting or executive functioning, neurobehaviors 
that are supported by the executive system (e.g., the prefrontal cortex). For factors that do 
vary by group (e.g., social preferences), clinics may consider having separate treatments for 
individuals with specific SUDs (e.g., alcohol use disorder versus opiate use disorder). The 
common behavioral indicators found in this study suggest that they may be good targets 
for complementary interventions supporting abstinence and a healthy recovery process. 
Episodic future thinking (EFT), an intervention that improves future valuation through 
imagination of vivid, positive future experiences, engages a network of brain regions 
involved in the executive circuitry including the hippocampus and frontal cortical regions 
(Weiler et al., 2010). EFT has successfully been implemented to decrease alcohol demand in 
individuals with alcohol dependence (Snider et al., 2016) and to decrease cigarette smoking 
(Chiou & Wu, 2017; Stein et al., 2016). EFT warrants further investigation to determine 
its utility to enhance domains of SUD recovery. Goal management training (Alfonso et al., 
2011; Anderson et al., 2021; Milliken, 2008), mindfulness (Alfonso et al., 2011; Garland 
& Howard, 2018; Priddy et al., 2018), and music-based cognitive rehabilitation (Lesiuk, 
2010) are other promising interventions to support successful treatment of SUDs through the 
enhancement of executive functions.

4.2  Executive skills are associated with positive health behaviors in individuals in 
substance use recovery

We found that executive skills were correlated with engagement in positive health behaviors, 
including addictive behaviors, preventative or health-related behaviors, driving behaviors, 
environmental behaviors, and financial behaviors. In line with our findings, previous 
research has found that executive functions drive engagement in positive health behaviors

such as physical activity (Daly et al., 2014) and avoidance of risky health behaviors such as 
smoking, drinking alcohol, or consuming high-fat foods (Allan et al., 2016). As executive 
skills are governed by the brain’s top-down executive circuitry, our findings suggest that 
increased activity of executive brain regions is associated with engagement in positive 
health behaviors in a population of individuals in recovery from substance misuse. The 
current study is one of the first to show this relationship in a clinical population with 
substance misuse. As such, our results suggest that psychotherapy, exercise, and other 
activities capable of regulating executive dysfunction may be beneficial for patients in 
recovery. The augmentation of an individual’s recovery plan with such therapies should 
be further investigated, utilizing methods to examine executive functioning and associated 
brain regions, as well as subsequent health behaviors, to corroborate our findings. Brief 
computerized self-report measures such as the ones used in this study and cognitive tasks 
could be implemented in person (e.g., in a clinic waiting room) or remotely to assess 
executive functioning and health behaviors repeatedly over time. Promising results would 
be impactful motivators for patients and help to develop a basis for therapies that alter the 
executive system and promote maintained recovery.

Executive functioning is critical as it enables top-down control of thoughts, emotions, and 
behavior (Baumeister et al., 2007; Hofmann et al., 2012). The prefrontal brain regions that 
support executive function, including the medial prefrontal cortex, enable our ability to plan 
and execute goal-directed behaviors (Euston et al., 2012). In this instance, an important 
goal-directed behavior is the choice to not use alcohol and/or drugs—the goal of sustaining 
abstinence. Engaging in positive health behaviors beyond abstinence is an important aim 
of the recovery process as substance use recovery is a multifaceted process (Inanlou et al., 
2020; Kaskutas et al., 2014; Laudet, 2007). Positive health behaviors such as maintaining 
diet and exercise habits, following a doctor’s treatment plans, safe driving practices, making 
sound financial decisions, and using protection during sex are instrumental in leading a 
healthy lifestyle during recovery. In fact, research indicates that engaging in a healthy 
lifestyle enhances quality of life and helps promote successful recovery in a range of 
relapsing-remitting diseases (Singer et al., 2001).

4.3  Abstinence duration is associated with increased future valuation and health 
behaviors

In line with our hypothesis, we found that abstinence duration was significantly correlated 
with increased future valuation (i.e., decreased delay discounting), a finding that aligns with 
previous studies of ours and others indicating that delay discounting is related to severity 
of drug use (Albein-Urios et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2007; Vuchinich & Simpson, 1998), 
remission status (Athamneh et al., 2020), and time in recovery (Athamneh et al., 2019; 
Tomlinson et al., 2020). That is, as time in recovery progresses and drug use becomes less of 
a focus in an individual’s life, the valuation of the future increases. Additionally, we found 
that as abstinence duration increases, individuals are more likely to engage in positive health 
behaviors. Though research has shown that health behaviors are impaired in SUDs (e.g., 
poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, decreased social relationships), surprisingly little 
empirical evidence has examined health behaviors during the recovery process. Clinical 
work, however, suggests that engagement in a range of health behaviors supports the

enhanced quality of life that is needed for sustained recovery (Laudet, 2011; Whitley & 
Drake, 2010). Interestingly Dennis et al. (2007) conducted a study of 1,1,62 individuals who 
entered substance use disorder treatment programs and were followed for up to 8 years. 
They investigated a range of aspects of recovery, including physical and mental health, 
coping responses, legal involvement, vocational involvement, housing, peers, and social and 
spiritual support. First, they found that 86% of the study population sustained abstinence at 
the 5+ year follow-up period. Second, they found that other aspects of recovery occurred at 
different rates and times. For example, following 1 year of abstinence, the number of days 
worked increased and financial problems decreased, with significant reductions in living 
below the poverty line occurring at 3 years of abstinence. Additionally, the duration of 
abstinence was significantly associated with reduced environmental risks, increased number 
of sober friends, level of social and spiritual support, and an increase in self-efficacy to resist 
relapse. Future work will need to investigate whether interventions such as EFT may help to 
expedite the rate of recovery in these other essential areas of life.

Contrary to our initial hypothesis, executive skills were not associated with abstinence 
duration. While some previous research has shown a link between abstinence duration and 
executive functioning (Farhadian et al., 2017; Zinn et al., 2004), others have suggested that 
this improvement in executive function over time is limited. Executive impairments may 
persist during long-term abstinence (Fein et al., 2004) and any improvements may not be 
of clinical significance (Bates et al., 2005). Of clinical relevance, however, individuals are 
able to achieve and maintain successful recovery despite some persistent impairments in 
executive functions (Fein et al., 2004).

4.4  Limitations and future directions

While this study brought new insight and perspective regarding the relationships between 
health behaviors, executive skills, and delay discounting, we should note several limitations. 
First, the study recruited participants from the IQRR, which is a registry of people who 
self-report some form of addictive behavior or substance misuse and voluntarily become 
a member of the recovery community and participate in research. Hence, the results 
of this study may be biased toward people in recovery who are prone to seek support 
and acknowledge the grave risks of SUDs. As many people join the IQRR in search of 
accountability or inspiration in addiction recovery, IQRR members may be more motivated 
and less likely to relapse than the general recovery population. Additionally, the study used 
a self-report questionnaire to assess executive skills, which relies on participants’ subjective 
assessment of their executive skills; however, performance on a revised version of this 
questionnaire was shown to be associated with other neurocognitive tasks of executive 
function as well as academic performance (Strait et al., 2020). Future studies may use 
performance-based cognitive tasks, such as the Stroop Task or Eriksen Flanker Task, 
to evaluate executive functions. Additionally, future studies should consider using other 
measures to assess quality of recovery such as days engaged in work, sport, or other 
leisure, nonsubstance related activities. Last, our study was cross-sectional, limiting our 
ability to investigate these relationships over time and the temporal relationships among 
variables. Importantly, the cross-sectional nature of the study precludes us from making any 
conclusions about causality or directionality. Future studies could also consider conducting

additional statistical analyses, such as path modeling, which can allow researchers to assess 
both mediation and moderation of a range of variables. That is, other factors might influence 
the strength of the relationships investigated in the current study including stress (e.g., 
stress related to health, occupation, or relationships) or comorbid diagnoses (e.g., depression 
or anxiety). Future longitudinal studies are warranted to examine causal relationships and 
outcomes over time.

5.  Conclusion

In this observational study of an international group of individuals in recovery from various 
SUDs (i.e., alcohol, stimulants, opioids, other), we found that delay discounting, executive 
skills, and engagement in health behaviors were similar in the process of recovery from 
different substances. We further found that abstinence duration was significantly associated 
with future valuation and health behaviors, which was additionally associated with executive 
skills. These findings suggest that common behavioral mechanisms, which may be driven by 
the executive system, support success in recovery. In light of these findings, we suggest that 
interventions to target the executive system including EFT, exercise, or meditation should be 
utilized to promote successful recovery. Future research should explore these interventions 
to target health behaviors and other prosocial behaviors that will support success in recovery.

HIGHLIGHTS

•

•

•

•

Little is known about the mechanisms underlying successful SUD recovery 
processes

Delay discounting and executive skills were examined in relation to SUD 
recovery

Neurobehaviors were similar among individuals in recovery from different 
substances

Longer periods of abstinence were associated with more significant changes

Executive skills were significantly related to positive health behavior 
engagement
