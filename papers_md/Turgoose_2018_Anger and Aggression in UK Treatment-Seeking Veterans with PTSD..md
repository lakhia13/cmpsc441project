Abstract: Prevalence rates of anger and aggression are often higher in military personnel. Therefore,
it is important to understand more about why this is, and the factors with which it is associated.
Despite this, there is little evidence relating to anger and aggression in UK veterans who are seeking
treatment for mental health difﬁculties such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study
investigated the prevalence rates of anger and aggression in this population, as well as the associations
between anger and aggression, and various sociodemographic, functioning and mental health
variables. A cross-sectional design was used, with participants completing a battery of self-report
questionnaires. Prevalence rates for signiﬁcant anger and aggression were 74% and 28% respectively.
Both women and those over 55 were less likely to report difﬁculties. Those with high levels of PTSD
and other mental health difﬁculties were more likely to report anger and aggression. Other factors
related to anger and aggression included unemployment due to ill health, and a perceived lack
of family support. Findings showed that veterans who are seeking support for mental health are
likely to be experiencing signiﬁcant difﬁculties with anger and aggression, especially if they have
comorbid mental health difﬁculties. The associations between anger, aggression, and other variables,
has implications for the assessment and treatment of military veterans.

1. Introduction

Research has suggested that military personnel are likely to experience difficulties with anger and
aggressive behaviours [1,2]. Prevalence rates in military populations have been estimated at 29% for all
types of physical assault, 12% for violent behaviour, and 10% for physical assault [1,3]. Anger in military
populations is strongly associated with a range of other variables, including mental health issues such
as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [4]. Specifically, anger and aggression in US veterans have been
associated with PTSD hyperarousal [5], PTSD re-experiencing [6], and depression [7]. The relationship
between anger and mental health is complex, and there is considerable overlap, with some research
showing that anger in military personnel is substantially accounted for by mental ill health [2].

Anger and aggression have also been related to an individual’s history, such as childhood
adversity, childhood antisocial behaviour [2], and issues relating to their military service, such as having
a combat role and experiencing multiple traumas whilst on deployment [1,2]. The extent of anger and
aggression problems in military personnel is concerning given the challenges that this population faces
in readjusting following deployment [8], with ex-service personnel often over-represented in prisons
for violent offences and more likely to report committing violent crimes after combat exposure [9,10].
There have been several large-scale studies of anger and aggression using general military samples,
often including those who have recently served in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, comparatively

little research has investigated the speciﬁc mental health needs of military veterans who are seeking
help for such difﬁculties. A recent study showed that 46% of UK veterans waited for more than ﬁve
years to seek help for their mental health difﬁculties, and that this was related to greater mental health
difﬁculties [11], strengthening the notion that there can be a long delay between deployment and
veterans seeking support for their mental health [12]. In this sample, the second most commonly
reported mental health issue was anger (76%), which has been strongly correlated with PTSD in US and
UK veterans [5–7,11]. Given the apparently high prevalence rate of anger in treatment-seeking veterans,
and the potential implications for veterans’ well-being, it is important to further our understanding of
these issues to help shape mental health services and improve treatments for veterans. By investigating
factors associated with anger and aggression, clinicians could be assisted in identifying risk factors in
veterans seeking support for mental health difﬁculties.

The aims of the present study were ﬁrstly to investigate prevalence rates of anger and aggression
in a sample of treatment-seeking UK veterans. Secondly, we explored the relationships between anger
and aggression, and a range of sociodemographic, functioning and mental health variables. Given the
past evidence showing rates and associations of anger and aggression in the wider military population,
it is pertinent to investigate such links in treatment-seeking veterans as our understanding of this
group is limited.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Procedure

A cross-sectional design was used, with questionnaire responses collected from a random sample
of treatment-seeking UK veterans recruited from Combat Stress (CS), a national charity providing
specialist mental health services to military veterans. Questionnaire data was collected pertaining to
anger and aggression, as well as a number of mental health and sociodemographic variables.

The questionnaire contained instructions informing participants that participation was voluntary,
that the research was being conducted independently from clinical services at CS, and that participant
input would not affect their treatment in any way. Questionnaires were sent to participants in the
post using a three-wave mail out strategy between April and August 2016. Individuals from whom a
response was not received were followed up by telephone. A research assistant made three attempts
to contact these individuals by telephone.

2.2. Participants

Data for the present study was taken from a wider investigation of the needs of treatment-seeking
veterans [11]. A sample of participants was randomly taken from a population of veterans who had
sought support from CS over a 12-month period, between 31st January 2015 and 1st February 2016. The
sample was drawn from the total number of veterans who had attended an initial assessment and at
least one further appointment during this period (N = 3335). From this group, a random 20% sample was
taken (N = 667), 67 of whom were removed prior to data collection either due to participant death or not
having sufficient contact information. The final sample size was 600. Of these, 403 (67%) were recruited
into the study by returning completed questionnaires. As demonstrated in a previous paper, there were
no significant differences between those who took part in the study and those who did not [11].

2.3. Outcomes

2.3.1. Anger and Aggression

Data on anger was collected using the Dimensions of Anger Reactions measure (DAR-5) [13].
This ﬁve-item measure gives an overall score to assess anger, with items including: ‘I often ﬁnd myself
getting angry at people or situations’, and ‘When I get angry, I get really mad’. Items are scored on a

Healthcare 2018, 6, 86

3 of 11

Likert scale ranging from 0–4 and a total score is calculated by adding these together, with scores of 12
and above indicating signiﬁcant difﬁculties with anger.

In order to assess aggressive behaviours, we used a measure developed by the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research [14], based on the Interpersonal Conﬂict Scale [15] and the State/Trait Anger
Scale [16]. This measure has been used previously in military samples [2,14]. For the purposes of
this study, we termed this four-item measure the Walter Reed Four (WR-4). The WR-4 included the
following items: ‘How often did you get angry at someone and yell or shout’, ‘How often did you get
angry with someone and kick or smash something, slam the door, punch the wall etc.’, ‘How often
did you get into a ﬁght with someone not in your family and hit the person’ and ‘How often did you
threaten someone with physical violence’. Respondents were asked to rate each question with ﬁve
options (never, once, twice, three or four times or ﬁve or more). These were scored between 0–4 and a
total score calculated by adding these together. Caseness was deﬁned if participant total scores were in
the highest tertile.

2.3.2. Socio-Demographic Outcomes

Participants completed questionnaires relating to sociodemographic variables, including age, sex,
relationship status and employment status. Participants were also asked to state how many years
had passed between leaving the Armed Forces and seeking help. This was divided into <5 years and
>5 years, and the date they left service, which was used to determine if they were an early service
leaver, deﬁned as leaving with under four years of continuous service.

Data was collected on childhood adversity, whereby participants rated 16 true or false statements
relating to events from childhood, e.g., ‘I regularly used to see or hear physical ﬁghting or verbal
abuse between my parents’. These items were taken from a previous epidemiological study of health
and well-being in the UK military [17]. Participants responded on a binary yes/no scale to each item.
Total scores were added and those in the top tertile deemed as having high levels of childhood adversity.

2.3.3. Functioning

A number of factors relating to general functioning were measured, including relationship and
employment status. Data was also collected about social support, with participants asked to complete
items on whether they felt supported by friends and family members.

The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) [18] was used as a basic measure of functional
impairment, i.e., the extent to which health difﬁculties interfere with the ability to carry out day-to-day
tasks such as work and relationships. Totalled scores on this measure are categorised as mild (1–10),
moderate (11–20) or severe (21+).

2.3.4. Health

A number of mental health outcomes were assessed. PTSD was measured using the PTSD
Checklist [19] (PCL-5); a validated, 20-item measure assessing all domains of PTSD. Items are scored
on a Likert scale from 0–4, with total scores of 34+ indicating caseness for PTSD. Common mental
health difﬁculties (CMD) of anxiety and depression were assessed using the 12-item General Health
Questionnaire-12 [20] (GHQ-12). Scores on the GHQ-12 range from 0–12, with caseness deﬁned as a
score of 6+.

Data on alcohol use was collected using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test [21] (AUDIT).
This ten-item measure gives an overall score to assess alcohol-related risk. Harmful drinking levels
were deﬁned by scores of 16+.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was measured using the Brain Injury Screening Index [22]. Participants
were deemed to meet criteria for TBI if they reported experiencing a serious blow to the head plus one
of a series of symptoms as a result, such as alteration of mental state (e.g., dazed), gaps in memory of
over one hour, or loss of consciousness.

2.4. Analysis

4 of 11

The ﬁrst stage of the analysis was to calculate prevalence rates for the DAR-5 and WR-4. Following
this, logistical regression models were ﬁtted to explore associations between the DAR-5 and WR-4,
and sociodemographic factors. These were adjusted for variables found to be signiﬁcant (age, sex
and childhood adversity) in order to control for any mediating or moderating effects. This analysis
was repeated to explore associations between the DAR-5 and WR-4, and outcomes of functioning and
health. All analyses were conducted using STATA 13.0 (College Station, TX, USA).

3. Results

3.1. Demographics

Of the sample of 600 veterans who were sent the questionnaire, 403 (67.2%) responded.
The majority were male (95.8% vs. 4.2% female). Most participants were over 45 years old (68.2%),
and just over two-thirds of participants were unemployed (68.1%). More were currently in a
relationship (60.8%) than not (39.2%). Regarding their time spent in the Armed Forces, 12.6% were
classiﬁed as early service leavers, and 45.7% had a period of ﬁve years or more since leaving the
military and seeking help from CS. Based on established cut-off scores, 74% of participants reported
signiﬁcant difﬁculties with anger on the DAR-5. For aggressive behaviours, 28% of participants
reported signiﬁcant difﬁculties as indicated by scores on the WR-4.

3.2. Relationships between Anger, Aggression and Other Variables

3.2.1. Sociodemographic Variables

Table 1 contains sociodemographic variables and their associations with anger and aggression.
Although only a small minority of participants were female, results suggest that women were less likely
to report issues with anger (DAR-5: Odds Ratio 0.34, 95% Conﬁdence Interval 0.12–0.92). Similarly,
participants who were over the age of 55 were less likely to report aggressive behaviours (WR-4:
OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16–0.72). Participants who reported a high number of childhood adversity events
were more likely to report difﬁculties with both anger and aggression (DAR-5: OR 3.43, 95% CI
1.68–7.00; WR-4: OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.34–3.69), although this association may be explained by other
variables, such as PTSD (see Table 1).

3.2.2. Functioning

Table 2 presents functioning variables and their associations with anger and aggression. Social
support was a signiﬁcant factor, with those reporting that they did not feel supported by their family
more likely to report problems with aggressive behaviours (WR-4: OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.59–6.01). This was
not replicated in those not feeling supported by friends. Employment status was also a signiﬁcant
factor, with unemployment due to ill health associated with higher rates of both anger and aggression
(DAR-5: OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.58–4.96; WR-4: OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.51–4.55). Unemployment not due to ill
health was not a signiﬁcant factor. Also, those participants who reported severe levels of functional
impairment were more likely to be experiencing high levels of both anger and aggression (DAR-5:
OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.77–4.74; WR-4: OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–2.79), although this association may be
explained by other variables, such as PTSD (see Table 2).

3.2.3. Health

Table 3 presents associations between anger, aggression and different health variables. The most
strongly associated variable was PTSD, with those meeting case criteria for PTSD being more likely to
report difﬁculties with both anger and aggressive behaviours (DAR-5: OR 10.70, 95% CI 5.79–19.60;
WR-4: OR 8.71, 95% CI 2.99–25.40). The same associations were true of common mental health
difﬁculties such as depression and anxiety (DAR-5: OR 4.14, 95% CI 2.47–6.94; WR-4: OR 6.00,

Healthcare 2018, 6, 86

CI 2.97–12.10), and difﬁculties with alcohol misuse (DAR-5: OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.08–4.01; WR-4: OR 2.05,
95% CI 1.21–3.47).

longer associated with anger or aggression following these adjustments.

4. Discussion

7 of 11

This study observed that nearly three quarters of treatment-seeking veterans in this sample
reported signiﬁcant difﬁculties with anger, and more than a quarter reported problems with aggressive
behaviour. Furthermore, anger and aggression were strongly associated with PTSD, and also associated
with common mental health difﬁculties, and alcohol misuse. Links between anger and PTSD and
other mental health disorders have been found previously [4], but this is the ﬁrst study to show this
relationship in veterans who are seeking help for their mental health.

One possible explanation may be that some PTSD, depression or anxiety symptoms overlap
with anger and aggression. For example, irritability is a common feature of PTSD, which, given
the association between anger and PTSD, raises the question of whether anger in treatment-seeking
veterans is a separate construct, or can be explained by its relation to other mental health difﬁculties.
Indeed, past research has suggested that the strong association between anger and mental health
difﬁculties is due to the overlap of these conditions within the individual [2].

Previous research has found that after deployment, military personnel who experienced more
traumatic events had higher levels of anger [1], which might partly explain the high prevalence rates of
anger and aggression in the current sample, if we are to assume that they had experienced traumas that
were related to the fact that they were seeking support. The prevalence of anger and aggression might
also be explained in part by the military culture in which veterans might have been required to use acts
of aggression in their work. Furthermore, most of the participants in this sample were men, and past
research has illustrated the existence of a ‘macho’ culture within the armed forces [23], in which the
expression of anger and aggression might be a more readily accepted method of displaying emotion.
An association was observed between problems with anger and aggression and higher rates of
childhood adversity. Previous large-scale research has shown strong relationships between adverse
childhood experiences (ACEs) and an array of difﬁculties in later life, including for mental health
and violent behaviours [24,25]. It has also been suggested that recruits into the military are often
from disadvantaged backgrounds [10]. In this study, the links between childhood adversity, anger
and aggression were explained by other factors such as severity of PTSD. This perhaps indicates
that those with high levels of childhood adversity were more likely to develop PTSD, which in turn
was the risk factor for anger and aggression. Indeed, there are some commonalities between anger
and PTSD symptoms, such as irritability and hypervigilance which could make some more prone to
acting aggressively.

The ﬁnding that those who were unemployed due to ill health were more likely to report anger
and aggression was notable, particularly because those who were unemployed not due to ill health
did not report such difﬁculties. This could in part be explained if the illnesses in question were related
to mental health, given the association here between anger, aggression and mental health. Similarly,
those who had the most severe interference with day-to-day functioning might be those who have the
biggest mental health difﬁculties which might explain the association between WSAS scores and anger
and aggression.

Participants were more likely to report problems with aggressive behaviour if they did not
feel supported by their family. Past research has suggested that social support can help to reduce
anger in people with PTSD [26], although the results in the present study relate to aggression,
not anger. The fact that perceived support of family but not friends was signiﬁcant here, could
suggest that there is something important about families in the role of aggression in the context of
treatment-seeking veterans. Similar ﬁndings have been reported elsewhere in a sample of POWs [27],
and in an adolescent sample, where anger expression was more likely in those who did not perceive
support from family, which was not replicated for support from friends [28]. There is evidence for the
notion that social support and family support are important in overcoming PTSD and other mental
health difﬁculties [29–32], plus there is evidence that social support improves treatment efﬁcacy for
PTSD [33]. This ﬁnding suggests that those who are not in a relationship or do not feel supported by
family are more likely to act on their anger. It may be that close family support is a protective factor

stopping some from acting out on their anger, or that those who do not perceive support have been
alienated from partners or family members due to their aggressive behaviours.

Results here suggested that women were less likely to report difﬁculties with anger, although only
a small minority of this sample were female. Common narratives exist around the increased likelihood
of men to feel anger and act out aggressively, which is supported by some research [34,35], although
evidence in some instances is mixed [36].

4.1. Limitations

Due to the cross-sectional design of this study, it is not possible to determine causality relating
to the associations found. For example, is it the case that veterans display aggression because they
do not have support from family, or is it the case that their aggression has caused strain in family
relationships? With other variables, such as childhood adversity, we know little from the present
study about the mechanisms by which this might relate to anger and aggression. Although, theories
from elsewhere in the wider literature might offer suitable explanations, such as the role of childhood
adversity on the development of emotional regulation [37]. This study found that some variables were
associated with anger but not aggression, or vice versa. It was beyond the scope of the present study
to investigate why this occurred, and future research might adopt different designs such as qualitative
methods in order to explore this. Furthermore, some evidence suggests an important neurobiological
role in PTSD which could help explain the role of some of these variables [38].

The current sample was taken from a population of veterans who were actively seeking treatment
from a national veterans mental health charity. CS receives approximately 2500 new referrals per
year [12], so the current sample represents a signiﬁcant number of treatment-seekers but may not be
generalisable to all. While the response rate was high, the present study did not conduct a power
calculation to determine a sample size required to ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in the given analyses.
The relatively large conﬁdence intervals in some of the statistics may point to a lack of power in
some instances.

4.2. Implications

Findings from the present study suggest that anger and aggression are a signiﬁcant part of the
difﬁculties faced by the treatment-seeking veteran population. Also, both anger and aggression are
strongly related to other comorbid mental health difﬁculties, such as PTSD. This could be important
in identifying mental health difﬁculties in veterans, if for example a veteran presents with anger,
this could be used as a starting point to discuss other difﬁculties they may be experiencing. Research
has shown that there can be a long gap between a veteran completing military service and seeking
help for mental health [39], so increasing our knowledge of the main signs and symptoms could help
increase the number who are identiﬁed and then able to access appropriate support. These ﬁndings
suggest that anger and aggression should be routinely screened for in mental health assessments of
veterans and appropriate treatments offered. Also, it may be pertinent in mental health settings to
assess for risk of aggressive behaviours.

5. Conclusions

This study showed that veterans who are seeking support with their mental health are likely to
be having signiﬁcant difﬁculties with anger and aggression, especially if they have other comorbid
mental health difﬁculties. Being unemployed due to ill health, and a lack of perceived family support
were also related to higher levels of anger and/or aggression. Being female and over 55 years old were
associated with reduced anger and aggression respectively.

Given the high prevalence rates of anger and aggression in treatment-seeking veterans, there is a
need to ensure that appropriate forms of assessment and support are available, and the presence of
anger or aggression could provide a useful bridge for discussing wider mental health difﬁculties, given

their strong association. While the present study is limited by its cross-sectional design, it provides
useful insights into the needs of this population.
