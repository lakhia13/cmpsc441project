Abstract

Drug addiction represents a dramatic dysregulation of motivational circuits that is caused by a 
combination of exaggerated incentive salience and habit formation, reward deficits and stress 
surfeits, and compromised executive function in three stages. The rewarding effects of drugs of 
abuse, development of incentive salience, and development of drug-seeking habits in the binge/
intoxication stage involve changes in dopamine and opioid peptides in the basal ganglia. The 
increases in negative emotional states and dysphoric and stress-like responses in the withdrawal/
negative affect stage involve decreases in the function of the dopamine component of the reward 
system and recruitment of brain stress neurotransmitters, such as corticotropin-releasing factor and 
dynorphin, in the neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala. The craving and deficits in executive 
function in the so-called preoccupation/anticipation stage involve the dysregulation of key afferent 
projections from the prefrontal cortex and insula, including glutamate, to the basal ganglia and 
extended amygdala. Molecular genetic studies have identified transduction and transcription 
factors that act in neurocircuitry associated with the development and maintenance of addiction 
that might mediate initial vulnerability, maintenance, and relapse associated with addiction.

Conceptual framework, definitions, and animal models

Drug addiction can be defined as a chronically relapsing disorder, characterised by 
compulsion to seek and take the drug, loss of control in limiting intake, and emergence of a 
negative emotional state (eg, dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) when access to the drug is 
prevented. From a diagnostic perspective, the term addiction is now encompassed by the 
term substance use disorders. In 2013, DSM-51 combined what was previously 
conceptualised as two separate and hierarchical disorders (substance abuse and substance 
dependence) into one construct, defining substance use disorders on a range from mild to 
moderate to severe, with the severity of an addiction depending on how many of the 
established criteria apply.

Although much of the early research with animal models focused on the acute rewarding 
effects of drugs of abuse, focus is shifting to the study of chronic drug administration-

induced brain changes that decrease the threshold for relapse, which corresponds more 
closely to human imaging studies of individuals who have substance use disorders. One of 
the main goals of neurobiological research is to understand changes at the molecular, 
cellular, and neurocircuitry levels that mediate the transition from occasional, controlled 
substance use to loss of control in drug intake and chronic addiction.2 Because only some 
substance users make this transition, neurobiological factors that influence the diverse 
individual differences in drug responses have also attracted increasing interest. Cogent 
arguments have been made that addictions are similar to other chronic relapsing disorders—
with individual differences in responses to the same exogenous challenges and limited effi 
cacy of treatment—such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension.3

The purpose of this Review is twofold. First, we aim to elaborate a heuristic framework 
based on the neuropsychopharmacological and brain imaging phenotype of addiction in the 
context of three functional domains (incentive salience, negative emotional states, and 
executive function) mediated by three major neuro-biological circuits (basal ganglia, 
extended amygdala, and prefrontal cortex). Second, we aim to identify neurochemically 
defined mini circuits that can independently or interactively mediate functional 
neuroplasticity within the three major circuits to produce incentive salience and compulsive-
like habits, negative emotional states of low reward and excessive stress, and compromised 
executive function. Building on previous identification of the three overall domains, this 
Review provides a framework for integration of the ever-expanding neuroplastic complexity 
of motivational systems that are involved in addiction and for identification of new targets 
for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of addiction.

Addiction can be conceptualised as a three-stage, recurring cycle—binge/intoxication, 
withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (craving)—that worsens over 
time and involves neuroplastic changes in the brain reward, stress, and executive function 
systems.4–6 Derived from a confluence of information from social psychology of human 
self-regulation failure, psychiatry, and brain imaging, these three stages provide a heuristic 
framework for the study of the neurobiology of addiction.4,5 A definition of impulsivity is “a 
predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal and external stimuli without 
regard for the negative consequences of these reactions to themselves or others”.7 A 
definition of compulsivity is the manifestation of “perseverative, repetitive actions that are 
excessive and inappropriate”.8 Impulsive behaviours are often accompanied by feelings of 
pleasure or gratification, but compulsions in disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder 
are often performed to reduce tension or anxiety from obsessive thoughts.8 In this context, 
individuals move from impulsivity to compulsivity, and the drive for drug-taking behaviour 
is paralleled by shifts from positive to negative reinforcement (figure 1). However, 
impulsivity and compulsivity can coexist, and frequently do so in the different stages of the 
addiction cycle.8

Understanding of the neurobiology of addiction has progressed through the study of animal 
models10 and, more recently, through brain imaging studies in individuals with addiction. 
Although no animal model of addiction fully emulates the human condition, they permit 
investigations of specific signs or symptoms that are associated with the psychopathological 
condition. If the model adequately mimics the phenomenology observed in humans as they

transition from experimentation to addiction, then it is more likely to have construct or 
predictive validity.11 The phenomena under study can be models of different systems 
(genetic, epigenetic, transcription, cellular, and network), psychological constructs (positive 
and negative reinforcement), symptoms outlined by psychiatric nosology (craving, 
hypohedonia, and dysphoria), and stages of the addiction cycle.4 Recently developed animal 
models take advantage of individual and strain diversity in responses to drugs, incorporate 
complex environments with access to and choices of alternative reinforcers, and test effects 
of stressful stimuli, allowing the investigation of neuro biological processes that underlie the 
risk for addiction and environmental factors that provide resilience against vulnerability. 
Animal models have also started to explore the influence of developmental stage and sex in 
drug response to better understand the greater vulnerability to substance use disorders when 
drug use is initiated in adolescence, and the distinct drug use trajectories that are observed in 
men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms involved in the stages of the addiction 
cycle can be conceptualised as domains, with a focus on specific brain circuits, the 
molecular and neurochemical changes in those circuits during the transition from drug 
taking to addiction, and the way in which those changes persist in the vulnerability to 
relapse.12 Equally convincing, animal models of the specific stages of the addiction cycle 
can be paralleled by human laboratory models13 and studied with neuroimaging.14

Neurobiological mechanisms of the binge/intoxication stage

Drug reward

Drugs of abuse activate brain reward systems, and research on drug addiction has in large 
part defined the neurocircuitry of reward. This line of investigation is fundamental because 
changes to how the drug-induced reward system is activated are key to the understanding of 
the development of addiction.4 Reward is defined herein as any event that increases the 
probability of a response with a positive hedonic component. A principal focus of research 
on the neurobiology of the rewarding effects of abused drugs has been the origins and 
terminal areas of the ascending mesocorticostriatal dopamine systems that have a key role in 
the rewarding properties of nearly all drugs of abuse (table 1).34 In humans, positron 
emission tomography studies have shown that intoxicating doses of alcohol and drugs 
release dopamine and opioid peptides into the ventral striatum,16,35 and that fast and steep 
release of dopamine is associated with the subjective sensation of the so-called high.36 This 
is because fast and steep increases in dopamine activate low-affi nity dopamine D1 receptors, 
which are necessary for the rewarding effects of drugs37 and for triggering conditioned 
responses.38 By contrast, dopamine stimulation of high-affi nity dopamine D2 receptors is 
not suffi cient for drug reward,39,40 and these receptors might even limit drug reward.41 In 
this respect, drugs emulate the increases in dopamine triggered by phasic dopamine firing, 
which are the firing frequencies of dopamine neurons associated with rewarding stimuli.42

The specific circuitry that is associated with drug reward has been broadened to include 
many neural inputs and outputs that interact with the basal forebrain. As the understanding 
of the relevant circuits has evolved, so too has the understanding of the relevant 
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, which include not only dopamine and opioid 
peptides but also γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, serotonin, acetylcholine, and

endocannabinoid systems that act at the level of either the ventral tegmental area or nucleus 
accumbens (figure 1; tables 1, 2 for neurotransmitter systems and specific neurocircuits 
involved). Balanced circuits result in proper inhibitory control and decision making and 
normal functioning of reward, motivation, stress, and memory circuits. These circuits also 
interact with circuits that are involved in mood regulation, including stress reactivity (which 
involves the amygdala, hypothalamus, and habenula) and interoception (which involves the 
insula and anterior cingulate cortex and contributes to the awareness of negative emotional 
states). Drugs of abuse usurp executive function circuits, motivational circuits, and stress 
circuits via multiple neurotransmitter-specific neuroplasticity circuits (tables 1, 2). Key 
neurotransmitters that are implicated in these neuroadaptations include dopamine, 
enkephalins, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine, corticotropin-releasing factor 
(CRF), dynorphin, neuropeptide Y, and endocannabinoids (tables 1, 2).

Incentive salience

Drugs of abuse have a profound effect on the response to previously neutral stimuli to which 
the drugs become paired. This phenomenon, called conditioned reinforcement, can be 
defined as when a previously neutral stimulus reinforces or strengthens behaviours through 
its association with a primary reinforcer and becomes a reinforcer in its own right. Such cues 
can be contextual and predictive, and the process of conditioned reinforcement entails not 
only approach to salient cues but also instrumental responding to turn on the cues, in view of 
their own rewarding (conditioned reinforcing) properties. As such, conditioned 
reinforcement as a construct preceded and laid the foundation for incentive salience.55 
Incentive salience can be defined as motivation for rewards derived from both one’s 
physiological state and previously learned associations about a reward cue that is mediated 
by the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.56 Both conditioned reinforcement and incentive 
salience provide constructs for what underlies cue-induced drug seeking, self-administration 
behaviours, and, conceivably, the transition to habit-like compulsive drug seeking.

The neurobiology that underpins these processes has received much research interest. One 
particularly influential series of studies in non-human primates indicated that midbrain 
dopamine cells initially fired in response to a novel reward. After repeated exposure, the 
neurons stopped firing during predictable reward delivery and instead fired when they were 
exposed to stimuli that were predictive of the reward.57 A new reward—and subsequently 
the cues associated with the reward—triggered phasic dopamine cell firing and activation of 
dopamine D1 receptors, which are necessary for conditioning to occur (table 2, circuits 1–4).
58 This process allows previously neutral stimuli to become endowed with incentive salience 
and strengthens the learned association with repeated exposure to the cues, which creates 
strong motivation to seek a reward.

Phasic dopamine signalling induced by drug administration can also trigger 
neuroadaptations in basal ganglia circuits. Here, drug-induced phasic dopamine release 
triggers the ability of drug-paired cues to increase dopamine levels. Activation of the ventral 
striatum leads to the recruitment of striatal-globus pallidalthalamocortical loops that engage 
the dorsal striatum, resulting in habit formation45 and triggering what is hypothesised to 
underlie compulsive responding for drugs (table 2, circuits 3 and 4).59 Key synaptic changes

involve glutamate-modulated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in glutamatergic projections 
from the prefrontal cortex and amygdala to the ventral tegmental area and nucleus 
accumbens (table 2, circuit 4).32,43,46

The ability of conditioned cues to recruit these circuits augments progression through the 
addiction cycle and helps explain intense desire for the drug (ie, craving) and compulsive 
use when individuals with addiction are exposed to drug cues or stressful environments that 
are linked with negative emotional states. Conditioned cues within the incentive salience 
process appear to drive dopamine signalling to maintain motivation to take the drug, even 
when its pharmacological effects lessen.57,60,61 By contrast, parallel impairments in 
executive function that are mediated by the prefrontal cortex might be linked to changes in 
tonic dopamine cell firing that result in lower but more stable dopamine levels in the 
dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex.62,63 This mechanism implicates lower-affi 
nity D1 receptors, which stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling, as 
being involved in both acute drug reward and conditioning, because both induce spikes in 
dopamine release. By contrast, D2 receptors, which inhibit cAMP signalling, are stimulated 
by both phasic and tonic dopamine and are not deemed necessary for drug reward.40,64 D3 
receptors, which are high-affinity dopamine receptors and co-localise in the nucleus 
accumbens with D1 receptors, are also associated with drug-seeking behaviour.65

Neurobiological mechanisms of the withdrawal/negative affect stage

The withdrawal/negative affect stage consists of key motivational elements, such as chronic 
irritability, emotional pain, malaise, dysphoria, alexithymia, states of stress, and loss of 
motivation for natural rewards. Across all major drugs of abuse, this stage is characterised in 
laboratory animals by elevations in reward thresholds (ie, decreased reward) during 
withdrawal. In animal models of the transition to addiction, elevations in brain reward 
thresholds occur that temporally precede and are highly correlated with escalation in drug 
intake.20 During acute and protracted withdrawal from chronic administration of all drugs of 
abuse, increases in stress and anxiety-like responses also occur that contribute greatly to the 
malaise of abstinence and protracted abstinence (table 1).66 Human brain imaging studies 
have reported decreases in the sensitivity of brain reward circuits to stimulation by natural 
rewards during the withdrawal/negative affect stage.67

Chronic drug exposure-induced neurochemical changes in systems that are implicated in 
acute drug reward are called within-system neuroadaptations. Within-system 
neuroadaptations can be defined as those in which “the primary cellular response element to 
the drug…adapt[s] to neutralize the drug’s effects; persistence of the opposing effects after 
the drug disappears… produce[s] the withdrawal response.”68 Such changes include 
decreases in dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens during 
drug withdrawal as measured by in-vivo microdialysis in rats69 and brain imaging studies in 
humans, in which amphetamine-induced or methylphenidate-induced striatal dopamine 
responses are 50% lower in detoxified abusers and 80% lower in active abusers, and 
accompanied by lower self-reports of the drug’s rewarding effects relative to non-drug-
abusing controls.25,35,61,70 Other observed changes include increases in μ opioid receptor

responsivity during opioid withdrawal,71,72 and decreases in GABAergic and increases in 
NMDA glutamatergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens.73,74 Differential regional 
changes in nicotinic receptor function in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area 
in nicotine, alcohol, and other addictions have also been reported, implicating α4β2 
nicotinic receptor subtypes.19,44 Such decreases in reward system function might persist in 
the form of long-term biochemical changes that contribute to the clinical syndrome of acute 
withdrawal and protracted abstinence and could also explain the loss of interest in normal, 
non-drug rewards (ie, narrowing of the behavioural repertoire toward drugs and drug-related 
stimuli; tables 1, 2, circuit 5).

The emotional dysregulation that is associated with the withdrawal/negative affect stage also 
involves a between-system neuroadaptation, in which neuro-chemical systems other than 
those involved in the positive rewarding effects of drugs of abuse are recruited or 
dysregulated by chronic activation of the reward system.68 Both the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis and brain stress system mediated by CRF are dysregulated by the chronic 
administration of all major drugs with dependence or abuse potential, with a common 
response of elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone, and amygdala CRF 
during acute withdrawal.20,75 As tolerance and withdrawal develop, brain stress systems, 
such as CRF, norepinephrine, and dynorphin, are recruited in the extended amygdala and 
contribute to the development of negative emotional states in withdrawal and protracted 
abstinence (tables 1, 2, circuits 6–8).20,22 As a result, the concept of anti-reward was 
developed,2 based on the proposal that opponent processes that are a general feature of 
biological systems also act to limit reward.4 Multiple circuits are likely to contribute to the 
hypothesised opponent-like processes. During acute withdrawal from all drugs of abuse, 
CRF increases in the extended amygdala (tables 1, 2, circuit 6). Importantly, CRF receptor 
antagonists block both the anxiety-like, stress-like effects of drug withdrawal and excessive 
drug taking during compulsive drug seeking in animals. Equally compelling, κ opioid 
receptor antagonists, when injected into the nucleus accumbens shell, can block the 
development of compulsive drug seeking (tables 1, 2, circuit 8).76–78 Decreases in the 
release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens can also be driven by increases in the activity 
of the dynorphin-κ opioid receptor system in the ventral striatum and possibly increases in 
the activity of CRF in the ventral tegmental area, which contributes to the negative 
emotional state associated with withdrawal and protracted abstinence.20,21

The lateral habenula plays a key role in mediating and encoding aversive states.79 Numerous 
studies indicate that the habenula is one of the regions that control the decreases in 
dopamine neuron firing in the ventral tegmental area that are associated with failure to 
receive an expected reward.80,81 This hypothesis is also consistent with the finding that α5 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the habenula appear to modulate aversive responses to 
large doses of nicotine48 and, along with habenular α2 receptors, nicotine withdrawal (tables 
1, 2, circuit 9).82

Anti-reward circuits are engaged as neuroadaptations during the development of addiction, 
producing aversive or stress-like states. These aversive states are manifest when the drug is 
removed during acute withdrawal but also during protracted abstinence.2 Thus, the within-
system and between-system construct could be equally valid for the preoccupation/

anticipation stage. The combination of decreases in reward function and increases in stress 
function in the motivational circuits of the ventral striatum, extended amygdala, and 
habenula is a powerful trigger of negative reinforcement that contributes to compulsive drug-
seeking behaviour and addiction. Decreases in reward can be driven by overactivation of the 
habenula or overactivation of the dynorphin system in the ventral striatum, both of which 
can decrease dopamine neuron firing. Increases in stress-like states and increased 
responsivity to stressors could be driven by the recruitment of CRF in the amygdala and 
other extrahypothalamic stress systems.

Compulsive-like habits might also derive from the so-called dark side of the withdrawal/
negative affect stage. In a study of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, patients 
showed enhanced avoidance habits compared with controls following overtraining on a 
shock avoidance task, providing support for a habit account of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder.83 Whether a deficient inhibitory process in prefrontal regions or overactive goal-
directed actions and habit processes in the basal ganglia mediate this effect remains to be 
determined, but the enhancement of avoidance habits provides another basis for the 
contribution of activation of the stress axis to compulsive-like responding.

Endogenous anti-stress systems also appear to buffer the brain stress systems and influence 
vulnerability to the development and perpetuation of addiction. Key neurotransmitters that 
act in opposition to brain stress systems include neuropeptide Y, nociceptin, and 
endocannabinoids (tables 1, 2, circuits 10 and 11).20,28,29,49,84 In particular, with chronic 
drug exposure, neuro-adaptations in the endocannabinoid system, which modulates the 
response of the brain to stress,85 might contribute to the enhanced stress reactivity in 
addiction. Indeed, human brain imaging studies have reported reductions of cannabinoid 
CB1 receptors in cannabis abusers and alcoholics.86,87 Thus, the development of enduring 
aversive emotional states,88 mediated by overactivation of the stress and anti-reward systems 
or underactivation of the anti-stress systems, might contribute to the crucial problem in drug 
addiction of chronic relapse, in which individuals with addiction return to compulsive drug 
taking long after acute withdrawal.2

Neurobiological mechanisms of the preoccupation/anticipation stage

The preoccupation/anticipation stage has long been hypothesised to be a key element of 
relapse in humans, and defines addiction as a chronic relapsing disorder. Although this stage 
has often been linked to the construct of craving, craving in itself has been diffi cult to 
measure in human clinical studies and does not always correlate with relapse.89 
Nevertheless, the stage in which the individual reinstates drug-seeking behaviour after 
abstinence remains a focus for identifying neurobiological mechanisms of relapse and the 
development of medications for treatment.

Executive control over incentive salience is essential to maintain goal-directed behaviour 
and the flexibility of stimulus–response associations. In rats, the prefrontal cortex (mainly 
prelimbic cortex, and some infralimbic cortex) sends glutamatergic projections directly to 
mesocortical dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, thus exerting excitatory 
control over dopamine cell firing and dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex90 (for

correspondence with humans, see figure 2). Given that ventral tegmental area dopamine cells 
project heavily to the basal ganglia, this frontal cortex glutamatergic projection might 
contribute to the development of incentive salience. Glutamatergic projections from the 
prefrontal cortex to the caudate and ventral striatum also modulate the control of the striatal-
pallidal-thalamo-cortical system through both direct (D1 receptor-mediated) and indirect (D2 
receptor-mediated) pathways. Thus, the prefrontal cortex is in a good position to regulate 
incentive salience and conditioned behaviour when a salient cue is presented to the 
individual.92,93

Evidence from rodent studies suggests that drug-induced reinstatement is mediated by the 
circuit that links the prelimbic prefrontal cortex to the ventral striatum94 (for correspondence 
with humans, see figure 2; tables 1, 2, circuits 12 and possibly 13). In rats, neurotransmitter 
systems that are involved in drug-induced reinstatement involve a glutamatergic projection 
from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens that is modulated by 
dopamine activity through D1 and D2 receptors in the frontal cortex. Cue-induced 
reinstatement also involves a glutamatergic projection from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex, 
basolateral amygdala, and ventral subiculum to the nucleus accumbens, and dopamine 
modulation in the basolateral amygdala and dorsal striatum (tables 1, 2, circuits 14 and 15).
51,52,95 By contrast, the stress-induced reinstatement of drug-related responding in animal 
models appears to depend on the activation of both CRF and norepinephrine in elements of 
the extended amygdala (ie, central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis; tables 1, 2, circuits 16 and 17)22,33,53,96–98 and the ventral tegmental area (tables 
1, 2, circuit 9). Protracted abstinence, largely described in alcohol dependence models, 
appears to involve overactive glutamatergic and CRF systems.99,100 Based on animal studies 
using rodents, increases in activity of the prefrontalglutamatergic system could be 
hypothesised to elicit a strong glutamatergic response that mediates craving-like responses 
during the preoccupation/anticipation stage (tables 1, 2, circuits 10 and 11).

In humans, cue-induced craving appears to involve activation of similar circuits, in which 
cues that are associated with drugs and elements of non-drug addictions produce activation 
of the prefrontal cortex, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, 
and medial orbitofrontal cortex.101–105 Imaging studies have also revealed that cues 
associated with cocaine craving increase dopamine release in the striatum, amygdala, and 
prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate and medial orbitofrontal cortex) and opioid peptides in 
the anterior cingulate and frontal cortex.9,31,106,107 Indeed, imaging studies have revealed 
baseline decreases in orbitofrontal (medial and lateral) and anterior cingulate (ventral and 
dorsal) function and dopamine function during dependence, but reactivation of dopamine 
and reward system function during acute craving episodes.108

Concomitant with prefrontal activation of a craving system that is mediated by glutamate, 
human imaging studies have reported deficits in executive function that are reflected by 
decreases in frontal cortex activity that interfere with decision making, self-regulation, 
inhibitory control, and working memory,109 and might involve disrupted GABAergic activity 
in the prefrontal cortex (table 2, circuit 13).50 For example, alcoholics exhibit impairments 
in the maintenance of spatial information, disruption of decision making, and impairments in 
behavioural inhibition. Indeed, Volkow and colleagues36 and Goldstein and Volkow14 have

described a syndrome that is characterised by excessive salience to drug-paired cues, 
decreases in the responsiveness to non-drug rewards, and decreases in the ability to inhibit 
maladaptive behaviour. Such frontal cortex-derived executive function disorders in addiction 
have been linked to deficits in the ability of behavioural treatments to effect recovery.110

Cravings for food, cocaine, and nicotine are also related to middle insular function.111–113 
Tobacco smokers with damage to the insula (but not control smokers with extra non-insular 
lesions) were able to stop smoking easily and without experiencing cravings or relapse.114 
The insula appears to have an interoceptive function that integrates autonomic and visceral 
information with emotion and motivation, thus providing conscious awareness of these 
urges.54 Brain lesion studies suggest that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and insula are 
necessary components of the distributed circuits that support both emotional115 and moral116 
decision making. Consistent with this hypothesis, imaging studies have reported differential 
activation of the insula during craving, possibly reflecting interoceptive cues and 
hypothesised to involve CRF activation (table 2, circuit 18).54,117,118 Accordingly, the 
reactivity of this brain region has been suggested to serve as a biomarker to help predict 
relapse.119

The capacity to inhibit prepotent responses is a major contributor to an individual’s 
vulnerability to addiction because it modulates the ability to avoid inappropriate behaviours.
120,121 Such a conceptual inhibition system involves a widely distributed and more complex 
prefrontal cortex–subcortical circuitry. Positron emission tomography studies have 
uncovered substantial reductions of D2 receptor availability in the striatum in individuals 
with addiction that persist for months after protracted detoxification, which have also been 
observed in preclinical studies in rodents and non-human primates with repeated drug 
exposure.122 These low levels of striatal D2 receptors have been associated with decreases in 
baseline glucose metabolism (ie, a marker of brain function) in the prefrontal cortex 
(including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and medial orbitofrontal 
cortex),35,123,124 impulsivity in methamphetamine abusers,125 and compulsive cocaine 
administration in rodents.15 Consistent with this hypothesis, the converse is also possible. 
Methamphetamine-dependent individuals with striatal D2 receptor availability within the 
normal range had better treatment outcomes, potentially reflecting a greater ability to 
acquire new reward-related behaviours and the pursuit of healthy goals.126

Two opposing systems can therefore be postulated: a Go system and a Stop system. The Go 
system could drive craving and engage habits via the basal ganglia.105,127 For example, 
steeper delayed discounting and cocaine craving in cocaine dependence is associated with 
increased connectivity in the network linking the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior 
cingulate cortex with the ventral striatum and in the network linking the insula with the 
dorsal striatum.128 Activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate is also associated with fear 
conditioning in post-traumatic stress disorder.129 The Stop system could control assessment 
of the incentive value of choices and suppression of affective responses to negative 
emotional signals.130–132 Under this framework, a Stop system would inhibit the Go craving 
system and stress system. For example, in post-traumatic stress disorder there is substantial 
evidence of hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hyperactivity in the 
central nucleus of the amygdala that reflects an inhibitory connection between the

ventromedial prefrontal cortex and central nucleus of the amygdala.133,134 Indeed, 
successful cognitive inhibition of craving in cocaine abusers has been associated with 
inhibition in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex and activation in the right inferior frontal 
cortex.135

Molecular and genetic treatment targets within brain circuits associated 

with addiction

The neuroplastic changes outlined previously are triggered and sustained by molecular and 
cellular adaptations that can presumably also interact with genetic and environmental 
vulnerability to addiction. In the binge/intoxication stage, both signal transduction 
mechanisms and changes in gene transcription have been identified. For example, chronic 
exposure to a wide variety of abused drugs upregulates cAMP formation, cAMP-dependent 
protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and PKA-dependent protein phosphorylation in the nucleus 
accumbens. Numerous interventions that tonically activate nucleus accumbens cAMP/PKA 
signalling promote escalations in drug self-administration or compulsive-like drug-seeking 
behaviour, and the upregulation of a postsynaptic Gs/cAMP/PKA signalling pathway in the 
nucleus accumbens might constitute a critical neuroadaptation that is central to the 
establishment and maintenance of the addicted state.136,137

These changes in signal transduction can trigger longer-term molecular neuroadaptations via 
transcription factors that modify gene expression. A well characterised example is that 
chronic exposure to various drugs of abuse increases the activation of cAMP response 
element binding protein in the nucleus accumbens and deactivates it in the central nucleus of 
the amygdala. Introduction of cAMP response element binding protein in the nucleus 
accumbens decreases the reinforcing value of natural and drug rewards, and this change 
plausibly contributes to withdrawal/negative affect stage-related decreases in reward 
pathway function, which leave a drug-abstinent individual in an amotivational, dysphoric, or 
depressed-like state.138,139 These substance-related changes in susceptibility to negative 
emotional states might begin early: alcohol use during adolescence might lead to epigenetic 
modifications that alter amygdalar gene expression and dendritic density, increasing 
susceptibility to anxiety-like behaviours and alcohol ingestion in adulthood.140

Substance-induced changes in transcription factors can also produce competing effects on 
reward function.141 For example, repeated substance use activates accumulating levels of 
ΔFosB, and animals with elevated ΔFosB exhibit exaggerated sensitivity to the rewarding 
effects of drugs of abuse, leading to the hypothesis that ΔFosB might be a sustained 
molecular trigger or switch that helps initiate and maintain a state of addiction.141,142 Next-
generation sequencing methods have shown that repeated cocaine exposure leads to histone 
modifications that act in a combinational fashion to create chromatin signatures that 
strikingly alter pre-mRNA splicing, an effect that is necessary for the expression of cocaine-
induced conditioned place preference.143

The heightened risk of cue-induced cocaine seeking (incubation of craving) that occurs 
during prolonged withdrawal (protracted abstinence in humans) has provided new insights 
into the molecular basis of vulnerability to relapse. During incubation in animal models,

AMPA-type glutamate receptors are recruited. Specifically, the infralimbic medial prefrontal 
cortex-to-nucleus accumbens shell circuit recruits calcium-permeable AMPA receptors,144 
and the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex-to-nucleus accumbens core circuit recruits non-
calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. The blockade of metabotropic glutamate 1 receptors in 
the nucleus accumbens blocks cue-induced incubation reinstatement and cocaine-primed 
reinstatement; as a result, these receptors are potential therapeutic targets.145,146

The kinase mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) belongs to 
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family and plays a key role in 
the dendritic translation of synaptic proteins. As such, mTORC1 plays a major role in the 
molecular mechanisms associated with learning and memory147 and is involved in several 
brain disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and addiction.
148,149 Exposure to drug and alcohol cues activates the mTORC1 pathway in the 
hippocampus, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala.149 Even more compelling, 
blockade of the mTORC1 pathway systemically blocked the reconsolidation of cocaine 
memories,150 and blockade of mTORC1 in the amygdala blocked the reconsolidation of 
alcohol memories;151 these results suggest a potential molecular target for the treatment of 
relapse.

Heritability of addictions is 40–60%, much of which is caused by genetic variations that 
affect underlying neurobiological mechanisms, and thus is consistent with there being 
common pathways to different addictions.152 Genes have been identified that convey 
vulnerability at all three stages of the addiction cycle, and salient candidates are discussed 
within this conceptual framework. However, a more comprehensive analysis is beyond the 
scope of this Review. In the binge/intoxication stage, several genes have been identified in 
animals as key to drug responses, and their modifications strongly affect drug self-
administration.37,153–155 Notably, in animal models, dopamine D1 receptor knockout rats 
will not self-administer cocaine37 and μ opioid receptor knockout mice will not show the 
rewarding effects of opioids.153 In humans, only a few specific genes have been identified 
with polymorphisms (alleles) that either predispose an individual to or protect an individual 
from drug addiction,156 but the number is growing. For example, genome-wide association 
studies have implicated two acetylcholine receptors, the α4 nicotinic receptor subunit157 and 
α5 nicotinic receptor subunit,158 in the vulnerability to nicotine dependence and a single-
nucleotide polymorphism associated with regulating the trafficking and gating properties of 
AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (CNIH3) in opioid dependence.159

Some of the polymorphisms associated with vulnerability for the binge/intoxication stage 
interfere with drug metabolism. For example, specific alleles for genes that encode alcohol 
dehydrogenase (ADH1B) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2; enzymes involved in 
the metabolism of alcohol) are reportedly protective against alcoholism.160 Intriguingly, an 
evolutionarily conserved GABA synthesis pathway mediated by aldehyde dehydrogenase 
1a1 (ALDH1a1) has been identified in the ventral tegmental area.161 GABA co-release is 
modulated by binge-like doses of alcohol administered to mice, and diminished ALDH1a1 
leads to enhanced alcohol consumption and preference. Similarly, polymorphisms in the 
genes for cytochrome P450 2A6 and 2D6 (enzymes involved in nicotine and opioid 
metabolism, respectively) are reportedly protective against nicotine addiction.162

From the perspective of the withdrawal/negative affect stage, in humans, two single-
nucleotide poly morphisms in the CRF1 receptor gene (CRHR1) were associated with binge 
drinking in adolescents and excessive drinking in adults.163 Moreover, homozygosity at one 
of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1876831, C allele) was associated with heavy 
drinking in relation to stressful life events in adolescents.164

From the perspective of the preoccupation/anticipation stage, a genetic knock-in mouse that 
bio logically recapitulates a common human mutation in the gene for fatty acid amide 
hydrolase (C385A [Pro129Thr], rs324420) presented a reduction of fatty acid amide 
hydrolase expression associated with the variant allele that selectively enhanced fronto-
amygdala connectivity and fear extinction learning and decreased anxiety-like behaviours; 
this result suggests another possible molecular genetic target for neuroplasticity in the 
preoccupation/anticipation and withdrawal/negative affect stages.165

Although such approaches do not guarantee that these genes convey vulnerability in the 
human population, they provide viable candidates for exploring the genetic basis of 
endophenotypes that are associated with addiction.

Developmental exposure as a key component of vulnerability for drug and 

alcohol use disorders

Normal developmental processes might result in higher risk for drug use at some stages of 
the lifecycle than others. Experimentation, as well as the process of addiction, most often 
starts in adolescence,166 a period during which the brain undergoes important developmental 
changes.167 Beginning in preadolescence and continuing into the mid-20s, cortical grey 
matter volumes reduce, which reflects a normal pruning process;168 white matter volume 
increases over the course of adolescence, reflecting increases in connectivity, including 
axonal extension and myelination.168 Drug exposure during adolescence is associated with 
more chronic and intensive use and greater risk of a substance use disorder than is initiation 
at older ages.167,169–172 Normal adolescent-specific behaviours (eg, risk-taking, novelty-
seeking, and high sensitivity to peer pressure) increase the propensity to experiment with 
legal and illegal drugs,167 which might reflect the incomplete development of brain regions 
(eg, myelination of frontal lobe regions) that are involved in the processes of executive 
control and motivation.168 Heavy alcohol use during adolescence is associated with a range 
of neurobehavioural sequelae, including impairments in visuospatial processing, attention, 
and memory,173,174 and adolescents who had engaged in episodes of heavy drinking 
presented faster declining volumes in some neocortical grey matter regions and smaller 
increases in regional white matter volumes than did non-drinking adolescents.175 
Additionally, voluntary binge drinking in animal models during adolescence reduced the 
density of myelinated axons in the medial prefrontal cortex.176

Environmental factors that have been consistently associated with the propensity to self-
administer drugs include structural factors (eg, low socioeconomic status and associated lack 
of social support systems), proximal factors (eg, parental drug use and dependence, as per 
the DSM-IV, poor quality of parenting, parental depression, and sibling and peer influences), 
and more distal factors (eg, drug availability, school, neighbourhood characteristics,

advertising, and the media).177,178 Stress is also a common feature that increases the risk for 
drug abuse. The mechanisms that are responsible for stress-induced increases in 
vulnerability to drug use and relapse in those who are addicted are not yet well understood, 
but evidence suggests that the stress-responsive neuropeptide CRF is involved through its 
effects in the amygdala and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.20

Relevance to behavioural addictive disorders

The three stages of the addiction cycle are pervasive and form common domains in non-drug 
addictions, also known as process addictions,179 such as pathological gambling, binge-eating 
disorder, compulsive buying, and internet addiction disorder.180 Non-drug addictions 
elaborate self-regulation failures similarly to drug addictions, with transitions from 
impulsivity to compulsivity and a chronic relapsing trajectory. Similar brain mechanisms, 
particularly with regard to reward deficits, stress sensitisation, and impaired inhibitory 
control, have been observed in behavioural or process addictions, as well as decreases in 
striatal dopamine D2 receptors associated with reduced activity in prefrontal cortices,181 
deficits in the Go craving system and Stop inhibition systems,182,183 and dysregulation of 
the stress axis.184

Implications for medication development

Our contention is that the field of the neurobiology of addiction has excellent and validated 
animal models and well developed clinical models that, combined with the neurocircuitry 
analysis herein, will provide a unique approach to medication development that emphasises 
excessive incentive salience, the loss of brain reward function, and the gain of stress function 
that drive negative reinforcement (ie, the dark side of addiction) and the dysregulation of 
executive function, all of which are key components that drive compulsive drug seeking.
13,185 Advances in diagnosis that reflect such an endophenotype or research domain criterion 
approach will synergistically combine with advances in neurobiology to promote novel 
pharmacotherapeutic, brain stimulation (ie, transcranial magnetic stimulation and direct 
electrical stimulation), and behavioural treatments.186

Conclusions and future directions

We elaborate here a heuristic framework based on the behavioural and imaging phenotypes 
of addiction as three stages linked by three functional domains that are mediated by three 
major neurobiological circuits (basal ganglia, extended amygdala, and prefrontal cortex) and 
numerous microcircuits of neuroplasticity. We outline 18 neurochemically defined mini 
circuits that can independently or interactively load the outputs of the major common 
neurobiological circuits to produce incentive salience and compulsive-like habits, negative 
emotional states of low reward and excessive stress, and compromised executive function. 
Identification of these molecular and neurochemical loads on the circuitry provides key 
information about vulnerability, resilience, treatment, and recovery from addiction, as well 
as information on how different drugs of abuse enter the overall addiction cycle. Non-drug 
addictions, such as pathological gambling, have a similar behavioural phenotype that fits 
into the three-stage cycle. Preliminary imaging data also suggest common neurobiology. Key

questions that remain are what genetic factors load these mini circuits, how the environment 
conveys epigenetic influences on these circuits, and how these circuits recover or do not 
recover with abstinence and treatment. Resolving these questions should provide biomarkers 
for prevention, behavioural windows of development for prevention, novel behavioural and 
pharmaceutical treatments, and ultimately a neurobiological understanding of recovery.

Key messages

Substance use disorders are complex, multistage diseases that are 
characterised by disturbances in three major neurocircuits: (i) basal ganglia-
driven binge/intoxication stage, (ii) extended amygdala-driven withdrawal/
negative affect stage, and (iii) prefrontal cortex-driven preoccupation/
anticipation stage.

In these three domains, neurotransmitter-specific and neuromodulator-specific 
neuroplastic changes are seen in 18 subsystems, including the ascending 
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, corticotropin-releasing factor in the 
central nucleus of the amygdala, and corticostriatal glutamate projections.

During the binge/intoxication stage, previously neutral stimuli become 
associated with drug availability, thereby gaining incentive salience and 
promoting habit formation that fosters excessive drug seeking via increases in 
dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission.

The binge/intoxication stage triggers opponent-process responses that 
diminish reward function via dopamine and opioid peptide deficits and 
increased brain stress system activity through the engagement of 
corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin.

Excessive drug intake also drives parallel deficits in executive function via the 
dysregulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic neuronal 
networks in the prefrontal cortex, which perpetuate the dysregulation of 
reward and stress function and induce compulsive drug use.

During the preoccupation/anticipation stage, heightened drug cue-induced 
incentive salience can act against a background of low reward system function 
and high stress system function, engaging a powerful combination of positive 
and negative reinforcement processes that drive pathological drug seeking.

Molecular genetic mediation and epigenetic changes in these same circuits 
provide pre-existing vulnerabilities to addiction, increased susceptibility to 
environmental risk factors, and targets for development of novel treatments 
and resilience to relapse.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We identified seminal articles published in peer-reviewed journals and reports that were 
pertinent to the neurobiology of addiction using in-house expertise, consultations with 
other experts in the field, and searches of key databases, including PubMed. The 
exclusion and inclusion criteria for the articles were deliberately kept flexible. The scope 
of the review was expanded based on findings from the review of key papers and reports.

Figure 1: Model of interacting circuits in which disruptions contribute to compulsive-like 
behaviours underlying drug addiction
The overall neurocircuitry domains correspond to three functional domains: binge/
intoxication (reward and incentive salience: basal ganglia [blue]), withdrawal/negative affect 
(negative emotional states and stress: extended amygdala and habenula [red]), and 
preoccupation/anticipation (craving, impulsivity, and executive function: PFC, insula, and 
allocortex [green]). Arrows depict major circuit connections between domains, and numbers 
refer to neurochemical and neurocircuit-specific pathways known to support brain changes 
that contribute to the allostatic state of addiction. PFC=prefrontal cortex. ACC=anterior 
cingulate cortex. OFC=orbitofrontal cortex. NAc-VTA=nucleus accumbens-ventral
