ABSTRACT
Background: About 40% of rape victims develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within 
three  months  after  the  assault.  Considering  the  high  personal  and  societal  impact  of  PTSD, 
there is an urgent need for early (i.e. within three months after the incident) interventions to 
reduce post-traumatic stress in victims of rape.
Objective: To assess the effectiveness of early intervention with eye movement desensitization 
and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress, feelings of guilt 
and  shame,  sexual  dysfunction,  and  other  psychological  dysfunction  (i.e.  general  psycho-
pathology, anxiety, depression, and dissociative symptoms) in victims of rape.
Method:  This  randomized  controlled  trial  included  57  victims  of  rape,  who  were  randomly 
allocated  to  either  two  sessions  of  EMDR  therapy  or  treatment  as  usual  (‘watchful  waiting’) 
between 14 and 28 days post-rape. Psychological symptoms were assessed at pre-treatment, 
post-treatment, and 8 and 12 weeks post-rape. Linear mixed models and ANCOVAs were used 
to analyse differences between conditions over time.
Results:  Within-group  effect  sizes  of  the  EMDR  condition  (d  =  0.89  to  1.57)  and  control 
condition  (d  =  0.79  to  1.54)  were  large,  indicating  that  both  conditions  were  effective. 
However, EMDR therapy was not found to be more effective than watchful waiting in reducing 
post-traumatic  stress  symptoms,  general  psychopathology,  depression,  sexual  dysfunction, 
and  feelings  of  guilt  and  shame.  Although  EMDR  therapy  was  found  to  be  more  effective 
than  watchful  waiting  in  reducing  anxiety  and  dissociative  symptoms  in  the  post-treatment 
assessment, this effect disappeared over time.
Conclusions:  The  findings  do  not  support  the  notion  that  early  intervention  with  EMDR 
therapy  in  victims  of  rape  is  more  effective  than  watchful  waiting  for  the  reduction  of 
psychological  symptoms,  including  symptoms  of  post-traumatic  stress.  Further  research  on 
the  effectiveness  of  early  interventions,  including  watchful  waiting,  for  this  specific  target 
group is needed.

Intervención temprana con Terapia de Desensibilización 
y Reprocesamiento por Movimiento Ocular (EMDR) para reducir la 
gravedad de los síntomas de estrés postraumático en víctimas de 
violación reciente: Un ensayo controlado aleatorizado
Antecedentes: Aproximadamente el 40% de las víctimas de violación desarrollan trastorno de 
estrés  postraumático  (TEPT)  dentro  de  los  tres  meses  posteriores  a  la  agresión.  Teniendo  en 
cuenta  el  alto  impacto  personal  y  social  del TEPT,  existe  una  necesidad  urgente  de  interven-
ciones  tempranas  (es  decir,  dentro  de  los  tres  meses  posteriores  al  incidente)  para  reducir  el 
estrés postraumático en las víctimas de violación.
Objetivo: Evaluar la efectividad de la intervención temprana con terapia de desensibilización 
y  reprocesamiento  por  movimiento  ocular  (EMDR  en  su  sigla  en  inglés)  para  reducir  los 
síntomas  de  estrés  postraumático,  sentimientos  de  culpa  y  vergüenza,  disfunción  sexual, 
y  otras  disfunciones  psicológicas  (es  decir,  psicopatología  general,  ansiedad,  depresión, 
y síntomas disociativos) en víctimas de violación.
Método:  Este  ensayo  controlado  aleatorizado  incluyó  a  57  víctimas  de  violación,  que  fueron 
asignadas al azar a dos sesiones de terapia EMDR o al tratamiento habitual (“espera vigilante”)

entre  14  y  28  días  después  de  la  violación.  Los  síntomas  psicológicos  se  evaluaron  antes  del 
tratamiento, después del tratamiento, y 8 y 12 semanas después de la violación. Se utilizaron 
modelos lineales mixtos y ANCOVAs para analizar las diferencias entre las condiciones a lo largo 
del tiempo.
Resultados: Los tamaños del efecto dentro del grupo de la condición EMDR (d  = 0.89 a 1.57) 
y la condición de control (d = 0.79 a 1.54) fueron grandes, lo que indica que ambas condiciones 
fueron efectivas. Sin embargo, no se encontró que la terapia EMDR fuera más efectiva que la 
espera vigilante para reducir los síntomas de estrés postraumático, la psicopatología general, la 
depresión, la disfunción sexual, y los sentimientos de culpa y vergüenza. Aunque se encontró 
que  la  terapia  EMDR  era  más  efectiva  que  la  espera  vigilante  para  reducir  la  ansiedad  y  los 
síntomas disociativos en la evaluación posterior al tratamiento, este efecto desapareció con el 
tiempo.
Conclusiones: Los hallazgos no apoyan la noción de que la intervención temprana con terapia 
EMDR en víctimas de violación sea más efectiva que la espera vigilante para la reducción de los 
síntomas  psicológicos,  incluyendo  los  síntomas  del  estrés  postraumático.  Se  necesitan  más 
investigaciones  sobre  la  efectividad  de  las  intervenciones  tempranas,  incluida  la  espera  vigi-
lante, para este grupo objetivo específico.

A  recent  population  study  among  Dutch  citizens 
found that 15% of women and 3% of men had experi-
enced  rape,  that  is,  vaginal,  oral,  or  anal  sex  without 
consent  (De  Graaf  &  Wijsen,  2017).  Another  study 
estimated the lifetime prevalence, averaged over gen-
ders,  at  5.8%  worldwide  (Kessler  et  al.,  2017). 
Exposure to rape has been found to contribute to the 
development  of  psychological  problems,  such  as 
depression,  dissociation,  substance  abuse,  feelings  of 
guilt and shame, and suicidal ideation (Aakvaag et al., 
2016;  Faravelli,  Giugni,  Salvatori,  &  Ricca,  2004; 
Galatzer-Levy,  Nickerson,  Litz,  &  Marmar,  2013; 
Söndergaard,  & 
Tiihonen  Möller,  Bäckströ, 
Helström, 2014; Weaver et al., 2007). Victims of rape 
can  also  develop  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD),  a  mental  health  condition  characterized  by 
symptoms  of  intrusions,  avoidance,  negative  cogni-
tions and mood, and hyperarousal related to exposure 
to 
(American  Psychiatric 
Association  [APA],  2013;  Rothbaum,  Foa,  Riggs, 
Murdock, & Walsh, 1992).

traumatic  event 

the 

Studies  have  found  that  almost  all  rape  victims 
experience  symptoms  of  post-traumatic  stress  in  the 
days following the event (Rothbaum et al., 1992) and 

about  40%  will  develop  PTSD  within  three  months 
(Elklit  &  Christiansen,  2010;  Tiihonen  Möller  et  al., 
2014).  The  development  of  PTSD  after  rape  is  thus 
highly prevalent. PTSD has a substantial personal and 
societal  impact,  not  only  through  the  impairment 
caused by  its  symptoms  but also  because it  is  known 
to predict the development of mood disorders, anxiety 
disorders,  and  substance  abuse  disorders  (Kessler, 
2000).  Collectively,  these  mental  health  problems 
cost  nearly  two  trillion  dollars  per  year  in  the  US, 
which  is  two  thirds  of  the  total  economic  burden 
caused by rape (Peterson, DeGue, Florence, & Lokey, 
2017).  PTSD  is  also  related  to  physical  problems, 
including  cardiovascular  and  gastrointestinal  symp-
toms,  chronic  pain  (Gupta,  2013),  and  pelvic  floor 
problems  (Karsten  et  al.,  2020).  Furthermore,  rape 
victims  who  develop  PTSD  have  an  increased  risk  of 
revictimization,  that  is,  experiencing  new  sexual 
assaults  (Messman-Moore,  Ward,  &  Brown,  2009). 
Thus, PTSD can catalyse a cycle of physical and mental 
health problems that each increases the societal impact 
and decrease victims’ quality of life.

Preventing  the  personal  and  public  health  burden 
of  mental  illnesses  is  complex  because  the  cause  and 

onset of disorders are difficult to determine. PTSD is 
an exception, as the disorder is initiated by a traumatic 
event, and the time of onset of its symptoms is often 
known (Magruder, McLaughlin, & Borbon, 2017). To 
this end, PTSD provides a unique possibility for early 
intervention  to  prevent  the  development  and  conse-
quences of the disorder. A meta-analysis of early inter-
vention  after  sexual  assault,  including  RCTs  on 
prolonged exposure, video intervention, and cognitive 
processing  therapy,  found  a  significantly  greater 
reduction  of  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  after 
early  intervention  than  standard  care  (Oosterbaan, 
Covers,  Bicanic,  Huntjens,  &  de  Jongh,  2019). 
the  authors 
Despite 
emphasized that the evidence was based on only four 
studies  and  that  the  risk  of  bias  in  these  early  inter-
vention studies was high, especially selection bias.

this  encouraging  outcome, 

Eye  movement  desensitization  and  reprocessing 
(EMDR)  therapy  is  one  of  the  recommended  treat-
ments  for  PTSD  once  the  diagnosis  is  established 
(International  Society  for  Traumatic  Stress  Studies 
[ISTSS],  2018;  National 
Guidelines  Committee 
Institute  for  Health  and  Clinical  Excellence  [NICE], 
2018).  In  recent  years,  several  RCTs  showed  that,  in 
non-sexual  trauma  victims  and  relative  to  no  treat-
ment,  early  intervention  with  EMDR  therapy  within 
six weeks post-trauma is efficacious in reducing post- 
traumatic  stress  (Jarero,  Artigas,  &  Luber,  2011; 
Shapiro  &  Laub,  2015;  Tarquinio  et  al.,  2016).  Yet, 
the  effectiveness  of  EMDR  therapy  as  an  early  inter-
vention after rape still has to be established. Therefore, 
we  conducted  an  RCT  aimed  to  determine  the  effec-
tiveness of EMDR therapy on psychological symptoms 
after  rape.  Our  primary  hypothesis  was  that  indivi-
duals,  who  had  very  recently  been  raped  and  who 
received EMDR therapy between two and four weeks 
following  this  event,  would  demonstrate  significantly 
lower  levels  of  self-reported  and  clinician-reported 
post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  at  post-treatment 
and eight and 12-weeks post-rape follow-ups, relative 
to  individuals  who  received  treatment  as  usual  (i.e. 
‘watchful  waiting’).  Secondly,  it  was  hypothesized 
that victims of recent rape who received EMDR ther-
apy  would  demonstrate  a  significantly  lower  level  of 
sexual and psychological dysfunction (i.e. general psy-
chopathology,  anxiety,  depression  and  dissociative 
symptoms),  and  feelings  of  guilt  and  shame  at  post- 
treatment,  and  both  follow-ups,  than  victims  who 
received treatment as usual.

1. Method

randomly assigned to one of the two study conditions 
on  a  1:1  ratio:  EMDR  therapy  or  treatment  as  usual 
(TAU).  Participation  included  assessments  at  four 
time  points.  For  a  detailed  description  of  the  study 
protocol, see Covers et al. (2019). Neither trial design 
nor  eligibility  criteria  changed  during  the  trial.  The 
only adjustment to the study protocol was the decision 
to report PTSD diagnosis without further analysis1.

1.2. Participants

Victims of rape who contacted one of the participating 
sexual  assault  centres  within  one  week  after  they 
experienced rape were screened for research participa-
tion. In this study, rape was defined as vaginal, oral, or 
anal  penetration  without  consent,  as  reported  by  the 
victim. Victims younger than 16, victims with cogni-
tive disabilities, and victims who did not speak Dutch 
were excluded from study participation. Also, victims 
who  required  immediate  psychological  care  for  psy-
choses,  suicidal  ideation,  or  addiction  were  excluded 
from the study. Additionally, in order to exclude those 
with pre-existing PTSD, victims who received concur-
rent  trauma-focused  treatment  for  prior  experiences 
were  excluded  from  the  study.  Exclusion  was  not 
based  on  symptom  levels  as  most  victims  were 
expected  to  exhibit  relatively  high  levels  of  post- 
traumatic  stress  symptoms  immediately  post-rape 
(Rothbaum et al., 1992; Steenkamp, Dickstein, Salters- 
Pedneault,  Hofmann,  &  Litz,  2012;  Tiihonen  Moller 
2014). Fifty-seven victims, including one male, agreed 
to participate in this study.

1.3. Procedures

The  study  was  approved  by  the  Medical  Ethical 
Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht 
and registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NTR6760). 
Upon admission to the sexual assault centres, victims 
received medical care and could be put in contact with 
the  police.  Victims  also  received  psychoeducation 
about common reactions after rape by a case manager 
via  telephone  one  day  after  admission  to  the  centre. 
Between  March  2018  and  January  2020,  victims  of 
rape  who  contacted  one  of  the  participating  sexual 
assault centres within one week after they experienced 
rape  were  screened  for  research  participation  during 
this call. The case manager screened for the exclusion 
criteria  of  the  study  using  the  information  from  the 
conversation  with  the  victim.  No  instruments  were 
used to assess the exclusion criteria. Victims who did 
not meet the exclusion criteria received a study infor-
mation  letter.  The  following  day,  the  researcher  con-
tacted  these  victims  for  further  information.  After 
informed  consent,  subjects  were  randomly  allocated 
to EMDR therapy or TAU. Both groups received their 
intervention  between  two  and  four  weeks  post-rape 

4

and  were  assessed  at  the  following  time  points:  pre- 
treatment  at  two  weeks  post-rape,  post-treatment  at 
one week after the treatment (4 to 5 weeks post-rape), 
and two follow-up assessments at eight and 12 weeks 
post-rape. The assessors were blinded to the interven-
tion  allocation.  Subjects  received  a  20  euro  incentive 
after  concluding  their  participation,  regardless  of 
whether 
they  completed  all  assessments.  The 
CONSORT  2010  guideline  (Schulz,  Altman,  & 
Moher,  2010)  was  followed  for  the  reporting  of 
this RCT.

subsequent referral for evidence-based treatment. For 
the purpose of the present study, subjects in the con-
trol condition were not referred after watchful waiting 
by the case manager. Instead, watchful waiting ended 
at one-month post-rape. If needed, subjects from both 
study  conditions  with  a  high  need  for  psychological 
treatment could be referred for therapy after the study 
by  the  researchers.  If  there  was  an  urgent  need  for 
treatment  during  the  study  participation,  subjects 
were referred immediately but excluded from further 
participation in the study.

Interventions

1.5. Measures

Subjects in the intervention arm of this study received 
3.5  hours  of  EMDR  therapy  across  two  sessions.  In 
EMDR therapy eye movements are used to reduce the 
trauma  memory 
vividness  and  emotionality  of 
(Shapiro,  2018).  In  the  present  study,  the  Dutch  ver-
sion of the standard eight-phased EMDR protocol (De 
Jongh  &  Ten  Broeke,  2019;  Shapiro,  2018)  was  used. 
The trauma memory was conceptualized as a memory 
lasting  from  a  period  of  time  from  the  rape  until 
the  day  of  treatment.  This  adaptation,  derived  from 
the  EMDR  Recent  Traumatic  Episode  Protocol 
(R-TEP;  Shapiro  &  Laub,  2008,  2014;  Shapiro,  2012) 
pertains to minor changes to the wording of sentences 
in  some  phases  of  the  EMDR  standard  protocol, 
including the memory of the trauma episode (i.e. the 
period of time of the rape until the day of treatment) 
and  installation  of  the  positive  cognition  and  body 
scan related to the trauma episode rather than linked 
to  the  specific  rape  memory  per  se.  Therapists  were 
eight licenced psychologists who completed an accre-
dited course of EMDR therapy and were trained in the 
application of the study protocol. Video recordings of 
the sessions were made for bimonthly supervision by 
two EMDR Europe accredited trainers in EMDR ther-
apy ([author initials redacted for peer review]) and in 
order  to  determine  treatment  adherence.  This  treat-
ment  adherence  was  measured  using  an  EMDR- 
specific treatment integrity checklist used in previous 
EMDR  studies  (e.g.  Van  den  Berg  et  al.,  2015). 
Twenty-five per cent of the 48 video recordings were 
assessed  by  two  independent  psychology  graduates. 
There  were  no  inconsistencies  in  these  two  assess-
ments and treatment fidelity proved high (97%).

The  control  condition  of  the  study  entailed  the 
sexual  assault  centres’  treatment  as  usual.  This  con-
sisted  of  two  telephone  contacts  of  approximately 
30  minutes  with  a  case  manager,  who  provided  psy-
choeducation  and  emotional  support  in  accordance 
with  a  watchful  waiting  protocol  (NICE,  2018).  This 
protocol is currently standard in all (16) sexual assault 
centres in the Netherlands and stipulates screening for 
post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  at  least  two  times 
during  the  first  month  post-rape  and,  if  indicated, 

For  an  overview  of  all  outcome  measures,  the  total 
score range and the internal consistency in the current 
study,  see  Table  1.  For  a  complete  description  of  the 
measures,  we  refer  the  reader  to  the  study  protocol 
(Covers  et  al.,  2019).  The  use  of  the  Female  Sexual 
Function Index (FSFI; Rosen et al., 2000) was altered 
after data collection. The FSFI measured the presence 
and quality of sexual desires, arousal, and penetration.

exception  of  the  FSFI,  where  higher  scores  indicate  less  psychopathol-

The  total  score  of  the  FSFI  can  only  be  used 
for participants who have been sexually active during 
the  study.  Therefore,  we  used  a  combined  score 
based on two domains (desire and satisfaction) of the 
FSFI  that  did  not  rely  on  sexual  activity  during  the 
study.

1.6. Statistical analysis

Independent-samples  t-tests  and  chi-square  tests  were 
executed  to  test  for  any  differences  in  pre-treatment 
measures  between  non-completers  (dropout  at  any 
point  during  the  study  including  dropout  before  pre- 
treatment assessment) and completers (participation up 
to the last follow-up). To determine the effectiveness of 
EMDR therapy in reducing post-traumatic stress symp-
toms and other psychological dysfunction, a covariance 
pattern  linear  mixed  model  analysis  (Liu,  Rovine,  & 
Molenaar,  2012)  was  conducted  on  the  intention-to- 

treat  sample  while  adjusting  for  pre-treatment  assess-
ment  scores.  Analyses  including  only  assessment  com-
pleters  were  not  possible,  since  the  small  completers 
sample  caused  a  lack  of  statistical  power  (Figure  1). 
Fixed  effects  were  time,  condition,  and  the  interaction 
between time and condition. When significant condition 
effects  were  found,  group  differences  over  time  were 
further  analysed  by  pairwise  comparisons  with 
a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. The 
effect  of  EMDR  therapy  on  sexual  dysfunction  (FSFI,

with  ANCOVAs  with  pre-treatment  assessment  of  the 
respective measures as covariates. For the analyses, BSI, 
DTS, and AOPFS scores were transformed using square 
root  to  adjust  for  non-normality.  Any  missing  item 
scores were imputed using a two-way multiple imputa-

2. Results

2.1. Attrition  and baseline

Figure 1 shows the attrition of participants from enrol-
ment to analysis. In the present study, one participant in 
the EMDR condition experienced an increase in suicidal 
ideation  between  pre-treatment  and  post-treatment 
assessments  after  which  participation  in  the  study  was 
discontinued and psychological care was initiated. As the 
analyses of the present study are on an intention-to-treat 
basis,  this  participant  was  not  excluded  from  the 
analyses.

A  total  of  37  participants  completed  the  12-week 
follow-up assessment. However, one of these participants 
was not available for the post-treatment assessment and 
8-week  follow-up  assessment,  and  is  therefore  consid-
ered  a  non-completer 
the  dropout  analysis. 
in 
Assessments  of  non-completers  (n  =  21)  did  not  differ 
from  participants  who  completed  all  assessments 
(n  =  36)  with  respect  to  age  (t  =  −1.18,  df  =  55, 
p = .243), treatment allocation (χ2 = 0.14, p = .707), and 
relationship  to  the  perpetrator  (known  vs  unknown, 
χ2  = 0.24, p = .622). Participants who dropped out after 
completion of the pre-treatment assessment (i.e. missed 
any  of  the  three  post-treatment  assessments  but  com-
pleted  the  pre-treatment  assessment,  n  =  16)  did  not 
differ  from  those  who  completed  all  assessments 
(n  =  36)  in  pre-treatment  post-traumatic  stress  symp-
toms  (PCL-5;  t  =  .323,  df  =  50,  p  =  .748)  or  general 
psychopathology  symptoms  (BSI;  t  =  −0.55,  df  =  50, 
p = .584).

2.2. Demographic and clinical characteristics

The  mean  age  of  the  57  participants  was  25.81  years 
(SD  =  8.18)  with  no  difference  between  the  EMDR 
therapy condition (M = 25.52, SD = 7.93) and the TAU

condition  (M  =  25.88,  SD  =  8.23;  t  =  0.161,  df  =  50, 
p = .872). Further participant characteristics are found

could be diagnosed in 16% (n = 3) of the participants 
in  the  EMDR  condition  and  35%  (n  =  6)  of  the 
participants in the TAU condition.

2.3. Early EMDR process

Among  those  who  received  EMDR  therapy  (n  =  26), 
on average 5.92 target images (SD = 3.45, range 0–13) 
were  treated  with  a  SUD  (subjective  unit  of  distur-
bance)  of  zero.  These  targets  include  images  of  the 
assault and the aftermath, as well as images of future 
fears (‘Flashforward procedure’; de Jongh, 2015; Logie 
& De Jongh, 2014) and present triggers (‘Mental video 
check’; de Jongh, 2015; Shapiro, 2018). At eight-week 
post-rape,  47%  (n  =  9)  of  the  participants  in  the 
EMDR condition and 58% (n = 11) of the participants 
in  the  TAU  condition  met  the  diagnostic  criteria  for 
PTSD1  according to the CAPS-5. At 12 weeks, PTSD 

2.4. Effectiveness of EMDR therapy

Across  all  outcome  measures,  the  between-group 
effect  sizes  were  small  to  medium  (Table  4;  Cohen, 
1988).  All  between-group  effect  sizes  indicate  fewer 
symptoms  for  the  EMDR  condition  than  the  TAU 
condition.  Medium  to  large  within-group  effect  sizes 
were  found  for  the  EMDR  condition,  and  small  to 
large for the TAU condition.

tom  scores  per  condition  over  time,  reflecting

2.4.2. Psychological functioning
For  HADS  Anxiety  (Figure  2  and  Table  5),  the 
results  showed  a  significant  effect  of  time  at  8  and 
12  weeks  with  decreasing  HADS  Anxiety  scores 
over  time  compared  to  post-treatment.  There  was 
a  significant  effect  of  condition  where  the  EMDR 
condition  scored  lower  than  the  TAU  condition  at 
post-treatment. There was no significant condition– 
time  interaction  at  8  and  12  weeks.  Pairwise  com-
parisons  showed  a  significant  difference  between 
conditions 
(Mdiff  =  2.25, 
SE  =  0.95,  p  =  .023,  95%  CI  =  [0.32,  4.17])  but 
not at eight weeks (Mdiff  = 1.67, SE = 1.16, p = .158, 
95%  CI  =  [−0.68,  4.01])  or  12  weeks  (Mdiff  =  1.05, 
SE  =  1.35,  p  =  .440,  95%  CI  =  [−1.68,  3.79]).  Also, 
the  DTS 
showed 
a  significant  effect  of  time  at  eight  and  12  weeks 
with  decreasing  scores  over  time  compared  to  post- 
treatment.  There  was  a  significant  effect  of  condi-
tion  with  lower  scores  for  EMDR  than  TAU  at 
post-treatment  and  no  significant  condition–time 
interaction. However, pairwise comparisons showed 
a  significant  difference  between  conditions  at  post- 
treatment  (Mdiff  =  1.14,  SE  =  0.44,  p  =  .013,  95% 
CI  =  [1.18,  9.25])  and  eight  weeks  Mdiff  =  1.01, 
SE  =  0.44,  p  =  .029,  95%  CI  =  [0.50,  8.73]),  but 
the  difference  at  12  weeks  was  not  significant  (Mdiff 
=  0.75,  SE  =  0.37,  p  =  .051,  95%  CI  =  −0.10,  6.89]). 
Furthermore,  both  the  BSI  and  HADS  Depression 
scores showed no significant effect of condition and 
no  significant  condition–time  interaction  (Table  5). 
The  effect  of  time  was  significant  at  8 and  12  weeks 

(Figure  2  and  Table  5) 

with  decreasing  scores  over  time  compared  to  post- 
treatment.

2.4.3. Sexual functioning, guilt  and shame
Table 6 displays the results of the ANCOVA analyses. 
The results showed no significant effect for condition 
on the AOPFS scores (F(1, 35) = 1.71, p = .200) and the 
FSFI scores  (F(1, 35) =  0.13,  p =  .719).  No condition 
effect  was  found  for  change  in  sexual  desire  (F(1, 
36) = 0.25, p = .618), guilt (F (1,36) = 0.71, p = .405), 
and shame (F(1, 36) = 1.45, p = .236) either.

4. Discussion

This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate 
the  effectiveness  of  early  intervention  with  EMDR 
therapy  in  reducing  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms, 
as well as symptoms of other psychological and sexual 
dysfunction, and feelings of guilt and shame in victims 
of rape. The results do not support the primary study 
hypothesis in that victims of rape who received EMDR 
therapy between two and four weeks post-rape did not 
demonstrate  less  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  at 
post-treatment  and  8-  and  12-week  follow-ups  than 
victims  who  received  watchful  waiting  (TAU).  The 
study found large  reductions  in post-traumatic  stress 
symptoms  between  two  and  12  weeks  post-rape  in 
both study conditions as evident in effect sizes.

These results contrast with a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of early intervention after sexual assault 
(Oosterbaan et al., 2019), where interventions prior to 
three months post-rape were found to be more effec-
tive  than  the  control  conditions  in  reducing  post- 
traumatic  stress  symptoms.  Notably,  the  studies  in 
this  meta-analysis  differed  from  the  present  study  in 
methodology.  Indeed,  an  RCT  on  early  intervention 
with  prolonged  exposure  for  victims of  rape did  find 
a significant difference in post-traumatic stress symp-
toms at 12 weeks  post-rape between  the intervention 
and  control  condition  (Rothbaum  et  al.,  2012). 
However,  the  control  condition  in  that  study  was 
a  no  treatment  control  condition.  In  contrast,  the 
present study used a TAU control condition (watchful 
waiting) consisting of psycho-education, active listen-
ing, and well-informed advise. An RCT on early inter-
vention using cognitive processing therapy after rape

by Nixon, Best, Beatty, and Weber (2016), which was 
also  carried  out  at  a  sexual  assault  centre  and  used 
a  similar  TAU  control  condition  as  in  the  present 
study, found similar between-group effect sizes as the 
present  study  (Cohen’s  d  PCL-5  at  post-treatment 
=  0.30  and  at  12  weeks  post-rape  =  0.16,  indicating 
fewer  symptoms  for  the  intervention  condition  than 
the  control  condition).  Moreover,  the  within-group 
effect size between 2 and 12 weeks post-rape associated 
with the application of EMDR therapy in the present 
study was very large (Cohen’s d PCL-5 = 1.57; Cohen, 
1988). This effect size is larger than the one found by 
Nixon  et  al.  (2016;  Cohen’s  d  PCL-5  =  0.95),  even 
though  their  intervention  consisted  of  six  sessions 
compared to our two sessions. Noteworthy, however, 
the participants in the watchful waiting (TAU) condi-
tion also decreased in post-traumatic stress symptoms 
over  time  (Cohen’s  d  PCL-5  =  1.57).  Although  some 
natural regression of acute stress symptoms during the 
first months post-rape was expected (Steenkamp et al., 
2012), the results might suggest that natural regression 
is  a  particularly  powerful  factor  in  this  target  group 
(i.e. in both conditions). It is of note that the findings 
of the present study support a recent meta-analysis of 
early  intervention  after  any  type  of  trauma  (Roberts 
et al., 2019), which found early interventions to be no 
more  effective  as 
treatment-as-usual  on  post- 
traumatic  stress  symptoms  at  post-treatment  and 
longer  follow-ups,  when  intervention  was  offered  to 
all individuals exposed, regardless of symptomatology.
The  results  of  the  present  study  were  also  not 
supportive  of  the  secondary  hypothesis  in  that 
victims  of  rape  who  received  EMDR  therapy  did 
not  report  significantly  less  sexual  dysfunction, 
psychological  dysfunction  (which  included  symp-
toms  of  general  psychopathology,  anxiety,  depres-
sion,  and  dissociation),  and  feelings  of  guilt  and 
shame  than  victims  who  received  watchful  waiting 
(TAU).  These  symptoms  reduced  strongly  over 
time  in  both  study  conditions.  Although  EMDR 
therapy  was  found  to  be  more  effective  than 
watchful  waiting  (TAU)  in  reducing  symptoms  of 
anxiety  and  dissociation  at  post-treatment,  we 
were  unable  to  find  sufficient  evidence  to  deter-
mine  a  lasting  surplus  effect  of  EMDR  therapy 
across  12  weeks  post-rape  on  these  symptom  clus-
ters.  This  initial  effect  of  EMDR  therapy  on  anxi-
ety  and  dissociation  may  be  caused  by 
the 
traumatic  memories.

Specifically,  EMDR  aimed  at  individuals’  flashfor-
wards  (i.e.  images  of  future  fears)  and  the  imple-
mentation  of  a  mental  video  check  (i.e.  anxiety 
and  tensions  about  present  events)  was  used  as 
additional  interventions  meant  to  treat  present 
and  anticipatory  fears,  such  as  the  fear  of  being

reduction  in  anxiety  and  dissociative  symptoms. 
Still,  victims  of  the  watchful  waiting  (TAU)  con-
dition  also  showed  reduced  symptoms  of  anxiety 
and  dissociation  across  time,  and  at  12  weeks 
post-rape 
these  symptoms  were  equal  across 
study  conditions.  Finally,  whereas  no  prior 
research  has  studied  the  effect  of  early  interven-
tion  after  rape  on  symptoms  of  anxiety  or  disso-
ciation,  nor  sexual  dysfunction  and  feelings  of 
guilt  and  shame,  two  RCTs  have  studied  the  effect 
of  early  intervention  on  symptoms  of  depression 
(Resnick  et  al.,  2007;  Rothbaum  et  al.,  2012).  Our 
findings  on  symptoms  of  depression  are  in  con-
trast  to  those  studies  in  which  early  interventions 
were found  to be  more  effective in  reducing symp-
toms  of  depression  in  victims  of  sexual  assault 
than  no 
al.,  2007; 
Rothbaum  et  al.,  2012).  The  lack  of  between- 
group  effect  in  the  present  study  may  be  explained 
by  the  focus  of  watchful  waiting  on  normalizing 
stress responses experienced during and after rape, 
such  as  genital  response  and  tonic  immobility. 
Also,  the  encouragement  of  social  sharing,  as 
well  as  the  involvement  of  important  others  and 
educating  these  persons  to  give  the  victim  social 
support  and  acknowledgement,  is  known  to  have

(Resnick 

et 

Lastly, an important outcome of the present study 
is that EMDR therapy is a safe option for early inter-
vention  after  rape,  even  for  victims  who  had  prior 
experience  with  sexual  abuse.  Only  one  participant 
discontinued  participation  due  to  increased  suicide 
ideation.  No  other  (serious)  adverse  events  were 
found.

The present study has several limitations. First, the 
EMDR intervention was compared to a TAU control 
condition.  This  means  that  no  comparison  could  be 
made  between  EMDR  therapy  and  no  treatment  or 
between  watchful  waiting  (TAU)  and  no  treatment. 
The  alternative  to  a  waitlisted  control  condition  was 
believed to be unethical in this study considering the 
high risk of developing psychopathology after a rape. 
Moreover,  for  clinical  practice,  it  can  be  argued  that 
the most relevant question is whether EMDR therapy 
is more effective than the existing care, especially given 
the additional expertise and financial costs that EMDR 
therapy  requires.  A  second  limitation  of  the  present 
study was the high dropout rate. Although this study 
included 52 participants, only 36 completed all assess-
ments, resulting in a drop-out rate of 31%. This rate is 
comparable to those in other early intervention studies 
with rape victims (Miller, Cranston, Davis, Newman, 
&  Resnick,  2015;  Nixon  et  al.,  2016;  Resnick  et  al., 
2007),  and  may  be  related  to  avoidant  coping  beha-
viour.  Yet,  high  drop-out  rates  are  likely  to  cause 
attrition bias. However, in the present study, the data 
were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Also, the 

non-completers analysis found no difference between 
completers and dropouts in age, relationship to perpe-
trator, posttraumatic stress symptoms or general psy-
chopathology. Therefore, we can assume that attrition 
bias is minimalized. Still, there was insufficient power 
for  a  subsequent  completers  analysis  or  other  sub- 
sample  tests.  A  third  limitation  is  the  sample  of  the 
present study. Although the sample size is small, prior 
power analysis indicates sufficient power for the ana-
lyses. However, the sample is mainly female, making it 
difficult to generalize the results in other genders. Yet, 
there is currently no evidence to suggest gender differ-
ences  in  the  psychological  care  needs  of  rape  victims 
(Covers, Teeuwen, & Bicanic, 2020).

We  recommend  that  future  research  focus  on  the 
efficacy  of  watchful  waiting  as  early  intervention  after 
rape, as it is more cost-effective than EMDR and equally 
effective  in  reducing  post-traumatic  psychopathology. 
In  their  study  on  brief  cognitive-behavioural  therapy 
(B-CBT)  as  early  intervention  after  assault,  Foa, 
Zoellner, and Feeny (2006) found no difference in post- 
traumatic  stress  symptoms  at  three  months  post- 
trauma between those who received B-CBT, supportive 
counselling,  or  no  treatment.  Although  this  study  did 
not  differentiate  between  victims  of  sexual  and  non- 
sexual assault, its results suggest that there is no added 
value  in  supportive  counselling  over  no  treatment. 
However, in contrast to watchful waiting, their suppor-
tive  counselling  protocol  refrained  from  discussing 
trauma-related  symptoms  nor  the  processing  of  the 
traumatic event  with the victims (Foa  et al.,  2006). As 
inadequate  processing  of  information  regarding  the 
traumatic event is seen as the cause of PTSD (Ehlers & 
Clark, 2000), adding elements to the protocol in support 
of  adequate  processing  might  result  in  different  out-
comes.  Additionally,  research  suggests  that  psycho- 
education  about  trauma-related  symptoms  can  reduce 
the development of these symptoms (Miller et al., 2015).
In conclusion, the present study found early interven-
tion  with  EMDR  therapy  to  be  no  more  effective  than 
watchful  waiting  for  psychological  problems,  including 
post-traumatic stress symptoms, in victims of rape. Due 
to  its  cost-effectiveness,  the  present  study  supports  the 
current guidelines that recommend watchful waiting for 
sexual  assault  victims  (NICE,  2018)  which  entails  that 
psychological symptoms are monitored, and psychoedu-
cation and support are provided during the first month 
post-rape.
