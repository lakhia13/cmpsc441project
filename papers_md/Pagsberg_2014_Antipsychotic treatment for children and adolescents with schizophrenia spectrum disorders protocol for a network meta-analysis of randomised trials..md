ABSTRACT
Introduction: Antipsychotic treatment in early-onset
schizophrenia (EOS) lacks a rich evidence base, and
efforts to rank different drugs concerning their efficacy
have not proven any particular drug superior. In
contrast to the literature regarding adult-onset
schizophrenia (AOS), comparative effectiveness studies
in children and adolescents are limited in number and
size, and only a few meta-analyses based on
conventional methodologies have been conducted.
Methods and analyses: We will conduct a network
meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) that evaluate antipsychotic therapies for EOS to
determine which compounds are efficacious, and to
determine the relative efficacy and safety of these
treatments when compared in a network meta-analysis.
Unlike a contrast-based (standard) meta-analysis
approach, an arm-based network meta-analysis enables
statistical inference from combining both direct and
indirect comparisons within an empirical Bayes
framework. We will acquire eligible studies through a
systematic search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central
Registry of Controlled Trials, Clinicaltrials.gov and
Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases.
Eligible studies should randomly allocate children and
adolescents presenting with schizophrenia or a related
non-affective psychotic condition to an intervention
group or to a control group. Two reviewers will—
independently and in duplicate—screen titles and
abstracts, complete full text reviews to determine
eligibility, and subsequently perform data abstraction
and assess risk of bias of eligible trials. We will
conduct meta-analyses to establish the effect of all
reported therapies on patient-relevant efficacy and
safety outcomes when possible.
Ethics and dissemination: No formal ethical
procedures regarding informed consent are required as
no primary data collection is undertaken. The review
will help facilitate evidence-based management, identify
key areas for future research, and provide a framework
for conducting large systematic reviews combining
direct and indirect comparisons. The study will be
disseminated by peer-reviewed publication and
conference presentation.
Trial registration number: PROSPERO

Strengths and limitations of this study

▪ Our study’s strengths include clinical expertise in
child, adolescent and adult psychiatry, including
psychopharmacology.

▪ The content experts in the group have extensive
knowledge of the literature and experience with
prescribing antipsychotic treatment.

▪ The methodologists in the group are members
of the GRADE Working Group, and have experi-
ence with conducting and reporting randomised
clinical
trials, systematic reviews and meta-
analyses.

▪ A possible and anticipated weakness may be the
quantity and quality of the trials we identify.

INTRODUCTION
Description of the condition
Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) with onset
before age 18 is clinically continuous with

schizophrenia
adult-onset
Accordingly,
in children and adolescents
schizophrenia is deﬁned by the same diagnos-
tic criteria as in adults. EOS is relatively rare,
but the prevalence rises through adolescence.
The onset before age 12 comprises less than
from age 12–18 constitutes
1%, and onset
about 12–33% of all adult cases of schizophre-
nia.3 4 A more pronounced deviation of central
nervous system and behavioural developmental
trajectories found in children who later as
youth develop schizophrenia5 compared to
children with onset delayed until adulthood,
may be a prognostic factor that to some degree
explains the less-favourable outcome and prog-
nosis in EOS.6

Even though treatment with antipsychotic
drugs is a well-established intervention in
EOS, the evidence for their efﬁcacy and tol-
erability is scarce compared to the adult
ﬁeld.7 8 From the available evidence, anti-
psychotic treatment is efﬁcacious in children
and adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum

disorders, but complicated by a reduced treatment
response and a more severe proﬁle of adverse events
(AEs) compared to adults.7 9 As in adults, treatment
resistance in EOS can be treated with clozapine, which
appears efﬁcacious and relatively safe in children and
adolescents when closely monitored.10

Description of the interventions
First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) are primarily char-
acterised by antidopaminergic properties at dopamine
D2 receptors and were ﬁrst available during the 1950s.
The early second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) cloza-
pine was launched in 1971–1975 (withdrawn due to early
fatal cases of agranulocytosis and reintroduced in 1989),
followed by several new SGAs since the 1990s. SGAs are
also characterised by antidopaminergic properties at
dopamine D2 receptors, but in addition have potent anti-
serotonergic actions.11 Furthermore, some low-potency
FGAs and most SGAs have noradrenergic, histaminergic
and cholinergic receptor blocking activities.12 13 One
SGA, aripiprazole, has a unique pharmacological proﬁle,
as it is a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor.14

Evidence of a lower risk of extrapyramidal adverse
events (EPS) with SGAs compared to FGAs has led to an
increase in the prescription of SGAs in children and
adolescents.15 The lower EPS risk, however, needs to be
balanced against a growing evidence for serious risks of
metabolic side effects with many SGAs, indicating less-
convincing overall
superior tolerability compared to
FGAs, especially in children and adolescents who seem
to be more prone than adults to weight gain, dyslipidae-
mia and diabetogenic side effects (ie, side effects that in
the long term can cause serious health problems for
these patients16).

In spite of rapidly growing antipsychotic prescription
rates for young patients in many countries,17–19 most anti-
psychotic medications have not been speciﬁcally
approved to treat EOS, mainly because such medications
have not been thoroughly tested in the young. In Europe,
until recently just one compound—aripiprazole—was
approved for the use in adolescent schizophrenia, and
only in June 2014 another antipsychotic, paliperidone,
was approved for the same indication (http://www.ema.
europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_
Product_Information/human/000746/WC500034925.
pdf ). However, both drugs are approved by the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of EOS only
from ages 15–17, while in the US, ﬁve SGAs (ie, aripipra-
zole, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone and quetia-
pine) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of EOS patients aged 13
through 17. Finally, seven FGAs (chlorpromazine, loxa-
triﬂuo-
thiothixene,
pine, perphenazine,
perazine and haloperidol) are FDA approved for
paediatric patients of different ages below age 12 and for
ages 12 and above, but none of these approvals would
withstand modern criteria of positive, well-powered and
well-conducted randomised, placebo-controlled trials.

thioridazine,

Consequently, antipsychotics are often used off-label in
children and adolescents.19 20 Off-label use (ie, medica-
tion used to treat a condition or age group not speciﬁc-
ally listed in its prescribing label) is a common and legal
practice.

This systematic review and meta-analysis will focus on
antipsychotics that have been investigated in randomised
clinical trials (RCTs) for the treatment of EOS spectrum
disorders.

Why it is important to do this review
Recent efforts to evaluate and compare the efﬁcacy and
AEs of different antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of
EOS have been performed in ﬁve meta-analyses with con-
ventional methodologies.21–24 Of 9 active comparator
RCTs and 13 placebo-controlled RCTs,
the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
Guidelines 2013 rated the general evidence for anti-
psychotic treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia in
young people low to very low and found only minimal dif-
ferences in efﬁcacy among the compounds (not includ-
ing clozapine), but relatively large differences in AEs
proﬁles.21
et al22
meta-analysed six active comparator RCTs in children
with onset of schizophrenia from age 0 through 12 years,
revealing only scant evidence regarding the effects of
antipsychotic medication. However, some beneﬁts were
identiﬁed with the SGA clozapine compared with the
FGA haloperidol for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
Yet, these beneﬁts were offset by an increased risk of
serious adverse effects. Another Cochrane review of the
use of SGAs for psychosis in adolescents aged 13–16 years
(N=13 RCTs, n=1112 participants) concluded that SGAs
are not superior to FGAs, but SGAs may be more accept-
able to young people because fewer symptomatic AEs are
seen in the short term.25 In a meta-analysis of three
RCTs, Ardizzone et al23 could not demonstrate any super-
iority among the SGAs risperidone, olanzapine and aripi-
prazole concerning efﬁcacy or all-cause discontinuation.
However, aripiprazole had the lowest incidence of neuro-
motor AEs and weight gain. In another meta-analysis of
ﬁve RCTS covering patients aged 5 through 18 years with
EOS, the response rate for FGA treatment was reported
to be signiﬁcantly higher and the risk of weight gain sig-
niﬁcantly lower compared to SGA treatment.24 Of note,
this work included older studies with patients diagnosed
with childhood schizophrenia in which populations of
schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders were
mixed together.

Meta-analysis is the statistical technique used to synthe-
sise evidence from experiments addressing the same
research question (ie, PICO framework: patient/popula-
intervention, comparison, outcomes). It is often

comparing only two alternatives. However, decision-
makers and clinicians need to know the relative ranking
of a set of alternative options and not only whether
option I is better than C. The statistical methodology
applied to synthesise information over a complex
network of comparisons involving all alternative treat-
ment options for the same condition is called ‘Network
Meta-Analysis’.

Network meta-analyses allow a uniﬁed, coherent ana-
lysis of all RCTs that compare antipsychotic treatments in
children with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, while
fully respecting randomisation within the included trials.
This methodology is especially relevant, as the aforemen-
tioned meta-analyses were inconclusive or even somewhat
contradictory and because head-to-head trials of different
antipsychotic treatments are either scarce or comprise a
small number of patients. In this situation, a multiple
treatment or network meta-analysis can to some extent
overcome the limitations of small samples with limited
power to examine comparative efﬁcacy and safety across
commonly used antipsychotics. Moreover,
such a
meta-analysis will allow efﬁcacy and safety/tolerability
ranking of medications by taking advantage of the mea-
sured differences versus common comparators, even if
the medications are not or only insufﬁciently compared
head to head.26 27 Although network meta-analyses are
based on the assumption that trial designs and popula-
tions are comparable across time, sensitivity and sub-
group analyses can help to test these assumptions and
minimise potential cohort effects.28

OBJECTIVES
To comprehensively explore the efﬁcacy and tolerability
of all antipsychotic therapies tested in RCTs for children
and adolescents with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders
using a network meta-analysis that takes into account
both direct and indirect comparisons.

METHODS
This protocol prespeciﬁes the objectives and methods of
the systematic review.

The protocol speciﬁes outcomes of major interest,
and explain how we will extract and use the information
about those outcomes quantitatively. We anticipate that
the ﬁnal meta-analysis developed according to this
protocol will appear transparent, and restrict the likeli-
hood of reviewers biased interpretation.

Eligibility criteria
1. Studies must be RCTs that examine the administra-
tion of an antipsychotic treatment compared with
placebo or another antipsychotic drug for children
and adolescents aged 0 through 19 with schizophre-
nia spectrum disorders (not including affective psych-
oses, see no 3 below). Per deﬁnition, EOS refers to
patients with onset of
illness before age 18 years.
However, it is well known that several clinical studies
of EOS include patients aged 0 through 19, because
the cohorts are investigated within the ﬁrst couple of
years after onset, that is, many patients have onset at
age 17 but are not

restrict studies from any geographic area, except for
exclusion of trials conducted in China due to concerns
about the validity of such randomised trial data.33 Such
concerns include lack of ability to verify true random-

ducted,
hospitalisation without follow-up beyond discharge and
frequent lack of any dropouts. Owing to such concerns,
for example, the recent, most comprehensive network
meta-analysis of acute RCTs of antipsychotics in adults
with schizophrenia published in Lancet8 excluded a
priori all Chinese RCTs. In order to allow better com-
parability between out meta-analysis of the same trials
in youth, we will follow the same methodology and
exclude RCTs originating from China.

3. For a study to be eligible, explicit reference to the diag-
nostic criteria deﬁning schizophrenia spectrum disor-
ders is needed. All patients should fulﬁl diagnostic
criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders according
to validated diagnostic manuals/classiﬁcations: either
presently Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5)34
schizophreniform disorder
(schizophrenia (295.90),
(295.40), schizoaffective disorder (295.70), delusional
disorders (297.1), other schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorder (298.8), unspeciﬁed schizo-
phrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (298.9)
or International Classiﬁcation of Diseases 10 (ICD-10)35
(schizophrenia (F20), persistent delusional disorders
(F22), acute and transient psychotic disorders (F23),
induced delusional disorder (F24), schizoaffective disor-
ders (F25), other non-organic psychotic disorders (F28),
Unspeciﬁed non-organic psychosis (F29)) or subsidiary
correlating diagnoses according to earlier DSM/ICD
revisions or other validated diagnostic classiﬁcations.
We allow for trials including schizophrenia spectrum dis-
orders according to diagnostic manual versions from
DSM-336 and ICD-937 or later because only after 1980
these major diagnostic classiﬁcation systems endorsed
the practice of using the same criteria to diagnose
schizophrenia in children and adults. Prior to that time,

apply. Further, we will record whether the RCT was a
single-centre or a multicentre trial (deﬁned as ≥2 differ-
ent centres) and the number of centres involved. We will
record whether RCTs were open-label, single-blinded or
double-blinded. First/corresponding authors from trial
reports and/or antipsychotic drug manufacturers will be
contacted for missing data.

As major outcomes (table 1) we will assess (1) the mean
overall change in symptoms, according to the following
hierarchy: change in Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale (PANSS)38 total score from baseline, if not available,
then the change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
(BPRS)39 total score, and then values of these scales at
study end point, all based on the intention-to-treat (ITT)
population whenever available; (2) the mean change in
positive symptoms, according to the hierarchy PANSS posi-

number of EPS AEs or number of patients treated with
antiparkinsonian drugs; (6) frequency of akathisia; and
(7) mean change in blood level of triglycerides. As minor
outcomes (table 1), we will assess (1) whether a treatment
response rate of at least 30% reduction from baseline in
total PANSS or BPRS scores, or a score of ‘much improved’
‘very much improved’ on the Clinical Global
or
Impressions Scale (CGI) improvement (CGI-I) score41 was
achieved (these will be the prespeciﬁed cut-off thresholds
for response,42 but when the above thresholds are not

included as a proxy for patient-relevant adverse effects,
anticipating that they will reﬂect the ultimate decision of
the participant and/or physician to discontinue treat-

sumably according to the deﬁnition by the International

Risk of bias in individual studies
The risk of bias within each RCT will be assessed using
the domains of the risk of bias tool, as recommended by
the Cochrane Collaboration.52 The following issues will
be investigated: Methods for sequence generation and
maintaining allocation concealment, blinding,
incom-
plete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.
Each domain is rated as low, high or unclear risk of bias;
each RCT will subsequently be assigned an overall risk of
bias in terms of low risk (low for all key domains), high
risk (high for ≥1 key domains), and unclear risk
(unclear for ≥1 key domains53).

treatment,
meta-analyses will be conducted separately for RCTs in
of
treatment-resistant
non-treatment-resistant patients. For continuous out-
comes, we will analyse the results as the standardised
mean difference (SMD). The SMD is used as a summary
effect size, anticipating the studies all assess the same
outcome, (ie, construct), but measure it in a variety of
ways.54 We will use the number of patients who
responded, the number of patients who dropped out due
to AEs, the number of patients who dropped out due to
any causes, the number of patients who had a SAE, the
number of patients who had an AE and the number of
patients who are categorised according to the selected
AE types above. For the dichotomous data, we will calcu-
late ORs with 95% (95% CIs) for each study.

The contrast-based meta-analysis of data will be per-
formed by applying random-effect models by default in
order to accommodate the anticipated heterogeneity
among study results. All data will be entered into Review
Manager V.5.2 software, provided by the Cochrane
Collaboration (http://ims.cochrane.org/revman). We
will apply the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects
throughout.55 In addition to reviewing forest
model
plots, we will statistically analyse heterogeneity of the
data using the Cochran’s Q test56 and evaluate via the I2
index for inconsistency, which can be interpreted as the
percentage of total variation across several studies.57 An
I2 value greater than 50% may indicate substantial het-
erogeneity. We will use the χ2 test for heterogeneity
when appropriate for the direct analyses.

conduct a network meta-analysis and combine both
direct and indirect comparisons.27 For continuous out-
comes, we will summarise data from each arm as the
mean change from baseline (ΔSymptoms), assuming a
normal likelihood with a corresponding SE in analogy to
a paired t test. We will standardise these results by using
the pooled SD for the change across arms within each
study (=ΔSymptoms/SD). Following this approach, we
will be able to estimate a standardised mean change
(SMC) for each arm in any given study. When we subse-
quently subtract any given intervention SMC value—for
instance, from the SMC for the combined placebo arms
—this estimate is interpretable as the SMD.58 The statis-
tical model uses a random-effects approach, based on
the single-effect model as described by Welton et al.59 In
this model, all variances corresponding to the different
interventions in each trial are grouped together as a
single variance in each trial.

random-effects meta-regression models61 will be used for
tests of interaction between the main treatment effect and

these characteristics. Further, for the purpose of sensitivity,
we will also perform stratiﬁed analyses according to the
risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of
the critical domains (ie, selection bias, performance bias,
detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias) in order to
derive p values for interaction between trial characteristics
and treatment effect.

are required. Using data from randomised trials, this study
will evaluate different antipsychotic therapies for children
and adolescents aged 0 through 19 years with schizophre-
nia spectrum disorders. Our goal
is to help clinicians
make evidence-based decisions and help guideline develo-
pers with an updated evidence synthesis, which will enable
a comprehensive interpretation of the data for beneﬁt and
harm. Our review will present data for all antipsychotic
treatments, provide relative estimates of effectiveness and
tolerability and evaluate the quality of the evidence in a
thorough and consistent manner using the GRADE
approach.62 The review will help facilitate evidence-based
management, identify key areas for future research, and
help provide a framework for conducting large systematic
reviews combining direct and indirect comparisons.

Potential limitations of the network meta-analysis of trials
on antipsychotic treatment for children and adolescents with
schizophrenia spectrum disorders should be mentioned. If
the review neglect to determine the quality of the overall
network meta-analysis so that the reader cannot determine if
the evidence provides strong inferences it will be considered
a major limitation. In order to address this, the following
aspects will be considered: (1) whether the individual studies
are at low risk of bias and publication bias is unlikely; (2)
results are consistent in individual direct comparisons and
individual comparisons with no-treatment controls and are
consistent between direct and indirect comparisons; (3)
sample size is large and CIs are correspondingly narrow; and
(4) evidence includes direct comparisons.

Dr AKP will draft the paper describing the results of
the systematic review and meta-analysis, which will be dis-
seminated by peer-review publication and conference
presentation.
