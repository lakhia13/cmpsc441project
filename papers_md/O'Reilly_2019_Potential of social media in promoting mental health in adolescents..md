Summary

The growing prevalence of adolescent mental disorders poses signiﬁcant challenges for education
and healthcare systems globally. Providers are therefore keen to identify effective ways of promoting
positive mental health. This aim of this qualitative study was to explore perceptions that social media
might be leveraged for the purposes of mental health promotion amongst adolescents aged between
11 and 18 years. Utilizing focus groups conducted with adolescents (N ¼ 54), educational professionals
(N ¼ 16) and mental health practitioners (N ¼ 8). We explored their views about the value of social
media for this purpose. Three themes were identiﬁed. First, social media appears to have potential to
promote positive mental health. Second, adolescents frequently utilize social media and the internet
to seek information about mental health. Finally, there are beneﬁts and challenges to using social me-
dia in this way. We conclude that despite challenges of using social media and the risks, social media
does offer a useful way of educating and reaching adolescents to promote mental wellbeing.

Key words: adolescents, mental health, promotion, social media

INTRODUCTION

Globally between 10 and 20% of adolescents experience
a mental disorder (Kieling et al., 2011). Policymakers and
practitioners have expressed concern at the increasing
prevalence of anxiety, depression and self-harm within
UK schools (Key, 2017), a position mirrored internation-
ally. For example, Polanczyk et al. (Polanczyk et al.,
2015) conducted a systematic review of 41 studies (27
countries) showing worldwide prevalence at 13.4%. In
the USA, (cid:2)40% of participants with one class of disorder
also meet the criteria for another class of lifetime disorder
(Merikangas et al., 2010). Undoubtedly poor mental

health outcomes are undesirable, thus preventative ac-
tion, early intervention and multi-agency approaches are
needed (Department of Health [DoH], 2015).

Promotion of positive mental health and prevention
of ill health is important to address this problem. The
World Health Organization (WHO, 2016) defined pro-
motion in relation to the actions needed to create envi-
ronments that provide people with skills to maintain
‘mentally healthy’
lifestyles. This is because mental
health is not simply the absence of mental illness; but a
state of wellbeing that allows people to contribute pro-

necessitates strategies designed to reduce the incidence,
prevalence and recurrence of mental disorders (WHO,
2016). Although promotion and prevention overlap, the
former focuses on ‘positive mental health’, i.e. keeping
people mentally healthy, while the latter concentrates on
‘mental ill health’, i.e. avoiding illness (Kalra et al.,
2012).

Strategies to promote positive adolescent mental
health include, early interventions, targeting vulnerable
groups, community development programmes and anti-
stigma campaigns (Dogra et al., 2017). Schools play a
central role, providing a systematic way for targeting ado-
lescents in a location where they spend considerable time
(Sturgeon, 2006). This environment provides a useful
platform for promoting mental health (Jane`-Llopis and
Barry, 2005) and school-based programmes have in-
cluded improving awareness and reducing stigmatization
(Mellor, 2014). In these programmes, an inclusive ap-
proach is essential—one that involves school personnel
and efforts that are sensitive to developmental factors
and population diversity (Weist and Murray, 2008).

Adolescents also spend significant time on social me-
dia, defined here as the ‘web-based services that allow
individuals, communities, and organizations to collabo-
rate, connect, interact, and build community by enabling
them to create, co-create, modifies, share, and engage
with user-generated content that is easily accessible’
[(McCay-Peet and Quan-Haase, 2017), p. 17]. Platforms
such as Facebook and Twitter have been linked to new
forms of political participation amongst adolescents in
countries such as the UK, US and Australia; even those
that are not politically engaged there appears to be an
openness to engage with politicians and celebrities on
these sites (Xenos et al., 2014; Vromen, 2017). Despite
moral panic discourses that have emerged in relation to
online threats, such as online sex predators, cyber-crime
and online radicalization, networked teens continually
express frustration at the assumptions made by adults
that they are irresponsible with the information and con-
tent they share on these sites (boyd, 2014). Indeed,
young people appear to develop new strategies in re-
sponse to the flattening of multiple audiences on social
media and the blurring of the boundaries between pri-
vate and public (Marwick and boyd, 2014).

This presents new opportunities and challenges for
mental health promotion. Yet, the potential for positive
impact, such as health promotion has received limited
attention (Neiger et al., 2012). Technology is widely
used, with over 90% of adolescents using social media
regularly (Duggan and Smith, 2013). Social media has
an information-dimension, media-related dimension and
social-dimension (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010), and can

facilitate adolescents’ technical skills, social connection
and communication (Ito et al., 2008); not least because
much of their social and emotional development is hap-
pening digitally (O’Keeffe and Clarke-Pearson, 2011).

Traditionally, social media have been used by adoles-
cents to increase social connectivity, broaden social rela-
tionships and for entertainment (Allen et al., 2014). Yet,
social media is a potentially inexpensive way to have
conversations about mental health, impart information
and challenge stigma (Betton et al., 2015). Furthermore,
information on social media can be tailored for the pri-
orities of intended users, due to its versatility (Hamm
et al., 2015). Indeed, social media is starting to be em-
braced for physical health promotion (Fergie et al.,
2016a), to promote help-seeking for mental health diffi-
culties (Burns et al., 2009) and could be used for univer-
sal mental health promotion (O’Reilly et al., 2018).
Limited research in mental health promotion with young
adults has shown that social media is viewed positively
as a resource (Fergie et al., 2016b), can reduce stigma
(Burns et al., 2009) and encourages social networking,
reducing isolation (Gowen et al., 2012). However, there
are risks of reliability and thus more research is needed
(Moorhead et al., 2013) if it is to be used in this way.

For adolescents, this is especially important, as they
are often exposed to online media from a young age and
can lack skills to critically assess information credibility
(Eastin et al., 2006). Using social media as a learning plat-
form needs further evaluation for a better understanding
of adolescents’ preferences (Bone et al., 2015) and how
they engage with information online (Fergie et al.,
2016a,b). This is especially important as research into ad-
olescent social media use ‘is still in its infancy’ [(Allen
et al., 2014), p. 21]. The aim of this study therefore was
to examine the potential of social media for mental health
promotion from the perspective of key stakeholders, ex-
ploring their opinions on how social media can be used
effectively, their creative ideas for how it might be imple-
mented, and the possible limitations to this approach.
The research question was ‘what are the perspectives of
key stakeholders about the extent to which social media
can play a role in mental health promotion?’

METHODS

A qualitative design was adopted as this was congruent
with the exploratory character of the research question.

Data collection and sampling
Participants were recruited from London and Leicester
(UK) through 2016, and focus groups were conducted

separately with different groups, which included 6
groups (6-12 participants in each) with adolescents,
11–18 years (N ¼ 54), 2 with mental health practitioners
(N ¼ 8) and 2 with educational professionals (N ¼ 16).
Demographic details can be found in Tables 1 and 2.
Focus groups were conducted as this method allows par-
ticipants to share ideas and engage with the contribu-
tions made by different parties (Willig, 2008). The focus
group schedule was organized round three core issues
that reflected the scope of the main project, including
conceptualizations of mental health/illness, opinions and
experiences of social media, and the potential of social
media as a source of mental health promotion. Sampling
adequacy was achieved through the process of satura-
tion (Hancock et al., 2016), which was congruent with
the approach (O’Reilly and Parker, 2013). The satura-
tion point was determined via the ‘stopping criterion’;
the point at which no new ideas emerged within or
across groups (Francis et al., 2010).

Analysis
Thematic analysis was utilized because of its data-driven
strategy and meaning-making focus (Braun and Clarke,
2006). This allows the identification of salient issues
from the perspective of participants (Boyatzis, 1998),
which is essential for areas with only a limited evidence-
base. Three team members engaged in coding (Boyatzis,
1998), mapped to create a final framework. This led to
a
broadly
conceptualized as 10 superordinate themes. These super-
ordinate themes were the very broad overarching themes
from the whole project data corpus, reflecting that cod-
ing was complete, not selective. Each had more specific
themes within those broad issues identified, and these
specific themes were generated from thematizing the
the themes identified
122 second-order codes. Thus,

superordinate issues to guide dissemination. This paper
reports on the single overarching issue of mental health
promotion and the three themes related to that.

Ethics
The research was governed by the University of
Leicester Research Ethics Committee, who approved the
study. Informed consent was obtained from all parties,
and for those aged 15 years and under, parental consent
was acquired first. All transcripts were anonymized. In
our use of quotations, we identify participants by the
school year group with their ages outlined in Table 3.

FINDINGS

Most participants were cautious about using social me-
dia to promote mental health due to their belief that so-
cial media contributes to mental illness (O’Reilly et al.,
in press). Nonetheless, they did argue that there was po-
tential if done well. Three key themes were identified: (i)
the role social media can play for mental health promo-
tion; (ii) adolescents’ use of social media and (iii) bene-
fits and challenges of using social media to promote
mental health.

Theme one: the role social media can play for
mental health promotion
Reflecting on the potential of social media, participants
discussed this source of information to maintain positive
mental health and to help them cope with stress.
Furthermore, they considered how social media, and in-
ternet sources, might support and educate about mental

illness, citing examples of when they had used it in this
way for their own conditions, or those of their peers.

Although adolescents commented on the negative
effects of social media, they could see that this channel pro-
vided ‘amazing opportunities’ for promoting mental health.
They reported that social media focused their attention on
certain issues pertaining to mental health information.

promote wellbeing, but also learn about mental illness.
Thus, promotion could be achieved in a way that was
fast and had great geographical spread.

5. But I think that way social media can be helpful be-
cause you could do like videos and get messages out
there quickly to teach like young people what not to do.
(P4—CAMHS group 2)

1. I think there’s some like forms of social media that
you really can use in productive way like, um, like I’ve
got a blog and I’ve also got like a Tumblr blog as well.
And like I think, the same with Instagram really, some
people have got like amazing opportunities through
these websites.

(P5—Leicester year-group 13)

Here P4 implies that the speed of information flow
across social media platforms is beneficial in the context
of mental health promotion. They felt that social media
was ‘helpful’ to spread messages about mental health
‘quickly’ which can help educate adolescents about pro-
tecting their mental wellbeing.

2. You might get an idea from social media and search
for something.

(P2—London year-group 9)

Adolescents reported social media could be used produc-
tively in learning about issues that might impact on their
mental health. Citing specific forms such as Instagram,
they reported that opportunities for learning about those
issues can be achieved by engaging with ‘websites’
(meaning social media). For example, there were sugges-
tions that embracing the culture of social media ‘chal-
lenges’, could be harnessed to promote wellbeing.

3. It’s like ‘hundred-happy-day’ challenge it started few
years ago, that’s more pitched at adults, something simi-
lar that can be done for the students . . . So the idea
was every day you took a photo about what made you
happy . . . all kids would do that.

(P8—London education)

It was recognized that ‘challenges’ are commonly dis-
tributed on social media, and adolescents frequently be-
come engaged in these. Citing the ‘hundred-happy-day’
challenge, P8 argued this could be a strategy used to en-
gage them in promoting wellbeing.

They also argued that social media itself may pro-
mote ideas and thought-provoking material that encour-
ages adolescents to seek out further information that
promotes positive mental health. A good example of
this, was acknowledging the role of celebrity culture.

4. Zoella did her anxiety video, didn’t she? And I think
that helped a few girls like thinking, oh it’s not just me
that’s like that.

(P1—Leicester year-group 13)

The negative influence of celebrity culture on adoles-
cents is well-known but if redeployed may facilitate
mental health promotion. Participants acknowledged ce-
lebrity culture could be used in a positive way to

6. I think, yeah, social media’s actually a great way to
support people.

(P10-Leicester year-group 13)

7. like you’re using a hash tag as a therapy is and loads
of people will then follow and like and support and
they’ll post pictures of like what they’ve been eating, or
how they’re coping with different things and I think that
creates a community which is supportive.

(P3—Leicester education)

While the adolescent (P10) here talked generally about
social media providing a source of support in the context
of stress, and the teacher (P3) more specifically referred
to those with diagnosed disorders, both acknowledged
the role it can play in supporting individuals. Indeed, it
was argued that social media has potential to create ‘a
community which is supportive’. The implication is that
likeminded adolescents can help each other. Indeed, ado-
lescents argued that social media can promote positive
mental health. For example, adolescents cited some bene-
fits, as they acknowledged that using channels, such as
YouTube, could promote relaxation and help them to
cope with pressures of education.

8. I usually like to go on YouTube, like it relaxes me.

(P2—London year-group 9)

9. I think it [social media] just sometimes relieves the
stress for some people.

(P6—London year-group 8)

Furthermore, there was scope for using social media,
and the internet, to seek information to promote their
personal positive mental health, or educate them about
mental illness.

10. Generally, I use Google or those websites but some-
times I use texting WhatsApp and ask a friend.

(P8—London year-group 9)

11. I’ve learned through mental illness, mental health
through social media like I found an interview with a
documentary maker like Louis Theroux and he made
some documentaries about autism and I then searched
because I didn’t know much about autism.

(P5—Leicester year-group 13)

This demonstrates how adolescents mix sources of infor-
mation, using different platforms for different purposes.
For example, they may ‘use Google’ for information-
searching, but ‘WhatsApp’ for communication. Thus,
they already used social media to find out more about
mental health and illness, inspired from watching docu-
mentaries, and then using this for seeking further guid-
ance from the internet. However,

Despite acknowledging that adolescents regularly use
social media for information-seeking, participants sug-
gested it is ‘massively under-used’ for this purpose.
Furthermore, they recognized there was a need to pro-
ceed with caution as excessive social media use may im-
pact negatively on mental health, thus counteracting any
positive effect.

Theme two: young people’s use of social media
If we are to consider the value of social media as a men-
be
tal
contextualized against wider use of social media and the
pressures adolescents face. Adolescents are arguably un-
der increasing stress, and while there are potential risks
associated with social media, it could support their cop-
ing. Social media appeared to both reinforce and provide
release from stress and was often cited as a relaxation
method. Any discussion of mental health promotion via
social media, therefore needs to be considered against
the backdrop of the modern construction of children
and childhood, recognizing the changing views of ado-
lescents and the position they occupy in society.

14. You have too much pressure.

(P7—London year-group 9)

It was argued by participants that the changing landscape
of education and the different ways in which children are
positioned in society has put a greater pressure on adoles-
cents. Consequently, they find the pressure difficult to
cope with. Notably, while meeting academic targets mean
that young people’s mental wellbeing is put at risk, they
also reported that some pressure comes from participating
with social media itself. In other words, there was peer
pressure to engage with social media.

15. . . . and if you don’t follow that certain way you are
seen as like an outsider or like, just someone weird.

(P2—London year-group 11)

16. You can’t just turn off your phone and leave it, cos
like the two worlds are so like intertwined that if you’re
not, you’re almost like a weird outcast.

(P4—Leicester year-group 13)

The blurring of online and offline worlds was considered
central to their lives. They reported social media formed a
core feature of their identity and peer relationships, as with-
out this they would be viewed as an ‘outsider’ or ‘weird out-
cast’. This was exacerbated by the connectivity enabled by
smart phones, as they felt they could not turn off the phone,
to stay connected.
suggesting an implicit pressure
Consequently, for some this created a certain dependency.

17. Yeah, I think I’m pretty dependent on social media.

(P5—Leicester year-group 11)

This reliance was viewed as having some detrimental im-
pact on mental health, and was viewed as a risk to well-
being by both adolescents and professionals.

18. Social media can fuel cyber-bulling and that could
lead to problems like suicide, anger and depression.

19. I think sometimes social media can be the thing
that’s causing not helping with their mental health.

Such statements reflect the dilemma of social media as a

tive
with social media use, it was also regarded as a positive
environment, and it is this that could be exploited to ed-
ucate adolescents in strategies to protect their mental
health as well as inform them about mental disorders.

Theme three: benefits and challenges of social
media to promote mental health
Given the time adolescents spend using social media and
the use to facilitate relaxation and reduce stress, it is

986

M. O’Reilly et al.

important to better understand the possible benefits and
challenges of using social media to promote mental
health. For any mental health promotion tool/interven-
tion to be developed it is essential key stakeholders’ ad-
vice shapes the ways in which this applied. Participants,
therefore, provided ideas for how such tools could be
made accessible, while recognizing the challenges of do-
ing so.

A benefit of using social media to promote mental
health was the possibility of anonymity. Participants
recognized that mental
illness was associated with
stigma, and argued that promoting positive mental
health needed to mitigate against this.

20. And I think a lot of people feel like if they speak out
about their mental health they might get judged for it.

(P2—London year-group 11)

21. I think it’s quite a taboo subject between friends,
you don’t really want to, if you’ve got a problem you
feel quite ostracised and quite isolated about it.

(P4—Leicester year-group 11)

Thus, anonymity was positioned as a useful way of cir-
cumnavigating the embarrassment or judgment associ-
ated with mental illness, with social media presented as
one method.

22. Social media is fantastic because you’re anonymous,
okay? So, you’ve got a mental health issue that you
don’t want to discuss with anyone at school, you can be-
come anonymous.

(P4—Leicester education)

23. I think some social media platforms are better than
others because, like, say on some you could have like an
anonymous question, answer sort of thing

important.

for children remaining anonymous

is

(P2—CAMHS group 1)

The adolescents repeatedly highlighted that anonymity
afforded by social media was a useful way for them to
learn about and discuss mental health concerns.
Anonymity was important, hence social media was
viewed as ‘fantastic’ because they could seek informa-
tion and ask questions anonymously about issues affect-
ing them. Indeed, this anonymity was something several
adolescents acknowledged they had taken advantage of.

because that’s just, I just find that awkward talking to
someone in person, so I just did it on social media
instead.

(P5—Leicester year-group 11)

Adolescents discussed help-seeking more generally out-
side of social media acknowledging that speaking to a
doctor or family member about issues they found diffi-
cult or embarrassing could be problematic. Evidence
indicates that families, and adolescents specifically, find
help-seeking for mental health-related difficulties chal-
lenging (Vostanis et al., 2013). Our adolescents agreed,
showing social media offers an anonymous alternative
to traditional help-seeking strategies. For example, P5,
reported that s/he ‘didn’t want to go down to the doc-
tors’, and used ‘social media instead’.

Notably, while anonymity could have negative
effects, it was constructed as an important benefit of us-
ing
for mental health promotion.
Participants argued that this could also function to re-
duce the stigma associated with mental illness.

social media

26. Social media’s definitely like an amazing platform
for like advertisement. You could really like, as we were
saying that mental
illness is kind of taboo, I think
through social media there is definitely a way to get it
out of the taboo and into everyday life.

(P4—Leicester year-group 13)

However, to promote wellbeing and tackle stigma, any
mental health promotion intervention/tool used through
social media must be accessible, educational, youth-
friendly and raise awareness. Participants articulated that
mental health awareness was an important aspect of men-
tal health promotion, and felt they needed to learn about
mental illness, to appreciate positive mental health.

27. On Snapchat, they have like, um, like you click into
news articles and stuff like that and sometimes like on
big events they have stories from other people around
the world that have been sharing it, and they could, um,
do one for like mental health awareness week.

(P2—Leicester year-group 10)

28. I think if you were going to advertise the importance
of mental health on social media I don’t think it would
be good enough to just tell people the effects . . . I think
it’s about using real stories like finding people that a lot
of young people would look up to and finding about any
personal stories they’ve gone through.

(P2—Leicester year-group 11)

25. It was like, it was a few months back when I was
quite depressed and I needed to talk to someone and I
didn’t want to go down to the doctors or whatever

Adolescents argued that in raising awareness about mental
health personal stories helped them. They reported social
media was a useful advertising platform, as it provides a

mechanism for sharing these stories. Indeed, they felt social
media created an opportunity for supportive communities
between groups experiencing the same difficulties.

29. The communities on Instagram . . . cos you can get
that like, like creating groups for people with like certain
mental illnesses that could be a good thing.

(P6—Leicester year-group 13)

30. I see a lot of YouTubers that I watch that go through
mental illnesses, I think it makes people that are going
through it themselves think that they’re not alone and
that they can speak up about it and it is a normal thing
they can get treatment from. So, I think in that aspect so-
cial media can support people.

(P2—Leicester year-group 10)

Creating a supportive environment for those that experi-
illnesses was argued to be achievable
ence mental
through social media,
and
‘YouTube’. In other words, social media provided a
sense of community, to reduce isolation. Social media
was also argued to be a good source of information.

‘Instagram’

such as

31. You can provide like information like via links to
like other websites and, um, like that kind of stuff.

(P4—Leicester year-group 10)

32. Yeah, you could teach kids like cos you can show
examples of what happens.

(P5—Leicester year-group 10)

Adolescents argued that social media could educate
them about mental illness, as well as staying mentally
healthy. Furthermore, social media can provide a basis
for providing links to other sources of information on
the internet. Given the digital ways in which adolescents
prefer to learn, it was perhaps unsurprising that partici-
pants felt that visual social media—sites like YouTube,
Tumblr and Instagram—were a simple way of engaging
adolescents in learning.

33. I think that way social media can be helpful because
you could do like videos and get messages out there quickly.
(P4—CAMHS group 2)

34. Instead of spending hours and hours looking for in-
formation in books you could just like watch a video
and that would be great.

(P1—London year-group 8)

Implied in the adolescents’ narratives, was the idea that
information-searching needed to be simple and fast, and
instead of seeking information through other sources, a
simple video posted on social media was more effective.
Indeed, mental health practitioners also saw the benefit

of this as they felt that social media allows messages to
be distributed ‘quickly’.

While participants appreciated the virtues of social
media for information and promotion of mental health,
they were cautious as they outlined the risks and chal-
lenges of using it in this way. Specifically, they felt it was
important that the source was credible and trustworthy
as they argued that much was not.

35. So, the websites do actually give quite, some of them
give quite accurate information.

(P4—Leicester year-group 13)

36. I feel like some people wouldn’t trust it because it a
lot of the stuff that is based on social media is probably
not true.

(P5—leicester year-group 11)

Adolescents could assess some risks associated with
seeking support and information through social media.
They recognized therefore there was an issue of ‘trust’
when using social media in this way. Nonetheless, they
did acknowledge that some ‘websites’ are a reliable
source of knowledge. This was also an issue presented
by professionals as they felt that any social media mental
health promotion would need to be perceived as credible
and trustworthy.

37. I don’t think there’s anywhere that explains the qual-
ity of a website cos anybody can post anything. I think
one of the things that’s always interesting to me is
there’s no accountability for how you post information.

As adolescents are not always savvy in judging the credi-
bility of sources online (Eastin et al., 2006), one plausi-
ble
the
suggestion offered by participants was
involvement of schools in using social media for mental
health promotion. In other words, an integration of
school-based mental health promotion work, with a dig-
ital platform, encouraging teachers to be involved in
judging the quality of the information.

you know, alongside the campaign that would be in
schools.

(P4—London education)

Adolescents recognized they would benefit from school
personnel being involved in the search for mental health
information. They felt some direction on the issue would
be important in their use of the Internet. Similarly, edu-
cational professionals expressed that social media with-
out additional support might be insufficient, and it
would be helpful to go ‘though schools’.

DISCUSSION

Social media is often not thought of in positive ways and
because of that it can be challenging to consider how
this medium might be used to promote adolescent men-
tal health. Through our focus groups, we opened the
possibility that a digital platform that is so entrenched in
adolescents’ lives might be utilized for mental health
promotion, while recognizing some of the challenges
that this might create. While adult participants and
older adolescents were more sophisticated and cautious
in their ideas for using social media this way, there was
considerable agreement and congruence of ideas across
all groups. By listening to the voices of adolescents, edu-
cationalists and mental health practitioners, it became
clear that from their point of view social media does
have this potential. They foregrounded that perspective
on the basis that adolescents are increasingly relying on
social media as a source of information and as a tool of
relaxation.

These voices are especially important as they guide
our understanding of the key issues of implementing any
promotion strategy. This is essential, as with the increas-
ing prevalence of mental disorders, economic projec-
tions suggest that there is likely to be a huge impact on
the economy by 2026 (Knapp et al., 2011). Thus, assur-
ing the provision of a good understanding of mental
health and promoting a mentally healthy lifestyle is nec-
essary (Singletary et al., 2015). Given the extensive us-
age, social media provides a possible cost-effective way
to promote mental health (Betton et al., 2015).

In this study, participants, while cautious, generally
articulated the positive potential of using social media to
learn about and promote their mental health, and pro-
vided different ways to implement. Participants felt that
learning about mental health and illness through multi-
ple platforms was important and argued that the inter-
net as an educational tool was valuable if used carefully
and when supported by appropriate adults, such as
teachers. Participants acknowledged the extensive use of

social media by adolescents and suggested that the chal-
lenges of using this medium to promote mental health
needed to be addressed for the successful utilization of
this type of work. As adolescents are often reluctant to
seek help when experiencing symptoms, for reasons
such as stigma, mistrust in health care or lack of aware-
ness (Jorm et al., 2007), a popular alternative has been
through the internet. In contemporary society, adoles-
cents are already using the internet to learn about men-
tal
illness and to seek support when feeling angry,
stressed or sad (Gould et al., 2002). The implication is
that healthcare and educational organizations could use
social media specifically, to target adolescents in pro-
moting wellbeing, preventing mental illness and sup-
porting those with diagnosed conditions. Notably, this
would require the development of both universal and
targeted interventions.

The participants in our study offered ideas regarding
the possible benefits of using social media for universal
mental health promotion. Universal approaches are use-
ful as they target large populations of adolescents in a
general way (O’Reilly et al., 2018). Our adolescents
recognized that the relative anonymity afforded by the
internet, and by certain social media channels, allowed
adolescents to search for information and participate in
a community of supportive others, as well as learning
from celebrities. They recognized some challenges, such
as the credibility and trustworthiness of the sources of
information. Adolescents wanted quick and accessible
information and generally failed to scrutinise the quality
of that information carefully, but trustworthiness was
important to them. Notably, participants circumnavi-
gated this pitfall by proposing that mental health pro-
motion ought to be hosted through social media, but
supported by schools. In other words, they felt that inte-
grating existing school-based work on mental health
with a digital platform would provide the trustworthi-
ness required for the information but actively encourage
young people to engage. Indeed, there have been a sig-
nificant amount of universal school-based mental health
programmes in schools, yet surprisingly very little work
has embraced social media within these (see Durlak
et al., 2011; O’Reilly et al., 2018 for recent reviews).

Although there is limited evidence, existing research
has suggested that in developing mental health promotion
tools using social media, it is necessary to carefully articu-
late the key messages, account for current trends, utilise
multidimensional strategies, and provide user-generated
content (Korda and Itani, 2013). From the perspectives of
our stakeholders, we argue that we need to embrace the
digital age and the potential that new developments in
technology offer us. Social media is probably here to stay

and digital platforms have changed the lives of adoles-
cents, but we are still relatively unaware of the costs
(Pierce, 2009) or benefits. Indeed, healthcare and educa-
tion providers are in a unique position to actively utilise
these platforms to educate adolescents to promote their
wellbeing. Furthermore, by engaging educational institu-
tions actively in the use of these platforms there is a medi-
ating possibility of adult supervision that allows the
young users to be confident in the trustworthiness on two
levels; the provider and the supporter. This could be espe-
cially important, as evidence suggests that universal men-
tal health promotion needs the activities to be sequenced,
that is, coordinated and using an active form of learning
to be effective (Durlak et al., 2011). Furthermore, they re-
quire a sound theoretical base, training for delivery and a
focus on outcomes (Weare and Nind, 2011).

Importantly, the incorporation of any social media
mental health promotion tool/intervention needs to ac-
count for the practical strategies delineated by key stake-
holders. Evidently, adolescents desire quick, accessible
and anonymous ways to find out information about
mental health and mental illness, and thus platforms
that allow anonymous identities may be preferred. As
adolescents cited visual media as preferable, such as
Instagram and YouTube, this opens possibilities to tar-
get certain groups with specific developmentally appro-
priate messages. Furthermore, given the pervasive
celebrity culture, and the preference for personal stories,
there are opportunities to convey important persuasive
messages and tackle stigma through existing online nar-
ratives. Congruent with these findings and important
messages, our own future direction is to develop these
ideas further and create social media promotion tools
and explore their effectiveness.

In conclusion, we argue that notwithstanding the
negative implications of social media and the need for
some caution, social media can have a role to play in
mental health promotion. While we acknowledge that
there are limitations to our study, such as adolescents’
interchangeable understanding of positive mental health
and mental illness, the findings do suggest that adoles-
cents, education providers and mental health practi-
tioners are amenable to digital health promotion.
Providing that healthcare/education organizations devel-
oping the tools account for the possible challenges out-
lined, and schools recognise the value of supporting
young people in the social media use, it is arguably a
cost-effective, fast and efficient way to reach large num-
bers of adolescents. This could therefore be integrated as
part of broader mental health promotion packages, as a
way of distributing information, raising awareness and
possibly signposting to sources of help, as well as

providing platforms for relaxation and coping with
stress. Of course, some caution should be expressed. It
must be recognized that the absence of mental illness is
not necessarily synonymous with the presence of mental
health, and curing mental illness will not guarantee a
mentally healthy society (Keyes, 2007); but by working
with appropriate organizations in health and education,
the digital society affords some opportunity to reach
adolescents in ways that are missed in traditional help-
seeking avenues. Evidently, this is an area where a much
larger evidence-base is needed.
