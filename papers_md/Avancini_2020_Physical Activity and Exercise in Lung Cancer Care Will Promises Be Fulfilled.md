ABSTRACT

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide. Affected patients frequently experience
debilitating disease-related symptoms, including dyspnea,
insomnia, and pain,
cough, fatigue, anxiety, depression,
despite the progresses achieved in term of treatment
efﬁcacy.

Physical activity and exercise are nonpharmacological
interventions that have been shown to improve fatigue,
quality of life, cardiorespiratory ﬁtness, pulmonary func-
tion, muscle mass and strength, and psychological status
in patients with lung cancer. Moreover, physical ﬁtness
levels, especially cardiorespiratory endurance and muscu-
lar strength, are demonstrated to be independent predic-
tors of survival. Nevertheless, patients with lung cancer
frequently present insufﬁcient levels of physical activity
and exercise, and these may contribute to quality of life
impairment, reduction in functional capacity with skeletal

muscle atrophy or weakness, and worsening of symptoms,
particularly dyspnea.

The molecular bases underlying the potential impact of
exercise on the ﬁtness and treatment outcome of patients
with lung cancer are still elusive. Counteracting speciﬁc can-
cer cells’ acquired capabilities (hallmarks of cancer), together
with preventing treatment-induced adverse events, repre-
sent main candidate mechanisms.

To date, the potential impact of physical activity and exer-
cise in lung cancer remains to be fully appreciated, and no spe-
ciﬁc exercise guidelines for patients with lung cancer are
available. In this article, we perform an in-depth review of the
evidence supporting physical activity and exercise in lung cancer
and suggest that integrating this kind of intervention within the
framework of a global, multidimensional approach, taking into
account also nutritional and psychological aspects, might be the
most effective strategy. The Oncologist 2020;25:e555–e569

Implications for Practice: Although growing evidence supports the safety and efﬁcacy of exercise in lung cancer, both after
surgery and during and after medical treatments, most patients are insufﬁciently active or sedentary. Engaging in exercise
programs is particularly arduous for patients with lung cancer, mainly because of a series of physical and psychosocial
disease-related barriers (including the smoking stigma). A continuous collaboration among oncologists and cancer exercise
specialists is urgently needed in order to develop tailored programs based on patients’ needs, preferences, and physical and
psychological status. In this regard, beneﬁt of exercise appears to be potentially enhanced when administered as a multi-
dimensional, comprehensive approach to patients’ well-being.

INTRODUCTION

Historically, patients with cancer were advised to rest,
recover, and save energy, avoiding engaging in tiring physi-
cal activity. Nevertheless, starting in the late 1980s [1], new
data progressively emerged, supporting the notion that
physical activity (PA; deﬁned as any bodily movement pro-
duced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expendi-
ture) and exercise (EX;
including only those planned,
structured, and repetitive activities aimed at improving or
maintaining one or more components of physical ﬁtness)
may provide relevant beneﬁts in oncology. In cancer survi-
vors, an inverse correlation between PA and mortality or
recurrence rate was reported [2–4]. Moreover, EX can play
a beneﬁcial role during and after oncological treatments,
improvements in physical
leading to clinically meaningful
ﬁtness (aerobic, strength, ﬂexibility, and body composition)
[5–7], quality of life (QoL) [8], treatment-related side effects
[5, 9], and psychological outcomes (such as anxiety, depres-
sion, self-esteem, and energy level and vitality) [5]. Never-
theless, the American College of Sport Medicine guidelines
for EX in cancer are mainly directed to patients with breast,
prostate, colon, gynecologic, and hematological cancer, and
no universal
lung
cancer.

recommendations are available for

Lung malignancies are the leading cause of cancer-
related death [10]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are the main histological sub-
types of lung cancer, and NSCLC accounts for around 85%
of all cases. Despite meaningful recent diagnostic and thera-
peutic advances, the overall prognosis remains poor for
affected patients. In terms of overall survival (OS) according
to stage, the eighth edition of TNM classiﬁcation for lung
cancer showed an OS by clinical stage at 24 and 60 months
ranging from 97% and 92% for patients at stage I to 10%
and 0% for patients at stage IVB [11]. Despite crucial pro-
gress obtained in terms of availability of innovative treat-
ments (such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy), lung
cancer remains associated with physical, psychological, and
social difﬁculties, which exert a negative inﬂuence on
patients’ QoL. Moreover, various cancer- and treatment-
related complications, such as dyspnea, muscle wasting,
pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, and deterioration of physical
ﬁtness and lung function, may further impair patients’ sta-
tus [12]. All these outcomes have been suggested to be
potentially ameliorable with EX, despite the lack of dedi-
cated guidelines for lung cancer. Several biological mecha-
nisms have been proposed in order to explain the link
between cancer and EX. The main hypothesis and evidence
include the control of chronic low-grade inﬂammation and
the modulation of metabolic dysregulation substances
(e.g., insulin, glucose, and insulin-like growth factors) and
sex hormones. Moreover, it seems that PA and EX could
have an impact on oxidative stress and immune-related
function, modifying some crucial mechanisms connected to
tumor microenvironment (e.g., angiogenesis, proliferation,
and apoptosis) [13].

In this article, we perform an in-depth revision of avail-
able data investigating the role of PA and EX in patients
with lung cancer undergoing surgical and/or medical

Exercise in Lung Cancer Care

treatments. Moreover, we analyze potential underlying bio-
logical mechanisms, peculiar to lung cancer oncogenesis,
and suggest a structured, multidimensional way forward to
deﬁnitively address the potential impact of PA and EX on
lung cancer outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A comprehensive Pubmed and ClinicalTrials.gov search was
performed on July 24, 2019, to identify the published and
ongoing studies exploring the role of PA and EX in lung can-
cer. The following keywords were used: exercise, physical
activity, lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell
lung cancer. In order to acquire a complete and in-depth
perspective on this emerging topic, all original articles (ran-
domized clinical trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and
observational data) investigating PA and EX in lung cancer
were considered. Abstracts not published in extenso, case
reports, non-English full texts, and theses were excluded.
Participants’ inclusion criteria were adults affected by lung
cancer, surgically treated, during or after medical therapies;
animal studies were also considered. Regarding intervention,
we considered physical activity (including also exercise by
deﬁnition), deﬁned as supervised or unsupervised interven-
tions including any type of exercise applied to patients with
lung cancer and performed for at least 4 weeks. All inclusion
criteria were evaluated, in title, abstract, and full text of origi-
nal papers, by two independent reviewers.

INVESTIGATED OUTCOMES IN LUNG CANCER
A series of studies have investigated the impact of PA and
EX on measurable outcomes such as cardiorespiratory ﬁt-
ness, pulmonary function, strength and muscle mass,
fatigue, quality of life, psychological status, and sleep qual-
ity (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

Fatigue
Cancer-related fatigue is deﬁned as “a distressing, persis-
tent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cogni-
tive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer and/or cancer
treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and
interferes with usual functioning” [14]. In lung cancer, about
90% [15] of patients undergoing chemotherapy and 57%
[16] of surgically resected patients experience this side
effect. Different genetic and behavioral risk factors can pre-
dispose patients to cancer-related fatigue [17], which has
numerous manifestations, such as weakness, sleep distur-
bance, and lower concentration or attention, that cause a
negative impact on work, mood, and social relationships,
decreasing QoL [17]. Several candidate factors have been
suggested as underlying mechanisms inducing cancer-related
fatigue. Among them, an increase in proinﬂammatory cyto-
kines (such as c-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-α) and angio-
genic modulators (mainly vascular endothelial growth factor
[VEGF]), anemia, disturbance in the hypothalamic-pituitary
adrenal axis, altered brain serotonin metabolism, and defect

in adenosine triphosphate regeneration seem to play a cru-
cial role [18, 19].

By modulating these biological mechanisms, EX may
improve the management of cancer-related fatigue by
reducing symptoms’ severity. Indeed, EX has been demon-
strated to assist fatigue management in patients with can-
cer and cancer survivors affected by different types of
malignancies (such as breast, colon, prostate, etc.) [8].
Moreover, a recent meta-analysis has found that EX and
psychological intervention are more effective than a phar-
macological approach to counteract such distress [20].
Observational studies in lung cancer reported an inverse
correlation between PA and symptoms of fatigue [21–23].
In particular, D’Silva et al. objectively assessed PA and sed-
entary time in 127 patients with NSCLC (stage I–IV) and
found that moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity was
associated with fewer fatigue symptoms, whereas seden-
tary time was associated with increased fatigue, negatively

affecting QoL and physical and functional well-being [21].
Moreover, Janssen et al. described a routine rehabilitation
program, offered to patients with lung cancer, composed of
aerobic and strength exercises with a frequency of three
times per week. Fifty patients (stage I–IIIA) started the pro-
gram with a completion rate of 86%. After 12 weeks,
fatigue, QoL, and cardiorespiratory ﬁtness were signiﬁcantly
improved from the baseline assessment [22]. Similarly,
other interventional studies showed that EX ameliorates
fatigue-related symptoms [24–27], especially if
initiated
early after surgery [28]. For instance, a randomized con-
trolled trial including 96 patients with lung cancer (including
NSCLC stage I–IV and SCLC) undergoing chemotherapy com-
pared the effect of a tai chi program (performed every
other day) versus low impact exercise (as a control group)
on cancer-related fatigue. The tai chi group reported an
improvement in total fatigue score compared with the con-
trol group at 6 weeks (59.6 (cid:2) 11.3 vs. 66.8 (cid:2) 11.9, p < .05)

and 12 weeks (53.3 (cid:2) 11.8 vs. 59.3 (cid:2) 12.2, p < .05) [24].
Although these ﬁndings seem to support the beneﬁt of EX
for cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer, other interven-
tional studies reported no changes in fatigue levels after a
targeted exercise program [29–32]. In this regard, a trial
randomized 112 patients with lung cancer (NSCLC stage III–
IV and SCLC) to 8-week supervised and unsupervised PA
sessions plus a behavioral support program, and general
health education materials or control (general health edu-
cation material only). After the intervention, at 4 and
6 months, no signiﬁcant changes were detected in terms of
fatigue, QoL, symptom severity, physical or functional sta-
tus, and survival between the two groups [29]. Neverthe-
less,
in an EX program was never
associated with an exacerbation in fatigue levels. Further
studies are required to consolidate the real contribution of
exercise on cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer.

includes physical, psychological, and social
domains and has shown a prognostic impact in lung cancer
[33, 34]. The World Health Organization describes QoL as
“an individual’s perception of their position in life, in the
context of the culture and value systems in which they live
and relation to their goals, expectations, standard and con-
cerns” [35]. Patients with lung cancer have a long-lasting

QoL impairment compared with healthy people, especially
regarding physical health score, after both surgery and che-
motherapy or radiotherapy [36–38]. Nevertheless, the level
of QoL reduction might also depend on disease stage, prog-
nosis, and tumor localization [39]. A longitudinal study
among 107 patients with lung cancer (stage I–IV) showed a
direct correlation between QoL level and time dedicated in
walking activities over a 6-month follow-up period, with a
QoL increase by 0.03 points per additional minute of walk-
ing time per week [40]. A comprehensive systematic review
including 16 randomized controlled trials with different can-
cer types (breast, colorectal, lymphoma, prostate, and lung)
concluded that EX signiﬁcantly improved QoL (mean differ-
ence, 5.55; 95% conﬁdence interval
[CI], 3.16–7.90;
p < .001), during and after medical treatment. Moreover,
during treatment, a gain in both psychological and physical
variables was observed, whereas after completion of thera-
pies an improvement in only the physical aspects was evi-
dent [41].

Focusing on studies including only patients with lung
cancer, no clear advantage in terms of QoL after applying a
physical exercise program is evident [29, 31, 32, 42–49]. A
randomized controlled trial attempted to assess the impact
of EX intervention on QoL in 81 patients undergoing thora-
cotomy. Although the study closed prematurely (after

intervention and during follow-up, a very high drop-out rate
was reported (8/23 patients in the active group and 11/25
in the control group performed the functional test), with no
changes in QoL and increased pain in the active group [50].
On the other hand, there are studies reporting a QoL
improvement after training [25, 51–55]. Among them, a
study with 40 patients with stage I–IIIA NSCLC showed a sig-
niﬁcant improvement in global quality of life (p = .0032),
emotional well-being (p < .0001), mental health component
(p = .0004), and a reduction in anxiety, depression, and dis-
tress after 12 weeks of multidisciplinary intervention including
PA (aerobic, strength, and nature activity), dietary guidance,
social counseling, and other options (e.g., counseling for
smoking cessation) [51]. Considering the controversial asso-
ciation between exercise and QoL in lung cancer care, fur-
ther studies with a solid design and an adequate sample
size are required to clarify this issue.

Pulmonary Function
The assessment of respiratory functionality by a global spi-
rometry test is a crucial step to deﬁne therapeutic perspec-
tives in lung cancer. In particular, the predicted postoperative
of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the diffu-
sion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) are the most uti-
lized parameters to evaluate the surgical risk [56] and are
associated with the prognosis of patients with lung cancer
[57, 58]. Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and
comorbidities (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[COPD]) may be harmful for the pulmonary system, reducing
respiratory functionality [59–61]. Historically, the respiratory
system is deﬁned as overbuilt for exercise, and therefore
training does not appear to confer a signiﬁcant adaptation in
lung of healthy human subjects [62]. Nevertheless, the role of
EX is still controversial in pulmonary diseases. EX in patients
with COPD is largely studied, and a recent meta-analysis
including 21 randomized controlled trials has analyzed the role
of whole-body exercise on pulmonary function in adult partici-
pants with chronic lung diseases (mainly COPD). The results
demonstrated a small but signiﬁcant improvement in spirome-
try values in the EX group as compared with controls,
suggesting that in certain conditions the respiratory system
may adapt in response to training [63].

In lung cancer, the effect of EX on pulmonary parame-
ters was investigated with preliminary supportive evidence
[43, 64–67]. An individual supervised training (three times
per week, 60 minutes per session) was proposed in
17 patients with stage I–IIIA NSCLC. After 8 weeks of train-
ing, an increase was observed in exercise capacity (the pri-
mary outcome), without any signiﬁcant improvement in
other parameters, such as strength, QoL, fatigue, anxiety,
depression, and pulmonary function [43]. However, in the
ﬁrst year after surgery, patients usually experience an
increase in pulmonary parameters [68] that may be attrib-
uted to compensatory mechanisms, such as the expansion
of the remaining lobes and vascular tissues [69]. In this
postoperative context, studies testing different training pro-
grams are consistent in detecting an improvement in respi-
ratory muscle strength and/or functionality [42, 52, 70]. A
retrospective study evaluated the outcome of a comprehen-
sive rehabilitation schedule on pulmonary function in

82 patients with lung cancer (stage IIB–IV). The program
included relaxation (at least once per day), respiratory train-
ing (at least once day before surgery), cough training
(at least once per day before surgery), activities of daily liv-
ing (after surgery) and lower-extremity exercise (high-
intensity aerobic exercise, 5 days per week for 45 minutes).
At 8–10 weeks, signiﬁcant increases in forced vital capacity
(FVC; +6.4%, p = .0096) and in FEV1 (+ 10.4%, p < .0001)
were found, whereas the DLCO decreased. Even in current
or former smokers, an improvement in FEV1 was observed,
whereas patients with respiratory impairment experienced
a greater increase in both FVC (+13.9%, p = .0025) and FEV1
(+ 22.5%, p < .0001) [71]. Collectively, these results should
be interpreted cautiously, because some studies lack a con-
trol group and several aspects need to be further deﬁned,
mainly about the potential role of EX on postsurgery com-
pensatory mechanisms.

Cardiorespiratory Fitness
Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and the 6-minute walking
test (6MWT) are the most applied assessments for cardiore-
spiratory ﬁtness in lung cancer. Cardiorespiratory ﬁtness
reﬂects the capability to introduce, transport, and use oxygen,
and it is an important index of functionality, health, and lon-
gevity. Similar to pulmonary function, VO2peak can provide clin-
ically relevant diagnostic and prognostic information.
It is
inversely related to perioperative and postoperative complica-
tions, and it is an independent predictor of survival [72]. To
date, three studies have investigated the relationship between
cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and survival in lung cancer [73–75].
In this regard, Jones et al. prospectively found that each
50 meters of improvement in 6MWT was associated with a
reduction of 13% in risk of death in patients with metastatic
NSCLC. Furthermore, compared with patients in the lowest
6MWT group, the overall reduction of death risk improved
together with the increase in functional capacity (from 39% to
[75]. Cardiorespiratory ﬁtness was compromised in
52%)
patients with lung cancer versus healthy participants (mean
difference, 0.87 mL × kg−1 × min−1; 95% CI, −12.1 to −5.3;
p < .001) [76], and this impairment did not improve after ther-
apies. Fifty patients with NSCLC (stage I–IIIB) were monitored
for 6 months, from diagnosis (pretreatment) to the following
10 weeks (during treatment) and 6 months (usually after com-
pletion of therapies). 6MWT declined signiﬁcantly from diag-
nosis to during treatment (−42.7 m; 95% CI, −71.4 to 14.0;
p < .01) and continued to be lower after 6 months (−77.9 m;
95% CI, −144.3 to 11.4; p = .02) [77].

Cardiorespiratory ﬁtness involves several consecutive
steps, including respiratory and cardiovascular systems, vas-
culature, blood, and skeletal muscle. In healthy persons the
most important factor that limits exercise capacity is the
cardiac muscle [62], but in lung malignancies many cancer-
related factors concur to diminishing the cardiorespiratory
ﬁtness [78]. First, the presence of a tumor mass, together
with related surgical procedures, may affect the respiratory
system by reducing diffusion capacity. Second, in case of
advanced disease, the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscles is
impaired with a reduction in capillarization and mitochondrial
density. Moreover, chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy

Exercise in Lung Cancer Care

may harm cardiac pump, blood cell populations, and vascular
function [78].

Although in lung diseases the respiratory system could
play a major role in limiting exercise capacity, in long-term
postpneumonectomy patients (mean 5.5 years after surgery),
it was suggested that it was mainly limited by the cardiovas-
cular system [79]. Nevertheless, physical exercise may miti-
gate these impairments and improve the cardiorespiratory
ﬁtness in lung cancer. A randomized controlled trial investi-
gated the effects of high-intensity endurance and strength
training on cardiorespiratory ﬁtness as primary outcome.
Sixty-one patients with NSCLC (stage I–IV) were enrolled in
an exercise program (60 minutes for three times per week).
After 20 weeks, with an adherence rate of 88%, the authors
found an increase of 4.5 (cid:2) 3.4 mL × kg−1 × min−1 in the EX
group, whereas the control group reported a decrease of –
0.6 (cid:2) 2.7 mL × kg−1 × min−1 in cardiorespiratory ﬁtness
[52]. Similarly, a recent study including patients with surgi-
cally resected NSCLC (stage I–II) detected a signiﬁcant
VO2peak increment in the EX group versus control [42]. Glob-
ally considered, although some studies did not report any
signiﬁcant change in functional capacity following a training
period [27, 29, 45, 47–49, 55, 64, 65], the majority agreed on
the potential beneﬁcial effect of exercise on cardiorespira-
tory ﬁtness [22, 25, 31, 42–44, 46, 50, 52, 53, 66, 67, 70, 80].

Strength and Muscle Mass
Strength and muscle composition (muscle mass or size) are
the most accurate parameters to evaluate muscle function.
Patients with lung cancer may suffer from muscle dysfunc-
tion for disease-related metabolic disorders, oncological
treatments, physical inactivity, and malnutrition [81]. Muscle
mass alterations occurring during cancer deﬁne pathological
conditions, such as cachexia (a multifactorial syndrome char-
acterized by severe muscle wasting, malnutrition, and sys-
temic inﬂammation) and sarcopenia (decreased muscle
mass). The majority of patients affected by advanced lung
cancer experience cachexia (69%) or sarcopenia (47%) [82],
both related to a poor prognosis [12, 81, 83]. Considering
that strength is closely linked to muscle mass, patients with
lung cancer may also have relevant impairments of this
parameter. Indeed, patients with NSCLC (stage I–IIIA) had a
signiﬁcantly lower handgrip strength as compared with
healthy controls, with a mean difference of −6 kg (p = .023)
[76]. Muscular strength is an important parameter, and, in
healthy persons, it represents a predictor of all-cause mortal-
ity [84]. A study investigating the impact of strength on sur-
vival
found that handgrip strength is an independent
prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC and gastrointestinal
cancer with advanced and metastatic disease [85].

EX, especially resistance training, is a potent modulator
of skeletal muscle and could counteract muscle dysfunction
in patients with lung cancer. The majority of interventional
studies that included strength assessment in their second-
ary outcomes found a positive effect of EX [31, 44, 47, 48,
52, 53, 64, 66, 80], whereas few of them reported no rele-
vant effect [43, 46, 55]. However, relatively few studies
explored the role of EX on muscle mass in lung cancer. Salhi
et al. investigated the impact of a rehabilitation program on
muscle mass and strength in 45 patients with lung cancer

(stage I–III) who underwent radical oncological treatments
(surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The
rehabilitation consisted of an initial warming-up (20 minutes),
followed by resistance training of upper and lower limb mus-
cles with conventional resistance training or whole-body vibra-
tion training, 3 days per week for 12 weeks after treatment
completion. A signiﬁcant decrease in muscle cross-sectional
area and in quadriceps force with a conservation in fat-free
mass, measured with bioelectrical impedance, was observed
after treatments. Following a 12-week rehabilitation program,
full recovery in muscle strength and mass was detected in the
intervention arm, whereas the control group experienced a
further decline from baseline [86].

As suggested in the context of preclinical studies, aero-
bic and strength training seem to induce a relevant beneﬁt
against cancer cachexia [87, 88]. To our knowledge, only
one study is available in patients with cachexia. The MENAC
trial tests a multimodal
intervention to attenuate and/or
prevent cancer cachexia, which included anti-inﬂammatory
drugs, oral nutritional supplements, nutritional counseling,
and an exercise program, on patients with lung and pancre-
atic cancer. To assess intervention safety and feasibility, a
phase II cohort randomized 46 patients (26 with advanced
NSCLC). The home-based EX intervention consisted of aero-
bic training (30 minutes two times per week) and six indi-
vidualized strength tasks (three times per week). Six weeks
later, the intervention was shown to be safe and feasible,
with a compliance of 76% for anti-inﬂammatory drugs, 60%
for exercise, and 48% for nutritional supplements. No signif-
icant changes in PA, muscle mass and strength, fatigue, and
nutritional status were reported, probably because of the
small sample size [89]. The phase III cohort of MENAC trial,
is currently enrolling

include 240 patients,

Psychological Status and Sleep Quality
Patients with lung cancer may experience several health
problems, including psychological distress, because of can-
cer or undesired effects of its treatment. PA and EX may
contribute to limiting these impairments.

The beneﬁcial role of PA and EX in anxiety and depres-
sion is well established [90, 91] through the modulation of
monoamine and cortisol levels, leading to adaptation in lim-
bic structures [92]. The prevalence of anxiety, depression,
and sleep disorders among patients with lung cancer is
33%, 34%, and 45%–57%, respectively [93, 94]. In the con-
text of lung cancer, few studies have considered the poten-
tial role of EX to improve these symptoms, ﬁnding positive
[44, 51] or neutral effects [31]. Chen et al. investigated the
impact of EX on anxiety and depression symptoms as a pri-
mary outcome in a sample of patients with lung cancer
(stage I–IV). Enrolled participants (n = 116) were randomly
assigned to a 12-week moderate-intensity walking program,
three times per week for 40 minutes, or usual care. After
the intervention, anxiety (p = .009) and depression
(p = .00006) levels were signiﬁcantly diminished, and the
effect was maintained over time (anxiety, p = .006; depres-
sion, p = .004) [30].

EX can improve sleep quality in the general population
[95], but also in cancer survivors [96]. Sleep disturbances
are a common problem in oncology care and affect a large
portion of patients with lung cancer, especially during the
chemotherapy period [94]. EX seems to contribute to
improving sleep quality in patients with lung cancer [23, 32,
96], although results of different studies are controversial
[29, 30]. A home-based walking program proposed by Chen
et al. has shown that 12 weeks of moderate-intensity EX is
effective over time in improving both subjective (p = .001)
and objective (p = .023) sleep quality in a sample of patients
with lung cancer (stage I–IV) compared with the control
group [96].

BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS
The molecular mechanisms by which PA and EX could inﬂu-
ence lung cancer outcomes remain elusive. Data from litera-
ture suggest that PA and EX may counteract some speciﬁc
cancer cells’ acquired capabilities (hallmarks of cancer) and,
at the same time, prevent chemotherapy-related adverse
events (Fig. 1).

The ability to promote an aberrant angiogenesis represents
a main hallmark of cancer. In fact, as an adaptive response to
hypoxia, cancer cells activate the hypoxia-inducible factor
1-alpha (HIF-1α) pathway to promote angiogenesis through
proangiogenetic factors, mainly VEGF-α [97]. Under normal
conditions, EX stimulates a physiological angiogenetic process
and VEGF release in skeletal muscles in a HIF-1–independent
manner [98]. Nevertheless, how EX modulates angiogenesis in
an oncological setting is not clear. Treadmill exercise for a
period of 4 weeks, ﬁve times per week and 60 minutes each
session, has demonstrated to signiﬁcantly increase VEGF serum
levels in mice inoculated with Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells, as
compared with baseline (p = .015), but without signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in terms of survival rate or tumor growth compared
with the control group [99]. Alves et al. observed 2.5-fold
higher mRNA levels of VEGF-α (p < .05) in an LLC mice model
undergoing daily high-intensity interval training after tumor cell
injection compared with sedentary mice, with a signiﬁcant
reduction of tumor mass (−52% after 18 days) and beneﬁt in
survival [100].

The capability to escape cell death and apoptosis is
another hallmark of cancer, and p53 plays a crucial role as a
tumor suppressor protein [97]. EX may affect oncogenesis
through activation of p53-induced apoptosis. In this regard,
daily wheel running for 4 weeks appeared to reduce pri-
mary tumor growth (but not distant metastases), as com-
pared with a control group (p < .01), with a signiﬁcant
increase in p53 intratumoral levels (p < .01), in a murine
model of lung adenocarcinoma. Similarly, levels of Bax and
caspase 3 (two proapoptotic proteins in the p53 pathway)
were signiﬁcantly increased. Interestingly, this cancer model
was p53 wild type, suggesting the potential role of EX in
stabilizing p53 and avoiding its downregulation [101].

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase–AKT pathway (through
mTOR and S6 kinase) and the RAS-MAP kinase cascade
(through ERK1 and ERK2) are involved in enhancing cell pro-
liferation and survival, as well as in lung cancer cells resis-
tance to chemotherapy and radiation [102, 103]. The effect

of EX has been studied in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells
incubated with human serum, collected pre- or post-EX, or
foetal bovine serum as control. A signiﬁcant reduction of
proliferation and survival for cells treated with post-EX
serum compared with control (p < .05 and p < .001, respec-
tively) was observed. A relevant reduction of cell survival
was also evident when comparing cells treated with pre-
and post-EX serum (p < .001). To explore the potential
underlying reasons, the authors measured activated (phos-
phorylated) AKT levels through immunoblotting, revealing a
signiﬁcant reduction between cells incubated with pre- and
post-EX serum (p < .001). Similar ﬁndings were observed for
mTOR, S6 kinase, and ERK1 and ERK2 activation [104].

Another possible mechanism underlying the anti-
tumorigenic impact of EX is related to immunomodulation,
particularly by increasing proinﬂammatory cytokine levels
and natural killer (NK) cell inﬁltration in the tumor microen-
vironment. Pedersen et al. found that EX (wheel running) in
LLC mice signiﬁcantly reduced tumor volume (−58%), with
an upregulation of proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1a and
inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]) and markers for NK
and T-cell activity [105]. In a prospective randomized study
in postsurgical patients with NSCLC, 16 weeks of tai chi
chuan training was demonstrated to signiﬁcantly promote
proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as com-
pared with both basal levels (p < .001) and a control group
(p < .05), with an increase in their cytotoxicity demon-
strated by incubation with lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells

lymphocytes (T1) to IL-4–producing CD3+ T lymphocytes
(T2) and an increase in cortisol levels during recovery time.
Conversely, the experimental arm (16 postsurgical patients
with NSCLC) who followed a guided 16-week moderate-
intensity tai chi program (60 minutes per session, three ses-
sions per week) managed to preserve a stable T1-to-T2 ratio
and cortisol levels [107]. Interestingly, preliminary evidence
suggests that chemotherapy-treated patients with lung can-
cer who joined exercise sessions using resistance bands
managed to maintain white blood cell levels during treat-
ment compared with a control group [108].

CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION IN
PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER
Mounting evidence suggests that EX is safe in patients with
lung cancer, both after surgery and during and after medical
treatments. Different programs with a variety of activities
were explored, such as tai chi, aerobic and strength exer-
cise, walking, balance, and breathing techniques. The most
often applied frequency was two or three times per week,
and time per session ranged from 5 to 120 minutes. Across
the studies, all the levels of training intensity (light, moder-
ate, and vigorous), when reported, appeared to be well tol-
erated by patients. However, most patients with lung
cancer are insufﬁciently active or sedentary, and a series of
studies reported a low adherence and high drop-out rate
from EX programs [43, 48, 65, 109, 110]. Among drop-out
lack of
reasons, cancer-related side effects and, mostly,
interest and motivation represent key contributors.

There are many barriers limiting the adherence to a PA
program. Some of them are also common in healthy people,
such as lack of access to services or lack of interest, but
others are speciﬁcally related to health status, disease
course, and therapeutic approach. In addition, environmental
and personal exercise preferences, fun, and social implica-
tions are important factors that inﬂuence the participation
and consistency over time to a physical activity program
[111].
In patients with lung cancer (and their caregivers)
there is a higher risk of experiencing exacerbations of psy-
chosocial distress because of the widely shared stigmatiza-
tion of this disease based on the close link between lung
cancer and smoking [112].

Several models, applicable also in cancer populations,
are applied to trigger motivation to perform exercise (such
as social cognitive theory, theory of planned behavior, and
self-determination theory). Knowledge and integration of
these theories in clinical practice may help patients to
adopt and maintain EX or PA as part of their lifestyle [113].
The American Cancer Society and American College of Sport
Medicine recommend avoiding inactivity and suggest that
patients with cancer should engage in regular PA. In detail,
at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity, or
75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, with ﬂexibility and
strength exercise two or three times per week should be per-
formed [5, 114]. This goal could be difﬁcult to achieve, espe-
cially for physically deconditioned patients. For this reason, the
EX program should be ﬂexible (particularly during treatment
periods), start easily, and progress slowly according to patient’s
rhythm and body response. Moreover, an interpatient

heterogeneity in physical, psychological status, and treatment-
related side effects needs to be considered. According to avail-
able evidence, an accurate baseline assessment, including clini-
cal, physical, and psychosocial conditions, is fundamental to
schedule a tailored EX program. Recognizing the presence of
relevant comorbidities to adapt activity and avoid potential
EX-induced risks is fundamental. The presence of extreme
fatigue or high physical limitation could be a contraindica-
tion to start an EX program, or a low cardiorespiratory ﬁt-
ness may suggest performing EX with low intensity and for
short time [5].

Considering all these factors, in clinical practice close col-
laboration among oncologists and kinesiologists (or cancer
exercise specialists or physiotherapists) may allow developing
speciﬁc EX programs based on patient’s needs, preferences,
and physical and psychological status. The ﬁnal aims are to
improve patient’s physical ﬁtness and quality of life, reduce
treatment-related side effects, and increase the motivation
to adopt and maintain an active lifestyle over time (Fig. 2).
Several trials are ongoing to enrich the currently available
amount of evidence-based data (Table 2).

CONCLUSION
As highlighted above, many questions are still open regarding
optimal exercise prescription and actual impact of EX and PA
on survival rate, treatment-related side effects, and quality
of life of patients with lung cancer. Although available evi-
dence provides a strong rationale to continue pursuing and
investigating these aspects from both a clinical and transla-
tional point of view, current results remain not decisive
because of methodological limitations of the performed tri-
als, small numbers of patients included (mainly affected by
early-stage lung cancer), and a general lack of tailored EX
programs, taking into account individual patients’ conditions,
comorbidities, and preferences.

A common topic emerging from available experiences
explores the potential synergistic impact of strongly integrated
interdisciplinary approaches, encompassing coordinated EX and
PA, nutritional, and psychological and behavioral interventions.
From a theoretical standpoint, it is reasonable to speculate that
behavioral and psychological intervention or counseling may
reinforce motivation and compliance, thus potentially favoring
adherence to tailored EX programs. On the other hand, nutri-
tional counseling may help to counteract sarcopenia and mus-
cle wasting, thereby rendering EX more effective in maintaining
muscle mass and improving strength. Indeed, a meta-analysis
showed that combined EX and psychological intervention is
more effective than a pharmacological approach to counteract
fatigue [8]. Similarly, an integrated approach encompassing EX,
dietary guidance, social counseling, and a smoking cessation
program [51] clearly improved QoL, emotional well-being, and
mental health, while reducing anxiety, depression, and distress.
Overall, the impact of PA and EX on QoL endpoints appears to
be potentially more profound when administered as part of a
multidimensional, comprehensive approach to physical, nutri-
tional, and psychological well-being.

In this regard, a further step to improve the awaited beneﬁt
deriving from PA and EX may be achieved by embedding a per-
sonalized physical exercise program within a multidimensional

teamwork intervention for oncological patients. In this light, we
are currently offering a patient-centered approach provided by
an integrated team, including dietitians, kinesiologists, and psy-
chologists coordinated by a medical oncologist (the Focus On
Research and CarE team [FORCE]). On one hand, these non-
pharmacological interventions may help improve QoL, physical
functions, psychological aspects, and treatment-related adverse
events and reduce symptoms and complications occurring dur-
ing cancer care. On the other, we hypothesize that such a com-
prehensive approach may inﬂuence patients’ immune status,
thereby ultimately affecting treatment outcome (in particular
for patients undergoing immunotherapy). Based on a rigorous
scientiﬁc method, we aim to (A) derive tissue- and blood-based
immunological signature(s) predicting the outcome of immuno-
logical therapy, (B) demonstrate that EX (in context with nutri-
tional counseling and behavioral interventions provided in an
integrated fashion by the FORCE team) favorably modiﬁes such
predictive signatures, and (C) test (in a formal clinical trial) the
hypothesis that speciﬁc EX preconditioning schemes (again
in the context of a multidisciplinary intervention) improve
the outcome(s) of patients with lung cancer undergoing
immunotherapy.
