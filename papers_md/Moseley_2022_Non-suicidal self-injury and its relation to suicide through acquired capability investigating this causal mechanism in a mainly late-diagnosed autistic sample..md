Abstract 
Background:  Non‑suicidal self‑injury (NSSI) has been linked with a higher risk of suicide attempts in autistic and 
non‑autistic people. In the general population, NSSI may confer acquired capability for suicide by eroding one’s fear 
and avoidance of pain and death. The present study aimed to explore acquired capability as the mediator of increased 
suicide risk conferred by NSSI in autistic and non‑autistic adults.

Methods:  Autistic and non‑autistic adults (n 
=
attempts, experience with NSSI, and acquired capability for suicide. We explored relationships between lifetime 
incidence of NSSI and lifetime suicide attempts via three facets of acquired capability (pain tolerance, reduced fear of 
death, and mental rehearsal of suicide). In self‑harming participants (224 autistic and 156 non‑autistic), we explored 
whether particular types and features of NSSI might be especially associated with capability and through that with 
suicide: namely engagement in scratching, cutting, and self‑hitting, and engaging in more numerous forms of NSSI.

 312) completed an online survey exploring lifetime suicide 

 314, n 

=

Results:  While a higher frequency of NSSI was associated with all three facets of acquired capability, only reduced 
fear of death and mental rehearsal of suicide mediated an indirect relationship with lifetime suicide attempts. NSSI 
also directly predicted more numerous suicide attempts. Autistic people tended towards reduced fear of death 
and mental rehearsal regardless of NSSI status. Among self‑harming autistic and non‑autistic participants, cutting 
and an increased number of NSSI behaviours were associated with lifetime suicide attempts directly and indirectly 
via acquired capability. In both groups, self‑hitting was associated with lifetime suicide attempts only via acquired 
capability.

Limitations:  Our cross‑sectional methodology negates inferences of directionality. While we controlled for age, our 
samples were poorly matched, with the autistic group two times older on average. The autistic sample, predominantly 
late‑diagnosed, female and highly qualified, were unrepresentative of the whole autistic community.

Conclusions:  Our data suggest that acquired capability, as measured herein, is an incomplete explanation for the 
association between NSSI and suicide risk. A broader construct with stable and transient facets may offer greater

Background
Non-suicidal  self-injury  (NSSI)  describes  deliberate  and 
directly  harmful  behaviours  (such  as  cutting,  scratch-
ing or burning) which inflict pain and/or damage to the 
body.1  In  non-autistic  people,  it  has  been  reported  to 
serve  a  variety  of  intra-  and  interpersonal  functions, 
including escaping intolerable emotional states, generat-
ing  desired  emotions  or  sensations,  communicating  dis-
tress,  or  meeting  interpersonal  needs  [1–3].  Crucially, 
NSSI  is  differentiated  from  a  broader  taxonomy  of  self-
injurious thoughts and behaviours by the absence of sui-
cidal intent [4]. Despite this, a robust relationship exists 
between  NSSI  and  increased  likelihood  of  suicide  idea-
tion, attempts and deaths [5–8].

There is emerging evidence that the same link between 
NSSI  and  later  suicidality  exists  in  the  autistic  popu-
lation,  who  exhibit  markedly  higher  rates  of  suicide 
attempts  and  deaths  [9–11].  Historically,  self-injury 
in  autistic  people  has  been  perceived  as  a  “challenging 
behaviour” [12] or a manifestation of stereotypy [13–16], 
especially when studied in minimally verbal autistic indi-
viduals with intellectual disability. In contrast to NSSI as 
seen  in  non-autistic  people,  these  self-injurious  behav-
iours are stereotypic and unconcealed, occurring without 
clear intent of causing harm and sometimes in conjunc-
tion  with  externally  directed  aggression,  and  associated 
with  low  communicative  ability  and  adaptive  function 
[17–20].  Only  very  recently  has  research  reflected  that 
autistic  adults  without  intellectual  disabilities  engage  in 
behaviours  which  resemble  normative  patterns  of  NSSI 
in  their  nature  and  functional  purpose  [21–23].  Quali-
tative  analysis  suggests  some  autistic  adults  perceive 
NSSI  as  a  “coping  mechanism”,  an  escape  from  “intoler-
able anxiety”, “atomic pressure” and “being lost” [22, 23]; 
quantitative approaches accordingly link NSSI with alex-
ithymia,  depression  and  anxiety  [22].  Undiscerning  of 
intent,  some  studies  report  higher  rates  of  suicidal  and 

1  NSSI should not be confused with indirectly harmful/self-destructive behav-
iours, such as promiscuity, smoking or substance abuse. We adopt the defini-
tion as employed in DSM-5 (APA, 20,213) and by the International Society for 
the Study of Self-Injury (2018), wherein NSSI are directly harmful behaviours 
without  suicidal  intent.  “Parasuicide”,  “parasuicidal  behaviours”,  “self-mutila-
tion”, “self-harm” and “deliberate self-harm” (e.g. NICE, 2013) are terms often 
used  when  the  underlying  motivations  for  self-injury  are  uncertain.  While  it 
is likely that non-suicidal self-injuries are encapsulated in such literature, this 
imprecision  can  obscure  clarity  in  this  field  (Prinstein,  2016;  Sadek,  2019), 
especially when trying to understand the relationship of NSSI to later suicidal-
ity.

non-suicidal  self-injury  in  autistic  children,  adolescents 
and  adults  [24–27],  linking  these  with  compulsivity  and 
impulsivity,  insistence  on  sameness,  hyperactivity,  low 
mood and emotional dysregulation [28, 29].

The  fact  that  these  papers  assimilated  NSSI  within  a 
broader  concept  of  “suicidal  thoughts  and  behaviours” 
disallows any attempt to examine NSSI as a specific risk 
marker  for  future  suicide  ideation,  plans,  attempts  and 
deaths.  There  are,  to  our  knowledge,  just  two  studies 
which did report a specific association between non-sui-
cidal NSSI and suicidal behaviour in autistic people [30, 
31].  One  of  these  was  suggestive  of  a  particular  suicide 
risk  posed  by  certain  NSSI  behaviours  (namely  cutting) 
[31].  In  the  same  study,  where  a  high  proportion  of  the 
autistic  sample  had  reported  neutral  or  positive  views 
about their NSSI [22], there was no connection between 
distress associated with NSSI and suicidality.

The  association  between  self-injury  that  is  distinctly 
non-suicidal and later suicide risk is an important feature 
in both autistic and non-autistic populations and requires 
explanation. In the general population, a putative mecha-
nism was proposed in the form of acquired capability for 
suicide  [32,  33]:  from  this  theoretical  standpoint,  expo-
sure  to  physically  painful  and  emotionally  provocative 
events  [34,  35]  results  in  the  development  of  pain  toler-
ance  and  fearlessness  about  pain  and  death,  such  that 
individuals  can  enact  the  desire  to  end  their  own  life  if 
it  occurs.  Identified  as  a  particularly  potent  means  of 
accruing  suicide  capability  [36–40],  NSSI  is  believed  to 
habituate individuals to pain and thus increase their tol-
erance while eroding their fear of it [41, 42]. Individuals 
who have acquired the capability for suicide via NSSI are 
proposed  to  be  consequently  less  frightened  of  what  is 
entailed in a lethal suicide attempt [36, 43]. They are also 
more  likely  to  mentally  rehearse  suicide  plans,  further 
eroding fears of death [44].

In  terms  of  acquiring  the  capability  for  suicide 
attempts,  studies  in  non-autistic  people  suggest  that 
certain features of NSSI bear particular weight. Just as a 
greater  risk  of  suicide  is  associated  with  a  wider  variety 
of  NSSI  behaviours  and  with  more  violent  and  damag-
ing methods [45–47], these features likewise predict the 
greatest increases in acquired capability [43, 48]. Interest-
ingly,  the  type  of  NSSI  behaviour  appears  more  impor-
tant than the function of that behaviour in predicting the 
transition  from  suicide  ideation  to  attempts  [49],  con-
sistent  with  the  notion  that  an  individual’s  actions  may

override their intent in building suicide risk. Just as previ-
ously observed in an autistic sample [31], cutting emerges 
from  research  in  the  general  population  as  particularly 
strongly linked with later suicide attempts; it is a particu-
larly  painful,  graphic  and  physically  damaging  means  of 
self-injury which might as such be particularly associated 
with building pain tolerance and fearlessness of pain and 
death [49–51].

Considering  the  previous  lack  of  association  between 
how autistic participants felt about their NSSI and their 
higher suicide risk [31], the present study aimed primar-
ily  to  re-investigate  the  association  between  NSSI  and 
suicide  attempts  in  autistic  and  non-autistic  adults  with 
particular attention to acquired capability as the hypoth-
esised mediator of this relationship. There is a paucity of 
literature  concerning  the  development  and  significance 
of  acquired  capability  in  relation  to  suicide  in  autis-
tic  people,  though  three  studies  have  drawn  tentative 
links  between  acquired  capability  and  suicide  attempts 
[52–54]. One of these, an analysis addressing a different 
question,  included  the  same  autistic  sample  as  the  pre-
sent  investigation:  it  highlighted  the  potential  relevance 
of reduced fear of death and mental rehearsal of suicide 
plans for suicide attempts [54]. The present study, which 
includes  a  comparison  group,  aimed  to  consequently 
expose  differences 
in  the  strength  of  relationships 
between NSSI, acquired capability and suicide attempts. 
Pursuing  threads  of  inquiry  from  our  previous  analy-
sis  [31],  a  secondary  goal  was  to  explore  relationships 
between  particular  types/methods  of  NSSI,  acquired 
capability and suicide attempts; whether risk incurred by 
specific forms of NSSI was associated with features such 
as  pain  inflicted  and  habituation;  and  whether  a  greater 
variety  of  NSSI  behaviours  was  likewise  associated  with 
acquired  capability  and  suicide  risk  via  greater  pain 
inflicted and greater habituation.

Method
Participants
The  autistic  sample  (n = 314)  was  the  same  as  that 
described  in  a  previous  study  [54].  They  were  recruited 
via  advertisement  on  social  media,  Autistica’s  research 
network  and  the  Cambridge  Autism  Research  Data-
base; we also contacted participants on our mailing lists 
from  previous  studies  [22,  31].  Trusting  in  participants’ 
honesty as regards self-reporting their autism diagnosis, 
we  did  not  clinically  validate  these  diagnoses,  though 
we did ask for details of the place and date of diagnosis. 
The  comparison  group  of  non-autistic  adults  (n = 312) 
mainly  comprised  students  from  Bournemouth  Univer-
sity, plus some recruited from social media: asked about 
neurodevelopmental conditions, none of these endorsed 
an  autism  diagnosis  or  suspected  autism.  Demographic 

information  for  both  groups  can  be  seen  in  Table  1, 
though  unfortunately  we  did  not  possess  ethnicity  data 
for  the  control  group.  It  is  likely  that  they  were  mainly 
Caucasian/white, given the low ethnic diversity in county 
Dorset.

Table  1  displays  participant  demographic  features 
and  scores  in  two  of  our  experimental  measures,  the 
Acquired  Capability  With  Rehearsal  for  Suicide  Scale 
(ACWRSS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; note 
that our two other scales, the NSSI-AT and the SITBI, do 
not yield total or subscale forms in the manner used here.

Materials and procedure

Ethical permission for the study was granted by the Sci-
ence  and  Technology  Faculty  panel  of  Bournemouth 
University.  Data  for  the  present  analysis  were  collected 
between  July  2020  and  March  2021  as  part  of  a  larger 
online  study  which  involved  a  number  of  additional 
standardised questionnaires (see [54]). We describe only 
the measures relevant to the present analysis.

The Non‑Suicidal Self‑Injury Assessment Tool (NSSI‑AT)

The  NSSI-AT  [55]  comprises  a  comprehensive  assess-
ment  of  NSSI,  including  the  nature  of  self-injurious 
behaviours  (i.e.  the  method  of  self-injury),  their  func-
tional  purpose  as  perceived  by  the  participant,  and  the 
recency  and  frequency  of  behaviours.  Participants  were 
classified  as  having  engaged  in  NSSI  if  they  reported 
engaging in any number of listed behaviours at any point 
in  their  lifetime  and  if  those  behaviours  were  not  only 
a  means  of  practising  or  attempting  suicide  (as  per  [22, 
31]). With one non-autistic participant excluded for this 
reason, the number of participants with a lifetime history 
of NSSI is shown in Table 1.

The  present  study  used  six  indices  from  the  NSSI-
AT  as  predictors  or  mediators.  Lifetime  incidence  of 
NSSI,  range  of  NSSI  behaviours,  and  habituation  to 
NSSI  were  all  continuous  variables,  and  we  also  cre-
ated three binary codes reflecting engagement in three 
common  forms  of  NSSI.  All  participants  were  scored 
for  lifetime  incidence  of  NSSI:  participants  were 
coded  0  if  they  had  never  engaged  in  NSSI,  1  if  they 
had  hurt  themselves  just  once,  2  if  they  had  engaged 
in NSSI 2–3 times, 3 for 4–5 times, 4 for 6–10 times, 5 
for 11–20 times, 6 for 21–50 times, and 7 for 50 times 
or  more.  The  remaining  variables  were  only  relevant 
for  individuals  with  a  history  of  NSSI.  In  these  par-
ticipants, the range of NSSI behaviours was quantified 
by  giving  participants  a  score  of  1  for  every  method/
type  of  NSSI  engaged  in,  such  that  participants  with 
higher scores were those who engaged in a wider range 
(more types) of NSSI behaviours than individuals who 
consistently  used  one  or  two  methods,  regardless

of  frequency.  Habituation  to  NSSI  was  indicated  by 
responses to the Habituation and Perceived Life Inter-
ference  section  of  the  NSSI-AT,  specifically  to  the 
six  items  measuring  habituation  (e.g.  “I  have  had  to 

intentionally  hurt  myself  more  deeply  and/or  in  more 
places  on  my  body  over  time  to  get  the  same  effect”); 
higher  scores  indicated  that  participants  had  habitu-
ated  or  developed  tolerance  for  NSSI  and  required 

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2022) 13:45

more  damaging/painful  behaviours  to  achieve  the 
desired effect. Finally, we created three binary indices 
affirming [1] or negating (0) engagement in scratching 
or pinching oneself to the point of bleeding or marking 
the skin (henceforth “scratching”), cutting oneself, and 
punching or hitting oneself to the point of bruising or 
bleeding  (henceforth  “self-hitting”),  which  were  the 
three most common methods of NSSI in both groups.

Although not part of the scale, we created a seventh 
index which was presented with the NSSI-AT. As pain 
is  understood  to  be  important  in  the  development  of 
acquired  capability  [34],  participants  with  NSSI  expe-
rience were asked to think about the method they most 
frequently used and indicate, on a sliding scale from 1 
(not painful at all) to 10 (extremely painful), how pain-
ful it usually felt.

Acquired Capability with Rehearsal for Suicide Scale 
(ACWRSS)

There is conceptual debate as to the nature of acquired 
capability [56] and the psychometric quality of existing 
measures [57]. We employed a brief screening measure 
based  on  a  three-factor  model  of  the  construct  [44]. 
The  ACWRSS  constitutes  7  items  which  load  on  fac-
tors  pain  tolerance  (2  items,  e.g.  “I  can  tolerate  pain 
much  more  than  I  used  to”),  reduced  fear  of  death  by 
suicide  (2  reverse-scored  items,  e.g.  “Even  if  I  wanted 
to,  killing  myself  is  too  scary  to  follow  through  with 
it”),  and  mental  rehearsal  of  suicide  plans  (3  items, 
e.g.  “I  have  thought  of  ways  to  kill  myself  that  would 
be  the  least  difficult  for  me  to  pull  off ”).  Participants 
responded  to  items  on  an  8-point  scale  between  “Not 
at all” to “Very strongly”, with higher scores in the total 
and  subscales  reflecting  greater  acquired  capability 
for  suicide.  Though  this  measure  has  not  yet  received 
extensive  use  and  external  validation,  it  was  seen  to 
yield  a  consistent  3-factor  structure  across  independ-
ent  samples  (with  alpha  coefficients  range  of  0.74–
0.81),  to  operate  invariably  across  males  and  females, 
to  show  good  test–retest  reliability  over  2  months, 
and  to  possess  strong  convergent  validity  with  items 
assessing suicide ideation, intent, readiness, prior sui-
cide  attempts  and  NSSI  ideation  and  behaviours  [44]. 
Internal consistency (α) was good for the autistic sam-
ple (total: 0.78; pain tolerance: 0.78; fear of death: 0.75; 
and mental rehearsal: 0.84). For the non-autistic group, 
internal consistency was good for the total scale (0.81) 
and for the pain tolerance (0.81) and mental rehearsal 
(0.91) subscales, but poor for the reduced fear of death 
by suicide subscale (0.51). The average scores for both 
groups are given in Table 1.

Self‑Injurious Thoughts and Behaviours Interview, short form 
(SITBI)

For the outcome variable in our analyses, we used a sin-
gle  item  from  the  SITBI  [58]:  “How  many  times  in  your 
lifetime have you made an actual attempt to kill yourself, 
in which you had at least some intent to die?”. Scores in 
this continuous index of lifetime suicide attempts ranged 
from 0 to 4, reflecting choices from “Never” (endorsed by 
161  autistic  and  238  non-autistic  participants),  “Once” 
(51  autistic  and  34  non-autistic  participants),  “Twice” 
(28  autistic  and  17  non-autistic  participants),  “Three  or 
four times” (48 autistic and 12 non-autistic participants), 
to  “Five  or  more  times”  (26  autistic  and  11  non-autistic 
participants).

Patient Health Questionnaire‑9 (PHQ‑9)

As depression is a common if not strongly reliable ante-
cedent of suicide attempts [33] and may be higher in indi-
viduals  who  engage  in  NSSI  [22],  we  modelled  current 
depressive  symptomatology  as  a  covariate  in  our  analy-
ses. The PHQ-9 [59] has recently been validated for use 
in  autistic  people  [60];  it  showed  good  internal  consist-
ency in our autistic (α = 0.90) and non-autistic (α = 0.90) 
samples, whose scores can be seen in Table 1. A clinical 
cut-off of 8 is recommended for the major depressive dis-
order [61].

Analysis

Data  were  inspected  for  outliers  (Cook’s  test),  linearity, 
autocorrelation (Durbin–Watson test), and homoscedas-
ticity [62]. As NSSI and suicidality are somewhat excep-
tional  phenomena,  our  predictor  and  outcome  variables 
would not be expected to conform to the normal distri-
bution;  normality  violations  are  generally  not  uncom-
mon  in  psychiatry  [63].  Normality  is  not  a  prerequisite 
for the bootstrapping method employed in our analyses, 
but  nevertheless  we  visually  examined  the  data  of  each 
group for total scores in acquired capability (ACWRSS), 
each  ACWRSS  subscale,  and  the  PHQ-9,  which  did 
not  raise  concerns  in  terms  of  skewness  or  kurtosis.  Of 
importance,  though,  was  the  significantly  lower  age  of 
non-autistic  participants  and  the  unequal  distribution 
of  participants  by  sex,  with  women  over-represented 
in both groups. Age and sex were thus controlled for as 
covariates in all analyses comparing the two groups.

Analysis  followed  two  streams,  the  first  exploring 
acquired  capability  as  a  mediator  in  the  relationship 
between  NSSI  and  suicide  attempts  in  all  626  partici-
pants.  To  investigate  this,  we  employed  the  PROCESS 
macro  for  SPSS  [64],  an  ordinary  least  squares  method 
with bootstrapping (5000 samples). With confidence lev-
els set at 95%, the first analysis (Model 59) used lifetime

incidence of NSSI as a continuous predictor and lifetime 
suicide  attempts  as  a  continuous  outcome  measure.  As 
facets of acquired capability, pain tolerance, reduced fear 
of  death and  mental rehearsal were modelled  as parallel 
mediators,  with  depression,  age  and  sex  as  covariates. 
Potential moderating effects of diagnosis were examined 
for all pathways in the model, most particularly the direct 
(c’)  and  indirect  effects  of  NSSI  on  suicide  attempts. 
Based  on  our  previous  research  where  NSSI  predicted 
13%  (Nagelkerke  R2)  of  the  variance  in  lifetime  suicide 
attempts  [36],  we  had  calculated  that  with  power  set  at 
90%  for  this  analysis  (with  its  8  variables),  even  a  weak 
relationship  between  NSSI  and  suicide  attempts  would 
be  expected  to  be  evident  with  anything  above  136 
participants.

The  second  stream  of  analysis  included  only  partici-
pants  with  a  history  of  NSSI  (224  autistic  and  156  non-
autistic  participants):  we  aimed  to  explore  whether 
certain  forms  of  NSSI  were  particularly  associated  with 
suicide attempts via acquired capability, and whether this 
association  was  due  to  characteristics  of  these  methods 
such  as  how  painful  they  are  and  how  much  individu-
als habituate to them. The three most common forms of 
self-injury,  in  both  groups,  happened  to  be  scratching, 
cutting,  and  self-hitting.  Using  the  Lambda  statistic,  we 
confirmed the independence of these variables as binary 
predictors  (where  1  indicated  the  presence  of  that  form 
of NSSI). As a wider range of NSSI is indicative of more 
extreme  behaviours  and  of  habituation  over  time  [46, 
48],  the  range  of  NSSI  was  also  selected  as  a  predictor. 
We  then  performed  four  sequential  mediation  analyses 
(Model 6 in PROCESS), one for each predictor, wherein 
the  effect  of  the  predictor  on  lifetime  suicide  attempts 
was hypothesised to be serially mediated by pain experi-
enced (mediator 1), which would be expected to predict 
habituation (mediator 2) and from this, acquired capabil-
ity  for  suicide  (mediator  3,  using  ACWRSS  total  score). 
In  each  instance,  depression  was  modelled  as  a  covari-
ate. Note that because some autistic participants did not 
complete all items of the pain and habituation subscales 
of the NSSI-AT, sample numbers varied slightly (between 
220 and 222 of 224 possible participants) across the four 
analyses.

Model  6  does  not  allow  the  presence  of  a  moderator, 
so  autistic  and  non-autistic  participants  could  not  be 
statistically  compared  in  these  analyses.  As  such,  these 
four  analyses  were  run  for  each  group  separately,  and 
alpha  levels  were  corrected  to  p < 0.0125  for  each  batch. 
The  analyses  for  non-autistic  participants,  as  not  the 
focus  of  this  paper,  are  summarised  below  with  regards 
to  any  differences  that  arose,  while  presented  in  full  in

Results
Part 1: Relationships between NSSI and suicide attempts 
as mediated by acquired capability

The  higher  lifetime  incidence  of  NSSI  was  associated 
with  all  three  facets  of  acquired  capability:  with  higher 
pain tolerance (path  a1: b = 0.48, p < 0.001, CI: 0.27, 0.70; 
R2 = 0.12, F [6, 619] = 14.13, p < 0.001); with reduced fear 
of  death  by  suicide  (path   a2:  b = 0.46,  p < 0.001,  CI:  0.25, 
0.68;  R2 = 0.17,  F  [6,  619] = 21.05,  p < 0.001);  and  with 
more mental rehearsal of suicide plans (path  a3: b = 1.29, 
p < 0.001,  CI:  0.99,  1.60;  R2 = 0.44,  F  [6,  619] = 81.66, 
p < 0.001).  The  diagnosis  did  not  moderate  relationships 
between  NSSI  incidence  and  pain  tolerance  or  reduced 
fear  of  death  but  was  directly  predictive  of  reduced  fear 
of  death  by  suicide  (b = 1.55,  p = 0.0299,  CI  0.15,  2.95). 
For  the  mental  rehearsal  aspect  of  acquired  capability, 
diagnosis  exerts  both  a  main  effect  (b = 0.37,  p < 0.001, 
CI 4.40, 8.34) and a moderating effect on its relationship 
with NSSI incidence (path 3: b = -0.82, p < 0.001, CI -1.20, 
-0.44).  Respectively,  these  reflected  that  autistic  status 
was  associated  with  higher  mental  rehearsal  of  suicide 
plans and that the relationship between higher frequency 
of  NSSI  and  greater  mental  rehearsal  was  stronger  in 
non-autistic  (b = 1.29,  p < 0.001,  CI  0.99,  1.60)  than  in 
autistic  participants  (b = 0.47,  p < 0.001,  CI  0.21,  0.73). 
These effects were independent of depression (positively 
associated  with  each  facet  of  acquired  capability),  age 
(positively associated with reduced fear of death), and sex 
(see Additional file 1).

The  model  predicting 
lifetime  suicide  attempts 
(R2 = 0.34, F [12, 613] = 26.63, p < 0.001) was contributed 
to  by  higher  lifetime  incidence  of  NSSI  (path  c’,  which 
was  significant  in  both  groups  [b = 0.10,  p = 0.0012, 
CI  0.04,  0.15]),  reduced  fear  of  death  (path   b2:  b = 0.04, 
p = 0.0072,  CI  0.01,  0.07),  mental  rehearsal  of  suicide 
(path  b3: b = 0.03, p = 0.0076, CI 0.01, 0.05), and depres-
sion  (b = 0.02,  p = 0.0049,  CI  0.01,  0.03).  While  greater 
lifetime incidence of NSSI predicted higher lifetime sui-
cide attempts independent of the mediators (i.e. directly), 
it  also  exerts  two  indirect  effects.  In  the  first,  a  higher 
frequency of NSSI predicted higher suicide attempts via 
reduced  fear  of  death  by  suicide,  an  effect  significant  in 
both autistic (b = 0.01, bootstrapped CI 0.0007, 0.03) and 
non-autistic  participants  (b = 0.02,  bootCI  0.01,  0.03). 
Higher frequency of NSSI also predicted suicide attempts 
via  higher  mental  rehearsal  of  suicide  plans;  while  this 
was significant for both autistic (b = 0.01, bootCI 0.0007, 
0.02)  and  non-autistic  participants  (b = 0.03,  bootCI 
0.02,  0.05),  a  significant  index  of  moderated  mediation 
(b = -0.02,  bootCI  -0.05,  -0.00)  showed  that  the  indirect

Part 2: Types and features of NSSI as predictors of acquired 
capability and suicidality
Scratching

For autistic participants, scratching was not significantly 
associated  with  any  of  the  three  sequential  mediators 
in  the  model.  While  average  pain  during  NSSI  (the  first 
mediator) did not predict habituation (second mediator) 
or  indeed  acquired  capability  (the  third  mediator),  the 

expected relationship between habituation and acquired 
capability  was  observed  (b = 0.83,  p = 0.0032,  CI  0.28, 
1.39). Of additional interest was the effect of depression 
as  a  covariate  which  predicted  greater  endorsement  of 
habituation to NSSI (b = 0.18, p < 0.001, CI 0.12, 0.23) and 
higher  acquired  capability  (b = 0.51,  p < 0.001,  CI  0.27, 
0.75).  Only  acquired  capability,  however,  significantly 
predicted lifetime suicide attempts (b = 0.04, p < 0.001, CI 
0.02, 0.05; R2 = 0.14, F [5, 214] = 7.22, p < 0.001), with no 
direct or indirect effects of scratching. The data for non-
autistic participants showed exactly the same picture (see 
Additional file 1).

Cutting

Though  cutting  was  not  associated  with  greater  pain 
experienced  during  NSSI  for  autistic  participants,  the 
association  between  cutting  and  habituation  (b = 0.98, 
p = 0.0131,  CI  0.21,  1.75)  was  at  the  borderline  of  our 
adjusted  alpha  value  (p < 0.0125).  Endorsement  of  cut-
ting  was  associated  with  acquired  capability  (b = 5.68, 
p = 0.0005,  CI  2.52,  8.84).  Interestingly,  the  model  pre-
dicting  lifetime  suicide  attempts  was  contributed  to 
not  only  by  acquired  capability  (b = 0.03,  p = 0.0006,  CI 
0.01,  0.04;  R2 = 0.24,  F  [5,  215] = 13.48,  p < 0.001)  but 
by  cutting  as  a  direct  effect  (b = 0.96,  p < 0.001,  CI  0.60, 
1.33),  and  explained  considerably  more  of  the  variance 
in  lifetime  suicide  attempts  as  compared  to  the  preced-
ing  model  with  scratching  as  a  predictor.  In  addition  to 
predicting lifetime suicide attempts directly, cutting exert 
one  (albeit  very  weak)  indirect  effect  on  lifetime  suicide 
attempts  via  habituation  and  then  acquired  capability 
sequentially (b = 0.02, bootCI 0.001, 0.04), and a stronger 
one  via  acquired  capability  alone  (b = 0.15,  bootCI  0.04, 
0.30):  these  pathways  are  summarised  in  Fig.  2  part  A. 
For  non-autistic  participants,  cutting  was  associated 
with  lifetime  suicide  attempts  directly  and  indirectly  via 
habituation and then acquired capability sequentially (see 
Additional file 1).

Self‑hitting

The  last  specific  form  of  NSSI,  endorsement  of  self-
(b = 1.07, 
hitting,  was  associated  with  habituation 
p = 0.0059,  CI  0.31,  1.82)  and  acquired  capability 
(b = 4.77,  p = 0.0031,  CI  1.62,  7.92)  in  autistic  partici-
pants. It was not directly associated with lifetime suicide 
attempts  but  did  exert  two  indirect  effects:  one  through 
habituation  and  then  acquired  capability  sequentially 
(b = 0.03, bootCI 0.002, 0.06), and one through acquired 
capability alone (b = 0.18, bootCI 0.05, 0.32), as depicted 
in  Fig.  2  part  B.  For  non-autistic  participants,  hitting 
oneself  was  indirectly  associated  with  lifetime  suicide 
attempts  via  the  same  two  routes  as  in  autistic  partici-
pants (see Additional file 1).

Range of NSSI behaviours

Our  final  analyses  focussed  on  the  range  or  number  of 
different  NSSI  behaviours  participants  engaged  in.  For 
autistic  participants,  a  higher  range  of  behaviours  was 
associated with greater habituation (b = 0.31, p = 0.0001, 
CI  0.16,  0.46),  higher  scores  in  acquired  capability 
(b = 1.46, p < 0.001, CI 0.82, 2.10), and directly predicted 
a  higher  number  of  suicide  attempts  (b = 0.19,  p < 0.001, 
CI  0.11,  0.27).  In  addition  to  directly  predicting  lifetime 
suicide attempts, a higher range of NSSI behaviours was 
associated  with  suicide  attempts  indirectly  via  acquired 
capability (b = 0.04, bootCI 0.01, 0.07), as shown in Fig. 2 

part C. Precisely, the same pattern of results was seen in 
non-autistic participants (see Additional file 1), alongside 
an additional indirect effect of a range of NSSI via habitu-
ation and acquired capability sequentially.

Discussion
The  aims  of  the  present  investigation  were  twofold.  Pri-
marily, we attempted to examine whether the established 
relationship between NSSI and suicide attempts in autis-
tic people [30, 31] was explained by the acquired capabil-
ity  for  suicide,  and  to  compare  the  nature  and  strength 
of these relationships in autistic and non-autistic people. 
Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether certain forms 
or  methods  of  NSSI  were  especially  associated  with 
acquired  capability  through  these  suicide  attempts,  and 
whether  it  was  the  features  of  certain  methods,  in  this 
case pain inflicted and habituation, which mediated their 
relationship  with  acquired  capability  and  with  suicide 
attempts.

Acquired capability as a bridge from NSSI to suicide

Since the original conception of acquired capability for 
suicide [32,  33], NSSI was highlighted as a particularly 
potent  means  of  eroding  an  individual’s  natural  fear 
of  pain,  and  thus  their  fear  of  attempting  suicide.  In 
accordance  with  our  three-factor  conceptualisation  of 
this  construct  [44],  relationships  have  been  observed, 
in  the  general  population,  between  NSSI  and  reduced 
fear of death [49], increased mental rehearsal of suicide 
plans  [39],  and  greater  tolerance  for  pain  [65,  66].  As 
there is little research on acquired capability for suicide 
in  autistic  people,  let  alone  its  relationship  with  NSSI, 
our  first  analysis  distilled  the  construct  and  examined 
its three facets as mediators of the relationship between 
the  lifetime  incidence  of  NSSI  and  lifetime  suicide 
attempts. As per the aforementioned literature, our data 
corroborated relationships between higher incidence of 
NSSI and each facet of acquired capability. In similarity 
with the developers of the three-factor model [44], our 
two  groups  showed  indirect  effects  of  NSSI  on  more 
numerous  lifetime  suicide  attempts  through  the  medi-
ators  of  mental  rehearsal  and  reduced  fear  of  death. 
While the pathways between NSSI, acquired capability, 
and lifetime suicide attempts appeared to operate simi-
larly  between  the  two  groups,  two  moderation  effects 
of diagnosis revealed that autistic status was associated 
with  a  weaker  relationship  between  lifetime  NSSI  and 
mental  rehearsal,  and  a  weaker  indirect  pathway  from 
NSSI to suicide attempts via mental rehearsal. We sus-
pect that both examples of weaker behavioural contin-
gencies  reflect  greater  mental  rehearsal  and  reduced 
fear  of  death  in  the  autistic  group  (two  main  effects), 
irrespective  of  their  engagement  in  NSSI.  Our  findings

(independent predictors). Only results from the autistic group are depicted here

somewhat contradict those of one previous study [52], 
which found no group differences between autistic and 
non-autistic  people  in  relation  to  fear  of  death;  how-
ever,  they  are  consistent  with  the  greater  exposure  of 
autistic  people  to  physically  painful  and  emotionally 
provocative events across their lifespans [67–69].

Two findings stood in contrast to the traditional under-
standing  of  acquired  capability  [33].  The  first  of  these 
was  the  lack  of  association  between  greater  pain  toler-
ance  and  lifetime  suicide  attempts  in  both  groups.  It  is 
highly possible that this reflects a disconnection between 
our  two-item  self-report  measure  and  pain  tolerance  in 
naturalistic  settings,  and/or  between  pain  reported  in 

 Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2022) 13:45 

Page 10 of 16

the present day and past suicide attempts. However, this 
finding  actually  corroborates  broader  scepticism  around 
the  relationship  between  pain  tolerance  and  suicide  and 
the  inclusion  of  this  facet  within  the  acquired  capability 
construct. Pain tolerance is the least specific and reliable 
differentiator  of  suicide  attempts  from  suicide  ideation 
[56],  with  some  studies  even  finding  lower  pain  toler-
ance  in  individuals  who  had  attempted  suicide  [70,  71]. 
It is possible that these findings reflect real-world nuance 
which  is  difficult  or  impossible  to  capture  experimen-
tally, as might be the case if pain tolerance influenced an 
individual’s choice of approach to a suicide attempt [71]. 
However, while the original conceptualisation of pain tol-
erance assumed this variable could only increase mono-
tonically or stay stable, recent literature reflects that pain 
perception  is  influenced  by  numerous  psychological 
variables [72], that it fluctuates across NSSI episodes and 
over time in its relation to perceived capability for suicide 
[70, 73]. The present study corroborates the unreliability 
of  pain  tolerance  as  a  supposed  prerequisite  for  suicide 
attempts.

A  second  finding  contrary  to  the  proposed  role  of 
acquired  capability  within  the  ideation-to-action  trajec-
tory  [33]  was  the  presence  of  a  direct  effect  of  lifetime 
NSSI  on  lifetime  suicide  attempts.  While  it  contradicts 
theory, this finding is in fact again consistent with other 
empirical  observations  of  direct  associations  between 
NSSI and suicide attempts in the general population [40, 
43,  74]. There  are,  at  least,  two  potential  interpretations 
of  this  direct  effect.  Firstly,  it  may  reflect  the  need  for  a 
more  multifaceted  concept  of  “suicide  capability”  [37, 
75–77],  which,  fluctuating  over  time,  could  incorporate 
“baseline”  capability  (relatively  static  dispositional  fac-
tors, such as genetically high pain threshold and low fear 
of death) as well as dynamic and situational factors (such 
as access to means [56, 78, 79], recent exposure to suicide 
attempts  in  others  [75,  80]).  Ribeiro  and  colleagues  [81] 
note that although in a broad and logical sense the desire 
and capability to attempt suicide are necessary prerequi-
sites for suicide attempts, our highly specific operational-
isation of this desire and this capability do not, at present, 
sufficiently  capture  the  complexity  of  these  multitudi-
nous  variables  and  their  interactions  over  time—hence 
why  even  in  longitudinal  investigations,  suicide  capabil-
ity only explains a small degree of the variance in suicide 
attempts.

However, the second interpretation of this finding sug-
gests we need to look further beyond acquired or broader 
suicide  capability  to  understand  alternative  means 
through which NSSI might influence suicide risk. Firstly, 
NSSI is associated with thwarted belongingness and per-
ceived  burdensomeness  [38,  82,  83],  both  of  which  the 
Interpersonal  Theory  of  Suicide  asserts  are  necessary 

for  suicide  desire/ideation  [32,  33].  While  NSSI  is  asso-
ciated  with  poorer  interpersonal  problem-solving  [84] 
and  interpersonal  distress  [85],  it  has  been  suggested  to 
exacerbate these states and may thus contribute to suicide 
ideation [38, 82, 83], which would be a necessary propel-
lant  for  suicide  capability  to  enable  a  suicide  attempt. 
Similarly,  although  NSSI  is  associated  with  intolerance 
for psychological pain and negative affect [86–88], some 
suggest it may exacerbate psychological pain by preclud-
ing the development of more effective coping strategies, 
such  that  individuals  are  vulnerable  to  suicide  in  a  sce-
nario  where  NSSI  fails  to  provide  adequate  escape  [40, 
43]. Of course, while NSSI may contribute to or exacer-
bate these states, an alternative interpretation lies in the 
possibility  that  these  and  other  variables  could  operate 
as  hidden  factors  in  the  relationship  between  NSSI  and 
suicidality: “third” variables which, shared by both, might 
give  rise  to  the  appearance  of  a  relationship  between 
the  two.  For  instance,  in  autistic  populations,  cognitive 
inflexibility [89, 90] rumination [91] and alexithymia [22, 
92]  have  been  highlighted  as  potential  factors  in  NSSI 
and suicidal behaviour (as well as broader psychopathol-
ogy),  perhaps  in  part  because  they  preclude  adaptive 
means of problem-solving and emotion regulation. In the 
general population, psychopathology has been suggested 
to  wholly  or  partially  mediate  links  between  NSSI  and 
thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness and 
suicide ideation [40, 82], and to explain unique variance 
in  suicide  attempts  over  and  above  contributions  from 
thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and 
acquired capability [93, 94].

It  is  likely,  given  their  differences  in  pain  perception 
[95–97]  and  lifetime  experiences  [67–69],  that  the  rel-
evance  and  importance  of  suicide  capability  facets  dif-
fer  between  autistic  and  non-autistic  populations,  just 
as the stability and rate at which capability develops may 
also differ. As both mental rehearsal and reduced fear of 
death  partially  mediated  relationships  with  lifetime  sui-
cide attempts, it remains an important research target in 
autistic people. However, a comprehensive exploration of 
links  between  NSSI  and  suicide  must  incorporate  addi-
tional  factors  beyond  even  the  broader  scope  of  suicide 
capability  and  must  accommodate  the  element  of  inde-
terminacy,  the  reality  that  different  combinations  and 
interactions  of  factors  can  give  rise  to  the  same  behav-
ioural outcome [81, 98].

Specific types and features of NSSI in relation to acquired 
capability and suicide attempts

On  the  assumption  that  an  association  does  indeed 
exist  between  NSSI  and  later  suicide  risk,  and  that  this 
connection  is  partially  related  to  suicide  capability,  an 
important question is whether different NSSI behaviours 

Moseley et al. Molecular Autism           (2022) 13:45 

Page 11 of 16

differentially  create  suicide  capability  and  whether  they 
do  so  in  a  broad  sense  or  only  in  relation  to  certain 
methods  of  suicide  [74].  Having  previously  observed  a 
particular  relationship  between  suicidality  and  cutting 
in  autistic  people  [31],  we  examined  this  and  two  other 
common  NSSI  behaviours  in  the  light  of  features  which 
might  mark  them  as  particularly  worrisome  in  terms  of 
acquired capability and future suicidality, most notably in 
relation  to  violence,  painfulness  and  tissue  damage  [33, 
46, 49, 51]. Our mediation models examined the effect of 
each behaviour on lifetime suicide attempts as mediated 
by three sequential mediators: average pain experienced 
during  NSSI,  the  extent  to  which  individuals  reported 
habituating  to  NSSI,  and  acquired  capability  as  a  whole 
construct. As we could not statistically compare autistic 
and  non-autistic  participants,  differences  between  these 
sets of analysis may not be meaningful. We will therefore 
focus solely on autistic participants.

Interestingly,  our  binary  endorsement  of  cutting  and 
our continuous measure reflecting a range of NSSI behav-
iours behaved very similarly as variables: both were asso-
ciated with habituation (albeit at trend level for cutting) 
and  acquired  capability;  both  directly  predicted  suicide 
attempts  as  well  as  exerting  indirect  effects  via  habitua-
tion  and  acquired  capability  sequentially,  while  cutting 
also exert an indirect effect via acquired capability alone. 
This  is  consistent  with  the  previous  literature  examin-
ing  these  two  predictors  in  non-autistic  people.  Among 
individual NSSI behaviours, cutting is particularly painful 
and provides immediate and lasting visual proof of physi-
cal  damage,  which  is  an  important  element  of  NSSI  for 
some people [99–101]. It also straightforwardly approxi-
mates one means of suicide which could be reached by an 
escalation of the same behaviour, such that it is a potent 
means  of  increasing  pain  tolerance  and  reducing  fear  of 
pain and death [46, 102, 103]. Just as cutting has indeed 
been  especially  associated  with  acquired  capability  [33, 
104] and with suicide attempts in the general population 
[49–51],  so  too  is  there  a  robust  relationship  between 
diversity of NSSI behaviours and suicide attempts [8, 47, 
105].  Theoretically,  exposure  to  diverse  methods  would 
be predicted to result in an increased likelihood of habit-
uation  to  a  range  of  behaviours  and  types  of  pain  [46, 
105]:  while  its  association  with  self-reported  pain  toler-
ance is inconsistent [40], NSSI range is indeed associated 
with  reduced  fear  of  death  [40,  43,  45,  48],  and  greater 
acquired  capability  as  a  whole  [104].  In  our  data,  the 
existence of a direct effect of both cutting and NSSI range 
on lifetime suicide attempts is an important indication of 
other  variables  which  might  explain  these  relationships. 
In non-autistic people who self-injure, both of these pre-
dictors  have  been  linked  to  more  severe  psychopathol-
ogy,  greater  emotion  regulation  difficulties,  and  poorer 

impulse  control  [45–47,  104,  106];  the  increased  versa-
tility  associated  with  a  range  of  behaviours  may  reflect 
increased need, willingness and ability to engage in NSSI 
even  when  preferred  means  are  inaccessible  [46].  We 
cannot here determine the nature of this direct effect, but 
our findings are suggestive of extra risk of suicide associ-
ated  with  cutting  and  with  engagement  in  diverse  NSSI 
behaviours in autistic as in non-autistic people.

Interestingly,  self-hitting  influenced  lifetime  suicide 
attempts  only  via  acquired  capability,  thus  conforming 
most closely to original ideas around this construct [33]. 
Self-hitting has received less experimental attention than 
other forms of NSSI, in part because it tends to occur as 
one of a repertoire rather than as a singular NSSI behav-
iour  [50,  104].  In  non-autistic  adolescents,  Somer  et  al. 
[107]  did  identify  a  group  that  primarily  engaged  in 
self-hitting. They  likened  this  group  to  latent  subgroups 
described as “mild” or “moderate NSSI” in other samples 
[106, 108, 109], having a lower likelihood of psychologi-
cal distress or psychopathology, lower likelihood of past 
suicide attempts and lower likelihood of other health risk 
behaviours  (smoking  and  drinking)  than  groups  charac-
terised by skin-cutting or diverse means of NSSI. On the 
other hand, self-hitting may be more strongly associated 
with aggression, which has its own relationship with sui-
cidality  and  acquired  capability  [50].  This  may  explain 
why  its  effect  on  suicidality  was  solely  mediated  by  this 
variable.

These  analyses  yielded  several  null  findings  and  some 
unanswered  questions  other  than  the  aforementioned 
direct  effect.  Severe  scratching  and/or  pinching  was 
unrelated to any other variables: it seems likely that this 
reflects the broad wording of this item on the NSSI-AT, 
which  could  conceivably  apply  to  behaviours  ranging  in 
painfulness and destructiveness. Pain experienced during 
NSSI was not associated with any one predictor, media-
tor  or  with  suicide  attempts  as  an  outcome.  While  this 
may  reflect  the  aforementioned  inconsistency  around 
the  role  of  pain  tolerance  in  relation  to  acquired  capa-
bility and suicide risk [56], it is further notable that this 
index reflected pain experienced during NSSI in general, 
rather than in relation to any one of these specific behav-
iours. The same is true of our measure of habituation to 
NSSI  in  general—but  interestingly,  our  analyses  of  cut-
ting  and  self-hitting  both  revealed  two  separate  indirect 
effects  of  these  predictors  on  lifetime  suicide  attempts, 
one via acquired capability alone and one via habituation 
and acquired capability sequentially (albeit much weaker 
than  the  former).  Interpretation  of  this  finding  can  only 
be speculative at present, but as habituation only affected 
suicide attempts via acquired capability rather than inde-
pendently, it is possible that this effect reflects the over-
lap between the two constructs: the habituation subscale

of the NSSI-AT might be expected to relay most closely 
to  pain  tolerance,  but  less  to  fear  of  death  or  mental 
rehearsal.  While  these  analyses  are  generally  supportive 
of a pathway from NSSI to suicide via acquired capabil-
ity,  they  corroborate  our  first  analysis  in  reflecting  the 
existence of additional mechanisms through which NSSI, 
and  particular  forms  of  NSSI,  might  influence  suicidal 
behaviours.

Limitations and future directions

The  most  prominent  limitations  of  the  present  study 
relate  to  (a)  the  study  design  and  operationalisation  of 
variables, (b) the disparity between samples, and (c) their 
limited generalisability to wider populations. As pertains 
to  the  first  of  these  points,  our  cross-sectional  design 
was ill-equipped to test causal or directional hypotheses. 
While  our  analyses  are  suggestive  of  pathways  between 
NSSI  and  lifetime  suicide  attempts  via  acquired  capa-
bility,  it  is  possible  that  capability  was  acquired  through 
suicide  attempts  as  opposed  to  preceding  them,  given 
the  increasing  ease  of  subsequent  attempts  [33,  48,  98]. 
Emerging views suggest that there are likely no necessary 
prerequisites  for  suicide  but  instead  many  possible  fac-
tors  and  combinations  of  factors,  distal  and  proximate, 
and  that  these  fluctuate  over  time  [81,  110].  Longitudi-
nal  or  semi-longitudinal  designs,  or  even  computational 
modelling  (e.g.  [98,  111,  112]  may  afford  a  clearer  pic-
ture  of  multiple  possible  pathways  from  NSSI  to  sui-
cide,  including  any  causal  contributions  from  acquired 
capability.

Relatedly,  our  operationalisation  of  key  variables  may 
have  been  inadequate.  The  interpersonal  theory  of  sui-
cide  is  suggestive  of  a  “dose–response”  relationship 
between  NSSI  and  acquitted  capability,  though  this  has 
not  received  appropriate  experimental  scrutiny.  Our 
analyses relating to specific NSSI behaviours were limited 
by the use of binary variables, indicative only of the pres-
ence  or  absence  of  the  behaviour  but  not  its  frequency, 
extent  or  history;  nor  did  these  binary  variables  reflect 
how  other  variables,  like  the  type  and  intensity  of  pain, 
the presence or absence of blood, and an individual’s psy-
chological  state  during  NSSI,  might  moderate  a  process 
of  acquiring  suicide  capability  [8,  113].  Our  operation-
alisation  of  pain  typically  experienced  during  NSSI,  and 
the pain subscale of the ACWRSS, was likely inadequate. 
Indeed, there is presently no consensus around the opti-
mal assessment of acquired capability in any population 
[56, 57]. The present study adopted a broader concept of 
acquired  capability  than  previous  investigations  which 
focussed mainly or solely on the reduced feature of death 
[52,  53],  but  all  used  measurement  tools  designed  for 
non-autistic samples. Quite simply, the scope and nature 
of  suicide  capability  is  still  unknown  in  autistic  people, 

as is how it may interact with other autistic features. For 
instance, with better operationalisation of pain tolerance, 
it is possible that sensory sensitivities could differentially 
impact  the  contribution  of  this  variable  to  suicidality  in 
autistic people.

The  strength  of  our  conclusions  is  limited  by  several 
issues  concerning  sampling  and  recruitment.  Firstly,  we 
did  not  clinically  validate  self-reported  autism  diagno-
sis or lack of autism diagnosis in the comparison group, 
relying on self-report only. Potentially greater issues lie in 
both the disparity between our samples and their gener-
alisability to autistic and non-autistic populations. While 
we attempted to control for age and for sex in group com-
parisons,  our  groups  occupied  different  lifespan  stages: 
non-autistic participants as emerging adults, and autistic 
participants as approaching or navigating midlife. While 
little  is  known  about  changes  in  suicidal  behaviour  and 
NSSI  across  autistic  lifespans,  we  know  that  the  nature 
of NSSI and suicidal behaviour varies across the lives of 
non-autistic people [114–117]. Our efforts to statistically 
control  for  age  were  indubitably  inadequate  as  a  means 
of  counteracting  the  different  life  experiences  and  per-
spectives  of  the  groups,  weakening  the  validity  of  these 
comparisons.

With regards generalisability, our convenience sample 
of  non-autistic  undergraduates  furthermore  comprises 
a  very  specific  cohort  unrepresentative  of  the  non-
autistic  population  generally  [118].  Our  autistic  sam-
ple, too, is unrepresentative of many individuals within 
the autistic community. Those under- or unrepresented 
here  include  individuals  with  poor  computer  literacy; 
those  with  severe  intellectual  and/or  communication 
impairments;  individuals  belonging  to  ethnic  minority 
groups; and individuals with non-binary or transgender 
identities. Furthermore, a sampling bias may have been 
introduced  if  the  study  was  more  salient  to  those  with 
a history of NSSI, suicide ideation or suicide attempts. 
Unusually for autism research, our sample was strongly 
skewed  in  favour  of  cisgender  autistic  women.  The 
majority  would  be  classified  as  “late-diagnosed”,  with 
only  15  participants  diagnosed  at  or  below  the  age 
of  7  (a  cut-off  suggested  in  one  recent  study  [119]). 
As  reflected  in  their  qualifications,  they  likely  corre-
sponded to a profile with fair-to-strong camouflage and 
compensation  abilities,  more  normative  verbal  style, 
and  possibly  stronger  executive  function  than  others 
within  the  autistic  spectrum  [120–122].  Individuals 
with  this  profile  seem  disproportionately  represented 
in  studies  which  recruit  via  social  media  or  other 
online  methods  [123,  124].  As  this  is  the  approach 
adopted by the present study and several others in this 
relatively  young  field  [22,  30,  31,  52–54],  findings  are 
likely unrepresentative of all within the diverse autistic

community.  It  is  possible,  given  the  differences  noted 
between  late-  and  early-diagnosed  samples  in  mental 
health  and  wellbeing  [125,  126],  that  risk  and  protec-
tive  factors  for  NSSI,  suicidality  and  psychopathology 
differ as a function of age at diagnosis. The topography 
of NSSI and its relation to psychopathology and suicide 
risk  remains  an  important  target  for  future  research, 
which could adopt more tailored recruitment strategies 
for underrepresented groups (e.g. [127]).

Conclusions
Our findings suggest that acquired capability for suicide, 
most notably reduced fear of death and mental rehearsal 
of  suicide  plans,  partially  mediates  the  relationship 
between  NSSI  (and  specific  forms  of  NSSI)  and  more 
numerous  lifetime  suicide  attempts.  While  this  finding 
is  poignant  given  the  higher  levels  of  acquired  capabil-
ity in the autistic sample (along with weaker behavioural 
contingency  with  NSSI),  the  emergence  of  direct  effects 
between NSSI and lifetime suicide attempts indicates that 
additional mechanisms underpin this association. In that 
relationships between NSSI, suicidality, acquired capabil-
ity  and  other  potential  mediators  may  operate  bidirec-
tionally,  longitudinal  and/or  computational  designs  may 
afford greater insight into stable and innate, accumulated 
and  dynamic  risk  factors  which  could  give  rise  to  NSSI, 
suicidality  and  other  deleterious  outcomes  in  autistic 
people.
