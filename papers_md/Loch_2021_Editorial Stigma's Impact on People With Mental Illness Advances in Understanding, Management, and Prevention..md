Stigma’s Impact on People With Mental Illness: Advances in Understanding, Management,
and Prevention

The stigma toward mental illness is a persistent problem. Stemming from our tribal necessity
to separate “them” from “us” to increase our belonging to a certain group, stigma endures
and transmutes itself across time. From the witch hunts in the XVI and XVII centuries to the
vanishing of the term hysteria from diagnostic manuals, the prejudice related to mental illness’
stigma assume diverse forms (Loch and Wang, 2012). Increasing eﬀorts have been carried out
to understand and reduce it, reﬂected in an escalating number of works published on the issue
in the international literature in the past 20 years. Nevertheless, still in the present days people
with mental disorders continue to suﬀer with distorted opinions and prejudiced attitudes coming
from a multitude of sources. For example, patients netative attitudes directed to own’s mental
illness (self-stigma) ﬁgures as an frequent cause of avoidance to help-seeking (Loch et al., 2013).
Other one of these sources of stigma are mental health professionals (Schnyder et al., 2017; Valery
and Prouteau, 2020). These gatekeepers should be addressed regarding prejudiced opinions, for
they could act as important barriers preventing people with mental illness from seeking adequate
help for their general health issues (Clement et al., 2015). In this sense, Wu et al. examined
stigmatizing attitudes in non-mental health professionals in several Chinese hospitals. Authors
found that most professionals held prejudiced opinions toward people with mental illness. Their
beliefs were informed predominantly by mass-media information—one of the greatest sources of
misinformation, responsible for perpetuating stereotypes related to psychiatric disorders. This was
also observed in non-psychiatry doctors and in medical students in Portugal in the study conducted
by Oliveira et al. This reinforces the idea that the struggle between “insiders” and “outsiders” is still
taking place. And the label of “mentally ill” —evoking the idea of pathological behavioral changes
and “madness” in people’s common belief—would constitute a vulnerability to an outsider status.
The insider vs. outsider segregation is particularly depicted by Martinez’s et al. interesting results,
showing that immigrant status was the only variable signiﬁcantly related to personal depression
stigma in adolescents in Chile and Colombia.

These results update and integrate a large corpus of research that nourishes puissant gold-
standart tools to ﬁght stigma: information, contact and protest (Corrigan and Penn, 1999).

Editorial: Progressing Management, Understanding, and Prevention

Information to dismantle biased and distorted public
beliefs about mental
illness. Contact—with individuals with
psychiatric disorders—should further demystify negative
stereotypes attached to those with mental disorders. And
protest/empowerment should make people with the disorders
deny currently circulating stereotypes and make them ﬁght for
their rights—ﬁght public and structural stigma seen in mental
healthcare delivery, for instance. However, it seems that stigma
resists even to high-proﬁle national campaigns employing these
powerful tools. Walsh and Foster address this issue in depth
in their work “Why do the public resist eﬀorts to challenge
mental health related stigma? A critical review of public health
campaigns.” Authors discuss the social processes which “Other”
individuals with experiences of mental illness, taking a closer
look into these campaigns and suggesting possible subtle
mechanisms that might be undermining their eﬀectiveness.

At last, we bring then to the reader of our Research Topic
works on promising interventions delivering diverse ways to
ﬁght stigma. One of the greatest issues feeding self-stigma and
causing stress for those with psychiatric disorders is the diagnosis’
secrecy. In this sense, Modelli et al. present an interesting
adaptation of the Honest-Open-Proud (HOP) protocol to the
Brazilian context. The HOP-based program addressed the stigma
and stress related to disclosing or not one’s diagnosis of mood
disorder and was accessed through a controlled trial. Depressed
individuals under the intervention group improved in their
perception of stigma as a stress, and depressed and bipolar
individuals improved in their feelings of authenticity. As to
accurate information to reduce stigma, Ueda et al. conducted
an educational program with schoolteachers consisting in a 50-
min video lesson designed to improve mental health literacy. It
was eﬃcacious in improving knowledge in mental disorders, and
improved teachers’ intention to assist students with depression.
in decreasing the stigma
Surprisingly,

it was not successful

toward mental illness per se. Likewise, Tan et al. showed the
eﬃcacy of a knowledge-contact-based intervention in improving
university students’ stigma. 309 students had to attend an one-
oﬀ intervention which comprised a lecture on depression and
personal contact with a person with lived experience of mental
illness. After the intervention, their recognition of depression
and help-seeking preferences improved, suggesting this brief tool
as an important one to tackle stigma as a barrier to treatment.
Focusing on the main stakeholders to understand stigmatization
mechanisms and individuals’ empowerment, Ong et al. employed
focus group discussions with 42 individuals with mental illness to
analyze their experience with stigma. Public and structural stigma
were the main themes that emerged in participant’s everyday
life. However, 4 themes regarding participant’s strategy do reduce
stigma were also identiﬁed: non-disclosure of condition, standing
up for themselves, individual eﬀorts in raising awareness, and
improving themselves and live life as per normal. The three last
ones are prototypical of what should be employed by people with
mental disorders: stereotype disconﬁrmation, empowerment
and protest.

By bringing this state-of-the art Research Topic, we wish to
inform the reader about the several aspects of stigma. Our goal
is to provide insights so that the reader can echo our concern
and embrace our cause in reducing the suﬀering of people with
psychiatric disorders. Fighting the stigma of mental illness is like
catching a ﬁsh with one’s own hands: it’s tricky, slippery. One
needs to employ the right tools and have the right information
to do so in a way that eﬀectively works.
