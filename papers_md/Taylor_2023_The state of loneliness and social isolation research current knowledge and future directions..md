Abstract
In this editorial, we consider the current state of loneliness and social isolation research around the world, including 
knowledge gaps in the empirical literature.

Main text
For centuries, scholars have examined how social condi-
tions influence human relationships and how these rela-
tionships  influence  health—from  cell  to  society  [1,  2]. 
Two  important  features  of  research  on  social  relation-
ships  include  loneliness  and  social  isolation.  Loneliness 
is  defined  as  a  perceived/subjective  condition  in  which 
an individual is dissatisfied with the quality and/or quan-
tity of their social relationships [3]. Social isolation is an 
objective  condition  characterized  by  a  lack  of  contact 
with other people and being disengaged from groups and 
social  activities  [3].  Loneliness  and  social  isolation  are 
sometimes misconstrued as the same phenomena in pub-
lic discourse and media; however, previous research has 
shown they are distinct psychosocial constructs that are

weakly  to  moderately  correlated  with  each  other  [3].  As 
a  result,  it  is  possible  to  be  lonely  and  socially  isolated, 
lonely but not isolated, and isolated but not lonely. Addi-
tionally,  loneliness  and  social  isolation  are  mechanisti-
cally associated with different health outcomes [4].

Findings  from  empirical  studies  indicate  increases 
in  loneliness  and/or  social  isolation  are  independently 
associated  with  poorer  health  [5].  Loneliness  and  social 
isolation have a mortality risk similar to cigarette smok-
ing, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and obesity. 
Other health outcomes associated with these pernicious 
conditions include cardiovascular disease, dementia and 
cognitive  decline,  and  worsening  anxiety  and  depres-
sive symptoms to name a few [5]. Perhaps most notable 
about  this  research  is  the  consistency  of  findings,  espe-
cially given the multitude of methods in operationalizing 
loneliness and social isolation, and the diversity of popu-
lations  and  contexts/settings  in  which  these  issues  are 
studied [5].

Rates  of  loneliness  and  social  isolation  vary  around 
the  world.  A  recent  meta-analysis  on  country-level  dif-
ferences  found  loneliness  in  adolescents  was  lowest  in 
Southeast Asian countries and highest in Eastern Medi-
terranean  countries  [6].  From  within  Europe,  loneliness 
was  highest  in  Eastern  European  countries  and  lowest 
in Northern European countries [6]. Lim and colleagues 
[7] found 34% of adults in Australia were lonely, with 21%

having episodic loneliness and 13% having chronic lone-
liness.  In  the  United  States,  43%  of  adults  felt  they  lack 
companionship,  43%  felt  that  their  relationships  are  not 
meaningful,  43%  felt  isolated  from  others,  and  39%  no 
longer feel close to anyone [8]. There are fewer studies of 
country-level  differences  in  social  isolation  for  the  gen-
eral  population;  however,  in  Australia,  17%  of  the  gen-
eral  population  were  classified  as  socially  isolated,  with 
13% having episodic and 4% having chronic isolation [7]. 
Moreover, studies focused on the prevalence of social iso-
lation are often conducted among older adults. A recent 
Canadian  survey,  for  example,  found  approximately  one 
out  of  every  four  older  adults  were  socially  isolated  [9]. 
The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  brought  issues  of 
loneliness  and  isolation  to  the  fore,  especially  given  the 
enforcement of social distancing policies from local and 
federal governments. Evidence on the prevalence rates of 
loneliness and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic 
are mixed with some finding increased rates, and others 
finding no difference to before the pandemic [10–12].

Given the negative health outcomes and overall preva-
lence of loneliness and social isolation around the world, 
we contend these are global public health issues. In many 
countries,  there  is  investment  in  policy  to  ameliorate 
loneliness  and  social  isolation.  Notable  movements  to 
address  loneliness  and  isolation  include  the  Campaign 
to End Loneliness in the United Kingdom, Ending Lone-
liness  Together  in  Australia,  the  Foundation  for  Social 
Connection in the United States, the World Health Orga-
nization’s Social Isolation and Loneliness initiatives, and 
the Global Initiative on Loneliness and Connection [13]. 
Other countries [5] have commissioned a body of expert 
scientific  knowledge  and  policy  work  to  better  under-
stand these issues. But loneliness and social isolation are 
not issues constrained to developed countries. In preva-
lence studies, these issues occur all over the world [6, 14]; 
hence global policy and advocacy is sorely needed.

Nevertheless,  there  are  notable  gaps  in  the  loneliness 
and social isolation research literature. There is substan-
tially  less  research  on  loneliness  and  isolation  among 
certain  racial/ethnic  groups,  immigrant  communities, 
diverse  gender  identities  and  sexual  orientations,  dis-
ability  and  neurodivergent  population,  populations  with 
severe mental illness, people living in poverty, and other 
social/cultural  groups.  This  is  important  given  those  at 
the greatest social disadvantage and marginalization may 
have  the  highest  rates  of  loneliness  and  social  isolation, 
and  may  also  have  heightened  risk  for  becoming  lonely 
and/or isolated [15].

Measurement/operationalization  of 

loneliness  and 
social isolation is also a topic of debate. If loneliness and 
social  isolation  are  multidomained,  how  many  types  of 
loneliness and isolation are there? What items are impor-
tant  to  include  to  accurately  prove  the  psychometric 

reliability  and  validity  of  loneliness  and  isolation  mea-
surement  tools,  and  how  do  we  ensure  that  these  tools 
are  invariant  across  age?  How  do  we  know  if  loneliness 
and  social  isolation  are  perceived  similarly  across  cul-
tures?  What  novel  methods  exist  for  measuring  loneli-
ness and isolation? How often should we collect data on 
loneliness  and  social  isolation  in  longitudinal  studies  to 
adequately  capture  fluctuations  and  temporal  changes? 
Additionally,  there  is  limited  conceptual  and  empirical 
work  on  understanding  the  interrelationship(s)  between 
loneliness and isolation [3]. This work would be useful for 
determining the causal mechanisms in which some indi-
viduals become lonely and/or isolated, for further under-
standing  how  loneliness  and  isolation  influence  health 
and  wellbeing,  and  for  the  development  of  evidence-
based interventions to address these psychosocial issues.

Lastly, it is important to use this knowledge to inform 
policy  and  interventions.  What  type  of  interventions, 
from 
individual-focused  to  societal-level,  are  most 
impactful,  sustainable  and/or  cost-efficient?  Should  we 
use  different  types  of  interventions  for  preventing  the 
onset  of  loneliness  and  isolation  (primary  prevention) 
versus mitigating these conditions among those who are 
chronically lonely and isolated (tertiary prevention)? And 
how do we scale-up these interventions to inform applied 
clinical  or  community  practice  and  change  public  opin-
ion/perceptions on loneliness and social isolation?

The aim of the BMC Public Health collection on loneli-
ness and social isolation is to further our understanding 
of  these  psychosocial  issues.  We  hope  to  propagate  this 
collection of articles to advance research, practice, advo-
cacy,  and  policy  efforts  by  researchers,  scientists,  clini-
cians,  policy-makers,  community-based  and  non-profit 
organizations,  governments,  and  the  lay  public  around 
the world to facilitate greater social connection for better 
health and wellbeing for all.
