Abstract

This overview critically appraises literature on the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. The 
two established treatments for these conditions comprise cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
and antidepressant medications. Many youth receiving these treatments fail to achieve remission, 
which creates a need for new treatments. After summarizing the literature for CBT and current 
medications, the manuscript describes research that lays a foundation for improvements in the 
treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. This foundation leverages neuroscientific investigations 
also described in the overview, which provide insights on mechanisms of successful treatment.

Introduction

This article describes research on three pediatric anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety 
(GAD), separation anxiety (SA), and social anxiety disorders (SAD). The article considers 
these disorders as a group, because most treatment studies target them together, given their 
high prevalence and frequent comorbidity. The article omits specific phobia, the fourth 
common anxiety disorder, which manifests lower rates of persistence and impairment as 
well as better long-term outcomes than the three conditions covered in the article (1). A 
fifth diagnosis, selective mutism, often occurs comorbid with SAD. Because large clinical 
trials only include children with selective mutism when they also manifest with SAD, data 
on treatment of SAD largely apply to the treatment of selective mutism. Similarly, panic 
disorder is rare before early adulthood, and large clinical trials in youth only include this 
condition when it occurs alongside GAD, SA, or SAD. Hence, data on treatment for these 
disorders also likely apply to panic disorder.

These three pediatric anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and may cause long-term 
impairment (2). On one hand, effective treatments exist for the disorders, and many patients

manifest long-term remissions (1, 3). Longitudinal studies find that between one-third to 
one-half of youth with these anxiety disorders are free of psychopathology when evaluated 
over the next 10 years (1, 4). This provides evidence of a better prognosis than for most 
other forms of pediatric psychopathology, including autism spectrum disorders, attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder, and major depressive disorder (5). On the other hand, even 
with adequate treatment, many patients remain symptomatic; other youth relapse after robust 
initial responses; and most adults with persistent mood or anxiety disorders previously had 
manifested a pediatric anxiety disorder. Thus, clinicians confront the duality of a relatively 
good prognosis with adequate treatment for one set of youth (1, 4), existing alongside a high 
risk for chronicity in sizable groups of other youth. Clinicians approaching the treatment 
of pediatric anxiety disorders can rely on two established treatments: antidepressants and 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The first two sections of this overview summarize 
research on these established treatments and novel approaches for improving them that may 
make them more widely applicable. The overview closes by briefly outlining a path for 
finding other innovative treatments that will likely take longer to be widely applied.

The discussion of novel approaches for both relatively immediate and longer-term 
improvements in treatment leverages a robust literature on the pathophysiology of anxiety 
disorders. As reviewed elsewhere (6–12), this literature delineates the unique opportunities 
for therapeutic discovery from the melding of preclinical and clinical research, given 
strong cross-species conservation in circuitry deployed by mammals when they confront 
threats. Research on pediatric anxiety disorders finds many signs of dysfunction in this 
threat-responsive neural circuitry. Signs of such dysfunction manifest at many levels. This 
includes blood-based biomarkers such as cortisol, C-reactive protein, and interleukins that 
are sensitive to threat exposure (13), neuropsychological and psychophysiological indicators 
of information processing functions that mammals deploy in the presence of threats (9), 
as well as measures of brain structure and function implicated in the mammalian threat 
response (10, 12). Rather than providing a comprehensive review, the current paper narrowly 
describes research on pathophysiology that provides promising targets for novel treatments. 
Such research relates modifiable biomarkers to the course of anxiety disorders and describes 
preliminary evidence that attempts to alter these biomarkers for therapeutic purposes to 
enhance treatment responses in pediatric anxiety disorders.

2-  Established treatments

The current treatment of anxious youth is mostly conducted in traditional clinical settings 
where, after the diagnosis of a disorder the current treatment consists of one of three 
modalities: SSRI, CBT or combination of SSRI and CBT (see Figure 1). Table 1 summarizes 
relevant meta-analyses published in the past five years on these modalities, and this section 
highlights findings for each treatment.

2.1  Pharmacology

Pharmacological treatment represents one of two established therapies for pediatric anxiety 
disorders. Meta-analyses provide robust evidence of efficacy for virtually all selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors

(SSNIs) in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and separation 
anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
only exists for two medications, duloxetine and escitalopram, both for generalized anxiety 
disorder.

Strong evidence derives both from meta-analyses summarized in Table 1 and from notable 
individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Perhaps the most influential trial is the 
Child/Adolescents Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) (14). CAMS included 488 children 
and adolescents randomly assigned to one of four groups: monotherapy with placebo, 
sertraline, or CBT, as well as combined CBT/sertraline therapy. Treatment with sertraline 
used a flexible dosing design, with a maximal dose of 200 mg/day. For the sertraline 
monotherapy group, the effect size was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.74), and the number 
necessary to treat (NNT) was 3.2 (95% CI, 3.2 to 3.5). These results are comparable 
with results for other RCTs for SSRIs (15, 16) and SNRIs (17). Meta-analytic evidence 
summarized in Table 1 documents larger effect sizes for SSRIs than SNRIs (3, 18), with no 
clear superiority for any drug within a class. Across many pharmacological studies, worse 
treatment response relates to higher baseline symptom severity (19) and a diagnosis of social 
anxiety disorder (20). Nevertheless, despite these notable beneficial effects, fewer than half 
of patients receiving antidepressants manifest long-term remissions. In the CAMS trial, only 
approximately 20% of patients receiving any treatment displayed consistently low levels 
of anxiety over a four-year follow-up period, with no differences among treatments, and, 
in the group randomized to sertraline, only between 40 and 52% of patients manifested 
remission in any of the four yearly follow-up assessments (4). Thus, while medications 
reduce symptoms in the short term, a need exists for new therapies that might produce 
long-term remission.

The use of pharmacological treatment carries the risk of adverse effects. Behavioral 
activation is one of the most common, appearing more common in SSRIs than SNRIs. It 
typically occurs at rates below 15%. Antidepressants carry a black box warning in their 
label due to an increased risk of suicide in indivduals younger than 25. This warning stems 
from a meta-analysis of industry sponsored clinical trials that found a moderate effect 
size for suicidality (21). The reported risk in the FDA analysis was higher for treatment 
with paroxetine or venlafaxine, as compared to other antidepressants. Other data suggest 
that paroxetine may exhibit a relatively high risk for thoughts about suicide (18). Despite 
potential differences among particular medications, clinicians should still carefully monitor 
suicidality in patients receiving any SSRI or SNRI.

Other classes of medication are commonly used to treat anxiety in adults, and some 
such medications have been investigated in children and adolescents. However, these 
medications should be considered second or third-line options. Tricyclic antidepressants 
appear less effective than SSRIs while having more concerning side-effects (18). Moreover, 
the medications are more lethal in overdose than SSRIs and SNRIs, making them third-
line options. Similarly, benzodiazepines are prescribed due to their rapid onset of action 
and wealth of data in adults. Nevertheless, only three small RCTs exist in youth (22). 
These studies included small samples, with the largest RCT including only 30 patients 
treated with alprazolam (23). Additionally, meta-analyses provide no evidence of efficacy,

showing a small effect size and a wide confidence interval (CI) (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.4 
95%CI, [0.3–6.1]) (18). Benzodiazepines also include problematic side effects among youth, 
including a risk for disinhibition and harmful impacts on cognition. Nevertheless, given the 
underpowered nature of existing studies and notable effects in adults, it is reasonable to 
consider treatment with benzodiazepines, particularly in acute scenarios where short-term 
use is needed.

Finally, buspirone and guanfacine represent two other medications studied in RCTs with 
more than 50 patients. For buspirone, one RCT with 227 patients and another RCT with 
341 patients examined efficacy (24), whereas for guanfacine, one RCT with 83 patients 
examined efficacy (25). Across the three trials, primary efficacy analyses show no advantage 
for either medication. Nevertheless, both medications are well-tolerated in youth and widely 
used for indications other than pediatric anxiety disorders. Moreover, secondary analyses 
provide some suggestive evidence of efficacy for both medications. Hence, both medications 
are reasonable second-line options for patients who fail to respond to multiple SSRIs or 
SNRIs.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an established first-line treatment for pediatric 
anxiety disorders, manifesting effect sizes comparable to those for antidepressants (26). 
CBT for anxiety disorders usually targets avoidance through gradual exposure to threatening 
stimuli combined with psychoeducation and the teaching of coping strategies. Many RCTs 
examine the efficacy of manual-based CBT, usually delivered across 12 to 20 sessions in 
various formats, such as group or parent-focused CBT (27). The effect size for CBT alone 
in the CAMS trial was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.02–0.59) (14), while meta-analytic evidence finds 
larger effect sizes favoring CBT over waitlist or treatment as usual (table 1). Even with 
moderate effect sizes, between half (28) and two thirds of subjects will not achieve full 
remission (29). As in pharmacological treatment, higher baseline symptoms predict worse 
treatment response, while parental psychopathology may also predict outcome in some 
settings (30). Notably CBT involves lower risk for adverse effects than medication, with no 
serious adverse effects reported in most RCTs. As a result, it is universally viewed as at least 
one of two possible first-line therapies.

CBT delivered to different age and diagnostic groups involves many similarities. The 
treatment often begins with the creation of a fear hierarchy, where the patient lists mildly 
threatening scenarios on the bottom and very frightening scenarios on the top. Next, 
the therapist teaches the patient coping strategies and other approaches that help the 
patient reduce their distress when exposed to feared situations. Finally, patients undergo 
guided exposures across the typical two-to-three-month course of therapy, where each 
session involves confronting scenarios on successively higher hierarchy levels. Beyond such 
similarities, notable differences exist in approaches to CBT among patients with distinct 
clinical presentations. With separation anxiety disorder, therapists often must work closely 
with families to craft experiences that allow graded separations from parents, whereas in 
social anxiety disorder, therapists might venture out of the office with patients, to assist 
patients performing frightening social tasks, such as purchasing a snack in a crowded

store. Unlike separation anxiety and social anxiety disorders, with GAD, patients often fear 
abstract scenarios, which may require the therapist to creatively devise effective exposure 
sessions. For example, in patients who fear failure, therapists might work with patients to 
purposely make minor errors in a homework assignment or perform an after-school activity 
below their level of proficiency. Thus, these differences in treatment reflect unique clinical 
scenarios.

2.3  Combination

More research is needed comparing SSRI and CBT monotherapy to each other and to 
combined SSRI/CBT therapy. On their own, effect sizes over control therapies across 
distinct studies appear comparable for SSRIs and CBT. However, such comparisons can be 
misleading, since medication and psychotherapy trials can recruit different types of patients 
and rely on different control therapies. Given comparable efficacy and more concern with 
adverse effects with SSRIs, some European guidelines (31) consider CBT to be the only 
first-line therapy, unlike some United States guidelines, which consider the two treatments to 
be equivalent first-line options (32). Guidelines uniformly recommend combined treatment 
in patients who fail to respond to monotherapy.

In terms of combined treatment, only two notable RCTs exist. First, CAMS found the 
combination of CBT with medication to be superior to either modality alone (14). However, 
patients who received combination treatment were told that they were randomized to active 
medication, and no patient groups received CBT with placebo augmentation. Only patients 
randomized to either sertraline or placebo monotherapy received blinded therapy. Hence, 
combined treatment’s superiority could reflect expectancy as opposed to particular effects 
of SSRIs. Second, consistent with this possibility, another study compared the combination 
of CBT with SSRI augmentation to CBT with placebo augmentation, in an attempt to 
equilibrate between-condition expectancy. Unlike CAMS, in this study, the outcome for 
youth receiving CBT with an SSRI was no better than for youth receiving CBT with placebo 
(26).

As a result stronger effects in CAMS could reflect design issues or differences in sample 
size, and more research that controls for expectancy with combination treatment is needed. 
Nevertheless, the effect size in the more recent study equating expectancy was small, 
suggesting the need for very large sample sizes in future studies (26). Regardless, when 
expectancies of improvement are equalized, data suggest that SSRI addition to CBT may 
provide no benefit over CBT. Hence, many clinicians begin treatment with CBT, and 
augment the treatment with medication in cases where there is no adequate clinical response 
after a period of approximately eight-to-12 weeks.

3-  Near-term improvements in treatment outcomes

Figure 1 highlights current treatments and approaches for improving them using approaches 
summarized in Table 2. We discuss three promising avenues for generating near-term 
improvements in the treatment of anxiety disorders. One avenue extends the reach of 
available treatments. A second applies precision-medicine approaches, and the final avenue 
leverages research on mechanisms to be targeted by novel therapies.

3.1  Extending Available Treatments

Established approaches exist for maximizing the impact of established treatments. These 
include techniques for leveraging technology and for reducing the burden faced by primary 
care providers and educators. As discussed below, a final approach focuses on prevention to 
interrupt, early in the course of a developmental cascade, processes that can generate chronic 
emotional problems.

Technology provides unique opportunities for addressing the needs of youth with anxiety 
disorders. Considerable research suggests that technology can increase the availability of 
CBT and other forms of therapy. Meta-analyses of RCTs for internet-delivered therapy are 
summarized in Table 2; the table considers treatment of various conditions given the paucity 
of RCTs focused specifically on pediatric anxiety disorders. Studies summarized in Table 
2 generate two conclusions (33). First, comparable levels of efficacy might be achieved by 
using technology to deliver CBT in patients’ homes, as compared to the clinic. Second, 
some level of regular therapist contact appears necessary to achieve such efficacy.

If results in future studies confirm existing research, the standard of care may one day 
involve having patients conduct some facets of CBT while being directly monitored by a 
therapist and conduct other facets on their own with the aid of technology. Extending this 
approach from research settings to the clinic could rapidly increase therapist availability, if 
other limitations in existing work could be addressed. For example, current studies often 
use a control group of “treatment as usual” or waitlist. Although data in adults indicate that 
internet delivered CBT may be as effective as face-to-face (34), more large, well designed 
studies are needed in children and adolescents that directly compare CBT delivered via 
telehealth to face-to-face therapy.

Beyond increasing availability of established treatments, technology provides other 
opportunities for improvement. Studies in adults suggest that therapeutic processes can 
be monitored using technology in ways that identify barriers to successful CBT outcomes 
(35). Studies in youth find that better clinical outcomes occur following specific types of 
therapeutic encounters, such as exposure sessions involving sustained threat confrontation 
(36). Future research might integratively extend these two observations by using technology 
to monitor therapeutic processes related to clinical outcomes in pediatric anxiety disorders. 
With such technology, patients, families, and clinicians might monitor the engagement of 
processes that predict remission. Finally, mobile technology provides other opportunities 
through real-time, multi-day monitoring of multiple parameters. Later sections of this review 
describe therapeutic research that targets mechanisms. Wearable devices may facilitate 
such work by providing abundant data on physiology, sleep patterns, as well as avoidance 
and other facets of physical activity that may reflect a treatment’s impact on a targeted 
mechanism.

Independent of technology, another opportunity for advancing treatment outcomes leverages 
patients’ regular contact with pediatricians and educators. Considerable research confirms 
pediatricians’ ability to identify anxiety disorders, which supports recent recommendations 
for in-office anxiety screening during routine well-child visits (37). Enhancing the capacity 
for in-office treatment delivery could improve outcomes. Among adults, CBT delivered

in primary care settings, relative to a control intervention, produces greater reductions in 
anxiety symptoms that persists for at least 18 months (9, 38). Some research begins to 
extend this approach to pediatric anxiety disorders (37, 39, 40). However, large-scale RCTs 
are needed to test whether the embedding of services within primary care settings produces 
long-term reductions in pediatric anxiety as it does in adult anxiety disorders. Much like 
pediatricians, educators also can identify pediatric anxiety disorders, and RCTs already 
document the efficacy of CBT delivered in school settings (41, 42). While more work is 
needed to confirm efficacy comparable to traditional forms of CBT (43), offering CBT in 
schools might help participants access treatment while lowering the associated cost and 
burden. School-based treatment also could represent one component of stepped-care, where 
youth who fail to respond or who manifest severe problems are referred to specialized 
services (40).

A final approach for extending the impact of available treatments utilizes prevention. 
Pediatric anxiety disorders represent an intermediate step on a developmental cascade that 
involves early-life risks related to temperament and late-stage consequences that extend 
beyond anxiety into other emotional realms (44). For example, pediatric anxiety disorders 
strongly predict risk for mood disorders, which are more likely to persist and more difficult 
to treat than pediatric anxiety disorders. Hence, treatments delivered early in the course of 
this developmental cascade may be more effective than those delivered at later points. From 
this perspective, enhancing treatment for pediatric anxiety disorders can be viewed as a form 
of prevention for mood disorders. For universal and selective forms of prevention, this logic 
supports other approaches for bolstering resilience and assisting high-risk subjects.

Universal prevention targets population-level risk. To approach this goal, some studies 
deliver brief psychological interventions in schools or through technology by adapting 
features implemented in CBT and related therapies. Recent RCTs suggest that effect 
sizes are not large for these interventions, but a small beneficial effect applied to a large 
population could be important. As such, the scalable nature of these treatments may support 
broad delivery in ways that produce clinical impact (45–47). Other universal prevention 
research suggests the importance of targeting poverty, deprivation, and social stressors that 
accompany these community-level risks in populations of children where anxiety disorders 
are particularly common (48). Nevertheless, while programs of cash transfer or universal 
minimal income appear to benefit many aspects of mental health, weaker or less consistent 
effects exist for anxiety than symptoms of behavior disorders and problems with substance 
use or school failure (2, 49–51).

Figure 1 depicts facets of selective prevention focused on youth at-risk for anxiety. In 
terms of factors amenable to a selective-prevention approach, anxiety disorders have one 
clear targetable risk marker, that is behavioral inhibition (BI). BI manifests in the first 
few years of life as a tendency to react with hesitancy when confronting novel stimuli, 
scenarios, or people. BI strongly predicts risk for multiple anxiety disorders; associations 
with social anxiety disorder appear particularly robust and well-replicated (44, 52). Early 
work suggests that children with BI benefit from targeted intervention that reduces or 
prevents the worsening of anxiety and other problems (53).

3.2  Precision medicine

Page 8

The availability of CBT, antidepressants, and their combination creates situations well-suited 
for precision-medicine approaches. Practitioners rely on impressionistic information or 
consensus guidelines that vary across countries to choose from among these three options. 
Precision medicine approaches might generate useful data-driven alternatives to guide in 
a more uniform manner practitioners around the world who face similar choices about 
treatment options (54).

Longitudinal research and investigations of response moderators in RCTs provide some 
guidance about predictors of pediatric anxiety-disorder outcome. Thus, high levels of 
severity, comorbidity, temperamental factors, and social anxiety symptoms all predict 
relatively poor outcomes in multiple studies (1). These and other factors identified through 
meta-analysis could be combined through risk calculators to create precision-medicine 
tools, as has been done for other mental illnesses (55). Moreover, emerging strategies of 
non-supervised machine learning can inform these efforts by leveraging research to cluster 
subjects according to high dimensional data. Cluster membership can then inform creation 
of risk calculators that predict treatment response to CBT or medications. Particularly 
useful tools would go beyond prediction of overall outcomes by differentially predicting 
response to CBT, antidepressants, or their combination. However, this will require additional 
work, since available data from large RCTs fail to identify factors that predict differential 
responses (56).

Multivariate analysis of brain imaging data also may inform the creation of risk calculators. 
This approach could leverage resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) 
to relate brain function to treatment response. One recent report (57) utilizes rsfMRI 
in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) randomized to receive either CBT or 
antidepressant therapy. The report finds that distinct rsfMRI patterns predict response 
to these two therapies. Attempts to extend the approach to anxiety must contend with 
inconsistent findings for rsfMRI research in this population (58). However, multivariate 
analysis does relate rsfMRI to symptoms of pediatric anxiety disorders with some 
consistency, which sets the stage for future development (59, 60). Of note, these methods 
require large samples to minimize the risk of overfitting. Existing reports, such as from the 
ABCD study (61), show rsfMRI to be sufficiently scalable to support this work. Moreover, 
mega-analyses can pool individuals from multiple samples to generate data sets with greater 
numbers of patients than in single cohorts, even ones as large as the ABCD study (62–
64). Findings from studies adopting these approaches suggest that rsfMRI, as compared 
to structural MRI data, may provide more accurate targets for precision medicine. These 
approaches suggest that rsfMRI might be used to identify children and adolescents with 
anxiety disorders most likely to benefit from SSRIs, CBT, or their combination. When 
embedded in a large RCT comparing these treatment arms, future imaging studies might 
convincingly relate patterns of functional connectivity to treatment outcomes. If outcomes 
relate to particular treatment choices, as in preliminary work on MDD (57), this could reveal 
how clustering according to certain models renders superior results to treatment as usual.

Beyond rsfMRI, another useful approach exploits similarities between CBT and extinction, 
a process where neural circuitry has been mapped in many species (12). The bottom section

phase involves exposure to a threat, a sound paired with a shock. Extinction occurs in the 
next experimental phase, when the animal learns to treat the sound as neutral, after it no 
longer predicts the shock. Processes engaged during exposure therapy in CBT resemble 
processes that allow rodents to reduce defensive response to an extinguished threat, such as 
the sound in the bottom of Figure 1 (65).

Research extending experiments on extinction to humans incorporates psychophysiology, 
electrophysiology, and fMRI markers (66). This work links pediatric anxiety disorders 
to heightened responding to neutral stimuli misperceived as threatening (12, 40). Recent 
research on extinction in large pediatric samples confirms findings from smaller samples. 
For example, two studies (67, 68) report positive relations between levels of physiologic 
responding to extinguished threats and levels of pediatric anxiety disorder symptoms, 
whereas a third study (69) uses fMRI to show that extinguished threats evoke stronger 
amygdala-ventro-medial-prefrontal-cortex (vmPFC) connectivity in youth with anxiety 
disorders than healthy youth. This latter study also reports age differences in amygdala-
vmPFC connectivity that resemble age differences reported in other research on extinction, 
both in rodents and people (12). Finally, few studies of extinction examine relations with 
treatment (40). As in rsfMRI research, large scale RCTs are needed that incorporate 
measures of extinction as potential predictors of treatment response. Such a focus on 
extinction also informs other strategies discussed in the next section for creating novel 
therapies.

3.3  Targeting Mechanisms

Research on mechanisms contributing to pediatric anxiety disorders provides insights on 
a multi-phased approach involving scenarios depicted in Figure 1. This approach begins 
in cross-sectional studies relating pediatric anxiety symptoms to correlates of mechanisms 
presumed to initiate or sustain anxiety disorders. This is followed by longitudinal research 
linking future risk for anxiety to such mechanistic correlates, which then also can be targeted 
in open trials that alter these correlates and examine changes in symptoms. Finally, RCTs 
evaluate the role of such mechanisms in treatment. The availability of antidepressants and 
CBT, two effective therapies, informs this approach. Given children’s vulnerable state, novel 
treatments either must possess advantages over these therapies, be associated with relatively 
low risk of adverse effects, or be prioritized for use in treatment-refractory patients.

A recent review (11) discusses the need to balance the availability of effective treatment 
with the need to find new ones for pediatric anxiety disorders. As an example, it highlights 
the low risk of adverse effects as an important feature of cognitive bias modification, where 
the approach utilizes attention bias modification therapy (ABMT) to target threat-related 
attention bias. This type of attention bias occurs when threats, as compared to neutral 
stimuli, produce greater disruptions in attention. Children expressing high risk for anxiety or 
ongoing anxiety disorders manifest greater threat-related attention bias than healthy children 
(11, 40). Various schemes exist for reducing this bias, but the most consistent results arise 
for ABMT that trains children to shift their attention away from threat. While ABMT 
exerts replicable, statistically significant effects on anxiety, meta-analyses of stand-alone

ABMT in both adults and children find modest effect sizes, typically below d=0.60 (70, 
71). In addition, modest evidence of efficacy exists across three studies that added ABMT 
to CBT for pediatric anxiety disorders, here with small-to-medium effect sizes (6, 72, 73). 
Thus, evidence of efficacy exists, but increasing the magnitude of ABMT efficacy will be 
important.

The next section of this review more fully describes research on brain stimulation, but brain 
stimulation is mentioned here, as preliminary evidence suggests that it could increase the 
effect size for ABMT. Imaging research implicates dysfunction in the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (dlPFC) in threat-related attention bias that occurs in pediatric anxiety disorders, 
as highlighted in the middle section of Figure 1 (74). By hindering patients’ abilities to 
maintain neural representations of their goals, dlPFC dysfunction may enable attention bias 
by allowing mild threats to inappropriately capture attention (75). Data suggest that CBT 
and ABMT partially alleviate dlPFC dysfunction in pediatric anxiety disorders (74). This 
therapeutic effect could be enhanced through direct dlPFC stimulation designed to further 
correct dlPFC dysfunction associated with pediatric anxiety disorders. Consistent with this 
possibility, a study in adults (75) shows that active relative to sham dlPFC stimulation during 
ABMT produces greater changes in attention.

While examined less extensively than threat-related attention bias, other forms of cognitive 
dysfunction also correlate with pediatric anxiety symptoms in ways that provide additional 
targets for novel therapies. For example, children with anxiety disorders manifest elevated 
activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and associated interconnected areas that 
comprise the brain’s so-called ventral attention network. This anxiety-related enhancement 
in brain activity occurs when generic, non-emotional, salient stimuli involuntarily capture 
attention (11). Thus, pediatric anxiety disorders involve a hypersensitivity to distractors 
on both neural and behavioral grounds that could be reduced through cognitive training 
designed to alleviate this hypersensitivity. Similarly, Craske and colleagues (76) suggest that 
deficient inhibitory control, which occurs in pediatric anxiety disorders (77, 78), impedes 
CBT response by hindering the extinction of conditioned fear. Preliminary work in adults 
suggests that cognitive training regimens capable of enhancing inhibitory control could 
improve response to CBT (79).

Research in adults uses many approaches to target mechanisms and improve treatment 
responses. This research informs studies of pediatric anxiety disorders, since more work 
in adults than in youth uses pharmacotherapy to target mechanisms. One recent review 
(80) describes compounds used in this manner, including oxytocin, cortisol and other 
modulators of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis function, as well as d-cycloserine and 
other medications that modulate glutamate. Like the targeting of inhibitory control deficits 
with cognitive training, many such compounds target the circuitry supporting extinction of 
conditioned fear. As discussed above, imaging studies implicate this circuitry in pediatric 
anxiety disorders, suggesting the relevance of studies in adults for youth. Unfortunately, 
limited research in youth employs pharmacotherapy to target extinction, possibly due to 
concerns about adverse effects. The best-developed approach uses d-cycloserine to augment 
CBT in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), a condition related to pediatric anxiety

disorders. However, results from an RCT in 142 pediatric patients with OCD suggest the 
medication fails to augment response to CBT (81).

Examination of sleep provides a final example where research on mechanisms informs 
approaches to novel treatment in pediatric anxiety disorders. Problems with sleep correlate 
with ongoing and future risk for pediatric anxiety disorders (82). At a mechanistic level, 
such problems may disrupt memory consolidation in ways that hinder extinction of fear. 
Evidence (83) suggests that novel techniques for consolidating memory during sleep could 
potentially be adapted to facilitate response to CBT through consolidation of extinction. 
Similarly, other work generates a model (82) that links disrupted sleep to pediatric 
anxiety disorders through effects on functioning of the brain’s default mode network. 
Novel treatments (84) apply this model through sleep enhancement programs targeting 
multiple processes. These include distressing thoughts and associated rumination at bedtime 
in addition to alterations in motivation, deficient savoring of positive experiences, and 
problematic sleep hygiene. These programs attempt to increase response to CBT in pediatric 
anxiety disorders by targeting sleep’s associated disruptions in brain function.

4-  Treatment Improvements into the Future

The above-noted studies of attention bias and extinction illustrate how research on 
mechanisms provides a useful path for therapeutic discovery involving techniques with 
low risk of adverse effects. Of note, cognitive training influences brain function in less 
direct ways than other techniques, such as medications and some forms of brain stimulation, 
which carry greater risks for adverse effects. This provides avenues for synergistic work 
that combines research on cognitive training, a technique with low risk of adverse effects, 
with research on other therapies carrying greater risk for adverse effects. By providing 
complementary perspectives on mechanisms, such synergistic work could generate saltatory 
long-term improvements in treatment.

While minimal research examines brain stimulation in any pediatric mental disorder, let 
alone pediatric anxiety disorders, research on ABMT summarized in the previous section 
illustrates the promise of melding studies of cognitive training and brain stimulation. 
Accordingly, this final section highlights some facets of brain stimulation. Some techniques, 
such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), carry relatively few risks and hold 
some promise, where stimulation of the prefrontal cortex might influence extinction in 
ways that could facilitate response to CBT. However, one study in healthy adults found 
unexpected effects of tDCS on extinction: stimulation parameters expected to facilitate 
extinction of conditioned fear generated the opposite effect (85, 86). Unexpected results 
could reflect a less clear understanding of tDCS’s neural effects than for another promising 
treatment, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

TMS has some risk to induce seizures. While no TMS data exist in pediatric anxiety 
disorders, overall seizure risk with TMS in people of all ages is well below 1% (87). Work 
relevant to pediatric anxiety disorders includes an RCT of TMS in 103 pediatric patients 
with MDD, where no seizures occurred among the 48 patients who received as many as 
30 treatment sessions (88). As described in the section above for ABMT, studies of TMS

and cognitive training could inform each other, where TMS could be appropriately delivered 
to children with refractory disorders. Of note, such work could progress slowly, given 
findings among adults, where this approach has yet to generate the expected therapeutic 
benefits for anxiety, beyond successes in the treatment of OCD. For example, reminiscent 
of the above-noted unexpected tDCS effects on extinction (86), results from a study in 125 
adults with posttraumatic stress disorder suggest that TMS stimulation intended to facilitate 
extinction could evoke the opposite effect, slowing CBT-related extinction (89).

Increasing the cross-talk between basic and clinical researchers is important. Available work 
links theories of anxiety disorder pathogenesis to neuroscience research on mammalian 
defensive behavior (7, 8, 10, 44, 90–95). Moreover, this work specifically highlights 
the relevance of research in non-human primates, given the evolutionary relatedness of 
nonhuman primates to humans, the prolonged development of the primate brain, and 
the well-developed prefrontal cortex of primates. This work supports neurodevelopmental 
theories of anxiety, identifying neural circuits and altered gene expression within the 
amygdala and prefrontal cortex that appear related to risk for anxiety disorders (10, 91–93). 
As with research on prevention, this work suggests that more durable therapeutic effects may 
result from earlier treatment, and it also delineates many pathways for clinical research.

Cross-species similarities allow neuroscience to inform a long-term agenda for novel 
treatment discovery in pediatric anxiety disorders. As reviewed elsewhere (80, 96–98), new 
treatments could involve novel pharmacological agents, including small molecules capable 
of targeting circuits or mechanisms related to defensive behavior, compounds that enhance 
neural plasticity, and medications showing some initial success in research on adult mood 
and anxiety disorders. However, two factors suggest that brain stimulation provides unique 
advantages. First, in children and adolescents, risk for adverse effects constrains studies of 
novel therapeutics (11). Adverse effects initiated by ingested substances can be difficult to 
terminate and can last for hours or even days; many effects generated by brain stimulation 
more rapidly abate, disappearing with cessation of stimulation. Thus, risk for enduring 
adverse effects may be lower with brain stimulation than novel medications. Second, studies 
of brain stimulation for mood disorders use imaging to leverage cross-species research 
on neural circuitry function (11). A comparable approach in anxiety could allow imaging 
studies in youth and experiments in other species to identify neural-circuit targets associated 
with avoidance and other dysfunctional behaviors evoked by threats. These circuits might be 
targeted through brain stimulation in pediatric patients with refractory anxiety disorders.

Whether through pharmacology, brain stimulation, or other means, long-term treatment 
advances likely require changes in practice involving closer basic-clinical integration than 
exists in current guidelines (31, 32). Closer integration is needed due to the degenerate 
nature of the nervous system (99), which allows multiple circuits to support many specific 
behaviors. From this perspective, any codification of specific behaviors remains wanting 
until the code connects these behaviors to particular circuits. In this instance, degeneracy 
would require dysfunctional behaviors to be classified based on the combination of 
phenomenology existing alongside specific neural circuitry correlates. This departs from 
current nosologies based only on phenomenology.

Applied to defensive behavior and anxiety, degeneracy allows approach-avoidance conflicts 
to evoke biologically distinct forms of avoidance that appear superficially similar on 
behavioral, phenomenological grounds (7, 65). In these instances, avoidance in some 
individuals may reflect the brain’s intrinsic tendency to overvalue avoidance of threats; 
in other individuals, avoidance may reflect the brain’s intrinsic tendency to undervalue 
procurement of rewards, and, in a final group of individuals, avoidance may reflect problems 
in the brain’s ability to adapt effectively following prior exposures to threats and rewards. 
Thus, these three groups of individuals might manifest superficially similar problems with 
approach-avoidance conflicts that arise from distinct source-mechanisms. Such groups could 
require different treatments each tailored to particular mechanisms (7, 100). In the long term, 
such degeneracy requiring distinct mechanism-guided treatments ultimately could create 
scenarios where appropriate treatment of mental disorders requires behavior to be classified, 
diagnoses to be assigned, and treatments to be selected based on assessments of brain 
function.

5-  Conclusion

This overview summarizes evidence on CBT and SSRI treatment for pediatric anxiety 
disorders. This is followed by a discussion of three approaches for improving treatment 
outcomes over the coming decade. Finally, the review describes an approach that combines 
research on cognitive training that targets mechanisms causing or sustaining anxiety 
disorders with studies of brain stimulation. This approach leverages leads from basic 
research on the targeting of circuits that support defensive behavior in mammals.

Figure 1: 
Current treatment for individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (red) consists of either 
medication, CBT, or a combination of both. Near term improvements in outcomes might 
follow by increasing availability of these treatments and by offering psychological treatment 
to people at-risk (‘purple’) for anxiety disorders. Current research seeks novel treatments 
based on their capacity to influence mammalian neural circuitry that is engaged by threats. 
The figure illustrates two behaviors and associated circuitry. One behavior concerns the 
capture of attention by a threat, such as the snake in the picture. This behavior engages

the lateral prefrontal cortex, as also shown in the figure in green, and may be targeted by 
cognitive training as also illustrated in the figure. The other behavior appears in the bottom 
of the figure, where a mouse first learns that a sound predicts a shock before the mouse next 
extinguishes this learning. Retention of this subsequent extinction learning is represented 
by the associated sound that appears without the shock. Such learning requires the medial 
prefrontal cortex, shown in blue. This circuit could be targeted by brain stimulation, as also 
shown in the figure.
