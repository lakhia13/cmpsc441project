climate change.

1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been increasing attention
devoted to understanding and mitigating the impacts
of climate change on mental health (Berry et al.,
2010; Charlson et al., 2021; Cianconi et al., 2020;
Doherty & Clayton, 2011; Olﬀ, 2023). This attention
is the result of the increasing frequency and severity
of climate change-related events (Basu et al., 2018;
Edwards et al., 2024; Thompson et al., 2023) as
well as the growing anxiety over the existential
threat posed by climate change on human health
and well-being to future generations (Heeren &
Asmundson, 2023; Usher, 2022). The European Jour-
nal of Psychotraumatology has had a long interest in
this issue (Olﬀ, 2017, 2019) and in 2020 put out a
call for studies advancing research in the area of cli-
mate change and traumatic stress (see Olﬀ, 2022).
The papers included in this special issue of the Euro-
pean Journal of Psychotraumatology draw from, and
contribute to, a trauma-informed perspective on this

topic. The central theme of this special issue is that
trauma and adversity are central to our understand-
ing of the mental health impacts of climate change.
In this editorial, we argue that taking a trauma focus
to this understanding is essential in order to evolve
our thinking of resilience and recovery.

The 15 papers included in this special issue rep-
resent six major themes drawn from research on trau-
matic events directly associated with climate change
(e.g. hurricanes, ﬂoods, wildﬁres) as well as events
associated with other environmental stressors (e.g.
earthquakes): (1) the complexity of climate change
related mental health outcomes; (2) the impacts of
exposure

change-related events and stressors; (3) the modera-
tors and mediators of vulnerability to climate

and community resilience and protective factors; (5)

2. Exposure to multiple climate change
events

last

When describing climate change-related events and
their mental health impacts, researchers tend to cat-
egorise disaster events based on their time course or
chronicity. For example, events have been labelled as
acute extreme weather events that last for days such
as wildﬁres, hurricanes and ﬂoods; sub-acute events
that
for months such as droughts and heat
waves; and lasting environmental changes such as sea
level rises, and permanently altered environments
(Palinkas & Wong, 2020). Similarly, disaster response
frameworks often classify psychosocial interventions
based on their position in time relative to a single
emergency event – i.e. addressing mental health symp-
toms in the aftermath of a disaster, versus building
mental health preparedness and resilience for future
disasters (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). While this way

of categorising events is useful, a trauma-informed
perspective would also have us recognise the impor-
tance of cumulative events. As the global eﬀects of cli-
mate change continue to worsen, not only are natural
disaster events increasing in frequency, communities
are increasingly more likely to be impacted by multiple
and overlapping disaster events (Cowlishaw et al.,
2023; Leppold et al., 2022). In this Special Issue, Agya-
pong et al. (2022) found that the number of traumatic
disasters experienced a ﬁve-year period (including
COVID, wildﬁre and ﬂood events) was associated
with both the prevalence and severity of mental health
conditions including posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), major depression episode and generalised
anxiety disorder. We can expect that the global burden
of mental health problems will continue to escalate as
the climate crisis worsens and cumulative disaster
exposure becomes the norm, and that these impacts
will be disproportionately felt by minority commu-
nities more directly aﬀected by climate change (Pear-
son et al., 2023). As such, there is a clear need for
researchers, policy makers and disaster response
agencies to consider the compounding mental health
impacts of exposure to multiple or simultaneous cli-
mate change-related events and stressors.

3. Complexity of climate change-related
mental health outcomes

A range of mental health outcomes has been associ-
ated with the impacts of climate change-related disas-
ter events. Although disaster events are frequently
traumatic in nature and are most typically associated
with the emergence of posttraumatic stress symptoms
(Agyapong et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Massazza
et al., 2022; van der Does et al., 2023), the mental
health sequelae of disasters are complex and may
also include symptoms of anxiety (Agyapong et al.,
2022; Richez et al., 2022), depression (Agyapong
et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023), and general psychologi-
cal distress (Pardon et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022).
Further, a scoping review article in this Special Issue
indicated that amongst individuals, lasting environ-
mental changes associated with climate change (par-
in increased
ticularly heat and heatwaves) result
mortality risk, suicide and suicidal behaviours, and
psychiatric morbidity amongst individuals with men-
tal health conditions (Massazza et al., 2022). It is there-
fore clear that the mental health impacts of climate
change extend beyond the acute eﬀects of natural dis-
asters, and that long-term alterations to the environ-
ment caused by climate change will continue to
worsen mental health outcomes over time.

4. Moderators and mediators of
vulnerability

A trauma lens also provides important information
when considering who is vulnerable to poor mental
health outcomes following the impacts of climate
change. In a longitudinal study, Liang et al. (2023)
found a cumulative, dose-related relationship between
childhood trauma/stressful life events, and the later
mental health response to disaster events. While social
support had a buﬀering eﬀect, this eﬀect was not seen
for those with a high stress load. It is also well demon-
strated that there are demographic disparities that
moderate the health eﬀects of climate change (Benevo-
lenza & DeRigne, 2019), particularly among vulner-
able populations such as low-income individuals
(Tekin et al., 2023) and racial and ethnic minorities
(Berberian et al., 2022). Pertinently, in addition to
individual pre-existing vulnerabilities, the ﬁnancial
stressors emerging directly from extreme disaster
events are a core mediator between these events and
their adverse mental health outcomes. For example,
economic factors such as damage to homes and infra-
structure, threats to livelihood and employment, and
the associated ﬁnancial stressors (Berry et al., 2010,
2018; Hayes et al., 2018) are all contributors to nega-
tive mental health outcomes beyond the direct
eﬀects of
trauma exposure and physical danger
(Zhang et al., 2022). Accordingly, a trauma-informed

perspective on the mental health outcomes of climate
change must consider both pre-existing vulnerabilities
and post-disaster stressors which mediate the eﬀects of
disasters and other climate change events.

5. Resilience and protective factors

found that

Studying the protective factors which promote mental
health resilience in the face of adversity and trauma –
both at the individual and community levels – is
essential to informing preparedness and response to
climate change events. Frameworks of post-disaster
resilience highlight that community systems and social
support are central ecological resources that buﬀer
against the negative mental health eﬀects of climate
change and related disasters (Ungar & Theron,
2020). In this Special Issue, Bakic and Ajdukovic
interpersonal and community
(2021)
resources, including social support from loved ones
and the community; as well as individual resources,
such as psychological resilience; were associated with
greater mental health and life satisfaction in members
of ﬂood-aﬀected communities in Croatia. Similarly,
Liu et al. (2021) found greater social support increases
self-compassion and posttraumatic growth in the
aftermath of trauma; as well as increasing prosocial
and reducing antisocial behaviours. Individual-level
psychosocial resources are also critical protective fac-
tors against negative mental health outcomes, with
Tekin et al. (2023) ﬁnding that in survivors of Hurri-
cane Katrina, factors such as hope for the future,
eﬃcient coping strategies, and acceptance of the situ-
ation were associated with recovery trajectories of
posttraumatic stress, reﬂected in improvements in
individuals’ symptoms over time. While the cumulat-
ive impacts of climate change are severe, this evidence
points to a number of individual- and community-
level protective factors which may buﬀer the negative
mental health eﬀects of climate change-related disaster
events and lasting environmental changes.

6. Child and adolescent mental health

Childhood and adolescence are critical developmental
periods characterised by complex neurodevelopmen-
tal changes. Exposure to childhood trauma is associ-
ated with disruptions in normative cognitive and
biological (i.e. genetic, neurodevelopmental, and hor-
monal) functioning that confer risk for psychiatric ill-
ness (McKay et al., 2021). In this Special Issue, there
was a particular focus on mechanisms that underpin
the emergence and maintenance of mental health pro-
blems in children and adolescents exposed to climate
change-related natural disasters. In a longitudinal
study of Chinese children and adolescents exposed
to the Zhouqu debris ﬂow, Liang et al. (2023) ident-
iﬁed that depressive symptoms were stable over the

4

EDITORIAL

two-year study period, with feelings of self-hate, lone-
liness and sleep disturbance most central to the endur-
ing experience of depression over time. Given the
multifaceted developmental processes occurring in
this period, it is notable that one study also found
that the clinical expression of mental health responses
to natural disasters diverged by age group. In children
exposed to a violent storm in France (Richez et al.,
2022), acute stress responses amongst 0–5-year-olds
were more typically characterised by agitation and
developmental regression, whereas 6–11-year olds
were more likely to report experiencing anxiety.

It is worth noting that factors inﬂuencing mental
health outcomes post-disaster are not restricted to
individual-level personal characteristics, but also
include higher-level factors concerning the disaster
itself or the community’s subsequent response. Factors
such as the severity of disaster and level of exposure to
the event can confer further vulnerability for mental
health problems (Khan et al., 2023). Indeed, after the
2011 Great East Japan earthquake (Ohnuma et al.,
2023), exposure to television media coverage of the
victims was associated with greater psychopathology
among children and greater psychological distress
among their parents.

As well as identifying factors which confer risk
for mental health problems in children and adoles-
cents post-disaster,
Issue also sheds
this Special
light on a number of factors that support resilience
and adaptive functioning in a post-disaster environ-
ment. Liu et al. (2021) demonstrated that in Chinese
teenagers exposed to the Ya’an earthquake, greater
social support had a positive impact on prosocial
behaviours, both directly and indirectly via increas-
ing self-compassion and posttraumatic growth; as
well as reducing antisocial behaviour. The impor-
tance of social support, particularly from parents
and caregivers, was echoed by a narrative review
the Turkey–
examining the potential
Syria earthquake on the psychological well-being of
the aﬀected children and adolescents (Khan et al.,
2023). The review also highlights the need for
long-term mental health support services – co-
designed by aﬀected communities, to ensure their
and
cultural
encourage help-seeking – so that children and ado-
lescents can receive ongoing mental health support
after the initial acute disaster event.

7. Intervention

The psychosocial needs of communities post-disaster
are highly complex, and the speciﬁc needs of indi-
viduals can vary greatly. Although eﬀective psycho-
logical
for disaster-related mental
health problems exist, the scarcity of mental health

workers limits the practicality of

health professionals delivering sustained care to
individuals and communities aﬀected by disaster.
Task-shifting approaches, which shift service deliv-
ery from highly qualiﬁed health workers to individ-
uals with lower qualiﬁcations (Seidman & Atun,
2017), may be one way of increasing community
capability to respond to the mental health needs
post-disaster.

In this Special Issue, two studies investigated the
eﬃcacy of a skills-based psychosocial
intervention
that adopted a task-shifting model to address psycho-
logical distress following climate change disasters. The
Skills fOr Life Adjustment and Resilience (SOLAR)
programme (O’Donnell et al., 2020) was found to
reduce psychological distress and posttraumatic stress
symptoms in cyclone-aﬀected communities in the
Paciﬁc Island nation of Tuvalu (Gibson et al., 2021),
relative to Usual Care. Similarly, the SOLAR pro-
gramme was found to signiﬁcantly reduce anxiety,
depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms relative
to an active Self-Help condition in a sample of individ-
uals aﬀected by compound disasters in rural and
regional Australia (Cowlishaw et al., 2023). Interest-
ingly, the ﬁndings from this randomised controlled
trial highlighted the need to consider the cumulative
events, with the authors suggesting booster sessions
would be useful to maintain treatment eﬀects when
ongoing stressors occur. These ﬁndings highlight
that ﬂexible, scalable low-intensity psychosocial inter-
ventions delivered by laypeople could form a critical
part of post-disaster recovery by allowing for more
optimised allocation of mental health resources, so
that the diverse mental health needs of individuals
can be most eﬀectively addressed. Importantly, the
SOLAR programme provides

exposure to traumatic events, which as this editorial
is an essential part of understanding and

skills

The growing evidence that communities impacted
by disasters are increasingly impacted by multiple dis-
asters blurs the question of when the most appropriate
time is to intervene with an intervention like the
SOLAR programme. For a single disaster event, the
idea of 3–12 months post disaster is a useful time to
consider utilising interventions targeted to psychoso-
cial distress. However, for communities impacted by
multiple disasters over time, this is less clear. It may
be that an intervention like the SOLAR programme
which is conducted in the aftermath of a particular
disaster (as a recovery response) becomes a part of a
preparedness response for a future disaster. It is essen-
tial that research and policy agendas consider systems
being impacted by multiple disasters, and recognise
that communities may be simultaneously engaging
in preparedness, response and recovery phases relat-
ing to diﬀerent disaster events.

8. Conclusion

Although the trauma and adversity focus represented
in this special issue is largely derived from the experi-
ence of acute climate change related events, it oﬀers
the potential for illuminating the causes and conse-
quences of mental health outcomes typically associ-
ated with the existential and long-term threats of
climate change to human health and well-being. Gov-
ernments and emergency response organisations are
increasingly looking to the research community to
guide them on how to foster both individual and com-
munity psychosocial resilience and recovery in the
face of climate change-related impacts. This sits as a
challenge to the research ﬁeld, and we must bring
our trauma expertise to these important questions.
To this end, we applaud eﬀorts for global research col-
laborations in this area such as the climate change
the Global Collaboration on Traumatic
theme of
Stress
(www.global-psychotrauma.net/climate). As
each year continues to surpass the preceding year as
the hottest on record, and as the number of people
exposed to these events continues to rise, the urgency
of conducting such collaborations and research will
only continue to increase.
