Abstract
Objectives  Mental health and neurocognitive conditions are important causes of hospitalization among immigrants, though 
patterns may vary by immigrant category, world region of origin, and time since arrival in Canada. This study uses linked 
administrative data to explore differences in mental health hospitalization rates between immigrants and individuals born 
in Canada.
Methods  Hospital records from the Discharge Abstract Database and the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System for 2011 
to 2017 were linked to the 2016 Longitudinal Immigrant Database and to Statistics Canada’s 2011 Canadian Census Health 
and Environment Cohort. Age-standardized hospitalization rates for mental health–related conditions (ASHR-MHs) were 
derived for immigrants and the Canadian-born population. ASHR-MHs overall and for leading mental health conditions were 
compared between immigrants and the Canadian-born population, stratified by sex and selected immigration characteristics. 
Quebec hospitalization data were not available.
Results  Overall, immigrants had lower ASHR-MHs compared to the Canadian-born population. Mood disorders were 
leading causes of mental health hospitalization for both cohorts. Psychotic, substance-related, and neurocognitive disorders 
were also leading causes of mental health hospitalization, although there was variation in their relative importance between 
subgroups. Among immigrants, ASHR-MHs were higher among refugees and lower among economic immigrants, those 
from East Asia, and those who arrived in Canada most recently.
Conclusion  Differences in hospitalization rates among immigrants from various immigration streams and world regions, 
particularly for specific types of mental health conditions, highlight the importance of future research that incorporates both 
inpatient and outpatient mental health services to further understand these relationships.

Résultats  Dans l’ensemble, les immigrants avaient des THNA-SM plus faibles que la population née au Canada. Les 
troubles de l’humeur étaient les principales causes d’hospitalisation en santé mentale pour les deux cohortes. Les troubles 
psychotiques, liés aux substances et neurocognitifs étaient également les principales causes d’hospitalisation en santé mentale, 
bien que leur importance relative varie entre les sous-groupes. Chez les immigrants, les THNA-SM étaient plus élevés chez 
les réfugiés et plus faibles chez les immigrants économiques, ceux de l’Asie de l’Est et ceux qui sont arrivés au Canada plus 
récemment.
Conclusion  Les différences dans les taux d’hospitalisation chez les immigrants des divers groupes d’immigration et régions 
du monde, plus particulièrement pour certains types de problèmes de santé mentale, soulignent l’importance de recherches 
futures qui intègrent les services de santé mentale aux patients hospitalisés ainsi qu’aux patients externes afin de mieux 
comprendre ces relations.

Introduction

Mental health is a concern at various stages of the immigra-
tion pathway, and these issues can have impacts on newcom-
ers in terms of settlement, health, and social service needs. 
While some studies suggest that immigrants may use mental 
health services less often than non-immigrants (Abebe et al., 
2017; Chen & Vargas-Bustamante, 2011; Derr, 2016; Islam 
et al., 2018; Ng & Zhang, 2021; Nwoke et al., 2020), there 
is also evidence suggesting that there may be differences 
based on immigrant admission category (Abebe et al., 2017; 
Durbin et al., 2014; Ng & Zhang, 2021) and world region 
of origin (Abebe et al., 2017; Durbin et al., 2015; Kirmayer 
et al., 2007; Ng & Zhang, 2021).

Some studies have noted differences in both the preva-
lence of mental health conditions (Abebe et al., 2017; Derr, 
2016; Ng & Zhang, 2020; Robert & Gilkeinson, 2010) and 
mental health service use (Derr, 2016; Durbin et al., 2014; 
Ng & Zhang, 2021; Saunders et al., 2018; Vigod et al., 2017) 
between refugee and non-refugee immigrants and across 
groups of immigrants from different world regions (Abebe 
et al., 2017; Durbin et al., 2015; Kirmayer et al., 2007; Ng & 
Zhang, 2020, 2021). In a recent systematic review and meta-
analysis of specific mental health conditions among refugees 
and asylum seekers, more than 30% had post-traumatic stress 
disorder or depression, suggesting that refugees may have a 
particular need for mental health services (Blackmore et al., 
2020). Increased exposure to trauma among refugees coming 
from countries experiencing social turmoil has been high-
lighted as an important risk factor for subsequent mental 
health conditions (Pottie et al., 2011).

Previous  analysis  of  hospitalization  events  among 
immigrants  identified  mental  health  conditions  (includ-
ing neurocognitive conditions) among the top six reasons 

for hospitalization (Ng et al., 2021). However, few previ-
ous Canadian studies examining the relationship between 
immigration and mental health (Durbin et al., 2014, 2015; 
Kirmayer et al., 2007; Ng & Omariba, 2010; Ng & Zhang, 
2020, 2021) have examined differences by specific mental 
health conditions. This descriptive study expands upon pre-
vious work on all-cause hospitalizations among immigrants 
(Ng et al., 2021) to examine hospitalization rates for spe-
cific mental health and neurocognitive conditions among 
immigrants and the Canadian-born population, stratified 
by sex, world region of origin, and selected immigration 
characteristics.

Methods

Similar to previous work (Ng et al., 2021), this study com-
pared mental health hospitalization rates among immigrants 
and the Canadian-born population using linked administra-
tive datasets at Statistics Canada (StatCan). The work was 
conducted using StatCan’s Social Data Linkage Environ-
ment  (SDLE)  and  its  highly  secured  central  depository 
called the Derived Record Depository (DRD) (Statistics 
Canada, 2017).

Data sources

Mental health hospitalization data were obtained from the 
Canadian Institute for Health Information’s (CIHI) Dis-
charge Abstract Database (DAD) and the Ontario Mental 
Health Reporting System (OMHRS). The DAD contains 
demographic, administrative, and clinical data for all acute 
care and some psychiatric, chronic rehabilitation, and day-
surgery discharges for all provinces and territories excluding 

1 3694 

Canadian Journal of Public Health (2023) 114:692–704

Quebec (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2018). 
The DAD includes hospital discharges occurring between 
April 1, 1994 and March 31, 2017 (comprising 84.8 mil-
lion hospital discharge records) that were eligible for link-
age using a deterministic approach (linkage rate of 91%; see 
Carrière et al. (2018) for details). The OMHRS is a CIHI 
database that includes information about individuals admit-
ted to general and speciality facilities in Ontario since April 
2006 (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2016b). 
This supplemented the absence of mental health hospitali-
zation data from the DAD from Ontario since 2006/2007. 
The OMHRS includes information at the assessment level 
about patients’ mental and physical health, social sup-
ports, and service use. OMHRS records occurring between 
April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2018 were eligible for linkage 
in the present study (n=1,248,844), using a deterministic 
approach (linkage rate of 82.7%; see Social Data Linkage 
Environment, Analysis and Data Development Section, 
Special Surveys Division (2019) for details).

Immigrant records were obtained from the Longitudinal 
Immigration Database (IMDB), which is derived from the 
Immigration Landing files provided to StatCan by Immigra-
tion, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). The 2016 
IMDB contains administrative information since 1980 for 
all individuals who landed as permanent residents or had 
temporary resident permits issued. In the present study, land-
ing records and temporary resident permits between 1980 
and 2017 were eligible for linkage (n=12,317,708). Using 
probabilistic methods, the 2016 IMDB was linked to the 
DRD (linkage rate of 90%, n=11,036,264; see Social Data 
Linkage Environment, Analysis, and Data Development Sec-
tion, Special Surveys Division (2019) for details).

Data on Canadian-born individuals were obtained from 
the 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort 
(CanCHEC), a population-based study cohort based on the 
2011  Canadian  National  Household  Survey  (NHS)  that 
was probabilistically linked to administrative health data 
(e.g.,  mortality,  hospitalizations,  and  cancer  diagnoses) 
(Health Analysis Division, 2019). The NHS was probabil-
istically linked to the DRD with a linkage rate of 96.7% 
(n=6,496,380;  see  Health  Analysis  Division  (2019)  for 
details).

Together, these linkages provide the corresponding hospi-
talization outcomes among the Canadian-born cohort based 
on the 2011 NHS-DAD-OMHRS linked database, while the 
IMDB was linked to hospitalization data for the immigrant 
cohort,  based  on  the  2016  IMDB-DAD-OMHRS  linked 
database.

Study cohorts

Similar to previous work on all-cause hospitalization, this 
study included two cohorts—an immigrant cohort and a 

Canadian-born cohort (Fig. 1)—details of which have been 
previously described (Ng et al., 2021). Briefly, the immi-
grant cohort was limited to permanent residents who arrived 
in Canada between January 1, 1980, and May 10, 2011: tem-
porary residents (e.g., students, workers) were excluded. To 
account for the fact that Quebec does not contribute data to 
the DAD, immigrants who landed in Quebec were excluded 
from the analysis. The final number of individuals in the 
immigrant cohort was 4,162,005.

The Canadian-born cohort was based on respondents 
to the 2011 CanCHEC who self-identified as being Cana-
dian-born. Similar to the approach taken for the immigrant 
cohort, 2011 CanCHEC members who resided in Quebec 
were excluded from the analysis. The final sample size of 
the Canadian-born cohort was 3,754,230 representing a 
weighted population of 19,037,385 individuals.

Acute care hospitalization records from the DAD and 
OMHRS were linked to the immigrant and Canadian-born 
cohorts for a 5-year follow-up, starting from Census Day 
2011 (May 10, 2011) through May 9, 2016 (Supplementary 
Fig. 1).

Hospital discharges for mental health–related 
conditions

The primary study outcome was a hospital discharge related 
to a mental health or neurocognitive condition during the 
follow-up  period.  DAD-derived  acute  care  hospital  dis-
charges were classified according to the condition most 
responsible for the patient’s hospitalization (most responsi-
ble diagnosis; MRDX) (Canadian Institute for Health Infor-
mation, 2016a). The MRDX was chosen to capture cause of 
hospitalization, as other potential indicators such as medica-
tion use were not available in the DAD. The MRDX in DAD 
is coded using the 10th edition of the International Classi-
fication of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Canada 
(ICD-10-CA) and these were first subdivided according to 
their chapter code, with a special focus on codes F01 to F99 
from chapter 5 for Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelop-
mental disorders (Supplementary Table 1). Instead of ICD-
10-CA coding, diagnoses are coded in the OMHRS using 
versions IV and V of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders (DSM). To maintain consistency in 
diagnostic classifications between DAD and OMHRS, a 
CIHI-developed classification crosswalk (Canadian Insti-
tute for Health Information, 2021) was used to categorize 
the mental health–related hospitalizations from the two data 
sources into the following groups: (1) substance-related and 
addictive disorders; (2) psychotic disorders (includes schizo-
phrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders); (3) mood 
disorders (which includes bipolar and related disorders, 
depressive disorders, and other mood disorders); (4) anxi-
ety disorders; (5) personality disorders; (6) neurocognitive

Institute for Health Information, 2021). In addition, DAD 
records that were coded as self-inflicted injuries and poison-
ings were classified as self-harm (X60–X84 in ICD10-CA). 
Noting that CIHI includes neurocognitive conditions as a 
subgroup of mental health conditions, we will use the term 
“mental health” to include neurocognitive conditions in this 
paper.

To avoid over-estimation of discharges due to hospital 
transfers, hospital admissions that occurred within 1 day 
of a previous discharge for the same patient were consoli-
dated into a single hospitalization episode: in these cases, 
the MRDX for the last hospital discharge within the episode 
was used to characterize the nature of the hospitalization.

Covariates

Age  and  sex  were  determined  for  the  immigrant  and 
Canadian-born cohorts based on IMDB and CanCHEC, 
respectively. For the Canadian-born cohort, age was cal-
culated as of May 10, 2011. Among immigrants, age was 

calculated as the difference between 2011 and the birth 
year obtained from IMDB. Age was subsequently grouped 
for both cohorts as 0–17, 18–39, 40–64, and 65 years and 
older.

Additional characteristics were included for the 2016 
IMDB-DAD-OMHRS immigrant cohort. To reflect time 
since immigration to Canada, landing year was grouped 
as 1980–1989, 1990–2002, and 2003–2011. These cut-
points were chosen to allow immigrants in the final group 
to be those who arrived under the most recent version of 
the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which was 
passed in 2001 (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, 
2001). Immigrants’ birth country was grouped into 10 
world regions: the United States; Caribbean, Central, and 
South America; Western Europe; Eastern Europe; Sub-
Saharan Africa; Southwest Asia and North Africa; South 
Asia; Southeast Asia; East Asia; and Others (Ng, 2011). 
As  previously  described  (Ng  et  al., 2016),  immigrant 
admission categories were classified into four general 
groups in accordance with the Immigration and Refu-
gee Protection Act (2001): economic class; family class; 
refugees; and others.

Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics (frequency tables and proportions) 
were used to describe the immigrant and Canadian-born 
cohorts. Crude and age-standardized mental health–related 
hospitalization rates (ASHR-MHs) were derived by sex 
for  mental  health–related  hospitalizations  overall,  and 
for the three leading causes (as determined by distribu-
tion) among the immigrant cohort. These rates were also 
examined within the immigrant cohort by the variables 
identified above (i.e., immigrant admission category, land-
ing year, and world region of birth). The Canadian-born 
population (excluding Quebec) for the 2011 NHS was used 
as the reference population for age standardization. Rate 
derivation was adjusted for individuals who died during 
follow-up. Last, to account for the 2011 NHS’s complex 
survey  design  (Statistics  Canada, 2011),  and  to  adjust 
for linkage, measures for the Canadian-born cohort were 

Table 1   Descriptive characteristics of the study cohort

Canadian Journal of Public Health (2023) 114:692–704

calculated using the CanCHEC’s sample and bootstrap 
weights  (Health  Analysis  Division, 2019).  No  weight-
ing adjustment was used for the immigrant cohort, as the 
cohort is considered to be a 100% census of immigrants, 
such that no sampling adjustment is required.

Results

Among immigrants, the highest percentages were admit-
ted under the economic class (51%) followed by the fam-
ily class (33%). Almost half (45%) of these immigrants 
were aged 40–64 years in 2011, compared to 34% for the 
Canadian-born population. Among immigrants, almost 
half (46%) arrived in Canada between 1990 and 2002 and 
more than half (53%) were from South, Southeast, or East 
Asia (Table 1).

Leading causes of mental health hospitalization

Among  immigrant  and  Canadian-born  males,  the  most 
prevalent categories of mental health–related hospitaliza-
tion were psychotic disorders, substance-related and addic-
tive disorders, and mood disorders (Table 2). However, the 
proportions and relative order of these three categories dif-
fered between the two groups. The leading cause of mental 
health–related hospitalization among immigrant males was 
psychotic disorders (34%), while for Canadian-born males 
it was mood disorders (25%). Overall, the top three causes 
of mental health–related hospitalization made up a greater 
share of all mental health–related hospitalizations among 
immigrant (78%) compared to Canadian-born males (65%).
Among immigrant and Canadian-born females, mood 
disorders were the leading cause of mental health–related 
hospitalization, accounting for approximately 34% of mental 
health–related hospitalizations (Table 2). Psychotic disor-
ders (25%) were the second leading cause among immigrant 
females, while substance-related and addictive disorders 
(12%) were the second leading cause for Canadian-born 
females.  In  both  groups,  neurocognitive  disorders  were 
the third leading cause of mental health–related hospitali-
zation. The top three causes comprised 71% of all mental 
health–related hospitalizations among immigrant females 
but  only  57%  of  mental  health–related  hospitalizations 
among Canadian-born females (Table 2).

Comparison of overall ASHR‑MHs

The overall crude and ASHR-MHs, stratified by sex, are 
shown  in  Table  3.  Among  both  males  and  females,  the 
ASHR-MH among immigrants was almost half that of the 
Canadian-born  cohort.  The  ASHR-MHs  for  immigrants 
were lowest in the economic class, followed by the family 

and refugee classes. In both males and females, ASHR-MH 
was lowest for those who landed in more recent years and 
also for those from East Asia.

Cause‑specific ASHR‑MHs

Using the three leading causes of mental health–related hos-
pitalizations among immigrant males, the crude rates and 
ASHR-MHs for the top three mental health–related condi-
tions for Canadian-born and immigrant males are shown 
in Table 4. For both substance-related disorders and mood 
disorders, immigrant males had lower ASHR-MHs than 
Canadian-born males. However, for psychotic disorders, 
immigrant males had a comparable rate to Canadian-born 
males per 10,000 population (8.9, 95% CI=8.5–8.9 vs 8.7, 
95% CI=8.5–9.4, respectively).

Among immigrant males, economic immigrants had the 
lowest ASHR-MH for all three leading causes compared to 
family class immigrants and refugees. Refugees had higher 
ASHR-MHs, particularly for psychotic disorders. By world 
region of origin, those from the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan 
Africa had elevated ASHR-MH for psychotic disorders, but 
relatively low ASHR-MH for substance-related disorders, 
compared to immigrant males from other world regions.

Table 5 shows the crude and ASHR-MH for the three lead-
ing causes of mental health–related hospitalizations among 
Canadian-born and immigrant females. For both mood and 
neurocognitive  disorders,  immigrant  females  had  lower 
ASHR-MHs compared to Canadian-born females. However, 
similar to the pattern seen among males, the ASHR-MH 
for psychotic disorders was similar between immigrant and 
Canadian-born females (5.8, 95% CI=5.8–6.1 vs 5.3, 95% 
CI=4.9–5.6 per 10,000 population, respectively). Among 
female immigrants, those admitted under the economic class 
also had the lowest ASHR-MH for all three leading causes

of mental health–related hospitalization compared to those 
admitted under the family and refugee classes. In particu-
lar, refugees had high ASHR-MHs for mood disorders and 
psychotic disorders. Immigrant females from the Caribbean 
and from sub-Saharan Africa had elevated ASHR-MH for 
psychotic disorders compared to female immigrants from 
other world regions. For mood disorders, the ASHR-MHs 
were comparable across multiple regions, although those 
from the USA and from Western Europe had ASHR-MHs 
most comparable to those of Canadian-born females.

Discussion

This study compared mental health hospitalization rates over-
all and for specific mental health conditions for immigrants 
and Canadian-born individuals, stratified by sex, world region 
of origin, and several immigration characteristics. Overall, 
the ASHR-MHs were lower among immigrants than among 

the Canadian-born cohort. Among immigrants, ASHR-MHs 
were higher for refugees and lower for economic immigrants, 
those who landed more recently, and those from East Asia.

The  observed  lower  ASHR-MH  among  immigrants, 
together with increasing ASHR-MHs the longer immigrants 
have spent living in Canada, is consistent with a healthy 
immigrant effect for mental health observed in previous 
studies (Abebe et al., 2017; Chen & Vargas-Bustamante, 
2011; Derr, 2016; Elamoshy & Feng, 2018; Islam et al., 
2018; Ng & Omariba, 2010; Ng & Zhang, 2020; Nwoke 
et al., 2020; Salami et al., 2017; Wu & Schimmele, 2005). 
However,  unlike  many  studies  that  include  in-  and  out- 
patient mental health service use (Abebe et al., 2017; Chen 
& Vargas-Bustamante, 2011; Derr, 2016; Durbin et al., 2014, 
2015; Islam et al., 2018; Kirmayer et al., 2007; Nwoke et al., 
2020), our study exclusively examined mental health–related 
hospital discharges, and therefore, may have greater repre-
sentation of individuals with severe mental health condi-
tions. Previous studies have hypothesized that some of the

observed healthy immigrant effect for mental health could 
be due to a lack of access to mental health care services or 
stigma related to seeking care (Chen & Vargas-Bustamante, 
2011; Derr, 2016; Durbin et al., 2014,  2015; Islam et al., 
2018; Nwoke et al., 2020). As the majority of mental health 
care in Canada is delivered in an outpatient setting, severe 
events could more likely result in hospitalization. In these 
instances, the serious impact of mental illness on the indi-
vidual’s daily life could outweigh their reluctance to seek 
care due to stigma. More research is needed to determine 
whether the lower rates of hospitalization among immigrants 
reflect lower rates of mental illness, decreased awareness 
or recognition of symptoms of mental illness (Javed et al., 
2021), or unmet mental health needs.

Among immigrants, those admitted under the economic 
class had the lowest ASHR-MH, while rates among family 
and refugee class immigrants were substantially higher and 
closer to those observed among Canadian-born individuals. 

Previous studies of mental health service use in Canada have 
shown higher utilization rates for refugees than for non-
refugees (Derr, 2016; Durbin et al., 2014; Saunders et al., 
2018; Vigod et al., 2017). Also, elevated rates of mental ill-
ness among refugees and asylum seekers have been shown 
to persist for several years after arrival (Blackmore et al., 
2020). Exposures to multiple stressors or traumatic events 
have been hypothesized as a potential explanation for these 
findings (Blackmore et al., 2020) as experiences prior to and 
during the refugee migration process may contribute to the 
higher observed ASHR-MH.

Psychotic disorders were the leading and second high-
est cause of mental health–related hospitalization for male 
(34%) and female immigrants (28%), respectively. How-
ever,  psychotic  disorders  were  not  among  the  top  three 
causes  of  mental  health–related  hospitalizations  among 
Canadian-born females (accounting for only 10% of mental 
health–related hospitalizations) and accounted for only 18%

of mental health–related hospitalizations among Canadian-
born men. For both males and females, the overall ASHR-
MHs for psychotic disorders were similar for immigrants and 
Canadian-born individuals. This pattern was mainly driven 
by high ASHR-MHs among refugees, as ASHR-MHs among 
economic and family class immigrants were either similar 
to or lower than those observed among the Canadian-born 
cohort. Most previous studies of mental health service use 
in Canada have not described the specific conditions being 
treated (Durbin et al., 2014, 2015; Islam et al., 2018; Kir-
mayer et al., 2007; Nwoke et al., 2020), such that direct com-
parisons of utilization rates related to psychotic disorders are 
not possible. However, the current results are consistent with 
a recent analysis of psychotic disorders among immigrants 
and refugees in Ontario, which found that the overall inci-
dence of psychotic disorders was similar in the immigrant 
and general Canadian populations, while elevated rates were 
seen among refugees (Anderson et al., 2015). Increased rates 

of psychotic disorders among refugees could be a result of 
adverse and stressful experiences in childhood and adult-
hood (Beards et al., 2013; Matheson et al., 2013), and also 
due to difficulties in diagnosing mental health conditions in 
this population. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder 
and adjustment disorder can be particularly challenging to 
identify and these conditions can be misdiagnosed as psy-
chotic disorders (Adeponle et al., 2012; Cloitre et al., 2014), 
which could contribute to elevated rates among refugees.

Neurocognitive disorders were among the top causes of 
mental health hospitalizations among immigrant and Cana-
dian-born females, but not among males. Mental health con-
ditions in this category include diagnoses such as dementia. 
This study’s finding is consistent with a higher prevalence of 
diseases such as dementia in women. Specifically, a report 
from the Alzheimer’s Society of Canada indicated that, in 
2014, women represented 65% of dementia cases among 
those over the age of 65 (Chambers et al., 2016).

Similar to results from a previous study of all-cause hos-
pitalization in this population (Ng et al., 2021), the ASHR-
MHs were lowest among immigrants from East Asia. As in 
the previous study (Ng et al., 2021), this observation may be 
partially attributable to the fact that a substantial proportion 
of immigrants from East Asia in the cohort were economic 
class applicants, among whom the ASHR-MHs were lowest. 
In addition, previous studies have suggested that there may 
be higher levels of stigma related to mental health conditions 
among immigrants from East Asia that may include a failure 
to recognize a mental health issue (Abe-Kim et al., 2007; Chen 
et al., 2009; Chen & Kazanjian, 2005; Durbin et al., 2015; 
Javed et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2011; Tiwari & Wang, 2006). 
If seeking care is associated with subsequent hospitalization, 
a failure to recognize a mental health issue or a reluctance to 
seek care could be consistent with lower hospitalization rates. 
Previous studies have shown lower rates of mental health ser-
vice use among immigrants from East Asia (Abe-Kim et al., 
2007; Chen et al., 2009; Chen & Kazanjian, 2005; Derr, 2016). 
However, if more serious conditions are more likely to disrupt 
daily life and lead to care-seeking resulting in hospitalization, 
the potential impacts of stigma may have been minimal.

The proportion of mental health hospitalizations attributed 
to substance use and addictive disorders was higher among 
males than among females for both the Canadian-born (22.3% 
vs 11.9%) and immigrant (24.2% vs 6.6%) cohorts. The obser-
vation of a higher prevalence of these disorders in males than 
in females is consistent with other data from both Canada 
(Pearson et al., 2013) and other countries (Grant et al., 2004; 
Seedat et al., 2009). These differences may be the result of dif-
ferential access to substances, where a recent review indicated 
that men are generally more likely than women to have access 
to substances (McHugh et al., 2018). In addition, although 
some studies have indicated that women may present to treat-
ment more quickly after disorder onset, they also perceive 
more barriers to treatment than men and overall treatment 
rates are slightly lower among women (McHugh et al., 2018).

Strengths and limitations

This study is the first to use the IMDB-DAD-OMHRS linked 
database to examine the distribution of cause-specific mental 
health–related hospitalizations for immigrants across Canada. 
The inclusion of data from almost all regions allowed for a 
large-scale population-based assessment of mental health in 
immigrants and greater overall scope compared to studies 
that have focused on smaller jurisdictions or specific settings 
(Chen et al., 2008, 2009; Durbin et al., 2014, 2015; Islam 
et al., 2018; Kirmayer et al., 2007). Detailed immigration 
data from the IMDB also allowed for assessment of mental 
health hospitalization by unique migration-related variables.
Despite these strengths, some limitations are to be noted. 
For one, the data are not fully nationally representative due 

to the exclusion of data from Quebec. In addition, this study 
did not consider potential barriers to accessing mental health 
services among immigrant or Canadian-born populations. 
As such, it is not possible to assess whether higher rates 
of hospitalization among the Canadian-born cohort repre-
sent true differences in the prevalence of specific mental 
health conditions between these populations, or whether 
they reflect varying access to services that might lead to 
subsequent hospitalization. Previous studies have found bar-
riers to mental health care among immigrant populations, 
including knowledge of and access to existing services, fail-
ure to recognize mental health issues, and potential social 
stigma associated with using services (Chen et al., 2008, 
2009; Chen & Vargas-Bustamante, 2011; Derr, 2016; Dur-
bin et al., 2014, 2015; Islam et al., 2018; Javed et al., 2021; 
Nwoke et al., 2020; Saunders et al., 2018). However, most of 
this work has focused on primary care and specialist services 
delivered in the community and it is not clear whether the 
same barriers would apply to hospitalization.

Additional  confounders  could  further  explain  differ-
ences between the immigrant and Canadian-born cohorts, 
and among immigrants themselves. As described earlier, the 
number of applications to different immigration streams var-
ies by country of origin, such that it is not clear to what extent 
immigrant category or region of origin may have the most 
influence on observed trends. Similar confounding could also 
apply across other immigration-related characteristics.

Finally, it is possible that some immigrants who arrived in 
Canada in previous years were no longer living in the country 
at the beginning of the follow-up period due to emigration or 
death. The net effect of including such individuals in the anal-
ysis would be an underestimation of the ASHR-MH among 
immigrants. As described in earlier work (Ng et al., 2021), 
death certificates were used to adjust for mortality and tax 
filing data accounted for emigration in the immigrant cohort 
(Bérard-Chagnon, 2018; Ng et al., 2021), minimizing potential 
underestimation of hospitalization rates among immigrants.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that the rate of mental health 
hospitalizations was lower among immigrants than among 
the Canadian-born population but that the highest rates 
of mental health hospitalization were among immigrants 
in the refugee and, to a lesser extent, family class. These 
findings could be supplemented with data on mental health 
service use at various access points along the care pathway 
to identify vulnerable groups who may benefit from addi-
tional mental health supports, to improve immigration set-
tlement outcomes, and to potentially reduce mental health 
hospitalization rates.

Contributions to knowledge

Conflict of interest  The authors declare no competing interests.

What does this study add to existing knowledge?

•  This  study  highlights  that  age-standardized  mental 
health–related hospitalization rates are lower among 
immigrants than among Canadian-born individuals.
•  Within the immigrant groups, rates are highest in refugees.
•  Among immigrants, psychotic and mood disorders were 
found to be important causes of mental health–related 
hospitalizations.

What are the key implications for public health interven-
tions, practice, or policy?

•  Higher  mental  health–related  hospitalization  rates 
among refugees suggest that this is a group that could 
benefit  from  additional  mental  health  supports  to 
improve settlement outcomes.
