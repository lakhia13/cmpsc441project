Abstract

Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder die on average 15–20 years earlier than the general population 
often due to sudden death that, in most cases, is caused by cardiovascular disease. This state-of-the-art review aims to address the complex asso-
ciation between SMI and cardiovascular risk, explore disparities in cardiovascular care pathways, describe how to adequately predict cardiovascular 
outcomes, and propose targeted interventions to improve cardiovascular health in patients with SMI. These patients have an adverse cardiovascular 
risk factor profile due to an interplay between biological factors such as chronic inflammation, patient factors such as excessive smoking, and health-
care system factors such as stigma and discrimination. Several disparities in cardiovascular care pathways have been demonstrated in patients with 
SMI, resulting in a 47% lower likelihood of undergoing invasive coronary procedures and substantially lower rates of prescribed standard secondary 
prevention medications compared with the general population. Although early cardiovascular risk prediction is important, conventional risk predic-
tion models do not accurately predict long-term cardiovascular outcomes as cardiovascular disease and mortality are only partly driven by traditional 
risk factors in this patient group. As such, SMI-specific risk prediction models and clinical tools such as the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram are 
necessary when assessing and managing cardiovascular risk associated with SMI. In conclusion, there is a necessity for differentiated cardiovascular 
care in patients with SMI. By addressing factors involved in the excess cardiovascular risk, reconsidering risk stratification approaches, and imple-
menting  multidisciplinary  care  models,  clinicians  can  take  steps  towards  improving  cardiovascular  health  and  long-term  outcomes  in  patients 
with SMI.

Graphical Abstract

The increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with severe mental illness (SMI) is multifactorial and driven by complex pathways. Patients 
with SMI have a high burden of cardiovascular risk factors and disease, and a major challenge in clinical practice is that these patients tend to neglect 
cardiovascular symptoms, healthcare professionals often overlook and misinterpret cardiovascular signs and symptoms of patients, patients are less 
likely to receive timely and proper cardiovascular care, and treatment adherence is reduced in these patients. Consequently, patients with SMI de-
velop significantly earlier atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and therefore require intensive primary prevention strategies that include a more 
aggressive approach to management of cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors.

Introduction
Approximately 20% of individuals in Europe suffer from mental illness, 
and the lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, often 
jointly termed as severe mental illness (SMI), is nearly 2%.1 Although 
major depression clinically also fulfil criteria for SMI and is associated 
with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, we do not focus on major de-
pression in this state-of-the-art review because it has been extensively 
studied regarding cardiovascular disease2 and is recognized as an inde-
pendent cardiovascular risk factor in several contemporary internation-
al cardiovascular treatment guidelines.3–5

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder generally have a chronic and epi-
sodic clinical course, with intermittent psychotic symptoms in most pa-
tients with schizophrenia6 and with intermittent periods of mood and 
energy fluctuations where psychotic features are less pronounced in 
patients with bipolar disorder.7 Overall, SMI adversely impacts cogni-
tive, behavioural, and emotional domains of patients, which affects func-
tioning in daily life activities.8

A major public health concern is that patients with SMI have a reduced 
life expectancy of 15–20 years relative to the general population, with an 
increased risk of sudden death. The leading cause of early death in the 

general population is cardiovascular disease. This is also true in patients 
with SMI. However, the risk of cardiovascular mortality and sudden car-
diac death (SCD) is up to five-fold higher in patients with SMI,9 across 
both sexes, all ages, and all ethnic groups.10 Both the incidence of cardio-
vascular disease and mortality have declined in the general population 
over recent decades, primarily due to adjustments in lifestyle behaviour, 
advances in cardiac interventions, and increased use of guideline-directed 
medical therapy.11 However, patients with SMI have not benefitted simi-
larly from these interventions on total cardiovascular risk reduction12; 
thus, a mortality gap persists that even may be widening.13–16

Cardiovascular mortality rates in patients with SMI have been found to 
be  increased  based  on  mainly  registry-based  studies,16–18 but  this  ap-
proach  carries  a  risk  of  misclassifying  specific  causes  of  death. 
Interestingly, autopsy studies in patients with SMI have not clearly demon-
strated an increase in coronary artery calcification (CAC).19 The use of 
CAC scores obtained from cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans 
does  not  appear  to  be  of  additional  predictive  value  in  patients  with 
SMI.20,21 Data suggest that, even in patients with a low CAC score, there 
is still increased mortality in patients with SMI that is three- to four-fold 
that of the non-SMI population.20 At the time of CAC scoring, patients 
with  SMI  tend  to  be  younger  with  higher  proportions  of  smoking,

hypertension, overweight, and diabetes.20 Furthermore, follow-up studies 
after myocardial infarction reveal a mortality rate similar to that observed 
in SMI but not in myocardial infarction compared with the general popu-
lation.15 Overall, these findings suggest that while cardiovascular mortality 
rates may be increased in patients with SMI, the underlying mechanisms 
and specific cardiovascular risk factors require further investigation to bet-
ter understand the association with SMI.

In this state-of-the-art review, we aimed to address the complex re-
lationship  between  SMI  and  cardiovascular  risk  factors,  disease,  and 
mortality as well as disparities in cardiovascular care pathways. We fur-
ther described how to adequately predict future cardiovascular disease 
events in the setting of SMI. Finally, we proposed strategies and future 
directions regarding targeted interventions to improve cardiovascular 
health in patients with SMI.

Cardiovascular risk in severe 
mental illness
The excess cardiovascular disease burden associated with SMI is attrib-
utable to factors that can be addressed from a biological, patient, and 
healthcare system perspective. These factors represent potential bar-
riers and challenges that can be specifically targeted, either alone or 
in combination, to improve cardiovascular health and long-term out-
comes in patients with SMI, as shown in the Graphical Abstract.

Biological factors
The American Heart Association has recognized that SMI predisposes 
young patients to an early onset of atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-
ease (ASCVD) and consequently accelerated incidence of myocardial 
infarction  and  heart  failure,  with  an  associated  increase  in  mortality 
over time.22 Emerging evidence supports that SMI has been associated 
with an older functional biological age, resulting in earlier onset of car-
diovascular risk factors and disease.23,24 This fact underscores the im-
portance  of  strict  management  of  cardiovascular  risk  factors,  early 
cardiovascular screening, and more intensive cardiovascular treatment 
in patients with SMI relative to the general population.9

Abnormal pain threshold or decreased pain sensitivity25 has been 
suggested to be an important mechanism to the increased risk of unrec-
ognized  cardiovascular  disease in patients  with  SMI and  may  explain 
why a subset of patients present with more advanced stages of physical 
disease. Of note, the rate of myocardial infarction that is unrecognized, 
but  identified  by  pathological  Q-waves  on  the  electrocardiogram 
(ECG) as a sign of myocardial scarring, in patients with SMI has been re-
ported to be as high as 75%–85%.26,27 However, such studies would 
benefit from confirmatory work in the era of cardiac magnetic reson-
ance imaging (MRI). Although the mechanism is poorly understood, it 
has  been  suggested  that  the  abnormal  pain  threshold  or  decreased 
pain sensitivity is more related to a different mode of pain expression 
than to a real endogenous analgesia.28

Research suggests that subclinical chronic systemic inflammation and 
dysfunction of the immune system are involved in schizophrenia and 
other chronic neuropsychiatric disorders.29 Although acute inflamma-
tion  represents  an  adaptive  body  response,  the  long-term  conse-
quences  of  persistent  systemic  inflammation  and  activation  of  the 
immune  system  may  be  harmful  in  that  it  has  been  associated  with 
the development of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS), and metabolic syndrome.30,31

Recent data also support shared genetic features between SMI and 
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, considering that altered cardiac 

structure and function have been observed in patients with SMI free of 
cardiovascular risk  factors  and  disease  as  well  as  after  adjustment  for 
both lifestyle and medication effects. Polygenic risk score analyses have 
demonstrated that particularly patients with schizophrenia may be gen-
etically predisposed to cardiometabolic disease, whereas this genetic pre-
disposition  is  not  observed  in  patients  with  bipolar  disorder.32 Novel 
evidence also supports that cardiac MRI findings including several left ven-
tricular parameters have been genetically correlated with SMI.33

Patient factors
In patients with SMI, there is an associated two- to four-fold higher rate 
of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and metabolic syndrome com-
pared with the general population, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, 
these patients are more likely to smoke, be obese, have obstructive 
sleep apnoea, live a sedentary lifestyle, and eat unhealthy.34,35 Most of 
the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are at least to some extent 
present from the first episode of SMI36 and correlate with illness dur-
ation,37 with a more rapid worsening than in patients without SMI.38
Although there is a systematic underrecognition and undertreatment 
of  both  cardiovascular  risk  factors  and  disease  in  patients  with  SMI, 
these patients have higher rates of hospitalizations or outpatient visits 
when subsequently diagnosed with a cardiovascular disease compared 
with the general population.39

In particular, smoking is highly prevalent in patients with SMI, with 
some studies reporting rates up to 80%.40 Smoking cessation may be 
one of the most effective measures for total cardiovascular risk reduc-
tion in patients with SMI, and the need for effective smoking cessation 
interventions  is  underscored  by  epidemiological  data  demonstrating 
that  patients  with  schizophrenia  who  smoke  have  an  86%  higher 
20-year cardiovascular mortality risk than non-smoking patients with 
schizophrenia.41 Smoking cessation interventions are underutilized in 
patients with SMI but are generally as effective as in the general popu-
lation,  with  specialized  treatment  (e.g.  bupropion  and  varenicline) 
showing improved long-term efficacy and high safety.42,43

There is also a complex interaction between markers of metabolic 
syndrome, SMI, and antipsychotic treatment. Although antipsychotics 
have adverse effects on cardiovascular risk by promoting weight gain, 
hyperglycaemia,  and  hyperlipidaemia,  they  have  overall  net  benefits 
on  all-cause  and  specifically  cardiovascular  mortality.16 This  seeming 
paradox44 is  likely  explained  by  greater  psychiatric  stability  through 
antipsychotic treatment translating into improved healthy lifestyle be-
haviours, reduced psychotic-related stress, and greater adherence to

medical interventions, thus reducing cardiometabolic risk factors and 
disease,45 which may potentially be a proxy for better access to health-
care when on treatment.

Due to the nature of SMI, adherence to medication is a significant 
challenge, and patients are often suffering from lack of awareness of 
physical  symptoms,  cognitive  impairment,  social  deprivation,  and 
poor  self-care.9 In  particular,  social  deprivation  has  been  associated 
with poor quality of care and outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart 
disease as well as associated with poor control of cholesterol and blood 
sugar levels.46,47 In addition, cardiovascular risk factors can also worsen 
cognitive  functioning,48 further  contributing  to  non-adherence  and 
poor functioning in patients with SMI.

Healthcare system factors and disparities 
in cardiovascular care pathways
The intersection of SMI and cardiovascular health poses significant chal-
lenges within healthcare systems.35 Patients with SMI often face dispar-
ities in accessing and receiving appropriate cardiovascular care, and a 
main factor influencing this disparity is the pervasive stigma and discrim-
ination  surrounding  mental  illness.49,50 These  negative  attitudes  can 
lead  to  healthcare  providers  overlooking  or  downplaying  physical 
symptoms in patients with SMI. Similarly, patients with SMI may have 
mental  symptoms  overshadowing  the  co-occurring  physical  disease 
(e.g.  diagnostic  overshadowing).51 Consequently,  cardiovascular  risk 
factors may be neglected or inadequately addressed, increasing the like-
lihood of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. A prior study has found 
that the likelihood of undergoing cardiac interventions including coron-
ary revascularization, arrhythmia treatment, and valve and vascular sur-
gery prior to cardiovascular mortality was lower in patients with SMI 
compared with the general population. In contrast, the rate of diagnos-
tic tests in primary care settings including ECG testing, cholesterol and 
diabetes screening, and blood pressure monitoring was similar.52

Fragmentation of care across different healthcare providers and special-
ties is another important factor contributing to disparities in cardiovascular 
care pathways. Patients with SMI often receive treatment from multiple 
providers including mental health specialists, primary care physicians, and 
cardiologists. Communication gaps and lack of care coordination between 
these providers can result in suboptimal management of cardiovascular risk 
factors and inadequate integration of mental and physical healthcare.53

Among healthcare professionals, potential insufficient clinical training 
and awareness about the complex relationship between SMI and car-
diovascular health can impede effective care delivery. Mental health spe-
cialists may not possess comprehensive knowledge of cardiovascular 
risk assessment and management, while cardiovascular specialists may 
have limited understanding of the unique challenges faced by patients 
with SMI. Of note, screening for cardiovascular risk factors in patients 
with SMI occurs at a lower level than that recommended in guidelines 
at psychiatric and primary care settings.54–56 As such, this knowledge 
gap may block the development of tailored and multidisciplinary care 
approaches for this patient population.

Cardiovascular disease in severe 
mental illness

Ischaemic heart disease, revascularization, 
and coronary artery calcification
In the most extensive meta-analysis to date that included 92 studies and 
compared epidemiological data from >3 million patients with SMI and 

>110 million general population controls, SMI was associated with a 
54% increased long-term risk of ischaemic heart disease including myo-
cardial infarction.17 Furthermore, several retrospective studies have de-
monstrated  that  patients  with  SMI  presenting  with  myocardial 
infarction are younger with higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors 
such as smoking and diabetes.57 In keeping with the abovementioned 
discussion of factors precipitating acute cardiovascular disease events 
in SMI, patients are more likely to have atypical symptoms of myocardial 
infarction such as atypical angina or dyspnoea58 and longer symptom 
duration26,27 that  may  result  in  diagnostic  delay  and  prolonged 
door-to-balloon time, thereby potentially increasing risks of cardiovas-
cular mortality, ischaemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure, as well as 
ventricular arrhythmias.

An important starting point for any discussion regarding coronary re-
vascularization in patients with SMI is that although there are particular 
considerations to be made, there is no procedural barrier to perform-
ing revascularization procedures in this patient population, meaning it is 
not  more  procedurally  difficult  to  perform  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. Overall, considerations 
can be grouped into pre-procedural issues (i.e. capacity to consent and 
appropriateness for invasive strategy) and post-procedural issues (i.e. 
risk of delirium, deterioration of SMI symptoms, and, most importantly, 
compliance to antiplatelet treatment). However, patients with SMI are 
less likely to undergo coronary revascularization procedures,12 a finding 
that persists even for those who underwent invasive diagnostic coron-
ary angiography.57 Altogether, patients with SMI have a 47% lower like-
lihood of undergoing cardiac interventions.59 Compared with controls, 
following an ACS event, patients with SMI have increased in-hospital 
mortality, and long-term post-ACS survival is worse in patients with 
SMI compared with the general population.57 Of note, consistent find-
ings  have  been  observed  in  patients  with  SMI  presenting  with 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, where these patients are less likely to 
have initial shockable rhythm and a lower likelihood of undergoing car-
diac interventions.60

A  validated  clinical  marker  for  predicting  ischaemic  heart  disease 
events in asymptomatic individuals in the general population remains 
the Agatston score, a measure of CAC derived from cardiac CT scans.5
However, the association between CAC burden and adverse cardiovas-
cular outcomes has not  been  consistently observed  in patients with 
SMI,20 and a recent study in patients with schizophrenia further found 
similar CAC scores to that of the general population.21 It is possible 
that prior studies only included patients who had a clinical indication 
for CAC score testing, thereby excluding asymptomatic patients with 
SMI with potentially high CAC scores. In addition, it can be speculated 
that patients with SMI with a CAC score of 0 have not yet developed de-
tectable calcified coronary plaques, but they may have fatty streaking and 
early stages of soft and fibrous plaques that pose a high risk for myocar-
dial infarction, although studies are warranted to support this hypothesis 
in patients with SMI. Nonetheless, an autopsy study in patients with SMI 
demonstrated  an  association  between  spectroscopy-imaged  calcium 
quantification and pathological calcification on macroscopic and histo-
logical examination, thus supporting the clinical utility of CAC score test-
ing in this patient population.19

Ventricular arrhythmias and sudden 
cardiac death
Up to 66% of patients with SMI have undetected cardiovascular disease 
prior  to  cardiovascular  death,61 and  a frequent  manifestation  of  un-
detected  cardiovascular  disease  may  be  ventricular  arrhythmias  (i.e. 

Cardiovascular risk in severe mental illness                                                                                                                                                      991

ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation) and SCD, with the latter being 
up to five-fold more common in patients with SMI than in the general 
population.62 This represents significant clinical challenges in patients 
with SMI, but the exact mechanisms behind the association are not fully 
understood.  However,  the  risk  appears  to  be  more  pronounced  in 
younger age groups and is independent of cardiovascular risk factors.62
The  pro-arrhythmic  effect  of  psychotropic  medications  including 
antipsychotics  and  antidepressants  is  an  important  factor  in  under-
standing  the  increased  arrhythmogenic  risk  in  patients  with  SMI.63
Antipsychotic treatment has been associated with various degrees of 
risk of corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation on the ECG,64 ven-
tricular arrhythmias, particularly the polymorphic ventricular tachycar-
dia torsades de pointes, and SCD. In patients exposed to antipsychotics, 
SCD occurs twice as often compared with non-exposed patients, with 
an incidence of ∼15/10 000 years of exposure.65,66 In a prior study, anti-
psychotic exposure has also been strongly associated with an increased 
risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, although it was unclear whether 
the cardiac arrest was preceded by an arrhythmic event.67

Other potential factors associated with ventricular arrhythmias and 
SCD in patients with SMI involve autonomic dysfunction, chronic in-
flammation, oxidative stress, and genetic predisposition. In particular, 
autonomic dysfunction, characterized by increased sympathetic tone 
and  reduced  parasympathetic  activity,  is  common  in  patients  with 
SMI68,69 and may alter cardiac repolarization, reduce heart rate variabil-
ity, and cause ventricular arrhythmias.70 Chronic inflammation and oxi-
dative stress have also been associated with pro-arrhythmic effects by 
altering ion channel function and calcium handling in cardiomyocytes, 
leading to increased arrhythmogenicity.71

Heart failure and altered cardiac structure 
and function
Heart failure in patients with SMI is a concerning cardiovascular compli-
cation secondary to the increased cardiovascular risk and occurs often 
at an earlier age than in the general population.72 Of note, SMI has been 
associated with a more than two-fold increased long-term risk of heart 
failure compared with the general population.17 It is well known that 
cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes as well 
as cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction and atrial fibril-
lation, which often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients 
with  SMI,  play  a  pivotal  role  in  the  development  of  heart  failure.4
However, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurohormonal 
imbalance are also important factors in the pathophysiology of heart 
failure, contributing specifically to left ventricular remodelling and dys-
function.73 Furthermore,  neurohormonal  imbalance  has  been  asso-
ciated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity and altered 
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone  system  regulation  as  a  compensatory 
mechanism, which is responsible for increased preload and afterload 
in early stages of heart failure.70

in 

those 

In addition to the increased rates of cardiovascular risk factors and dis-
ease, antipsychotic exposure has been associated with reduced left ven-
tricular ejection fraction in patients with schizophrenia, and the risk is 
treated  with  clozapine.74–76
especially  pronounced 
Furthermore, high polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia have recently 
been associated with myocardial stiffness and decreased absolute peak 
diastolic strain rates (i.e. diastolic dysfunction), which may increase the 
risk of heart failure.77 Overall, the decreased left ventricular ejection frac-
tion and diastolic dysfunction may be a direct result of the antipsychotic 
treatment or, in combination with the SMI, associated with early diffuse 
myocardial fibrosis and subclinical myocardial inflammation, contributing 

to the development of left ventricular concentric remodelling.78 In con-
trast, patients with bipolar disorder on lithium treatment have not been 
found to experience altered left ventricular systolic and diastolic function 
compared with the general population.79

The complex association between heart failure, left ventricular dys-
function, and SMI has only been scarcely investigated. It appears that 
long-term  heart  failure  outcomes  in  patients  with  SMI  are  adverse 
across the whole heart failure spectrum (i.e. heart failure with reduced, 
mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction) and worst for males. The 
rates for advanced heart failure treatment including implantable cardi-
overter defibrillator use, cardiac resynchronization therapy,  left ven-
tricular  assist  device  implantation,  and  heart  transplantation  are 
similar between patients with SMI and the general population, but pa-
tients  with  SMI  undergoing  these  procedures  have  an  increased  all- 
cause mortality risk.72 Overall, early evaluation and recognition of con-
comitant heart failure and SMI are important to reduce potential dis-
parities  in  heart  failure  care  pathways.  However,  patients  with  SMI 
hospitalized for heart failure tend to receive fewer echocardiograms 
for left ventricular ejection fraction evaluation, despite higher rates of 
heart failure rehospitalizations and 1-year all-cause mortality.80

Atrial fibrillation and oral anticoagulation 
treatment
Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent arrhythmia and associated with 
heart failure and a five-fold increased risk of stroke, leading to death in 
some cases.81 Although patients with SMI have a 78% higher risk of de-
veloping  cardiovascular  disease  compared  with  the  general  popula-
tion,17 the rate of atrial fibrillation has been reported to be lower in 
patients with SMI than in the general population after controlling for 
age and sex.82,83 Importantly, this finding may also reflect potential un-
derdiagnosis of atrial fibrillation in this patient population, and diagnostic 
overshadowing may play an important factor as symptoms such as pal-
pitations or dyspnoea may be misinterpreted by clinicians or patients.

3Despite high-quality evidence of a substantial net benefit from oral 
anticoagulation treatment in general population controls with atrial fibril-
lation, patients with SMI and atrial fibrillation have been found to be less 
likely to receive oral anticoagulants and adhere to treatment, with risks of 
stroke and major bleeding being increased in this patient population.83

Myocarditis
Certain antipsychotics have been associated with myocarditis due to a type 
1 hypersensitivity reaction with eosinophilic predominance, where abun-
dant eosinophils may release toxins and induce apoptosis and necrosis 
of cardiomyocytes.66 Clozapine is by far the antipsychotic that has been as-
sociated with myocarditis the most, although the rate is generally low (vary-
ing from <0.1% in some countries to as high as 3% in Australia).84 Risk 
factors for antipsychotic-associated myocarditis include recent viral, bac-
terial, or parasitic infections, a history of myocardial infarction, pericarditis, 
cardiomyopathy, or heart failure,66 and in relationship to clozapine, a con-
firmed ‘allergic reaction’ that is possibly mostly related to too rapid cloza-
pine titration that induces inflammation.85

Myocarditis may mimic ACS in patients with SMI prescribed antipsy-
chotics and result in myocardial fibrosis, ventricular arrhythmias, and 
potentially SCD. Myocarditis generally occurs within the first months 
of  antipsychotic  treatment  initiation  and  is  diagnosed  by  potential 
ST-segment deviations on the ECG and increased cardiac troponin le-
vels. Patients may present with flu-like symptoms, fever, fatigue, angina, 
or dyspnoea.66 Potential cases of antipsychotic-associated myocarditis 
should always be referred for specialist cardiology assessment.

Cardiac surgery and other cardiac 
conditions
Patients with SMI have been found to have a higher rate of mitral and aortic 
valve disease than the general population.86,87 Evidence for cardiac surgery 
remains largely scarce, but few case reports have reported favourable out-
comes in patients with SMI undergoing valve replacement.88

Right-sided  infective  endocarditis  is  common  in  intravenous  drug 
abusers,89 and  patients  with  SMI  are  specifically  susceptible  because 
of the high rate of intravenous drug abuse in this population.90

Long-term  epidemiological  data  on  bradyarrhythmias,  pacemaker 
implantation procedures, and related outcomes in patients with SMI 
are lacking, and only few cases have been reported in the literature.

Cardiovascular preventive 
strategies in severe mental illness

Primary prevention and cardiovascular 
risk prediction models
Based on the abovementioned biological, patient, and healthcare system 
factors that are involved in the excess cardiovascular risk in patients with 
SMI, tailored primary prevention strategies are critical to reduce the bur-
den of cardiovascular disease, improve long-term outcomes, and reduce 
the  mortality  gap.35 Regular  cardiovascular  risk  assessment  including 
blood pressure monitoring and evaluation of metabolic parameters is im-
portant to screen for and detect cardiovascular risk factors early in this 
patient population.91 However, screening and monitoring of cardiovas-
cular  risk  factors  in  patients  with  SMI  are  generally  suboptimal.92,93
Concerningly, the rate of patients with SMI not treated for established 
cardiovascular risk factors has been reported to be as high as 88% for 
dyslipidaemia, 62% for hypertension, and 30% for diabetes.94–96

The primary contributor to the total attributable risk for ASCVD is the 
lipid profile, particularly elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.97,98 In 
addition, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] elevations are very common, as an almost 
pure genetic factor increasing risks of ASCVD and calcific aortic valve sten-
osis. According to a recent consensus statement, Lp(a) should serve as a 
risk stratifier and be measured at some point in all adults undergoing lipid 
profile testing, preferably in their initial assessment.99 The inclusion of Lp(a) 
in the overall risk assessment improves ASCVD risk stratification, especially 
for patients with extremely high Lp(a) levels. In one study, 31%–63% of 
those with Lp(a) levels >99th percentile were reclassified from moderate 
to higher risk.100 Considering these observations, a more aggressive ap-
proach to lipid management is likely to provide the greatest benefit in re-
ducing ASCVD risk for patients with SMI. The 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines 
for the management of dyslipidaemias101 recognize SMI as a significant 
risk enhancer, suggesting to employ SMI as a modifier when assessing over-
all ASCVD risk. However, the guidelines for managing total ASCVD risk in 
patients  with  SMI  align  with  those  applied  to  patients  without  SMI. 
Although statin treatment is equally effective in lowering LDL-C levels in 
patients with SMI as in the general population, statins are underutilized in 
these  patients,  despite  their  substantially  higher  mortality  risk  from 
ASCVD.101 Future studies should investigate specific targets for LDL-C 
lowering in combination with Lp(a) levels and their association with long- 
term ASCVD outcomes in patients with SMI, aiming to assist clinicians in 
timely risk stratifying patients into low, moderate, or high risk.

Promoting  lifestyle  interventions  including  physical  activity,  healthy 
eating habits, smoking cessation, and drug abuse treatment is essential 
to  reduce  the  cardiovascular  risk  in  this  patient  population.102,103
However,  the  positive  effects  of  such  non-pharmacological  lifestyle 

interventions, if observed, have not proven very effective and are gener-
ally  not  cost  effective  in  patients  with  SMI.104–106 In  addition,  mental 
health specialists should carefully assess cardiovascular adverse effects 
of  psychotropic  medications  and  consider  alternative  agents  with  a 
more  favourable  cardiometabolic  profile  when  treating  patients  with 
SMI.66,107

Early cardiovascular risk prediction is crucial to determine the need for 
initiation of preventive measures as many patients with SMI may experi-
ence SCD as the initial manifestation of undetected cardiovascular disease. 
Various prediction models including the SCORE (Systematic COronary 
Risk Evaluation)5 and the Framingham Risk Score108 have been proposed 
to estimate the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease events. However, 
these models have been found to underestimate cardiovascular risk in pa-
tients with SMI as traditional risk factors only partially explain the excess 
cardiovascular mortality observed in this patient population.109 As a result, 
the PRIMROSE (PRedIction and Management of cardiovascular Risk in 
peOple  with  SEvere  mental  illnesses)  lipid  model  and  the  PRIMROSE 
body mass index model have been specifically developed and validated 
to predict the 10-year risk of incident cardiovascular disease events in pa-
tients with SMI.110 The PRIMROSE model demonstrated that additional 
risk factors contributed to the development of cardiovascular disease in-
cluding social deprivation, SMI subtype, prescriptions for antidepressants 
and antipsychotics, and reports of alcohol  abuse. In patients with SMI, 
the PRIMROSE model predicted incident fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular 
disease events much more strongly than the comparator Framingham Risk 
Score model.110 The PRIMROSE intervention study examined a nurse-led 
intervention for reducing cardiovascular risk, using a cluster randomization 
of general practices, that included adults with SMI, a total cholesterol of 
>5.0 mmol/L, and an additional cardiovascular risk factor. This intervention 
had no beneficial effects on cholesterol levels or statin use, the use of which 
remained low. This cluster randomized trial tested a programme with no 
specific targets for lipid management or blood pressure control.111

The standard 12-lead ECG remains one of the most important clinical 
tools in the diagnosis and risk stratification of cardiovascular disease in pa-
tients with SMI, and it has been demonstrated that adding ECG abnormal-
ities to a conventional cardiovascular risk prediction model increased the 
area under the curve for the 10-year absolute risk prediction of cardiovas-
cular mortality in patients with SMI compared with the general population. 
Furthermore,  both  minor  and  major  ECG  abnormalities  conferred  in-
creased long-term cardiovascular mortality compared with general popu-
lation  controls,  suggesting  high  clinical  utility  of  the  ECG  regarding 
cardiovascular risk assessment in the SMI population.112

Secondary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease
Addressing secondary prevention in patients with SMI is crucial due to their 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease and high rate of associated risk fac-
tors. It is reasonable that these patients may benefit more from the standard 
secondary prevention medications that are offered to the general population 
following a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, several barriers are 
present as to why secondary prevention strategies are difficult to implement 
in this patient population. Most importantly, poor medication adherence is 
common in patients with SMI, leading to suboptimal cardiovascular care.9

Lower  prescription  rates  of  cardiovascular  medications  have  overall 
been observed in patients with SMI compared with the general popula-
tion.12,113 The most extensively researched treatment gap has been per-
formed for post-ACS care, where patients with SMI following myocardial 
infarction were less likely to receive aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, beta-blockers, 
statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor

Table 2  Box table summarizing key clinical recommendations regarding cardiovascular risk assessment and 
management in patients with SMI

1. Overall goals

(a) To establish equality in the management of cardiovascular risk factors and treatment of cardiovascular disease and ensure sufficient accessibility to 

cardiovascular examinations for patients with SMI, comparable with the standards observed in the general population.

(b) To adhere to contemporary international cardiovascular treatment guidelines in the management of patients with SMI.

2. Primary prevention strategy goals

(a) Hypertension is frequent in patients with SMI, but antihypertensive treatment is often underutilized or patients are undertreated. Patients should be 
screened for hypertension early and regularly. Blood pressure control and timely initiation of sufficient antihypertensive treatment are essential to 
mitigate cardiovascular disease risk in these patients.

(b) Dyslipidaemia plays an important role in the premature development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with SMI. Patients, even 
without other risk-enhancing factors, may potentially benefit from a more aggressive approach to lipid management. Although statin treatment is 
equally effective in lowering LDL-C levels in patients with SMI as in the general population, statins are underutilized in these patients.

(c) Diabetes is common at an early stage in patients with SMI, often exacerbated by antipsychotic treatment by altering glucose metabolism and promoting 
weight gain. Regular monitoring of HbA1c levels to assess long-term glucose control is important. Treatment plans should be tailored to both individual 
needs and comorbidities including ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or nephropathy, where SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs are indicated. 
Management should extend beyond medications to include lifestyle modifications and collaborative care.

(d) Smoking rates are increased in patients with SMI, and smoking cessation interventions are generally underutilized. Specialized treatment such as 

bupropion and varenicline shows improved long-term efficacy and high safety in these patients.

(e) Physical inactivity, obesity, unhealthy diet, and substance misuse in patients with SMI are also highly prevalent cardiovascular risk factors. Clinicians are 
strongly encouraged to actively screen for these risk-enhancing factors and implement targeted management strategies by providing guidance on 
lifestyle interventions, patient education, and integrated care approaches.

3. Secondary prevention strategy goals

(a) Patients with SMI may potentially benefit more from the standard secondary prevention treatment that is offered to the general population following a 

diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.

(b) The largest treatment gap is potentially within post-ACS care, where patients with SMI and myocardial infarction are less likely to receive aspirin, P2Y12 
inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, ACEIs/ARBs, or MRAs compared with the general population. The majority of patients with SMI have a lower 
likelihood of undergoing invasive coronary procedures. When treated sufficiently, no differences in post-myocardial infarction mortality are observed 
between patients with SMI and the general population.

4. Integrated healthcare goals

(a) Multidisciplinary care models bridging the gap between mental health, primary care, and cardiology can contribute to more comprehensive and 

effective management of the excess cardiovascular risk in patients with SMI. A comprehensive and individualized approach to managing risk factors is 
essential for optimizing cardiovascular health in the SMI population.

ACEIs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; ARBs, angiotensin receptor blockers; ACS, acute coronary syndrome; GLP-1 RAs, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; HbA1c, 
glycated haemoglobin; LDL-C, LDL cholesterol; MRAs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; SGLT2, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2; SMI, severe mental illness.

blockers, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.58,114–116 A registry- 
based study, investigating the association between exposure to standard 
secondary prevention medications following myocardial infarction and all- 
cause mortality risk, demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia experi-
enced a decrease in mortality risk from a hazard ratio of 8.78 to 1.97 with 
secondary prevention treatment. In contrast, in the general population, the 
absence of secondary prevention treatment increased the mortality risk 
from a hazard ratio of 1.00 (reference) to 2.95.117

Perspectives on improving 
cardiovascular health in patients 
with severe mental illness
A box table summarizing key clinical recommendations regarding cardio-
vascular risk assessment and management in patients with SMI is shown 
in Table 2.

Multidisciplinary care models combining mental health and cardiovascu-
lar care are essential in addressing the unique challenges faced by patients 
with SMI and improving their overall cardiovascular health and long-term 
outcomes.9,118 Primary prevention strategies play a crucial role in mitigat-
ing cardiovascular risk and improving long-term outcomes, while tailored 
approaches including medication management, lifestyle interventions, and 
psychosocial support can enhance secondary prevention strategies in pa-
tients with SMI. Overall, collaborative efforts between mental health spe-
cialists,  cardiologists,  primary  care  physicians,  and  other  healthcare 
professionals are important for effective primary and secondary preven-
tion in this vulnerable patient population.35 To achieve improved long- 
term cardiovascular outcomes and reduce the excess cardiovascular risk 
in patients with SMI, further research is warranted to understand the com-
plex relationship between mental health and cardiovascular disease events, 
ideally paving the way towards more targeted interventions.

Implementing multidisciplinary care models that promote collabor-
ation  across  medical  specialties  can  enhance  cardiovascular  care

pathways for patients with SMI. For example, in mental health and pri-
mary  care  settings,  ECGs  are  routinely  obtained  for  assessing  QTc 
interval  prolongation  while  on  antipsychotic  treatment,  and  in  case 
the QTc interval is within normal limits but other major ECG abnormal-
ities  are  present  such  as  evidence  of  prior  myocardial  infarction  by 
pathological Q-waves, patients with SMI are not necessarily referred 
to cardiologists for secondary evaluation, treatment, and prevention. 
As such, regular communication channels, shared care plans, and joint 
decision-making processes are essential features of this approach. To 
optimize  patient  outcomes,  healthcare  professionals  should  receive 
comprehensive  training on  the  interface between  mental  health  and 
cardiovascular care. Further research and awareness initiatives are war-
ranted to emphasize the importance of both primary and secondary 
prevention in patients with SMI and to develop a comprehensive ap-
proach to cardiovascular health.

Conclusions
Much is known about total cardiovascular risk reduction in the general 
population, and over decades, substantial efforts have been made to im-
prove cardiovascular risk assessment, management, and treatment of 
cardiovascular disease, especially in the era of myocardial reperfusion 
and  cardiac  rehabilitation.  Although  significant  progress  has  been 
made to understand the contribution of SMI in cardiovascular disease, 
patients with SMI have not benefitted from the clinical advances in car-
diology compared with the general population. This current review un-
derscores  the  necessity  for  personalized  cardiovascular  care  and 
management of cardiovascular disease in patients with SMI. By addres-
sing factors involved in the excess cardiovascular risk, reconsidering risk 
stratification approaches, and implementing multidisciplinary care mod-
els, clinicians can take steps towards the necessary improvement of car-
diovascular health and long-term outcomes in patients with SMI.
