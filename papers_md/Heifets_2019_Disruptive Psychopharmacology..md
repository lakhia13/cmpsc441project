The paucity of medications with novel mechanisms for the treatment of mental illnesses 
combined with the delayed response to currently available medications has led to great 
excitement about the potential therapeutic utility of previously demonized drugs, which offer 
the hope of generating rapid symptom reductions in some of the sickest patients. Within the 
past 2 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved esketamine for treatment-
resistant depression and 2 compounds that are still on the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration’s most restrictive schedule, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 
and psilocybin, have received break-through therapy designation. If these latter drugs are 
approved, they will require a new mental health care infrastructure that is capable of 
administering powerful psychoactive substances while simultaneously incorporating 
appropriate psychotherapeutic support. The sheer prevalence of the conditions these drugs 
are meant to treat (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder among other emerging 
indications) will mean that clinicians will have to deal with safety issues, including 
appropriate patient selection, substance abuse potential, and emergent psychiatric and 
medical crises. These considerations justify investment in elucidating the detailed neural 
mechanisms by which these drugs work so that we might better control their safety and 
efficacy while simultaneously developing better treatments with fewer adverse effects.

Investigating Mechanism

Although ketamine, MDMA, and psilocybinare pharmacologically distinct, they share the 
ability to induce an acutely altered state of consciousness, which in the appropriate 
therapeutic context can lead to a rapid therapeutic onset and, to varying degrees, a durable 
treatment effect that persists well after the drug has been cleared from the body. Their effects 
are reminiscent of those of indigenous medicines such as ayahuasca, peyote, and ibogaine, 
which have been used for centuries across many cultures.1,2 It is tempting to hypothesize 
that a common underlying physiological process is at play, given the similarity in these 
drugs’ time courses and the common theme of acute psychological transformation. 
Conversely, it will be important to determine whether these drugs’ benefits are specific to a 
given constellation of symptoms. A survey of currently registered clinical trials suggests

otherwise, as ketamine, MDMA and psilocybin are each being tested for both affective and 
appetitive disorders.

How best to pursue the mechanisms of action for this next generation of therapeutics? We 
have argued for a circuits-firstapproach,3 which involves using the armamentarium of 
modern neuroscience tools to define the circuit adaptations that contribute to a drug’s 
behavioral and therapeutic effects. Once critical circuit nodes are identified, single-cell gene 
profiling can be performed in their key cell types based on their connectivity, yielding novel 
molecular targets for the development of next generation drugs with greater efficacy and 
fewer side effects. Modeling complex human behaviors in animals is particularly valuable 
when the structure and function of the involved neuroanatomy is highly conserved. This is 
likely the case for several neuromodulatory systems that contribute to a host of behaviors of 
direct relevance to psychiatry such as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, prosocial 
approach, aggression, cognitive flexibility, and responses to motivationally significant 
stimuli.

Of course, it is also critical to define the molecular targets of these new therapeutic agents. 
For ketamine, this has been more challenging than originally expected, with findings4,5 
suggesting a need to conceptualize its molecular mechanisms with more nuance than action 
at a single, broadly distributed glutamate receptor. The complexity of ketamine’s actions 
emphasizes the critical importance of determining where in the brain it is exerting its 
therapeutic circuit effects. In contrast to the confusion surrounding ketamine’s molecular 
targets, a prediction of preclinical studies of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a drug with 
significant similarity to psilocybin, has been confirmed with the demonstration that LSD’s 
subjective effects in humans could be blocked by a 5HT2a receptor antagonist.6 Moreover, 
hallucinogen-induced changes in functional connectivity in human imagingstudies2 suggest 
that reverse translation may be possible. For example, it will be advantageous to define the 
actions of 5HT2a receptors in the putative drug-modulated circuits in human brains in more 
experimentally tractable animal brains in which molecular and circuit targets can be 
manipulated with precision and detailed cellular level observations can be made. Identifying 
parallel circuitry that is influenced by classic hallucinogens in both humans and animals will 
be challenging. Nevertheless, the more we can define the relevance of evolutionary 
conserved behavioral parameters to the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention, the higher 
the probability of defining the causal neural mechanisms underlying the drug’s therapeutic 
effects. In turn, more efficacious therapeutic interventions will follow.

Defining Clinical Variables

Great attention has been paid to the therapeutic setting itself in designing trials of MDMA 
and psilocybin because efficacy may well depend on both the drug and the therapeutic 
environment in which it is administered. In patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, 
MDMA, which enhances positive social interactions, may catalyze the extinction of aversive 
memories primarily by strengthening the therapeutic alliance.7 Similarly, the vivid 
experiences during a psilocybin session that are revisited in subsequent therapy sessions may 
be central to its potential therapeutic action in addressing existential issues and sources of 
depression and anxiety.1,2 It follows that we should characterize and test the

psychotherapeutic component as well as the necessity for the specific drug being tested. This 
rigor begins with developing appropriate placebo controls because expectancy bias in trials 
of this nature are likely to have strong effects. Indeed, despite laudable attempts using active 
placebos, both patients and therapists have been able to identify the treatment given.1 Using 
dissociative drugs, such as dextromethorphan, as comparators for psilocybin or 
psychostimulants, such as meth- amphetamine, for MDMA warrants serious consideration. 
These psychoactive controls will help test whether the specific drug being evaluated is 
necessary for the consequent therapeutic effect.

We also need to understand the optimal dose and timing of therapy. What is the importance 
of preparatory and integrative therapeutic sessions relative to the drug session? Analyses of 
psilocybin trial data suggest that the mystical aspect of the acute drug experience scales with 
therapeutic benefit.2 But are all patients capable of generating this kind of subjective state? 
We assume that the events during an acute drug experience are required for a treatment 
effect to occur. But perhaps, the conscious experience of a drug trip is an epiphenomenon 
relative to the therapeutic state the drug produces, an effect that would still occur, for 
example, if the drug of interest was administered during general anesthesia. These 
hypotheses are testable. Furthermore, using standardized measures of therapeutic alliance 
and operant tasks to assess cognitive flexibility and reward sensitivity could help establish 
what parameters are necessary and sufficient to achieve a treatment effect, thereby imbuing 
preclinical mechanistic studies with predictive utility.

Decades ago, the serendipitous discovery of iproniazid’s antidepressant effect and 
chlorpromazine’s antipsychotic efficacy led to the development of drugs that helped millions 
of patients. Preclinical behavioral screening models have had some success in predicting 
efficacy of drugs with pharmacology similar to already approved therapies, but have 
generally failed to yield new therapeutic principles or pathways. It is telling that the current 
wave of therapeutic innovation is based not on insights gained from studying established 
drugs, but rather on a disruptive new therapeutic approach involving compounds that have 
been known for quite some time in other contexts. By applying all the tools in our modern 
armamentarium to understand the mechanisms by which they work, it will be possible to 
develop better therapies, which will make up the next generation of disruptive 
psychopharmacology.
