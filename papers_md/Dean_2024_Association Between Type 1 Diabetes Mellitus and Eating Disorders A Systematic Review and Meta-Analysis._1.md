ABSTRACT
Background: Previous meta- analyses have shown mixed results regarding the association between eating disorders (EDs) and 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Our paper aimed to analyse different EDs and disordered eating behaviours that may be prac-
ticed by patients with T1DM.
Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted on 17 January 2023, using the key terms 
“T1DM,” “Eating Disorders” and “Bulimia.” Only observational controlled studies were included. The Revman software (version 
5.4) was used for the analysis.
Results: T1DM was associated with increased risk of ED compared with nondiabetic individuals (RR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.84–
3.32,  p- value < 0.00001),  especially  bulimia  nervosa  (RR = 2.80,  95%  CI = 1.18–6.65,  p- value = 0.02)  and  binge  eating 
(RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.18–1.98, p- value = 0.001). Our analysis has shown that increased risk of ED among T1DM persisted 
regardless  of  the  questionnaire  used  to  diagnose  ED;  DM- validated  questionnaires  (RR = 2.80,  95%  CI = 1.91–4.12,  p- 
value < 0.00001) and generic questionnaires (RR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.27–3.23, p- value = 0.003). Prevalence of insulin omission/
misuse was 10.3%; diabetic females demonstrated a significantly higher risk of insulin omission and insulin misuse than 
diabetic males.
Conclusion: Our study establishes a significant and clear connection between EDs and T1DM, particularly bulimia and binge 
eating, with T1DM. Moreover, female diabetics are at higher risk of insulin misuse/omission. Early proactive screening is essen-
tial and tailored; comprehensive interventions combining diabetes and ED components are recommended for this population, 
with referral to a specialised psychiatrist.

1   |   Introduction

Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by excessive concern 
regarding  body  weight  that  results  in  unhealthy  eating  hab-
its and behaviours [1]. A previous meta- analysis conducted in 
2005  has  found  that  bulimia  nervosa  (BN),  a  type  of  ED,  is 
significantly associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 
while  such  an  association  was  not  seen  between  anorexia 
nervosa (AN) and T1DM [2]. On the contrary, a more recent 
meta- analysis,  conducted  in  2013,  has  shown  an  insignifi-
cant  association  between  ED  and  T1DM  compared  with  the 
healthy  controls  [3].  The  observed  relationship  between  EDs 
and T1DM appears to result from a complex interplay between 
individual  and  environmental  factors  in  the  development  of 
EDs. T1DM was linked to multiple risk factors for EDs such 
as  higher  BMI,  low  self- esteem  and  dietary  restraint.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  T1DM  may  practice  several  forms  of 
disordered eating behaviours (DEBs), which are milder forms 
of EDs, such as unhealthy dieting and purging. Furthermore, 
patients with T1DM are treated via lifelong insulin adminis-
tration which could adversely result in weight gain [4]. Recent 
studies have coined a new term, ‘Diabulimia’ which refers to 
the  limitation  or  skipping  of  insulin  doses  by  patients  with 
T1DM, commonly observed among adolescents, with the ob-
jective of weight control [5]. This is further reinforced by De 
Paoli et al. findings, which concluded that insulin restriction 
is a DEB among patients with T1DM. Insulin omission could 
lead to devastating outcomes such as life- threatening diabetic 
ketoacidosis and earlier onset of diabetic microvascular com-
plications [6]. Other potential unhealthy behaviours practiced 
by patients with T1DM to control their weight include exces-
sive exercise and diuretic abuse [7].

The presence of EDs in individuals with T1DM poses a signif-
icant health risk. It is associated with compromised metabolic 
control  and  approximately  a  threefold  increase  in  the  risk  of 
diabetic  retinopathy  [8],  along  with  adverse  short- term  and 
long- term  physical  consequences  [9,  10].  Additionally,  it  has 
detrimental psychological effects, including lower psychosocial 
quality of life, diminished subjective well- being and fewer effec-
tive coping strategies [11].

In  2005  and  2013,  two  meta- analyses  were  conducted  on 
this  topic  [2,  3].  Since  then,  multiple  studies  have  been  pub-
lished;  accordingly,  we  aimed  to  analyse  the  association  be-
tween  T1DM  and  EDs  as  well  as  different  subtypes  of  EDs. 
Moreover, we aimed to study the potential DEBs practiced by 
patients  with  T1DM  that  could  lead  to  harmful  outcomes  in 
the long run.

2   |   Methods

This  study  was  conducted  according  to  Preferred  Reporting 
Items  for  Systematic  reviews  and  Meta- Analyses  (PRISMA) 
guidelines  [12],  and  its  protocol  was  registered  on  Prospero 
(CRD42023392418).

2.1   |   Search Strategy

A literature search of the following databases: PubMed, Scopus 
and Web of Science on 17 January 2023, using key terms such 

as “T1DM,” “Eating Disorders” and “Bulimia,” was performed 
to identify the studies of interest (view Appendix S1 for the full 
search strategy).

2.2   |   Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We screened studies by titles and abstracts according to the fol-
lowing criteria:

Inclusion  criteria:  Cross- sectional  and  controlled  observa-
tional studies with data on the prevalence of EDs among pa-
tients with T1DM, including case–control and cohort studies. 
No restriction was made regarding the date of publication of 
the studies.

Exclusion  criteria:  Uncontrolled  observational  studies,  editori-
als, letters to the editor, commentaries, reviews, systematic re-
views,  meta- analyses,  case  reports,  case  series,  animal  studies 
and studies in a language other than English.

In the case of duplicate studies, the most recent study with the 
largest study population was included.

2.3   |   Study Selection

For each study, two independent co- authors (P.R. and M.A.) re-
viewed the studies according to our criteria. If a consensus is not 
achieved, a third independent reviewer (Y.E.D.) was assigned to 
resolve the conflict.

2.4   |   Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

For each included study, two independent co- authors (A.E. and 
W.D.) extracted the data according to our criteria. If a consensus 
is  not  achieved,  a  third  independent  reviewer  (Y.E.D.)  was  as-
signed to resolve the conflict.

For  the  baseline  and  summary,  the  following  data  were  ex-
tracted from the eligible studies relevant to the authors: first au-
thor's name, year of publication, country, study design, sample 
size;  and  relevant  for  the  studies  extracted:  age,  gender,  BMI, 
duration of diabetes, HbA1c, age at onset of diabetes, type of ED 
questionnaire and a brief conclusion.

For  the  outcomes,  the  following  data  were  extracted:  EDs 
(assessment  based  on  diabetes  mellitus- validated  or  gen-
eral  questionnaires  such  as  Eating  Attitude  Test  26  or  40 
[EAT],  Assessment  of  Anorexia–Bulimia—Teenager  ver-
sion  [BAB- T],  The  Bulimic  Investigatory  Test,  Edinburgh 
[BITE],  Children's  Depression  Inventory  [CDI],  Children's 
Eating  Disorder  Examination  [cEDE],  The  Assessing  Health 
and  Eating  among  Adolescents  with  Diabetes  [AHEAD], 
The  Eating  Disorder  Examination  Questionnaire  [EDE- Q], 
Eating  Disorder  Inventory  [EDI],  The  Problematic  Eating 
Behavior  Examination  Questionnaire  [PEBE- Q]  and  Rating 
for  Anorexia  and  Bulimia  [RAB- T]),  AN,  bulimia,  binge 
eating,  Dieting  Subscale  EAT  26,  Bulimia  Subscale  EAT  26, 
BITE symptom subscale, BITE severity subscale, behaviours 
including  regular/excessive  exercise,  vomiting,  laxatives, 
diuretic  misuse,  binge  eating,  diet  pills  use  and  insulin 
omission/misuse.

Diabetes  Mellitus- Validated  Eating  Disorder  Questionnaires 
are ED questionnaires that have been shown to be reliable and 
valid  screening  measures  for  EDs  in  both  diabetic  and  non-
diabetic  populations.  We  have  classified  the  questionnaires 
in a similar manner to the earlier meta- analysis conducted in 
2013 [3].

The risk of bias was assessed utilising Newcastle- Ottawa Scale 
(NOS) items [13], with a total score of nine points, to evaluate 
the  quality  of  observational  studies.  We  defined  the  observa-
tional studies with a NOS score of ≥ 7 stars as high quality and 
NOS score of < 7 stars as low quality.

2.5   |   Data Analysis

Data  were  analysed  by  the  RevMan  software,  version  5.4. 
Sensitivity  analysis  (leave- one- out  test  and  subgroup  analy-
sis) was used. If no heterogeneity was observed, results were 
presented in a fixed effect model, and a random effect model 
if significant heterogeneity was observed. A relative risk (RR) 
with  a  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  was  used  to  present  di-
chotomous data, while mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI 
was used to present continuous data. Results were considered 
significant  if  the  p- value  was  < 0.05.  Heterogeneity  was  de-
fined  as  the  variation  or  diversity  in  study  outcomes  among 
the  studies  included  in  the  meta- analysis.  It  may  be  due  to 
different  factors,  such  as  the  characteristics  of  the  partici-
pants,  study  designs,  the  methods  of  analysis  or  the  sources 
of bias [14].

3.1   |   Literature Search

After a search of the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science on 17 
January 2023, 1790 studies resulted, of which 1020 studies were 
found eligible for title and abstract screening after the removal 
of duplicates. Of the 1020, 828 were irrelevant and 192 studies 
were eligible for full- text screening. Finally, 14 studies [15–28] 
were included in the meta- analysis after full- text screening, as 
shown in the PRISMA in Figure 1.

The total number of patients included in the study is 9079 pa-
tients, 1391 patients in the T1DM group and 7688 individuals in 
the control group; other baseline data are shown in Table 1. The 
quality assessment of the included studies is shown in Table 2.

3.2   |   Outcomes

3.2.1   |   Eating Disorder

The  pooled  analysis  showed  a  statistically  significant  associa-
tion between the diabetes group and an increased incidence of 
ED compared with the control group (RR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.84–
3.32, p- value < 0.00001). We observed no significant heterogene-
ity among studies (p = 0.41, I2 = 2%) (Figure 2).

4   |   Discussion

Our  analysis  demonstrated  that  EDs  were  significantly  prev-
alent  among  patients  with  T1DM  compared  with  the  nondi-
abetic  individuals,  specifically  BN  and  binge  eating,  while  no 
significant  association  was  seen  between  T1DM  and  AN.  The 
subgroup  analysis,  employing  both  DM- Validated  and  Generic 
questionnaires  for  measuring  EDs,  revealed  a  statistically  sig-
nificant  correlation  between  ED  and  T1DM.  Additionally,  the 
Eating Attitudes Test- 26 (EAT) showed a significant increase in 
the dieting and bulimia subscales among patients with T1DM. 
Furthermore, the Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh (BITE) 
showed  a  significant  increase  in  the  symptom  subscale;  how-
ever, no significant difference was detected between T1DM and

misuse was 10.3%; diabetic females demonstrated a significantly 
higher risk of insulin omission and misuse than diabetic males. 
An analysis of other DEB showed insignificant associations be-
tween excessive exercise, dieting pills misuse, diuretics misuse 
and T1DM.

Commencing  with  an  analysis  of  the  subgroup  data  derived 
from DM- Validated and Generic questionnaires assessing the 
prevalence  of  EDs,  our  research  yielded  intriguing  results. 
Notably,  we  observed  a  significant  association  between  the 
diagnosis  of  EDs,  as  indicated  by  both  DM- Validated  and 
Generic questionnaires, and T1DM. These findings appear to 
diverge from the findings of Young et al., who posited that the 
prevalence of EDs is highly contingent upon the specific mea-
surement  tools  employed.  Young  et  al.'s  research  indicated 
that  the  effect  size  for  EDs,  as  determined  by  DM- validated 
questionnaires, exhibited statistical significance in relation to 
T1DM,  whereas  generic  questionnaires  did  not.  Their  study 
suggested that the use of generic measures might lead to in-
flated  prevalence  estimates  [3].  It  is  important  to  note  that 
their  study  might  have  been  constrained  by  an  insufficient 
sample size as it was conducted in 2013 and did not account 
for  the  literature  published  thereafter,  potentially  affecting 
the statistical power of their analysis.

Based  on  our  findings,  we  observed  a  significant  correlation 
between EDs and T1DM. These results corroborate the conclu-
sions drawn by Young et al., who arrived at a similar outcome. 
However,  it  is  noteworthy  that  this  association  appears  to  be 
highly influenced by the method used to assess eating issues [3]. 
In contrast, Robertson and Rosenvinge and Troncone et al. did 
not discover a substantial link between EDs and T1DM. These 
studies had limitations, including a relatively small sample size. 
Moreover, Troncone et al. relied on parental evaluations, intro-
ducing potential bias [15, 18].

Our  research  demonstrates  a  significant  connection  between 
BN and T1DM, while AN does not exhibit the same association. 
These findings align with Mannucci et al.'s [2] previous meta- 
analysis.  In  addition,  García- Reyna  et  al.'s  [25]  results  found 
significant  BN- T1DM  associations  in  men  but  not  in  women. 
Robertson and Rosenvinge [15] also found similar results con-
cerning AN and T1DM. In contrast, Engström et al. [26] reported 
no significant BN- T1DM association; however, their study had a 
higher number of BN cases in the T1DM group, with the main 
limitation being a female- only study population. Colton et al.'s 
[27]  research  supports  our  findings  regarding  the  significant 
link  between  binge  eating  and  T1DM.  Smith  et  al.  [17]  found 
that bulimia and binge EDs were more common in the diabetic 
group than in the control group.

Concerning the Dieting and Bulimia Subscales of the EAT 26 
scoring and their relationship with T1DM, our results reveal 
a statistically significant connection. Similar results were re-
ported  by  Roohafza  et  al.  [23],  while  Pinar  [29]  found  simi-
lar  results,  albeit  only  regarding  the  Dieting  Subscale  of  the 
EAT 40 scoring, which is the precursor to the EAT 26 scoring 
[30].  Alice  Hsu  et  al.,  however,  reported  a  significant  asso-
ciation  between  the  Bulimia  Subscale  of  the  EAT  26  scoring 
and T1DM but found no association with the Dieting Subscale 
[24].  This  discrepancy  may  be  attributed  to  their  relatively 
small sample size, which limited the ability to draw definitive 

conclusions, and the differences in educational levels between 
the control and T1DM groups, which may introduce the possi-
bility of selection bias.

In terms of the BITE symptom and severity subscales, we did 
not  find  a  significant  association,  but  Alice  Hsu  et  al.  and 
Robertson and Rosenvinge reported mixed results. Alice Hsu 
et al. contradicted our findings regarding the BITE symptom 
subscale but aligned with us regarding the BITE severity sub-
scale  [24].  Robertson  and  Rosenvinge  [15],  on  the  contrary, 
reported no association between the BITE symptom subscale 
and T1DM, similar to our findings, but did find a significant 
connection  with  the  BITE  severity  subscale.  These  mixed 
results  may  be  attributed  to  both  studies'  limited  statistical 
power due to small sample sizes. Additionally, Robertson and 
Rosenvinge  [15]  exclusively  studied  women,  omitting  male 
participants.

Additionally, on examining different DEBs, such as regular/ex-
cessive  exercise,  restricted  food  intake/fasting,  vomiting,  laxa-
tive use and insulin omission/misuse, we found no statistically 
significant  associations  except  for  insulin  omission/misuse. 
Alice Hsu et al. also reported no significant association between 
vomiting, laxative use and T1DM [24]. Ackard et al. [20] yielded 
similar results across all eating behaviours analysed, highlight-
ing a concerning percentage of T1DM participants who skipped 
or misused insulin doses. Furthermore, studies focusing on in-
sulin misuse/omission corroborate our findings. Pinar [29] dis-
covered  a  significant  association  between  insulin  misuse  and 
T1DM, while Stancin et al. [31] reported that some female pa-
tients with diabetes intentionally omitted or underdosed insulin 
for weight reduction, even if they did not meet the criteria for an 
ED. Schober et al. [32] uncovered that nearly 30% of participants 
with  T1DM  intentionally  manipulated  insulin  dosages  and  fe-
males being more at risk.

While  a  few  studies  contradict  our  eating  behaviour  analysis, 
such  as  Colton  et  al.  [27],  who  found  a  significant  association 
between  excessive  exercise  and  T1DM,  and  Smith  et  al.  [17], 
who  reported  a  higher  prevalence  of  excessive  exercise  and 
self- induced  vomiting  in  the  T1DM  group,  both  studies  had 
limitations,  including  low  participation  rates  and  potential  re-
cruitment bias from specialised clinics.

Given these findings, it is imperative to proactively screen and 
identify adolescents at risk of EDs. This can be achieved by em-
ploying evidence- based tools such as the EAT 26 questionnaire 
analysed in the present study to accurately assess the presence 
of EDs/DEBs or the use of specific questionnaires for use in in-
vestigating ED in the diabetic population such as the Diagnostic 
Survey  for  Eating  Disorders  (DSED)  and  the  Diabetes  Eating 
Problems  Survey  (DEPS),  which  includes  the  assessment  of 
Insulin manipulation, and should be performed by trained ex-
perienced healthcare provider interviewers. This proactive ap-
proach is especially vital during adolescence, as individuals in 
this  age  group  may  be  inclined  to  hide  their  issues  [33]  or  un-
derreport  behavioural  problems  related  to  their  diabetes  [34]. 
Moreover,  we  suggest  the  creation  of  comprehensive  interven-
tions tailored to this demographic, encompassing both diabetes 
and ED components that run concurrently.

It  is  noteworthy  to  highlight  the  results  of  Clery  et  al.,  who 
demonstrated that individuals with EDs associated with T1DM

exhibit a less favourable response to conventional ED treatment 
and show limited improvement in their diabetes control. These 
findings suggest that individuals with T1DM- related EDs may 
necessitate an alternative approach with a different level of in-
tensity in their intervention [35].

4.1   |   Strengths and Limitations

This  study  has  analysed  the  findings  of  9079  individuals, 
which  is  more  than  triple  the  size  of  the  meta- analysis  con-
ducted by Mannucci et al. in 2005, with a sample size of 2592. 
Furthermore, their study only included females and their analy-
sis of EDs was limited to AN and BN, whereas we analysed AN, 
BN,  binge  eating,  Dieting  Subscale  EAT  26,  Bulimia  Subscale 
EAT  26,  BITE  symptom  subscale,  BITE  severity  subscale  and 
different  maladaptive  behaviours  practiced  by  patients  with 
T1DM [2]. Another meta- analysis conducted by Young et al. [3] 
didn't account for papers published after 2013.

It  is  important  to  note  that  ED  entails  avoidant/restrictive  food 
intake disorder (ARFID) and binge eating disorder (BED); due to 
the lack of data, we could not run subgroup analyses on these EDs. 
Moreover, we could not analyse how the duration of diabetes, age 
of diabetics, race, socioeconomic status and BMI could potentially 
affect  the  association  between  T1DM  and  EDs.  Further  studies 
are warranted to explore the potential effects of these factors on 
the development of EDs among patients with T1DM.

5   |   Conclusion

Our  study  establishes  a  significant  and  clear  connection  be-
tween  EDs  and  T1DM,  particularly  bulimia  and  binge  eating, 
with T1DM. Moreover, female diabetics are at higher risk of in-
sulin  misuse/omission.  Early  proactive  screening  is  essential, 
and  tailored,  comprehensive  interventions  combining  diabetes 
and ED components are recommended for this population, with 
referral to a specialised psychiatrist.
