Chronic pain can pose a serious challenge in everyday life for many individuals globally,
especially in developing countries, but studies explicitly exploring risk factors of chronic pain
beyond demographic characteristics using survey data have been scarce. To address this
problem, this study analyzed World Health Organization data on chronic pain in Ukraine to
explore demographic, psychological, and treatment perception-related risk factors to
chronic pain. We replicated previous reports of older age, female sex, married status, inade-
quate financial resources, and comorbidity of other physical conditions as significant demo-
graphic risk factors for chronic pain diagnosis but not necessarily for severe pain. We also
found evidence for psychological risk factors and treatment perceptions as significant pre-
dictors for chronic pain diagnosis and its severity. These results provide a first step in exam-
ining beyond demographic risk factors for chronic pain diagnosis and severity and, instead,
assessing potential psychological risk factors.

Introduction

The challenges of chronic pain affect many individuals globally, with at least 41% of Europeans
in developing countries diagnosed with chronic pain.[1] Despite the prevalence of this illness,
two-thirds of patients lack treatment, which in turn impacts the government and societal func-
tions detrimentally.[1,2] While large-scale epidemiological data have provided a wealth of
information on demographic risk factors for chronic pain in developing countries, few studies
have explicitly explored psychological risk factors of chronic pain and the role of treatment
perceptions in its diagnosis and severity using survey-wide data.[3]

Currently, the risk factors for chronic pain diagnosis have consistently included being
female, over the age of 40, currently married, with coexisting physical conditions.[2–4] For
psychological risk factors, only comorbidity of chronic pain and psychiatric diagnosis and the
role of psychological stress on chronic pain have been reported.[3,5–7] However, whether psy-
chiatric diagnosis and non-specific psychological distress are risk factors predictive of chronic

pain diagnosis and its severity is less clear. Moreover, how perceptions of medical treatment
might impact the trajectory of chronic pain’s severity also remains unclear. While medical
treatment stigma and perceived treatment efficacy have been consistently cited as two factors
critical to understanding the onset of chronic pain, few studies have used survey data to explic-
itly examine the link between the perceptions of medical treatment and chronic pain on a
larger scale.[8–9]

The purpose of this study was to bridge the gap between theories about chronic pain risk
factors that go beyond demographic risk factors and large-scale survey data on chronic pain
psychological and treatment perception risk factors for chronic pain diagnosis and its severity
using World Health Organization data collected from the Ukrainian population. Ukraine was
particularly relevant for this study as many Ukrainians report low satisfaction with the health-
care system and the irregular payment schedule leads to distrust of the medical care system.
[10] Moreover, rates of mental health problems in Ukraine are high, and significant somatic
symptom complaints have been reported in previous Chernobyl residents, suggesting that
somatic symptom complaints may be of particular importance to Ukraine.[11–12]

Materials and methods

This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Committees on
Research Involving Human Subjects of Stony Brook University as well as the Kiev Interna-
tional Institute of Sociology and the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association internal review boards,
with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects provided written informed con-
sent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Com-
mittees on Research Involving Human Subjects of Stony Brook University as well as the Kiev
International Institute of Sociology and the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association internal review
boards.

Sample

Our sample consisted of 1720 randomly selected participants from Ukraine (see Table 1) using
a cluster sampling strategy. We used sample weights to adjust for non-response (response rate
was 78.3%) as we have done before and is described elsewhere [11]. In short census data was
used to ensure the sample was representative of the population on key demographic variables.
See [11] for additional details. Trained, professional field staff from the Kiev International
Institute of Sociology in collaboration with the Ukranian Psychiatric Association administered
face-to-face interviews to participants using the Composite International Diagnostic Instru-
ment 2.0 (CIDI 2.0) as part of the World Mental Health initiative of the World Health Organi-
zation. The CIDI 2.0 used composed of twenty-two scales assessing everyday functioning,
physical and mental health symptoms, demographic variables (e.g., education, marital status,
gender), and social networks, and it is designed to assess DSM-IV disorders.[11] Additionally,
prior to conducting the study, to evaluate cultural and conceptual appropriateness of this
study and procedure for informed consent, discussion groups with recent immigrants from
Ukraine were convened at Stony Brook and a pilot study was conducted in the Kiev metropoli-
tan area. Details of the study design are provided in Bromet et al.[11]

Assessment of pain

This study used two assessments of pain (current chronic pain and chronic pain severity)
obtained from the Chronic Conditions module in the CIDI 2.0.[13] In particular, a participant
was considered experiencing current chronic pain if they responded yes to having at least one

of the following: arthritis or rheumatism, chronic back or neck problems, frequent or severe
headache, or any other chronic pain within the last 12 months.

All participants indicating chronic pain were then asked questions about the severity of
their pain symptoms. If a participant indicated more than one chronic pain condition, the

participant was asked to refer to a randomly chosen condition for the questions used to assess
their pain symptoms. Chronic pain severity was assessed using a 0 to 10 scale where 0 means
no interference and 10 means very severe interference from the condition during the last
12-months in terms of how much the condition or its consequences interfered with each of the
following: (1) home management; (2) ability to work; (3) ability to form and maintain close
relationships with other people; and (4) social life. The scale provided in the CIDI 2.0 stratified
chronic pain into mild (1–3), moderate (4–6), and severe (7–10).

Once participants’ pain experiences were labeled as mild, moderate, or severe, we then sep-
arated participants with moderate or severe pain (i.e., those with at least moderate pain sever-
ity). In particular, we were interested in assessing risk factors that differentiate participants
with severe pain from those with at least moderate pain. In our analyses, we used the subset of
participants with moderate or severe pain and created a binary variable that was defined by
whether participants had severe pain or not.

Risk factors

We explored the following demographic risk factors commonly reported for chronic pain: sex,
age (18–34, 35–49, 50–64, and +65), education level completed (primary, secondary, special-
ized secondary, and higher), current marital status (never married, married, and previously
married), and financial status (adequate, inadequate, and very inadequate). Financial status, in
particular, was derived from a response to a short question about whether or not a family typi-
cally (a) did not have enough money for food or clothes (very inadequate), (b) typically have
enough money for food, but not clothes (inadequate), or (c) typically had enough money for
food and clothes (adequate). In addition to these demographic risk factors, we considered a
variety of other mental and physical health factors. Someone was considered to have another
comorbid, chronic physical condition (of at least 12 months) if they experienced at least one of
the following conditions in the previous 12 months: allergies, stroke, heart attack, heart dis-
ease, high blood pressure, asthma, tuberculosis, chronic lung disease, malaria, diabetes, ulcer,
thyroid, neurological problem, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, chronic cold, anemia, kidney disease,
liver disease, memory problems, immune system problems, and/or cancer. A 12-month mental
health diagnosis included having one of the following: anxiety disorder (social phobia, agora-
phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder), affec-
tive disorder (depression or dysthymia), alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse or dependence),
and intermittent explosive disorder.

We explored health stigma in a manner similar to Alonso et al.[14], which probes how
much embarrassment, discrimination, or unfair treatment a participant experienced because
of his or her health problems. To assess health stigma, we scored participant responses to two
questions in the scale World Health Organization Disablement Assessment Schedule II that
was part of CIDI 2.0. These two questions probed the extent to which a participant felt embar-
rassed about their health problems and how much discrimination or unfair treatment they
experienced due to it. Greater scores on this measure indicated that a participant internalized
greater stigma towards medical treatment. These scores were then divided into three levels
based on the distribution of the sample scores: a score from 1–1.99 indicated low stigma; a
moderate score from 2–2.99 indicated moderate stigma; and a score of over 3 indicated high
stigma.

We also examined participant’s perceived treatment efficacy (PTE) and divided scores in
this measure into four levels. Perceived treatment efficacy indicates the level at which a partici-
pant believes current treatment for a medical condition was effective, with greater scores indi-
cating greater belief in the efficacy of the treatment. We scored PTE using the Perceived

Epidemiology of chronic pain in Ukraine

Treatment Efficacy scale from CIDI 2.0, which consists of two questions probing the extent to
which a participant felt seeking a professional was helpful. This scale ranges from 0 to 100 (0
meaning the participant did not perceive treatment to be efficacious). After examining the dis-
tribution of PTE scores, the following four levels were created to classify PTE scores: a score of
0 (indicating no PTE); a score from 1–20 (indicating low PTE); a score from 25–49 (indicating
moderate PTE); and a score from 50–100 (indicating high PTE). Non-specific psychological
distress was measured as a three-level variable (low, medium and high) using the Non-Specific
Distress Scale created by Kessler et al.[15]

Finally, we assessed the number of body sites where participants reported experiencing
chronic pain by summing the number of locations they indicated experiencing pain. The fol-
lowing locations were considered: neck or back, stomach or abdomen, joints (e.g., arms,
hands, legs, or feet), face or jaw or joint below the ear, chest, headaches, and other types of
chronic pain.

Data analysis

We accounted for our clustered sample design and adjusted weighting for non-response rate
with the survey package in the statistical analysis software R.[16] For full analytic details of
weights and clustering, see Bromet et al.[11] First, we used logistic regression models to calcu-
late odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to identify risk factors of chronic pain in both
unadjusted and adjusted models. The binary outcome measure in these models were either yes
(a chronic pain diagnosis is present) or no (a chronic pain diagnosis is not present). Adjusted
models included all variables with significant unadjusted associations. Next, we assessed fac-
tors associated with severe chronic pain within individuals reporting any moderate to severe
chronic pain. For this analysis, we used the binary outcome measure yes (severe chronic pain
is present) or no (severe chronic pain is not present). We took a similar approach using both
unadjusted and adjusted models, but we additionally used a third adjusted model that included
the number of locations of chronic pain. All analyses used a significance level of 0.05 and two-
sided tests.

Results
Sample characteristics

The sample’s (n = 1720) most common demographics were married females with secondary
education who had inadequate or very inadequate socioeconomic status. Ages of the partici-
pants were generally equally distributed with ages 18–34 having the highest representation of
30.3%. Many individuals with chronic pain reported having other physical conditions (e.g.,
asthma) (63.4%), no perceived treatment efficacy (41.6%), and low psychological distress
(71.3%; Table 1).

Chronic pain prevalence

The overall prevalence of chronic pain in the Ukrainian sample was 60.4% (1039/1720;
Table 2). Within those diagnosed with chronic pain, pain from the neck or back was the most
prevalent (40.3%), with most people reporting pain in more than one location (Table 2).

Risk factors for chronic pain

Of the risk factors included, we found that most demographic risk factors were associated with
chronic pain. These included being female; being over 50 years of age (50–64, and 65+); not
having finished high school (primary level education only); being currently married or

previously married; and having inadequate or very inadequate socioeconomic status. Further-
more, having at least one other comorbid chronic physical condition, high stigma towards
health, moderate or severe psychological distress and most psychiatric disorders were also
associated with a significantly increased risk of chronic pain. One exception was alcohol use
disorders, which were associated with a lower risk of chronic pain. In the adjusted model, how-
ever, only the demographic variables being female, being over 50 years of age (50–64, and 65+)
and being previously married remained significant, while all other physical and mental health
variables remained significant, except for alcohol abuse (see Table 3 for full results).

Risk factors for moderate to severe chronic pain

In assessing risk factors for severe pain, we found, in our unadjusted model, that only the fol-
lowing psychological risk factors were significantly associated with risk for severe pain of those
with at least moderate pain: having other physical conditions, none or moderate perceived
treatment efficacy, high health stigma, having a mood diagnosis, and having high psychologi-
cal distress. After adjusting for other risk factors (see methods), however, only having other
physical conditions, none or moderate perceived treatment efficacy, and having a mood diag-
nosis remained significant (see Table 4).

We investigated the robustness of a third multivariable model that included a count of pain

types for each individual. The number of pain types was significantly associated with both
moderate (69.3% 1 pain type vs. 87.1% 4+ pain types; OR = 1.35 for each additional pain type,
95% CI: 1.12, 1.63; p = 0.003) and severe (6.3% 1 pain type vs. 15.7% 4+ pain types; OR = 1.34
for each additional pain type, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.58; p = 0.001). We also found that this model that
included pain type count also significantly predicted moderate and severe pain better than our
second model that did not adjust for pain type count (p < 0.05).

Discussion

This study explored the prevalence of risk factors for the diagnosis of chronic pain and its
severity in the Ukrainian population using nationwide survey data. Using this approach, we
found a high rate of chronic pain in Ukraine (60.4%), with the majority of the chronic pain
population reporting pain in more than one location. Furthermore, we both replicated previ-
ous epidemiological studies highlighting similar demographic risk factors for chronic pain
(e.g., age, sex, education, marriage, and having another physical condition) and uniquely
found both psychological risk factors and medical treatment perception risk factors for chronic
pain. Finally, we present a method for assessing risk factors for severe chronic pain. Specifi-
cally, we found that while demographic risk factors were generally associated with chronic
pain diagnosis, other risk factors such as treatment perception and psychological risk factors
were associated with chronic pain severity.

In terms of demographic variables, we found that, in our adjusted models, being female,
older, and previously married were significant in predicting a diagnosis of chronic pain. These
findings are consistent with the literature and numerous studies have focused on biological
and psychosocial factors of hyperviligancy, sensitivity during menstruation, and increased
odds of comorbid anxiety or depression generally accounting for women’s higher risks of
chronic pain. [17] However, while most of these demographic risk factors were significant in
predicting the diagnosis of chronic pain, these variables were not significantly associated with
severe chronic pain in participants reporting moderate to severe pain, suggesting that demo-
graphic risk factors may not be as sensitive to predicting more severe forms of chronic pain in
diagnosed patients. Nevertheless, our study was able to replicate the importance of demo-
graphic variables as risk factors to chronic pain [2–4], which is especially useful in formulating
public health-related policies related to chronic pain and designing targeted interventions for
women as studies like Bartley and Fillingim [18] suggest that numerous factors such as hor-
mones and different coping strategies affect a woman’s odds of having chronic pain.

Interestingly, we found that having a comorbid chronic physical condition increased odds
of both diagnosis and severity. Specifically, one interpretation of our comorbidity results can
be related to allostatic load (i.e., the “wear and tear” of the body associated with stress) which
has been mentioned as an increasingly important factor in the biopsychosocial model of pain.
[19] Here, our results provide evidence of an accumulating allostatic load on the body associ-
ated with comorbid physical conditions that increases the risk of illness due to increased bodily
stress response.[19–20] In line with such a model of increasing risk of illness due to accumulat-
ing allostatic load, we also provide evidence suggesting that such an increased risk of illness
from a comorbid condition is not limited to physical conditions. Specifically, we find evidence
for psychological risk factors associated with chronic pain diagnosis and severity.

In line with literature discussing the comorbidity of psychiatric diagnoses and chronic pain

and theories linking psychological factors to chronic pain, psychological risk factors signifi-
cantly predicted chronic pain diagnosis and different levels of chronic pain severity.[3,19,22]
In particular, we found that all classes of psychiatric diagnoses (except for alcohol abuse) and
moderate to high levels of psychological distress significantly increased the risk of chronic
pain. While only mood disorder diagnosis, just having any psychiatric diagnosis, and moderate
psychological distress extended to predicting increased odds of at least moderate pain severity,
only mood disorder diagnosis predicted increased odds of severe pain in those with at least
moderate pain severity. Adding to the literature on risk factors for chronic pain, our severity
analyses warrant the need to further investigate psychiatric disorders and psychological risk
factors that may predict different grades of chronic pain severity by emphasizing increased
odds of severe pain with mood disorders. These findings support the association of chronic
pain with psychological factors and further substantiate the allostatic load component of the
biopsychosocial model of pain.[3,19–21,22–23] It is also worth noting the finding that alcohol
abuse was not significant in predicting chronic pain at all, raising the question as to what may
make alcohol abuse special compared to other disorders in predicting chronic pain. Though it
is hard to infer a causal mechanism relating psychiatric diagnoses to chronic pain, further
research can help elucidate the specificity of psychological disorders in relationship to predic-
tions about pain.

Finally, to test theoretical models of treatment perception on chronic pain from the psy-
chology literature, our survey-data approach found that, contrary to our hypothesis, percep-
tions of low or moderate efficacy from medical treatment decreased the odds of having at least
moderate pain. However, of those with at least moderate pain, we found increased odds of
experiencing severe pain in those who perceived low or moderate efficacy from medical treat-
ment. We interpret our results to suggest that a less optimistic perspective of treatment efficacy
may be, initially, an adaptive coping strategy in dealing with surprises surrounding treatment
outcomes. In cases when treatment may not always be effective, those with lower expectations
about treatment outcomes may maintain the effort to continue with treatment due to this
attenuation of surprise surrounding treatment outcome.[24] On the other hand, in cases when

pain is already at least moderately severe, what separates those who experience moderate pain
compared to severe pain may be related to how optimistic someone may be about the out-
comes of treatment as numerous studies have suggested that higher expectations of treatment
can lead to better prognosis of pain.[25–27]

In analyzing the effects of stigma about medical treatment on chronic pain, we were only
able to find evidence for increased odds of a chronic pain diagnosis associated with high health
stigma; we did not find an effect of health stigma on chronic pain severity. These preliminary
results may suggest that patients with some form of pain may not initially seek treatment, lead-
ing to increased onset of pain that results in the form of chronic pain. As found in Boersma
and Linton’s (2006) study, an individual’s negative expectations of treatment is strongly inter-
related to one’s experience of pain. [28] Longitudinal studies exploring the role stigma may
play in medical treatment can provide further insight into how stigma may increase the odds
of being diagnosed with chronic pain.

While we were able to provide a first step in exploring somatic symptoms in chronic pain,
there are several limitations to our approach in examining risk factors for chronic pain. Nota-
bly, the directionality of our measures remains ambiguous due to the cross-sectional nature of
our study. Future studies using longitudinal designs could better clarify the time sequence of
our measures. Additionally, response bias may inflate the memory for the severity of past
chronic pain symptoms–caution should be used in interpreting severity results, though real-
time data collection may provide a better method of pain assessment.[29] Nevertheless, our
study warrants the need to examine different factors beyond demographic risk factors when
analyzing risk factors to chronic pain. We also note that while our definition of chronic pain is
a reasonable one based on the questions available in the CIDI, additional studies that ask addi-
tional questions (e.g., to differentiate between the new ICD-11 chronic pain subtypes of pri-
mary and secondary[30]), are needed in the future.

In conclusion, we have reported a high prevalence rate of chronic pain in Ukraine, as well
as several risk factors to chronic pain diagnosis and severity. We were able to replicate demo-
graphic risk factors to chronic pain diagnosis highlighted in previous epidemiological studies
and utilize survey data to further predict chronic pain severity, the influence of psychological
risk factors to chronic pain, and the influence of medical treatment perception. As Ukraine is
still developing its medical system, it is an ideal time for future physicians and policy makers
to use these identified risk factors for chronic pain and its severity to better provide aid to
these populations. Given the prevalence and debilitating nature of chronic pain, future studies
should probe further into the demographic populations identified in this study as unique
events such as Chernobyl may add additional psychological and treatment perception-related
risk factors for chronic pain.[12] Furthermore, future studies should consider using a similar
method as described in this study to more comprehensively examine risk factors for both
chronic pain diagnosis and its severity level.
