Abstract
Background  Due to high intensity, workloads and shift work, nurses have become a high prevalence group of pain. 
If not promptly intervened, pain may become chronic pain through the mechanisms of peripheral sensitization and 
central sensitization, which in turn induces psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression, forming a vicious 
circle of “pain-mental health comorbidity”. In addition, long-term pain may accelerate the transition from acute pain 
to chronic pain, which will cause more serious damage to nurses’ health. However, few studies have deeply explored 
the association between chronic pain and multidimensional mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, fatigue, 
burnout, loneliness, and well-being) among nurse populations.

Methods  This study surveyed 147,832 nurses from 67 tertiary hospitals in China between December 2023 and 
January 2024, using cluster sampling and online questionnaires. Statistical analyses included descriptive analyses, 
correlation analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and binary logistic regression. This study followed the STROBE 
guidelines.

Results  Significant and robust associations were found between chronic pain and mental health among nurses’ 
occupational group. The correlation coefficients between chronic pain and six mental health symptoms ranged from 
0.106 to 0.179, with the three largest correlation coefficients for depression (r = 0.179, P < 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.168, 
P < 0.001) and fatigue (r = 0.159, P < 0.001). Of all pain sites, head pain had the greatest correlation with depression 
(r = 0.167, P < 0.001) and low back pain had the greatest correlation with fatigue (r = 0.144, P < 0.001). Moreover, 
subgroup analyses by sex showed that among nurses with chronic pain, males are more likely to be fatigued. For 
multisite pain, the strength of the association with mental health increased significantly as the number of pain sites 
increased.

Conclusion  In this study, both chronic pain and number of pain sites were significantly associated with nurses’ 
mental health and showed site variability. After progressively controlling for variables such as sociodemographic,

Background
Chronic pain (CP), defined as pain that persists or recurs 
for more than 3 months [1]. It is estimated that over 30% 
of  the  global  population  suffers  from  CP  [2].  Among 
occupational groups, CP often stems from Work-related 
Musculoskeletal  Disorders  (WMSDs)  [3],  a  group  of 
muscular,  neurological,  or  joint  disorders  caused  by 
repetitive  movements,  poor  posture,  or  overloading  [4]. 
Nursing professionals have a high prevalence of WMSDs 
due  to  their  intense  workloads  and  the  nature  of  shift 
work.  According  to  the  2022  Statistics  Bureau  of  the 
United  States  Department  of  Labor,  nursing  staff  have 
the  highest  incidence  of  WMSDs  among  all  professions 
[5].  A  meta-analysis  covering  15  countries  showed  that 
the  pooled  prevalence  of  WMSDs  among  nurses  was 
77.2% [6]. Additionally, a cross-sectional survey of nurs-
ing  students  showed  that  30.2%  of  them  experienced 
CP  [7].  A  survey  of  registered  nurses  in  Iran  found  that 
64.8%  of  them  suffered  from  CP,  a  prevalence  signifi-
cantly  higher  than  in  the  general  population  [8].  If  not 
promptly intervened in, pain may progress to CP through 
the  mechanisms  of  peripheral  sensitization  and  central 
sensitization,  which  in  turn  induce  psychological  symp-
toms such as anxiety and depression, forming “pain-men-
tal health comorbidity” [9–11]. Epidemiological evidence 
revealed  a  bidirectional  relationship  between  CP  and 
mental health. For example, spinal pain increases the risk 
of depression by 2.0 to 2.5 times, while depressive symp-
toms  heighten  the  likelihood  of  developing  spinal  pain 
by  4  times  [11].  Notably,  prolonged  pain  may  accelerate 
the  transition  from  acute  to  CP,  thereby  causing  greater 
harm to nurses’ physical and mental health and exerting a 
broader impact. Therefore, focusing on CP is particularly 
critical for maintaining the physical and mental health of 
nurses.

Although  the  association  between  CP  and  mental 
health  has  been  established,  its  underlying  mechanisms 
remain  insufficiently  explored.  Existing  studies  tend  to 
be homogeneous in psychological dimensions, predomi-
nantly  focusing  on  emotional  symptoms  (e.g.,  depres-
sion, anxiety) while ignoring other important symptoms 
like  burnout,  fatigue,  and  loneliness.  While  these  symp-
toms  are  present  in  all  professions,  they  are  particularly 
prominent in nursing. Moreover, the role of occupational 
factors  in  this  context  remains  insufficiently  explored. 
Specifically, work-related factors such as night shifts and 
weekly working hours need to be further studied. These 

gaps limit our comprehensive understanding of the rela-
tion  between  CP  and  mental  health.  In  summary,  CP 
poses  a  significant  threat  to  physical  and  mental  health, 
and the nursing profession is a vulnerable population for 
CP.  Despite  many  studies  on  the  relationship  between 
pain  and  mental  health,  few  have  specifically  examined 
CP  and  psychological  outcomes  in  nursing  populations 
while  controlling  for  job-related  variables  such  as  pro-
fessional title and shift work. With attention to burnout, 
fatigue,  and  loneliness  symptoms  specific  to  the  nurses’ 
profession,  this  study  explored  in  depth  the  relation 
between  CP  and  mental  health  to  provide  a  reference 
basis  for  improving  the  physical  and  mental  health  of 
nurses.

Previous  studies  have  exhibited  heterogeneity  in  mea-
surement tools (e.g., diverse scales for anxiety/depression 
assessment with inconsistent metrics), study populations 
(e.g.,  different  cultural  backgrounds  and  socioeconomic 
statuses),  and  research  methodologies  (e.g.,  cross-sec-
tional,  longitudinal  studies),  which  limits  the  generaliz-
ability  and  interpretive  depth  of  the  findings  [12,  13]. 
Notably, the majority of evidence originates from single-
center,  small-sample  observational  studies.  Therefore, 
higher-quality,  large-sample  studies  exploring  the  rela-
tionship between CP and mental health are needed. This 
study aimed to reveal the complex interactions between 
CP and multidimensional mental health outcomes (anxi-
ety,  depression,  fatigue,  burnout,  loneliness,  and  well-
being)  in  nurses,  with  data  from  the  Nurses’  Mental 
Health Study (NMHS).

Methods
Study design

A  descriptive,  quantitative,  cross-sectional  study  was 
conducted.

Participant selection and setting

This  study  utilized  baseline  data  from  the  Nurses’  Men-
tal Health Study (NMHS), a prospective cohort study. A 
cluster  sample  of  nurses  from  67  tertiary  hospitals  (i.e., 
general hospitals, including medicine, surgery, pediatrics, 
obstetrics and gynecology, etc., as distinct from specialty 
hospitals)  covering  31  provinces  was  selected.  Inclusion 
criteria for nurses were: (1) nurse not less than 18 years 
old,  (2)  nurse  registered  and  in  service,  (3)  nurse  will-
ing  to  participate  in  the  study.  Intern  nurses  or  nurses

studying in other hospitals were excluded. This study fol-
lowed the STROBE guidelines [14].

Ethical considerations

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
Second  Xiangya  Hospital  of  Central  South  University 
(LYF20230048).  Informed  consent  was  obtained  from 
all participants, and only consenting participants started 
the questionnaire. Throughout the process, they had the 
right to choose to continue or withdraw from the study at 
any time.

were recovered, the final sample size for the baseline data 
included in the NMHS was 132,910, with an overall valid 
response rate of 89.91% (Fig. 1). Prior to the analysis, two 
independent  researchers  cleaned  the  data,  which  con-
sisted  of  three  steps,  namely  excluding  duplicate  ques-
tionnaires,  removing  outliers  in  continuous  variables, 
and checking for logical conflicts. The specific steps were 
described  in  detail  in  the  previously  published  protocol 
[15].

Measures
Chronic pain

Data collection

This  study  was  conducted  between  December  2023  and 
January  2024  through  the  Questionnaire  Star   (   h t t p s : / / w 
w w . w j x . c n /     ) .  The  questionnaire  and  scales  used  in  this 
study  have  been  described  in  previously  published  pro-
tocol [15]. A total of 147,832 nurses were invited to par-
ticipate in the survey and  135,161 online  questionnaires 

CP  was  measured  by  asking,  “In  the  past  year,  did 
you  have  persistent  or  recurring  pain  for  more  than  3 
months?”  Responses  included  “yes”  and  “no”  [1].  If  the 
answer is “yes”, the participant is asked about the specific 
sites of the pain, including head, face, neck and shoulder, 
low back, stomach and intestine, hip and knee joint, gen-
eral and others [16].

Anxiety symptoms

Anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were assessed 
using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) 
Scale [17], rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (not at 
all)  to  3  (nearly  every  day).  Higher  scores  indicate  more 
severe anxiety symptoms, and the severity can be divided 
into four levels: minimal or none (0–4), mild (5–9), mod-
erate  (10–14)  and  severe  (> 15).  In  the  original  study, 
Cronbach’s  α  coefficient  was  0.92  [17].  In  this  study, 
Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0.942 and showed excellent 
internal consistency.

Depressive symptoms

Depressive  symptoms  over  the  past  two  weeks  were 
assessed  using  the  9-item  Patient  Health  Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9) [18] rated on a 4-point Likert Scale from 0 (not 
at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate more 
severe depressive symptoms. Scores of 0–4 indicated no 
depression,  5–9  mild,  10–14  moderate,  15–19  moder-
ately severe, and 20–27 severe depression. In the original 
study,  the  PHQ-9  showed  excellent  internal  consistency 
with α ranging from 0.86 to 0.89 [19]. In this study, Cron-
bach’s α coefficient was 0.901.

Fatigue

Fatigue  was  assessed  with  a  single  question:  “How 
often  did  you  feel  fatigue  in  the  last  year?”  Responses 
were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 
(always) [20].

Burnout

Burnout  was  assessed  with  a  single  self-report  ques-
tion, “In the past year, did you feel burnout?” Responses 
were  rated  on  a  5-point  scale:  1 = not  at  all,  I  enjoy  my 
job, 2 = no, I feel pressure and am not always as energetic 
as  before,  3 = a  little,  I  have  fatigue  symptoms,  such  as 
emotional exhaustion, 4 = very, I always feel frustrated at 
work, 5 = terribly, I need help [21].

Loneliness

Loneliness  was  measured  by  asking,  “Did  you  often  feel 
lonely  in  the  past  year?”  Responses  included  “yes”  and 
“no” [22].

Well-being

Well-being  was  evaluated  with  the  question,  “Over-
all, how happy would you say you are?”. Responses were 
coded as 1 = not at all happy, 2 = not very happy, 3 = neu-
trality, 4 = quite happy, and 5 = very happy [23].

Covariates

We  adjusted  the  covariates  previously  linked  to  CP  and 
mental health [24, 25], including sex, age, ethnicity, body 
mass  index  (BMI),  education  level,  and  marital  status 

(socio-demographic  factors).  Smoking  habits,  exercise 
frequency, alcohol consumption, and sleep duration were 
collected  as  lifestyle  factors.  Professional  title,  weekly 
working  hours,  and  night  shift  were  collected  as  work-
related factors.

Data analysis

Data  analysis  was  conducted  using  SPSS  27.0  software. 
BMI  and  weekly  working  hours  were  converted  as  cat-
egorical variables. Continuity variables were described by 
mean  and  standard  deviation,  and  categorical  variables 
were described by frequency and percentage. Spearman’s 
correlation  was  used  to  analyze  the  strength  and  direc-
tion  of  the  association  between  CP  and  mental  health. 
The  independent  variable  was  CP,  and  mental  health 
(anxiety,  depression,  fatigue,  burnout,  loneliness,  and 
well-being)  was  the  dependent  variable,  and  covariates 
included sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and 
work-related factors. Since the p-value of the parallelism 
test in the results of the ordinal logistic regression analy-
sis  was  less  than  0.05,  which  indicated  that  the  model 
was not suitable, it was then switched to the multivariate 
logistic regression analysis [26]. Multiple logistic regres-
sion  models  and  binary  logistic  regression  models  were 
used to examine the association between CP and mental 
health variables. Results were shown as odds ratios (ORs) 
and  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs).  No  CP  and  the  first 
in each group were used as reference categories for each 
test. Model 1 adjusted for demographics factors (sex, age, 
BMI, ethnicity, education level and marital status). Model 
2  further  adjusted  for  lifestyle  factors  (smoking,  exer-
cise,  alcohol  consumption,  and  sleep  duration).  Model 
3  further  controlled  for  work-related  variables  such  as 
professional title, weekly working hours, and night shift. 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  by  sex  and  age.  In 
addition,  logistic  regression  analysis  was  performed 
between the number of pain sites (0, 1–2, ≥ 3) and mental 
health.  Significance  level  was  set  at  P < 0.05  for  all  tests 
(two-sided).

For the missing data, three variables have less than 2% 
missing values (age, BMI and weekly working hours), and 
these  missing  values  are  all  outliers.  In  order  to  ensure 
the completeness and veracity of the data, we chose the 
Expectation  Maximization  Algorithm,  which  is  well 
suited for interpolation of large-scale data, to interpolate 
the missing data [27].

Spearman’s analysis of the link between CP and mental 
health

Spearman’s  correlation  analysis  showed  that  CP  and  the 
number of pain sites were positively correlated with anxi-
ety,  depression,  fatigue,  burnout,  and  loneliness,  while 
negatively correlated with well-being in the nurse popula-
tion (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.106 to 0.179, 
p < 0.001). The strength of the correlations was most sig-
nificant  with  anxiety,  depression  and  fatigue  (Table  2). 
For  further  analysis,  different  pain  sites  were  correlated 
with mental health symptoms, and it was found that gen-
eral pain had the highest correlation with mental health, 
followed by head and low back pain (Table 3). Specifically, 
head  pain  showed  the  highest  correlation  coefficients 
with  depressive  symptoms  (r = 0.167,  p < 0.001)  and  low 
back  pain  with  fatigue  symptoms  (r = 0.144,  p < 0.001), 
which suggested that there were differences among asso-
ciations of different pain sites and mental health, and that 
head  and  low  back  pain  were  more  significant  in  these 
associations. Although these relationships are statistically 
robust,  the  correlation  coefficients  are  relatively  small. 
The statistical results need to be interpreted with caution, 

as statistical significance is not equivalent to clinical sig-
nificance. It is worth noting that the inverse associations 
presented  by  the  “other”  sites  could  be  a  result  of  the 
design  of  the  options  leading  to  participants’  misunder-
standing of the “other” category, or it could be a system-
atic bias due to the ambiguity of the options [28].

Association of CP and mental health

Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed a significant 
correlation  between  CP  and  mental  health.  Specifically, 
CP  was  significantly  associated  with  increased  anxiety, 
depression,  fatigue,  burnout,  and  loneliness,  as  well  as 
with  decreased  well-being.  This  correlation  remained 
consistent after controlling for covariates (Table 4).

Association of CP and anxiety symptoms

In Model 1, CP significantly increased the risk of anxiety 
among nurses in a stepwise pattern with statistically sig-
nificant results after adjusting for sociodemographic and 
lifestyle factors (Table 4). Compared to those without CP, 
individuals with CP had ORs of 2.45 (95% CI = 2.35–2.56), 
5.12 (95% CI = 4.76–5.51), and 8.35 (95% CI = 7.58–9.20) 
for  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  anxiety,  respectively  (all 
p < 0.001). With further adjustment for lifestyle and work-
related factors (Model 2 and Model 3), the strength of the

association  remained  statistically  significant,  although  it 
was slightly weakened. Additionally, the significant asso-
ciation  between  CP  and  anxiety  symptoms  remained  in 
subgroup analyses by sex and age group (P < 0.001) (sTa-
ble 1 and sTable 2 in Supplementary materials).

Association of CP and depressive symptoms

Models 1, 2 and 3 found a significant association between 
CP  and  depressive  symptoms  (p < 0.001)  (Table  4).  In 
Model  3,  compared  to  individuals  without  CP,  those 
with CP had ORs for mild, moderate, moderately severe, 
and  severe  depression  of  2.20  (95%  CI = 2.09–2.31), 
4.18  (95%  CI = 3.91–4.47),  6.01  (95%  CI = 5.51–6.55), 
and  8.71  (95%  CI = 7.76–9.79).  Furthermore,  in  the  sub-
group  analyses  by  sex  and  age  group,  there  remained  a 

significant association between CP and depressive symp-
toms (P < 0.001) (sTable 1 and sTable 2 in Supplementary 
materials).

Association of CP and fatigue

In Models 1, 2 and 3, CP significantly increased the risk 
of  fatigue  in  nurses  and  showed  a  tendency  for  the  risk 
to  increase  in  a  stepwise  pattern  as  the  level  of  fatigue 
increased  (P < 0.001)  (Table  4).  In  Model  3,  the  ORs  for 
seldom,  sometimes,  often,  and  always  fatigue  were  1.43 
(95%  CI = 1.08–1.88),  2.59  (95%  CI = 2.01–3.34),  4.90 
(95%  CI = 3.79–6.32),  and  8.04  (95%  CI = 6.23–10.39)  for 
those  with  CP  compared  to  those  without  CP,  respec-
tively.  Moreover,  there  were  still  significant  associations 
between CP and fatigue in subgroup analyses by sex and 
age group (P < 0.05). And we found that in male, the ORs 

Ren et al. BMC Nursing          (2025) 24:865 Page 8 of 11

for  different  levels  of  fatigue  were  significantly  higher 
than those in female group (sTable 1 and sTable 2 in Sup-
plementary materials).

Association of CP and burnout

In Models 1, 2 and 3, a significant association was found 
between CP and burnout (P < 0.001) (Table 4). In Model 
3, compared to those without CP, the ORs for mild stress, 
early burnout, persistent burnout, and severe burnout in 
those with CP were 1.97 (95% CI = 1.78–2.18), 3.04 (95% 
CI = 2.75–3.36), 4.88 (95% CI = 4.36–5.47), and 7.34 (95% 
CI = 6.44–8.36).  In  addition,  the  significant  association 
between CP and burnout remained in subgroup analyses 
across  sex  and  age  groups  (p < 0.001)  (sTable  1  and  sTa-
ble 2 in Supplementary materials).

Association of CP and loneliness

We found a significant association between CP and lone-
liness  in  both  models  (p < 0.001)  (Table  4).  In  the  three 
Models, the ORs for loneliness were 2.37 (95% CI = 2.28–
2.47), 2.09 (95% CI = 2.01–2.19) and 2.07 (95% CI = 1.98–
2.16)  for  people  with  CP  compared  to  those  without 
CP,  respectively.  Also,  in  subgroup  analyses  by  sex  and 
age  group,  the  association  between  CP  and  loneliness 
remained significant (p < 0.001) (sTable 1 and sTable 2 in 
Supplementary materials).

Association of CP and well-being

We  identified  a  significant  association  between  CP  and 
well-being in both models (p < 0.001) (Table 4). In model 
3, compared to those without CP, the ORs for those with 
CP who were happy, fair, not happy, and very not happy 
were 1.67 (95% CI = 1.58–1.77), 2.66 (95% CI = 2.50–2.84), 
3.82 (95% CI = 3.32–4.41), and 5.85 (95% CI = 4.51–7.59). 
In subgroup analyses across sex and age groups, the sig-
nificant association between CP and well-being remained 
(p < 0.001)  (sTable  1  and  sTable  2  in  Supplementary 
materials).

Association of the number of pain sites and mental health

For  further  analysis,  we  categorized  the  number  of  pain 
sites (0, 1–2, ≥ 3), with 0 number of pain sites as the ref-
erence group, and then analyzed them in multiple logistic 
regressions with six mental health indicators. The results 
showed a significant association between the number of 
pain  sites  and  mental  health  in  both  models  (p < 0.001), 
except  in  the  group  with  ≥ 3  CP  sites,  where  the  results 
of seldom vs. never, sometimes vs. never for fatigue were 
not statistically significant. In addition, the OR increased 
with  increasing  mental  health  severity  as  well  as  the 
number  of  pain  sites,  which  was  especially  pronounced 
for anxiety and depressive symptoms (sTable3 in Supple-
mentary materials).

Discussion
This  multicenter,  large-sample,  cross-sectional  study 
examined the relationship between CP and mental health 
symptoms  among  nurses  in  tertiary  hospitals  in  China. 
It  identified  that  CP  was  significantly  associated  with 
increased anxiety, depression, fatigue, burnout, and lone-
liness,  as  well  as  with  decreased  well-being.  This  asso-
ciation  was  broadly  consistent  by  sex  and  age  group. 
Additionally, there was a significant association between 
the amount of CP and these six psychological indicators.

CP and mental health

This  study  revealed  significant  associations  between 
CP  and  mental  health  in  nurses,  with  a  specific  focus 
on  burnout,  fatigue,  and  loneliness  unique  to  the  nurs-
ing  profession.  The  results  showed  that  CP  significantly 
increased  the  likelihood  of  anxiety,  depression,  fatigue, 
burnout,  and  loneliness  among  nurses.  Some  research-
ers  biologically  explained  the  association  between  CP 
and  anxiety  and  depression,  suggesting  they  may  share 
neurobehavioral  slowing  mechanisms  [12,  29].  Another 
study suggested that CP and fatigue are common comor-
bid  symptoms  in  clinical  settings  and  that  central  sensi-
tization  may  be  a  potential  mechanism  underlying  their 
comorbidity  [30].  Within  occupational  population  stud-
ies, Balajti et al. demonstrated the significant association 
between burnout and low back pain [31]. Epidemiologi-
cal evidence has shown that individuals with CP are more 
likely  to  feel  lonely  compared  to  those  without  CP  [32]. 
This may be attributed to CP limiting an individual’s abil-
ity to engage in social, leisure, and work activities, which 
in  turn  disrupts  social  relationships  and  fosters  loneli-
ness  [33].  Previous  studies  have  also  shown  that  CP  is 
significantly  associated  with  well-being,  with  individu-
als suffering from CP having a lower sense of well-being 
compared  to  those  without  CP  [34–36].  Furthermore, 
our  findings  showed  that  the  association  between  CP 
and  mental  health  remained  significant  after  adjust-
ing  for  work-related  factors  (e.g.,  night  shifts,  weekly 
work  hours).  This  indicated  that  work-related  factors, 
although  having  a  significant  impact  on  nurses’  physical 
and  mental  health,  may  not  be  the  primary  moderator 
of the association between CP and mental health. Future 
research  should  further  explore  the  interactive  mecha-
nisms between work-related factors and CP, and develop 
targeted  interventions  to  improve  nurses’  physical  and 
mental health.

Different pain sites and mental health

The  present  study  revealed  significant  associations 
between  CP  and  mental  health  in  nurses  and  showed 
sites  specificity.  In  the  correlation  analysis  between  dif-
ferent  pain  sites  and  mental  health,  head  and  low  back 
pain  exhibited  stronger  associations  compared  to  other 

Ren et al. BMC Nursing          (2025) 24:865 Page 9 of 11

sites.  The  correlation  coefficient  between  head  pain 
and  depression  was  the  highest  among  all  pain  sites, 
potentially  attributable  to  head  pain  on  the  individual’s 
emotion  regulation  center  [37].  Previous  studies  have 
reported  similar  findings,  showing  that  head  pain  was 
often  regarded  as  one  of  the  important  somatic  factors 
triggering  depressive  moods,  with  both  the  incidence 
and severity of headache episodes increased significantly 
during depression [38–40]. On the other hand, low back 
pain had the highest correlation coefficient with fatigue, 
possibly  because  it  limits  physical  mobility  and  produc-
tivity,  thereby  reducing  physical  functioning  and  induc-
ing fatigue [41]. Previous studies have shown that fatigue 
is a common symptom in patients with chronic low back 
pain [42, 43]. Due to the unique nature of nursing work, 
which requires dynamic loads like frequent bending, lift-
ing  of  patients,  and  maintaining  poor  posture  for  long 
periods  of  time,  dramatically  increase  their  risk  of  low 
back pain [44]. These dynamic loads elevate spinal stress, 
leading  to  muscle  fatigue  and  pain.  Evidence  has  shown 
that  fatigue  and  chronic  low  back  pain  co-occur  under 
stress  [42].  The  results  of  this  study  further  emphasize 
the  need  for  interventions  targeting  specific  pain  sites 
and mental health associations among nurses.

Subgroup analysis of CP and mental health

In  this  study,  after  adjusting  for  covariates  (sociodemo-
graphic,  lifestyle,  and  work-related  factors),  the  associa-
tion between CP and mental health remained significant, 
indicating  the  robustness  of  the  relationship.  Subgroup 
analyses  by  sex  shown  that  among  nurses  with  chronic 
pain,  males  are  more  likely  to  experience  fatigue.  Previ-
ous  studies  have  identified  that  the  occurrence  of  CP  in 
women  is  closely  related  to  hormonal  differences,  bio-
logical  characteristics  and  psychosocial  factors,  which 
collectively make them more susceptible to CP than men 
due  to  their  higher  pain  sensitivity  [24,  25,  45].  Females 
were  more  likely  to  experience  symptoms  of  fatigue 
[46,  47].  However,  direct  research  evidence  on  sex  dif-
ferences  in  the  association  between  CP  and  fatigue  and 
which group is more likely to exhibit symptoms of fatigue 
remains lacking. Our findings suggest the possibility that 
male  vulnerability  may  be  underestimated  in  nurses. 
Given  the  limitations  of  existing  research  and  the  find-
ings of this study, more studies targeting the physical and 
mental  health  of  the  male  nurse  population  are  neces-
sary in the future. To gain a more comprehensive under-
standing  of  the  impact  of  CP  on  this  population  and  to 
inform the development of better-targeted interventions. 
Furthermore,  this  study  found  a  significant  association 
between  the  number  of  pain  sites  and  mental  health  in 
both models. As the number of pain sites increased, the 
ORs  for  mental  health  symptoms  showed  a  significant 
upward trend, especially more prominent in anxiety and 

depression  symptoms.  This  finding  is  consistent  with 
previous  research.  Previous  studies  have  demonstrated 
that  individuals  with  multiple  sites  of  CP  tend  to  be  at 
higher  risk  for  psychological  disorders,  with  their  men-
tal  health  progressively  deteriorates  as  the  number  of 
pain sites increases [48, 49]. This may be attributed to the 
increased physiologic burden of multiple CP sites, which 
in turn exerts a more profound negative impact on psy-
chological well-being.

Strengths and limitations

This  study  has  several  strengths  and  limitations.  For 
the  strengths,  first,  it  covered  67  tertiary-level  A  hospi-
tals in 31 provinces in China, providing a large and rep-
resentative  sample.  Second,  this  study  was  conducted 
on  healthcare  professionals,  and  most  previous  studies 
have focused on populations, with less attention paid to 
occupational  populations.  We  analyzed  the  association 
between CP and multiple mental health symptoms (anxi-
ety,  depression,  fatigue,  burnout,  loneliness,  and  well-
being)  among  nurses,  providing  new  evidence  on  the 
impact  of  CP  on  mental  health  in  occupational  popula-
tions. Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted to 
further elucidate sex and age differences.

For  limitations,  first,  due  to  the  study  design  being  a 
cross-sectional study, it was not possible to determine a 
causal  relationship  between  CP  and  mental  health.  Sec-
ond, some of the measured variables in this study relied 
on  a  single  instrument,  such  as  burnout,  fatigue,  and 
loneliness. And the reliance on subjective reports of sleep 
duration  may  not  adequately  reflect  the  quality  of  sleep 
and circadian rhythm disruption among nurses. In addi-
tion,  for  generalizability,  the  participants  in  this  study 
represented  only  the  group  of  nurses  in  China’s  tertiary 
hospitals  and  did  not  involve  primary  hospitals.  Finally, 
selection bias may exist as nurses who refused to partici-
pate in the baseline survey or were dropped out may have 
different  characteristics  than  those  who  voluntarily  par-
ticipated and were ultimately included.

Conclusion
This  study  explored  the  associations  among  CP  and  the 
number of pain sites and nurses’ mental health (anxiety, 
depression, fatigue, burnout, loneliness, and well-being), 
revealing  a  significant  and  robust  associations.  After 
adjusting  for  variables  such  as  sociodemographic,  life-
style and work-related factors, this association remained 
robust  and  showed  consistency  across  sex  and  age 
groups.  Notably,  CP  significantly  increased  nurses’  risk 
of  fatigue,  burnout,  and  loneliness,  which  are  common 
psychological  problems  among  nurses.  In  addition,  the 
study found discrepancies between different sites of pain 
and  mental  health,  with  head  and  low  back  pain  having 
stronger associations compared to other sites. Subgroup

analyses further suggested that male nurses with CP may 
be  more  likely  to  be  fatigued.  However,  the  cross-sec-
tional study design limited the inference of causality, and 
longitudinal  designs  or  intervention  studies  are  needed 
in  the  future  to  explore  in  depth  the  complex  relations 
between CP and the number of pain sites and the devel-
opment  of  psychological  symptoms  (e.g.,  depression, 
anxiety). Meanwhile, interventions for nurses should take 
into  account  site-specificity  and  sex  differences  in  CP 
to  more  effectively  improve  nurses’  physical  and  mental 
health.
