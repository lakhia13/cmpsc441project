Abstract

Background: Emotional dysregulation seems to be a core feature of Borderline Personality Disorders (BPD). In
addition, recent research in the adolescent population has shown that suicidal behaviours have been associated
with maladaptive strategies of emotion regulation.
Methods: This study examined the relative contributions of emotional dysregulation to suicide attempt history in a
clinical sample of borderline adolescents. Data were analyzed from 85 participants of the Collaborative European
Research Network on Borderline Personality Disorder. Participants completed measures of BPD traits and symptoms,
suicide behaviours, emotional dysregulation, attachment styles and lifetime depressive disorders.

Results: In an SEM model, lifetime depressive disorders and insecure attachment styles have a significant direct
effect on lifetime suicide attempt, but only lifetime depressive disorders have an indirect effect through emotion
dysregulation. The results suggest that emotional dysregulation has a mediating role in suicide attempts among
BPD adolescents.
Conclusions: These findings call for the development of interventions targeting the role of emotion dysregulation
in effectively predicting and preventing suicidality in borderline adolescents.

Background
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in adolescents
is now recognized as a legitimate disease [1] deserving
early intervention and treatment [2, 3]. BPD has been
found in 1.6 to 3% of the general population [1, 4].
In mental health institutions, BPD among adolescents
is common, with an estimated prevalence of 10% in
ambulatory patients [5], nearly 50% in hospital care

emotion dysregulation are not entirely understood,
Linehan’s theory [17] suggests that subjects who have
attempted suicide experience high levels of emotional
distress following difficult events that they consider to
be aversive and intolerable and cannot generate and
implement adaptive solutions.

Emotion dysregulation is the inability to respond flex-
ibly to, and control, emotions [18]. There is considerable
variation in the phenomena studied under the heading
of ‘emotional dysregulation’ in BPD, including emotion
sensitivity, heightened and labile negative affect, a deficit
of appropriate regulation strategies, and a surplus of
maladaptive regulation strategies
[19]. One way to
understand these disparate approaches is to view emo-
tional dysregulation not as an end state, but as a process
incorporating multiple interactive components [20]. In
the clinical population of adults with BPD, numerous
studies have clearly identified difficulties with emotion
regulation as being associated with SB [21–24]. More-
over, even in non-clinical populations, emotional regula-
tion difficulties have been shown to be correlated with
suicidality [25, 26]. BPD features have prospectively pre-
dicted SB even when the non-suicidal self-injury criter-
ion of BPD was excluded, indicating that the association
with BPD features is not simply due to criterion overlap
[23]. However, Yen et al. [23] showed that only the
affective instability feature prospectively predicted sui-
cide attempts (SAs) even when controlling for negative
mood states such as major depression. In addition, emo-
tional dysregulation seems to be involved in several risk
factors associated with SB such as self-injury [27, 28],
impulsivity [29], substance abuse [6], depressive disor-
ders [30] or interpersonal difficulties [31]. However,
studies in adolescent populations remain rare despite
the high prevalence of BPD in suicidal adolescents [8].
In a previous study with adolescents, suicide attempters
reported greater affect dysregulation than suicide idea-
tors [32]. Moreover, according to Glenn et al. [33], the
affective instability facet of adolescent BPD was related
to SA even when controlling for general negative emo-
tionality. However, in a sample of high-risk suicidal ado-
lescents, Yen et al. [11] found no difference in emotional
regulation between BPDs and non-BPDs. On the other
hand, the authors found that those with more BPD cri-
teria had higher levels of negative affectivity, depression,
anxiety and higher affective lability. In summary, the
conflicting results reported in studies examining emo-
tional dysregulation and SB suggest the notion that the
nature of the relationship depends on the presence or
absence of other variables such as mood depressive dis-
orders (MDD) or
interpersonal difficulties. Thereby
about 65% of youths and adults with BPD have MDD in
their lifetime [34]. Links between MDD and BPD are
sometimes strong and the clinical distinction between

them is not clear, especially in adolescents [7, 34, 35].
Adult studies have shown that while there is significant
overlap or co-morbidity between BPD and DD [12, 24],
these are probably distinct clinical phenotypes.

SBs are often related to emotions connected with
interpersonal relationships [31, 36, 37]. For example,
almost 40% of adolescents indicated that
friendship
difficulties were the main precipitant to their suicide
attempts [36]. Furthermore, the quality of interpersonal
relationships is a key factor in the psychopathology of
borderline adolescents, potentially linked to insecure or
disorganized attachment patterns [38, 39]. The quality of
attachment is defined in particular by the balance the
subject achieves between knowing when to seek help
from particular figures (figures of attachment) in cases
of distress and relying on their own resources to over-
come a challenge or crisis [40]. The feeling of helpless-
interpersonal
ness
difficulties are important predictors of SB [41].
In
addition, it has been suggested that interpersonal and
experiential disturbances that are features of BPD are as-
sociated with the traits of affective instability among pa-
tients with personality disorders [42].

and hopelessness generated by

In summary, despite the growing evidence in adults,
much less is known about the relations between emo-
tional dysregulation and SB in BPD adolescents. Based
on previous research, the present study aims to better
understand the mechanisms underlying suicide at-
tempts in BPD adolescents. Specifically, we seek to
clarify the role of emotional dysregulation in suicide
attempt
in adolescents with BPD according to the
presence/absence of a MDD and/or relationship diffi-
culties. We hypothesize that the relationship between
suicide attempt, MDD and relational difficulties is
partially mediated by emotional dysregulation.

Methods
Participants
The study sample was taken from a European research
project on borderline disorder in adolescence (European
Research Network on Borderline Personality Disorder,
EURNET BPD; for a full description of the study’s meth-
odology, see [43]). The research network was composed
of 5 academic psychiatric centers in France, Belgium,
and Switzerland. During the period from January to
December 2007, all in- and out-patient adolescents (15
to 19 years old) were clinically screened by the consult-
ing psychiatrists
following the DSM-IV criteria for
borderline personality disorders. Adolescents fulfilling a
clinical diagnosis of BPD were referred to the research
team for further assessment as described below. People
suffering from schizophrenia or any potentially serious
medical condition were excluded. 107 patients with a
possible diagnosis of BPD were referred to the study by

Mirkovic et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:393

their clinicians. Of these subjects, 85 fulfilled SIDP-IV
criteria for a BPD.

and was the only significant predictor of future
suicide attempts;

Procedure
Axis-II disorders were ascertained through the Struc-
tured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV), a
semi-structured interview for assessing each of the ten
DSM-IV personality disorders, including BPD [44]. Axis-
I disorders were assessed using the Schedule for
Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age
Children (K-SADS) which is a semi-structured interview
for the assessment of both past and current psychiatric
disorders in children and adolescents [45]. Diagnostic
interviews were conducted by a research team of 5
doctoral or master’s level clinicians (psychologists or
psychiatrists) who were familiar with DSM-IV Axis-I/II
disorders and were experienced in the assessment and/
or treatment of psychiatric adolescents. Final research
diagnoses were established by the best-estimate method
on the basis of the interviews and any relevant additional
data from the clinical record, according to the LEAD
standard [46]. Inter-rater reliability for SIDP-IV was
calculated from independent ratings of ten videotaped
interviews. The Kappa coefficient for the presence /
absence of a BPD was very good (0.84). The intraclass
correlation coefficient for borderline SIDP-IV score was
excellent (0.95). At the end of the assessment session, an
overall level of psychosocial functioning was calculated
for each patient according to the Global Assessment of
Functioning (GAF) [47].

Measures
Assessment of emotional dysregulation
Emotion regulation is itself a complex trait and several
psychometric tools have been developed over time. For
the present study we created a composite emotional dys-
regulation score from three scales investigating emo-
tional processes:

(i) The Affective Lability Scale (ALS) [48] measures
emotional statesin 3 dimensions: perceptions of
changes in emotion and associated cognition,
perceptions of physiologic changes, and perceptions
of behavioral changes. It is a self-questionnaire
examining the variation between the euthymic state
and four affective states: depression, elation, anger
and anxiety, as well as the variation between elation
and depression, and between anxiety and
depression. An English and French version for
adolescents was developed by Guilé et al. [49].
Internal consistency is high for each section and for
the entire instrument (Cronbach α = 0,87 to
α = 0,95). In an adult BPD sample, Yen et al. [23]
showed that affective lability was associated with SB

(ii) The Bermond and Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire
(BVAQ) [50] has a 5-factor structure: B1: ability to
verbalize; B2: ability to fantasize; B3: ability to
introspect; B4: emotional reactivity; B5: ability to
analyze (Cronbach α = 0,85) [51]. Alexithymia may
also be considered as a deficit in the treatment and
regulation of emotions [52]. It has been shown that
alexithymic adolescents have more psychiatric
disorders such as depression [53] or BPD [54]. In
addition, alexithymia appears to be a risk factor for
suicidal behaviours [55]. For the composite score of
the study, we only included the Affective score of
the BVAQ (B2 + B4 factor scores).

(iii)The Cyclothymic-hypersensitive temperament

questionnaire (CHTQ) is a child and adolescent
French modification of Akiskal’s cyclothymic
temperament questionnaire (Cronbach α = 0,88)
[56, 57]. The cyclothymic temperament is
characterized by permanent instability of mood,
thinking and behaviors [58], which is frequent in
bipolar disorders [59]. Several studies have shown
that cyclothymic temperament is associated with SB
in adults [60, 61], in adolescents with mood disorders
[62], and also in community populations [63].

The composite score from these three scales allows a
broader evaluation of the notion of emotional dysregula-
tion in the sense of emotional and affective variability.
Indeed, the notion of emotional variability may refer ei-
ther to the ways of dealing with an emotional situation,
or to the notion of emotional vulnerability (the variables
relating to the experience or the quality of the emotion),
or to the ability to understand emotions.

Definition of suicide attempt
The event qualified as an attempted suicide if it met the
Silverman definition. According to Silverman et al. [64],
suicide attempt is defined as self-inflicted, potentially
damaging behaviour whose outcome is not fatal and for
which there is evidence of intent to die. The lifetime oc-
currence and number of suicide attempts were directly
assessed during a clinical interview with the adolescent
and their parents or guardians.

Assessments of interpersonal relationships
The Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ) [65] is a
combined measure of attachment. Attachment style is a
comprehensive framework for understanding how emo-
tional bonds and relationships develop [66] and could
not be considered synonymous with interpersonal diffi-
culties. The RSQ is a 30-item continuous-scored scale
with four subscales that measure the degree to which

Mirkovic et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:393 

Page 4 of 10

individuals exhibit
four attachment patterns: secure,
fearful, dismissing, and preoccupied. A “secure” attach-
ment style (positive models of self and others) indicates
a sense of one’s own value and importance to others, as
well as a belief that others are generally available and
helpful in times of need, and that they accept us as we
are. The “preoccupied” style (negative self-model and
positive model of others), is characterized by the feeling
that we have little value for others and at the same time,
that we expect positive responses from them while fear-
ing that they are not as reassuring and comforting as we
would like. The “detached” style (positive model of one-
self and negative model of others) implies a feeling of
one’s own value that one owes only to oneself and very
negative expectations of others from whom, on the other
hand, one should expect nothing. Finally, the “fearful”
style (negative models of self and others) combines a
feeling of personal non-value in the eyes of others and
the belief that others are neither available nor benevo-
lent when needed. In a French validation study Cron-
bach’s coefficient was low for the prototypical scales
(0.41 for “secure”, 0.54 for “fearful”, 0.22 for “preoccu-
pied”, and moderate for “dismissive” (0.64) [67]. Zortea
et al. conducted an extensive psychometric study of the
RSQ in a sample of adults and suggested that a two-
dimensional (i.e., anxiety and avoidance) approach to
assessing adult attachment was optimal.

Others assessments
The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [68] is a well-
known instrument for assessing the intensity of depres-
sion in clinical and normal patients (Cronbach α = 0.86
for psychiatric patients and 0.81 for nonpsychiatric
subjects). Borderline disorder was investigated using the
Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-r)
[69]. The DIB-R is a semistructured interview (Cronbach
α = 0.86) comprising 105 items and 22 summary state-
ments for assessing the persistence of symptoms of BPD
over the course of the past two years and offers a more
comprehensive
such as
affective, behavioural, interpersonal, and cognitive phe-
notypes [70].

characterization of BPD,

To determine the severity of BPD symptoms, the par-
ticipants completed the McLean Screening Instrument
for BPD, Cronbach α = 0.87 [0.84;0.90] (MSI-BPD; [71,
72].

Data analytic plan
First, variables of interest were described. The parame-
ters chosen for quantitative variables were mean and
standard deviation. The parameters chosen for qualita-
tive variables were number of occurrences and fre-
quency. We then ran univariate comparison of variables
of interest between two groups, those who had zero

lifetime SAs versus those who had at least one lifetime
SA. Depending on the validity of the assumptions, quan-
titative variables were either tested using Welch t-test or
Wilcoxon rank sum test. Qualitative variables were ei-
ther tested using Chi-square test without continuity cor-
rection or Fisher’s exact test. Secondly, the mediating
role of emotional dysregulation on the relationship be-
tween SA, DD and relational difficulties was assessed
within the structural equation modelling framework
(SEM) with R lavaan package. This method is called path
analysis, which is a special case of SEM when there are
no latent variables in the model. Model specification was
done using prior knowledge. Outcome was the number
of lifetime suicide attempts, covariates were any moods
disorders and RSQ and the mediator was emotional dys-
regulation. Concerning the RSQ we have excluded the
items contributing to the secure attachment style. We

Results
Descriptive statistics and group differences
Of the initial cohort, variables of
interest were fully
available for 75 adolescents (11 boys, 15%, 64 girls, 85%).
The mean age was 16.3 years (SD = 1.4) and 67% (N =
50) were inpatients. Of the 75 participants, 15 (20%) had
not attempted suicide, 23 (31%) had committed one SA
and 37 (49%) had committed two or more SAs. Of those
who had attempted suicide, the lifetime average was 1.72
(SD = .45) The main modes of attempted suicide were
drug poisoning (75%), strangulation (9%) vein cutting
(8%) and jumping (4%). Table 1 shows the scores for all
the variables of interest and the comparisons between
the participants who had not attempted suicide and
those with at least one SA. Univariate analysis yielded
several significant differences for the Beck Depression
Inventory, all of the DIB-R subscales (affect, cognition,
impulsive actions and interpersonal relationships) and
the severity of BPD symptoms (MSI-BPD). Also, there
was no difference in terms of sex and age, cyclothymic-
hypersensitive temperament questionnaire (CHTQ) and
non-secure attachment style (RSQ). The participants
who had not attempted suicide show better overall func-
tioning, as assessed by their GAF score: mean (SD) 56.42
(10.19) vs. 41.05 (16.61), p = .03. Lifetime axis-I disorders

Structural equation model
The hypothesized model is illustrated in Fig. 1. Path a1
represents the effect of the independent variable (MDD
current and past) on the mediator (emotional dysregula-
tion), and path b the effect of the mediator on the
dependent variable (lifetime SA). Path c1 is the direct ef-
fect of lifetime MDD on lifetime SA. The same model
applies to the second variable: insecure attachment. Path
a2 represents the effect of insecure attachment on the
mediator, and path c2 the direct effect of insecure at-
tachment on lifetime SA. Results of the mediation ana-
lyses to test the significance of the direct and indirect
effects of lifetime MDD and insecure attachment on SA
through emotion dysregulation are displayed in Table 3
and Fig. 2. As expected from model specification, the
model is saturated and the fit cannot be assessed (CFI =
1 and RMSEA = 0).

Lifetime MDD has a significant direct effect on the
dependent variable (path c1: Estimate = .938, Std. Err =

.228, Std.all = .361, p < .001) and an indirect effect
through emotion dysregulation (path a1b: Estimate =
.228, Std. Err = .109, Std.all = .088, p = .036). In addition,
we found a significant overall effect (paths a1b + c1:
Estimate = 1.165, Std. Err = .196, Std.all = .449, p < .001)
on SA lifetime.

Insecure attachment style has a significant direct effect
(path c2: Estimate = .130, Std. Err = .053, Std.all = .195,
p = .019) on the dependent variable. We did not find a
significant indirect effect through emotion dysregulation
on SA lifetime (path a2b: Estimate = .016, Std. Err = .013,
Std.all = .024, p = .219). However,
the overall effect
(a2b + c2) is significant (Estimate = .146, Std. Err = .056,
Std.all = .218, p = .009).

Discussion
In this study we sought to examine the contribution of
emotional dysregulation to SA in borderline adolescents.
lifetime SA from 85
We proposed a SEM model of
participants of
the Collaborative European Research
Network on Borderline Personality Disorder, a high-risk
sample of adolescents with BPD. We predicted that (i)
lifetime MDD and interpersonal difficulties would be
positively associated with the number of lifetimes SAs;
(ii) that the association between lifetime MDD and SAs
would be partially related to emotional dysregulation;
(iii) and lastly that the association between interpersonal
difficulties and SA would be partially related to emo-
tional dysregulation.

Concerning our SEM model,

two results may be
highlighted. Firstly, the mediational results point to the
direct effects of MDD on lifetime SAs and their indirect
effects through increasing emotional dysregulation and
indicate that the overall effect may be an important risk
factor for SA in borderline adolescents. Secondly, we
specifically
have

interpersonal difficulties,

but had no indirect effect through emotional dysregula-
tion. This last point deserves to be underlined and
discussed. Interpersonal conflicts have been identified as
frequent precipitating factors in the adolescent popula-
tion.
linked to
attachment disorders, represent a central element of
borderline functioning. More specifically, traumatic at-
tachments during the first years of life appear either to
be strongly associated with the genesis of well-defined
mental disorders (e.g. traumatic-dissociative disorders)
or to occur variably in many other diagnostic categories,
a fact which complicates their clinical picture and
worsens their prognosis [73]. Manifestations of dissoci-
ation are very common in people with trauma-related
disorders such as PTSD or BPD [74], and are supposed
to be generated by the disintegrative processes activated
by the traumatic experience [75].

Borderline participants who have more difficulty in
regulating their emotional experiences are at greater risk
of SA. These results are consistent with research that
has demonstrated that BPD-related emotional dysregula-
tion predicts a range of prospective negative outcomes,
including SA [23, 76]. Yen et al. [23] showed in a pro-
spective 2-year study of a cohort of 621 adult borderline
subjects that only the affective instability feature of BPD

predicted SA. Similarly, Glenn et al. [33] showed similar
results in adolescent populations. In a sample of 97
borderline adolescents
the
affective instability facet of BPD was uniquely related to
SB and uniquely differentiated adolescent ideators and
attempters.

the authors

found that

As expected, our multivariate analyses also showed
very strongly that MDD is a major risk factor for SA in
borderline adolescents. This is consistent with the litera-
ture data that show that major depressive disorders are
the leading cause of suicide with a contribution of more
than 60% [9] and a 40 times greater risk of completing a
suicide [77].

Participants who had attempted suicide did not have
higher scores on the scales for assessing emotional dysreg-
ulation; however, it should be noted that the scores were
generally high in both groups. Two hypotheses may ex-
plain this result. On the one hand, the fact that both
groups comprised BPD subjects and that emotional dys-
regulation is a central feature of this disorder [17, 23, 24]
produces a limited range of variance that precludes any
differentiation between the two groups. From a neurode-
velopmental point of view, it is interesting to note that at
this age there are a set of neurobehavioural changes that
significantly influence the motivation and regulation of
[78]. Several models of adolescent brain

Fig. 2 Final SEM model of depressive disorders and interpersonal difficulties influencing suicide attempt as mediated by emotion dysregulation

development have suggested that a maturation gap be-
tween cognitive control and emotional processes may ex-
plain why adolescents tend to make more emotional
decisions, which may lead to increased risk behaviours
[79, 80]. These models emphasize the faster maturation of
the sub-cortical affective areas compared to the slower-
maturing frontal cortical areas. However, as Crone and
Dahl [81] have pointed out, there are also specific social
and emotional changes that occur during puberty due to
the subject’s environment and not simply due to develop-
mental immaturity.

There are some limitations to our study, which invite
to cautious interpretations of the findings and their
generalizability. Firstly, the use of a cross-sectional de-
sign limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the
role of
interpersonal difficulties, depressive disorders
and emotional dysregulation in the development and
maintenance of SB. Although structural equation model-
ling did not support an alternative direction of effects,
longitudinal modelling is needed to clarify these ques-
tions. Secondly, the self-assessment methodology used
may be subject to a registration bias, such as that deriv-
ing from social desirability. A third limitation of this re-
search concerns
the results.
Although the entire sample was derived from 5 recruit-
ment centers in 3 European countries, the responses
may not be transferable to other populations, mainly be-
cause of the high proportion of hospitalized patients.
Thus, a Berkson-type selection bias is possible. Finally,
questions may be asked as to the validity of the compos-
ite score for emotional dysregulation. There are several
justifications for creating a composite for emotional dys-
regulation. Firstly, the notion of emotional dysregulation
is broad and is thus difficult to evaluate it using a single
psychometric tool. Secondly, the notion of emotional
variability may refer either to the ways of dealing with
an emotional situation, or to the notion of emotional
vulnerability (the variables relating to the experience or

the generalization of

the quality of the emotion), or to the ability to under-
stand emotions. Thirdly, even if the three selected scales
do not share a common construct, all three reflect a
conceptual entity. Moreover, we found it appropriate to
include a degree of affective alexithymia. Alexithymia is
defined as poor awareness of emotions and a diminished
ability to think and talk about feelings [52]. Several au-
thors have suggested links between alexithymia and
emotional dysregulation [82]. Indeed, people who are
unaware of their feelings have greater difficulty modulat-
ing their emotional excitement, especially when they
perceive a potential danger in their relational environ-
ment. In this case, the relational conflict may be simply
processed as tension or distress, thus increasing the risk
of suicidal behaviour [83, 85].

This study has also several strengths. Firstly, the presence
of a consistent structured diagnostic procedure for all the
participants in the clinical sample for Axis I and Axis II
(LEAD Standard). Moreover, all the adolescents for whom
there was no consensus between investigators for the diag-
nosis of BPD were excluded. Secondly, we considered SA
only if the suicidal intention was clearly identified.

The results of our study could be considered in the
light of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality
Disorders who considers personality disorders as charac-
terized by impairments in personality functioning associ-
ated with specific pathological personality traits [84].
Disturbances in self and interpersonal functioning con-
stitute the core of personality psychopathology and are
evaluated on a continuum. Dimensional models of BPD
could be particularly pertinent in adolescents, as a di-
mensional approach may better account for the develop-
mental variability and heterogeneity observed during this
age period. The current literature suggests that the cen-
tral dysfunctional domains of BPD are affective dysregu-
lation, separation insecurity, depressivity, impulsivity and
risk-taking, which are intrinsically linked to each other
and possibly linked to an insecure attachment style [85].

Overall, the findings of the present study suggest that
emotional dysregulation may be a significant risk factor
for SA in adolescents with BPD. Our results support
suicide prevention efforts with adolescents that target
emotional dysregulation. And in fact, several studies
have shown the effectiveness of DBT-A programs specif-
ically targeting emotional dysregulation in reducing sui-
[86–88]. Other
cidal
approaches targeting interpersonal difficulties and emo-
tional dysregulation such as mentalization therapy have
also shown encouraging results. For example, the RCT
showed that
conducted by Rossouw et
mentalization-based therapy reduced the recurrence of
TS at 12 months in adolescents with multiple self-harm
or borderline personality disorders.

Conclusions
The results of our study suggest that emotional dysregu-
lation should be considered as a primary target of
psychotherapeutic approaches of borderline adolescents
as a strategy to improve the handling of interpersonal
difficulties and potentially prevent suicidal behaviours.
However,
further longitudinal studies are required to
examine how affective instability can predict future sui-
cidal behaviors in borderline adolescents over time and
in relation to comorbidities and the social environment.
