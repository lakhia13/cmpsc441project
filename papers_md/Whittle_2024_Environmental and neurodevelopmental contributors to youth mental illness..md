While a myriad of factors likely contribute to the development of mental illness in young people, the social environment (including
early adverse experiences) in concert with neurodevelopmental alterations is undeniably important. A number of inﬂuential
theories make predictions about how and why neurodevelopmental alterations may mediate or moderate the effects of the social
environment on the emergence of mental illness. Here, we discuss current evidence supporting each of these theories. Although
this area of research is rapidly growing, the body of evidence is still relatively limited. However, there exist some consistent ﬁndings,
including increased striatal reactivity during positive affective processing and larger hippocampal volumes being associated with
increased vulnerability or susceptibility to the effects of social environments on internalizing symptoms. Limited longitudinal work
has investigated neurodevelopmental mechanisms linking the social environment with mental health. Drawing from human
research and insights from animal studies, we propose an integrated mediation-moderation model and outline future research
directions to advance the ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION
The social environment, particularly experiences of adversity and
stress, has profound effects on cognitive, social, and emotional
functioning in young people. Childhood adversity is one of the
strongest predictors of mental illness onset [1], particularly during
illnesses ﬁrst
the ﬁrst two decades of life when many mental
emerge [2]. During this time, the brain is rapidly developing, and
alterations in brain development are also thought to contribute to
the onset of mental
illness [3, 4]. With the ultimate goal of
developing better prevention and intervention strategies to
reduce the immense burden of child and adolescent mental
illness, which has increased substantially in recent decades [5],
research and theory have increasingly sought to better under-
stand the role of both neurobiological and environmental factors
in mental illness risk. To this end, the aim of the present review is
to discuss theories that explore how the dynamics between the
social environment and neurobiology intersect to shape the
emergence of mental
illness in young people. Drawing upon
available evidence, with a speciﬁc emphasis on human neuroima-
ging studies, we aim to provide insights into the validity of these
for a more
theories. We conclude with recommendations
integrated theoretical model and suggest avenues for future
research in this area.

A key insight from developmental neuroscience, relevant to
understanding the integrative role of the social environment and
is brain plasticity. Brain
the brain in mental health and illness,
plasticity, which is substantially higher during childhood and
adolescence relative to adulthood, refers to the ability of the brain
from the
to reorganize neural pathways based on input

environment [6]. The overproduction and elimination of immature
synapses during childhood and adolescence, driven by both
intrinsic programming and environmental inﬂuences, are thought
to be key mechanisms of plasticity [6, 7]. However, other
mechanisms include the overproduction of neurons in early
development, apoptosis or programmed cell death of excessive
neurons, and at the molecular level, central nervous system
receptor alterations [6, 7].

in turn,

Of particular relevance to the development of mental illness in
young people is the notion that social environmental exposures
during periods of increased brain plasticity may alter neurodeve-
lopment. Altered neurodevelopment may,
increase or
decrease susceptibility to the development of mental health
problems. Such environmental input may have these effects via
experience-expectant or experience-dependent processes [8, 9].
Experience-expectant processes refer to changes resulting from
the presence or absence of environmental stimuli that the neural
system has evolved to expect early in life (e.g., the presence of a
sensitive and responsive caregiver vs. emotional neglect, provision
of food and shelter vs. physical neglect, exposure to sensory and
linguistic experiences vs. deprivation of such experiences) [10].
During such periods, expected inputs are thought to have an
increased impact on brain organization, triggering periods of
increased plasticity (i.e., sensitive periods). Conversely, experience-
dependent plasticity refers to the brain’s ability to reorganize and
adapt in response to individual experiences and environmental
stimuli. Experience-dependent plasticity is thought
to occur
throughout the lifespan but diminishes as the brain matures.
Adverse experiences that contribute to experience-dependent

plasticity might include the presence of traumatic or stressful
stimuli/events that threaten or are perceived to threaten (from an
evolutionary standpoint) survival (e.g., physical or sexual abuse,
exposure to crime, domestic violence, natural disaster, social
exclusion). Positive social experiences that may also impact

include supportive family and peer relationships [11–13], exposure
to stimulating educational settings [14, 15], etc.

via

Building on the notion of plasticity, a number of theories and
models have emerged that consider the role of neurodevelop-
mental processes in the link between the social environment and
the emergence of mental
illness during childhood and adoles-
cence. These theories serve to provide testable hypotheses, direct
research efforts and move the ﬁeld forward to advance knowl-
edge, with the ultimate goal of clinical and policy translation.
These theories differ in their developmental versus evolutionary
they take a deﬁcit versus
focus, whether

approach, and whether they focus on adaptive versus maladaptive
processes. They also differ in whether they primarily focus on
neurobiology or neurodevelopment as a mechanism (i.e., med-
iator) versus a moderator of environmental-mental health
associations (see Box 1). We next discuss these theories and their
current empirical evidence, grouped by whether they take a
mediation versus moderation approach.

MODELS OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL MECHANISMS LINKING
THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT WITH PSYCHOPATHOLOGY (I.E.,
MEDIATION MODELS)
Theories aiming to explain neurodevelopmental mechanisms
linking adverse social environmental experiences with mental
health propose a causal chain whereby adverse experiences
directly impact the developing brain, which in turn increases the
risk of developing psychopathology. One such theory is the Stress
Acceleration Hypothesis [SAH [16], which builds on evolutionary

Box 1.

Statistical mediation versus moderation

Two statistical concepts, namely mediation and moderation, are commonly used
to elucidate the complexities of relationships among three or more variables.
Statistical mediation tests whether and to what extent an independent variable
(IV) inﬂuences a dependent variable (DV) via one or more intervening variables. It
thereby tests mechanistic questions, explicating the underlying causal pathway
between the IV and DV, or the “how” and “why” an IV inﬂuences the DV. An
intervening variable or variables may partially or fully mediate (or explain) the
association between the IV and DV. Further, contemporary theory suggests that a
statistically signiﬁcant association (or a total effect) does not necessarily need to
exist between the IV and DV for statistical mediation to be possible [103, 104]. This
is because there can be many different paths of inﬂuence from the IV to the DV,
and these paths could operate in opposite directions, canceling each other out
and producing an overall non-signiﬁcant total effect between the IV and DV. To
if time spent studying signiﬁcantly
provide an example of a mediation effect,
mediates the association between intelligence quotient (IV) and exam perfor-
mance (DV), then this may indicate that part of the effect of intelligence quotient
on exam performance operates through the amount of time spent studying.
Students with higher intelligence quotients may be more likely to study longer,
leading to better exam performance.

In contrast, statistical moderation refers to the conditional nature of

the
relationship between an IV and DV, contingent upon the levels of a third
moderating variable (or moderating variables). By examining the interactive effects
of IV and moderator/s in predicting the DV, moderation analysis unpacks the
nuanced conditions under which the relationship between IV and DV intensiﬁes,
weakens, or remains unchanged depending on the moderating variable/s. In the
case of signiﬁcant moderation, the association between an IV and DV may be
stronger, or even only present, at a certain level of a (categorical or continuous)
moderating variable. Or it could be strong but a different sign/direction (positive
versus negative) for different (e.g., high versus low) levels of a moderator. Using the
same variables from the mediation example, if time spent studying signiﬁcantly
moderates the association between intelligence quotient (IV) and exam perfor-
mance (DV), the effect of
intelligence quotient on exam performance varies
depending on the amount of time spent studying. For students who study less, a
higher intelligence quotient may lead to superior exam performance. For those who
study more, intelligence quotient may not be associated with exam performance.

faster
biological development to be an evolutionary adaptive strategy
that allows for earlier reproduction in contexts of adversity. The
SAH suggests that adverse experiences (particularly relating to the
caregiving environment) accelerate neurodevelopmental pro-
cesses to reach “adult-like” functioning earlier. Speciﬁcally, the
hypothesis refers to the accelerated development of brain regions
and connections considered important for emotion processing,
emotion regulation,
amygdala-
prefrontal circuitry); because in situations deﬁned by missing or
inconsistent parental care, it may be adaptive to transition from a
state of parent-regulation to self-regulation sooner. The SAH also
argues that the precocious development of this circuitry, while
initially adaptive, could contribute to impairment in emotion
regulation abilities, thus having negative consequences for later
mental health.

and memory

(speciﬁcally,

Although the SAH originally posited for this acceleration to
occur in the context of caregiver-related adversity, this model has
been extended and applied more broadly to early adverse
experiences characterized by chronic stress [18]. Tooley et al.
argue that chronic stress (which may occur, for example, in the
context of socioeconomic disadvantage) may lead to accelerated
brain development via the process described by the SAH, but
other mechanisms may include repeated use of stress-regulation
circuitry, and/or via increasing glucocorticoid levels and activation
of inﬂammatory processes [18]. Speciﬁc neural circuits are not
speciﬁed, however, and predictions are made about brain
development in general. Rakesh et al. [19], similarly speculating
about both adversity and brain development more generally, have
suggested that adversity (speciﬁcally low socioeconomic status) is
likely to be associated with a distinct developmental pattern
involving slower brain development across childhood and
adolescence. They make this prediction based on longitudinal
evidence of socioeconomic disadvantage being associated with a
slower rate-of-change and persistently lower cortical thickness,
area, and volume throughout childhood and adolescence [19],
and suggest that these brain changes mediate links with poor
mental health (and other) outcomes. Speciﬁc mechanisms are
suggested to include impaired synaptic pruning and slower neural
circuit reﬁnement. Another theory with similarities to SAH, the
latent vulnerability theory [20], suggests that early maltreatment
creates an underlying latent vulnerability, increasing future mental
health risk. This latent vulnerability is suggested to involve
alterations to one or more of several neural systems, including
those that modulate threat processing, reward-processing, execu-
tive control, and emotion regulation. Notably, this theory does not
specify that these alterations necessarily reﬂect accelerated (or
delayed) neural development.

Another extension of the SAH was proposed by Colich et al. [21],
who suggested that stress-associated acceleration may depend on
the type of adversity experienced, in line with the Dimensional
[22–24]. The
Model of Adversity and Psychopathology (DMAP)
DMAP proposes that adversity can be classiﬁed into two main
types: threat and deprivation. Experiences of threat and harm
(such as physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) can be classiﬁed as
“threat”, whereas the lack of expected caring and nurturing input
(e.g., lack of physical and emotional support, and cognitive/social
stimulation) can be classiﬁed as experiences of deprivation. The
theory posits
threat and
that while they often co-occur,
deprivation have at least partially distinct neurodevelopmental
correlates. Colich et al. [21], similarly to Tooley et al. and Rakesh
et al., went beyond the idea of acceleration of the amygdala-
prefrontal circuit, and discussed the idea of biological aging more
globally. They proposed the idea that experiences characterized
by threat, but not deprivation, would be associated with
accelerated biological aging,
including accelerated gray matter
and amygdala-prefrontal connectivity development. A recent
integrated model of dimensions of environmental experience [25]

Neuropsychopharmacology (2025) 50:201 – 210

builds on these ideas further, suggesting that deprivation is likely
to have complex effects, particularly relating to whether it is
predictable vs. unpredictable, or within proximal vs. distal
environments. For example, it is suggested that when experiences
of deprivation are unpredictable, the neurobiology supporting
some aspects of executive functioning (e.g.,
inhibitory control,
working memory capacity) will show a delayed development,
while alterations to other aspects may be mitigated in the case
where these functions are important for survival (e.g., cognitive
ﬂexibility allows for ﬂexibly switching between mental sets).

The recently developed change of pace theory [26] provides a
similar account
insofar as it
to the aforementioned models,
proposes different neurodevelopmental trajectories depending on
speciﬁc forms of adversity experienced in childhood. The change
of pace hypothesis contends that the type of adversity encoun-
tered determines whether biological maturation is expedited or
retarded by focusing on the parent-child dyad, and suggests that
changes in the rate of development occur primarily to eliminate
gaps in parental caregiving. They purport that delaying matura-
tion speciﬁcally lowers children’s total physiological requirements
when there are unmet physiological needs, like in situations of
deprivation or neglect (e.g.,
in case of inadequate nutrition or
parental neglect). In the event of threat or abuse however, if there
are unmet safety needs (e.g., shelter from threat or protection),
accelerated development would boost children’s general ability
for autonomous safety requirements provision, with this accelera-
tion resulting in a later (post-childhood) stunting of develop-
mental autonomy. While change of pace theory does not provide a
comprehensive account of neural circuits implicated, the function
and neural regulation of the HPA-axis is discussed as likely critical.

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR MEDIATION MODELS FROM
LONGITUDINAL STUDIES
While others have reviewed evidence for the aforementioned
models, they have included both cross-sectional and longitudinal
studies [18, 21] or have not focused on studies investigating
mental health outcomes using statistical tests for mediation (e.g.,
[19]). Given that most of these models make predictions about
developmental
trajectories, cross-sectional data is arguably
inappropriate for testing them [19]. This is not to say that cross-
sectional examinations of brain structure, function or connectivity
cannot provide useful information about the impact of environ-
mental exposures on development. Rather, longitudinal research
is needed to truly test deviations from typical developmental
trajectories as proposed by the aforementioned models. Further,
studies investigating associations between adverse social environ-
ments and brain development, without investigating links with
mental health outcomes, are useful for testing these models (e.g.,
as reviewed by [18, 19, 21]). Here, however, we focus only on
studies that investigated mental health outcomes using statistical
tests of mediation, so that interpretation of the adaptive versus
maladaptive nature of adverse environmental impacts on brain
development was possible. As such, we exclusively review studies
investigating longitudinal neurobiological mediators of the associa-
tions between adverse social environmental variables and mental
health outcomes. Finally, we did not restrict our review of studies
based on the speciﬁc type of adverse social environment assessed.

There have been similar reports of adversity-related alterations
in resting-state connectivity development being associated with
more positive mental health outcomes. For example, Brieant et al.
[30] showed that lifetime negative life experiences were linked to
reductions in cortico-limbic resting-state functional connectivity
over time during early adolescence (from age 9 to 13), which, in
turn, was associated with lower internalizing symptoms. Based on
normative patterns of connectivity development, the authors
suggest that this ﬁnding reﬂects accelerated maturation of neural
circuitry responsible for emotion processing and regulation
(consistent with SAH/Tooley et al./latent vulnerability theory),
which is adaptive and beneﬁcial for wellbeing. Further discussion
on the possibility of these neurobiological alterations reﬂecting
adaptive brain phenotypes is provided in subsequent sections.

In alignment with the integrated model of dimensions of
environmental experience and change of pace theory, Rakesh
et al. [31] found that increases in connectivity between cortical
networks (particularly the default mode,
frontoparietal, dorsal
attention and salience networks) from age 16 to 19 mediated the
relationship between childhood maltreatment and later depres-
sive symptoms, with ﬁndings potentially driven by experiences of
neglect. Given that between-network connectivity normatively
decreases
and increased connectivity
between functionally distinct networks has been linked to poor
cognitive performance [32], the authors suggested that ﬁndings
may reﬂect a mechanism by which delayed functional connectiv-
ity development underlies cognitive impairments in adolescents
with depression and a history of deprivation. Similarly, Hanson
et al. [33] found that emotional neglect was associated with
blunted development of reward-related ventral striatal activity
between early and late adolescence (approximately 11–17 years of
age). Additionally, blunted reward-related ventral striatal activity
mediated the association between neglect and greater depressive
later. This ﬁnding may be

Regarding brain structural development,

two studies have
implicated hippocampal development in patterns consistent with
different models. Miller et al. [34] found that greater perinatal
adversity (e.g.,
low family income, maternal
mental health problems) was associated with increased growth in
the right hippocampal body across childhood (from age 4.5 to
7.5). Further, adversity was indirectly associated with late child-
hood (age 8.5) depressive symptoms via increased hippocampal
body growth. Conversely, Barch et al.
found that early
childhood poverty was related to reduced testosterone increases.
This was,
linked to smaller initial volume and reduced
volumetric growth of the hippocampus during the transition from
school age to adolescence (i.e., age 7 to 12). These neurobiological
changes mediated associations with elevated emotion dysregula-
tion and depressive symptoms during late adolescence (age ~19).
As such, these two studies identify opposite ﬁndings of increased
and reduced hippocampal development potentially reﬂecting

maladaptive patterns of development contributing to increased
vulnerability to the development of depression. In the former case,
ﬁndings may reﬂect accelerated development following adversity,
consistent with SAH/Tooley et al., whereas in the latter case,
ﬁndings may reﬂect a delay in development, consistent with
Rakesh et al.’s model, integrated model of dimensions of environ-
mental experience, and change of pace theories (to the extent that
poverty may reﬂect deprivation experiences).

While these studies provide some support for the aforemen-
tioned mediation models, there are a number of examples of
relevant studies with null ﬁndings [36–41], clearly highlighting the
need for further research in this area. Future work should also
address limitations of the current evidence base. In particular, in
many of the reviewed studies, conclusions about accelerated or
delayed neurobiological development are limited, given (1)
studies do not examine the full span of neurodevelopment (from
birth to adulthood), (2) normative patterns of neurodevelopment
(from which to compare) are not necessarily known (particularly
for measures of brain function or functional connectivity), and (3)
non-linear growth is rarely investigated [despite the normative
non-linear brain developmental patterns for a number of neural
metrics [42]. It is important to note, however, that a few studies
exist that address some of these issues using methods other than
mediation to test links with mental health [43].

MODELS OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL FACTORS THAT MODIFY
ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
AND MENTAL HEALTH (I.E., MODERATION MODELS)
Person-by-environment
interaction frameworks are commonly
used to understand individual risk or susceptibility to mental
health problems. Such conceptual models have a common tenet
that people are variably inﬂuenced by environmental factors, and
one source of this variability is likely person-centered factors.
These include biologically-based person-centered factors, includ-
ing aspects of brain structure and function. Within the literature,
there are two broad conceptualizations of person-by-environment
or biology-by-environment interactions. Developmental theories
purport that there is an optimal trajectory of human development
that adversity can derail. Evolutionary-developmental
theories
argue against the existence of a single optimal trajectory of
development.
Instead, they posit that because humans have
evolved to develop in various environments, both adverse and
there may be multiple adaptive developmental
supportive,
trajectories.
In this sense, optimal development is framed as
context-dependent. Notably, these theories are not particularly
speciﬁc regarding the types of relevant social environmental
factors; rather, there is a general focus on early social environ-
ments that are either negative/adverse/marked by chronic stress
or positive/supportive/low stress. While we do not cover all
relevant models here, we focus on key models where measures of
neurobiology have been utilized to examine interactions between
in relation to psychopathology in
biology and environment
children and adolescents.

The broad class of developmental theories includes the dual-risk
model [44], diathesis-stress theory [45], and cumulative stress theory
[46]. These models generally argue that some individuals possess
inherent vulnerabilities to poor developmental outcomes includ-
ing psychopathology, which can be triggered by environmental
stressors. Cumulative stress theory suggests that if there is an
accumulation of stressors across the lifespan that exceeds a
certain threshold, at-risk individuals are more likely to develop
psychopathology [46]. Most formulations of these models suggest
that the inherent vulnerability (or diathesis) factors are biological
[47–49].

Evolutionary-developmental models,

including the Differential
Susceptibility model [50] and the biological sensitivity to context
model [51], argue that individuals vary in their susceptibility to

inﬂuence, for better and worse. That is, highly
environmental
susceptible individuals beneﬁt more from supportive environ-
ments and suffer more in adverse circumstances compared to
those with low susceptibility. Differential susceptibility developed
from evolutionary theory [50], and biological sensitivity to context
was formed in response to unexpected ﬁndings revealing that
children with high immune reactivity exhibited the highest rates
of illness in high-stress family environments and lowest illness
occurrence in low-stress environments [51, 52]. Together, these
frameworks, hereafter referred to as “differential susceptibility”
due to their substantial overlap [53, 54], argue that susceptibility is
an evolutionary-adaptive characteristic that is instantiated biolo-
intermediate phenotypes
gically early in life through genetics,
(e.g., the brain), and behavioral phenotypes. Differential suscept-
ibility theory does not discount that dual-risk/diathesis-stress
processes exist; rather, it argues that the same biological factor
could lead to different outcomes
If
supportive environments and positive outcomes are not investi-
gated, then differential susceptibility effects may be overlooked
and mislabeled as vulnerability effects [55].

in different contexts.

Extension to these theories

include the match/mismatch
hypothesis, which stems from evolution theory, and suggests that
individuals with high “programming sensitivity” are more likely to
be at mental health risk if a mismatch occurs between the early
programming environment and the later adult environment. The
beneﬁts and costs of high programming sensitivity (which might
take the form of higher physiological reactivity, for example) are
context-dependent. Individuals with high programming sensitivity
adapt to early environments in preparation for similar future
experiences. If a context is encountered in the future that does not
match the early environment, then there may be poor mental
health outcomes for the individual. These individuals, however,
are suggested to beneﬁt from a match of early life and adult
environment, even if both are aversive [56]. A similar idea was
captured by the 3-hit hypothesis (where the ﬁrst “hit” represents a
speciﬁc genetic background) [57].

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR MODERATION MODELS
The neural mechanisms underlying vulnerability or sensitivity to
the social environment have been increasingly investigated by
researchers interested in testing biology-by-environment interac-
tions. Below, we review studies that have sought to test dual-risk/
diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility theories, as currently
there is limited human empirical work that has sought to test the
nuances of some of the other theories. Notably, we only review
studies that test the interaction between a social environmental
variable and brain structure of function in association with mental
health. Cross-sectional or longitudinal studies are reviewed given
that these theories make no predictions about brain development
per se. Again, we do not constrain our review of studies based on
the negative or positive
variables
investigated.

environmental

social

A number of studies have investigated neural function during
exposure to positive or rewarding stimuli
in adolescents (e.g.,
[58–60]). Most results have supported dual-risk/diathesis-stress
effects, with greater striatal activation to such stimuli being
associated with higher internalizing [59, 61] or externalizing [60]
symptoms in the context of adverse environments (e.g., high
family conﬂict, [60, 61]; peer victimization [59]). These results may
be interpreted as indicating that youth who are highly (neurally)
sensitive to reward may be highly tuned to social interactions with
friends and family. As a result, they may be more likely to be
negatively affected by adverse family and peer environments, and
more vulnerable to developing mental health problems as a result.
Others have found support for neural reactivity to positive
stimuli/reward as reﬂecting differential susceptibility. Liu et al. [58],

than vulnerability alone)

Fewer studies have investigated neural activation associated
with negative emotion processing (e.g., [62–64]) or other aspects
of neural function (e.g., cognitive functioning [65]). These studies,
conducted in late-childhood and adolescent samples,
largely
report ﬁndings consistent with dual-risk/diathesis-stress, with
alterations in the function of regions and networks including the
anterior cingulate cortex [63], inferior parietal sulcus [62], posterior
cingulate,
junction and amygdala [64], and
executive network [65] being associated with increased externaliz-
ing problems when exposed to negative social environments
(including low parental support [62], family disconnection [63],
neighborhood crime [64] and neighborhood threat [65]).

temporoparietal

A few studies have found patterns of resting-state connectivity
to be associated with vulnerability to internalizing symptoms in
adolescents, consistent with dual-risk/diathesis-stress. For exam-
ple, lower coupling between the amygdala and vmPFC [66] and
higher
initial but steeper decreases in average whole-brain
connectivity from age 9 to 19 years [67], have been associated
with higher internalizing symptoms in the context of more averse
environments (stressful life events [66], unpredictable negative life
events [67]). In another study, lower connectivity in the central
executive network and higher anti-correlation between the
salience and default mode networks were associated with
differential susceptibility in adolescents, whereby for adolescents
with these patterns of connectivity, high maternal hostility was
associated with higher anxiety symptoms, whereas low maternal
hostility was associated with lower anxiety symptoms [68].

A number of studies have investigated cortical and subcortical
structure as possible diathesis or susceptibility markers [69–77].
Most studies have focused on the adolescent period, while some
have investigated infants [71, 73]. The hippocampus has been
particularly implicated in these studies, with several studies of
adolescents suggesting that larger hippocampal volume may
confer vulnerability or perhaps susceptibility to environmental
exposures, being associated with greater depressive symptoms in
the context of more negative environments (high family conﬂict,
family disconnection, high community crime, high levels of
aggressive parenting behavior) and fewer depressive symptoms
in the context of more positive environments (low family conﬂict,
family connection, low community crime, low levels of aggressive
parenting behavior) [70, 74, 75]. As suggested by Schriber et al.
[74], given the role of the hippocampus in complex contextual
memory processing [78], and ﬁndings of
larger hippocampal
volumes being associated with superior episodic learning and
memory ability [79], ﬁndings may suggest that adolescents with
larger hippocampal volumes process their social contexts more
deeply, rendering them more susceptible to the inﬂuences of both
positive and negative experiences. Notably, larger hippocampal
infants to reﬂect a

susceptibility marker
sensitivity in relation to
indicating that larger hippocampal
attachment outcomes [73],
volumes may be a susceptibility marker across different develop-
mental periods. Also notable is that there is some evidence for sex
differences in this effect, with one study reporting a susceptibility
effect for females but not males [75]. The interpretation of this sex
difference is unclear but could reﬂect

SUMMARY OF SUPPORT FOR MODELS
Although not a systematic review of the literature, the studies
discussed do offer some degree of support for many of the
discussed models. Two relatively consistent ﬁndings emerged.
Increased striatal reactivity to positive/rewarding stimuli appeared
to reﬂect a vulnerability or diathesis, associated with high
internalizing problems in the context of a negative social
environment. Larger hippocampal volumes appeared to reﬂect a
susceptibility marker, related to higher internalizing problems in
the context of a negative social environment and fewer problems
in the context of a positive social environment. There are currently
too few longitudinal studies, however, to make strong conclusions
about consistent effects of mediation models. Below we discuss
how the reviewed theories and models may be integrated to
guide future research and move the ﬁeld forward.

INTEGRATION OF MODELS
The aforementioned theories and models are not mutually
exclusive. It is possible that they all accurately describe aspects
of
the complex role of neurobiology in linking the social
environment with mental health. It is also possible, if not very
likely, that the environment shapes neurodevelopment, and
patterns of neurodevelopment determine ongoing vulnerability
or susceptibility to environmental exposures. It is important to
point out that the descriptions of the theories provided above
are relatively brief, and some of the theories provide far more
complex accounts that provide a basis for integration across
mediation and moderation models. For example, biological
sensitivity to context theory suggests that increased sensitivity
is driven by early environmental exposures, such that those
growing up in more supportive or more adverse early environ-
ments are hypothesized to become more sensitive to future
it would be adaptive to be
environments. In the former case,
maximally inﬂuenced by the developmental environment, and
in the latter case, it would be adaptive to be vigilant to threats in
order to increase chances of survival and eventual reproduction
[53]. Latent vulnerability theory suggests that one of the ways
induced by early experiences of
that
maltreatment, may increase risk is by altering responses to
future stressors [20].

latent vulnerabilities,

Few human neuroimaging studies have attempted to test such
complex models involving neurobiology as both a mechanism/
mediator and moderator of associations between the social
environment and mental health outcomes, although we note one
recent study that investigated prenatal adversity [80]. In this study,
prenatal adversity (e.g., prenatal maternal mental health problems
and poverty) was associated with a steeper decrease in structure-
function connectivity coupling (SC-FC) from early- to mid-child-
hood, potentially suggestive of accelerated neurodevelopment.
SC-FC during early childhood moderated the association between
prenatal adversity and both internalizing and externalizing
problems during mid-childhood. Speciﬁcally, high early childhood
SC-FC appeared to act as a diathesis, such that only children with
high SC-FC experienced poor mental health in the context of high
prenatal adversity.

Here, we build on the reviewed theories and models, and
together with insights from the reviewed studies, we propose an
integrated mediation-moderation model of the role of neurode-
velopment in linking the social environment with mental health
(Fig. 1). We focus on adversity associated with the experiences of
stress, but do not make predictions about speciﬁc dimensions of
adversity. We make speciﬁc predictions in relation to hippocampal
volume. However, we also discuss how the model may extend

consistent with Miller et al.’s [34] ﬁnding (reviewed above) of
perinatal adversity being associated with increased growth in

sing following adverse environments is also consistent with the
SAH. We suggest that exposure to particularly positive environ-
ments may similarly lead to accelerated hippocampal maturation.

relatively larger hippocampal volumes, might persist throughout

differential susceptibility or biological sensitivity to context. This
proposition is also consistent with the reviewed ﬁndings: larger

Following initial accelerated maturation in response to early
adverse environments, we propose that hippocampal growth may
slow after a period of time, due to the effects of the early adversity
and associated stress on growth programs. In those exposed to
early positive environments, growth subsequent to initial accel-
eration is not affected. The notion of early adversity being linked
the hippocampus,
with an initial accelerated maturation of
combined with stunting of its growth,
is consistent with the
change of pace theory predictions about development following
threat to safety needs.
It is also consistent with animal work.
Speciﬁcally, animal work has shown that early adversity or stress
leads to markers of accelerated hippocampal maturation (pre-
cocious arrival of Parvalbumin-positive cells, earlier switch in
NMDA receptor subunit expression, earlier rise in myelin basic
protein expression), combined with markers of reduced hippo-
campal growth (earlier developmental decline in expression of
markers of cell proliferation and differentiation) [82]. Accelerated
maturation may be adaptive and have short-term advantages, but
at the expense of truncated growth, leading to longer-term poor
outcomes and risk for mental health problems. As reviewed
above, Barch et al. [35] found early adversity (poverty) to be
associated with reduced hippocampal growth from late childhood
through adolescence, and this reduced growth was associated
with higher depressive symptoms. Slowed hippocampal growth
has been associated with the development of mental health
problems, such as depression, in other human work (see also [84]).
In summary, we suggest that early exposure to adverse, stressful
environments and positive environments, may result in an initial
accelerated maturation of

We suggest that there may be similar effects for other brain
structures and circuits involved in the detection and processing of
salient positive and negative environmental stimuli, including the
amygdala and connectivity of the SN. The amygdala is involved in
the detection and processing of both positive and negative salient
affective stimuli [85] and modulates physiological stress responses
[86]. The SN, which involves connections between the amygdala
and other midline regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate

toward social affective stimuli and, via connections with default
mode and cognitive control networks, the generation of appro-
priate behavioral responses [87].

Existing work partly supports the role of these regions and
networks as both mediators and moderators of links between the
social environment and mental health in children and adolescents.
For example, animal work has shown effects of early adversity on
markers of accelerated maturation in the amygdala, similar to
those observed in the hippocampus [88]. In humans, adversity has
been found to predict larger amygdala volumes in childhood but
smaller volumes in adolescence [89], potentially reﬂecting early
acceleration followed by delayed growth. Moreover,
increased
amygdala reactivity to affective/salient stimuli has been proposed
as a differential susceptibility marker [20], and this was supported
in the study described above by Liu et al. [58]. Larger amygdala

positive environments, whether chronicity and severity are

maturation to delayed growth occurs, and which speciﬁc

research. Although not comprehensive, we believe they represent
important issues that if addressed, will move the ﬁeld forward
considerably.

LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT LITERATURE, AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
Deﬁcit-focused models and the idea of resilience
With the exception of differential susceptibility theory and our
proposed integrated mediation-moderation model, the prominent
focus of the aforementioned models, and much of the empirical
literature, has been around risk factors and deﬁcits associated with
brain development and mental health. Although such deﬁcit-
focused research has provided valuable insights into neurodevelop-
ment and the neurobiological basis of mental illness, it may have
oversimpliﬁed the complexity of brain and psychological develop-
ment, with other factors, such as protective factors, often over-
deﬁcit-focused
ﬁndings
looked.
neurodevelopmental research may contribute to the stigmatization
of mental illness, given the emphasis of “problems” associated with
illness as opposed to acknowledging strengths and
mental
potentials for recovery and growth. Shifting focus toward resilience
rather than risk could potentially address these limitations.

Additionally,

from

Recent reviews on the topic of resilience neurobiology have
demonstrated that the structure and function of threat, reward,
and cognitive control neural networks may be associated with
resilience in adults [91–93], that is, associated with positive (or
absence of negative) mental health outcomes following adversity.
However, our recent systematic review on the subject found that
fewer studies have investigated the role of brain development in
resilience to poor mental health outcomes in children and
adolescents [94].

this approach has been criticized,

Further exploration of resilience, particularly in the context of
neurobiology, holds promise for
informing preventive and
therapeutic interventions aimed at promoting mental well-being
It is important to note, however, that while early
in youth.
conceptualizations of resilience suggested it to be an individual
trait,
including by those
suggesting that it may result in power imbalances and discrimina-
tion within society [95]. More contemporary conceptualizations
emphasize resilience to be a dynamic multisystem process of
adaptation post experiences of signiﬁcant negative experiences; a
process that involves brain (and other aspects of biological)
development, and other contextual factors at the family, commu-
nity, and broader levels [96]. Future work, however, is needed to
address heterogeneity in the deﬁnition of resilience and how best
to operationalize and test it [see detailed discussion in [94].

Adaptation vs. maladaptation
Although the different discussed theories describe both adaptive
and maladaptive brain changes, as described above, the current

relevant mental health research primarily takes a deﬁcit approach.
Any adaptive brain changes identiﬁed (in terms of mental health
outcomes) tend to be identiﬁed “accidentally” (see [94]). Further
work is needed, for example, to identify whether brain changes
following adversity are adaptive in the short term but maladaptive
longer-term, whether
they are adaptive versus maladaptive
depending on the context (as proposed by differential susceptibility
and our integrated mediation-moderation model), or are adaptive
in terms of one outcome but maladaptive in terms of another
outcome. Regarding the latter notion, one example of this, which
was discussed above, was a ﬁnding by Rakesh et al. [27] of

but

Further, regarding adaptive brain changes, there are open
questions about whether these brain changes are inherent or
driven by supportive environments. Alternatively, they may reﬂect
later negative and positive
susceptibility markers, such that
experiences propel individuals to negative and positive outcomes,
respectively. To comprehensively test differential susceptibility
effects, studies are needed that measure positive and negative
environments, in addition to positive and negative outcomes. It
cannot necessarily be assumed that low levels of a negative
environment equate to high levels of a positive environment, for
example.

Type of environment and timing of environmental and brain
measures
The vast majority of available studies have investigated the early
and mid-adolescent periods, with few studies investigating early
and mid-childhood. The early-mid-adolescent period has been
suggested as particularly important
the expression of
differential susceptibility [97], given that it is associated with
increased sensitivity to social stimuli
[98] and increased pre-
valence of psychopathology [5]. Schriber and Guyer [97] suggest
that measures of neurobiology may be more likely to reﬂect
susceptibility (sensitivity to both positive and negative environ-
ments) than vulnerability (sensitivity only to negative environ-
ments) during adolescence relative to other periods (given that
adolescence is a period of heightened sensitivity to both negative
and positive social contexts); future research is needed to test this
possibility.

for

More studies of early-mid childhood, however, are needed to
test mediation-based theories, particularly those that focus on the
early rearing environment or “early” adversity more generally
(including our proposed model). Investigating neurodevelopment
immediately or soon after the onset of early adverse experiences
will shed light on the initial neurobiological response to adversity.
Further, the change of pace [26], Rakesh et al.’s model [19], and our
proposed integrated mediation-moderation model make predic-
tions about patterns of development across childhood and
adolescence. Longitudinal studies that capture many years of
development are needed to comprehensively test these models.
Relatedly, the majority of studies have not measured the timing
of exposure to the social environmental factor of interest. The
timing of onset,
in addition to the chronicity and severity of
exposure, are likely to be important in shaping neurodevelopment
or interacting with neurodevelopment to inﬂuence mental health
[82, 99]. Clarifying timing effects will help to reﬁne models, and
more generally determine whether there are speciﬁc sensitive
periods for different social environmental exposures, and whether
these differ for different neural regions and circuits.

Regarding the type of social environment investigated, existing
studies have been quite mixed and have investigated varying
aspects of the family environment (e.g., childhood maltreatment,
family connectedness, parenting behavior), the peer environment
(e.g., peer victimization), and broader family, neighborhood, and
family poverty, neighborhood

factors

(e.g.,

disadvantage, community crime), in addition to general negative
life events. Of note,
few studies have investigated the peer
environment, which may be particularly relevant for differential
susceptibility effects during adolescence (as per above discussion),
or other experiences of social stress, such as minority-related
discrimination. There is currently minimal research using media-
tion frameworks to test differential threat versus deprivation
experiences (and how they may interact with unpredictability) as
per change of pace theory and the integrated model of dimensions
of environmental experience. While differential susceptibility theory
suggests that positive environmental exposures are not merely
the inverse of negative environmental exposures [54], not all
moderation studies tested positive environmental exposures and
hence may have been unable to detect differential susceptibility
effects. As such, more research is needed to test whether there is
speciﬁcity regarding the types of environmental
factors and
contexts that may inﬂuence and interact with neurobiology to
predict mental health.

Integration of human and animal research
Some of the discussed theories and models are, in part, based on
evidence from animal research. Animal research, while limited in
providing accounts of speciﬁc psychiatric disorders, is particularly
important for elucidating how different types of environmental
exposures causally inﬂuence the brain, and how this plays out
over time [100]. For example, as outlined above, markers of both
accelerated maturation (e.g., precocious arrival of Parvalbumin-
positive cells), and growth (e.g., developmental changes in
expression of markers of cell proliferation and differentiation)
can be investigated over time [82]. Speciﬁc drivers of increased
neural susceptibility can also be investigated. For example, mouse
knockout models have begun to test the function of the SERT
polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) s-allele (which has been linked to
differential susceptibility)
in inhibitory control over excitatory
neurons in the cortex and expression of various GABAergic
markers [101].

Animal research will thus be beneﬁcial for testing aspects of the
discussed models. Comprehensive animal studies investigating
whether and how adverse and positive early environments
inﬂuence neurodevelopmental markers of increased differential
susceptibility would be particularly informative. Some relevant
work has been done; a recent study, for example, manipulated
prenatal stress and rearing-environment quality in prairie voles,
and found that prenatal stress was associated with heightened
behavioral and physiological reactivity and also with increased
susceptibility to both positive and negative rearing experiences
[102].

CONCLUSION
To conclude, while the role of the social environment in impacting
mental health and the development of mental illness in young
people has been acknowledged for several decades, knowledge of
how neurobiological and neurodevelopmental factors play a role
in this lags behind. There have been many theoretical advance-
ments more recently, however, that provide testable hypotheses
to move the ﬁeld forward. A growing research body has started to
shed light on the validity of these models. We propose that further
research is particularly needed that tests integrated models to
provide a comprehensive account of
