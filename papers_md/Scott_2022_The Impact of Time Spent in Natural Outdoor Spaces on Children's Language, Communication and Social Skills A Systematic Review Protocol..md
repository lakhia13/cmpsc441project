Abstract: There has been increasing interest over the past decade with regard to the health and
wellbeing implications of time spent outdoors in nature for children. Universal systematic reviews of
evidence report beneﬁts to physical health, social-emotional mental health and wellbeing, cognition
and academic learning. Internationally, there is indicative evidence to suggest outdoor engagement
with nature may also impact children’s language and communication skills, skills that are critical to
development, education, social relationships and life opportunities. Yet, at present such evidence
has not been synthesised. Despite evidence for the beneﬁts of the outdoors, the amount of time
children are spending outdoors is in rapid decline, and has been further exacerbated by the COVID-
19 pandemic. Alongside this are increasing numbers of children starting primary education with
signiﬁcant speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) which remain persistent over time.
With established wide-reaching beneﬁts of nature to children’s physical and mental health and
psychological development, there is a need to further explore the more speciﬁc impacts of the natural
environment on children’s language, communication and social skills, which could provide a unique
opportunity to consider nature as a universal public health intervention for SLCN. The current review
will aim to synthesise existing qualitative and quantitative evidence of the impact of time spent in
natural outdoor spaces on the language, communication and social skills of 2–11-year-old children.
Literature will be searched across seven databases and considered for inclusion against inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Potential implications of the review include informing public health practice
and policy for child development and education, informing priorities for speech, language, and
communication interventions, and providing directions for future international research.

The myriad beneﬁts that humans accrue from time spent in natural outdoor spaces are
well documented and include improved physical health, mental health and wellbeing, and
creativity [1–9]. There is also growing evidence documenting the numerous beneﬁts to child
development from spending time outdoors [10–13] including physical and mental health
impacts but in addition to these are indicative beneﬁts to children’s cognitive, academic
attainment, and physical activity levels [14–17], outcomes which are also documented
across systematic reviews of the literature [11,18–20]. Less referenced in the literature
are the impacts of nature on children’s language, communication and social development.
Early language and communication skills in particular are pivotal to children’s non-physical
development and life opportunities; they are essential to educational engagement and
achievement, social relationships and future employment prospects [21,22]. However, more

than 1.4 million children in England have Speech, language and communication needs
(SLCN) [23] and it is estimated that between 5% and 8% of all children in the UK have
early language difﬁculties, a ﬁgure that rises to over 20% for those growing up in low-
income households [24,25]. SLCN are also identiﬁed as the most common type of Special
Educational Need (SEN) in England, at 25.1% of pupils [26]. Currently there is no systematic
review of the impacts of nature on children’s language development although there is some
evidence to suggest the outdoor environment has positive impacts on children’s language
and communication [27] lexical diversity, and ﬂuency of language learning [28].

Yet, despite a growing evidence-base for the wide-reaching beneficial effects of nature
on child development, the amount of time children are spending outdoors is in rapid decline;
in the UK, today’s children are spending half the time playing outside than their parents
did [29], a trend echoed internationally [30]. Barriers such as parental concerns around
safety, access to natural green spaces (in particular inequality between urban and rural areas)
and children’s tendency towards screen play indoors, are reducing children’s contact with
the natural world around them [18,31,32]. Such barriers have been further exacerbated
by the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is clear evidence indicating that during this time
children around the world significantly reduced their outdoor engagement [33] and physical
activity levels [34,35], and increased their screen time [36] and sedentary behaviour [37,38].
Furthermore, although the effects of COVID-19 on children have been multifaceted, it is
less clear how the pandemic has impacted children’s speech and language development.
These impacts may not be fully realised for some time, although early evidence from primary
schools in England indicates children who started school in 2020 required additional support
with language and communication compared to previous years [39,40].

Understanding the impacts of the natural environment on children’s language, commu-
nication and social skills could provide a unique opportunity to consider nature as universal
public health intervention. Parents, educators, clinicians and policy makers require robust
evidence to help shape their decisions around prioritising children’s time outdoors. Signif-
icantly, the National Institute for Health Research [41] has recently called out for research
proposals exploring which interventions lead children and young people to spend more time
outdoors in ways that improve their health and reduce health inequalities. Quite clearly the
pressing demand for research in this area is growing in significance and priority.

The Current Study: The current study will address a gap in the evidence-base exploring
the effects of time spent in natural outdoor spaces on children’s language, communication
and social skills. While there are some individual studies exploring these impacts, there
has not as yet been a systematic approach to reviewing the literature on this topic. If
synthesized systematically, outcomes may have the potential to inﬂuence UK society’s
approach to prioritizing children’s time and space outdoors for the purposes of speech and
language interventions, outdoor education and public health.

Background:
The impacts of the outdoors on children’s language, communication, and social de-
velopment: There is increasing evidence that demonstrates the beneﬁts of nature to a
child’s language, communication and social development. For example, children use ﬁve
times more words when playing outdoors compared to indoors [42]. They have a greater
sense of wellbeing, higher self-esteem and conﬁdence and they laugh more [43]. Their
attainment in English SATs and language skills on school entry are signiﬁcantly higher [44].
Research by O’Brien [27] demonstrates speciﬁc improvements in children’s language and
communication skills, especially for children who do not have access to nature as part of
their everyday lives and makes deﬁnitive links between outdoor nature play and children’s
communication and social skills. Richardson & Murray [45] established correlations be-
tween outdoor nature play and an increase in children’s utterance quality. Research has
also demonstrated that natural environments inﬂuence social interactions between parents
and children by increasing connected, responsive communication [46].

The importance of language for education: It is widely recognized that speech, lan-
guage, and communication skills are central to children’s school readiness and ability to

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12038

3 of 14

engage with the educational curriculum [22,47]. At every stage of education children with
language difﬁculties fall behind their typically developing peers in academic achievement
at attainment, from the Early Years, through the primary years and into secondary years [21].
The Communication Trust [48] has estimated that in some parts of the United Kingdom
(UK), upwards of 50% of children are starting school with a SLCN. This prevalence has
been reported as high as 84% in some areas of deprivation [49]. Almost all children with
SLCN experience some difﬁculty with learning to read and write, placing them at increased
risk of poor school readiness and inability to access the national curriculum [50]. According
to Supporting Families in the Foundation [51], ‘children should start school healthy, happy,
communicative, sociable, curious, active and ready equipped for the next phase of life
and learning’. However, Ofsted [52] have reported that across the UK in 2014 only half
of all children reached a good level of development by the age of ﬁve. For some children
the picture was much worse, with over ﬁfty local authorities reporting less than a third
of children reached this level. The recent Bercow review found that in 2018 only 26% of
young children with SLCN made expected academic progress in the Early Years Foundation
Stage compared with 69% of all children, and only 15% of primary school pupils with
SLCN achieved the expected levels in reading, writing and mathematics at the end of their
primary school years compared with 61% of all children [23]. The impacts of poor language
and communication on children’s education are therefore signiﬁcant and long-term.

Outdoor provision across the childhood years: In children’s early years the provi-
sion of the outdoor environment is seen as a space where developmental needs may be
nurtured [53,54]. The Department for Education advocates for outdoor play as part of
non-statutory curriculum in the early years [55] and exploring the natural world is a key
early learning goal for children during these years [56]. It is recognised that throughout
these preschool years, children learn very much through play, and therefore much of their
outdoor engagements are play-based [56,57]. In contrast, we see less guidance across
the curriculum about outdoor learning as children begin their primary school years, and
instead greater emphasis is placed on the attainment of compulsory national curriculum
subjects. Outdoor engagement across the primary years is often curriculum-based, includ-
ing Physical Education but also core subject learning. Across the UK, the provision of
outdoor -based curriculum delivery is increasing with promising evidence for beneﬁcial
effects on children’s learning and wellbeing [58]. It appears therefore that the nature of
children’s engagement with the outdoors may change over time in-line with school stages
and developmental competencies, with less structured, play-based and developmental pro-
vision in the early years, and more structured curriculum-based provision in the primary
years. However, evidence for the comparative effects of different types of provision on
language and social outcomes is scarce, and it is also unclear for which age range nature
has the most beneﬁcial effects.

The impacts of limited outdoor engagement: Contributing to poor developmental
outcomes for children are factors such as the amount of indoor time children are increasingly
experiencing [12], the amount of screen time now accessed by young children [59], and of
primary importance to this study is research relating to a child’s contact with the natural
world [60]. A government funded survey in England [61] suggests children spend less
time outdoors than prison inmates. They also found that in the 12 months leading up
to the study, more than one in nine children had not set foot in a forest, on a beach or
any other natural environment. The survey showed that families in England with low
socio-economic status (SES), and minority ethnic households were markedly less likely
than white children and those from higher income households to visit urban or rural wild
places. These sub-groups are among others referred to in the literature that indicate speciﬁc
impacts of time spent in natural outdoor spaces to children. Boys spend more time outdoors
on average than girls, the type of outdoor activity (structured vs. unstructured) can result
in differing beneﬁts, and higher amounts of outdoor time effect greater impacts [62,63]. It
has also been suggested that there are geographic considerations, with green spaces around
a child’s residence resulting in higher performance IQ and global IQ, yet this is not the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12038

case for blue spaces (beaches) [64,65]. These sub-groups require attention in this review,
in order to capitalize on the full breadth of relevant literature but also to inform future
research in this area. The potential consequences are far reaching. Furthermore, rise of
obesity, rickets and asthma and decline in cardio-respiratory ﬁtness are well documented.
Richard Louv in his book ‘Last Child in the Woods’ [12] links the indoor life to an increase
in attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder and other mental ill-health. A report by Malone
and Waite [66] found that children having fewer opportunities to explore their surrounding
natural environment was hampering their social skills as well as risking stiﬂing their long-
term physical, emotional development, and wellbeing. Of additional concern, as mentioned
above is the considerable body of research documenting the amount of screen time now
accessed by young children and its links to developmental delay [67].

Potential implications of the review: While these publications and those like them are
crucial, there has not been the type of systematic evidence synthesis central to deﬁnitively
supporting a change in behaviour. An exploration of the speciﬁc ways in which nature play
inﬂuences a child’s communication development is essential. If outdoor spaces do have a
positive impact on aspects of a child’s communication, then these opportunities can be built
into school curriculum and thereby promote school readiness, engagement and overall
attainment. They will also serve as initiative for new speech and language interventions.
Additionally, this review has the potential to support the development of some of the
most vulnerable children and families in our society, improving their happiness, health
and well-being whilst also helping them to communicate. The systematic review has the
potential to inform parents and schools of the impact of outdoor play, thereby encouraging
local communities to development of forest school programmes and identify and cultivate
wild spaces to facilitate outdoor play. Furthermore, evidence from a study such as this
could support the government when considering legislation to ensure all children have
access to nature.

2. Materials and Methods

Review Question: This systematic review protocol outlines the procedures for a

literature review that is intended to answer the question:

What are the impacts on children’s language, communication and social skills from

time spent in natural outdoor spaces?

The review will use the following deﬁnitions of language, communication and social
skills in line with universal deﬁnitions within speech and language therapy: “Language
skills” refers to a child’s receptive ability to understand words and sentences and expres-
sively to use vocabulary and grammar; “Communication skills” refers to a child’s ability
to use their language in conjunction with non-verbal communication skills such as eye
contact, gesture and facial expression to express their thoughts and needs; and “Social
skills” refers to a child’s ability to engage and maintain positive interactions with adults
and other children.

This systematic review will include qualitative and quantitative data sources. The
SPIDER tool for generating research questions offers a systematic review strategy for
mixed-methods research studies [68] and as such will be applied to this review.

The components are in Table 1:

Mixed Methods

Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
Protocols [69] guidelines will be used for this systematic review protocol. Best practice
guidance by Covidence [70] supports a systematic review approach for answering this
research question. An overview of the methodology and methods used is provided in the
following sections.

Eligibility Criteria: The international peer-reviewed literature in this systematic re-
view will be limited to literature published between 2010–2022, which has been published
in English. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies will be considered in-
cluding randomised controlled trials (RCTs), case–control, cross-sectional, cohort and case
studies. Chapters in books, Ph.D. theses, conference proceedings and presentations will
not be included. Papers must present original data or review other empirical studies.

Inclusion Criteria: This systematic review is focused on the language, communication
and social impacts for children from time spent in natural outdoor spaces. Included studies
must report on:
•
•

Population: Children 2–11 years.
Spaces: outdoor areas with green space (natural vegetation such as plants, grass or
trees—publicly available or forest school designated areas of school grounds) or blue
spaces (water, sea, lake). NB studies that use indoor play as a comparator to outdoor
play will be included but this is not essential to inclusion.
Activities: Independent or group-based activities which may include physical activity,
unstructured nature play, structured nature-based activities (crafting or gardening)
or outdoor learning activities within educational settings (class lessons conducted
in the outdoors). Outdoor adventure education programmes will also be included.
Structured activities/outdoor interventions that speciﬁcally target speech, language
and communication skills will also be accepted.
Skills: studies must refer to aspects of a child’s language and communication develop-
ment which includes parent–child interaction and social interaction. They may report on
normally developing or delayed/disordered (language/communication) population.

•

•

Exclusion Criteria: Studies that do not fulﬁl all the inclusion criteria will be removed

from the review.

Speciﬁc exclusion criteria:

•
•
•
•

Population: Children over 11 and adults;
Spaces: sports ﬁelds or courts;
Activities: sports coaching in the outdoors;
Skills: studies that reference cognitive skills and other health impacts of nature but not
language, communication and social skills.

Information Sources: Academic searches will be conducted using the following elec-

tronic databases:

(1) Education Research Information Centre (ERIC);
(2) CINAHL;
(3) EMBASE;
(4) Medline;
(5) PsychINFO;

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12038

(6) The Cochrane Library;
(7) GreenFILE.

Grey literature will be accessed through Google and Google Scholar (ﬁrst 100 hits)
and OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu, accessed on 9 January 2022). Relevant organisations,
practitioners and researchers in the ﬁeld will also be contacted to obtain information.

Search Strategy: Boolean operators will be used to focus the search and improve the
quality, relevance and speciﬁcity of research identiﬁed. The systematic literature searching
technique known as ‘pearl growing’ (also known as citation mining and snowballing) will
be applied to retrieve further relevant articles.

An interdisciplinary team with a diverse range of expertise (including specialisation
in speech, language and communication disorders, child psychology and outdoor learning)
will be consulted in order to ensure an exhaustive and relevant search strategy. System-
atic reviews and publications will be reviewed for key words and related terms will be
considered. The strategy will be tested and reﬁned until ﬁnalised and will be adapted as
appropriate for each database.

3. Study Records

Data Management: Throughout the review process the literature management soft-
ware Mendeley Desktop © will be used to manage records and data. Initial screening
decisions will be made using Rayyan software [71].

Selection Process: In the ﬁrst stage of the review, the lead researcher (SS) will initially
screen the titles and abstracts of the articles identiﬁed for eligibility according to the criteria
for the review. Non-English language papers, duplicate articles and articles identiﬁed as in-
appropriate according to the criteria of the review will be excluded. A second reviewer (JC)
will independently screen 10% of titles and abstracts. Any discrepancies will be discussed,
and a third reviewer (SM) will be brought in if necessary to resolve any disagreements.

In the second stage of the review, two reviewers will independently read the full text
of all records which meet the eligibility criteria. Again, a third reviewer will be involved
for discussion where there are disagreements between reviewers regarding eligibility of
particular studies.

Risk of Bias in Individual Studies: The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Check-
lists [72] will be used to assess risk of bias in the eligible studies. These cover both quantita-
tive and qualitative studies. Two researchers will assess the articles against the assessment
tools. The ﬁrst reviewer will apply them to all included studies, and a second reviewer will
independently assess risk of bias for 10% of studies to ensure consistency. Differing scores
will be discussed and resolved with a third researcher. The score will be used to discuss the
quality of the article only and not for inclusion or exclusion purposes.

Data Collection Process: The data captured from the eligible studies will be inputted
into a bespoke Excel spreadsheet. In the event that information required is not available
from the full text, the corresponding authors will be contacted. Communication with all
external researchers will be consistent in terms of invitations to contribute and follow-up.

Data Items: Information in the Excel datasheet will be as follows:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Study: Citation, author, date of publication, journal.
Research objectives.
Study design: methodology and methods.
Population characteristics: age, sex, sample size, nationality of participants.
Research space: school, garden, park, woodland.
Activity: unstructured/structured nature play, craft, horticulture, walk, outdoor lesson.

•

Outcomes related to (1) Language, inc. grammar and syntax; (2) Communication, inc
parent child interaction; (3) Social skills.

• Main ﬁndings.
•

Source of funding and potential conﬂicts of interest.

Outcomes and Prioritisation: Primary outcomes will include all impacts of language,

communication and social skills from time spent in natural outdoor spaces.

Outcomes will include but are not limited to:

•
•

•
•
•

Language: vocabulary; syntax; grammar; mean length of utterance.
Communication and social skills: eye contact; facial expression; initiation of conversa-
tional turn; communicative responses; gesture.
Communicative intent: questions; requests; comments; directions; affirmations; negations.
Play: developmental level; use of imagination; interactive.
Parent–child interaction: connectedness; responsiveness.

Additional Outcomes: As mentioned in the inclusion criteria, there may be studies
that use play in indoor spaces as a comparator to outdoor spaces. These data may generate
additional outcomes unrelated to those prioritised above.

Data Synthesis: Research linking nature and children’s health is diverse in deﬁnitions,
methodology and design and for that reason it may be challenging to synthesise data from
included studies.

It will be the heterogeneity of included studies that determines the approach to data
synthesis in this systematic review. For homogenous studies, where populations, activities,
outcomes and designs are sufficiently similar to make analyses appropriate, a meta-synthesis
will be used to combine qualitative data and a meta-analysis for quantitative data. Statistical
heterogeneity will be explored through use of appropriate statistics such as I2.

For studies of a heterogeneous nature a narrative synthesis will be used, with greater
emphasis given to studies with a lower risk of bias and rigorous data collection/analysis
approaches. This narrative synthesis will draw on the techniques of thematic analysis to
categorise emergent and recurring themes within and between transcripts.

If the type and amount of data are available, a sub-group analysis will be conducted

to investigate differential associations and/or effects of the following:

1.

2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Differences by academic key stage: Early Years (EYFS) ages 2–5 years; and Key Stages
1 and 2 ages 5–11 years. Differences by gender.
Differences by SES.
Differences by ethnic group.
Differences by activity (structured vs. unstructured).
Differences by duration.
Differences by Type of natural outdoor space, e.g., green vs. blue, urban vs. rural.

A summary of studies will be combined into a single logic model developed by two
researchers, to allow comparison and examination of how different data types relate to
each other and to enable readers to identify gaps for future research.

Conﬁdence in Cumulative Evidence: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation [73] framework will be used to assess conﬁdence in the
evidence across studies at an outcome level.

4. Discussion

This systematic review protocol presents a clear and reproducible procedure for
synthesising research currently available documenting language, communication and
social impacts for children from time spent in nature. This proposed review will represent
landmark research to accumulate and synthesise any associations between children’s
communication abilities and time spent outdoors. The ﬁndings will provide a much-
needed audit of research quality in this area, reducing risk of bias in individual studies.
Additionally, it will bring together initiatives and ﬁndings from a wide range of contexts,
cultures and educational and health intervention approaches, providing an international

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12038

10 of 14

audit in this important ﬁeld. It will also provide a much-needed evaluation of the deﬁnitions
and impact of differing outdoor activities, thereby providing a foundation and framework
for future research and the development of outdoor interventions.

As stated at the outset of this protocol, there are strong indications in the literature that
time spent in natural outdoor spaces has positive impacts on many areas involved in the
development of speech, language and communication skills. Attention and listening, play,
lexical diversity and even the parent child interaction itself are reported to be enhanced in
outdoor contexts, all of which contribute signiﬁcantly to children’s communicative capabil-
ities. It appears that the immersive environment offered by natural outdoor spaces invites
the exploration, creativity and physical challenge that supports the development of these
fundamentally important aspects of children’s health. It is evident that this is an area that
requires attention, both in terms of a thorough examination of research already available
but it is also essential that high quality studies are designed and undertaken to explore
in detail the mechanisms involved. As such speech and language therapists will have the
knowledge and tools to develop nature-based interventions and potentially the ability to
make a simple prescription for increased time spent outdoors. Thus, proving beneﬁcial to
all children but particularly for those with speech, language and communication needs.

The systematic review is also vitally important when considering equality, diversity
and inclusion. As mentioned beforehand there are inequalities in access to natural outdoor
spaces. Children from low socio-economic families and black, Asian and minority ethnic
families are markedly less likely to spend time outdoors than middle income families.
Bearing in mind children from low socio-economic groups are also more likely to present
with speech, language and communication difﬁculties [74], this affects a group of doubly
disadvantaged children for whom greater access to natural outdoor spaces may impact in
signiﬁcant ways on their speech, language and communication development.

This intersectionality of disadvantage in terms of discrimination and privilege needs
to be at the forefront of research in this ﬁeld. The systematic review will need to consider
the populations involved in these types of nature-based studies as it is likely children at the
intersection of disadvantage are not represented in the groups involved in research. If this is
a ﬁnding within the review it will support the development of programmes designed to in-
clude the children that will most beneﬁt from research, outcomes and future interventions.
The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022316064)—the international
prospective register of systematic reviews. In line with PROSPERO priorities which are
focused on health-related outcomes, it is the intention of the proposed review to explore the
evidence available to inform evidence-based practice in Speech and Language Therapy and
support the development of nature-based interventions for the beneﬁt of children’s health.
While the systematic review process will enable the synthesis of high-quality evidence, it
does not consider two important aspects of the Evidence Based Practice triangle (ASHA
n.d): that of clinical expertise/expert opinion and client/patient/caregiver perspectives.
The outcomes of the review will need to be integrated with clinical expertise and patient
perspectives when used to inform practice.

Global consensus amongst educators, parents, paediatricians, and our mental health
is that children have been the invisible casualties of the COVID-19
profession,
pandemic [75–79]. This cohort have been severely impacted by lockdowns, school disrup-
tions, teacher/student absenteeism and loss of social interaction, for instance. COVID-19
has affected children’s time spent outside and the documentation is amassing of reduced
participation in community and sporting activities during the pandemic for our young [80].
Unquestionably, the future implications of the pandemic on children remains largely un-
certain. This cohort may well become the collateral damage of the pandemic [80], and as
Dickson and Gray [81] (p. 2) report for our young “their costs are very real, now and into
the future. Not just their lost opportunities, but also as they bear the brunt of the debt from
national economic support packages, and learn to adapt, mitigate, and manage climate
change”. In short, the burdens confronting the younger generation as a result of COVID-19
are both tangible and real and require our urgent attention.

There are a number of additional limitations to this proposed systematic review.
Valuable anecdotal perspectives may be lost due to the limitation on grey literature and
case studies. The limitation on papers published in languages other than English may limit
the scope of this systematic review and cause language bias. The exclusion of children over
the age of 11 may limit a broader understanding of the impact of natural outdoor spaces on
older children. It is also acknowledged that while the search terms indicated above cover
an exhaustive range of the terms used in articles relating to children’s language skills and
the outdoor context, it is possible that the selected criteria miss other signiﬁcant key terms
related to the topic area.

There may be also limitations encountered due to the wide range of methods and
deﬁnitions associated with research in this area. It is hoped that the differing approaches
to data synthesis will accommodate this heterogeneity in evidence. Outcomes will form
a large part of the discussion and establish areas for future research, and the initiative of
evidence based therapeutic interventions.

5. Conclusions

The systematic review set out in this paper will involve a thorough exploration of
the research documenting language and communication outcomes for children from time
spent in nature. Furthermore, it will provide deﬁnitions of nature-based activities and
communication-based terminology, thereby guiding methods and easing synthesis and
interpretation of nature play research going forward. Continuing gaps in our knowledge
will inform future research and the design of those research activities.

The authors anticipate the systematic review will make a signiﬁcant contribution to
our understanding of this dimension of health and health inequality impacts of being
outdoors for children, in line with NIHR research priorities. Research impact is potentially
far reaching. Public health messages to parents describing the communicative beneﬁts of
nature play with their children, with speciﬁc information on type of play activity, nature
space and dosage. Correspondingly, the ﬁndings of this review—particularly once the
COVID-19 pandemic has abated—will assist in directing and informing future debate about
the virtues of spending more time outdoors in natural environments. Against this backdrop,
our review has the ability to inform policy makers, researchers, educators, clinicians and
stakeholders within the ﬁelds of education, speech and language therapy. Finally, it will
signiﬁcantly contribute to key stakeholders’ ongoing dialogue around how to use natural
environments to maximise communicative outcomes for all children.
