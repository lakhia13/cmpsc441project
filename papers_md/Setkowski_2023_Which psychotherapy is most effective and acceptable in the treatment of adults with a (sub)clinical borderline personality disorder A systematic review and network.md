Abstract

A broad range of psychotherapies have been proposed and evaluated in the treatment of bor-
derline personality disorder (BPD), but the question which specific type of psychotherapy is
most effective remains unanswered. In this study, two network meta-analyses (NMAs) were
conducted investigating the comparative effectiveness of psychotherapies on (1) BPD severity
and (2) suicidal behaviour (combined rate). Study drop-out was included as a secondary out-
come. Six databases were searched until 21 January 2022, including RCTs on the efficacy of
any psychotherapy in adults (⩾18 years) with a diagnosis of (sub)clinical BPD. Data were
extracted using a predefined table format. PROSPERO ID:CRD42020175411.
In our
study, a total of 43 studies (N = 3273) were included. We found significant differences between
several active comparisons in the treatment of (sub)clinical BPD, however, these findings were
based on very few trials and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Some therapies were
more efficacious compared to GT or TAU. Furthermore, some treatments more than halved
the risk of attempted suicide and committed suicide (combined rate), reporting RRs around
0.5 or lower, however, these RRs were not statistically significantly better compared to other
therapies or to TAU. Study drop-out significantly differed between some treatments. In
conclusion, no single treatment seems to be the best choice to treat people with BPD com-
pared to other treatments. Nevertheless, psychotherapies for BPD are perceived as first-line
treatments, and should therefore be investigated further on their long-term effectiveness, pref-
erably in head-to-head trials. DBT was the best connected treatment, providing solid evidence
of its effectiveness.

Introduction

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterised by severe functional impairments, high
levels of distress, and a high risk of suicide (Leichsenring, Leibing, Kruse, New, & Leweke,
2011; Skodol et al., 2002). Although research has found that suicide occurs in up to 10% of
all people diagnosed with BPD (APA, 2001; Black, Blum, Pfohl, & Hale, 2004), lower rates
have been reported (Gunderson et al., 2011; Temes, Frankenburg, Fitzmaurice, & Zanarini,
2019; Zanarini, Frankenburg, Reich, & Fitzmaurice, 2012), suggesting that these percentages
might fluctuate across studies (Links, Boursiquot, & Links, 2021). The prevalence rate for
attempted suicide, however, is much larger ranging from 55 to 85% (Links, Boursiquot, &
Links, 2021). Although most people with BPD experience a high burden of disease, about
85% achieve remission (e.g. not fulfilling DSM-criteria) within 10 years (Gunderson et al.,
2011; Zanarini et al., 2007). Evidence-based psychological treatments are perceived as first-line
treatments for persons with BPD (Cristea et al., 2017; Oud, Arntz, Hermens, Verhoef, &
Kendall, 2018; Storebo et al., 2020), although not one specific treatment is being favoured
over the others. There is still an ongoing debate about the comparative efficacy of different
types of treatments for adults with BPD.

Kim Setkowski et al.

So far, a few studies have provided meta-analytic evidence on the
efficacy of psychotherapies for BPD. Firstly, a meta-analysis from
2017 (Cristea et al., 2017) investigated the efficacy of stand-alone
therapies and add-on designs in the treatment of people with
BPD, finding a significant improvement of BPD severity (g = 0.35)
compared to TAU. They also found a significant decrease of suicide
(attempts) and suicidal ideation (g = 0.41). A second review (Oud
et al., 2018), examined the effectiveness of four BPD-specific treat-
ments, finding a moderate significant effect size on BPD severity
(d = 0.59) when compared to TAU. Their results on suicidal behav-
iour were inconclusive. A Cochrane review (Storebo et al., 2020) also
found beneficial effects for various psychotherapies on BPD (d =
0.52) after pooling them together vis-á-vis TAU. They also found
beneficial effects for various types of psychotherapies on suicide
(attempts) RR = 0.27, 95% CI (0.11–0.67) compared to TAU.
Recently, another meta-analysis was published (Stoffers-Winterling
et al., 2022), evaluating the effects of stand-alone and add-on ther-
apies for BPD. They found significant results for DBT (d = 0.54)
and MBT (RR = 0.51) on self-harm v. TAU. A small, but significant
effect for MBT on suicide-related outcomes was found (RR = 0.10).
However, the authors did not make any comparisons among active
treatments, nor were they able to include other specialised treat-
ments such as ST and TFP, due to a lack of available trials. Still
another meta-analysis (Rameckers et al., 2021) analysed pre-post
changes of all design types, allowing comparisons of all treatments.
ST was superior and TAU inferior to the average effect of all studies
on BPD-severity. As to suicidality, TAU and CTBE were inferior,
whereas ST and MBT were superior to the average treatment effect.
We also noticed important discrepancies in the conclusions of all
five reviews (Cristea et al., 2017; Oud et al., 2018; Rameckers
et al., 2021; Stoffers-Winterling et al., 2022; Storebo et al., 2020).
Despite the fact that these papers focus on a similar topic and do
seem to have established the same PICO, they tend to differ in
terms of their aims and scope, their methodological approach, and
the trials they included.

There is not enough research to answer the question if one spe-
cific form of psychotherapy is more effective in treating BPD com-
pared to others (Ellison, 2020; Leichsenring et al., 2011; Yeomans,
Kenneth, & Meehan, 2012), because there are very few trials that
compare two or more treatment types directly. Long-term out-
comes of psychotherapies have also not yet been examined in a net-
work meta-analysis (NMA). Two conventional meta-analyses (Oud
et al., 2018; Storebo et al., 2020) are the only papers including
head-to-head-trials, but both papers were not able to fully exploit
the data, and compare different sets of psychotherapies that have
not been compared directly in randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) before. An NMA is a better approach than conventional
meta-analyses, because it introduces a rank ordering in the selected
psychotherapies, pooling evidence from both direct, and indirect
comparisons (Rouse, Chaimani, & Li, 2017).

This is the first study to update previous reviews (Cristea et al.,
2017; Oud et al., 2018; Storebo et al., 2020) by including add-
itional RCTs and to elucidate the comparative efficacy of psy-
chotherapies
network
meta-analyses (NMAs). In this paper, we also examined study
drop-out as a secondary outcome measure.

Methods

We followed PRISMA guidelines
(Page et al., 2021) and
PRISMA-NMA (Hutton et al., 2015) in conducting and reporting
this systematic review and NMA.

Study protocol and search strategy

(PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, Scopus,

PROSPERO ID: CRD42020175411. Changes to the protocol are
described in online Supplementary Table S1. Six electronic data-
bases
the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science) were
systematically searched from inception to the 21th of January
2022 (online Supplementary Table S1). We included papers writ-
ten in English, Dutch, Greek and German according to the lan-
guages spoken by the authors.

Study selection

The records were imported into Covidence Systematic Review
Software for the screening process. After removal of duplicates,
two independent assessors (KS and CP) screened the titles and
abstracts. Both assessors conducted a full-text review of
the
remaining studies. The reference lists of studies included in the
full-text review were also searched for relevant articles. In case
of disagreement, consensus was reached by discussion with a
third researcher (WvB).

Eligibility criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they used an RCT design test-
ing the efficacy of psychotherapy, and if their study population
consisted of adults (mean age of ⩾ 18 years) with a primary diag-
nosis of (sub)clinical BPD, assessed with a structured clinical
interview according to ICD or DSM criteria. Comorbid disorders
were not excluded, as long as studies primarily included adults
with BPD. To meet the homogeneity assumption of the NMA,
only studies performed in an outpatient setting were included.
Web-based interventions were therefore not included in our
study. Similar as to (Oud et al., 2018), we aimed to exclude inter-
ventions that did not have the potential to be delivered as a ‘com-
plete therapy’ for people with BPD, but as an adjunct treatment
instead, such as Systems Training for Emotional Predictability
and Problem Solving, Emotion Regulation Training, or adjunctive
Emotion Regulation Group Therapy.

Definition of psychotherapy

Given the diversity of therapy orientations, we used an inclusive
approach in selecting the psychotherapy and control conditions,
by using the following definition: A treatment that is (1) based
on psychological principles, (2) involves a trained therapist and
a patient who is seeking help for a mental disorder (in this case
BPD), problem, or complaint, (3) is intended by the therapist to
be remedial
for this disorder, problem, or complaint of the
patient, and (4) is adapted or individualised for the particular
patient and his or her disorder, problem, or complaint
(Wampold, & Imel, 2015, p. 37).

Interventions

Based on the expertise from one of the co-authors (AA), each spe-
cialised psychotherapy was classified into separate categories. The
procedure of categorising each intervention in a separate node, is
in online Supplementary Table S2.
described in more detail
A description of each type of treatment is presented in Table 1.

Nodes

Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)

Description

In CBT, therapists focus on patients’ dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs and their impact on current behaviour. This
treatment is aimed at exploring, challenging and restructuring patients’ dysfunctional beliefs. In addition to this
cognitive work, behaviour therapy methods can be added to change dysfunctional behaviours. Teaching patients new
methods of coping with stressful situations is an example of this. CBT involves homework assignments.

Community Treatment by Experts
(CTBE)

CTBE is perceived as a special form of TAU [i.e. psychotherapy-as-usual provided by trained community experts with
experience in treating people with BPD and/or personality disorders (PD)].

Dialectical Behaviour Therapy
(DBT)

Generic Treatments for BPD (GT)

Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)

Mentalisation-Based Treatment
(MBT)

DBT was developed by Marsha Linehan and is based on the premise that emotional hyperreactivity and the use of
dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies are central to BPD. DBT makes use of cognitive, behavioural and
problem-solving interventions, including psychoeducation, problem solving and acceptance strategies, to help
patients using more functional emotion regulation strategies. A dialectical stance is taken with respect to the need for
change on the one hand, and the need for acceptance on the other hand. DBT also focuses on enhancing patients’
motivation and engagement in treatment to prevent dropout. Treatment includes group skills training, individual
therapy, and telephone contact (if needed).

GPM, SCM, CCT, and STM are classified as generic treatments for BPD. These interventions are either specifically
developed for BPD, based on a model globally describing important developmental- and sustaining factors of BPD, or
based on evidence based sophisticated forms of psychotherapy, adapted to BPD (e.g. CCT). All these treatments
follow a global protocol, defining and optimising the therapeutic relationship, the techniques applied, and phases of
treatment. In general, approach and technique allow a personalisation based on individual needs of the patient.
(Thus, both the model and the techniques are less specific than those of specialised therapies, such as DBT, MBT, ST,
and TFP, but more specific than general treatment approaches). Therapy needs to be delivered by experts in BPD
treatment.

Therapy is an adaptation of IPT (originally developed to treat major depression), whereby BPD is treated as a
mood-inflicted disorder (such as dysthymic disorder) but with outburst of anger. As with IPT for depression, the focus
is on interpersonal problems, with therapists helping patients to resolve them in a nondirective way. For IPT-BPD,
length of treatment is prolonged. Therapy includes telephone contact with a clinician to prevent crises and improve
therapeutic alliance, and psychoeducation for family members of patients.

MBT, developed by Anthony Bateman and Peter Fonagy, is focused on understanding the process of one’s own, and
others’ actions in terms of mental states (such as beliefs and intentions). MBT is based on a psychoanalytic model
with cognitive therapeutic elements, aiming to stimulate patients to mentalise, and to develop more adaptive
interpersonal behaviours. Psychoeducation is delivered. Attachment theory is explicitly taken into account in
therapeutic attitude and techniques. Focus of treatment is the relationship with the therapist and other people,
including other patients when a group format is used, whereby therapists seek to improve a patients’ capacity to
mentalise, as well as to identify their affective experience. Mentalising functional analysis, stop-stand-and-rewind
techniques are used during treatment.

Mixed therapeutic techniques
(mixed)

Psychotherapies were classified within the mixed category, if they used a combination multiple techniques from
already existing interventions, such as ST, DBT, MBT or PDP.

Psychodynamic Psychotherapy
(PDP)

Schema Therapy (ST)

Transference-Focused Therapy
(TFP)

PDP primarily focuses on improving the patients’ understanding, awareness, and insight about (unconscious)
intrapsychic conflicts and their interpersonal consequences. Therapists focus on patients’ childhood experiences,
historical relationships, and the impact these have on patients’ present intra- and interpersonal functioning.
Therapists try to strengthen patients’ self image and self-reflective behaviour, and focus on maturation of
maladaptive defence- and coping strategies. Elements of emotion regulation, identification of dysfunctional impulses,
and reflecting on self- and others behaviour are also included.
This category includes different forms of PDP, ranging from primarily focusing of increasing awareness of intrapsychic
conflicts with therapists taking a neutral stance, to forms where the therapist is more supportive and more focused
on encouraging the development of mature forms of defence mechanisms and relationships. However, the purely
supportive forms are not included here, but with the Generic Treatments. Thus, all PDP forms make use of
clarification, confrontation and interpretation as interventions.

ST is an integrative therapy in a cognitive framework developed by Jeffrey Young, that works with schema modes
(patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving). Schema modes result from activation of dysfunctional schemas and
represent the specific states patients can be in. Dysfunctional schemas are theorised to result from early experiences
during which core emotional needs were not met. Therapists aim to reduce dysfunctional schema modes and
increase constructive ones. ST primarily uses cognitive, experiential and behavioural interventions. The therapeutic
relationship offers corrective experiences via ‘limited reparenting’. Psychoeducation and processing of adverse
childhood experiences that lie at the root of the development of dysfunctional schemas are important components.

TFP has been developed by Otto Kernberg as an adaptation of psychodynamic psychotherapy suitable for BPD.
According to Kernberg, the BPD core deficit is the person’s disordered and incoherent mental representations of self
and others. These representations are ‘split’, or organised in all-positive or all-negative parts (polarity), whilst the
patient is not aware of this splitting. This splitting experience makes it difficult for someone to regulate emotions and
behaviours properly. The manifestation of borderline pathology within the therapeutic relationship is explored with
among other techniques confrontation and interpretation. Thus the therapists try to reduce the splitting of
representations, pointing out conflicting elements of the patients’ views of self or others, in order to achieve more
realistic views. The focus of TFP is primarily on the here and now, and not on the patient’s past.

Primary and secondary outcome measures

The primary outcomes were (1) overall BPD severity and (2) sui-
cidal behaviour defined as the combined rate of suicide attempts
(i.e. reported by participants via questionnaires or during inter-
views) and death by suicide (i.e. identified from medical records).
Effect sizes were based on the number of participants in the inter-
vention and control condition who had engaged in suicidal
behaviour. We accepted any validated clinician or self-rated
instrument for overall BPD severity. If a study used more than
one scale, we chose the scale that was most frequently used by
other included studies. In case overall BPD severity was not mea-
sured, single BPD symptoms were extracted, assessed with a valid
clinician or self-rated instrument. If trials measured more than
one single BPD symptom, we selected those that were measured
by most included studies, since it is not possible to use composite
scores in NMAs. Study drop-out was measured as a secondary
outcome and operationalised as study drop-out for any reason,
and not as treatment drop-out, given that the latter one is often
defined differently across trials, making it difficult to statistically
pool and interpret the results.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Risk of bias (RoB) for all trials was assessed independently by two
assessors (KS and CP) using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias
tool 2.0 for randomised trials (Higgins et al., 2019). We reported
the overall RoB score for both outcomes separately in the online
Supplementary Table S3 as well. The data were independently
extracted by the two assessors (KS & CP). If reported, we
extracted the data from the intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) in
each included study.

Data analysis

In this study, two NMAs were conducted. The first NMA focused
on examining the comparative efficacy for psychotherapies on
BPD symptom severity, while the second NMA aimed at suicidal
behaviour. Study drop-out was included as a secondary outcome.
Not all eligible studies (N = 43) were included in both NMAs,
because not all RCTs measured both primary outcomes simultan-
eously within their trial. For continuous outcomes, standardised
mean difference (SMD) was calculated between each of the con-
trasts based on mean, S.D. and number of participants for the con-
ditions. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as Relative Risks
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RRs for suicidal
behaviour were calculated as a measure of ratio of the probability
of participants engaging in suicidal behaviour. For study drop-
out, RRs was calculated as a measure of ratio of the probability
of events.

Firstly, we conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analyses
for every treatment comparison, given the expected clinical and
methodological heterogeneity of treatment effects between stud-
ies. We calculated the I2 statistic as an indicator of heterogeneity
(%) with 95% CIs. Publication bias was assessed by Egger’s test to
investigate the asymmetry of funnel plot. To assess the overall
publication bias on the network, we used comparison-adjusted
funnel plots to investigate whether biases of the results from active
treatments comparing with control conditions (TAU) existed.

Secondly, we implemented NMA using the contrast-based,
random-effects multivariate meta-analysis model (Salanti, 2012;
White, Barrett, Jackson, & Higgins, 2012). We made graphical

illustrations of
the network evidence base by network plots
(Chaimani, Higgins, Mavridis, Spyridonos, & Salanti, 2013). We
conducted synthesis analyses using the NMA model for the com-
parative efficacy and study drop-out. Comparative SMDs and RRs
were reported with their 95% CIs and 95% prediction intervals
(PrI). The PrI illustrates the prediction interval covering the
true treatment effect in a future study with 95% probability. To
evaluate influences of individual comparisons for the entire net-
work, contribution plots were developed. To assess the ranking
of the treatments, we used the surface under the cumulative rank-
ing curve (SUCRA) (Salanti, Ades, & Ioannidis, 2011). The larger
the surface below the SUCRA, the more efficacious the treatment
will be. SUCRA would be 1 when a treatment is certain to be the
best, and 0 when a treatment is certain to be the worst.

To examine the transitivity assumption, we conducted the
inconsistency tests (Rouse et al., 2017). The
local and global
local inconsistency tests correspond to a loop specific approach
that investigates local inconsistency, and we conducted the incon-
sistency test for all the triangular or quadratic loops in the net-
work (Bucher, Guyatt, Griffith, & Walter, 1997). Besides, the
global
test using the
design-by-treatment interaction model of Higgins et al. (Higgins
et al. 2012).

is a goodness-of-fit

inconsistency test

We conducted a series of five sensitivity analyses to examine
the robustness of the results: (1) one including studies using inter-
ventions with all four DBT components (categorised as ‘full
DBT’), (2) another one only including trials reporting on suicides
and suicide attempts, and (3) one analysis only including studies
reporting overall BPD severity. Lastly, (4) a sensitivity analysis
including studies only categorised as low RoB, (5) and one sensi-
tivity analysis only including studies using an individual + group
format. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version
16, and mvmeta (White, 2011; White et al., 2012), network
packages (White, 2015), network graphs (Chaimani & Salanti,
2015), and heterogi module (Orsini, Bottai, Higgins, & Buchan,
2006).

Results

Selection, inclusion and characteristics of studies

A total of 11.345 records were identified through database searching
(Fig. 1). After removal of duplicates 5477 unique titles were inde-
pendently screened. We retrieved 212 full-text papers for further
consideration and excluded 157 studies, resulting in a total of 55
papers (N = 4044). The PRISMA flowchart is illustrated in Fig. 1.
A total of eight studies were excluded because their study arms
were classified into the same node (Chanen et al., 2022; Elices
et al., 2016; Farrés et al., 2019; Harned, Korslund, & Linehan,
2014; Laursen et al., 2021; Linehan et al., 2015; Smits et al.,
2020; Wolf et al., 2011). Two studies (Gleeson et al., 2012;
Robinson et al., 2016) were excluded because their study arm(s)
were primarily focused on a different psychiatric disorder, such
as eating disorders and psychosis. One study (Feliu-Soler et al.,
2017) was excluded because their intervention was developed as

a
(Wampold, & Imel, 2015, p. 37). We also removed one pilot
study (Morton, Snowdon, Gopold, & Guymer, 2012), because
their intervention was not delivered as a full course treatment,
but rather as a brief-adjunct intervention, only meant to be pro-
vided as an addition to a current treatment (i.e. Gratz et al., 2006).
This resulted in a total of 43 studies (n = 3273), including eleven

Bellino, 2020; Carlyle et al., 2020; Crawford et al., 2020; Farrell,
Shaw, & Webber, 2009; Jorgensen et al., 2013; Koons et al.,
2001; Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991;
Stanley, 2017; Weinberg, Gunderson, Hennen, & Cutter, 2006).
Figure 1 shows these 43 RCTs were included in the statistical
analyses (N = 3273).

The RCTs (n = 43) were published between 1991 and 2020.
Sample sizes ranged from 19 to 200 participants per trial.
A total of 2630 participants were female (80.4%). The mean age
of participants ranged from 20.4–45.7 years.

Thirteen studies used an individual format and six studies
delivered their treatment as a group format. The majority of stud-
ies combined both formats (n = 23). Most interventions were
delivered face-to-face (n = 34), but nine studies added phone
coaching to their face-to-face treatments. The study of Majdara
et al. (2019) used different formats for each study arm: interven-
tion was delivered in individual format, and the control condition
was executed in group format. The number of sessions ranged
widely from 3 sessions to a maximum of 312 sessions (median
= 52.0). If studies reported a range for number of sessions, we
used the highest number to calculate the median. One study
did not report the number of sessions, but they delivered the
intervention under study 5 days a week, for a total duration of
390 days (Laurenssen et al., 2018). The mean duration of all treat-
ments (post-assessment after baseline) was 45 weeks (range: 3–
156 weeks). If studies reported a range for treatment duration,
we used the highest number to calculate the average treatment
duration across included studies. Patient characteristics of the
included studies (n = 43) are reported in Table 2.

Methodological quality

From the 43 included RCTs, results from RoB assessment are illu-
strated in online Supplementary Table S3.

BPD Symptom severity

Pairwise meta-analyses
We first conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for
every treatment comparison. Results are shown in online
Supplementary Table S4.

Network plot
Of these 43 RCTs, a network plot was created for 37 studies (n =
2793), including 11 nodes: MBT (n = 223), CBT (n = 239), TAU
(n = 469), CTBE (n = 192), IPT (n = 49), mixed (n = 262), PDP
(n = 342), GT (n = 124), DBT (n = 678), TFP (n = 128), and ST
(n = 87) as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Six studies were excluded in
this NMA because they did not measure BPD severity but only
measured suicidal behaviour (Andreoli et al., 2016; Carlyle
et al., 2020; Crawford et al., 2020; Linehan et al., 1991; Stanley,
2017; Weinberg et al., 2006). Data was not provided by the
authors after contacting them. From the 37 RCTs remaining,
data on single BPD symptoms were extracted from 11 studies
(Bateman & Fonagy, 2009; Carter, Willcox, Lewin, Conrad, &
Bendit, 2010; Clarkin, Levy, Lenzenweger, & Kernberg, 2007;
Cottraux et al., 2009; Davidson et al., 2006; Feigenbaum et al.,
2012; Herpertz et al., 2020; Linehan et al., 2006; Turner, 2000;
Verheul et al., 2003; Visintini, Roder, Gaj, & Maffei, 2020).
Although impulsivity and anger were both equally often mea-
sured, impulsivity was most of the times assessed with a complete
and valid scale, and therefore primarily extracted from studies

(Clarkin et al., 2007; Cottraux et al., 2009; Turner, 2000;
Verheul et al., 2003; Visintini et al., 2020), followed by anger
(Clarkin et al., 2007; Feigenbaum et al., 2012; Herpertz et al.,
2020; Linehan et al., 2006; Turner, 2000), and lastly, interpersonal
problems (Bateman & Fonagy, 2009; Carter et al., 2010; Davidson
et al., 2006). As illustrated in the network plot, the most examined
comparisons were between dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)
and TAU (Ncomparisons = 6). Almost all nodes included at least
three or more studies (except for IPT node) and were well con-
nected, meaning that each node was at least connected to two
other nodes within the network (except for IPT-node). The con-
tribution plots show the degrees of contributions from the direct
comparison evidence for the mixed and indirect estimates (online
Supplementary Table S5a).

Network meta-analysis
The main results of the NMA are presented in Table 3. In terms
of effectiveness, there was evidence that DBT (0.42, 95% CI 0.11–
0.73) and ST (1.14, 95% CI 0.48–1.80) were more efficacious than
TAU. MBT was borderland significant compared to TAU (0.54,
95% CI −0.02 to 1.10). ST also beat CTBE (1.01, 95% CI 0.25–
1.77). These treatments were also more efficacious than GT, and
ST was further shown to be more efficacious than CBT (0.90,
95% CI 0.12–1.69), PDP (0.76, 95% CI 0.04–1.48), and DBT
(0.72, 95% CI 0.03–1.41). All the other comparisons had too
wide CIs to allow meaningful inferences, making it more difficult
to interpret the results (Table 3). We were unable to perform an
NMA on long-term effects, because not enough studies were
available (n = 17 (follow-up studies measuring bpd severity))
(Table 2), reporting large differences in follow-up outcomes
between trials (ranging from 7 weeks to 260 weeks).

Results of the local inconsistency tests are presented in online
Supplementary Figure S1a. The highest inconsistency factor was
found for the loop CBT, DBT, and GT, but was not statistically
significant ( p = 0.061), indicating that direct and indirect evi-
dence within this loop is not in conflict. In this analysis, 15% of
the loops were inconsistent (3 of 20 loops; p value of
the
design-by-treatment interaction model was 0.62 and did not indi-
cate global inconsistency in the network (χ2 = 9.94, df = 12)). Our
comparison-adjusted funnel plot does not suggest publication bias
since no asymmetry was detected (online Supplementary
Figure S2a).

The results of the analyses on the ranking of psychotherapies
(SUCRA) are shown in Table 4. In Fig. 3 forest plot, the treat-
ments are ranked, with TAU as the reference group. In terms of
efficacy, ST and DBT were significantly better when compared
to TAU (Fig. 3a).

Suicidal behaviour

Pairwise meta-analyses
The results of the pairwise meta-analyses with suicidal behaviour
as the outcome variable are illustrated in online Supplementary
Table S6.

Network plot
Of 43 RCTs, 38 studies measured suicidal behaviour. One study
(Laurenssen et al., 2018) did measure suicidal behaviour, but
did not report their findings in the paper. Data were not pro-
vided by the authors after contacting them, and therefore
excluded from the analysis. Data from one study (Giesen-Bloo
et al., 2006) was provided by one of the co-authors (AA).

PDP, psychodynamic psychotherapy; CTBE, community treat-
ment by experts; GT, generic treatments for BPD; DBT, dia-

therapy; mixed, mixed approaches/
therapeutic techniques; TFP, transference-focused therapy;
ST, schema therapy.

Studies were also excluded if they did not measure suicidal
behaviour as the number of participants who engaged in sui-
cidal behaviour, but rather as the number of events/number of
days
(Bellino et al., 2010; Bozzatello & Bellino, 2020;
Dixon-Gordon, Chapman, & Turner, 2015; Leppanen, Hakko,
Sintonen, & Lindeman, 2015; Priebe et al., 2012; 2009;
Turner, 2000; Walton, Bendit, Baker, Carter, & Lewin, 2020;

Visintini et al., 2020). This resulted in 29 studies (n = 2383).
A network plot is illustrated in Fig. 2b, including a total of
ten nodes (CBT (n = 224), MBT (n = 133), DBT (n = 561),
TFP (n = 128), ST (n = 43), GT (n = 146), PDP (n = 207),
mixed (n = 372), CTBE (n = 181), TAU (n =388)). Again, DBT
v. TAU was the most examined comparison (Ncomparisons = 6).
Each node was connected to at least two other nodes within

Network meta-analysis
The main results of the NMA are presented in Table 5. No psy-
chotherapy appeared to be significantly superior compared to
TAU. Also, not any type of psychotherapy showed significant dif-
ferences when compared to other psychotherapies within the net-
work. We were unable to perform an NMA on long-term effects,
because not enough studies were available (n = 12) (ranging from
7 weeks to 260 weeks) (Table 2). No significant inconsistency fac-
tors were
(online
Supplementary Figure S1b), and no indications for global incon-
sistency in the network was found (χ2 = 4.35, df = 9; p for the null
hypothesis
0.88). Our
comparison-adjusted funnel plot does not suggest publication
bias since no asymmetry was detected (online Supplementary
Figure S2b).

In Fig. 3b forest plot, the treatments are ranked, with TAU as the
reference group. ST (SUCRA = 82.2%), and mixed (SUCRA =
73.9%) were ranked best (Table 4). As shown in Fig. 3b, no type
of psychotherapy was significantly more beneficial in reducing sui-
cidal behaviour when compared to TAU.

Study drop-out

The main results of the NMA on study drop-out are presented in
Table 6. TFP and ST showed significantly lower study drop-out
rates compared to CTBE. Next, significantly more people dropped
out during study in DBT, PDP, MBT, CBT, TAU and mixed
nodes compared to ST. No other significant differences were
found. In Fig. 4 forest plot, the treatments are ranked, with
TAU as the reference group. ST was ranked best (SUCRA =
96.7%), followed by TFP (80.3%) (Table 7). For study drop-out,
our comparison-adjusted funnel plot does not suggest publication
bias since no asymmetry was detected (online Supplementary
Figure S2c).

Sensitivity analyses

significantly better

compared to the others

Firstly, we performed a sensitivity analysis with only studies inves-
tigating a ‘full DBT’ intervention. The findings were comparable
to the main analyses, with overlap in the direction of effect esti-
mates, and similar 95% CIs (online Supplementary Tables S7 &
S11). Secondly, we limited the analysis to studies purely measur-
ing suicidal behaviour (death by suicide and suicide attempts).
The network was less populated, including 23 studies, reporting
wider, but overlapping 95% CIs, meaning that these findings
were comparable to the main results, whereby no psychotherapy
was
(online
Supplementary Tables S8 & S12). Next, because each included
study contained a considerable RoB, no trial was assessed as
high methodological quality. We therefore could not perform a
sensitivity analysis on studies with low RoB. Fourth, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis by excluding 11 studies that did
not measure overall BPD severity (online Supplementary Tables
S9 & S11). Although the outcomes were not identical in terms
of statistical significance and (direction of) effect estimates, and
reported wider 95% CIs, the majority of findings still overlapped.
Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis by only including
studies using a combined format (individual + group). The net-
work included a total of 20 studies. Due to a lack of studies,
two nodes were excluded from the sensitivity analysis (ST, and
IPT). Results showed that, although the network was less popu-
lated, there was still overlap in the direction of the effect estimates
and reported 95% CIs, making these findings comparable to the
main analyses (online Supplementary Tables S10 & S13).

Discussion

This is the first NMA to directly compare the effectiveness of dif-
ferent types of psychotherapies in the treatment of people with
BPD. Study drop-out was included as a secondary outcome. We
found that DBT, MBT and ST were significantly more effective
compared to TAU and GT. These findings remained statistically
significant after performing sensitivity analyses only including

‘full’ DBT-interventions, and therapies using combined formats
(individual + group). Despite that the DBT effect size was smaller
than other treatments, this intervention does have a more robust
evidence-base given that half of all studies in this NMA (19 out of
43 RCTs) investigated the efficacy of DBT. Next, ST appeared to
be more effective in treating borderline severity in adults diag-
nosed with BPD than several other active treatments, including
CBT, DBT, and PDP, however, these comparisons were only
based on three trials, so this should be considered with caution.

Between the remaining therapies included in our NMA, no sig-
nificant differences were found. Possible explanations might be
a lack of robust evidence-base and statistical power, and smaller
number of included trials.

With regards

to suicidal behaviour, no psychotherapy
appeared to be significantly superior compared to TAU or to
each other. Several treatments (see Table 5) do seem to be prom-
ising (RR around 0.5), meaning that these psychotherapies tend to
reduce suicidal behaviour with almost 50% within this participant
group by the end of treatment. Suicidal behaviour was investi-
gated in only a small number of trials, and in combination with
low N in most study arms and nodes, it is much more difficult
to successfully detect any significant effects. ST and TFP reported
lower drop-out rate compared to other treatments such as CTBE.
However, the ST and TFP-nodes included only a few studies, and
that is why its results should be interpreted carefully.

Our NMA is in partial agreement with previous reviews, sug-
gesting that DBT is effective to treat BPD compared to TAU
(Cristea et al., 2017; Storebo et al., 2020). However, in contrast
to Cristea et al., no beneficial effects for PDP in comparison
with TAU were found. This could be explained by the fact that
Cristea et al., grouped all (supportive and explorative) psycho-
dynamic approaches together (MBT, TFP, PDP), instead of break-
ing them down into their own category, resulting in a smaller
number of trials for each group. Compared to the review by
(Oud et al., 2018), we took a broader approach and included
more psychotherapies. Our results partly overlap with those of
Storebo et al. (2020), as we found no significant differences
between the majority of included BPD-tailored therapies, never-
theless, therapies such as DBT did provide solid evidence on its
effectiveness compared to less intensive or specialised therapies

3276

Kim Setkowski et al.

such as GT, CTBE, or TAU. Further,
the meta-analysis by
(Stoffers-Winterling et al., 2022), examined the effectiveness of
stand-alone and add-on therapies for BPD. Although they do
conclude that the impacts for some therapies are promising,
they were not able to make more than two comparisons between
similar treatments. For example, their study found no significant
effects for DBT v. TAU on BPD severity, whilst in our study, the
effect estimate for DBT appeared to be very stable and significant
compared to TAU. They also found a superior effect for DBT and
MBT v. TAU on self-harm and suicide-related outcomes, but this
was only based on a pairwise comparison from two or three trials.
Also, they were unable to include other specialised treatments (ST,
TFP) due to a lack of trials. Our NMA approach made it possible
exploit the data more efficiently, and to compare different types of
specialised psychological treatments in such a way, no prior
meta-analysis was able to do so before.

Limitations and strengths

the

This study has several limitations. First, we detected variability
across included studies in terms of control condition, treatment
dose,
formats, measurements and reporting and selection of
study outcomes, and methodological quality. Some therapies
were reported in smaller number of trials. Also, there are differ-
ences in treatment dose (e.g. therapy duration and number of ses-
sions) and used formats between studies (group + individual or
individual/group alone). Control conditions across RCTs tend
to differ considerably. Trials often chose different study outcomes,
or used different scales or interviews to measure a similar concept
(e.g. overall BPD severity). Therefore, it would be helpful if future
studies would select similar measurements based on the recom-
mendations of
International Consortium for Health
Outcomes Measurement (Prevolnik Rupel et al., 2021), such as
the Zanarini Rating Scale for BPD (ZAN-BPD), the Borderline
Symptom List
(BSL), or the BPD Severity Index (BPDSI)
(Zanarini et al., 2010). Next to that, future studies should also
pay more attention onto how they report their findings. For
example, some trials did use valid instruments to measure their
outcomes, however, we could still not meta-analyse them because
results were not adequately reported, or were not extractable from
the included studies. Second, in this study we measured study
drop-out for any reason, and not treatment drop-out, because
the latter one was often defined differently across trials, making
it difficult to statistically pool and interpret results. To gain
more insight into the actual treatment acceptability, future studies
should measure treatment drop-out more homogeneously, for
example by using similar definitions. A recent meta-analysis by
Arntz et al. (2022) investigated dropout rates from psychological
treatments for BPD. Based on their findings, they also recom-
mend future studies to better distinguish between different
types of dropout (treatment dropout v. study dropout), by defin-
ing them more clearly according to guidelines [e.g. CONSORT
guidelines (Schulz, Altman, Moher, & Group, 2010)]. Third, we
might have introduced heterogeneity for some nodes, such as
for TAU. Despite these limitations, our sensitivity analyses pro-
duced quite similar results to the main analyses, indicating that
our conclusions are robust. Fourth, we were able to include 43
studies, but not all studies could be included in the statistical ana-
lyses. Only a minimal number of studies were available for direct
comparisons. Fifth, insufficient numbers of studies were available
on long-term effects. Most studies were unclear in reporting their
treatment drop-out rate, defined it inconsistently, or provided

insufficient information to infer it, which made it difficult to stat-
istically pool the results. Finally, some studies measured multiple
outcomes (i.e. self-harm and suicide attempts) within a similar
scale, not reporting the results separately.

Implications for research and practice

We also have a few recommendations. First, because we did not
find any significant differences between specialised treatments,
one might argue that future studies should try to replicate the
effects of already existing treatments preferably in head-to-head
trials, instead of developing new treatments or ‘modified/simpli-
fied’
interventions (Oud et al., 2018). However, head-to-head
trials do not generally suggest superiority of any of the available
specialised treatments for BPD relative to one another. Building
up an evidence-base of RCTs could therefore be helpful to exam-
ine whether there are indeed no differences between therapies.
However, it is the question if future RCTs would be able to pro-
vide a definitive answer. On the other hand, specialised treat-
ments are warranted for most people with BPD (Barnicot et al.,
2012), and one may argue whether it is a bad thing when people
can choose from an array of empirically support
treatment
options available. In general, people benefit more from their treat-
ment if they receive a therapy based on their own preference
(Mergl et al., 2011; Swift, Callahan, & Vollmer, 2011). Also,
they are less likely to drop-out, and specialised therapies are
more cost saving when compared to TAU (Brettschneider,
Riedel-Heller, & König, 2014). These costs can be reduced further
if studies support the development of tailored specialised therap-
ies for specific BPD-profiles (Oud et al., 2018). Second, although
large RRs of 0.5 between studies were found, no psychotherapy
was significantly superior compared to others in reducing suicidal
behaviour. Previous studies have suggested that especially treat-
ments directly targeting suicidal behaviour are more effective
compared to therapies using indirect approaches (van Meerwijk
et al., 2016). In our study, DBT is one of the few therapies that
directly targets suicidal behaviour, however, its effects were not
significantly better compared to other therapies. One explanation
could be that DBT was compared to other ‘active’ nodes, includ-
ing trials that are also known for their primary focus on suicidal
behaviour such as CAMS (Andreasson et al., 2016). Third, the
evidence-base for some therapies is still limited, given the small
number of studies and sample sizes. On the other hand, more
large-scale RCTs are currently underway. For example, Arntz
et al. (2022) published an RCT (n = 495), and reported similar
effect sizes for ST compared to TAU on BPD-severity as the pre-
sent NMA. Fourth, we noticed that not all RCTs including parti-
cipants with BPD actually measured overall BPD severity. We
would therefore advise future studies to include validated assess-
ments. Fifth, large-scale RCTs using follow-up measurements are
highly warranted to investigate long-term effects. Sixth, more
research onto the working mechanisms and mediators of psy-
chotherapies is very important. However, it is difficult to show
how a therapy exactly works, and it is therefore still unknown
whether therapies work through common or specific factors, or
both (Cuijpers, Reijnders, & Huibers, 2019). Finally, given the
heterogeneity and complexity of BPD and the range of specialised
psychotherapies available, persons with a certain combination of
BPD symptoms might benefit more or less from different types
of psychotherapy. By identifying these patient characteristics, it
may allow mental health services to provide more tailored and
individualised treatments, thereby optimising the quality of care

for people with BPD. In order to move towards a more persona-
lised approach, it might be worthwhile to undertake an individual
participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) in the near future
(Storebø et al., 2020).

Conclusion

In conclusion, the evidence from this study is not strong enough
to provide a clear answer to the question whether one single ther-
apy is significantly more efficacious in treating BPD symptoms
compared to others, and if so, which one. Although a few therap-
ies showed a significant improvement in BPD symptoms com-
pared to other therapies, these findings were based on very few
trials and should therefore be interpreted with caution. With
regards to suicidal behaviour, some treatments almost halved
the risk of attempted suicide and committed suicide (combined
rate), reporting RRs around 0.5, but these results were not signifi-
cant compared to other therapies or TAU. We therefore suggest
that future studies should investigate the efficacy of these existing
treatments more extensively in high-quality RCTs, preferably in
head-to-head trials using direct evidence. We advise future studies
to conduct an IPDMA. This might help to shed light on potential
moderators and predictors, providing information on who might
benefit more or less from different types of psychotherapies
(Storebø et al., 2020).
