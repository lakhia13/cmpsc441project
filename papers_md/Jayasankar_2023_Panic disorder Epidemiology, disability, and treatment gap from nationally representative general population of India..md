ABSTRACT

Introduction: Panic disorder (PD) is one of the most common and debilitating anxiety disorder. Individuals with PD 
seek frequent healthcare and emergency services leading to frequent work absenteeism and economic burden. However, 
its  prevalence  patterns  in  the  Indian  context  are  poorly  understood.  Hence,  this  article  discusses  the  epidemiology, 
disability, and treatment gap from India’s National Mental Health Survey 2016.
Materials and Methods: National Mental Health Survey 2016 was a nationally representative epidemiological survey 
of adult respondents from 12 states of India. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0.0 is used to diagnose 
psychiatric disorders. Sheehan disability scale was used to assess the disability. The current weighted prevalence of PD 
was estimated. Association between PD and its sociodemographic correlates was done using Firth penalized logistic 
regression. The treatment gap and disability in PD were also calculated.
Results: The lifetime and current weighted prevalence of PD was 0.5% (95% confidence interval 0.49-0.52) and 0.3% (95% 
confidence interval 0.28-0.41), respectively. The male gender and unemployed have significantly lesser odds with current 
PD. The  elderly,  Urban  metro,  and  the  married/separated  group  have  significantly  higher  odds  with  current  PD. The 
most common comorbid psychiatric disorder is agoraphobia (42.3%) and depression (30.9%) followed by Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (10%). Among respondents with current PD in the past 1 month across three domains, around 80% 
had a disability of any severity and 20%-25% had marked disability. The overall treatment gap of current PD is 71.7%.
Conclusion: It is the first study reporting prevalence from a nationally representative sample from the general population 
of India. The survey has shed light on the epidemiology and the challenges faced by those with PD which emphasizes the 
urgency of bridging the treatment gap. These findings are paramount to the development of more inclusive and effective 
mental health policies and interventions to tackle the current burden due to PD.

Panic disorder (PD) is one of the common anxiety disorders 
characterized by recurrent intense anxiety states associated 
with  severe  social  and  health  consequences.[1,2]  The 
disability in PD is comparable to other noncommunicable 
diseases  such  as  diabetes.[3]  Individuals  with  PD  also 
have  poor  social  functioning,[4]  heightened  possibility  of 
suicide  attempts,[5]  and  substance  use.[6]  Also,  there  has 
been recent evidence of considerable disability associated 
with  sub-threshold  panic  attacks.[7,8]  Individuals  suffering 
from  PD  as  well  as  subthreshold  panic  attacks  often 
have  comorbid  psychiatric  disorders[9,10]  which  further 
adds  to  the  disability.  Hence,  individuals  with  PD  display 
increased  healthcare  utilization  services  and  emergency 
care  consultation  leading  to  financial  strain  and  work 
absenteeism.[11-14]

Despite the huge burden associated with PD, its prevalence 
and  its  correlates  are  poorly  understood  in  the  Indian 
context. A comprehensive grasp of its epidemiology fosters 
greater  awareness  among  healthcare  providers  and  the 
public, reducing stigma and improving outcomes.

Hence,  this  article  delves 
into  the  findings  of  the 
epidemiology of PD, the burden of disability it imposes, and 
the estimation of the treatment gap from a first nationally 
representative  sample  from  the  general  population  of 
Bharat (India), that is, National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 
2016.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample
NMHS  2016  was  a  nationally  representative  household 
survey of 34,802 respondents aged 18 years and more from 
12  states  of  India.  The  study  design  of  the  NMHS  was  a 
multistage,  stratified,  random  cluster  sampling  technique, 
with random selection based on Probability Proportion to 
Size at each stage. Face-to-face interviews were conducted 
by  trained  field  workers  with  an  individual  response  rate 
of 88%. Quality assurance was done using various measures 
such  as  certification  of  training  for  field  data  collectors, 
regular  data  checks,  5%  validation  re-interviews,  and 
periodic monitoring of activities. Detailed methodology is 
available elsewhere.[15-18]

Assessment of panic disorder
PD was assessed using Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (MINI) 6.0.0.[19] The MINI is a structured diagnostic 
interview 
for  screening  and  diagnosing 
psychiatric  disorders  as  per  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  4th  Edition,  Text  Revision, 
(DSM-IV  TR)  and  International  Classification  of  Diseases 
10th revision (ICD-10). PD was defined as the presence of 
four or more symptoms of uncued panic attacks not due to 

1250

substance  use  or  general  medical  condition  accompanied 
by  1  month  or  more  of  persistent  concern  about  having 
another  attack  or  worries  about  consequences  of  attacks 
or significant change in behavior because of attacks. Both 
current and lifetime prevalence were estimated for PD with 
current prevalence defined as the presence of symptoms in 
the past 1 month.

Comorbid psychiatric disorders
The proportion of other psychiatric disorders is diagnosed 
using MINI was estimated among diagnosed PD. Suicidality 
was assessed using a set of questions in MINI and interpreted 
as mild, moderate, and high suicidality. We calculated total 
suicidality  by  adding  all  three  subgroups.  For  the  sake  of 
uniformity,  current  estimates  were  used  in  all  comorbid 
psychiatric disorders.

Disability estimates
Disability  among  diagnosed  PD  was  assessed  using  the 
Sheehan disability scale.[20] The respondents were asked to 
rate their impairment in work, social, and family life using 
a 10-point visual analog scale. The numbers obtained were 
re-grouped  into  five  categories:  No  disability,  mild  (score 
1-3), moderate (score 4-6), marked (score 7-9), and extreme 
disability (score 10).

Treatment gap
Respondents  with  PD  were  asked,  “whether  they  are 
receiving any treatment from a formal health care provider”. 
The  treatment  gap  was  estimated  from  the  proportion  of 
respondents with PD not receiving treatment. Also, details 
regarding  duration  of  treatment,  duration  of  illness,  and 
time gap between the onset of illness to consultation were 
collected.

Statistical analysis
To  ensure  that  findings  are  representative  of  the  Indian 
population,  all  estimates  were  weighted  to  account 
for  unequal  probability  of  selection  and  nonresponse 
rates.  Descriptive  analysis  was  used  to  describe  the 
current  weighted  prevalence  of  PD,  its  sociodemographic 
characteristics, 
comorbidity  with  other  psychiatric 
disorders,  disability,  and  treatment  gap.  Modelling  the 
data for binomial outcomes (persons with PD and without 
PD)  was  essential  to  generate  an  odds  ratio  from  logistic 
regression  analysis.  Since  the  number  of  persons  with  PD 
was  disproportionate  to  persons  without,  it  led  to  the 
problem  of  statistical  separation  or  monotone  likelihood. 
Hence, Firth bias reduced logistic regression[21,22] was chosen 
in  concurrence  with  published  literature.  This  statistical 
procedure  reduces  first-order  bias  in  maximum  likelihood 
estimates  of  beta,  and  small  sample  size  and  provides 
finite,  consistent  estimates.  P  <  .05  was  kept  statistically 
significant. R software and IBM Statistical Package for Social 
Sciences (SPSS) version 28 was used to perform statistical 
analysis.[23]

Prevalence
The  weighted  estimates  of  the  current  and  lifetime 
prevalence  of  PD  were  0.3%  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI] 
0.28-0.41) and 0.5% (95% CI 0.49-0.52), respectively.

Sociodemographic correlates
Among sociodemographic correlates [Table 1], the adjusted 
odds ratio (Firth bias reduced logistic regression) associated 
with  being  elderly  was  significantly  higher  among  the  PD 
group. Respondents who were male and unemployed had 
reduced odds among the PD group. Among marital status, 
married and separated/widowed had significantly increased 
odds in PD’s current group. Urban metro had significantly 
increased odds among PD’s current group.

Comorbid psychiatric disorders
Among comorbid psychiatric disorders, agoraphobia (42.3%), 
depression (30.9%), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 
(10%)  were  highly  prevalent  among  respondents  with  PD 
with adjusted odds of 14.6, 3.1, and 5.8, respectively. 6.8% 
of respondents with PD had post-traumatic stress disorder 
with  an  adjusted  odds  of  3.42.8%  of  respondents  with  PD 
had suicidality of any severity with an adjusted odd of 4.3. 
Other  disorders  such  as  alcohol  use  disorder,  psychosis, 
bipolar disorder, social phobia, and obsesseive compulsive 
disorder did not attain statistical significance.

Disability estimates
Seventy seven percent respondents with PD had disability at 
work of any severity, while around 80% had disability at social 
and family life. Of PD group with any disability, the rates of 
severity varied from 44.7%-51.7% in mild severity to 5.7%-9.6% 
in extreme disability across three domains [Table 2].

Treatment gap
The treatment gap of respondents in PD group was 71.7%. 
The  treatment  gap  was  more  among  females  (74.4%)  than 
males  (66.7%).  Among  residents,  rural  areas  had  a  higher 
treatment gap (74.3%) followed by urban nonmetros (70.6%) 
compared to urban metros (65.5%).

DISCUSSION

In  this  nationally  representative  sample  of  the  Indian 
population, the lifetime and current weighted prevalence of 
PD was 0.5% (95% CI 0.49-0.52) and 0.3% (95% CI 0.28-0.41), 
respectively.  The  limited  symptom  panic  attacks  were 
equally prevalent as current PD.

Previous  meta-analysis  on  Indian  epidemiological  studies 
has  studied  only  GAD  and  phobia  as  a  part  of  anxiety 
neurosis,  hence  we  do  not  have  a  comparison  with  those 
studies.[24,25] The 12-month prevalence rate of PD was 0.52% 
in the Indian WMHS study[26] which is similar to our lifetime 
prevalence rates.

Other  recent  Western  studies  have  showed  that  the 
lifetime prevalence of PD is around 1.7%-1.9%.[27,28] Previous 
Western  epidemiological  studies  such  as  The  National 
Comorbidity  Survey  Replication  (NCS-R)  had  estimated 
lifetime  prevalence  of  PD  even  higher  (3.7%  for  PD).[29] 
However, our estimates were closer to lifetime estimates 
of PD from China and Japan mental health surveys.[30,31] The 
cross-national epidemiology of PD also has shown current 
prevalence  of  PD  between  0.5%  and  1.2%[32,33]  with  higher 
prevalence  in  high-income  countries.  Our  findings  are 
in  line  with  the  estimates  from  low-income  countries  in 
WMHS surveys.[34]

Comorbid psychiatric disorders
The most common comorbidity in PD was agoraphobia (42.3%) 
followed by depression (30.9%). Even other Western studies 
have  found  a  consistently  close  association  of  PD  with 
agoraphobia.[35] Hence, it becomes important to screen the 
patients with PD for the presence of agoraphobia. However, 
due  to  the  cross-sectional  nature  of  the  study,  it  is  not 
possible to comment on the trajectory of PD. A substantial 
group of patients with PD (30%) had depression. Around 10% 
of respondents with PD had GAD. A similar trend has been 
noticed in other epidemiological studies.[36] The estimates 
on  other  comorbid  anxiety  disorders  in  respondents  with 
PD  point  toward  the  significance  of  comorbidity  among 
anxiety disorders.

Disability in PD
Around  77%-83%  of  respondents  with  PD  had  a  disability 
of  any  severity.  Of  which,  around  20%-25%  had  marked 
and  extreme  disability.  The  disability  calculated  was  from 
the total PD (current) group which also includes comorbid 
psychiatric disorders as it is the most seen scenario in the 
community. Other studies have also demonstrated disability 
in PD leads to poor quality of life.[37] These estimates highlight 
the need for public health policies and interventions to focus 
on early detection and treatment of PD.

Treatment gap in PD
Around  71%  of  respondents  with  PD  did  not  receive  any 
form of treatment. Females in rural areas had an even larger 
treatment  gap.  Despite  efforts  to  provide  care,  a  huge 
treatment gap exists across all areas and disorders.[38] More 
novel  and  feasible  strategies  have  to  be  implemented  to 
close this treatment gap and hence reduction in disability.[39]

CONCLUSION

This study was the first epidemiological study of a nationally 
representative  sample  in  India  exploring  the  prevalence, 
comorbidity,  disability,  and  demographic  correlates  for 
PD. According to our observation, PD is quite common in 
the general adult population with substantial comorbidity 
rates.  This  points  toward  the  scope  of  further  research 
to illuminate the pathway of PD. The huge treatment gap 
could be controlled with the development of more efficient 
diagnostic and treatment plans where the patients will be 
entitled to timely and to the point care.
