use disorders

Abstract

Addiction to drug and alcohol is regarded as a major health problem worldwide for which 
available treatments show limited effectiveness. The biggest challenge remains to enhance the 
capacities of interventions to reduce craving, prevent relapse and promote long-term recovery. 
New strategies to meet these challenges are being explored. Findings from preclinical work 
suggest that environmental enrichment (EE) holds therapeutic potential for the treatment of 
substance use disorders, as demonstrated in a number of animal models of drug abuse. The EE 
intervention introduced after drug exposure leads to attenuation of compulsive drug taking, 
attenuation of the rewarding (and reinforcing) effects of drugs, reductions in control of behavior 
by drug cues, and, very importantly, relapse prevention. Clinical work also suggests that 
multidimensional EE interventions (involving physical activity, social interaction, vocational 
training, recreational and community involvement) might produce similar therapeutic effects, if 
implemented continuously and rigorously. In this review we survey preclinical and clinical studies 
assessing the efficacy of EE as a behavioral intervention for substance use disorders and address 
related challenges. We also review work providing empirical evidence for EE-induced 
neuroplasticity within the mesocorticolimbic system that is believed to contribute to the seemingly 
therapeutic effects of EE on drug and alcohol-related behaviors.

Introduction

Drug addiction is a growing problem in the Unites States that affects public health as well as 
social and economic welfare. It is estimated that addiction-related costs to society exceed 
$740 billion annually due to crime, loss of productivity and healthcare (NIDA 2016). In 
2017 more than 70,000 Americans died from drug overdose, mainly from opioid or opioid-
based prescription drugs. The recent increases in drug overdose deaths have been so steep 
(Rudd et al. 2016; Colon-Berezin et al. 2019; Jannetto et al. 2019) that they contributed to 
reductions in the country’s life expectancy over the last three years, a pattern not seen since 
World War II, and to the declaration of the national opioid crisis. Despite the enormous toll

that drug addiction continues to take on our society, there still is no Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved medication for the treatment of psychostimulant use 
disorders and those medications that are available for opioid use disorder (e.g., methadone 
and buprenorphine) show limited effectiveness in relapse prevention (Kleber 2007; Stotts et 
al. 2009; Nielsen et al. 2016; Dermody et al. 2018). It is estimated that only 5.3 to 15.3 % of 
individuals maintain abstinence from alcohol or drugs for more than one year after 
termination of pharmacotherapy, representing staggering rates of relapse (White 2012; 
McCabe et al. 2018).

Although pharmacotherapies are often the first line of defense against substance use 
disorders, behavioral interventions have also been implemented. Those that have been used 
are often ineffective (e.g., cue-exposure therapy) in preventing relapse (Franken et al. 1999; 
Marissen et al. 2007) or their effectiveness is short lasting (e.g., contingency management 
therapy; community reinforcement approach) (Stitzer et al. 1980; Silverman et al. 1996; 
Roozen et al. 2004; Petry et al. 2005). The lack of effective treatments for the prevention of 
relapse continues to require considerable efforts and resources to be dedicated to the 
development of better therapies that will attenuate high relapse rates and help individuals 
struggling with substance use disorders maintain long-term recovery. A possible problem 
with these behavioral strategies is that they are focused on specific contingency conditions 
and appear to work only as long as these conditions are in effect. The result is that when 
these conditions are stopped (at the end of treatment) the drug taking response typically 
resumes (relapse) (Troisi 2013; Peck and Ranaldi 2014). As such, in recent years we have 
investigated alternative behavioral strategies that avoid these pitfalls. One solution might be 
the use of environmental enrichment (EE), a behavioral strategy that is not dependent on 
new learning that is effective only under specific (e.g., clinical) contexts and conditions. As 
a treatment for substance use disorder EE may be useful because (1) it may reduce drug 
seeking by reducing the reinforcing consequences of the seeking behavior through a 
behavioral contrast mechanism (Grimm et al. 2008; Ranaldi et al. 2011; Peck and Ranaldi 
2014), (2) it modifies neural circuits in regions implicated in compulsive drug seeking 
(Spires et al. 2004) and drug context learning (Pinaud et al. 2001) and (3) it can reduce stress 
(Thiel et al. 2012), a known powerful inducer of relapse. EE is a behavioral intervention that 
has been successfully applied to preclinical and clinical populations producing remarkable 
changes in neuronal and behavioral functions. The following review summarizes preclinical 
and clinical studies that examined the efficacy of EE as a behavioral treatment for drug-
related behaviors. Emphasis is placed on the efficacy of EE in the prevention of relapse and 
drug seeking. We will also discuss the neuronal effects of EE that might serve as possible 
neural explanations of changes in drug-related behaviors.

2.  Early observations of environmental enrichment effects

EE can consist of making available to animals one or more of the following: sensory 
stimulation, physical activity and social interaction. Although there is no standard 
implementation of EE, in most instances, animals are provided with bigger housing cages 
and novel objects (i.e., “toys”). For some, access to physical activity on a treadmill or a 
running wheel is a key feature of EE, although not the only one. Some laboratories 
incorporate social interaction as part of enrichment; however social housing in drug self-

administration studies, a focus of this review, can be technically problematic and not often 
used. What researchers agree on is that EE provides animals with more sensory stimulation 
and or physical activity in a behaviorally non-contingent manner (i.e., not dependent on the 
emission of a specific behavior) than what they would receive under standard conditions.

The first evidence of environmental effects on behavior derives from work of Donald O. 
Hebb, the Canadian neuropsychologist (Hebb 1947), who raised laboratory rats in his home. 
Hebb noted that his pet rats performed better on a maze than rats reared in standard 
laboratory conditions (Hebb 1947). In a follow-up study, Hebb demonstrated that pet dogs 
reared in EE also performed better on problem-solving tasks than dogs reared in simple 
cages with no view of their surroundings and little contact with humans (Clarke et al. 1951). 
Although these observations gave us a suggestion of how early experiences influence 
behavior, more systematic experimental research was initiated by Mark Rosenzweig in the 
late 1950’s. Rosenzweig and his colleagues demonstrated that rats reared in groups in super-
sized cages filled with toys, ladders, tunnels and running wheels had greater cortical 
acetylcholinesterase activity and larger cerebral cortices than rats reared in isolation and 
standard cages (Krech et al. 1960; Bennett et al. 1964). Until Rosenzweig’s work the adult 
brain was generally thought to be fixed and unable to undergo any degree of neuroplasticity. 
Since then, a number of studies have shown that the multimodal stimulation from EE 
promotes neuronal plasticity that includes alterations in the morphology of neurons 
(Holloway 1966; Greenough et al. 1973; Rosenzweig and Bennett 1996; Kolb et al. 2003a) 
and glial cells (Viola et al. 2009; Diniz et al. 2010), long term synaptic potentiation and 
depression (Artola et al. 2006; Hosseiny et al. 2014) and alterations in gene transcription 
(Greenwood et al. 2011) and neurogenesis (Kempermann et al. 1997; van Praag et al. 2005; 
Hosseiny et al. 2014). Exposure to EE also modifies the neurochemical parameters of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Falkenberg et al. 1992; Bakos et al. 2009) and 
cholinergic (Bennett et al. 1964) and glutamatergic systems (Melendez et al. 2004), both 
important for learning and memory. Because EE promotes various forms of neuronal 
plasticity, it has been explored as a treatment for a number of medical conditions, leading to 
findings that it produces neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Parkinson’s (Jadavji et al. 2006) or Alzheimer disease (Arendash et al. 2004; Prado Lima et 
al. 2018) and can effectively promote recovery from stroke (Kolb and Gibb 1991) or 
traumatic brain injuries (Will et al. 2004; Fischer and Peduzzi 2007).

3.  The therapeutic potential of environmental enrichment for drug abuse 

and addiction

Given its effects on neurochemistry and behavior, EE has also been studied in relation to 
drug abuse. Earlier studies mostly focused on the ability of EE implemented during rearing 
(before any drug exposure) to subsequently reduce drug effects (Bardo et al. 1995; Bezard et 
al. 2003; Solinas et al. 2009). The main objective of these studies was to evaluate 
preventative applications of EE to reduce vulnerability to drug abuse [for reviews see (Stairs 
and Bardo 2009; Solinas et al. 2010)]. Soon it became conceivable to investigate the 
therapeutic potential of EE by introducing it not during rearing but after exposure to drugs 
and the development of drug-taking habits (Thiel et al. 2010; Ranaldi et al. 2011). A number

of studies investigated whether exposure to EE after the development of drug-related 
behaviors (e.g., intravenous drug self-administration) would diminish subsequent drug self-
administration, motivation to seek drug and the propensity to relapse. We will now highlight 
major findings from this preclinical work.

3.1. 

Intravenous drug-self administration

The intravenous drug self-administration paradigm has been used extensively in basic drug 
addiction research to model the human drug use condition. In this paradigm animals can 
voluntarily determine if and how much drug they self-administer intravenously. Studies that 
implemented EE during rearing suggested protective effects of EE against the future 
acquisition of reliable self-administration of psychostimulants (Bardo et al. 2001; Green et 
al. 2002, 2010; Puhl et al. 2012), opiates (Hofford et al. 2017) as well as against the 
escalation of drug intake (believed to mimic “out of control” intake in humans with 
substance use disorder) in rats (Gipson et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2011). Likewise, EE in the 
form of physical exercise introduced before drug exposure can decrease the propensity for 
drug self-administration, again suggesting that it can reduce vulnerability to drug abuse 
(Smith et al. 2011; Smith and Pitts 2012; Lynch et al. 2017). However, these reports are in 
sharp contrast to other findings that housing conditions during rearing do not influence 
propensities to self-administer amphetamine (Schenk et al. 1988; Green et al. 2002), 
methamphetamine- (Lu et al. 2012; Hofford et al. 2014), heroin (Imperio et al. 2018) or 
cocaine- (Bozarth et al. 1989; Westenbroek et al. 2013).

Interestingly, when EE (running wheel) is introduced concurrently with the option to self-
administer drug, it produces remarkable changes in drug-related behaviors. Six-hours of 
concurrently available wheel running can suppress cocaine self-administration in rats, with 
greater suppressant effects in females than males (Cosgrove et al. 2002) and in adolescents 
than adults (Zlebnik et al. 2012). However, Miller and colleagues showed that in rats well-
trained to self-administer methamphetamine, one hour of concurrently available wheel 
running was not sufficient to reduce methamphetamine intake (Miller et al. 2012). In 
contrast, brief physical activity, following the establishment of drug self-administration, can 
be sufficient to alter drug taking. Such brief intervention is especially interesting from a 
clinical perspective, as poor compliance is common among patients in long and time-
consuming interventions. It’s been reported that rats with a history of intravenous self-
administration of methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or 
methylone and given 22-h of home cage access to a running wheel showed a reduction in 
their drug intake in subsequent self-administration sessions (Aarde et al. 2015). Likewise, 
three brief 4 h EE interventions introduced both immediately after and 24 h after each 
extinction session to rats previously self-administering cocaine have been shown to 
effectively reduce the re-acquisition of cocaine self-administration in subsequent sessions 
(Gauthier et al. 2015). Interestingly, when rats received 4 h of EE either 24 h before an 
extinction session or immediately after each extinction session, EE had no effect on the re-
acquisition of cocaine self-administration under a second order schedule of reinforcement 
(Gauthier et al. 2015). To our knowledge, the effects of longer periods of exposure to EE or 
different forms of EE treatment on drug self-administration have not been reported. Overall,

these reports indicate that EE, especially physical exercise, when introduced concurrently or 
after drug exposure, has therapeutic potential for drug abuse and use disorder.

3.2.  Conditioned place preference

The conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm is commonly used to study the rewarding 
effects of drugs and drug-related stimuli (i.e., conditioned stimuli). After repeated drug-
place pairing (conditioning), animals spend more time in the place associated with the drug, 
suggesting the drug-paired compartment, through learning processes, produces rewarding 
effects (Mucha et al. 1982; Tzschentke 1998, 2007; Bardo and Bevins 2000). It appears that 
EE produces differential effects on drug-induced CPP. There is some evidence that EE has 
preventative potential against drug effects. Rearing with EE has been shown to attenuate the 
development of opiate (Xu et al. 2007; El Rawas et al. 2009) and cocaine CPP in rodents 
(Solinas et al. 2009; Zakharova et al. 2009; Nader et al. 2012). However, the Ranaldi lab 
found that EE in rearing did not prevent the development of cocaine CPP across a range of 
cocaine doses (Galaj et al 2017). Similar findings were observed by others when the 
conditioning drugs were psychostimulants (Schenk et al. 1986; Thiriet et al. 2008; Hofford 
et al. 2014; Galaj et al. 2017) or opiates (Smith et al. 2005). Also, other studies found that 
EE (including access to a running wheel), when introduced before conditioning, actually 
strengthened nicotine (Ewin et al. 2015), morphine (Eisenstein and Holmes 2007) or cocaine 
CPP (Smith et al. 2008) and delayed the extinction of CPP (Mustroph et al. 2011). A very 
recent study found no evidence of wheel running during rearing on the development of 
cocaine CPP in mice (Lespine and Tirelli 2019). Thus, the power of EE as a preventative 
intervention against the development of CPP remains inconclusive and warrants further 
studies.

On the other hand, the literature provides compelling evidence that EE introduced after 
conditioning is a powerful behavioral intervention capable of diminishing the expression of 
drug-induced CPP in rodents (Solinas et al. 2008; Chauvet et al. 2011; Galaj et al. 2017). 
Thirty days, but not 7, of EE treatment is sufficient to completely abolish cocaine CPP in 
mice (Solinas et al. 2008). We recently reported that Long Evans rats when exposed to 30 
days of enrichment after cocaine or heroin exposure did not show a CPP as compared to 
non-EE rats (Galaj et al. 2016, 2017). Other forms of enrichment have also been successful 
at diminishing CPP. For example, mice with one or four weeks of access to running wheels 
immediately after cocaine conditioning showed reduced CPP as compared to sedentary 
controls (Mustroph et al. 2016). In addition, treadmill running has been reported to reduce 
nicotine CPP in mice when introduced after conditioning (Zhou et al. 2018).

Additional evidence for the potential therapeutic effects of EE comes from studies 
implementing social interaction either concurrently or immediately after drug exposure. 
When allowed to explore a compartment previously paired with a psychostimulant and one 
paired with another sex- and age-matched conspecific, rats and mice prefer the compartment 
paired with another conspecific rodent, suggesting that social interaction can effectively 
compete with cocaine reward and serve as a therapeutic deterrent against cocaine-related 
behaviors (Fritz et al. 2011; Yates et al. 2013; Kummer et al. 2014). Interestingly, mice and 
rats can develop cocaine CPP after a single cocaine exposure but do not re-express their

preference for a cocaine-paired compartment when given four brief episodes of social 
interaction in the compartment previously paired with cocaine (Fritz et al. 2011; Bregolin et 
al. 2017). Thus, just four 15 min episodes of social interaction can be sufficient to reduce a 
preference for drug-paired stimuli over social interaction and to inhibit the subsequent re-
expression of psychostimulant CPP [for a review see (Zernig et al. 2013)].

3.3.  Animal abstinence models

The conflict-based abstinence paradigm is an appropriate animal model that mimics the 
human experience of abstinence. Drug users, who nearly always have access to their drug of 
choice and are motivated to abstain in order to avoid the negative consequences (i.e., 
medical, social, financial and legal stressors) of continued drug use, often face the conflict 
situation of choosing to continue drug use or abstaining. In the “animal conflict model” 
(Cooper et al. 2007), animals can self-administer the drug but doing so necessitates enduring 
stressful consequences (i.e., crossing a grid floor that is electrified by a current). Typically, 
the electric current is increased after each day of continued drug taking until the animal 
ceases lever pressing for a defined number of IVSA sessions and reaches abstinence. The 
Ranaldi group found that EE facilitates abstinence from cocaine or heroin self-
administration in the conflict model. Rats that completed cocaine or heroin self-
administration training were transferred to EE (sensory stimulation with novel objects and 
running wheels) or non-EE cages and allowed to continue to self-administer the drug in 
daily 30-min sessions during which the floor area near the levers was electrified. EE rats 
achieved abstinence (defined as zero lever presses for 3 consecutive sessions) in fewer 
numbers of sessions and at lower electric barrier currents than non-EE rats (Peck et al. 2015; 
Ewing and Ranaldi 2018). These results support the idea that EE introduced after the 
acquisition of a drug self-administration behavior might be an effective behavioral 
intervention that facilitates abstinence from cocaine and heroin use.

In basic drug addiction research, extinction of drug seeking or preference for drug-related 
stimuli has been extensively used to study abstinence. The extinction paradigm involves the 
reduction of drug-related responding upon the removal of reinforcers (drug) or conditioned 
stimuli (e.g., light/tone) associated with the drug. However, it is important to note that 
extinction is different from abstinence because under extinction conditions, animals cannot 
self-administer the drug as it is not available nor does the animal face negative consequences 
of continued drug use. Nevertheless, there is evidence that EE can facilitate extinction of 
drug seeking. In rats that acquired self-administration of cocaine, 30 days of EE significantly 
reduced lever pressing during daily extinction sessions (Thiel et al. 2009, 2010; Chauvet et 
al. 2009; Ranaldi et al. 2011; Zlebnik and Carroll 2015). EE intervention introduced during 
forced abstinence (where animals are not exposed to drug self-administration chambers) is 
also effective at reducing nicotine and methamphetamine seeking (Sanchez et al. 2013; 
Sobieraj et al. 2016; Sikora et al. 2018). However, the Ranaldi group reported that 30 days of 
EE introduced after heroin self-administration had no effects on extinction of heroin seeking 
(Galaj et al. 2016). Perhaps longer exposure to or more intense EE is needed to facilitate 
extinction of heroin seeking. Clearly more studies are needed to address this issue.

Interestingly, when rats who previously self-administered cocaine received 4 h of EE both 24 
h before and immediately after each extinction session, EE rats showed a significant 
reduction in cocaine seeking as compared to non-EE rats (Gauthier et al. 2015), suggesting 
that even brief EE interventions can be effective at reducing cocaine seeking. Similarly, daily 
2-h wheel running episodes introduced during the extinction phase can reduce cocaine 
(Lynch et al. 2010; Peterson et al. 2014b) or nicotine seeking (Lynch et al. 2019). Notably, 
the most robust effects of EE (especially of wheel running) on drug seeking occur when EE 
is introduced during early extinction sessions and these effects can persist even when access 
to the running wheel is terminated. In contrast, wheel running introduced during late stages 
of extinction is not as effective at reducing cocaine seeking (Beiter et al. 2016; Abel et al. 
2019). In support of the idea that EE has therapeutic value to combat drug-related effects are 
findings that EE introduced after conditioning can facilitate the extinction of CPP induced 
by cocaine [(Mustroph et al. 2011) but see (Solinas et al. 2008; Robison et al. 2018a)], 
methamphetamine (Huang et al. 2016) but not alcohol (Li et al. 2015a). Overall, these 
studies suggest that EE as a behavioral intervention may decrease incentive motivation to 
seek drug and perhaps limit the experience of craving that often precedes relapse.

3.4.  Reinstatement (animal relapse) models

A hallmark of addiction is recurring relapse, which is thought to be driven by both incentive 
motivation for drug and avoidance of negative affective states (Wise and Koob 2014). The 
repeating cycle of abstinence and relapse has been primarily studied using the reinstatement 
model (Carroll and Comer 1996; Shaham and Miczek 2003) in which extinguished 
responding for a drug is reinstated by acute exposure to drug cues, stress or drug. A growing 
body of literature provides supporting evidence for a therapeutic potential of EE to reduce 
relapse. In rats with a history of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin or nicotine self-
administration EE intervention can diminish cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking 
(Thiel et al. 2009, 2010; Chauvet et al. 2009; Thanos et al. 2013; Sobieraj et al. 2016; Galaj 
et al. 2016). Using a within-session extinction/reinstatement procedure, Lynch’s group 
demonstrated that daily 2 h access to a running wheel during 10–15 days of forced 
abstinence from nicotine self-administration was sufficient to reduce nicotine seeking during 
the extinction phase but not cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking in rats (Sanchez 
et al. 2013, 2014). As mentioned above, the therapeutic effectiveness of EE (e.g., wheel 
running) depends on the duration of intervention, with extended EE exposure producing 
more robust effects (Peterson et al. 2014a, b).

Another powerful trigger of relapse is re-exposure to drug itself. There are reports that EE 
(including a running wheel) either fails to reduce (Thiel et al. 2009; Chauvet et al. 2009) or, 
in some cases, can enhance reinstatement of responding after cocaine priming in adult rats 
(Thanos et al. 2013). However, when EE exposure is increased to 60 days during forced 
abstinence with additional days of extinction, EE can reduce cue-induced and cocaine-
primed reinstatement of drug seeking in adolescent, but not adult, rats (Li and Frantz 2017). 
Key findings of this study are noteworthy. First, the therapeutic benefits of EE are correlated 
with the duration of EE exposure suggesting that prolonged behavioral interventions might 
be necessary to prevent drug-primed relapse. Second, adolescent rats are more responsive to 
the seemingly therapeutic effects of EE than adult rats, suggesting that EE’s therapeutic

benefits might be partially attributable to propensity for neuroplasticity (presumably greater 
in adolescents than in adults; see the discussion below).

In addition, EE as a behavioral intervention has been shown to effectively reduce stress-
induced reinstatement of drug seeking in rats [(Chauvet et al. 2009; Zlebnik et al. 2010) but 
see (Ogbonmwan et al. 2015)]. In female Sprague Dawley rats with already-established 
cocaine CPP, six weeks of 1-h daily treadmill running can reduce stress-induced 
reinstatement of cocaine CPP (Robison et al. 2018a). EE, when introduced after the 
development of CPP, can also prevent drug-induced reinstatement of cocaine (Solinas et al. 
2008), or alcohol CPP (Li et al. 2015a). These findings suggest that EE may reduce the 
propensity to relapse, adding to a growing body of evidence supporting the therapeutic use 
of EE to combat substance use disorders.

Relapse to drug use in humans can occur even after prolonged abstinence (Hunt et al. 1971) 
and is often preceded by drug craving (O’Brien et al. 1992). This phenomenon was also 
identified in laboratory animals based on the observation that rats with a history of cocaine 
(Shalev et al. 2001; Grimm et al. 2001; Freeman et al. 2008), heroin, nicotine (Abdolahi et 
al. 2010), methamphetamine (Shepard et al. 2004), or alcohol (Bienkowski et al. 2004) self-
administration show increases in responding in the absence of the drug (aka drug seeking) 
over time. In this “incubation of drug craving” model, animals, after acquiring the drug self-
administration behavior, are not given the opportunity to seek the drug during “forced 
abstinence” and later are exposed to drug cues or drug priming to elicit drug seeking. It has 
been reported that 30-day access to a running wheel or 60-day EE exposure (group housing 
with wheel and toys) during forced abstinence diminishes time-dependent increases in 
cocaine seeking (incubation of craving) (Chauvet et al. 2012; Zlebnik and Carroll 2015). 
However, when EE was discontinued, its seemingly therapeutic effects on incubation of drug 
craving disappeared (Chauvet et al. 2012), suggesting that prolonged, rather than brief, 
exposure to EE might be a more effective approach in the prevention of relapse

4.  Applicability of EE to the human population struggling with substance 

use disorder

Undoubtedly, the therapeutic potential of EE for the treatment of substance use disorder has 
been demonstrated in a number of preclinical models of addiction. However, major concerns 
and challenges arise in regards to translating the therapeutic benefits of EE to a clinical 
population struggling with substance use disorders. Some of these concerns derive from the 
misconception that EE in humans equates to a luxurious lifestyle filled with expensive 
adventures and commodities. This approach, for obvious reasons, lacks practicality and 
feasibility within clinical settings. But what clinical EE intervention might consist of is 
making available to individuals with SUDs non-contingent multidimensional enrichment 
that might be (and often is in sufferers of SUDs) normally lacking in their everyday lives. 
Furthermore, a therapeutic strategy might include the identification of feasible rewarding 
stimuli/activities for an individual and designing schedules that regularly include these 
enrichments in that individual’s routine. A growing body of literature has shown that 
intervention strategies involving enhanced cognitive stimulation, social interaction, and

physical activity (aka EE) are highly effective in the treatment of neurological and 
psychological disorders (Pang et al. 2013; Morres et al. 2019; Cugusi et al. 2019), including 
addiction (Eddie et al. 2019). The most consistent and noteworthy are the findings that 
exercise as a form of enrichment can impede drug-related behaviors.

In nicotine smokers, physical exercise reduces acute cravings (Williams et al. 2011; Elibero 
et al. 2011; Prapavessis et al. 2014; Kurti and Dallery 2014; Fong et al. 2014) and leads to 
temporary cessation of smoking (Prapavessis et al. 2016) and withdrawal symptoms (Taylor 
et al. 2007; Janse Van Rensburg et al. 2009; Kurti and Dallery 2014). While exercise exerts 
acute effects on smoking cessation, these effects are often short-lasting and most smokers 
relapse within a year (Prapavessis et al. 2016; Patten et al. 2017). Thus, it has been 
suggested that physical exercise can be an effective behavioral intervention for nicotine use 
disorder, if engaged in frequently and consistently over time.

Nicotine use disorder is not the only SUD for which physical exercise can derive therapeutic 
benefits. Light, but not heavy, methamphetamine users who underwent an eight-week 
exercise program reported using less methamphetamine and had a lower percentage of drug 
positive urine, as measured 1, 3 and 6 months post-intervention, (Rawson et al. 2015). 
Another study reported that acute exercise eliminated craving for methamphetamine during, 
immediately following, and 50 min post-intervention (Wang et al. 2015). Though not 
statistically significant, exercise also decreased cocaine, but not nicotine, use in the last 24 h 
in individuals with concurrent cocaine and nicotine use disorders (De La Garza et al. 2016). 
Physical exercise has also shown promise for alcohol use disorder as heavy drinkers during 
prolonged (6–12 month) (Jensen et al. 2019) or 8-week supervised exercise program reduced 
their alcohol consumption (Georgakouli et al. 2017). It is worth noting that these types of 
interventions likely produce additional physiological and psychological benefits, including 
improved cardiovascular function and mood, the latter being critical in the treatment of 
SUDs. It has been well documented that the high prevalence of depression and suicidality 
among individuals struggling with SUDs, contributes to relapse and continuation of drug use 
(Bradizza et al. 2006; Milby et al. 2015; Volkow et al. 2019). Thus, one may argue that by 
alleviating depression, exercise can improve the individual’s quality of life and provide 
incentive motivation to dramatically change their life.

Exercise can reduce stress, anxiety and depression, all states associated with heroin 
withdrawal, suggesting it might help maintain abstinence by heroin-addicted individuals. In 
the area of sensory stimulation Bennett et al. (1998) indicated that one weekend camping 
trip – adventure therapy – resulted in reduced relapse in alcohol users compared to a similar 
control group without the camping trip. Also, Cutter et al. (2014) found that video-game 
playing decreased substance use, suggesting that engaging in non-concurrent and non-
contingent video game playing might be useful as a drug addiction treatment. Similarly, 
body motion-engaged video games can contribute to a decline in craving in young 
individuals struggling with opioid-related problems as well as in longer participation in this 
outpatient treatment program (Abroms et al. 2015). There is evidence that engagement in 
interactive videogames stimulates the mesocorticolimbic system (Cole et al. 2012), improves 
optimism, reduces stress and depression (key triggers of relapse) and promotes sustained 
exercise that provides additional health benefits (Cutter et al. 2014; Fish et al. 2014; Bock et

al. 2019). It is also important to note that in these studies participants did not choose 
between drug and enrichment but simply engaged in the enrichment activities and 
experienced a benefit from doing so. This is similar to our rat model that does not make 
available a choice between drug and enrichment. These EE procedures (in humans and in 
rats) do not involve, nor do they need to involve, contingency management or choice 
principles for them to be effective.

4.1.  Other forms of enrichment

Employment has been viewed as an essential part of recovery that significantly improves the 
recovering individual’s quality of life. However, recovering addicted individuals often face 
challenges in returning to the job market and in maintaining their employment. Some of 
them are uncertain about their work abilities and vocational choices while others experience 
anxiety associated with finding, applying for and being accepted for employment. Vocational 
training can provide intellectual stimulation, incentive motivation for change and 
opportunities to develop skills necessary for employment. Vocational training can also 
contribute to a reduction in drug and alcohol use (Hammer et al. 1985; Gómez et al. 2014). 
Those who complete vocational training tend to have better employment and recovery 
outcomes (Hammer et al. 1985; Platt 1995). However, too often, vocational training requires 
abstinence contingency. Koffarnus and colleagues found that alcoholics who had received 
paid vocational training (contingent upon abstinence) consumed less alcohol and had fewer 
alcohol positive breathe samples during monthly assessments than individuals who received 
either unpaid or abstinence contingent vocational training (Koffarnus et al. 2011). Likewise, 
homeless substance users receiving an enhanced day treatment program with vocational 
training and housing contingently upon drug-free urine samples showed a greater abstinence 
rate than individuals receiving weekly individual and group counseling (Milby et al. 1996, 
2000). Although contingency management therapy, like the one described here, produces 
positive short-term outcomes, its efficacy diminishes over time (Silverman et al. 1996; 
Higgins et al. 2000; Rawson et al. 2002; Koffarnus et al. 2011; Barnett et al. 2017). Because 
of a lack of clinical studies with prolonged follow-up assessments it remains unknown 
whether abstinence-non-contingent stimulation (aka EE intervention) can produce better 
long-term outcomes. However, some studies report promising trends emerging with longer 
EE exposure. Higher abstinence rates are observed with 4 week non-contingent interventions 
as compared to one-week interventions (Barnett et al. 2017). Given the highly promising 
results obtained with EE interventions in a pre-clinical setting, it is reasonable to suggest 
that prolonged multidimensional EE interventions (involving physical activity, social 
interaction, vocational training, recreational and community involvement) might produce 
therapeutic effects for individuals with SUDs. Clearly, this issue warrants thoughtful 
consideration and future study.

4.2.  Social support networks as a form of EE

A corollary component of EE intervention for SUDs is the strengthening of social support 
networks around drug-addicted individuals. Non-drug using family members, friends, 
colleagues, 12-Step program groups, or program sponsors can play a critical role in the 
recovery process. Social networks that support recovery lead to longer participation in 
treatment programs, positive outcomes and prolonged abstinence from drugs and alcohol

(Havassy et al. 1991; Bassuk et al. 2016; Lookatch et al. 2019). Thus, support from others in 
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programs is a significant predictor of lower alcohol 
consumption and contributor to abstinence 1 or 3 years after the treatment (Kaskutas et al. 
2002; Bond et al. 2003). Other recovering addicted individuals often have greater impact on 
recovery than non-AA members as they are thought to be able to relate to problems the 
individual is facing and teach the skills necessary to overcome cravings (Kaskutas et al. 
2002; Bond et al. 2003). The reports concerning social support for recovery suggest that 
choosing social support networks carefully is imperative to successful recovery as just any 
type of friend will not suffice, and in some cases, the “wrong friends” may negatively impact 
treatment outcome.

The relationship that most recovering addicts describe as helpful for initiating abstinence is 
peer support (Lookatch et al. 2019). One 12-month follow-up study revealed that brief 
interaction with a physician followed by a visit with a recovering alcoholic (peer 
intervention) is sufficient to motivate patients with alcohol problems to seek professional 
help and to work towards improvement of their life (Blondell et al. 2001). There is some 
evidence that a recovering addicted individual benefits most from peer support when the 
peer is highly involved in their recovery (e.g., by arranging meetings between the patient and 
local AA or Narcotics Anonymous groups, attending meetings together, etc.) (Timko et al. 
2006; Timko and DeBenedetti 2007).

More recently, O’Connell and colleagues demonstrated that individuals with alcohol and 
mental health problems who received skills training in a peer-led social engagement 
program that included social interaction in inpatient and outpatient settings, twice-weekly 
mutual meetings, and recreational outings, showed reductions in alcohol use at 3- and 9-
month follow-ups (O’Connell et al. 2017). Though brief social interactions are effective for 
AUD, they may not be sufficient for cocaine or heroin use disorder (Bernstein et al. 2005; 
Day et al. 2018). Continuous social interaction that includes peer-run groups, coaching, 
workshops, seminars, social and recreational activities and community events might be more 
appropriate.

5.  EE causes brain plasticity

The growing literature demonstrating the therapeutic benefits of EE as a behavioral 
intervention for SUDs has lead to an expansion of our current knowledge of the neural 
mechanisms by which EE exerts these effects. By providing sensorimotor stimulation, social 
interaction and physical activity, EE is thought to mold the whole brain, inducing 
experience-based neuroplasticity in brain regions critical for reward, habits, emotional 
regulation, decision-making and impulse control. These findings are quite pertinent because 
the same brain regions involved in these psychological phenomena have been implicated in a 
number of drug-related behaviors and are believed to be “hijacked” by repeated drug use 
(Koob and Le Moal 1997; Robinson and Kolb 2004; Kalivas et al. 2005).

There is evidence that novel environmental stimuli (typical components of EE) can activate 
the mesolimbic system (Bardo et al. 1990; Bunzeck and Düzel 2006) which includes the 
dopamine (DA) cells originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). By triggering the

release of DA into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Feenstra and Botterblom 1996; Beaufour et 
al. 2001) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Jones et al. 1996; Rebec et al. 1997b, a; Legault 
and Wise 1999), novel stimuli promote exploratory behavior, increase reward processing, 
regulate motivation and enhance learning. In support of this premise are the findings that 
lesions in PFC (Burns et al. 1996) or blockade of DA neurotransmission in NAc (Hooks and 
Kalivas 1995) impedes novelty exploration in rats. The phasic elevation of DA 
neurotransmission by novel environmental stimuli depends on glutamatergic transmission in 
the VTA (Legault and Wise 1999) and activation of the PFC, a brain region critical for the 
detection of novelty (Burns et al. 1996; Rebec et al. 1997b) and for responding to 
unexpected stimuli (Knight and Grabowecky 1995). In addition, other mesolimbic regions 
such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus have been implicated in 
novelty-related and investigatory behaviors (Wu and Brudzynski 1995; Burns et al. 1996; 
Wittmann et al. 2007) and are known to undergo neuroadaptation after EE exposure.

Social interaction (play behavior), another important component of EE, is rewarding in its 
own right (Calcagnetti and Schechter 1992) presumably because it is associated with DA 
neurotransmission (Corbett et al. 1993; Kagaya et al. 1996; Willuhn et al. 2014) and 
activation of limbic regions (Fritz et al. 2011; Dölen et al. 2013; Felix-Ortiz and Tye 2014). 
Preclinical studies have shown that social interaction can reduce the expression of p 38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase in the NAc, which plays a role in stress and anxiety and is 
typically elevated after drug exposure (Salti et al. 2015), can enhance cortical synaptic 
function, dendritic spine density and the complexity of neuronal networks (Himmler et al. 
2013; Burleson et al. 2016; Liang et al. 2019). Other neuroplastic changes within the 
mesocorticolimbic system include presynaptic alterations in DA, glutamate, opioid or 
serotonin neurotransmission and often postsynaptic alterations in receptor expression and 
binding (Vanderschuren et al. 1995; Hall et al. 1998; Wood et al. 2005; Han et al. 2012; 
Araki et al. 2014;). These enduring changes are in stark contrast to neuroplastic changes 
caused by social isolation. Social isolation-dependent brain pathology in PFC, NAc and 
BLA include: hyperexcitability of NAc neurons (Zhang et al. 2019), augmented DA and 
glutamate neurotransmission in response to rewarding and aversive stimuli (Hall et al. 1998; 
Karkhanis et al. 2015, 2019), enhanced expression of AMPA, NMDA, DA D2 receptors 
(Wood et al. 2005; Turnock-Jones et al. 2009; Han et al. 2012; Araki et al. 2014) and 
morphological changes within these regions (Wang et al. 2012). These neuroplastic changes 
are associated with propensity for drug abuse and can be prevented or reversed by EE 
exposure.

Likewise, physical activity is a strong natural reward (Belke and Wagner 2005; Brené et al. 
2007) and is often incorporated into EE regimens. Physical activity can activate DA neurons 
and is associated with neuroplasticity within the mesolimbic system. Cfos transcription is a 
measure of cellular activity and often used to quantify drug-induced activation of reward-
processing neurons. It’s been reported that rats with a prior history of wheel running have 
lower cocaine-induced cfos expression in the NAc, dorsal striatum and PFC compared to 
sedentary rats, suggesting that wheel running, in addition to reducing cocaine-related 
behaviors, also reduces reward neuron responsivity to drugs of abuse (Zlebnik et al. 2014). 
Repeated wheel running is associated with greater levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 
mRNA in the VTA, delta opioid receptor (DOR) mRNA levels in the NAc shell, and reduced

levels of DA D2 mRNA in the NAc core (Greenwood et al. 2011). Autoradiography studies 
have shown that exercise reduces DA D1 receptor-like binding within the olfactory tubercle 
and NAc shell (ventral striatum) but increases DA D2 receptor-like binding in dorsal and 
ventral striatum (Robison et al. 2018b). It is tempting to speculate that these neuronal 
changes might be partially responsible for the seemingly therapeutic effects of exercise on 
drug taking and seeking. Consistent with these findings are reports that reductions in DA-
related transporters mRNA level (e.g., DA transporter, DAT and vesicular monoamine 
transporter, VMAT2) occur in rodent PFC and NAc after chronic exercise or 
multidimensional EE exposure (Bezard et al. 2003; Zhu et al. 2004, 2005, 2013; Zakharova 
et al. 2009). However, no EE-induced changes in DAT or VMAT2 expression or function 
were found in the striatum (Zhu et al. 2004; Hofford et al. 2014).

Multidimensional EE treatment produces beneficial changes in drug-related behaviors that 
are correlated with reductions in the expression of early immune genes, Zif268 in NAc, VTA 
and amygdala and reduction in fosB expression in the NAc, all brain regions known to play 
pivotal roles in drug reward and drug seeking (Fritz et al. 2011; El Rawas et al. 2012). We 
will now review the neuroplastic changes occurring within the mesocorticolimbic regions 
that might partially explain the therapeutic effects of EE intervention.

5.1  Effects of EE on the prefrontal cortex

Though EE does not lead to persistent alterations in dendritic morphology of PFC neurons 
(Kolb et al. 2003b), it produces long-lasting alterations in DA, serotonin and glutamate 
transmission in the PFC (Zhu et al. 2004; Brenes et al. 2008; Darna et al. 2015) and is 
associated with an increase in the number of parvalbumin (PV) GABA interneurons in this 
region (Sampedro-Piquero et al. 2016). The extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK 
signaling in the PFC that appears to be critically involved in incubation of drug craving 
(Koya et al. 2009) can be diminished by wheel running, suggesting that this might constitute 
a contributing factor in the observation of reduced reinstatement of cocaine seeking (Lynch 
et al. 2010). These data are consistent with reports that EE has attenuating effects on 
impulsivity (Perry et al. 2008; Kirkpatrick et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2017) and behavioral 
inflexibility (Sampedro-Piquero et al. 2015; Zeleznikow-Johnston et al. 2017), behaviors 
believed to be controlled by the PFC and to contribute to compulsive continuation of drug 
use. A number of studies have shown that chronic exposure to methamphetamine and other 
drugs of abuse promotes neuroadaptations in the PFC (Tian et al. 2010), a region whose 
dysfunctionality is associated with compulsive drug taking (Jentsch and Taylor 1999; 
Goldstein and Volkow 2002). One can argue that EE, by stimulating the PFC, may help 
individuals increase behavioral flexibility and regain control over their impulsivity.

5.2  Effects of EE on the striatum

Other prime targets of EE-induced neural adaptations are the NAc and dorsal striatum, the 
brain regions critical for motivation (Ikemoto and Panksepp 1999) and habit formation 
(Gerdeman et al. 2003; Yin et al. 2004), respectively, and where drug-induced synaptic 
plasticity appears to play a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of addiction-
type behaviors. Implementation of EE offers opportunities to experience sensory stimulation 
and physical activity that function as rewards in their own right and, through behavioral

contrast mechanisms, are thought to diminish the rewarding value of drugs (Ranaldi et al. 
2011; Peck and Ranaldi 2014) and reduce motivation to seek drug. These pronounced 
behavioral changes are often accompanied by EE-induced long-term synaptic plasticity in 
the NAc and dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen). For example, rats raised in EE not only 
show persistent changes in drug-related behaviors but also alterations in expression of CREB 
signaling, ΔFosB, and PKC signaling in the NAc ( Green et al. 2002, 2003; Solinas et al. 
2008; Lichti et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014). Mice raised in EE showed reduced behavioral 
sensitization to cocaine that was associated with reduced cocaine-induced expression of the 
immediate early gene, zif268, in the NAc as compared to mice raised in standard housing 
(non-EE) (Solinas et al. 2009). In addition, EE mice also have higher basal levels of ΔFosB, 
a transcription factor known to be increased by sustained activation of striatal neurons 
(Thiriet et al. 2008; Solinas et al. 2009). Repeated administration of cocaine increases 
ΔFosB levels in non-EE mice but decreases it in EE mice ( Solinas et al. 2009).

It’s been reported that housing in a complex multidimensional environment for 3.5 months 
leads to an increase in dendritic arborization in medium spiny neurons in the NAc (Kolb et 
al. 2003b). In addition, EE alters the expression of a large number of NAc proteins that 
promote strengthening as well as maturation of excitatory synapses (Lichti et al. 2014; 
Zhang et al. 2016b) and that might contribute to the putative protective and therapeutic 
effects of EE. Similar types of EE-induced neuroadaptations occur in the dorsal striatum. 
Mice reared in EE show alterations in the levels of mRNA coding for proteins involved in 
cell proliferation, cell differentiation, signal transduction, transcription and translation and 
cell structure and metabolism (Thiriet et al. 2008). In the striatum (as well as in the 
hippocampus and substantia nigra) EE also increases the expression of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Bezard et al. 2003), itself implicated in the survival of existing 
neurons, the growth and differentiation of new neurons, formation of synapses and long-term 
memory (Acheson et al. 1995; Huang and Reichardt 2001; Bekinschtein et al. 2008). The 
neuroplastic changes that occur in the NAc and dorsal striatum of mice raised in EE are 
believed to contribute to the protective mechanisms of EE working against drug effects. 
However, it is quite reasonable to propose that similar neuroplastic changes might be 
involved in the therapeutic effects of EE when EE is introduced after drug exposure. Given 
that the NAc is implicated in reward and incentive motivation, one may imagine that EE, by 
offering alternative rewards, rewires the local accumbal circuitry so that the value of drugs is 
relatively diminished and incentive motivation shifts to non-drug rewards. Likewise, EE-
induced neuroplasticity in the dorsal striatum, which is considered critical in the formation 
and maintenance of habitual drug taking (Everitt and Robbins 2005, 2013) may contribute to 
reductions in drug seeking and propensity to relapse. There is some evidence supporting 
these hypotheses.

For example, EE promotes the insertion of non-calcium permeable AMPA receptors into 
silent synapses that typically express stable NMDA receptors without AMPA receptors and 
that are generated by cocaine exposure (Huang et al. 2009, p. 009). During forced abstinence 
from cocaine, the calcium permeable AMPA receptors are inserted into cocaine-generated 
silent excitatory synapses, contributing to their maturation (“un-silencing” the synapse) and 
incubation of craving (Ma et al. 2014). Dong’s lab has recently demonstrated that EE has the 
ability to re-silence these silent synapses through insertion of non-calcium permeable AMPA

receptors (Ma et al. 2016). These unique synaptic changes induced by EE introduced after 
cocaine-self-administration are believed to contribute to the seemingly therapeutic effects of 
EE on the incubation of craving for cocaine (Ma et al. 2016).

5.3  Effects of EE on the amygdala

The amygdala (basolateral and central), which sends glutamatergic efferents to the NAc and 
PFC, is critically involved in drug craving and seeking (Di and Everitt 2004; Stuber et al. 
2011; Stefanik and Kalivas 2013; Li et al. 2015b; Venniro et al. 2018). When given the 
choice between methamphetamine or social interaction rats decrease self-administration and 
also do not show incubation of methamphetamine craving after 30 days of forced abstinence 
(Li et al. 2015b; Venniro et al. 2018). Shaham’s group reported that the protective effect of 
concurrent reward derived from social interaction was associated with activation of PKC-
expressing inhibitory neurons in the central amygdala and with inhibition of the anterior 
insula (Venniro et al. 2018). It has been proposed that home-cage forced abstinence from 
methamphetamine leads to recruitment of central amygdala output neurons contributing to 
long-lasting incubation of craving while volitional social choice remodels this connectivity 
leading to reduced drug seeking. In addition, given that social-choice induced abstinence is 
associated with inhibition of the anterior insula, whose glutamatergic neurons project to the 
central amygdala, it is conceivable that social-choice exposure prevents incubation of 
craving by inhibiting this anterior insula-central amygdala pathway (Venniro et al. 2018). 
These findings are consistent with previous reports that mice exposed to EE or social 
interaction after cocaine conditioning show increases in the expression of the immediate 
early gene, Early Growth Response protein 1 (EGR1, Zif268) in the basolateral and central 
amygdala during the re-acquisition or reinstatement of cocaine CPP (Fritz et al. 2011). 
However, when social interaction is presented as an alternative reward during cocaine CPP, it 
reverses cocaine CPP-induced expression of the immediate early gene, Zif268 in the BLA 
(as well as in the NAc and VTA), suggesting that social interaction as a feature of EE may 
decrease the incentive salience of drug-related stimuli by recruiting BLA neurons (Zernig et 
al. 2013; Zernig and Pinheiro 2015). It’s been also reported that EE as a therapeutic 
intervention introduced after cocaine exposure reduced cocaine CPP-induced expression of 
cFos in BLA and central amygdala as well as in other limbic regions such as the anterior 
cingulate cortex, dorsal striatum, NAc shell, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis and the VTA (Chauvet et al. 2011).

Other EE-induced neuroplastic changes in the BLA have also been reported. For example, in 
situ hybridization studies have shown that EE increased the cannabinoid CB1 receptor and 
fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) mRNA levels in the BLA and hypothalamus, two brain 
regions critical for stress responses. Converging evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid 
system, which modulates the mesolimbic DA system (Xi et al. 2011), plays a critical role in 
reward and stress processes (Gardner 2005; Solinas et al. 2007; Gorzalka et al. 2008). It has 
been proposed that EE induced neuroplasticity in the endocannabinoid system, particularly 
in the BLA and hypothalamus, most likely reduces responses to stress and ultimately deters 
stress-induced drug seeking (El Rawas et al. 2011).

Converging evidence indicates that the primary cellular mechanism involved in the synaptic 
plasticity underlying learning and memory is the insertion of AMPA receptors in 
postsynaptic neurons (Malinow and Malenka 2002). Direct phosphorylation of GluR1 by 
PKA, which is crucial for AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity (Lee et al. 
2003; Man et al. 2007), has been shown to be differentially altered by cocaine-self-
administration and EE intervention. In rats with a history of cocaine self-administration brief 
EE interventions, introduced both 24 h before and immediately after extinction sessions, 
facilitated extinction of cocaine seeking and reduced the re-acquisition of cocaine self-
administration (Gauthier et al. 2017). EE has been shown to increase GluA1 and 
phosphorylated GluA1 at serine 845 (pSer845GluA1) protein levels in the BLA and NAc but 
to decrease pSer845GluA1 level in the PFC (Gauthier et al. 2017). These neuroadaptations 
are believed to contribute to the EE-induced behavioral changes in drug self-administration 
and seeking. Given that GluA1-containing AMPA receptors are located primarily on GABA 
interneurons in the BLA (which control excitability of BLA projection neurons) (McDonald 
1996) and that BLA GABA interneurons receive direct inputs from PFC glutamatergic 
neurons (Rosenkranz and Grace 2002), it is conceivable that EE, by modulating this 
circuitry, facilitates the extinction of cocaine seeking and reduces propensity for relapse 
(Gauthier et al. 2017).

5.4  Effects of EE on the hippocampus

The literature provides an abundance of convincing evidence that EE can induce structural, 
biochemical and functional changes in the hippocampus, a limbic region highly implicated 
in learning and memory. For example, EE can alter neuronal behavior (i.e., excitatory post-
synaptic potentials, long-term potentiation and long-term depression) in the hippocampus 
(Foster et al. 1996; Duffy et al. 2001; van Praag et al. 2005; Artola et al. 2006; Hosseiny et 
al. 2014). Other forms of EE-induced hippocampal neuroplasticity include: neurogenesis 
(Kempermann et al. 1997, 1998; Brown et al. 2003; van Praag et al. 2005), synaptogenesis 
(Sager et al. 2018; Cefis et al. 2019), alterations in BDNF (Neeper et al. 1996; Ickes et al. 
2000; Vaynman et al. 2003; Zajac et al. 2010) and nerve growth factor (NGF) (Neeper et al. 
1996; Pham et al. 1999; Hall and Savage 2016), both of which support the viability and 
functions of neurons and are likely mediators of activity-dependent changes in the 
hippocampus. EE-induced morphological changes in the hippocampus include increases in 
hippocampal thickness (Rosenzweig 1966), dendritic arborization (Fiala et al. 1978) and the 
number of glial cells (Walsh et al. 1969). EE-induced modification in hippocampal 
glutamatergic (Mlynarik et al. 2004; Naka et al. 2005; Segovia et al. 2006; Andin et al. 
2007), cholinergic (Hall and Savage 2016), GABAergic (Frick et al. 2003; Segovia et al. 
2006), norepinephrinergic (Galani et al. 2007) and serotonergic (Rasmuson et al. 1998; 
Galani et al. 2007; Pang et al. 2009) transmission have also been reported. Likewise, 
alterations in the expression of proteins related to hippocampal ERK, CREB, PKA, PKC, 
CAMKII, MAPK signaling have also been noted in rodents exposed to EE (Shen et al. 2001; 
Williams et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2016a; Cardoso et al. 2017). Given that these signaling 
molecules play critical roles in synaptic plasticity (Malinow et al. 1989; Meffert et al. 1991; 
Schulman 1995; Lisman et al. 2002) and addiction-related behaviors (Ortiz et al. 1995; 
Levine et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2006; Lee and Messing 2008) and can be altered by 
environmental experiences, it is reasonable to suggest that EE, by providing

multidimensional stimulation, rewires hippocampal-centered circuits, generates new 
connections that augment the values of non-drug rewards while weakening the values of 
drug-based memories. In support of this hypothesis are findings that mice exposed to 30 
days of EE intervention after cocaine conditioning show a lack of CPP and less CPP-induced 
cfos activation in the hippocampus (Chauvet et al. 2011). It’s been reported that for mice 
engaged in alcohol consumption 21 days of concurrent exposure to a running wheel were 
sufficient to increase BDNF hippocampal levels and reduce alcohol consumption (Gallego et 
al. 2015). Morphine-treated rats that received EE exposure (group housing) concurrent with 
morphine treatment had higher hippocampal BDNF levels that correlated with better water-
maze performance as compared to morphine-treated rats housed in isolation (non-EE 
exposure) (Famitafreshi et al. 2016). BDNF together with its receptor TrkB is essential for 
hippocampal neurogenesis that has been suggested as a key mediator underlying EE-induced 
reductions in drug-related effects, including methamphetamine self-administration and 
reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking (Mandyam and Koob 2012; Recinto et al. 2012). 
However, recent studies demonstrated that EE (wheel running)-induced reductions in the 
escalation of methamphetamine self-administration and drug seeking occurred 
independently of EE-induced neurogenesis (Engelmann et al. 2014; Sobieraj et al. 2016), 
suggesting that other forms of neuroplasticity might control these beneficial effects of EE. 
Clearly, more studies are needed to fully understand the neurobiology of EE’s therapeutic 
and preventative benefits against drug effects.

6.  Summary

The complexities of the behavioral and neurobiological factors underlying SUDs create 
enormous challenges in efforts to develop effective pharmacological treatments. Although 
traditional pharmacological approaches to combat SUDs have provided encouraging results 
at a preclinical level, limited success has been achieved at a clinical level. Despite many 
years of intense research in medication development, SUDs still remain a serious problem, 
affecting millions of lives and for which long-term effective treatments are at best sparse. 
Given the current opioid crisis and the urgent need for more efficacious treatments, new 
strategies are being explored. Current preclinical and clinical data indicate that EE is an 
effective intervention for the treatment of SUDs as it has the ability to control impulsive 
drug taking, attenuate the rewarding (and reinforcing) effects of drugs, reduce the 
effectiveness of drug cues, and, very importantly, reduce craving and relapse. Importantly, 
EE might be effective because it does not depend on new learning that is effective only 
within specific (e.g., clinical) contexts and under specific conditions. EE produces profound 
neuroplasticity in regions of the brain that are strongly implicated in reward processing, 
incentive motivation, reward-related learning and habit formation and compulsivity, all 
behaviors at the heart of addiction development, maintenance and recurrence. The 
identification of the neuroplastic changes induced by EE over the past few decades has shed 
new light on the underlying mechanisms by which EE produces its protective and 
therapeutic effects against drug addiction and may constitute a pathway through which we 
may expand the therapeutic possibilities for treating SUDs.

Highlights

Preclinical research suggests environmental enrichment is an effective behavioral strategy 
to reduce drug-related behaviors

Environmental enrichment leads to neural adaptations in brain regions highly implicated 
in drug reward and use disorder

Evidence suggests that environmental enrichment is beneficial for individuals struggling 
with substance use disorder
