ABSTRACT
Introduction: Depersonalization and derealization disorder (DPDR) is a debilitating condition. To date, little was known about 
the role of personality structure and of perceived social support and loneliness in DPDR.
Methods: Three studies investigated, respectively: (i) broadband personality traits (five- factor model), maladaptive trait domains 
(PID- 5), and perceived support and loneliness in individuals with self- reported DPDR (N = 160) versus a general population sam-
ple (N = 303), using network modeling; (ii) structure and interconnectivity of personality, perceived support and loneliness, and 
DPDR traits (frequency/duration) in individuals with self- reported DPDR (N = 160); (iii) characteristic adaptations and narrative 
identities in individuals with self- reported DPDR (N = 19), using thematic analysis.
Results: Study 1 found between- samples differences across several traits, especially psychoticism and negative affect. Differences 
in networks' global centrality, but not structures or edges, were also found. The graphical model in Study 2 showed a community 
of dissociative tendencies including DPDR traits and psychoticism. Study 3 highlighted the development of DPDR as a key life 
transition for those experiencing it, with narratives focusing on feelings of poor agency, isolation, and a disrupted sense of self.
Conclusions: Individual differences in personality characterize DPDR, especially in psychoticism. Implications for theory and 
research are discussed.

1   |   Introduction

The  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
version 5 (DSM- 5), categorizes depersonalization and derealiza-
tion  (DPDR)  as  a  dissociative  disorder,  denoting  a  breakdown 
and  compartmentalization  of  psychobiological  functions  that 
normally  work  in  unison  (American  Psychiatric  Association 
[APA] 2013). DPDR manifests through an integrated and related 
set of symptoms, primarily: (i) a feeling of perceptual alteration 
of  surroundings  and  the  external  world,  as  if  these  were  “un-
real” or dream- like (derealization, DR), experienced continually 

despite  intact  reality  testing  (World  Health  Organization 
[WHO] 2024); (ii) the often accompanying feeling of being dis-
connected from one's own thoughts, mind, and/or body, or feel-
ing “like a robot,” for example, observing one's own perceptions 
from outside the self, while questioning their ownership (deper-
sonalization, DP) (Baker et al. 2003; Medford et al. 2005).

DPDR is comorbid with several psychopathological conditions, 
including  anxiety  disorders,  depression,  obsessive- compulsive 
tendencies, and other dissociative syndromes (for a review, see 
Sierra  2009).  This  challenges  the  estimation  of  its  prevalence

across psychiatric populations, whereas the prevalence of DPDR 
in  the  general  population  is  estimated  to  be  about  1%  (Yang 
et al. 2023). However, this figure may underestimate the actual 
prevalence of the condition, due to a combination of factors, im-
portantly, the difficulty experienced by individuals with DPDR 
to  verbalize  their  symptoms  (Medford  et  al.  2005)  and  the  de-
layed and inadequate assessments that are frequently reported 
by those experiencing DPDR (Murphy 2023).

1.1   |   The Role of Individual Differences in 
Depersonalization and Derealization

Individual differences play a role in the development and expe-
rience of DPDR. Wolf et al. (2023) found in individuals with dis-
sociative post- traumatic stress disorder that DP was associated 
with altered connectivity of the hippocampal region and deterio-
rated self- monitoring capacity. These results indicate alterations 
at the levels of sensory integration, spatial representation, and 
the experience of stress of individuals, possible mechanisms of 
DPDR- related post- traumatic experiences, in line with evidence 
from  previous  neuroimaging  studies  about  psychedelic  drug 
use- induced DPDR (Carhart- Harris et al. 2014). However, other 
studies pointed out the role of individual differences in the de-
velopment  of  DPDR,  even  in  the  absence  of  traumatic  experi-
ences. For example, Aardema et al. (2010) found that tendency 
to  absorption  is  associated  with  a  greater  likelihood  of  experi-
encing DP, after immersion in a virtual reality task. Similarly, 
Soffer- Dudek  (2023)  has  recently  hypothesized  a  role  for 
obsessive- compulsive  symptoms  and  a  tendency  to  absorption 
in the appearance and intensification of dissociative symptoms. 
Furthermore,  resting- state  fMRI  data  showed  links  between 
DPDR- related perceptual dysregulation and a disrupted intero- 
exteroceptive  integration  function,  manifesting  through  com-
partmentalization,  detachment  from  reality,  and  structural 
dissociation of personality, including changes in one's sense of 
self  and  identity  (Scalabrini  et  al.  2020).  Notwithstanding  the 
increasing corpus of evidence that highlights individual differ-
ences in the onset, frequency, and severity of DPDR, there are 
still many unknowns about the structure of personality of those 
affected by the condition. In particular, little is known about dis-
positional traits, characteristic adaptations, and narrative iden-
tity  reconstructions  in  individuals  with  DPDR,  a  gap  that  the 
current research aims to address.

1.2   |   Dispositional Traits and DPDR

Ciaunica et al. (2022) have recently described the experience of 
DPDR  in  terms  of  a  distinctive  way  to  engage  with  the  world 
“with two mutually exclusive but equally plausible hypotheses. 
(1) First, a hypothesis that the best explanation for all the evi-
dence at hand is that ‘I am an embodied perceiver, and I am in 
control of my perceptual processing’. (2) The alternative hypoth-
esis  is  that  ‘I  am  an  embodied  perceiver,  but  I  am  not  in  con-
trol of my perceptual processing’” (p. 7). It must be noted that 
such a definition lends itself to important considerations on the 
dispositional nature of the altered perception that characterizes 
DPDR.  For  example,  previous  research  in  personality  psychol-
ogy evidenced individual variation in experiential permeability, 
namely, a maladaptive personality trait that reflects individual 

differences in regulating inner perceptions and outer reality in-
teractions (Piedmont et al. 2009). For this reason, understanding 
and mapping the personality structure and differences in broad-
band FFM traits and maladaptive trait domains of individuals 
with DPDR is warranted, potentially shedding light on the indi-
vidual differences that might predispose to and/or intensify the 
experience of DPDR.

Extant literature on personality and DPDR is sparse. Few stud-
ies  have  approached  the  analysis  of  the  associations  between 
DPDR  and  personality  structure,  of  which,  the  five- factor 
model (FFM; McCrae and John 1992) is considered as one of the 
most  established  representations.  The  FFM  posits  a  hierarchi-
cal organization of human personality in five primary factors, 
namely:  neuroticism  (negative  emotionality  and  tendency  to 
anxiety and depression), extraversion (sociability, assertiveness, 
energy),  openness  to  experience  (intellectual  curiosity,  origi-
nality,  creativity),  agreeableness  (kindness,  soft- heartedness, 
cooperativeness),  and  conscientiousness  (discipline,  organiza-
tion,  persistence).  These  dispositional  traits  present  stable  and 
consistent patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior, which are 
known to play a key role in mental health and wellbeing (Wang 
et al. 2018), including influencing individuals' perceptions of so-
cial support and loneliness (Swickert, Hittner, and Foster 2010; 
Buecker et al. 2020).

Evidence indicates the possible role of a premorbid personality 
structure  in  DPDR,  that  is,  individual  differences  in  personal-
ity  that  may  predispose  people  to  mental  (ill- )health,  facilitat-
ing and/or sustaining the development and experience of DPDR 
(Aardema et al. 2010; Scalabrini et al. 2020; Soffer- Dudek 2023). 
In particular research has shown relations between dissociative 
symptoms  and  neuroticism  (Kwapil,  Wrobel,  and  Pope  2002), 
the  latter  being  a  known  correlate  of  several  psychopathologi-
cal  outcomes.  Moreover,  Kwapil,  Wrobel,  and  Pope  (2002) 
found an independent factor of dissociative experiences within 
a  six- factor  solution  that  replicated  and  expanded  the  original 
FFM.  A  study  on  individual  vulnerability  to  virtual  reality- 
induced  DP  found  a  correlation  between  neuroticism  and  DP 
scores, but no significant associations between DP and person-
ality  (Peckmann  et  al.  2022).  Another  study  used  Cloninger, 
Svrakic, and Przybeck's (1993) psychobiological model to inves-
tigate  variations  in  temperamental  traits  between  panic  disor-
ders traits with/without comorbid DP, finding that individuals 
with  DP  scored  lower  on  self- directedness  and  higher  on  self- 
transcendence than those without DP.

Moreover, self- directedness and self- transcendence were found 
to be associated with PID- 5 psychoticism (Hemmati et al. 2021), 
one  of  the  five  trait  domains  from  the  DSM- 5  model  of  mal-
adaptive  personality  (PID- 5;  Krueger  et  al.  2012).  This  is  a  hi-
erarchical  model  of  personality  dysfunction  that  identifies  25 
lower  order  facets  loaded  on  by  five  higher  order  maladaptive 
trait  domains,  namely:  negative  affectivity  (emotional  lability, 
anxiousness,  relational  insecurity),  detachment  (withdrawal, 
anhedonia,  intimacy  avoidance),  antagonism  (manipulative-
ness, deceitfulness, grandiosity), disinhibition (irresponsibility, 
impulsivity,  distractibility),  and  psychoticism  (unusual  beliefs 
and experiences, eccentricity, perceptual dysregulation). These 
represent maladaptive counterparts of the FFM traits (Krueger 
et  al.  2012).  Individuals  scoring  highly  in  PID- 5  trait  domains 

797

are likely to present forms of psychopathology, including person-
ality disorders and maladaptive behavior (Krueger et al. 2012).

Among the PID- 5 trait domains, psychoticism is of particular in-
terest for DPDR. Indeed, this maladaptive trait domain is char-
acterized by tendencies to bizarre or unconventional patterns of 
thinking and perceptual/cognitive dysregulation that are com-
mon  across  personality  disorders  and  dissociative  experiences 
(Watson,  Clark,  and  Chmielewski  2008).  Soffer- Dudek  (2023) 
noted  that  dysregulated  perception  (characteristic  of  psychoti-
cism) is associated with temporal lobe abnormalities, which in 
turn,  are  present  in  obsessive- compulsive  symptoms  (Ertekin 
et  al.  2009).  For  this  reason,  they  hypothesized  a  relation  be-
tween obsessive- compulsive personality and DPDR, in the same 
vein  as  Torch  (1978),  which  would  explain  the  constant  self- 
monitoring,  repetitive  and  intrusive  thoughts  often  observed 
in  DPDR  (Medford  et  al.  2005;  Soffer- Dudek  2023).  Regarding 
bonding and interpersonal connectivity, DPDR has been found 
to be associated with introversion, loss of interest and of motiva-
tion to pursue relationships and attachments, subjective feelings 
of loneliness, isolation, and avoidance of social and group situa-
tions (Michal et al. 2006).

DPDR  patients'  reports  (e.g.,  see  Perkins  2021)  typically  sug-
gest  impairments  in  agency  and  communion,  two  central 
themes  of  narrative  identity,  respectively,  relevant  to  the  need 
to  master  one's  environment  and  to  cooperate  with  others 
(McAdams 2018). Agency reflects the sense of ownership, em-
powerment,  and  achievement  that  individuals  communicate 
through  their  narratives,  that  is,  beliefs  in  their  ability  to  in-
fluence the course of their own and others' lives through their 
actions. Communion refers to the extent and quality of interper-
sonal connections and attachments (e.g., family, close relation-
ships, group affiliations), their role in the experience of and in 
coping with adversities, and the feelings of support versus iso-
lation  and  loneliness  that  people  derive  from  them.  Exploring 
narrative reconstructions of lifelong agency and communion in 
individuals with DPDR may therefore further help understand 
the  process  of  integrating  the  altered  perception  associated 
with DPDR symptoms within a cohesive sense of self and of the 
world, clarifying barriers and facilitators to symptoms' manage-
ment and recovery, which are vital to clinical intervention and 
practice. These narratives are expressed in the form of themes, 
characters,  and  events  that  help  individuals  shape  an  under-
standing of how they “came to be and where he or she is going in 
life” (McAdams and Olson 2010, 527).

1.3   |   Characteristic Adaptations and Narrative 
Identity Reconstructions

1.4   |   The Present Research

In DPDR, chronic alterations to experiences within one's self and 
the environment trigger constant and rigid questioning about the 
perception  of  being  in  control  of  one's  own  thoughts,  feelings, 
and  behavior  (Ciaunica  et  al.  2022;  Medford  et  al.  2005).  This 
impacts  individuals'  ability  to  design  and  implement  effective 
strategies  to  cope  with  symptoms  and  derive  a  coherent  sense 
of meaning and purpose in life, in a world that is perceived as 
constantly at risk of turning “unreal (Perkins, 2021).” Therefore, 
understanding  individuals  with  DPDR's  characteristic  adapta-
tions  and  narrative  identity  reconstructions  (McAdams  2013) 
would  help  gauge  a  greater  understanding  of  how  individuals 
experience,  adapt  to,  and  make  sense  of  their  symptoms,  with 
important implications for theory and intervention. These fea-
tures are conceptualized by McAdams (2013) in their theory of 
human  personality.  The  theory  defines  personality  as  a  three- 
layered construct, respectively, being characterized by: (i) indi-
viduals' dispositional traits, which define personality structure 
and map individuals' relatively stable and consistent patterns of 
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; (ii) characteristic adaptations, 
that is, beliefs, motives, and coping strategies that help individu-
als adjust to circumstances and face adversities (McAdams and 
Olson 2010); and (iii) narrative identity, that is, the sense of self 
and identity that individuals reconstruct through narrating and 
reflecting on their own story, a continuously evolving subjective 
framework of self/others perceptions, personal agency, and so-
cial interactions. This model has so far informed a diverse range 
of  research  areas,  including  psychopathology,  where  under-
standing the role of beliefs and coping strategies against symp-
toms  helps  shed  light  on  the  mechanisms  of  recovery,  which 
in  turn,  supports  the  further  development  of  theory  and  clin-
ical  applications  (Weststrate,  Jayawickreme,  and  Wrzus  2022). 
However, regarding DPDR, a systematic and integrative explora-
tion of dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and narra-
tive identity is missing.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous research has 
approached the study of DPDR primarily from the perspective 
of personality psychology. The present research aims to address 
this gap through three studies, respectively aiming to: (i) com-
pare mean differences, structure, and conditional interconnec-
tivity of broadband FFM and maladaptive PID- 5 trait domains 
and perceived support/loneliness in individuals with DPDR ver-
sus individuals from the general population; (ii) model, examine, 
and evaluate a network of DPDR traits in relation to the same 
model  tested  in  Study  1,  this  time,  limited  to  individuals  with 
self- reported DPDR; and (iii) explore characteristic adaptations 
and narrative identities of individuals living with the condition, 
aiming to expand and integrate the understanding of the role of 
personality structure and individual differences in DPDR.

2   |   Study 1—Methods

2.1   |   Participants and Procedure

Study 1 used two datasets. First, data were collected from in-
dividuals with self- reported DPDR. Originally, they were 275 
individuals  contacted  between  May  2023  and  January  2024 
through Unreal (unrea luk. org), a UK charity that raises aware-
ness and promotes information on DPDR, as well as network-
ing  and  sharing  of  DPDR  lived  experiences.  The  study  was 
advertised  via  the  charity's  email  newsletters,  social  media 
posts, and other media channels. Individuals were invited to 
take part in the study on a voluntary basis, with no incentives 
being offered. Participants were screened through the follow-
ing prompt, informed by the definition provided by the United 
Kingdom's  National  Health  Service  (NHS)  (2023)  “Have  you 
ever  experienced  either  derealization  and/or  depersonaliza-
tion  symptoms?  (Yes/No).  As  per  the  definition  provided  by 

798

Journal of Personality, 2025

the NHS: Depersonalization is where you have the feeling of 
being outside yourself and observing your actions, feelings or 
thoughts from a distance. Derealization is where you feel the 
world  around  is  unreal.  People  and  things  around  you  may 
seem  ‘lifeless’  or  ‘foggy’.  You  can  have  depersonalization  or 
derealization, or both together. It may last only a few moments 
or come and go over many years.”

Four  distinct  forms  of  perceived  interpersonal  support  were 
measured through four items from Haslam et al.'s (2005) Social 
Support Scale, respectively, assessing the extent to which indi-
viduals  feel  that  they  receive  the  emotional  support,  help,  ad-
vice, and material resources they need from the groups they are 
members  of.  Items  were  rated  on  a  scale  from  1  (strongly  dis-
agree) to 7 (strongly agree).

In total, 160 individuals with self- reported DPDR were included 
in the study and completed the procedure. The sample included 
96  females  (60.00%;  Mage = 33.30,  SDage = 14.00),  48  males 
(30.00%; Mage = 35.40, SDage = 14.80), and 16 who preferred not 
to  report  their  gender  (10.00%;  Mage = 24.7,  SDage = 5.59).  In 
addition, data from 303 individuals from the UK general pop-
ulation  were  used.  They  were  recruited  via  Prolific  (proli fic. 
com) in June 2022. The sample included 149 females (49.17%; 
Mage = 40.30,  SDage = 13.00),  153  males  (50.50%;  Mage = 39.30, 
SDage = 13.70), and one who preferred not to report their gen-
der (0.33%; age = 26). Participants from the general population 
were  invited  to  join  a  separate  study  and  were  compensated 
for their participation and time at the average rate of £9.72/h. 
The  study  procedure  was  the  same  between  groups,  consist-
ing  of  filling  out  a  set  of  online  self- report  measures  (about 
15–20 min), through Qualtrics (qualt rics. com). The procedures 
obtained a favorable ethical opinion from the institutional eth-
ics committee of the first, second, third, and fifth authors of the 
current manuscript.

2.2   |   Materials and Measures

Participants  with  self- reported  DPDR  were  administered 
the  Cambridge  Depersonalization  Scale  (CDS;  Sierra  and 
Berrios 2000). This is a 29- item measure of the frequency and du-
ration of DPDR symptoms over the last 6 months. For each item 
(e.g., “I have the feeling of being outside my body”), frequency 
and duration were assessed, respectively, using a 5- point scale 
(never/all of the time) and a 6- point scale (few seconds/more than 
a week). This scoring method is reported across a range of stud-
ies (e.g., Farrelly et al. 2016; Levin, Gornish, and Quigley 2022; 
Millman  et  al.  2022).  However,  the  original  version  by  Sierra 
and Berrios (2000) aggregated responses into a global score with 
frequency ranging between 0 (never) and 6 (more than a week) 
and duration between 1 (few seconds) and 4 (about a day). For 
this  reason,  a  post- hoc  procedure  was  used  to  compare  scores 
against the clinical cutoff indicated by Sierra and Berrios (2000), 
reported in the following paragraphs.

The  60- Item  Representation  of  the  NEO  PI- R  (NEO  PI- R- 60; 
Maples- Keller et al. 2019) is a personality inventory based on the 
FFM (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agree-
ableness, conscientiousness). Items (e.g., “I am one who worries 
about things”) are rated on a scale from 1 (very inaccurate) to 5 
(very accurate).

The  Personality  Inventory  for  DSM- 5—short  form  (PID- 5- SF; 
Krueger et al. 2012) is a 25- item version of the maladaptive person-
ality inventory for the DSM- 5, measuring five traits of antagonism, 
detachment,  disinhibition,  negative  affect,  and  psychoticism. 
Items (e.g., “I feel like I act totally on impulse”) are rated on a scale 
from 0 (very false or often false) to 3 (very true or often true).

Finally,  the  UCLA  3- item  Loneliness  Scale  (UCLA- 3;  Haslam 
et al. 2008) was used as an aggregated general measure of indi-
viduals' subjective feelings of loneliness. This is a measure of the 
extent to which individuals tend to feel, in their lives, a lack of 
companionship, to be left out, and isolated from others, respec-
tively. Items are rated on a scale ranging from 1 (hardly ever) to 
7 (very often).

2.3   |   Analytic Approach

Parametric  independent  sample's  tests  of  mean  differences, 
Cohen's d for effect sizes (interpreted as follows: small = 0.20–0.49; 
medium = 0.50–0.79; large ≥ 0.8), and false discovery rate (FDR) 
adjustments  of  p- values  were  used.  Multiple- group  graphical 
modeling was used to investigate and compare the topology, cen-
trality,  and  interconnectivity  of  dispositional  traits'  networks  in 
individuals with DPDR (henceforth: “DPDR”) versus individuals 
from the general population (‘Controls’). This used Spearman's cor-
relations  and  EBICglasso  regularization  (Costantini  et  al.  2015; 
Epskamp  and  Fried  2018),  following  the  testing  of  multivariate 
normality  through  the  b1p  multivariate  skewness  coefficient 
(25.59, p < 0.001). The organization of the nodes into latent com-
munities was detected by means of Louvain's algorithm (Blondel 
et al. 2008) and evaluated through modularity (Q), a measure of 
the strength of the division of the network into a set of subgraphs 
or communities, with values comprised between 0.3 and 0.7 indi-
cating acceptable results (Epskamp, Borsboom, and Fried 2018). 
The centrality of nodes was assessed by means of expected influ-
ence  (EI),  a  measure  of  relative  centrality  that  accounts  for  en-
hancing and mitigating effects derived from signed connectivity 
between nodes. The graphical model was bootstrapped to allow 
for an evaluation of the stability of EI, obtained by implementing 
a case- drop approach, whereby a varying portion of the original 
sample (i.e., from 5% to 75%, in steps of 5%, and 1000 samples ex-
amined at each stage), was progressively dropped, and the stabil-
ity of the bootstrapped centrality was assessed using Correlation 
Stability (CS), that is, a measure of the highest fraction of cases 
that can be dropped whilst keeping a satisfactory correlation with 
the original sample (Epskamp and Fried 2018). Network predict-
ability was also estimated and evaluated, indicating the degree to 
which a given node can be predicted by its neighbors.

For  network  comparisons,  a  three- fold  approach  was  used:  (i) 
each network was estimated separately and visually inspected, 
then  their  characteristics  were  evaluated  and  compared;  (ii) 
Fused Joint Graphical Lasso (Danaher, Wang, and Witten 2014) 
was used to model the data through contemporaneous multiple- 
group  network  estimation  and  regularization,  a  powerful 
method that allows for the exploitation of similarities between 
graphical  models  whilst  maximizing  the  information  on  their 
differences (Costantini and Epskamp 2017); (iii) a series of per-
mutation  tests  (5000  iterations)  investigated  multiple- group 

799

invariance  in  network  structure,  global  centrality,  and  edges 
(van Borkulo et al. 2022).

The analyses were performed in R, version 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 
2023), platform: x86_64- pc- linux- gnu (64- bit), using the follow-
ing  packages:  bootnet  (Epskamp,  Borsboom,  and  Fried  2018), 
EstimateGroupNetwork  (Costantini  and  Epskamp  2017),  ig-
raph  (Csárdi  et  al.  2023),  mgm  (Haslbeck  and  Waldorp  2020), 
NetworkComparisonTest  (van  Borkulo  et  al.  2022),  and  qgraph 
(Epskamp, Borsboom, and Fried 2018).

2.5   |   Results and Discussion

Multivariate  outliers'  detection  through  Mahalanobis  dis-
tances  (α = 0.001)  indicated  no  outliers.  Data  were  validated 
post  hoc,  by  considering  intra- individual  variability  (IVR) 
across  all  items'  responses,  using  the  procedure  illustrated 
by Marjanovic et al. (2015). This consists of generating a ran-
dom dataset of equal size to the empirical dataset and calcu-
lating  IVR  (i.e.,  standard  deviation)  across  all  observations. 
Then, logistic regression is run, using IVR as a predictor and 
the  grouping  variable  (random  vs.  empirical)  as  a  criterion. 
Classification  accuracy  (ratio  of  sensitivity  and  specificity; 
threshold = 0.50) > 0.80 indicates acceptable outcomes. In the 
current sample, classification accuracy was 0.90. In addition, 
no participants showed an IVR < 0.30.

Importantly,  participants  had  self- reported  their  experience  of 
DPDR.  This  was  assessed  through  a  simple  prompt  and  ques-
tion, as mentioned in previous paragraphs. No formal screening 
or assessment was used to differentiate those with transient ver-
sus non- transient forms or to identify participants based on the 
severity of their symptoms. For this reason, a post hoc procedure 
was implemented for rescaling CDS scores and comparing them 
against the clinical cutoff of > 70 (Sierra and Berrios 2000). This 
consisted of the following steps: (i) linear transformations of in-
dividual items' scores, so as to reflect Sierra and Berrios' (2000) 
original bounds (i.e., 0–6 for frequency items, 1–4 for duration 
items);  (ii)  computation  of  a  global  CDS  score  by  summing  up 
all  individual  items'  scores;  and  (iii)  comparison  of  the  global 
CDS  score  against  the  established  clinical  cutoff.  The  proce-
dure  led  to  identifying  152/160  (95%)  participants  scoring > 70 
(M = 161.00,  SD = 45.40),  suggesting  probable  clinical  DPDR, 
while  the  mean  score  across  the  remaining  eight  participants 
(5%) was 62.10 (SD = 7.39).

(t(461) = −3.83,  pFDR < 0.001,

openness  to  experience  (t(461) = 2.84,  pFDR = 0.007,  d = 0.28), 
loneliness  (t(461) = 6.40,  pFDR < 0.001,  d = 0.63),  antagonism 
(t(461) = 3.18,  pFDR = 0.003,  d = 0.31),  detachment  (t(461) = 6.26, 
pFDR < 0.001,  d = 0.61),  disinhibition  (t(461) = 3.10,  pFDR = 0.003, 
d = 0.30),  negative  affect  (t(394.74) = 9.72,  pFDR < 0.001,  d = 0.91), 
psychoticism  (t(461) = 14.58,  pFDR < 0.001,  d = 1.42),  and  support 
(t(374.38) = −2.81, pFDR < 0.001, d = −0.27). A detailed visual rep-
resentation of the results is available as Figure S1.

Results  from  separate  graphical  models  showed  moderate 
and  positive  associations  between  psychoticism  and  negative 
affect,  between  psychoticism  and  disinhibition,  and  a  nega-
tive  association  between  psychoticism  and  conscientiousness. 
However,  in  Controls,  but  not  in  DPDR,  psychoticism  was  
positively  associated  with  detachment  and  antagonism. 
Openness  was  negatively  associated  with  detachment 
in  
both groups, whereas in Controls, openness was also positively 
associated  with  extraversion,  agreeableness,  and  psychoticism. 
Perceived  support  was  negatively  associated  with  detachment 
and loneliness in both groups; only in Controls, perceived support 
was positively associated with extraversion and agreeableness.

Both  networks  showed  satisfactory  and  approximately  com-
parable 
levels  of  average  predictability  (DPDR = 0.41  vs. 
Controls = 0.48)  and  distributions  between  groups,  with  neu-
roticism (0.58 and 0.68) and extraversion (0.54 and 0.55) being 
the  most  predictable  nodes  and  perceived  support  (0.14  and 
0.26) and loneliness (0.29 and 0.39) among the least predictable 
ones.  Community  detection  was  acceptable  for  DPDR  but  not 
Controls  (QDPDR = 0.42  vs.  QControls = 0.23),  and  for  this  reason, 
it was decided to avoid comparisons related to latent clustering. 
Centrality estimates were stable in Controls but less so in DPDR 
(CSEI,DPDR = 0.30;  CSEI,Controls = 0.70).  Regarding  EI  estimates 
from  the  joint  model,  the  highest  values  were  for  negative  af-
fect (2.00 vs. 2.13), psychoticism (1.64 vs. 1.33), and neuroticism 
(0.37  vs.  0.30),  in  both  groups.  However,  loneliness  was  found 
to be lowly central in Controls (−0.50) and averagely central in 
DPDR  (−0.18).  Figure  1  represents  the  jointly  estimated  net-
works. Supporting Information 1 includes a detailed weight ma-
trix (Table S4). Supporting Information 1 includes line plots of 
EI centrality estimates (Figure S2).

The visual inspection of the jointly estimated networks showed 
a greater level of association between psychoticism and agree-
ableness  in  DPDR  versus  Controls,  whereas  in  Controls,  the 
negative  association  between  openness  and  disinhibition  and 
the  positive  association  between  openness  and  perceived  sup-
port observed in DPDR were inverted in sign. The link between 
negative affect and detachment was negative in DPDR and posi-
tive in Controls. However, no significant differences were found 
between  DPDR  and  Controls  in  network  structure  (M = 0.25, 
p = 0.07)  or  edges,  but  a  significant  difference  was  found  in 
global EI (S = 1.61, p = 0.03; EIDPDR = −0.86, EIControls = 0.76) (see 
Supporting Information 1, Tables S5 and S6).

These  results  overall  indicate  no  substantial  differences  in  the 
way  personality  dispositions  are  conditionally  associated  in  a 
sample  of  individuals  with  DPDR  versus  a  general  population

sample. However, large mean differences were observed in psy-
choticism  and  negative  affect,  followed  by  FFM  neuroticism, 
perceptions of loneliness, and PID- 5 detachment. The effects ob-
served for support, antagonism, disinhibition, openness to expe-
rience, and conscientiousness were significant but comparatively 
small. Overall, these findings prompted further investigation of 
the  conditional  associations  between  DPDR  traits,  personality, 
perceived support, and loneliness in individuals with DPDR.

3   |   Study 2—Methods

3.1   |   Participants and Procedure

Study 2 used the same dataset from Study 1, including a sample 
of 160 individuals with self- reported DPDR (see previous para-
graphs for a detailed description).

3.2   |   Materials and Measures

Study 2 used the same measures of personality, perceived social 
support and loneliness, and DPDR as Study 1. Additionally, the 
analysis used two separate DPDR scores, obtained by averaging 
CDS frequency and CDS duration scores, respectively, to model 
multivariate conditional dependencies between these important 
aspects  of  DPDR,  personality,  and  perceptions  of  support  and 
loneliness.

3.3   |   Analytic Approach

Study 2 used a graphical modeling approach and the same es-
timation methods used in Study 1. For centrality, in addition to 

EI, Bridge EI (BEI) was also used and the relevant CS computed. 
BEI is a measure indicating the sum of the edges extending from 
a given node and the indirect effect of a node on external com-
munities through other nodes (Jones, Ma, and McNally 2021).

3.4   |   Results and Discussion

The  results  from  network  analysis  showed  that  DPDR  fre-
quency and duration were positively and highly associated, as 
expected. DPDR frequency was also moderately and positively 
associated with psychoticism, detachment, subjective feelings 
of  loneliness,  and  negative  affect.  DPDR  duration  was  only 
positively  associated  with  psychoticism,  besides  its  relation-
ship with DPDR frequency. Psychoticism was, in turn, nega-
tively  associated  with  conscientiousness  and  positively  with 
disinhibition and with negative affect. Figure 2 represents the 
network model.

Four latent communities were identified as best candidates to 
represent the graphical model (Q = 0.47), renamed and summa-
rized as follows: (i) Agreeableness, identified by agreeableness 
and  antagonism;  (ii)  Self- regulation,  including  conscientious-
ness  and  disinhibition;  (iii) Dissociation,  including  DPDR  fre-
quency  and  duration  and  psychoticism;  (iv)  Emotional  and 
Interpersonal  Stability,  including  neuroticism,  extraversion, 
openness to experience, negative affect, detachment, perceived 
support,  and  loneliness.  Antagonism  (EI = −0.12,  BEI = 0.05), 
disinhibition (EI = −0.23, BEI = 0.01), negative affect (EI = 0.24, 
BEI = 0.02),  and  DPDR  frequency  (EI = 0.63,  BEI = 0.11)  were 
the most central nodes within their relevant communities, al-
though  detachment  (EI = −0.07,  BEI = 0.09)  and  psychoticism 
(EI = 0.16, BEI = 0.08) showed the highest BEI, indicating their 
potential  mediating  role  between  communities.  However,  EI

(CS = 0.65)  but  not  BEI  (CS = 0.15)  showed  satisfactory  stabil-
ity,  requiring  caution  in  the  interpretation  of  BEI.  The  net-
work  showed  acceptable  predictability  across  all  nodes  (46%). 
Supporting Information 1 includes line plots of centrality esti-
mates (Figure S3).

These  findings  suggest  a  role  for  psychoticism  in  DPDR, 
namely,  a  tendency  to  experience  egodystonic  inner/outer 
states  that  may  prevent  individuals  with  DPDR  from  ade-
quately regulating their inner perceptions with environmental 
and  contextual  factors  (Piedmont  et  al.  2009).  Psychoticism 
may predispose individuals to a chaotic organization of their 
subjective experience, an inability to codify and appraise dif-
ferent  types  of  stimuli,  and  a  cycle  of  emotional  instability, 
anxiety,  and  rumination,  commonly  observed  in  individuals 
with  DPDR  symptoms  (Medford  et  al.  2005).  This  further 
helps  explain  the  anxiety  and  sense  of  impairment  that 
these  individuals  often  report.  On  a  related  note,  the  analy-
sis  showed  that  detachment  was  external  to  the  community 
of  dissociative  traits,  challenging  the  idea  that  DP  and  DR 
cluster with generic tendencies to withdrawal or detachment 
from  internal/external  stimuli,  rather,  they  may  reflect  spe-
cific  dispositions  to  a  dysregulated  perception  and  impaired 
appraisal of them (Ciaunica et al. 2022; Medford et al.  2005; 
Soffer- Dudek 2023).

4   |   Study 3—Methods

4.1   |   Participants and Procedure

Study 3 was based on data from an opportunity sample of adult 
individuals with self- reported DPDR. Similarly to studies 1 and 
2, participants were recruited in collaboration with Unreal. To be 
eligible to participate, individuals had to be ≥ 18 years and have 
a self- reported history of DPDR. The same screening procedure 
used in Study 2 was used in Study 3. Participation was voluntary 
and  required  the  following,  in  order:  (i)  read  and  understand  a 
detailed  information  sheet:  (ii)  sign  an  electronic  consent  form 

and  complete  a  short  online  survey  via  Qualtrics;  (iii)  attend  a 
~60- min online interview via Microsoft Teams. Interviews were 
conducted by the principal investigator (first author of the present 
manuscript)  and  a  research  assistant  (second  author)  and  were 
based on a semi- structured protocol that required participants to 
engage with storytelling on targeted aspects of their lived experi-
ence of DPDR. Data saturation was achieved when the research-
ers considered the quantity and quality of the information to be 
adequate to answer the research questions and make any further 
data and coding redundant (Fusch and Ness 2015).

When taking the online survey, participants were asked to an-
swer a set of demographic and other questions, including the 
CDS. They were invited to consent to establish a link between 
their  survey  data  and  interview  transcripts  by  means  of  a 
unique identifier of their choosing. Nineteen individuals com-
pleted the procedure (n = 13 UK residents, and n = 6 residents 
in other countries). The sample included n = 6 females (31.58%; 
Mage = 33.20, SDage = 13.60), n = 4 males (21.05%; Mage = 35.80, 
SDage = 14.20), and  n = 4 individuals who preferred not to re-
port  their  gender  (21.05%;  Mage = 24.90,  SDage = 5.43).  Some 
participants  (n = 5,  26.31%)  could  not  retrieve  their  unique 
identifier  at  the  time  of  the  interview,  making  their  demo-
graphics  and  CDS  data  unknown.  Post  hoc  analysis  showed 
that all participants who reported their identifier at the time 
of  the  interview,  and  for  whom  CDS  data  were  available, 
scored > 70  at  the  CDS,  indicating  probable  clinical  DPDR. 
The procedure was reviewed and obtained favorable opinion 
from  the  institutional  ethics  committee  of  the  second,  third, 
and  fifth  authors.  Supporting  Information  1  include  addi-
tional demographic information of participants (Table S7).

4.2   |   Analytic Approach and Materials

Study 3 used a qualitative methodology to explore participants' 
characteristic  adaptations  to  DPDR  and  narrative  identity 
reconstructions,  aiming  to  map  their  journey  through  mak-
ing  sense  of,  adapting  to,  and  coping  with  DPDR,  answering 

802

Journal of Personality, 2025

the  questions  as  to  whether/how  DPDR  affects  their  sense  of 
who  they  are,  the  beliefs  in  their  own  capacity  to  influence 
the  course  of  their  lives,  and  their  relationships  with  others. 
This methodology is informed by the theoretical framework of 
the Life Story Model of Identity (LSMI) (McAdams 1988, 2018) 
and  Complex  Adaptive  System  (CAS;  Kerr  2019).  The  LSMI 
and  CAS  posit  nonlinear  dynamical  trajectories  of  individual 
development,  highlighting  the  unique,  complex,  and  multifac-
eted nature of one's characteristic adaptations to life events and 
identity reconstructions. Characteristic adaptations and identity 
reconstructions articulate across distinctive topical themes that 
underlie  individuals'  narratives,  namely:  redemption  (i.e.,  neg-
ative/positive  life  transitions),  contamination  (the  opposite  of 
redemption),  agency  (perceived  autonomy  and  influence)  com-
munion  (motivation  to  form  and  maintain  interpersonal/inti-
mate relationships and group affiliations, including the sense of 
belonging and identification that individuals derive from them), 
self- exploration (reflecting upon oneself through reconstructing 
and narrating own stories), coherent resolution (coherent narra-
tive  closure/ending),  and  meaning- making  (integrating  narra-
tive themes into subjective meaning, purpose, and prospective 
action) (Kerr 2019; McAdams and McLean 2013).

Specifically,  the  study's  analytic  approach  consisted  of  a 
mixed  inductive/deductive  thematic  analysis  (see  Braun  and 
Clarke  2021),  which  allowed  for  a  comprehensive  and  flexible 
exploration  of  the  themes  underlying  participants'  narratives 
while using the LMSI/CAS framework as an aid in coding and 
interpretation. For this purpose, an ad- hoc semi- structured in-
terview protocol was designed and used to collect data, which 
included a series of pre- established prompts of autobiographical 
recollections  of  participants'  experience  of  DPDR  (e.g.,  onset, 
development, management of symptoms), characteristic adapta-
tions (e.g., attributional beliefs and coping strategies), and narra-
tive identity reconstructions (e.g., whether/how DPDR affected 
their sense of who they are, their agency and communion).

Data generation, thematic analysis, and interpretation involved 
the  following  steps,  in  order:  (i)  online  interviews,  conducted 
and  recorded  online,  via  Microsoft  Teams,  with  participants 
clearly  being  informed  about  the  recording  and  requested  to 
provide  their  consent  ahead  of  the  scheduled  appointment. 
The  interviews  were  automatically  transcribed  via  Microsoft's 
Transcription  and  Closed  Captions  functions;  (ii)  the  second 
author of the manuscript manually reviewed the transcriptions 
across two rounds of revisions, checking the completeness and 
accuracy of the text against the content of the audio files and en-
suring that any identifiable information was omitted and pseud-
onymized,  when  required;  (iii)  the  first  and  second  authors  of 
the manuscript familiarized themselves with the data by engag-
ing in multiple readings of the interview transcripts, then, they 
iteratively coded narratives into themes across a series of both 
individual and group sessions, reviewed the coding as the anal-
ysis progressed, and discussed the findings until consensus was 
achieved  about  the  redundancy  of  any  further  coding  and  in-
terpretations; (iv) the first and second authors drafted and com-
pleted  the  report  of  findings,  which  was  eventually  reviewed 
and approved by all authors.

4.3   |   Results and Discussion

Four main themes were identified, reflecting participants' nar-
rative identity reconstructions, summarized as follows: (i) “How 
it  started  and  what  happened  next”:  DPDR  onset  as  a  major 
life turning point and contaminator; (ii) “Why me?” Meaning- 
making, exploratory narratives associated with the lived expe-
rience of DPDR; (iii) “The more you think about it, the worse it 
gets”: Coping strategies, tentative redemptions, and failed reso-
lutions. In the following paragraphs, these themes are explored 
and evaluated in- depth, supported by a selection of participants' 
quotes.  Supporting  Information  1  include  a  summary  table  of 
themes (Table S8).

4.3.1   |   Theme 1: “How It Started and What Happened 
Next”: DPDR Onset as a Major Life Turning Point 
and Contaminator

Most  participants  dated  back  the  onset  of  DPDR  symptoms  to 
either  childhood  or  teenage  years,  describing  the  condition  in 
terms of a contamination scene, that is, major negative turning 
points  in  their  lives.  Narratives  were  commonly  characterized 
by feelings of surprise and unprecedented mental confusion as-
sociated with the appearance of highly disruptive alterations to 
their perception of themselves and their surroundings.

I've been saying since I was tiny, tiny to my parents, 
things  like  I  don't  feel  like  I'm  here.  I  don't  feel  like 
connected to myself. I don't recognize the person in 
the mirror. 

(Laura)

DPDR  was  immediately  perceived  as  intense,  odd,  estranging, 
ultimately  challenging  participants'  ability  to  make  sense  of 
newly  blurred  perceptual  boundaries.  Interestingly,  some  par-
ticipants identified derealization as chronologically antecedent 
to depersonalization. In no cases, participants reported failures 
in reality testing. Most participants early achieved the realiza-
tion  that  symptoms  were  stable,  combined  with  the  emotional 
shock and sometimes even terror of falling onto a characteristic 
cycle of anxiety and rumination associated with them.

Yes.  So,  when  my  symptoms  were  the  worst,  I  was 
obsessing, I thought I had schizophrenia. And I was 
obsessing about that. And I think it was getting worse. 
Even these days, I'm always kind of obsessing about 
self- help and trying to get better. Like, every second, 
I have ruminations about how to fix myself, this kind 
of thing. 

(Jack)

That will then have ripple effects throughout the rest 
of your life. So, I went to university, but it was really 
difficult because these symptoms are getting worse. 
(Toby)

803

This  experience  was  commonly  accompanied  by  an  inability 
to describe, characterize, or simply communicate the nature of 
symptoms,  even  at  a  basic  level.  In  fact,  most  participants  re-
ported major difficulties in interpreting symptoms, to the point 
that attempting to describe them to others was considered chal-
lenging and potentially counterproductive, often relying on the 
belief  that  nobody  could  understand  their  struggle,  especially 
around the time when symptoms first occurred.

Trying  to  see  what  can  be  happening  in  my  life 
that  makes  me  feel  like  this  way  or  something,  but 
I  cannot,  really.  I  haven't  grasped  something  really 
particular that I can think of; that would have been 
of great help to just kind of make these symptoms just 
disappear or fade or something. 

(James)

All  I  could  say  was  I  don't  feel  real.  You  know,  that 
was about the best way I could describe it, actually. I 
was in a hospital undergoing neurological tests to try 
and figure out what was going on, and I'm, like, “I'm 
not  crazy,  you  know.  I'm  feeling…  I'm  experiencing 
something real that is unreal at the same time.” And 
it was basically my world becoming two dimensional. 
At least that's the best way I could describe it. 

(Dan)

All participants emphasized the intensity and discomfort asso-
ciated with derealization and the subsequent feeling of alarm of 
losing control or “getting crazy.” Incredulity, dismay, but at the 
same  time,  fixation  on  symptoms  often  led  to  incessant  ques-
tioning over the cohesiveness of one's own self and identity, as 
if the hypothesis that they are actual perceivers and in control 
of their own perceptual processes had to be continuously tested 
(e.g., see Ciaunica et al. 2022). This was often accompanied by 
the  fear,  in  social  interactions,  that  others  may  find  out  about 
this state of absorption and rumination.

For  some  of  them,  this  experience  prompted  greater  existen-
tial concerns about themselves and the world, a theme that is 
well- known in literature (Ciaunica et al. 2023). Moreover, in 
most cases, the incommunicability of symptoms did not seem 
to  improve  or  resolve  through  access  to  primary  or  special-
ized  care,  which  in  turn,  triggered  feelings  of  isolation  and 
hopelessness.

I'd  go  and  speak  to  medical  professionals,  and  no 
one would have a clue what it was. It was everything 
from  being  completely  dismissed  and  the  doctor 
gets  up  and  shows  you  the  door  and  goes  “it's 
probably nothing, get out.” But I need help and it's 
just  like  “you  don't  get  it,  do  you”?  Complete  lack 
of awareness in medical communities, which when 
you're  going  through  something  you  don't  know 
what it is, and no one can tell you. That's ten times 
worse than having a name for it, but the terror of not 
knowing what it was! 

(Toby)

4.3.2   |   Theme 2: “Why Me?” Meaning- Making, 
Exploratory Narratives Associated With the Lived 
Experience of DPDR

Participants'  autobiographical  explorations  associated  the 
onset  and  development  of  DPDR  with  a  diverse  range  of  life 
antecedents.  Some  narratives  pointed  out  the  use  of  recre-
ational  drugs,  while  others  indicated  traumatic  events  (e.g., 
family- related, and emotional struggles, interpersonal conflict 
at  home  or  school),  or  physical  procedures  (e.g.,  hospitaliza-
tions and surgery), whereas a group of them reported no rec-
ollection  whatsoever  as  to  what  might  have  triggered  DPDR. 
In fact, it was common not to comprehensively remember any  
developmental  trauma,  not  even  minor  negative  experiences, 
which  sometimes  made  the  appearance  of  symptoms  even 
more  disorienting,  challenging  individuals'  ability  to  under-
stand and make sense of what and why was happening to them.

So,  when  I  have  a  deep…  when  I  feel  that  loss  of 
identity,  it's  very  hard  to  connect  with  others,  and  I 
can…. I remember… I can, like, I don't know what to 
say  to  people  and  I  feel  very…  yeah,  it's  not  natural 
anymore. So, I feel very disconnected, and I feel like 
I'm  just  pretending  to  have  social  interactions  […].  I 
don't  know  if  this  is  caused  by  my  symptoms,  but  I 
feel detached, and you share less things with others. 
And maybe I don't display a lot of emotions. And this 
has been a kind of a problem in some relationships. 

(Jack)

4.3.3   |   Theme 3: “The More You Think About It, 
the Worse It Gets”: Coping Strategies, Tentative 
Redemptions, and Failed Resolutions

Characteristic adaptations found in the study can be divided 
into  two  main  sub- themes,  respectively  related  to  the  man-
agement  of  short- term  feelings  of  anxiety,  rumination,  and 
fear,  especially  during  acute  episodes,  and  long- term  coping 
strategies and approaches to recovery. Regarding the former, 
a  common  sense- based  approach  that  reportedly  helped  re-
lieve  symptoms  was  distraction.  This  involves  engaging  in 
mundane tasks, everyday activities, and conversations, which 
several participants reported as helping them at least tempo-
rarily re- focus their mind upon external/contextual elements 
versus  their  altered  inner  experiences,  achieving  some  form 
of  intero- exteroceptive  integration  that  they  experienced  as 
“normal,”  ultimately  carrying  a  knock- on  positive  effect  on 
their well- being.

So,  usually,  when  I'm  not  being  introspective,  when 
I'm not thinking in my head and when I force myself 
to  be  to  think  outwardly  and  to  focus  on  outward 
things  and  kind  of  preoccupy  my  mind.  That's 
when  my  mind  gets  the  mental  relief  that  it  needs 
to  decompress  and  to  recover.  So,  if  I  do  something 

804

Journal of Personality, 2025

that  stimulates  my  mind  outwardly,  like  an  action, 
rather than a thought, then that helps me. So, if I get 
up from where I'm sitting and I tidy up, or if I get up 
and I walk outside, or if I do something that is a really 
interest of mine or that actually captures my attention 
– which is hard when you've got DPDR – such as arts, 
or  cooking,  or  something  creative  and  expressive, 
that helps me process emotions and give my mind a 
break as well. Helps the symptoms kind of, you know, 
alleviate a little bit. 

(Rose)

Some even explicitly argued that coping with DPDR “does not 
work  like  that,”  referring  to  the  potential  risk  of  continuously 
paying  attention  to  and  of  talking  about  the  problem  to  act  as 
a  trigger  and  reinforce  the  frequency  and  duration  of  symp-
toms, versus the benefits of accepting the condition, almost as if  
losing  interest  in  the  incessant  and  ruminative  nature  of  
symptoms  and  carrying  on  with  life  helped  sustain  their 
well- being.

It's  something  that  I  live  with.  It's  like  a  chronic 
condition.  As  I'm  getting  older,  I'm  experiencing 
all sorts of physical things as a result of being older 
and at the time, you know, I hurt a part of my body 
running.  At  the  time,  I  thought,  I  cannot  live  like 
this. I cannot live with the constant pain. Five years 
down the line, it still hurts, but I deal with it. It just 
becomes your new normal. So, that's exactly how I 
treat the depersonalization, that it's just my baseline 
state. And if I think about it, it stresses me out. So, 
I don't  think  about it. That is the general  way that 
I cope. 

(Liz)

As for long- term coping and approaches to recovery, narratives 
highlighted diverse and not always coherent reports of experi-
ences. A common positive turning point in narratives coincided 
with  hearing  or  learning  about  symptoms  called  “derealiza-
tion”  or  “depersonalization,”  to  the  point  that  most  of  partici-
pants could all exactly remember when and how that happened 
(most often, through the Internet), and the feelings of validation 
henceforth associated with it.

I ended up, I think, when I was… honestly… 15, I found 
– it was like a forum or a chat online, quite an obscure 
one – but it was people talking about DPDR, and all of 
the things they were saying were basically describing 
my  situation  exactly.  So,  I  ended  up  sort  of  talking 
with  them,  and  they  were,  like:  “yeah,  that  sounds 
exactly like what I'm going through.” So that was very 
much  like  a  turning  point  of,  okay,  like,  you're  not 
crazy.  It's  genuinely  something  people  know  about 
and can quantify, and you can understand it. 

(Ola)

Narratives  commonly  highlighted  that  knowing  about  DPDR 
often was associated to a subsequent failed redemption, that is, 
an unmet promise of recovery by circumstances and actors that 
did not help.

I  haven't  ever  been  diagnosed.  I've  been  trying  to 
for  the  longest  time,  but  I  feel  like  I've  been  sort 
of  misunderstood,  like  I  go  to  my  GP  [General 
Practitioner]  about  it,  and  they  just  refer  me  to 
somewhere  else  and  they  don't  really  know  what  to 
do  with  me.  Like,  I've  been  through,  I  think,  every 
therapy service in […] that I can for free, and they've 
said  “You're  not  making  any  improvements.  Your 
questionnaire results are exactly the same as when we 
started this, three months ago.” I don't think they're 
really equipped to understand or deal with these sort 
of symptoms, and no one really seems to know what 
to do about it. 

(Lara)

Regarding  treatments,  eye- movement  desensitization  therapy, 
cognitive- behavioral  counseling  and  forms  of  psychotherapy 
seemed to work for some, but frequently, reportedly to a limited 
extent. However, participants' stories mostly often indicated ex-
periences with healthcare and mental health professionals who 
were perceived as unprepared to recognize, diagnose, and treat 
DPDR,  sometimes  reportedly  recommending  ineffective  reme-
dies, which ended up reinforcing feelings of hopelessness, lone-
liness, and isolation.

4.3.4   |   Theme 4: “It's Kind of Hindered Things for Me”: 
DPDR, Disrupted Agency, and Communion

Participants  articulated  agency  and  communion  as  inherently 
intertwined  and  mutually  reinforcing  themes  in  their  experi-
ence of DPDR. In this regard, their stories associated the DPDR- 
related perception of losing control with the belief of not being 
able to function interpersonally or even experiencing any form 
of affection towards others. Metaphors such as feeling like liv-
ing “in a dream” or “like a robot” were common and associated 
with poor general and interpersonal self- efficacy beliefs. Often, 
these beliefs seemed to consolidate into negative self- esteem and 
a diminished sense of self and identity, which in turn, prompted 
self- descriptions  and  categorizations  in  terms  of  a  mentally 
“impaired”  or  “broken”  person,  underlying  feelings  of  shame 
and  internalized  stigma,  ultimately  worsening  the  experience 
of DPDR.

If I am feeling really spaced out, or really, like really 
derealized,  really  depersonalized.  I  think,  because 
it  feels  so,  I  feel  so  disconnected  from  myself.  I  just 
struggle  to  do  anything  that  revolves  around  my 
personality.  So,  if  I'm  meeting  a  new  person,  then  I 
suddenly get a sort of, don't know, I feel like it comes 
in waves, almost. If I get like a wave of derealization or 
something like that I feel like I'm speaking on behalf 

805

of someone else, because there's a disconnect between 
me speaking and me because of the derealization. So, 
it's like I can't introduce myself properly, ‘cause I feel 
like I'm… I'm talking on behalf of someone else. Yeah, 
so that could usually end up with me embarrassingly 
explaining why this is happening. 

(Ola)

symptoms and enhancing individuals' agency and well- being. 
Forms  of  effective  support  were  reportedly  characterized  by 
others'  awareness  of  participants'  struggles  with  DPDR  and 
a  contemporaneous  empathetic,  non- judgmental,  and  lenient 
acceptance  of  it,  which  often  served  the  basis  for  reinstating 
agency and help participants find forms of meaning and pur-
pose in life.

Forms  of  negative  identifications  are  described  in  the  litera-
ture  in  terms  of  a  “curse”  (Schury,  Nater,  and  Häusser  2020): 
Individuals naturally aspire to pursue and preserve a positive, 
continuous, and distinctive self, which in turn, revolves around 
the  perceptions  that  are  most  salient  in  one's  own  experience 
(Ryan  and  Deci  2001).  Accordingly,  most  participants  in  the 
present study reported difficulties in establishing a sense of self 
and identity that goes beyond the pervasive experience of being 
someone  who  lives  with  DPDR,  which  in  turn,  affected  their 
view  of  themselves  as  effective  agents  over  a  range  of  life  do-
mains (e.g., social networking, education, work) and prevented 
them from setting and pursuing a vast number of life goals. For 
example,  some  reported  that  living  with  DPDR  had  impaired 
their  ability  to  cope  with  everyday  tasks  and  maintain  stable 
interpersonal  relationships,  pursue  group  memberships,  affili-
ations, and career goals.

I tend to steer away from most people because, uhm, 
with DPDR It's really difficult to have a conversation. 
Sometimes,  I  get  frozen  with  anxiety.  I  don't  know 
what  to  say  in  conversations,  and  people  tend  to 
dismiss me quite easily. So, yeah, I've struggled a lot. 
It's stopped me from trusting people in relationships 
because I can't feel present in the moment. I believe 
it's  stopped  me  from  having  a  husband  and  kids. 
Yeah. And it's also stopping me from being a teacher, 
which is what I really want to do, as well. 

(Rose)

This might also help explain why some participants considered 
talking about DPDR as dysfunctional, often triggering a sort of 
“contagion”  and  reinforcement  of  the  symptomology,  that  is, 
what  previous  literature  described  in  terms  of  a  transmission 
of  a  mental  response  from  a  distressed  individual  to  an  ob-
server via verbal and non- verbal interaction (Schury, Nater, and 
Häusser 2020).

Don't want to be around anybody has a mental illness. 
That's  a  no.  It  just  brings  me  down.  But  you  know, 
cause I don't want to be sitting around this: “let's talk 
about our mental illness.” No, that's not what I want. 
When  you  talk  about  it,  it's  there,  it's  part  of  mine. 
That's not what. I want, it's not what runs my life. 

(Dan)

Nevertheless,  when  available,  support  offered  by  close  ones 
(e.g., family, romantic partners, friends) seemed to mitigate the 
negative impact of identifying as someone living with the con-
dition  by  reducing  the  perception  of  disruptiveness  of  DPDR 

Oh,  yeah,  and  it  really  helps  me.  Yeah.  Really  helps 
me to share. So very few people know that I feel this, 
but  for  example,  my  boyfriend  really  understands.  I 
think  he  really  is  a  very  big  support.  So,  even  on  a 
daily  basis,  I  like  to  tell  him,  like,  today  I'm  feeling 
a  little  bit  more  decent,  and  It's  reassuring  to  know 
that, OK, he knows that; he has this information and 
maybe he will also try to help me. So, it really helps 
to share.

5   |   General Discussion

The aim of the present research was  to  explore  individual dif-
ferences  in  DPDR  by  means  of  three  studies,  respectively  (i) 
comparing  mean  differences,  topology,  and  interconnectivity 
of  dispositional  broadband  traits  (FFM),  perceived  social  sup-
port  and  loneliness,  and  maladaptive  trait  domains  (PID- 5)  in 
individuals  with  DPDR  versus  individuals  from  the  general 
population;  (ii)  evaluate  a  network  of  broadband/maladaptive 
traits,  perceptions  of  social  support  and  loneliness,  and  DPDR 
traits  (frequency/duration)  in  individuals  with  self- reported 
DPDR; and (iii) explore characteristic adaptations to DPDR and 
narrative identities of people with lived experience of the con-
dition.  The  results  of  Study  1  showed  significant  mean  differ-
ences across all variables, with greater effect sizes observed for 
psychoticism and negative affect, followed by neuroticism, lone-
liness, and detachment. The visual inspection of the jointly es-
timated networks showed a greater level of association between 
psychoticism and agreeableness in individuals with DPDR ver-
sus  Controls  from  the  general  population.  Negative  affect  and 
detachment were negatively correlated in DPDR and positively 
in Controls. However, significant differences were not found be-
tween network structures or edges, but in the global centrality 
of nodes, that is, the total level of nodes' interconnectivity. Study 
2  expanded  the  results  from  Study  1  by  re- analyzing  the  data 
from  the  DPDR  sample  in  a  way  to  prioritize  the  study  of  the 
relationships  between  DPDR  traits  (frequency  and  duration  of 
symptoms) and the organization of the network in latent clus-
ters  or  communities.  The  results  showed  a  community  of  dis-
sociative  tendencies  formed  by  interrelations  between  DPDR 
traits and psychoticism. Another latent community of emotional 
stability was connected to DPDR through detachment, whereas 
conscientiousness and disinhibition formed a third community 
of self- regulation connected with DPDR traits through psychoti-
cism. Lastly, Study 3 investigated characteristic adaptations and 
narrative identity reconstructions by exploring and interpreting 
the main themes underlying stories of DPDR lived experiences. 
Expectedly, the onset and development of DPDR was commonly 
indicated  as  a  major  episode  of  contamination,  that  is,  a  key

life  transition  from  a  condition  of  well- being  to  a  pathological 
state, with narratives pointing out incommunicability, and sub-
sequently,  disrupted  agency  and  isolation  as  crucial  themes  to 
understand  the  struggle  with  building  up  a  coherent,  distinc-
tive, and continuous sense of self for those affected by the con-
dition.  Misdiagnosis  and  ineffective  treatments  were  reported 
as  common  and  reinforcing  the  cycle  of  perceptual  dysregula-
tion/anxiety/rumination/isolation  that  characterizes  DPDR, 
whereas  distraction  and  self/other  acceptance  were  associated 
with short-  and long- term benefits, including a greater sense of 
agency, better interpersonal relationships, enhanced social sup-
port, and self- actualization.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first research 
that  has  investigated  individual  differences  in  DPDR  using 
a  theoretical  framework  that  integrates  trait  theory  with  the 
LSMI (McAdams 1988, 2018) and CAS (Kerr 2019) perspectives. 
These results indicate individual differences in perceptual dys-
regulation  as  key  in  DPDR  and  shed  light  on  the  maladaptive 
organization of personality traits in those affected by the condi-
tion. The findings of the present research align with recent lit-
erature that points out perceptual dysregulation as an essential 
mechanism in the interpretation of DPDR symptoms (Ciaunica 
et  al.  2022,  2023),  summarized  by  the  relationships  between 
DPDR traits and PID- 5 psychoticism, which previous literature 
had  already  found  in  association  with  dissociative  tendencies 
(Ashton et al. 2012). They highlight that although the structure 
and edges of the network of those living with DPDR may not sig-
nificantly differ from counterparts from the general population, 
specific  links  between  DPDR  and  maladaptive  trait  domains 
of  personality  exist.  Regarding  the  non- significant  differences 
observed in network structures and edges, three possible expla-
nations  are  offered,  as  follows:  (i)  measurement  variance  may 
play a role, warranting replication of results through alternative 
measures  of  broadband  and  maladaptive  personality;  (ii)  indi-
vidual differences in DPDR may be detected at the level of the 
location of individuals upon latent traits' continua, rather than 
in the relationships between traits; and (iii) despite the effort to 
recruit  from  a  hard- to- reach  population,  the  sample  size  may 
not  ensure  sensitivity  to  detect  smaller  effects.  Nevertheless, 
the latent community formed by DPDR traits and psychoticism 
in the present study's sample highlights the characterization of 
DPDR in terms of patterns of odd thinking and dystonic self and 
world- perceptions,  confirming  findings  from  recent  research 
(Ciaunica et al. 2023; Piedmont et al. 2009). Dysregulated per-
ception  prompts  a  chaotic  organization  of  the  subjective  expe-
rience, an inability to adequately codify and appraise different 
types of inner and outer stimuli, prompting a cycle of anxiety, 
obsessive  rumination,  disrupted  self- esteem  and  poor  be-
liefs of self- efficacy, and social isolation (Medford et al. 2005). 
Moreover,  the  findings  from  the  present  study  showed  that 
PID- 5  detachment  was  external  to  the  community  of  dissocia-
tive traits, supporting the idea that DPDR may represent a form 
of hyperfocus on perceptual experiences, whereas withdrawal, 
anhedonia, and intimacy avoidance may be second- hand prod-
ucts  of  the  impact  of  DPDR  on  individuals  rather  than  a  pri-
mary characterization of the condition. Nevertheless, the results 
from Study 1 showed a negative association between openness 
and  disinhibition  in  individuals  with  DPDR  and  a  positive  as-
sociation  between  the  latter  and  psychoticism.  Higher  levels 

of  antagonism,  disinhibition,  and  openness  to  experience,  and 
lower levels of conscientiousness were also found in the DPDR 
group versus individuals from the general population. However, 
when considered in association with DPDR traits, in Study 2, the 
link  between  psychoticism  and  disinhibition  disappeared,  and 
the differences between edges in Study 1 were not significant, 
anyway. On the other hand, a consistent positive association be-
tween  disinhibition  and  psychoticism  was  found  in  both  stud-
ies, which may explain a tendency to unrestrained and unusual 
forms  of  thinking  observed  in  DPDR.  These  results  support 
previous  literature  that  showed  associations  between  experi-
ential permeability (Piedmont et al. 2009), defined in terms of 
the “ability of an individual to regulate interactions between the 
inner world of experiences and the outer reality of activities and 
relationships” (p. 1247), and psychoticism, schizotypy, dissocia-
tive  experiences,  and  also  sleep  problems,  regardless  of  stress 
levels (Tan et al. 2018). In particular, these findings suggest that 
DPDR may be associated, on the one hand, with a tendency to-
wards intellectual curiosity and perceptual stimulation, and on 
the other hand, with an orientation towards unrestrained forms 
of thinking. Consistently, Ashton et al. (2012) found that open-
ness and psychoticism were lowly but significantly loaded onto 
a single latent factor of schizotypal and dissociative tendencies. 
High  levels  of  psychoticism  and  openness  to  experience  may 
therefore be implicated in individual differences in DPDR, pos-
sibly entailing a characteristic inability to set functional bound-
aries between inner and outer stimuli that end up challenging 
an individual's natural mastery of one's own thoughts and per-
ceptions (Ciaunica et al. 2022). In addition, there is a known link 
between openness and overt rebelliousness, which may further 
explain  the  results  of  high  antagonism  and  low  consciousness 
found  in  the  present  study  and  corroborate  the  idea  of  over-
laps  between  DPDR  and  experiential  permeability  (Piedmont 
et al. 2009).

Regarding  characteristic  adaptations  and  narrative  identity 
reconstructions,  participants  described  DPDR  in  terms  of  a 
major  life  contaminator,  that  is,  a  turning  point  that  deter-
mined  a  critical  transition  from  a  positive  to  a  negative  life 
condition, in all cases, yet to be resolved. This aligns with the-
oretical  perspectives  considering  individual  difficulty  in  the 
integration of trauma experience and narratives where disso-
ciation is experienced potentially leading to feelings of expe-
riential  contamination  and  exacerbating  distress  (McAdams 
et al. 2001). The difficulty in making sense of the new expe-
rience  of  blurred  boundaries  between  oneself  and  one's  sur-
roundings was central in participants' reports of derealization. 
Although presenting some variations in scenes and characters, 
all participants shared stories of strain and distress in adapt-
ing  to  this  experience,  perceived  as  shocking  and  constantly 
threatening to their sense of self, which in turn, affected their 
ability  to  bond,  pursue  educational/work  attainments,  and 
construct a positive and functional social identity. Some cop-
ing  strategies  were  mentioned  and  explored;  however,  most 
often, they proved ineffective, especially considering the diffi-
culties experienced in communicating symptoms with others, 
including healthcare professionals.

Nevertheless, diversion, emotional closeness, and empathic ac-
ceptance by others provided some forms of relief and support to 

807

those with DPDR. Furthermore, most participants reported ob-
sessive/intrusive thoughts and hyperfocus on their dysregulated 
perception  as  characterizing  their  experience  of  DPDR.  The 
link between obsessive and compulsive forms of thinking and 
reinforcement  of  DPDR  symptoms  is  known  in  the  literature 
(Ciaunica  et  al.  2023;  Medford  et  al.  2005;  Soffer- Dudek  2023; 
Torch 1978). However, their role in the onset and development 
of DPDR may have been long overlooked. Future research may 
benefit from investigating whether these tendencies correspond 
to a premorbid obsessive- compulsive personality configuration 
rather  than  a  comorbid  obsessive- compulsive  disorder.  This 
may  help  test  hypotheses  on  outcomes  of  interventions  target-
ing obsessive and ruminative thinking to help break the cycle of 
hyperfocus on estranged perceptions that characterize the expe-
rience of DPDR.

These results also suggest other potential pathways for assess-
ment and intervention for DPDR. First, they indicate that PID- 5 
psychoticism  represents  a  useful  target  to  integrate  with  spe-
cific  measures  of  DPDR  traits,  an  aid  in  clinical  settings  that 
may  help  improve  the  timing  and  accuracy  of  assessment  and 
diagnosis. Second, they suggest that breaking the vicious cycle 
of perceptual exploration and rumination may also help achiev-
ing  better  therapeutical  outcomes.  Nevertheless,  they  indicate 
that counseling and psychotherapy should also target feelings of 
loneliness and social isolation that were found to be significantly 
higher in the DPDR sample versus individuals from the general 
population, perhaps by helping those affected by the condition 
find  forms  of  social  bonding  that  foster  acceptance  and  emo-
tional support.

In conclusion, the present research highlights individual differ-
ences in perceptual dysregulation as characterizing the experi-
ence of DPDR, as indicated by the large effect found in the PID- 5 
trait  domain  of  psychoticism  and  the  organization  of  DPDR 
traits and psychoticism into a latent cluster, within the relevant 
network  model.  Moreover,  they  confirm  that  DPDR  signifi-
cantly affects individuals' ability to adapt to and cope with life 
challenges, with most participants reporting disrupted agency, 
communion, and a fragmented identity that hinders their path-
way to well- being and self- actualization.

This  research  has  limitations.  First,  in  recruiting  for  studies 
1  and  2,  no  standard  assessment  was  used  to  screen  partic-
ipants.  This  would  have  strengthened  the  sampling  strategy 
and  helped  differentiate  individuals  with  stable  symptomol-
ogy from others with transient experiences, despite the prob-
able clinical relevance of symptoms in almost the entirety of 
participants, as reported in the previous paragraphs. Second, 
no information about mental health/neurological history was 
collected. Third, the sampling strategy may have favored self- 
selection of individuals with current forms of DPDR, and for 
this  reason,  future  research  comparing  these  findings  with 
data  generated  from  successful  DPDR  recovery  stories  may 
be  of  great  interest  and  value.  Fourth,  the  sample's  size  may 
have  impacted  the  power  to  detect  small  effects  in  the  data, 
and as such, replication in larger samples is warranted. Fifth, 
the  study  was  cross- sectional,  limiting  the  type  of  inference 
being  pursued.  Lastly,  the  study  did  not  consider  a  range  of 
additional  constructs  that  could  inform  the  understanding 

of  individual  differences  in  DPDR,  for  example,  experiential 
permeability and obsessive- compulsive personality, which as 
discussed,  have  the  potential  to  inform  future  research,  as-
sessment, and intervention.
