Abstract

Background: Sexual desire and sexual activity are natural needs of human beings, which can be problematic and lead to various sexual disorders, 
if not used in the right way, including hypersexuality. The present study aimed to compare the effect of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) 
and aripiprazole drug on marital instability in patients with hypersexuality.

Materials and Methods: This experimental case‑‑control Pretest‑‑Posttest Control Group Design with follow up was done on 27 male and 
female patients with hypersexuality having at least a higher education degree selected from four hospitals and psychiatric centers including 
Khorshid Hospital, Asgariyeh Specialized Hospital, Farhangian Clinic and Imam Reza Medical Center in Isfahan and were randomly assigned 
to two groups of treatment (nine patients in every group) and one group of control (nine patients) after adjusting the age and gender. Pretest 
phase was done for both three groups using Marital Instability Index (MII). The first treatment group underwent DBT intervention for eight 
sessions of 2 hours (once a week), and the second experimental group was prescribed aripiprazole for 2 months. Afterwards, the posttest and 
follow‑up were performed for all the three groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS 24 and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA).

Results:  The  findings  showed  that  DBT  and  aripiprazole  had  little  effect  on  the  problem  of  marital  instability  in  patients  with 
hypersexuality (p > 0.05); also, there was no significant difference between the effect of DBT and aripiprazole (p > 0.05).

Conclusion: DBT and the drug aripiprazole cannot have a significant effect on the marital instability in patients.

IntroductIon
Sexual  desires  and  sexual  activities  are  considered  as  the 
natural  needs  of  human  beings.  However,  if  this  desire  is 
not  used  in  a  right  way,  it  can  be  problematic  and  lead  to 
various sexual disorders. One of these disorders is constantly 
thinking about sex and not controlling one’s sexual behaviors. 
An unquenchable thirst and a compulsion force a person to 
constantly  repeat  acts  such  as  forced  masturbation  or  the 
consumption  of  pornographic  products,  insist  on  finding  a

prostitutes (for example, paying for sex or marital infidelity), 
to have even unhealthy sex, and to satisfy his sexual addiction. 
This behavioral disorder is a hypersexuality that can affect a 
person’s feelings, job, social relationships, and other aspects 
of life.[1]

The prevalence of hypersexuality among men and women is 
almost the same, with the highest prevalence from the ages

of 25 to 55.[2] Hypersexuality, sexual hyperactivity, or sexual 
arousal [sometimes known as sexual addiction, hypersexual 
disorder (HD), compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD), 
sexual compulsivity, and hypersexual behavior] is referred to 
a  sexually  more  capable  behavior  of  a  person  compared  to 
others. This means that in these people the sexual power and 
need  is  such  severe  that  disrupt  their  normal  and  daily  life 
and cause nervousness, drug addiction, and if the person does 
not have access to a sexual partner, it leads to masturbation 
and lack of focus on daily tasks and works.[2,3] Historically, 
there has been debate as to whether hypersexuality should be 
considered an impulse control disorder, behavioral addiction, 
or sexual dysfunction disorder. In recent years, there has been 
a growing consensus on the understanding of hypersexuality, 
largely  due  to  development  of  field  studies  to  diagnose 
hypersexuality and subsequently researchers recommending 
the 5th edition of the book Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM‑V).  During  the  development  of 
the  DSM‑V,  the  diagnosis  of  hypersexuality  was  clinically 
proposed and tested; although it was eventually removed from 
the final version of the DSM‑V, its diagnosis was welcomed 
by many health and clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and 
physicians.[2]

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  there  are  differences 
between  nonparaphilic  hypersexual  behaviors  (referred  to 
as hypersexual) and paraphilic hypersexual behaviors.[4] The 
present study sought to investigate patients having nonparaphilic 
hypersexual behavior.

As  mentioned,  hypersexuality,  or  CSBD,  has  been  called 
by  various  names  over  the  years  and  has  been  suggested 
as  an  impulse  control  disorder  in  ICD‑11.  Diagnosis  of 
hypersexuality based on the definition and clinical guideline 
of ICD‑11 includes the following:
1.  Repetitive  sexual  activities  become  the  main  focus  of 
a  person’s  life,  that  is,  the  person  neglects  his  or  her 
health and personal care or other interests, activities, and 
responsibilities (scope: excessive focus and a significant 
amount of time allotted to sexual behavior so the extent 
that other important areas of life are ignored).

2.  The  person  makes  numerous  attempts  to  significantly 
reduce repetitive sexual behavior but fails (scope: there 
is a control disorder).

3.  The  pattern  of  uncontrollable  sexual  motivation  or 
intense  motivation  that  results  from  repetitive  sexual 
behaviors can cause significant distress or disruption in 
personal,  family,  social,  educational,  occupational,  or 
other important areas of a person’s performance (scope: 
sexually generated thoughts or behaviors cause significant 
distress or disorder in performance).

4.  The person engages in repetitive sexual behaviors despite 
the adverse consequences (scope: despite the danger or 
adverse consequences, the person continues and engages 
in sexual behaviors).

and engagement is associated with less sexual satisfaction 
over time).

6.  Distress  that  relates  only  to  moral  judgments  and 
disapproval of sexual motives, urges, or behaviors is not 
sufficient to diagnose HS or CSBD (exclusion criterion: 
distress is entirely related to moral incompatibility).[5]

However,  the  relationship  of  life  partners,  including  the 
marital relationship, is a unique human relationship, in which 
all biological, spiritual, social, and emotional dimensions of 
human beings are taken into account. The marital system as a 
unique system has features that distinguish it from other forms 
of social relations:
1.  An  effective  marital  relationship  requires  a  balance 
between dynamism and stability. For a healthy relationship 
between couples, some degrees of stability, predictability, 
and to some extent, freshness and flexibility are required.
2.  Marital  relationship  has  a  past,  present,  and  future. 
Couples connect their past issues and future plans and 
try to keep their relationship fresh in the present time. 
A  marital  relationship  requires  a  combination  of  the 
future  and  the  past  of  two  people  who  have  different 
values and attitudes.

3.  The marital relationship requires support; husbands and 
wives should be able to understand their spouse’s needs 
as their own and reduce their self‑centeredness.

4.  A marital relationship requires that each member, while 
maintaining his or her individuality and unique identity, 
may sometimes abandon his or her individuality because 
of the relationship.

5.  Couples should be able to establish boundaries to meet 
the needs of the family and to create security, personal 
privacy, and close relationships.[6]

As mentioned, in some cases, sexual behaviors may be too 
coercive  and  cause  severe  problems  in  the  lives  of  people, 
especially couples. One of the major problems that may exist 
among  couples  with  hypersexuality  is  the  instability  of  the 
marriage. Marriage instability can be referred as to determine 
a couple’s tendency to dissolve a marriage. In other words, 
marriage instability has been used in conjunction with concepts 
such  as  marital  breakup,  marital  dissolution,  divorce,  poor 
marital quality, and desertion. It refers to divorce as a couple’s 
tendency, which includes two cognitive components (thinking 
about the question of whether their marriage is in a difficult 
situation  or  thinking  about  divorce)  and  behavioral  (an 
action that a person does as a result of his/her feelings or in 
a conversation with his spouse about divorce).[7] Research in 
Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, and 
the United States suggests that marital satisfaction is associated 
with lasting marriage; meanwhile, according to the official data 
of the Civil Registration Organization in 2018, the divorce rate 
in Iran was approximately 5 to 1 compared to 2012 and 3 to 
1 compared to 2017.[8]

low or no sexual satisfaction (scope: forced interaction

to improve mental health and the quality of life of patients. In 
this study, the cognitive interventions of dialectical behavior 
therapy (DBT) and aripiprazole are used to reduce the problem 
of marital instability among these couples.

Many treatments have been performed to address the problem 
of marital instability of couples with hypersexuality; one of 
these  treatments  is  prescribing  medications.  Despite  their 
relative  effectiveness,  some  medical  interventions,  such  as 
the use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), 
antiandrogens, and other standard and well‑known psychiatric 
medications, are used for these disorders.[9‑11] Aripiprazole is 
an antipsychotic drug and a partial agonist of dopamine D2 
receptor  agonist,  rarely  associated  with  sexual  side  effects. 
Sexual  disorder  is  a  significant  reason  for  nonadherence  to 
antipsychotic drugs in patients with mental health disorders. 
Antipsychotic  drugs  reduce  dopamine  levels  and  increase 
prolactin levels, which reduce sexual desire. Aripiprazole is a 
relative dopamine D2 receptor agonist that is rarely associated 
with sexual side effects and often used to relieve side effects 
and  impulsive  behaviors  such  as  pathological  gambling, 
excessive  shopping,  and  hypersexuality  through  increasing 
prolactin  levels.  Of  course,  sexual  dysfunction,  such  as 
hypersexuality, is also a significant reason for inadherence to 
antipsychotic treatment in patients with mental health disorders

Special psychological therapies for the problems of couples 
with hypersexuality include psychoanalytic therapies, couple 
therapy,  and  behavior  therapy.[12,13]  One  of  the  approaches 
that has long‑term effectiveness by enhancing skills through 
intervention in the field of cognition, emotion, and behavior 
is DBT.[14] Considering the role of hypersexuality in sexual 
satisfaction, impulsive behavior, instability of marriage, and 
emotional divorce in the life of couples, therapies that emphasize 
on  resolving  interpersonal  conflicts  and  contradictions  and 
gaining  social  support  can  play  an  important  role  in  the 
treatment  and  prevention  of  hypersexual  complications  in 
the life of couples. One of the innovations in psychological 
therapies that emphasizes skills training and emotion regulation 
skills is DBT. DBT introduces four interventional components 
in  its  group  therapy  method  including  mindfulness  and 
distress tolerance as components of acceptance, and emotional 
regulation and interpersonal efficiency as components based 
on change.[6] Research results have confirmed the effectiveness 
of  DBT  on  reducing  couples’  conflicts,  increasing  marital 
satisfaction, emotion regulation skills on the verge of divorce, 
improving  interpersonal  relationships,  and  reducing  violent 
behaviors and impulsivity.[15]

Reviewing  research  studies  conducted  in  Iran,  reveals 
a  gap  of  studies  on  hypersexuality  disorders  in  spite  of 
the  beneficial  effects  of  DBT,  which  is  a  special  type  of 
cognitive‑behavioral psychotherapy, and Aripiprazole which 
is  a  type  of  antipsychotic  drug.  Considering  the  above  and 
psychological  interventions  to  increase  the  quality  of  life 
of  couples  and  creating  marital  stability,  it  is  necessary  to 

conduct experimental researches to reduce marital instability 
in new and creative ways. Obviously, DBT and Aripiprazole 
are effective in this regard. Also, in addition to examining the 
effect of DBT and Aripiprazole in these patients, a comparison 
of  these  two  treatments  is  a  requisite  of  the  current  study. 
Therefore, the present study set to conduct a comparative study 
on the effect of DBT and Aripiprazole on marital instability in 
patients with hypersexuality. Accordingly, the emphasis of the 
study was on comparing the effect of DBT and Aripiprazole 
on the above variable in patients with hypersexuality. It was 
tried to introduce these treatments briefly and teach DBT to 
hypersexual patients in relation to the research variable. So, 
the question is whether there is a difference between the effect 
of DBT and Aripiprazole on marital instability in patients with 
hypersexuality.

MaterIals and Methods
This applied study was conducted, which is sometimes referred 
to as action research, emphasis on resolving specific problems 
in real situations. Due to the nature of the subject and objectives 
of the research, a quasi‑experimental method was used based 
on the design of three control‑experimental groups with pretest, 
posttest, and follow‑up. The two experimental groups were 
exposed to independent variables. No variables were applied 
in the control group.

The statistical population included hypersexual patients who 
referred  to  four  hospitals  and  psychiatric  centers  including 
Khorshid  Hospital, Asgarieh  Specialized  Hospital,  Isfahan 
Farhangian  Clinic,  and  Hazrat  Imam  Reza  (AS)  Medical 
Center in Isfahan. Ten patients were selected purposefully as 
the sample size for the control group, 10 as the sample size 
for the first experimental group (including dropouts) and 10 as 
the sample size for the second experimental group (including 
dropouts). After initial evaluation, they were randomly divided 
into  three  groups  of  control  and  experimental.  Despite  the 
dropouts, 27 people were divided into three groups of nine. In 
the first experimental group, DBT was provided (this treatment 
protocol was performed in eight sessions of 90 min) [Table 1]. 
For the second experimental group, Aripiprazole was initially 
prescribed by the psychiatrist with an initial dose of 5 mg daily. 
If the dose needed to be increased, it was prescribed once a 
week  until  the  final  dose  increased  to  20  mg  daily  (in  case 
of tolerance) for 2 months. After completing these steps, the 
questionnaires were administered again as a posttest, and the 
follow‑up period was performed 5 months later (after 2 months 
of drug administration, the medication was continued for up 
to 6 months at a specific dose until the follow‑up phase was 
completed to stabilize the medication period according to the 
psychiatrist view); finally, all subjects were thanked for their 
participation.

The  inclusion  criteria  were  as  follows:  diagnosis  of 
hypersexuality  as  a  separate  diagnosis  based  on  ICD‑11 
classification, having at least an educational degree of diploma, 
being over 20 years of age, being married, and not receiving

with resistance and conflict).

any other educational program before and while performing 
DBT.  The  exclusion  criteria  were  as  the  following:  severe 
psychiatric illness concurrently with hypersexuality and the use 
of psychiatric drugs, patients being treated with Levo‑Dopa, 
substance  abuse,  frontal  lobe  disorders  or  schizophrenia, 
pregnant women, breast feeding mothers, and people at the 
risk  for  suicide.  Therefore,  according  to  the  inclusion  and 
exclusion criteria, medical and psychiatric examinations and 
possible differential diagnoses were performed and the types 
of  hypersexuality  drugs  used  or  the  underlying  psychiatric 
diseases  were  indicated. Also,  in  clinical  interviews  and 
periodic examinations of patients, all possible side effects were 
considered. If there were any side effects, they were recorded 
and evaluated, and the side effects of Aripiprazole, especially 
cardiac complications, were carefully monitored.

Eligible  individuals  were  randomly  assigned  to  a  control 
group and two experimental groups, and in the pretest phase, 
Marital  Instability  Index (MII)  was  administered  to  all  three 
groups.  Then,  DBT  was  hold  for  eight  sessions  (2  months 
and  1  session  per  week),  and Aripiprazole  was  administered 
to  the  experimental  groups  for  2  months.  Immediately  after 
discontinuation  of  psychotherapy  and  drug  treatment,  the 
posttest stage was performed. In the posttest stage, the mentioned 
questionnaire  was  performed  again  for  all  three  control  and 
experimental groups. The follow‑up period was then performed 
5 months after the posttest. The main reason for the follow‑up 
period was to evaluate for possible late side effects, including 
tardive  dyskinesia,  which  may  usually  occur  3  to  6  months 
after  starting  the  drug.  Changes  in  recurrence  of  symptoms, 
changes in mood, and other cases were also examined during 
the follow‑up period. Finally, the obtained data were analyzed. 
Field experiment method was used for data collection.

After  indicating  the  study  population  and  formulating 
hypotheses using special techniques, the necessary information 
and  figures  were  collected  from  the  members  of  all  three 
groups  in  three  stages:  pretest,  posttest,  and  follow‑up. 
The  instruments  used  were  the  MII  and  researcher‑made 
demographic questionnaire.

The MII was compiled by Edwards, Johnson, and Booth in 
1987. This index is a 14‑question tool developed to measure 
the instability of marital marriage and was first used in 1989 
for 2034 married men and women under the age of 55 and 
also for 1578 married men and women in 1983. This index 
has two parts; the first part has 14 questions, scored based on 
a four‑point Likert scale (never = 1, sometimes = 2, often = 3, 
and  very  =  4).  Scores  14  to  28  indicate  that  the  instability 
of marriage in the individual is low; a score from 28 to 42 
indicates that the rate of marriage instability is moderate; and 
a score from 42 to 56 indicates that the instability of marriage 
is high in the individual. Also, in the second part, which has 
eight questions, some of the things that a couple sometimes 
do together are examined. In general, a low score in this index 
means more stability of marriage and marital life, and a higher 
score indicates higher instability of marriage.

The validity of this scale has been evaluated and confirmed 
in several studies, and its positive correlation with the scales 
related to marital problems and its negative correlation with the 
scales related to marital interaction and satisfaction have been 
confirmed. In one study, the coefficient of validity was 0.93 
and was reported 0.75 for an 8‑item scale.[16] The reliability 
of this scale using Cronbach’s alpha is reported 93%. Nazari, 
Sahebdel,  and Asadi  (2011)  used  the  split‑half  correlation 
method  to  evaluate  the  validity  of  the  test,  and  a  validity 
coefficient of 70% was reported. Cronbach’s alpha was used 
to examine the internal consistency of this index, which was 
0.74. Also, correlation coefficient of –0.53 was obtained for 
the convergence validity of this index with marital intimacy, 
which is significant at the level of 0.01.[17]

Ethical considerations: To observe research ethics, about four 
to five sessions of DBT intervention were performed for the 
control group after the experiment sessions and the follow‑up 
period in addition to observing the principles of the ethical 
charter.

results
Descriptive  findings  include  statistical  indices  of  mean 
and  standard  deviation.  Also,  multivariate  analysis  of 
covariance (MANCOVA) was used to test the hypotheses. 
Kolmogorov‑‑Smirov test was used to check the normality 
of the data; Leven test was used to check the homogeneity 
of  variances,  and  box΄M  test  was  used  to  check  the 
correlation between the research variables. To compare the 
difference of dependent variables, Wilk Lambda test, Pillai 
Trace, Hotelling Trace, and Roy Largest Root are used. To 
assure  the  assumptions  of  parametric  tests, ANOVA  was 
used  to  calculate  the  data.  In  hypotheses  that  needed  to 
control  the  effect  of  auxiliary  random  variables, ANOVA 
and in hypotheses that needed to examine the effect of an 
independent  variable  on  two  or  more  dependent  variables 
simultaneously, MANCOVA was used. Before performing the 
MANCOVA, the necessary assumptions were also examined 
to determine whether MANCOVA can be used. The following 
research hypotheses are presented, and the results related to 
each are presented.

showed the equality of variances, so the ANCOVA could be 
used. The results of the Leven test are presented in Table 2.

The  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  pretest,  posttest,  and 
follow‑up  scores  of  marriage  instability  component  in  the 
three intervention and control groups are presented in Table 3, 
respectively [Table 3].

Tables  4  and  5,  respectively,  are  related  to  the  results  of 
ANCOVA for comparing the two groups (first experimental 
group  and  control  group;  second  experimental  group  and 
control group) in the variable of tolerance of marital instability, 
and Table 6 is related to the results of ANCOVA for comparison 
of three groups of the variable of tolerance of marital instability.

Given  that  the  variable  of  marital  instability  has  become 
significant over time (p < 0.01), there was a difference between 
the three stages of pretest, posttest, and follow‑up in this variable. 
These differences were investigated using Bonferroni post hoc 
test [Table 4]. Also, considering interaction between group and 
time (p < 0.01), it is clear that there is a difference between the 
pretest, posttest, and follow‑up stages between group therapy and 
control groups in the dependent variable, an evaluation of which 
is provided. Also, assuming the group effect and according to 
the values of F and significance levels, there was no significant 
difference  in  the  variable  of  marital  instability  between  the 
experimental (DBT) and control groups (p < 0.05).

The use of ANCOVA requires statistical assumptions such as 
(1) normality, (2) homogeneity of variances, (3) homogeneity 
of  regression  slopes,  and  (4)  multicollinearity  (p  <  0.05) 
[Table 2]. The normality assumption was tested and confirmed 
by Shapiro‑‑Wilk test. Leven and box΄M test (F = 1.41) also 

Since the variable of marital instability has become significant 
over time (p < 0.05), there was a difference between the three 
stages of pretest, posttest, and follow‑up. These differences 
were  investigated  using  Bonferroni  post  hoc  test  [Table  5]. 
Also,  considering  the  interaction  between  group  and

time (p < 0.01), there was a difference between the pretest, 
posttest,  and  follow‑up  stages  between  group  therapy  and 
control groups in the dependent variable. Also, assuming the 
group effect and according to the values of F and significance 
levels, no significant difference was found in the variable of 
marital  instability  between  the  experimental  (Aripiprazole) 
and control groups (p < 0.05).

Since the variable of marital instability has become significant 
over time (p < 0.01), there was a significant difference between 
the three stages of pretest, posttest, and follow‑up [Table 6]. 
Also,  considering  the  interaction  between  group  and 
time  (p  <  0.01),  there  was  a  significant  difference  between 
the  pretest,  posttest,  and  follow‑up  stages  between  the  two 
treatments  (DBT  and Aripiprazole)  and  control  groups  in 
the dependent variable, a review of which is provided. Also, 
assuming the group effect and according to the values of F and 
significance levels, no significant difference was found in the 
variable of marital instability between the experimental (DBT 
and Aripiprazole) and control groups (p < 0.05).

dIscussIon
According  to  the  evaluations,  there  is  a  significant 
difference  between  the  pretest  and  posttest  and  between 
the pretest and follow‑up in the values of marital instability 
variable (p < 0.05), but there is no difference between posttest 
and follow‑up (p > 0.05). The mean scores in the variables of 
marital instability in post‑test (31.44) and follow‑up (32.11) 
show  that  the  scores  decreased  compared  to  pretest.  The 
results show that DBT reduced the marital instability. Also, in 
the pretest, posttest, and follow‑up stages, no difference was 
observed between the group undergoing DBT and the control 
group (p > 0.05). Hence, DBT has little effect on reducing the 
instability of marriage of a patient with hypersexuality.

Ismailifar, Jairvand, Rasouli, and Hassani considered despair, 
inability to solve problems, and negative emotions of couples 
as effective factors on marital instability.[20] On the other hand, 
studies have shown that DBT skills improve problem‑solving 
skills  and  emotion  management  in  spouses.[21]  In  DBT 

sessions, emotion regulation and turbulence tolerance skills 
give  couples  the  opportunity  to  resolve  their  conflicts  with 
high  concentration  and  to  find  different  solutions  to  their 
problems with greater creativity and flexibility. Thus, a change 
in problem‑solving style by changing cognition reduces stress 
and,  ultimately,  the  instability  of  married  life.  Zeraati  also 
concluded that DBT is effective on reducing marital boredom 
of  addicts  with  suicidal  ideation.  However,  DBT  is  more 
effective than self‑regulatory couple therapy.[22] Explaining this 
finding, it can be said that couples with poor coping skills and 
low flexibility show the weakest results in treatment, and this is 
one of the reasons for reporting reduction in the effectiveness 
of couple therapy approaches. In DBT, flexibility is increased 
in  couples  through  stress  coping  skills.  Mara  showed  that 
helplessness  coping  skills  help  a  person  to  better  adapt  to 
painful events through increasing flexibility and offering new 
ways and modifying the effects of distressing situations. In 
the  2‑month  training  process,  using  acceptance  and  change 
techniques,  the  motivation  of  the  participants  to  change 
increased and their resistance decreased. Instead of spending 
energy and time dealing with unpleasant thoughts, separation 
from  these  thoughts  and  accepting  them  without  judgment 
have possibly contributed to the process of increasing their 
quality of married life and thus the married life stability.[9] The 
present variable requires more time for performing therapeutic 
interventions  to  be  effective;  in  the  present  study,  limited 
research time may not have affected it as desired and probably 
more time is needed because, as mentioned, some variables 
take longer to take effect.

The obtained data also showed a significant difference between 
pretest  and  posttest  and  between  pretest  and  follow‑up  in 
the values of marital instability variables (p < 0.05), but no 
difference  was  observed  between  posttest  and  follow‑up 
(p > 0.05). The mean scores in the variable of marital instability 
in the posttest (36.55) and follow‑up (35.22) showed that the 
scores were lower compared to the pretest. So, the results show 
that DBT has reduced marital instability.

According to the results, in the pretest, posttest, and follow‑up 
stages, no difference was observed between the group treated

Tavakoli, et al.: Dialectical behavior therapy and aripiprazole on marital instability of in patients with hypersexualwith Aripiprazole and the control (p > 0.05). Thus, Aripiprazole 
has little effect on reducing the marital instability of patients 
with hypersexuality.

Aripiprazole is an unusual FDA‑approved antipsychotic that is 
primarily used for symptomatic management of psychosis in 
patients with schizophrenia and monotherapy or an auxiliary 
therapy  for  acute  manic  episodes  associated  with  bipolar 
disorder.  Studies  show  that  short‑term  use  of Aripiprazole 
in  patients  with  ASD  leads  to  decreased  excitability, 
decreased hyperactivity, and reduced repetitive and aimless 
actions (cliché behaviors).[23] Aripiprazole has also been shown 
to reduce hospitalization in psychiatric hospitals, reduce the 
symptoms  of  late  dyskinesia,  improve  cognitive  function, 
improve  sexual  function,  and  reduce  the  desire  for  alcohol 
and  sex  in  addicted  patients.[11]  Therefore,  when  a  person 
with  hypersexuality  shows  less  excitability  and  impulsive 
behaviors, he/she will show less repetitive and aimless actions, 
will improve cognitive functions, modulate sexual activities, 
and may compensate for defects in the sexual behaviors that 
a person has had with his/her spouse. The affected person and 
the couple show more hope in life regarding positive changes 
they have experienced through Aripiprazole in their lives, thus 
expecting improvement in marital relationships and quality of 
life, resulting in more stable relationships.

On the other hand, Aripiprazole stimulates 5‑HT2A receptors 
in mesocortical pleasure centers to increase pleasure in marital 
life.[23] Today, marriage occurs and continues because of the 
feeling of emotional satisfaction resulting from cohabitation 
and close relationship with the desired spouse. Some experts 
have considered couples’ shared leisure as a possible factor 
in  the  stability  of  marital  life  based  on  attachment  theory. 
Couples’ time together is a form of enjoyable interaction that 
strengthens attachment between couples and prevents marital 
dissolution.  Couples’  time  together  and  enjoyable  activities 
with each other provide a close relationship between couples 
and affect marital satisfaction and increase their chances of 
marital life. As mentioned, the present variable requires more 
time for performing of therapeutic interventions to be effective, 
so the limited time of the research had not had much effect on 
it. Also, in another explanation, according to the studies, the 
medication has no specific and obvious effect on this variable.

In none of the stages, a significant difference was observed 
between  the  group  treated  with  DBT  and  the  group  treated 
with Aripiprazole  and  the  control  group  (p  <  0.05).  Hence, 
the  research  hypothesis  “there  is  a  difference  between  the 
effectiveness of DBT and Aripiprazole on marital instability” 
is not accepted.

According to the results, it was observed that in the pretest 
stage,  there  is  no  difference  between  the  group  undergoing 
DBT and the group treated with Aripiprazole and the control 
group.

not  have  insight  into  their  behaviors.  Satisfaction  can  be 
resulted  from  respect,  appreciation,  commitment,  affection, 
mood  stability,  controlling  the  emotions,  and  trust  in  their 
relationship. Marriages that pass this stage correctly are likely 
to  remain  stable.[24]  The  more  mature  the  couple’s  marital 
relationship at this stage, the more time couples spend together, 
learn  to  take  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  other 
party in some situations, adapt to cohabitation conditions to 
improve their health, and decide on a common future for their 
lives.[25] In addition, age‑related problems, the occurrence of 
some diseases, and hormonal problems in both genders can 
negatively affect the sexual desire or function of couples and 
reduce the stability of their lives.

Following this study and according to the results obtained 
from  the  analysis  of  the  collected  data,  DBT  intervention 
and aripiprazole can be used to improve mental health and 
treatment of psychological problems in hypersexual patients; 
Urologists and Gynecologists, in collaboration with health 
and  clinical  psychologists,  can  help  patients  to  cope  with 
physical and psychological complications and side effects 
of  the  disease  as  well  as  reduce  the  inconvenience  of  the 
patients and improve the quality of their life. It should be 
noted that this study was conducted in the mentioned medical 
centers of Isfahan in 1399, so in generalizing the results to 
other hospitals, clinics and similar research institutes, it is 
better to be cautious; also, people’s reactions to some DBT 
techniques  differ  not  only  in  different  societies,  but  also 
between the various groups of individuals. It should be noted 
that  in  people  at  high  risk  of  developing  hypersexuality 
disorder,  aripiprazole  should  be  used  to  prevent  related 
problems.

conclusIon
Therefore, when these couples undergo psychological therapies 
such  as  DBT  or  when  they  take  psychiatric  drugs  such  as 
Aripiprazole  because  of  their  problems,  their  relationship, 
psychological,  and  especially  sexual  problems  decrease;  as 
a  result,  they  report  more  levels  of  stability  in  their  lives. 
Therefore, due to the impact of Aripiprazole and DBT on the 
dimensions of this disease, they show the same effectiveness 
in the stability of married life of couples with hypersexuality; 
thus, no significant difference was observed between the two 
groups.
