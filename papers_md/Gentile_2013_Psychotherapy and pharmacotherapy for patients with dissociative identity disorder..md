ABSTRACT

There is a wide variety of what

have been called “dissociative
disorders,” including dissociative
amnesia, dissociative fugue,
depersonalization disorder,
dissociative identity disorder, and
forms of dissociative disorder not
otherwise specified. Some of these
diagnoses, particularly dissociative
identity disorder, are controversial
and have been questioned by many
clinicians over the years. The
disorders may be under-diagnosed or
misdiagnosed, but many persons who
have experienced trauma report
“dissociative” symptoms. Prevalence
of dissociative disorders is unknown,
but current estimates are higher than
previously thought. This paper
reviews clinical, phenomenological,
and epidemiological data regarding
diagnosis in general, and illustrates
possible treatment interventions for
dissociative identity disorder, with a
focus on psychotherapy interventions
and a review of current
psychopharmacology
recommendations as part of a
comprehensive multidisciplinary
treatment plan.

INTRODUCTION

Dissociative disorders (DDs)
were first recognized as official
psychiatric disorders in 1980 with
the publication of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Third Edition (DSM III)
in 1980. Prior to this, the related
symptoms were listed under
‘hysterical neuroses’ in the second
edition of the DSM.1,2 Interestingly, all
of the current DDs that have been
described were discovered prior to
1900 but decades passed with little
study or research of this spectrum of
psychiatric pathology. The existence
of dissociative disorders is
questioned by many in the field of
psychiatry, and the diagnosis is not
utilized by some clinicians.3

Some research within the past five

years indicates that DD consist of
psychiatric symptoms that are severe
and disabling, resulting in high
utilization of community resources.1,3
The costs to patients are significant
in the form of personal suffering and
impairments in functioning.4 DDs,
along with other complex
posttraumatic disorders, are
incredibly costly to the mental health

delivery system.1,4,5 Complicating
factors include misdiagnosis and
under-diagnosis, which may occur
due to unfamiliarity with this
spectrum of disorders, disbelief that
they exist, or lack of knowledge and
appreciation of the epidemiology.1,4
An added layer of complication
involves dissociation related to a
criminal offense.1 Despite the belief
of some psychiatrists that these
disorders are very rare and others
who question their existence, some
recent prevalence estimates range
from 12 to 28 percent in adult
outpatients for all DDs.5

Dissociation can be interpreted as

an “emergency defense,” or a “shut
off mechanism.”6 According to Allen
and Smith,6 it is understood as an
attempt by the individual to “prevent
overwhelming flooding of
consciousness at the time of trauma.”
It is argued that the individual
subconsciously cannot tolerate being
present emotionally during the
trauma but cannot control the
situation, and therefore protects
him- or herself from experiencing it
in the moment via dissociation.
Dissociative symptoms are not
merely failures of normal
neurocognitive functioning, they are
also perceived as disruptive, because
there is a loss of needed information
or as discontinuity of experience.7
According to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition,
Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR),8 “the
essential feature of the dissociative
disorders is a disruption in the
usually integrated functions of
consciousness, memory, identity, or
perception.” The dissociative
disorder spectrum is characterized as
a collection of long-term, chronic
disorders.7,8 Dissociation may differ in
presentation for each individual and,
more significantly, in its “adaptive
efficacy.”6 When an individual
experiences trauma, dissociation is
an attempt to survive, tolerate,
consciously escape, or adapt to the
situation. Once the individual has
learned to dissociate in the context
of trauma, he or she may
subsequently transfer this response

to other situations and it may be
repeated thereafter arbitrarily in a
wide variety of circumstances. The
dissociation therefore “destabilizes
adaptation and becomes
pathological.”6 It is important for the
psychiatrist to accurately diagnose
DDs and also to place the symptoms
in perspective with regard to trauma
history. Patients who receive
treatment interventions that address
their trauma-based dissociative
symptoms show improved
functioning and reduced symptoms.4

CLINICAL VIGNETTE 1: HANDLING
THE EMERGENCE OF “ALTERS”
DURING PSYCHOTHERAPY
SESSIONS

Ms. B was a 28-year-old woman

with a diagnosis of dissociative
identity disorder (DID) who reported
physical and sexual abuse by her
mother’s boyfriend throughout her
developmental years. She reported
being punched, kicked, hit, and
whipped with extension cords. She
stated that her mother’s boyfriend
could be kind to her one moment and
quick to anger the next. She also
indicated that he abused alcohol and
drugs, and enlisted Ms. B to sell
drugs for him at a very early age. Her
acute symptoms at the time of
admission to the clinic were panic
attacks, exaggerated startle response,
claustrophobia, and self-injurious
behavior, which consisted of cutting
her abdomen and arms. 
After being in weekly

psychotherapy with for six months,
Ms. B was struggling with what to
discuss in the room; she had reported
in previous sessions that she used
drawing as an outlet to cope with her
anxiety and stress so it was
recommended she sketch or write
her thoughts on paper as a conduit to
further discussion and exploration.
After several minutes, Ms. B suddenly
stopped drawing and was very still.
Ms. B did not respond when her
name was called. The patient’s eyes
were shut, but under her eyelids
could be seen shifting horizontally
similar to eye activity during rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep. 

Psychiatrist: What’s your name?
Ms. B: Little Liar
Psychiatrist: How old are you?
Ms. B: Four
Psychiatrist: You seem like a nice

little girl to me.  

Ms. B: My mom thinks I’m a liar.
Psychiatrist: I don’t think you are a
liar. You can talk to me any time
you like.

Ms. B: Tom did bad stuff to me. He
took me downstairs and showed
me lots of guns.” 

Psychiatrist: Who is Tom?
Ms. B: My mom’s boyfriend. 
Psychiatrist: What was the bad stuff

he did to you?

Ms. B: He touched me down there.
[points to her buttocks] He told
me not to tell anyone. [patient
starts to sob]

Psychiatrist: It’s ok for you to tell
me what happened. You are safe
here; no one will hurt you when
you are here. You didn’t do
anything wrong.

Ms. B: He made me bleed. I told my

mom, but she whipped me
anyway.

Psychiatrist: You didn’t do anything
wrong. Tom was being bad. He
hurt you and so did your mom.

The focus of the intervention is to

listen, empathize, and provide
validation and reassurance that the
patient is currently safe, particularly
when the emerging “alter” represents
a person who is much younger than
the patient’s current age. In addition,
the patient (as the “alter”) must be
provided the opportunity to tell her
story and be heard and supported.
Ms. B remained in this “dissociated”
state for 30 minutes. Time was spent
exploring what made “Little Liar’” feel
better, and she indicated that she
liked “The Little Mermaid” movie and
princesses. This was valuable
information to integrate into future
sessions, and the patient dissociated
into “Little Liar” multiple times over
the course of her treatment.

dissociative identity disorder should
be considered. See Table 1 for a list
of diagnostic characteristics.

Dissociative identity disorder
(DID) is a controversial diagnosis
within the mental health profession.9
It is said to be  characterized by “the
presence of two or more distinct
identities or personality states (each
with its own relatively enduring
pattern of perceiving, relating to, and
thinking about the environment and
self)...that recurrently take control of
the person’s behavior...There is an
inability to recall important personal
information...which is too great to be
explained by ordinary forgetfulness.”8
DID is the most complicated and
theoretically challenging dissociative
disorder; it embodies the full range
of dissociative phenomena.6 DID is
not caused by alcohol, other

substance use, or by medical
conditions. It is a complex disorder
consisting of posttraumatic,
somatoform and depressive
symptoms, as well as a variety of
dissociative symptoms.1 Severe
dissociative disorders rarely occur in
exclusion of additional psychiatric
pathology, largely because they occur
as a result of trauma, and the effects
of trauma are diverse.6 DID is
frequently associated with depressive
disorders, somatization disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder,
substance abuse, and personality
disorders.1,7 Signs of self-injurious
behavior should be investigated and
addressed (if indicated) as part of
the psychiatric assessment and
treatment plan. 

The individual personality states
present in DID may be very different
from one another. They may have
different names, ages, moods, and
functions.1 Patients with DID
frequently experience somatic
symptoms, including but not limited
to headaches, conversion,
pseudoseizures, and gastrointestinal
and genitourinary disturbances.1 This
further complicates the diagnosis,
and medical conditions as well as
additional psychiatric pathology must
be considered. The primary
personality usually has no recall of
alternate identities; the alternate
identities or personalities may have
some awareness of each other. It is
common for one alter personality to
hold a central role and be aware of
and familiar with all of the others.1
Because dissociation frequently
co-occurs with severe anxiety and
depressive symptoms, it is
understandable that the psychiatrist
may be focused on the accompanying
pathology and inadvertently omit or
fail to consider the diagnosis of DID.1
The associated symptoms should be
addressed in the psychotherapy as
well as any pharmacologic
interventions. The patient
experiencing dissociation may be
unlikely to report episodes of
memory loss unless asked directly
during a clinical interview due to
embarrassment of the symptoms or

the resultant consequences.
According to Coons,1 altered
personality states are less likely to
occur while in the room with the
psychiatrist, possibly due to
decreased level of stress in this
setting or alternatively because the
psychiatrist is not inquiring about
such symptoms. Directed questions
may include inquiring about lapses in
memory, reports of abnormal
behavior by those close to the
patient, or finding objects or
possessions the patient cannot recall
acquiring. Experts in DID believe
that a psychiatrist should not make
the diagnosis unless the dissociation
is observed or a change from one
personality to another occurs in the
room.1

In addition, the altered states

should be consistent in their
presentation. Signs of a switch to an
altered state include trancelike
behavior, eye blinking, eye rolling,
and changes in posture. Switching is
frequently associated with a high
level of stress, and may be associated
with severe symptoms of depression,
extreme anger, or sexual
stimulation.1 Other psychiatric and
medical diagnoses, which should be
ruled out in the evaluation process,
include but are not limited to
hypnotic states, seizure activity with
personality change, psychosis with
ego fragmentation, and rapid cycling
bipolar disorder. 

Childhood trauma, and in

particular sexual or physical abuse, is
nearly always present in individuals
with DID.1 The prevalence of DID is
higher in females than in males,
although specifics are lacking and
there is a need for more research of
prevalence rates. Myrick et al5
reported that although most studies
consist of patients 35 years or older,
younger patient populations reported
significant dissociative symptoms and
destructive behaviors but were less
likely to be diagnosed with
dissociative disorders. Although DID
may occur in patients under the age
of 18 years, it is most commonly
diagnosed in patients in their third or
fourth decade of life.1 Altered

personality states may number
between one and 50, but the average
is 13 altered states.1

PRACTICE POINT:
DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES OF
DISSOCIATION

Early maltreatment experiences
can produce various outcomes; this
is a multifactorial process, which will
be managed differently by individuals
based on many elements including
but not limited to attachment styles,
social supports, and quality and
severity of the maltreatment. The
age of the individual at the time of
the abuse is also a critical component
due to the developmental processes
that, under other circumstances,
would normally occur at that time. In
addition, the age at the beginning
and the ending of the abuse is
significant as it “encompasses the
sequence of developmental stages
spanned by the maltreatment...and
should influence which
developmental tasks are most
disrupted.”10 Although there is no
conclusive data in this area, it
appears as if vulnerability to
dissociation increases if the abuse
occurs at earlier developmental
stages. 

During infancy and toddler years,
the major developmental tasks are as
follows:10
• Discovery of the world of people

and objects

• Establishment of secure social
relationships within the family
• Establishment of a basic sense of

self

• The development of an

autonomous sense of awareness 
• Acquisition of an initial sense of
right and wrong (good and bad).

Because children at these early
stages have such limited coping and
self-regulatory capability, they are
easily overwhelmed.10 Infants will
tend to exhibit disruption of feeding
and sleep patterns; toddlers will
typically show significant regression. 

Core development for

social context and norms.10 During
these years, children progress from
simple physical exploration of the
world to pretend and symbolic play.
The child begins to develop an
understanding of reality and often
uses denial as a coping strategy. The
capacity for dissociation increases
significantly during these years, and
this may be related to the
introduction of the use of fantasy
and imagination. Abuse during this
time disrupts self- regulation of
emotion as well as early organization
of self-perception. One theory is that
maltreatment during preschool years
is correlated with increased use of
denial and dissociation as core
coping strategies. The vulnerability
may be further increased if authority
figures in the child’s life encourage
the use of denial  (i.e. “Don’t worry.
The shot will not hurt.”10

The elementary years involve
tasks such as further development of
self, including psychological
characteristics (i.e., thoughts,
feelings, and motives).10 Children
develop the capacity for shame and
pride during this period and can view
themselves as “objects.” Friends and
peers become increasingly critical,
and evaluations of others become
integrated into self-perception.
Maltreatment during these years
disturbs socialization and causes the
individual to experience guilt, shame,
and confusion. 

Adolescence brings physical

growth and change including
puberty, which involves major
psychological readjustments. The
focus of same-sex friendships
converts to opposite-sex exploration
of intimacy and mutuality.10 Identity
formation requires integration of
complex views of self, unified with
peer evaluation of significant others.
Maltreatment is complicated by the
disruption of the defining of self as
well as the increased opportunity for
maladaptive coping,, such as
substance use, sexual acting out, and
other risk taking and self-destructive
behaviors. 

preschoolers (ages 2–5 years)
involves integration of self within

For the psychiatrist, it is
important to be cognizant that

maltreatment during developmental
years is strongly correlated with
relationship dysfunction, especially
for female victims in the context of
incest.3,4,10 Conflict with others and
difficulty with boundaries as well as
frequent re-victimization in
subsequent relationships are all too
common. Emotional dysregulation
occurs frequently in this subset and
may be the precipitant of psychiatric
treatment.4,10

The proposal for DID in the DSM-

V includes utilization of a Likert
response scale of the patient’s rating
for the following statements:11
• I find myself staring into space

and thinking of nothing.
• People, objects, or the world
around me seem strange or
unreal.

• I find that I did things that I do

not remember doing.

• When I am alone, I talk out loud to

myself.

• I feel as though I were looking at
the world through a fog so that
people and things seem far away
or unclear.

• I am able to ignore pain.
• I act so differently from one
situation to another that it is
almost as if I were two different
people.

• I can do things very easily that
would usually be hard for me.

delineates the differences between
the criteria for DID and the proposed
revisions for the upcoming fifth
edition of the DSM to be published in
May of 2013.

TABLE 2. Proposed criteria for dissociative
identity disorder (300.14) in the DSM-V7,11

A.  Disruption of identity characterized by two
or more distinct personality states or an
experience of possession, as evidenced by
discontinuities in sense of self, cognition,
behavior, affect, perceptions, and/or
memories. This disruption may be
observed by others, or reported by the
patient.

B.  Inability to recall important personal
information, for everyday events or
traumatic events, that is inconsistent with
ordinary forgetfulness.

C.  Causes clinically significant distress and
impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning.
D.  The disturbance is not a normal part of a
broadly accepted cultural or religious
practice and is not due to the direct
physiological effects of a substance (e.g.
blackouts or chaotic behavior during
Alcohol intoxication) or a general medical
condition (e.g. complex partial seizures).

did not smoke tobacco nor did she
drink alcohol or use other
substances. However, she shared that
sometimes she knew that she had
dissociated into one of the alter
personalities who drank, because she
found empty beer cans in her home. 
Ms. C reported that one time she

came home and “someone had
decided to paint the bedroom” but
she had no recollection of this.
Sometimes when she dissociated she
knew she was gone for several days
because when she came home, her
dogs were out of food and water and
they had “destroyed the house.” Ms.
C often came to sessions with
bruises, scrapes, and swollen
knuckles, but did not know how or
where she incurred the injuries. The
alter that she described as the
“Protector of the Others” would
often get into physical altercations
with other people when she felt

threatened or the need to defend
herself. During these episodes she
reported receiving strange messages
on her voicemail from people she did
not recognize, telling her that they
had had “a great time” with her. She
also had phone numbers of people
that she did not recognize saved in
her phone. She reported having a
urinary tract infection once, and
“feeling like I had been sexual with a
man,” but had no memory of it.  The
“Protector of the Others” not only
used substances but was seductive
and promiscuous.  She stated, “I
have to pretend a lot. I have to act
like I know what’s going on when I
really don’t. People talk to me about
things I’ve done, and I don’t
remember any of it. It’s humiliating.” 

One of the most important

interventions during the treatment
was to reframe the DID as a positive,
rather than a negative.  The patient
had always viewed her diagnosis as a
sign that she was “crazy.”  This can
be reframed as a constructive, very
complex system that developed to
help her survive the trauma of the
motor vehicle accident, the
premature and unexpected loss of
her parents, and the sexual abuse.
Reframing the dissociation helped
establish a deeper level of trust in
the therapeutic alliance. Expressing
empathy, compassion, and
nonjudgment was also very
important to counter the negative
experiences the patient had with
past treatment providers. 

When treating patients with DID,

much time will be spent exploring
different alter personalities and
identifying the role each plays in the
system. Throughout the
psychotherapy the use of
motivational interviewing, open-
ended questions, and reflective
listening in the room may be helpful
depending on the patient’s acute
symptoms.  

PRACTICE POINT:
DEVELOPMENTS IN
PSYCHOTHERAPY

The treatment plan designed for
patients with dissociative disorders

(DD) is vital since this patient
population is a financial burden as
utilizers of the highest number of
psychotherapy sessions compared to
those with all other psychiatric
disorders.4 In a study in
Massachusetts, patients with DID
made up only 2.6 percent of the
sample but accounted for 33.5
percent of the total Medicaid
inpatient costs.3,4 In addition, there
were high rates of suicidal and self-
injurious behavior among patients
with DID compared to patients with
other disorders, leading to long
courses of treatment in outpatient
psychiatric clinics. 

There is evidence that patients
with DD may drop out of cognitive
behavioral treatments, indicating that
programs that do not specifically
address dissociation may not be well
tolerated.4 In a study by Tamar-Gurol
et al,12 55 percent of patients with
DD prematurely dropped out of
treatment for drug abuse compared
to 29 percent of those without DD.
Somer13 found that dissociation
predicted lower rates of abstinence
among heroin users in treatment and
led Somer to conclude that “without
a thorough resolution of trauma-
related dissociation, optimal
treatment outcome is compromised.”
A report of 36 international DD
experts advised a carefully staged
multilateral treatment structure. The
first stage emphasized “emotion
regulation, impulse control,
interpersonal effectiveness,
grounding, and containment of
intrusive material.”4 In the second
stage of treatment, the experts
recommended the use of
exposure/abreaction techniques
(though modified to avoid
overwhelming the patients) balanced
with core interventions. The last
stage of treatment was less specific
and individualized according to the
patient’s symptoms and specific
needs. 

A recent review by Brand et al4 of

the DD treatment literature
concluded that when treatment is
specifically adapted to address the
complex traumas and high level of

26

Innovations in CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE [ V O L U M E   1 0 ,   N U M B E R   2 ,   F E B R U A R Y   2 0 1 3 ]

dissociation among patients with this
spectrum of psychiatric disorders,
even severely affected patients
improve.4 A course of psychotherapy
for patients with dissociative
disorders may be complicated and
sometimes require an eclectic
approach or periods of change
between various approaches. During
periods of acute stressors, frequent
dissociation and/or severe depression
and anxiety, supportive interventions
(crisis interventions and shoring up
existing coping skills and strategies)
are a better fit; during periods of
relatively mild symptoms, a
psychodynamic approach may be
utilized (focusing on self-reflection
and self-examination).14,15
Psychodynamic psychotherapy uses
self-reflection and self-evaluation
while the work in the room is
achieved due to the therapeutic
alliance and inter-relationship with
the psychiatrist. The expectation is
that the patient will explore effective
coping strategies and relationship
patterns. The psychiatrist attempts
to reveal the unconscious
components of the patient’s
maladaptive functioning and attends
to resistance as it reveals itself.
Facilitation of change is
accomplished over time when a
trusting alliance is established,
resistance is managed, and deeper
understanding has developed.  

The issue of integration should be

explored in a psychotherapy
relationship. Integration at a basic
level may be defined as “acceptance/
ownership of all thoughts, feelings,
fears, beliefs, experiences and
memories (often labeled as
personalities) as me/mine.” Some
consider it a necessary part of
trauma recovery and exploration in
the psychotherapy; others state it is
a personal choice for each individual
patient. In the process of integration,
the patient takes responsibility and
ownership for all parts of self.
Potentially, the most critical element
is complete acceptance of the whole
person including all dissociated
parts. As Downing describes,16
“integration is more than about

personalities…it is a process not an
event. It occurs throughout therapy
(and outside of therapy) as
dissociated aspects of one's self
become known, accepted, and
integrated into normal awareness.”

CLNICAL VIGNETTE 3: REACTING
TO THE PRESENCE OF AN ALTER
IN GROUP THERAPY

Ms. H was a 42-year-old, divorced

woman with DID who was referred
for mental health treatment of
depression, anxiety, flashbacks, gaps
in her memory, loss of time, and
paranoia. At the time of her
assessment, Ms. H alleged that she
had been molested for a several
years during developmental years by
various perpetrators, including her
brother and father. During her
teenage years, the patient’s mother
who reportedly had history of
schizophrenia (paranoid type), would
kick her out of the house, and the
patient would live with the families
of school friends. The patient’s
significant other attended the intake
appointment with the patient’s
permission and shared information
on the five alter personalities that
she had interacted with over several
years. 

The various alter personalities
played different roles in helping the
patient function in the world.  Each
alter had compartmentalized certain
emotions and were void of others.
One of the alters held most of the
memories of abuse and expressed
most of the sadness.  Another was
described as the “The Primary” alter
who was angry, outspoken,
suspicious, aggressive and defensive.

After six months of weekly
psychotherapy supplemented with
group therapy, Ms. H’s father (and
alleged perpetrator) passed away,
causing an exacerbation of anxiety
and conflicted emotions. This proved
to be a devastating recurrence of
trauma for the patient and became
the precipitating factor for the
symptoms of DID to emerge in the
room. The first indication that the
patient was beginning to dissociate in
treatment was when she showed up

at the office one day late for a
psychotherapy process group that
she had been attending consistently
in addition to her individual
psychotherapy.  The receptionist
reported that the patient looked
“different” and “acted like she was
intoxicated.”  

The following week, the patient

came to the group and had a
different hair style and introduced
herself with a different name when
she checked in to group.  She
appeared anxious and spoke using
“street talk.” Ms. H had dissociated
into one of her alter personalities,
and so the focus in the room was on
the provision of support,
reassurance, and safety.  

Ms. H: [leaning over and

whispering] I don’t think I’m
supposed to be here.

Psychiatrist: It’s okay for you to be
here. This is a safe place. No one
here will hurt you. 

Ms. H: I think they are scared of me.
[looks at the other group therapy
attendees]

Psychiatrist: What makes you think

they are scared of you?

Ms. H: When I sat down, they moved

away from me. 

Psychiatrist:  They aren’t scared of
you; they were making room for
you.  You are safe here.

Ms. H: I don’t trust anyone. [she
looks up at the group] I don’t
know what y’all think, but you
can’t trust anyone.

Psychiatrist: You’ve been hurt by
people in the past, but no one
here wants to hurt you.

After a few minutes, the patient
got up and left the group, stating she
needed to use the restroom, but she
did not return.

TABLE 3. Pharmacologic treatments for DID17,18

ANTIDEPRESSANTS/ANXIOLYTICS 

(e.g., selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, nonselective reuptake
inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors)
Treat comorbid symptoms, stabilize mood,
and reduce intrusive symptoms, hyperarousal,
and anxiety

BENZODIAZEPINES
Use with caution to decrease anxiety; this
medication class may exacerbate dissociation

BETA BLOCKERS, CLONIDINE
Stabilize mood and reduce intrusive
symptoms, hyperarousal, and anxiety

ATYPICAL (SECOND GENERATION)
ANTIPSYCHOTICS
Stabilize mood and reduce overwhelming
anxiety and intrusive symptoms

PRAZOSIN
Reduce nightmares

CARBAMAZEPINE AND OTHER MOOD
STABILIZERS
Reduce aggression, intrusive symptoms,
hyperarousal

NALTREXONE
Reduce self-injurious behavior 

and serotonin (5-HT2A) receptors
may be of use in treating complex
trauma cases with psychotic
features, although care should be
taken to distinguish auditory
hallucinations, which originate from
an external locus, versus internal
“voices.” Opioid antagonists, such as
naltrexone have also shown some
promise in the treatment of
dissociative symptoms. The mu and
kappa systems may be associated
with symptoms of analgesia. Stress-
induced analgesia, a form of
dissociation, has been shown to be
mediated by the mu opioid system.4

Most medications (e.g.,

antidepressants, anxiolytics) are
prescribed for comorbid anxiety and
mood symptoms, but these
medications do not specifically treat
the dissociation. Presently, no
pharmacological treatment has been
found to reduce dissociation.18

Although antidepressant and
anxiolytic medications are useful in
the reduction of depression and
anxiety and in the stabilization of
mood, the psychiatrist must be
cautious in using benzodiazepines to
reduce anxiety as they can also
exacerbate dissociation.17,18 In
treating patients with DID, there are
reports of some success with
selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic
antidepressants, monoamine oxidase
inhibitors, beta blockers, clonidine,
anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines
in reducing intrusive symptoms,
hyperarousal, anxiety, and mood
instability.17,18 Atypical (or second
generation) antipsychotics have also
been used for mood stabilization,
overwhelming anxiety, and intrusive
posttraumatic stress disorder
symptoms in patients with DID, as
they may be more effective and
better tolerated than typical (or first
generation) antipsychotics. Other
possible suggestions for
pharmacological interventions for
DID include the use of prazosin in
reducing nightmares, carbamazepine
to reduce aggression, and naltrexone
for amelioration of recurrent self-
injurious behaviors.17 See Table 3 for
a description of pharmacological
interventions for DID.

CONCLUSION

A wide variety of dissociative
disorders including DID occur in the
psychiatric population and may be
misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed for
a variety of reasons. Some
psychiatrists believe these disorders
are extremely rare and some believe
that they do not exist. More research
is needed, but these disorders may
be more common than previously
thought.

Psychotherapy is the cornerstone
of a multidisciplinary treatment plan
for dissociative disorders and other
trauma-related disorders and must
be incorporated into the
interventional strategy; whether the
mode of psychotherapy is supportive
or psychodynamic in nature, or some
combination of various approaches,

the treatment must be based on the
quality and acuity of the patient’s
symptoms.   

Researchers’ understanding of DD

has been augmented by
developments in investigative tools
and strategies but also by a
willingness of mainstream
researchers to acknowledge the
importance of traumatic dissociation
in psychiatry and to investigate the
possible effects and outcomes in
patients who present for treatment.19
Compared to other psychiatric
disorders, DD are associated with
severe symptoms, including frequent
suicide attempts and self-injurious
behavior, as well as a high utilization
of mental health resources. As a
result, DD exact a high economic as
well as personal cost to patients and
society. Research in the past five
years indicates that DD patients
show a poor response to standard
trauma treatment and exhibit high
levels of attrition from treatment.
Much remains to be learned about
the neurobiology, assessment,
diagnosis, and treatment of DD and
other trauma disorders.
