Abstract Eating disorders are relatively rare among the
general population. This review discusses the literature on
the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates of eating dis-
orders. We searched online Medline/Pubmed, Embase and
PsycINFO databases for articles published in English using
several keyterms relating to eating disorders and epidemiol-
ogy. Anorexia nervosa is relatively common among young
women. While the overall incidence rate remained stable
over the past decades, there has been an increase in the high
risk-group of 15–19 year old girls. It is unclear whether this
reflects earlier detection of anorexia nervosa cases or an
earlier age at onset. The occurrence of bulimia nervosa
might have decreased since the early nineties of the last
century. All eating disorders have an elevated mortality risk;
anorexia nervosa the most striking. Compared with the other
eating disorders, binge eating disorder is more common
among males and older individuals.

Introduction

Epidemiological studies provide information about the oc-
currence of disorders and trends in the frequency of disor-
ders over time. For epidemiological studies on eating
disorders there are some methodological issues. Eating dis-
orders are relatively rare among the general population and
patients tend to deny or conceal their illness and avoid
professional help. This makes community studies costly
and ineffective. Therefore, many epidemiological studies
use psychiatric case registers or medical records from hos-
pitals in a circumscribed area. This type of study will un-
derestimate the occurrence of eating disorders in the general
population, because not all patients will be detected by their
general practitioner or referred to the hospital or mental
health care. Furthermore, differences in rates over time
could be due to improved case detection, increased public
awareness leading to earlier detection and wider availability
of treatment services, instead of a true increase in occur-
rence [1, 2].

Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are the
two specified eating disorders according to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition
(DSM-IV). However, the most common eating disorder
diagnosis in either clinical and community samples is the
rest category ‘eating disorder not otherwise specified’
(EDNOS) [3–7]. EDNOS is a heterogeneous, not well de-
fined group of eating disorders and includes partial syn-
dromes of AN and BN, purging disorder and binge eating

disorder (BED). A comprehensive meta-analysis of 125
studies suggests that EDNOS is associated with substan-
tial psychological and physiological morbidity, compa-
rable with the specified eating disorders [8]. In 2013 the
fifth edition of the DSM is scheduled to appear, includ-
ing a thoroughly revised eating disorder section. A
major goal
the EDNOS-
is to reduce the size of
category. To achieve this goal the criteria for AN and
BN will be broadened [9, 10] and BED will be added
as a specific eating disorder. The decision to make BED
a separate diagnosis is partly informed by epidemiolog-
ical data supporting the construct validity of BED. BED
differs from AN and BN in terms of age at onset,
gender and racial distribution, psychiatric comorbidity
and association with obesity. BED is often seen in
obese individuals, but
is distinct from obesity per se
regarding levels of psychopathology, weight- and shape
life [11]. BED aggregates
concerns and quality of
strongly in families independently of obesity, which
may reflect genetic influences [12, 13].

In this review we will describe the epidemiology of
AN, BN, EDNOS and BED according to DSM-IV and –
if available – to the proposed DSM-5-criteria. The pro-
posed changes in DSM-5 diagnostic criteria will alter the
coverage of the diagnostic categories and thus their dis-
ease frequencies as well. Some studies used both a
narrow and a broad or partial definition of AN, including
DSM-IV AN with or without amenorrhea and ICD-10
atypical AN [14–16]. These broad or partial definitions
of AN are in line with the proposed DSM-5-criteria for
AN and will be referred to as ‘broad AN’ throughout this
review [9]. In a Finnish study of female twins, the 5-year
clinical recovery rates of AN and broad AN were almost
the same; i.e. 66.8 % and 69.1 % respectively, providing
evidence for the validity of broad AN [14]. Definitions
of each epidemiological measure are provided at
the
respective paragraphs.

This article is based on research publications on the
epidemiology of eating disorders and updates our previous
reviews, with special emphasis on studies published in the
last three years [2, 17–19].

Method

We searched online Medline/Pubmed, Embase and PsycINFO
databases using several keyterms relating to eating dis-
orders and epidemiology. The reference lists of
the
articles found were checked for any additional articles
missed by the database search. This review is limited to
articles published in English, describing the basic epide-
miological parameters incidence, prevalence and mortal-
ity rates.

Incidence

The incidence rate is the number of new cases of a disorder
in the population over a specified period. The incidence rate
of eating disorders is commonly expressed in terms of per
100 000 persons per year (person-years). The study of new
cases provides clues to etiology.

Anorexia Nervosa

Community studies assessing the incidence of eating
disorders are scarce. Keski-Rahkonen and colleagues
conducted a large community study to quantify the
incidence of AN, yielding an incidence rate of 270 per
100 000 person-years in 15–19 year old Finnish female
twins during 1990–1998 [14, 19]. The incidence rate of
broad AN was 490 per 100 000 person-years in the
incidence rate of
same group [14]. A much higher
1204 per 100 000 person-years (95 % confidence inter-
val (CI): 652-2181) for broad AN in females aged 15–
18 was found in another Finnish study of a relatively
small sample of 595 adolescents [20]. The high inci-
dence rate might be explained by the small sample size
limiting statistical power and a very broad definition of
AN used in this study, including subjects with an age-
adjusted body mass index (BMI) up to 19, without
explicitly stating that weight loss of at least 15 % had
to be present. Community rates are much higher than
incidence rates derived from primary care and medical
records [1, 21], reflecting the selection filters that form
the pathway to (psychiatric) care [22].

Incidence rates derived from general practices represent
eating disorders at the earliest stage of detection by the
health care system. Currin and colleagues [23] searched
the General Practice Research Database in the UK for new
cases of AN between 1994 and 2000 and compared their
data with the findings of a similar study for 1988–1993 [24].
The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence rate of AN
remained stable over the two study periods: In 2000 it was
4.7 (95 % CI: 3.6-5.8) per 100 000 person-years, compared
with 4.2 (95 % CI: 3.4-5.0) per 100 000 person-years in
1993. In the Netherlands the overall incidence rate of AN
ascertained by general practitioners in a large representative
sample of the Dutch population remained stable as well. In
1995–1999 it was 7.7 (95 % CI: 5.9-10.0) per 100 000
person-years, practically the same as the rate of 7.4 per
100 000 person-years in 1985–1989 [1]. Incidence rates
are highest for females aged 15–19 years. They constitute
approximately 40 % of all cases, resulting in an incidence
rate of 109.2 per 100 000 15–19 year old girls per year in
1995–1999 [1]. The incidence of AN among males was less
than 1 per 100 000 person-years in general practices in the
Netherlands and the UK [1, 23]. AN does occur among

408

children <13 years of age, but is relatively rare [1, 23].
Three studies used a national Paediatric Surveillance System
to identify new cases of early-onset eating disorders present-
ing to pediatricians [25(cid:129), 26(cid:129), 27]. In Canada, the incidence
rate of early-onset restrictive eating disorders diagnosed by
pediatricians was 2.6 (95 % CI: 2.1-3.2) per 100 000 person-
years in children aged 5 to 12 years [25(cid:129)]; in Australia it was
1.4 (95 % CI: 1.1-1.7) per 100 000 person-years in 5–13 year
old children [27]. In the Canadian study 62 % of new
restrictive eating disorder cases met criteria for AN [25(cid:129)].
Of the Australian pediatric inpatients with a newly diag-
nosed restrictive eating disorder only 37 % could be classi-
fied as AN, although 61 % had life-threatening
complications of malnutrition [27]. In British pediatric and
psychiatric care an overall incidence rate of 1.1 per 100 000
person-years for AN was found among children <13 years
of age [26(cid:129)]. Among middle aged and elderly women AN is
relatively rare as well [28–30]. In a Spanish population-based
study using the Public Health Registry to identify eating
disorder cases diagnosed by mental health professionals,
new cases of AN were found among women over 45 years
of age, constituting 64 % of all new eating disorder diagnoses
in this age-group [31]. It is unknown whether this reflects late
detection or late age at onset.

The question of whether the incidence of AN is on
the rise has been under debate. Longterm epidemiolog-
ical studies are sensitive to minor changes in the abso-
lute incidence numbers and in the methods used, for
example, variations in registration policy, demographic
differences between the populations, faulty inclusion of
readmissions, the specific methods of detection used or
the availability of services [18, 32].

the 1970s,

In a meta-analysis of the incidence of AN in mental
health care, various studies in northern Europe were com-
bined (see figure 1). Until
there was an in-
crease of the registered incidence of AN in Europe.
Since 1970,
the incidence of AN in Europe seems to
have been rather stable [1, 18, 33, 34]. In Switzerland
the incidence of severe AN in females was studied in a
geographically defined region using the same methodol-
ogy from 1956 to 1995. The incidence of severe AN
requiring hospital admission rose significantly during
the 1960s and 1970s and reached a plateau of around
1.2 per 100 000 person-years thereafter [21].

In the Netherlands from the 1980s up to now general
practitioners have registered new cases with an eating dis-
order in a representative sample of the Dutch population.
While the overall incidence of AN was stable around 7 per
100 000 person-years, the incidence in 15–19 year old girls
increased significantly from 56.4 per 100 000 person-years
in 1985–1989 to 109.2 per 100 000 person-years in 1995–
1999 [1]. This is in line with an Italian study examining age
at onset of AN in a large sample of 1,666 patients referred to

an eating disorders outpatient unit between 1985 and 2008.
Patients referred in more recent years had an earlier age at
onset [35(cid:129)]. In Rochester, MN, USA, the age-adjusted inci-
dence rates of AN showed a significant linear increasing trend
only in females aged 15–24 years from 1935–1989 [36].

Bulimia Nervosa

Only a few incidence studies of BN have been con-
ducted. In the community study of the 1975–1979 birth
cohorts of female Finnish twins the incidence rate of
BN was 200 per 100 000 person-years at the peak age
of incidence, 16–20 years [37(cid:129)(cid:129)]. A broader definition
of BN was examined as well. When symptom frequency
was relaxed to once a week,
in concordance with the
proposed DSM-5-criteria [10], the peak incidence rate of
broad BN was 300 per 100 000 person-years in 16–
20 year old females [37(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Isomaa and colleagues found
an incidence rate of 438 (95 % CI: 132–1175) per 100
000 person-years in 15–18 year old Finnish females for
another broad definition of BN, including subjects who
fulfilled all but one of the criteria for BN [20] .

According to the nation-wide primary care study in the
Netherlands, the overall incidence rate of BN tended to
decrease from 8.6 per 100 000 person-years in 1985–1989
to 6.1 per 100 000 person-years in 1995–1999 [1]. In a
primary-care study from the UK, the overall age- and sex-
adjusted incidence rate of BN decreased during the second
half of the 1990s from 12.2 per 100 000 person-years in
1993 to 6.6 per 100 000 person-years in 2000. However, the
incidence rate of BN in women aged 10–19 years remained
relatively stable around 40 per 100 000 person-years in 1993
as well as in 2000 [23].

Several studies suggest that age at onset of BN is de-
creasing. In a sample of 793 Italian BN patients referred to
an eating disorders outpatient unit between 1985 and 2008,
subjects born in 1970–1972 had a mean age at onset of
18.5 years, compared to 17.1 years in subjects born between
1979–1981 [35(cid:129)]. In the Dutch primary care study the high
risk group of BN shifted from 25–29 year old females in
1985–1989 to 15–24 year old females in 1995–1999 [1]. It
is unclear whether this reflects a true earlier age at onset or
rather earlier detection of BN cases.

Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and Binge Eating
Disorder

Epidemiological studies on EDNOS are sparse, because of
its heterogeneity and undefined operational criteria, except
for BED, for which in DSM-IV research criteria were for-
mulated. In a Spanish population-based study using the
Public Health Registry to identify eating disorder cases
diagnosed by mental health professionals, the incidence rate

409

of EDNOS was 6.5 (95 % CI: 4.8-7.9) per 100 000 inhab-
itants per year [31]. A British national surveillance study of
newly diagnosed eating disorders in pediatric and psychiat-
ric care found an incidence rate of 1.2 per 100 000 person-
years for EDNOS among children <13 years [26(cid:129)]. To our
knowledge no incidence studies on BED yet exist. Binge
eating as a disordered eating behavior or symptom is quite
common among adolescents: In a longitudinal study of a
large cohort of US adolescents, the incidence rate for binge
eating was 10.1 per 1000 person-years among females and
6.6 per 1000 person-years among males (both sexes ≥
14 years), which translates into 1010 per 100 000 person-
years and 660 per 100 000 person-years among female and
male adolescents, respectively [38].

Prevalence

The prevalence can be expressed as point prevalence, one-
year prevalence rate and lifetime prevalence. The point
prevalence is the prevalence at a specific point in time,
e.g. January 1 of a specific year. The one-year prevalence
rate is the point prevalence plus annual incidence rate (the
number of new cases in the following year). The lifetime
prevalence is the proportion of people that had the disorder
at any point in their life. The prevalence is the most useful
measure for planning health care facilities, as it indicates the
demand for care. Case detection through a two-stage screen-
ing approach is the standard procedure to estimate the prev-
alence of eating disorders [2, 39]. In the first stage a large
population is screened for the likelihood of an eating disor-
der by means of a screening questionnaire that identifies an
at-risk group. In the second stage definite cases in the at-risk
group are established on the basis of a personal interview.
Problems associated with this type of study are poor

response rates, sensitivity of the screening instrument and
the restricted size of the groups interviewed [40]. To cir-
cumvent this last problem several studies use a structured
interview such as the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI), usually administered by lay-interviewers,
to assess the prevalence of eating disorders in a large pop-
ulation sample.

Anorexia Nervosa

The lifetime prevalence of AN and broad AN has been
assessed in three large population-based cohort studies of
twins [14–16]. In Sweden, it was 1.2 % (AN) and 2.4 %
(broad AN) in the largest twin study of women from the
1935–1958 birth cohorts [16]. In an Australian study of
female twins aged 28–39 years, the lifetime prevalence of
AN was 1.9 % and of broad AN 4.3 % [15]. The lifetime
prevalence of AN was 2.2 % and of broad AN 4.2 % in a
large sample of women from the 1975–1979 birth cohorts of
Finnish twins [14]. In men from the same birth cohort the
lifetime prevalence of AN was 0.24 % [41].

Stice and colleagues followed a relatively small sample
of 496 adolescent girls over an 8-year period from early
adolescence into young adulthood, administering annual
diagnostic interviews. They found a lifetime prevalence by
age 20 years of 0.6 % for AN and 2.0 % for broad AN [42].
In Portugal, the point prevalence of AN among adolescent
girls was 0.39 % and of broad AN 0.64 % [6]. In an
Australian population-based sample of 1,597 14-year old
boys and girls, only one case of AN was identified by means
of a self-report eating disorder screening questionnaire; four
other subjects met partial criteria for AN [43].

Prevalences of AN estimated with two-stage procedures
varied from 0 to 0.9 % with an average point prevalence of

410

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2012) 14:406–414

0.29 % in young females [2]. In a meta-analysis [2], the one-
year prevalence rate per 100 000 young females was com-
puted at different levels of care (Table 1).

Using two-stage studies of community samples and esti-
mates of the incidence, the one-year prevalence rate of AN
in the community was calculated as 370 per 100 000 young
females. One can conclude from table 1 that the majority of
patients with AN in the community do not enter the mental
healthcare system [18].

Several studies used the CIDI to estimate the lifetime
prevalence of AN in large population samples [45, 46(cid:129)(cid:129),
47(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Both in a nationally representative survey of the US
household population [45] and in a population-based study
in six European countries [46(cid:129)(cid:129)], the lifetime prevalence of
AN was 0.9 % among adult females. In the US study it was
0.3 % among males [45], while in the European study not a
single male case of AN was found [46(cid:129)(cid:129)]. In a large repre-
sentative sample of US adolescents the lifetime prevalence
of AN was 0.3 % in 13–18 year old females as well as males
[47(cid:129)(cid:129)]. The female-to-male ratio in these studies is consid-
erably lower than the 10:1 ratio found in the Finnish twin
study and as reported in previous reviews [2, 14, 41], which
could be due to differences in methodology and small
numbers of cases with eating disorders [45, 47(cid:129)(cid:129)]. However,
despite this restriction many recent community-based stud-
ies have found that AN is more common among males than
previously thought. AN may be even more frequently
underdetected in males than in females [19].

A large study of Swedish twins born during the period
1935–1958 documented a higher prevalence of AN in both
male and female participants born after 1945 than those born
before 1945 [16].

Bulimia Nervosa

The generally accepted point prevalence of BN from two-
stage studies is about 1 % among young females [2, 40].
Keski-Rahkonen and colleagues found a lifetime prevalence
of 1.7 % for BN in women from the 1975–1979 birth cohorts
of Finnish twins [37(cid:129)(cid:129)]. When symptom frequency was re-
laxed to once a week, in concordance with the proposed

a Based on a meta-analysis of Hoek and van Hoeken in 2003 and
corrected for more recent findings of a decrease in point prevalence
[44] and incidence [1] of BN

DSM-5-criteria, the lifetime prevalence rose to 2.3 % in
women [37(cid:129)(cid:129)]. In an Australian twin cohort of women aged
28–39 years, a lifetime prevalence of BN of 2.9 % was found
[15]. According to US [45] and European [46(cid:129)(cid:129)] large scale
two-stage studies of the population the lifetime prevalence of
BN, assessed with the CIDI, varied between 0.9 and 1.5 %
among women and between 0.1 % and 0.5 % among men.
Marques and colleagues compared the prevalence of BN
across nationally representative samples of ethnic groups in
the US. BN was more prevalent among Latinos and African
Americans than non-Latino whites. Lifetime prevalences
ranged from 0.51 % (non-Latino whites ) to 2.0 % (Latinos)
[48]. In a recent study of a nationally representative sample of
US adolescents, a lifetime prevalence of BN of 1.3 % and
0.5 % was found among 13–18 year old females and males,
respectively [47(cid:129)(cid:129)]. In a US sample of 496 adolescent females,
followed for 8 years, a lifetime prevalence of 1.6 % for BN
was found at age 20 years [42]. An Australian population-
based study of 1,597 14-year old adolescents reported 9 cases
of BN, translating into a point prevalence of 0.6 % [43].

Trace and colleagues assessed the impact of reducing the
binge eating frequency on the lifetime prevalence of BN in a
large population sample of female Swedish twins. The life-
time prevalence of BN increased from 1.2 % for a minimum
of 8 binges per month (DSM-IV) to 1.6 % for at least 4
binges per month (proposal DSM-5) [49].

The decrease in occurrence of BN over time found in the
incidence studies is supported by a US study of university
students in which the point prevalence of BN among women
significantly decreased from 4.2 % in 1982, to 1.3 % in
1992 and 1.7 % in 2002 [44]. In another US study among
female students the point-prevalence of probable cases of
BN remained relatively stable between 1990 and 2004 [50].

Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and Binge Eating
Disorder

Often used diagnostic interviews to estimate the prevalence
of eating disorders, like the CIDI and the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM disorders (SCID) do not cover EDNOS.
In recent studies that used the CIDI alterations have been
made to include subthreshold AN [47(cid:129)(cid:129)] and BED [ 45, 46(cid:129)(cid:129),
47(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Researchers have operationalized EDNOS in different
ways; reported prevalences are therefore difficult to com-
pare and in community studies the use of limited definitions
will underestimate the true prevalence of eating pathology
that could be classified as EDNOS [8]. The point prevalence
of EDNOS in a nation-wide community sample of young
females was 2.4 % [6].

The lifetime prevalence of BED has been assessed in large
population samples in the US [45, 47(cid:129)(cid:129)] and Europe [46(cid:129)(cid:129)]. In
six European countries it was 1.9 % for women and 0.3 % for
men [46(cid:129)(cid:129)]. In the US higher lifetime prevalences were found

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2012) 14:406–414

411

among adults (women 3.5 %; men 2.0 %) and among 13–
18 year old adolescents (girls 2.3 %; boys 0.8 %) [45, 47(cid:129)(cid:129)].
The US researchers used a duration criterium of only three
months instead of the six months DSM-IV research criteria
require, which might partly explain the higher percentages.
Hudson and colleagues examined data from a non-clinical
sample to estimate how much the prevalence of BED will
increase under the proposed DSM-5-criteria that relax the
requiremens for the frequency (from two per week to one
per week) and duration of binges (from six to three months).
They extrapolated their findings to the results of the afore-
mentioned study of the US household population and estimat-
ed that the lifetime prevalence of BED would increase with an
additional 0.1 % to 3.6 % in women and 2.1 % in men [51]. In
a study of a large sample of adult Swedish female twins, a
relatively low lifetime prevalence of 0.17 % for BED was
found, which rose to 0.35 % when DSM-5 criteria were
applied [49].

Mortality

One could describe the mortality rate as an incidence rate in
which the event being measured is death [52]. Mortality
rates are often used as one of the indicators of illness
severity. The standard measures for mortality are the crude
mortality rate (CMR) and the standardized mortality ratio
(SMR). The CMR is the number of deaths within the study
population over a specified period. The SMR is the ratio of
observed deaths in the study population to expected deaths
in the population of origin [18, 19, 52].

Anorexia Nervosa

In a meta-analysis of excess mortality in the 1990s, anorexia
nervosa was associated with the highest rate of mortality
among all mental disorders [53]. In a recent meta-analysis of
35 published studies [54(cid:129)(cid:129)], the weighted CMR for AN was
5.1 deaths (95 % CI: 3.99-6.14) per 1000 person-years,
translating into 5.1 % per decade or 0.51 % per year. One
in five individuals with AN who died had committed suicide
[54(cid:129)(cid:129)]. The overall SMR was 5.86 (95 % CI: 4.17-8.26) with
a mean follow-up period of 14 years. The duration of
follow-up is inversely correlated with the reported SMR;
as duration of follow-up increases, the expected mortality in
the population of origin will increase as well, resulting in
lower SMRs. In a meta-analysis of SMRs in 2001, the
overall SMR of AN in studies with 6–12 years of follow-
up was 9.6 (95 % CI: 7.8-11.5) and in studies with 20–
40 years of follow-up 3.7 (95 % CI: 2.8-4.7) [55]. Age, case
severity and study period influence mortality rates as well
[54(cid:129)(cid:129)]. In a Swedish study [56], a significantly higher mor-
tality rate (4.4 % vs. 1.2 %) was found among female
patients hospitalized due to AN in 1977–1981 compared

with those hospitalized in 1987–1991. The authors argue
that this dramatic decrease in mortality is related to the
introduction of specialized care units for patients with eating
disorders. Finally, in an audit conducted in the UK, death
certificates emerged as a flawed source of information with
both over- and underreporting of AN as a cause of death, the
latter probably more common [19, 57].

Bulimia Nervosa

In a recent meta-analysis of 12 studies describing the mor-
tality rates of patients with BN, a weighted mortality rate of
1.74 per 1000 person-years was found (95 % CI: 1.09-2.44),
which means that per year 0.17 % of BN-patients die. The
overall SMR was 1.93 (95 % CI: 1.44-2.59) [54(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Crow
and colleagues examined mortality in a sample of 1885
patients evaluated for treatment for eating disorders at an
out-patient clinic between 1979 and 1997. Of the 906 BN-
patients, 35 (3.9 %) had died after a mean follow-up of
almost 19 years. Suicide accounted for 23 % of deaths [58].

Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and Binge Eating
Disorder

A recent meta-analysis of six studies describing the mortal-
ity rate of patients with EDNOS reported a weighted annual
mortality rate of 3.31 deaths (95 % CI: 1.48-5.75) per 1000
person-years. The overall SMR was 1.92 (95 % CI: 1.46-
2.52) [54(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Any elevated mortality risk of EDNOS could
be partly explained by the assertion that EDNOS sometimes
reflects the earlier stages of AN [54(cid:129)(cid:129), 59]. None of the six
studies stated that BED was part of the EDNOS category,
which may be explained by the fact that the study periods of
these studies were (in part) before the publication of DSM-
IV in 1994, in which BED was introduced [58–63].

Keel and Brown reviewed six studies describing course
and outcome of BED [64]. Duration of follow-up ranged
from one (four studies) to 12 years (one study). The single
12-year follow-up study provided the only report of deaths
at follow-up: 2 of 68 patients admitted for inpatient treat-
ment of BED had died after 12 years, leading to a CMR of
2.9 % and a non-significant SMR of 2.29 (95 % CI: 0.00-
5.45) [65]. These data from an inpatient sample may not be
representative of patients with BED seen in other settings
[64]. BED is associated with obesity. In a large US
population-based study 42 % of the subjects with a lifetime
diagnosis of BED were obese (BMI >30 kg/m2) at the time
of the interview and also a significantly higher prevalence of
morbid obesity (BMI>40 kg/m2) was found among these
subjects compared to respondents without any eating disor-
der (OR 4.9; 95 % CI: 2.2-11.0) [45]. Obesity and especially
morbid obesity is associated with increased risk for mortal-
ity, although the net effect of obesity on mortality is difficult

412

to quantify [66, 67]. Finally, in a meta-analysis of the
risk of suicide in eating disorders, no suicide had oc-
curred among 246 patients with BED after a mean
follow-up of 5.3 years [68].

occurrence of BN might have decreased since the early
nineties of the last century. All eating disorders have an
elevated mortality risk; AN the most striking. Compared
with the other eating disorders, BED is more common
among males and older individuals.

Eating Disorders in Non-Western Countries
and Among Ethnic Minorities

In the past, eating disorders have been characterized as
culture-bound syndromes, specific to Caucasian subjects in
Western, industrialized societies [69]. Recent studies dem-
onstrate that eating disorders and abnormal eating behaviors
do occur in non-Western countries and among ethnic minor-
ities [48, 70–74]. An increasing occurrence of eating disor-
ders in non-Western countries has been associated with
cultural transition and globalization, including moderniza-
tion, urbanization and media-exposure promoting the West-
ern beauty-ideal [70, 75–77]. The most comprehensive
attempt to quantify eating disorders in a non-Western setting
was conducted on the Caribbean island Curaçao (Nether-
lands Antilles), where the full spectrum of community
health and service providers was contacted. The overall
incidence of AN of 1.82 (95 % CI: 0.74-2.89) per 100 000
person-years was much lower than in the US and Western
Europe. No cases were found among the black population.
However, the incidence of 9.08 (95 % CI: 3.71–14.45)
among the minority mixed and white population was similar
to the incidence in the Netherlands and in the United States
[78]. In the Netherlands, incidence rates of psychiatric hos-
pital admissions for AN did not differ between Netherlands
Antilles immigrants and native Dutch [79], suggesting that
exposure to the Western beauty ideal is a risk factor for the
development of AN, possibly in interaction with migration-
related stress. A similar finding for risk of BED among
Mexican-American immigrants was found by Swanson
and colleagues: In their study of a sample of people of
Mexican origin in Mexico and the US, migration from
Mexico to the US was associated with an increased risk of
BED [80]. A recent study comparing prevalences of eating
disorders across ethnic groups in the United States reported
similar prevalences of AN and BED among non-Latino
whites, Latinos, Asians and African Americans. BN was
more prevalent among Latinos and African Americans than
among non-Latino whites [48].

Conclusions

AN is relatively common among young women. While the
overall incidence rate remained stable over the past decades,
there has been an increase in the high risk-group of 15–
19 year old girls. It is unclear whether this reflects earlier
detection of AN cases or an earlier age at onset. The
