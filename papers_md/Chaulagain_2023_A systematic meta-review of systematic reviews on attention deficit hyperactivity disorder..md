Abstract

Background. There are now hundreds of systematic reviews on attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) of variable quality. To help navigate this literature, we have reviewed
systematic reviews on any topic on ADHD.
Methods. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science
and performed quality assessment according to the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence
Synthesis. A total of 231 systematic reviews and meta-analyses met the eligibility criteria.
Results. The prevalence of ADHD was 7.2% for children and adolescents and 2.5% for adults,
though with major uncertainty due to methodological variation in the existing literature. There
is evidence for both biological and social risk factors for ADHD, but this evidence is mostly
correlational rather than causal due to confounding and reverse causality. There is strong
evidence for the efficacy of pharmacological treatment on symptom reduction in the short-
term, particularly for stimulants. However, there is limited evidence for the efficacy of pharma-
cotherapy in mitigating adverse life trajectories such as educational attainment, employment,
substance abuse, injuries, suicides, crime, and comorbid mental and somatic conditions.
Pharmacotherapy is linked with side effects like disturbed sleep, reduced appetite, and increased
blood pressure, but less is known about potential adverse effects after long-term use. Evidence of
the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments is mixed.
Conclusions. Despite hundreds of systematic reviews on ADHD, key questions are still
unanswered. Evidence gaps remain as to a more accurate prevalence of ADHD, whether
documented risk factors are causal, the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments on any
outcomes, and pharmacotherapy in mitigating the adverse outcomes associated with ADHD.

Introduction

There are hundreds of systematic reviews on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of
variable quality and with partly or fully overlapping scope. This literature is increasingly difficult
to navigate for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. We aim to make this large literature on
ADHD more available by systematically reviewing the published systematic reviews on ADHD
and highlighting recent reviews of high quality where there are overlaps.

Methods

We performed a meta-review [1] to systematically appraise systematic reviews and meta-
analyses published on ADHD-related topics by adopting Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [2] (Supplementary Table S1)
and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for umbrella review [3]. The study protocol
was pre-registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO; CRD42020165638).

Search strategy and selection criteria Table 1

We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies,
using specific keywords (ADHD, systematic review, meta-analysis, see Supplementary 1 for a
description of the search strategy) with no language restrictions. The search included all years and
final search was completed in December 2021. Reference lists of included publications were also
searched. All references from the literature search were imported to Endnote X7.2 [4] and then to

Covidence [5]. Two reviewers (A.C. with I.L. or O.N.) independently
performed title and abstract screening of all articles identified through
database search and full-text screening of more than 95% of articles.
Any discrepancies in assessments were resolved in consensus or by
consulting the third reviewer or the last author (A.M.). To avoid
overlap, when systematic reviews studied identical
topics and
included more than 50% of the same primary articles, we included
only the latest reviews with more studies. The included latest system-
atic reviews and meta-analysis were of similar or high quality com-
pared to the older reviews of same topics (Supplementary Table S2).

Quality appraisal and data extraction

The JBI guideline for quality appraisal and form for data extraction
of systematic review and meta-analysis [6] was amended and
piloted for the purpose of this meta-review (Supplementary 1).
The quality appraisal checklist consists of nine items. Reviews that
scored less than six on low risk of bias were categorized as low
quality and excluded. Reviews scoring six to seven, and eight to nine
were categorized as moderate and high quality reviews, respectively,
and were included. Two reviewers (A.C., I.L.) independently
assessed the quality of 35% of the systematic reviews to ensure
consistency in the quality assessment rating. There was good agree-
ment in quality assessment, and consequently, the remaining 65%
of included studies were scored for quality by one author only. A
similar process was followed for data extraction, where three
reviewers were involved (A.C. with I.L. or O.N.). For each eligible
article, pre-defined information was extracted, including topic
studied, objective, timeframe of database search, main findings
with key estimates, implications for clinical practice and future
research, and conclusions. Further details are in Supplementary 1.

Data presentation

We present the objective, main findings, and conclusions of each
included systematic reviews and meta-analyses in tables dividing
the literature into nine topics of ADHD. In the text, we describe the
literature in terms of a narrative synthesis, where for some reviews
we have also presented effect estimates with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI) for some key findings. For overlapping reviews, we high-
light results based on recency and quality. As the result section is
dense, we have also included summary table that include major
findings, limitations, and recommendation for future systematic
reviews and meta-analyses for each topic.

Results

A total of 1,161 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identi-
fied, where 231 were eligible for inclusion (Figure 1). The reasons

Chaulagain et al.

for exclusions of each article selected for full-text review are pre-
sented in Supplementary Table S3.

Characteristics and quality of included systematic reviews and
meta-analyses

There has been an increase in published reviews annually with a
very high number of reviews published in 2021. The most com-
mon topic for reviews was pharmacological interventions (28%)
(Figure 2). Most of the studies included in reviews were con-
ducted in Europe and North America (34 and 33%, respectively).
Of the total included reviews, 59% were of high quality (Tables
3–11).

Overview of findings

The included reviews were categorized into nine different topics
and the major findings for each topic are presented in Table 2.

Narrative synthesis

Clinical guidelines and assessment (number of studies, n = 5, Table 3)
In a recent systematic review of five clinical practice guidelines, all
guidelines rated stimulants as the first-line pharmacological inter-
vention and recommended the inclusion of psychosocial interven-
tion in the treatment [7].

A meta-analysis of sex differences in ADHD symptoms showed
that boys with ADHD are more hyperactive than girls and have
more difficulties in terms of motor response inhibition and cogni-
tive flexibility [8].

For screening for ADHD in children, the Child Behavior
Checklist-Attention Problem and the Conner’s Rating Scale–
Revised had moderate sensitivity and specificity [9]. Conner’s Rat-
ing Scale and Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD – Symptoms
and Normal-Behaviors were found as valid and time-efficient
measures to assess ADHD symptoms in the classroom [10].

In adults, the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale and the
Wender Utah Rating Scale short version showed the best screening
properties [11].

Prevalence of ADHD (n = 8, Table 4)

Prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents
The prevalence of ADHD among children and adolescents was
assessed in four different meta-analyses [12–15] and one system-
atic review [16]. Internationally, the pooled prevalence of ADHD
in children and adolescents was estimated to be 7.2% (95% CI:
6.7–7.8) in a meta-analysis of 175 studies including more than
1 million participants [12]. Most of the included studies were
conducted within school populations (74%), and few used a
whole-population approach (10%). In a multi-variable analysis,
the prevalence estimate was 2 percentage points lower in studies
conducted in Europe compared to North America after adjusting
for the edition of diagnostic manual and measurement tools which
included clinical interviews, symptom-only criteria, and reports of
ADHD diagnosis [12]. Further, a meta-analysis of prevalence
studies from Africa reported a pooled prevalence of 7.47% (6.0–
9.26). As expected, gender differences were found with a male:
female ratio of 2.0:1.0 [13]. The prevalence in China was 6.26%
(5.36–7.22) [14], while it was 13.87% (9.59–19.64) among black
individuals in the USA [15]. All included reviews reported that
significant heterogeneity in the prevalence attributed to the source

of study population, geographical location, and source of data was
found across included studies.

A systematic review found substantial evidence of overdiag-
nosis of ADHD. The authors reported that ADHD diagnoses have
consistently increased between 1989 and 2017, and that the
majority of new cases were on the milder end of the ADHD
spectrum [17].

Genetic and environmental risk factors associated with ADHD
(n = 41, Table 5)

In this section, we use terms like risk, correlation, protective, and
association according to reports in the systematic reviews, without
indicating causality. Generally, this literature did not bring evi-
dence for conclusions on causality, which will be discussed later.

Prevalence of ADHD in adults
The worldwide pooled prevalence among adults was 4.61% for
persistent adult ADHD and 8.83% for symptomatic adult ADHD
[18]. By adjusting for the “global demographic structure,” the
prevalence of persistent adult ADHD was 2.58% (95% CI:1.51–
4.45) and symptomatic adult ADHD 6.76% (4.31–10.61), translat-
ing to 139.84 and 366.33 million affected adults in 2020 globally.
The meta-analysis found that the prevalence of ADHD decreased
with age [18]. The prevalence among adults aged ≥50 was 2.2%
based on validated scales applied in the general population, and
0.2% when based on clinical diagnosis [19].

Genetic factors
One systematic review found strong evidence that the common
genetic variants underlying ADHD, as measured by the ADHD
polygenic risk score, were associated not only with diagnosed
ADHD but also with more dimensional ADHD traits [20].

Maternal factors
Maternal pre-pregnancy overweight [21], use of antibiotics
[22], acetaminophen [23], and antidepressants [24] during preg-
nancy, and maternal pregestational diabetes [25], but not gesta-
tional diabetes [26], were associated with increased rates of

ADHD in offspring. However, the authors stated that associ-
ations may be due to unmeasured confounding and thus not
causal (e.g.,
the association with maternal overweight was
explained by familial confounding). Maternal smoking during
pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.41–1.72) or smok-
ing cessation during the first trimester was associated with
ADHD in offspring [27]. Similarly, prenatal opioid exposure
was associated with higher ADHD symptom scores (standard-
ized mean difference (SMD) =1.27, 0.79–1.75) [28]. Maternal
exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances was not associated with
ADHD in their children [29].

Perinatal complications like maternal preeclampsia [30], very
preterm birth/very low birth weight (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 2.19–4.21)
[31], or low birth weight [32] were associated with offspring
ADHD. Likewise, the caesarian section was reported to be associ-
ated with later ADHD diagnosis in unadjusted analyses [33], but a
later review reported this association to be partly or entirely
accounted for by residual confounding [34].

A nonlinear relation between parental age and risk for ADHD in
the offspring was found with the highest risk for parents below
20 years and lowest risk for parents in the mid-thirties [35].

While maternal breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk
of ADHD in children [36, 37], postnatal exposure to second-hand
smoking was associated with increased risk (OR = 1.60, 95% CI:
1.30–1.80) [38].

Compared to children with other injuries or without injuries,
children with severe traumatic brain injuries had an increased risk
of being diagnosed with ADHD at less or more than 1 year, respect-
ively, after the injuries [39]. Likewise, two or more exposures to
general anesthesia were associated with an increased risk of ADHD
in later life (relative risk RR = 1.84, 1.14–2.97) [40]. Blood lead level
was associated with higher ADHD rates in children and adolescents
[41]. No significant association was found between polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon exposure and ADHD in children [42, 43],
and there were inconclusive evidence for an association between

exposure to air pollution [44] or polybrominated diphenyl ethers
[45] and ADHD.

According to two included reviews, children being relatively
younger than classmates had higher rates of ADHD diagnosis
[17, 46], with one reporting the relative risk of 1.34 (95% CI:
1.26–1.43) for the youngest children [46]. Further, two reviews
suggested an association between socioeconomic disadvantage
and risk of ADHD [15, 47], with one suggesting it to be mediated
by factors such as parental mental health and maternal smoking
during pregnancy [47]. The evidence regarding child sexual abuse
as a predictor for ADHD was unclear [48].

Dietary pattern, nutrition, and trace elements
Children and adolescents consuming healthy diet had lower risk of
having ADHD compared to those consuming unhealthy diet
[49]. Positive relationship was indicated between total sugar intake
from soft drinks and dietary sources and ADHD symptoms in
children and adolescents [50]. Other nutritional factors associated
with higher rates of ADHD among children and adolescents were
low serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, lower perinatal
and childhood vitamin D status [51], elevated ratios of both blood
omega-6 to omega-3 and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid
fatty acids [52]. Two systematic reviews reported significantly lower
serum manganese levels in children with ADHD [53, 54]. Another
review revealed higher peripheral manganese levels in both blood
and hair in children and adolescents with ADHD compared to
healthy controls [55].

A review from 2021 suggested that brain iron concentrations,
specifically in the thalamus, were lower in children with ADHD
than in healthy controls [56]. However, mixed results were reported
for systemic iron level [56, 57]. In contrast, a review from 2018
concluded that low serum iron levels were associated with ADHD
[58]. There was no difference in zinc levels in blood, serum, plasma
[59] or hair between children and adolescents with ADHD and
healthy controls [60].

ADHD was associated with several biological and

pregnancy, nutrition, repeated general
anesthesia in early childhood, age at school
start

ADHD was associated with school performance
and school dropout, work participation,
welfare dependency, smoking, drug and
alcohol addiction, injuries, suicidal spectrum
behavior, crime, and comorbidities, in
directions as expected

ADHD was associated with a high degree of

comorbid somatic conditions (e.g., obesity,
asthma, headache/migraine, sleep problems)
and psychiatric disorders (e.g., other
neurodevelopmental-, affective-, anxiety-,
and eating disorders)

Stimulants were recommended as first-line

medication both for children
(methylphenidate preferred) and adults
(amphetamine preferred)

Nonstimulants were also found effective in
treating ADHD in children (atomoxetine,
guanfacine) and adults (atomoxetine,
bupropion), though less effective than
stimulants

Side-effects were common and include reduced

appetite, sleep problems, headache,
increased heart rate and increased blood
pressure

Behavioral interventions, parental training,
dietary interventions (like omega-3), and
mindfulness were found to have small but
positive effects in children

However, the evidence for nonpharmacological
treatment effects was more mixed than for
pharmacological treatment

Further, there are also fewer original studies and

fewer reviews

meditation-based therapies have shown
positive effects

The literature describes a rather bleak
prognosis in ADHD, but this may be
exaggerated due to the lack of
adjustment for potential and
residual confounding factors. The
described outcomes of ADHD may
thus not be causally linked to ADHD

Reviews of studies of prognosis in
ADHD properly accounting for
confounding are needed. The
degree of confounding in this
literature may also be subject of a

and un-adjusted studies

Studies are mostly correlational and
lack data on temporality. The
reviews do not sufficiently

Long-term prognosis and life trajectories in
ADHD (n = 19, Table 6)

Education and employment
ADHD was associated with lower educational attainment [61],
including failure to complete high school (OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 2.0–
7.0) and failure to attend tertiary education (OR = 6.47, 4.58–9.14)
[62]. Further, a negative association was found between ADHD and
mathematical ability [63]. Individuals with ADHD were more
prone to experience occupational challenges [61], for example, they
were more often dismissed from work (OR = 3.92, 2.68–5.74),
unemployed (OR = 1.97, 1.01–3.85) [62], and more likely to receive
public welfare payments [61].

Alcohol, smoking, and substance use
Childhood ADHD was significantly associated with alcohol use
disorder [64], including the development of alcohol use disorder
by early adulthood (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.11–1.64) and nicotine
use by middle adolescence (OR = 2.36, 1.71–3.27) [65]. Smokers
with ADHD in childhood smoked significantly more cigarettes
as adolescents
childhood ADHD
[66]. There was an association between ADHD and substance
use disorder [64], with an earlier meta-analysis reporting an
odds ratio of 1.73(1.24–2.41) [62]. The estimated average
prevalence of cocaine use in adults with ADHD was 26.0%
(18.0–35.0) [67].

than smokers without

Injuries, poisoning, and suicidal spectrum behavior
Both children and adults with ADHD were at higher risk of injuries
(OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.63–2.37) [68], including bone fracture [69]
and unintentional physical injuries (OR = 1.53, 1.40–1.67) [70], but
not for sports-related concussions [71]. Children and adolescents
with ADHD also had a higher risk of poisoning than controls
(RR = 3.14, 2.23–4.42) [72]. Suicidal spectrum behavior was higher
in ADHD, including suicidal ideations (OR = 3.53, 2.94–4.25),
suicidal plans, attempts (OR = 2.37, 1.64–3.43), and completed
suicide [73].

Psychotic disorders
Childhood ADHD was associated with an increased risk of subse-
quent psychotic disorders (OR = 4.74, 95% CI: 4.11–5.46) [74].

Criminal offenses and domestic violence
The pooled prevalence of ADHD among individuals in detention
settings was 26.2% (95% CI: 22.7–29.6) [75]. There was a sig-
nificant association between childhood ADHD and adolescent
and adulthood arrests (RR = 2.2, 1.3–3.5), convictions (RR = 3.3,
2.1–5.2), and incarcerations (RR = 2.9, 1.9–4.3) with a younger
age of onset of antisocial involvement and an increased risk of

criminal recidivism [76]. However, there was no conclusive
evidence for an association between ADHD and domestic vio-
lence [77].

Pregnancies and postpartum risk
Adolescent girls with ADHD had an increased risk of teenage and
unintended pregnancies, and women with ADHD had a higher risk
of pregnancy and birth complications, such as pre-eclampsia,
infection, and cesarean section [78].

Global economic burden of ADHD
The per person annual economic burden of ADHD ranged from
$US832 to 20,539 for patients with ADHD, and from $US2,670 to
4,120 for family members of patients with ADHD [79].

ADHD and comorbidities (n = 33, Table 7)

ADHD and other mental and neurological disorders
Children and adolescents with ADHD had significantly higher
rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (SMD = 1.23, 95% CI:
0.94–1.51) [80] and pragmatic language difficulties than healthy
controls [81]. ADHD in adults was strongly related to negative
emotionality and low conscientious inhibition [82]. Similarly, the
prevalence of bipolar disorder among adults with ADHD was
7.95% (5.31–11.06), and with 4 years earlier age of onset than in
bipolar disorder without ADHD [83]. ADHD was associated with
eating disorders (OR = 3.82, 2.34–6.24) [84], with similar findings
reported in several systematic reviews [85, 86]. Reviews have also
shown a link between ADHD and gaming disorder [87] and
internet addiction (OR = 3.76, 2.75–5.15) in adolescents and
young adults [88].

Sleep
While a recent meta-analysis found no significant difference in
sleep parameters between individuals with ADHD and healthy
controls as measured by polysomnography [89], previous meta-
analyses have reported impaired sleep among children with
ADHD [90],
including those measured by polysomnography
[91] or actigraphy [92]. In adults, a meta-analysis showed longer
sleep onset latency and lower sleep efficiency among adults with
ADHD than without ADHD [93]. Clinically, adults with ADHD
had an increased risk of nearly all types of sleep disorders, includ-
ing insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders [94, 95] and sleep
bruxism [96].

Obesity
Associations between ADHD and obesity have been found in
children, adolescents, and adults [94, 97], with one review reporting

the association also after adjustments for possible confounders
(children OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05–1.37; adults OR = 1.55, 1.32–
1.81) [98]. A review on bariatric surgery showed that patients with
ADHD responded equally well as patients without ADHD in terms
of change in body mass index after surgery [99].

Somatic conditions
Associations with ADHD were reported for headache (OR = 1.98,
95% CI: 1.60–2.45) [100], asthma (OR = 1.52, 1.42–1.63) [101] and
(OR = 1.53, 1.41–1.65) [102], eczema (OR = 1.32, 1.20–1.45), and
allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.52, 1.43–1.63) [103]. Associations between
ADHD and other atopic conditions have also been found [94,
104]. ADHD patients had reduced vagally-mediated heart rate
variability (Hedge’s g = 0.20, 0.01–0.40) [105], but no associations
between adult ADHD and diseases of the circulatory system were
found [94].

Other associated conditions
Children with ADHD had two times higher risks of having noc-
turnal enuresis than healthy controls. [106]. Reviews suggested that
the findings were inconsistent for the relation between early signs of
deviating motor functioning or development and later ADHD [107,
108] and on anxiety and social functioning in children and adoles-
cents with ADHD [109].

ADHD in children was associated with a reduction in global
retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (SMD = (cid:1)0.23, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.46 to
(cid:1)0.01) [110] and individuals with ADHD showed more oculomotor
inhibition failure than control groups [111]. Similarly, altered elec-
trophysiological performance monitoring (i.e., reduced error-related
negativity and the error positivity amplitude) during cognitive tasks,
indicative of difficulties in evaluating errors in performance, have
been reported both in children and adults with ADHD [112].

Pharmacological treatment (n = 65, Table 8)

Efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of ADHD medication

Children and adolescents. Systematic reviews have shown effi-
cacy for pharmacological treatment of ADHD, with SMDs between
0.6 and 0.8 and consistently stronger efficacy for stimulants than
nonstimulants [113, 114]. All-cause treatment discontinuation was
lower with pharmacological treatment than placebo (OR = 0.68,
95% CI: 0.58–0.79) [114].

Stimulants. In terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability,
evidence exists for methylphenidate (MPH) as the preferred first
choice for pharmacological treatment of ADHD [115–120]. For
instance, in a network meta-analysis of 82 randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) including more than 14,000 children and adoles-
cents, at time point closest to 12 weeks, with clinician’s rating,
MPH was found to be efficacious in reducing ADHD core symp-
toms as compared to placebo (SMD = –0.78,–0.93 to (cid:1)0.62)
[115]. MPH was the only drug that had better acceptability than
placebo, and with similar tolerability as placebo [115]. A system-
atic review of four prospective or naturalistic studies and three
RCTs showed MPH immediate-release (MPH-IR) as efficacious
also for periods longer than 12 weeks (parent ratings for inatten-
tion and hyperactivity/impulsivity: SMD = 0.96, 0.60–1.32 and
1.12, 0.85–1.39, respectively) [116].

Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) was also efficacious in reducing
ADHD symptoms compared to placebo [121, 122], for example,
as reported in a meta-analysis of 28 double-blind, placebo-

controlled RCTs with around 4,700 participants (SMD = –1.28,
(cid:1)1.84 to (cid:1)0.71) [121].

However, according to the earlier Cochrane review and
meta-analyses, the efficacy of stimulants like MPH [123] and
amphetamine [124] cannot be unequivocally established, due to
methodological limitations. The authors point to small number
of trials, short follow-up time, low-quality data, high risk of bias
in several domains, including lack of sufficient blinding and
selective outcome reporting, and heterogeneity between studies.
This quite divergent conclusion is probably not due to different
evidence included in the systematic reviews, but subjectively
different interpretation of the evidence by the authors of different
reviews.

Nonstimulants. Guanfacine was reported as safe and efficacious
in treating ADHD compared to placebo, pooled (OR = 3.18, 95%
CI: 2.44–4.13) [125]. Compared to placebo, atomoxetine (ATX)
was also reported as safe and efficacious in reducing ADHD symp-
toms. [121, 126]. A meta-analysis from 1999 also suggested similar
findings for clonidine [127]. However, as for stimulants, meta-
analyses and Cochrane review stated that the efficacy of some of
the nonstimulants cannot be established due to short follow-up
time, low quality, limited number of studies, sample sizes, and
heterogeneity [128–130]. There is thus disagreement on how to
interpret the literature also for nonstimulants.

Adults

Stimulants. A network meta-analysis of 52 RCTs, including
more than 10,000 adults, supported amphetamines as the pre-
ferred first pharmacological choice for treatment of ADHD both
regarding efficacy (clinicians’ ratings, SMD = –0.79, 95% CI:
(cid:1)0.99 to (cid:1)0.58) and tolerability (OR = 3.26, 1.54–6.92)
[115]. Other reviews have also shown the efficacy of LDX, with
one meta-analysis of 19 RCTs with more than 5,500 participants,
reporting an SMD of (cid:1)0.89 ((cid:1)1.09 to (cid:1)0.70) [131] and another
suggesting an SMD of (cid:1)0.97 ((cid:1)1.15 to (cid:1)0.78) [132] for short-
term treatment, compared to placebo. MPH also showed efficacy
compared to placebo
in reducing ADHD symptoms as
(OR = 2.66, 2.12–3.33), and in terms of treatment discontinu-
ation no significant difference was found between MPH and
placebo (OR = 1.19, 0.82–1.74) [133]. An indirect comparison
meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials from 2008 suggested
shorter-acting stimulants, specifically IR-MPH as efficacious in
reducing ADHD symptoms in adults [134]. There was disagree-
ment on how to interpret the original efficacy studies for adults as
well. Cochrane reviews suggested that due to high risk of bias,
limited sample sizes and number of studies, and heterogeneity in
findings, the quality of the evidence for the efficacy of immediate-
release MPH (compared to placebo or lithium) [135] and
amphetamine (compared to placebo) [136] was low to very-low.

Nonstimulants. In a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs with around 3,400
participants, ATX was found to have small efficacy in reducing the
severity of ADHD symptoms (SMD = –0.33, 95% CI: (cid:1)0.43 to
(cid:1)0.23) and increased rates of discontinuation compared to placebo
(OR = 1.39, 1.17–1.64) [137]. Cochrane review found low-quality
evidence to conclude about the efficacy of bupropion in reducing
ADHD symptoms severity and its tolerability compared to placebo
[138]. In another review, bupropion was found to be as efficacious
as MPH, but due to limited number of studies, the authors sug-
gested the findings as preliminary [128].

Chaulagain et al.

ADHD pharmacotherapy as a class
A network meta-analysis suggested that, despite a positive class
effect of ADHD medication relative to placebo in improving clinical
response, the quality of evidence was low to very low about the
efficacy of different ADHD drugs on treating ADHD symptoms in
adults [139].

Adverse effect of ADHD medication

Cardiovascular. Patients in all age groups showed significant
increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure (SBP) from
pre- to post-treatment when treated with MPH as compared to
placebo (for SBP, SMD = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.81–2.41 for children and
adolescents and SMD = 1.40, 0.62–2.18 for adults) [140]. Further-
more, children and adolescents treated with ATX had a significant
increase in SBP compared to those treated with MPH [140]. How-
ever, no association was found between ADHD medication and
the number of serious adverse medical events including sudden
death, arrhythmia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause
mortality [141].
Sleep. Longer sleep latency (effect size = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.28–0.81)
and shorter sleep duration (effect size = (cid:1)0.59, (cid:1)0.84 to –0.35) were
noted in children and adolescents that used stimulants [142]. Simi-
lar findings were noted for children treated with MPH as measured
by actigraphy for both longer sleep latency and shorter sleep
duration [143].

Headache. Children and adolescents that used ADHD drugs were
at increased risk of having headache during treatment period
compared to placebo (for guanfacine, OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.12–
1.82; for MPH, OR = 1.33, 1.09–1.63) [100].

Appetite. Short-term MPH treatment decreased appetite rela-
tive to placebo (RR = 3.66, 95% CI: 2.56–5.23) [144]. This was
also found for extended-release mixed amphetamine salts and
ATX [145].

Pregnancy and postpartum-related side effects. No evidence
of adverse offspring consequences of ADHD medication during
pregnancy was found [78, 146, 147]. MPH was reported as safe to
use during breastfeeding, while the reported stimulating effect of
guanfacine on prolactin secretion was considered to affect breast-
feeding negatively [78].

Adverse events of MPH treatment
A meta-analysis showed low quality and reliability of evidence for
adverse events of both short and long-term MPH treatment in
children and adolescents and young adults [148].

Efficacy of medication on ADHD symptoms in patients with
comorbid conditions
Seven systematic reviews reported about the efficacy of medica-
tion on ADHD symptoms in patients with comorbid disorders
[149–156]. For example, both MPH and ATX were efficacious in
reducing ADHD symptoms also in youth with ASD [149]. MPH
was further found to decrease ADHD symptoms compared to
placebo in children and adolescents with borderline intellectual
functioning or intellectual disability (ID) (Hedges’ g = 0.87, 95%
CI: 0.61–1.14) [150]. However, another review stated that the
quality of evidence to conclude MPH as efficacious in treating
ADHD symptoms in ID as poor [151]. No sufficient evidence was
found to conclude about the effect of either amphetamine [157]

or risperidone [158] in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in
people with ID.

Efficacy of medication on comorbidity and other consequences of
ADHD
In general, pharmacotherapy for ADHD was found to be efficacious
(SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25–0.55) in reducing both ADHD symp-
toms and substance use in patients with both ADHD and substance
use disorder [159].

ADHD medications generally lowered the risk of injury (rate
ratio = 0.76, 0.61–0.93) in individuals with ADHD, based on
within-individual analysis [160]. However, a recent meta-analysis
revealed higher risk of bone fracture among individuals treated with
nonstimulants for ADHD (OR = 1.37, 1.20–1.58) whereas lower,
but nonsignificant risk was observed for individuals treated with
stimulants [161].

Youths treated with stimulants had lower smoking rates than
untreated youths with ADHD (OR = 0.51, 0.32–0.80) [162]. -
Further, long-term use (>90 days) of stimulants among ADHD
individuals was associated with lower risk of suicide attempt
(RR = 0.75, 0.66–0.84), based on within-individual analysis
[163].

In-school assignment was increased by 15% and on-task
behavior by 14% or more among ADHD children treated with
stimulants [164]. Likewise, MPH improved instrumental learn-
ing in children with ADHD [165]. Compared to placebo adult
ADHD patients using MPH scored better on several neurocog-
nitive measures and tests of driving ability (Hedge’s g = 0.17,
0.05–0.28) [166].

Effect modification of comorbid conditions and drug effects on
cooccurring symptoms
Comorbid anxiety did not change the efficacy of ATX on ADHD in
children, adolescents, and adults [167]. While ADHD medications
like MPH and ATX showed smaller effects, LDX was moderately
efficacious in treating emotional dysregulation in adults with
ADHD (SMD = –0.50; 95% CI: (cid:1)0.80–0.21) [168]. Compared to
placebo, stimulants were efficacious in reducing both overt and
covert aggression in children and adolescents with ADHD
[169]. Similarly, risperidone reduced aggressive behavior in youth
with ADHD [170].

Pharmacogenetics and animal models
While noradrenergic gene polymorphisms were associated with
improved MPH response in children with ADHD [171], low-
quality evidence exists regarding the impact of SLC6A3 poly-
morphisms in response to MPH in children with ADHD
[172]. No effect was found for MPH on hypertensive rats as an
animal model of ADHD [173].

Pharmacological treatment rate
The first systematic review on undertreatment, overtreatment, and
misuse of ADHD medication reported that 19.1% (95% CI: 11.5–
29.9) of school-aged children and adolescents having ADHD were
treated with medication for the disorder, and 0.9% (0.5–1.7) of
individuals without the diagnosis used medication for ADHD.
Their findings indicated both overtreatment and misuse of drugs
in individuals without ADHD, and undertreatment of ADHD
drugs in youths with the disorder [174].

Nonpharmacological treatment (n = 42, Table 9)

Children and adolescents
Behavioral interventions, including social and academic skills
training, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), parent coaching
on social skills, and stress management, were found to decrease
the child’s ADHD symptoms and conduct problems and improve
social skills, academic performance, and positive parenting when
reported by proximal observers [175]. Effects on parenting and
children’s conduct problems persisted when assessment was
blinded [175]. Parental training was an efficacious intervention
for reducing ADHD symptoms in preschool children (Hedges’
g = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33–0.65) and negative parenting style, as based
on parents’ rating [176].

In a school-based setting, combined interventions, including
social skills training, behavior modification technique, study and
organizations skills training, were found to improve ADHD symp-
toms, as rated by both teachers and parents [177]. Daily behavior
report cards were associated with reductions in teacher-rated
ADHD symptoms [178] and improvement in academic outcomes
[177]. Peer-inclusion interventions led to moderate improvements
in pre-post measure of social functioning (Hedges’ g = 0.58, 0.45–
0.70) among those receiving treatment [179].

Results were mixed for the efficacy of cognitive interventions in
reducing ADHD symptoms and for improving working memory
performance [180–182]. Virtual reality-based interventions were
more effective than other nonpharmacological interventions or no
intervention in improving sustained attention in children and
adolescents with ADHD [183]. Interventions based on mind–body
therapies [184] and few-foods diet, that is diet elimination of many
foods and additives, have shown positive effects on ADHD core
symptoms [185]. However, homeopathy did not show positive
effects in reducing ADHD symptoms [186].

Several reviews suggested that despite their wide applications,
significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the effectiveness of
various nonpharmacological interventions. These include mindful-
ness [187–189], neurofeedback [190–193], behavioral interventions
[193], cognitive training [193], dietary interventions [194–201],
herbal interventions [202, 203], parent and teacher training [204,
205], social skills training [206], school-based interventions [207],
equine-assisted therapies [208, 209], video modeling [210], acu-
puncture [211], and physical exercise [212].

Adults
In adults, long-term, that is at least 12 months follow-up of psy-
chotherapies (CBT, dialectical behavioral therapy, mindfulness-
based cognitive therapy) showed greater improvement in self-
reported total ADHD symptoms (SMD = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.22–
1.21), inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity in intervention
than control groups [213]. One systematic review suggested that
CBT might improve the core symptoms of ADHD, but the evidence
was of low quality [214]. CBT was also efficacious in treating
in adults with ADHD
comorbid-internalizing
[215]. Mind–body therapies including meditation were efficacious
in reducing ADHD core symptoms compared to, for example,
treatment as usual, although the evidence was of low quality [216].
Evidence for behavioral intervention to improve driving skills in
young train novice drivers with ADHD was
inconclusive
[217]. Transcranial direct current stimulation might have some
effect on neuropsychological and cognitive deficits, but there was
no evidence to suggest that it decreases ADHD symptoms [218].

Pharmacological versus nonpharmacological treatment
(n = 7, Table 10)

Two meta-analyses have reported the efficacy of stimulant treat-
ment compared to nonstimulant or other interventions [219,
220]. A network meta-analysis of 190 RCTs found stimulants
to be superior compared to nonpharmacological treatment in
children and adolescents with ADHD [220]. While medications
like extended release-MPH, amphetamine formulations, ATX,
and extended release-guanfacine improved ADHD symptoms,
psychosocial treatments were beneficial for academic and organ-
izational skills in adolescents [221]. Results from head-to-head
trials comparing MPH and neurofeedback were too inconsistent
to conclude [222]. Similarly, findings for the efficacy of MPH
versus traditional Chinese medicine were suggested by earlier
review [223].

A recent systematic review revealed that stimulant treatment
appeared to be cost-effective compared to other treatments or no
treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents [224]. Similar
findings for pharmacotherapy as a whole were suggested by earlier
review [225].

Patients’ and caregivers’ experience of ADHD beyond symptoms
(n = 13, Table 11)

Impact on quality of life
Of the two included reviews on health-related quality of life of
children and adolescents with ADHD, one found that the parents
reported significantly worse health-related quality of life of their
children than that reported by the children with ADHD themselves
[226], while the other review suggested no such differences [227].

Experience with ADHD, pharmacological and
nonpharmacological interventions
Individuals with ADHD experience poor academic functioning,
pressure to fit in with societal rules and expectations, fear of stigma,
and difficulties in being part of the workplace and performing work
tasks [228–230]. However, they may also recognize the positive and
rewarding aspects of having ADHD [228–230].

Patients with ADHD and their caregivers experience medication
as a last resort [231] or as a coping strategy [230]. Some experience
that starting medication trigger off an identity crisis [228,
231]. There were reports of concerns about the long-term side
effects of medication and financial costs, and the decision of taking
medication was based on a process of “pro and con” considerations
[228, 231]. Educators, children, and adolescents with ADHD, and
their parents felt that school-based nonpharmacological interven-
tions can lead to stigma, but also improve relationships and atti-
tudes [232].

Parenting a child with ADHD was felt as exhausting and emo-
tional journey filled with feelings of guilt, frustration, although “not
all bad” [229, 233]. The most commonly used coping strategy of
parents seemed to be avoidant-focused coping and was linked to
distress and depression [234, 235].

Societal and familial barriers to ADHD treatment
Reviews of qualitative studies found perceived stigma as a barrier
for acknowledging ADHD by primary care practitioners [236] and
for implementing nonpharmacological
intervention in schools
[237]. There was no sufficient evidence to conclude if poverty
moderates psychosocial treatment efficacy for ADHD [238].

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic meta-review
that summarizes the main findings of 231 existing systematic reviews
and meta-analyses on ADHD of moderate to high quality.

Different from earlier narrative reviews of evidence-based conclu-
sions about ADHD [239–241], we have pre-registered the protocol,
adhered to the PRISMA and JBI guidelines to perform a systematic
quality assessment of the included reviews. However, our review has
some limitations that should be considered. Importantly, this meta-
review is not an overview of all published literature on ADHD but
limited to academic publications on ADHD covered by systematic
reviews and meta-analyses of moderate to high quality, indexed in the
five most relevant databases or found in reference lists. Grey literature
publications were not covered in our search. Secondly, our inclusion
criteria and threshold for quality assessment were quite strict, thus
excluding some of the pertinent systematic reviews on topics includ-
ing genetics [242–249], neurobiology [250, 251], prevalence including
young adults [252–254], comorbidities like dyslexia [255, 256], speech
disorder [257], borderline personality disorder [258] and nonphar-
macological interventions in adults [259].

Nevertheless, this meta-review will aid both researchers and
clinicians to get an update on the main conclusions from ADHD
research. Importantly our review may also be used as a bird’s eye
view by identifying areas where there is sufficient evidence, insuf-
ficient evidence, and systematic weaknesses in reviews in various
fields of ADHD. In the following, we will summarize some of our
key findings with emphasis on weaknesses in the literature of
systematic reviews on ADHD.

Prevalence of ADHD

According to included meta-analyses, the prevalence of ADHD is
7.2% in children [12] and 2.5% in adults [18]. However, there is
considerable variation in the reported prevalence between the original
studies included in these reviews. This strong variation is not fully
understood, although probably due to other factors than true pheno-
type differences within or between populations studied. More plaus-
ible explanations for the variation in prevalence might include:
(i) There are differences in research design, applied diagnostic instru-
ments, and source of
information which may cause bias
[252]. (ii) There may be variation in provider-preference, that is
clinician-dependent variation in assessment and diagnostic decisions
[260]. This variation may be caused by variation in clinicians’ atti-
tudes toward ADHD diagnosis and medications, for example, from a
liberal to a restrictive position, even within uniform health systems
[261]. (iii) There may be variation in supply [262–264] and demand
[265] of health services, which in turn ultimately will affect variation
in rates of diagnosed ADHD. (iv) Finally, the rate of diagnosed
ADHD has increased over the last decades, both in children [12, 17,
266] and adults [18]. This may reflect a previous under-recognition of
ADHD or increasing over-diagnosis [17]. Hence, this has left the field
of ADHD research with the question of how certain are we of the
prevalence of ADHD? The uncertainty is not merely a question of
narrowing the confidence interval in meta-analyses by including
more studies. More sophisticated reviews are needed, addressing
the issues of various forms of bias in original studies.

Risk factors for ADHD: Correlations versus causality
There is evidence of a whole range of ADHD “risk factors,” includ-
ing for example biological [20], maternal [21–28, 30, 31, 35],

Chaulagain et al.

environmental [39, 41, 46], social [47], and nutritional factors
[49, 50]. However, this literature is mostly based on research
designs precluding conclusions on causality due to problems with
confounding, and reverse causality. Adjustment for confounders
usually makes a difference in such correlational studies, indicating
residual confounding due to a lack of information on potential
confounders or the reliability of measured confounders. As an
example, maternal smoking has, and still is, consistently associated
with offspring ADHD in classical epidemiological studies. How-
ever, later years’ research, combining different approaches, has
shown that this association is not causal, but mainly due to genetic
confounding [267–269]. Hence, we need more original studies that
integrate results from different methodological approaches [270],
allowing for causal inference.

Long-term prognosis of ADHD

The included reviews indicate a rather bleak prognosis over months
and years of follow-up for young patients with ADHD in terms of
criminal behavior [75, 76], school dropout [61, 62], vocational
challenges [61, 62], injuries [68–70], comorbidities [80, 83, 84],
and welfare dependency [61]. However, ADHD is correlated with a
whole range of “risk factors” which themselves may be causally
linked to challenging life trajectories. Studies of prognosis in
ADHD may thus be confounded, and overestimate the negative
prognosis of ADHD.

Since ADHD is a very heterogeneous condition, studies focusing
more on predictors for different prognostic trajectories would be
more informative and fruitful both for increasing our understand-
ing of underlying mechanisms, targeting treatment, and preventing
negative outcomes. Future systematic reviews should specifically
address issues of publication bias, confounding, and residual con-
founding, and aim to highlight studies allowing for causal inference.

Pharmacological treatment of ADHD

There is strong evidence for ADHD symptom reduction during
weeks or even months of stimulant use [113, 115, 121, 131] and also
some evidence for nonstimulant medication [121, 137] in both
children, adolescents, and adults. There is, however, an interesting
controversy on how solid the trial evidence on ADHD medication
efficacy is. Several reviews on both children and adults, and for both
stimulant and nonstimulant pharmacotherapy, conclude with cau-
tion as to conclusions on efficacy [123, 124, 128, 130, 135, 139, 157,
158].

The follow-up time in trials is generally in terms of weeks, and
the focus has mainly been on symptom scales rather than real-life
outcomes [113, 115]. We need systematic review evidence on the
efficacy of ADHD pharmacotherapy to mitigate the negative prog-
nosis in ADHD. Can we prevent criminal behavior, school dropout,
poor academic performance, vocational challenges, accidents, sui-
cide, comorbidities, and welfare dependency, during years of
follow-up, with pharmacological therapies? This is perhaps the
most pressing question in the ADHD community, and it is yet to
be answered. It should be noted that RCTs due to ethical and
practical reasons, and conventional epidemiological studies due
to the issue of residual confounding, have not been able to address
this evidence gap [260]. We need evidence for efficacy based on
large-scale, population-based studies with research designs
allowing for causal
inference as to the efficacy of ADHD
medication in mitigating the rather bleak life trajectory in
ADHD. These studies need to reach beyond symptom relief over

European Psychiatry

85

weeks follow-up, but rather address outcomes regarding life-
trajectories with over several years follow-up as to criminal
behavior [75, 76], school dropout [61, 62], vocational challenges
[61, 62], injuries [68–70], comorbidities [80, 83, 84], and welfare
dependency [61, 271].

Nonpharmacological treatment of ADHD

The evidence on the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatment
for ADHD is more mixed than that of pharmacotherapies. Mixed
evidence exists for almost all type of nonpharmacological inter-
ventions: behavioral intervention for children and adolescents
[175, 177, 193] and for adults [213, 214], parental training [175,
176, 204, 205], dietary interventions [194–201], mindfulness
[184, 187–189], and other interventions. One reason may be that
these interventions are more complex both to deliver and
study, for example, therapies being less standardized than drugs,
and also that it is more difficult to design blinded and “placebo”--
controlled conditions for these more complex intervention.
Despite this mixed evidence, ADHD treatments beyond phar-
macotherapies are commonly administered and recommended
in clinical guidelines [7].

Conclusion

In this meta-review, we found a large number of reviews that have
reasonably well elucidated the evidence for different topics on
ADHD. However, when summarizing the findings from the
included reviews we still see some important knowledge gaps, for
example on prevalence and risk factors. The most pressing know-
ledge gap is probably that of the efficacy of current ADHD treat-
ments in mitigating the rather bleak life trajectory in ADHD.
Hence, future systematic reviews and meta-analyses should address
the identified knowledge gaps related to ADHD. To some extent,
the lack of systematic review and meta-analysis evidence reflects
lack of relevant original studies on ADHD.
