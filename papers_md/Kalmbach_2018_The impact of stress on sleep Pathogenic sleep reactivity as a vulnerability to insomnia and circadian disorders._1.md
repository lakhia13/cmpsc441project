vulnerability to insomnia and circadian disorders

Summary

Sleep reactivity is the trait-like degree to which stress exposure disrupts sleep, resulting in 
difficulty falling and staying asleep. Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience 
drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed 
largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, 
female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further 
work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical 
networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high 
sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high 
sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep 
insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and 
anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, 
thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective 
assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-
work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. 
Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, 
patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on 
sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective 
associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value 
for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.

INTRODUCTION

Insomnia disorder affects 7% of adults in the EU (Wittchen et al., 2011) and 9–20% of 
adults in the USA (Morin, LeBlanc, Daley, Gregoire, & Merette, 2006; Roth et al., 2011), 
with incidence rates at 7–10% in the USA (LeBlanc et al., 2009; Morin et al., 2006; 
Singareddy et al., 2012). Upwards of 37% of adults in the UK complain of insomnia 
(Morphy, Dunn, Lewis, Boardman, & Croft, 2007), whereas 19% of adults in France report 
the disorder (Leger, Guilleminault, Dreyfus, Delahaye, & Paillard, 2000). Indeed, the 
insomnia epidemic is reflected by high prevalence rates across the globe (Cho et al., 2009; 
Kim, Uchiyama, Okawa, Liu, & Ogihara, 2000; Panda et al., 2012; Xiang et al., 2008). 
Insomnia disorder has devastating effects on psychological (Baglioni et al., 2011; Riemann 
& Voderholzer, 2003) and cardiometabolic health (Palagini et al., 2013; Vgontzas, 
Fernandez-Mendoza, Liao, & Bixler, 2013) and heavily burdens the economy (Daley, Morin, 
LeBlanc, Grégoire, & Savard, 2009). Although pharmacological and cognitive-behavioural 
treatments for insomnia have proven efficacy and may limit morbidity (Drake, Roehrs, & 
Roth, 2003; Koffel, Koffel, & Gehrman, 2015; Okajima, Komada, & Inoue, 2011; Riemann 
& Perlis, 2009; Roehrs & Roth, 2012; Smith et al., 2002), relapse rates are high (Morin et 
al., 2009) and the field has struggled to develop preventive interventions. Disrupting the 
progression of insomnia is naturally difficult while its pathophysiology remains enigmatic, 
but recent advances using stress-diathesis models of insomnia have offered critical insights 
into its disease processes.

The stress response is highly complex, as highlighted by identical stressors of equal potency 
eliciting different reactions across individuals (Ellis, Jackson, & Boyce, 2006; Pacak & 
Palkovits, 2001; Selye, 1985). Indeed, the differential resilience of various 
psychoneurobiological systems to the ravages of stress exposure moderates vulnerability to 
many medical and psychological illnesses (Kobasa, Maddi, & Courington, 1981; Pacak & 
Palkovits, 2001; Selye, 1985). In other words, stress-related pathologies often manifest in 
accordance with the constitutionally weak systems being overwhelmed by pathogenic stress. 
It is thus crucial to identify and characterize underlying mechanisms of vulnerable systems. 
One such process is the degree to which a given amount of stress (cognitive, physiological, 
etc.) disrupts the sleep system, which has been described as sleep reactivity (Drake, Pillai, & 
Roth, 2013). A burgeoning body of research points to sleep reactivity as a key aetiological 
vulnerability to insomnia and possibly other sleep and stress-related disorders. In this 
review, we discuss the concept of sleep reactivity, its aetiological role in sleep–wake 
disorders and other areas of disease, its neurobiological bases, and relationship with 
cognitive-emotional processes.

2 |  SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA

A literature search was conducted for all articles published before and including December 
2017 using the search terms ‘sleep reactivity’, ‘stress-related sleep disturbance’ and ‘stress’, 
along with ‘sleep’ and ‘Ford insomnia response to stress test’ in the PubMed and Google 
Scholar databases. Additional references were identified by reviewing manuscript reference

3 |  STRESS AND SLEEP

Stress-diathesis theories constitute the most empirically robust aetiological models of many 
forms of pathology, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, 
cardiovascular disease, infectious disease (Hammen, 2005; Hill, 2001; McKeever & Huff, 
2003; Ordovas et al., 2002; Walker & Diforio, 1997) and, of course, insomnia and other 
sleep and circadian pathologies (Drake & Wright, 2011; Morin, Rodrigue, & Ivers, 2003; 
Riemann et al., 2015; Singareddy et al., 2012). The literature on stress and sleep is as vast as 
it is rich, and its comprehensive analysis deserves its own review. Here, we broadly describe 
the stress–sleep relationship to serve as a backdrop for a more in-depth review of sleep 
reactivity. For more thorough examinations of stress and sleep, please refer to reviews on 
stress dysregulation in sleep (Basta, Chrousos, Vela-Bueno, & Vgontzas, 2007; Buckley & 
Schatzberg, 2005; Meerlo, Sgoifo, & Suchecki, 2008; Steiger, 2002) and the neurobiology of 
insomnia (Feige et al., 2013; Palagini, Biber, & Riemann, 2014; Riemann et al., 2010, 2015) 
and short sleep insomnia (Vgontzas et al., 2013), as well as investigations on structural brain 
abnormalities in insomnia (Riemann et al., 2007; Stoffers et al., 2012, 2013, 2014; Van 
Someren et al., 2013).

Overall, the literature presents a dynamic and complex relationship between stress and sleep, 
but one that is unequivocally dysbiotic, wherein exposure to stressful events (such as major 
life events and daily hassles) impairs normal sleep function (Bastien, Vallieres, & Morin, 
2004; Friedman, Brooks, Bliwise, Yesavage, & Wicks, 1995; Hall et al., 2000, 2007, 2008; 
Healey et al., 1981; LeBlanc et al., 2009; Mezick et al., 2009; Morin et al., 2003; Pillai, 
Roth, Mullins, & Drake, 2013). Even so, given the complicated inner workings of stress 
regulation, individuals do not exhibit uniform sleep responses to stress, either in 
manifestation or severity (Bonnet & Arand, 2003; Drake, Richardson, Roehrs, Scofield, & 
Roth, 2004). Indeed, evidence roundly rejects a uniform dose–response relationship across 
individuals (Drake et al., 2013; Morin et al., 2003; Pillai et al., 2013; Sadeh, Keinan, & 
Daon, 2004). Rather, the impact of a given dose of stress on sleep includes a differential 
sleep response across individuals (Bonnet & Arand, 2003). Myriad factors, including (but 
not limited to) event appraisal (Morin et al., 2003), stressor chronicity (Pillai et al., 2013), 
coping behaviour (Morin et al., 2003; Pillai et al., 2013; Sadeh et al., 2004), cognitive-
emotional and psychological defects (Chung, Chang, Yang, Kuo, & Hsu, 2009; Fortunato & 
Harsh, 2006; Morin et al., 2003; Pillai & Drake, 2014; Pillai et al., 2013; Williams & Moroz, 
2009; Zoccola, Dickerson, & Lam, 2009), and substance misuse (Pillai et al., 2013), impact 
the sleep response to stress (see Figure 1). However, it was unknown until relatively recently 
whether a sleep-specific trait vulnerability, potentially distinct from these cognitive, 
emotional and behavioural processes, represented an individual predisposition to insomnia 
from a broad array of triggers, including several of those listed above.

It has long been held that insomnia begins with an organic predisposition towards poor sleep 
and wake-promoting hyperarousal (Borkovec, 1982). Indeed, insomnia disorder is often 
triggered by stressful life events, and physiologically and cognitive-emotionally induced 
hyperarousal can interfere with sleep and lead to chronic insomnia in a subset of the 
population (Drake et al., 2013; Ellis, Gehrman, Espie, Riemann, & Perlis, 2012; Singareddy 
et al., 2012). Although predisposition to insomnia may include broad cognitive-emotional

underpinnings, a highly specific and independent physiological vulnerability to exaggerated 
sleep responses to stress may be equally or perhaps even more so germane to insomnia 
aetiology and course.

The substantial differences across individuals in risk of insomnia following stress exposure 
highlight the moderating influence of endogenous neurobiological vulnerabilities. An 
important goal of current sleep research is thus the identification of premorbid 
vulnerabilities to insomnia, and the delineation of their interaction with environmental 
triggers. Individuals with insomnia exhibit exaggerated neurobiological and cognitive-
emotional reactivity to stress (Baglioni, Spiegelhalder, Lombardo, & Riemann, 2010; Drake 
& Roth, 2006; Drake et al., 2004; Fernández-Mendoza et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2003; 
Riemann et al., 2010). Until recently it was unclear whether this exaggerated stress reactivity 
had a sleep-specific component (see Figure 2) and, if so, whether this exaggerated reactivity 
preexisted or was a consequence of insomnia disorder (Palagini et al., 2014). Although 
growing evidence suggests that stress dysregulation typically preexists and even contributes 
to insomnia development, it had been unclear until recently whether this dysregulation 
produces a uniquely sleep-specific vulnerability or rather a broad cognitive-emotional 
response that can impact a myriad of stress-linked physiological systems, such as sleep 
regulation, the autonomic nervous system, cardiovascular regulation and gastrointestinal 
function (Drake et al., 2013; Fernández-Mendoza et al., 2010). In recent years, research has 
identified that a sleep-specific component of stress reactivity exists, and the degree to which 
stress reactivity manifests in the sleep system has been referred to as situational insomnia 
(Bonnet & Arand, 2003) and, now more commonly, sleep reactivity (Drake et al., 2004).

4 |  SLEEP REACTIVITY: A CONCEPTUALIZATION

A vignette: Adrian and Addison are both laid off from work. There are presumably similar 
psychosocial contexts, stressor potency and cognitive reactions for both former employees, 
but even so Adrian begins having significant difficulty falling and staying asleep at night. In 
contrast, Addison has a couple of mildly disturbed nights, but overall continues to sleep 
reasonably well. Here, Addison’s largely unperturbed sleep reflects a robust sleep system 
resilient to the saprogenic cognitive and non-sleep effects of stress (e.g. increased heart rate, 
gastrointestinal disturbance, etc.). By comparison, the system regulating sleep–wake 
function in Adrian is weaker and thereby predisposed to exaggerated disruptions to its 
homeostatic pattern. How this develops into chronic insomnia disorder can involve 
additional responses and vulnerabilities (cognitive, behavioural, etc.), but it is this initial 
sleep-specific vulnerability to acute sleep disruption that characterizes Adrian’s high level of 
sleep reactivity and risk of insomnia disorder.

In its most simple conceptualization, sleep reactivity is the degree to which a stressor 
(broadly defined) disrupts sleep; behaviourally, sleep reactivity is the degree to which 
individuals exhibit acute sleep-disruptive responses to stress. Other terms used to describe 
sleep reactivity include sleep system sensitivity, stress reactivity of the sleep system and 
vulnerability to stress-related insomnia. It is important to emphasize here that sleep 
reactivity is a normal phenomenon, as all individuals experience some degree of difficulty 
sleeping when faced with certain sleep challenges. Even mild challenges, including

unfamiliar sleep environments, small circadian shifts and ill-timed low-dose stimulants, 
produce transient sleep difficulties in many individuals (Bonnet & Arand, 2003).

Individuals vary greatly in the degree to which they experience stress-related sleep problems 
(Bonnet & Arand, 2003; Drake et al., 2004; Jarrin, Chen, Ivers, & Morin, 2014). Highly 
reactive sleepers experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with 
low sleep reactivity can proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Moreover, sleep reactivity 
exhibits trait-like characteristics such that individuals’ sleep responses to stress are 
consistent over time and across a variety of stressful stimuli (e.g. caffeine, and change in 
bedtime or sleep environment) (Bonnet & Arand, 2003; Drake et al., 2004; Jarrin, Chen, 
Ivers, Drake, & Morin, 2016). By extension, sleep reactivity is most pathologically and ergo 
clinically pertinent when in excess, as observed in those with exaggerated and non-
retractable sleep disturbances during or even following the removal of stress (Drake et al., 
2013; Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016b).

5 |  ROOTS IN SITUATIONAL INSOMNIA

Situational insomnia refers to poor sleep in response to specific stressful circumstances, but 
of course somnological responses to uniform stressors differ across individuals, thus 
reflecting varying degrees of sensitivity of the sleep system (Bonnet & Arand, 2003; Drake 
et al., 2004). Insomnia researchers proposed that exaggerated disruptions in sleep in 
response to stress, even prior to any history of sleep morbidity, may be a marker for 
vulnerability to insomnia disorder (Bonnet & Arand, 2003; Drake et al., 2004).

In a landmark study on stress response and sleep, Bonnet and Arand (2003) investigated the 
consistency of situational insomnia across several stressful conditions in individuals without 
any history of sleep or circadian pathology. The authors leveraged the well-established first 
night effects of polysomnography (PSG), characterized as sleep difficulty when initially 
exposed to overnight PSG monitoring during an adaptation night. In this study, subjects 
underwent a PSG adaptation night, and PSG-defined sleep efficiency (time asleep/time in 
bed) was used to divide the sample into good sleepers (top quartile in efficiency) and those 
with ‘situational insomnia’ (bottom quartile). Confirming that the insomnia was indeed 
situational, sleep efficiency in the situational insomnia group increased into the normal range 
on a second night of PSG monitoring (i.e. after the so-called first night effects have worn 
off). Nevertheless, subjects in the situational insomnia group exhibited lower sleep efficiency 
than good sleepers during subsequent nights in response to circadian phase advance (lights 
out 3 or 6 hr prior to habitual bedtime) and administration of 400 mg of caffeine 30 min 
prior to lights out. The authors pointed to reduced parasympathetic activity as a potential 
autonomic marker of situational insomnia. These findings suggest that stress reactivity 
within the sleep system is consistent across various situational stressors for a segment of 
historically good sleepers, and that stress-related sleep disturbances may have 
neurobiological underpinnings in autonomic dysregulation. Bonnet and Arand’s (2003) early 
work led to further research on the aetiological role of stress reactivity of the sleep system in 
sleep pathology; namely, insomnia disorder.

6 |  MEASURING SLEEP REACTIVITY

Given the normal distribution of insomnia in the population (Beattie, Espie, Kyle, & Biello, 
2015) and its polygenic basis (Gehrman, Byrne, Gillespie, & Martin, 2011; Hammerschlag 
et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2017; Lind & Gehrman, 2016), individual differences in 
vulnerability to sleep disturbance and insomnia are likely to constitute a continuum from 
outright resilience to vulnerability to acute/transient sleep disturbance through overt chronic 
insomnia disorder. Although sleep profiles on PSG adaptation nights successfully identify 
individuals with high sleep reactivity, this method of assessment is hindered by exorbitant 
resource demands. This method is further limited to PSG-naïve individuals, and first night 
effects may not generalize to the myriad of potential naturalistic stressors. To address these 
assessment concerns, a self-report instrument was developed and validated to allow the 
assessment of sleep reactivity in the broad population to facilitate prospective studies of 
aetiology and clinical relevance.

The Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST) (Drake et al., 2004) is a self-report 
instrument designed to assess sleep reactivity. For its creation, four insomnia experts 
submitted a total of 27 items assessing stress-related sleep disturbance. A total of 104 
subjects were asked to rate the likelihood of experiencing difficulty sleeping (1 = not likely, 
2 = somewhat likely, 3 = moderately likely, 4 = very likely) in response to a number of both 
broad and highly specific hypothetical stressors, such as ‘Before an important meeting the 
next day’ or ‘After a stressful experience in the evening’ (see Drake et al., 2004 for the full 
instrument). Exploratory factor analysis identified a single-factor structure for the FIRST, 
comprised of nine items accounting for 25.7% of the variance among all 27 items. This 
single-factor nine-item structure has also been validated for use in early pregnancy (Gelaye 
et al., 2016) and translated into Spanish (Gelaye et al., 2016), Japanese (Nakajima et al., 
2014), European Portuguese (Marques, Allen Gomes, Drake, Roth, & De Azevedo, 2018), 
French (Chen et al., 2015), German (Dieck, Helbig, Drake, & Backhaus, 2017) and Italian 
(Palagini et al., 2016).

PHYSIOLOGY

7.1 |  Experimental studies

To validate the FIRST, our team tested whether self-reported sleep reactivity corresponded 
to objectively measured sleep reactivity (i.e. physiological changes in sleep following stress; 
Drake et al., 2004). In PSG-naïve normal sleepers, we compared PSG-based sleep 
parameters on an adaptation night between individuals with high FIRST scores and those 
with low FIRST scores (median split; Drake et al., 2004). Consistent with PSG first-night 
effects reflecting high sleep reactivity (Bonnet & Arand, 2003), we found that highly 
reactive sleepers, per self-report, exhibited lower PSG-based sleep efficiency (81% versus 
89%), longer latency to stage 1 sleep (23 min versus 9 min) and longer latency to persistent 
sleep (36 min versus 16 min) than low-reactivity sleepers. Moreover, individuals with high 
FIRST scores showed increased daytime arousal per prolonged sleep latency on the Multiple 
Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) compared to individuals with low FIRST scores (13 min versus

11 min). These elevated latencies on MSLT suggest that physiological hyperarousal may 
override homeostatic sleep pressure in reactive individuals even during the day, and even 
despite disturbed sleep during the preceding night.

Importantly, these data were obtained in a sample of normal sleepers without evidence of 
poor sleep prior to the laboratory challenge. Thus, the insomnia-like characteristics seen in 
those with high FIRST scores were a departure from the habitual good sleep these 
individuals typically experienced. Furthermore, as the PSG adaptation night is an 
affectively-neutral stimulus, the exaggerated first-night effects among highly reactive 
sleepers are unlikely to be accompanied by significant anxiety or elevated cognitive 
responses, and therefore are likely to be sleep specific.

A recent study by the Morin group in Canada supported these findings by showing that 
higher FIRST scores were associated with longer self-reported sleep latency, higher somatic 
arousal and elevated heart rate in a sample of 45 good sleepers (Chen et al., 2015). In a 
subsample of 14 subjects, the authors examined whether self-reported sleep reactivity on the 
FIRST was associated with PSG-defined sleep disturbances. Results showed that highly 
reactive sleepers had lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep latency and more total wake time 
on a PSG adaptation night than non-reactive sleepers, thus further validating this 
conceptualization of sleep reactivity across laboratories and countries.

Self-reported sleep reactivity has also been shown to generalize broadly to various controlled 
stressors, including objective measures of sleep response to pharmacological challenge 
(Drake, Jefferson, Roehrs, & Roth, 2006). Eleven highly reactive good sleepers and 10 good 
sleepers with low reactivity (median split) underwent 3 nights of PSG: (a) adaptation night, 
(b) control night and (c) caffeine night (3 mg/kg caffeine at 1 hr prior to lights out). Highly 
reactive good sleepers took 47 min longer to fall asleep on the caffeine night than on the 
control night (65 min versus 18 min). Further, their sleep latency on the caffeine night was 
40 min longer than that of the low-reactive sleepers on the caffeine night (65 min versus 25 
min). Although all subjects were insomnia free, the severely prolonged sleep latency 
exhibited by highly reactive sleepers in response to this pharmacological sleep challenge is 
similar to the latency reported by chronic insomniacs (Walsh et al., 2000). It is important to 
highlight here that sleep latency did not differ between these two groups on the control night 
(17.5 ± 14.3 min versus 18.2 ± 18.8 min), indicating that high and low-reactive sleepers do 
not differ in sleep quality in the absence of stress. Not only do these data complement 
Bonnet & Arand, 2003 caffeine findings (Bonnet & Arand, 2003), but they also show that 
highly reactive sleepers can be identified a priori utilizing a validated self-report measure 
(i.e. FIRST).

7.2 |  Observational studies

Much of the knowledge on sleep reactivity to this point had been gained from laboratory 
studies utilizing neutrally valenced non-psychosocial stressors (i.e. first night effects, phase 
advance and stimulant administration).1 Although this emphasizes the independence of this 
construct from cognitive components of stress reactivity, Petersen et al. extended this work 
to include psychosocial and mental stress by examining differences in PSG responses to 
naturally occurring work stress between good sleepers with high and those with low sleep

reactivity (above versus below a FIRST mean item score of 2.5, corresponding to FIRST 
≥23 for high reactivity; Petersen, Kecklund, D’onofrio, Nilsson, & Akerstedt, 2013). PSG 
showed that highly reactive sleepers exhibited more sleep stage transitions and nocturnal 
arousals than low-reactive sleepers during high stress. These profiles suggest that highly 
reactive sleepers exhibit much more microlevel sleep fragmentation than low-reactivity 
sleepers when stressed, even in the absence of macrolevel differences in sleep efficiency.

Curiously, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration interacted with stress exposure 
(Petersen et al., 2013). Among highly reactive sleepers, REM sleep duration decreased in 
response to stress (low to high stress, 119 to 92 min), whereas no such decrease was 
observed for low-reactive sleepers when stressed (low to high stress, 91 to 97 min, non-
significant). Importantly, the highly reactive sleepers exhibited decreased REM sleep and 
increased nocturnal arousals (particularly during REM) in response to stress, which have 
been proposed as sleep physiological markers of chronic insomnia (Riemann et al., 2012). 
Laboratory studies using animal models show that manipulated stress exposure leads to 
REM sleep instability in rats (i.e. short and fragmented REM sleep), especially among those 
with high stress reactivity (Cano, Mochizuki, & Saper, 2008; Fenzl et al., 2011; Pawlyk, 
Morrison, Ross, & Brennan, 2008; Revel, Gottowik, Gatti, Wettstein, & Moreau, 2009). 
Findings on REM sleep instability and stress dysregulation in humans, however, have been 
more mixed (Akerstedt, Kecklund, & Axelsson, 2007; Buckley & Schatzberg, 2005; Pillai & 
Drake, 2014; Vandekerckhove & Cluydts, 2010). Even so, in the case of REM decreasing 
during stress among highly reactive sleepers, it is possible that Petersen et al. (2013) 
captured stress-induced REM instability in this insomnia-vulnerable group. Although REM 
sleep duration did not differ between the sleep-reactivity groups under high stress, a striking 
observation was the long REM sleep duration among highly reactive sleepers during low 
stress. By extension, it is possible that a vulnerability to REM change (or REM instability) 
during stress is a marker for insomnia. Although the association of REM instability with 
sleep reactivity is consistent with the animal models of stress reactivity noted above, this 
isolated finding is difficult to interpret as other studies have not revealed stress-related REM 
abnormalities associated with high sleep reactivity (Drake et al., 2004, 2006).

Taken together, early experimental and observation studies indicated that normal sleepers, 
even without a history of sleep issues, can differ greatly in their sleep responses to stress. 
Those with high sleep reactivity had difficulty falling and staying asleep and had more 
microlevel sleep fragmentation during stress than those with low sleep reactivity. The 
question remained, however: do these highly sleep-reactive ‘normal sleepers’ have a greater 
risk of developing insomnia disorder in the future?

1Perhaps ironically, items on the FIRST largely pertain to psychosocial stressors, many of which are negatively valenced (e.g. 
‘stressful experience’, ‘bad news’, ‘bad day at work’, ‘after an argument’, etc.). That self-reported sleep disturbance response to 
psychosocial stressors corresponds to objectively measured sleep responses to non-psychosocial and pharmacological challenges 
suggests generalizability across a broad range of potential stressors.

8 |  THE PATHOGENICITY OF SLEEP REACTIVITY: INSOMNIA

8.1 | 

Insomnia incidence and chronicity

Early research on sleep reactivity confirmed that certain individuals are predisposed to 
exaggerated sleep responses to a wide range of environmental, pharmacological and 
psychosocial stressors. The implications of this research centred on the potential role of high 
trait sleep reactivity as a diathesis for sleep disorders, such that insomnia may be 
conceptualized as the somnological fallout and detritus of a constitutionally weak sleep 
system in stress-potentiated manifest.

In 2014, two prospective studies supported the role of high premorbid sleep reactivity in 
vulnerability to insomnia (Drake et al., 2013; Jarrin et al., 2014). In a sample of 1449 good 
sleepers, Jarrin et al. found that individuals with high sleep reactivity were nearly 60% more 
likely to develop insomnia symptoms and were twice as likely to develop chronic insomnia 
over the next 2 years compared with low-reactive sleepers (Jarrin et al., 2014). Importantly, 
the relationship between premorbid sleep reactivity and insomnia risk was independent of 
sleep history, depressive symptoms, and stress exposure and impact. Further, sleep reactivity 
predicted future insomnia while controlling for arousal predisposition, supporting sleep 
reactivity as a sleep-specific vulnerability that is distinct from general trait hyperarousability.

In the Evolution of Pathways to Insomnia Cohort (EPIC) study, our team investigated 
whether sleep reactivity predicted the incidence of insomnia disorder in a sample of 2,316 
individuals without a history of DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) 
insomnia or major depression (Drake et al., 2013). The results showed that higher premorbid 
sleep reactivity increased the risk of developing DSM-IV insomnia disorder over the next 
year. Critically, this study offered the first empirical evidence showing that stress exposure 
exploits the fragility of highly reactive sleep systems. Firstly, an interaction between sleep 
reactivity and stress exposure approached significance (p = 0.06), suggesting that major life 
events may exploit sensitive sleep systems in highly reactive sleepers, thereby triggering the 
onset of insomnia. However, as noted in our overview of stress and sleep above, our 
appraisals of and reactions to stress often influence the sleep response (Morin et al., 2003; 
Pillai & Drake, 2014; Pillai et al., 2013; Sadeh et al., 2004). Here, our team showed that 
cognitive and emotional reactions to stress (i.e. rumination) interact with sleep reactivity to 
amplify the risk of developing insomnia disorder (see Figure 3; Drake et al., 2013). This 
interaction shows the unique and synergistic contribution to insomnia disorder of the 
‘cognitive-emotional’ (appraisal, rumination, coping, etc.) and ‘sleep reactivity’-related 
responses to stress. That is, individuals with both corrosive psychological reactions to stress 
and a sensitive sleep system are at especially high risk of developing insomnia disorder. The 
finding that rumination intensifies the pathogenicity of stress in those with fragile sleep 
systems constituted the first evidence emphasizing the importance of psychological 
processes in the risk relationship between sleep reactivity and insomnia development.

A follow-up report from the EPIC study examined the ability of the FIRST to identify good 
sleepers predisposed to incident insomnia and to identify clinically relevant cut-points for 
the measure (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016b). In a sample of 2,892 individuals 
without a history of DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) insomnia disorder

or major depression, cut-offs for the FIRST were established using ROC curve analysis to 
identify good sleepers at elevated risk of incident insomnia disorder. Where prior studies had 
used sample medians to split subjects into high versus low sleep-reactivity groups, this study 
statistically derived normative cut-offs for elevated risk for 1-year incidence of insomnia in a 
healthy sample.

Analyses revealed an optimal cut-off of FIRST ≥ 18, which will be referred to henceforth as 
the high-risk cut-point. The high-risk cut-point of FIRST ≥ 18 had 62% sensitivity and 67% 
specificity for predicting 1-year incidence of insomnia, and 15.7% of these individuals 
developed insomnia disorder within a year, nearly double the annual incidence rate of 9.1% 
for the full sample. However, because preventive efforts may benefit from a more sensitive 
test, we examined additional potential cut-points indicating the risk of insomnia with greater 
sensitivity. Results showed that a FIRST score of 16 or higher conferred the second optimal 
cut-point in our good-sleeping, non-depressed sample, as appropriate for preventative 
interventions. This moderate-risk cut-point of FIRST ≥ 16 had 77% sensitivity and 50% 
specificity for predicting insomnia onset 1 year later. Among those who scored FIRST ≥ 16 
a full 13.2% developed insomnia disorder within a year, compared with the incidence rate of 
9.1% for the entire sample.

Comparison of the cut-off values showed that the highly reactive sleepers (FIRST ≥ 18) 
were more than twice as likely to develop insomnia than those who scored in the moderate 
16–17 range (16.1% versus 7.7% incidence; relative risk = 2.09). Even so, we would like to 
emphasize that neither cut-off should be considered universally preferable. Selection of cut-
offs should be driven by research and clinical needs regarding sensitivity and specificity. 
Future research may elucidate the prognostic benefits associated with each respective cut-
off.

8.2 |  Sleep onset insomnia

Heterogeneity in insomnia symptoms and phenotypes is likely to reflect correspondingly 
heterogeneous aetiological factors underlying the disorder (Benjamins et al., 2016; Pillai, 
Roth, & Drake, 2014; Roth, Roehrs, & Pies, 2007; Vgontzas et al., 2013). Efforts have thus 
explored whether insomnia phenotypes (e.g. sleep onset versus sleep maintenance) differ 
between individuals with high versus low sleep reactivity. Data from the EPIC study suggest 
that insomniacs with high premorbid sleep reactivity are two to three times more likely to 
have sleep onset insomnia complaints than non-reactive sleepers (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, 
& Drake, 2016b). Highly reactive insomniacs estimated their habitual sleep latency to be 
nearly twice as long as that estimated by non-reactive sleepers at disease onset (65–68 min 
versus 37–44 min). These findings lend important ecological validity to laboratory studies 
that show highly reactive sleepers struggle to fall asleep during stress (Drake et al., 2004, 
2006). Further, prolonged sleep latency among highly reactive sleepers is consistent with 
prior evidence showing that rumination (a) is a cardinal feature of pre-sleep arousal 
(Baglioni et al., 2010; Harvey, 2000, 2002a; Pillai & Drake, 2014; Riemann et al., 2010, 
2012), (b) is associated with sleep reactivity (Drake et al., 2013; Fernández-Mendoza et al., 
2010), and (c) potentiates the effects of stress on the sleep system (Drake et al., 2013). 
Together, these findings suggest that one mechanism by which sleep reactivity initiates and

perpetuates insomnia disorder may involve the cognitive-emotional processes during the pre-
sleep period.

8.3 |  Short sleep insomnia phenotype

Short sleep insomnia is an especially severe and treatment-resistant phenotype of insomnia 
disorder (Bathgate, Edinger, & Krystal, 2017; Vgontzas et al., 2013). Although reference-
standard classification of the short sleep phenotype is recommended via PSG (e.g. <6 hr), 
results from a recent study in the EPIC cohort showed that findings in insomniacs with self-
reported habitual short sleep are consistent with the extant literature on insomnia with 
objectively measured short sleep (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016a). Underlying 
the aetiology of short sleep insomnia is severely dysfunctional neurobiological regulation of 
stress (Vgontzas et al., 2013). Despite foundations of stress dysregulation in short sleep 
insomnia and sleep reactivity, no study to date has examined whether sleep reactivity differs 
between insomniacs with short and normal sleep duration.

Thus for the purposes of this review, we revisited the data from our 2016 report on DSM-5 
insomnia disorder and short sleep (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016a). We 
conducted post hoc analyses to test whether sleep reactivity was associated with the short 
sleep phenotype of insomnia in a large community sample of nonobese US adults aged 18–
69 years. Specifically, we cross-sectionally compared sleep reactivity across 1,684 good 
sleepers with normal sleep duration, 294 insomniacs with normal sleep duration and 284 
short-sleeping insomniacs (see Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016a for full study 
details).

Short-sleeping insomniacs reported slightly higher levels of sleep reactivity than insomniacs 
with normal sleep duration (FIRST scores, 23.49 ± 6.16 versus 22.44 ± 5.95, t = 2.08, p < 
0.04, Cohen’s d = 0.17). We then used dummy coded logistic regression to compare odds of 
having high sleep reactivity (FIRST ≥ 18) for insomniacs with short and normal sleep 
duration compared with good sleepers as the reference group, while controlling for gender 
effects. Unsurprisingly, both insomnia groups were more likely to have high sleep reactivity 
than good sleepers. Short-sleeping insomniacs had a striking 10-fold greater odds of having 
high sleep reactivity (OR = 9.89, 95% CI = 7.15–13.68, p < 0.001) than good sleepers, 
whereas insomniacs with normal sleep duration had 6–7-fold greater odds of high sleep 
reactivity than good sleepers (OR = 6.73, 95% CI = 5.02–9.03, p < 0.001). A follow-up 
logistic regression directly comparing insomnia phenotypes showed that short-sleeping 
insomniacs may be 49% more likely to have high sleep reactivity than insomniacs with 
normal sleep duration, but this finding was a statistical trend (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.99–
2.26, p < 0.06).

These cross-sectional findings indicate that the sleep system may be more fragile in short-
sleeping insomniacs than in their longer-sleeping insomniac counterparts. However, 
prospective investigations are needed to characterize sleep reactivity prior to developing 
insomnia with short versus normal PSG sleep duration; this is especially crucial as insomnia 
development and stress exposure can sensitize the sleep system (i.e. increase the reactivity of 
the sleep system), as discussed below. Only then can we determine whether exceptionally 
high sleep reactivity predicts the onset of short sleep insomnia and/or develops concurrently

with the disorder. Given the burgeoning literature suggesting that objectively measured short 
sleep in insomnia is a better indicator of biological severity and comorbidity than 
subjectively estimated sleep (Bathgate, Edinger, Wyatt, & Krystal, 2015; Fernandez-
Mendoza et al., 2011; Vgontzas et al., 2013), future research on sleep reactivity and short 
sleep insomnia would greatly benefit from objective measurement of sleep duration.

8.4 |  Pathogenicity of sleep reactivity versus subthreshold insomnia

Transient difficulties in falling and staying asleep can mark a prodromal state leading to 
chronic insomnia (Singareddy et al., 2012). Given that sleep reactivity is associated with 
transient sleep problems and subthreshold insomnia (Bonnet & Arand, 2003; Drake et al., 
2004), it is important for aetiological research to disentangle the influences of sleep 
reactivity versus acute sleep disturbance.

Jarrin et al. (2014) provided the first evidence of independence between sleep reactivity and 
subthreshold insomnia. In a prospective investigation, sleep reactivity predicted future 
insomnia, independent of prior difficulties in sleeping. More importantly, sleep reactivity 
predicted future subthreshold insomnia symptoms, suggesting that self-reported sleep 
reactivity is independent from and is even predictive of future subthreshold or transient 
insomnia complaints. Moreover, insomnia symptoms fluctuate and are thereby limited as a 
prognostic marker of insomnia disorder by their very symptomatic ebbs and flows, whereas 
sleep reactivity is a non-state-dependent trait-like marker of insomnia vulnerability (Drake, 
Friedman, Wright, & Roth, 2011; Drake, Scofield, & Roth, 2008).

In addition to predicting the degree of the transient sleep response to stress, among those 
with subthreshold insomnia, trait sleep reactivity influences whether sleep difficulties remain 
transient or become syndromal and rather independent from acute stress exposure (see 
Figure 4). Within individuals who reported nocturnal symptoms of insomnia but did not 
meet diagnostic criteria as a result of not experiencing daytime impairment, future insomnia 
disorder was two to three times more likely to develop in highly reactive poor sleepers than 
in non-reactive poor sleepers (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016b). Although it is 
quite normal to experience transient sleep difficulties (Ohayon, 2002), individuals with 
sensitive sleep systems may be especially vulnerable to minor disruptions in sleep function 
that spin out of control and evolve into something vicious and pathological.

8.5 |  Pathogenicity of sleep reactivity versus family history

Family history of insomnia has been long viewed as a reliable indicator of insomnia risk, 
with maternal history as arguably the most robust predictor (Bastien & Morin, 2000; 
Dauvilliers et al., 2005; Singareddy et al., 2012). With maternal history as a reference 
standard prognostic marker, we compared the risk of insomnia between sleep reactivity and 
self-reported parental insomnia history in the EPIC cohort (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & 
Drake, 2016b). Notably, history of paternal insomnia was not associated with risk of 
insomnia. However, in support of prior work, good sleepers with maternal histories of 
insomnia were at elevated risk of insomnia. Even so, sleep reactivity, as measured by the 
FIRST, was a stronger predictor of incident insomnia than maternal history. Specifically, the

effect sizes for the FIRST clinical cut-points (moderate risk, ≥16; high risk, ≥18) were twice 
as large as the effect sizes associated with subject-reported history of maternal insomnia.

It is important to note here that more than one-third of our sample indicated not knowing 
whether or not their biological mother or father had a history of insomnia. This is a serious 
limitation that critically restricts the utility of solely relying on patient- or subject-reported 
biological family history as an indicator of risk of insomnia. Further, substantial method 
error is likely to be involved when individuals report on family history of clinical sleep 
disorders, as most individuals are not trained to identify these disorders and may not be 
privy to family members’ health histories.

8.6 |  Sensitization of the sleep system

Evidence widely supports trait-like characteristics for sleep reactivity. Specifically, 
individuals’ sleep responses to stress exposure are fairly consistent across stressful 
conditions (Bonnet & Arand, 2003; Drake et al., 2004), and self-reported sleep reactivity is 
stable over weeks (Drake et al., 2004) and even months (Jarrin et al., 2016). Even so and 
perhaps contrary to some conventional thought, trait factors are not necessarily immutable 
and may even alter under certain conditions. Several researchers have emphasized that 
exposure to stress and even to insomnia itself causes changes in the regulation of stress and 
sleep (Meerlo et al., 2008; Palagini et al., 2014; Riemann et al., 2010). As a result, the 
conditions under which the initial episode of insomnia develops may differ from the 
conditions that perpetuate its course or give rise to recurrent episodes. By extension, this 
framework offers insight into the robustness of personal history of insomnia as a predictor of 
future sleep and mood pathology (Baglioni et al., 2011; Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2012; 
Riemann & Voderholzer, 2003; Singareddy et al., 2012), even following insomnia remission 
(Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2012); that is, stress exposure and disease development 
fundamentally and functionally change the very ways our minds and bodies regulate sleep 
and stress.

In the EPIC cohort, we investigated whether sleep reactivity changed in response to 
insomnia development and exposure to major life stress (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, 
Anderson, & Drake, 2016). Specifically, we followed 262 subjects from the community who 
were insomnia and depression free at baseline but went on to develop DSM-IV insomnia 
disorder 1 year later. We found that sleep reactivity increased substantially in insomniacs 
with low baseline sleep reactivity, such that 41 of 60 were reclassified at insomnia onset as 
having elevated sleep reactivity (FIRST ≥ 16). In addition, exposure to major life stress 
predicted greater increases in sleep reactivity between baseline and insomnia onset; this 
finding is consistent with prior research showing that stress exposure erodes the ability to 
regulate stress and creates a neurotoxic environment, a process demonstrated in both human 
studies and animal models (Lupien, Mcewen, Gunnar, & Heim, 2009; Palagini et al., 2014). 
Importantly, sleep reactivity did not return to pre-insomnia baseline levels even after disease 
remission, indicating that stress exposure and insomnia development have a scarring effect 
on the sleep system resulting in sensitization, which cannot be attributed to mere state-
dependent fluctuations in sleep reactivity. By comparison, insomniacs with high premorbid

sleep reactivity did not show any significant changes in sleep reactivity, irrespective of an 
acute (1 year, then remission) or chronic (2 years) course for insomnia.

These findings strongly support sensitization of the sleep system in response to stress 
exposure. It is important to emphasize that insomnia itself has been conceptualized as a 
stressor that ravages systems regulating stress and sleep (Palagini et al., 2014). Importantly, 
sleep system sensitization is consistent with models of stress sensitization and neurotoxicity 
in depression. These models propose that aetiological factors evolve in response to 
development of stress and depression, such that chronic stress and additional episodes of 
depression increase the risk of recurrence and chronicity by sensitizing the stress-response 
system (Kendler, Thornton, & Gardner, 2000; Lupien et al., 2009; Monroe & Harkness, 
2005). Stress sensitization effects are most pronounced in individuals at low genetic risk of 
pathology, whereas individuals with high genetic risk have been described as pre-kindled; 
that is, those with high genetic risk are born sensitized to the disorder (in line with the 
vulnerability hypothesis; Lupien et al., 2009), whereas those with low genetic risk become 
sensitized over time if strong environmental stressors wear down psycho-neurobiological 
stress systems. Sleep system sensitization very closely mirrors stress sensitization in 
depression, such that the preponderance of individuals who develop the disease (either 
insomnia or depression) carry a high genetic load and may be described as pre-kindled (i.e. 
inherited fragile sleep and stress systems), whereas a smaller proportion of individuals with 
low genetic risk go on to develop insomnia nevertheless and in the process undergo critical 
changes as a result of pathogenic stress corroding sleep-regulating and stress-regulating 
systems.

9. |  THE PATHOGENICITY OF SLEEP REACTIVITY: SHIFT WORK 

DISORDER

Disruptions in sleep–wake patterns can reflect normative adjustment to shift work and 
resultant circadian misalignment (Drake & Wright, 2011; Schwartz & Roth, 2006). 
However, some workers are unable to sufficiently adjust to shift-work schedules and are at 
risk of developing shift work disorder (SWD). SWD is marked by chronic and severe sleep–
wake disturbances in response to the misalignment between work-enforced sleep schedules 
and endogenous timing of the circadian rhythm. The cardinal features of SWD are sleep 
disturbance/insomnia complaints during the sleep period and/or excessive sleepiness during 
the wake period in accordance with the mismatch between internal rhythmicity and external 
demands (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014).

9.1 | 

Incidence after transitioning to rotating shifts

Understandably, much of the work on SWD aetiology and symptomatology has focused 
largely on circadian misalignment. By extension, well-characterized risk factors for SWD 
centre on circadianrelated and chronotype-related influences, such as morning preference 
(early chronotype) and genetic variants known to segregate with SWD and other circadian 
pathologies (Archer et al., 2003; Dijk & Archer, 2010; Hilliker, Muehlbach, Schweitzer, & 
Walsh, 1992; Kalmbach et al., 2016). However, as noted above, insomnia complaints are a 
key feature of SWD (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014), but nevertheless

insomnia risk factors have received little attention in SWD development. Given the evidence 
showing that individuals with high sleep reactivity are prone to stress-related sleep 
disturbance in response to circadian challenges (Bonnet & Arand, 2003), we evaluated 
whether high versus low reactive sleepers differed in their response to shift-work-related 
changes in sleep–waking timing.

Using the transition to rotating shift work as a naturalistic exposure to enforced circadian 
misalignment, we conducted the only study we know of to date that focuses on sleep 
reactivity as a vulnerability to circadian rhythm sleep disorders. In a sample of 96 healthy 
individuals from the EPIC study, we prospectively investigated premorbid sleep reactivity as 
a vulnerability to incident SWD in response to starting a rotating work schedule (Kalmbach, 
Pillai, Chen, Arnedt, & Drake, 2015). We observed an overall incidence rate of 18.8% (n = 
18/96) for SWD after transitioning to rotating shifts. Notably, 88.9% (n = 16/18) of those 
with SWD had elevated sleep reactivity prior to starting shift work. In fact, rates of SWD 
were nearly seven times higher among highly reactive sleepers than non-reactive sleepers 
(incidence rates, 30.8% versus 4.5%). Consistent with prior findings on prolonged sleep 
latency among highly reactive sleepers (Drake et al., 2004; Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & 
Drake, 2016b), here we found that shift workers with SWD (89% highly reactive) reported 
sleep latency nearly twice as long as normal-sleeping shift workers (54 min versus 27 min). 
Not only do these findings extend the diathetic role of sleep reactivity from insomnia to 
SWD, thereby identifying a trait characteristic to screen for individuals at risk of SWD, but 
also these findings lend ecological support for previous studies of heightened sensitivity to 
circadian challenges in highly reactive sleepers (Bonnet & Arand, 2003). Furthermore, 
caffeine is commonly used by shift workers to combat nocturnal sleepiness and improve 
vocational function (Åkerstedt & Wright, 2009). Given the high rates of sleep reactivity 
among individuals who develop SWD (Kalmbach et al., 2015), coupled with the exaggerated 
sleep responses of highly reactive sleepers to caffeine (Drake et al., 2006), these data suggest 
that highly reactive sleepers could potentially increase their risk of sleep disturbance and 
SWD when relying on caffeine and other stimulants to combat fatigue and sleepiness during 
shift work.

9.2 | 

Insomnia versus sleepy versus mixed phenotypes

Three phenotypes of SWD exist consistently with diagnostic criteria: (a) the insomnia 
phenotype (insomnia during the sleep period, but normal wakefulness during the wake 
period), (b) the sleepy phenotype (excessive sleepiness during wake periods, no insomnia 
during the sleep period) and (c) mixed (Gumenyuk, Belcher, Drake, & Roth, 2015). Because 
of under-representation of non-reactive SWD workers in our sample (n = 2/18), we were 
unable to empirically compare SWD symptoms between subgroups of reactive and non-
reactive SWD sufferers. Consequently, we can only mix extrapolation with conservative 
speculation to posit that high sleep reactivity is likely to be a particularly germane 
vulnerability for the insomnia and perhaps mixed phenotypes of SWD, rather than the sleepy 
phenotype, especially as prior evidence suggests that highly reactive sleepers exhibit wake-
promoting hyperarousal during wake periods even after disrupted sleep (Drake et al., 2004). 
By extension, the aetiology and ergo preventive interventions for the SWD insomnia and

vulnerability) may differ greatly from those associated with the SWD sleepy phenotype.

10 |  THE PATHOGENICITY OF SLEEP REACTIVITY: PSYCHIATRIC 

ILLNESS

10.1 |  Depression

Four studies support two non-mutually-exclusive conceptualizations of the risk relationship 
between sleep reactivity and depression: (a) excessive sleep reactivity directly increases the 
risk of depression and (b) the pathogenic effects of sleep reactivity on depression are largely 
mediated by sleep disturbances.

A report from the EPIC study in 2013 first examined sleep reactivity as a diathesis of 
clinical depression and provided support for both direct and indirect influences of sleep 
reactivity on incident depression (Drake et al., 2013). Among 2,316 US adults without 
history of DSM-IV insomnia disorder or major depression, higher levels of premorbid sleep 
reactivity were associated with risk of incident depression 2 years later (OR = 1.67, p < 
0.01). However, a significant proportion of sleep reactivity’s influence on development of 
depression at 2 years post-baseline was mediated by incident insomnia disorder at 1 year 
post-baseline.

Findings from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study and Community Twin Study provided 
further support for both direct and indirect aetiological influences of sleep reactivity on 
depression (Vargas, Friedman, & Drake, 2015). In 2,250 young US adults, sleep reactivity 
was significantly and positively associated with concurrent symptoms of depression. Further, 
the relationship between sleep reactivity and depression was partly mediated by concurrent 
insomnia. Although these findings are methodologically limited by their cross-sectional 
nature, these findings add support for direct and indirect relationships between sleep 
reactivity and depression and are consistent with prospective evidence (Drake et al., 2013).

In a follow-up report from the EPIC study on longitudinal changes in sleep reactivity 
coinciding with insomnia development (i.e. sleep system sensitization, as described above; 
Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016), we found that premorbid sleep reactivity at 
baseline predicted depression severity at 2 years post-baseline. Perhaps more interestingly, 
however, there was a subgroup of insomniacs who did not have high sleep reactivity prior to 
developing insomnia. For these individuals with low premorbid sleep reactivity, we found 
that stress exposure and insomnia development caused increases in sleep reactivity, 
suggesting that exposure to stress sensitizes the sleep system, particularly among those 
without this premorbid vulnerability. Moreover, our evidence suggested that sleep system 
sensitization is directly associated with severity of depression at the onset of insomnia 
disorder and even a year later; that is, greater increases in sleep reactivity that occur in 
response to stress and insomnia development result in greater severity of depression during 
insomnia (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016).

Although prior studies have examined the role of insomnia in the risk relationship between 
sleep reactivity and depression, one report from the EPIC study has examined SWD as a

mediator between sleep reactivity and depression (Kalmbach et al., 2015). In this previously 
described prospective study of 96 rotating shift workers, highly reactive sleepers reported 
greater depressive symptoms after transitioning to shift work, but this relationship was 
largely mediated by incident SWD (Kalmbach et al., 2015).

10.2 |  Anxiety

Three studies have investigated the relationship between sleep reactivity and anxiety (two 
prospective). In a sample of 338 Japanese adults, sleep reactivity (measured by the FIRST) 
was associated with trait anxiety in both good sleepers and insomniacs (Nakajima et al., 
2014). Among 262 adults from the EPIC study who developed insomnia disorder 1 year 
after baseline, premorbid sleep reactivity was significantly associated with anxiety 
symptoms at 1 year follow-up (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016). Further, 
and again mirroring depression results, sleep system sensitization (i.e. increases in sleep 
reactivity associated with stress exposure) was associated with anxiety severity both at 
insomnia onset and a year later. In another report from the EPIC study on SWD, premorbid 
sleep reactivity was not directly associated with anxiety symptoms when individuals 
transitioned to rotating shift work (Kalmbach et al., 2015). However, and again similar to 
depression, there was an indirect effect wherein greater premorbid sleep reactivity predicted 
higher shift work-related anxiety, but this effect was mediated by the onset of SWD.

11 |  THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF SLEEP REACTIVITY

Although evidence for sleep reactivity as a phenomenon and diathesis for stress-related 
illnesses is unequivocally clear, its mechanistic foundations remain mysterious. Growing 
evidence points to the neurobiological and potentially psychological underpinnings that 
contribute to individual differences in sleep system sensitivity. Here, we discuss some 
identified bases and correlates as well as peripheral psychological factors of sleep reactivity 
that may contribute to its pathogenicity.

11.1 |  Neurobiological bases

Given the heritability of sleep–wake characteristics and insomnia (Gehrman, Byrne et al., 
2011; Gehrman, Meltzer et al., 2011; Hammerschlag et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2017; Lind & 
Gehrman, 2016; Pack, Keenan, Byrne, & Gehrman, 2016; Palagini et al., 2014), and 
prognostic value of familial insomnia (Bastien & Morin, 2000; Dauvilliers et al., 2005; 
Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016; Singareddy et al., 2012), it is not surprising 
that early evidence points to a substantial genetic influence on sleep reactivity. The first data 
to support heritability examined familial aggregation for self-reported sleep reactivity on the 
FIRST among 23 insomnia-free sibling pairs (Drake et al., 2008). Analyses estimated that 
37.2% of sleep reactivity is accounted for by familial aggregation after controlling for age, 
gender, work schedules and psychiatric history. In 2011, heritability estimates for sleep 
reactivity were 29% for women and 43% for men using a sample of 988 monozygotic and 
1,086 dizygotic twins from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study and Community Twin 
Study. Notably, few sex differences in the genetic architecture of sleep reactivity were 
observed, and genetic contribution was similar for men and women. Rather, the sex 
difference in heritability estimates differed largely because of a greater environmental

influence on sleep reactivity for women. It is critical to highlight here that this study showed 
that women report substantially higher levels of sleep reactivity than men, despite similar 
genetic architecture. In 2014, the sleep team at Penn State provided corroborating evidence 
in the most thorough examination of sleep reactivity heritability in a family study 
(Fernandez-Mendoza, Shaffer et al., 2014). From 135 nuclear families (including one 
mother, one father and one progeny), sleep reactivity heritability was estimated at 29%, and 
progeny of highly reactive parents had 3–7-fold odds for also having high sleep reactivity. 
Taken together, these three studies offer strong empirical support for the genetic inheritance 
of sleep reactivity.

Importantly, genetic architecture probably only tells a portion of the story, as epigenetics 
(i.e. the expression of genes) is likely to contribute a large part to sleep reactivity. For a 
thorough review on epigenetics in sleep and insomnia, please refer to Palagini et al.’s (2014) 
exploration of the topic. These authors emphasized that stress can alter gene expression and 
brain plasticity. They posited, by extension, that stress and insomnia onset (as a stressor 
itself) may perpetuate the course of insomnia via these neurobiological changes in systems 
regulating the stress-response and sleep function. This theory is consistent with evidence 
supporting a substantial environmental influence on sleep reactivity (Brummett et al., 2007; 
Drake et al., 2011). Data showing that stress exposure increases sleep system sensitivity 
among insomniacs with low premorbid reactivity (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et al., 
2016) may reflect changes in epigenetically controlled regulation of stress and sleep. As 
sensitization of the sleep system is not reversed after insomnia remission (Kalmbach, Pillai, 
Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016), the sensitization process is consistent with a scarring effect 
on the sleep system.

Overall, little research has been conducted on the neurobiological underpinnings of sleep 
reactivity. Even so, potential mechanisms can be gleaned from what we know about the 
neurobiology of sleep disturbance and insomnia (please refer to reviews by Baglioni et al., 
2010; Basta et al., 2007; Bonnet & Arand, 2010; Buysse et al., 2012; Harvey et al., 2014; 
Palagini et al., 2014; Riemann et al., 2010, 2015; and Vgontzas et al., 2013 for in-depth 
analysis in this area). Briefly, increased activity in the cortex (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 
2016), cerebrum (Nofzinger et al., 2004), HPA axis (Buckley & Schatzberg, 2005; 
Fernandez-Mendoza, Vgontzas et al., 2014; Riemann et al., 2010; Vgontzas et al., 2001, 
2013), sympathetic nervous system (Vgontzas et al., 2013) and amygdala (Baglioni et al., 
2014) have been observed in poor sleepers. However, given the effects of sleep loss and 
comorbid disorders on neurobiological networks, it is important to characterize the integrity 
of these brain structures prior to morbidity. That is, if we can better understand the 
neurobiology underlying exaggerated sensitivity in the sleep system prior to disease 
development, then we will better understand the transdiagnostic neurobiology complicit in 
the development of sleep disorders following stress and their impact on mental illness and 
other areas of health and function. We will discuss the next steps in this area of research 
below in the Future Directions section.

11.2 |  Related psychological factors

Fernandez-Mendoza and colleagues conducted the most comprehensive investigation to date 
on the cognitive and emotional processes related to sleep reactivity (Fernández-Mendoza et 
al., 2010). In a sample of adults with good sleeping, the authors showed that sleep reactivity 
(FIRST scores) was positively associated with indices of cognitive and emotional 
hyperarousal, including pre-sleep cognitive and somatic arousal, rumination, perceived 
stress, arousability, neuroticism and emotion-oriented coping. These data suggest that sleep 
reactivity and cognitive-emotional reactivity are two distinct yet interrelated responses to 
stress. It is important to emphasize here that sleep reactivity and cognitive-emotional 
reactivity may share a bidirectional relationship. For instance, ruminating on a stressor may 
activate wake-promoting processes complicit in stress-related sleep disturbance, whereas 
difficulty sleeping when stressed serves as a breeding ground for ruminative thinking, given 
that the inability to fall asleep creates a period of unstructured and socially isolated time in 
bed.

Not only is sensitivity of the sleep system related to cognitive and emotional processes, but 
early evidence suggests that the two forms of stress reactance may interact to compound the 
risk of disease. Cognitive-emotional arousal in the form of a trait-like tendency to worry and 
ruminate exploits the fragility of sensitive sleep systems, and highly reactive sleepers are 
especially vulnerable to insomnia when they engage in rumination during high stress (Drake 
et al., 2013; see Figure 5). Given that rumination is particularly prevalent and insomniogenic 
during the pre-sleep period (Craske et al., 2002; Harvey, 2000, 2002a, 2002b; Pillai & 
Drake, 2014), the synergistic effects of high sleep reactivity and rumination are likely to 
most evidently manifest as prolonged sleep latency (Drake et al., 2004; Kalmbach, Pillai, 
Arnedt, & Drake, 2016b). That is, highly reactive sleepers are especially vulnerable to 
difficulty falling asleep when ruminating on stressors compared to those individuals with 
low sleep reactivity.

The effects of pre-sleep cognitive arousal are not limited to sleep initiation. In a recent 
review, Riemann et al. (2012) reported that pre-sleep cognitive content often reappears later 
in the night during dreams. Notably, sleep physiology research shows that insomniacs have 
fragmented REM sleep (Feige et al., 2008, 2013; Riemann et al., 2012), and a recent study 
showed that a pre-sleep negative affect induction task increased the number of awakenings 
during REM sleep (Vandekerckhove & Cluydts, 2010). Subjective reports are consistent 
with these sleep physiology findings, such that insomniacs report REM sleep mentation as 
more wake-like and emotionally negative than good sleepers (Feige et al., 2018). Riemann’s 
team presented these findings in the context of highlighting REM instability (i.e. frequent 
micro- and macro-arousals during REM sleep) as a possible biomarker of insomnia. They 
proposed that the content of pre-sleep cognitive arousal dominates dream content and 
increases arousal, thus resulting in fragmentation of REM sleep. Indeed, recent evidence 
suggests that REM instability reflects interference of overnight resolution of stress, the 
accumulation of which may contribute to chronic hyperarousal (Wassing et al., 2016). 
Riemann et al. proposed that REM sleep fragmentation may lead to rebounds in REM 
pressure (↓ REM latency, ↑ REM density) resembling sleep abnormalities in the transition

from acute to chronic insomnia (Ellis, Perlis, Bastien, Gardani, & Espie, 2014) and in 
depression (Pillai, Kalmbach, & Ciesla, 2011).

Owing to the hallmark of cognitive-emotional arousal in both sleep reactivity and REM 
instability, it is possible that highly reactive sleepers, even prior to morbidity, show REM 
instability in their sleep profiles. Moreover, REM instability may explain the reduction in 
REM and micro-fragmentation of sleep among highly reactive sleepers during stress 
(Petersen et al., 2013), although it is important to emphasize here that no consistent evidence 
regarding REM abnormalities in high sleep reactivity yet exists. More laboratory-based PSG 
studies are needed to clarify the relationship between sleep reactivity and REM sleep 
architecture during high and low stress. Laboratory studies characterizing baseline and 
stress-induced REM sleep profiles in high versus low-sleep-reactivity individuals may 
clarify REM sleep characteristics associated with sleep reactivity and stress.

12 |  FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Sleep reactivity is a relatively young area of research. Here, we propose four key areas for 
future research in sleep reactivity, including: (a) improved characterization of its 
neurobiology and relation to cognitive and emotional processes, (b) associations with 
various insomnia phenotypes, (c) implications for prevention and treatment in behavioural 
sleep medicine, and (d) prognostic value of sleep reactivity for non-sleep-related disorders.

12.1 |  The neurobiology of sleep reactivity: Next steps

12.1.1 |  Neurobiology next steps: Genetic and genomic science—Although 
transient sleep difficulties are quite normal on occasion (Ohayon, 2002), individuals with 
high sleep reactivity appear especially vulnerable to stress-related sleep disturbances 
spinning out of control and evolving into insomnia disorder. The precise neurobiological 
system involved and how these aetiological processes occur over time is an important area of 
further study. Despite heritability studies supporting a genetic basis for sleep reactivity 
(Drake et al., 2008, 2011), no studies to date have utilized large-scale genomewide 
association techniques or genetic sequencing to adequately investigate its genetic 
architecture. This is particularly intriguing given that a premorbid study of sleep reactivity 
would allow investigation of genetic aspects of insomnia that are independent of the 
potentially confounding effects of environmental stress exposure and chronic sleep loss 
associated with the onset of insomnia disorder.

Genomic methods hold promise for providing critical information on the sleep, stress and 
other unknown systems involved in sleep reactivity. Further, evidence suggests that exposure 
to stress and insomnia development can sensitize the sleep system, thereby increasing 
sensitivity to future stress and subsequent pathology (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et 
al., 2016). These findings are consistent with Palagini and colleagues’ proposal that 
exposure to stress and insomnia changes the expression of genes involved in sleep and stress 
regulation. Thus, characterization of these epigenetic mechanisms may provide much needed 
insights into the genetic influences of sleep reactivity beyond simply its architecture.

12.1.2 |  Neurobiology next steps: Disrupted cortical networks—Research shows 
that insomnia can result from a conflict between sleep-promoting processes and 
inappropriate activation of the central nervous system (CNS; Bonnet & Arand, 2010). 
Elevated encephalographic-defined (EEG) cortical activity when trying to fall asleep and 
during sleep is a marker of insomnia (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2016; Perlis, Merica, 
Smith, & Giles, 2001) and may also represent a shared mechanism that increases the risk of 
mental illness among insomniacs (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2016). Laboratory research is 
needed to evaluate whether good sleepers with high versus low sleep reactivity differ in 
cortical activity prior to and in response to stress exposure. These results can establish 
whether disrupted cortical networks preexist insomnia development and are indicative of a 
sensitive sleep system.

Earlier in the review, we stated that sleep reactivity is most pathological and ergo clinically 
pertinent when in excess. We would like to expand on this statement here to emphasize that 
individuals with high cognitive-emotional hyperarousal may remain very much ‘under 
stress’ cognitively and emotionally, long after the elimination of a stressful stimulus. Given 
the close relationship between cognitive-emotional hyperarousal and sleep reactivity 
(Fernandez-Mendoza, Shaffer et al., 2014; Fernandez-Mendoza, Vgontzas et al., 2014), and 
their combined synergistic effects on negative health outcomes (Drake et al., 2013), 
individuals with high sleep reactivity appear especially vulnerable to the insomniogenic 
effects of disrupted cortical networks. One potential mechanism may involve stress exposure 
exploiting the fragility of sensitive sleep systems via cortical hyperactivity or hyperreactivity 
overriding sleep-promoting processes. Evidence clearly shows that cognitive-emotional and 
sleep reactivityrelated factors produce disruptions in sleep, and that these constructs are 
unique but tightly interrelated. Future research using objective markers is needed to tease 
apart the influences of sleep reactivity and cognitive-emotional reactivity to determine their 
respective and relative contributions to the development of insomnia and related disorders.

12.1.3 |  Neurobiology next steps: Stress dysregulation—Early evidence also 
implicates sympathetic nervous system hyperactivation and parasympathetic under-
activation in high sleep reactivity (Bonnet & Arand, 2010). Among good sleepers, those with 
high sleep reactivity exhibit low parasympathetic activity and high sympathetic activity 
(Bonnet & Arand, 2003). In this study, high versus low reactive sleepers did not differ in 
mood or personality indices and stress exposures were affectively neutral. Thus, autonomic 
imbalance in highly reactive sleepers appears largely independent of potential cognitive and 
emotional influences, at least at this early premorbid stage. Notably, this high sympathetic 
activity and low parasympathetic activity profile is consistent with what we see in chronic 
insomniacs in comparison to healthy controls (Bonnet & Arand, 1998).

Adding to this literature, a recent study by Dang-Vu’s team examined parasympathetic 
activity (high-frequency and low-frequency heart rate variability [HF- and LF-HRV]) in 
association with stress exposure, worry and sleep (Gouin, Wenzel, Deschenes, & Dang-Vu, 
2013). The authors found that low HF-HRV during worry (i.e. blunted parasympathetic 
activation) was associated with poor sleep quality and corresponded to greater sleep 
reactivity (measured by stress-induced changes in reported sleep quality). These data 
indicate that low parasympathetic activity during worry predicts poor sleep and greater

sensitivity of the sleep system to stress, thus providing laboratory support for our prior 
epidemiological finding that rumination augments the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity in 
insomnia development (Drake et al., 2013). Even so, future work is needed to clarify the role 
of ANS dysregulation in sleep reactivity, particularly in light of some evidence suggesting 
that ANS indices may not differ between those with high and low sleep reactivity (Chen, 
Jarrin, Ivers, & Morin, 2017).

In further support of an underlying neurobiological diathesis for insomnia, Chen et al. 
compared physiological stress regulation across three groups of adolescents: insomniacs, 
good sleepers with high sleep reactivity, and good sleepers with low sleep reactivity (Chen et 
al., 2017). Overall findings suggested that increased hyperarousal at night and greater HPA 
axis reactivity to acute laboratory stress (Trier Social Stress Test) may constitute trait-like 
markers for insomnia vulnerability. These data suggest that stress-related HPA reactivity 
may underlie high sleep reactivity. However, contrary to these data, our team recently 
identified that good sleepers with high sleep reactivity and familial insomnia risk exhibit a 
blunted cortisol response to laboratory stress (also the Trier Social Stress Test; Drake, 
Cheng, Almeida, & Roth, 2017). The role of cortisol as the critical negative feedback 
component of the stress response suggests that a lack of such a response may reduce an 
individual’s adaptive reaction to naturalistic stress and is thus a plausible mechanism for the 
evolution to chronic insomnia (Vgontzas et al., 2001). Taken together, these two recent 
studies suggest that the sensitivity of the sleep system is associated with HPA dysregulation, 
while offering very different characterizations of the inner machinations (i.e. an exaggerated 
versus blunted HPA stress response corresponding to high sleep reactivity). Further research 
is needed to clarify the relationship between HPA activity and sleep reactivity. Moreover, the 
causal implications of these unique HPA axis markers of insomnia diathesis remain 
unknown. Potential next steps include prospectively investigating whether a blunted and/or 
exaggerated cortisol response to stress associated with high versus low sleep reactivity 
augurs future insomnia development, and how HPA regulation changes with new versus 
recurrent disease onset.

Going forward, a notable obstacle to the identification of unique neurobiological bases of 
sleep reactivity that are independent of general cognitive responses to stress is that the 
assessment of sleep reactivity generally relies on self-report measures. This method is of 
course in contrast to PSG-defined first night effects and similar methods (discussed in Roots 
in Situational Insomnia and Measuring Sleep Reactivity sections earlier in the review), 
which are limited by high resource demands and dependence on PSG-naïve subjects (for 
first night effects). Nevertheless, reliance on perceptual evaluation of a stress–sleep response 
is likely to overrepresent the cognitive component of this relationship. Indeed, it would 
appear unlikely that any self-report measure of sleep reactivity could fully dissociate sleep 
system sensitivity from differential cognitive responses to stress. Further explorations of 
sleep reactivity as a process independent of cognitive responses (i.e. an inherent part of the 
sleep-response system) will require the development of more sophisticated objective tools 
for the assessment of sleep reactivity. Although this is undoubtedly a challenge for future 
studies on sleep reactivity, the recent advancement of cost-effective ambulatory objective 
sleep measures may play a critical role.

Insomnia phenotypes—Insomnia is a heterogeneous disorder, reflecting its 

12.1.4 | 
multifactorial and complex aetiology. Depending on operationalizations, it is estimated that 
62%–77% of insomniacs have high premorbid sleep reactivity, and women are over-
represented among highly reactive sleepers and insomniacs. Prolonged sleep latency is a 
robust hallmark of stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep reactivity (Bonnet & Arand, 
2003; Drake et al., 2004; Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016b), and implicates pre-
sleep arousal as their basis. The sleep-onset insomnia phenotype is associated with poor 
prognosis as it portends a higher likelihood of persistence than the sleep-maintenance or 
combined (onset and maintenance) phenotypes at the time of disease onset (Pillai et al., 
2014). In addition, preliminary evidence presented in this review suggests that exceptionally 
high sleep reactivity may underlie the short-sleep insomnia phenotype, which is the most 
biologically severe and treatment-resistant phenotype (Bathgate et al., 2017; Vgontzas et al., 
2013). Recent theories propose that HPA dysregulation, disrupted cortical networks, 
sympathetic over-activation and parasympathetic under-activation comprise the 
neurobiological bases of short sleep insomnia (Vgontzas et al., 2013). This neurobiological 
hyperarousal and stress dysregulation contribute to the high rates of mental illness among 
short-sleeping insomniacs, even in the absence of poor cognitive-emotional coping 
(Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2015; Vgontzas et al., 2013). High sleep reactivity augurs highly 
severe, persistent and treatment-resistant forms of insomnia. By extension, premorbid sleep 
reactivity can be used to identify high-risk individuals toward whom preventive efforts can 
be targeted, whereas sleep reactivity among the already affected may aid in triaging to 
different levels of treatment.

12.1.5|  Treatment implications: Insomnia—A crucial goal in sleep health is 
prevention, and a necessary but not sufficient step towards prevention is identifying 
individuals at risk of disease prior to onset. Highly reactive sleepers represent a critical 
target group at risk of insomnia, SWD and comorbid mental illness. Occupational research 
has supported poor sleep as a risk factor for sleep problems, mental illness and vocational 
impairment across a variety of professions (Baldwin & Daugherty, 2004; Charles et al., 
2007; Kalmbach, Arnedt, Song, Guille, & Sen, 2017; Mohr et al., 2003; Olson, Drage, & 
Auger, 2009; Rajaratnam et al., 2011; Sen et al., 2010, 2013; Vorona, Chen, & Ware, 2009). 
Thus, health evaluation at the time of employment may involve assessing sleep reactivity. 
Although evaluating for other sleep parameters would be helpful and identify poor sleepers, 
research shows that sleep reactivity is a better prognostic indicator for future sleep pathology 
than poor sleep quality (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 2016b). This is perhaps 
attributable to the often-transient nature of sleep problems because an absence of sleep 
problems at a given moment does not necessarily reflect a healthy sleep system, nor do sleep 
problems at any one moment necessarily reflect a fragile sleep system. Highly reactive 
sleepers transitioning to shift work or stressful and demanding fields may benefit from the 
knowledge that they have a high risk of sleep problems, which can help them detect early 
signs of insomnia or SWD. Moreover, these at-risk individuals can be provided with sleep 
information or even low-intensity stepped-care approaches designed to help mitigate the 
effects of stress and shift work on the sleep system (Drake, 2015). Given the cognitive-
emotional component of sleep reactivity, guidance and promotion of adaptive coping 
strategies for stress may lessen the risk of disease.

Evaluating sleep reactivity in patients with insomnia may have value in triaging to different 
levels of intervention. Stepped-care approaches have been recommended for cognitive-
behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTI; Espie, 2009), and early evidence supports the 
scalability of CBTI for insomnia (Manber, Simpson, & Bootzin, 2015). Insomniacs with low 
sleep reactivity may have less severe forms of the disorder that may be amenable to less 
intensive treatment modalities such as self-guided digital/internet-based delivery of CBTI, 
which has been shown to effectively alleviate symptoms of insomnia, anxiety and depression 
(Blom et al., 2015; Espie, Hames, & Mckinstry, 2013; Feuerstein et al., 2017; Lancee, Van 
Straten, Morina, Kaldo, & Kamphuis, 2016; Pillai et al., 2015; Zachariae, Lyby, & 
Ritterband, 2016). Highly reactive insomniacs, however, may benefit more from intensive 
and highly personalized cognitive-behavioural treatment provided by clinical experts. Given 
the vulnerability to wake-promoting arousal among highly reactive sleepers (Drake et al., 
2004), insomniacs with high sleep reactivity may benefit from adjunct pharmacotherapy to 
augment cognitive-behavioural interventions. Overall treatment response and long-term 
outcomes may also be enhanced by greater focus on maladaptive reactions to stress, 
including maladaptive coping and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep. Even after insomnia 
remission, evidence suggests that sleep reactivity does not decrease into the healthy range 
(Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016). Thus, even after treatment success, 
remitted insomniacs with elevated sleep reactivity should continue to adopt ongoing 
preventive efforts.

12.2 |  Treatment implications: Positive airway pressure treatment for sleep-disordered 
breathing

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing. 
OSA is caused by obstructions of the upper airway, resulting in shallowed and interrupted 
breathing during sleep (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014). The most widely 
supported and prescribed treatment for OSA is positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy 
(Adult Obstructive Sleep Apnea Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 
2009), which involves a mobile respiratory device to provide compressed air to support the 
airway during sleep via a facial mask. Individuals undergoing PAP therapy vary greatly in 
their ability to tolerate wearing a mask or breathing with constant in-flow of air pressure 
during sleep. Indeed, intolerance of the mask and/or air pressure is the largest barrier to 
successful OSA treatment with PAP therapy. Future research is needed to determine whether 
highly reactive sleepers are more likely to experience insomnia as a result of PAP therapy 
intolerance. If high sleep reactivity portends difficulty tolerating PAP therapy, then highly 
reactive sleepers may be good candidates for (a) early psychological intervention to promote 
PAP tolerance, habituation and desensitization or (b) alternative treatment methods for OSA, 
such as oral appliances, when applicable.

12.3 |  Prognostic value of sleep reactivity for non-sleep stress-related disorders

Recent evidence suggests that the pathogenicity of a highly sensitive sleep system is not 
limited exclusively to sleep and circadian disorders. Depression and anxiety are more severe 
at insomnia onset among those with highly sensitive sleep systems (Kalmbach, Pillai, 
Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016). More to the point, evidence also shows that high sleep 
reactivity directly increases the risk of mental illness, although some data suggest that this

relationship is partly mediated by developing sleep pathology (Drake et al., 2013; Kalmbach 
et al., 2015; Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, Anderson et al., 2016; Vargas et al., 2015). Even so, 
these findings offer strong early support for sleep reactivity as a trait that indicates 
vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders.

A potential next step for sleep reactivity research may involve evaluating its prognostic value 
for non-sleep stress-related disorders outside of mental illness. A burgeoning literature 
shows that stress has harmful effects on the cardiovascular, metabolic and gastrointestinal 
systems (Brotman, Golden, & Wittstein, 2007; Mulle & Vaccarino, 2013; Rosmond & 
Björntorp, 2000). It is possible that individuals with sensitive sleep systems are more 
vulnerable to the pathogenic effects of stress on the cardiometabolic systems, suggesting a 
potential direct link between high sleep reactivity and cardiometabolic dysregulation. 
Further, given the high rates of cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders among 
insomniacs with short sleep duration (Vgontzas et al., 2013), any links between sleep 
reactivity and cardiometabolic risk may be partly mediated through the development of short 
sleep and insomnia.

Exploration of a potential relationship between sleep reactivity and cardiovascular reactivity 
lends itself to a variety of innovative laboratory experiments. High cardiovascular reactivity 
among individuals with high sleep reactivity would support the transdiagnostic validity of 
both sleep reactivity and cardiovascular reactivity, and possibly implicate cardiovascular 
dysregulation in sleep pathology. Such evidence would be consistent with recent findings of 
genetic overlap in insomnia, mental illness and cardiometabolic disorders (Hammerschlag et 
al., 2017; Lane et al., 2017), thus supporting insomnia and cardiometabolic disorders as 
manifestations of overlapping aetiological factors (Kalmbach, Pillai, Arnedt, & Drake, 
2016a; Vgontzas et al., 2013). Long-term prospective epidemiological studies examining 
premorbid sleep reactivity as a predictor of future risk of cardiometabolic disorders would 
be needed to confirm whether the sensitivity of the sleep system has any prognostic value for 
this related area of disease.

FIGURE 4. 
The role of sleep reactivity in the impact of stress on sleep. Although stress disturbs sleep in 
persons with both low and high sleep reactivity, those with high sleep reactivity experience 
relatively greater sleep disturbance. Moreover, whereas persons with low sleep reactivity 
return to normal sleep following a normal stressor, those with high sleep reactivity are less 
likely to experience such a reprieve, and are thus more likely to develop insomnia disorder

FIGURE 5. 
Depiction of the cyclical impact of sleep reactivity in sleep disturbance. Sleep reactivity 
predisposes individuals to sleep disturbance and subsequent neurocognitive factors 
following stress, including conditioned arousal and cognitive alterations. These in turn 
presage the development of insomnia disorder, which increases sleep reactivity, heightening 
the likelihood of future sleep disturbance. PSG, polysomnography
