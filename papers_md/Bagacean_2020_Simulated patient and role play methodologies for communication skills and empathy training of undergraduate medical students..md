Abstract

Background: Verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as empathy are central to patient-doctor interactions
and have been associated with patients’ satisfaction. Non-verbal communication tends to override verbal messages.
The aim of this study was to analyze how medical students use verbal and non-verbal communication using two
different educational approaches, student role play (SRP) and actor simulated patient (ASP), and whether the non-
verbal behaviour is different in the two different poses.

Methods: Three raters evaluated 20 students playing the doctor role, 10 in the SRP group and 10 in the ASP group.
The videos were analyzed with the Calgary-Cambridge Referenced Observation Guide (CCG) and, for a more
accurate evaluation of non-verbal communication, we also evaluated signs of nervousness, and posture. Empathy
was rated with the CARE questionnaire. Independent Mann Whitney U tests and Qhi square tests were performed
for statistical analysis.
Results: From the 6 main tasks of the CCG score, we obtained higher scores in the ASP group for the task
‘Gathering information’ (p = 0.0008). Concerning the 17 descriptors of the CCG, the ASP group obtained significantly
better scores for ‘Exploration of the patients’ problems to discover the biomedical perspective’ (p = 0.007),
‘Exploration of the patients’ problems to discover background information and context’ (p = 0.0004) and for ‘Closing
the session – Forward planning’ (p = 0.02). With respect to non-verbal behaviour items, nervousness was
significantly higher in the ASP group compared to the SRP group (p < 0.0001). Concerning empathy, no differences
were found between the SRP and ASP groups.

Conclusions: Medical students displayed differentiated verbal and non-verbal communication behaviour during the
two communication skills training methodologies. These results show that both methodologies have certain
advantages and that more explicit non-verbal communication training might be necessary in order to raise
students’ awareness for this type of communication and increase doctor-patient interaction effectiveness.

Background
Effective communication and empathy are central to
patient-doctor interactions and have been shown to be
associated with patients’ satisfaction, disclosure, compli-
ance, and ultimately, with the outcomes of the medical
process [1–3]. Moreover, patient-centered care was asso-
ciated with decreased utilization of health care services
and lower total annual charges [4]. Therefore, programs
on communication skills training, including empathy as
the ability to communicate an understanding of a pa-
tient’s world and to act on that understanding in a thera-
peutic way, have a well established value in the medical
curricula [4, 5]. Communication in medical encounters
comprises verbal and non-verbal aspects. Non-verbal
messages tend to override the verbal messages and as re-
ported by Mehrabian and Ferris, the impact of the verbal
communication represents only 7% from the total im-
pact of communication [6, 7]. On the other side, vocal
communication has an impact of 38% and facial commu-
nication, 55% [6]. Therefore, non-verbal signs of the
physician like eye contact, posture, tone of voice, greatly
influences patient’s disclosure and satisfaction [7, 8].
Empathy is also a critical point of the communication
process and is associated with patients’ satisfaction and
outcomes [9–11].

Based on the premise that communication skills and
empathy are malleable qualities that can be learned and
improved, educators are continuously improving their
didactic methods in order to teach effectively medical
communication and empathy [12–14]. Interactive ap-
proaches that typically rely on role play, simulated or
standardized patients are now favored [15, 16].

Taking into account that health systems worldwide are
facing shortages in terms of resources, including their
resources for medical education, the student role play
(SRP) represents a cost-free, and therefore, an attractive
approach for medical curriculum designers [17]. Previ-
ous research has shown that there is a particular educa-
tional benefit to SRP, regarding students’ understanding
of the patient perspective, which can be achieved by
playing not only the doctor role, but also the role of the
patient [18]. Concerning the professional actor simulated
patient (ASP) approach, it represents an expensive tool
for communication skills training but students and fac-
ulty value mostly the realism and the depth of emotion
of the situation, and the layperson perspective and feed-
back of the actor [19, 20].

There are several studies demonstrating comparable
performance levels between ASP and SRP, but there is a
cost-effectiveness advantage for SRP [17, 18]. However,
there are few studies that evaluate the most impactful
part of the communication process, the non-verbal com-
munication [6]. In this context, the aim of our study was
to analyze whether and how well medical students from

the Faculty of Medicine of Brest use skills of verbal and
non-verbal communication in the 2 different approaches,
SRP and ASP. We also wanted to identify if the well rec-
ognized higher authenticity of the ASP approach gener-
ates different non-verbal behaviors as compared to the
SRP approach. The non-verbal behaviors are generally
under less conscious control but if recognized, this type
of communication can also be auto-controlled and im-
proved [21].

Methods
Educational workshops and participants
Since 2016, the undergraduate curricula at the Faculty of
Medicine of Brest, France,
includes a communication
skills training program, with a particular focus on em-
pathy. Researchers identified two types of empathy:
affective and cognitive. Affective empathy refers to sen-
sations and feelings in response to another person’s
emotions, while cognitive empathy refers to the ability
to identify and understand emotions of others [22]. Dur-
ing the communication skills training program, we are
helping students to identify and understand situations,
feelings, motives, and perspectives, and, moreover,
recognize and appreciate concerns of another person; we
are trying to cultivate medical students’ curiosity about
patients and challenge prejudice [23].

The program is relying on an interactive approach by
using SRP for the fourth year medical students and ASP
for the fifth year students. The communication skills
training program is realised at the Simulation Center
(CeSIM) of the Faculty of Medicine.

Communication skills training workshops of the forth
year students were facilitated by a general physician and
a communication specialist. The duration of the work-
shops was of 6 h, during which, 15 students were por-
traying the role of patients, family members and doctors.
The enacted cases were based on typical or usual pre-
sentations of asthma or coronary disease in a patient
who is denying and minimising the disease and who is
accompanied in consultation by a worried family
member.

The fifth year medical students communication skills
training workshops were facilitated by a clinical haema-
tologist, a clinical psychologist and 2 professional actors.
The duration of
the workshops was of 4 h and 15
learners were participating. During the workshop, 2
medical students portraying the doctors interacted dir-
ectly with 2 professional actors portraying the patient
and a family member. Actors are trained to portray a pa-
tient in a clinical scenario, they are not given a specific
script. Instead, they receive all the details of the case in-
cluding symptoms, signs, medical history, patient’s edu-
cation and socioeconomic
status. Based on this
information, they improvise their encounters with the

medical students. The simulated patients are encouraged
to go with their own emotional response to the situation.
The 2 enacted cases represented 2 different times of the
same clinical situation based on a lymphoid disease pres-
entation. The first time the ASP presented systemic
symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats and fever as
well as an inflammatory low back pain. The second time,
the doctor saw the patient with the results of the exams
realised and had to explain to the ASP the presence of a
retroperitoneal adenopathy observed on the CT scan
that needs further exploration by biopsy. The ASP was
initially denying and minimising the symptoms, but be-
came more aware of the situation in the second scenario.
For the 2 consultation times, the ASP was accompanied
in consultation by a second actor playing the role of a
worried family member.

Learners not directly implicated in the SRP and ASP
situations observed the interaction through a closed cir-
cuit video, in another room. All medical simulation in-
terviews were filmed and recorded. Each enactment was
immediately followed by a formal debriefing led by facili-
tators and including all the learners.

Sample studied, student participants and raters
Ten SRP videos and 10 ASP videos were randomly se-
lected from our data base. The standards of the Declar-
ation of Helsinki were maintained and all participants to
the study gave their written consent. The videos were
then analyzed by 3 raters, who carried out data collec-
tion independently. Raters were represented by a clinical
haematologist, a paediatric surgeon and an expert in
communication.

Over the 2 sessions, 20 students participated in the
study, 9 (45%) male and 11 (55%) female (4 male in the
SRP group and 5 in the ASP group, 6 female in the SRP
group and 5 in the ASP group).

Evaluation criteria
For the observation of the videos, 4 different instruments
have been used. A global assessment of the communica-
tion skills was done by using the short version of the
Calgary-Cambridge Referenced Observation Guide
(CCG) (Supplementary Table 1) [13, 24, 25]. The CCG
assessment grids contained 6 tasks with 17 descriptors,
which had to be rated on a 3 point Likert scale (1: Not
done; 2: Incompletely done; 3: Done). Although the
CCG assesses the non-verbal behavior and empathy, in
order to have a more accurate evaluation of these items,
we divided the non-verbal behavior criterion into two
parts: signs of nervousness, rated on a 4 point Likert
scale (1: None; 2: Low; 3: Medium; 4: High), and posture
(appropriate/inappropriate) during the first and the last
5 min of the session, as well as the global posture. Em-
pathy was rated with the CARE (Consultation and

Relational Empathy) questionnaire which contains 10
items (Supplementary Table 2) [26–29]. The CARE scor-
ing system was developed initially for assessment of phy-
sicians’ empathy by patients, but we used it in our study
for external rating of empathy. Each item was rated on a
5-point Likert scale (1, Poor; 2: Fair; 3: Good; 4: Very
good, and 5: Excellent). All ten items were then added,
giving a maximum possible score of 50, and a minimum
of 10.

Statistical analysis
Independent Mann Whitney U tests were performed to
identify whether the two groups SRP and ASP yielded
different CCG scores, CARE scores and nervousness
scores. Qhi square tests were performed for posture
evaluations. The same statistical tests were performed to
identify gender communication skills differences. P
values under 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (La
Jolla, CA). Effect size d and Power (1-β err prob) were
calculated with G Power 3.1.9.7. An effect size d ≤ 0.2
was considered a ‘small’ effect size,0.2 ≤ d ≤ 0.5 repre-
sents a ‘medium’ effect size and d ≥ 0.8 a ‘large’ effect
size. Reliability of agreement between the 3 raters was
assesed by calculating Fleiss Kappa with the ReCal3 0.1
software (http://dfreelon.org/recal/recal3.php).

Results
Communication skills differences between SRP and ASP
groups
Independent t-tests were performed in order to identify
if the 2 groups SRP (n = 10) and ASP (n = 10) yielded
different CCG scores (Table 1). The overall CCG scores
difference between the 2 groups did not reach statistical
significance. The reliability of agreement between the 3
raters concerning the CCG scores was substantial, with
a Fleiss kappa (FK) = 0.72 for the SRP group and FK =
0.74 for the ASP group [32]. From the 6 main tasks,
namely initiating the session, gathering information, ex-
planation and planning, building the relationship, pro-
viding structure and closing the session, we obtained a
significant statistical difference for the task ‘gathering in-
formation’, with higher scores attained by the ASP group
(SRP group mean = 7.36 ± 1.45, ASP group mean = 8.46 ±
0.73, p = 0.0008, effect size d = 0.95, Power (1-β err prob) =
0.53). Concerning the 17 descriptors of the CCG, we ob-
tained higher scores in the ASP group for ‘Gathering in-
formation – Exploration of the patients’ problems to
discover the biomedical perspective’ (SRP group mean =
2.36 ± 0.76, ASP group mean = 2.83 ± 0.37, p = 0.007, effect
size d = 0.79, Power (1-β err prob) = 0.38), ‘Gathering in-
formation – Exploration of the patients’ problems to dis-
cover background information and context’ (SRP group
mean = 2.26 ± 0.69, ASP group mean = 2.83 ± 0.37, p =

p = 0.02, effect size d = 0.58, Power (1-β err prob) = 0.23).

With respect to non-verbal behaviour items, nervousness
was significantly higher in the ASP group compared to the
SRP group (p < 0.0001, effect size d = 1.25, Power (1-β err
prob) = 0.75, SRP group mean = 1.33 ± 0.54, ASP group
mean = 2.36 ± 1.03). The reliability of agreement between the
3 raters concerning the nervousness was substantial, with a
FK = 0.75 for the SRP group and FK = 0.72 for the ASP
group. No significant difference was observed between the 2
groups for posture in the first 5 min, last five minutes and
the entire session (SRP FK = 0.82, ASP FK = 0.65). The most
frequent signs of nervousness observed by the raters were
self-touching (rubbing one’s face, grooming the hair), fre-
quent postural shift, manipulation of objects (mostly the
pen) and inappropriate facial display such as smiling or
laughing.

Concerning empathy, no differences were found be-
tween the SRP and ASP groups for the global CARE ques-
tionnaire or CARE items. The reliability of agreement
between the 3 raters concerning CARE scores was sub-
stantial, with a FK = 0.72 for the SRP group and FK = 0.74
for the ASP group.

Gender specific aspects of communication skills
As it is well known that communication styles of female
physicians interacting with patients are consistently differ-
ent from their male counterparts, we also compared the
male and female students participating in the study [33].

Concerning the CCG scores, no significant differences
were achieved between Female (n = 11) and male (n = 9)
students for the global score but female students per-
formed significantly better for the main task ‘Building
the relationship’
(female group mean = 8.27 ± 1, male
group mean = 7.40 ± 1.21, p = 0.002, effect size d = 0.78,

‘Initiating the session – Identifying the reasons for the

(female group mean = 2.97 ± 0.17, male
group mean = 2.77 ± 0.5, p = 0.04, effect size d = 0.53,
Power (1-β err prob) = 0.20), and ‘Building the relation-
ship – Using appropriate non-verbal behavior’ (female
group mean = 2.8 ± 0.46, male group mean = 2.4 ± 0.63,
p = 0.003, effect size d = 0.73, Power (1-β err prob) =
0.35) (Table 2). The FK concerning the CCG scores
shows a substantial reliability of agreement between the
3 raters (Male FK = 0.72, Female FK = 0.72). With re-
spect to non-verbal communication items, nervousness
and posture and to empathy evaluated by the CARE
score, no significant differences were found between the
2 gender groups.

Discussion
This study demonstrated that there is no significant dif-
ference between ASP and SRP in global communication
skills evaluated by the CCG questionnaire. However,

students’ communication skills were more appropriate
when interacting with a professional actor rather than
with a student colleague, in terms of gathering informa-
tion in order to discover the biomedical perspective,
background information and context but also in terms
of closing the session with forward planning. When
raters evaluated the items ‘gathering information’
in
order to discover the biomedical perspective, back-
ground information and context, they evaluated if stu-
dents: (1) tended to facilitate patient’s responses verbally
or non-verbally, (2) paid more attention to the verbal
and non-verbal cues (body language, facial expression,
affect), (3) clarified patient’s statements that were un-
clear, (4) periodically summarized to verify own under-
standing of what the patient had said, (5) used concise,
easily understood questions and comments, avoided or
adequately explained jargon, (6) established dates and
sequence of events. All the items before cited are linked
to known valuable actor contributions like the higher

authenticity and realism of the ASP situation as well as
to the actors’ lack of medical knowledge, an important
asset for the medical experience [19]. The actors’ flexi-
bility in verbal and non-verbal communication as well as
their emotional commitment seemed to generate more
concentration/attention from the learner as well as a
more adapted language. While colleagues know what to
anticipate and have comparable clinical knowledge, ac-
tors are highly improvisational. There may be certain
strategies and even protocols to approach challenging
conversations, but the reality is that no two clinical con-
versations are the same. A successful approach in one
setting may be inadequate or even problematic with an-
other patient or family. Relational proficiency in medical
interviews necessitates recognition of, and flexible re-
sponse to, variable patient and family cues [34]. In the
ASP context, this relational flexibility seems to be higher
and learners have better suited communication skills for
gathering information.

However, an interesting observation is that no differ-
ence was observed between the SRP and ASP groups for
the item ‘Gathering information exploration of the pa-
tient’s problems to discover the patient’s perspective’.
This item requires a more empathic approach for gath-
ering information. In order to respond to this item,
raters paid attention if the learner explored patient’s
ideas, patient’s concerns regarding each problem, pa-
tient’s expectations, how each problem affects the pa-
tient’s life and if he/she encouraged the patient
to
express feelings. This result is in accordance with the
fact that no differences were observed between the SRP
and ASP groups concerning the ‘Building relationship’
CCG main task or empathy, as evaluated with the CARE
score. During the SRP training, the learner who played
the doctor role had not also played the role of the pa-
tient. In order to make the access to an empathic ap-
proach easier for the peer role play-group, students have
to switch roles (doctor and patient), but it was not the
case for the SRP training in this study [18, 35]. HM
Bosse et al showed that having role-played both the doc-
tor and patient in the exercise is a key to the success of
peer role play and creates a heightened awareness for
the ambiguity of roles of the partners in communication,
facilitating a more empathic approach [18]. The ability
to sense and appreciate patients’ views, as well as the
empathic approach towards the patients represent the
basis for a functioning and safe patient–physician rela-
tionship [36]. It improves patient adherence and sup-
ports patient safety which are increasingly important
issues in physicians’ daily work [37, 38]. Most certainly,
switching roles in peer role play should be mandatory
during our communication skills training program in
order to allow learners to experience both biomedical
and patient perspectives.

With respect to non-verbal behaviour items, nervous-
ness was significantly higher in the ASP group compared
to the SRP group. The most frequent signs of nervous-
ness observed by the raters were self-touching (rubbing
one’s face, grooming the hair), frequent postural shift,
manipulation of objects (mostly the pen) and inappropri-
ate facial display such as smiling or laughing. The deeper
authenticity of the ASP situation and the emotional
commitment of the professional actors pushed learners
at more important levels of emotion depth, which could
explain the higher nervousness [19]. Self-touching or
unpurposive movements are signs of anxiety, tension
and preoccupation and these non-verbal behaviors are
known to accompany a lower patient satisfaction [8, 39].
Repeating the ASP exercise could diminish nervousness,
increase auto-control and improve learner’s perform-
facial display,
ance. Concerning the
namely smiling or laughing at inappropriate moments
during the medical interview, in the European culture, it
appears to cover embarrassment [40]. Embarrassment is
a feeling of concern with one’s public image and with
the reactions from others to inappropriate behaviour
[40]. Therefore learners in the ASP group present more
embarrassment signals compared to the SRP group, as a
sign of failure to present a desired image to the actors,
whom they seem to regard as evaluators of their per-
formance. The embarrassment signals have a disruptive
effect upon social
interaction therefore, repeating the
ASP exercise could also diminish these signals and im-
prove students’ performances.

inappropriate

Concerning the gender specific differences in CCG
scores, female students performed significantly better for
the task ‘Building the relationship - Using appropriate
non-verbal behavior’ and ‘Initiating the session – Identi-
fying the reasons for the consultation’. Our results are
consistent with several studies showing that female phy-
sicians interact differently with the patients, compared
to their male counterpart by showing more empathy,
using more positive statements and more affective be-
havior when communicating diagnosis-specific informa-
tion [41–46].
Several

limitations to our study should be noted in
interpreting these findings. First, its representativeness is
weighed down by the small sample of students who par-
ticipated in the study. However, the fact that all 20 stu-
dents were evaluated independently by 3 raters increased
the accuracy of the results. Second, the communication
skills assessment was based on several different scenar-
ios. It has been previously suggested that the feasibility
of a communication skills assessment would depend on
the difficulty of the contents of the medical interviews
[47]. We consider that even though we used different
scenarios, they were similarly challenging for the stu-
dents. Third, the students from the ASP group were

1 year older than those from the SRP group. The more
adequate skills of ASP group in terms of gathering infor-
mation in order to discover the biomedical perspective,
background information and context, but also in terms
of closing the session with forward planning could also
be due to their supplementary year of medical education.
Forth, although non-verbal behaviors, like nervousness,
are under less conscious control than verbal behaviors,
and are generally irrepressible, students may have acted
differently than in real-life situations because of the sim-
ulated nature of the consultation and because they were
also being filmed and observed by their colleagues [8,
21]. However, the SRP and ASP workshops took place
under the same conditions, therefore, if non-verbal be-
havior results were biased by these conditions, they were
equally biased in both groups. Finally, the impact of the
non-verbal behavior was assessed through an overall rat-
ing of posture and nervousness rather than a measure of
specific behaviors.

Conclusion
In this study, data presented suggested that the two
communication skills training methods SRP and ASP are
highly comparable for undergraduate medical students.
However, it also suggested that the ASP method, pushes
the learner to use more adapted communication skills
for gathering biomedical and context information as well
as for closing the session with forward planning. Our re-
sults did not show any educational benefit for the ASP
method, regarding the empathic approach and students’
the patient’s perspective. Switching
understanding of
doctor-role with patient-role in the SRP setting might
improve these skills in medical students. As the ASP ap-
proach generated significantly more frequent signs of
nervousness, a new training program for the fifth year
medical students’ had been introduced in the Faculty of
Medicine of Brest curricula. This new training is based
on drama exercises designed to heighten an awareness
of sight, hearing, touch and proxemics in non-verbal
communication.
