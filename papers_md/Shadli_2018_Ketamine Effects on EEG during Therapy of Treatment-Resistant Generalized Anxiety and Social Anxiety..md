Abstract

Background: Ketamine is swiftly effective in a range of neurotic disorders that are resistant to conventional antidepressant 
and anxiolytic drugs. The neural basis for its therapeutic action is unknown. Here we report the effects of ketamine on the 
EEG of patients with treatment-resistant generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders.
Methods:  Twelve  patients  with  refractory  DSM-IV  generalized  anxiety  disorder  and/or  social  anxiety  disorder  provided 
EEG during 10 minutes of relaxation before and 2 hours after receiving double-blind drug administration. Three ascending 
ketamine dose levels (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.01 mg/kg) were given at 1-week intervals to each patient, with 
the midazolam counterbalanced in dosing position across patients. Anxiety was assessed pre- and postdose with the Fear 
Questionnaire and HAM-A.
Results: Ketamine dose-dependently improved Fear Questionnaire but not HAM-A scores, decreased EEG power most at low 
(delta)  frequency,  and  increased  it  most  at  high  (gamma)  frequency.  Only  the  decrease  in  medium-low  (theta)  frequency 
at  right  frontal  sites  predicted  the  effect  of  ketamine  on  the  Fear  Questionnaire.  Ketamine  produced  no  improvement  in 
Higuchi’s fractal dimension at any dose or systematic changes in frontal alpha asymmetry.
Conclusions: Ketamine may achieve its effects on treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder 
through related mechanisms to the common reduction by conventional anxiolytic drugs in right frontal theta. However, in 
the  current  study  midazolam  did  not  have  such  an  effect,  and  it  remains  to  be  determined  whether,  unlike  conventional 
anxiolytics, ketamine changes right frontal theta when it is effective in treatment-resistant depression.

Introduction

A wide range of “neurotic” disorders (Andrews et al., 1990), even 
when  these  are  resistant  to  conventional  treatment,  respond 
to  ketamine.  The  neural  basis  for  this  therapeutic  effect  of 
ketamine  is  not  known.  Here,  we  report  widespread  effects  of 

ketamine  on  brain  activity  in  patients  resistant  to  other  treat-
ments  for  generalized  anxiety  and  social  anxiety;  and  suggest 
that changes in right-frontal theta band rhythmicity may under-
lie changes in anxiety ratings.

Significance Statement

We report that ketamine decreases low-frequency brain rhythms and increases high ones in patients with treatment-resistant 
generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders. Only the decrease in medium-low frequency (“theta”) power at right frontal 
sites predicted the improvement by ketamine in fear questionnaire scores. This is the first report of the effects of ketamine on 
brain rhythms and treatment-resistant anxiety and suggests that right frontal “theta” rhythmicity may be important for all types 
of anxiolytic action.

Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 
and  social  anxiety  disorder  (SAD)  are  among  the  most  preva-
lent of mental health problems (Stein and Sareen, 2015). In the 
United States, the prevalence of GAD has been reported to be as 
high  as  3.1%  per  year,  and  5.7%  over  a  patient’s  lifetime  (Stein 
and  Sareen,  2015).  Further,  12%  of  the  population  is  affected 
by  SAD,  making  it  a  leading  cause  of  impairment  and  distress 
(Lipsitz and Schneier, 2000; Kessler et al., 2005). SAD, in particu-
lar, has high economic burden, because it causes social impair-
ment,  poor  academic  achievement,  reduced  work  productivity, 
and increased financial dependence on the government (Lipsitz 
and Schneier, 2000). Conventional treatments can take weeks to 
produce their full effects and, worse, one-third of SAD patients 
are treatment resistant (Kelly et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2015, 2018), 
which  increases  outpatient  costs,  doubles  hospitalizations, 
and  produces  substantial  morbidity  (Liebowitz  et  al.,  2003). We 
urgently need novel pharmaceutical agents that are both more 
effective and act quickly (Liebowitz et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2018).
Ketamine  is  an  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor 
antagonist that has been found to be rapidly effective in treat-
ing treatment-resistant depression (Zarate et al., 2006), possibly 
via a non-NMDA route (Zanos et al., 2016). Initial clinical stud-
ies  have  also  demonstrated  rapid  improvement  in  obsessive-
compulsive disorder (Rodriguez et al., 2013) and posttraumatic 
stress disorder (Feder et al., 2014). Converging neuroimaging and 
pharmacological  evidence  implicates  glutamate  abnormalities 
in the pathophysiology of SAD (Freitas-Ferrari et al., 2010; Averill 
et al., 2017), and we have previously reported dose-related effects 
of ketamine on SAD and GAD in treatment-refractory patients 
(Glue et al., 2017). Taken together, these data suggest that keta-
mine  may  be  acting  on  a  single  fundamental  mechanism  to 
produce  rapid  changes  in  the  broad  class  of  “neurotic,  stress-
related and somatoform disorders” (World Health Organization, 
1992) even when these are resistant to conventional treatments.
Anxiety and depression appear to share common changes in 
brain network activity (Pannekoek et al., 2015) and regional grey 
matter  (Van  Tol  et  al.,  2010).  In  depressed  patients,  ketamine 
specifically increases slow wave activity during sleep, especially 
in  those  with  low  baseline  slow  waves,  and  this  may  mediate 
its  antidepressant  effects  (see  Duncan  and  Zarate,  2013).  In 
healthy participants, it can reduce delta (1–3 Hz), theta (4–7 Hz), 
and alpha (8–15 Hz) band power, while increasing gamma (>32 
Hz)  band  power  (Hong  et  al.,  2010;  de  la  Salle  et  al.,  2016).  But 
it can also increase theta power while decreasing alpha power 
(Domino  et  al.,  1965;  Schüttler  et  al.,  1987;  Kochs  et  al.,  1996), 
particularly  at  frontal  sites  (Muthukumaraswamy  et  al.,  2015); 
so  changes  in  bands  can  be  interleaved,  with  decreased  delta, 
alpha,  and  beta  (16–31  Hz)  mixed  with  increased  theta  and 
gamma (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2015; Rivolta et al., 2015).

We  therefore  evaluated  the  effects  of  ketamine  concur-
rently  on  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  EEG  in  treatment-resist-
ant  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
Volume  IV  (American  Psychiatric  Association,  2000)  SAD  and 
GAD  patients  using  an  active-control  double-blinded  design. 
We  assessed  GAD  with  the  Hamilton  Anxiety  Scale/HAM-A 

(Hamilton,  1959)  and  SAD  with  the  Fear  Questionnaire  (FQ; 
Marks and Mathews, 1979). We assessed EEG by quantitation of 
power in specific frequency bands and by measures that show 
depression-related  changes:  frontal  alpha  asymmetry  (FAA; 
Allen  et  al.,  2004;  Stewart  et  al.,  2014;  Mennella  et  al.,  2017) 
and increased Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD; Higuchi, 1988; 
Bachmann et al., 2013; Akar et al., 2015). We predicted that keta-
mine would produce dose-related improvements in symptoms, 
FAA, and HFD; show dose-related power decreases in the delta, 
alpha,  and  beta  bands;  and  power  increases  in  the  theta  and 
gamma bands (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2015).

Methods and Materials

Participants

We  recruited  12  patients  with  refractory  DSM-IV  GAD  and/or 
SAD.  The  Southern  Health  and  Disabilities  Ethics  Committee 
approved  this  study  (15/STH/86).  Patient  inclusion  criteria 
included having a HAM-A score of ≥20, and/or an LSAS (Liebowitz, 
1987)  score  of  ≥60  at  screening,  and  being  aged  18  years  or 
older. All had failed to respond to 2 courses of antidepressants. 
Patients were excluded if there was evidence of severe acute or 
chronic medical disorders or if they were pregnant or lactating; 
taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors, thyroxine, or stimulants, 
or had active suicidal ideation. To reduce the risk that changes 
in  anxiety  ratings  were  confounded  by  comorbid  depression, 
we  excluded  patients  with  Montgomery-Asberg  Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) scores of 
≥20 at screening. All patients provided signed informed consent 
prior  to  enrollment  and  were  assessed  as  suitable  to  partici-
pate based on review of medical history, safety laboratory tests, 
and vital signs. Patients remained on their current medication 
regimens and continued with ongoing psychotherapy. However, 
they started no new treatments and did not change doses/visit 
schedules. There  were  3  ascending  ketamine  dose  levels  (0.25, 
0.5,  and  1  mg/kg)  and  midazolam  (0.01  mg/kg),  administered 
double  blind.  Justification  of  the  3  ketamine  doses  is  provided 
in  Glue  et  al.  (2017)  and  for  the  midazolam  dose  in  Loo  et  al. 
(2016). The choice of control treatment for ketamine studies in 
mood  disorders  is  complicated.  Saline  placebo  has  been  criti-
cized  for  its  lack  of  psychoactive  effects,  which  essentially  is 
unblinding.  Therefore,  we  chose  to  use  midazolam,  which  is 
psychoactive, as an active control for ketamine. The 3 ketamine 
doses  were  administered  in  ascending  order,  with  midazolam 
dosing  randomly  inserted  into  the  dosing  schedule.  All  medi-
cations  were  injected  subcutaneously  in  the  upper  arm,  with 
1 week between doses. The study was registered  prospectively 
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 
12615000617561; http://www.anzctr.org.au/).

Assessments

We monitored patients in the clinic for 2 hours postdose, with 
vital signs obtained predose, and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes 

postdosing  (data  not  reported).  Anxiety  assessments  included 
the  FQ  (score  range  0–136;  Marks  and  Mathews,  1979)  and  the 
HAM-A  (range  0–52;  Hamilton,  1959)  predose,  at  1,  2,  24,  72, 
and  168  hours  postdose.  Tolerability  assessments  included 
reported  adverse  events  throughout  the  study,  and  Clinician 
Administered  Dissociative  States  Scale  (Bremner  et  al.,  1998) 
predose, 30, and 60 minutes postdose. Summary statistics were 
calculated and reported for demographic, vital signs, and rating 
scale  data.  As  EEG  was  only  recorded  predose  and  at  2  hours 
postdose, we report only the predose and 2-hour postdose anxi-
ety scale data here.

Electroencephalography

A Waveguard EEG cap (ANT Neurotechnology) using the 10:20 sys-
tem was used to record brain activity across the frontal lobes of 
the participants, specifically using channels Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, 
F8, and Cz, with left mastoid as the reference electrode. Depending 
on their head circumference, each participant was fitted with one 
of 3 appropriate cap sizes: large (head circumference 57–64 cm), 
medium (53–57 cm), and small (47–53 cm). The EEG cap was con-
nected to a Bioradio (CleveMed: Cleveland Medical Devices Inc.). 
The  Bioradio  used  Bluetooth  to  stream  the  recorded  data  (sam-
pled at 256 Hz) to a computer that stored the data for later offline 
analysis using BioCapture (CleveMed, Cleveland Medical Devices 
Inc.). Participants were fitted with the EEG cap and a recording was 
made prior to study drug administration (predose recording). For 
the predose recording, participants were asked to sit still to reduce 
any noise interference and were then instructed to have their eyes 
open and then closed for alternating 1-minute intervals on request 
for the next 10 minutes. There were, therefore, 5 recorded minutes 
of eyes open and 5 recorded minutes of eyes closed, with marks in 
the EEG file indicating the point of changeover. After the EEG pre-
dose recording, the participants received their SC study drug dos-
ing and were supervised by registered nurses and psychiatrists for 
the next 2 hours, after which participants underwent another EEG 
recording (postdose recording) identical to the predose recording.

EEG Processing

The EEG data were analyzed using custom software written in 
Visual Basic 6. The data were down-sampled to 128 Hz and sub-
mitted to a 3-point running mean as a low pass filter (effective 
46 Hz cut off) and then submitted to an automated procedure for 
eye blink removal, based on the ballistic components of the eye 
blink, which left residual EEG (Zhang et al., 2017).

For simple power analysis, the files were then manually pro-
cessed and any remaining artefacts were replaced with missing 
values. The  recordings  were  separated  into  single  open/closed 
minute  segments  and  a  serial  Fast  Fourier  Transform  with  a 
1-second overlapping Hanning window was applied. The result-
ant power spectra were log transformed to normalize error vari-
ance  and  averaged. This  segmented  the  file  into  10  spectra,  5 
of which eyes were open and 5 of which eyes were closed. For 
the  current  analyses,  these  were  then  averaged  over  minutes 
to produce a single spectrum for each testing occasion for each 
participant. Power was then averaged across frequencies within 
each of the conventional bands to give a single power value for 
each  of  delta  (1–3  Hz),  theta  (4–6  Hz),  alpha1  (7–9  Hz),  alpha2 
(10–12 Hz), beta (25–34 Hz), and gamma (41–53 Hz).

Fractal dimension was calculated using Higuchi’s algorithm 
with a kmax of 8 (Higuchi, 1988). After the eye-blink removal stage, 
the data were subjected to an additional 2- to 36-Hz bandpass 
filter,  and  sections  with  artefacts  were  manually  removed. 
The  continuous  data  were  then  split  into  2-second  (256  sam-
ple)  epochs  with  50%  overlap.  Higuchi’s  algorithm  creates  kmax 
number of new time series (with k running from 1 to kmax), each 
obtained  by  taking  every  kth  sample  of  the  original  epoch. 
The  length  of  the  curve  of  each  series  is  calculated  and  plot-
ted against k on a double logarithmic graph. If the length of the 
curve and k are proportional, then the plotted data will fall on a 
straight line. The slope of this line is the fractal dimension.

Statistical Analysis

The data were submitted to ANOVA in SPSS with channel, fre-
quency,  and  dose  as  within-subjects  variables.  Polynomial 
components  of  all  factors  were  extracted  with  the  MDZ  active 
control treated as 0 mg ketamine. 

Results

Participants

The  participants  were  12  patients  (4  male,  8  female;  mean 
age = 31  years,  range  18–65).  Mean  duration  of  their  anxiety 
disorders  was  13.8  years.  All  12  participants  had  SAD,  10  had 
GAD,  and  2  panic  disorder.  Nine  had  past  MDE  but  none  were 
depressed at the time of enrolment (mean MADRS 6.6). Baseline 
HAMA  score  was  28.1  and  mean  LSAS  was  91.3.  Demographic 
and diagnostic details are provided in Table 1, along with infor-
mation about prior failed treatments for their anxiety disorders.

Changes in Anxiety Ratings

Overall,  8  of  12  patients  (67%)  reported  a  >50%  reduction  in 
HAM-A and/or FQ scores after the 0.5- or 1-mg/kg doses of keta-
mine at 2 hours postdose. Scores are shown in Table 2 and post-
dose  improvement  relative  to  predose  is  shown  in  Figure  1A. 
There was a clear dose-related improvement in FQ scores with 
ketamine  dose  (dose,  F(2.67,  29.41) = 3.80,  P = .024,  Greenhouse-
Geisser corrected; dose[lin], F(1, 11) = 7.12, P = .022) with a trend to 
a ceiling effect or perhaps even reduction at 1.0 mg of ketamine 
(dose[quad],  F(1,  11) = 4.68,  P = .053).  The  very  slight  apparently 
similar  trend  in  HAM-A  scores  (Figure  1A)  was  not  supported 
statistically (all F ≤ 1.2, all P ≥ 0.3).

Ketamine Reduced Low-Frequency and Increased 
High-Frequency EEG Power but Did Not Improve 
HFD or FAA

For all analyses, we treated MDZ as equivalent to 0 mg of keta-
mine. To  simplify  EEG  power  analysis,  we  averaged  across  fre-
quencies within each band. Figure 2A–B shows the effects (with 
statistics  in  the  legend)  of  varying  doses  of  ketamine  on  the 
post:pre  difference  in  EEG  power  for  the  different  frequency 
bands and channels. Across frontal sites (Figure 2A), higher doses 
of  ketamine  significantly  but  nonlinearly  reduced  delta,  and 
sometimes theta, power at the lateral sites F7, F4, and particu-
larly F8, while generally increasing beta and particularly delta.

Alpha  asymmetry  was  calculated  for  both  the  alpha1  and 
alpha2 bands by subtracting logarithmic power at left electrodes 
from  their  right-most  counterparts  [(ln(R)  –  ln(L)]  for  each  of 
F8:F7 and F4:F3.

From  anterior  to  posterior  (Figure  2B),  there  was  a  clear 
dose- and band-related (largest in the delta band) reduction in 
power  at  lower  frequencies  with  ketamine  at  the  fronto-polar 
site, which diminished across the mid-frontal and central sites.

Whereas, there was increased power at higher frequencies that 
tended to increase from frontal to central sites. Changes in HFD 
(Figure  2C)  were  minimal,  nonsignificant,  and  in  the  opposite 
direction  to  that  predicted. There  were  no  systematic  changes 
in  FAA  for  either  F8:F7  or  F4:F3.  As  there  were  no  significant 
effects  differentiating  alpha1  and  alpha2,  the  results  are  aver-
aged across band in Figure 2D.

theta and gamma bands and at all 5 electrode positions showed 
that  with  sample  sizes  ranging  from  3  to  11,  there  was  >80% 
power at alpha = 0.05.

Ketamine Effects on FQ Appear Related to Right-Frontal 
Theta Power

For each of the electrode sites, separately, we carried out a step-
wise  regression  of  FQ  change  score  with  power-change  scores 
for all the bands as predictors. The bulk of the simple correla-
tions  (uncorrected  for  multiple  comparisons)  were  well  within 
95% confidence limits (Figure 1B). The lack of any obvious con-
tribution to FQ change was particularly clear for the delta and 
gamma  bands  despite  the  fact  that  they  were  most  affected 
by  ketamine  (Figure  2A–B).  All  the  highest  correlations  were 
obtained with the theta band with Fz and Cz achieving values 
that would have been significant uncorrected. F4 theta was the 
only power change that was extracted as a significant predictor 
by the stepwise analysis, with the other high values surrounding 
it. To test the structure of these adjacent values we forced F3, Fz, 
F4, F8, and Cz into a multiple regression on FQ. The total predict-
ive power of the equation as a whole was 17%, about 5% greater 
than F4 alone, with the bulk of the additional explanatory power 
coming from a unique contribution (3%) from the contralateral 
site F3. Of the remaining 14%, 9% was variance shared among Fz, 
F4, F8, and Cz and 5% was unique to F4, with F8 and Cz having 
no  unique  contribution. These  results  are  consistent  with  the 
bulk of the effect of ketamine on FQ being mediated by a single 
source close to F4, with some spread of activity to the immedi-
ately adjacent electrodes, and a weak contribution from an inde-
pendent source in a similar location in the opposite hemisphere.

Discussion

Our  main  finding  is  that  ketamine  produced  a  dose-related 
decrease, maximal at 0.5 mg, in theta frequency frontal power at 
the right frontal site F4 that appears to mediate its therapeutic 
effects on GAD and SAD, as measured by the FQ. Similar power 
changes in the theta range at adjacent sites appeared to be less 
involved in controlling FQ, while larger decreases in power in the 
delta  range  and  large  increases  in  power  in  the  gamma  range 
appeared to make no contribution to changes in FQ. Ketamine 
produced no sign of an improvement in HFD scores at any dose 
and no systematic or reliable changes in FAA. Reduced anxiety 
has  previously  been  reported  with  ketamine  (Glue  et  al.,  2017; 
Taylor et al., 2018); however, we saw significant changes only in 
FQ and no large changes in HAM-A scores.

Our alpha asymmetry results are against our prediction but 
not entirely surprising. FAA has previously been linked to aver-
sion/withdrawal/pessimism/introversion  in  general  (Wacker 
et al., 2010; De Pascalis et al., 2013; Wacker, 2017) and not depres-
sion or anxiety (Bruder et al., 1997; Mathersul et al., 2008; Adolph 
and  Margraf,  2017)  in  particular.  It  shows  a  trait-like  reliability 
and  stability  that  (over  months)  is  not  related  to  changes  in 
depressed  state  in  patients  with  major  depression  (Debener 
et al., 2000; Allen et al., 2004) and may be a predictor of future 
disorder rather than a biomarker of current disorder (Smith and 
Bell, 2010).

Our  fractal  dimension  results  are  also  against  our  predic-
tion.  This  measure  has  so  far  been  linked  only  to  depression 
(Bachmann  et  al.,  2013;  Akar  et  al.,  2015),  and  it  is  possible 
that  it  is  specifically  linked  to  this  rather  than  more  gener-
ally  linked  to  the  neurotic  spectrum. This  may  also  be  true  of 
alpha asymmetry (Gordon et al., 2010). Alternatively, like alpha 

asymmetry, it may be a characteristic that is linked to depressed 
people  but  not  to  the  depressed  state  itself.  Benzodiazepines, 
such  as  diazepam  and  lorazepam,  often  used  to  treat  anxiety 
disorders but not depressive disorders, increase HFD in healthy 
humans (Chouvarda et al., 2009; Michail et al., 2010). We found 
no  such  effect  with  midazolam  in  the  current  GAD  and  SAD 
patient group.

Our  findings  that  ketamine  rapidly  reduces  power  in  the 
alpha1,  alpha2,  and  particularly  delta  bands  in  GAD  and  SAD 
patients  are  broadly  similar  to  previous  findings  (Hong  et  al., 
2010; de la Salle et al., 2016). However, the observed reduction in 
delta  might  seem  opposite  to  the  previously  reported  increase 
in slow wave sleep activity (Duncan and Zarate, 2013). Given the 
consistent previous reduced waking delta and the very distinct-
ive  EEG  state  occurring  in  deep  slow  wave  sleep,  it  is  possible 
that  sleep  delta  is  functionally  distinct  from  waking  delta. An 
alternative is that the increase in sleep delta (which occurs dur-
ing the first night after dosing) is a rebound from the immediate 
decrease (reported here 2 hours after dosing).

Our increased gamma, unlike our increased beta, is as pre-
dicted.  It  seems  likely  that  the  variations  in  previous  results 
and between our specific findings and our predicted pattern is 
due  to  dose-  and  testing-related  variations  (note  the  decrease 
in gamma at 0.25 mg) but could also be due to our use of a par-
ticular patient population (GAD/SAD) and also our small sample 
number. Other limitations include the lack of a placebo control 
group,  although  there  was  an  active  control  group;  while  we 
obtained  blood  levels  of  drug,  they  were  not  analyzed.  Further 
work with carefully matched healthy controls is required to clar-
ify these points. However, if we take our data at face value, they 
suggest that, at least under some conditions, ketamine produces 
a decrease that is greatest at lower frequencies and an increase 
that is greatest at higher frequencies.

Our  observation  of  reduced  theta  power  is  consistent  with 
some  previous  reports  and  opposite  to  others. There  is  a  sug-
gestion in Figure 2 that the theta decrease is greater at F8 than 
other  sites,  and  so  the  variable  results  reported  in  this  band 
may  depend  on  site  of  recording  (Muthukumaraswamy  et  al., 
2015),  method  of  testing  (Kochs  et  al.,  1996),  and  the  dose  of 
ketamine. Given our inverse-U dose-response curve with the FQ 
and  the  largely  linear  dose-response  for  most  bands  and  elec-
trode  sites,  our  current  data  suggest  that  the  observed  effect 
of  ketamine  most  likely  to  be  related  to  its  therapeutic  effect 
is at right frontal sites, particularly F4. Critically, F4 is the only 
site for which we have clear evidence that changes in the theta 
band  (and  no  other)  relate  to  FQ  changes.  Despite  large  dose-
related changes in power in the delta and gamma bands, there 
was no evidence that these changes were linked to therapeutic 
action  (as  opposed,  say,  to  residual  effects  of  dissociation). 
A much larger sample and much more detailed analysis would 
be needed to confirm these observations.

Our  recently  developed  human  anxiolytic  biomarker 
(McNaughton,  2017),  goal-conflict  rhythmicity,  is  obtained 
in  the  theta  (spreading  to  alpha1)  band  at  right  frontal  sites 
(McNaughton et al., 2013; Shadli et al., 2015). It is possible, there-
fore,  that  the  therapeutic  effects  reported  with  ketamine  here 
reflect an action on the same brain system, which is potentially 
homologous with the rodent theta that is a uniquely reliable test 
of anxiolytic action (McNaughton et al., 2007) and is known to 
be reduced by ketamine (Engin et al., 2009). However, in healthy 
humans and rats, this biomarker has been defined by conven-
tional  anxiolytics  given  in  single,  low,  doses.  In  our  GAD  and 
SAD patients, MDZ had little effect on rhythmicity and no effect 
at all on theta at right frontal sites. This lack of effect could be 

an  explanation  of  the  patients’  resistance  to  such  treatments. 
However, it is just as likely that ketamine in the current experi-
ments is acting on a quite distinct right frontal system, which 
also  requires  theta-frequency  rhythmicity,  to  that  activated  by 
our existing biomarker paradigm

We  have  reported  a  dose-related  effect  of  ketamine  on  rat-
ings  of  anxiety  and  EEG  recordings  in  patients  with  treatment 
refractory  anxiety  disorders.  In  particular,  we  found  that  right 
frontal slow-wave (theta) EEG changes predicted reduced inten-
sity of phobic anxiety ratings. These novel double-blind findings 
in  patients  are  consistent  with  earlier  preclinical  and  human 
data  that  link  diverse  anxiolytic  treatments  with  right  frontal 
EEG  changes,  which  may  represent  a  plausible  biomarker  of 
anxiolytic action.
