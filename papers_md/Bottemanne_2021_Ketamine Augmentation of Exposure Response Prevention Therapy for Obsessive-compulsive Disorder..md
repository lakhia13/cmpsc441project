Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a 
disabling disease characterized by intrusive 
thoughts, with compulsions performed to lessen 
distress. Many patients with OCD do not respond 
to fi rst-line intervention, such as serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and exposure and 
response prevention (ERP) therapy. Previous 
studies have focused on the use of ketamine, 
a nonselective N-methyl D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) antagonist, for treatment-resistant 
OCD. Research has shown that ketamine 
modulates NMDARs and gamma-aminobutyric 
acid receptors (GAMBAR), which are major 
pathways for contingency-learning, belief 
updating, and extinction learning. Here, we 
propose an augmented psychotherapy (AP) 
protocol combining ERP intervention with 
administration of ketamine. We describe 
the theory that NMDAR modulation might 
directly promote the therapeutic mechanisms 
involved in exposure and discuss the possibility 
that ketamine plasticity enhancement might 
potentiate extinction-based psychotherapy in 
the treatment of OCD.

OObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a 

disabling disease characterized by repeated 
intrusive thoughts, with compulsions performed 
to lessen distress associated with obsessions.1
These cognitive and behavioral symptoms are 
associated with a range of aff ective experiences, 
including enhanced negative feelings, anxiety, 
and sadness.2 In this disorder, repeated 
compulsions against stressful obsessions 
paradoxically induce a reinforcement loop of 
obsessions. These symptoms are very diffi  cult 
to treat, and few medical treatments have 
been approved for OCD by the United States 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), drugs that increase 
serotonergic signaling, and exposure and 
response prevention therapy (ERP), a subtype of 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), are considered 
fi rst-line interventions for OCD.1–4 During ERP, 
patients are exposed to obsessive stressors and 
invited to inhibit the compulsive responses 
in an eff ort to break the reinforcement loop. 
The emotional response progressively declines 
through repeated exposure when anxiety is not 
otherwise assuaged by compulsive behavior. In 
randomized, controlled trials, ERP therapy has 
been shown to be as eff ective as medication 
alone and to potentiate the eff ect of SRIs.2,5 Many 
patients with OCD, however, respond partially or 
not at all to these pharmacological and cognitive 
behavioral approaches, leading to the diagnosis 
of treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (TROCD).6

NEW PROSPECTS FOR TREATMENT OF 
TROCD WITH KETAMINE

There has been renewed interest in ketamine, 

a nonselective N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR) modeling glutamatergic signaling, for 
the treatment of TROCD.7 At subanesthetic doses 
(0.5mg/kg, intravenous), ketamine increases 
glutamatergic activity in the prefrontal cortex 
and induces a complex synaptogenesis cascade 
in the brain via mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR), inhibition of eukaryotic elongation factor 
(eEF2) kinase, and brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) synthesis.8 These neurotrophic 
eff ects have been associated with a rapid and 
robust antidepressant eff ect in major depressive 
disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant 
depression (TRD).9,10 Based on these successes in 
mood disorders and on prior reports suggesting 
reduction of symptoms in OCD, ketamine has 
emerged in OCD treatment strategies.11,12

A randomized, controlled trial with inactive 
placebo (saline infusion) demonstrated rapid 
anti-OCD eff ects in patients with persistent 
intrusive thoughts; a single intravenous dose 
of ketamine without SRI resulted in rapid 
clinical improvement, occuring within hours 
to days after treatment. For these patients, 
ketamine administration specifi cally resulted in 
a decrease in obsessions, leading to a secondary 
improvement in compulsions, with persistent 
eff ects at one week after administration.13 
Another open-label study indicated that 
ketamine might temporarily improve symptoms

of TROCD, but the eff ect appeared to wear off  
rapidly after the fi rst administration. In this 
trial, the 10 patients enrolled received a single 
IV infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over a 40 
minute period. A signifi cant and acute response 
was seen in OCD symptoms 1 to 3 hours following 
the administration of ketamine and persisted 
for 1 to 3 days according to the Yale-Brown 
Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), but results 
did not appear to persist after the acute eff ects 
of ketamine.14 These reports suggest potential 
rapid antiobsessional eff ects of ketamine in OCD, 
but also a lack of extended therapeutic response 
when used alone. 

From pharmacotherapy to augmented 
psychotherapy with ketamine. Augmented 
psychotherapy (AP), an emerging and promising 
fi eld in neuroscience, could extend and prolong 
the eff ects of ketamine.15 These translational 
techniques propose the use of pharmacotherapy 
to enhance the eff ects of psychotherapy, 
or psychotherapy to enhance the eff ects of 
pharmacotherapy.16–20 AP mainly focuses on 
synergic mechanic pathways between chemically 
induced brain plasticity and cognitive behavioral 
modulation by combining CBT techniques, such as 
metacognition, thought distancing, or positive-
appraisal reinforcement, with molecules, such as 
ketamine, D-cycloserine, or even neurosteroid.16–
20An open-label trial in which participants with 
OCD received a single ketamine infusion followed 
by 10 one-hour ERP sessions delivered over two 
weeks reported additional benefi ts from adding 
ketamine to ERP therapy.21 Other reports suggest 
that repeated intranasal ketamine combined with 
ERP promotes therapeutic eff ect.12 Interestingly, 
improvements in OCD symptoms were seen prior 
to ketamine administration after two weeks of 
CBT, but ketamine signifi cantly reinforced these 
prior improvements and patient adherence with 
ERP techniques.12 However, these studies focused 
on the eff ect of ERP after ketamine treatment, 
not during acute administration of ketamine. 
Both approaches were used together but were 
not combined synergistically and did not measure 
the specifi c eff ects of ketamine during the 
infusion.12,21

Enhancing the eff ect of ERP 

psychotherapies with ketamine. Ketamine 
induces neurocognitive eff ects that might 
potentiate ERP.22 Subanesthetic intravenous 
and intranasal forms of ketamine can produce 
an altered state of consciousness (ASC), such 
as derealization and depersonalization and the 

feeling of world- and self-unreality.23 These 
symptoms dissipated within a few minutes after 
infusion and from 60 to 120 minutes following 
intranasal administration. These sensory and 
cognitive experiences have been associated with 
feelings of thought dissolution, as if judgments 
and mental frame were suppressed.24 Previous 
reports on OCD observed a rapid obsessional 
thought-dissolving eff ect of ketamine during 
infusion, persisting from 1 to 7 days post-
administration.11 These thought-dissolving 
eff ects could potentially be used during ERP, 
particularly for the response prevention phase 
after the exposure. Moreover, classic ERP has been 
shown to be less eff ective for certain obsessive 
themes, such as moral or taboo thoughts, than 
for other obsessions, such as contamination, 
doubts, symmetry, or ordering. The intolerability 
of moral or taboo thoughts might make the 
confrontation by the patient more diffi  cult.25 For 
these obsessive themes, the reinforcement loop 
mainly involves negative emotions and relatively 
few compulsions. The thought-dissolving eff ect 
of ketamine might assist the patient in breaking 
the reinforcement loop between obsession and 
emotion.

Promoting extinction learning process 

during ERP protocols with ketamine.
The use of ketamine has been associated 
with positive eff ects on learning and belief 
updating.26 Studies have shown that ketamine 
modulates NMDARs and gamma-aminobutyric 
acid receptors (GABARs) in the amygdala and 
prefrontal cortex, two major mediators of 
glutamate signaling underlying fear extinction 
processes and memory reconsolidation.27,28 
These results suggest that ketamine facilitated 
the fear memory extinction via glutamatergic 
presynaptic-mediated plasticity, which may 
provide new perspectives for treatment of OCD. 
Fear conditioning is an active learning process 
during which a neutral stimulus is paired with 
an aversive, distressing, unconditioned stimulus. 
During this process, neutral stimulus becomes 
itself stressful by association. In turn, the brain 
assumes an adaptive learning process leading 
to fear extinction through repeated exposure 
to the stressful stimulus. Research has shown 
that fear extinction is impaired in patients 
with OCD and substituted with compensatory 
compulsive behavior to mitigate distress. For 
these patients, the compulsion reduces fear, and 
the physiological mechanism of fear extinction is 
no longer used.29

ERP is an extinction-based psychotherapy. The 

objective of ERP is the restoration of extinction 
learning through repeated exposure without 
engagement in compensatory behaviors (e.g., 
avoidance or compulsion) and the absence of 
a stressful outcome. Clinical and biochemical 
insights suggest that ketamine’s modulation 
of NMDAR and GABAR signaling might directly 
enhance fear extinction and promote ERP 
therapeutic mechanisms. The ketamine-induced 
fear extinction process could potentially be used 
during the response prevention phase, defusing 
the reinforcement loop between stressful 
obsessions and compensatory compulsions. 
These ketamine extinction learning eff ects 
have been recognized as a promising strategy 
toward desensitization in patients suff ering 
from addiction and posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD).27,30 In PTSD, ketamine could help repair 
poor fear extinction mechanisms (associated 
with traumatic memory), and might enhance 
the effi  cacy of psychotherapeutic interventions 
harnessing ketamine-induced neuroplasticity.31
In addiction, these synaptic plasticity modulation 
mechanisms could be used to modify the self-
reinforcing cortical loops of addictive behaviors, 
by promoting the learning of new behavioral 
alternatives.32

AP with ERP and ketamine in OCD. Based 

on the preliminary data, we propose an AP 
protocol synergistically combining acute ketamine 
administration with ERP in the treatment of OCD. 
Specifi cally, we propose to combine the plasticity-
enhancing and fear-extinguishing eff ects of 
ketamine administration with ERP. During this 
protocol, clinicians would administer intravenous 
ketamine at a subanesthetic dosage (0.5mg/
kg) over 40 minutes, or intranasal esketamine 
(28–86mg) according to current clinical 
recommendations in MDD and TRD.9 At ketamine 
administration onset, the clinician would 
induce physical or virtual exposure to stimuli 
associated with obsessional thoughts and engage 
the patient with ERP protocol with response 
prevention.5 Repeated exposure and response 
prevention should be continued until the patient 
feels the psychodysleptic eff ects of ketamine 
(ACS, derealization, and depersonalization). The 
peak of these eff ects occurs 30 to 40 minutes 
after intravenous administration and at variable 
times following intranasal administration. 
After the peak, exposure can be decreased and 
then stopped when the patient no longer feels 
psychodysleptic eff ects. OCD symptomatology

should be assessed using YBOCS before and 
after ketamine administration.33 In addition to 
the benefi ts of combining ERP and classic CBT, 
a conventional approach such as metacognitive 
therapy (MCT) could be implemented over the 
following days to improve clinical outcomes.34
Limitations. Little data are available 
regarding the tolerance of ketamine in the 
treatment of OCD. Previous studies have 
suggested that ketamine’s eff ects on memory 
reconsolidation and information processing result 
in long-lasting impairment of belief updating, 
favoring delusional processes.35 The disruption 
of belief update mechanisms by ketamine could 
result in the emergence of aberrant, distorted 
beliefs.56 This eff ect has been used to provide 
pharmacological models of psychotic disorder.35
Diff erentiating between obsessions and delusions 
can be diffi  cult; thus, ketamine protocols should 
be used with caution in cases of OCD with 
psychotic features. Moreover, derealization 
and depersonalization during ketamine 
administration might increase anxiety in some 
patients.24 This paradoxical eff ect, in which 
patients exhibit exceptionally high sensitivity 
to anxiety and fail to acclimate to their anxiety, 
could worsen the response to ERP therapies.36
This possible eff ect should be considered 
during ketamine-augmented ERP and carefully 
monitored to prevent worsening the patient’s 
clinical condition.

CONCLUSION

We propose that the thought-dissolution 
and extinction-learning eff ects observed during 
acute ketamine administration could potentially 
promote response to ERP therapy in the 
treatment of OCD. Moreover, ketamine enhanced-
neuroplasticity (via mTOR, eEF2 kinase inhibition, 
and BDNF synthesis) might potentiate cognitive 
and behavioral relearning, improving long-term 
clinical outcomes in OCD.21 This ketamine-assisted 
psychotherapy may be a useful tool to identify 
OCD pathophysiological impairment and develop 
more eff ective treatment strategies with faster 
onset of action. Additional research in larger 
groups of patients is needed to evaluate the 
effi  cacy, safety, and computational mechanisms 
for these novel translational treatment 
approaches using ketamine.
