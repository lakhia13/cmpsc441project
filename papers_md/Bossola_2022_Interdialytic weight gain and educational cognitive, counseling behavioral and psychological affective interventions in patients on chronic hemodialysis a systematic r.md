Abstract
Background  This work aimed to shed light on the notorious debate over the role of an educational/cognitive/behavioral or 
psychological approach in the reduction of interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
Methods  Searches were run from 1975 to January 2022 on Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. 
The search terms included “hemodialysis/haemodialysis” AND “adherence” AND (“fluid intake” OR “water intake”) AND 
(“weight gain” OR “interdialytic weight gain” OR “IDWG”) AND “patient-level interventions. Randomized controlled stud-
ies were eligible if they were in English, published in a peer-reviewed journal and regarded adults patients with on chronic 
hemodialysis for at least 6 months; compared educational/cognitive and/or counseling/behavioral or psychological inter-
ventions to no intervention on interdialytic weight gain. Outcome of interest was interdialytic weight gain. The review was 
registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews in Health and Social Care (PROSPERO, ID 
number CRD42022332401).
Results  Eighteen studies (1759 patients) were included in the analysis. Compared to the untreated group, educational/
cognitive and/or counseling/behavioral interventions significantly reduced interdialytic weight gain with a pooled mean dif-
ference of − 0.15 kg (95% CI − 0.26, 30–0.05; P = 0.004). On the other hand, psychological/affective interventions reduced 
interdialytic weight gain with a pooled mean difference of − 0.26 kg (95% CI − 0.48, − 0.04; P = 0.020).
Conclusions  Educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral or psychological/affective interventions significantly reduced 
the interdialytic weight gain in patients on chronic hemodialysis, although such reduction did not appear to be clinically 
relevant on hard outcomes.

Introduction

Interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) should be lower than 4.0 
to 4.5% of dry weight [1]. Unfortunately, many patients have 
an IDWG higher than this value [2, 3]. High IDWG is associ-
ated with greater risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortal-
ity and increased morbidity, such as ventricular hypertrophy 
and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events [2, 
4–7]. In addition, it leads to supplementary dialysis sessions 
with consequent reduction of the quality of life and a signifi-
cant increase in costs.

High IDWG is essentially due to an excessive intake of 
fluids and/or foods. Non-adherence to both diet and fluid 
restrictions is very frequent, exceeding 60% of evaluations 
[8]. Numerous factors have been shown to determine failure

to adherence to diet and fluid restrictions [9–18]. Among 
these, an important role is played by loss of motivation and 
lack of self-assessment, defined as the inability to correctly 
define fluid status and salt and fluid intakes [9–18].

In  routine  clinical  practice,  improving  adherence  to 
restricted fluid intake in patients on chronic hemodialysis 
is difficult [19, 20]. Among the various strategies that have 
been attempted to increase adherence to fluid restriction in 
chronic hemodialysis patients, particular attention has been 
paid to patient-level interventions that have been categorized 
according to De Bleser et al. [21] as educational/cognitive 
(which conveys information or knowledge, individually or 
in a group setting, and delivers it in a verbal, written, and/
or audio-visual form), counseling/behavioral (which targets, 
shapes and/or reinforces behavior, empowers patients to 
participate in their care, positively changes a patient’s skill 
level or normal routine), and psychological/affective (which 
appeals to the feelings and emotions or social relationships 
and social supports of the patient).

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to 
evaluate the efficacy of different categories of patient-level 
interventions in an effort to improve adherence and to limit 
IDWG in patients on chronic hemodialysis.

According  to  PICOS  criteria,  we  analyzed:  Popula-
tion = end-stage renal disease patients on chronic hemo-
dialysis;  Intervention:  educational/cognitive/behavioral 
treatment; psychological treatment Comparison = no inter-
vention; Outcome = IDWG; Study = systematic review and 
meta-analysis. The primary outcome of the review is to 
determine the difference between educational/cognitive or 
counseling/behavioral or psychological/affective interven-
tions and no interventions in IDGW.

Methods

This  analysis  was  prospectively  registered  on  the  Inter-
national  Prospective  Register  of  Systematic  Reviews 
in  Health  and  Social  Care  (PROSPERO,  ID  number 
CRD42022332401).

Search strategy

Searches were run from 1975 to January 2022. The following 
databases were searched for relevant studies: Medline, Pub-
Med, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The search 
terms and mesh headings included “hemodialysis/haemodi-
alysis” AND “adherence” AND (“fluid intake” OR “water 
intake”) AND (“weight gain” OR “interdialytic weight gain” 
OR  “IDWG”)  AND  “patient-level  interventions”  as  the 
search terms. This review followed the Preferred Reporting 

Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 
reporting guideline.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were English 
language papers published in a peer-reviewed journal and 
met the following inclusion criteria: (1) primary research 
studies in adult patients (over 18 years of age), (2) patients 
with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis for at 
least 6 months; (3) compared educational/cognitive and/or 
counseling/behavioral interventions to no interventions in 
terms of intradialytic weight gain; (4) compared psycho-
logical interventions to no interventions in terms of inter-
dialytic weight gain; (5) included interdialytic weight gain 
as one of the outcomes of interest. We excluded studies on 
pediatric patients, pre-dialysis CKD patients, acute kidney 
injury patients, ESRD patients with other renal replace-
ment therapy modalities such as peritoneal dialysis, and 
transplantation.

Data extraction

Two authors (MA and GP) independently reviewed the 
manuscripts considering the eligibility criteria and qual-
ity assessment tools. Two authors (M.B. and G.P.) inde-
pendently reviewed titles and abstracts, and full texts of 
potential studies were retrieved for further appraisal. In 
case  of  disagreement  between  the  two  authors,  a  third 
author (EDS) was consulted. We also performed a manual 
search for eligible studies by checking the reference lists of 
relevant original and review articles. Conference abstracts 
and literature reviews were excluded. Similarly, studies 
not comparing standard/low sodium dialysate concentra-
tion were excluded. Any discrepancies were resolved by 
consensus upon discussion with another co-author (EDS). 
A data extraction table (Table 1) was compiled to record 
study characteristics and participant characteristics.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical 
Package for Social Science (SPSS 22.0; SPSS Inc, Chi-
cago, IL, United States) and Microsoft Excel. The pri-
mary outcome of the review is to determine the difference 
between educational/cognitive or counseling/behavioral or 
psychological/affective interventions and no interventions 
in the IDGW (mean difference); each meta-analysis (For-
est plot) was built using studies enrolling one of the two 
therapeutic approaches compared to untreated subjects, 
and the mean difference (random effect), weight of the

 I2 and Z and p for overall effect) are reported. Statistical 
heterogeneity among studies was quantified with Higgins 
I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed graphically using 
funnel plots.

Results

Search results

A total of 320 publications were identified via electronic data-
bases. After screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, 18 stud-
ies meeting the inclusion criteria were included for analysis. 
The PRISMA flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. All studies were 
randomized and controlled. We divided the analysis into two 
sections: (1) Comparison of educational/cognitive/counseling/
behavioral interventions versus no intervention, in terms of 
IDWG (12 studies); (2) Comparison of psychological/affec-
tive interventions versus no intervention in terms of IDWG 
(6 studies).

Study characteristics

Educational/cognitive interventions and/or counseling/
behavioral interventions

Overall, 1187 patients were included. The number of patients 
in each individual study ranged from 20 to 316. The length of 
the studies ranged from 3 weeks to 9 months and a description 
is presented in Table 1 [27–38]. In the majority of studies, 
educational/cognitive interventions were performed in com-
bination with counseling/behavioral interventions [30–33, 
35, 36, 38], whereas in four studies, counseling/behavioral 
interventions were delivered [27–29, 34] as the sole strategy. 
Moreover, educational/cognitive and counseling/behavioral 
interventions were generally performed through an individual 
format, except in two studies where a group format was used 
[32, 37].

Psychological/affective interventions

Overall, 572 patients were included. The number of patients 
in each individual study ranged from 67 to 119. The length of 
studies ranged from 5 weeks to 12 months and a description is 
presented in Table 2 [39–44]. In most studies, psychological/
affective interventions were performed through an individual 
format, except in one study where a group format was used 
[42].

Efficacy of interventions on IDWG

Educational/cognitive interventions and/or counseling/
behavioral interventions

Nine of the 12 studies comparing educational/cognitive 
interventions and/or counseling/behavioral interventions to 
no intervention were included in the meta-analysis.

As shown in Fig. 2, compared to no intervention, educa-
tional/cognitive/counseling/behavioral interventions reduced 
IDWG, with a pooled mean difference (MD) of − 0.15 kg 

(95% CI − 0.26, − 0.05; P = 0.004). As no significant hetero-
geneity was observed  (Chi2 = 15.06; I2 = 47%; P = 0.06), the 
pooled analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model.

Three studies were not included in the meta-analysis 
because IDWG was not expressed as mean (SD) differ-
ence between pre- and post-treatment values [10, 28, 38]. 
In the study by Tanner et al., the number of sessions with 
acceptable IDWG was similar in the two groups [28]. In 
the study by Christensen et al., mean IDWG increased in 
controls (from 3.12 to 3.3 kg) and decreased in treated 
patients  (from  3.12  to  2.9  kg),  but  the  difference  was

Four  of  the  6  studies  comparing  psychological/affec-

Psychological/affective interventions

As shown in Fig. 3, compared to no intervention, psycho-
logical/affective interventions reduced IDWG with a pooled

Journal of Nephrology (2022) 35:1973–1983

MD of − 0.26 kg (95% CI − 0.48, − 0.04; P = 0.002). As 
no  significant  heterogeneity  was  observed   (Chi2 = 5.84; 
I2 = 49%; P = 0.12), the pooled analysis was performed using 
a fixed-effect model.

Two  studies  were  not  included  in  the  meta-analysis 
because  IDWG  was  not  expressed  as  mean  (SD)  differ-
ence between pre- and post-treatment values [21,  44]. In 
the study by Bellomo et al., IDWG changed from base-
line to 6 months; in controls it ranged from 1.31 ± 0.33 
to 1.32 ± 0.32 kg (P = 0.57) and in the treatment group it 
decreased  from  1.33 ± 0.33  to  1.2 ± 0.28  kg  (P < 0.001) 

[41]. In the study by Valsaray et al., the IDWG changed 
from baseline to 6 months; in controls it went from 4.3 ± 0.7 
to 4.6 ± 0.4 kg (P  = 0.856) and in the treatment group it 
dropped from 4.4 ± 0.9 to 3.2 ± 0.6 kg (P = 0.001) [44].

Publication bias

Funnel plots were generated to assess publication bias in the 
included studies. No obvious asymmetry, which indicated no 
clear evidence of publication bias, was observed either in the 
studies comparing educational/cognitive interventions and/

or counseling/behavioral interventions to no intervention 
(Fig. 4) or in the studies comparing psychological/affective 
interventions to no interventions (Fig. 5).

Discussion

The meta-analysis of 9 and 4 randomized studies shows 
that educational/cognitive interventions and/or counseling/
behavioral interventions or psychological/affective interven-
tions are both effective in significantly reducing IDWG in 
patients on chronic hemodialysis; the pooled mean differ-
ence of IDWG was reduced by − 0.15 and − 0.26 kg, respec-
tively. In addition, the review of studies not included in the 
meta-analysis reveals conflicting results in both treatment 
approaches.

The results of the present meta-analysis are in agreement 
with the recent work by Murali et al. in which IDWG was 
significantly reduced as the effect of patient-level or health 
system-related interventions, with a pooled IDWG reduction 
of − 0.20 [− 0.32 to − 0.081]; it is important to note that in 
Murali’s study, patient-level interventions were considered 
as an individual entity, without distinguishing among educa-
tional/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, and psychological/
affective interventions [46].

However, it could be questioned whether such differences 
in weight actually reflect a clinically relevant effect. Interest-
ingly, other interventions have led to better results in terms 
of reduction of IDWG. In fact, a recent systematic review 
and meta-analysis showed that the use of a low dialysate 
sodium concentration significantly reduced the IDWG in 
prevalent patients on chronic hemodialysis, with a pooled 
mean difference of − 0.42 kg (P < 0.00001) [47]. In addition, 
the large study by Marshall et al. showed that the use of low 
dialysate sodium concentration led to a sustained decrease in 
IDWG (− 0.56 kg and − 0.61% of pre-dialysis body weight) 
accompanied by an early decrease in extracellular fluid vol-
ume [48]. Interestingly, during a 10-year period, between 
2004 and 2014, in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Pat-
terns Study (DOPPS) [2], both absolute and relative IDWG 
decline were − 0.29 kg and − 0.5% of post-HD weight in 
the United States, − 0.25 kg and − 0.8% of post-HD weight 
in Canada, and − 0.22 kg and − 0.5% of post-HD weight in 
Europe, respectively. The DOPPS study also demonstrated 
that the dialysate sodium concentration accounted for 0.13 
greater relative IDWG per 1-mEq/L greater dialysate sodium 
concentration, suggesting that it played a relatively impor-
tant role in explaining the decline in IDWG [48].

Low dialysate sodium concentration results in greater 
diffusive sodium removal during dialysis with consequent 
lower total body sodium content by the end of treatment, 
which might therefore lessen thirst and water intake in the 
interdialytic period. This in turn might reduce extracellular 

fluid overload, hypertension, and ultimately, left ventricu-
lar hypertrophy and CV death. In daily clinical practice, 
dialysate sodium concentration may be fixed (low or high) 
or variable (individualized). High dialysate sodium con-
centrations provide hemodynamic benefits and prevent 
hypotensive episodes, but reduce the loss of sodium and 
consequently,  thirst  is  stimulated  and  the  weight  gain 
increases. However, it should be kept in mind that the 
use of a low dialysate sodium concentration may be in 
some cases associated with adverse events such as mus-
cle cramps and intra-dialytic or post-dialytic hypotension, 
which are the result of intradialytic hemodynamic instabil-
ity [2]. Thus, the final decision to adopt a low dialysate 
sodium concentration depends on the clinical evaluation 
and assessment of costs and benefits.

Patient-level interventions are expensive, time consuming 
and require the not always achievable cooperation of patients 
[20, 21, 27, 28]. Educational/cognitive, counseling/behav-
ioral or psychological/affective interventions often need 
multiple sessions over time [20, 21]. Educational/cognitive 
interventions require videos, posters, and presentations to 
improve patient education. In addition, the educational con-
tent of such interventions is complex and includes informa-
tion about the nature of the renal disease and the conse-
quences of renal insufficiency, the physiology of thirst, and 
the consequences of high salt and excessive fluid intake [20, 
21]. Finally, the acquisition of knowledge is not necessarily 
associated with behavioral changes. Counseling/behavioral 
interventions require continuous reinforcements, directly or 
via phone call, regular feed-back and contacts at home [20, 
21, 29–32]. Often, once adherence has been achieved, there 
is a risk of recurrence of non-adherence [20, 21, 27–32]. 
Psychological/affective interventions are based on the inter-
vention of a psychologist. Unfortunately, this action is not 
available in many hemodialysis units.

Finally, it is unclear whether patient-level interventions 
need to be continued at length in order to have a clinically 
meaningful effect [27–42]. Indeed, the duration of the stud-
ies included in the present review ranged between 3 weeks 
and 12 months. In addition, it remains unknown if the reduc-
tion of IDWG persists after the interruption of the patient-
level interventions. In fact, none of the studies reported the 
long-term impact of patient-level interventions after their 
cessation. This is a key point that needs to be clarified by 
adequate, randomized, controlled studies in the near future.
In light of these considerations, and of the clinically irrel-
evant IDWG reduction, the role of patient-level interven-
tions aimed at reducing weight gain in patients on chronic 
hemodialysis  should  be  questioned.  The  issue  remains 
whether, it is worth continuing these interventions in routine 
clinical practice in an attempt to limit IDWG in patients on 
chronic hemodialysis. Overall, it seems that further, large, 

1 31982

randomized  controlled  studies  are  warranted  to  reach  a 
definitive result.

However, the present review highlights some interesting 
observations. It focuses on fluid adherence, a fundamental 
aspect of patients on chronic hemodialysis, as measured by 
IDWG, and considers only patient-level interventions cat-
egorized as educational/cognitive/counseling/behavioral 
interventions and psychological/affective interventions.

The present review has some limitations. First, the sample 
size of many of the included trials was small. Second, the 
length of the studies was extremely varied and short, ranging 
from one month to twelve months. Third, the residual urine 
volume was not reported in all studies. Finally, data col-
lected from the literature could be affected by some biases 
(different operators, substantially non-numerable param-
eters, other national health systems).

In conclusion, the present meta-analysis shows that edu-
cational/cognitive interventions and/or counseling/behavio-
ral interventions or psychological/affective interventions are 
effective in reducing IDWG in patients on chronic hemodial-
ysis. However, the absolute IDWG reduction associated with 
these interventions seems to be of limited relevance in the 
clinical setting. Thus, more studies are warranted to improve 
the efficacy of educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral 
or psychological/affective interventions in reducing IDWG.
