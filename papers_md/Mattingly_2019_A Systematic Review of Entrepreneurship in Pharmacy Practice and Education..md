Submitted June 22, 2018; accepted August 20, 2018; published April 2019.

Objective. To review literature pertaining to entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice, education, and the
knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) identiﬁed for pharmacist entrepreneurs.
Findings. In terms of pharmacy practice, entrepreneurship was most frequently identiﬁed with innova-
tion and creativity to develop new opportunities for pharmacists. The most frequent role for entrepreneur-
ship in pharmacy education was related to schools putting a greater emphasis on innovation, creativity, or
divergent thinking. Risk-taking and creativity/innovation were the most frequently identiﬁed KSAs, with
17 (63.0%) manuscripts mentioning these as important for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Other KSAs
pertaining to pharmacy entrepreneurship that were mentioned in the articles included self-starter,
management, proactivity, communication, strategic planning, positivity, decision-making, teamwork,
versatility, marketing, critical thinking, competitiveness, proposal development, numeracy, technology,
self-reﬂection, persistence, social responsibility, and cultural competence.
Summary. No consensus for entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice or education currently exists. In
order to improve instructional design and assessment for pharmacy entrepreneurship education, a core set
of KSAs for a pharmacist entrepreneur construct must be identiﬁed. The most commonly cited KSAs in
related literature that are not already part of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education standards
include risk-taking, strategic planning, marketing, competitiveness, and social responsibility. These may
serve as a starting point for enhancing pharmacy curricula to embrace pharmacist entrepreneurship.

INTRODUCTION

Entrepreneurial outcomes in education refer to new
venture development, business start-ups, and job creation
contributing to economic growth and development.1
More broadly, entrepreneurship can be deﬁned as identi-
fying or creating new opportunities within uncertain en-
vironments.2 Business school experts have debated about
whether entrepreneurship should be considered a con-
struct for the classroom, or whether real-world experience
is more appropriate as a delivery method for this type of
education.2,3

Within pharmacy education, entrepreneurship has
been identified as a key factor driving innovation in phar-
macy practice. To guide the Academy in this area, the
Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education
(CAPE) included entrepreneurship within domains in
2013. This action influenced the Accreditation Council

for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) to include entrepreneur-
ship within the standards used to evaluate professional
pharmacy programs in 2016.4,5 The 2010-2011 American
Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Academic
Affairs Standing Committee identiﬁed entrepreneurship
as an affective domain trait, thereby enabling students to
develop sustainable practice models.6 The Committee
suggested using Rubino and Freshman’s entrepreneur-
ship competency clusters (decision making, strategic
thinking, risk taking, conﬁdence building, communicat-
ing ideas, motivating team members, tolerance of ambi-
guity, and internal
locus of control) as a potential
framework for developing a pharmacy entrepreneur.6,7
Many schools have developed educational programs to
address entrepreneurship in pharmacy. In addition to the
lectures taught
in traditional pharmacy management
courses, multiple schools now offer certiﬁcate programs
or entrepreneurial tracks where students are able to com-
plete additional coursework that identify with entrepre-
neurship in a pharmacy context.8-11 In March 2017, the

University of Maryland School of Pharmacy trademarked
the term “pharmapreneurism” to describe the process by
which pharmacy entrepreneurs achieve their career aspi-
rations by addressing the nation’s health care, research,
policy, and societal needs through leadership, and inno-
vation.12

The efforts of many pharmacy organizations and ed-
ucational institutions seem to reflect a desire to develop an
entrepreneurial ecosystem, ie, an environment that sup-
ports the development and growth of new ventures
through social, political, economic, and cultural elements,
for the profession of pharmacy.13,14 While the importance
of entrepreneurism in pharmacy has been stressed, an
appropriate role for innovation and entrepreneurship
within pharmacy practice and education, along with an
agreed upon set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes
(KSAs) for a pharmacist entrepreneur, have not been
identiﬁed. The objective of this review was to identify
and describe the role of entrepreneurship within phar-
macy practice, the role schools and colleges of pharmacy
play in developing pharmacist entrepreneurs, and the
KSAs that should be incorporated in a pharmacist entre-
preneur construct.

METHODS

A literature review was conducted using the SCOPUS,
EMBASE, and PubMed databases in accordance with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.15 The following
search strategy was used: [ALL (entrepren*) OR ALL
(capitalis*) OR ALL (“academic capitalism”) AND ALL
(“college of pharmacy”) OR ALL (“pharmacy school”)
OR ALL (“pharmacy education”)]. No date restrictions
or study types were imposed on the database searches.
After removal of duplicates, two reviewers participated
in screening all abstracts independently for relevance to
pharmacy education and entrepreneurship. An a priori
screening discrepancy threshold between the independent
reviewers was set at 20% to indicate the need for a full
second screening. All discrepancies were discussed until
consensus for inclusion for full-text review was reached.
Full-text articles were retrieved and further assessed for
eligibility based on the relevance of the study objectives
to identify the role of entrepreneurship in practice, educa-
tion, and mention of potential KSAs of entrepreneurs.

Data extraction and synthesis included citation de-
tails (authors, article title, journal title, year published),
study type, the roles of entrepreneurism in pharmacy and
pharmacy education, and the KSAs of an entrepreneur
that were identified. A narrative review of study types,
roles, and KSAs was conducted to identify themes based
on frequencies (number of sources found) for each.

RESULTS

In the initial search, 483 articles were identified. Af-
ter removal of duplicates, 404 unique abstracts were iden-
tified for screening. The independent reviewer abstract
screening process resulted in a 91% initial agreement on
which abstracts to include in the study. The two reviewers
then discussed points of disagreement until full agree-
ment was reached. After the application of inclusion
criteria during the abstract screening and full-text assess-
ment of eligibility stages, 27 articles were included for
analysis (Figure 1).4,6,24-33,16,34-40,17-23

The types of papers included in the study were sur-
veys (10 [37.0%]),
instructional design manuscripts
(6 [22.2%]), commentaries (5 [18.5%], qualitative inter-
views (4 [14.8%]), and committee reports (2 [7.4%].
Years of publication ranged from 1999 to 2017, with 20
(74.1%) of the 27 articles published in a pharmacy-
specific, peer-reviewed journal.

The most frequent roles for entrepreneurship in both
pharmacy practice and pharmacy education are described
in Table 1. In terms of pharmacy practice, entrepreneur-
ship was most frequently associated with innovation and
creativity to develop new opportunities for pharmacists.
Subsequently, the most frequent role for entrepreneurship
in pharmacy education related to schools putting a greater
emphasis on innovation, creativity, or divergent thinking.
Additional roles identiﬁed in the literature for entrepre-
neurship in pharmacy practice included service devel-
opment, problem-solving, beneﬁting society, service
promotion, risk-taking, proactivity, service implemen-
tation, job satisfaction, and evaluating sustainability.
Additional
roles for entrepreneurship in pharmacy
education include application, business management,
emphasizing proactivity, problem-solving, no role iden-
tiﬁed, cultivation, teaching versatility, better communi-
cation, self-reﬂection, identiﬁcation, ownership training,
and continuing education.

Table 2 summarizes and describes the most fre-
quent entrepreneurial KSAs identiﬁed. Risk-taking and
creativity/innovation were the most frequently identiﬁed
with 17 (63.0%) different manuscripts mentioning these
as important KSAs for a pharmacist entrepreneur. Other
KSAs themes identiﬁed include self-starter, management,
proactivity, communication, strategic planning, positiv-
ity, decision-making, teamwork, versatility, marketing,
critical thinking, competitiveness, proposal development,
numeracy, technology, self-reﬂection, persistence, social
responsibility, and cultural competence.

DISCUSSION

The concept of entrepreneurship in pharmacy educa-
tion in the literature generally reflects that in the broader

274

Figure 1. Flow Diagram in Accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: The
PRISMA Statement15

business literature in the sense that entrepreneurs seek to
innovate and create opportunities amid an environment of
uncertainty.2,13 Lupkin and Dess describe the act of
launching a new venture as essential to entrepreneurship,
including entering a new or existing market with new or
existing goods or services.41 Research involving the appli-
cation of entrepreneurial orientation theory in the context
of advancing pharmacy practice appeared between 1999
and 2012, with ﬁve different studies by a similar set of
authors. Aside from that, however, there has been little
consistency in the methodological approach to understand-
ing entrepreneurship in pharmacy.30,33,35,36,40-42 Articles
addressing entrepreneurship in pharmacy predominantly
focus on the development and implementation of an in-
novative service without specifying a ﬁnal outcome of the
new venture. The recommended outcome identiﬁed by
CAPE, “engaging in innovative activities by using creating
thinking to envision better ways of accomplishing profes-
sional goals,” may be limited in that it fails to evaluate
whether pharmacy-led entrepreneurship education actu-
ally increases new pharmacist-led ventures.4

Strategy and Decision-Making

Strategic planning4,6,18,25,27,28,32,39 and decision-
making4,6,18,24,25,27,31 appeared frequently as key areas
for pharmacist entrepreneurs. The ﬁeld of strategic

management frequently overlaps with entrepreneurship,
revolving around assessing and evaluating market oppor-
tunities.41 Shahiwala describes the use of a strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis
to help students determine the feasibility of a new phar-
macy business.18 The SWOT analysis is widely used
and provides a simple framework to get new students
engaged in business planning. In terms of decision-
making, most articles refer to establishing priorities and
allocating resources effectively. Strategic planning was
typically a component of decision-making in the studies
we reviewed, but none of the studies directly assessed
whether effective strategic planning improved decision-
making for the pharmacist entrepreneur. This may be a
potential area for instructional design, ie, to test whether
students exposed to more robust strategy education
achieved better outcomes, or in lay terms, made the right
business decision.

Critical Thinking

Critical-thinking or problem-solving skills were
cited frequently as components of pharmacy entrepre-
neurship.6,16,24,26,27 Multiple validated critical-thinking
instruments have been studied in pharmacy education.
These articles describe the implementation process and
study design challenges, which varied depending on

of future pharmacy entrepreneurs, but no direct link has
been demonstrated between pharmacy students’ perfor-
mance on critical thinking assessments and long-term en-
trepreneurial outcomes.

Core Business Management

The pharmacy education literature puts a greater em-
phasis on KSAs typically identified with traditional man-
agement roles (operations, workflow, human resources
management, accounting, resource management, etc)
than do other entrepreneurial frameworks.* Expanding
business management education for pharmacists may
have many indirect beneﬁts pertaining to previously iden-
tiﬁed entrepreneurial competency clusters.7 For example,
greater understanding of ﬁnancial statements may allow
for better communication with a hired accountant or im-
prove student conﬁdence when evaluating ﬁnancial
decisions. Whether meeting traditional business manage-
ment competencies improves pharmacy students’ will-
ingness or ability to start new business ventures remains
to be seen. Many schools allow students to pursue the
Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) and masters of business
administration (MBA) degrees concurrently. Future in-
vestigations may want to consider how the combination
PharmD/MBA inﬂuences entrepreneurial activities.

An Entrepreneurial Attitude

Multiple articles referred to entrepreneurship con-
structs as reflecting an attitude or orientation rather than
a knowledge base or skill. The pharmacist entrepreneur
could be summarized as a proactive, confident self-starter
with a positive disposition who is willing to take risks and
compete. An entrepreneur’s attitude towards uncertainty
seems to be a deﬁning feature in many of the articles in-
cluded in this review. Cain describes risk aversion as a
barrier to creativity and employs methods that challenge
students to take “intellectual risks” that encourage crea-
tive thinking.19 Conﬁdence was a reoccurring attitude in
the pharmacy entrepreneurship literature, which coin-
cides with entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy research that ar-
gues conﬁdence as a distinguishing feature between
entrepreneurs and managers.46 Additionally, domains
within the Lumpkin and Dess model of entrepreneurial
orientation (risk-taking, innovativeness, proactiveness,
autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness) were used
in multiple pharmacy-speciﬁc surveys, demonstrating a
potential framework that could be further developed for
application to pharmacy education.30,35,36,40,41

Application to the Real World

The use of active-learning or problem-based approaches
to teach pharmacist entrepreneurship in a real-world setting
was frequently identified in the articles we reviewed as
an important instructional method.4,16,18,24–27,34 This sup-
ports the subjectivist theory of entrepreneurship, which

* References 6,21,45,23,24,26,27,29,32,37,39

suggests one’s experience in business settings is fundamen-
tally important to the process of discovery and creativity.47
However, the extent to which active learning while in phar-
macy school can replace real-world entrepreneurial expe-
rience may determine the overall pedagogical efﬁcacy of
the construct.

Recommendations for ACPE Standards

The 2013 CAPE Outcomes served as the framework
for the 2016 Standards published for pharmacy school ac-
creditation. Many of the most frequently cited KSAs are
incorporated directly and indirectly within the ACPE Stan-
dards and Guidance documents, suggesting that many
schools may already be at least partially preparing graduates
to become pharmacist entrepreneurs.4,5,48 The KSAs that do
not clearly map to existing ACPE Standards are risk-taking,
strategic planning, marketing, competitiveness, and social
responsibility. As the Association considers updates to the
Standards, engaging successful entrepreneurs and experts
in entrepreneurial education in the development process
could help identify ways to incorporate the most important
components previously identiﬁed for pharmacist entrepre-
neurs. Additionally, drafting policy that deﬁnes the role of
entrepreneurial education in schools and colleges of phar-
macy could lead to a formal Association stance on its place
in accreditation standards.

While many pharmacist entrepreneur KSAs may be
mapped to the standards, several were intended to solve
therapeutic problems or prioritize a specific patient’s
needs (eg critical thinking, decision-making, technol-
ogy, communication) and may not be completely trans-
ferable to the construct of a pharmacist entrepreneur. For
example, the process of communicating a medication
action plan effectively to an interprofessional health
team may not fully capture the communication skills
identiﬁed in the literature as necessary for pharmacist
entrepreneurs. Additionally, some KSAs identiﬁed in
this review may be included in other courses built to
address the affective domain. The CAPE suggested var-
ious learning objective examples throughout the “Per-
sonal and Professional Development” domain that could
address some of the entrepreneurship KSAs.4 For exam-
ple, displaying conﬁdence and positive self-esteem may
serve to advance a pharmacist’s professional develop-
ment while also advancing one’s ability to exhibit the
“Positivity” domain of entrepreneurship. While educa-
tors can reasonably assume that some of the clinical
KSAs overlap, additional research in this area would
validate the true gaps.

This review included commentaries, instructional
design manuscripts, and organizational committee reports,
which often place more weight on opinion or testimony

than do original research submissions. Peer-reviewed opin-
ions, committee recommendations, and faculty descrip-
tions of new courses could add value to the stated
objectives of this review despite the limitation in meth-
odological rigor. Frequencies for roles and KSAs were
assessed by number of manuscripts, with no qualitative
rating given to them other than that potentially implied
by the study type. Attempting to add subjective ratings
to these types of studies may have introduced different
biases, so we decided to focus on the mere mentioning of
the role or KSA. The search terms used in the literature
search did not include “innovation” or similar terms be-
cause including such terms within the current search strat-
egy would have retrieved articles on drug innovation and
innovations in pharmacy education that were not speciﬁc to
entrepreneurship and increased the number of potential
articles to 5,917.

CONCLUSION

A wide range of roles for entrepreneurship in phar-
macy practice or education were identified. A list of
KSAs from the pharmacy education literature related
to entrepreneurship was developed to assist with estab-
lishing a “pharmacist entrepreneur” construct. Further
research into the agreement with the KSAs and potential
instructional design and assessment strategies is needed
to help guide faculty members interested in incorporat-
ing entrepreneurship education in schools or colleges of
pharmacy.
