Objective:  Although  relationship  distress  is  strongly  associated  with  mental  health  problems,  poorer  social 
functioning and lower quality of life, only a minority of distressed couples engage in effective couples therapy. 
Common barriers are the financial burden, fear of being stigmatized, long waitlists and logistical concerns, such 
as the difficulty in scheduling appointments. Therefore, more accessible help for relationship distress is needed, 
such as internet-based interventions. 
Method: This study evaluates the efficacy of the German web-based PaarBalance program, an 18-sessions online 
program for couples and individuals in an intimate relationship. Participants with relationship distress recruited 
via the internet had access to the unguided self-help program for twelve weeks. A total of 117 individuals (N = 60 
participated as couples, N = 57 participated without a partner) were randomly assigned to begin the intervention 
immediately  or  to  a  12-week  waitlist  control  group.  The  primary  outcome  was  relationship  satisfaction.  Sec-
ondary outcomes included symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
Results: The intervention group showed significant improvement in relationship satisfaction (Cohen’s d =0.77) 
compared with the waitlist control group. Small to medium effect sizes in favor of the intervention group, but no 
statistically significant differences were found regarding depression (d = 0.43) and anxiety (d = 0.45). 
Conclusion: PaarBalance seems to be an effective self-guided intervention to improve relationship satisfaction in 
people with relationship problems.   

1. Introduction 

Humans predominantly live in social relationships. For most people, 
especially a romantic relationship or marriage is a major life goal (e.g., 
Diener et al., 2000). Although divorce rates have increased over the last 
years, most individuals still decide to get married (Bodenmann, 2016). 
The main conclusion of the 75-year longitudinal Harvard grant study 
was that the warmth of close relationships had the most positive influ-
ence on life satisfaction (Vaillant, 2002). In a meta-analysis, Proulx et al. 
(2007) analyzed 93 studies evaluating the effect of marital quality on 
personal  well-being.  The  results  suggest  that  the  higher  the  levels  of 
marital quality, the higher the levels of personal well-being. In addition, 

empirical evidence suggests that marriage is related to a reduced risk of 
developing mental disorders (e.g., Scott et al., 2010; Whisman, 2019). 
Even  mortality  rates  seem  to  decrease  based  on  relationship  stability 
(Kiecolt-Glaser and Newton, 2001). In sum, past research demonstrates 
the importance of stable, intimate relationships. 

Accordingly, empirical evidence suggests marital distress to be a risk 
factor for the development of mental disorders (e.g., Whisman, 2019). A 
longitudinal study evaluating the effects of marital distress on symptoms 
of depression and generalized anxiety disorder proposed a positive as-
sociation  between  marital  discord  and  psychopathological  symptoms 
(Whisman et al., 2018). Evidence also exists for the association between 
relationship distress and physical health problems. For example, hostile

Keller et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

behaviors in relationships are correlated with alterations of cardiovas-
cular activity, stress-related hormones, and dysregulation of the immune 
system (Robles and Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003). Low relationship quality not 
only influences couples themselves but also the people around them. For 
instance,  marital  conflicts  negatively  influence  child  development 
(Cummings and Davies, 2010). Taken together, the effects of low marital 
quality are expansive. 

Therefore,  several  interventions  treating relationship  distress  have 
previously been developed. Behavioral couple therapy is the therapeutic 
approach  that  presents  most  empirical  evidence  and  builds  the  foun-
dation of the PaarBalance program (e.g., Baucom et al., 2019). The effect 
of behavioral couple therapy on relationship distress is well approved (e. 
g.,  Shadish  and  Baldwin,  2005).  A  review  suggests  that  behavioral 
couple  therapy  effectively  influences  the  relationship  for  70%  of  the 
couples  (Lebow  et  al.,  2012).  Moreover,  behavioral  couple  therapy’s 
important  role  in  the  treatment  of  concomitant  mental  disorders  has 
been demonstrated (e.g., Baucom et al., 2020). 

Although couple therapy is effective, distressed couples frequently 
consult therapeutic help too late or not at all. Barriers to face-to-face 
therapy could be treatment costs, fear of being stigmatized, long wait-
lists  and  logistical  concerns,  such  as  the  difficulty  in  scheduling  ap-
pointments (e.g., Amichai-Hamburger et al., 2014). Internet-delivered 
interventions  overcome  some  of  these  boundaries.  They  are  often 
accessible at low cost compared to face-to-face therapy (e.g., Georgia 
Salivar et al., 2018), more anonymous, and available at any time and 
any  place.  Moreover,  populations  with  limited  access  to  face-to-face 
therapy can benefit. Thus, internet-based programs for couples are an 
enrichment for couple interventions (Cicilia et al., 2014). 

A  number  of  trials  and  reviews  demonstrating  the  efficacy  and 
effectiveness of online interventions for different psychopathologies (e. 
g.,  Andersson  et  al.,  2019;  Andrews  et  al.,  2018;  Berger  et  al.,  2011; 
Cuijpers et al., 2010). Several studies suggest that online couple therapy 
is  effective  in  increasing  relationship  satisfaction  in  American  pop-
ulations. For instance, studies report that the computer-based version of 
the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (ePREP) effec-
tively  teaches  and  improves  relationship  skills  (e.g.,  Braithwaite  and 
Fincham,  2007,  2009; Loew  et  al., 2012).  PREP  is  a  psychoeducative 
relationship  program  that  focuses  on  functional  communication 
(Markman et al., 2009). There is one existing translation of Integrative 
Behavioral  Couple  Therapy  into  an  online  treatment  in  English  lan-
guage, the OurRelationship program (OR; Doss et al., 2013). Doss et al. 
(2016)  compared  OR to  a  waitlist control  group in  a  controlled  trial. 
Couples in the OR-condition showed significantly more improvement in 
relationship  satisfaction,  individual  functioning  and  symptoms  of 
depression and anxiety than couples in the control group. These positive 
effects were stable at one-year-follow-up (Doss et al., 2019). In another 
clinical trial, it was shown that both ePREP and OR improved relation-
ship quality for low-income couples (Doss et al., 2020). Significant dif-
ferences in the effectiveness of the two treatments were found for verbal 
conflict (significant decrease in the OR group), but not for satisfaction, 
breakup potential, intimacy and intimate partner violence. To summa-
rize,  research  suggests  a  high  potential  for  web-based  couple  in-
terventions. In German language, some scientifically substantiated and 
promising online programs for couples exist: besides PaarBalance those 
are e.g., Paarlife (Bodenmann, 2020) or Theratalk (Beer, 2020). How-
ever,  so  far  no  studies  have  been  published  examining  the  effects  of 
online couple therapy in German-speaking populations. 

In the current study, we therefore aim to evaluate the efficacy of the 
web-based  German  PaarBalance  program  on  relationship  satisfaction, 
depression,  and  anxiety  in  a  randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT).  We 
hypothesize that the self-help program will have a significant effect on 
increasing relationship satisfaction and decreasing depression and anx-
iety compared to the waitlist condition. Further, we predict a positive 
change in quality of life and work functioning in the intervention group 
compared to the control group. 

2. Material and methods 

This RCT compared an immediate intervention group with a waitlist 
control group. The final sample size, study design, outcome measures, 
and  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  determined  before  data 
collection. The protocol of the study was approved by the institutional 
review board of XXX (blinded for review). The study is registered in the 
German register of clinical studies (Deutsches Register Klinischer Stud-
ien, DRKS). 

2.1. Recruitment and selection of participants 

Participants were recruited via internet blogs and websites, which 
cover  relationship  or  parenthood  topics.  They  were  neither  paid  nor 
received other incentives to participate except for the free use of Paar-
Balance. If interested, people wrote an e-mail to receive further infor-
mation  about  the  study  and  the  requirements  for  participation.  For 
instance, to obtain informed consent, it was pointed out that there are 
two different groups named Early Starter (intervention group) and Later 
Starter (control group) they would be assigned to. In the next step, po-
tential participants had to specify whether they would like to participate 
alone or together with their partner. A subsequent screening question-
naire (included in the first measurement) determined eligibility for the 
study. 

Participants  had  to  be  at  least  18  years  old,  have  private  internet 
access, and a good knowledge of written and spoken German. Moreover, 
criteria for inclusion were being in a heterosexual relationship (to ensure 
homogeneity of the sample) and being in a relationship for at least six 
months.  The  relationship  satisfaction,  measured  with  a  partnership 
questionnaire (PFB-K; Hahlweg, 2016) had to be 18 or lower (T = 50) to 
be in a distressed range. Criteria for exclusion were being in the process 
of separation, currently participating in couples counseling or individual 
therapy, or taking psychiatric medication. People who reported violence 
in their relationship or a suicidal tendency were also excluded and given 
information  regarding  appropriate  treatment  facilities.  If  one  partner 
was  not  eligible,  the  other  could  also  not  participate  in  the  study. 
However,  both  were  given  free  access  to  the  PaarBalance  program 
without participation in the present study. 

A total of 192 individuals applied for participation, 117 met the in-
clusion criteria. A stratified randomization procedure was applied such 
that a balanced distribution of couples or individuals to the two treat-
ment  arms  was  ensured.  The  allocation  lists  were  made  using  a 
computerized random number generator and were unknown to the in-
vestigators. The main reason for exclusion was a too high level of rela-
tionship satisfaction (PFB-K raw score > 18), which was the case for 52 
participants (see Fig. 1). 

Post-hoc power analyses revealed that the sample of 117 participants 
provided 98.6% of the power for relationship satisfaction and 97.5% for 
quality  of  life  but  only  67.5%  for  anxiety,  63.9%  for  depression,  and 
50.3% for work functioning at the Type I error probability of 0.05. 

2.2. Participants 

Thirty  couples  and  57  individuals  participated  in  the  study  (39 
males, 78 females). The mean age was 40.4 years (SD= 10.6; range =
19–71).  72.0%  were  married,  25.0%  were  never  married,  2.0%  were 
engaged and 2.0% divorced. On average, couples had been together for 
13.2  years  (SD  = 9.4;  range  = 1–41).  Of  the  117  participants,  105 
(89.7%) had children, 12 (10.3%) did not have children. The majority of 
the  sample  had  a  university  degree  as  the  highest  level  of  education 
(78.0%). Most participants were employed (73.0%), some self-employed 
(10.0%),  the  rest  of  the  sample  were  students  (7.0%),  homemakers 
(14.0%),  unemployed  (3.0%),  or  retired  (1.0%).  The  majority  of  the 
sample was German (91.0%) and Austrian (6.0%) or had other nation-
alities (3.0%).

2.3. Procedures and description of conditions 

The recruitment started in May 2018 and ended in June 2019. After 
meeting the criteria and being randomly assigned (T1), the intervention 
group  got  access  to  the  PaarBalance  program.  Every  two  weeks,  par-
ticipants in the intervention group received a short online questionnaire 
based  on  self-reported  data  to  determine  their  current  status  in  the 
program  (e.g.,  number  of  sessions  and  homework)  to  assess  their 
adherence.  Participants  who  did  not  respond  to  the  questionnaire 
received two reminder e-mails. During the 12-weeks treatment period, 
the waitlist control group did not receive access to the program. After 
the  12  weeks,  all  participants  received  the  post-assessment  question-
naires (T2) and the waitlist control group got access to the PaarBalance 
program for the following 12 weeks. Similar to the intervention group, 
they also received a short questionnaire every two weeks during their 
treatment  period.  After  12  weeks,  again,  all participants  received  the 
next and last assessment (T3). This was a 12-weeks-follow-up-measure-
ment  for  the  intervention  group  and  a  post-II-measurement  for  the 
waitlist control group directly after treatment. 

2.4. Description of intervention 

The  Paarbalance  program  starts  with  the  64-item  PaarBalance 

relationship  questionnaire  (Schindler  et  al.,  2018).  Directly  after 
completing  the  questionnaire,  clients  receive  the  results  of  the  ques-
tionnaire,  that  is,  a  relationship  profile  with  the  strengths  and  weak-
nesses of their relationship. The questionnaire is supposed to help the 
client identify difficulties in the intimate relationship. After finishing the 
questionnaire,  participants  get  access  to  the  18  sessions  PaarBalance 
program. Table 1 depicts their content. As mentioned above, the sessions 
are  based  on  Integrative  Behavior  Therapy  for  couples  (e.g.,  Baucom 
et al., 2019; Christensen and Glynn, 2019). 

Every  session  includes  a  psychoeducative  video  with  information 
about the respective topic. The video is followed by two exercises and 
three  homework  options  related  to  the  content  of  the  video.  Having 
finished the exercises, the client has to pick at least one homework op-
tion and enter a date until intending to complete it. The program re-
minds the client of the homework when logging into the program. The 
sessions have a predetermined order as they build upon each other. Once 
sessions are completed, they can be repeated as often as desired. Before 
and after every session, the client receives a standardized e-mail to in-
crease the motivation of participation in the program. The content of the 
program can be shared with the partner, if desired. Gastner et al. (2018) 
recommend clients to complete one or two sessions each week to leave 
enough time for practice and homework. In addition to the sessions, the 
program offers features such as measuring the satisfaction of the client

allowing to monitor change over the 12 weeks. Furthermore, the rela-
tionship  timeline  can  be  used  to  record  important  events  in  the  rela-
tionship.  The  client  can  also  have  a  look  at  the  quintessence  of  the 
sessions. 

2.5. Measures 

The primary outcome measure of the present study is relationship 
satisfaction. The secondary outcome measures of the study are depres-
sion, anxiety, quality of life, work functioning and satisfaction with the 
program. 

2.5.1. Relationship satisfaction 

Relationship satisfaction was measured by the total value of the short 
version of the PFB (Hahlweg, 2016), the PFB-K (Kliem et al., 2012). The 
PFB-K  includes  10  items  and  has  three  subscales:  conflict  behavior, 
tenderness  and  commonality/communication  and  one  extra 
item 
measuring the global relationship satisfaction. The PFB has shown good 
reliability (α = 0.84; Kliem et al., 2012). The total value is composed of 
the three subscale values and ranges from 0 to 27 (= highest level of 
relationship satisfaction) measured on a 4-point Likert scale. The PFB 
has shown good discriminative and predictive validity (Hahlweg, 2016). 
In the present sample Cronbach’s alpha was 0.67 (conflict behavior α  =
0.75; tenderness α = 0.68; commonality/communication α = 0.39). 

2.5.2. Depression 

Symptoms  of  depression  were  measured  with  the  Patient  Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9; German version: L¨owe et al., 2002), a self-report 
measure  with  nine  questions  measuring  characteristic  symptoms  of 
depression, such as feeling hopeless, having no motivation or interest, 
and suicidal thoughts on a 4-point Likert scale. The internal consistency, 
sensitivity  and  specificity  for  identifying  depressive  disorders  of  the 
PHQ-9 is good (e.g., Gr¨afe et al., 2004; Kroenke et al., 2010). PHQ-9 
values  between  10  and  27  indicate  moderate  to  severe  symptoms  of 
depression. In the present sample Cronbach’s alpha was 0.75. 

2.5.3. Anxiety 

With  the  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  Scale  (GAD-7;  German 
version: L¨owe et al., 2002) symptoms such as feeling anxious, nervous, 
being restless and worrying were measured on a 4-point Likert scale. The 
GAD-7 has shown good reliability and validity for measuring anxiety in 
the general population (L¨owe et al., 2008). GAD-7 values between 5 and 
21  indicate  moderate  to  serve  symptoms  of  anxiety.  In  the  present 
sample Cronbach’s alpha was 0.83. 

2.5.4. Work functioning and quality of life 

Quality of life and functioning were measured with two items: (1) 
“How would you describe your quality of life?” (Likert scale from 0 to 5: 
very low, low, rather low, rather high, high, very high; from the WHO 
(World  Health  Organization)  Quality  of  Life  BREF;  (The  WHOQOL 
Group,  1998);  (2)  “How  would  you  rate  your  functioning?  Please 
describe  your  work  functioning  or  -  if  you  are  not  working  -  your 
functioning at home” (Likert scale from 0 to 5: very low, low, rather low, 
rather high, high, very high). 

2.5.5. Participants’ satisfaction with the program 

Right after participants had finished the program (T2 for interven-
tion  group,  T3  for  the  waitlist  control  group),  they were  asked  if  the 
PaarBalance program helped them to increase their relationship satis-
faction, if the most important relationship topics were included in the 
program, if they experienced pleasure completing the program, if they 
felt  motivated  enough,  what  aspect  of  the  program  they  found  most 
helpful, how they would describe their total satisfaction with the pro-
gram, and if they would recommend it to friends and family. 

2.6. Statistical analysis 

All data analyses were done using R (R Core Team, 2017) and the 
package lme4 (Bates et al., 2015). Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM, 
Raudenbush  and  Bryk,  2002)  addresses  the  dependency  of  data  pre-
sented in longitudinal studies, due to repeated-measures (here: assess-
ment of outcome measurements at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks) 
nested within clients. HLM can handle missing data and mimic an intent- 
to-treat  approach  by  including  all  participants  into  the  analysis  who 
completed outcome measures at least once. 

We  first  ran  two-level  fully  unconditional  models  with  relationship 
satisfaction, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and level of functioning 
as  outcome  variables.  Based  on  these  five  unconditional  models,  we 
calculated  intraclass  correlation  coefficients  to  establish  the  variance 
explained  by  client  effects  (level  2).  Results  indicated  that  HLM  is 
necessary. 

To  establish  whether  there  was  a  significant  modification  in  rela-
tionship satisfaction, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and functioning 
in  the  overall  sample  of  the  study,  time-as–only-predictor  models  were 
calculated. Due to the design of the study, the time variable was fixed. 
Further,  it  was  split  into  the  first  phase  of  the  treatment  (T1  to  T2), 
where half of the sample received access to PaarBalance while the other 
half  waited,  and  the  second  treatment  phase  (T2  to  T3),  where  the 
waitlist control group was also given the active intervention. The time 
variable was defined as weeks and centered at week 12. This implies that 
the intercept of the model is interpreted as the estimated outcome var-
iables at week 12, while the time slope is defined as the weekly rate of 
change in weeks 1–12 for T1 to T2 and weeks 12–24 for T2 to T3. 

Based on these results we ran four conditional models with time in 
weeks as the only level-1 predictor as a fixed coefficient and centered at 
week  12,  and  with  treatment  condition  (PaarBalance  vs.  waitlist)  as 
level-2  predictor  of  both  the  intercept  (estimated  value  of  outcome 
variables in week 12) and the linear slope (weekly change in outcome 
variables between weeks 1 and 12 as well as 12 and 24) of the dependent 
variables. 

Furthermore,  we  calculated  effect  sizes  using  Cohen’s  d  by  sub-
tracting the means of the two subgroups and dividing the result of the 
subtraction by the pooled standard deviation with the weights for the 
sample sizes of both subgroups.

fits  compared  to  the  fully  unconditional  models  for  relationship  satis-
faction (χ2(5) = 27.28, p< .001), depression (χ2(5) = 10.58, p< .01), 
anxiety (χ2(5) = 23.76, p< .001), and quality of life (χ2(5)= 16.46, p<
.001). This was not the case for work functioning (χ2(5) = 1.93, p=.38). 

3.2. Missing data and drop-outs 

By the post survey, 42.7% of the intervention group and 11.5% of the 
control group had missing data due to no response or incompletion. By 
the  3-month  follow-up,  the  intervention  group  had  51.8%  and  the 
control group 44.3% of missing data (see CONSORT diagram). Six par-
ticipants (five from the intervention group, one from the waitlist control 
group) dropped out between the first and the second assessment. Two 
participants in the intervention group indicated their personal situation, 
two  others  indicated  that  they  had  not  gotten  round  and  one  other 
indicated personal and professional stress as reasons for the drop-out. 
The participant in the waitlist control group declared that he did not 
want  to  participate  anymore.  Another  three  participants  from  the 
waitlist  control  group  dropped  out  between  the  second  and  the  third 
assessment. One indicated health issues, one a death in family and one 
that he did not want to participate anymore as the reasons for the drop- 
out.  There  were  no  significant  differences  between  completers  and 
dropouts neither on any measured patient characteristic at pretreatment 
nor on program engagement (all ps > 0.15). 

3.3. Main results – treatment condition as predictor of outcome 

We found significant effects of treatment modality on the estimated 
scores of relationship satisfaction at week 12 (Y00  = 2.12, SE = 0.84, 
95%  CI  [0.47,  3.77],  t(218)  = 2.54,  p<.05)  and  the  weekly  rate  of 
change in relationship satisfaction from week 1 to 12 (Y10 = 0.24, SE =
0.06, 95% CI [(cid:0) 0.01, 0.03], t(163) = 3.80, p<.001) and week 12 to week 
24  (Y20  = (cid:0) 0.22,  SE  = 0.07,  95%  CI  [(cid:0) 0.01,  0.03],  t(155)= (cid:0) 3.06, 
p<.01). Results revealed that clients who received PaarBalance in the 
first treatment phase had  a 2.12 units higher  estimated score in rela-
tionship satisfaction at week 12 than clients who were in the waitlist 
condition. In treatment phase one, the active intervention was related to 
an increase of 0.24 weekly units more in relationship satisfaction when 
compared  to  the  waitlist  control  group.  In  treatment  phase  two,  the 
waitlist group also received access to PaarBalance and improved by 0.16 
weekly  units  in  relationship  satisfaction,  which  is  0.13  weekly  units 
more  than  during  their  own  waiting  period  (0.03).  The  intervention 
group  maintained  their  improvements  over  follow-up  ((cid:0) 0.07  weekly 
units)  when  compared  to  their  weekly  improvement  by  0.26  units  in 
relationship  satisfaction  over  the  intervention  period.  Additionally, 
there  was  a  significant  effect  of  treatment  modality  on  the  estimated 
scores of quality of life at week 12 (Y00 = 0.37, SE = 0.18, 95% CI [0.02, 
0.72], t(227) = 2.07, p<.05) and the weekly rate of change in quality of 
life from week 1 to 12 (Y10 = 0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI [(cid:0) 0.01, 0.03], t 
(156) = 2.20, p<.05). Results indicate that clients in the intervention 
group presented a 0.37 higher estimated score in quality of life at week 
12 than the clients without active treatment. Between weeks 1 and 12, 
this  group  increased  by  0.03  units  per  week  more,  than  the  control 
group. The same models analyzing the effects of treatment modality on 
depression and anxiety did not reveal significant results. 

Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the outcome 
variables  distinguished  between  conditions  and  assessment  points  as 
well as the between-group effect sizes at post-treatment. 

3.4. Treatment adherence 

On average, participants performed 7.2 (SD = 2.7) out of 18 sessions. 
97% completed at least one session, 49.1% completed at least half of the 
program, and 21.2% completed most of the program. 4.3% of the par-
ticipants  involved  their  partner  in  the  program  via  e-mail,  31.7% 
involved  their  partners  during  conversation,  7.7%  showed  or  talked

Descriptive  results  of  participants’  evaluation  of  the  program  are 
presented in Table 3. Seventy-five percent of the intervention group and 
63.9%  of  the  control  group  reported  an  overall  satisfaction  between 
satisfied and very satisfied. 

4. Discussion 

4.1. Effects on relationship satisfaction 

Past research has highlighted the importance of relationship satis-
faction for mental and physical health. It has also suggested a high po-
tential of web-based interventions. The primary aim of this study was to 
investigate  the  effects  of  the  German  PaarBalance  program  on  rela-
tionship  satisfaction.  Consistent  with  our  hypothesis,  PaarBalance 
significantly improved relationship satisfaction in individuals and cou-
ples compared to the waitlist control condition (d = 0.77). This result is 
in accordance with findings by Doss et al. (2016), revealing significant 
positive  effects  of  the  OR  program  on  relationship  satisfaction  (d  =
0.69). Likewise, in Doss et al. (2020) an effect size of d = 0.72 for OR and 
d  = 0.61  for  ePREP  was  reported.  Overall,  the  results  underline  the 
effectiveness of online couple interventions. 

In the present study the waitlist control group showed no change in 
relationship satisfaction over the waiting period. This is in accordance

with  past  research  indicating  no  spontaneous  remission  concerning 
relationship distress (Baucom et al., 2003). Once they received access to 
the  program,  this  group  also  exhibited  significant  improvement  in 
relationship satisfaction. Thus, PaarBalance might offer new and effec-
tive treatment options, especially to couples with little time, e.g. because 
of  young  children,  when  one  or  both  partners  have  to  work  during 
normal business hours, for those who are in long-distance relationships, 
and/or live in underserved areas. In our case, the program even seemed 
to be attractive to couples with lower levels of relationship distress, as 
most  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  present  study  due  to  the  high 
levels of relationship satisfaction, see Fig. 1. 

4.2. Effects on depression, anxiety, quality of life and work functioning 

In  line  with  past  research  (e.g.,  Doss  et  al.,  2016),  we  further 
examined the effects of the PaarBalance program on depression, anxiety, 
quality of life and work functioning. Effects on depression and anxiety 
were not significant. One reason explaining the nonsignificant effects on 
depression and anxiety in the present study may be the low severity of 
depression  and  anxiety  symptoms  at  baseline  leaving  few  room  for 
improvement  over  the  course  of  the  intervention.  Doss  et  al.  (2016) 
found significant effects with respect to depression and anxiety at post- 
treatment. Anxiety was measured with the GAD-7 in both studies. Doss 
et  al.  (2016)  reported  baseline  scores  of  6.73  for  men  and  9.75  for 
women. In the present study, the sample presented an overall mean of 
5.84 at treatment begin. This indicates higher levels of anxiety at pre- 
treatment in the study of Doss et al. (2016). Symptoms of depression 
were  measured  with  different  instruments  in  the  two  studies  and  are 
therefore  not  directly  comparable.  Statistical  analyses  revealed  a  sig-
nificant effect of PaarBalance on quality of life (d = 0.73) but no sig-
nificant effects on work functioning. However, these results should be 
interpreted with caution, as quality of life and functioning were both 
measured using one item only and theoretical concerns have been raised 
about measuring constructs with a single-item. Besides, values of func-
tioning  were  already  relatively  high  at  baseline  (on  average  between 
rather  high  and  high)  and  thus  a  ceiling  effect  may  account  for  the 
nonsignificant  results.  Further,  post-hoc power analyses revealed  that 
the  lack  of  significance  for  individual  functioning  versus  relationship 
functioning could be due to the sample size as 117 participants provided 
high power for relationship satisfaction and quality of life but not for 
anxiety,  depression,  and  work  functioning  thus  impairing  the  proba-
bility of finding statistically significant differences when there are true 
differences. 

We did not compute subgroup analyses accounting for initial prob-
lems of depression, anxiety, and functioning, because the sample size 
would have been too small to achieve meaningful results. Future studies 
with larger samples may further investigate whether depression, anxi-
ety, and work functioning can be fostered by means of the PaarBalance 
program. 

4.3. Participants’ evaluation of the program 

Overall, participants reported that they were satisfied with the pro-
gram, enjoyed participation and most of them would recommend it to 
friends and family. Further, they rated their perceived increase in rela-
tionship  satisfaction,  satisfaction  with  the  program’s  content,  and 
motivation  induced  by  the  program  between  partially  satisfied  and 
satisfied on average. This demonstrates that the PaarBalance program 
was well received by users and supports the usefulness of the program in 
treating relationship distress. Doss et al. (2016) reported a satisfaction 
rate of 94%, while in the present study, 75% of the intervention group 
and 63.9% control group were satisfied with the program. Considering 
that the present study did not offer any additional phone calls or video- 
based  contacts  from  the  study  team,  this  is  a  satisfactory  result.  In 
contrast  to  our  study  design,  the  participants  in  Doss  et  al.  (2016) 
received  four  phone  calls  or  videoconferences  (about  one  hour  each) 

with a coach, supporting them in effective program usage. Similarly, in 
the study by Doss et al. (2020), participants were in contact with their 
coach every week. In the present study, we decided to make the program 
use  as  naturalistic as  possible.  The  biweekly questionnaires  to  ensure 
adherence  to  PaarBalance  was  the  only  difference  between  normal 
program usage and usage as a participant in our study. 

4.4. Limitations and future directions 

Although  PaarBalance  has  paved  the  way  for  online  web-based 
relationship coaching in German-speaking countries, the present study 
comes with several limitations. First, this study has been compromised 
by the rather high drop-out-rate in the intervention group. Second, the 
study was underpowered to detect small to medium effect sizes found in 
secondary outcome measures such as depression and anxiety. This re-
stricts the generalizability of the results. Third, the majority of partici-
pants (78%) had a university degree as their highest level of education. 
This  also  limits  the  generalizability  of  our  findings  to  less  educated 
groups.  Future  research  is  needed  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of 
PaarBalance in a more diverse sample. Fourth, Cronbachs Alpha of the 
total value of the PFB was not as high as expected (α = 0.67). As rela-
tionship satisfaction is the primary outcome measure, a more reliable 
measure would be preferable. 

Another limitation is treatment adherence which was measured by 
means  of  self-report.  On  average,  participants  reported  that  they 
completed 7 out of 18 sessions. This is a common difficulty concerning 
unguided web-based interventions (Titov et al., 2013). In comparison 
with  guided  internet  interventions  which  include  weekly  human  sup-
port, unguided interventions with no human support tend to be associ-
ated with higher dropout rates (Melville et al., 2010), lower adherence 
(Christensen  et  al.,  2009),  and  lower  effects  (Karyotaki  et  al.,  2017). 
Future  research  could  investigate  adherence  to  and  the  efficacy  of 
PaarBalance, when delivered in a guided format. Currently, the Paar-
Balance progam is tested in a blended format, in which the program is 
combined with couple counseling. Moreover, due to a limited budget we 
were not able to assess adherence by means of computerized data (e.g. 
completed  lessons,  number  of  log-ins,  duration  of  individual  lessons, 
etc.) but used self-reported data only. Computerized models may allow 
for predictions of program usage and may help to improve the program. 
For instance, it would be enriching to know how long participants on 
average  need  for  completion  of  one  session,  how  many  sessions  they 
perform per week, whether they repeat sessions, whether participants 
perform all 18 sessions and when they stop using the program. Inter-
estingly, it would also allow to examine individual differences in pro-
gram suitability and effectiveness. 

Finally,  the  study  strongly  relies  on  self-reported  data.  However, 
when it comes to couple data explicit measures such as self-report data 
can  be  misleading  (e.g.  Farue  et  al.,  2018;  Joel  et  al.,  2017).  Future 
research  should  consider  combining  self-report  data  with  implicit 
observational data by external observers. 

5. Conclusions 

To  conclude,  in  the  present  study  the  PaarBalance  program  was 
effective in significantly increasing relationship satisfaction and quality 
of life in distressed couples. The program might offer a new evidence- 
based  treatment  opportunity  especially  for  couples  with  few  time, 
long-distance  relationships  and/or  couples  in  underserved  areas. 
Internet-based  treatments  for  couples  with  relationship  distress  hold 
promise, however, more research is needed to substantiate these claims.

At Level 1, the model estimated the scores of relationship satisfaction, depression, anxiety, quality of life and work functioning at moment i for 
client j by client j’s average score across study time (β0j). The random effect rij allowed client j to vary at time i from his average score across study time. 
At Level 2, the average score for client j (β0j) was predicted by the average sample mean score across study time (γ00). The random effect u0j allowed 

client j to vary from the average sample’s score.

At level 1, the model estimated the scores of PFB/PHQ-9/GAD-7/QL/WF at moment i for client j, as a function of the level of the dependent variable 
at week 12 (β 0) and its rate of change during the first (β 1) and second 12 weeks (β 2) analyzed for client j. The random effect rij is the measurement 
error for client j at moment i. 

At level 2, these coefficients dropped down to be predicted by the average of the dependent variable in week 12 (β00) and the average change over 
the course of the first (β10) and second 12 weeks (β20) across all clients. The random effects u0j, u1j, and u2j represent each client’s deviation from (or 
variability around) the sample’s average post-treatment score, piece 1 weekly change and piece 2 weekly change.

At Level 1, PFB/PHQ-9/GAD-7/QL/WFij is the score for client j at time i, which was predicted by the score in session 12 (β0j) and the weekly rate of 
change during the first (β1j; piece 1 slope) and second (β2j; piece 2 slope) 12 weeks. The random effect rij  is the measurement error for client j at 
moment i. 

At Level 2, the estimated scores for client j at session 12 (β0j) were predicted by the sample’s average score in session 12 (γ00) and treatment 
modality (γ01). The rate of change over the first 12 weeks (β1j) for client j was predicted by the sample average rate of change over the first 12 weeks 
(γ10) and treatment modality (γ11). The weekly rate of change over the second 12 weeks (β2j) for client j was predicted by the sample average weekly 
rate of change over the second 12 weeks (γ20) and treatment modality (γ21). The random effects u0j, u1j, and u2j represent each client’s deviation from 
(or variability around) the sample average post-treatment score, piece 1 weekly change and piece 2 weekly change.
