Abstract

Middle-aged and older adults constitute a high suicide risk group. Among adults aged 50 years old 
and older, suicide rates increased and suicide deaths almost doubled during the period from 2000 
to 2015. Suicide rates are elevated for patients hospitalized for suicidality (i.e. active suicidal 
ideation or suicide attempt) and the three months post-hospitalization is the time of the highest 
suicide risk. Psychosocial interventions for middle-aged and older adults hospitalized for 
suicidality are sparse. In this article, we present the main aspects, stages, techniques and a clinical 
case study of Cognitive Reappraisal Intervention for Suicide Prevention (CRISP), a psychosocial

intervention targeting cognitive reappraisal to reduce suicide risk in middle-aged and older adults 
who have been recently hospitalized for suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. CRISP is based on 
the theory that hospitalization for suicidality is preceded by an emotional crisis (“perfect storm”); 
this emotional crisis is related to personalized (patient- and situation-specific) triggers; and 
identifying these personalized triggers and the associated negative emotions and providing 
strategies for an adaptive response to these triggers and negative emotions will reduce suicidal 
ideation and improve suicide prevention. CRISP therapists identify these triggers of negative 
emotions and employ cognitive reappraisal techniques to reduce these negative emotions. The 
cognitive reappraisal techniques have been selected from different psychosocial interventions and 
the affective neuroscience literature and have been simplified for use with middle-aged and older 
adults. CRISP may fill a treatment need for the post-discharge high risk period for middle-aged 
and older adults hospitalized for suicidality.

INTRODUCTION

Suicide rates in the US have steadily increased from 2000–2015, from 10.4/100,000 in 2000 
to 13.7/100,000 in 2015[1]. Middle-aged and older adults constitute a high suicide risk 
group. Among adults aged 50 years old and older, suicide rates increased from 13.9/100,000 
in 2000 to 18.4/100,000 in 2015 and suicide deaths almost doubled during the same period. 
The highest risk group for suicide is among white males aged 85 years or older (suicide rate 
in 2015: 52.5/100,000). The increase in suicide rates of middle-aged and older adults (50 
years old and older) may be a cohort effect, since “baby boomers” have had traditionally 
higher rates of suicide than earlier or subsequent birth cohorts[2]. As a result, the suicide 
rates of middle-aged and older adults may increase as this cohort becomes older.

Suicide rates are significantly elevated in patients who have been recently discharged from a 
psychiatric hospital. Across all age groups, recently hospitalized patients are at high suicide 
risk during the early post-discharge period[3], especially within the first 3 months after 
discharge[4,5]. In a recent study of 1,861,194 young adults [18–64 years old] of the Center 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the suicide rates for 3 months after hospital discharge 
were alarmingly high, e.g. 235.1/100,000 (0.235%) for patients with a diagnosis of a 
depressive disorder and 216/100,000 (0.216%) for bipolar disorder[6]. Suicide risk is even 
higher in those who have been hospitalized for suicidality (i.e. suicidal ideation or suicide 
attempt)[7]. The risk of suicide after hospitalization also increases in middle-aged and older 
adults. In a meta-analysis of 177 studies of suicide risk after hospitalization in North and 
South America, the risk of suicide was 1.8% (CI 1.5–2) and the risk of non-fatal repeat self-
harm after hospitalization was 15.1% within one year[8]. In a study of 564 adults aged 50 
years and older who died by suicide, 86 (15%) died during the first week and 154 (27%) 
during the first month after hospitalization[9,10]. Considering the increase in suicide rates in 
hospitalized patients within the 3 months of hospital discharge, it is important to develop 
interventions to reduce suicide risk during the early post-discharge period. The need is 
pressing for middle-aged and older adults, who have increased suicide mortality.

Despite the need for psychosocial interventions for suicide prevention for middle-aged and 
older adults hospitalized for suicidality, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of

psychotherapies or psychosocial interventions aimed specifically at reducing suicide risk 
after a suicide-related hospitalization for middle-aged adults are sparse[11–15], and to our 
knowledge there are no RCTs for older adults[16–18]. Most psychosocial interventions that 
have shown efficacy in reducing suicide risk focus on young adults and have been developed 
to treat mental disorders associated with suicide (e.g. depression, borderline personality 
disorder) rather than suicide risk per se. Even though treatment approaches for older adults 
may include psychotherapeutic techniques found effective in young adults, the presence of 
increased medical comorbidity and disability, decreased cognitive and physical functioning, 
and adjustment to significant losses of late-life highlight the need for psychotherapeutic 
techniques specifically for older adults[19]. Our article attempts to address this treatment gap 
by describing a post-discharge psychosocial intervention for middle-aged and older adults 
who have been hospitalized for suicidality.

Following the model of neurobiologically informed psychotherapy development of 
Alexopoulos and Arean[20], we relied on advances in affective neuroscience to develop a 
novel psychosocial intervention for suicide prevention for this population. Our intervention, 
entitled “Cognitive Reappraisal Intervention for Suicide Prevention (CRISP),” is based on 
the insight that the way people think about the situations they encounter shapes their 
emotional response.

Cognitive reappraisal is the ability to modify the individual’s appraisal of a situation, 
emotional state, or event to alter its emotional significance[21]. Biologically, cognitive 
reappraisal is presumed to be a behavioral expression of the Cognitive Control construct of 
the RDoC Cognitive System domain and to depend on an interaction between the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), implicated in the governance of emotional functions, 
and the subcortical circuits associated with emotion processing[22,23].

We chose cognitive reappraisal as the target of the intervention because: a) suicidal ideation 
and behavior are frequently associated with unsuccessful attempts to regulate intense 
negative emotions, including depression, anxiety, hopelessness, irritability, anger, and 
guilt[24–29] b) cognitive reappraisal is an effective emotion regulation strategy with identified 
neurobiological correlates[21–30,31] ; c) higher levels of cognitive reappraisal are associated 
with lower suicide risk[32–34]; and d) cognitive reappraisal strategies can be effectively used 
to reduce suicide risk in middle-aged and older adults[12,35–37]. We place emphasis on 
suicidal ideation in addition to suicidal behavior, because suicidal ideation after a suicide-
related hospitalization is a known significant risk factor for suicide[38]. In the present article, 
we will present a case study of CRISP and highlight its main aspects, stages, and clinical 
techniques.

METHODS

Cognitive Reappraisal Intervention for Suicide Prevention (CRISP)

CRISP’s theory of suicide prevention after hospitalization is based on the following 
assumptions: 1) Hospitalization for suicidality is preceded by an emotional crisis (“perfect 
storm”). Hospitalized patients have had difficulty dealing with this emotional crisis, leading 
to increased suicidal ideation and/or a suicide attempt; 2) This emotional crisis is related to

personalized (patient- and situation-specific) triggers; and 3) Identifying these personalized 
triggers and the associated negative emotions and providing strategies for an adaptive 
response to these triggers and negative emotions will reduce suicidal ideation and improve 
suicide prevention.

CRISP is a 12-week psychosocial intervention that aims to reduce suicide risk by employing 
simplified, easy to administer and use, cognitive reappraisal strategies. We utilize these 
techniques in situations that trigger negative emotions, suicidal ideation, and suicidal 
behavior. These triggers include interpersonal and financial stressors, pain, disability, health-
related concerns and functional impairment. Data on the feasibility, acceptability, attrition, 
and preliminary efficacy of CRISP compared to control will be presented in another 
manuscript. Of the 16 participants involved in our ongoing study, 9 (56%) completed 12 
weeks of CRISP treatment without any suicidal ideation, 3 (19%) had exacerbation of 
symptoms or re-hospitalized, and 4 (25%) refused to continue the research assessments or 
were lost-to follow-up. Ten participants (63%) had an actual, interrupted or aborted suicide 
attempt before the index hospitalization. Participants were very satisfied with treatment 
(Mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire score=3.2, out of 4, higher scores reflect higher 
treatment satisfaction).

CRISP focuses on middle-aged and older adults who have been hospitalized for suicidality 
across different depression and anxiety diagnoses. Patients eligible for CRISP include adults 
50 years or older, recently admitted to a psychiatric hospital for active suicidal ideation or a 
suicide attempt (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ≥ 3, i.e. “Active Suicide Ideation 
with Some Methods”), with any depression or anxiety diagnosis. Patients who have the 
capacity to perform cognitive reappraisal techniques are appropriate for CRISP. CRISP is 
not appropriate for patients with moderate to severe cognitive impairment, with psychosis, or 
in manic episodes.

The selection of the cognitive reappraisal techniques used in CRISP is based on a robust 
body of basic affective science findings[39,40] as well as our experience in utilizing such 
techniques in successful interventions, i.e. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)[12,41], 
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)[42], and Problem Adaptation Therapy (PATH)[35], and 
on the affective neuroscience literature. We have selected the most salient strategies which 
could be easily employed by middle-aged and older adults (50 years old and older). The 
CRISP therapist and the patient identify and simplify cognitive reappraisal techniques, rate 
their effectiveness at reducing negative emotions in the therapist’s office, and create a plan to 
repeatedly employ and rate those techniques outside of the office, in between sessions.

CRISP’s targeted repetition and practice of individualized cognitive reappraisal strategies 
may contribute to long-lasting improvement in cognitive reappraisal[43]. CRISP’s cognitive 
reappraisal stages include: a) Identification of the “Perfect Storm”; b) Identification of 
situations/triggers, negative emotions and thoughts; c) Examination of the utility of negative 
emotions; d) Reappraisal of an emotional trigger; and e) Distancing (shifting away) from the 
emotional experience; and e) Reappraisal of the emotional response to the trigger (Table 1).

CRISP is different from CBT, DBT and PATH. CRISP does not utilize a comprehensive 
CBT approach (including cognitive case conceptualization, guided discovery, change of 
long-standing core maladaptive beliefs, and activity scheduling)[12,41] or DBT approach 
(including the DBT general skills training group, or its focus on mindfulness)[42]. CRISP is 
shorter than CBT for suicidal older men (which requires 12–16 weekly sessions plus 3 
booster sessions) or DBT adapted for older adults[42] (weekly group DBT skills training plus 
24 individual DBT sessions). CRISP is also different from PATH, because PATH targets 
older adults with cognitive impairment (from mild cognitive deficits to moderate dementia), 
utilizes a wide range of emotion regulation strategies (including situation selection, situation 
modification, attentional deployment, and response modulation), employs compensatory 
strategies for older adults with cognitive impairment, and involves the caregiver in treatment. 
Last but not least, CRISP is a psychosocial intervention that specifically targets suicide 
prevention following hospital discharge across different diagnoses (excluding psychosis and 
dementia) and is not designed to treat residual symptoms or mental conditions, including 
depression, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. Therefore, it is administered in 
conjunction with other pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatments. Once the suicide 
risk is significantly reduced at the end of 3 months, patients may continue to utilize other 
psychosocial interventions (e.g. Problem Solving Therapy, PATH, DBT, Interpersonal 
Psychotherapy and Supportive Therapy) to treat these conditions.

Following the recommendations of an expert panel on indicated suicide prevention in older 
adults[44], CRISP offers additional assistance after a suicide-related hospitalization, which 
include a tablet app, phone or home-delivered sessions, and phone calls for immediate help 
during periods of increased stress and heightened negative emotions in between sessions[44]. 
Therefore, even though CRISP is delivered in the therapist’s office, we offer the following 
two aids to enhance its effectiveness and generalizability across patients and situations:

Emotion Regulation During Emotionally Charged Situations—The CRISP 
therapist incorporates environmental adaptations/aids to help patients improve cognitive 
reappraisal and regulate their emotions during emotionally charged situations outside of the 
office. These environmental adaptations/aids are based on patient preference and clinician 
recommendations. They include the utilization of the WellPATH tablet application, written 
step-by-step plans and phone calls. WellPATH: WellPATH is a tablet application that focuses 
on cognitive reappraisal strategies to reduce negative emotions when the patient faces them 
outside of the therapist’s office. The patient and CRISP therapist identify situations, 
problems, or concerns that trigger intense negative emotions and suicidal ideation, and 
develop a plan that includes: a) a list of cognitive reappraisal strategies; b) a video of the 
therapist highlighting these strategies; and c) telephone numbers to utilize if the patient has 
active suicidal ideation. The plan is entered into the WellPATH app and the patient takes the 
tablet with them (the tablets are provided by the study). For example, a patient may identify 
“Spouse Criticism” as the trigger, and “Worthlessness” as the negative emotion associated 
with the trigger. Then, the therapist and the patient develop specific text or video strategies 
to help the patient reduce the feeling of worthlessness and incorporate these strategies into 
WellPATH (Figure 1). When the patient is faced with negative emotions, and during 
scheduled reminders, the patient uses the app to access and utilize the pre-planned strategies.

WellPATH adds to CRISP’s clinical utility by helping the patient use the CRISP techniques 
outside of the office when the patient needs or wants to reduce negative emotions. In 
addition to helping the patient, the app collects data on the frequency of use, utilization and 
effectiveness of strategies and change of negative emotions.

Phone or Home-Delivered Sessions—The CRISP therapist may recommend phone or 
home-delivered sessions in critical situations and only if an in-office session is not feasible 
or appropriate: 1) Concern about acute suicide risk: If the therapist and the supervising 
clinician are concerned about suicide risk (e.g. increased suicidal ideation), phone or even 
home-delivered sessions may be indicated to reduce risk. During the therapists’ visits at 
home, the CRISP therapist may identify triggers that are missed in office visits and may 
apply appropriate cognitive reappraisal techniques that take into consideration the triggers in 
the home-environment. 2) Disability: Disability and functional limitations are risk factors for 
suicide and may prevent some older patients from following weekly outpatient treatment[2]. 
By phone or home delivery, we aim to reach these high risk patients. 3) Ambivalence about 
treatment, low motivation for treatment and repeated missed appointments: Negative 
emotions such as hopelessness, discouragement about treatment outcome and worthlessness 
may interfere with the patient’s willingness and motivation to participate in treatment and to 
follow-through with outpatient treatment. The increase of negative emotions is especially 
alarming for isolated patients after their discharge, because their isolation may further 
contribute to increased suicide risk[45]. The option of phone or home delivery may increase 
patients’ access to therapy when they need it most.

CLINICAL CASE EXAMPLE

Mr. X1, a 64 year old male, was hospitalized for a suicide attempt as he tried to stab himself 
with a kitchen knife. The wound just missed his heart and after being hospitalized to 
stabilize, Mr. X was admitted to an inpatient unit with a diagnosis of Major Depressive 
Disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features without meeting criteria for any Axis 
II diagnosis. He was hospitalized for 3 weeks, was treated with Lithium 600 mg, 
Venlafaxine 225 mg, Trazodone 100 mg and inpatient supportive group therapy and was 
discharged without any suicidal ideation.

Previous psychiatric history

Mr. X’s age of onset of depression was 30 years old. He had three severe episodes of major 
depression in his life and he had been hospitalized twelve years earlier for exacerbation of 
depression but not a suicide attempt. Mr. X was treated with antidepressant medications 
during his previous episodes of depression with modest success; he achieved remission 
within 2–3 months of pharmacological treatment.

CRISP Treatment

During the first two CRISP sessions after his discharge, Mr. X and the CRISP therapist 
identified the triggers and negative emotions that led to his suicide attempt. Mr. X had lost 
his job three months before his attempt, due to reduced company profits, and described a 
sense of anxiety and hopelessness about his financial situation. He said that he had

progressively become more anxious and hopeless during the month before his attempt. (“I 
was afraid that I won’t be able to find a job”; “Even though I knew I was unlikely to lose my 
house, I was getting panicky that I may be homeless”; “My 25-year old daughter has 
financial difficulties and I wanted to support her”). Mr. X also reported an intense feeling of 
guilt about his suicide attempt.

The therapist and the patient reframed the situation that preceded the suicide attempt as a 
“perfect storm of negative emotions” that the patient couldn’t handle (“I thought killing 
myself was the only way out”). During the course of treatment, the patient and the CRISP 
therapist highlighted the following triggers of intense negative emotions that could lead to 
suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior: a) financial triggers that contribute to significant 
anxiety and anger towards himself and his job situation; b) social isolation that may increase 
his loneliness; and c) tension between Mr. X and his wife that contributed to a strong feeling 
of worthlessness and helplessness. Then, Mr. X and his therapist identified cognitive 
reappraisal strategies to improve his perspective about these situations (Table 1). Mr. X 
asked the following questions to help him develop cognitive reappraisal strategies: “Are the 
financial triggers realistic? How can I look at the financial situation from a different, third-
person perspective? What do I gain by these negative emotions? What can I say to myself to 
reduce anxiety about the financial situation? How can I reduce my feelings of loneliness and 
isolation?” Mr. X incorporated the following cognitive reappraisal statements and techniques 
into his treatment: “Anxiety is not helping me to solve the problem. It interferes with my 
functioning, contributes to rumination, and prevents me from enjoying life” (utility of 
negative emotions). “Distancing myself from anxiety by shifting my attention to something 
else is helpful to me” (distancing from the emotional experience). “The tension between me 
and my wife is understandable under the significant amount of stress that we’re facing” 
(reappraisal of the emotional trigger). “She still loves me, cares for me, and is looking out 
for my well-being” (reappraisal of the emotional response). “Being isolated from my friends 
and family reinforces the anxiety and other negative emotions” (reappraisal of the emotional 
response). “These negative emotions were responsible for my previous suicide attempt, 
which was devastating for me and my family” (reappraisal of the emotional response).”

The CRISP therapist practiced the techniques in the office and rated their effectiveness in 
reducing Mr. X’s negative emotions. The therapist incorporated the most successful 
strategies into: a) a written list of techniques that the patient kept in his notebook; and b) the 
WellPATH app and recorded a video, in which the therapist described the detrimental effects 
of negative emotions in increasing suicidal ideation and emphasizing the importance of 
utilizing the techniques to reduce negative emotions. The patient was trained in how to use 
the WellPATH app, took the tablet with him and agreed that when the negative emotions 
become overwhelming, he would go to the tablet to help him utilize the techniques. Mr. X 
agreed to use both the list and the WellPATH app, and confirmed that if these did not help, 
he would make a phone call to the therapist. He successfully used the list but did not use the 
WellPATH app as he was not comfortable with technology. He used the CRISP strategies for 
12 weekly sessions weeks, improved his cognitive reappraisal [(as evidenced by improved 
score on the Reappraisal Subscale of Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)], reduced 
his negative emotions (by self-report) and prevented an increase in suicidal ideation or

suicide risk over 24 weeks. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire[46] is a self-report 
assessing two aspects of emotion regulation, cognitive reappraisal and suppression.

DISCUSSION

Psychosocial interventions can reduce deliberate self-harm and suicide risk after hospital 
discharge[47]. However, the mechanism of action through which psychosocial interventions 
reduce suicide risk is unknown[48]. Based on the observations that stressors from recent life 
events[49] (e.g. unemployment, recent loss) and negative emotions (including sadness, 
anxiety, shame, hopelessness and anger) related to these stressors are associated with 
suicidal behavior[50,51], CRISP focuses on the triggers and stressors that contribute to 
negative emotions that lead to the suicide attempt before the hospitalization. We assume that 
the stressors and negative emotions that contributed to the suicide-related hospitalization 
remain a significant factor for risk of suicide post-discharge, especially since the period with 
the highest suicide risk is within 3 months post-discharge.

The case study highlights the main stages of CRISP and the use of its techniques. First, the 
CRISP therapist identified the triggers of the “emotional storm” that led to the suicide 
attempt. The therapist carefully revisited the days that led to the suicide attempt and 
highlighted the triggers and the associated negative emotions leading to the suicide attempt. 
As soon as the triggers and the negative emotions were identified, the therapist focused 
mainly on those triggers and devised a plan to reduce the associated negative emotions by 
using cognitive reappraisal techniques. Additional negative emotions that were not directly 
associated with suicidal ideation or the suicide attempt could have been addressed but only 
after the main triggers of negative emotions and suicidal ideation were explored.

Clinically, the patient and the therapist work through the following CRISP stages. First, the 
patient, with the help of the therapist, identifies negative emotions related to suicidal 
ideation or previous suicide attempts and their triggers. Clinical data from the use of PATH 
techniques in older adults demonstrate that identifying emotions is easier for patients than 
identifying or observing their thoughts. Second, the patient records the intensity (on a scale 
of 1–10) and duration of these emotions and what can reduce them. Third, the patient and 
the therapist devise a plan and specify cognitive reappraisal techniques (Table 1) to reduce 
the negative emotions. Clinical experience reveal that patients are able to monitor and 
evaluate the degree of change (reduction or increase) of negative emotions, which facilitates 
the evaluation of the effectiveness of the CRISP techniques.

Executive dysfunction and poor problem solving skills have been found in depressed 
patients with suicidal ideation and history of suicide attempts[52]. During the “emotional 
storm,” patients with executive dysfunction and poor problem solving skills – who are at 
high risk for suicide - may not have the cognitive capacity to generate appropriate cognitive 
reappraisal techniques. However, the CRISP therapist and the patient can generate these 
techniques in session and practice them repeatedly so that the patient may use them when 
exposed to emotional distress in their everyday life. Recent data from the utilization of these 
techniques reveal that CRISP techniques may reduce the intensity of negative emotions by 
half even in patients with mild executive dysfunction[53].

Utilization of a tablet is an alternative way to reduce negative emotions in between sessions. 
By providing alternative solutions for the reduction of negative emotions during 
emotionally-charged situations, WellPATH allows the use of techniques even in patients who 
are not technologically sophisticated. This is important as the group with the highest suicide 
rate is white males over the age of 85; this age group may not use of technology as 
frequently as younger adults. As the current cohort of middle-aged get older, more patients 
may be willing to use technology in their treatment, which can be helpful as standalone or in 
conjunction with treatment[54]. Unique features of WellPATH are the identification of 
personalized techniques by both the patient and therapist, the practice of techniques in the 
office before they are incorporated into the tablet[55], and the evaluation of the effectiveness 
of the techniques as they are applied by the patients using the tablet.

Further development of CRISP can be informed by stakeholder input (e.g. service users, 
family members, clinicians) and by affective neuroscience findings. Significant figures in a 
patient’s life may provide information about the meaning of specific events to the patients, 
taking into consideration the patient’s history and psychosocial context. Such information 
can inform CRISP’s cognitive reappraisal interventions and increase the likelihood that the 
patient may incorporate his/her new views in his/her life. Advances in affective neuroscience 
may improve the targeting of CRISP’s cognitive reappraisal interventions. Recent findings 
of decision neuroscience research suggest that deficits in cognitive reappraisal may result 
from an incorrect estimation of a person’s life circumstances leading to impaired decision 
making[56]. In suicide attempters, impaired decision-making parallels disrupted expected 
value in reward signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Behavioral studies have linked 
increased delay discounting of rewards to low-lethality/poorly planned attempts and multiple 
attempts. In contrast, high-lethality suicide attempts have been associated with intact delay 
discounting but impaired social decision-making[57] and a distinct pattern of cognitive 
inhibition deficits[58]. A meta-analysis of neuropsychological and fMRI studies showed that 
abnormalities in fronto-limbic circuits are associated with vulnerability to suicide 
independently of any associated psychopathological conditions including depression[59] ; 
these circuits are implicated in cognitive reappraisal[60,61].

In conclusion, our psychosocial intervention targets cognitive reappraisal to reduce suicide 
risk in middle-aged and older adults who have been recently hospitalized for suicidal 
ideation or suicide attempt. We focus on middle-aged and older adults because suicide rates 
in these groups are alarmingly high. CRISP focuses on the first 3 months post-discharge 
because this is the period with elevated suicide rates after hospitalization. It identifies 
triggers of negative emotions related to suicidal ideation or previous suicide attempts, and 
employs cognitive reappraisal techniques to reduce these negative emotions. Our cognitive 
reappraisal techniques, originated from affective neuroscience literature, have been selected 
from different psychosocial interventions (e.g., CBT, DBT, PATH) and have been simplified 
for use in middle-aged and older adults. Since psychosocial interventions focusing on 
middle-aged and older adults who have been recently hospitalized for suicidality are sparse, 
we hope that CRISP may reduce suicide risk at the post-discharge period where the patients 
are particularly vulnerable to suicide.

Cognitive Reappraisal Intervention for Suicide Prevention (CRISP): Main Stages and Techniques

TABLE 1

Stage

Techniques

Identification of the 
“perfect storm”

Identification of 
situations/triggers 
and negative 
emotions and 
thoughts

Overview: After obtaining information from the patient, the therapist provides a realistic explanation of the path to 
suicidality (suicidal ideation or suicide attempt) that led to the current hospitalization. The goal is to help the patient 
understand the factors that may have contributed to increased suicidality (suicidal ideation or behavior). To understand 
the contributing factors, the CRISP therapist creates a path that describes the association of situations/triggers, 
emotions, and suicidal ideation or behavior. In addition, the therapist incorporates other risk and protective factors. The 
patient and the therapist work through each step of the path and identify areas and time points at which they could have 
intervened.

Overview: The therapist asks the patient to identify situations/triggers and negative emotions that preceded, are related 
or linked to recent and past incidents of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. Triggers can be external or internal events, 
concerns, or problems. Even if the patient cannot identify a specific emotion, the therapist focuses on the emotional 
experience that is related to the trigger.

Pertinent Questions and Suggestions

•

•

•

•

•

•

When did you have suicidal thoughts or actions (e.g., wishes that you were dead or thoughts about 
hurting or killing yourself)?

What was the situation/trigger that precipitated suicidal thoughts and actions?

What were the emotions that were associated with this situation/trigger?

Did you have any physical symptoms?

Did you have these emotions and thoughts from the beginning of the day?

Let’s walk through the last few days before your suicide attempt. This way we may better understand 
how situations, negative emotions and associated thoughts may have contributed to your suicide attempt.

Examination of the 
utility of negative 
emotions

Overview: The purpose of this stage is to understand the patient’s perspective on negative emotions and to explore the 
patient’s motivation to reduce these negative emotions. The examination starts by identifying the positive and negative 
aspects of these negative emotions.

Pertinent Questions and Suggestions

•

•

•

How much do negative emotions affect your everyday life? How much do they contribute to your 
thoughts of wishing you were dead or of harming or killing yourself?

What do you gain or lose from having these feelings?

How would it be helpful or not helpful if you reduce these negative emotions?

Reappraisal of an 
emotional trigger

Overview: The therapist systematically evaluates and helps the patient change perspective on the emotional trigger, for 
example, all aspects of the trigger, positive and negative perspectives of the trigger.

Pertinent Questions and Suggestions

•

•

•

•

•

•

What are all the aspects of the situation/problem/concern?

What is a positive perspective of the situation/problem/concern?

What is a negative perspective of the situation/problem/concern?

Do you think that you perceive all aspects of the situation/problem/concern logically and accurately?

Do the negative emotions make you see in a much more negative way? How?

What is the worst part of the situation? What do you think can get better? What can’t get better?

Distancing (shifting 
away) from the 
emotional experience

Overview:“Distancing” is a cognitive reappraisal strategy which“involves changing one’s construal of an emotional 
event by increasing or decreasing one’s psychological distance from it”.30,39,42 To successfully apply this strategy, the 
therapist helps the patient perceive a situation or the emotional experience from an objective point of view.39,42

Pertinent Questions and Suggestions

•

•

•

Let’s see how other people close to you perceive this situation.

Is there anyone’s perspective that you respect or even admire? What would that person think or say? 
How would he or she have perceived the situation?

If your friend was facing similar situation, what would you say to him or her?

Stage

Techniques

•

•

Let’s describe the situation from an author’s perspective who is writing a book.

Can you find a way to create distance from your emotions by shifting your attention away from the 
situation?

Reappraisal of the 
emotional response 
to the trigger

Overview: The therapist and the patient explore the patient’s emotional reaction to the situation. The therapist may 
identify ways to change the patient’s perspective to reduce the patient’s negative emotional response.

Pertinent Questions and Suggestions

•

•

•

•

•

•

Fully describe your negative emotions. How strong are the negative feelings? Is the intensity of the 
negative emotions high? How high on a scale of 1–10, 10 is the worse?

Is the emotional response proportionate to the situation?

◦ If the intensity of your negative feelings is proportionate to the situation you are facing, what can 
you do to reduce your feelings and improve the situation? What could be alternative ways to react?

◦ If the intensity of your negative feelings is not proportionate to the situation, what can we say to 

reduce the intensity of these feelings?

◦ If your negative feelings are not proportionate to the situation, how much can you trust your 
feelings to guide you? How much do you believe that the feelings will lead you to the right 
decision or direction?

What part of your emotional response may be stronger than expected by you or others? Are the negative 
emotions stronger than what the situation calls for?

How might other people that you respect react to the situation? Let’s examine the emotional response 
from their point of view. What can we learn from this?

How might these peoples’ reaction guide us to react to the situation?

How have you tried to reduce your negative feelings? Which ways were successful? Which were 
unsuccessful?

Notes: The stages of treatment do not need to be followed sequentially, even though some of the stages appear to precipitate others. For example, it 
makes sense to evaluate the utility of negative emotions before you devise a plan with techniques to reduce them. Nevertheless, the therapist and the 
patient will work collaboratively to apply the stages necessary to reduce the negative emotions and their impact.
