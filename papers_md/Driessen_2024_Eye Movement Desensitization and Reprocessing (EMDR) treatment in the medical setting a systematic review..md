HIGHLIGHTS
(cid:129) First overview on the use
of EMDR for adult patients
treated in the medical
setting.

(cid:129) EMDR seems beneﬁcial in
improving psychological
and physical symptoms.
(cid:129) Given the heterogeneity of
studies and high risk of
bias, further controlled
studies are needed in this
ﬁeld.

ABSTRACT
Background: Literature points towards the potential beneﬁts of the application of Eye
Movement and Desensitization Processing (EMDR)-therapy for patients in the medical
setting, with cancer and pain being among the domains it is applied to. The ﬁeld of
applying EMDR-therapy for patients treated in the medical setting has evolved to such an
extent that it may be challenging to get a comprehensive overview.
Objective: This systematic literature review aims to evaluate the use and eﬀectiveness of Eye
Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in patients treated in the medical
setting.
Methods: We performed a literature search following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were
included if the eﬀectiveness of EMDR-therapy was assessed in adult patients treated in a
medical setting. Excluded were patients exclusively suﬀering from a mental health disorder,
without somatic comorbidity. A risk of bias analysis was performed. This review was
registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022325238).
Results: Eighty-seven studies, of which 26 (pilot)-RCTs were included and categorized in 14
medical domains. Additionally, three studies focusing on persistent physical complaints
were included. Most evidence exists for its application in the ﬁelds of oncology, pain, and
neurology. The overall appraisal of these studies showed at least moderate to high risks of
bias. EMDR demonstrated eﬀectiveness in reducing symptoms in 85 out of 87 studies.
Notably, the occurrence of adverse events was rarely mentioned.
Conclusions: Overall, outcomes seem to show beneﬁcial eﬀects of EMDR on reducing
psychological and physical symptoms in patients treated in a medical setting. Due to the
heterogeneity of reported outcomes, eﬀect sizes could not be pooled. Due to the high risk
of bias of the included studies, our results should be interpreted with caution and further
controlled high-quality research is needed.

Tratamiento de desensibilización y reprocesamiento por movimientos
oculares (EMDR) en el ámbito médico: una revisión sistemática
Antecedentes: La literatura apunta a los beneﬁcios potenciales de la aplicación de la terapia de
Desensibilización y Reprocesamiento por Movimientos Oculares (EMDR) para pacientes en el
ámbito médico, siendo el cáncer y el dolor algunos de los dominios a los que se aplica. El
campo de la aplicación de la terapia EMDR para pacientes tratados en el ámbito medico ha
evolucionado hasta tal punto que puede resultar complicado obtener una visión general completa.
Objetivo: Esta revisión sistemática de la literatura tiene como objetivo evaluar el uso y la eﬁcacia de
la terapia de Desensibilización y Reprocesamiento por Movimientos Oculares (EMDR) en pacientes
tratados en el ámbito médico.
Métodos: Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográﬁca siguiendo las guías PRISMA. Se incluyeron los
estudios que evaluaban la eﬁcacia de la terapia EMDR en pacientes adultos tratados en un
contexto médico. Se excluyeron los pacientes que padecían exclusivamente un trastorno de
salud mental, sin comorbilidad somática. Se realizó un análisis de riesgo de sesgo. Esta revisión
se registró en PROSPERO (CRD42022325238).
Resultados: Se incluyeron 87 estudios, de los cuales 26 ECA (piloto) y se clasiﬁcaron en 14
dominios médicos. Además, se incluyeron tres estudios centrados en quejas físicas persistentes.
La mayoría de las evidencias existen para su aplicación en los campos de la oncología, el dolor y
la neurología. La valoración global de estos estudios mostró al menos riesgos de sesgo de
moderados a altos. La EMDR demostró eﬁcacia en la reducción de los síntomas en 85 de 87
estudios. En particular, rara vez se mencionó la aparición de eventos adversos.
Conclusiones: En general, los resultados parecen mostrar efectos beneﬁciosos de la EMDR en la
reducción de los síntomas psicológicos y físicos en pacientes tratados en un contexto médico.

Debido a la heterogeneidad de los resultados informados, no fue posible agrupar los tamaños del
efecto. Debido al alto riesgo de sesgo de los estudios incluidos, los resultados deben interpretarse
con cautela y se necesita investigación adicional controlada de alta calidad.

1. Introduction

The medical setting is characterized by people who
have experienced adverse health-related, and some-
times even life-threatening events, which may lead to
the development of post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) or PTSD related symptoms. Eye Movement
and Desensitization Processing (EMDR)-therapy has
proven to be an eﬀective psychological treatment
and is recommended as treatment of choice in mul-
tiple international guidelines for post-traumatic stress
disorder, such as the NICE and APA-guidelines
(Association AP, 2017; Excellence NIfHaC).

EMDR-therapy was developed in the eighties of the
last century by Francine Shapiro (Shapiro, 1989). Lat-
est meta-analyses on the eﬀectiveness of EMDR-
therapy in treating patients with PTSD, show that
the therapy is equally eﬀective as cognitive behavioural
therapy (CBT) (Grubaugh et al., 2021; Hudays et al.,
2022). The 2020 meta-analysis on the eﬀects of
EMDR-therapy for mental health problems of Cuij-
pers et al. included trials only, and found a large
eﬀect size of EMDR-therapy for PTSD (g = 0.93)
(Cuijpers et al., 2020). However, risk of bias was
found to be high, which compromised the eﬀects
found. These results seem to contrast somewhat with
the ﬁndings of the more recent network meta-analysis
of Yunitri et al. (2023), that found that both cognitive
processing therapy and EMDR-therapy were consist-
ently in the upper quartile as the most eﬀective
therapies for reducing PTSD symptoms at immediate
post-treatment, short-term and long-term follow-up
(Yunitri et al., 2023). In addition, EMDR-therapy
was also among the most eﬀective therapies in terms
of loss of PTSD diagnosis. Still, also these authors
warn for conclusion too ﬁrm on EMDR (and the
other therapies) and point towards the relevance of
further study of factors such as the combination of
various PTSD therapies and the therapist-patient
relationship. Broadening the scope to mental health
problems other that PTSD, Cuijpers et al. found that
the amount and quality of studies was insuﬃcient to
pool outcomes. Scelles and Bulnes (2021), who also
studied the eﬀects of EMDR-therapy on conditions
other than PTSD, did not limit their search to con-
trolled trials, which led them to include 90 papers
(Scelles & Bulnes, 2021). Although there was an over-
all positive outlook of EMDR as treatment option,
they, like Cuijpers et al. also concluded that the meth-
odology of many studies fell short. These recent ana-
lyses underline that currently suﬃcient evidence

exists for the application of EMDR for PTSD, but
not for other, mental health conditions.

The study of Scelles and Bulnes (2021) already points
towards the potential beneﬁts of applying EMDR in the
medical setting, as cancer and pain are among the
domains of conditions included (next to for instance
mood disorders, anxiety disorders, sexual disorders,
addiction and eating disorders). So, the idea of the
application of EMDR-therapy in the medical setting is
not new. The standard EMDR-therapy protocol as
developed by Francine Shapiro consists of 8 phases:
1. History and treatment plan; 2. Introduction to
EMDR protocol, and development of coping strategies;
3. Evaluation of the treatment targets; 4. Desensitization
and reprocessing; 5. Incorporation of positive cogni-
tions; 6. Body scan; 7. Relaxation and 8. Re-evaluation
(Shapiro, 2007). All of these phases are important, but
within the context of EMDR-application in the medical
setting, especially phases 1. and 3. referring to the con-
ceptualization of the case are of major importance.
Maybe more so than with EMDR-therapy for ‘just’
PTSD, the question is following which line of reasoning
are speciﬁc memories (or images of future catastro-
phies) thought to be of inﬂuence on current complaints
and symptoms. With this in mind, it may not be that
surprising that speciﬁc EMDR protocols have developed
in the more somatic-oriented context over time.

Luber has summarized treatment protocols for a
variety of medical conditions such as cancer, multiple
sclerosis, and pain (Luber, 2019). Also, Francine Sha-
piro herself wrote an article on the role EMDR-
therapy could play in the medical setting, in which
she described how both psychological and physical
symptoms could stem from adverse life events (Sha-
piro, 2014). Indeed it was found that a history of
adverse childhood experiences can result in complex
clinical proﬁles with several co-occurring mental and
somatic disorders (Herzog & Schmahl, 2018). Next
to these
applying
EMDR-therapy in the medical setting, there are also
practical reasons. First, EMDR-therapy may result in
more rapid eﬀects compared to other types of trauma
therapy (McPhail, 2016; Nijdam et al., 2012; Wammes
et al., 2018), this makes EMDR-therapy especially sui-
ted for the medical setting. This is because medical
psychological care is in essence related and often lim-
ited to the somatic care patients receive, which may
make that psychological care has to be ‘ﬁtted in’ in a
time frame. Second, an advantage of
particular

etiology-related reasons

for

EMDR-therapy over other types of therapy, in particu-
lar trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy is
that patients are not assigned homework exercises.
This is an advantage, because often somatic com-
plaints have such an impact on daily life that for
many people it is too much of a burden to carry out
all kinds of tasks in addition.

Over time, the ﬁeld of applying EMDR-therapy for
patients treated in the medical setting has further
evolved, to such an extent that it may be diﬃcult to
get a comprehensive overview. Therefore, this study
aims to provide a complete, contemporary and state-
of-the-art overview of available applications and eﬀec-
treated
tiveness of EMDR-therapy for patients
throughout the medical setting.

2. Methods

2.1. Protocol and Registration

and

advance

The protocol for this systematic review was speciﬁed
PROSPERO
registered
in
(CRD42022325238). The present study was performed
according to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic
reviews (Moher et al., 2010).

on

2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Articles were included if they focused on evaluating
the eﬀectiveness of EMDR treatment on adult patients
with (1) somatic symptoms, including patients with
psychological problems stemming from their somatic
symptoms, and if patients were (2) treated in a medical
setting (including hospitals, extramural specialized
clinics and private clinics, in which the treatment
can be extrapolated to hospitals), and (3) outcomes
used to measure the eﬀectiveness of the EMDR inter-
vention were reported. No restrictions were made
regarding the outcome measures study design. Proto-
cols that included real-life cases of patients were also
eligible for inclusion. Excluded were articles that
focused on the eﬀectiveness of EMDR (i) in patients
exclusively suﬀering from psychological complaints,
(ii) in patients with eating disorders, (iii) solely in
the patients’ relatives or caregivers, (iv) in children
and adolescents, and (v) on healthcare providers.
Also excluded were (vi) articles wherein patients
were treated with Eye Movement (EM) or Eye Move-
ment Desensitization (EMD), (vii) if EMDR-therapy
was combined with, or was integrated into a treatment
programme that
included multiple types of psy-
chotherapy and the eﬀects of EMDR-therapy alone
could not be evaluated. Studies were also excluded if
(viii) the treatment was provided in military hospitals,
if (ix) no outcome was reported, e.g. protocols without
cases, and if (x) no full text could be retrieved, even
after repeated eﬀort. Further, (xi) poster abstracts

were excluded. There were no restrictions regarding
the date of publication, nor were there restrictions
on the language the articles were written.

2.3. Search terms and databases

The main search terms were ‘Eye Movement Desensiti-
zation Reprocessing’, ‘Post Traumatic Stress Disorders’,
‘Depression’, and ‘Anxiety’. This search was applied to
Embase.com (1971-present), Medline ALL Ovid (1946–
present), Web of Science Core Collection (1975–pre-
sent), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(1992–present), and PsycINFO Ovid (1806–present).
The ﬁnal search was run on 18 April 2023. The full
search strategy is reported in Supplementary Table
1. Furthermore, the reference lists of all relevant studies
were checked to ﬁnd additional studies.

2.4. Procedures

Two reviewers (HD, SM) screened all article titles and
abstracts for relevance. If the title and abstract were
considered relevant regarding the aim of our study,
the article was included for the assessment of the full
text. In case of disagreement,
the two reviewers
aimed to reach a consensus. In case this turned out
to be diﬃcult, a third reviewer was involved to come
to a conclusion (LK). All included papers were read
by two reviewers (HD, SM) to assess whether the
studies were eligible for inclusion, based on the
above-mentioned criteria. Again, in case of disagree-
ment, the two reviewers aimed to reach a consensus.
A third reviewer (LK) was involved to come to a con-
clusion, in case consensus proved diﬃcult. Included
reviews were screened for relevant articles. Relevant
articles found in the reviews were included and
assessed individually in the current study. The risk
of bias of the studies was assessed with appropriate
instruments according to their study design:
the
Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, ver-
sion 2 (ROB-II) (Sterne et al., 2019), the Risk Of
Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions
(ROBINS-I) tool (Sterne et al., 2016), the IHE (Insti-
tute of Health Economics) Quality Appraisal Checklist
for Case Series Studies ((IHE) IoHE, 2014), and the
Johnna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Check-
list for Case Reports (Moola et al., 2024).

2.5. Data extraction

Two authors (HD, SM) evaluated and extracted the
data of all included studies. The information was dis-
cussed by three authors (HD, SM, LK). Information
was extracted regarding the (1) type of study design,
(2) involved medical domain and illness, (3) medical
setting in which patients were treated, (4) whether
patients were inpatients or outpatients, (5) additional

diagnoses, (6) treatment and treatment schedules, (7)
outcomes and outcome measures to assess the eﬀec-
tiveness of the intervention, and (8) reported results
for every outcome.

3. Results

3.1. Study selection

A total of 5538 studies were retrieved from databases,
and ten additional articles were identiﬁed through
cross-referencing. A total of 3135 studies were eligible
for screening after duplicates were removed and even-
tually 368 studies were assessed for eligibility for
inclusion. One hundred three studies were considered
eligible of which 87 studies were included. Sixteen
studies were reviews and are not discussed as these
reviews have a diﬀerent focus of attention compared
to our review, except for one review in which a case
study is described (Baas et al., 2020). Details of these
reviews are described in Supplementary Table 2 for
the sake of completeness (Cope et al., 2018; Dimitrov
et al., 2019; Faretta, 2018; Haerizadeh et al., 2020; Luy-
ten, van Rompaey, et al., 2020; Miller et al., 2021; Por-
tigliatti Pomeri et al., 2020; Ruisch et al., 2023; Ryan
et al., 2022; Sato-Perry, 2004; Staton et al., 2022; Tesarz
et al., 2014, 2019; van Rood & de Roos, 2009; Wicking
et al., 2017). If the full text of the studies was not

retrievable via standard electronic subscriptions of
the Erasmus Medical Center academic library, we
sent an international request to other libraries. If
that also failed, we approached the authors by email.
Procedures and search results are described in Figure 1
and Supplementary Table 2.

3.2. Study characteristics

An overview of the characteristics of the 87 articles
included is given in Supplementary Table 3. The result
section of this review consists of general results and
results categorized per medical domain. All studies
reported pre- and post-treatment measurements.
The study designs and the reported outcomes were
found to be heterogeneous and, consequently, a
meta-analysis was not performed.

3.3. General results

Twenty-six (pilot-)RCTs, 22 case reports, 20 non-ran-
domized clinical studies, and 19 case series are included
and are categorized into 14 medical domains: see Sup-
plementary Tables 4A-4O. Eighty-ﬁve of 87 studies
found favourable eﬀects of EMDR-therapy within mul-
tiple domains and outcomes. Only two studies, within
the ﬁeld of gynaecology, reported either no beneﬁcial

eﬀects or that the beneﬁcial eﬀects did not remain over
time (Jebelli et al., 2018; Valedi et al., 2022). All but one
of the RCTs found signiﬁcant favourable eﬀects of
EMDR-therapy pre- and post-treatment. Ten RCTs
compared EMDR to no treatment/waiting list: seven
studies found signiﬁcant diﬀerences between EMDR-
therapy and waiting list controls in favour of EMDR-
two studies reported signiﬁcant beneﬁcial
therapy,
eﬀects in both EMDR and waiting list control groups,
and one study did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
both groups (Valedi et al., 2022). Additionally, 18
studies compared the use of EMDR to other treatments.
Eleven studies described signiﬁcant eﬀects of both inter-
ventions of which nine studies reported diﬀerences
between groups in favour of EMDR-therapy. The
remaining six studies reported only signiﬁcant favour-
able eﬀects of EMDR-therapy (Abdi et al., 2021; Arias
Suarez et al., 2020; Borji et al., 2019; Gerhardt et al.,
2016; Rostaminejad et al., 2017; Zolghadr et al., 2019).
Half of all studies described providing EMDR-therapy
exclusively at a (university) hospital (45/87), nine
studies exclusively provided treatment at specialized
clinics, 17 studies described providing treatment at
locations categorized as ‘Other’, e.g. private practices
or online, and ﬁve studies described providing treat-
ment at two diﬀerent settings. The remaining 11 studies
did not describe where the treatment was provided. In
most cases (53/87), treatment was provided to patients
visiting outpatient centres, private practices, and hospi-
tal departments, 18 studies described providing care to
inpatients, two studies described providing care in both
inpatient and outpatient settings, and 14 studies did not
describe whether patients were treated as inpatients or
whether patients visited outpatient locations. Within
the majority of the studies in which the EMDR protocol
type was speciﬁed, the standard protocol for EMDR was
used during treatment. For a few medical conditions
such as pain or tinnitus, a specialized EMDR protocol
was described. The most frequently described outcome
was anxiety, followed by depression, PTSD, and pain
and there was overlap in the outcome measures used:
anxiety was measured using the HADS-A, STAI-Y
and BAI; depression was measured using HADS-D
and BDI(-II); and symptoms of PTSD were measured
using PCL-5, IES-R, and SCID. Further information
regarding additional diagnoses, treatment details, out-
comes and outcome measures to assess the eﬀectiveness
of the intervention, and the reported results for every
outcome are categorized by medical domain and sum-
marized in Supplementary Tables 4A-4O.

3.4. Risk of bias

Most case reports described pre- and post-interven-
tion clinical condition (22/22), assessment methods
(20/22), and treatment procedure (22/22), only a min-
ority reported whether there were adverse events (6/

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

(13/19),

22) (Supplementary Table 5A). Most case series clearly
described patient characteristics (18/19), intervention
(17/19), pre- and post-intervention clinical condition
(17/19), and used appropriate outcome methods (17/
19). The studies did not (fully) report eligibility cri-
teria (13/19), co-interventions
statistical
analysis (14/19), and adverse events (11/19) (Sup-
plementary Table 5B). Most RCTs showed a high
risk of bias (16/26), the minority showed some con-
cerns (10/26). Areas of concern included adherence
to the intervention, the randomization process, and
outcome measurements, mainly due to the subjective
measures used. The non-randomized clinical studies
showed moderate (17/20) or serious (3/20) bias mainly
because of the measurements of outcomes used (Sup-
plementary Table 5C).

3.5. Main ﬁndings per medical domain

3.5.1. Pain
The domain of pain includes 16 studies, divided into
nine studies focusing on phantom pain and seven
studies focusing on chronic pain (Supplementary
Table 4A). The eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy on phantom
pain was evaluated on pain, including intensity and
disability in all nine studies (Brennstuhl et al., 2015;
2017b; de Roos et al., 2010; Flik & de Roos, 2010; Ros-
taminejad et al., 2017; Schneider et al., 2008; 2007;
Sinici, 2016; Wilensky, 2006), the use of pain medi-
cation (Schneider et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2008),
intensity of
sensation (Brennstuhl et al., 2015;
2017b), Quality of Life (QoL) (de Roos et al., 2010),
fatigue (de Roos et al., 2010), psychological problems
and symptoms of psychopathology (de Roos et al.,
2010; Sinici, 2016), emotional distress (Rostaminejad
et al., 2017; Wilensky, 2006), and symptoms of anxiety
(Brennstuhl et al., 2015; Brennstuhl et al., 2017b;
Sinici, 2016), depression (Brennstuhl et al., 2015;
Brennstuhl et al., 2017b; Sinici, 2016; Wilensky,
2006), and PTSD (de Roos et al., 2010; Schneider
et al., 2008; Wilensky, 2006). All studies reported ben-
eﬁcial eﬀects of EMDR-therapy when comparing
measurements before and after
treatment. The
majority (8/9) reported a follow-up up to 40 months
the beneﬁcial eﬀects remained
and reported that
over time. Only one study focusing on phantom
pain was a RCT. The study showed signiﬁcant
reductions of pain intensity and emotional distress
in the EMDR group, whereas the control group
showed signiﬁcant worsened symptoms (Rostamine-
jad et al., 2017).

The eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy in patients suﬀering
from chronic pain was evaluated on pain intensity in
all studies (Arias Suarez et al., 2020; Brennstuhl
et al., 2016; 2017a; Gerhardt et al., 2016; Grant,
2000; Grant & Threlfo, 2002; Mazzola et al., 2010),
on QoL (Arias Suarez et al., 2020; Mazzola et al.,

6

H. P. A. DRIESSEN ET AL.

2010), disability (Gerhardt et al., 2016), patients’ per-
spective of change (Gerhardt et al., 2016), coping
(Grant & Threlfo, 2002), and symptoms of anxiety
(Arias Suarez et al., 2020; Mazzola et al., 2010),
depression (Arias Suarez et al., 2020; Mazzola et al.,
2010), and PTSD (Brennstuhl et al., 2016; 2017a) (Sup-
plementary Table 4A). All studies reported beneﬁcial
eﬀects of EMDR-therapy when comparing measure-
ments before and after treatment. The majority (6/7)
reported a follow-up of up to three months and
reported that the beneﬁcial eﬀects remained over
time. Three out of seven studies that focused on the
eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy on chronic pain were
pilot RCTs. Two out of three pilot RCTs reported ben-
eﬁcial eﬀects of EMDR-therapy over TAU (Arias
Suarez et al., 2020; Gerhardt et al., 2016). The remain-
ing pilot RCT compared an EMDR standard protocol
to an EMDR pain protocol and control psychotherapy
and found beneﬁcial eﬀects of both EMDR protocols
over control therapy, in favour of the standard proto-
col which was found to be signiﬁcantly better com-
pared to the pain protocol (Brennstuhl et al., 2016).

3.5.2. Neurology
Fourteen studies described the eﬃcacy of EMDR-
therapy in neurological disorders and focused on
patients suﬀering from: dementia (Ahmed, 2018;
Amano & Toichi, 2017; van der Wielen et al., 2019),
multiple sclerosis (MS) (Carletto et al., 2016; Wallis
& de Vries, 2020), stroke (Guina & Guina, 2018; Jans-
sen & van Donzel, 2023; Smart, 2022), spinal cord
injury (Hateﬁ et al., 2019; Olędzka et al., 2016),
migraine (Konuk et al., 2011), psychogenic seizures
(Chemali & Meadows, 2004), and concussion-like
symptoms (Gil-Jardine et al., 2018), One study did
not specify which neurological condition the patients
suﬀered from (Gattinara, 2009). See Supplementary
Table 4B. The eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy was evalu-
ated on emotional distress(Gattinara, 2009; Olędzka
et al., 2016; van der Wielen et al., 2019), QoL (Carletto
et al., 2016; Wallis & de Vries, 2020), and symptoms of
depression (Ahmed, 2018; Arabia et al., 2011; Carletto
et al., 2016; Guina & Guina, 2018; Hateﬁ et al., 2019;
Olędzka et al., 2016; Smart, 2022; van der Wielen
et al., 2019; Wallis & de Vries, 2020), anxiety
(Ahmed, 2018; Carletto et al., 2016; Hateﬁ et al.,
2019; Smart, 2022; van der Wielen et al., 2019; Wallis
& de Vries, 2020), worry (Wallis & de Vries, 2020),
cognitive avoidance (Wallis & de Vries, 2020), and
PTSD (Carletto et al., 2016; Gil-Jardine et al., 2018;
Janssen & van Donzel, 2023; Smart, 2022), self-esteem
(Janssen & van Donzel, 2023), and post-traumatic
growth (Smart, 2022). Additionally, multiple studies

patients with MS. All studies reported beneﬁcial
eﬀects of EMDR when comparing measurements
before and after treatment, except for one case study:
the study reported that the symptoms of anxiety and
depression remained consistent although the patient,
suﬀering from Alzheimer’s disease,
subjectively
reported less distress (van der Wielen et al., 2019).
The majority (11/14) reported a follow-up up to 13

(pilot) RCTs included reported beneﬁcial eﬀects of
EMDR-therapy over controls
(Gil-Jardine et al.,
2018; Hateﬁ et al., 2019), and reassurance (Gil-Jardine
et al., 2018), the remaining RCT found beneﬁcial
eﬀects of both interventions: EMDR-therapy and
relaxation therapy (RT) (Carletto et al., 2016).

toms (Capezzani et al., 2013; Carletto et al., 2019; Fare-
tta et al., 2016; Jarero et al., 2015; Jarero et al., 2016;

(Lantheaume, 2018), and sense of coherence level
(Szpringer et al., 2018). All studies reported a ben-

follow-up periods up to six months (Abdi et al.,
2021; Jarero et al., 2015; 2016; 2018; Lantheaume,
2018; Roberts, 2018). Within performed RCTs, the
eﬀect of EMDR-therapy seemed superior to the
eﬀects of TAU (Abdi et al., 2021; Borji et al., 2019; Car-
letto et al., 2019; Jarero et al., 2018; Szpringer et al.,

3.5.4. Obstetrics
Within the domain of obstetrics eight studies reported
on the eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy, mostly after trau-
matic childbirth (6/8): See Supplementary Table 4D
(Chiorino et al., 2020; Kranenburg et al., 2021; Madrid
et al., 2006; Sandström et al., 2008; Stramrood et al.,
2012; Zolghadr et al., 2019). The other two studies
described the use of EMDR-therapy in women with
hyperemesis gravidarum (Kavakci & Yenicesu, 2014)
and anxiety during pregnancy (Baas et al., 2020). All
studies described the eﬀect of EMDR directly post
intervention. Five
studied
women from weeks up to years after EMDR-therapy
(Baas et al., 2020; Chiorino et al., 2020; Kavakci &
Yenicesu, 2014; Madrid et al., 2006; Sandström et al.,
2008). All studies that evaluated on PTSD symptoms
reported a (signiﬁcant) positive eﬀect of EMDR after
treatment (Baas et al., 2020; Chiorino et al., 2020; Kra-
nenburg et al., 2021; Sandström et al., 2008; Stramrood
et al., 2012). Further, one RCT reported no signiﬁcant
eﬀect of one EMDR session on maternal bonding
(Chiorino et al., 2020), where a case study described
a positive eﬀect with six EMDR sessions (Madrid
et al., 2006). Two studies described a positive eﬀect
of EMDR-therapy on pregnancy-related anxiety
(Baas et al., 2020; Zolghadr et al., 2019), of which
one was a RCT (Zolghadr et al., 2019). One RCT eval-
uated on post-partum depressive symptoms, in which
no signiﬁcant eﬀect of one EMDR session was seen
compared to one supportive psychological consul-
tation (Chiorino et al., 2020). In one case series
study, EMDR-therapy seemed eﬀective in reducing
nausea and vomiting in four women with hyperemesis
gravidarum (Kavakci & Yenicesu, 2014).

3.5.5. Otorhinolaryngology
Six studies evaluated the use of EMDR-therapy in tin-
nitus patients: see Supplementary Table 4E. In two
studies, EMDR-therapy was performed after tinnitus
retraining therapy (TRT) (Luyten, Jacquemin, et al.,
2020; Van Der Wal et al., 2020). Tinnitus-related out-
tinnitus-related disability
come measures were:
(D’Andréa et al., 2022; Moore et al., 2020; Phillips
et al., 2019), discomfort and distress (D’Andréa
et al., 2022; Luyten, Jacquemin, et al., 2020; Rikkert
et al., 2018; Van Der Wal et al., 2020), and loudness
(Luyten, Jacquemin, et al., 2020). Additionally, the
eﬀect on depression and anxiety was studied (Luyten,
Jacquemin, et al., 2020; Moore et al., 2020; Phillips
et al., 2019). Overall, EMDR treatment was shown to
have a positive eﬀect on tinnitus-related outcomes in
all studies. The eﬀect remained during follow-up up
to six months (Luyten,
Jacquemin, et al., 2020;
Moore et al., 2020; Phillips et al., 2019; Rikkert et al.,

2018; Van Der Wal et al., 2020). In one RCT, the
eﬀect of EMDR-therapy was not superior to the
eﬀect of CBT (Luyten, Jacquemin, et al., 2020). One
interventional study described no signiﬁcant eﬀect
on depression and anxiety (Moore et al., 2020),
whereas one RCT measured a reduction of anxiety
and depression (Luyten, Jacquemin, et al., 2020), and
one interventional study described only a reduction
of depressive symptoms (Phillips et al., 2019). Further,
one case study described a positive eﬀect of EMDR-
therapy on vision, anxiety and distress in a patient
with daytime blindness (Dilara Altunbaş, 2018).

3.5.6. Rheumatology
Two studies described the eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (Nia et al.,
2018; 2019), and three studies in ﬁbromyalgia patients
(Kavakci et al., 2010; 2012; Teneycke, 2015): see Sup-
plementary Table 4F. In two RCT studies, the eﬀect
of EMDR-therapy was compared to guided imagery
in RA patients (Nia et al., 2018; 2019). Pain and
insomnia were measured before and two weeks after
treatment without follow-up. For both measurements,
there was a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial eﬀect of EMDR-
therapy, superior to guided imagery. Two multiple
case studies and one case study described the eﬀect
of EMDR-therapy on ﬁbromyalgia patients (Kavakci
et al., 2010; 2012; Teneycke, 2015). EMDR-therapy
was evaluated on physical symptoms (ﬁbromyalgia
symptoms and pain) and psychological symptoms
(PTDS symptoms, depression, sleep and anger con-
trol). Overall, there was a reduction in physical as
well as psychological symptoms after EMDR treat-
ment in those three studies.

3.5.7. Pulmonary medicine
Five studies focused on the eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy
in pulmonary disorders:
four studies focused on
COVID-19 and one study on COPD (Supplementary
Table 4G). The eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy was evalu-
ated on symptoms of distress (Brennstuhl et al.,
2022; Dinapoli et al., 2023; Mooren et al., 2022),
anxiety (Bates et al., 2022; Brennstuhl et al., 2022;
Mooren et al., 2022), depression (Bates et al., 2022;
Brennstuhl et al., 2022; Mooren et al., 2022), PTSD
(Bates et al., 2022; Yurtsever et al., 2022), fear (Brenn-
stuhl et al., 2022), dissociative disorders (Dinapoli
et al., 2023), dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function
and mastery (Mooren et al., 2022), QoL (Bates et al.,
2022; Mooren et al., 2022), resilience (Bates et al.,
2022), and appetite and predicted weight (Bates
et al., 2022). Additionally, one study conducted inter-
views (Mooren et al., 2022) and one study evaluated
the feasibility of delivering online therapy (Bates
et al., 2022). All studies found signiﬁcant beneﬁcial
eﬀects of EMDR-therapy when comparing measure-
ments before and directly after treatment, although

remained at follow-up (Bates et al., 2022; Brennstuhl

compared EMDR + TAU to TAU and found signiﬁ-
cant improvements in the EMDR + TAU group but
did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between groups
(Bates et al., 2022).

studies

3.5.8. Cardiology
Four studies described the use of EMDR-therapy in
cardiac events and all studies were (pilot-)RCTs: see
Supplementary Table 4H. One study focused on the
eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy in cardiac events and the
speciﬁcally focused on
remaining three
patients who have suﬀered a myocardial infarction
(MI). The eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy was evaluated
on symptoms of anxiety (Arabia et al., 2011; Moradi
et al., 2016; Zeighami et al., 2018), depression (Arabia
et al., 2011; Behnammoghadam et al., 2015), and
PTSD (Arabia et al., 2011). All studies reported signiﬁ-
cant beneﬁcial eﬀects of EMDR-therapy when com-
paring measurements before and after treatment.
Moreover, signiﬁcantly greater eﬀects of EMDR-
therapy were found compared to other treatments,
including Imaginal Exposure (Arabia et al., 2011),
CBT (Zeighami et al., 2018), and control groups (Beh-
nammoghadam et al., 2015; Moradi et al., 2016; Zeigh-
ami et al., 2018), which remained during follow-up.
Some studies reported that other treatments (Arabia
et al., 2011; Zeighami et al., 2018) and control groups
(Moradi et al., 2016) also showed signiﬁcant beneﬁcial
eﬀects. Conversely, one study reported a signiﬁcant
increase of symptoms in the control group compared
to pre-treatment measurements (Behnammoghadam
et al., 2015).

3.5.9. Gynaecology
Three studies described the eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy
on gynaecologic conditions: see Supplementary Table
4I. Two studies focused on sexual functionality and
speciﬁcally concentrated on women with vaginismus
(Jebelli et al., 2018; Torun, 2010). The third study
focused on participants suﬀering from dysmenorrhoea
(Valedi et al., 2022). All studies described a follow-up
period. The eﬃcacy of EMDR was evaluated on symp-
toms of anxiety (Jebelli et al., 2018; Torun, 2010;
Valedi et al., 2022), sexual functioning (Jebelli et al.,
2018), emotional distress (Torun, 2010), dysfunctional
beliefs (Torun, 2010), QoL (Jebelli et al., 2018), and
sexual satisfaction (Jebelli et al., 2018). Two studies
found beneﬁcial eﬀects of EMDR-therapy when com-
paring measurements before and directly after treat-
ment (Jebelli et al., 2018; Torun, 2010), of which one
study reported that the results did not remain at fol-
low-up (Jebelli et al., 2018). One RCT study that
focused on dysmenorrhoea compared EMDR-therapy
to no interventions did not ﬁnd a statistically and

clinically signiﬁcant eﬀect of EMDR (Valedi et al.,
2022).

3.5.10. Dentistry
Three studies focused on the eﬃcacy of EMDR-
therapy on dental problems of which one study
focused on psychological problems caused by idio-
pathic pain and two focused on dental phobia: see
Supplementary Table 4J. The eﬃcacy of EMDR-
therapy was evaluated on dental anxiety and fear (de
Jongh et al., 2002; Doering et al., 2013), psychological
problems (de Jongh et al., 2002; Gorisse et al., 2010),
psychological trauma (de Jongh et al., 2002), severity
of dental phobia (de Jongh et al., 2002), and symptoms
of anxiety, depression, and PTSD (Doering et al.,
2013). All studies found signiﬁcant beneﬁcial eﬀects
of EMDR-therapy when comparing measurements
before and after treatment, and during follow-up. A
RCT focused on dental phobia and compared
EMDR-therapy to waitlist and found that EMDR-
therapy showed signiﬁcant
in dental
anxiety.

3.5.11. Dermatology
Two studies focused on the eﬃcacy of EMDR-
therapy in dermatologic disorders, of which one
study speciﬁcally focused on atopic dermatitis: see
Supplementary Table 4 K. Both studies reported ben-
eﬁcial eﬀects of EMDR-therapy which remained over
time at follow-up. The case study reported improve-
ments
of PTSD,
depression, and anxiety, and itching behaviour
(Yasar et al., 2022). A multiple case study reported
improvements in all patients with dermatological
disorders in terms of dermatologic symptoms and
emotional distress (Gupta & Gupta, 2002).

3.5.12. Persistent physical complaints
In three studies, the eﬀect of EMDR-therapy was
described in patients with persistent physical com-
plaints without a somatic substrate, namely body dys-
morphic disorder (BDD) (Brown et al., 1997), somatic
symptom disorder (Demirci et al., 2017), and chronic
fatigue syndrome (Royle, 2008): see Supplementary
Table 4L. A multiple case study showed a positive
eﬀect of EMDR-therapy on BDD symptomatology in
six out of seven included patients. The positive eﬀect
remained during follow-up (one year) (Brown et al.,
1997). One RCT compared EMDR-therapy to
pharmacological treatment with duloxetine in patients
with somatic symptom disorder. Both interventions
showed a statistically signiﬁcant reduction of somati-
zation, anxiety and depression, with a superior eﬀect
of EMDR-therapy (Demirci et al., 2017). A case
study found favourable eﬀects of EMDR-therapy in a
patient with chronic fatigue syndrome: there was a

reduced need for sleep and energy levels were higher,
which remained at follow-up (Royle, 2008).

3.5.13. Internal medicine
A RCT focused on the eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy com-
pared to control on the fear of hypoglycaemia among
patients with type II diabetes mellitus (Sheikhi et al.,
2020). They found a signiﬁcant reduction of fear of
hypoglycaemia in the EMDR group compared to the
pre-intervention levels and to the control group,
which remained at
follow-up: see Supplementary
Table 4M.

3.5.14. Nephrology
One RCT evaluated the eﬀectiveness of EMDR-
therapy compared to a control group on anxiety and
depression in patients that received haemodialysis
(Rahimi et al., 2019). The study found a signiﬁcant
reduction of the symptoms of anxiety and depression
in the EMDR group compared to the pre-intervention
levels and to the control group, two weeks post-inter-
vention: see Supplementary Table 4N.

3.5.15. Intensive care unit
One case study described a positive eﬀect, lasting up to
four months after treatment, of online performed
EMDR-therapy on depression, anxiety and QoL in a
patient who survived ICU admission and suﬀered
from PTSD afterwards (Clarke, 2022): see Supplemen-
tary Table 4O.

4. Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic literature
review that evaluated the use and eﬀectiveness of
EMDR-therapy for adult patients treated in the medi-
cal setting, including hospitals, extramural specialized
clinics and private clinics, in which the treatment can
be extrapolated to hospitals, across various medical
domains. The vast majority of studies found favour-
eﬀects of EMDR-therapy within multiple
able
domains and outcomes. Moreover,
the treatment
appeared to be applicable in both inpatients and out-
patients in the medical setting. Due to a high hetero-
the reported
geneity among the study designs,
outcomes and outcome measures combined with
diﬀerent treatment protocols, a meta-analysis could
not be performed.

The studies included varied in terms of risk of bias:
the overall appraisal of these studies showed at least
moderate to high risks of bias. It should be noted
that concerns regarding measurement of the outcome
are inevitable as, like many practice-based research in
psychology, it is impossible to blind patients to the
type of therapy they receive. Risk of bias is further
increased by the initial choice to include a broad var-
iety of study designs to aim for a broad understanding

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

of the application of EMDR-therapy in the medical
setting. This resulted in the inclusion of many uncon-
the
trolled studies. Moreover, a vast majority of
included studies did not mention whether there were
any adverse events during EMDR treatment (Klatte
et al., 2023). Although this could be interpreted as
an aﬃrmation of the feasibility of EMDR-therapy in
the medical setting, supported by low chance of
adverse events, reporting biases are not unthinkable.
Therefore, future research should aim for randomized
controlled studies, in which adverse events, and treat-
ment adherence are explicitly mentioned.

Many diﬀerent outcome measures were used in the
included studies, ranging from disease-related (e.g.
pain, skin condition), to relatively generic outcome
measures for mental health (e.g. anxiety, depression),
and speciﬁcally PTSD. The use of disease-related out-
come measures leads to the question of how it is poss-
ible that a therapy developed to treat PTSD also aﬀects
physical symptoms, in ‘somatically ill’ patients not per
se diagnosed with PTSD. In this respect, it is key to
illness can also
realize that people with physical
suﬀer from psychological trauma, where their own
body is perceived to be the perpetrator (Shapiro,
1995). Medical trauma then, is deﬁned as ‘extremely
stressful experiences caused by the somatic disorder
itself or by subsequent medical treatment’ (Hase,
2019). For that reason, it would have been of interest
to also include information about the hospitalization
history of patients, but these data were not conse-
quently reported. Such data could have helped to pro-
vide more insight into the possible eﬀects of illness
course (e.g. number and length of hospitalizations)
on treatment response.

Shapiro’s adaptive information processing (AIP)
model (Solomon & Shapiro, 2008), oﬀers a solution
in explaining how the lasting eﬀect of extremely stress-
ful illness-related experiences – which take the form of
physical symptoms – can be reversed by EMDR-
therapy. The premise of the AIP model is that many
kinds of psychopathology can be seen as the result of
disruptive experiences
images,
(in the form of
emotions, cognitions, bodily sensations)
that are
stored in the nervous system at the time of the
event. EMDR-therapy makes the stored traumatic
experience accessible while at the same time activating
the natural processing system. It is hypothesized that
symptoms diminish because a new connection is
established in the neural network between stored dys-
functional
information, and other existing, more
healthy information and perceptions. Focusing on
memories of disease-related traumatic experiences
then provides a good entry point for treatment.

Limitations of our study include the choices made
in our search and inclusion process. First, by including
‘psychological’ outcome measures such as anxiety and
depression in our search strings, it cannot be ruled out

10

H. P. A. DRIESSEN ET AL.

that we may have missed studies that exclusively
included ‘somatic’ outcome measures such as ‘pain’
or ‘dizziness’. Even though anxiety, depression and
stress can co-occur with both somatic symptoms and
with PTSD,
for which EMDR-therapy is an evi-
dence-based treatment, this does not guarantee that
some relevant manuscripts have not been missed.
Second, studies on patients with somatic symptom
disorder were included, whereas studies on patients
with eating disorders were excluded. It can be debated
whether these studies on patients with somatic symp-
tom disorder ﬁt in the scope of this review, as we aim
to evaluate EMDR-therapy in the medical setting in
patients with somatic morbidity. However, since per-
sistent physical complaints account for a large part
of healthcare consumption in primary and secondary
healthcare (Wortman et al., 2018), and form an impor-
tant part of daily hospital practice, we also included
these three studies. Patients with eating disorders on
the other hand may be less likely to present for treat-
ment in the medical setting.

Implementing EMDR-therapy in the medical set-
ting comes with several practical advantages and dis-
advantages. An advantage can be that, since therapies
can be relatively short, they can easily go alongside
medical treatment for the time period patients are
being treated. For inpatients, it may be an advantage
to receive therapy whilst being admitted anyway,
meaning that patients do not have to spend time
on extra travel or search for mental health care
after discharge, which can be quite diﬃcult given
the long waiting list for mental health care in many
countries. Disadvantages include the taxability of
patients, who because of their condition may be
tired sooner. This does not necessarily mean that
application of EMDR-therapy is not possible,
it
rather asks for a certain creativity and ﬂexibility in
the interrelatedness of
applying therapy. Also,
somatic and psychological
symptomatology can
make working with these patients quite challenging
and requires that for each patient a thorough case-
conceptualization is being made, with a clear hypoth-
esis on how particular complaints are related to
memories of previous experience or imagined future
catastrophe. So, suﬃcient general and sometimes
additional speciﬁc EMDR-training is warranted for
therapists.

Surprisingly, no studies were performed within the
domains of surgery and preoperative anaesthesiology.
In a medical setting, high incidence of anxiety is found
in patients expecting an operation (Matthias & Samar-
asekera, 2012). Moreover, psychiatric disorders
increase the risk for preoperative anxiety (Caumo
et al., 2001). Though a lot of interest has gone out
on psychological interventions to decrease preopera-
tive anxiety (Stamenkovic et al., 2018), no studies on
the eﬃcacy of EMDR-therapy have been performed.

In the light of this review’s results, EMDR-therapy
might be a fast and beneﬁcial intervention to reduce
preoperative anxiety in a medical setting.

5. Conclusions

Overall, outcomes seem to show beneﬁcial eﬀects of
EMDR-therapy on reducing psychological and phys-
ical symptoms in patients treated in a medical setting.
Due to the heterogeneity of reported outcomes, eﬀect
sizes could not be pooled. Due to the high risk of bias
of the included studies, our results should be inter-
preted with caution and further controlled high-qual-
ity research is needed.
