Abstract: Severe illnesses in children and adolescents/young adults (AYAs) may represent a complex
burden for patients and their caregivers, including a wide range of mental disorders, particularly
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few events are as potentially traumatizing as having a son
or a daughter diagnosed with a severe, life-threatening, or disabling disease. The presence of
PTSD symptoms in caregivers may compromise their efﬁcacy as caregivers and negatively affect
the child’s well-being. This systematic review aims at outlining potential risk and protective factors
for the development of PTSD symptoms in caregivers of children and AYAs affected by severe
acute or chronic illnesses. Thirty-one studies on caregivers of children and AYAs affected by severe,
acute, or chronic diseases were included. Socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics,
illness-related distress, psychiatric symptoms, support, and coping styles were found as potential
risk/protective factors across studies. It is crucial to consider risk factors affecting caregivers of
severely ill young patients, in order to plan focused interventions aimed at preventing an adverse
clinical outcome in caregivers and at enhancing caregivers’ coping skills, in order to ultimately
improve their quality of life.

1. Introduction

Severe acute or chronic illnesses represent a stressful burden for patients and their
caregivers. Moreover, they may favor the onset of a wide range of psychological problems
in carers, such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) [1–9]. PTSD is a condition that may occur after traumatic events, life-threatening
events, or painful experiences [10–12]. Subjects with PTSD are not necessarily the victims of
an event: witnessing, being involved, or being informed of a traumatic event happened to
a beloved one may trigger the onset of PTSD [13]. In this regards, few events are as poten-
tially traumatizing as having a child diagnosed with a possibly life-threatening or disabling
disease [14]. Particularly, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—ﬁfth
edition (DSM-5) introduced illness in one’s child among the events considered as trau-
matic (“a medical catastrophe concerning one’s child”), specifying that the event must
represent a condition that endangers life at the moment [15]. Consequently, this deﬁnition
overcame the previous DSM-IV-TR statement that required learning that one’s child has a
life-threatening disease [16,17], highlighting the need for the traumatic event to be sudden
and dangerous, focusing on the urgency and abruptness of the perceived threat [18,19].
However, many authors have also discussed the clinical relevance of so-called “minor”

events in the development of full and, similarly disabling, partial post-traumatic symp-
tomatology, adopting a wide approach of spectrum to trauma and traumatic event, focused
on individual experience vulnerability [20]. In this perspective, increasing attention has
been deserved to PTSD among parents and caregivers of paediatric patients affected by
severe but heterogeneous medical conditions characterized by a severe impairment or a
chronic course, even a signiﬁcant risk of mortality, as cancer, leukaemia/lymphoma, dia-
betes, neurological acute (ischemic, haemorrhagic, traumatic injury) or chronic (epilepsy)
conditions, psychiatric and neurodevelopment disorders (such as autism), sex develop-
ment disorders, burn injury, severe asthma crisis, illnesses that needed transplant surgery,
pointing out the potential traumatic role of such experiences [21–24]. Severe medical condi-
tions occurring to loved ones could be one of the strongest factors associated to PTSD [24].
However, only recently researchers began to focus on PTSD in parents of children with
chronic illnesses [14,21–23]. Studies using the DSM criteria for PTSD diagnosis reported
incidences of current cancer-related PTSD ranging from 6.2% to 25% parents’ childhood
cancer survivors, while clinically severe levels of PTSD symptoms ranged from 9.8% to
44% [21]. Similarly, in diabetes type 1 studies, up to a quarter of the parents met the DSM
criteria for PTSD diagnosis 6 weeks after their child’s diagnosis, while 15% of mothers still
met criteria for a partial diagnosis of PTSD and 10% met criteria for the full diagnosis up to
5 years after [23].

Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) include nuanced or attenuated symptoma-
tology belonging to the traumatic reaction, as intrusion symptoms, persistent avoidance,
negative alterations in cognitions and mood, alterations in arousal and activity. Never-
theless, growing ﬁndings suggest partial or sub-threshold PTSD conditions being related
to an impairment in family, work, and social adjustment as full-blown syndromes, often
representing a problem not only during the acute phase but also across extended periods
after the traumatic exposure [25,26]. PTSS in parents may affect their caregiver role and
adversely impact on the child’s behavior, response to treatment, and treatment outcome.
Arousal or re-experiencing symptoms, in fact, may compromise the caregiver’s adherence
to medical guidelines or to report essential information to health professionals [27]. Hyper-
vigilant caregivers may request frequent doctor visits or make an excessive number of
accesses to medical services [28]. On the other hand, caregivers with active avoidance may
pass over medical visits or refuse necessary medical procedures [29]. Parallel, the impact
of parent’s stress on the child may be detrimental for the child’s well-being [30], and PTSD
symptoms in parents can have negative implications for their child’s behavior or adjust-
ment in the long-term, as well as impair the parent–child relationship [31]. Moreover, while
struggling with their difﬁculties in dealing with stress, caregivers often have a reduced
access to support and resources [32,33]. Furthermore, PTSD has been positively associated
to an increased risk of other psychopathological conditions and substance abuse, leading
to a well-being impairment [34–36]. In this line, increasing evidence suggests that PTSD
or PTSS could be associated to the onset of depression, suicidal behavior, anxiety, sleep
problems, and other conditions in cares that worse their quality of life [1,2,4,7,9].

Although a lack of studies in this research area [37], interventions to prevent PTSS,
and enhance resilience are likely to relieve the suffering of the parents (and indirectly
of the young patients) and maintain their caregiver ability. Indeed, some studies found
a role of resilience-focused interventions in improving caregivers’ quality of life [38,39].
It seems primary to recognize possible PTSD risk factors (such as gender, age, carers’
mental health history, characteristics of the child’s illness, and other factor that could be
positively associated to PTSD), as well as other variables that could represent protective
factors for PTSD development in cares (as positive coping styles or availability of familiar
of healthcare service support, and other variables which could be negatively associated
to PTSD). Therefore, the present systematic review aimed at exploring the possible risk
and protective factors for the development of PTSD and PTSS in caregivers of children and
adolescents/young adults (AYAs) affected by severe illnesses, in order to plan interventions
aimed at promoting the mental well-being of both caregivers and young patients.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Literature Search

A systematic search was conducted from 1st September 2020 to 30th September 2020 by
searching the electronic databases PubMed, Ovid, and EMBASE. All studies from 1 January
1990 to 31 August 2020 were included in the databases search. The combination of search
terms without filters, restrictions, or limits was utilized: (PTSD OR post-traumatic stress OR
post-traumatic stress disorder OR post-traumatic stress symptoms OR PTSS OR post-traumatic
stress reaction) AND (caregiver OR caregivers OR parents OR mothers OR fathers).

2.2. Eligibility Criteria

The following criteria were utilized to include studies in the present review:

1.

2.

3.

Full-text publications reporting data related to PTSD and PTSS in caregivers of chil-
dren and AYAs (aged between 0–25 years) affected by severe illnesses (i.e., chronic or
acute, life threatening or disabling diseases).
Articles assessing possible risk (positively associated) and/or protective (negatively
associated) factors for PTSD and PTSS in caregivers.
Articles available in English.

2.3. Screening and Selection Process

The primary database search provided a total of 10,086 records. Whereupon, 10,034 pub-
lications were removed after titles and abstracts screening because they were duplicates
(N = 9254) or not relevant (i.e., they did not investigate the PTSD symptoms, or caregivers
or were not research studies) (N = 691), or because full-text was not available or not in
English (N = 14), or were reviews or metanalyses (N = 75). Fifty-two articles passed the
initial screening. The relevant references cited in the selected studies, besides in review
and metanalyses found in the initial search, were also manually screened to complete our
search. However, no further eligible studies emerged in the process of manual screening.
Data extraction and eligibility assessment were performed independently by two raters.
Any disagreements highlighted during the process was discussed, and consensus reached.
Finally, 31 studies were included in the present review. Details of the screening process
are summarized in Figure 1, illustrating a ﬂow chart according to PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations [40].

Results The search yielded 31 studies that were included in the review (see Figure 1). In our search, the large majority of the studies analyzed was on caregivers of children and AYAs affected by tumors, investigated by fourteen studies [41–54]. The remaining diagnostic categories of children and AYAs whose caregivers were investigated for PTSD were very heterogeneous and less numerous, and included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) pa-tients [55,56], epilepsy [57,58], burn injuries, and other accidents [41,59–61], disorders of sex development [62,63], asthma [64], transplants [65–68], HIV [66], Sickle cell disease [66], diabetes mellitus type 1 [41], and neuro-psychiatric disorders [69–71].

3. Results

The search yielded 31 studies that were included in the review (see Figure 1). In our
search, the large majority of the studies analyzed was on caregivers of children and AYAs
affected by tumors, investigated by fourteen studies [41–54]. The remaining diagnostic
categories of children and AYAs whose caregivers were investigated for PTSD were very
heterogeneous and less numerous, and included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
patients [55,56], epilepsy [57,58], burn injuries, and other accidents [41,59–61], disorders of
sex development [62,63], asthma [64], transplants [65–68], HIV [66], Sickle cell disease [66],
diabetes mellitus type 1 [41], and neuro-psychiatric disorders [69–71]. Characteristics of
included studies are described in Table 1.

A large majority of the studies adopted the Impact of Event Scale- Revised
(IES-R) [42–45,48,53–55,61–63,66,67,69], a self-report questionnaire used to assess prob-
able PTSD by covering all three symptoms clusters (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal)
through 22 items and in which individuals with a score equal or above 24 were considered
to have clinically signiﬁcant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), while those with a
score equal or higher than 33 a probable PTSD diagnosis [72]. Other tools used in the
studies included in the present review were various version of the Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder Checklist (PCL) [47,49–52,59,71]. Particularly, the PCL, the PCL-civilian (PCL-C)
and the PCL- speciﬁc (PCL-S) are self-report rating scale for assessing the 17 DSM-IV
symptoms of PTSD. The cut-off for assessing PTSD diagnosis among studies. The PCL for
the DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of
PTSD. A cut-off of >33 combined to the endorsement of a cluster criteria represents a good
predictor of a PTSD diagnosis [73,74]. Moreover, with this scale PTSD symptoms were
identiﬁed as clinically signiﬁcant (PTSS) if the participant was at least “moderately both-
ered” by at least one reexperiencing cluster symptom, three avoidance cluster symptoms,
or two arousal cluster symptoms [59]. Four studies used the post-traumatic diagnostic
scale (PDS), a 49 item self-report questionnaire corresponding to the DSM-IV PTSD criteria
and in which individuals received a probable PTSD diagnosis if their answers met DSM-IV
PTSD Criteria A-F, while a score equal or higher than 21 was considered predictive of
at-least moderate-severe PTSS [60]. Two studies used the trauma and loss spectrum-self
report (TALS), a self-report tool including 116 items that explores the lifetime experience of
losses, traumatic events and PTSD symptoms, behaviors and personal characteristics that
might represent manifestations and/or risk factors for the development of PTSD [26]. With
this instrument, DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis was assessed utilizing a matching system between
symptom criteria and TALS-SR items, and a probable partial PTDS diagnosis was predicted
if individuals met two or three of the DSM-5 B, C, D, and E criteria for PTSD [57,58].
Finally, the remaining tools were used only once, and two were self-report measures:
the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Assessment Scale [46], the Post-traumatic stress dis-
order questionnaire (PPQ) [56], and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [68],
a questionnaire administered by a trained clinician.

Particularly, PTSD prevalence rates ranged from 4.44% [59] to 82.9% [55], and PTSS

prevalence rates from 3.9% [48] to 54% [67].

3.1. Risk Factors for PTSD/PTSS

We identiﬁed the following risk factors for PTSD and PTSS: socio-demographic and
socio-economic characteristics; illness-related distress; psychiatric symptoms and nega-
tive/maladaptive coping.

3.1.1. Socio-Demographic and Socio-Economic Characteristics

Women were found to be at statistically signiﬁcantly higher risk of developing PTSS
with respect to men in ﬁve studies [42,46,50,58,63]. In a sample of 134 parents of pediatric
patients with epilepsy, Carmassi et al. reported PTSD in 13.3% of mothers and 4.5% of
fathers, and an additional 43.3% of the mothers and 25.0% of the fathers, presented partial
PTSD [58]. Younger age of one’s child/AYA was found to be a risk factor for developing
PTSD in caregivers in four studies [51,59,61,62]. Moreover, other authors found that
younger age of parents too was related to an increased risk of PTSD [50]. Furthermore,
some authors [49], examining a sample of 204 parent caregivers of AYAs with cancer, found
that the presence of other life stressors, a more severe impact of patient’s illness on plans
for the future and on the broader family, was associated with increased PTSS levels. These
authors also highlighted an association between PTSS and living outside the metropolitan
area. A study on a sample of 265 parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
showed that having other life stressors, as having one biological parent not living in the
home, having two or more children diagnosed with ASD, difﬁculties ﬁnding or holding a
job or marital problems, were related to an increased risk of PTSS [69]. Moreover, having a
lower household income and increased expenses related to the disease, were found to be
associated to PTSD symptoms severity in fathers [53,63]. More widely, some other authors
investigating a sample of 45 parents of children post-burn, found that the level of familiar
stress prior to the burn event was related to higher PTSS in caregivers [59]. Finally, only
one study pointed out that married subjects had an increased risk of developing PTSS [67].

3.1.2. Illness-Related Distress

Longer stays in hospital [61] as well as objective illness severity [56] have been as-
sociated to increased risk of PTSD. Ingerski et al. [66], in a sample of 64 caregivers of
children experiencing a chronic illness, found that being caregivers of transplant candi-
dates was a risk factor for developing PTSD. Moreover, another study on 215 caregivers of
children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, highlighted higher PTSS levels in
caregivers of allogeneic transplant patients, a procedure associated with greater medical
complications and risk of mortality than autologous transplant [67]. Perez et al. [53], in a
study on 59 parents of children with cancer, found that illness uncertainty acted indirectly
as a risk factor, through ruminations, in enhancing PTSS. Moreover, in a more recent study
on the same sample expanded up to 145 caregivers of children with cancer, authors found
a signiﬁcant direct relationship between illness uncertainty and PTSS [54]. The disease
status was also found to be an important factor, as parents of relapsed children [51] and
parents of patients with a greater number of tumor recurrences [44] were at higher risk of
PTSS, as well as parents of recently diagnosed patients [42]. Conversely, being no longer
on active treatment was associated to a reduction in PTSS [43]. De Young et al. [60], in a
sample of 120 parents of children with burn injuries, found that having a higher number
of invasive procedures was related to higher PTSS. Another study found an association
between objective severity of disease and PTSS. Indeed, Landolt et al. [41] found in a
sample of 355 parents of children 5–6 weeks after an accident or a new diagnosis of cancer
or diabetes mellitus type 1, that having a diagnosis of cancer were related to higher PTSS
in caregivers with respect to the other diagnosis or a poorer functional status of the child.
Furthermore, Carmassi et al. [57], in a study on 134 parents of children with epilepsy, high-
lighted the subjective impact of medical event as a factor enhancing PTSS and, similarly,
a greater subjective illness severity was found to be a risk factor by two other studies [47,56].
Indeed, Juth et al. [47] on a sample of 110 caregivers of AYA cancer patients undergoing
active treatment at an outpatient clinic, found an association between caregivers’ subjective
illness severity and their own PTSS. Malin et al. [56], examining a sample of parents of
infants who were in the NICU for more than 14 days, found that parent perceptions of
illness were associated with PTSD symptoms, after adjusting for objective measures of
illness. As concerns the unknown diagnosis, in another study on a sample of 139 parents
of young children with disorders of sex development researchers found that, in fathers,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 189

10 of 18

lack of identiﬁable etiology underlying the disease increased the risk of developing PTSD
symptoms [63]. Finally, Stewart et al. [71], investigating a sample of 395 parents of children
with ASD and rare diseases, found that challenging behaviors (i.e., persistent and pervasive
maladaptive behavior(s)—including physical aggression, self-injurious behaviors, suicidal
behaviors, sexually inappropriate behavior, offending behavior such as arson or stealing,
elopement, pica—that has a signiﬁcant adverse effect on the quality of life and/or health
and safety of the individual or others) in the child were related to increased risk of PTSD in
the caregivers.

3.1.3. Psychiatric Symptoms and Negative/Maladaptive Coping

Psychiatric symptoms, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms [67,69], manic symp-
toms among fathers [57] and acute distress symptoms [60] were found to be risk factors
for PTSS, as well as having a prior trauma history [60] or having a family mental health
diagnosis [59]. Other authors found, in a study on 82 parents of infants previously treated
in NICU, that PTSS in one partner was related to PTSS in the spouse [55]. Psychiatric
symptoms in young patients also resulted as a risk factor for PTSD in parents, as shown by
many authors [42,59,60,68]. Indeed, De Young et al. [60] highlighted as child PTSS were as-
sociated to higher PTSS in caregivers, and similar ﬁndings were shown by Phipps et al. [42]
in a sample of 120 parents of children with cancer and by Taskiran et al. [68] in a sample
of 27 mothers of children who underwent a bone marrow transplantation. Moreover,
Malpert et al. [48], in a sample of 127 parents of long-term survivors of childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, found that perceived caregiver strain was signiﬁcantly associ-
ated with PTSS and another study highlighted as, in fathers, the level of perceived stress
was related to PTSS [55]. Ruminations as well, resulted to be associated to PTSD symp-
toms [53] and, in one study, ruminations were found to be associated to higher PTSS
in fathers [58]. Negative attitudes and perceptions [65], as well as feelings of guilt and
shame [61] and dysfunctional cognitions [70] have shown a correlation with PTSS. Par-
ticularly, Young et al. [65] reported, in a sample of 170 caregivers of pediatric transplant
recipients, that parents who had more negative attitudes about their health care services
and about health care in general were more likely to report more severe PTSD symptoms.
Moreover, Pasterski et al. [62] found in a sample of 47 parents of children diagnosed with a
disorder of sex development, that having a cognitive response to the diagnosis character-
ized by confusion and disbelief was associated to an increased risk of PTSD. Another study
on 120 caregivers of children with asthma found that following beliefs congruent with a lay
model of asthma management, instead of a professional model of disease management, was
associated with an increased risk of developing PTSS [64]. Finally, some authors found that
some maladaptive coping styles were related to higher PTSS, particularly emotion-oriented
coping in fathers and avoidance-oriented coping style in mothers [55].

In conclusion, female gender, a younger age (both of young patients and caregivers),
the presence of other stressor and the severity of the illness are the most recognized
risk factors for PTSD or PTSS. Furthermore, various kinds of psychiatric symptoms or
maladaptive coping strategies are also reported to be associated to PTSD/PTSS.

3.2. Protective Factors for PTSD/PTSS

For what concerns the protective factors, we found factors as social status, support,

and positive coping emerging across studies.

3.2.1. Social Status

Khalifa et al. [46], in a sample of 96 parents of children with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, reported that higher professional and educational levels were associated with
lower PTSS.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 189

11 of 18

3.2.2. Support

Some studies highlighted the importance of support in reducing PTSS. Particularly,
reducing barriers to treatment for their child with cancer was found to reduce PTSS [54].
Sawyer et al. [51], on a sample of 204 parents of AYAs with cancer, found that self and
child unmet needs of practical support from healthcare services was related to higher PTSS
levels. McCarthy et al. [52], analyzing the same study sample, highlighted the important
role of meeting the information needs of parents in reducing their PTSS levels.

3.2.3. Positive Coping

Harper et al. [45], examining 75 parents of pediatric cancer patients, found that parents’
caregiving self-efﬁcacy reduced immediate and longer-term PTSD symptoms related to
one’s child treatment procedures. Moreover, Bruce et al. [44], in a sample of 52 parents
of children with brain tumor, found that having more positive parent–child interactions,
as shown by a higher score of “Conﬂict Resolution”, was related to a reduction in PTSS.
Another study on 91 parents and primary caregivers of children recruited in the wards or
outpatient clinics during the ﬁrst 8 weeks following their child’s burn injury, found that
parents who rated high in self-compassion reported fewer PTSS [61].

In general, protective factors are less investigated in literature than risk ones. Most of
the existent evidence concern positive coping style and support provided by medical staff.
Moreover, education levels were negatively associated with PTSS in one study.

4. Discussion

The present review summarizes the relevant risk or protective factors for PTSD/PTSS
in caregivers of children/AYAs affected by severe, life-threatening, or chronic diseases. We
found some risk or protective factors were supported by many studies, while other factors
had scant evidence, highlighting the need for further research on this topic. Particularly,
although several factors, such as the presence of psychiatric symptoms or support by
medical staff could be modiﬁed, they are not extensively investigated. In our opinion
further studies on these variables are needed to corroborate the previous ﬁndings and
identify the possible strategies to reduce PTSS.

In regard to sociodemographic factor, our review found women to be at higher risk of
developing PTSD symptoms with respect to men [42,46,50,58,63], with rates up to 13.3%
of the mothers reporting full-PTSD and 43.3% partial PTSD [58]. This heightened risk of
PTSD in women was highlighted in many studies [75–77] and has been related to a greater
fear conditioning in women than in men [78]. On the other hand, the effect of age on the
risk of PTSD/PTSS was investigated with a minor extent. In some studies, younger age
of caregivers or patients were a risk factor for PTSD. However, usually studies do not
distinguish their results for children, adolescents, or young adults. Moreover, in some cases
age range of patients was not clearly reported, hence the effect of age cannot be assessed.
Future studies would evaluate if risk factors change in caregivers of young patients with
different age, in order to improve speciﬁc management strategies. Another major ﬁnding
was the relevant role of life stressors in increasing parents’ PTSS levels and distress, such
as the impact of patient’s illness on plans for the future, the effect of the illness on the
broader family [49], and having a lower income while facing the great amount of expenses
related to the disease [54,63]. Other authors found that having one biological parent not
living in the home, having two or more children diagnosed with ASD, difﬁculties ﬁnding
or holding a job or marital problems, were risk factors, reinforcing the role of other life
stressors in determining PTSD onset [69]. These results highlight the considerable and
complex burden parents may carry out while facing their child’s severe illnesses, and point
out the importance of assess all possible stressor and negative life event in such population,
in order to detect subjects at risk of PTSD. Considering these data we would suggest a
family-centered supportive care for patients and parents, to avoid negative outcomes [79].
Interestingly, we found that illness uncertainty, a cognitive appraisal strongly related to
parental distress [80], acted both directly and indirectly, through ruminations, in enhancing

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 189

12 of 18

PTSS [53,54]. Illness uncertainty mediated the relationship between barriers to care and
PTSS, suggesting that greater perceived barriers were related to higher illness uncertainty,
which in turn increased parent psychological distress [54]. Moreover, these results suggest
that it could be beneﬁcial to the establishment of services aimed at minimizing medical
care barriers and consequently at reducing the parental uncertainty [81].

Furthermore, we found that some studies focused on the role of ruminations in
developing PTSS [53,58]. Rumination is considered a maladaptive attempt to cope with
distress, widely investigated as a potential emotion regulation method, or a possible
strategy to cope distressing emotions [82,83]. PTSD symptoms may also been triggered by
perseverative thoughts [84–86] and, as we found in our review, a signiﬁcant relationship
between PTSS and caregiver rumination emerged [87,88].

Interestingly, feelings of guilt and shame were also found to be associated to higher
PTSS in caregivers [60,61]. Feelings of guilt and shame have been recognized by the DSM-5
as having a central role in PTSD psychopathology [15]. Particularly, they were highly
reported by patients with PTSD and strongly associated with maladaptive behaviors [89].
Consequently, more recognition should be given to parents’ subjective appraisals of their
child’s injury/disease [90]. Moreover, with shame the entire self is seen as at fault, while
with guilt the focus is just on speciﬁc behaviors [91]. Therefore, shame was found to be a
stronger predictor of psychological distress, maybe because it is a more aversive emotional
experience compared to guilt [92]. However, as this ﬁnding was supported only by two
studies, further research should be added on this topic. Guilt and shame feelings were, in
fact, related to PTSD development and severity in other populations [25,89] and can also
be treated [93], but more speciﬁc studies are needed in caregivers.

As concerns protective factors, some studies found the important role of meeting the
support needs of caregivers in protecting against PTSD symptoms [51,52,54]. Particularly,
access to a social worker for practical support, access to a mental health clinician, and
access to an education and vocational advisor for both caregivers and ill young patients
have been related to a reduction in the emotional distress of caregivers. These studies
also highlighted the important protective role of meeting information needs of caregivers,
particularly about the ﬁnancial impacts of disease for the family. This supports other
ﬁndings that have reported as families experience signiﬁcant ﬁnancial concerns toward
the future and have difﬁculties in accessing income support measures while managing a
severe illness in their child [94].

With regard to positive coping styles, some authors [45] found that parents’ caregiving
self-efﬁcacy reduced their immediate and longer-term PTSD symptoms related to their
children’s treatment procedures. Difﬁcult situations are more likely to be viewed as
“challenges to be mastered rather than threats to be avoided” in individuals with high
self-efﬁcacy [95]. As previously reported in pediatric cancer context [96–98], highly self-
efﬁcacious parents may feel relatively comfortable with their ability to cope with the
situation, with lower levels of negative affective reactions, included PTSS. Self-compassion,
deﬁned as the capacity to assume a warm and understanding attitude toward him/herself
in response to negative events or perceived self-inadequacy, was reported as a protective
factor in parents [61,98,99]. Better psychological functioning has been related to higher
scores in self-compassion [98].

In our review, we found only three studies addressing PTSD in caregivers of children
affected by psychiatric disorders, namely one study on parents of children with PTSD [70]
and two studies on parents of children with ASD and other rare diseases [69,71]. Although
parenting distress has been widely investigated in research studies on caregivers of chil-
dren affected by ASD [100–104], it seems as the post-traumatic stress burden in caregivers
of children and AYAs affected by ASD needs further investigations. Indeed, ASD is a
neurodevelopmental disorder that presents an often chronic and disabling clinical picture,
characterized by deﬁcits in socio-communicative behaviors, the presence of stereotypical
behaviors, and a restricted range of interests [15] but also could be associated to challenging
behaviors. The last ones are a range of not socially acceptable conduct that can be physi-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 189

13 of 18

cally dangerous to the child or the family, and which have been associated with elevated
parenting stress [104,105]. Challenging behaviors that place the child and/or the parent at
risk of harm include physical aggression and self-injurious behaviors, suicidal behaviors,
elopement, and pica [106–109]. These behaviors can have a greater physical and emotional
impact on parents than core ASD symptoms, bringing a high risk of PTSD [71]. It could be
important to identify and treat these subjects with appropriate interventions, as some data
report that problem-solving skills training may be beneﬁcial to parents of children with
autism spectrum disorder [110].

This review has some limitations that need to be addressed. The ﬁrst one is the fact
that the number of studies was relatively small. In particular, as we described above,
only few evince exist on several possible protective or risk factors, and more studies are
needed to conﬁrm such results. Furthermore, we found studies on different types of
severe diseases, with different prognosis and outcomes, and on different types of young
patients (children vs AYAs), that could account for a difference in psychic burden on family
caregivers. However, the data reported in literature do not consent a comparison of these
categories. Finally, due to the wide heterogeneity of the samples and of the procedures
used to assess PTSD and PTSS in the included studies, a meta-analysis process could not
be performed.

5. Conclusions

Severe illnesses in children and AYAs may represent a complex psychic burden for
patients and their caregivers, leading to PTSD and PTSS. Illness related-distress may
represent an important risk factor for the development of PTSD symptoms, particularly
in subjects with other life stressors and in the presence of other psychiatric symptoms or
negative coping styles while facing a great distressing situation, as a severe disease in own’s
child. The presence of even a few PTSS in caregivers may compromise their efﬁcacy as
caregivers and negatively affect their child’s as well as their own well-being. Identiﬁcation
of risk/protective factors for the development of PTSD may give the opportunity to target
particularly at-risk individuals with focused interventions aimed at enhancing potentials
for family caregivers to reduce adverse psychic outcomes and to feed psychological well-
being in both caregivers and young patients. For this reason, future studies will focus on
several relevant risk and protective factors that have not been sufﬁciently investigated.
