Abstract

Objectives.—We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to explore whether a 
hospital inpatient addiction consult team (Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team [START]) 
based on collaborative care was feasible, acceptable to patients, and whether it could improve 
uptake of medication in the hospital and linkage to care after discharge, as well as reduce 
substance use and hospital readmission. The START consisted of an addiction medicine specialist 
and care manager who implemented a motivational and discharge planning intervention.

Methods.—We randomized inpatients age ≥18 with a probable alcohol or opioid use disorder 
to receive START or usual care. We assessed feasibility and acceptability of START and the

RCT, and we conducted an intent-to-treat analysis on data from the electronic medical record and 
patient interviews at baseline and 1-month postdischarge. The study compared RCT outcomes 
(medication for alcohol or opioid use disorder, linkage to follow-up care after discharge, substance 
use, hospital readmission) between arms by fitting logistic and linear regression models.

Findings.—Of 38 START patients, 97% met with the addiction medicine specialist and care 
manager; 89% received ≥8 of 10 intervention components. All patients receiving START found 
it to be somewhat or very acceptable. START patients had higher odds of initiating medication 
during the inpatient stay (OR 6.26, 95% CI= 2.38–16.48, p<.001) and being linked to follow-up 
care (OR 5.76, 95% CI= 1.86–17.86, p<.01) compared to usual care patients (N=50). The study 
found no significant differences between groups in drinking or opioid use; patients in both groups 
reported using fewer substances at the 1-month follow-up.

Conclusions.—Pilot data suggest START and RCT implementation are feasible and acceptable 
and that START may facilitate medication initiation and linkage to follow-up for inpatients with 
an alcohol or opioid use disorder. A larger trial should assess effectiveness, covariates, and 
moderators of intervention effects.

Introduction

Most people who need treatment for a substance use disorder never receive it (Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2020). Alcohol and opioid disorders 
(AUD, OUD) are of particular concern because of high rates of morbidity, mortality, 
hospitalizations, and readmissions (Coben et al., 2010; Owens et al., 2014; Ronan & 
Herzig, 2016; Singh & Cleveland, 2020). Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of 
preventable death in the United States (Mokdad et al., 2018), with an average of 95,158 
alcohol-attributable deaths annually (261 deaths per day). Between 1999 and 2019, nearly 
500,000 people in the United States died from an overdose involving opioids (Centers for 
Disease Control National Center for Health Statistics, 2020). Moreover, 13% of Americans 
reported starting or increasing substance use during the early days of the COVID-19 
pandemic (Czeisler, 2020), and overdose deaths from opioids increased by nearly 30% in the 
period from April 2020 to April 2021 compared with the year before (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 2021).

Inpatient hospitalization provides a window of opportunity for patients with AUD or 
OUD to initiate life-saving treatment. Between 2014 and 2018, one in nine medical 
hospitalizations involved a recognized substance use disorder (Suen et al., 2021), with AUD 
and OUD being the most prevalent substance use disorder diagnoses (Peterson et al., 2021). 
Nearly 20% of hospital inpatients have unhealthy alcohol use (Wakeman et al., 2020; Wei 
et al., 2014) and an estimated 3% of all hospitalized inpatients have primary or secondary 
OUD diagnosis (Peterson et al., 2021). Moreover, OUD prevalence is very high among 
individuals who are frequently hospitalized; up to four percent of inpatients with infectious

arthritis (Adejumo et al., 2021), up to 6% of those with chronic pancreatitis (Oladunjoye et 
al., 2020), up to 7% of inpatients with chronic pain (Orhurhu et al., 2019), and over 10% 
of patients with infective endocarditis have an OUD (Deo et al., 2018; Schranz & Barocas, 
2020).

Although several FDA-approved medication treatments exist that are effective treatments 
for AUD and OUD (acamprosate, oral and injectable naltrexone, and disulfiram for AUD; 
buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, and oral and injectable naltrexone for OUD) (Balhara, 
2014; Doolittle & Becker, 2011; Drainoni et al., 2014; Mauger et al., 2014; Myles et al., 
2000; Schackman et al., 2012; Tofighi et al., 2014), these medications are not typically 
initiated during the inpatient stay (Kimmel et al., 2020; Makdissi & Stewart, 2013; Raven 
et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2009). Even after hospitalization for a nonfatal opioid overdose, 
few patients with OUD receive medication treatment (Larochelle et al., 2018). Further, 
patients typically are not linked to follow-up care for their substance use after hospital 
discharge (Glass et al., 2016; Naeger et al., 2016), contributing to high rates of hospital 
readmission, poor clinical outcomes, and high costs (Ghosh et al., 2022; Jemberie et 
al., 2022; National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, 2020; Orszag & 
Emanuel, 2010; Wheeler et al., 2007). For patients with an OUD, discharge from the 
hospital is associated with an acute increase in the risk of opioid-related death, with opioid-
related deaths four times more likely in the 2 weeks after discharge (Lewer et al., 2021).

Recent studies suggest hospitalized inpatients with substance use disorder may be willing 
to engage with treatment, including initiating medication treatment, if barriers at the system 
and patient levels can be reduced (Bhatraju et al., 2020; Brothers et al., 2021; Button et al., 
2021; Englander et al., 2017; Huhn et al., 2017; Liebschutz et al., 2014; Pecoraro et al., 
2012; Trowbridge et al., 2017; Velez et al., 2017; Wakeman, Kane, Powell, Howard, Shaw, 
Kehoe, et al., 2021). Although inpatient physicians frequently manage clinical conditions 
related to substance use disorder, many report lacking knowledge and skills for managing 
this condition (Wakeman et al., 2016). Additional barriers to addressing substance use 
disorder during the inpatient stay include the absence of a system for coordinating follow-up 
care (Barocas et al., 2022; Livingston, 2020; Nielsen & Lubman, 2022), stigma (Hoover et 
al., 2022; Livingston, 2020), and patient ambivalence about treatment in the hospital setting 
(Hassamal et al., 2017). Lack of perceived need for treatment is also a barrier to treatment 
initiation generally (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2020). 
Barriers to follow-up care after hospital discharge include lack of hospital team familiarity 
with community providers, poor communication with follow-up providers, and limited or 
absence of monitoring after discharge (Bennett et al., 2012; Raven et al., 2010; van Walraven 
et al., 2010).

A few recent studies, although limited to descriptive, observational and quasi-experimental 
designs, suggest that hospital inpatient addiction consult services could increase medication 
treatment initiation during the hospital inpatient stay and facilitate postdischarge linkage to 
follow-up treatment for people with AUD (Calcaterra et al., 2021; Tran et al., 2021) and 
OUD (Calcaterra, Binswanger, et al.; Englander et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2021). Further, 
addiction consult services may result in lower readmission rates (Bahji et al., 2020; Marks 
et al., 2019; Wakeman, Kane, Powell, Howard, Shaw, & Regan, 2021) and lower, less

severe substance use after discharge (Alaja & Seppä, 2003; King et al., 2020; Wakeman, 
2017). Research has found addiction consult services to be feasible to implement in hospital 
inpatient settings and acceptable to patients and medical teams (Bahji et al., 2020; Barocas 
et al., 2022; Braithwaite et al., 2021; Calcaterra, Binswanger, et al.; Calcaterra, Lockhart, 
et al.; Priest et al., 2020; Priest & McCarty, 2019). Of note, one of the only reported RCTs 
reported positive effects of a hospital-based navigation team on linkage to treatment after 
hospital discharge and on readmission rates (Gryczynski et al., 2021), but the intervention 
focused on proactive case management and differed from services typically provided by 
inpatient consultation team described in other studies. Nevertheless, given the promise of the 
inpatient addiction consult team that prior studies suggest, a need exists for experimental 
research using a rigorous research design to inform adoption and reimbursement of these 
services and to describe and identify effective components of the interventions implemented 
by consult teams. Indeed, as Nielson and Lubman (2022) note, despite the existence of 
evidence-based treatments that can be initiated in the inpatient setting, “…it is perhaps 
surprising then, that in 2021, after an almost decade-long opioid epidemic in the USA, 
additional studies are still required to show the value of clinical models that increase access 
to these evidence-based treatments, and to justify the funding of addiction specialists within 
the hospital system.” (Nielsen & Lubman, 2022).

This article describes findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) exploring 
whether the START is feasible to implement and acceptable to patients and whether it could 
improve medication treatment initiation and linkage to postdischarge substance use disorder 
treatment and reduce substance use for people with AUD or OUD.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Study design and setting

In a pilot RCT, we tested feasibility, acceptability, and potential effects of the START versus 
usual care (UC). Primary RCT outcomes were (1) initiation in the hospital of a medication 
for AUD or OUD; (2) linkage to follow-up care for an AUD or OUD after discharge; and (3) 
heavy drinking and daily number of drinks per day for people with AUD and days of opioid 
use for patients with OUD. Our secondary outcome was readmission to the same hospital 
within 90 days of discharge. We hypothesized that a greater proportion of patients in the 
START arm would initiate medication in the hospital and be linked to follow-up care, and 
that those in the START arm would be less likely at follow-up to be heavy drinkers and have 
fewer days of drinking and number of drinks per day (among those with AUD) and would be 
less likely to use opioids (among those with OUD) than patients in usual care.

The team conducted the trial at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) in Los Angeles, 
California. CSMC, which serves the Los Angeles community and beyond, is one of the 
largest nonprofit academic medical centers in the United States, with 886 licensed beds, 
2,100 physicians, 2,800 nurses and thousands of other health care professionals and staff. 
Hospital services available for patients with AUD or OUD include general social-work 
support services, a general consultation-liaison psychiatry (CL) service, and a hospital 
formulary that stocks all FDA approved medication treatments for opioid and alcohol use

disorder (except for depot-naltrexone). The study took place between December 4, 2020, 
and September 15, 2021.

2.2.  Participants

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Admitted to an inpatient bed at CSMC; (2) Age 18 
or older; (3) Probable AUD or OUD diagnosis, defined by scores of >10 on the alcohol use 
section or >3 on the opioid use section of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement 
Screening Test (ASSIST) (Humeniuk et al., 2008); (4) English as primary language; (5) 
Able to provide informed consent (i.e., not cognitively impaired). The study excluded 
individuals who were receiving FDA-approved medication treatment for an AUD or OUD.

2.3.  Usual care (UC)

UC consisted of the hospital’s current practices for managing patients with AUD or 
OUD. Primary attending physicians could order medication treatments for AUD and OUD, 
including buprenorphine, and could request consultative support from the general CL 
service. Unit and service social workers were available to provide usual discharge planning 
for inpatients, which typically includes providing referrals for community providers and 
programs, facilitating transfer to lower levels of care, addressing housing needs, or 
coordinating home health care and procuring of medical equipment. UC providers did not 
receive any specific training for this study. UC patients did not receive intervention by the 
addiction-focused START providers or any component of the START intervention. Medical 
teams did not have access to the START intervention manual. All participants randomized 
to the UC arm received a substance use disorder education pamphlet that included harm 
reduction and referral information; the medical team provided their remaining care.

2.3 

Intervention

The active intervention was an addiction consultation model of care that we called the 
Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START). START is an addiction-focused 
consultative service that seeks to support the ability of primary attendings and teams to 
initiate evidence-based interventions for hospitalized patients with AUD or OUD.

We developed START using the principles of collaborative care, including multi-faceted 
interventions (care management, medication treatment and psychotherapy if appropriate for 
the patient), clinical measures, patient registries, and a team-based approach to increase 
delivery of evidence-based care (AIMS Center, 2016; W. Katon et al., 2010; W. J. Katon et 
al., 2010). Substantial evidence supports the use of collaborative care for behavioral health 
disorders (Archer et al., 2012) and for behavioral health conditions co-morbid with medical 
illnesses (Huang et al., 2013; Huffman et al., 2014; Tully & Baumeister, 2015; Wakeman 
et al., 2017); we tailored this approach for the inpatient setting. We engaged a stakeholder 
advisory board (SAB) consisting of patients with AUD or OUD, hospital leadership, and 
community treatment providers in meetings to discuss our approach and materials. We held 
two meetings with the SAB before finalizing the materials.

START (delivered to patients randomized to the intervention condition) consisted of an 
addiction medicine specialist (AMS) and a care manager (CM) who used evidence-based

tools and resources, including motivational interviewing (MI) (Miller, 2013), the brief 
negotiated interview (BNI) (D’Onofrio et al., 2015; D’Onofrio et al., 2005; D’Onofrio et al., 
2009; Shenvi et al., 2022), and focused discharge planning based on Project Reengineered 
Discharge (RED) (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2020; Jack et al., 2009), 
to help patients overcome typical barriers to medication initiation and linkage to follow-up 
care. Drawing from the essential elements of the collaborative care model, the START used 
team-, measurement-, population- and evidence-based care supported by a patient-registry 
(AIMS Center, 2021). Also consistent with the collaborative care model, the START 
CM and AMS provided recommendations to the primary medical team and also directly 
delivered services to patients.

The START assessed patients, determined appropriate treatment, and initiated medication 
treatment or supported the medical team’s ability to initiate medication treatment when 
appropriate, provided AUD- or OUD-focused discharge planning and facilitated linkage to 
treatment after discharge. The team responded to specific challenges related to addiction 
and its bio-psycho-social implications and oversaw clinical team-based care regarding the 
patient’s AUD or OUD. The CM in this study was a licensed clinical social worker and the 
AMS was a board-certified addiction psychiatrist who holds a DEA X-waiver. Of note, the 
AMS and CM were existing hospital providers, but they did not treat any patients in the UC 
arm during the study period. We confirmed this by checking the electronic medical record 
(EMR) after the study to make sure neither provider had seen a UC patient.

During the hospital stay, the CM delivered an intervention based on the adapted BNI 
(a structured, evidence-based approach designed to improve readiness for substance use 
disorder treatment based on motivational interviewing) to engage, assess, and help motivate 
the patient to initiate treatment and/or post-discharge care for their AUD or OUD; provided 
educational information to the patient about medication, psychosocial interventions, and 
overdose prevention; conducted psychosocial assessments and assessed for risk factors; 
and guided the patient through safety planning and crisis management as needed. In 
collaboration with the AMS and the primary medical team, the CM also worked with the 
patient to develop an AUD or OUD-focused discharge plan using techniques and materials 
adapted from Project RED, an evidence-based discharge planning protocol, that included 
active planning and teach-back techniques, facilitated linkage to follow-up care, and post-
discharge follow-up calls. For patients who did not initiate medication treatment and did 
not wish to obtain follow-up care, the CM addressed harm reduction needs and helped to 
facilitate linkage if the patient’s readiness changed. The CM also called the patient at least 
once a week for four weeks after discharge to check in about the discharge plan and to aid 
with scheduling appointments and troubleshooting barriers to follow-up care.

The AMS conducted a medical assessment including relapse risk and relevant comorbidities 
that influence medical management of AUD and OUD and evaluated whether the patient 
was a candidate for medication. The AMS discussed the assessment and treatment 
recommendations with the patient’s medical team and either provided consultative guidance 
to the medical team or prescribed the medication. The AMS provided ongoing clinical 
supervision to the CM and was available to communicate with aftercare providers.

The START CM and AMS participated in a four-hour training conducted by a licensed 
psychologist and experienced MI trainer. We measured competency in using MI using 
the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Coding Manual (MITI 4.2.1) (Moyers 
et al., 2014) that has metrics for scoring “fair” and “good” proficiency in using MI. At 
the beginning of the study, prior to implementing the clinical trial, the CM and AMS 
each role-played and received live feedback after the role-play on their fidelity and MI 
competency. This feedback included comments on metrics in the MITI 4.2.1 (Moyers et 
al., 2014), regarding the frequencies of open-ended questions and reflections, ways to 
increase patient change talk, instances of MI-inconsistent language, and ways in which to 
increase partnership and power sharing. Midway through the study, the CM and AMS each 
audio recorded a session with a patient, which was coded for intervention fidelity and MI 
competency. In both recordings, the CM and AMS reached “good” MI competency and 
proficiency as calculated by six formulas that combine global scores and behavioral counts 
on the MITI. Our step-by-step intervention manual is available upon request.

We selected components of the intervention based on the collaborative care model. Key 
components are as follows: (1) Team based care during which the addiction-focused CM and 
AMS each visit the patient at least one time to conduct an assessment; (2) Population-based 
care, defined as use of a registry to identify and monitor patients; (3) Use of evidence-
based tools and resources, including the adapted BNI to assess and improve readiness 
for treatment, and focused discharge planning with resources from Project RED, and the 
American Society for Addiction Medicine (ASAM) standards of care, including an ASAM-
directed assessment of the patient, including appropriateness for MOUD. In Table 1, we 
show services and materials available to participants in the UC and START arms (but not 
necessarily accessed if they were not offered as part of usual care).

2.5.  Data Collection procedures

Approved study staff prescreened patients through a daily EMR report of risk factors for 
alcohol or opioid use disorder that listed potentially eligible subjects (variables included 
demographics, alcohol or opioid history, diagnoses, and screenings) and through clinician 
referral to the study. Screening was conducted in person or remotely using an approved, 
web-based database (Research Electronic Data Capture [REDCap]) (Harris et al., 2009). 
Study staff provided a full consent form and reviewed a consent summary with the patient. 
Consent was obtained via electronic signature. All patients were given patient education 
materials on AUD and OUD treatment and harm reduction. Approved study staff conducted 
an in-person or remote 30–40-minute baseline interview. Interview data were recorded on a 
tablet into REDCap. Participants were remunerated with a $50 gift card for completion of 
the baseline interview. Study analysts created the randomization table. Approved study staff 
randomized patients to the START or UC arm using REDCap. Enrollment was continuous 
with the goal of reaching the desired sample size (N=88). Of note, the randomization was 
imbalanced between the two groups because of a larger than desired randomization table 
in the REDCap system. However, the sample sizes for each group were consistent with 
sample sizes recommended for small intervention tests in staged intervention development 
(Rounsaville et al., 2001) and treatment was assigned randomly between study conditions. 
Interviewers from the RAND Corporation Survey Research Group conducted a follow-up

interview by telephone between one and two months after the patient was discharged from 
the hospital. Follow-up interviews lasted approximately 30–40 minutes. Upon completion 
of the follow-up interview, CSMC study staff electronically added $50 to the patient’s gift 
card handed out at baseline. The CSMC Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved all study 
procedures.

2.6.  Measures

2.6.1.  Feasibility—We examined the proportion of patients who received each of 
10 START components to help determine whether delivering each component of the 
intervention is feasible. We show all START components within essential collaborative care 
domains in Table 3 in the Results section (Bao Y, 2016). The CM recorded each inpatient 
and follow-up encounter in a registry spreadsheet that listed dates and duration of contact 
with the patient and AMS, whether START components were completed, and information on 
service linkage.

2.6.2.  Patient acceptability—To assess acceptability of the START, we asked patients 
five questions on their 1-month follow-up survey: (1) On a scale from 1 to 4, how helpful 
was the START program for helping you address your drug or alcohol use (1=not helpful; 
2=a little helpful; 3=helpful; 4=very helpful); (2) Can you please tell me what you found 
most helpful about working with START (open-ended); (3) Can you please tell me what you 
found least helpful about working with START (open-ended); (4) How could the START 
intervention be changed to be more sensitive to your background or culture (open-ended); 
(5) What recommendations do you have for improving START to make the program the 
most useful to people who are hospitalized and have an alcohol use disorder or problems 
with painkillers or heroin (open-ended).

2.6.3.  RCT outcomes—In Table 2 we present each outcome variable and its definition 
and data source.

2.6.4.  RCT covariates—Variables assessed at baseline and examined in exploratory 
analyses as potential covariates were: age; gender identification (male, female, transgender, 
other, collapsed for the analysis to cis-female, not cis female); Latinx ethnicity versus not; 
race (non-White or multiracial versus White); education; income (income was measured in 
15 categories [with more income ranges] and analyzed on a continuous 15-item interval 
scale and educational attainment was measured in 22 categories [with more education levels] 
and analyzed on a continuous 22-item interval scale; both were collapsed in our descriptive 
tables to fewer categories); type of insurance (public v. private); houselessness (any days 
spent in a shelter or place not intended for human habitation in the past year); work status 
(working full or part time, not working); in a couple (married/unmarried couple v. not in 
a couple); type of disorder (AUD regardless of OUD v. OUD regardless of AUD); average 
pain score in the last week and pain duration (Pain, Enjoyment of Life, General Activity 
Scale (PEG) (Krebs et al., 2009); length of hospital stay; attended substance use treatment 
in the three months prior to hospitalization (talked with a counselor or case manager; went 
to a detoxification program; went to a halfway house or residential program; went to 12-step 
self-help group); negative consequences of substance use (15-item SIP-AD) (Blanchard et

(Zimet et al., 1990); depression (PHQ9) (Gelaye et al., 2014; Kroenke et al., 2001); anxiety 
(GAD7) (Löwe et al., 2008; Ruiz et al., 2011; Spitzer et al., 2006); self-reported prior 
bipolar disorder or schizophrenia and hospitalization from a mental illness; self-stigma 
(Self-stigma in Substance Abuse Scale) (Luoma et al., 2013); and experience of stigma (5 
items adapted from Grosso et al. 2019) (Grosso et al., 2019). We also used the Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (Charlson et al., 1987) to examine severity of physical comorbidities.

2.7.  Analysis

2.7.1.  Feasibility analysis—We used the registry and conducted chart review in the 
EMR to calculate proportions of patients in the START arm who received each component 
of the START intervention. We also conducted a chart review to examine whether any UC 
patients inadvertently received care from members of the START.

2.7.2.  Patient acceptability analysis—We summarized the survey items descriptively. 
For the open-ended items, investigator AJO and research assistant IL read all responses and 
created a list of themes that emerged. They shared the list with the larger study team who 
discussed and modified themes until they reached consensus. This is consistent with rapid 
analytic methods, which focus on identifying actionable insights rather than in-depth theory 
development or inferring meaning (Hamilton & Finley, 2019). Studies have shown that 
themes generated by rapid versus conventional, in-depth analysis to inform implementation 
are highly similar (Taylor et al., 2018).

2.7.3.  RCT analysis—We summarized RCT baseline characteristics with descriptive 
statistics—means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and 
percentages for categorical variables. Continuous baseline demographics and characteristics 
in the START and UC study arms were compared with t tests. The study compared 
categorical variables with chi-square or Fisher exact tests; ordinal categorical variables 
were compared with the Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test. Unadjusted point estimates and 
confidence intervals for proportions and means are reported by study arm. We compared 
main effects of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes between arms by 
fitting a logistic or linear regression model to each. For our primary outcome variables of 
medication initiation, linkage and readmission, all AUD/OUD patients are combined. For 
our analyses of alcohol or opioid use, those with AUD are participants with AUD with 
or without OUD, and participants with OUD are those with OUD with or without AUD. 
The study restricted analyses of outcomes measuring alcohol use to those with AUD, while 
we restricted analysis of opioid use to those with OUD. Though covariates were not used 
for testing intervention efficacy, the study adjusted models for substance use outcomes for 
baseline use.

We also performed exploratory analyses to investigate associations between covariates and 
outcomes, including potential interaction effects. Because the study had nearly as many 
potential covariates as observations, we employed the “Horseshoe Prior” in Bayesian 
analyses of the outcome (Carvalho et al., 2010). Qualitatively, this model starts from the 
assumption that many (if not all) of the covariates are unimportant for predicting the

outcome and attempts to learn which covariates are important. The intention was not to 
detect significant differences given the small sample size, but rather to highlight areas for 
further study. We conducted this analysis for all covariates and two primary outcomes—
AUD/OUD medication initiation and linkage to any follow-up care for AUD/OUD.

3.  Results

3.1.  Participants

We recruited 88 patients between December 2020 and July 2021; 38 were randomized 
to the START arm and 50 to the UC arm (see Figure 1 for consort diagram). Although 
randomization numbers were not balanced, we found no significant differences in patient 
characteristics between the two arms. Nine patients in the START arm and 6 patients in 
the UC arm were lost to follow-up. Eighty-eight patients were included in the analysis of 
medication initiation; 73 were included in the analyses of outcomes requiring follow-up data 
from the 1-month post-discharge interview. Of note, two patients in the START arm died 
prior to follow-up; both deaths were unrelated to the study.

3.2.  Feasibility

A total of 38 participants received the START intervention. Overall, 50% received all ten 
components of the intervention, 89% received eight or more of the components, and 95% 
received five or more components. In Table 3 we present each START component within 
collaborative care domains, describe our measure, and report findings.

3.3.  Patient acceptability

Twenty-nine of the 38 (76%) START participants responded to the START acceptability 
questions in the follow-up survey. Overall, participants found the START to be an acceptable 
and helpful treatment approach. On a 4-point scale, where 1 was not helpful and 4 was 
very helpful, most who responded (79%) reported that the START was either helpful or 
very helpful; eight responded that START was a little helpful. When asked what part of 
the START was the most helpful, participants most often said that it was having someone 
with whom to talk and check-in. Several participants also said the information they received 
from the START was helpful or that they appreciated being treated well by the START 
(e.g., respectfully, without stigma). Two participants stated that the START helped hold them 
accountable with regard to their substance use. One START participant shared, “Every time 
I was maybe going to backslide, they were there.” Few participants had a response to the 
question asking what was least helpful about the START; most responded that everything 
was helpful. One participant reported that the program was “too pushy” and another said 
that they wished there had been more support for their anxiety disorder. When asked how 
the START could be more culturally responsive, participants’ most common response was 
that the START was already sufficiently culturally responsive. One patient responded that 
the program could be more culturally responsive by understanding cultural differences in 
alcohol use and another responded that the program should be more sensitive to individuals 
with co-occurring mental illness. Additional suggestions for improving START were that 
START should have more contact with participants (i.e., more frequent contact or for a 
longer duration) and that the program be made more widely and readily available to patients.

3.4.  RCT outcomes

Page 11

3.4.1.  Baseline characteristics—Participants in the study were predominantly male 
(75%) and White/Caucasian (85%), with 32% reporting Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (Table 4). 
About one quarter (24%) of the participants reported ever being without a stable, habitable 
place to live in the past year, with a minority (39%) currently working full or part time 
and most (63%) reporting an annual income of less than $10,000. Most patients (68%) 
had public health insurance—Medicaid, Medicare, associated managed care plans—versus 
private insurance. The majority of patients (83%) had an AUD, 15% had an OUD related to 
heroin use, and 26% had an OUD related to misuse of prescription pain medications (assed 
using scores from the ASSIST, conducted as part of the eligibility screening). Sixty-nine 
percent (N=61) had AUD only, 17% (N=15) had OUD only, and 14% (N=12) had both 
AUD and OUD. Almost half of all patients (47%) had a score suggesting moderate to severe 
risk from cannabis use and one-fifth had scores suggesting moderate to severe risk from 
use of methamphetamine and/or cocaine use. About one-fifth of all patients had talked to a 
counselor or had attended a self-help group in the three months prior to their hospitalization. 
Twenty-five percent of patients with an AUD and 59% of patients with an OUD had ever 
received any medication for their AUD or OUD. Co-occurring mental health disorders were 
common in the sample, with more than half of the patients having either moderately severe 
(33%) or severe (22%) depression, more than two-thirds having moderately severe (28%) or 
severe (40%) anxiety, and more than a quarter (27%) ever having been hospitalized for a 
psychiatric disorder. Seventy-five percent of patients reported experiencing any component 
of stigma in the health care setting because of their alcohol or opioid use, with almost half 
(45%) perceiving that they had not been treated well by medical providers at some point in 
their lives because of their alcohol or opioid use.

3.4.2.  Primary and secondary outcomes—Patients in the START study arm were 
more than six times as likely to initiate a medication in the hospital (OR 6.26, 95% CI 
2.38–16.48) and more than five times as likely to be linked with follow-up services for 
their AUD or OUD (OR 5.76, 95% CI 2.38–16.48) than patients in usual care (Table 5). 
The study found no statistically significant differences for changes in alcohol or drug use or 
likelihood of 90-day readmission to the same hospital.

3.4.3.  Exploratory covariate analysis—We performed an exploratory model of the 
outcomes including all covariates along with their interactions with two treatment indicators 
(medication initiation and linkage to follow-up care) using a modern Bayesian approach to 
regression modeling with a large number of covariates relative to the sample size called the 
Horseshoe Prior (Carvalho et al., 2010). We excluded participants with missing covariate 
data from this analysis, leaving 78 observations for the model of medication initiation 
and 73 observations for the model of linkage. Horseshoe Prior models for the medication 
initiation outcome identified a potential interaction between non-white race and the START; 
that is, the estimated treatment effect for non-white participants was lower than for white 
participants (log odds ratio −0.31, 80 percent credible interval: [−.81, 0]). While this 
analysis is not intended to establish definitive findings of a moderating effect of covariates 
given the large number of covariates relative to the number of observations, our exploratory 
finding reflects that none of the non-white participants included in this analysis initiated

medication, compared to 19 out of 27 for white participants. Models of the linkage outcome 
did not yield any covariates to be flagged for further study, though we emphasize that the 
small sample size and relatively large number of available covariates makes detecting small 
associations impossible.

4.  Discussion

We developed and evaluated the feasibility, acceptability and effects of an addiction consult 
team—the START—on initiation of MAUD or MOUD, linkage to follow-up care, use of 
alcohol or opioids, and hospital readmission, for hospitalized inpatients with AUD and/or 
OUD. Findings from our pilot RCT provide preliminary evidence that the START is feasible 
to implement during and immediately after an inpatient hospital stay, that it is acceptable to 
patients, and that it may improve medication initiation during the hospital stay and linkage 
to care after.

Overall fidelity to the intervention was high, with most of the intervention components 
completed with the majority of the START patients (89%), and most patients indicated that 
they found the intervention helpful. Time spent with patients in the hospital by each member 
of the START was found to be reasonable, with the AMS spending an average of 39 minutes 
and the CM an average of 35 minutes with each patient. START’s high fidelity ratings and 
its demonstrated feasibility suggest that the START and the components of the intervention 
are feasible to implement in a large hospital setting.

Patients randomized to the START study condition were more than 6 times as likely as those 
in the UC condition to initiate an MOUD during the inpatient stay and more than 5 times 
as likely to be linked with any type of care for their AUD or OUD after discharge from 
the hospital, including going into a residential or outpatient treatment facility, talking with a 
counselor, or seeing a primary care provider or specialist to continue MOUD. This finding is 
consistent with prior reports suggesting that an addiction consult team improves medication 
initiation and linkage (Brothers et al., 2021; Calcaterra et al., 2021; Gryczynski et al., 2021). 
Of note, although our pilot study sample size was small and these are not precise estimates, 
these findings suggest that a very large sample size may not be needed to test these two 
primary outcomes.

In this study, patients with AUD enrolled at a much higher rate than those with OUD, 
perhaps suggesting greater prevalence of AUD among inpatients or possibly the greater ease 
with which they are identified and enrolled, as well as greater willingness to participate in a 
study to address their substance use. OUD is particularly stigmatized in health care settings 
(Tsai et al., 2019); barriers related to stigma may vary between OUD and AUD (Committee 
on the Science of Changing Behavioral Health Social Norms et al., 2016); and patients who 
experience pain may additionally worry that a diagnosis of OUD will undermine appropriate 
pain management (Dassieu et al., 2021; Martinez, 2021). At a minimum, a longer study 
is needed to enroll an adequate number of patients with OUD, but further exploration of 
how to identify and engage patients with OUD is also needed. In addition, based on the 
high proportion of people with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder in 
this study and on patient comments about the intervention needing to address comorbid

mental health conditions, in future studies the intervention could be adapted to better 
address co-occurring mental health conditions. Our exploratory analysis showed a potential 
interaction effect of race/ethnicity; that is, non-white patients were less likely than white 
participants to initiate medication in the hospital. Although our sample size is too small to 
draw conclusions or to parse out differences between types of medication administered, this 
finding is important because of recent literature showing that whites receive buprenorphine 
treatment for OUD at much higher rates than Black and Hispanic individuals (Goedel et 
al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2013; Lagisetty et al., 2019); further study is needed to better 
understand and mitigate this inequity.

The START did not have statistically significant effects on use of alcohol or opioids in the 
30 days after discharge from the inpatient stay; in fact, at their 1-month follow-up interview 
patients in both conditions reported using fewer substances. While the lack of significant 
findings may be due in part to the small number of patients in the pilot RCT (these findings 
suggest a much larger sample size would be needed to detect effects, as effect sizes may be 
small), a post-hospital effect on substance use during the month after discharge may have 
also occurred. That is, patients being discharged from the hospital after illness or injury 
might use fewer substances, perhaps not returning to their pre-hospital use immediately after 
the hospital stay, if at all. A larger sample and longer follow-up periods are needed to fully 
understand these effects. Of note, a post-hoc analysis showed no significant differences in 
substance use after discharge for patients who received follow-up care for their alcohol or 
opioid use disorder compared with those who did not. A second post-hoc analysis showed 
a significant difference (p=.03) for baseline number of drinks per day among drinkers who 
were lost to follow-up (N=13) (M = 13.8, SD= 7.1) versus those who were not (N=56) (M 
= 8.8, SD = 7.3). This finding might suggest that the finding of fewer drinking days for all 
patients at follow-up is biased toward those who completed the follow-up interview. Sample 
sizes were too small to detect whether the relationship between drinks per day at baseline 
and follow-up completion biased the estimate of differences between study arms but in a 
larger study we would conduct a sensitivity analysis of this kind or implement weighting to 
adjust for non-response. Our findings with regard to substance use after hospital discharge 
differ from some prior studies, which, although not RCTs, found that intervention by an 
addiction consult team was associated with reduced substance use in a 30-day, 60-day, or 
6-month follow-up period (Alaja & Seppä, 2003; King et al., 2020; Wakeman et al., 2017).

This study also did not have an effect on hospital readmission rates 90-days after hospital 
discharge. This finding also might be due to the small number of participants in the study 
and the lack of power to detect small effects but could also reflect patients being readmitted 
to other hospitals in the area. However, studies suggest that more than 80% of readmissions 
return to the same hospital (Nasir et al., 2010), thus our methods for this study may have 
captured readmission for a large proportion of participants.

4.1.  Limitations

Our study was designed as a pilot to produce data to inform a full trial, thus the sample size 
is small and combines individuals with AUD and OUD; definitive estimates of treatment 
effects require a larger sample size. In addition, while the ASSIST, which we used to assess

OUD and AUD, has been validated in the primary care setting, it has not be validated in 
the hospital setting, and our use of the NSDUH to measure self-reported opioid and alcohol 
use may have resulted in underreporting at both baseline and follow-up (Reuter et al., 2021). 
Moreover, the follow-up period was only one month after hospital discharge, limiting our 
understanding of the potential longer-term effects of the intervention on substance use and 
on ongoing treatment. Additionally, our eligibility criteria specifying that the patient could 
not already have started on a medication at the hospital may have biased the sample to those 
who may have refused medication from the medical team upon initial assessment, or those 
who were not offered a medication before the study team could contact them. Our study, 
then, may be bias toward those who are less willing to start a medication or be willing to 
link to follow-up care. However, this would have biased the whole sample, not just those 
in START, and also would have biased START findings toward the null. Finally, the study 
measured readmission at only the admitting hospital. Despite these limitations, the study 
provides invaluable information for understanding the potential benefits of an addiction 
consultation team and establishes the feasibility and acceptability of the START for people 
with AUD or OUD in an inpatient hospital.

5.  Conclusions

The inpatient hospitalization is a singular opportunity to address a long-standing need for 
treatment of a substance use disorder. Although our study was not adequately powered 
to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of the START, findings suggest 
that the START is feasible to implement and acceptable to patients, and that an RCT 
to test effectiveness can be implemented in the inpatient setting. Findings do provide 
preliminary insight into the effects of the START, suggesting that it could improve initiation 
of medication treatment for patients with an alcohol or opioid use disorder during the 
hospital stay, and linkage to follow-up care after discharge. Larger trials should examine 
differential effects of the intervention on patients with AUD compared with OUD, as well 
as the potential effects of other covariates (such as pain duration, race/ethnicity and prior 
treatment) on outcomes. Although our covariate analysis did not show any differences in 
two primary outcomes (medication initiation and linkage) between patients with OUD and 
AUD, more analyses are needed with a larger sample. Additional work could examine ways 
that the intervention needs to be adapted for different populations, such as heroin versus 
prescription drug misuse, those from diverse backgrounds, and for additional team members, 
such as a peer navigator. Future research also must consider examining outcomes for a 
period longer than one month, as substance use may be limited during that time due to 
patients’ recovery from illness immediately after discharge from the hospital. A larger trial 
is critical to better understanding the important effects of this intervention on patients with 
AUD and/or OUD—two conditions that are highly prevalent among hospitalized inpatients
—but also as a model for addressing other unhealthy substance use, such as stimulant and 
cannabis use, which were high in this sample, and for addressing co-occurring mental health 
disorders.

HIGHLIGHTS

•

•

•

A hospital inpatient addiction consult team [Substance Use Treatment and 
Recovery Team (START)] consisting of an addiction medicine specialist 
and care manager is feasible to implement in the inpatient setting and is 
acceptable to patients.

Patients receiving the START intervention may be more likely to initiate 
medication treatment for substance use disorder during the inpatient stay and 
be linked to post-discharge follow-up care.

The START intervention did not result in reduced substance use; patients in 
both study conditions reduced their use in the one month after discharge.

Table notes: Controlling for baseline measures of the outcomes of interest is preferred to analyzing change scores when baseline measures may 

be imbalanced (Fu R., 2015).

**

Obtaining claims data to assess whether patients were readmitted to any hospital was beyond the scope of the current study, thus we could only 

obtain data on patients readmitted to the hospital at which we conducted the study.

Finding

(1) Proportion of patients who were discussed at least one 
time between CM and AMS

The CM or AMS discussed all patients at least 
once in the hospital.

(2) Proportion of patients who saw CM at least one time

(3) Proportion of patients who saw AMS at least one time 
(During the AMS visit, the ASM assesses the patients per 
ASAM standard of care and offers MOUD, if appropriate)

The CM and AMS each saw all but one patient; 
this patient left the hospital earlier than medically 
indicated. The CM averaged about 2.97 visits 
(median=3, SD=1.88) with patients at an average 
of 34.67 minutes per visit (SD=12.65). The AMS 
averaged about 1.68 visits (median=1, SD=1.16) at 
an average of 38.99 minutes per visit (median=45, 
SD=11.12).

(4) Proportion of patients for whom the registry had at 
least one entry during the inpatient stay and one entry after 
discharge

One hundred percent of intervention patients were 
entered in the registry to monitor them during their 
inpatient stay and through the one-month follow-
up period.

(5) Proportion of patients asked about withdrawal, substance 
use, cravings, medication adherence, and side effects during 
at least one follow-up call

Eighty-seven percent of patients got asked about 
withdrawal, substance use, cravings, medication 
adherence, and side effects during at least one 
follow-up call.

focused Action/Discharge Plan

Thirty-three (87%) patients had an addiction-
focused action plan.

(9) Proportion of patients who received at least one follow-
up call within four weeks after discharge

After discharge, the CM conducted at least one 
follow-up call with 34 (89%) patients. Of those 
patients, 30 (88%) calls were conducted within 
one week

after discharge. The average number of follow-up calls CMs conducted with 
patients was 3.58 (median=3, SD=2.30, max=10) and each call lasted an 
average of 19.13 mins (SD=8.29) minutes. Of note, a total of 23 (61%) patients 
in the intervention had follow-up appointments scheduled in the community 
before discharge; five of these were scheduled by the patient, 14 by the CM, 
and four by other staff.

Seventy-one percent of patients had a documented ASAM assessment.
