The association of early life adversities and psychosis symptoms is well documented in clini-
cal populations; however, whether this relationship also extends into subclinical psychosis
remains unclear. In particular, are early life adversities associated with increased levels of
schizotypal personality traits in non-clinical samples? We conducted a systematic review
and meta-analysis of associations between early life adversities and psychometrically
defined schizotypal traits in non-clinical samples. The review followed PRISMA guidelines.
The search using PubMed, Web of Science and EBSCO databases identified 1,609 articles
in total. Twenty-five studies (N = 15,253 participants) met eligibility criteria for the review. An
assessment of study quality showed that fewer than half of all studies were rated as method-
ologically robust. Meta-analyses showed that all forms of childhood abuse (emotional, phys-
ical and sexual) and neglect (emotional and physical) were significantly associated with
psychometric schizotypy. The association of schizotypy traits with childhood emotional
abuse (r = .33: 95%CI .30 to .37) was significantly larger than for all other form of abuse or
neglect. Meta-regression analyses showed that the physical abuse-schizotypy relationship
was stronger in samples with more women participants; and the sexual abuse-schizotypy
relationship was stronger in younger samples. The current review identifies a dose-
response relationship between all forms of abuse/neglect and schizotypy scores in non-clini-
cal samples; however, a stronger association emerged for emotional abuse. More research
is required to address the relationship of trauma types and specific symptom types. Future
research should also address the under-representation of men.

Introduction

Since the start of the last century, psychotic symptomatology has been viewed as ranging from
the extremely severe through to milder clinical and sub-clinical presentations [1, 2]. Both Bleu-
ler and Kraepelin observed that sub-clinical psychosis symptoms exist prior to onset of schizo-
phrenia and may even be observed in biological relatives of patients. The modern expression

Childhood trauma and schizotypy

of this spectrum of experience is embodied in the continuum hypothesis of psychosis, which
suggests that experiences such as hearing voices (auditory hallucinations) or delusional idea-
tion occur in less distressing forms within the non-clinical population [3–5]. These experiences
are not limited to the positive aspects of symptomatology (i.e., presence of odd feelings or
behaviours), but extend also to negative symptoms (i.e., absence or lack of normal mental
function) in non-clinical subjects [6].

Central to debates concerning the continuity of clinical, sub-clinical and healthy experi-
ences has been the concept of schizotypy, which typically encompasses a broadly-defined phe-
notype of schizophrenia-like traits and behaviours that exist in the wider general population.
The term “schizotypy” was first coined by Rado [7] and later adopted by Meehl [8], who
viewed it as a form of latent personality organisation resulting from a specific biological/
genetic predisposition. Later work by Claridge [9] clarified the distinction between models
that view schizotypy as dimensional or, as in Meehl’s case, quasi-dimensional. Fully dimen-
sional models would be those which suggest that schizotypy exists within both the healthy
(and may even confer some advantages) and pathological range [10].

The continuum between healthy and pathological also encompasses other concepts, which
have developed to describe psychosis-like experiences [PLEs; 11]. Schizotypy and PLEs refer to
similar phenomena and both terms are frequently used interchangeably [12, 13] and reported
as conceptually overlapping [14]. They might however, be distinguished in terms of the fact
that PLEs are state-based and linked to symptoms (typically positive), while schizotypy is trait-
based. Schizotypal traits are often classified into three domains that correspond to the key
symptom areas of schizophrenia: the positive domain typically incorporates traits that relate to
anomalies of cognition (e.g., paranoid ideation, ideas of reference); the negative domain
includes interpersonal, emotional and deficit traits (e.g., anhedonia, no close friends); and the
disorganisation domain includes traits related to disruptions in the ability to organise and
express thoughts and behaviour (e.g. odd behaviour and odd speech). The extent to which var-
ious conceptions of schizotypy are related to the risk of schizophrenia is a matter of debate
[15].

Amongst many risk factors, adverse childhood experiences have been linked to the experi-

ences of psychosis [16], which might include various forms of physical abuse, verbal abuse,
sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect. Adversities in childhood (occurring
before the age of 18) are common, with approximately 40% of the general adult population
reporting at least one type of adverse experience (e.g., parental mental illness, domestic vio-
lence, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, neglect) before the age of 18 [17]. Much of what is
known about the impact of childhood trauma on adult mental health is gleaned from studies
of clinical populations. Less is known about the impact of early life events on people who do
not go on to receive a clinical psychosis diagnosis. By examining non-clinical samples express-
ing high and low schizotypal traits scores, we might shed light on the differences in types and/
or levels of trauma between clinical and non-clinical populations–and potentially increase
understanding of the mechanisms through which trauma might lead to psychosis. One previ-
ous systematic review [18] of 25 studies reported that various types of childhood trauma were
associated with schizotypy. The relationship of overall trauma with schizotypy revealed odds
ratios across studies that ranged from 2.01 up to 4.15. The authors reported that associations
exist for all trauma types, but concluded that it seemed stronger for emotional abuse. While
they reported that trauma and schizotypy (especially positive traits) appeared to show a dose-
response relationship, this relationship was based on a few individual studies rather than quan-
tified and pooled across studies. Their review, which combined studies of both clinically-diag-
nosed schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) and those scoring high on self-rating schizotypy
scales classified the majority of studies (14/25) as low in quality.

PLOS ONEChildhood trauma and schizotypy

Since the review by Velikonja and colleagues [18], research in the relationship between
childhood trauma and schizotypy in non-clinical samples has grown considerably, with several
new large studies published. The aim of the current study is to systematically review the avail-
able published literature reporting associations between childhood traumatic experiences and
psychometric schizotypal traits, as well as PLEs, in non-clinical samples alone. In particular,
we will focus on the relationship between specific childhood trauma including: physical, emo-
tional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect, and psychometric schizotypy in non-clinical sam-
ples. Furthermore, we will conduct the first meta-analysis to quantify the reported associations
between trauma types and schizotypy. Hereafter, all references to emotional, physical and sex-
ual abuse, as well as physical and emotional neglect are to abuse and neglect experienced in
childhood and up to the age of 18.

Method
Search strategy

Literature searches were conducted in three major databases (PubMed, EBSCO, and Web of
Science) using the following sets of search terms:

Child� abuse OR physical abuse OR sexual abuse OR psychological abuse OR emotional
abuse OR child� trauma� OR child� advers� OR maltreat� OR bully� OR bullied OR stress�
events OR early trauma� OR emotional neglect OR physical neglect

AND

Schizoty� OR psychosis-like OR psychotic-like OR magical ideation OR suspiciousness OR
delusional ideation OR odd belie� OR eccentric behavi� OR odd speech OR constricted
affect OR unusual perceptual experiences OR ideas of reference OR paranoid ideation

Publications between January 1980 and February 2021 were covered in all searches. The
start-point was selected because the first investigations of the links between childhood trauma
and psychosis outcomes appeared in the late 1980s, and because previous reviews focussing on
clinical groups [e.g., 18, 19] failed to identify any relevant studies that took place prior to 1980.
The Reference Manager EndNote X7 was used to manage the identified articles (n = 2144) and
extract duplicates (n = 535). A total of 1609 articles were identified for title screening and 524
articles were found to be potentially relevant. Following abstract screening, 133 articles were
identified for full-text screening and subsequently 25 articles were included in the present
review (see S1 Appendix, for screened-excluded studies). All articles were independently
screened by two authors (DT and KRL).

Two studies [i.e., 20, 21] employed the same sample. Only findings from Gong, Wang (20)
are presented in this review, as they provided a more detailed account than Liu, Gong (21) on
the links between different schizotypy dimensions and various types of childhood trauma.
Wigman, van Winkel [22] and Kramer, Simons [23] used largely overlapping samples, and
thus we report only findings from the latter, based on their relevance to the current review, as
they provided results between childhood adversity and three different schizotypal outcomes–
instead of one result between a schizotypal persistent group and overall childhood trauma that
provided by the former. Sheinbaum, Racioppi [24] and Gong, Wang [25] used subsamples
from Sheinbaum, Kwapil [26] and Gong, Wang [20] respectively, and thus only results from
the latter studies were included in the current review. Although not preregistered, the review
followed PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A PRISMA

2020 compliant flow diagram tool [27] was used to provide record numbers of each stage and
reasons for reports exclusion in the full review stage (Fig 1) and the checklist documents if and
where relevant information may be located in the paper (see S2 Appendix, for the PRISMA
2020 Checklist).

Eligibility criteria

Articles had to meet the following criteria to be included in the review: (a) be an original pub-
lished research paper; (b) be written in English; (c) include a measure of childhood trauma for
events before the age of 18 years (excluding peer victimisation; i.e., bullying; to assess for
trauma where the perpetrator is an adult), (d) test for associations with schizotypy using any

standardised measure of either single symptom/trait or multidimensional schizotypal person-
ality traits in adults (aged over 18); and (e) include general population samples and not clinical
psychosis or personality disorder cases (though not necessarily screened for other personal or
family mental health problems). Screening and eligibility assessment were performed indepen-
dently by two reviewers (DT and KRL); and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Quality assessment tool

Study quality was assessed using the quality assessment tool for childhood trauma and schizo-
typal traits research designed by Velikonja, Fisher [18]. Each study was rated on: sampling
methods and sample sizes, selection and utilisation of standardised measures, and the assess-
ment of confounding variables—scores from 0 to 2 were assigned on each item testing for the
indicators. The maximum possible score for each study was 14 and the scorings (included in
Table 3) were completed independently by two raters (DT and KRL), without disagreement.

Corrected Covered Area (CCA)

We calculated the corrected covered area [CCA; 28] to determine the degree of overlap for pri-
mary studies included in the current review and the one previous systematic review of Veli-
konja, Fisher [18]. Pieper, Antoine [28] suggest that CCA scores between 0% and 5% represent
‘slight overlap’, 6%–10% ‘moderate overlap’, 11%–15% ‘high overlap’, and scores greater than
15% are considered to represent ‘very high overlap’. CCA was calculated at 6.82% and so, rep-
resents slight-moderate overlap. This undoubtedly reflects the fact that 17 non-clinical studies
have been published since Velikonja, Fisher [18] examined clinical and non-clinical samples.

Meta-analysis of correlations

The statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 2.2). All
relevant data for calculating effect sizes (correlation values, sample sizes) and moderator vari-
ables (age, percentage of women participants and year of publication) were extracted indepen-
dently by two authors (DT and KRL). Effect sizes were calculated for the correlations between
schizotypy scores and each of the following: emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse,
emotional neglect and physical neglect. All correlation coefficients were transformed to Fish-
er’s z [29]. Synthesis of individual effect sizes to summary effect sizes was completed by con-
ducting random effects meta-analyses. Results were then converted back from Fisher’s z to r
for interpretation. Heterogeneity and variance among effect sizes of studies were assessed
using the Q statistic and the I2 statistic.

Results

Following the full review stage, 25 articles were identified and included in the final analysis.
The studies originated in the following national locations: Europe = 14; USA = 6; Australia = 2;
Africa = 2; and China = 1. Quality assessment scores ranged from 4–10 out of a possible score
of 14. The mean quality score was 7.32 (SD = 1.63); and only 11/25 (44%) of the studies met
the cut-off score of 8+ used by Velikonja, Fisher [18] as a marker for the most methodologi-
cally robust studies. Study quality has remained consistent over time and shows no evidence of
more recent improvement (see Fig 2).

Sample

A total of 15,253 participants were included, with two-thirds being women (n = 10,088;
66.1%); men (n = 5,164; 33.9%). One participant self-identified their gender as ‘other’. The

mean age of participants across the 25 studies was 27.05 with a standard deviation of 12.36
(age range 18–95); median = 25.

Standardised measures of childhood trauma

Various measures were used to assess childhood trauma, including: (a) Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire, [CTQ; 30, 31]; (b) Early Trauma Inventory [ETI; 32, 33]; (c) Child Abuse and
Trauma Scale [CATS; 34]; (d) Interview for Traumatic Events in Childhood [ITEC; 35]; (e)
Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire [TLEQ; 36]; (f) Childhood Experience of Care and
Abuse [CECA; 37]; (g) General Trauma Questionnaire [GTQ; as described in 38]; (h) Trau-
matic Events Checklist [TEC; 39]; (i) Structured Psychopathological Interview and Rating of
the Social Consequences of Psychological Disturbances for Epidemiology [SPIKE; 40]; and (j)
Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire [ACE-Q; 41]. Both the CTQ and the ITEC
assess five types of childhood traumatic events, including sexual, physical, and emotional
abuse, and emotional neglect and physical neglect whilst growing up. The CATS, CECA and
ACE-Q assess all aforementioned types of adversity as well as other adversities, such as paren-
tal conflict and control, parental mental illness, substance abuse, and family member going to
prison. The ETI assesses physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as a range of general
traumatic events, such as experience of natural disasters and serious personal injury of illness
before the age of 18. The TLEQ assesses occurrence of childhood and adolescent physical and
sexual abuse, as well as other types of trauma (e.g., natural disasters, accidents, death of close
friends or relatives) throughout the lifespan. The GTQ covers four types of trauma (i.e., physi-
cal, sexual, emotional and general) that qualify as traumatic experiences in DSM-IV [42] A1
criteria for PTSD, as well as neglect. TEC captures emotional neglect, emotional, physical and
sexual abuse, as well as other types of trauma, such as threatened death or serious injury. Eight
items from the SPIKE capturing family problems, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, were

response (e.g., yes/no or Likert). It is notable that the CTQ was the most commonly used
approach to assessing childhood trauma–with 15/25 studies using the CTQ or one of its trans-
lated variants.

Standardised measures of schizotypal experiences

Different measures of schizotypy were also utilised and these included: (a) Schizotypal Person-
ality Questionnaire [SPQ; 43, 44]; (b) Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences [CAPE;
45]; (c) Schizotypal personality scale [STA; 46]; (d) Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings
and Experiences [O-LIFE; 47]; (e) Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes [SIPS;
48]; (f) Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales (WSS; including Perceptual Aberration [49]; Magical Ide-
ation [50]; Physical Anhedonia [51]; and Revised Social Anhedonia [52] scales); (g) Launay-
Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised [LSHS-R; 53]; (h) Peters et al. Delusional Inventory [PDI;
54, 55]; (i) the Prodromal Questionnaire [PQ; 56]; and (j) Five-Factor Schizotypal Inventory
[FFSI; 57]. Most scales assess the positive, negative and disorganised domains of schizotypy
that parallel the major symptom clusters of schizophrenia. The LSHS-R and PDI test for the
single schizotypal traits of hallucination and delusional ideation respectively; STA that assesses
positive schizotypy only; and WSS that does not assess disorganised traits. The PQ examines
the presence/absence of attenuated symptoms of psychosis (i.e., symptoms which are below
the level of severity that would warrant a diagnosis of a psychosis disorder) within the past
four weeks; as well as any impact those symptoms may have on social functioning, academic/
occupational functioning, and any related distress. In addition, three scales—Davos Assess-
ment of Cognitive Biases [DACOBS; 58]; the Inventory of Psychotic-like Anomalous Self-
Experiences [IPASE; 59]; and the Aberrant Salience Inventory [ASI; 60]—were included that
capture cognitive biases, such as ‘Jumping to Conclusions’, and aberrant salience (i.e., the

Association between childhood trauma and schizotypy

All studies (N = 25) reported at least one significant association between an early life adversity
and some aspect of schizotypy. Emotional and physical abuse were associated with total schizo-
typy scores—with significant correlations ranging from r = .25 [61] to r = .47 [62] and from r =
.20 [63] to r = .40 [62], respectively. Further, small-to-moderate significant associations
between an array of psychosis-like symptomatology (i.e., unusual perceptions, delusional idea-
tion, social anxiety, eccentric behaviour, constricted affect, eccentric behaviour, interpersonal
and disorganised domains) and both emotional (r = .10 to .44) and physical abuse (r = .10 to
.34) were observed across studies. For example, emotional abuse was positively associated with
ideas of reference [64], aberrant salience [65], and hallucination-like experiences [66]. Exam-
ples of associations between physical abuse and specific schizotypal traits, included unusual
perceptions [64] and delusional ideation [66].

Moderate associations were also observed between both physical and emotional neglect and

different schizotypal dimensions [66, 67]. Similarly, positive associations were observed
between sexual abuse and total schizotypy scores [61–63] as well as more specific traits, such as
paranoia and suspiciousness [68], and unusual perceptual experiences [67, 68]. However, the
associations with sexual abuse were smaller and less significant than the ones between emo-
tional/physical abuse and schizotypy. Contrary to other studies that investigated the relation-
ships of different types of childhood trauma and more than one dimensions of schizotypy,
Steel, Marzillier [68] did not find an association with emotional abuse. Two studies reported
associations in the aforementioned types of adversities and schizotypal traits for men and
women separately [i.e., 61, 69]. Toutountzidis and colleagues found that physical abuse showed

links with an array of schizotypal traits only in women, that emotional abuse associated with
an array of schizotypal traits in both genders and that sexual abuse did not have a link with
schizotypy. However, Berenbaum and colleagues found links between various types of adver-
sity (i.e., physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, and physical neglect) and schizotypy in both
genders.

Cristobal-Narvaez, Sheinbaum [70] investigated links of total scores of abuse and neglect
with psychosis-like, paranoia, having no thoughts or emotions, and negative affect domains.
Overall, total scores of abuse and neglect were linked to psychosis-like paranoia, and negative
affect domains, whereas no thoughts/emotions were linked only to neglect. Similarly, Ale-
many, Arias [71] examined links between both abuse and neglect with both positive and nega-
tive schizotypy dimensions. They reported significant links between childhood abuse and the
positive dimension of schizotypy. Links between abuse and negative dimension of schizotypy,
as well as neglect and both positive and negative dimensions were not found to be significant.
Uniquely, significant bivariate generalised estimating equations of other types of childhood
traumatic experiences (i.e., family problems, conflicts between parents, disliked, rejected, and
repeated fights) on overall schizotypal signs were reported by Ro¨ssler, Hengartner [72]. Most
studies employed cross-sectional designs–apart from Ro¨ssler, Hengartner [72] (prospective
community study), and Kramer, Simons [23] (prospective twin study). Table 3 includes
detailed results of all examined studies.

Overall, various types of childhood trauma (e.g., physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual
abuse, and neglect) and different schizotypy dimensions (e.g., positive, negative, disorganised)
were observed to be associated across studies. This tripartite distinction was made based on
the multidimensional nature of schizotypy–and by extension schizophrenia, with the positive
dimension including disruptions in the content of thought and perceptual experiences (e.g.,
delusional ideation, hallucination, odd beliefs); negative dimension including diminished
functioning (e.g., avolition, anhedonia); and disorganised dimension including disruptions in
thought organisation and expression [123, 124]. Table 4 includes the numbers of times each of
these trauma types were found to be significantly associated with schizotypy, as well as the
times these associations were not observed to be significant. The numbers represent all find-
ings within studies.

In terms of a simple vote count of reported associations, certain consistent associations
emerge between trauma types and specific dimensions of schizotypy. Childhood emotional
abuse invariably correlated with the negative dimension and with total schizotypy scores;
Childhood neglect (physical and emotional) with the disorganised dimension; and finally,
total childhood trauma scores with positive dimension scores.

Meta-analysis

For those studies (in Table 3) reporting correlations between total schizotypy scores and key
abuse and neglect measures: emotional abuse (k = 11), physical abuse (k = 13), sexual abuse
(k = 12), emotional neglect (k = 7) and physical neglect (k = 9), data were pooled in a series of
meta-analyses. Total schizotypy scores were selected as the outcome variable because insuffi-
cient numbers of studies provided data that could be used to examine schizotypal dimensions
or more specific symptoms.

All correlation coefficients were transformed to Fisher’s z. Synthesis of individual effect
sizes to summary effect sizes was completed by conducting random effects meta-analyses; and
results were then converted back from Fisher’s z to r for interpretation. Heterogeneity and var-
iance among effect sizes of studies were assessed using Cochran’s Q statistic and the I2 statistic.
Cochran’s Q is calculated as the weighted sum of squared differences between individual study

effects and the pooled effect across studies. The I2 statistic (which can be derived from the Q)
is an intuitive expression of heterogeneity which describes the percentage of variation across
studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. An I2 of 0% was taken to indicate no observed
heterogeneity, 25% for low, 50% for moderate and 75% for high heterogeneity [see 125]. All
meta-analyses used a random effects model and analysis was conducted using Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis (version 2.2).

The pooled effect sizes for the associations between abuse/neglect types and schizotypy are

presented in Table 5. Significant associations were found between schizotypal traits and all
forms of abuse and neglect, and all effect sizes were highly heterogeneous. The association for
emotional abuse was significantly larger than for all other forms of abuse and neglect (physical
Q = 15.58, p < .001; sexual Q = 5.27, p = .02; emotional neglect Q = 6.11, p = .01; physical
neglect Q = 4.53, p = .03); and no other abuse/neglect effects sizes differed significantly from
each other.

Publication bias

We conducted Trim and Fill analyses for publication bias. Trim and Fill analysis both identi-
fies and corrects for asymmetry in funnel plots that reflects possible publication bias [126] e.g.
with smaller studies producing larger outlying effect sizes in one direction. The method ‘trims’
the smaller studies underpinning the funnel plot asymmetry, the trimmed funnel plot is used
to estimate the true ‘centre’ of the funnel and then replaces the missing studies around the cen-
tre. The final estimate of the true mean, and its variance, are then based on the ‘filled’ funnel
plot.

PLOS ONEChildhood trauma and schizotypy

Analysis of emotional abuse indicated two possible missing studies, reducing the effect size
to .31 (95% CI .27 to .36); for physical abuse, three missing studies reduced the effect size to .17
(95% CI .12 to .22); none were identified for sexual abuse; two were missing for emotional
neglect, reducing the effect size to .18 (95% CI .10 to .26); and none were missing for physical
neglect. Nonetheless, the numbers of studies are quite small in some analyses and so, the find-
ings on publication bias may be unreliable.

Following Cohen’s guidance for interpreting r effect sizes (small = .10, med = .30 and large

= .50; [127]), the effect size for childhood emotional abuse is in the medium range; while all
other trauma types (physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect and emotional neglect in
childhood) were in the small effect size range. This suggests that while all types of abuse and
neglect in childhood are associated with schizotypy, childhood emotional abuse is more
strongly associated; and was significantly more strongly associated with schizotypy scores than
any other type of trauma. We also note that heterogeneity was moderate-to large in all
analyses.

Meta-regression

Although there is no definitive minimum number of studies required for meta-regression, we
follow the general recommendation of the Cochrane group with at least 6 to 10 studies for a
continuous variable [128, see also 129].

Using meta-regression, we examined age and gender (proportion of women participants),

study quality, as well as year of publication as moderators of effect sizes (using a Method of
Moments meta-regression approach: see Table 6). The mean ages across studies ranged from
18.70 to 44.80 and the mean proportion of women participants ranged from 49.33 to 100%.

Age was a significant moderator of the effect sizes for sexual abuse and emotional neglect.

Effect sizes for sexual abuse were larger in younger participants while those for emotional
neglect were larger in older participants. Gender (proportion of women participants) moder-
ated the association between physical abuse and schizotypy, with larger associations in studies
with more women participants. Finally, year of publication was a significant moderator for
emotional and physical neglect, with older studies reporting larger effects for both forms of
neglect.

We also looked at a multiple predictor meta-regression model including age and gender to

predict the relationship between childhood trauma and schizotypy and the results did not
change. Gender continued to moderate the impact of physical abuse on schizotypy (Z = 2,14, p
= .03), while age was ns (Z = 0.79, p = .43). Age was a significant predictor (Z = -2.5, p = .01) of
the sexual-abuse-schizotypy relationship, while gender was not (Z = -0.81, p = .42). Finally,

tional abuse-schizotypy association.

Discussion

This systematic review identified 25 studies examining the association of childhood trauma
and schizotypy in 15,253 non-clinical individuals. The current meta-analyses are the first to
estimate the pooled effect size for the association between various forms of childhood abuse/
neglect and schizotypy in subclinical samples and the emerging importance of this area of
research is underscored by 17 of the 25 (68%) studies reviewed here being published since the
sole previous systematic review by Velikonja, Fisher [18].

Schizotypy scores were significantly associated with all forms of abuse and neglect in a man-
ner that is consistent with a dose-response interpretation. Almost all studies and their analyses
report significant positive correlations between schizotypy and various forms of abuse and
neglect (emotional abuse 11/11; physical abuse 10/13; sexual abuse 11/12; emotional neglect 7/
7; and physical neglect 9/9). The current meta-analyses are however the first to quantify and
compare the relative degree of association between these different forms of childhood trauma
and schizotypy. Although schizotypy was significantly associated with all forms of abuse and
neglect, only the associations with emotional abuse exceed the small range with an r = .33
(equivalent to an OR = 3.55). The association of schizotypal traits with emotional abuse was in
the moderate range and crucially, significantly larger than the association for all other forms of
abuse and neglect (where effect sizes did not differ significantly from each other).

Our assessment indicated that the mean study quality ranking was marginally lower than
the suggested cut-off for individual studies to be identified as methodologically robust [see 18].
Hence, most studies failed to meet the suggested cut-off. We also note that study quality has
remained relatively low across time, with no signs of any recent increase. Despite this, study
quality was not a significant moderator of the relationship between schizotypy and any of form
of abuse or neglect. It is of course possible that the quality measure used fails to adequately cap-
ture some potentially relevant variability in study quality, although studies did show variability
in quality scores (range 4–10 on a scale of 0–14). Certain specific areas of methodological
weakness might however be identified. In particular, the vast majority of studies (21/25) failed
to control for, assess or comment upon possible confounds–such as controlling for demo-
graphic variables, family history, current levels of anxiety or depression and so on.

The studies were well-powered–taking the smallest effect size being 0.2 (for physical abuse)
would require 150 participants to detect at 80% power. All studies included in the meta-analy-
ses except two [62, 82] had sufficient sample size (with a median in excess of 400) to detect
even the smallest effect size reported here. This power analysis would of course apply to detect-
ing a simple correlation; however, most studies are assessing a range of associations between
various types of trauma and various schizotypal traits and any power assessment needs to
accommodate multiple testing. The current meta-analysis and effect sizes, hopefully provide
some basis for more specific hypothesis testing in future studies.

The stronger association between emotional abuse and schizotypy suggests a more consis-

tent and pervasive link than appears to occur with either sexual or physical abuse. The latter
forms of abuse differ from emotional abuse insofar as they might be linked more to individual
abusive acts. Emotional abuse is also likely to accompany these other forms of abuse and
neglect, and may heighten the effect of other abusive acts [130, 131]. It is also feasible that emo-
tional abuse has a more pervasive influence partly because it might persist undetected for lon-
ger. Related to the potentially pervasive and interactive influence of emotional abuse, one
limitation of current studies is that they rarely assess the independent contributions of specific

PLOS ONEChildhood trauma and schizotypy

abuse/neglect types and so effect size estimates may be non-independent. Two studies [63, 69]
have however attempted to look at the independent impact of trauma types within a regression
framework. Goodall, Rush [63] looked at emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emo-
tional neglect and physical neglect as predictors of schizotypy scores (in 283 non-clinical par-
ticipants) and found that only emotional abuse remained significant when all predictors were
entered together. More recently, Toutountzidis, Gale [69] used a similar regression-based
approach finding that schizotypy scores were significantly predicted by both emotional and
physical abuse, although only emotional abuse remained a significant predictor when gender
was entered into the model.

Our meta-analyses identified substantial levels of heterogeneity for all effect sizes, with I2
values ranging from 68–87%. We explored this heterogeneity using meta-regression by focus-
ing on the key participant variables of age and gender as well as study quality and year of publi-
cation. Velikonja, Fisher [18] speculated that exploring age and gender differences as possible
mediators of the childhood trauma-schizotypy relationship might aid our understanding of
the aetiology of psychotic symptoms and psychotic disorders. We found that age was a signifi-
cant predictor of the sexual abuse-schizotypy association, with stronger associations emerging
in younger samples. Age also significantly moderated the emotional neglect-schizotypy rela-
tionship, but associations were stronger in older samples. The opposing impact of age in these
two types of trauma raises the possibility that additional variables are likely to be relevant. For
example, age may impact how people process memories regarding maltreatment in childhood
and this may depend upon the type of trauma experienced. It is also possible that temporal
changes in social norms are relevant, such that earlier adverse events are not viewed as nega-
tively as they might be now or the likelihood of such events may even have reduced across
time.

Turning to gender, the physical abuse-schizotypy link was larger in samples containing
more women participants. Given the importance of gender in studies of trauma in clinical psy-
chosis groups, surprising we identified only two non-clinical studies reporting associations
separately for men and for women [61, 69]. Reviews have documented gender differences in
the prevalence of different traumas reported in psychosis patients [132, 133]; however, the
findings are not always consistent and crucially, we should not assume that trauma and schizo-
typy (or indeed psychosis) shows the same dose-response across men and women. For exam-
ple, Toutountzidis, Gale (69) found that while men reported significantly more physical
trauma experienced in childhood than women, it failed to correlate with schizotypy in men,
but did in women. As noted above, the moderating role of gender was also borne out by our
meta-regression analyses showing that the physical abuse-schizotypy link was stronger in stud-
ies with more women as participants. Turning to the role of age, the link between sexual abuse
and schizotypy scores was larger in younger samples and several possible explanations exist.
For example, it may be that sexual abuse differentially impacts schizotypy in those who are
younger. Another possibility is that older samples are less willing to report sexual abuse (and/
or that younger samples feel safer to disclose on this topic) and this the apparently stronger
association in the younger is a confounded by willingness to reveal. The sampling is however
somewhat skewed in terms of both age (with a median age of 25) and gender. The ratio of
women to men participants in the studies reviewed here is around 2:1; and all studies except
one [82] had a majority of women participants. The broadening of the focus onto older and
more men as participants is something future studies should address.

Although the overwhelming majority of studies report significant associations between
early childhood trauma and schizotypy, a key unanswered question centres on whether any
specific adversities are more reliably associated with any specific trait domains or symptoms.
This review identifies considerable variation in the types of measures used, but crucially also at

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270494 June 29, 2022

PLOS ONEChildhood trauma and schizotypy

the level of analysis. Some have calculated a total score for early life adversities [70] while more
recent studies have tended to separately assess different types of adversity (e.g., physical, emo-
tional, sexual abuse and neglect: e.g., [69, 81, 86]). Similarly, some studies [64, 66, 67, 88]
assessed several schizotypy dimensions (e.g., cognitive-perceptual, interpersonal, disorga-
nised), some have broken these domains down further into multiple trait subscales (e.g., 8 sub-
scales: [64]; 9 subscales: [69]), subscales and total scores [e.g., 88] while others have assessed
total schizotypy scores only [e.g., 61]. Although variability in the level of analysis is likely to
contribute to the high heterogeneity of effect sizes, the data did not permit looking at this in a
sub-group analysis. Nonetheless, a simple vote-count suggests that certain relationships seem
promising with some invariable associations emerging. The most consistent association being
reported for childhood emotional abuse both with negative schizotypal traits (e.g., anhedonia,
no close friends) (20/20 associations) and with total schizotypy scores (10/10); for physical/
emotional neglect (6/6 studies) and the disorganised domain (e.g. odd behaviour and odd
speech); and for total trauma scores (11/11 studies) with the positive domain (e.g., paranoid
ideation, ideas of reference). It is notable that childhood sexual abuse showed inconsistent
associations with the various schizotypy domains—being significant in 11/32 assessments for
the positive domain; 3/23 for the negative domain; and 4/8 for disorganisation—but did show
more reliable association with total schizotypy scores (10/14). We note however that vote-
counts do not accommodate sample size differences across studies, statistical power, or the
size of effects in studies and not an alternative to meta-analysis [134]. Unfortunately, it was not
possible to derive sufficiently consistent levels and types of data to meta-analyse more specific
associations between traumas and specific domains or even symptoms.

Little work has thus far focused at the symptom-specific level of analysis. For example, in

the case of voice-hearing, only one study [66] has thus far examined the relationship with
trauma. Looking at a student sample, Cole and colleagues [66] found significant links between
self-reported auditory hallucinations (LSHS) and all types of childhood traumas (sexual, physi-
cal, and emotional abuse, and neglect); and for self-reported delusional ideation (PDI-21) with
all traumas apart from sexual abuse. This lack of attention is surprising given that so many
studies of clinical samples with psychosis have reported links between sexual trauma and
voice-hearing and delusions (for a recent meta-analysis, see [135]. The links between trauma
and specific symptoms clearly merits further research in non-clinical samples.

Strengths and limitations

Although a major advantage of this review is the large number of participants and studies, the
variety of measurement approaches meant that meta-analyses were limited to broad-brush
approaches. Different studies of course have different aims and employ different measurement
scales to assess both childhood trauma and schizotypy. In the case of measuring the latter,
studies also vary considerably in whether they report total scores, domain (e.g., positive, nega-
tive, disorganised) subscale scores, or indeed, employ measures focussed specifically on symp-
toms (e.g., hallucinations or delusions). In general, studies assessing general population
samples have not made a concerted effort to establish the parallels of the same trauma-symp-
tom links highlighted in the clinical literature. For example, clinical studies have tended to
emphasise the relationships of trauma types with specific symptoms such as delusions and hal-
lucinations [135]. Future research would benefit from focusing on how childhood trauma
might impact specific trait clusters/domains and symptoms in the healthy population. This
would then make it more possible to look not just at more specific links, but to make more
comparisons with the existing clinical literature.

PLOS ONEChildhood trauma and schizotypy

Turning to other measurement issues, ultimately the strength of reported relationships
between trauma and schizotypy depend upon the reliabilities of the measures themselves.
Although questions have arisen about the reliability of the self-reporting of childhood adversi-
ties in the context of clinical psychosis [e.g., 136], retrospective reports by psychosis patients
are stable over time, not especially influenced by current psychopathology, consistent across
different assessment instruments and correspond with clinical case notes [e.g., 137]. The most
common measure of childhood trauma employed was the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire,
[CTQ; 30, 31] being used in 15 of the 25 studies. A recent review [138] of 52 child abuse mea-
surement instruments reported that the CTQ was the most thoroughly investigated and has
the strongest levels of evidence overall and strong for: internal consistency, reliability, content
validity, structural validity and convergent (hypothesis testing) validity. While we could find
no evidence on the reliability of trauma reporting in schizotypy, recall is less likely to be
affected by psychosis-like experiences or memory/cognitive deficits; although those with psy-
chometrically defined schizotypy do show relatively subtle cognitive deficits on neuropsycho-
logical tests [139]; see also [140] for a recent meta-analysis. We also note that even when
objective cognition is intact on testing, schizotypy has also been associated with subjective cog-
nitive problems that may not be detectable on objective tests [141]. So, we cannot exclude the
possibility that mild or subjective forms of cognitive impairment, including for memory and
executive function, might impact memory recall and reliability in schizotypy.

Six studies used a scale that tests for prodromal attenuated psychosis symptoms [65, 74, 81,
89, 110, 112]. Although these studies did not measure schizotypal traits per se, it is difficult to
confidently assert whether they examine trait-like or state-like subclinical symptoms of psy-
chosis for two key reasons. First, the cross-sectional nature of the studies does not permit a test
of symptom/trait persistence. Second, all measures use similar questions to assess psychosis-
like experiences in non-clinical samples (e.g., Have you had the sense that some person or
force is around you, although you couldn’t see anyone?; both in PQ and SPQ). Third, only two
studies using state measures were included in the meta-analyses [65, 74] and while these state
measures revealed correlations that were a little smaller, they did not differ significantly from
trait measure effect sizes. So, despite variability in the tests used and the level at which scoring
occurs, the pattern of associations across studies and measures was robust.

A clear limitation concerns the failure of most studies to meet the suggested cut-off for
robust methodological quality; and that study quality has showed no signs of improving in
recent years. While Velikonja, Fisher [18] noted study quality variability in their review, the 17
newer studies added here since that previous review do not evidence any recent increase in
quality. We also note that individual quality items assessed here were not weighted and so, any
simple comparisons across studies using summed total quality scores should be regarded with
some caution [see 142–144]. In this context, we note that an area of specific methodological
weakness has been the lack of control for potential confounding variables. For example, studies
rarely screened for existing mental health problems, with only 4/25 (16%) screening for previ-
ous or current mental health disorders [65, 86, 88, 110] and one screened for possible neuro-
logical problems [71].

We also note the lack of diversity in sampling to date. Most studies have sampled exclu-
sively from undergraduate students (16/25: 64%) and as already noted the ratio of women:
men being approximately 2:1. The younger age (median 25) is perhaps understandable given
the typical age of onset for psychosis-like symptoms–indeed, some studies have used this ratio-
nale for excluding participants outside of the 18–35 age range [e.g., 89]. The focus on more
highly educated samples limits representativeness much more–certainly with comparison to
the educational attainment of those with psychosis. In this context, we were also unable to
assess whether ethnicity impacted effect sizes. Only one-in-three studies (9/25: [61, 62, 64, 66,

69, 71, 81, 89, 112]) provided any ethnicity breakdown. All apart from Alemany, Arias [71]
were from the UK or USA and these identified a median proportion of white participants at
75%. The role of ethnicity is important here given evidence that the perceived discrimination
in early life may be linked to later psychosis-like experiences [145–147]. This means that sam-
ples have often focused on largely young, highly-educated women and often lack information
on ethnicity.

Of those that we considered to consist of general population samples, some were clearly
constrained by their sampling techniques. Amongst the remainder, Berenbaum, Valera (62)
“sought respondents with unusual beliefs (e.g. belief in UFOs)” (p. 144); Fekih-Romdhane,
Nsibi [82] assessed the unaffected siblings of those diagnosed with schizophrenia; Mongan,
Shannon [112] recruited using the online paid participant pool from Mechanical Turk;
Gaweda, Goritz [65] also from an online academic participant panel (called WiSO); Powers,
Thomas [64] recruited from obstetric/gynaecological clinics; and Ro¨ssler, Hengartner [72]
recruited a prospective study from amongst men conscripts and women on the electoral regis-
ter in Zurich from mid 1970s. Finally, Toutountzidis, Gale [69] sampled the general public
using an online survey and Startup [120] who used a university voluntary participant panel.

We also note that only three studies screened out participants with any personal history of
mental disorder [65, 86, 88], another for psychotic disorders [110] and one screened for a fam-
ily history of suicide [86]. There were several studies that did not exclude family and personal
history of mental health problems [e.g., 20, 63, 66, 67, 74] or whose sampling did not exclude
those with self-declared mental health issues [69]. None screened and excluded for a family
history of mental disorder. Indeed, family history was an inclusion criterion in one study i.e.
the study of unaffected twins of those with schizophrenia [82].

Of course, the conclusion of the current systematic review and meta-analysis are prone to

the limitations of correlational research generally. Aside from psychosis-like experiences
occurring as a consequence of childhood adversity, the correlational nature of the research
does mean that we should acknowledge alternative interpretations. In particular, trauma may
result as a consequence of psychosis symptoms or in full-blown psychosis, as a result of invol-
untary treatment experiences [148, 149]. Despite this, given the subclinical levels of psychosis
symptoms in adulthood, it seems less likely that trauma is induced by subclinical psychosis-
like experiences earlier in childhood.

Finally, as with psychosis, the links between early life trauma and schizotypy are undoubt-
edly complex and possible confounding factors cannot be eliminated. For example, it is known
that higher levels of parental mental health problems are associated with various forms of
abuse. Doidge, Higgins [150] assessed a range of possible child, parent and family risk factors
for child maltreatment in a prospective 27-year population-based birth cohort of 2443 Austra-
lians. They found that parental mental health problems were associated with high intensity
emotional abuse (OR = 2.06), low intensity emotional abuse (OR = 1.90), neglect (OR = 3.60),
physical (OR = 2.31) and sexual abuse (OR = 3.33). It is also possible that children living with a
parent who has mental health problems might view this as a form of trauma [see 151]. Future
studies need to control for parental mental health status.

Conclusions

This review shows that significant associations exist between childhood trauma and psycho-
metrically defined schizotypy in the non-clinical population. While much research has focused
on links between early life trauma and adult psychosis, including a possible causal role [19],
the current findings show that trauma in childhood does not necessarily lead to the develop-
ment of clinical presentations of psychosis. Such early life experiences may however impact

the development and maintenance of potentially dysfunctional experiences and ways of think-
ing that remain sub-clinical. Despite the limitations of cross-sectional studies in terms of deriv-
ing causal inferences, studying childhood adversities that do not lead to clinical outcomes is as
important as where they do–informing discussion around why some people are more ‘resil-
ient’ than others.
