Editorial on the Research Topic

The Impact of Migration and Resettlement on Health

Migration and displacement are growing phenomena globally that can aﬀect the health and
development of host countries. Migrants, deﬁned as a continuum (e.g., regular/irregular/seeking
asylum/seeking refugee) can present as a susceptible population for the public health system. For
example, in relation to environmental health, the risk for lead poisoning among African refugee
children who resettle in the United States (US) remains elevated compared to resident children (1).
Resettlement can be a contentious issue for some communities who struggle with the capacity to
provide essential services to their existing residents never mind newcomers. Examples of challenges
include inadequate translation services; unsafe housing; insuﬃcient public transportation; and
a lack of employment opportunities. Further, immigration is generally followed by behavioral,
lifestyle, and environmental changes that can signiﬁcantly increase the risk of disease in the
early generations of immigrants. Understanding these changes and exploring their structural
determinants is a pivotal step toward a better appreciation of immigrant health and the design
of culturally sensitive interventions. As these newcomers provide every community with a richness
of labor, culture, language, and history that contributes to the “melting pot” spirit of communities,
current social, political, and healthcare structures must be reviewed to address the challenges of
migration and displacements.

Applying a strict deﬁnition, the word immigrant characterizes individuals who have voluntarily
or willingly left their countries of origin and legally moved to another country to live. They have
some form of resettlement or permission that allows them to work legally. The main reasons for the
resettlement are usually related to economic prosperity, career opportunities, a better education,
a better quality of life, or a family reunion. It includes a lengthy formal process and required
planning, as well as previous knowledge of the local spoken and written language to comply with
speciﬁc institutional and legal requirements. Therefore, immigrants always begin their journey as
migrants. Yet, although they may stay for an extended period in one single country, they do not
necessarily end their journey as migrant settlers. It is essential to make that distinction, as language
barriers and the ability to engage and to contribute to the local economy plays a major role in their
resettlement. Essentially, a sense of belonging, promotion of integration and social inclusion in their
new community can have a substantial positive impact on an individual’s wellbeing, thus increasing
the potential toward better health outcomes due to a broader range of choices. Fundamentally,

Editorial: The Impact of Migration and Resettlement on Health

these transitions can be less dramatic than the new patterns of
modern slavery and less traumatic than the violence of forced
migration, due to natural disasters, which occur unpredictably.
Individuals,
in these instances, may encounter themselves
alone, in a strange land, within unfamiliar environments and
experiencing challenges that are exacerbated by a lack of language
skills (2, 3).

The overarching aim of this Research Topic was to gather
a collection of independent research papers to advance the
understanding of the complex interaction between migration and
health by utilizing a range of disciplinary and methodological
approaches to explore these intersectoral relationships. This
Research Topic also examined how public health issues are
managed in a community that excels or struggles with resettling
refugees and migrants. The theme was presented as being
broad in scope to encourage the discussion of not only the
diverse challenges posed by this vulnerable population but also
the ability of the community’s public health and healthcare
infrastructure to eﬀectively manage (or not) these issues. The
role of gender, race/ethnicity, age, nationality, pregnancy status,
physical environment, and the cumulative nature of the social
determinants of health are explored to demonstrate that migrants
are a heterogeneous group. Policymakers and researchers need to
understand this plurality when planning for communities with
diverse populations.

This editorial aims to provide an overview of the key ﬁndings
of the papers published in the Research Topic on The Impact
of Migration and Resettlement on Health. Upon review of the
papers, four overarching themes were identiﬁed:

COVID-19 IMPACT AND RACIAL AND
ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION

immigrants, and refugees. As a result of

COVID-19 signiﬁcantly impacted not only the functioning
of healthcare, education, housing, and employment systems
globally, but it also exacerbated the health inequities experienced
by marginalized populations, especially racial and ethnic
the
minorities,
socioeconomic, political, and demographic proﬁle of
these
vulnerable populations (e.g., economic segregation, overcrowded
housing, exclusion from healthcare services, and cultural and
linguistic barriers), many are at increased risk of contracting
COVID-19 and experiencing signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality
(4–6). Caron and Adegboye examine the COVID-19 through the
lens of a syndemic and highlight the interactions among the social
determinants of health. The authors propose that a bi-directional
relationship exists between the social determinants of health (e.g.,
employment, education, housing, poverty, healthcare access) and
the COVID-19 syndemic thus exacerbating the impact of this
novel disease for at-risk populations. An integrated approach is
presented which incorporates the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention’s Essential Public Health Services framework
with the World Health Organization’s Health for All scaﬀold
when considering how individual, structural, sociocultural, and
socioeconomic factors interact with each other to result in

a disparate risk for marginalized populations with respect to
contracting and transmitting COVID-19.

The discussion about the disproportionate risk racial and
ethnic minorities face in the age of COVID-19 is noted as
the US Latinx population have experienced the second highest
hospitalization and mortality rate from COVID-19 compared
to Black minorities (7). Like other vulnerable populations, the
Latinx population has experienced continual discrimination
with respect to housing, education, employment, and healthcare
access, as well as discrimination from law and immigration
enforcement (8–10). Martinez et al. comprehensively describe
racism and the diﬀerent types that have adversely impacted
marginalized populations historically with an emphasis on the
Latinx population. The authors propose a research agenda
that incorporates the use of biobehavioral research to further
explore the physiological embodiment (e.g., chronic mental and
cardiometabolic disease) of racism and social inequities among
the Latinx populations. The purpose of studying this area could
inform institutional and behavioral interventions. As the US is
acknowledging, openly discussing, and attempting to address
racial inequity at a local, state, and national level, the authors
conclude with a call to action by which to include the Latinx
population in the materialization of racism research.

DIFFERENTIAL UTILIZATION OF
HEALTHCARE SERVICES

In the US, the use of emergency rooms or services as a form of
primary care has been associated with a lack of health insurance, a
lack of access to primary care, low socioeconomic status, patient’s
perception of the severity of health issues, and convenience (11).
In Germany, ∼20 million people are treated in an emergency
service setting with fewer than half being admitted to the hospital
(12, 13). Further, one-third of the patients accessing emergency
services could be treated by a general practitioner as their health
complaint is not life-threatening (14). The use of emergency
services among migrants across Europe has been reported to be
higher when compared to non-migrants (15). Sauzet et al. explore
the utilization of emergency services among ﬁrst- and second-
generation migrants and non-migrants at internal medicine and
gynecology services in Berlin, Germany. Based on the analysis
conducted, the authors conclude that there is a diﬀerence
between the utilization needs and purposes of emergency services
among this population sector. Factors contributing to these
diﬀerences could include varying levels of patient expectations
and health literacy levels. The authors recommend that the
existing healthcare system be re-structured to enable access
to healthcare services for a diverse population and that this
information be communicated in a way that is understood by a
diverse group.

The challenge of healthcare utilization by migrants in their
resettled community is often compounded by numerous barriers
(e.g., cultural competence, low health literacy, low socioeconomic
status, discrimination and racism)
(16). Further, diﬀerent
countries that comprise the European Union often have speciﬁc
regulations about the types of healthcare services migrants can

access. For example, Germany, Belgium, and Denmark provide
access to emergency services while Spain provides guaranteed
healthcare to all residents and due to reporting requirements
in other countries, migrants are dissuaded from accessing
health care altogether (17–19). Serre-Delcor et al. examine the
health needs and barriers experienced by migrants resettled
in Spain when they attempt to access health services. The
authors conducted a perception-based cross-sectional survey
among social and healthcare professionals who provide care to
recently arrived migrants and noted three key ﬁndings. First,
these professionals perceive new migrants as arriving with worse
health status, poor mental health status, and are less likely to
misuse the healthcare system when compared to the native
population. Second, health professionals perceived a lack of
adequate understanding of migrant health rights and recommend
that recently arrived migrants be better informed of their rights
when in their host country. Third, the main barriers identiﬁed by
health professionals when working with the migrant population
included language and cultural competence issues. The authors
conclude by calling for more evidence-based research in this
area to help inform health professionals who work with this
vulnerable population.

It is important to note that the major disparities in integration
policies around the world reﬂect
the major diﬀerences in
integration outcomes and attitudes around the world. The
integration policies identiﬁed by the Migration Integration Policy
Index (MIPEX) also shape how immigrants and the public
respond to these inequalities. A country’s approach to integration
strongly inﬂuences the public’s attitudes and behavior toward
immigrants. Integration policies are one of the strongest factors
shaping the public’s willingness to accept and interact with
immigrants (20).

HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND
WELLBEING

to the current global COVID-19 pandemic,
Even prior
refugee
resettlement has been a stressful process often
characterized by social isolation, lack of access to resources, poor
language proﬁciency, economic hardship, and perceived/actual
discrimination which can adversely aﬀect one’s mental health
(21, 22). Research in this area communicates a need to further
examine this issue in more depth with respect
to gender
diﬀerences in response to resettlement stress and mental health
status. For example, a survey of Afghan refugees who resettled
in the US determined that lower stress was experienced by
females but not males who reported English proﬁciency and
strong family ties. Males reported higher stress than females
concerning acculturation dissonance (23, 24). Due to the dearth
of research on gender-speciﬁc issues regarding post-resettlement
stressors for refugees, Nissen et al. examine gender-speciﬁc
associations of post-migration stressors with an emphasis on
subjective wellbeing and the impact of social support among
Syrian refugees resettled in Sweden. The authors report that
social and ﬁnancial hardships experienced post-resettlement
have an adverse eﬀect on male Syrian refugees. The authors

recommend further research be conducted in this area along
with the development of gender-sensitive policies aimed at
reducing psychological distress.

PHYSICAL
ACTIVITY/OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY

Physical activity is a modiﬁable health determinant
that
contributes to poor health and mortality globally (25). One’s level
of physical activity is inﬂuenced by gender, race/ethnicity, and
education level (26–28). Norwegians are considered relatively
active in part due to the accessibility of safe, natural spaces, as
well as the value placed on physical activity for good health
(29, 30). Calogiuri et al. examine the physical activity habits of
recent Italian immigrants to Norway, as well as identifying factors
that inﬂuence health behaviors among immigrant populations in
general. Speciﬁcally, the purpose of the authors’ work was 3-fold:
(1) examine the extent to which recently immigrated Italians to
Norway perceived their move as having a positive or negative
impact on their physical activity practices; (2) compare the
physical activity proﬁle between Italians and Norwegians; and (3)
identify diﬀerences among the Italian immigrant physical activity
proﬁle related to key sociodemographic factors. The authors
report that a signiﬁcant majority of Italian immigrants perceived
that they were as active in Norway, if not more so, compared
they stayed in Italy. Physical activity variables (e.g.,
to if
sitting time, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity frequency
and duration) were not diﬀerent between the two populations,
although the Italians queried reported participating in gym
exercise more so than the Norwegian population. Sedentary
levels were reported in males with a lower educational level,
Italians with higher education levels, and those who lived
in less urbanized environments. The authors propose that
it is important to study how people who move within the
European Economic Area engage with opportunities, the culture,
and social factors that inﬂuence physical activity with respect
to migration.

Obesity is another complex and signiﬁcant public health
challenge (31). Studies have shown that Black women of African
heritage residing in high-income countries are more likely
to enter pregnancy either overweight or obese compared to
their White counterparts (32, 33). Further evidence suggests
that engagement in physical activity or healthy diet practices
during pregnancy or the post-partum period can prevent
excessive gestational weight gain and post-partum weight
retention (34–39). Thus, improving these health behaviors in
minority populations requires culturally sensitive healthcare
interventions that consider factors including access to care,
health beliefs and practices (40–42). Moore et al. conducted
a systematic review and thematic evidence synthesis of select
peer-reviewed databases using the Capability-Opportunity-
Motivation Behavioral change theoretical model. The authors
report that women’s behaviors at this life-stage are inﬂuenced
by motivational
factors (e.g., weight gain being good for
a growing baby, safety concerns about exercising during
pregnancy). Social norms, including acceptance of a diﬀerent

these women. Women reported
having low self-conﬁdence in their ability to lose weight
post-partum. The authors propose that behavior change
techniques including social support, implementation of credible
resources, and demonstrations may be helpful when supporting
lifestyle change.

Further, one’s socioeconomic status has been demonstrated to
be an important health determinant for obesity. For example,
research from developed countries has demonstrated that
populations of low socioeconomic status are at an increased
risk of obesity compared to their high socioeconomic status
counterparts (43, 44). Research also suggests that the change in
socioeconomic status that often accompanies the transition for
migrants from rural-to-urban settings may lead to an increased
risk of obesity (45). Wang et al. examined the Yi Migrants
Study to determine the following: (1) whether there was an
association between socioeconomic status and the prevalence
of overweight and obesity in Yi migrants who immigrated
from rural-to-urban environments, and; (2) whether diﬀerences
in these indicators varied by the age of arrival
in their
urban community. The authors did identify an age-dependent
association between socioeconomic status and overweight and
obesity among rural-to-urban Yi migrants. Speciﬁcally, for Yi
immigrants who were <20 years of age at arrival
in their
urban community, there was a negative association between a
higher socioeconomic status and a decreased risk of overweight
and obesity. The inverse was observed for Yi migrants who
were older than 20 years of age at arrival
in their urban
community (i.e., a higher socioeconomic status resulted in
an increased risk for overweight and obesity.) The authors,
based on the ﬁndings, recommend that improvements in health
