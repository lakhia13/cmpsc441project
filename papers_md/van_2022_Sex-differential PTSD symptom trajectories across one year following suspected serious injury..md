ABSTRACT
Background:  Recent  years  have  shown  an  increased  application  of  prospective  trajectory- 
oriented  approaches  to  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  Although  women  are  generally 
considered  at  increased  PTSD  risk,  sex  and  gender  differences  in  PTSD  symptom  trajectories 
have not yet been extensively studied.
Objective: To perform an in-depth investigation of differences in PTSD symptom trajectories 
across one-year post-trauma between men and women, by interpreting the general trends of 
trajectories observed in sex-disaggregated samples, and comparing within-trajectory symptom 
course and prevalence rates.
Method:  We  included  N  =  554  participants  (62.5%  men,  37.5%  women)  from  a  multi-centre 
prospective  cohort  of  emergency  department  patients  with  suspected  severe  injury.  PTSD 
symptom  severity  was  assessed  at  1,  3,  6,  and  12  months  post-trauma,  using  the  Clinician- 
Administered  PTSD Scale  for DSM-IV. Latent  growth mixture modelling on  longitudinal PTSD 
symptoms  was  performed  within  the  sex-disaggregated  whole  samples.  Bayesian  modelling 
with informative priors was applied for reliable model estimation, considering the imbalanced 
prevalence of the expected latent trajectories.
Results: In terms of general trends, the same trajectories were observed for men and women, 
i.e.  resilient,  recovery,  chronic  symptoms  and  delayed  onset.  Within-trajectory  symptom 
courses  were  largely  comparable,  but  resilient  women  had  higher  symptoms  than  resilient 
men. Sex differences in prevalence rates were observed for the recovery (higher in women) and 
delayed  onset  (higher  in  men)  trajectories.  Model  fit  for  the  sex-disaggregated  samples  was 
better  than  for  the  whole  sample,  indicating  preferred  application  of  sex-disaggregation. 
Analyses within the whole sample led to biased estimates of overall and sex-specific trajectory 
prevalence rates.
Conclusions:  Sex-disaggregated  trajectory  analyses  revealed  limited  sex  differences  in  PTSD 
symptom  trajectories  within  one-year  post-trauma  in  terms  of  general  trends,  courses  and 
prevalence rates. The observed biased trajectory prevalence rates in the whole sample empha-
size  the  necessity  to  apply  appropriate  statistical  techniques  when  conducting  sex-sensitive 
research.

Trayectorias de síntomas de TEPT diferenciales por sexo a lo largo de un 
año tras la sospecha de lesión grave
Antecedentes: Los últimos años han demostrado una mayor aplicación de enfoques prospec-
tivos  orientados  a  la  trayectoria  para  el  trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  (TEPT).  Aunque 
generalmente se considera que las mujeres tienen un mayor riesgo de TEPT, las diferencias de 
sexo  y  género  en  las  trayectorias  de  los  síntomas  del  TEPT  aún  no  se  han  estudiado 
ampliamente.

Objetivo: Realizar una investigación en profundidad de las diferencias en las trayectorias de los 
síntomas  del  TEPT  a  lo  largo  de  un  año  después  de  un  trauma  entre  hombres  y  mujeres, 
interpretando  las  tendencias  generales  de  las  trayectorias  observadas  en  muestras  desagre-
gadas  por  sexo,  así  como  comparar  el  curso  y  la  evolución  de  los  síntomas  dentro  de  la 
trayectoria y las tasas de prevalencia.
Método:  Incluimos  N  =  554  participantes  (62.5%  hombres,  37.5%  mujeres)  de  una  cohorte 
prospectiva multicéntrica de pacientes del servicio de urgencias con sospecha de lesión grave. 
La  gravedad  de  los  síntomas  del  TEPT  se  evaluó  1,  3,  6  y  12  meses  después  del  trauma, 
utilizando la Escala de TEPT administrada por un médico para el DSM-IV. Se realizó un modelo 
de  mezcla  de  crecimiento  latente  sobre  los  síntomas  longitudinales  de  TEPT  en  las  muestras 
desagregadas  por  sexo  y  en  la  muestra  completa.  Se  aplicó  un  modelo  bayesiano  con  ante-
cedentes informativos para una estimación confiable del modelo, considerando la prevalencia 
desequilibrada de las trayectorias latentes esperadas.
Resultados: En términos de tendencias generales, se observaron las mismas trayectorias para 
hombres y mujeres, es decir, resiliente, recuperación, síntomas crónicos y aparición tardía. Los 
cursos  de  síntomas  dentro  de  la  trayectoria  fueron  en  gran  medida  comparables,  pero  las 
mujeres  resilientes  tenían  más  síntomas  másque  los hombres  resilientes. Se  observaron  dife-
rencias  por  sexo  en  las  tasas  de  prevalencia  para  las  trayectorias  de  recuperación  (mayor  en 
mujeres)  y  de  inicio  tardío  (mayor  en  hombres).  El  ajuste  del  modelo  para  las  muestras 
desagregadas  por  sexo  fue  mejor  que  para  la  muestra  completa,  lo  que  indica  la  aplicación 
preferida  de  la  desagregación  por  sexo.  Los  análisis  de  la  muestra  completa  llevaron 
a  estimaciones  sesgadas  de  las  tasas  de  prevalencia  de  trayectorias  generales  y  específicas 
por sexo.
Conclusiones:  Los  análisis  de  trayectoria  desagregados  por  sexo  revelaron  diferencias  limi-
tadas  entre los sexos en las  trayectorias de los síntomas  del TEPT  durante el año  posterior al 
trauma  en  términos  de  tendencias  generales,  cursos  y  tasas  de  prevalencia.  Las  tasas  de 
prevalencia  de  trayectoria  sesgada  observadas  en  el  conjunto  de  la  muestra  enfatizan  la 
necesidad  de  aplicar  técnicas  estadísticas  apropiadas  al  realizar  investigaciones  que  tengan 
en cuenta el sexo.

1. Introduction

Sex and gender differences in prevalence rates of trau-
matic  event  exposure  and  posttraumatic  stress  disor-
der  (PTSD)  appear  evident:  Men  experience  trauma 
disproportionately more often, but PTSD is more pre-
valent  in  women  (Gavranidou  &  Rosner,  2003;  Olff, 
2017;  Shalev  et  al.,  2019).  These  differences  can  be 
ascribed  to  both  sex  (i.e.  biology)  and  gender  (i.e. 
social identity) related factors (Kornfield, Hantsoo, & 
Epperson,  2018).  The  higher  PTSD  prevalence  in 
women  can  be  partly,  but  not  fully,  explained  by  the 
fact that they are more often exposed to interpersonal 
trauma  and  especially  sexual  assault,  which  particu-
larly increases conditional PTSD risk (Olff, 2017; Tolin 
&  Foa,  2006).  Most  studies  that  indicate  female 

vulnerability  for  PTSD  focus  on  endpoint  PTSD. 
This means they differentiate individuals fulfiling the 
diagnostic criteria for PTSD at a specified time point 
from those who do not. This approach does not con-
sider how PTSD symptoms develop over time, which 
may be different between women and men. Therefore, 
the exact temporal dynamics underlying PTSD devel-
opment in men and women are still unclear.

Applying trajectory-oriented approaches may help 
to  increase  our  knowledge  on  this  matter,  as  they 
implement  prognostic  and  longitudinal  perspectives 
and capture PTSD symptom severity in a continuous 
manner.  These  approaches  classify  groups  of  indivi-
duals  based  on  the  severity  of  their  symptoms  and 
thus  moving  beyond 
time, 
their  changes  over 

traditional  binary  diagnostic  categories  that  merely 
distinguish 
individuals  with  and  without  PTSD. 
Therefore,  they  are  more  suitable  for  investigating 
increases  and  declines  of  symptoms  over  time 
(Galatzer-Levy,  Huang,  &  Bonanno,  2018).  Previous 
studies identified various numbers and types of PTSD 
symptom trajectories. They differ regarding the num-
ber of trajectories identified, ranging from 2 (Armour, 
Shevlin, Elklit, & Mroczek, 2012; Ginzburg & Ein-Dor, 
2011)  up  to  6  (Berntsen  et  al.,  2012;  Pietrzak  et  al., 
2014),  which  is  presumably  due  to  heterogeneity  in 
study designs, sample, trauma and outcome character-
istics, as well as the chosen statistical approaches. Yet, 
in a comprehensive meta-analytical summary of PTSD 
symptom  trajectories  within  38  samples,  Galatzer- 
Levy et al. (2018) found four trajectories that occurred 
particularly  consistently.  The  resilience  trajectory,  in 
which individuals might suffer from some acute stress 
symptoms  immediately  after  trauma  but  do  not 
develop  any  clinically  relevant  PTSD  symptoms,  was 
observed  in  92%  of  the  samples.  This  trajectory  was 
considered the modal response following trauma, as it 
occurred  with  a  pooled  prevalence  rate  of  70%.  The 
recovery trajectory  describes individuals  who  develop 
clinical  or  subclinical  PTSD  symptoms  initially  after 
trauma,  from  which  they  gradually  recover.  It  was 
observed  in  74%  of  the  samples  and  had  a  pooled 
prevalence rate of 27%. The third trajectory included 
individuals  with  chronic  (sub)clinical  PTSD  symp-
toms.  It  was  observed  in  61%  of  the  samples,  with 
a pooled prevalence rate of 10%. The fourth trajectory, 
clustering 
individuals  whose  (sub)clinical  PTSD 
symptoms  emerge  with  delayed  onset,  was  observed 
in  32%  of  the  included  samples  and  occurred  with 
a pooled prevalence rate of 6%. Additional trajectories 
have  been  identified,  mostly  further  differentiating 
within  the  consistently  observed  trajectories.  For 
instance, Berntsen et al. (2012) distinguished resilient 
individuals 
from  extremely  resilient  ones  and 
Galatzer-Levy  et  al.  (2013)  differentiated  between 
individuals.

Despite the apparent differences in prevalence rates 
of endpoint PTSD between women and men (Tolin & 
Foa,  2006),  the  majority  of  published  trajectory- 
oriented  studies  have  neglected  sex  and  gender,  so 
far.  This  can  partly  be  explained  by  the  samples’ 
imbalanced  ratios  of  included  men  and  women. 
Samples  with  military  deployment-related  trauma 
were  often  exclusively  or  predominantly  male, 
whereas sexually abused samples were predominantly 
female.  Previous  studies  with  more  balanced  ratios

low  symptoms  and 

mainly investigated sex or gender as predictor of tra-
jectory membership, after specifying these trajectories 
within the whole sample. These studies yielded hetero-
geneous  results.  Some  found  that  women  dispropor-
tionately  more  often  belonged  to  those  trajectories 
defined  by  higher  symptom  severity.  For  instance, 
Bryant  et  al.  (2015)  found  that  female  emergency 
department  patients  had  a  higher  probability  of 
belonging  to  the  recovery,  chronic  or  worsening  tra-
jectory,  as  compared  to  the  resilient  one,  than  men. 
A  similar  pattern  was  found  in  a  sample  exposed  to 
a  natural  disaster: Participants within  the recovering, 
severely  chronic  and  moderately  chronic  trajectories 
were  more  likely  female  (Johannesson  et  al.,  2015). 
Additionally,  female  deployed  soldiers  were  more 
likely  to  be  assigned  to  a  trajectory  with  high  symp-
toms  and  a  significant  increase  over  time,  than  one 
little  increase  (Orcutt, 
with 
Erickson,  &  Wolfe,  2004).  Women’s  higher  risk  of 
belonging  to  a  non-resilient  trajectory  was  further 
confirmed  in  another  mixed-sex  military  sample 
(Berntsen et al., 2012), as well as in sample of respon-
ders to the 2001 World Trade Center attacks (Pietrzak 
et  al.,  2014).  A  recent  consortium  study  (Lowe  et  al., 
2021),  pooling  data  of  N  =  3,083  emergency  depart-
ment  patients  from  six  large  longitudinal  studies, 
including  the  cohort  used  in  the  present  study,  also 
detected  differences:  Women  had  a  lower probability 
of  having  low  initial  PTSD  symptoms  and  being 
assigned  to  the  low  (resilient)  symptom  trajectory 
than  men.  However,  despite  these  findings  that  indi-
cate  a  greater  female  risk  for  long-term  PTSD symp-
toms, other studies that investigated sex differences in 
the  trajectories’  prevalence  rates  failed  to  confirm 
a  greater  risk  for  women  (Galatzer-Levy  et  al.,  2013; 
Galatzer-Levy,  Madan,  Neylan,  Henn-Haase,  & 
Marmar,  2011;  Ginzburg  &  Ein-Dor,  2011;  Hobfoll, 
Mancini, Hall, Canetti, & Bonanno, 2011; Le Brocque, 
Hendrikz,  &  Kenardy,  2010;  Pielmaier,  Milek, 
Nussbeck,  Walder,  &  Maercker,  2013).  Further,  in 
their  study  on  elderly  survivors  of  a  natural  disaster, 
which  emerged  with  a  three-trajectory  solution, 
Pietrzak,  Van  Ness,  Fried,  Galea,  and  Norris  (2013) 
reported  that  women  had  a  higher  probability  of 
belonging to the resilient or chronic dysfunction tra-
jectory,  respectively,  than  belonging  to  the  delayed 
onset trajectory.

Thus, the question whether the prevalence rates of 
specific trajectories differ between men and women is 
not  fully  resolved,  yet.  Besides  that,  the  question 
whether  the  same  trajectories  can  be  detected  when 
analysing  women  and  men  separately,  thus  disaggre-
gating  data  on  PTSD  symptom  courses  for  men  and 
women who were originally included within the same 
cohort

severity  and  change  over  time  within  specific  trajec-
tories remain understudied to date. Raising attention 
towards  the  impact  of  sex  and  gender  within  trajec-
tory-oriented  approaches  can  provide  insights  into 
how  the  commonly  assumed  differences  in  endpoint 
PTSD  between  men  and  women  emerge.  Second,  it 
allows for the future identification of potential sex- or 
gender-specific  predictors  of  trajectory-membership. 
Together, this knowledge can be used to inform on the 
necessity of sex- or gender-specific screening and pre-
ventive  interventions  that  promote  resilience  after 
trauma.

In this study, we applied latent growth mixture mod-
elling  on  disaggregated  data  of  men  and  women  from 
a  cohort  study  of  patients  who  were  admitted  to  an 
emergency  department  with  suspected  serious  injury 
and  followed  up  until  one  year  afterwards.  We  thereby 
aimed  to  investigate  the  commonly  observed  PTSD 
symptom  trajectories  resilience,  recovery,  chronic  and 
delayed  onset  within  women  and  men  separately.  To 
this end, we employed Bayesian modelling with informa-
tive  priors.  This  approach  can  provide  reliable  estima-
tions of models with some relatively small or imbalanced 
latent  clusters, which  other statistical approaches might 
overlook or merge into larger, more stable clusters (van 
de  Schoot  et  al.,  2018).  Informative  priors  inform  on 
a  reasonable  range  of  values  for  the  model  parameters 
to be estimated (the expected number and prevalence of 
latent  trajectories,  and  the  expected  symptom  severity 
and  change  over  time  for  a  given  trajectory)  derived 
from the existing literature. It has been established that 
including priors with even a minor degree of information 
provides more accurate estimates than regular LGMM or 
Bayesian  LGMM  with  non-informative  priors  (Smid, 
McNeish,  Miočević,  &  van  de  Schoot,  2020). 
Considering the previously identified imbalanced alloca-
tions  to  the  resilience,  recovery,  chronic  and  delayed 
onset  trajectories,  of  which  particularly  the  latter  two 
were  found  to  be  relatively  small  (Galatzer-Levy  et  al., 
2018), we considered Bayesian modelling appears to be 
most appropriate for our analyses.

We addressed the following research questions:

(1)  Do  the  four  expected  PTSD  symptom  trajec-
tories, namely, resilience, recovery, chronic and 
delayed onset, emerge in both men and women, 
if analysed separately?

(2) Do PTSD symptom courses within the respec-
trajectories  differ  between  women 

tive 
and men?

(3) Do prevalence rates of the respective trajectories 

differ between men and women?

(4) Are the findings from the disaggregated models 
comparable  with  those  from  the  whole  sample? 
Importantly,  here, 
the  distinction  between 
women and men was based on participants’ (bio-
logical) sex.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants  and study design

trauma-related  psychopathology 

Data  were  derived  from  the  Trauma  TIPS  study, 
a  prospective  cohort  study  on  incidence  and  predic-
tion  of 
(‘The 
Incidence,  Prediction  and  Prevention  of  Post-trauma 
Psychopathology  Study’).  Adult  participants  were 
included  after  being  transported  by  ambulance  or 
helicopter  with  suspected  severe  injuries  requiring 
specialized  acute  medical  care  to  one  of  two  level-1 
Trauma  Center  sites  (Academic  Medical  Center  and 
Vrije Universiteit Medical Center) in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands.  Inclusion  criteria  were  recent  exposure 
to a potential traumatic event (DSM-IV PTSD criter-
ion  A1)  and  Dutch  language  proficiency.  Exclusion 
criteria  were:  current  severe  psychiatric  symptoms 
(psychosis or schizophrenia; severe personality disor-
ders; injuries resulting from deliberate self-harm); cur-
rent  severe  neurological  disorder;  moderate-severe 
traumatic  brain  injury  (Glasgow  Coma  Scale  score 
<13 (Teasdale & Jennett, 1974)); permanent residency 
outside  the  Netherlands.  The  study  was  approved  by 
institutional  review  boards  of  both  centres.  N  =  852 
participants  were  included  between  September  2005 
and  March  2009.  The  larger  study  incorporated  an 
embedded 
(RCT, 
ISRCTN registration number: 57754429) in 300 parti-
cipants investigating the efficacy of a brief self-guided 
cognitive-behavioural internet intervention to prevent 
PTSD  (Mouthaan  et  al.,  2013;  Mouthaan,  Sijbrandij, 
Reitsma,  Gersons,  &  Olff,  2011,  2014).  Follow-up 
assessments  occurred  at  1  (T1),  3  (T2,  added  at  the 
start  of  the  RCT  in  September  2007),  6  (T3)  and 
12 months (T4) post-trauma.

trial 

At each assessment, PTSD symptom severity within 
the  past  month  was  determined  using  the  validated 
Dutch translation of the Clinician-administered PTSD 
scale  for  DSM-IV  (CAPS).  This  interview  is  the  gold 
standard for PTSD assessment and has excellent inter-
nal  consistency  (Hovens  et  al.,  1994;  Weathers  et  al., 
2004).  For  each  DSM-IV  diagnostic  symptom,  the 
CAPS  measures  symptom  frequency  and  intensity 
(both  ranges 0–4).  Total  symptom  severity  (range  0– 
136, higher score indicating higher symptom severity) 
was  calculated  by  summing  frequency  and  intensity 
scores 
the  re- 
experiencing (5 items), avoidance (7 items) and hyper-
arousal  (5  items)  clusters.  Across  follow-ups,  CAPS 
scores did not differ between intervention and control 
conditions, see Mouthaan et al. (2013). For the current 
study,  we  selected  all  participants  with  at  least  two 
CAPS  interviews  across  follow-up  assessments  to 
allow  for  reliable  estimation  of  trajectories.  This 
resulted  in  N  =  554  participants  (N  =  346  (62.5%)

Mean  traumatic  injury  severity  upon  arrival  at  the

women  than  men,  while  consciousness  levels  upon 
arrival  at  the  trauma  centre  did  not  differ  between 
men  and  women.  There  were  no  differences  in  the 
prevalence  of  endpoint  PTSD  at  12  months  post- 
trauma between selected men and women, using a cut- 
off  of  CAPS  total  score  ≥45  (Weathers,  Ruscio,  & 
Keane,  1999)  (see  Table  1  for  demographic  and 
trauma characteristics).

2.2. Procedures

Potential  participants  were  identified  from  hospital 
patient  records.  Patients  meeting  exclusion  criteria 
based  on  the  patient  records  or  information  from 
treating medical staff were not contacted. Further elig-
ibility screening and recruitment were preferably per-
formed within 72 hours post-trauma. At the baseline 
assessment,  preferably  scheduled  approximately  one 
week post-trauma, participants who gave written and

(Sheehan  et  al.,  1998;  van  Vliet  &  de  Beurs,  2007)) 
and  completed  self-report  questionnaires  including 
demographic  and  trauma  characteristics  (Mouthaan 
et  al.,  2011).  If  severe  psychiatric  symptoms  meeting 
the  exclusion  criteria  were  disclosed  during  these 
assessments,  participation  was  discontinued.  If  RCT- 
participants were randomized to the intervention con-
dition, the intervention was accessible after a baseline 
assessment (T0). All participants were invited for fol-
low-up assessments, irrespective of RCT participation, 
and had access to care as usual.

Follow-up  assessments  T1-T4  frequently  occurred 
later  than  preferred,  mostly  resulting  from  practical 
issues  related  to  participants’  medical  situation.  We 
handled this unintended variation in assessment timing 
by  assigning  collected  CAPS  interview  data  to  the 
respective  nearest  assessment,  which  could  be  the  ori-
ginally scheduled or the adjacent assessment (i.e. T1: ≤ 
60 days post-trauma; T2: 61–136 days post-trauma; T3: 
137–273 days post trauma; T4 ≥ 274 days post-trauma). 
Ultimate sample size and timing relative to the injury for 
each assessment in the selected N = 554 participants with 
≥2 valid CAPS interviews were: T1: n = 398, 42.15(8.75) 
days, range: 13–60 days; T2: n = 290, 97.15(17.22) days, 
range:  61–136  days;  T3:  n  =  411,  207.18(27.40)  days,

2.3. Statistical analyses

2.3.1. Bayesian latent growth mixture modelling 
(LGMM)
We  performed  Bayesian  LGMM  with  informative 
priors  following  a  similar  procedure  as  described  in 
van  de  Schoot  et  al.  (2018).  In  the  current  paper, 
however,  we  focus  on  sex-disaggregated  models.  We 
used  square  root  transformed  CAPS  total  scores,  as 
CAPS total scores did not follow a normal distribution 
at  all  timepoints.  The  Bayesian  results  were  obtained 
using  Mplus  version  8.4  (Muthen  &  Muthen,  2017). 
We  present  the  median  of  the  posterior  distribution 
and  its 95% higher posterior density (HPD) intervals 
for the parameters in the model.

The  primary  models  included  four  latent  trajec-
tories  with  growth  parameters  for  the  intercept  and 
linear  slope.  For  interpretation  purposes,  we  desig-
nated  the  intercept  to  be  the  first  CAPS  assessment 
(T1).  The  linear  slope  was  specified  as  the  average 
time  in  months  between  T1  and  T2-T4,  respec-
tively.  For  comparison  purposes  between  the  sex- 
disaggregated  and  whole  sample  models,  we  used 
the  same  specifications  and  parameters  for  the 
three  models,  only  changing  them  to  accommodate 
the  differences  in  sample  sizes.

2.4. Parameter estimation priors

We  used  normally  distributed  priors  for  the  growth 
parameters.  The  specification  of  the  priors  for  the 
mean  intercepts  and  linear  slopes,  as  well  as  their 
description  in  terms  of  general  trends  was  informed 
by a previously published systematic review and expert 
elicitation  on  latent  PTSD  trajectories  (van  de  Schoot 
et  al.,  2018),  see  Table  2  and  Figure  1.  We  used  the 
calculated  median  intercept  values  for  the  four  trajec-
tories in the acute post-trauma period to derive priors 
for  the  mean  intercept  values,  converting  the  standar-
dized values into square root transformed CAPS scores, 
and thereafter adding or subtracting the estimated lin-
ear  slope  over  a  period  of  1.5  months  to  this  median. 
Additionally, we used these extracted median scores to 
calculate the expected end scores for each trajectory and 
thereafter  calculated  the  mean  slope  priors  for  all  tra-
jectories.  We  used  the  median  instead  of  the  mean 
intercept values for our calculations, as PTSD symptom 
severity scores for European cohorts versus US cohorts 
are generally relatively low (Shalev et al., 2019).

in  burn  victims.  We  adapted 

For the specification of the prior variances around 
the intercept and slope for each trajectory, we adapted 
the approach previously applied by van de Schoot et al. 
(2018)  for  a  Bayesian  LGMM  of  PTSD  symptom 
severity 
their 
R-function  to  determine  the  optimal  prior  variance 
parameterization  for  the  square  root  transformed 
CAPS scores  given our expectations using  R-package 
ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) with the following specifica-
tions: for the resilient trajectory, we specified that the 
overlarge majority of mean intercepts (95%) would be 
below the commonly used cut-off of CAPS total score

of  45  (Weathers  et  al.,  1999)  i.e.  6.71  for  the  square 
root  transformed  values,  resulting  in  intercept  var-
iance  of  2.045.  Vice  versa,  for  the  chronic  trajectory, 
we  specified  the  overlarge  majority  (95%)  of  mean 
intercept would be above this clinical cut-off, resulting 
in intercept variance of 0.608. For the recovering tra-
jectory,  we  expected  the  mean  intercept  to  be  lower 
than the mean intercept for the chronic trajectory, but 
allowed 95% of the mean intercepts to overlap with the 
intercepts for the chronic trajectory, resulting in inter-
cept  variance  of  0.281.  For  the  delayed  onset  trajec-
tory,  we  expected  the  mean  intercept  at  T1  to  be 
higher than the mean intercept for the resilient trajec-
tory, but allowed 95% of the mean intercepts to over-
lap  with  the  intercepts  for  the  resilient  trajectory, 
resulting in intercept variance of 0.221.

Regarding the slope variance parameterization, we 
allowed 0.001% of the distribution of the slope of the 
recovering and delayed onset trajectories to be higher 
or lower than zero, respectively, as this would change 
the clinical interpretation of the trajectory completely. 
This  resulted  in  a  slope  variance  of  0.005  for  both 
trajectories.  For  the  chronic  trajectory,  we  specified 
that  0.001%  of  the  slopes  could  be  lower  than  the 
slopes  for  the  recovering  trajectory  (slope  variance: 
0.005),  thus  the  symptom  severity  for  the  chronic 
trajectory was not allowed to decrease more than the 
severity  in  the  recovering  trajectory.  For  the  resilient 
trajectory, we specified that 0.001% of the slopes could 
be higher than the slopes for the delayed onset trajec-
tory (slope variance: 0.05), meaning that the symptom

severity for the resilient trajectory was not allowed to 
increase  more  than  the  severity  in  the  delayed  onset 
trajectory.

Dirichlet  priors  designating  the  expected  size  of 
each  latent  trajectory  were  based  on  meta-analytic 
findings  of  the  mean  relative  trajectory  prevalence 
amongst prospective and longitudinal studies of latent 
trajectories of trauma-related psychopathology follow-
ing  traumatic  events  (Galatzer-Levy  et  al.,  2018).  As 
not  all  included  studies  identified  exactly  these  four 
trajectories,  their  respective  relative  prevalence  rates 
did  not  add  up  to  100%.  Therefore,  the  estimated 
Dirichlet  priors  were  adapted,  using  meta-regression 
findings  on  the  same  set  of  studies.  The  estimated 
relative  prevalence  rates  of  the  trajectories  were  sub-
sequently recalculated into expected absolute size per 
trajectory  and  incorporated  into  the  Dirichlet  priors 
with  the  delayed  onset  category  as  the  reference  for 
men  and  women  separately  (see  Table  2).  Default 
prior  specifications  of  Mplus  Version  8.4  were  used 
for the variance-covariance parameters and residuals.

2.5. Posterior model results and sensitivity 
analyses

Upon  specification  of  the  statistical  model  and  the 
priors,  the  model  was  estimated  using  one  Markov 
Chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  chain  to  prevent  label 
switching,  with  a  fixed  number  of  fbiterations  of  at 
least 500,000. To assess the model performance for the 
purpose  of  research  question  1,  posterior  predictive

used the square root transformed CAPS scores in a similar manner.

tive  p-values  (PPPP)  (Asparouhov,  2017;  Hoijtink  & 
van  de  Schoot,  2018),  and  entropy  was  appraised. 
Convergence was assumed if the potential scale reduc-
tion value (PSR, (Gelman, 1992) was below 1.05 for all 
batches  of  iterations  post  burn-in.  We  additionally 
performed  a  set  of  sensitivity  analyses  to  assess  the 
impact of the priors and stability of the models, apply-
ing the same seed value across models.

For a first set of  sensitivity analyses, we compared 
the stability of the results regarding convergence and 
general trends to assess whether the same trajectories 
were obtained in terms of general trend of the trajec-
tories  between  the  primary  models  and  informative 
models  with  different  variances  around  the  mean 
intercept priors (calculated variance: *0; *0.5; *2; *10) 
and  mean slope priors (calculated variances: *0; *0.5; 
*2; *10; *100; *250). Second, we ran informative mod-
els  with  the  same  parameter  specification  but  with 
a different number of trajectories estimated and com-
pared  model  fit  and  general  trends  of  the  primary 
models  to:  a  3-class  model  without  the  informative 
priors  specifying  the  delayed  onset  class;  a  4-class 
model  with  non-informative  (default)  priors  instead 
of  informative priors for the delayed  onset class; and 
a  5-class  model  using  non-informative  priors  for  the 
5th  class.  Third,  we  compared  the  solution  of  the 
primary  models  with:  a  4-class  model  with  non- 
informative  priors  instead  of  informative  priors;  the 
primary 4-class model with an added quadratic slope 
with  non-informative  priors.  Finally,  we  reran  the 
primary  model,  additionally  including  the  effects  of 
RCT  participation  on  the  intercept  and  slope  to  pre-
clude that the intervention provided in the embedded 
RCT influenced the results.

In depth exploration and sex differences in

primary models

For  research  question  2,  sex  differences  in  the 
results  from  the  primary  model  were  explored 

using  the  95%  HPD  intervals  of  the  estimated 
mean  intercepts  and  slopes  for  all  trajectories.  To 
further  explore  the  primary  models  and  their 
potential  sex  differences,  we  saved  the  participants’ 
estimated  probabilities  for  each  trajectory,  exported 
these  into  SPSS  (Version  26,  IBM)  and  assigned 
each  participant  to  one  of  the  four  trajectories 
based  on  whichever  had  the  highest  probability 
for  the  specific  participant.  This  is  the  most  fre-
quently  used  method  applied  in  the  field  of  PTSD 
(van  de  Schoot,  Sijbrandij,  Winter,  Depaoli,  & 
Vermunt,  2017).  We  further  explored  the  obtained 
results  by  plotting 
individual 
observed  CAPS  scores  over  time  for  each  trajectory 
(the  latter  for  a  random  subset  of  n  =  40  men  and 
n  =  40  women  assigned  to  the  resilient  trajectory 
and  for  all  participants  assigned  to  the  smaller 
trajectories).

For  research  question  3,  we  additionally  investi-
gated  sex  differences  in  the  prevalence  of  trajectory 
assignments  using  Bayesian  Chi  square  tests  (Bayes 
Factor:  01,  JASP  software  version  0.14.1,  2020).

For research question 4, we ran the primary model 
on the whole sample, saved and extracted the partici-
pants  estimated  posterior  probabilities  into  SPSS, 
assigned  the  participant  to  trajectories  based  on  the 
highest probability, and compared the obtained results 
between  the  whole-sample  and  sex-disaggregated 
models.  Then  we  performed  Bayesian  chi-square 
tests  to  assess  potential  sex  differences  in  trajectory 
assignment.

3. Results

3.1. Bayesian  LGMM

Addressing  research  question  1,  we  first  ran  the  pri-
mary models in the sex-disaggregated samples. These 
successfully  converged  in  both  disaggregated  sex- 
samples.  Estimated  CAPS  scores  at  all  assessments 
are  provided  in  Figures  2A  and  2B  for  men  and 
women, respectively.

Figure 2. Model-estimated CAPS total scores for the trajectories in the primary Bayesian linear growth mixture models. Figure A, B, 
and C depict the estimated mean square root CAPS total scores obtained from the primary models for the men, women and whole 
sample respectively.  
The dashed line represents the square root transformed clinical cut-off for probable PTSD at CAPS total score = 45.

For  the  male  model,  the  PPP  (.374)  and  PPPP 
(.431)  were  very  close  to  .50,  with  an  entropy  of 
.678.  For  the  expected  resilient  trajectory  (esti-
mated  posterior  probability: 
.681),  estimated 
CAPS  scores  were  low  at  baseline  and  significantly 
further  decreased  over  time  (intercept:  2.926  (95% 
HPD:  2.648,  3.207),  slope:  −0.037  (95%HPD: 
−0.069,  −0.007)).  For  the  expected  chronic  trajec-
tory  (estimated  posterior  probability:  .081),  esti-
mated  CAPS  scores  were  continuously  high 
(intercept:  6.975  (95%HPD:  6.073,  7.867),  slope: 
−.003  (95%HPD:  −0.085,  −0.085,  0.081)).  The 
expected  recovering  (estimated  posterior  probabil-
ity:  .182)  and  delayed  onset  trajectories  (estimated 
posterior  probability:  .056)  had  comparable  esti-
mated  CAPS  scores  at  baseline  (i.e.  their  95%HPD 
intervals  overlapped:  recovering  intercept:  5.349 
(95%HPD:  4.595,  6.158),  delayed  onset  intercept: 
4.980  (95%HPD:  4.209,  5.756)),  but  the  recovering 
trajectory  showed  a  significant  decrease  over  time 
(slope:  −0.178  (95%HPD:  −0.271,  −0.08),  while  the 
trajectory  showed  a  significant 
delayed  onset 
increase  over 
(95%HPD:  0.075, 
time 
0.244)).

(0.162 

For  the  female  model,  the  PPP  (.463)  and  PPPP 
(.503)  were  again  close  to  .50,  with  an  entropy  of 
.710.  The  obtained  solution  in  terms  of  the  observed 
trends in the chronic (estimated posterior probability: 
.076,  intercept:  7.859  (95%HPD:  6.801,  8.901),  slope: 
−0.023 (95%HPD: −0.106, 0.062)) and recovering tra-
jectories  (estimated  posterior  probability:  .205,  inter-
cept:  6.072  (95%HPD:  5.377,  6.766),  slope:  −0.285 
(95%HPD  −0.362,  −0.197))  were  similar  to  those 
observed  in men. CAPS  scores in  the resilient trajec-
tory were continuously low (estimated posterior prob-
ability: .675, intercept: 3.800 (95%HPD: 3.400, 4.217), 
slope: −0.300 (95%HPD: −0.068, 0.043)), without sig-
nificant change over time. However, for the expected 
delayed onset trajectory, the 95%HPD interval for the 
slope did just include zero, indicating a very low prob-
ability for an increase in CAPS scores over time (esti-
mated  posterior  probability:  .044,  intercept:  4.873 
(95%HPD:  3.902,  5.837),  slope:  0.117  (95%HPD: 
−0.001, 5.837).

3.2. Sensitivity analyses

For both men and women, the primary 4-class models 
were  deemed  stable,  leading  to  the  same  results  in 
terms  of  general  trends  when  the  variance  around 
the  mean  intercept  was  increased  up  to  twofold  and 
when  the  variance  around  the  linear  slope  was 
increased  up  to  twofold  and  10-fold  for  the  female 
and  male  models,  respectively  (see  supplementary 
table  2).  For  both  sex-disaggregated  models,  the  fit 
for the primary 4-class model was comparable to the 
3-class  model  without  the  delayed  onset  class  (see 

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

supplementary).  Yet,  as  the  delayed  onset  trajectory 
contains  a  clinically  relevant  group  which  would 
otherwise not be distinguished, we opted to maintain 
this solution instead of the more parsimonious 3-class 
model. For both primary models, model fit was super-
ior compared to a 4-class model with non-informative 
priors  and  a  4-class  model  with  an  unspecified  class 
instead of the delayed onset class. Within the men, the 
fit was comparable to a 5-class model with an unspe-
cified  additional  class,  but  as  this  merely  resulted  in 
another  resilient  trajectory  and  thus  had  no  added 
clinical value, the more parsimonious primary 4-class 
model  was  maintained.  Within  women,  the  fit  of  the 
primary  model  was  better  than  that  of  the  5-class 
model  with  an  unspecified  additional  class.  The 
model  with  an  added  quadratic  slope  with  non- 
informative priors decreased the  model fit in  women 
but increased the model fit in men. In men, this model 
resulted in two classes with decreasing symptoms over 
time, at the loss of the delayed onset class. Additional 
sensitivity  analyses  showed  no  significant  impact  of 
RCT  participation  on  the  estimated  trajectories  (see 
supplementary results).

3.3. Sex differences in trajectory growth 
parameters

With regard to research question 2, the 95%HPDs for 
the  obtained  growth  parameters  in  the  primary  sex- 
disaggregated  models  indicated  a  difference  in  the 
intercept  of  the  resilient  trajectories  between  men 
and  women,  with  a  higher  intercept  (i.e.  higher 
CAPS score at baseline) in women compared to men. 
All  other  95%HPDs  overlapped,  suggesting  no  addi-
tional  significant  differences.  Thus,  the  course  of 
CAPS  scores  over  time  within  the  smaller  sex- 
disaggregated trajectories was highly similar.

Observed mean CAPS scores at all assessments for 
each  trajectory  are  provided  in  Figures  3A  and  3B 
and  individual  CAPS  scores  at  all  assessments  for 
in  supplementary 
each  trajectory  are  provided 
Figures  1  and  2  for  men  and  women,  respectively. 
General trends within these observed CAPS scores fit 
with  the  observed  general  trends  within  the  growth 
parameters  and the  estimated means  in the  primary 
model.

3.4. Sex differences in trajectory prevalence

Addressing  research  question  3,  that  is,  the  relative 
prevalence  of  all  trajectories,  women  were  more 
often assigned to the recovering trajectory while men 
were more often assigned to the delayed onset trajec-
tory  (BF01(554):  6.139  in  favour  of  the  alternative 
hypothesis  of  unequal  trajectory  counts  across  sexes, 
see Table 3A).

3.5. Comparison with whole sample model

In  order  to  answer  research  question  4,  we  repeated 
the  primary  informative  4-class  model  in  the  whole 
sample,  combining  men  and  women.  The  fit  for  this 
model  in terms  of  PPP (.253)  was  lower  than for  the 
sex-disaggregated  samples,  while  the  PPPP  (.500)  fit 
was comparable to that of the female model and some-
what  better  than  that  of  the  male  model.  Entropy 
(.652) was lower for the whole sample than for the sex- 
disaggregated samples.

The general trends of the observed trajectories were 
highly  comparable  to  those  observed  in  the  sex- 
disaggregated  samples  (see  Figure  2C).  For  the 
expected  chronic  trajectory,  estimated  CAPS  scores 
were  continuously  high  (intercept:  6.975  (95%HPD: 
6.073, 7.867), slope: −.003 (95%HPD: −0.085, −0.085, 
0.081)).  The  expected  recovering  and  delayed  onset 
trajectories  had  comparable  estimated  CAPS  scores 
at baseline (i.e. their 95% HPD s overlapped: recover-
ing  intercept:  5.349  (95%HPD:  4.595,  6.158),  delayed 
onset  intercept:  4.980  (95%HPD:  4.209,  5.756)).  As 
expected,  in  terms  of  slope,  the  recovering  trajectory 
showed a significant decrease over time (−0.178 (95% 
HPD: −0.271, −0.08)), while the delayed onset trajec-
tory  showed  a  significant  increase  over  time  (0.162 
(95%HPD:  0.075,  0.244)).  The  95%HPD  intervals  for 
the  growth  parameters  of  the  whole  and  sex- 
disaggregated samples all overlapped.

There  were noticeable differences in the estimated 
posterior  probabilities of  belonging to  the recovering 
and  chronic  trajectories  between  the  whole  and  sex- 
disaggregated  samples.  The  probability  for  the  reco-
vering trajectory in the whole sample (.099) was about 
half  that  of  the  probability  in  the  sex-disaggregated 
samples  (men:  .182,  women:  .205)  while  it  was  more 
than  twice  as  high  for  the  chronic  trajectory  (whole: 
.176,  men:  .081,  women:  .076).  The  probabilities  for 
the resilient (whole: .671, men: .678, women: .690) and 
delayed  onset  (whole.  054,  men:  .056,  women:  .044) 

trajectories  were  comparable  between  samples.  We 
observed the same pattern when assigning participants 
to specific trajectories based on their highest estimated 
posterior probabilities, with the relative prevalence of 
the  recovering  trajectory  lower  in  the  whole  sample 
(5.8%)  compared  to  the  sex-disaggregated  samples 
(men:  10.4%;  women:  14.9%)  and  the  relative  preva-
lence  of  the  chronic  trajectory  about  twice  as  high 
(whole: 14.1%; male: 8.4%; female: 8.2%). The preva-
lence  for  the  resilient  trajectories  was  highly  similar 
(whole: 77.8%; men: 77.7%; women: 76.9%), while that 
of  the  delayed  onset  trajectory  (2.3%)  was  about  the 
average of that in the sex-disaggregated samples (men: 
3.5%, women: 0%).

Just  as  for  the  sex-disaggregated  models,  women 
were  more  often  assigned  to  the  recovering  trajec-
tory  while  men  were  more  often  assigned  to  the 
delayed  onset  trajectory.  In  contrast  to  the  results 
from  the  sex-disaggregated  samples,  women  were 
more  often  assigned  to  the chronic  trajectory,  while 
men  were  more  often  assigned  to  the  resilient  tra-
jectory  (BF01(554):  1.956;  see  Table  3B).

4. Discussion

We  investigated  sex  differences  in  general  trends, 
course and prevalence of PTSD symptom trajectories 
within one year following trauma. For this purpose, we 
employed  Bayesian  latent  growth  mixture  modelling 
with informative priors on sex-disaggregated samples 
of emergency department patients admitted with sus-
pected  serious  injury.  Notably,  we  used  the  same 
priors  for  the  analyses  within  the  male  and  female 
samples. This was a  forced choice, as previous litera-
ture  did  not  provide  any  sex-disaggregated  data  to 
derive  sex-specific  priors  from.  Consequently,  our 
informative priors did not pre-assume any sex differ-
ences  and  as  such  did  not  influence  our  findings. 
Within  the  sex-disaggregated  samples,  the  four  most

commonly observed trajectories, i.e. resilience, recov-
ery, chronic symptoms and delayed onset, emerged in 
both  women  and  men.  Within  these  trajectories, 
PTSD  symptom  courses,  including  initial  symptom 
severity and changes in severity over time, were largely 
comparable between sexes. The only differences were 
that  resilient  women  showed  higher  symptoms  than 
resilient men. Prevalence differences emerged for two 
out  of  the  four  trajectories:  Women  were  dispropor-
tionately  more  often  assigned  to  the  recovery  trajec-
tory  than  men.  The  delayed  trajectory  was  more 
prevalent  in  men,  with  no  women  assigned  into  this 
trajectory, based on their highest  estimated probabil-
ity.  Thus,  our  sex-disaggregated  results  showed  lim-
ited  differences  in  PTSD  trajectory  general  trends, 
courses  and  prevalence  rates  between  men  and 
women.  Women  were  not  overrepresented  within 
the  trajectories  with  high  PTSD  symptom  severity  at 
the final assessment, i.e. the chronic and delayed tra-
jectories.  In  line  with  this,  we  also  did  not  observe 
a significant sex difference endpoint PTSD prevalence 
rates in our sample.

These  findings  apparently  contrast  previous  evi-
dence  that  suggested  a  greater  PTSD  risk  in  women. 
This evidence comes mostly from studies that applied 
the endpoint PTSD approach (Gavranidou & Rosner, 
2003; Shalev et al., 2019; Tolin & Foa, 2006), but also 
from  several  studies  that  used  trajectory-oriented 
approaches (Berntsen et al., 2012; Bryant et al., 2015; 
Johannesson  et  al.,  2015;  Lowe  et  al.,  2021;  Orcutt 
et  al.,  2004;  Pietrzak  et  al.,  2014).  Our  finding  might 
be  at  least  partially  ascribed  to  sex  differences  in 
trauma  type,  which  is  another  known  moderator  of 
endpoint PTSD (Tolin & Foa, 2006). Although all our 
participants were transported to the hospital for hos-
pital evaluation because of suspected serious injuries, 
women’s  injuries  more  often  resulted  from  motor 
vehicle  accidents,  whereas  men  more  often  experi-
enced  other  accidents  or  assault.  As  interpersonal 
trauma  is  associated  with  higher  conditional  PTSD 
risk  (Kessler  et  al.,  2017),  this  may  have  contributed 
to  the  absence  of  sex  differences  in  our  sample. 
Additionally,  men  had  more  a  lower  educational 
level compared to women, which also has been asso-
ciated  with  higher  conditional  PTSD  risk  (Brewin, 

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

11

Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). Furthermore, although 
it  was  previously  found  that  subjective  rather  than 
objective  injury  severity  predicted  subsequent  PTSD 
symptoms  after  traumatic  injury  (Gabert-Quillen, 
Fallon,  &  Delahanty,  2011),  we  cannot  exclude  that 
the  higher  injury  severity  in  men  within  our  sample 
also impacted our results. In any case, our results seem 
to  contradict  the  notion  of  a  generally  increased 
female  vulnerability  that  goes  over  and  above  the 
impact  of  trauma-related  and  demographic  factors 
associated with higher conditional PTSD risk.

Looking  at  the  specific  trajectories,  however,  it  is 
interesting  to  note  that  the  delayed  onset  trajectory 
was  more  prevalent  in  men.  This  is  in  line  with  the 
consistent  emergence  of  this  trajectory  in  previous 
trajectory-oriented studies with all- or predominantly 
male  samples 
(Berntsen  et  al.,  2012;  Boasso, 
Steenkamp,  Nash,  Larson,  &  Litz,  2015;  Dickstein, 
Suvak,  Litz,  &  Adler,  2010;  Eekhout,  Reijnen, 
Vermetten,  &  Geuze,  2016),  and  the  consistent 
absence  of  this  trajectory  in  all-  or  predominantly 
female samples (Armour et al., 2012; Self-Brown, Lai, 
Harbin,  &  Kelley,  2014;  Self-Brown,  Lai,  Thompson, 
McGill,  &  Kelley,  2013).  In  these  previous  studies, 
male  samples  were  commonly  exposed  to  trauma  in 
a  professional,  mostly  military,  context,  while  the 
female  samples  included  civilian  populations.  This 
makes  it  difficult  to  disentangle  the  effects  of  sex/ 
gender  and  trauma  population  and  type.  Therefore, 
we investigated differences between women and men 
within a relatively homogenous population of civilians 
with suspected serious injury, to enable a more direct 
investigation  of  sex  differences.  Even  though  the 
trauma type leading to the suspected injuries warrant-
ing hospital evaluation and the injury severity differed 
somewhat  between  men  and  women,  from  our  find-
ings  we  tentatively  conclude  that  male  sex/gender 
increases the risk to belong to the delayed onset symp-
tom  trajectory  over  and  above  the  effects  of  trauma 
population and type.

There  are  some  interesting  parallels  between  the 
observed higher prevalence of the recovery trajectory 
in women within our sample and the previous evalua-
tions  of  responses  to  trauma-focused  psychotherapy 
that indicated stronger symptom remission in women 
than  men  (Wade  et  al.,  2016).  Trauma-focused  psy-
chotherapy  promotes  extinction  learning,  which  is 
likely  also  involved  in  natural  recovery  from  acute 
PTSD  symptoms  (Rothbaum  &  Davis,  2003),  and  it 
would be of interest to further explore sex differences 
in  this  particular  neurocognitive  mechanism  upon 
traumatic  stress.  However,  although  we  did  find  that 
allocation  to  the  intervention  or  non-intervention 
condition did not impact our results, we did not eval-
uate the impact of and potential sex differences within 
additional  treatment  for  PTSD  symptoms  during  the 
study  period.  Therefore,  increased  treatment  seeking

behaviour  of  women,  which  is  a  well-documented 
finding  across  mental  disorders  and  cultures  (Wang 
et al., 2007), might serve as an alternative explanation 
of the increased recovery rates in our sample’s women.
Further  mechanisms  underlying  the  observed  sex 
differences  in  prevalence  of  the  delayed  onset  and 
recovery  trajectories  may  be  related  to  (culture- 
specific) gender-roles or gender-related psychological 
factors,  such  as  attribution  or  coping  strategies,  that 
are influenced by differential male and female sociali-
zation  (Christiansen  &  Berke,  2020;  Norris,  Perilla, 
Ibañez,  &  Murphy,  2001;  Okur,  Pereda,  Van  Der 
Knaap, & Bogaerts, 2019). In addition, sex differences 
in biological reactivity in the immediate aftermath and 
first weeks after the traumatic events may be involved. 
For  example,  autonomic  and  endocrine  responses 
within  the  emergency  department  were  previously 
found  to  differentiate  between  the  four  PTSD  symp-
tom  trajectories  within  our  cohort,  as  determined 
from  self-reported  symptoms  within  the  non-sex- 
disaggregated  samples  (Schultebraucks  et  al.,  2021). 
While  sex  differences  in  these  responses  and  their 
association  with  PTSD  symptom  trajectories  were 
not investigated in this study, there is increasing evi-
dence  for  their  existence  (Seligowski  et  al.,  2021). 
These  potential  aetiological  factors  should  be  further 
investigated.

The  results  on  sex  differences  in  the  prevalence 
rates  of  PTSD  symptom  trajectories  obtained  from 
the  sex-disaggregated  samples  differed  from  those 
obtained from the whole sample. The latter approach 
had a worse model fit and was thus not used for basing 
our  final  conclusions  on.  The  most  important  differ-
ence between both approaches was that when we first 
specified PTSD symptom trajectories within the whole 
sample,  we  found  that  women  were  more  often 
assigned  to  the  chronic  trajectory  than  men.  This 
finding did not emerge when we investigated the dif-
ference in the prevalence rates from the respective sex- 
disaggregated  samples.  Thus,  our  findings  based  on 
the  analyses  within  the  whole  sample  actually  sup-
ported  the  common  assumption  that  women  tend  to 
develop  chronic  or  clinical  PTSD  symptoms  more 
often.  However,  this  is likely  a  statistical artefact  dri-
ven by the overrepresentation of men (62.5%) within 
our  whole  sample,  which  lead  to  inadvertent  assign-
ment  of  resilient  women  with  symptoms  well  below 
(sub)clinical  threshold  levels  into  the  chronic  trajec-
tory.  This  interpretation  is  supported  by  the  results 
from our sex-disaggregated analyses, in which symp-
tom levels of resilient women were significantly higher 
than those of resilient men, albeit clearly below (sub) 
thresholds.  Methodological  research  has 
clinical 
shown  that  latent  models  estimated  without  the 
appropriate  inclusion  of  the  effects  of  the  predictors 
of interest may result in biased conclusions (Vermunt, 
2010). Our whole sample model was likely affected by 

this.  However, the  approach  we applied  in the  whole 
sample  model  fits  with  the  predominant  approach 
within  the  field,  as  the  previous  studies  that  investi-
gated  sex-and  gender-differences  in  PTSD  trajectory 
prevalence  rates  all  seem  to  have  added  sex  either  as 
a  predictor  of  class  assignment  after  latent  model 
estimation  (as  was  our  whole  sample  approach),  or 
as  fixed  regressor  across  classes  during  latent  model 
estimation.  Consequently,  we  tentatively  assume  that 
the observed estimation bias with regard to the trajec-
tory  prevalence  rates  and  associated  sex  differences 
may also extend to other studies within the field, and 
may  at  least  partly  explain  findings  of  increased  risk 
for non-resilient symptom trajectories in women com-
pared to men (Berntsen et al., 2012; Bryant et al., 2015; 
Johannesson  et  al.,  2015;  Lowe  et  al.,  2021;  Orcutt 
et al., 2004; Pietrzak et al., 2014). Thus, our in-depth 
analysis  of  sex-specific  PTSD  symptom  trajectories, 
their  courses  and  prevalence  rates  within  the  sex- 
disaggregated  dataset  holds  methodological  advances 
compared to previously applied approaches.

Additionally,  by  using  data  of  emergency  care 
patients,  PTSD  symptoms  were  clearly  traceable  to 
one specific traumatic event. However, it needs to be 
noted  that,  as  all  patients  were  treated  at  the  emer-
gency department because of suspected severe injury, 
our sample is highly specific and not representative for 
all  traumatic  event  survivors,  many  of  whom  do  not 
suffer from or are not treated for (suspected) injuries. 
Moreover,  although  our  sex-disaggregated  sample 
sizes  are  considered  to  be  large  enough  for  reliable 
Bayesian  LGMM  analyses,  the  resulting  sample  sizes 
of participants assigned to the smaller trajectories are 
modest  and  do  not  allow  for  further  investigation  of 
factors  potentially  associated  with  trajectory  assign-
ment  that  may  have  influenced  our  results,  such  as 
index trauma type and injury severity. Therefore, our 
results  need  replication  in  other  datasets  in  order  to 
increase  generalizability.  Such  datasets  would  ideally 
include  a  higher  number  of  participants,  longer  fol-
low-up  assessments  and  preferably  also  include  indi-
viduals affected by other types of traumas. It remains 
an  interesting  question  whether  the  prevalence  of 
women  in  the  delayed  trajectory  would  be  higher  in 
studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up 
durations than in the present study.

It  further  needs  to  be  mentioned  that  we  defined 
overall  PTSD  symptom  load  as  outcome  of  interest, 
therefore not discriminating between different symp-
tom clusters and not taking potential sex differences in 
symptom presentation into account. Additionally, we 
used  an  instrument  that  was  validated  for  the  DSM- 
IV,  instead  of  the  current  DSM-5.  Therefore,  again, 
further studies are needed to confirm that our results 
are  generalizable  across  PTSD  symptom  clusters  and 
diagnostic  instruments.  Additionally,  we  disaggre-
the  mere  binary 
gated  our  data  based  on 

differentiation  between  men  and  women  based  on 
biological  sex.  We  used  existing  data  collected  over 
a decade ago, and since then, sex and gender have been 
increasingly  considered  to  be  continuous  rather  than 
dichotomous.  Hence,  our  use  of  the  term  sex  differ-
ences  may  be  considered  an  oversimplification  and 
a  more  nuanced  differentiation  is  recommended  in 
the  future.  Regarding  sex-specific  risk  factors,  the 
impact  of  hormonal  contraception,  the  menstrual 
cycle,  and  relatedly,  fluctuating  sex  hormones  on 
PTSD  trajectories  was  not  studied  here  and  deserves 
more  attention  in  future  studies  (Kornfield  et  al., 
2018).  There  is  previous  evidence  on  the  protective 
impact of hormonal contraception after trauma (Engel 
et al., 2019; Ferree, Wheeler, & Cahill, 2012), as well as 
evidence  linking  oestrogens  to  adaptive  fear  proces-
sing  (Bierwirth,  Sperl,  Antov,  &  Stockhorst,  2021; 
Ferree & Cahill, 2009; Glover et al. 2012; Milad et al., 
2010). Regarding gender-specific factors, it seems par-
ticularly  promising  to  investigate  the  impact  of  psy-
chological  attribution  and  coping  strategies  that  are 
influenced  by  differential  male  and  female  socializa-
tions (Christiansen & Berke, 2020; Okur et al., 2019).
Our study provides recommendations for how to 
design  future,  sex-  and  gender-sensitive  PTSD 
research. First: collecting longitudinal data on PTSD 
symptom  development  and  analysing  trajectories 
seems  to  result  in  a  more  nuanced  and  dynamic 
picture  than  the  endpoint  PTSD  approach.  Second, 
our study provides statistical arguments for estimat-
ing 
sex- 
disaggregated datasets or with appropriate inclusion 
of  sex  during  initial  model  estimation  as  a  class- 
varying  regressor  (Vermunt,  2010).  Importantly, 
our findings of limited sex differences in PTSD symp-
tom  trajectories  do  not  diminish  the  importance  of 
investigating  potential  differences  between  men  and 
women  in  the  aetiological  mechanisms  underlying 
PTSD development, nor of investigating the potential 
sex-differential  impact  of  risk and  protective  factors 
for PTSD or efficacy of preventive interventions. All 
these topics for future study warrant the appropriate 
statistical  modelling  of  sex-specific  trajectories  and 
their  respective  courses.  This  is  especially  relevant 
when  ratios  between  men  and  women  within  the 
sample  are  imbalanced,  as  in  our  study.  The  Sex 
and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines 
(Heidari,  Babor,  De  Castro,  Tort,  &  Curno,  2016) 
also emphasize that sex and gender-sensitive research 
requires balanced ratios between men and women. In 
a  recent  review,  this  has  been  operationalized  by 
a  minimum  of  40%  for  the  underrepresented  sex  or 
gender  (Rechlin,  Splinter,  Hodges,  Albert,  &  Galea, 
2021).  However,  imbalanced  sex  and  gender  ratios 
are common for various trauma populations, includ-
ing  emergency  department  patients  as  included  in 
our  study  (Lowe  et  al.,  2021),  and  will  likely  occur

To  sum  up,  in  this  sex-disaggregated  Bayesian 
latent  growth  mixture  modelling  analysis  of  PTSD 
symptom development in female and male emergency 
care  patients,  the  same  four  PTSD  symptom  trajec-
tories  were  observed  in  men  and  women.  Sex  differ-
trajectory  courses  and 
ences  emerged 
prevalence  rates.  Yet,  contrary  to  what  may  have 
been expected based on previous research, symptoms 
were  not  generally  higher  in  women  across  trajec-
tories,  but  only  within  the  resilient  trajectory. 
Further,  women  were  not  more  often  assigned  to 
a  trajectory  with  high  long-term  PTSD  symptom 
severity,  namely,  chronic  or  delayed  onset.  Our  ana-
lyses contributed to a more nuanced understanding of 
the  temporal  dynamics  of  PTSD  symptom  develop-
ment  in  men  and  women.  Moreover,  they  provide 
additional support for the notion that sex- and gender- 
sensitive  research  critically  depends  on  the  use  of 
appropriate  statistical  techniques,  to  avoid  biased 
model  estimations  for  the  underrepresented  sex  or 
gender.  By  applying  appropriate  statistical  analysis 
techniques  and  investigating  sex-  and  gender-related 
factors  that  impact  traumatic  event  processing  and 
subsequent  PTSD 
sex- 
sensitive  approaches can yield  direct, practical  impli-
cations for precision medicine.
