Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous, behaviorally deﬁned neurodevel-
opmental disorder. Over the past two decades, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders has
progressively increased, however, no clear diagnostic markers and speciﬁcally targeted medications
for autism have emerged. As a result, neurobehavioral abnormalities, neurobiological alterations
in ASD, and the development of novel ASD pharmacological therapy necessitate multidisciplinary
collaboration. In this review, we discuss the development of multiple animal models of ASD to
contribute to the disease mechanisms of ASD, as well as new studies from multiple disciplines to
assess the behavioral pathology of ASD. In addition, we summarize and highlight the mechanistic
advances regarding gene transcription, RNA and non-coding RNA translation, abnormal synaptic sig-
naling pathways, epigenetic post-translational modiﬁcations, brain-gut axis, immune inﬂammation
and neural loop abnormalities in autism to provide a theoretical basis for the next step of precision
therapy. Furthermore, we review existing autism therapy tactics and limits and present challenges
and opportunities for translating multidisciplinary knowledge of ASD into clinical practice.

1. Introduction

Autism is a collection of genetically variant neurodevelopmental disorders that
manifest as early social intercourse dysfunction and impaired repetitive behaviors and
interests [1]. Based on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, approximately 1 in 44 chil-
dren are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [2]. The prevalence of autism
is over four times greater among boys than girls, and it commonly has co-occurring condi-
tions, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder,
as well as challenging behaviors such as sleep and self-harm [3]. Autistic individuals have
atypical cognitive deﬁcits, like impaired social cognition and perception, executive dysfunc-
tion, and atypical perception and information processing. These features are underpinned
by atypical neurodevelopment at the systems level [4].

Both genetics and environmental factors early in development play a vital role in
the etiology of autism [5]. Genetic variation in genes dramatically increases ASD risk.
Features of autism may be detected in early childhood, but the diagnosis of autism is
usually not made until much later. Early diagnosis requires a joint multidisciplinary
assessment, and targeted behavioral interventions and pharmacological treatment can
only somewhat reduce the social impairment and emotional instability-induced aggression
and decrease the complications, but cannot completely cure them. Current research has
not identiﬁed clear neuropathological markers of autism that can provide a basis for
diagnostic criteria, and at this stage, it is speculated that abnormal behavior in autism is
associated with alterations in emerging properties of brain function. Thus, studying the

physiological mechanisms and potential pathogenesis of brain circuits is crucial for future
diagnostic treatments.

Here, we brieﬂy overview advances made using transgenic mouse models as well
as altered environmental factors to investigate ASD neuropathology. A comprehensive
approach was used to analyze pathological correlations between ASD animal data and
ASD populations. The molecular biological mechanisms and neural circuits associated
with autism spectrum disorders were also integrated to explore further the critical circuit
elements and underlying molecular mechanisms involved in each set of symptoms of
ASD disorders. Finally, the progress and shortcomings of current ASD treatment options
are summarized, as are the prospective difﬁculties of recent autism research and future
development plans (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Translation cycle of ASD research. Epidemiological studies of ASD patients can identify
abnormal genes and underlying risk factors, including genetic mutations, copy number variations
(CNVs), environmental exposures, and maternal immune activation during pregnancy. Based on
these data, different animal models will be developed and characterized for their variations. A
comprehensive analysis of animal models combined with human pathology to understand the
pathogenesis of ASD holds promise as a new therapeutic strategy to feed back to patients.

2. Technological Advances in Animal Models of Autism

Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder with a vital hereditary element,
but environmental factors, including toxicants, insecticide, infections, and medications,
have been familiar to contribute to autism susceptibility. Current animal models of ASD
include genetic animal models, CNVs -induced syndrome ASD animal models, idiopathic
animal models and environmentally induced types, which have different advantages and
individual limitations in generating ASD among different models [6,7]. We can improve
drugs and optimize treatment regimens by thoroughly analyzing the mechanics of various
animal models. Meanwhile newly developed devices facilitate combination of valproic
acid (VPA) with other techniques to probe the neural basis of complex behaviors associated
with ASD (Table 1).

Changes of various interleukins in brain

[65]

Based on family and population studies, ASD heritability is about 50% that of mental
illness and is even higher in identical twins [7]. Using present techniques, the genetic cause
of the presence of ASD is clear in approximately only 20% cases [10]. In this part, we outline
the neuropathological abnormalities reported in animal models following various gene
ablation and assess the importance of transgenic models in ASD.

Neurexins (NRXNs): NRXN genes encode α and β-neurexin proteins, which assume a
signiﬁcant part in synaptic adhesion, differentiation and maturation as presynaptic binding
partners of NLGN [7–9]. NRXN1, one of the susceptibility genes for ASD, has point
mutations that are often associated with loss of function [66]. NRXN3 is also correlated with
abnormal ASD function [67]. KO animals with all three NRXN genes knocked out or double
knockout of NRXN1/2 were observed to have reduced inhibitory synapses in the brainstem
and cortex. Contact protein-associated protein 2 (CNTNAP2), a member of the NRXN
family, encodes contact protein-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2). recessive mutations or
chromosomal inversions in CNTNAP2 have been observed in ASD individuals. CASPR2
is required for dendritic arborization, stabilization of dendritic spines, and α-amino-3-
hydroxyl-5-methyl-4isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafﬁcking. CNTNAP2
knockout mice also showed abnormalities in the corpus callosum and in somatosensory
cortex neuronal migration.

Neuroligins (NLGNs): Trans-synaptic complexes formed by postsynaptic NLGNs and
presynaptic neurexins are considered to facilitate synaptic stability. Different compositions
of these cell adhesion molecules have been associated with formation of glutamate or
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synapses. MRI scans revealed that Nlgn3-knockout mice
have a smaller brain volume than controls [12]. Nlgn3 knock-in (KI) mice showed increased
postnatal turnover of excitatory spines in layer II and III pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal
cortex and elevated expression of saccadic GABA transporters in somatosensory cortical
neurons, but no changes in inhibitory synapse counts or ultrastructure [11,13]. The volume

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

of multiple brain regions is reduced in Nlgn3R451C KI mice that exhibit the Nlgn3R451C
mutation seen in persons with ASD [14]. The Nlgn3R704C KI animal model, mimics an
ASD-related mutation, demonstrates reduced AMPA receptor-mediated hippocampal
neurotransmission but no similar reduction for N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) or
GABA, perhaps due to increased AMPA receptor internalization [68].

SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 3 (SHANK3): SHANK3 is a post-
synaptic density (PSD) protein that interacts with and binds with several ionotropic and
metabotropic glutamate receptors. ASD and Phelan-McDermid syndrome are linked to
SHANK3 mutations [15,18]. SHANK3 mutations and chromosomal rearrangements at
22q13.3 can cause Phelan-McDermid syndrome [69].
It has been suggested that
SHANK3-deﬁcient heterozygotes are associated with the defects observed in ASD and
Phelan–McDermid syndrome [70]. Consistently, the current work shows that mouse
models having distinct SHANK3 isoforms exhibit ASD behavior [71]. Models that ab-
late the full-length SHANK3 isoform by deleting exons 4–9 show decreased glutamate
receptor 1 immunoreactive spots in hippocampal CA1 [19]. In SHANK3/- mice lacking
Shank 3α and β dendritic length and complexity were increased, while PSD length and
spiny neuron thickness were lessened. The striatum of KO mouse models disrupting all
SHANK3 isoforms show abnormal spine density and PSD. Similarly, reinstating SHANK3
expression in mature SHANK3 deﬁcient mice has been demonstrated to salvage dendritic
spine loss and excitatory synaptic function in the striatum [69]. Finally, SHANK3 is critical
in coordinating integration of the numerous glutamate receptors of the PSD and linking
synaptic signaling to spinal movements.

Tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2): Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an
autosomal dominant disorder with a feature of benign tumor nodules in a variety of organs
and an elevated risk of malignancy [72]. The prevalence of ASD among TSC mutation
carriers is between approximately 36% and 50% [47]. In TSC patients, abnormalities in neu-
ronal migration and differentiation in and around cortical nodules have been observed [73].
Research in TSC2 mutant subjects suggest that cortical nodules have abnormal neurons and
aberrant stratiﬁcation, along with cell loss leading to hippocampal sclerosis and cerebellar
atrophy [20,21]. Tsc1 knockout in forebrain pyramidal neurons has little effect on somatic
cell size or dendritic shape but increases the spine density of temporal lobe cortical neurons.
The spine density and pruning of Tsc2+/− mice layer V neurons in the temporal cortex
increased with age. In Tsc2+/− Eker rats, hippocampal neurons show an increase in spine
length but a decrease in spine width and number of excitatory synapses. Researches have
shown that TSC1/2 gene mutations lead to abatement of its inhibitory effect on mammalian
rapamycin (mTOR) protein, causing misregulation of mTOR signaling [22].

Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 gene (FMR1): Fragile X is generated by ampliﬁcation
or uncommon point mutation in the promoter of cytosine-guanine-guanine trinucleotide in
the fragile X mental retardation gene [74]. Fragile X syndrome mental retardation protein
(FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that modulates synaptic plasticity by interacting with
speciﬁc mRNAs in the brain [23,24]. Furthermore, roughly 22% of FMR1 mutation carriers
and 30% of men in this category match the ASD diagnostic criteria [19]. It was found that
subjects with fragile X syndrome had increased spine density and length in the temporal
lobe and visual cortex, predominantly in the immature spine. In the visual cortex of adult
FMR1−/− mice, there were more immature spines and less mature spines [25]. Never-
theless, the opposite is true in CA1. FMR1−/− mice have increased spine density in the
somatosensory cortex 4–7 days after birth. However, it is not present in the hippocampus.
The above experimental results consider that FMR1 has brain region-speciﬁc effects in
synaptic maturation. It has also been observed that FMR1 shows varying effects on synaptic
development with age. Hippocampal neurons in FMR1 KO pups are dominated by the
occurrence of short spines, while adult mice have more occurrence of long spines. The
variation in spine morphology observed may be caused by changes in spinal ﬂip. Adult
FMR1 mice exhibit a higher rate of spine renewal in the visual cortex. The neurological and
behavioral damage in FMR1 knockout mice can be rescued to some extent by removing

p70 s6 kinase 1 or by treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids [65]. Pietropaolo’s study
revealed that daily supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) also improved so-
cial interaction, emotional and non-spatial memory, and normalized some of the symptoms
in FMR1-Ko mice. It caused a reduction in some neuroiﬂammatory changes in the brain.

Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2): MECP2 gene mutations lead to Rett syn-
drome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting females [75]. More
than 61% of Rett syndrome patients match the criteria for ASD, including repetitive hand
movements, social withdrawal, and loss of verbal communication [76,77]. Many human
symptoms are generalized by mouse models lacking in MECP2, making them a suitable
experimental paradigm for exploring the underlying processes of ASD behavior. Patients
with Rett syndrome have reduced brain size, smaller neurons, increased neuronal accumu-
lation, and reduced neuronal dendritic complexity in frontal and motor cortex layers III
and V. Some mouse models have shown neocortical thinning. An increase in cell density
and smaller neuronal cell bodies were noticed in several brain regions [28,78]. In MECP2-
deﬁcient mice, the spinal heads in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal CA1 regions are
smaller, and axonal direction in the motor cortex is altered. These changes appear to result
from the delayed neuronal growth and synapse formation induced by MECP2 haploin-
sufﬁciency, a developmental defect that does not improve with age. MECP2 deﬁciency
leads to fewer glutamatergic synapses and higher baseline levels of AMPA, indicating
an activity-dependent failure of synaptic receptor transport [29]. Mutant mice encoding
the transcriptional regulator MECP2 gene present autism-like behavioral traits typical of
Rett syndrome. Guy et al. found that re-expression of the MECP2 gene manipulated by
gene-editing techniques in a mouse model of autism reversed behavioral changes similar
to autism, as well as the typical neurological abnormal symptoms of Rett syndrome [65].
Emerging potential genetic models of ASD: In the following discussion, several models
are ASD-related genetic models emerging in recent years, and although some of following
have been validated for the ASD phenotype, relevant neuropathological data are less
available. Thus, there is growing interest in potential emerging transgenic animal models.
The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) gene encodes a chromatin-
modiﬁed gene on chromosome 14q11.2, which has been identiﬁed as a high-risk gene
for ASD. In a cohort of approximately 6000 autistic patients, 0.2% had speciﬁc ab ini-
tio CHD8 mutations [30]. Patients with CHD8 mutations have head-size differences, as
well as presenting developmental delays, cognitive impairment, motor deﬁciencies, and
anxiety [79,80]. CHD8 has been found to mediate the transcription of ASD risk factors in
human neural progenitor cells, as well as brain development pathways including neuronal
differentiation, synaptic development, cell adhesion, and axonal guidance [30]. In P23-25, a
7-nucleotide deletion in exon 1 resulted in CHD8 single-fold resistant (CHD8+/−) animals
with somewhat reduced social interaction and diminished preference for social novelty.
Relevant MRI analysis indicated that CHD8+/− mice have larger brain volumes than
wild-type controls [31]. CHD8 exon 5 was deleted in order to create a strain of CHD8+/del5
mice that showed transcriptional changes in neurodevelopmental disease pathways such
as neurogenesis, synaptic processes, and neuroimmune signaling. The anterior cortical and
neocortical areas were increased after birth [32].

Sodium channel power-gated type II subunit (SCN2A) mutations are correlated with
epilepsy, intellectual disability, and ASD without epilepsy [81]. Generally, mutations
altering neuronal sodium channel structure, function, or expression lead to epilepsy and
neurological disease, and SCN2A stop codon mutations lead to termination of protein
translation in autism [82]. It has been estimated that 7.5 out of every 100,000 births are
diagnosed with a pathogenic mutation in SCN2A. In 50% of patients diagnosed with
SCN2A syndrome, symptoms are similar to the more familiar forms of ASD, including
reduced social interaction and repeated behaviors [83]. Adult subtypes of Scn2ain mice
showed neuronal hyperexcitability [84]. Mice with the Scn2aGAL879-881QQQ mutation
exhibited neuronal loss and glial hyperplasia in the hippocampus.

Synaptic GTPase-activating protein 1 (Syngap1) is a Ras-GTPase-activating protein
that exists in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic neurons and participates in den-
dritic spine formation, glutamate receptor transport, and synaptic function [85]. Syngap1
mutations are linked to various neurodevelopmental diseases, including non-syndromic
intellectual disability and ASD [86]. Compared to WT mice, Syngap1 deﬁciency resulted in
early dendritic branching, premature pruning, and larger dendritic spines in somatosen-
sory cortical pyramidal neurons at key times in development. The density of mushroom
spines in the hippocampus CA1 of Syngap1+/− mice was enhanced compared with WT
mice, but there was no change in the density of ﬁne or thick spines. Selective induction
of Syngap1 deﬁciency in GABAergic neurons causes reduced presynaptic neuron den-
sity in somatic cells and decreased axon terminal branching of interneurons on cortical
interneurons [34,35]. Syngap1 expression is not expressed in the development of gluta-
matergic neurons in the forebrain, whereas it is expressed in GABAergic neurons, causing
cognitive impairment in mice [19].

Glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA2B (Grin2b) is linked to epileptic encephalopa-
thy, ASD, and other neurological disorders in which Grin2b haploinsufﬁciency is often
an important factor [45,87]. GluN2B deletion disrupts protein-dependent homeostatic
plasticity, according to in vitro electrophysiological investigations. In vitro inhibition of
Grin2b causes delayed migration of cortical neurons, as well as increases in dendritic length
and branching. The involvement of GluN2B in modulating synaptic maturation has been
established in rat cortical and spinal cord co-cultures, with synaptic elimination reduced
when postsynaptic GluN2B is lacking. Dendritic spine density is decreased in mice with
conditional GluN2B ablation in CA3 pyramidal neurons and CA1 pyramidal neurons [88].

2.2. Syndromic ASD Animal Models Caused by CNVs

15q11-q13 deletions and 15q13.3 microdeletions: Genomic deletions within the chro-
mosome 15q11-13 locus cause different neurodevelopmental syndromes. Prader-Willi and
Angelman syndromes are the most common, with Prader-Willi syndrome caused partly
by a deletion on the paternal copy of chromosome 15q11.2-q13, uniparental dimorphism,
or imprinting center defects. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome have abnormal dentate
and olivary nuclei distribution, dentate nucleus neurodegeneration, cerebellar ectopia,
expanded ventricles, volume reduction in the parieto-occipital lobe, numerous cerebellar
gyri in the lateral ﬁssure, and smaller cerebellum and brainstem. Angelman syndrome is
caused by maternal copy deletion, chromosome 15q11.2-q13 abnormalities or the E6-AP
ubiquitin protein ligase (UBE3A/E6AP) gene mutation [89]. Approximately 34% of those
affected exhibit autistic-like characteristics. Angelman syndrome patients have smaller
brains, cerebellar atrophy, and reduced white matter integrity. In maternal illness models,
many and thick neural spines are found, as well as decreased presynaptic GABA vesicle
density at inhibitory and excitatory synapses [47,48]. 15q13.3 deletion is associated with
an increased risk of ASD, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and epilepsy [50]. A newly
produced heterozygous D/+ mouse model with a homozygous microdeletion had larger
brains and lateral ventricles in adulthood, and this microdeletion has also been linked to
head enlargement in humans.

16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes: Duplications and deletions of the
16p11.2 gene can result in ASD and other neurological problems [90,91]. According to
recent research, 20% of patients with duplications and 16% with deletions had ASD-like
behavior [51,52]. Subjects with 16p11.2 deletions displayed large head malformations,
whereas duplicated carriers displayed small head deformities [92]. Compared to WT
controls, the 16p11.2 deletion model in mice results in decreased brain weight, cortical
dimensions and disrupted cortical compartmentalization [93]. Another 16p11+/− mouse
model demonstrates an increase in the relative volume of the nucleus ambiguus and pal-
lidum, as well as a decrease in dopaminergic cells in cortical layers V and VI. Although the
relative brain volume alterations in certain animal models may not match those reported
in people with CNV in this chromosomal region, their usage can reveal cellular pathways.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

The relative volume changes in animals modeled with 16p11.2 repeats (DP/+) are the
inverse of those seen in DF/+ mice. Although certain animal models cannot replicate
the abnormalities reported in CNV patients in this chromosomal region, employing these
models can show the molecular pathways that cause brain volume changes.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome: Subjects carrying the 22q11.2 deletion are more likely to
develop DiGeorge syndrome and are predisposed to various neuropsychiatric diseases [94].
A meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of ASD in deletion bearers to be 11%. When
individuals with ASD having the 22q11 deletion were comparing with controls, the right
amygdala volume was increased. More medium-sized multispiny neurons and interneu-
rons clustered in the caudate nucleus in the subcortical white matter. In hippocampal
CA1, dendritic complexity, spine density and PSD length are not affected in the Df1/+
mouse model with 22q11.2 deletion. In vitro cultures of hippocampal neurons from DfA++
animals revealed lower numbers of mushroom spines, diminished spine length, fewer
glutamatergic synapses, and reduced presynaptic vesicle density. The numbers of cells in
layers II and V were decreased in DfA++/− animals, as were inhibitory neurons in layer V.
The length and intricacy of the basal dendrites were reduced.

2.3. Idiopathic Animal Model

ASD is a neurological illness produced by a combination of circumstances, and mu-
tations in single genes do not adequately duplicate all the clinical symptoms of ASD.
Inbred strains of mice and rats displayed substantial and well-replicated ASD-related
social impairments and repetitive behaviors in recent years. It is thought to be a model of
idiopathic autism.

BTBR-T+ tﬂ/J (BTBR): In terms of core ASD behavioral traits, BTBR mice are the most
fully studied and are the most frequently reproduced inbred breed [95]. The lack of the
corpus callosum and signiﬁcant shrinking of the hippocampal conﬂuence characterize
BTBR animals [57]. When BTBR mice were compared to controls, their brain volume was
lowered [59]. These ﬁndings are consistent with an increase in gray matter volume with
time in ASD and are strongly correlated with the seriousness of symptoms. Other notable
differences between BTBR mice and control mice included more neuronal expression of
5-hydroxytryptamine in the median and dorsal caudal spine and fewer axonal terminals
in hippocampal CA1 [58], but increased postnatal turnover of excitatory synapses in the
prefrontal cortex.

BTBR mice performance is connected with genetic alterations in the brain, including
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptophysin. Steinmetz et al. showed
that injecting insulin-like growth factor 2 prior in BTBR mice before behavioral testing
can reverse abnormal behavior and memory deﬁcits [96]. Social interaction and com-
munication in BTBR mice were increased by administering beta carotene according to
Avraham et al. [97]. Silverman et al. reported that by injecting BTBR mice with GRN-529, a
modulator selectively metabolizing glutamate receptor subtype 5, excitatory neurotrans-
mission was manipulated, and ASD-like symptoms were improved. As mentioned above,
immune system dysfunction was thought to be a factor contributing to ASD-like behavior
in BTBR mice. Indeed, Schwarzer discovered that irradiating BTBR mice, achieving bone
marrow ablation, then injecting bone marrow cells from normal C57BL mice improved
mice’s social competence. Studies that proved transplanting bone marrow cells from BTBR
mice into C57BL mice and observed that C57BL mice exhibited an increased number of
repetitive grooming activities, thus demonstrating the importance of the immune system
in social behavior. The advantage of these animal models above is that they allow for
molecular and pathological studies of speciﬁc brain changes, along with gene editing in an
attempt to reverse these ASD-like behavioral changes [98].

2.4. Environmental Models

Models of environmentally induced ASD-like behaviors attempt to treat off-
spring directly by affecting the mother or early after birth. Generally divided into

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

10 of 40

infectious/inﬂammatory means and speciﬁc chemicals (valproic acid) promoting autism-
like behavioral traits.

Speciﬁc chemicals (valproic acid) exposure: VPA is a short-chain fatty acid used ex-
tensively as an antiepileptic and mood stabilizer [99]. Clinical studies have shown an
increased risk of numerous neural tube defects, extracerebral malformations, developmen-
tal delays, cognitive impairment and autism when VPA is taken during pregnancy [100].
Fetal valproic acid syndrome (FVS) develops from prenatal exposure to VPA, and children
with FVS display a signiﬁcantly increased incidence of developmental problems, decreased
verbal intelligence, and often comorbid communication problems associated with ASD.
Intriguingly, rodents exposed to VPA before birth exhibited deﬁcient behavior comparable
to that of autistic individuals. Thus, the VPA rodent model has been widely used as a
common model for studying the neurobiology of autism and screening new drugs [101].

There is now substantial evidence that maternal challenge with VPA in rodents is a
favorable animal model for autism. A possible link between maternal exposure to VPA and
offspring ASD was ﬁrst described by Christianson et al. Later, larger studies conﬁrmed the
association between intrauterine exposure to VPA and autism. Based on the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, statistics found that 8.9% of 56 children
with prenatal exposure to VPA in the monotherapy study developed autism or Asperger’s
syndrome. A large study based on the Danish population revealed a 2-fold increase in
the prevalence of ASD among 508 kids prenatally exposed to VPA. Prenatal exposure
to VPA in rodents is associated with behavioral and neuroanatomical deﬁcits, including
reduced social interactions, greater repetitive behaviors, and more anxiety, accompanied
by a reduction in the number of cerebellar Purkinje cells, nucleus damage, and cortical
synaptic changes like those observed in ASD humans.

Acute higher doses of VPA exposure resulted in decreased brain weight, increased
cortical layer thickness, cell density in the prefrontal and somatosensory cortices, and
hippocampus. On the other hand, lower doses had no effect on brain weight, but affected
cortical thickness and neocortical cell density. VPA exposure leads to thinning of the
early prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala, and hippocampal CA1 [102,103]. VPA
exposure leads to a decrease in microalbumin-expressing interneurons in the parietal and
occipital cortices and a decrease in the number of motor neurons in some brainstem motor
nuclei [64]. VPA-treated rats showed an increase in microglia in the medial PFC and
astrocytes in the hippocampus [104].

Current studies have reported that using antioxidants such as astaxanthin, piperine,
and green tea extract are effective in preventing VPA-induced ASD-like behavior in rats
and mice [105]. The polyunsaturated fatty acids α linoleic acid (ALA) or γ linoleic acid
(GLA) attenuate neurobehavioral changes in VPA rat offspring by reducing oxidative
stress marker concentrations [106]. A recent study found that VPA rat offspring, injected
with guanfacine (an endogenous NMDA receptor antagonist) at one-half hour prior to
behavioral testing, alleviated ASD-like symptoms. Interestingly, repetitive behaviors in
VPA rat offspring were prevented by low-dose injections of donepezil [62]. A current
study found that repetitive behaviors were signiﬁcantly reduced and social skills improved
using human adipose-derived stem cells injected into VPA rat offspring ventricles [107].
However, these drugs must be administered continuously to be effective. There are no data
to support successful prevention of VPA-induced neurobehavioral impairment in humans.
Maternal immune activation: Maternal immune activation during pregnancy is highly
associated with ASD incidence in offspring [108]. Studies have showed that maternal
immune activation leads to alterations in levels of multiple interleukin-like factors in the
fetal brain, accompanied by morphological abnormalities in different brain regions [65].
Maternal mid-pregnancy injection with endotoxin and polysaccharide polycyclic acid
induced autism-like behaviors in offspring. Viral inﬂuenza infection in pregnant mice at
mid-gestation resulted in decreased social competence in the offspring. Infection with
Borna virus in rats leads to increased stereotypic behaviors associated with autism in
offspring. Pioglitazone, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

11 of 40

with anti-inﬂammatory effects, has been shown to attenuate autistic-like behavioral changes
in the offspring of endotoxin-treated rats [109]. These models can be utilized to explore
neurological and behavioral changes along with the molecular and biochemical mechanisms
involved in neurological pathology, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
The majority of these animal models assess inﬂammatory processes rather than speciﬁc
viruses.Animal models of genetic mutations in ASD reveal differential effects of genetic
variation in individual genes on ASD-related phenotypes. But ASD is heterogeneous, and it
is difﬁcult for a single transgenic model to recapitulate all its symptoms. At the same time,
transgenic models are susceptible to the inﬂuence of genetic background. CNV animal
models have high genetic penetrance and a strong association with ASD manifestations.
But CNVs are less common in the general patient population. Idiopathic animal models
mimic many of the aberrations found in the ASD population. But the behavior of this strain
of mice must be compared with that of other unrelated mice [110]. The rodent with VPA is
an important model of autism and may be more representative of many cases of idiopathic
autism due to environmental/exogenous causes than autism models carrying mutations in
a single associated gene. However, most people with autism are not exposed to the drug
before birth. Therefore, the validity of the VPA rodent model may be limited to cases of
autism resulting from exposure to drugs that act as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.

3. Importance of Multidisciplinary Assessment of Animal Models of Autism

At present, clinical ASD is mainly diagnosed through the basis of behavioral disorders
and no speciﬁc neurodiagnostic markers are available. Therefore, tools to assess the
development of ASD-like behaviors must be created. Currently established ASD rodents
assess ASD-like behaviors in humans primarily through the following behavioral tests.
In order to explore potential tools that may engage in the neurobiological mechanisms
of human ASD, a multi-dimensional approach is proposed to study animal models of
ASD, combining core behaviors, neuroimaging, neuropathology, and neurochemistry in
animal models.

3.1. ASD Core Behavioral Testing

Core behaviors in ASD mainly show behavioral cognitive deﬁcits of social behavior
impairment, repetitive behaviors, and cognitive rigidity. It is mainly assessed by ultrasonic
vocalization test, open-ended test, social novelty preference test, maze experiment, and
novelty recognition test.

Ultrasonic vocalization in mice may be a valuable marker to differentiate between
the control and ASD models [111]. Autism-like disorders can be detected in interactions
between offspring and their mothers. The number of ultrasonic vocalizations decreased
after separation of prenatal VPA-exposed pups from their mothers in isolation testing,
while the duration of vocalization events consistently increased [112]. Where calls had
a lower amplitude, there were more ﬂat calls, a change in the number of complex and
downward calls, less variety in call types, and fewer 2-syllable calls [113,114]. Instead,
offspring injected with VPA between gestation days 11 and 13 exhibited increased call
frequency [115]. Other ﬂaws included lower call amplitude, complicated and downward
call number alterations [113]. Although contradictory to earlier ﬁndings in the literature, it
may be attributable to the divergent dose ranges of VPA employed in various experiments.
Open-ﬁeld tests are used to evaluate changes in gross locomotor activity in rodent
performance levels. The test is commonly applied in classical experiments to detect core
symptoms of an ASD diagnosis including stereotyped motor behavior, repetitive self-
modiﬁcation, and restriction of exploration activities. The open-ended test is strongly
associated with social behavior and anxiety in mice and rats with autism [116].

Three-chamber social interaction tests are used to measure social competence and pref-
erence for social novelty by calculating the ratio of time spent on novel social stimuli to time
spent on familiar social stimuli. In rats and mice exposed to VPA, the three-compartment
social approach revealed deﬁcits in social interaction [117]. Markram discovered that

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

12 of 40

VPA- exposed rats and mice exhibited reduced play activity and exploration of heterotypic
adventures, which lends more credence to the effect of VPA on sociality.

The T-maze test is used to assess memory and cognitive abilities in rodents. The
animal’s capacity to spontaneously alternate is examined using a closed apparatus, and
is primarily affected by hippocampal dependent function [118]. Water T-maze serves to
measure reversal learning, cognitive rigidity, and repeated behavior. The animal must
suppress the ﬁrst learning reaction and learn a new place on the platform [119]. Three-arm
maze is used to evaluate short-term memory, measuring mainly hippocampal function in
mice and rats [120].

3.2. Neuropathology

Neuropathological studies can evaluate subtle features affecting ASD patients’ brains
such as neuronal differentiation migration, morphology and spatial distribution. Numerous
neuropathological examinations have been performed in ASD, and here we provide an
update of these results.

Neuron size, number, and density: Early autopsy studies compared the number of
neurons and neuroglia in various regions of the cerebral cortex of autistic patients to age-
and gender-matched controls. Autistic brains had lower neuroglial/neuronal ratios across
the board, but no signiﬁcant differences in cell density were detected [121]. Another study
discovered 79% more neurons in the DL-PFC and 29% more neurons in the M-PFC in
7 male autistic children than in 6 controls [122]. The autistic group’s brain weight was
slightly higher than average, indicating a pathological increase in neuron number. A stereo-
logical study [123] estimated neuronal volumes in the cortical structures, hippocampus,
arches, cerebellum, and brainstem of 14 autistic individuals. Neuronal volumes were
observed to be reduced in the locations studied. Signiﬁcant deﬁcits in 14 subregions were
detected in four autistic patients aged 4–8 years, but volume deﬁcits were found in only
three or four of the 16 examined regions in six subjects aged 11–23 years and four subjects
aged 36 years. Purkinje cells and neurons in the claustrum have consistently decreased
neuronal volumes throughout their lifespan. However, the developmental trajectory of
neuronal volume changes revealed an increase in neuronal volume in both adolescents and
adults with autism, as well as a decrease in neuronal size in most regions in older controls,
indicating an abnormal neuronal growth trajectory.

Neuronal migration impairment: It has been proposed that cerebral cortical abnormal-
ities found on magnetic resonance imaging examination of autistic individuals are caused
by a malfunction in neuron migration to the cerebral cortex during the ﬁrst 6 months of
gestation. Other signs of cortical dysgenesis identiﬁed in autism patients include thicker
cortex, high neuronal density, minicolumnar changes, the presence of neurons at the molec-
ular layer, abnormal laminar patterns, weak grey-white matter borders, and ectopic grey
matter [124]. The discovery of lower levels of Reelin in post-mortem cerebellum tissue
from autistic patients lends credence to the idea of disrupted neuronal migration in autism.
Reelin expression was demonstrated to be decreased in the cerebral cortex of pregnant mice
offspring exposed to human inﬂuenza virus in pregnancy [125].

Other neuropathologies: Research found disturbances in cortical cell patterning in the
superior temporal gyrus, dorsolateral frontal lobes, and dorsal parietal lobes, including
dysplasias, related lamination disturbances, and a vaguely less deﬁned gray/white matter
border in 8 ASD participants. The most reliable indicator of an affected area was a lack of
expression of excitatory cortical neuron markers [126]. These patches of aberrant laminar
cytoarchitecture and cortical disarray were observed in neurons but not in glia. However,
there were signiﬁcant differences in which cell types and layers were most affected by the
pathological features. In ASD patients, a dramatic reduction was observed in pyramidal
neuron size in the inferior frontal cortex suggesting that long distance communication is
hindered. This was conﬁrmed by neuropathology [127]. Meanwhile, hypoactivation of
the syrinx gyrus was observed in the temporal cortex of ASD, which may be related to
reduced mitochondrial energy metabolism. The subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

13 of 40

is one of two neurogenic niches in the brain that are required for neural proliferation,
migration, and differentiation throughout both prenatal and postnatal development. Early
analysis in ASD patients with the amygdala showed reduced volume and higher neuronal
density in the medial, central and cortical nuclei, whereas the most recent quantiﬁcation
in ASD patients showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of neurons in the amyg-
dala as a whole or in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala [128]. The reduction in the
number of neurons might be due to less neurons formed during the developmental pro-
cess or could be caused by abnormal degeneration of cells that occurs after normal early
development loss.

3.3. Neuroimaging

In the past decade, in vivo MRI research has contributed many useful insights into the
neural basis of ASD. Human neuroimaging research may contribute to biomarker devel-
opment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as novel approaches to
diagnosis and treatment.

A growing number of neuroimaging studies support early atypical brain development
and widespread alterations in ASD neurological connections. Normal brain development
is reliant on both cellular and synaptic growth, as well as the properly timed trimming
of neurons and synapses [129]. This balance appears to be compromised among some
children with autism. A recent neuroimaging study addressing 6 months of age at-risk
infants with ASD showed that the aforementioned children exhibit abnormal connectivity
in brain trajectories. According to multiple studies, the extent of atypical connectivity at
6 months of age relates to future symptom severity [130,131]. Children with ASD exhibit a
sustained expansion of cortical surface area from auditory and visual processing sensory
areas beginning at 6 months to 12 months of age, with overdevelopment at 12 months to
24 months of age [132]. Similarly, the overgrowth observed in individuals with ASD may
not represent new neurodevelopment because neuronal cells may not be apoptotic and
pruned early in development due to neuronal overgrowth. Children with autism continue
to have larger brain sizes than their counterparts from the age of 2 to 4 years. By school
age, brain development has slowed and the brain volume of normally growing children
is catching up to the brain volume of children with autism. Studies of connectivity have
revealed persistent impairments in the way brain regions are connected throughout child-
hood, adolescence, and maturation. A major pooled study of functional MRI resting-state
data from ASD patients compared to age-matched normal controls showed widespread low
connectivity in distant cortico-cortical and hemispheric projections. In contrast, subcortical
regions exhibited local hyperconnectivity [133]. Overall, these ﬁndings indicate that higher
brain activity requiring communication between brain regions are suppressed to the beneﬁt
of local circuits that may be hyperactive and difﬁcult to interrupt.

Neuroimaging studies are advancing us in understanding the biology of ASD, how-
ever, there is no evidence to support that routine neuroimaging can conﬁrm a diagnosis of
ASD. Before neuroimaging may be considered for clinical application, further research is
needed to better understand and standardize the developmental trajectory of the brain in
ASD, which could eventually be used to detect children at risk of developing ASD before
overt symptoms appear.

3.4. Neurochemistry

From a neurochemical perspective, brain structures and neural circuit activity are
regulated by a combination of neurotransmitters. Changes in neurotransmitter concentra-
tions and dynamics can affect neuron-related functions [134]. Growing evidence suggests
disturbances in the neurotransmitter system may be associated with ASD, including mainly
GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine, and N-acetyl aspartate, among other agents.

Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), derived from glutamate by the action of glutamic
acid decarboxylase, is the most frequent excitatory neurotransmitter in the developing
brain and has a complex link to neuronal excitability [135–138]. Alterations in the gabamin-

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

14 of 40

ergic and glutaminergic systems can disrupt the excitatory/inhibitory balance, which is a
possible causative factor in autistic development. Elevated excitatory/inhibitory balance
impairs information processing and causes social-behavioral dysfunction. In mouse models
with mutations in SHANK3 and the glial-neuropilin complex, glutamate concentrations
in the striatum were shown to be reduced [138]. Furthermore, in magnetic resonance
spectroscopy tests, reduced GABA was observed in participants in motor, visual, auditory,
and somatosensory regions, as well as in the left hemisphere lateral ﬁssure region, resulting
in aberrant information processing [139]. When compared to controls, kids with autism
had markedly elevated plasma GABA and glutamate/glutamine ratios, but signiﬁcantly
lower plasma glutamine levels and glutamate/GABA ratios [140]. MECP2 mutant mice
change synaptic physiology by decreasing glutamic acid decarboxylase-1 and -2 levels
and GABA immunoreactivity, resulting in GABA dysfunction and various autism-like
Rett syndrome characteristics. Several studies have highlighted links with GABA receptor
single nucleotide polymorphisms [141,142].

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian cerebral
cortex. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), and metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGluRs) are the three main categories of glutamate receptors [143]. NMDARs and AM-
PARs are thought to be associated with ASD [144]. It has been shown that overexpressing
NMDA receptor subunits in rodent models of autism enhances synaptic currents mediated
by NMDA receptors, thereby enhancing postsynaptic plasticity [145]. Additionally, modiﬁ-
cations to the AMPA Receptor 2 (GluA2) subunit can profoundly affect neuronal excitability,
which is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders including mental retardation and Rett
syndrome. Mouse models of autism containing Cyclin-dependent kinase like-5 deﬁciency
showed signiﬁcant reductions in GluA2 in the hippocampus [146]. Recent studies have re-
ported that the cerebellum is associated with autism spectrum disorders [147]. Interestingly,
it was demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that the cerebellar granule layer was altered in the
islet brain-2 (IB2) KO mouse model and triggered autistic symptoms and severe delayed
motor deﬁcits. The IB2 KO mouse model has high activity and plasticity of NMDA recep-
tors, which determines an increased excitatory/inhibitory balance and enhanced long-term
potentiation of mossy ﬁbers and granule cells [148]. Also, early correction of NMDAR dys-
function in a mouse model showed dramatic improvements in autistic-like behavior [149].
Mutations in synapse-formation and -maintenance genes as well as protein-targeting genes,
have been linked to development of autistic traits and glutamatergic dysfunction [150].

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter that inﬂu-
ences a variety of brain activities including memory and learning capacity [151]. moreover,
acting as a sleep and mood regulator [152]. Serotonin transporter protein or serotonin
levels are higher in children with autism and animal models than in controls. Studies have
indicated that whole-brain 5-HT synthesis is reduced during childhood in children with
autism, but gradually increases between the ages of 2 and 15 years, reaching 1.5 times the
normal adult value [153,154]. Polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter protein gene
(SLC6A4), which encodes platelet and neuronal transport of 5-HT, have been associated
with autism. Higher 5-HT levels found in ASD are abundant in children with the SLC6A4
polymorphism [155]. Obviously, valuable animal evidence suggests that embryos develop-
ing in SLC6A4+/− mothers are less resistant to prenatal stress, which increases the risk
of offspring developing ASD-like traits [156]. Multiple studies have examined platelet
hyperosmolarity in ASD subjects, with a mean increase of 20% to 50%. Intriguingly, this
increase appears to be unique to autism, as it has not been observed in intellectual disability
or other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Dopamine, in addition to controlling locomotion, inﬂuences social cognitive and be-
havioral characteristics via the central cortical circuit [157]. Several investigations have
discovered that ASD is connected to dopamine dysfunction [158,159]. According to re-
search, disfunction of mesocorticolimbic circuit causes social impairment in autism, whereas
dysfunction of nigrostriatal circuit results in stereotyped behavior [160]. Drug-induced

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

15 of 40

nigrostriatal pathway dysfunction produced stereotypic behavior in mice [161]. Indeed,
D1 dopaminergic receptor antagonists were given and these behaviors were reduced. A
recent study supports the idea that mesocortical brain circuit can inﬂuence social behavior
through bidirectional control of dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area
to the nucleus accumbens. Optogenetic stimulation of neurons in the dopaminergic ventral
tegmental region activates D1 receptors, increasing the amount of time the animal spends
on social interactions [162]. Genetic research has demonstrated that autism is linked to poly-
morphisms in several genes related to the dopaminergic pathway, such as the dopamine
receptors DR3 and DR4, or the dopamine transporter protein (DAT) [163]. One recent
study concerning a mouse model emphasized the mutation in DAT that triggers abnormal
dopamine efﬂux, leading to an autism-like behavioral phenotype [164].

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the central nervous system
that is the major neurotransmitter of motor neurons and the parasympathetic nervous
system at the neuromuscular junction [165]. Abnormalities in the cholinergic system induce
ASD [166]. Current ASD autopsy has revealed substantial decreases in nicotinic subtype
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in brain tissues from the parietal and frontal cortex [167].
Another research found a decrease in α4 nAChRs in the cerebellum, considering that it
may be related to the loss of Purkinje cells and a compensatory increase in α7 nAChRs.
Several investigations on ASD animal models have revealed that nAChRs have a role in
controlling social and repetitive behaviors [168]. α4 nAChR subunit knockout and β2
nAChR subunit knockout mice exhibit increased anxiety and abnormal sleep patterns. α7
nAChR receptors are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus and frontal cortex [167],
and activation of this receptor has a cognitive-promoting impact in animal models [169].
Furthermore, choline supplementation during pregnancy enhances the fetal brain response
to maternal immunological stimulation and avoids certain caused behavioral abnormalities
in the offspring.

4. Biological Mechanisms and Neural Circuitry of ASD

In general, it is believed that associated gene variants in ASD patients and animal
models are likely focused on similar molecular or cellular pathways. ASD is closely
associated with gene transcription, mRNA, and functionally signiﬁcant non-coding mRNA,
altered synaptic signaling pathways, abnormal epigenetic post-translational modiﬁcations,
and immune and inﬂammatory aspects. Preliminary evidence has been acquired at the
animal level. However, epigenetic networks are intricate and often interact in a cascade
fashion. Abnormalities in transcription and translation exacerbate abnormal neuronal
function in ASD, further affecting synaptic transmission and plasticity, and dysregulation of
the gut ﬂora affects peripheral immune response function also inﬂuences brain dysfunction.
Affects the formation and activity of neural circuits; conversely, modiﬁed neural activity
can inﬂuence further transcription factors or chromatin remodeling by transmitting trigger
signals and initiating action potentials for speciﬁc transcriptional programs. Future research
is needed to further elucidate the underlying pathogenesis of ASD in depth.

4.1. Activity-Dependent Gene Transcription

MECP2 is a transcriptional repressor whose deletion increases global transcriptional
levels and alters chromatin structure [170]. MeCP2 is involved in neuronal activity by
phosphorylating and dissociating nuclear receptor co-chaperones at S86, S274, and T308.
Notably, MECP2 binds to chromatin and transcriptional activators at activated target pro-
moters to activate gene expression, implying that MECP2 may act as both a transcriptional
activator and a repressor. Activity-dependent neuroprotective proteins directly encode
transcription factors that bind and regulate the DAT transcriptional activator ZFP161 and
the transcriptional repressor FMR1 [171]. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) is an active
regulatory transcription factor that regulates ASD-related genes such as Protocadherin 10,
UBE3A, and BDNF. Mutations in the gene encoding UBE3A occur on chromosome 15q11
in patients with Angelman syndrome and some ASD patients [172]. T-box brain 1 is a

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

16 of 40

neuron-speciﬁc transcription factor that is necessary for activity-dependent Grin2b ex-
pression, and the loss of one copy alters the expression of netrin G1, contactin-2, and
Cadherin-8 (CDH8) [173].

4.2. mRNA Translation and Non-Coding RNA

Fragile X syndrome mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA binding protein
that is abundant in the brain and regulates a large number of mRNAs. FMRP was found to
selectively bind 4% of mRNAs in the mammalian brain [174,175]. The most characteristic
motifs in FMRP are those that interact with RNA: two hnRNP-K-homology (KH) domains
and an arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG box) [176]. In vitro, the RGG box identiﬁes the STEM-
G-Quartet loop in RNA, and similar G-Quartet structures have been discovered in various
FMRPs. MAP1B, a microtubule-associated protein critical for axon formation, is encoded
by FMRP ligand mRNAs with G-quartets. It has been shown that FMRP can bind to
structured G-rich regions, which include typical G-quartets. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation
element binding proteins 1–4 (CPEB1–4) are RNA binding proteins that inhibit or activate
translation of mRNAs with CPE sequences in their 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) by
inducing cytoplasmic shortening or lengthening of their poly(A) tails [177,178]. CPEBs
are involved in learning and memory by regulating embryonic development and synaptic
plasticity [179]. In the brains of individuals with idiopathic ASD, CPEB4 protein levels
are reduced but transcript levels are elevated, disrupting the auto amplifying loop that
regulates CPEB4 levels [178], consistent with CPEB4 binding to its own transcripts. CPEB1
deletion rescues the fragile X-like phenotype of FMR1 knockout (KO) mice.

Most of the existing research into whole-genome linkage has focused on protein-
coding regions, ignoring noncoding RNAs, which are considered nonclassical epige-
netic pathways because they primarily target transcripts and rarely interact directly with
DNA [180]. Post-transcriptional regulation of noncoding RNAs includes short noncoding
RNAs (miRNAs) and long-stranded noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). miRNAs regulate the
expression of most genes by blocking protein synthesis or increasing mRNA degradation at
the post-transcriptional level [181]. Preliminary assessments have shown that 28 miRNAs
are markedly changed in postmortem cerebellar cortical tissue of ASD patients. Intrigu-
ingly, differential expression of miRNAs predicted targets and identiﬁed additional genes
related to neurobiology, cell cycle, and cell signaling. In animal studies, knockout miR-137
heterozygous mice exhibited repetitive and social behavior deﬁcits [182]. The miRNA
expression proﬁles in the cerebellums of MECP2 knockout mice revealed downregulation
of miRNA subsets [183], consistent with the ﬁnding that miR-132 targets MECP2 and BDNF
in vitro and is downregulated in the cortex of MECP2 knockout mice. Thus, regulatory
loops including BDNF, miR-132, and MECP2 may be involved in ASD. Furthermore, con-
sidering miRNAs can regulate gene activity without integrating into the host genome,
targeting miRNAs is a promising strategy for ASD treatment [184].

LncRNAs have been demonstrated at high levels of expression in the central nervous
system (CNS). CNS cells have high levels of lncRNA expression, with 5458 out of a total
of 9747 lncRNA transcripts detected.
lncRNAs can be transcriptionally regulated by
isolating splicing factors or by regulating the distribution and phosphorylation of splicing
factors in splice sites [185]. Recent research has identiﬁed that metastasis-associated lung
adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) affects the expression of neuronal synaptogenesis
genes by modulating serine/arginine splicing factors [186,187]. LncRNAs are capable
of regulating RNA translocation, translation, and degradation as well [188]. To date,
two studies have examined changes in regulatory lncRNAs in ASD brain tissue [189].
The researchers discovered that the expression of 222 lncRNAs differed between ASD
patients and controls. The prefrontal cortex and cerebellum were related to 82 and 143
of the 222 lncRNAs, respectively. The ﬁnding is important in the context of autistic brain
imaging studies, which also found that the number of lncRNAs differentially expressed
in control brains was much greater than the number of lncRNAs differentially expressed
in autistic brains (1375 lncRNAs and 236 lncRNAs, respectively) indicating that there

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

17 of 40

are fewer specialized regions in the brains of patients with autism than in the brains of
healthy subjects [190,191]. Parikshak and colleagues then conducted a larger sample study
to examine lncRNA, splicing, and regional gene expression patterns in autism through
postmortem genome-wide transcriptome analysis [189]. They examined 251 postmortem
frontal and cerebellar regions enriched in autism risk genes in the postmortem frontal and
temporal cortices and cerebellum. The results suggest that lncRNA dysregulation is an
integral part of the ASD transcriptome signature.

4.3. Synaptic Signaling Pathway

Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway has long been associated with
neuronal overgrowth, and its changes are considered to be pleiotropic in the etiology of
autism [192]. Molecular, biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral abnormalities
related to an autism-like phenotype were observed in various Wnt signaling pathway-
related knockout mice models [193]. Wnt signaling has two main pathways: (1) β-linked
protein-dependent stable “canonical” signaling and (2) β-linked protein non-dependent
“non-canonical” signaling. Signiﬁcantly, many of the key protein signaling pathways in
both are localized at the synapse and have a crucial role in synaptic maturation [194].

Typical Wnt signaling indirectly acts on β-linked proteins to enhance their stability
and translocate them out of the cell surface to the nucleus, thus transducing extracellular
signals with downstream transcriptional mechanisms regulating nuclear gene expression.
Several ASD-related genetic mutations are connected to dysregulation of the traditional
Wnt/-linked protein pathway via the interaction of the CHD8 and beta-catenin [9]. On the
one hand, CDH8 is a negative regulator of autism [195], and CDH8 involves in the classical
Wnt signaling pathway by directly binding to β-catenin or being recruited to the promoter
regions of β-catenin-responsive genes [193]. Free cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated
by GSK3β resulting in degradation by the proteasome [192]. Several studies have also
found that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are involved in Wnt signaling by
regulating normal brain growth together with β-catenin [192]. PTEN haploinsufﬁcient
mice have brain overgrowth and enhanced β-linked protein signaling, emphasizing the
role of PTEN and β-catenin signaling in regulating a role in normal brain growth

PI3K-AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. PI3K-AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly
associated with autism and various neurodegenerative diseases [196]. The PI3K-AKT/
mTOR signaling pathway is primarily regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3K) and
its downstream serine/threonine protein B (PKB; also known as AKT), as well as the
mammalian/mechanical target of rapamycin (mTOR) [197,198]. The PI3K-AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway is stimulated by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and cytokine receptor
activation [199,200]. The PI3K-AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is primarily engaged in
synaptogenesis, corticogenesis, and related neuronal regulatory processes [201].

Studies have identiﬁed a mutated PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in nearly 50% of kids
with brain malformations and delayed development/autism [202]. The AKT/mTOR
pathway is a biological substrate for autism, and mutations in the AKT/mTOR gene
cascade lead to an increase in autism-like behaviors by regulating translation to dendritic
spines. Further studies have found that decreased mTOR affects advanced cognitive and
behavioral cortical circuits leading to an autistic phenotype [203].

PTEN activation contributes to axon elongation and proper localization. PTEN in-
hibition stimulates neurite growth [204,205]. When the neurite reaches the target region,
the growth cone collapses and recruits PTEN back to the surrounding region, where it
mediates collapse in response to chemotactic agents. In the CNS, mTOR is involved in
synaptic plasticity, cell growth, migration, neuronal development, memory storage, and
protein synthesis [206,207]. Aberrant expression of PI3K/AKT in neurons results in ele-
vated levels of reactive oxygen species, membrane depolarization, mitochondrial instability,
neuronal apoptosis, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production [208]. The
non-phosphorylated form of EIF4E protein-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) binds to eIF4E
to interfere with the formation of the eIF4F complex to block translation and mTORC1

release.
Importantly, eIF4E transgenic mice exhibit repetitive and stereotyped behav-
iors, abnormal social interactions or cognition, as well as a persistent pattern of ASD-like
behavioral impairment [209].

ERK/MAPK signaling. The ERK/MAPK pathway is intrinsically linked to autism
spectrum disorders and other disorders characterized by mental retardation. ERK is critical
in brain development and synaptic plasticity. ERK is activated when Ca2+ transients are
increased. The ERK activity is changed by mutations in ERK/MAPK pathway elements,
leading to a group of classic human syndromes called “Rasopathies” [210–212].

In the developing cerebral cortex, neuronal responding to neurotransmitters and RTK
ligands is dependent on the ERK/MAPK pathway [213]. Previous experimental results
found that damaged ERK in 16p11.2del mice resulted in brain volume reduction and dis-
rupted cortical cell structure in 16p11.2del mice. Inhibition of the Ras-ERK pathway partially
ameliorated the abnormal behavior of 16p11.2-deficient mice. RB1 and RB3 are two novel
cell-permeable peptides that significantly suppress Ras-ERK signaling during development to
rescue morphological damage in a severe Rasopathies mouse model [214,215].

Conditional deletion of the upstream kinase Map2k1/2 causes severe disruption of
neurons in layer V, as well as a signiﬁcant reduction in CTIP2 large neurons and a signiﬁcant
impairment of distant axonal extension of corticospinal projection neurons in layer V during
early development. CST neurons in layer V are also affected by ERK/MAPK signaling,
resulting in decreased axonal elongation and increased axonal branching. Furthermore,
ERK/MAPK signaling inhibition affects excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in
pyramidal neurons and changes intrinsic excitability in layers II/III and V [213]. Layer
Vcorticospinal neurons are highly susceptible to loss of ERK/MAPK signaling in the
neonatal period. The expression of plasticity-related proteins and intrinsic excitability
within neurons depends on ERK/MAPK signaling in multiple cortical layer [213] (Figure 2).

Figure 2. The Synaptic signaling pathway are mechanistically targeted. Wnt pathway activation
of cytoplasmic β-catenin is degraded by the proteasome after phosphorylation by GSK-3β. When
GSK-3β fails to phosphorylate β-catenin, cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus and binds
to the TCF/LEF complex and CHD8 factor to activate transcription of target genes and enhances
synaptic plasticity and neuronal protection. Both ERK/MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
pathways can be activated in response to TrKB stimulation Activation of L-type voltage-sensitive
calcium channels (LVSCCs) triggers calcium inward ﬂow and induces calcium-dependent signaling
molecules and the Ras/ERK pathway, which are involved in transcriptional regulation. Mutations in
proteins involved in translational regulation include PTEN, MECP2, UBE3A and TSC1/TSC2. These
genes are marked in red.

Epigenetic Post-Translational Modifications Methylation modification. DNA methylation performs an important role in maintain-ing genomic stability and regulating cellular function. A variety of functions have been demonstrated for DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation, including silencing re-petitive elements, changing transcription factor binding sites and chromatin accessibility, and directing the use of alternative promoters and splicing [216]. Initially, studies into ASD-related methylation were mainly focused at the genetic level. MBD of MECP2 acts as a reader for several forms of DNA methylation, interacts with multiple neurodevelopmentally relevant transcription factors, and disrupts critical links between cellular functions by regulating chromatin-structure-driven DNA methyla-tion [217]. In ASD patients, an enhanced combination of MECP2 with GAD1 and GAD2 promoters has been detected in the cerebellum and frontal cortex, resulting in reduced RELN and mRNA expression. Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is a strongly conserved G-pro-tein-coupled receptor. OXTR mRNA expression is affected by promoter methylation, and elevated levels of methylation are correlated with ASD [218,219]. This is consistent with enhanced OXTR promoter methylation found in adults with ASD. Thus, identification of highly specific DNA methylation could contribute to the prediction of transcriptional reg-ulation in autism [180] (Figure 3 right). Acetylation modification. Histone acetylation is closely related to synaptic function, neuronal excitability, and immune response genes in ASD [220]. In humans, 18 HDAC Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

Methylation modiﬁcation. DNA methylation performs an important role in maintain-
ing genomic stability and regulating cellular function. A variety of functions have been
demonstrated for DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation, including silencing repet-
itive elements, changing transcription factor binding sites and chromatin accessibility, and
directing the use of alternative promoters and splicing [216].

Initially, studies into ASD-related methylation were mainly focused at the genetic
level. MBD of MECP2 acts as a reader for several forms of DNA methylation, interacts with
multiple neurodevelopmentally relevant transcription factors, and disrupts critical links be-
tween cellular functions by regulating chromatin-structure-driven DNA methylation [217].
In ASD patients, an enhanced combination of MECP2 with GAD1 and GAD2 promoters
has been detected in the cerebellum and frontal cortex, resulting in reduced RELN and
mRNA expression. Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is a strongly conserved G-protein-coupled
receptor. OXTR mRNA expression is affected by promoter methylation, and elevated
levels of methylation are correlated with ASD [218,219]. This is consistent with enhanced
OXTR promoter methylation found in adults with ASD. Thus, identiﬁcation of highly
speciﬁc DNA methylation could contribute to the prediction of transcriptional regulation
in autism [180] (Figure 3 right).

Figure 3. Methylation and acetylation modiﬁcations associated with ASD. DNA methylation fre-
quently results in transcriptional repression or even gene silence in impacted genes. MECP2 binds to
methylated CpG sites in gene promoters and binds to chromatin silencing complexes, inhibiting gene
expression; protein modiﬁcations and chromatin remodeling in the acetylation group contribute to
transcriptional activation or inactivation and chromatin packaging.

Acetylation modiﬁcation. Histone acetylation is closely related to synaptic function,
neuronal excitability, and immune response genes in ASD [220]. In humans, 18 HDAC
enzymes have been identiﬁed, divided into the HDAC family and the Sir2 regulatory
family. HDAC and histone acetyltransferases cause pleiotropic downstream effects through
changes in acetylation levels, inducing cognitive dysfunction [221]. Knockout of the
forebrain excitatory neuron HDAC3 resulted in comparatively poor social skills in mature
wild-type mice [222]. HDAC2 upregulation in the PFC resulted in lower histone acetylation
levels in the SHANK3-deﬁcient mouse model. Acetylation group changes have also been
proven to inﬂuence social hormone receptors [223]. Inhibition of postnatal HDAC by
TSA or sodium butyrate caused enhanced histone acetylation of the oxytocin receptor
and the pressor V1a receptor gene promoters in the nucleus ambiguus, resulting in social

HDAC and histone acetyltransferases cause pleiotropic downstream effects through changes in acetylation levels, inducing cognitive dysfunction [221].

Inhibition of postnatal HDAC by TSA or sodium butyrate caused enhanced histone acetylation of the oxytocin receptor and the pressor V1a receptor gene promoters in the nucleus ambiguus, resulting in social pair bonding in male and female adult prairie voles [224]. A study demonstrated that PFC histone acetylation was decreased at term in crab-eating monkeys exposed to VPA before birth [225], in contrast to results found in rats following short-term suppression of prena-tal HDAC [226], indicating that the long-term consequences of HDAC inhibition during pregnancy may differ from the acute effects. A group-wide association analysis of histone acetylation found that 68% of patients with idiopathic ASD and duplication 15q syndrome had similar patterns of histone H3 acetylation on lysine 27 (H3K27ac), which is assumed to be a marker of active enhancers and promoters. In ASD patients, increased acetylation sites are concentrated in neuronal function areas and decreased acetylation sites in areas associated with immune function, with genes encoding HDACs (HDAC2 and HDAC4) in the frontal and temporal cortices [227] (Figure 3 left).  Figure 3. Methylation and acetylation modifications associated with ASD. DNA methylation fre-quently results in transcriptional repression or even gene silence in impacted genes.

Phosphorylation modification. Phosphorylation is the most abundant post-transla-tional modification (PTM) of proteins. Its importance is revealed by the space assigned to kinases in the genome. In the human genome, more than 500 kinase genes have been iden-tified [228]. Post-translational modifications of phosphorylation are widely involved in neurological disorders. Current research indicates that phosphorylation is closely related Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

pair bonding in male and female adult prairie voles [224]. A study demonstrated that
PFC histone acetylation was decreased at term in crab-eating monkeys exposed to VPA
before birth [225], in contrast to results found in rats following short-term suppression
of prenatal HDAC [226], indicating that the long-term consequences of HDAC inhibition
during pregnancy may differ from the acute effects. A group-wide association analysis of
histone acetylation found that 68% of patients with idiopathic ASD and duplication 15q

acetylation sites are concentrated in neuronal function areas and decreased acetylation
sites in areas associated with immune function, with genes encoding HDACs (HDAC2 and
HDAC4) in the frontal and temporal cortices [227] (Figure 3 left).

Phosphorylation modification. Phosphorylation is the most abundant post-translational
modiﬁcation (PTM) of proteins. Its importance is revealed by the space assigned to kinases
in the genome. In the human genome, more than 500 kinase genes have been identiﬁed [228].
Post-translational modiﬁcations of phosphorylation are widely involved in neurological
disorders. Current research indicates that phosphorylation is closely related to neurological
disorders such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism [229]. Recent studies on the
potential mechanisms of phosphorylation in models of autism are increasing. The GABAA
receptors of the β3 subunit (GABAAs) mediate sustained alterations in the inhibitory effects
of neurons associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Studies have shown that
mutating S408 and S409 of GABAAs to alanine enhances the plasma membrane stability
of GABARs to block the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of GABAARs, altering
the balance between phase inhibition and tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus [230,231].
Regulation of PTEN activity and function primarily involves phosphorylation of the PTEN
C-terminal cluster of serine and threonine residues. Several phosphorylation sites in
the C-terminal tail of the PTNE gene are required for the regulation of PTEN stability
and activity. Mice with PTEN deletion exhibited neuronal hypertrophy and morpholog-
ical changes, and PTEN-effective neurons displayed increased dendritic structures and
connectivity changes [232]. FMRP is a target of S6 kinase and PP2A phosphatase. Phospho-
rylated FMRP prevents translation by binding mRNA, ribosomes, and eIF4E1 [233]. FMRP
blocks translation by stimulating the excitatory postsynaptic membranes of pyramidal
hippocampal cells on mGluR receptors to control the efﬁciency of dendritic mRNA transla-
tion. Dephosphorylation disrupts the binding of FMRP to its targets, thereby activating
mRNA translation [234].

Ubiquitination modiﬁcation. Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the central mecha-
nism of protein degradation and turnover. The process is a reversible enzymatic cascade
reaction. The protein is labeled through a series of enzymatic reactions and then degraded
by covalently linking the K48 polyubiquitin chain to speciﬁc lysine residues of the target
protein by E3 ligase. Its degradation is inhibited by restoring the initial state by deubiq-
uitinating enzymes. In neurons, UPS is an essential mechanism for regulating excitatory
synaptic activity-dependent protein turnover and structural changes.

PSD scaffolding molecules, SHANK and the guanylate-kinase-associated protein
(GKAP) and PSD95-associated families, are the most highly ubiquitinated proteins in the
synapse, where protein levels are controlled bidirectionally by synaptic activity [235,236].
SHANK proteins are highly concentrated in the PSD, which interacts with GKAP and
PSD-95 family members. Altogether, these scaffolds support the structure of the PSD
and coordinate intracellular responses to extracellular and intracellular signal transduc-
tion enzymes by binding to multiple membrane receptors, including corticosteroids and
CAMKII78. USP8 controls SHANK3 and SHANK1 protein levels through de-ubiquitination,
which further comes to control dendritic spine density in neurons. In addition, knockdown
of USP8 in neurons blocks synaptic activity and alters SHANK3 protein levels [237]. The
UBE3A gene is closely associated with autism development. UBE3A is a HECT family
E3 ligase, and UBE3A targets XIAP for ubiquitination and degradation, subsequently in-
creasing the level of cystein 3 activation, leading to microtubule cleavage and eventual

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

21 of 40

contraction and removal of dendritic branching structures [238]. In the UBE3A ASD mouse
model, cortical neurons were signiﬁcantly reduced [239]. Several autism-related genes were
found to mediate synaptic elimination via the proteasomal degradation of the synaptic
scaffold PSD-95. For example, PSD-95 is ubiquitinated upon MEF2 activation by ubiquitin
E3 ligase MDM2 and then combined with Pcdh10, which attaches it to the proteasome
for degradation.

SUMOylation modiﬁcation. SUMOylation is a PTM involved in many cellular sig-
naling pathways. It consists of small ubiquitin-like modiﬁer (SUMO) proteins that bind
covalently to speciﬁc lysine residues of substrate proteins to exert biological functions [240].
In neurons, SUMOylation is a critical transcription regulator and serves an essential role in
synaptic function and neuroprotective responses to severe stress.

SUMOylation regulates widespread neurodevelopmental processes [241,242]. The
SUMO system in the developing rat brain was shown to be spatiotemporally regulated, and
SUMOylation is regulated by neuronal activity and activation of mGlu5R [243]. SUMOyla-
tion also affects various aspects of neurological function, including neurotransmitter release,
spinogenesis, and synaptic communication. SUMOylation of Synla at K687 was found to
enhance synaptic association with the synaptic vesicle to promote efﬁcient reassembly of
synapses and maintain its presynaptic localization after neuronal stimulation. The A548T
mutation in Synla damages its own SUMOylation, which may explain the abnormal pheno-
type of epilepsy and ASD associated with this mutation. FMRP is a substrate of the SUMO
pathway in the brain, and FMRP SUMOylation functions through the activation of mGlu5R
and is necessary to maintain the shape of mRNA particles in dendrites and to control spine
density and maturation [243].

Sequencing of the whole exome of ASD patients identiﬁed a novel heterozygous
protein truncation mutation in the Sentrin-speciﬁc peptidase 1 (SENP1) gene in individual
autism patients. Pure mutations in the SENP1 gene are associated with severe neurological
disorders, and SENP1 plays a key role in de-SUMOylation. Research has demonstrated that
SENP1 haplotype deﬁcient mice (Senp1+/−) exhibit social behavior deﬁcits and increased
stereotypic behavior. Interestingly, inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission was
altered in layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the postsplenial granule-free (RSA) cortices of
Senp1+/− mice. Mechanistically, SENP1 deﬁciency resulted in excessive SUMOylation
and degradation of FMRP in the RSA [244]. Thus, SENP1 acts as a possible candidate gene
for ASD dominance, serving as a circuit node involved in regulating mammalian social
behavior (Figure 4).

4.5. Immunology and Neuroinﬂammation

Microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis comprises the whole gut microbiota, the
enteric nervous system (ENS), the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, and
the central nervous system. These structures interact functionally with the endocrine and
immune systems through the involvement of cytokines, neuropeptides, and many other
signaling molecules. It has been demonstrated that there is bidirectional communication of
interactions between distinct linkages in the microbiota-gut-brain axis [245]. The micro-
biota has a direct impact on various aspects of nervous system function, including brain
activity, blood-brain barrier permeability, neurogenesis synthesis, and non-transmitter
excretion. The CNS has a substantial effect on the gastrointestinal tract and its microbiota.
The nervous system regulates the secretion of intestinal peptides, gastric acid and mu-
cus, intestinal permeability and mucosal immunity, inﬂuencing the habitat of intestinal
microorganisms [246–248].

The gut, like the brain, contains an internal neuronal network called the ENS. The ENS
oversees controlling the body’s main immunological organ. When intestinal immune cells
are activated by infection, they provide responses to neurosensory circuits through efferent
neuroimmune inﬂammatory reﬂex pathways. Over the last decade, research has revealed
that ASD kids are more likely to develop gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. ASD Children
are four times more likely than neurotypical children to develop GI [249]. Emerging
studies have reported changes in the gut microbiota of ASD patients, with differences in
microbiota abundance [250,251]. ASD patients are more likely to exhibit increased intestinal
permeability, called “leaky gut” [252]. Germ-free mice colonized with intestinal bacteria
from a pediatric ASD cohort are adequate to induce features associated with the autism
phenotype. These mice’s brains also show alternative splicing of autism-associated genes.
In addition, all currently known animal models of ASD exhibit some disruption in gut
ﬂora [71,253,254]. For example, increased intestinal permeability and altered intestinal ﬂora
have been observed in MIA mice; SHNAK3 deletion alters intestinal function and the gut
microbiome [253,255]. The SHNAK3αβKO mice also exhibit alterations in gastrointestinal
morphology and differences in fecal ﬂora composition [255]. These mice also have higher
hepatic LPS levels, higher IL-6 levels, and activated astrocytes [71]. Research on ASD
animal models and ASD populations have shown that gut imbalance affects peripheral
immune responses and leads to immune cell dysfunction.

Neuroimmune disorders. The immune system consists of a set of molecules and cells
that interact closely with each other in tissues and organs. Adaptive immunity is crucial
in neurodevelopmental disorders. Early evidence suggested that the immune system
inﬂuences brain function in individuals with autism [256].

With the progressive understanding of neuroimmune, it has been found that neu-
roimmune crosstalk affects the connectivity of brain functions. Current studies suggest
that cytokines secreted by neurons and glial cells further inﬂuence synaptic growth [257].
Multiple studies have found that microglia and astrocytes interact with synapses through

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

23 of 40

surface ion channels, receptors, and transporter proteins in addition to inﬂammatory re-
sponses to regulate synaptic morphology and plasticity to maintain brain tremor sensation.
Impairments in synaptic pruning and synaptic transmission have been observed in CX3C
chemokine receptor 1 knockout mice. These defects may be due to increased IL-1β sig-
naling secreted by microglia. Similarly, in fragile X syndrome mice, enhanced neuronal
excitability was reported, presumably due to astrocytes inﬂuencing synaptic function and
plasticity by regulating synaptic transmission via calcium signaling after glutamate uptake
via the glutamate transport proteins GLAST and GLT1 [258]. On the other hand, MET
and MHCI, as immune molecules and receptors, are closely associated with key functional
defects in brain development. MET indirectly leads to changes in neural circuitry and
function through negative regulation of immune responses and gastrointestinal homeosta-
sis. MHCI molecules regulate synaptic pre- and postsynaptic areas related to glutamate
homeostasis as well as axonal and synaptic development. In conclusion, dysregulation
of the immunomodulatory signaling molecule crosstalk is critical in the pathogenesis of
neuropsychiatric disorders like autism.

4.6. Internal Neural Loops in the Brain

Abnormal brain development in ASD patients is concentrated in the cerebral cortex,
striatum, amygdala, and cerebellum. Recent studies have found that reduced excitatory
synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex causes autistic-like
behaviors. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) inﬂuences social behavior and neurally
encodes spatial information [259]. Related reports also suggest that abnormal connections
between the striatum and the cerebral cortex cause repetitive behaviors in autistic chil-
dren [31,260]. In early assessments of autism, amygdala exhibits decreased volume and
increased neuronal density, which is related to the modulation of critical functions in fear
conditioning, anxiety, and social behavior [261]. The cerebellum is involved in the control
of motor behavior, and most ASD patients have movement disorders as comorbidities.
Furthermore, new research has revealed that cerebellar anomalies play a signiﬁcant role in
the onset of autism. A signiﬁcant reduction of Purkinje cells was observed in the anatomy
of autistic patients. Knockdown of the critical molecular signals such as TSC1, TSC2,
and Bmal1 in the PC of the cerebellum causes altered core behaviors in ASD [262,263].
Kelly et al. identiﬁed a novel inhibitory circuit between the cerebellar nucleus, ventral
thalamus, and MPFC involving the cerebellar cortical region right CRUS 1 (RCRUS1).
Disruption of this circuit led to social deﬁciencies and repeated behaviors. In the large
and complex neural network affecting social behavior, the PFC and its large number of
reciprocal circuit connections constitute a top-down system that controls the norms of social
behavior [264]. The continuous reﬁnement of this system offers the potential for ﬁnding
neuromodulatory targets for ASD therapy.

5. Targeting Molecules in Neural Circuitry May Be the Prospect of Autism Spectrum
Disorder Treatment

Autism treatments are now classiﬁed as nonpharmacological or pharmacological.
Although nonpharmacological therapy methods show some promising results, their thera-
peutic beneﬁts are limited. Current medications address some of the common symptoms of
ASD, however they are ineffective for the core symptoms, which include impaired commu-
nication and social interaction, as well as the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors.
Based on the overlay of multiple complex etiological mechanisms in autism, combining
novel drug development therapies with behavioral interventions may have a signiﬁcant
impact on individuals with autism in the future. Currently, the lack of appropriate regional
and molecular targets in the study of new drugs for autism makes the discovery of new
drugs for the treatment of autism the most innovative task (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Potential therapy strategies for autism spectrum diseases. The small gray circles represent
components of current ASD treatment strategies. Pharmacological treatments, nonpharmacological
treatments, cellular and exosomal therapies, gene therapy, and potential emerging therapeutics are all
covered. The large blue circles represent the beneﬁts and drawbacks of various ASD therapy options
for speciﬁc symptoms. Speciﬁc developments in emerging treatment methods are also discussed.

5.1. Nonpharmacological Therapies

The prevalence of ASD has increased year by year and available clinical medica-
tions have become scarce, nonpharmacological treatments including educational interven-
tions, behavioral modiﬁcation primary measures supplemented by music therapy, and
brain stimulation have been used to improve social skills and enhance the life ability of
ASD patients.

Behavioral psychological treatments.

In young children with autism, behavioral
psychological treatments are preferred. Music treatment, cognitive and social behavioral
therapy, which are currently widely used, have demonstrated some improvement in social
interaction in verbal language communication in people with autism [265]. Music treatment
in the early neurodevelopmental stage can achieve the integration of cortical and subcortical
regions by altering cortical structures and functional connections. Cognitive behavioral

The small gray circles represent components of current ASD treatment strategies. Pharmacological treatments, nonpharmacological treatments, cellular and exosomal therapies, gene therapy, and potential emerging therapeutics are all covered. The large blue circles represent the benefits and drawbacks of various ASD therapy options for specific symptoms. Specific developments in emerging treatment methods are also dis-cussed. 5.1. Nonpharmacological Therapies The prevalence of ASD has increased year by year and available clinical medications have become scarce, nonpharmacological treatments including educational interventions, behavioral modification primary measures supplemented by music therapy, and brain stimulation have been used to improve social skills and enhance the life ability of ASD patients. Behavioral psychological treatments. In young children with autism, behavioral psy-chological treatments are preferred. Music treatment, cognitive and social behavioral ther-apy, which are currently widely used, have demonstrated some improvement in social Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

therapy (CBT) has advantages for treating core symptoms and comorbidities, such as
anxiety and depression in ASD patients because of its highly organized and predictable
character. Social behavioral therapy (SBT) focuses on developing functional independence
in individuals with ASD via emotional regulation, social skills, and communication [266].
Non-invasive brain stimulation. Non-invasive brain stimulation is a novel therapeutic
approach. It modulates local cortical excitability, which inﬂuences cell excitability and
synaptic plasticity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) are the two major components of the method.
tDCS is primarily
performed in the brain using a continuous current delivered by scalp electrodes. In TMS, a
ﬂuctuating extracranial magnetic ﬁeld induces intracranial currents in the brain. Children
and adults accept both strategies well [267]. Recent studies have shown improvements in
social behavior and cognition in ASD patients treated with TMS or tDCS [268,269].

Dietary supplement therapy. Research studies have reported that certain vitamins
(e.g., vitamin B6, B12 and D; folic acid) [270,271], omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) [272], probiotics [273], and certain chemicals from plants (e.g., lignans and radi-
cicicol) have an effect on reducing hyperhomocysteinemia and gastrointestinal problems,
as well as improve ASD symptoms. Several studies have also reported positive results
linked with general dietary treatments, such as gluten-free and casein-free diets, which
are thought to improve GI function, reduce gut ﬂora dysbiosis, and improve some ASD
behavioral symptoms [274]. However, the efﬁcacy and safety of such dietary therapies
need to be conﬁrmed by further investigations.

In conclusion, nonpharmacological therapies can partially alleviate symptoms of
autism. Despite the absence of sufﬁcient data, the therapeutic effects of behavioral and
psychological treatments, brain stimulation, and dietary therapies for individuals with
autism appear to have a theoretical basis in neurobiochemistry and signal transduction.

5.2. Pharmacological Therapies

To date, no drugs are available to treat the core defects in patients with ASD,
and currently pharmacological therapies are only used to address adverse adaptive behav-
iors and comorbidities such as sleep and anxiety that cannot be controlled by
behavioral therapy [275].

Aripiprazole and risperidone are currently approved for the treatment of ASD and
they can alleviate people with ASD with their self-aggressive, irritable behavior [276].
Aripiprazole was observed to reduce self-aggression, irritability, and repetitive stereotypic
behaviors in two short-term randomized controlled studies. However, common side effects
were sedation, tremor, salivation, and weight gain. Risperidone was shown to be effective
and well tolerated in the short- and long-term treatment and discontinuation phases, with
one in three children/adolescents with ASD showing behavioral improvement. Risperidone
treatment can lead to weight gain [277]. Because of the Hyperhydroxytryptophanemia
frequently observed in children with ASD, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
have been used to treat anxiety and depression and alleviate social defects by blocking 5-HT
reuptake and increasing the amount of 5-HT in synaptic cleft in children with ASD [278,279].
Guanfacine, is used to treat ADHD and disruptive behavior [280]. In addition, melatonin
can reduce sleep-related problems in children with ASD and can also improve symptoms
such as pain, depression, anxiety, depression, and gastrointestinal dysfunction with few
adverse effects [281,282]. Thus, melatonin or its derivatives may become the most promising
drugs therapies to improve behavioral disorders in autism patient.

5.3. Cell Therapies

Cellular therapies, notably bone marrow hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem
cell transplantation, have seen increasing use in the treatment of neurological problems.
Hematopoietic stem-cell therapy can prolong the life of children with ASD by preventing
neurodegeneration [283]. Stem cells reduce the pro-inﬂammatory state by synthesizing
and releasing chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors, which inﬂuence the expression

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

26 of 40

of inﬂammatory markers in the blood of children with ASD [284]. Moreover, stem cells can
induce the recruitment and differentiation of native stem cells. Twelve months after single
intravenous infusions of autologous cord blood were administered to each of 25 children
with ASD, their electroencephalography (EEG) spectra showed signiﬁcant changes includ-
ing increases in alpha and beta power and a decrease in EEG theta power, accompanied by
an improvement in the patients’ social communication skills and ASD symptoms [285,286].
Fetal stem-cell transplantation by intravenous and subcutaneous injections in ASD patients
(3–15 years old) improved social skills in the treatment group with no adverse effects. In
37 children with ASD, the transplant group showed a reduction in stereotypic and agitated
behavior, and higher scores on the autism rating scale. Several interventional clinical trials
evaluating the impact of stem-cell therapy on children with ASD are underway.

5.4. Neurotransmitter Manipulations

E/I imbalance is a key reason for the pathogenesis of ASD patients, and modulators
targeting GABA and glutamate receptors have been developed in order to restore the E/I
balance [287]. In mice models of autism induced by mGluR5 overactivity, mGluR5 antago-
nists have been applied to treat social deﬁcits, learning memory deﬁcits, repetitive stereo-
typic behavior, and dendritic spine abnormalities [288]. Unfortunately, large-scale patient
studies on mGluR5 inhibitors for fragile X syndrome have reported negative results [289].
NMDAR agonists mainly correct the aberrant transmission of excitatory synaptic signals,
and were observed to rescue some of the impaired social competence in Shank2 transgenic
mice [290]. Memantine, one of the NMDARs, can improve stereotypic behavior and social
deﬁcits [291]. Other NMDA-modulating drugs such as d-cycloserine, ketamine, and rilu-
zole have shown negative results [292,293]. A larger sample size of studies is required to
conﬁrm the therapeutic effect of these drugs. GABAR agonists correct abnormal GABA-
mediated synaptic transmission, which helps to alleviate some of the social deﬁcits shown
in animals with fragile X syndrome [294]. Abaclofen inhibits glutamate release to affect
the phenotype of protein synthesis and reverse synaptic abnormalities [295]. Two-phase
clinical trials have already suggested that abaclofen can improve ASD symptoms [296].
Bumetanide, an NKKCC1 chloride input inhibitor, enhances individual ASD behavioral
features by increasing GABAergic inhibition caused by decreasing chlorine ion levels.
Follow-up data demonstrated that bumetanide improves symptoms in ASD patients [297].

5.5. Targeted Translation and Epigenetic Regulation

Studies in transcriptional and translational levels provide a scientiﬁc basis for dis-
covering potential mechanistic drug targets. TSC patients have been treated with mTOR
inhibitors for behavioral and molecular abnormalities [298]. Preliminary studies have
shown that IGF-1 increases synaptic protein levels and changes dendritic spine density
and excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical area via activating the MAPK and mTOR
pathways. IGF-1 has been found in clinical studies to be beneﬁcial in the treatment of ASD
patient. PPAR γ agonists activate Dickkopf-1 activity, inhibit the Wnt/-Catenin pathway,
and improve behavioral deﬁcits. In terms of epigenetic regulation, numerous autism risk
genes are engaged in abnormal epigenetic post-translational modiﬁcations. Therapeutic
strategies for epigenetic enzymes focus on therapies targeting enzymes at different stages
of the post-translational modiﬁcation process, resulting in modest improvement in autistic
mouse behavior. Studies using SHANK3 mutant mouse models have found that histone
methyltransferases and histone acetylase inhibitors, alone or in combination, signiﬁcantly
improve synaptic dysfunction and social interaction [299–301].

5.6. Other Biological Targets

Animal studies back up the neuropeptide theory of autism. Oxytocin (OXT), as a
neuropeptide, plays an important role in many physiological processes. It affects social be-
havior by regulating neuronal plasticity [302]. OXT plasma levels have been reported to be
altered in autistic patient, and they are frequently related to dysfunctional connectivity [303].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

27 of 40

Animal studies have indicated that OXT treatment can rescue autism-associated social
deﬁcits [304]. Evidence supported that oxytocin administration reduces some dysfunc-
tional behaviors associated with autism, including social performance, anxiety behaviors
etc. The arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a member of the same superfamily as OXT. Blinded
clinical trials have shown that intranasal AVP in children can improve defects in social
competency, and it has been used as a target for ASD drug treatment [305,306]. Several
studies have found that opioid antagonists can reduce self-aggression, ADHD, and agitated
behavior in people with autism. However, the evidence is lacking that they can improve
core autism symptoms in most participants. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that acts
on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-Y, a nuclear hormone receptor).
Pioglitazone has also been shown to reduce NMDA-mediated Ca2+ currents and transients.
Two clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of pioglitazone to improve behavioral
symptoms of ASD [307].

6. Conclusions and Future Perspectives

Although the incidence of ASD is increasing, there is no physical or pharmacological
treatment for ASD, and the etiology is highly complicated, involving genetic mutations,
maternal immune activation, and environmental triggers. Ultimately, molecular signaling
pathways, neuronal synapses, epigenetic post-translational modiﬁcations, immune activa-
tion, and connectivity abnormalities in brain function are induced. Thus, different animal
models both increase our understanding of genetic and environmental factors underlying
the onset of ASD and offer new potential ideas for treatment. Here, we explore recent
advances in pathological studies of different animal models to cause ASD-like behavior
in experimental animals by ameliorating or reversing neuronal damage caused by ge-
netic, inﬂammatory, and prenatal drug exposure. Multidimensional analysis of behavioral
characteristics and neuropathological alterations in autistic mice and autistic populations
attempts to connect animal studies to ASD patients. We can use the data from animal
studies on ASD symptoms to explore abnormalities at the biomolecular level in models of
autism to ﬁnd relationships with behavioral regulation and further discover key molecular
targets for signaling pathways. So far, some of the available treatments, including drugs
and non-drugs appear to relieve some of common symptoms but are ineffective in treating
the core symptoms of ASD. In the search for the ultimate intervention to improve ASD
treatment, the development of effective therapies still require a further in-depth study of
the disease’s core defects and normalization of its pathophysiology.

Autism is a behavior-based disorder. While diagnostic criteria strive to maximize
clinical consensus, multilevel analyses do not always reﬂect its extensive inter- and intra-
individual heterogeneity. Given the heterogeneity of ASD, no single model can generalize
all symptoms. By manipulating non-human primate genome alterations to mimic the
pathological process of ASD, in-depth mechanistic studies are extremely important for
clinical translation. Hundreds of genes have been deﬁned in genetic studies as risk factors
for development of autism. While the functions of many genes remain obscure, the proteins
encoded by the genes found so far participate in three common pathways: translational
regulation, transcriptional/epigenetic regulation, and synaptic development/plasticity
regulation. New developments in gene therapy, such as gene replacement, CRISPR-Cas9
gene editing, oligonucleotide translation, etc., have to some extent fueled the development
of gene therapy as a new strategy for personalized treatment [308]. Attention to potential
links between biochemical molecular systems, neural circuits, and environmental variables
is necessary to optimize therapeutic approaches for autism. Multiple clinical disorders
frequently coexist in autism, however, current research has paid inadequate attention to
relevant comorbidities. The search for potential biomarkers should be combined with
assessment of the presence or absence of speciﬁc comorbidities when designing experi-
ments related to speciﬁc clinical syndromes. These should be combined with large-scale
population-based cohort studies to identify the dynamic spatial and temporal links between
behavior, development, and comorbidity types. In conclusion, the study of ASD remains

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1819

challenging, and mechanistic treatments of these disorders will only succeed when the
heterogeneity of neurodevelopmental disorders is incorporated into precision medicine
through multidisciplinary integration.
