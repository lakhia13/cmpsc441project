Background: The prevalence of mental
illness continues to increase in China, but
research on stigma is still in its infancy, and there are even fewer studies on stigma among
nurses. A comprehensive, effective and reliable tool is needed to assess stigma in nursing
so that it can be reduced or eliminated to improve nursing quality. This study aimed to
translate a 20-item scale for assessing the stigma of mental illness in nursing into Chinese
and evaluate its reliability and validity.

Methods: An improved Brislin translation model was used to translate the nursing
mental
illness stigma assessment scale into Chinese. Content and face validity were
determined by a panel of experts. A convenience sample of 501 nursing students was
chosen. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis, concurrent validity and known group comparison
were used to evaluate the scale’s structural validity. The reliability was evaluated based
on the internal consistency reliability and 2-week retest reliability.

Results: The content validity index was 0.90. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis showed
that this study supported the three-factor model. The moderate correlation between
the Chinese version of the Scale for Assessing the Stigma of Mental Illness in Nursing
and the Perceived Devaluation Discrimination Scale suggested acceptable concurrent
validity. Cronbach’s α (0.863) and the retest coefﬁcient (0.839) were indicative of
internal consistency.

Conclusion: The Chinese version of the Scale for Assessing the Stigma of Mental Illness
in Nursing has acceptable concurrent validity, marginal factor validity, and satisfactory
reliability in China. Therefore, the three-factor structure of the Chinese scale should
be considered.

Relevance to Clinical Practice: The Chinese version of the Scale for Assessing the
Stigma of Mental Illness in Nursing can be used to understand the degree of mental
illness stigma in nursing.

INTRODUCTION

Stigma, a concept ﬁrst proposed in 1963 by sociologist Goﬀman,
is deﬁned by him as follows: “the situation of the individual
who is disqualiﬁed from full social acceptance” (1). Mental illness
stigma, which is mainly produced in response to the abnormal
behavior of people with mental illness, is an exclusionary attitude
and leads to patients with mental disease patients feeling shame,
inferiority and emotional distress (2, 3). Studies have shown that
stigma negatively aﬀects empowerment, social inclusion, quality
of life, help seeking behaviors and adherence to treatment in
people with mental illness (4, 5). Nursing staﬀ, who have close
contact with patients in the treatment of mental illness, can
also discriminate against patients, stereotyping those with mental
illness as incompetent, unpredictable, destructive, and violent,
which undermines nursing quality (6, 7). This stigma can lead to
a decline in the quality of nursing, and patients may experience
isolation, abuse in healthcare, diagnostic overshadowing and
exclusion (8, 9). It can also hinder the rehabilitation and social
integration of patients with mental disorders and reduce the
treatment eﬀect in patients (10). Associated stigma may also
aﬀect nursing staﬀ (11), leading them to perpetuate the cycle
of exclusion in their clinical practice (12) or even to act in
an extreme way (13). Stigma also aﬀects nursing staﬀs’
job
satisfaction, interpersonal relationships, patient self-stigma, and
nursing staﬀ ’ professional identity (14). Correct assessment of
nurses’ stigma toward mental illness and eﬀective adjustment
to reduce and weaken this stigma can promote the recovery of
patients and improve their clinical symptoms (15).

BACKGROUND

The World Health Organization reported in 2014 that one out of
every four people may suﬀer from mental illness (16). Globally,
an estimated 264 million people suﬀer from depression, 45
million suﬀer from bipolar disorder, and more than 20 million
suﬀer from schizophrenia (17). In China, the number of people
with mental illness is on the rise, with the prevalence rising from
3.2% in the 1970s to 15.56% (18). According to one study, China
registered 4.3 million severely mentally ill patients in 2014 (19)
while another study showed that in 2013, the number of such
patients reached 16 million (20). Eight million were diagnosed
with schizophrenia in 2018 (21). Mental health has become a
prominent public health and social problem hindering China’s
economic development. At present, most of the research on
mental illness stigma focuses on measuring the degree of stigma
in the public and its related factors. Questionnaires used in
these studies included the Struening Devaluation Scale (22) the
Mass Discrimination Scal (23), the Link Perceived Devaluation
Discrimination Scale (24) the Psychiatric Attitude Questionnaire
(25, 26), and the Attitude Style Questionnaire (27). The objects
of measurement of these questionnaires were the general public.
Some questionnaires were used to measure the self-stigma of
patients (28, 29) and the associated stigma of family members
(30, 31). Only in a few articles were nursing undergraduates
and doctors the objects of study (32, 33). There is no speciﬁc
assessment scale for caregivers. At the same time, since the three

Chinese Version Scale

principles of stigmatizing interventions (contact, education, and
protest) are now integrated into mental health programs (34,
35), it is particularly important to have reliable tools that can
objectively assess the eﬀectiveness of these interventions (36).
Based on the above situation, it is necessary for China to adopt
the Mental illness Stigma assessment scale for Chinese nurses and
verify its reliability and validity. Spanish scholars Dr. Sastre-Rus,
Meritxell et al. developed a new tool for assessing the stigma of
mental illness in nursing in 2020 (37). Therefore, the purpose of
this study was to translate and localize the new scale, which was
based on Peplau’s psychodynamic nursing theory, and to measure
its reliability and validity. The study was also to provide a way to
quickly and accurately measure the degree of stigma of mental
illness among nursing staﬀ in China.

METHODS

Study Design
This was a cross-sectional and observational survey designed to
test the reliability and validity of the new Chinese version of the
Scale for Assessing the Stigma of Mental Illness In Nursing tool,
also known as the SASMIN.

Setting
The participants in this research were senior college nursing
students from the Nursing College of Jinzhou Medical University
in China, and 501 students were recruited as volunteers.

Instruments
SASMIN
The SASMIN is a 20-item scale developed by Dr. Sastre-Rus,
Meritxell et al. to comprehensively assess the stigma of mental
illness among nurses. SASMIN includes three dimensions: Factor
1: Violence/Dangerousness (8 items), Factor 2: Disability (5
items), and Factor 3: Irresponsibility/Lack of Competence (7
items). Both positive and negative wording is used (items 2, 3,
5, 10, 13, and 15 are forward scored, with the rest of the items are
reverse scored). Each item is rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (5
= totally agree; 4 = somewhat agree; 3 = neutral; 2 = somewhat
disagree; 1 = totally disagree). The total and dimension scores
are the sum of the scores of each item, with the total score being
between 20 and 100. A higher score infers a weaker degree of
stigma. The original scale has acceptable internal consistency,
with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.825 for the overall scale and 0.626–
0.731 for the subscales.

Perceived Devaluation Discrimination
In this study, the Perceived Devaluation Discrimination (PDD)
Scale was used to assess criterion validity (24, 38). The
PDD mainly measures
the perceived disparagement and
discrimination mental patients and their family members receive
from the general public to evaluate the perceived stigma
of patients and their families. The scale also measures the
level of public and social perceptions of stigmatization and
discrimination against people with mental illness. The Chinese
version of the scale, which was translated and localized by Xu
Hui (39) in 2007, has been veriﬁed to have good reliability and

validity. This scale is a self-rating scale consisting of 2 dimensions
and 12 items. The author took the midpoint of 2.50 as the
standard and compared the average score with it. Those with
a score higher than 2.50 were considered to have stigma, while
those with a score lower than 2.50 were considered to have
no stigma.

Translation
We followed a modiﬁed Brislin translation model (40) consisting
of (A) forward translation, (B) back translation and (C) revision.
The English version of the scale was independently translated by
two nursing graduate students who were proﬁcient in English and
had passed the CET-6. The Chinese version was independently
translated into English by two nursing researchers with PhDs
who were not familiar with the original SASMIN and were
also proﬁcient in English. Finally, two other bilingual experts
were invited to perform a comparative analysis between the
two translated versions and the original scale, and the items
with large diﬀerences were re-translated and translated back.
After the development of the third version, 10 students were
recruited to conduct a pre-investigation on this version to ensure
the quality of the scale before the reliability and validity tests.
According to the subjects’ understanding of the contents of
the scale,
information about the time required to complete
the questionnaire, possible problems and suggestions, and
ambiguous and diﬃcult items was collected, and the researchers
continued to make timely modiﬁcations and adjustments to
produce the ﬁnal Chinese version of the SASMIN.

Data Collection
The researchers themselves distributed paper questionnaires to
nursing students at Jinzhou Medical University individually from
November to December 2020 and explained the content, purpose
and signiﬁcance of the questionnaires to the students before
issuing them, reminding them to ﬁll out the questionnaires
carefully. After obtaining informed consent from the students,
the questionnaires were distributed to the students on the spot,
and the students completed the questionnaires independently.
It
took 5–10 min to complete the questionnaires, and the
questionnaires were returned on the spot after completion.
The researchers checked whether there were omissions and
errors in the completed questionnaires and conﬁrmed or revised
the questionnaires with the students at once to ensure the
completeness and quality of the questionnaire completion. Then,
31 randomly selected students were invited to complete the
questionnaires again 2 weeks later to test the reliability of the
retest. The retest interval is generally 10–14 days (41), so this
interval was 14 days to ensure the reliability of the retest (41).

Ethical Considerations
Ethical approval
study was obtained from our
institutional ethics committee. The SASMIN scale was authorized
by the original author, and participants’ informed consent was
obtained. Data conﬁdentiality was ensured during the survey. All
the students signed a written informed consent form, and the
study data were kept in a completely conﬁdential way.

team consisting of 6 relevant experts

Statistical Analysis
EpiData data entry software was used to double check the data
entry, and SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 23.0 were used for statistical
analysis (IBM).
An expert

(1
psychological expert, 1 doctor of nursing, 2 clinical nursing
experts, and 2 nursing education experts) was invited to evaluate
the content validity of the SASMIN scale. They had been working
for 27 years on average. They rated each item with a four-point
Likert scale (1 = not relevant, 2 = weakly relevant, 3 = strongly
relevant, 4 = highly relevant). The content validity index (I-CVI)
for each project was calculated based on the percentage of
protocols rated 3 or 4 out of the total number. When the I-CVI
is ≥0.78, it indicates that the overall content validity of the scale
is good (42).

Descriptive analysis was used for the general information
of the participants, and conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA)
was conducted to investigate the underlying factor structure of
the translated scale. To conﬁrm the replicability of the ﬁrst-
order three-factor structure of the SASMIN (43), the following
indexes must be good: χ 2/DF, goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI),
adjusted goodness-of-ﬁt index (AGFI), incremental ﬁt index
(IFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and comparative ﬁt index (CFI).
Generally, χ 2/DF is required to be <3, while all of other
values are required to be >0.9, indicating good adaptability
of the model; however, a value >0.8 indicates that the model
the root mean square error of
is acceptable. In addition,
approximation (RMSEA) should be <0.08,
indicating good
adaptability and good model ﬁt.

By calculating the Cronbach’s α coeﬃcient, the retest reliability
and the revised item-total correlation, the internal consistency
reliability of the scale was tested. The minimum acceptable
Cronbach’s α coeﬃcient was set to 0.7 (44). The adjusted item-
total correlation represents the correlation between each item and
the sum of the other items in the scale, which is evaluated using
the standard of 0.3 (45).

Calibration correlation refers to using a recognized valid scale
as a standard to test the degree of correlation between the
measured scale and the standard scale. In this study, the PDD
scale was used as the calibration standard for evaluation. Pearson
correlation analysis was used to test the correlation between the
Chinese version of the SASMIN scale and the PDD scale. When
the correlation coeﬃcient r > 0.7, the validity of the test is high.
When 0.4 < r < 0.7, the validity of the test was moderate. When
r < 0.4, the validity of the test is low (46).

For the discriminant validity, according to the total score of
the SASMIN scale, the top 27% of scores were grouped as high
and the bottom 27% as low, and the scores of both groups were
analyzed using the two-tailed independent samples t-test. If the
scores of the two groups reached the level of signiﬁcance (P <
0.05), the discriminant validity was good.

To assess the degree of stigma, the total stigma score of each
participant was calculated and then converted to a Z-score in
the data (N = 501). The Z-score is also called the standard
score, which is the diﬀerence between an original score and the
mean divided by the standard deviation. Stigma was divided
into four grades, namely, severe stigma, moderate stigma, mild

stigma and no stigma, so each grade contained an interval of
1.5 standard deviations. A Z score below −1.5 is considered
to indicate that there is very high stigma. A Z score between
−1.5 and the mean is considered to indicate moderate stigma.
A Z score that is above average but below 1.5 is considered
to indicate mild stigma. Finally, a Z score higher than 1.5 is
classiﬁed as no stigma. Therefore, the standardized scores were
divided according to the principle that the higher the score is, the
weaker stigma.

RESULTS

Participant Characteristics
A total of 518 questionnaires were sent out, and 501 remained
after the invalid questionnaires were removed, for a recovery
rate of 96.72%. The respondents were college nursing students
aged 18–25 years, and the average age was 20.94 ± 1.368
years. According to the results of the survey, the majority of
respondents were female (442/501), which was mainly due to
the lack of male students in the nursing student population.
Eleven percent (55/501) of the students participated in mental
illness-related extracurricular or community activities in college,
34.3% (172/501) of the students had contact with patients with
mental illness, and 24.6% (123/501) of the students wanted
to become psychiatric nurses. The detailed results are shown
in Table 1.

Content Validity
The contents validity index (I-CVI) of the items ranged from
0.830 to 1.000, and the contents validity index (S-CVI) of the scale
was 0.975. Correlation analysis results showed that the scores of
each item were positively correlated with the total scores, and the
diﬀerences were statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.01).

Construct Validity Analysis
In the model ﬁtness index, the Chi-square degree of freedom
was 2.388, the adjusted GFI was 0.917, the incremental ﬁt index
(IFI) was 0.899, the TFI was 0.881, the CFI was 0.898, and the
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was 0.053,

which proved that the structural equation model of the Chinese
version of the scale was valid and the Chinese data ﬁt the original
three-dimensional structural model well. The standardized factor
load of each item was >0.5 (shown in Table 2), indicating that
each item could explain its dimension, except items 1 (a14) and 5
(a17). Item 1 is that people with a mental disorder area burden on
their family and society. Item 5 is that caring for a patient with a
mental disorder is no more burden than caring for other patients.
The standardized three-factor structural model of the SASMIN (n
= 501) is shown in Figure 1.

Criterion Validity
In this study, the Chinese version of the PDD scale was used as
the calibration scale to analyse its correlation with the total score
and the dimensions of the SASMIN scale. The results showed that
the total scores of the two scales was positively correlated (r =
0.401, P < 0.01). The signiﬁcant correlation coeﬃcients of the
diﬀerent dimensions and the PDD scale were 0.296, 0.306, and
0.355, respectively (P < 0.01).

Retest Reliability
The intragroup correlation coeﬃcient (ICC) was used to evaluate
the retest reliability of the scale. The sample size was 31, the
questionnaire recovery rate was 100%, the ICC value of the total
scale was 0.760, and the ICC values of each dimension were 0.766
(P < 0.000), 0.468 (P < 0.008), and 0.575 (P < 0.001).

Discriminant Validity
Discriminant validity is based on the total score of the SASMIN
scale, which was ranked from high to low; the top 27% of the
scores were grouped into the high-score group, and the bottom
27% of the scores were grouped into the low-score group. In this
study, the critical value scores were 52 and 63, respectively, and
the scores of each item in the 2 groups were analyzed by using a
two-tailed independent samples t-test. The results showed that
the score diﬀerence of each item in the 2 groups reached the
level of signiﬁcance (P < 0.05). The detailed results are shown
in Table 4.

The Degree of Stigma

was 62.884, SD = 8.938, and the means of each dimension were
23.916, SD = 5.008; 15.764, SD = 3.164; and 23.204, SD = 3.873.

DISCUSSION

This study was the ﬁrst to translate the SASMIN into Chinese
and test its reliability and validity. In the process of forming
the Chinese version of the SASMIN, we strictly implemented
the relevant process. Testing showed that the scale has good
structural validity, discriminant validity and reliability and that
it is reliable and eﬀective in assessing the degree of nursing
mental
illness stigma in China. It can be used to measure
nursing students’ stigma of mental illness and could provide a
reference for nursing educators for teaching plan formulation.
It can also be used as a tool for nursing managers to assess
nurses’ stigma of mental illness, develop timely measures and
interventions, improve nursing quality, and optimize nursing
services to achieve the purpose of nursing, namely, “promoting
patient health.”

The original Spanish scale was tested on students. The
subjects in this study were also nursing students, which were
from Jinzhou Medical University in northern China. These
students were about to become nursing workers, making them
a representative sample.

The content validity of the Chinese version assessed by six
nursing experts resulted in an S-CVI ranged from 0.830 to 1.000;
on average, the I-CVI was 0.975, so the scale items show good
content validity.

For the CFA, the results showed that most items had factor
loads higher than 0.5, except for items 1 and 5, which had
loads close to 0.3. This may be because nursing undergraduates
have not had in-depth contact with patients or have less contact
with patients with mental diseases. Most nursing undergraduates’
understanding of patients is inﬂuenced by the positive narration
of teachers and the negative narration of society or family, which
leads to the unstable attitude of nursing students toward mental
diseases. The IFI was 0.899, the TFI was 0.881, and the CFI was
0.898. These results showed that the current three-factor model
was within the acceptable range, although it did not achieve good
ﬁtting results. This was consistent with the results of the original
author, so the dimensions of the scale were maintained, and
further investigation will be conducted with a sample of clinical
nursing staﬀ to verify the results of this analysis.

We also chose the PDD scale for the assessment of the
concurrent validity index. The Chinese version of the PDD has
good validity and is widely used in China for measurement of
stigma in the general public. Therefore, the use of the PDD for the
concurrent validity index is justiﬁed. According to the Pearson
correlation analysis, the total correlation between the two scales
was 0.401, showing a moderate positive correlation.

According to the results on the degree of stigma, 47.21% of
the students had moderate or higher stigma regarding mental
illness, which indicated that the mental illness stigma of Chinese
nursing students was serious. This may be due to the fact,
shown in Table 1, that most nursing students (89%) did not

participate in activities related to mental illness, and 65.7% had no
contact with mentally ill people. They were therefore not familiar
with patients. The results in Table 1 also show that only 24.6%
of students were willing to be psychiatric nurses. Therefore,
nursing educators and administrators should be reminded to add
related academic training or lectures to actively guide nursing
students’ attitudes toward mental illness and help them establish
a correct mindset.

Limitations
However, several limitations should be taken into account when
interpreting the results of this study. First, the research subjects
were not nursing staﬀ but senior nursing students who were easy
to recruit. Therefore, the representativeness of the sample may
be somewhat lacking. Second, due to the self-report nature of the
survey, bias was inevitable. In addition, due to the lack of research
on this topic, it was diﬃcult to develop a proper discussion and
compare the results with previous studies. However, this also
highlights the novelty, interest, and readability of this study.

CONCLUSION

Following a rigorous translation and validation process, the
SASMIN demonstrated acceptable construct validity in terms of
concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and factorial validity
and acceptable internal consistency and test–retest reliability in
China. The results of this study also showed that nursing mental
illness stigma is prevalent in China, suggesting that measures
need to be established to reduce mental illness stigma in nursing
and improve the quality of care.

Relevance to Clinical Practice
The SASMIN can identify the degree of stigma associated with
mental illness among nursing staﬀ in China and can be used
as a tool by nursing managers to measure the degree of stigma
and improve quality of care and patient satisfaction. Nursing
educators should also take the measurement results of the scale
as a reference, adjust the curriculum in a timely manner, improve
the quality of education, and cultivate outstanding nursing talent.
