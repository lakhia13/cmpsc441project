Background: Adolescent mental health is a global concern, however, time trends and the COVID-19-related
restrictions vary across countries. This study examined changes in adolescent mental health and substance use
in Russia between 2002, 2015 and during the pandemic in 2021. Methods: Cross-sectional school-based surveys
of 12- to 18-year-olds were carried out in a Siberian city in 2002 (N = 713), 2015 (N = 840) and 2021 (N = 721)
using the Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire, data on tobacco, alcohol and drug use and socio-
demographic information. We examined the effect of cohort, gender, family composition and parental occu-
pation on mental health and substance use. Results: There were increases in emotional symptoms and inter-
nalising problems (B = 0.93, p < .001) and decreases in substance use over 19 years (B = -.73, p < .001).
Changes in adolescent mental health and substance use were substantial from 2002 to 2015 and nonsigniﬁcant
from 2015 to 2021. Increases in mental health problems were evident only among girls; a decrease in alcohol
use was larger among boys. Family composition and parental occupation did not account for these changes.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the mental health of Russian adolescent girls has worsened in the 21st
century; the gender gap in mental health has widened; the gender gap in alcohol use was reversed in 2021.
The ﬁndings highlight the need for research into gender-speciﬁc factors and for effective interventions. The
lack of changes in Russian adolescent mental health and substance use from 2015 to during the pandemic in
2021 suggests successful coping; however, more research is needed.

Key Practitioner Message

(cid:129) Research in western high-income countries has shown a substantial increase in adolescent depression and
anxiety over the past 30 years, especially among girls, and a decrease in adolescent substance use; the
COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased risk of adolescent mental health problems.

(cid:129) This study suggests that there were increases in Russian adolescent internalising problems and total difﬁcul-
ties, and decreases in substance use from 2002 to 2015, but no changes from 2015 to during the pandemic in
2021.
Future research is needed to understand the determinants of adolescents’ resilience and vulnerability dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic.

(cid:129)

(cid:129) The widening of the gender gap in adolescent mental health, with girls reporting more problems, and the
closing of the gender gap in substance use suggest the potential value of gender-speciﬁc interventions.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions
have led to unprecedented changes in everyday lives of
adolescents around the world. Social restrictions may be
particularly harmful for adolescents because peer rela-
tionships are pivotal for their well-being and health
(Blakemore & Mills, 2014). Accumulating evidence sug-
gests that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with
increased risk of adolescent mental health problems,

females
symptoms
Bhuiyan, 2021; Samji et al., 2022). However, this nega-
tive impact is by no means always the case. Thus, stud-
ies of Chinese adolescents and Hispanic/Latinx
adolescents from the United States found decreases in
internalising and total mental health problems during
and after the COVID-19-related lockdown (Penner, Ortiz,
& Sharp, 2021; Yang, Harrison, Huang, Liu, &
Zahn, 2021). Research also suggests that adolescent

substance use decreased during the COVID-19 pan-
demic, but the ﬁndings are inconsistent (Dumas, Ellis, &
Litt, 2020). There is evidence that an initial increase in
mental health problems may be followed by a decrease,
reaching pre-pandemic levels during the later stages
(Robinson, Sutin, Daly, & Jones, 2021). However, there
is currently not enough information to reliably describe
time trends in adolescent mental health during the pan-
demic.

The robust detection of changes associated with the
pandemic is only possible if comparable measures are
available for earlier time periods and if time trends are
taken into account. Research in western high-income
countries has shown a substantial increase in adoles-
cent depression and anxiety over the past 30 years,
especially among girls; rates of neurodevelopmental dis-
orders remained relatively stable, whereas conduct
problems decreased in many but not all countries (Bor,
Dean, Najman, & Hayatbakhsh, 2014; Collishaw &
Sellers, 2020). There is also evidence for a decrease in
adolescent tobacco, alcohol and drug use in many but
not all countries (Ma et al., 2021; Schulenberg, Patrick,
Maslowsky, & Maggs, 2014). Most studies on adolescent
mental health and substance use have been conducted
in the more afﬂuent westernised countries, although the
vast majority of the world’s adolescents live in lower
income countries with a high burden of disease and
injury (Azzopardi et al., 2019). Different living conditions
and rapid societal changes are likely to lead to variations
in adolescent mental health and substance use trends
(Azzopardi
et al., 2018; Ma
et al., 2021). The pandemic-related restrictions also var-
ied considerably across countries (World Health Organi-
inform scientiﬁc
zation, 2021).
understanding, policy and practice, it is essential to
obtain data from a range of countries differing in politi-
cal, educational and health systems.

The present study provides evidence about changes in
adolescent mental health and substance use in Russia
between 2002, 2015 and during the COVID-19 pan-
demic using cross-cohort comparisons. The pandemic-
related restrictions in the Russian Federation varied
across regions; this study used data from Novosibirsk,
Russia’s third largest city, located in Western Siberia.
During-pandemic data were collected in Spring 2021, a
year after the stay-at-home order, when many restric-
tions have been lifted and schools were reopened. The
ﬁrst aim was to examine cohort differences in levels of
adolescent prosocial behaviour and mental health prob-
lems and rates of substance use between 2002, 2015
and 2021. The second aim was to establish whether
cross-cohort changes varied by gender. The third aim
was to test whether changes in adolescent mental health
and substance use might be accounted for by socio-
demographic factors, such as family composition and
parental occupation.

Methods

Participants and procedures
The investigation used three school-based samples of 12- to 18-
year-old adolescents attending non-selective mainstream
schools in Novosibirsk, Russia’s third largest city. The 2002
sample (n = 713 adolescents from 12 schools in eight city dis-
tricts) was drawn from a representative sample of 4614

region

(Knyazev,

students from different educational institutions (mainstream
schools, evening schools, vocational schools and technical col-
leges) located in the city, smaller towns and rural area of Novosi-
birsk
Slobodskaya, Kharchenko, &
Wilson, 2004). The 2015 sample (n = 840 adolescents from nine
schools in ﬁve city districts) was drawn from the Eurasian Child
& Adolescent Mental Health Study (ECAMHS, Sourander
et al., 2018),
including 1601 adolescents from mainstream
schools in two Siberian cities, Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk.
The 2021 sample (n = 721) was recruited from ﬁve public
schools in four city districts, representing a range of socioeco-
nomic backgrounds. The study was approved by the Scientiﬁc
Research Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine Ethics Com-
mittee.

Data collection took place in April–May 2002, 2015 and
2021, at the end of the school year. Because of the COVID-19
pandemic, schools in Novosibirsk were closed from the begin-
ning of April 2020 to the end of school year in June 2020. At the
beginning of the next school year on 1 September 2020, schools
reopened and, although there were a number of restrictions and
part-time remote online learning during the 2020–2021 school
year, students enrolled in schools attended in-class lessons.
Following permission from the school authorities and consent
from parents obtained in March 2002, 2015 and 2021, sec-
ondary school students in grades 6–11 were approached to par-
ticipate. The survey was conducted on a regular school day; all
students who were present in the classroom were asked to ﬁll in
an anonymous questionnaire during a school lesson. Students
were told that participation was voluntary and that their
responses were conﬁdential. Data on response rates were avail-
able for the 2015 (80%) and 2021 (76%) studies. These ﬁgures
indicate that, during pandemic, data were not seriously biased
by non-attendance.

Socio-demographic characteristics of the samples are pre-
sented in Table 1. Participants in 2015 were younger than in
2002 and 2021. The proportion of male participants was higher
in each successive cohort, possibly because in the earlier years
relatively more adolescent boys attended vocational colleges. All
three studies included adolescents from the full spectrum of
socioeconomic backgrounds. The proportion of lone parent fam-
ilies increased with each successive cohort, consistent with glo-
bal changes in family structure over past decades (Georgas,
Berry, Van de Vijver, Ka(cid:1)gitc(cid:1)ibas(cid:1)i, & Poortinga, 2006). The pro-
portion of fathers who were not in the work force decreased from
2002 to 2021. Comparisons with national socioeconomic, edu-
cational and health indicators suggest that the study samples
were reasonably representative of urban adolescents from many
regions of the Russian Federation.

Measures
Mental health. The Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire
(SDQ, Goodman, 2001) is a reliable and valid measure of child
and adolescent mental health (http://www.sdqinfo.org). The
Russian version has been validated in a stratiﬁed random sam-
ple (Goodman, Slobodskaya, & Knyazev, 2005). The SDQ 25
items are divided between ﬁve scales: prosocial behaviour, emo-
tional symptoms, peer relationship problems, conduct prob-
lems and hyperactivity/inattention. Each scale consists of ﬁve
items scored as 0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true and 2 = cer-
tainly true. In community samples, the use of 10-item internal-
ising
and
externalising scales (conduct problems and hyperactivity) is
recommended. The total difﬁculties scale is made of the 20
problem items. The impact supplement included an overall rat-
ing of difﬁculties and items measuring chronicity, distress and
impairment in home life, friendships, classroom learning and
leisure activities. These seven items were scored 0–3 and
summed to generate the impact score.

were somewhat different, but comparable (Table S1, found in

the online Supporting Information). Tobacco use was measured
by the frequency of cigarette smoking (never, rarely/weekly,
daily) scored 0–2. Alcohol use was measured by the frequency of
drinking (never, once a month or more, once a week or more)
scored 0–2. To measure experience with drugs, participants
were asked whether they have tried or used any illicit drugs.
Their responses were scored on a binary (0 = no, 1 = yes) scale.
Tobacco, alcohol and drug use were summed to generate the
substance use score.

Socio-demographic background. Participants
provided
information about their age, gender, family composition and
parental occupation (Table 1). Age was used as a continuous
variable, gender was coded 0 = male, 1 = female. For family
composition, we used three dummy variables, lone parent,
step-parent and non-parent, with dual parent traditional fami-
lies as the reference category. Parental occupation was coded on
a 4-point scale (0 = unemployed/students/pensioners, 1 = un-
skilled/manual, 2 = skilled/technical, 3 = professional/man-
agerial) and the highest code for the family was used. Three
dummy codes were created for unemployed, unskilled/manual
and skilled/technical occupations, with professional/manage-
rial occupation as the reference category.

Missing data
The percentage of participants with missing data ranged from
0.8% to 1.0% for mental health variables and from 0.6% to 1.1%
for substance use variables. Gender was missing for 110 partici-
pants (4.8%), family composition for 30 (1.3%) and parental
occupation was missing for 494 (21.7%). Adolescents with miss-
ing socio-demographic data did not differ from adolescents with
complete data on levels of substance use, prosocial behaviour
and mental health problems, but had signiﬁcantly lower impact
scores (Table S2). Given the small percentage of missing data
on mental health and substance use and few differences
between participants with complete and missing socio-
demographic data, an assumption of missing at random was
plausible.

Statistical analysis
For all analyses, we used the SPSS complex samples procedures
to account for the clustering in the data. First, we estimated the
SDQ mean scores and rates of substance use with 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals (CIs) in 2002, 2015 and 2021 separately for
males and females. Next, we examined the effect of cohort and

(cid:1) 2022 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

socio-demographic variables on adolescent mental health using
linear regression for dimensional outcomes (SDQ and sub-
stance use scores), ordinal regression for tobacco and alcohol
use and logistic regression for experience with drugs. Results
for ordinal outcomes were described in terms of cumulative
odds ratios (COR). In the ﬁrst set of models, age, gender and two
dummy variables for cohort (with 2021 as the reference cate-
gory) were entered at the ﬁrst step. To examine whether cohort
changes differed for males and females, gender-by-cohort inter-
actions were entered at the second step. To test the difference
between 2002 and 2015, we repeated these analyses with 2002
as the reference category.

Following signiﬁcant gender-by-cohort

interactions, we
examined cohort changes separately for males and females and
gender differences separately for each cohort. Finally, we tested
whether cohort effects were still signiﬁcant after family compo-
sition and parental occupation had been taken into account. In
the second set of models, we added three dummy variables for
family composition. In the third set of models, we added three
dummy variables for parental occupation. Because the analyses
involved multiple tests of cohort differences, alpha level was
adjusted using a Bonferroni correction for 13 outcome variables
(a = 0.05/13 = .00384).

Results

Cohort differences in adolescent mental health
Figure 1 shows mean levels of prosocial behaviour and
mental health problems by year of study and gender (see
Table S3 for the SDQ mean scores and 95% CIs). Table 2
presents results of regression analyses for the SDQ
scores. Prosocial behaviour decreased among girls: The
difference between 2002 and 2015 was signiﬁcant
(B = 0.44, 95% CI 0.20–0.68, p = .001), but the differ-
ence between 2015 and 2021 was not. Boys’ prosocial
behaviour did not change over time.

For emotional symptoms, time trends differed by gen-
der, with an increase by one scale point among girls and
no change among boys. Girls’ level of emotional symp-
toms increased from 2002 to 2015 (B = 0.95, 95% CI
0.54–1.36, p < .001), the difference between 2015 and
2021 was nonsigniﬁcant. Peer problems increased from
2002 to 2015 (B = 0.64, 95% CI 0.47–0.82, p < .001)

and decreased from 2015 to 2021. These changes were
signiﬁcant only among girls.
Internalising problems
increased from 2002 to 2021 due to an increase between
2002 and 2015, which was signiﬁcant only among girls
(B = 1.85, 95% CI 1.35–2.35, p < .001).

There were no signiﬁcant cohort differences for boys’
and girls’ conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention
and the broadband externalising problems. Total difﬁ-
culties increased from 2002 to 2015 (B = 1.28, 95% CI
0.67–1.90, p < .001); this increase was signiﬁcant only
among girls. Time trends in the impact score differed by
gender, with an increase among girls and a decrease
among boys, although these changes were nonsigniﬁ-
cant following Bonferroni correction. After controlling for
family composition (Table S4) and parental occupation
(Table S5), cohort differences in prosocial behaviour and
mental health problems remained unchanged.

Cohort differences in adolescent substance use
Figure 2 shows rates of substance use by year and gen-
der (see Table S3 for percentages with 95% CIs). Table 3
presents the results of regression analyses. Tobacco use
decreased signiﬁcantly from 2002 to 2021. In 2002,
33.5% of adolescents reported smoking; in 2015, this
proportion was 15.9% (COR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.77–3.70);
the decrease was larger among boys than girls, both in
absolute (24.6% and 12.9%, respectively) and in relative
terms (64.4% and 42.0%, respectively). In 2021, smok-
ing nonsigniﬁcantly increased to 16.1%. Alcohol use also
decreased from 2002 to 2021. In 2002, 33.0% of adoles-
cents reported monthly alcohol use and 16.6% reported
weekly use; in 2015, these proportions were 13.9% and
2.3% (COR = 4.27, 95% CI 3.34–5.47). In 2021, alcohol
use did not change signiﬁcantly. Time trends in alcohol

In 2002, 5.1% of adolescents reported having tried
drugs;
in 2015, this proportion increased to 7.0%,
whereas in 2021, it decreased to 4.7%. However, these
changes were nonsigniﬁcant following Bonferroni cor-
rection. From 2002 to 2021, the overall level of sub-
stance use decreased threefold among boys and twofold
among girls. The decrease between 2002 and 2015 was
substantial (B = 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.91, p < .001); the
difference between 2015 and 2021 was nonsigniﬁcant.
After controlling for family composition (Table S6) and
parental occupation (Table S7), cohort differences in
substance use remained unchanged or became greater.

Socio-demographic factors
Girls rated themselves higher than boys on all SDQ mea-
sures except peer problems (Table 2). For prosocial
behaviour, gender differences were largest in 2002,
smaller in 2015 and nonsigniﬁcant in 2021. Gender dif-
ferences in emotional symptoms were smallest in 2002
and larger in 2015 and 2021. Gender differences in total
difﬁculties and the impact score increased over time.
Boys reported more tobacco, alcohol and drug use than
girls in 2002, however, in 2015, these gender differences
were reversed (Figure 2); in 2021, girls reported signiﬁ-
cantly higher rates of alcohol use (24.4%) than boys
(14.7%; COR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.38–2.85, p = .001).

Living in a stepfamily was associated with more men-
tal health problems (Table S4). Family type did not con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to tobacco, alcohol and drug use
(Table S6). Parental occupation did not contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to adolescent mental health and substance
use (Tables S5 and S7).

Discussion

The present study examined cohort differences in Rus-
sian adolescent mental health, as measured by the SDQ,
and substance use between 2002, 2015 and 2021 using
school-based samples in a large Siberian city. The 2021
data were collected a year after the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic and the related lockdown, when schools
were reopened, with part-time remote online learning
and a number of societal restrictions. The ﬁndings
showed substantial increases in adolescent emotional
symptoms and internalising problems over 19 years.
These increases occurred between 2002 and 2015; levels
of adolescent emotional symptoms and internalising
problems did not differ signiﬁcantly from 2015 to during
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Peer problems
increased from 2002 to 2015 and decreased between
2015 and 2021. A secular increase in Russian adoles-
cent emotional symptoms and the broadband internalis-
ing problems is consistent with ﬁndings from high-
income countries (Bor et al., 2014; Collishaw &
Sellers, 2020), despite differences in cultural context
and medical services. Stable levels of hyperactivity/inat-
tention and conduct problems is in line with some, but

not all, studies of adolescent mental health trends (Col-
lishaw & Sellers, 2020; Sourander et al., 2012).

The ﬁndings also showed substantial decreases in
adolescent substance use. Over 19 years, there was a
roughly ﬁvefold decrease in weekly drinking and a three-
fold decrease in daily smoking. Most decreases occurred
between 2002 and 2015; adolescent tobacco, alcohol
and drug use did not change signiﬁcantly from 2015 to
2021. A secular decrease in Russian adolescent sub-
stance use is consistent with ﬁndings from other coun-
tries (Azzopardi et al., 2019; Kraus et al., 2018; Ma
et al., 2021; Schulenberg et al., 2014), suggesting that
the causes of cross-cohort changes in tobacco and alco-
hol use are likely to be similar. The World Health Organi-
zation
Tobacco
Control (2003) was implemented in the Russian Federa-
tion in 2008; alcohol control measures have been intro-
duced at the beginning of the 21st century (World Health
Organization, 2019). These policies and measures pro-
vided the basis for changes in social norms and for the

Convention

Framework

on

promotion of a healthy lifestyle shared by later cohorts of
adolescents.

An important result of this study is the lack of signiﬁ-
cant change in adolescent mental health, as measured
by the SDQ, and substance use from 2015 to during the
pandemic in 2021, with the exception of a decrease in
peer problems. That stands in contrast not only to ﬁnd-
ings during the pandemic (Jones et al., 2021; Samji
et al., 2022), but also to evidence for time changes in
adolescent mental health before
the pandemic
(B(cid:3)elanger, Patte, Leatherdale, Gansaonr(cid:3)e, & Had-
dad, 2021; Cosma et al., 2020) and associated increases
in school stress (H€ogberg, 2021). Our ﬁndings demon-
strate that increases in adolescent internalising prob-
lems during the last decade are not universal and
suggest that school pressure and other stresses, includ-
ing the COVID-19 crisis, may not have a universal
impact on adolescent mental health. They also provide
circumstantial evidence that universally increased digi-
tal technology usage may not lead to increases in

adolescent mental health problems. The lack of COVID-
19-related impact may be explained by less stringent
restrictions in the region, widespread denialism, socioe-
conomic conditions, medical care and also by resilience
and recovery.

Contrary to some studies (Jones et al., 2021; Samji
et al., 2022), we did not ﬁnd that
female gender
increased the risk for being adversely affected by the
pandemic. However, secular trends in adolescent mental
health, as measured by the SDQ, and substance use dif-
fered by gender, consistent with ﬁndings from other
countries (Bor et al., 2014; Collishaw & Sellers, 2020;
Pape, Rossow, & Brunborg, 2018; Simons-Morton
et al., 2009). A decrease in prosocial behaviour and
increases in emotional symptoms, internalising prob-
lems and total difﬁculties were signiﬁcant only among
girls. A decrease in alcohol use was larger among boys,
both in absolute and in relative terms. These ﬁndings
suggest that the causes of a worsening of girls’ mental
health in the 21st century may be universal and high-
light the need for research into gender-speciﬁc risk and
protective factors and for effective mental health inter-
ventions.

Gender differences in adolescent mental health, with
girls reporting more problems, were similar to those seen
worldwide (Campbell, Bann, & Patalay, 2021). The pre-
sent study found that gender differences in adolescent
emotional problems, total difﬁculties and their impact
increased over the last 19 years, whereas gender differ-
ences in prosocial behaviour decreased. Previous studies
in western countries provided evidence for the narrowing
of the gender gap in adolescent alcohol use in the 21st
century; however, gender-speciﬁc trends varied across
the countries (Kraus et al., 2018; Pape et al., 2018;
Simons-Morton et al., 2009). The present ﬁndings
showed the closing and reversing of the gender gap in
adolescent substance use in 2015 and 2021, indicating
the need to consider whether and how the gender gaps in
adolescent mental health and substance use have chan-
ged across time in different countries, and what the
determinants of these changes are.

In line with studies from other countries (Dunn, 2002;
Ganong & Coleman, 2017), living in a stepfamily was
associated with higher levels of mental health difﬁcul-
ties. However, neither family composition nor parental
occupation accounted for cross-cohort changes in Rus-
sian adolescent mental health and substance use. Previ-
ous research also showed that socio-demographic
factors, such as family structure and socioeconomic sta-
tus, may be important for levels of adolescent mental
health and substance use at each time point, but do not
explain over-time changes (Collishaw, Goodman, Pick-
les, & Maughan, 2007). Studies examining the effect of
socio-demographic factors on pandemic-related changes
in adolescent mental health have reported mixed results
(Hu & Qian, 2021; Stevens et al., 2021). Further
research on trends in possible explanatory factors and
adolescent mental health, both within and between
countries, is needed.

Strengths and limitations

comprehensive set of comparable mental health and
cross-cohort
substance use measures

the
data were from an under-researched cultural context.
Despite these strengths, there are several limitations.
Although the samples were reasonably diverse, the
study would beneﬁt from the use of more representa-
tive samples, including other regions of the Russian
Federation, other educational
institutions, such as
vocational schools, and adolescents not attending
school. To increase comparability across cohorts,
it
would be preferable to collect data from the same
schools at each time point. The cross-cohort compar-
isons did not allow us to examine within-individual
changes, which would be possible with longitudinal
data. Obvious limitations are the brief measure of
mental health and exclusive reliance on self-reports.
Although the SDQ is widely used worldwide, allowing
for cross-country comparisons, the study would bene-
ﬁt from a more detailed diagnostic assessment and
the data from multiple informants.
it
would be useful to include more measures of family
and peer relationships and wider environment.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence for substantial increases in
Russian adolescent emotional symptoms and internalis-
ing problems, as measured by the SDQ, and decreases
in tobacco and alcohol use in a large Siberian city over
the last 19 years. The changes were substantial from
2002 to 2015 and nonsigniﬁcant from 2015 to 2021. A
decrease in SDQ prosocial behaviour and increases in
mental health problems were evident only among girls,
whereas a decrease in alcohol use was larger among
boys. Family composition and parental occupation did
not account for these changes. The widening of the gen-
der gap in adolescent mental health and the closing and
reversing of the gender gap in substance use highlight
the need for research into gender-speciﬁc risk and pro-
tective factors and for effective mental health interven-
tions. There was no evidence of a worsening of Russian
girls’ and boys’ mental health, as measured by the SDQ,
from 2015 to 2021, a year after the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic. This can be a sign of successful coping;
further research with more representative
however,
samples, additional measures and sources of informa-
tion about adolescent mental health and the determi-
nants of resilience and vulnerability is needed.
