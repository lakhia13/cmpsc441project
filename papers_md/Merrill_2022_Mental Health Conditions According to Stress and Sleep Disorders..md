Abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare associations between stress and sleep disorders
(insomnia, hypersomnia, and sleep apnea), identify potential modifying effects, and compare associa-
tions between stress and types of sleep disorders with selected mental health conditions. Analyses
were based on 21,027 employees aged 18–64 years in 2020 who were insured by the Deseret Mutual
Beneﬁt Administrators (DMBA). The risk of stress (2.3%) was signiﬁcantly greater in women, singles,
and those with dependent children. The risk of a sleep disorder was 12.1% (2.1% for insomnia, 1.0%
for hypersomnia, and 10.1% for sleep apnea). The risk of stress was signiﬁcantly greater for those
with a sleep disorder (136% overall, 179% for insomnia, and 102% for sleep apnea after adjusting for
age, sex, marital status, dependent children, and sleep disorders). The risk of stress among those
with sleep apnea was signiﬁcantly greater for singles than for married individuals. Approximately
9.5% had anxiety, 8.5% had depression, 2.0% had ADHD, 0.6% had bipolar disorder, 0.4% had OCD,
and 0.1% had schizophrenia. Each of these mental health conditions was signiﬁcantly positively
associated with stress and sleep disorders. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were more strongly
associated with stress and sleep disorders than were the other mental health conditions. Insomnia
was more strongly associated with anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD, and schizophrenia than was
sleep apnea.

1. Introduction

Stress can lead to an immune response in the body and consequential adverse health
outcomes. Psychological distress signals to the body a deviation from homeostasis, trig-
gering a reaction from the immune system, which often manifests itself in the form of
inﬂammation [1]. The longer that stress persists, the less the body can manage the asso-
ciated prolonged inﬂammation, which increases the risk of susceptibility to a wide range
of illnesses [2,3]. Stress over time can lead to immune diseases such as psoriasis and
rheumatoid arthritis [4]. Stress and inﬂammation are contributing factors to cardiovascular
diseases, including coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis [5,6]. Inﬂammation also
contributes to several respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), asthma, and pulmonary ﬁbrosis [7].

Stress is also associated with sleep disorders [8–11]. Stress and sleep disorders have a
bidirectional relationship that affects the central nervous system and metabolism [12,13].
High stress hormone levels are associated with decreased sleep duration, with both stress
and sleep problems being associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome [14]. Metabolic
syndrome is a cluster of conditions (high blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol or
triglycerides, and excessive body fat around the waist), which increase the risk of type
2 diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.

Common sleep disorders include insomnia (difﬁculty falling and/or staying asleep),
hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness), and sleep apnea (airﬂow is limited while
sleeping, causing low oxygen saturation and disrupted sleep). Many important physiologi-
cal changes take place in all body systems and organs during sleep, but with insufﬁcient
sleep, physical and mental health problems ensue [15]. For example, symptoms associated

with insomnia, such as prolonged sleep latency, problems maintaining sleep, and early
morning awakening, are associated with an increased risk of illness, cognitive impairment,
lower productivity, and mental health problems [16–18].

The association between stress and sleep disorders is complex and often bidirectional,
with both direct and indirect inﬂuences. Stress can cause insomnia and be the result of
it, thereby explaining the positive association between stress and insomnia that is often
observed [19]. Hypersomnia may be caused by another sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea),
dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, a physical problem (e.g., tumor, head trauma,
or injury to the central nervous system), a medical condition (multiple sclerosis, depression,
or obesity), or drug or alcohol abuse [20]. It has been suggested that hypersomnia can cause
anxiety [21], but anxiety may also indirectly contribute to hypersomnia by inﬂuencing other
sleep disorders or drug or alcohol abuse. Obstructive sleep apnea can contribute to stress by
preventing restful sleep, resulting in an elevation of the stress hormone cortisol [22]. Further,
stress can contribute to unhealthy habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol abuse, consuming excess
caffeine, overeating, and not exercising), which can elevate the risk of sleep apnea [23,24].
In general, each of these sleep disorders has been shown to be a source of stress, creating a
cyclical effect that continually harms physical and psychological health [25–27].

The current study was conducted to better understand the association between stress
and sleep disorders (insomnia, hypersomnia, and sleep apnea), identify potential modifying
effects, and determine the relative inﬂuence of stress alone, sleep disorders alone, and stress
and sleep disorders combined on selected types of mental health illness.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Population

This study was based on demographic and insurance claims data for contract holders
employed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Data were obtained from the
Deseret Mutual Beneﬁt Administrators (DMBA), a large insurance company that provides
health beneﬁts and retirement income to employees and their families. Contract holders in
this study resided in Utah (74.2%), Idaho (9.2%), Paciﬁc states (9.1%), and other American
states (7.5%). They work in the Church education system, seminaries, and institutes (36.2%);
as manual laborers (33.0%); in other companies (10.6); and in other capacities (20.2%). As
contract holders retire from work at age 65 years or older and become eligible for Medicare,
they tend to be dropped from DMBA.

Employee eligibility data were linked to automated medical claims data. The linked
database used in the study was then de-identiﬁed according to Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines. The authors’ Institutional Review Board
reviewed the study and deemed it exempt from most of the requirements of the Federal
Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects.

2.2. Data Collection

Analyses are based on 21,027 employed contract holders aged 18–64 years in 2020.
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (ICD-10-CM)
codes [28] were used to classify the sleep disorders and mental health conditions considered.
Licensed health-care providers submitted medical claims to the insurance company. Sleep
disorders (G47) were speciﬁed as insomnia (G470), hypersomnia (G471), and sleep apnea
(G473). Stress (F43) consists of a reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorder. It is
applicable to an acute crisis reaction, an acute reaction to stress, a combat and operational
stress reaction, combat fatigue, a crisis state, and psychic shock. Speciﬁc mental health
disorders considered were anxiety (F40, F1), depression (F32, F33), attention deﬁcit hy-
peractivity disorder (ADHD) (F90), bipolar disorder (F31), obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) (F42), and schizophrenia (F20–F29). Other variables considered in the study were
age (18–29, 30–39, 49–49, or 50–64), sex, marital status (married or single), and whether the
contract holder had one or more dependent children (yes or no). A dependent child was

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7957

3 of 12

deﬁned as an individual residing in the contract holder’s household who can legally be
claimed as a dependent on federal income tax.

2.3. Statistical Techniques

Descriptive measures used to characterize the data included counts, means, standard
deviations, and percentages. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate risk
ratios adjusted for age, sex, marital status, and dependent children. These variables were
available in the DMBA database and considered potential confounders because of their
associations with stress and sleep disorders. Risk ratios measuring the association between
stress and each speciﬁc type of sleep disorder were further adjusted for the other types of
sleep disorders. Interaction terms were assessed in the models. The risk of other mental
health conditions according to stress and sleep disorders were also estimated in the models.
Two-sided tests of signiﬁcance were used based on the 0.05 level. Statistical analyses were
derived from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA, 2003).

3. Results

The average age was 46.42 (SD = 11.50), with 9.9% aged 18–29, 21.5% aged 30–39,
26.8% aged 40–49, and 41.8% aged 50–64; 68.6% men; 78.7% married; and 66.6% with
dependent children. The risk of stress (2.3% overall) was signiﬁcantly greater in women,
singles (only for the model involving stress with/without mental illness), and those with
dependent children (Table 1). Interaction terms involving sex were evaluated for both
models. In the ﬁrst model, where the outcome variable was stress with/without men-
tal illness, the higher risk of stress among women was signiﬁcantly greater for singles
(Risk Ratio = 3.25, 95% CI 2.05–5.16) than for married individuals (Risk Ratio = 1.94,
95% CI 1.54–2.44). The higher risk of stress among women was also greater for those with
no dependent children (Risk Ratio = 2.70, 95% CI 1.88–3.87) versus those with dependent
children (Risk Ratio = 1.97, 95% CI 1.55–2.52). In the second model, where the outcome
variable was stress without mental illness, the higher risk of stress among women was sig-
niﬁcantly greater for those with no dependent children (Risk Ratio = 3.58, 95% CI 1.98–6.47)
versus those with dependent children (Risk Ratio = 2.24, 95% CI 1.05–4.81). Other interac-
tions involving sex were not signiﬁcant.

The risk of a sleep disorder was 12.1%. It was 2.1% for insomnia, 1.0% for hypersomnia,
and 10.1% for sleep apnea. Of those with insomnia, hypersomnia, or sleep apnea, 74.6%
had sleep apnea only, 13.2% had insomnia only, 6.2% had hypersomnia and sleep apnea,
3.7% had insomnia and sleep apnea, 1.3% had hypersomnia only, 0.8% had insomnia,
hypersomnia, and sleep apnea, and 0.2% had insomnia and hypersomnia. These risks of
insomnia, hypersomnia, and sleep apnea signiﬁcantly increased with age, more so for sleep
apnea (Table 2). Women had a signiﬁcantly higher risk of insomnia but a lower risk of
hypersomnia or sleep apnea. Married individuals had a signiﬁcantly greater risk of sleep
apnea than singles, whereas those with dependent children had a signiﬁcantly lower risk
of sleep apnea than those without dependent children.

of stress among women was signiﬁcant for married (Risk Ratio = 0.54, 95% CI 0.47–0.61)
but not for singles (Risk Ratio = 0.81, 95% CI 0.64–1.03). A lower risk of sleep apnea was
also only seen in those with dependent children (Risk Ratio = 0.49, 95% CI 0.42–0.58) but
not in those without dependent children (Risk Ratio = 0.71, 95% CI 0.61–0.83).

The risk of stress was also assessed according to overall sleep disorders, insomnia,
hypersomnia, and sleep apnea, adjusted for age, sex, marital status, and dependent children
(Table 3). The risk of stress was signiﬁcantly greater for those with a sleep disorder (136%)
after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, and dependent children. The risk of stress
was also signiﬁcantly lower for those with insomnia (179%) and for those with sleep
apnea (102%) after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, dependent children, and insomnia
and hypersomnia. There was not a signiﬁcant association between the risk of stress and
hypersomnia. Interaction terms were assessed but not signiﬁcant in either model.

4. Discussion

This study extends previous research by comparing associations between stress and
speciﬁc types of sleep disorders and by considering whether certain variables modify
these associations. It further assesses the association between stress and speciﬁc types
of sleep disorders with common mental health conditions. The main ﬁndings show that
insomnia was most strongly associated with stress, followed by sleep apnea. Hypersomnia
was not signiﬁcantly associated with stress. In general, stress more strongly correlates
with mental health conditions than do sleep disorders. The strongest associations involve
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Insomnia was more strongly associated with each of
the mental health conditions (except depression and ADHD) than was sleep apnea.

The risk of stress was associated with sex, marital status, and dependent children.
The higher risk of stress among women than men is consistent with other research [29–31].
The lower risk of stress in married individuals is consistent with another study in which
married people had lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol compared with those who
were previously or never married [32]. Spousal support has been shown to attenuate
stressful events [33]. Single, separated, widowed, and divorced individuals all reported
higher levels of stress, with greater worry about the future and less conﬁdence in their
decision-making abilities [34]. Loneliness is also more common in individuals who are not
in a current marital relationship. Loneliness increases an individual’s risk of physical and
mental health problems and is considered a growing public health concern [35].

Higher stress in those with children is consistent with research on the risk of stress
in households with dependents [36]. There is a strong positive association between the
number of dependents and the level of stress [36,37]. Having dependent children can cause
stress in many forms, including emotional, ﬁnancial, and psychological. Parental stress has
been studied and measured, and the burden of stress has consistently been found to be
higher in those with dependents than those without [38,39].

In 2020, the risk of a sleep disorder among adults 18–64 reported in this study was
12.1%. Data from surveys administered to the general population will identify a higher
incidence of sleep disorders than found in the current study, where possibly those with
more severe conditions resulting in a medical claim were identiﬁed as cases. In addition,
in contrast to the incidence data reported in this study, cross-sectional surveys typically
produce prevalence data, which represents ever having had the problem. Hence, prevalence
of sleep disorders will be higher than incidence of sleep disorders.

The risk of insomnia, hypersomnia, and sleep apnea increased with age, which is
consistent with research showing more sleep disturbances occurring in older adults be-
cause aging is associated with factors affecting sleep (multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and
psychosocial factors) [40,41]. Risk factors for sleep apnea that increase with age include
obesity, snoring, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and diabetes [42].

The risk of insomnia was greater in women, and the risk of sleep apnea was greater
in men. Other research has shown a higher risk of insomnia in women than in men [43].
Studies have shown that women experience unique hormonal changes that increase their
risk of insomnia [44,45]. Women are more likely to recognize sleep disruptions and report
these problems and are also more likely to seek professional help for sleep issues [46].
Research has also shown a higher risk of sleep apnea in men than in women [47]. The
reasons why men are more prone to sleep apnea than women may be due to differences in
obesity, upper airway anatomy, breathing control, hormones, and aging [48].

Married individuals had a higher risk of sleep apnea, which is likely because the

problem is more commonly identiﬁed when there is a sleeping partner present [49].

Having dependent children was negatively associated with sleep apnea. This result
is unclear. However, risk factors for sleep apnea [42] may be associated with a lower
likelihood of having children, possibly contributing to this result.

A signiﬁcantly increased risk of stress was observed for those with insomnia and sleep
apnea but not hypersomnia. The association between stress and insomnia [19,50,51] and
sleep apnea is consistent with other studies [10,11,22,25,26]. Failure to ﬁnd a statistically

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7957

signiﬁcant association between stress and hypersomnia is consistent with a lack of other
studies reporting an association. However, it seems reasonable that stress can indirectly
inﬂuence hypersomnia by contributing to other sleep disorders and/or drug or alcohol
abuse, which, in turn, is associated with an increased risk of hypersomnia.

A positive association between sleep apnea and stress was signiﬁcantly greater in
singles than in married individuals. This may be because married individuals, especially
those whose partner stays in bed with them, are more likely to adhere to overnight treat-
ment [52]. Treatment may help both parties sleep better and lower the potential stress
associated with sleep apnea. Further, one study found that divorced individuals tended to
have more sleep problems compared with married or single counterparts [53]. Divorce is
stressful [54]. Being single because of a divorce stemming in part from sleep apnea may
explain some of the higher risk of stress among singles in the current study.

Although many studies have shown that stress is associated with an increased risk
of mental health problems (e.g., neurosis, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, OCD, and
schizophrenia) [55–63], the current study looked at the simultaneous association between
stress and types of sleep disorders with selected mental health conditions. In general, stress
alone had a stronger association with mental health problems than sleep disorders alone,
and the combination of stress and sleep disorders had the strongest association. When
stress reaches the level that results in sleep difﬁculties, or sleep difﬁculties reach the level of
producing stress, then other more permanent intrinsic mental health conditions may arise
or be aggravated. Hence, it is reasonable that the combination of stress and sleep disorders
has the greatest association with the other mental health problems considered.

Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were more strongly associated with stress and
sleep disorders than the other mental health conditions. Schizophrenia was most prone
to a combination of stress and sleep disorders. Stress and stress-related sleep disorders
are temporary reactions to external factors, which can inﬂuence extreme mood swings
of emotional highs (mania) and lows (depression), which characterize bipolar disorder.
In addition, both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are associated with psychosis, and
severe stress and sleep disorders can cause psychosis [64,65].

The observed positive associations between insomnia and the mental health con-
ditions [66–70] and between sleep apnea and the mental health conditions [71–73] are
consistent with the literature. In the context of these positive associations, the current study
found that insomnia was more strongly associated with anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD,
and schizophrenia than was sleep apnea. This may be because insomnia is more likely
to have a bidirectional association with these mental health conditions. Although sleep
apnea has been shown to increase the risk of mental health problems, there is no evidence
that mental health conditions directly cause sleep apnea. Mental health conditions are
not among the established risk factors for sleep apnea (excess weight or obesity, a narrow
throat, a round head, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, allergies, deviated septum, medical
conditions that congest upper airways, smoking, and alcohol abuse) [74]. However, mental
health conditions such as depression may indirectly inﬂuence sleep apnea by increasing
the risk of obesity, physical inactivity, consuming too much caffeine, smoking, and heavy
drinking [23,24].

The study data were based on enrollment and medical claims from enrollees in the
DMBA database during 2020, so no selection of subgroups that might have resulted in
bias was present. A mental health diagnosis would not lead to losing insurance, so
selective under-reporting of stress or other mental health claims for this reason is unlikely.
However, it may be that some individuals experiencing stress or other mental health or
sleep conditions were not identiﬁed based on their ﬁling a claim for treating these problems.
Incorrect diagnosis and treatment of mental health and sleep conditions are also possible.
The available data did not allow us to identify the level of under- or over-reporting of
mental health or sleep conditions. The fact that less serious stress was captured in the
claims database could have dampened any association between stress and the mental
health and sleep conditions considered.

The data were cross-sectionally evaluated in a single year. Hence, we were not able
to evaluate causal directions between stress and sleep disorders. Further, the data did not
conﬁrm sleep disorders based on polysomnography records.

5. Conclusions

Stress is positively associated with insomnia and sleep apnea, with the association
stronger for insomnia. A bidirectional association is more likely between stress and in-
somnia than between stress and sleep apnea, where stress is more likely to result from
sleep apnea rather than cause it (unless indirectly). The positive association between stress
and sleep apnea is greater in singles than married people, possibly because married indi-
viduals are more likely to adhere to overnight treatment and because singles who have
been divorced are more likely to have sleeping disorders, which may have contributed
to a stressful divorce. Stress alone has a stronger association with other mental health
problems than sleep disorders alone, and the combination of stress and sleep disorders
has the strongest association. Bipolar disorder is more strongly associated with stress and
sleep disorders than the other mental health conditions. Schizophrenia is more strongly
associated with a combination of stress and sleep disorders than the other mental health
conditions. Stress and stress-related sleep disorders are temporary reactions to external
factors, which characterize bipolar disorder. Both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are
associated with psychosis, and severe stress and sleep disorders can cause psychosis.

The information provided in this study may help health-care workers identify high-
risk groups for experiencing stress and sleep disorders. Understanding the association
between stress and sleep disorders and potential modiﬁers of this association can further
help identify those at greatest risk. Finally, understanding the individual and combined
contributions of stress and sleep disorders to mental health conditions may further inform
health-care workers of the importance of treating stress and sleep disorders in order to
control mental health conditions. Future research may explore speciﬁc factors that can
inﬂuence both stress and sleep disorders and modify their relationship (e.g., migraine
headaches, characteristics of dependent children, such as the age and number of children
in the home, social support, and so on).
