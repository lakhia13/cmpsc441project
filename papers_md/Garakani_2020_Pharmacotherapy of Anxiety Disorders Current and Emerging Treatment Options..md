(GAD), social anxiety disorder

(PD), generalized anxiety disorder

Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and a leading cause
of disability. While there continues to be expansive research in posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), depression and schizophrenia, there is a relative dearth of novel
medications under investigation for anxiety disorders. This review’s ﬁrst aim is to
summarize current pharmacological treatments (both approved and off-label) for panic
disorder
(SAD),
and speciﬁc phobias (SP), including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), azapirones (e.g., buspirone), mixed
antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine), antipsychotics, antihistamines (e.g., hydroxyzine),
alpha- and beta-adrenergic medications (e.g., propranolol, clonidine), and GABAergic
medications (benzodiazepines, pregabalin, and gabapentin). Posttraumatic stress
disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are excluded from this review. Second,
we will review novel pharmacotherapeutic agents under investigation for the treatment
of anxiety disorders in adults. The pathways and neurotransmitters reviewed include
serotonergic agents, glutamate modulators, GABAergic medications, neuropeptides,
neurosteroids, alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents, cannabinoids, and natural remedies.
The outcome of the review reveals a lack of randomized double-blind placebo- controlled
trials for anxiety disorders and few studies comparing novel treatments to existing
anxiolytic agents. Although there are some recent randomized controlled trials for
novel agents including neuropeptides, glutamatergic agents (such as ketamine and
d-cycloserine), and cannabinoids (including cannabidiol) primarily in GAD or SAD, these
trials have largely been negative, with only some promise for kava and PH94B (an
inhaled neurosteroid). Overall, the progression of current and future psychopharmacology
research in anxiety disorders suggests that there needs to be further expansion in
research of these novel pathways and larger-scale studies of promising agents with
positive results from smaller trials.

Current and Novel Anxiety Medications

INTRODUCTION

Anxiety disorders are the most common class of psychiatric
disorders, with a lifetime prevalence in the United States of
around 32%, according to the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication (NCS-R) (1). Among the anxiety disorders, social
anxiety disorder (SAD) and speciﬁc phobia (SP) are the most
common (1). According to the World Health Organization, there
are about 264 million people globally who suﬀer from anxiety
disorders, representing a 15% increase since 2005 (2). Anxiety can
lead to work and school absences and have a larger cost burden
than other psychiatric disorders due to their higher prevalence
(3–5). Despite this, there has been far less recent research on
novel medication treatments for anxiety disorders over the past
5–10 years compared to the number of experimental drug trials
on treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar
disorder, and schizophrenia (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

the

Part of the reason for the relative paucity of new drug
existence of Food and Drug
compounds may be
Administration (FDA)-approved eﬃcacious medications and
psychotherapies for anxiety disorders, as well as the perception
that anxiety disorders are managed adequately with the currently
available treatments. The literature, however, indicates that only
60–85% of patients with anxiety disorders respond (experience at
least a 50% improvement) to current biological and psychological
treatments (6). In addition, only about half of the responders
achieve recovery (deﬁned as minimal anxiety symptoms) (6).
There is also evidence to suggest that patients with anxiety
disorders,
in particular generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
and SAD (7), have high rates of recurrence and/or experience
persistent anxiety symptoms, especially if they have comorbid
MDD (8). There could be several explanations for the potential
refractory nature of these disorders, including misdiagnosis, poor
adherence to treatment, substance use, or other comorbidities,
although it does suggest that conventional treatments may not
be eﬀective for all patients and alternative pharmacotherapies
should be developed (9). Unfortunately, many of the treatments
that are currently being investigated are simply modiﬁcations of
already approved treatments.

The nosology of anxiety disorders underwent a shift with the
publication of the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013 (10). Due to
questions about the phenomenological and neurobiological bases
of
the diseases, both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were removed from
Anxiety Disorders section and placed into their own diagnostic
classes. Selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder were
also added to the Anxiety Disorders section of the DSM-5.
Agoraphobia was separated from and is now a disorder distinct
from panic disorder (PD). Given the extensive research done
separately on OCD and PTSD and their potentially divergent
neurobiochemical pathways and heritability (11), this review
will focus on the following DSM-5 Anxiety Disorders: PD,
GAD, SAD, and SP. For a thorough review that includes both
anxiety disorders and OCD and PTSD, please see Sartori and
Singewald (12). Finally, although there is strong evidence for the
use of psychotherapies including cognitive behavioral therapy

(CBT) and exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, as well as
emerging data for the role of neurostimulation strategies such
as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), this review will
only consider pharmacotherapies. Additionally, this review will
only discuss the treatment of anxiety in adults and will exclude
research on children and adolescents. Ongoing clinical studies
identiﬁed on the Clinical Trials database (www.clinicaltrials.gov)
will be cited by their National Clinical Trial (NCT) number.

CURRENT TREATMENTS FOR ANXIETY
DISORDERS

Serotonergic/Norepinephrinergic
Antidepressants
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for PD, GAD, and
SAD. Despite these classiﬁcations, medications not approved for
a condition are commonly used “oﬀ-label” in clinical practice.
The European Union has similar indications for the use of SSRIs
and SNRIs for the treatment of anxiety disorders as the FDA but
with broader indications of SSRIs (12). See Table 1 for a list of
FDA-approved and oﬀ-label medications for anxiety.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs are both
ﬁrst-line treatments for PD, GAD, and SAD and have been shown
to be eﬃcacious for the treatment of anxiety disorders (13–16).
A recent meta-analysis reported that most SSRIs and SNRIs are
more eﬃcacious than placebo in GAD, with escitalopram and
duloxetine potentially having the largest eﬀect sizes (17). The
recommended duration of treatment can vary but may be as short
as 3–6 months, or up to 1–2 years or even longer. Although
there may be concern about tachyphylaxis, there is limited
evidence of adverse outcomes with the chronic use of SSRIs or
SNRIs (18). These medications also tend to be well-tolerated,
with usually manageable or short-lived adverse eﬀects such as
nausea, headache, dry mouth, diarrhea, or constipation. Sexual
dysfunction tends to be a more durable and problematic adverse
eﬀect of SSRIs and SNRIs but can be managed with adjunctive
treatments. There is the possibility of patients developing
antidepressant-induced jitteriness or anxiety, potentially due to
initial surge of serotonin, although this anxiety can be mitigated
by slower titration or adjunctive use of benzodiazepines (19).

The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which act as reuptake
inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, were
one of the ﬁrst classes of medications used for anxiety disorders
(20). Despite comparable eﬃcacy to SSRIs,
they are now
less frequently prescribed due to concerns about side eﬀects
including weight gain, dry mouth, sedation, urinary hesitancy or
retention, arrhythmias, and risk of mortality with overdose (20).
Clomipramine and imipramine (both TCAs) are FDA-approved
for PD. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are also older
antidepressant medications which are now typically used only as
a third-line option because of side eﬀects and dietary restrictions.
They are not FDA-approved for anxiety disorders but may be
considered in patients with SAD who are non-responsive to
SSRIs (21).

Buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial agonist classiﬁed under the
azapirones, is FDA-approved for use in anxiety, and is commonly
used as an adjunctive treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs primarily
for GAD (22). It is the only azapirone currently approved in
the United States. A Cochrane review of buspirone for GAD
found that it was superior to placebo but had a smaller eﬀect
size in GAD compared to benzodiazepines and antidepressants
(22). Moreover,
it was not as well-tolerated (nausea and
dizziness) and less eﬀective in those with past benzodiazepine
use (22). A subsequent Cochrane review compared buspirone

to placebo for PD and found buspirone to be less eﬃcacious
than placebo but the review was limited by the dearth of
high-quality studies (23). Buspirone is generally dosed two to
three times a day and has a gradual onset of action of around
10 days to 4 weeks. Adverse eﬀects include nausea, dizziness,
and headache, and there are reports of buspirone-induced
movement disorders (24). There is also anecdotal reporting
for using buspirone to oﬀset sexual side eﬀects from SSRIs
but there are few studies oﬀering empirical support of this
practice (25, 26).

Current and Novel Anxiety Medications

Mixed Antidepressants
Mirtazapine has a broad pharmacological eﬀect, with presynaptic
antagonism of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, postsynaptic
blockade of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, and antagonism of
histamine-1 (H1) receptors (27). Mirtazapine is FDA-approved
for the treatment of MDD in adults. Its beneﬁts include positive
eﬀects on sleep and appetite and its general safety for elderly
patients, fewer drug-drug interactions, and less likelihood of
sexual side eﬀects compared to SSRIs and SNRIs. Adverse
eﬀects include weight gain and other antihistamine eﬀects like
sedation and dry mouth. There are very few clinical trials
assessing mirtazapine for anxiety disorders. In PD, one small
randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported that mirtazapine was
comparable in eﬃcacy to escitalopram (28). In SAD, one RCT of
women showed a signiﬁcant improvement in anxiety symptoms
compared to placebo (29), while a subsequent study failed to
show separation from placebo (30). There are no controlled
studies of mirtazapine in GAD to date. Overall, in the absence
of further trials, the evidence has suggested that mirtazapine
may have eﬃcacy in improving anxiety but primarily as an
adjunctive agent.
Bupropion is

reuptake
inhibitor approved for the treatment of MDD, attention-
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and smoking cessation
(31). Although bupropion has been used in patients with
anxiety who are being treated with SSRIs as an adjunct to oﬀset
sexual side eﬀects, there has been limited investigation of this
medication as a monotherapy for anxiety. Although there is a
common perception that bupropion can worsen anxiety, this
may not be entirely accurate based on previous research of
bupropion on anxiety symptoms in MDD when compared to
SSRIs (31–33). To date, there is only one controlled trial of
bupropion in anxiety disorders, a RCT comparing bupropion
XL to escitalopram in GAD, which found that the two drugs
had comparable anxiolytic eﬃcacy (34). The evidence regarding
eﬃcacy of bupropion for the treatment of PD is conﬂicting
(35, 36). Further work is needed to determine if bupropion
and similar dopamine-enhancing agents are eﬃcacious for the
treatment of anxiety disorders.

dopamine norepinephrine

a

Nefazodone, a serotoninergic modulating antidepressant
thought to inhibit 5-HT reuptake and block postsynaptic 5-HT2
receptor (37), is only FDA-approved for the treatment of MDD.
There have been several open-label studies suggesting potential
beneﬁt in PD and GAD but no controlled studies have been
conducted (37–40). One RCT of nefazodone in SAD did not
report separation from placebo (41). Overall, its use has been
limited by concerns related to very rare but severe cases of
liver toxicity.

Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)
Benzodiazepines have been a longstanding treatment for anxiety
and are still among the most widely prescribed class of psychiatric
medications in the world (42, 43) although there has been
increasing stigma surrounding the use of benzodiazepines in
clinical practice (44). Critics of benzodiazepines cite their being
prescribed as ﬁrst-line treatments for anxiety in primary care
settings before SSRIs, potential risks of tolerance, dependence,

abuse or misuse, and concerns about falls in the elderly (45).
However, there is a lack of strong evidence that SSRIs and
other ﬁrst-line treatments are superior to, or better-tolerated
than, benzodiazepines for anxiety disorders, in particular GAD
(46), especially for short-term treatment (44, 47), and possibly
beyond 8 weeks as well (48). Benzodiazepines, which act as
GABA-A agonists, are highly versatile medications that can be
prescribed for a wide range of conditions including alcohol
withdrawal, agitation or aggression, anesthesia, catatonia, mania,
insomnia, muscle spasms, epilepsy or seizures, and REM sleep
behavior and movement disorders (44). Although some reports
suggest a potential risk of dementia associated with the chronic
use of benzodiazepines, these have been called into question
and it appears there is not an increased risk of neurocognitive
disorders (49). Benzodiazepines are no longer considered ﬁrst-
line monotherapy for PD or other anxiety disorders but can
be used in the short-term on either a standing or as-needed
basis for PD, GAD, and SAD in conjunction with SSRIs and
SNRIs (Table 1) (14–16). Caution is needed in children, geriatric
patients, those with medical comorbidities, and individuals
with substance use disorders, especially those using other
central nervous system depressants like opioids and/or alcohol.
Additionally, chronic use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety
with comorbid depression may result in reduced eﬃcacy of
antidepressants (50).

Anticonvulsants, some of which have GABAergic properties,
tiagabine,
include medications like pregabalin, gabapentin,
lamotrigine, and topiramate. There is scant research on the use
of this class of medications for anxiety disorders (51), with the
strongest evidence for the use of pregabalin in GAD, including a
meta-analysis of multiple RCTs reporting superiority to placebo
and comparable eﬀects to benzodiazepines (52). Pregabalin is
thought to have anti-epileptic eﬀects by its activity on the alpha-
2 delta subunit of calcium channels to reduce neurotransmitter
release (51). Pregabalin has FDA approvals for neuropathic
pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, ﬁbromyalgia, and as an adjunctive
treatment for partial seizures. It was approved for GAD by the
European Union in 2006, although since it was not approved by
the FDA in the United States in 2009 the FDA application was
withdrawn in 2010. Pregabalin was also shown to have potential
eﬃcacy in SAD (53), but only at doses of 450 or 600 mg, based on
three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (54–
56). Pregabalin is generally well-tolerated, with the most common
adverse eﬀects being sedation, dizziness, and weight gain. Since
there is the potential for abuse and dependence with pregabalin,
it is listed as a Schedule V medication by the United States Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA), and providers need to be
mindful of tapering the medication to prevent withdrawal, and
to monitor prescribing in patients with substance use problems,
especially opioids, for which there is an increased risk of overdose
death (57–59).

acts

Gabapentin, much like pregabalin,

to modulate
neurotransmitter release on voltage-dependent calcium channels
(51). It is FDA-approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain,
post-herpetic neuralgia, and partial seizures, but has been widely
used oﬀ-label for various indications including ﬁbromyalgia.
There is increasing evidence for its use in alcohol use disorder,

Current and Novel Anxiety Medications

primarily for the treatment of withdrawal (60). Gabapentin
has also been prescribed oﬀ-label for anxiety despite a lack of
research evidence supporting such use (61). It was found to
be eﬃcacious in a small (N = 69) randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study in SAD (62). Another RCT of patients
with PD found a diﬀerence between gabapentin and placebo
but only in patients with severe panic symptoms (62). A third
study found that gabapentin may help with anxiety related to
public speaking (63). There are also several trials of gabapentin
showing eﬃcacy in perioperative anxiety (61). Gabapentin has
similar adverse eﬀects as pregabalin including sedation, dry
mouth, constipation, weight gain, and pedal edema. Although
gabapentin is not listed as a DEA controlled substance in the
US, it may vary on how it is scheduled between states, and there
is, like pregabalin, a risk of withdrawal and abuse potential,
meaning caution must be used when prescribing this medication
to patients taking opioids or those with substance use disorders
(57, 59, 64). There are currently no known ongoing trials of
gabapentin for anxiety disorders.

Another anticonvulsant, tiagabine, is FDA-approved for the
treatment of partial seizures and has been shown to have potential
anxiolytic eﬀects in preclinical studies (65). Its mechanism of
action is unknown, although it is thought to increase GABA
activity by inhibiting GABA uptake in presynaptic neurons (51).
While there have been promising open-label studies for PD,
GAD, and PTSD (51), several RCTs do not support the eﬃcacy of
tiagabine in GAD (66) or PD (67). A small, randomized, double-
blind crossover study with gabapentin and tiagabine in SAD
reported that both drugs may be eﬀective in reducing anxiety
scores (68). There are no known active studies of tiagabine in
anxiety disorders.

shown to have anxiolytic properties

Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant thought to inhibit voltage-
dependent sodium channels causing decreased glutamate release
(51). It is FDA-approved for the maintenance treatment of
bipolar I disorder and for several types of seizure disorders.
in
Lamotrigine was
preclinical studies (69). There are, however, very few studies
of
lamotrigine in anxiety disorders. One small case series
reported improvement in symptoms in PD with agoraphobia
(70). To date, no studies of lamotrigine for anxiety disorders
are underway. Other anticonvulsants, like topiramate (thought to
inhibit voltage-dependent calcium sodium channels to enhance
GABA, block glutamate and inhibit carbonic anhydrase) have
very limited data (51), mostly in open-label trials for SAD
listed on the Clinical Trials
(71), although there is a trial
database for topiramate augmentation in treatment-refractory
SAD (NCT00182455). There is only one known RCT of
valproate, also known as valproic acid (which blocks voltage-
dependent sodium channels and is thought to increase GABA by
inhibiting glutamate-mediated excitation), in which is primarily
used to treat bipolar disorder (51). In terms of GAD (72), valproic
acid showed separation from placebo, and an open-label trial in
SAD suggesting potential eﬃcacy (73). Levetiracetam, approved
only for seizure disorders (and with unclear mechanism, but
thought to reduce hyperexcitation of brain cells through binding
to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, but to not interfere with
normal electrical activity) (51), has undergone two RCTs for SAD

in which the medication failed to show a statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerence compared to placebo (74, 75). There are no known
RCTs of carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine in anxiety disorders.

Antihistamines
Hydroxyzine is the most studied antihistamine for anxiety
and the only antihistamine which is FDA-approved for use
in anxiety. Antihistamines like hydroxyzine are histamine-1
receptor (H1) blockers that are commonly used as alternatives
to benzodiazepines for anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia, in
both inpatient and outpatient settings (76). Hydroxyzine and
other antihistamines like diphenhydramine may also be safer
to use in children and adolescents and in pregnant women.
There is, however, concern about the risk of anticholinergic
toxicity or delirium in the elderly or patients with neurocognitive
disorders. Antihistamines are generally well-tolerated, aside from
adverse eﬀects like dry mouth, constipation, sedation, and risks
of use while driving. The primary drawback to this medication
class is that patients tend to develop tolerance to antihistamines
over time. A Cochrane review of 39 studies of GAD reported
that hydroxyzine was superior to placebo and comparable to
benzodiazepines and buspirone but the authors cited a high risk
of study bias and concerns about sedation with hydroxyzine (76).
To date, there have not been RCTs of hydroxyzine done in SAD
and PD.

Alpha- and Beta-Adrenergic Agents
Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist that is FDA-approved
for multiple indications including hypertension, angina, atrial
ﬁbrillation and arrhythmias, migraine prophylaxis, and essential
tremor (77). Although it is not approved for any psychiatric
it has been widely prescribed for SAD and
indications,
performance anxiety. There is, however, a lack of research
support for the use of propranolol in anxiety disorders (77)
although it may still have a role in certain task-speciﬁc anxieties
(78). Evidence for the use of other beta-blockers like pindolol in
anxiety is sparse.

Clonidine and guanfacine are alpha-2 adrenergic receptor
agonists FDA-approved for the treatment of hypertension (79,
80). Extended-release formulations of guanfacine and clonidine
are also approved for ADHD in children and adolescents and
clonidine is also approved for adjunctive use of cancer pain
and is used oﬀ-label for management of opioid withdrawal.
Clonidine has been studied previously as a research drug on the
noradrenergic system in GAD and PD but was not found to have
much utility in clinical settings (79, 81, 82). There have been no
further RCTs of clonidine in anxiety disorders other than studies
of the drug as pre-medication for children for preoperative
anxiety (83). Both clonidine and guanfacine may have limited
practical use in anxious patients given the lack of proven eﬃcacy
and concerns about hypotension and sedation.

Antipsychotics
There is currently only one antipsychotic, triﬂuoperazine, a
ﬁrst-generation antipsychotic (FGA), which is FDA-approved
for the treatment of anxiety. In spite of this, antipsychotics,
most of which are dopamine-2 (D2) receptor antagonists, have

Current and Novel Anxiety Medications

been utilized on an oﬀ-label basis for multiple indications
other than psychosis including anxiety (84). Several systematic
reviews of antipsychotics in anxiety have reported that the
majority of studies were of quetiapine, a second-generation
antipsychotic (also with antagonism of the 5-HT2 and H1
in GAD, and showed the potential utility of
receptors),
quetiapine monotherapy in GAD despite poor tolerability (85,
86). The Canadian guidelines for anxiety and related disorders
recommend olanzapine (D2, 5-HT2 and H1 antagonist),
aripiprazole (a partial D2 and 5-HT1A agonist and 5HT2A
antagonist) and risperidone (D2, and 5-HT2 antagonist), as
augmentation strategies for GAD and PD (87). Risperidone
and aripiprazole are also recommended as adjunctive drugs
in the treatment of SAD (87). There is reasonable concern
about the short- and long-term risks of using antipsychotics in
anxiety disorders. First, there are limited studies to date in other
anxiety disorders such as SAD and PD (85, 88). Second, it is
unclear whether patients receive appropriate psychoeducation
about the risks of tardive dyskinesia, extrapyramidal symptoms,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, weight gain, and metabolic
syndrome. Further large-scale research and longitudinal studies
of antipsychotics in anxiety are needed before these medications
can be recommended.

NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR ANXIETY
DISORDERS

The focus of research on the pharmacotherapy of anxiety
disorders has shifted from serotonin, norepinephrine and GABA
systems to other neurotransmitters and pathways including
glutamate and neuropeptides (89). Presented below is a review
of recent and ongoing studies of medications for GAD, PD, and
SAD. A summary of the ﬁndings is on Table 2.

Serotonergic Agents
The serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] system has been
studied extensively in the etiology of anxiety and anxiety
disorders, and the primary ﬁrst-line pharmacotherapeutic agents
including SSRIs, SNRIs, and
for anxiety are serotonergic,
azapirones like buspirone. There has been work on developing
agents that work on several 5-HT receptors and may mimic the
eﬀects of SSRIs but with more favorable side eﬀect proﬁles. For
example, vilazodone, listed as an SSRI while also having partial
agonistic properties on 5-HT1A, was approved by the FDA for
the treatment of MDD in 2011 and it also has been studied in
GAD and SAD (90). A meta-analysis of vilazodone for GAD
reported that three 10-week RCTs that found a separation from
placebo (90) but a later meta-analysis did not support the use of
vilazodone in GAD (91). There was also a small pilot randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of vilazodone in adult separation anxiety
disorder which did not show signiﬁcant separation between
drug and placebo at 12 weeks but reported some diﬀerences in
other anxiety measures (92). There has been one randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vilazodone in SAD
which showed potential eﬃcacy and promise (93) and another
study listed as active but not recruiting (NCT01712321). There

are no known studies, active or recruiting, of vilazodone in PD.
Vilazodone may confer beneﬁts over SSRIs, including a possible
lessened risk of sexual dysfunction (94), although gastrointestinal
side eﬀects may limit tolerability. Further comparison studies in
anxiety disorders are needed.

Vortioxetine, a 5-HT3 antagonist and 5-HT1A agonist,
was FDA-approved for MDD in 2013, but its eﬃcacy for
anxiety is not clear (95). Despite initial promise in GAD (96,
97), and an initial meta-analysis recommending further study
(95), two subsequent meta-analyses failed to show signiﬁcant
eﬃcacy of vortioxetine over placebo in GAD despite fairly
good tolerability (91, 98) and thus further study and pursuit
of FDA approval
in GAD was abandoned in 2015. There
was one open-label study of vortioxetine in PD reporting
improvement in panic symptoms (99) but no known RCTs.
There is one study in SAD comorbid with MDD underway
(NCT04220996), but no studies of vortioxetine in other
anxiety disorders.

As noted above, buspirone has been FDA-approved for the
treatment of anxiety, which led to the consideration of other
azapirones (100). Gepirone, an azapirone and a selective 5-
HT1A receptor partial agonist, in its extended-release (ER) form,
has been studied previously as an antidepressant, although it
has been shown to have also anxiolytic properties (101, 102).
Gepirone ER is currently in Phase 2 trials for GAD, MDD,
and hypoactive sexual desire disorder (103). Tandospirone, yet
another azapirone studied for depression and anxiety, showed
promise in reducing anxiety in patients with anxious depression
(104, 105). There was one completed trial of tandospirone in
GAD but no published results yet (NCT01614041). There are
also no recent or active, ongoing studies of other azapirones such
as ipsapirone or lesopitron. In terms of non-azapirone 5-HT1A
agonists, PRX-00023 was studied in GAD in a RCT and, despite
good tolerability, it did not show separation from placebo on
endpoint anxiety (106). Additionally, there are other selective 5-
HT1A partial agonists, such as TGFK08AA, in development for
GAD (89), and TGW00AA (FKW00GA) in Phase 2 studies for
GAD and SAD (107).

Some 5-HT6 receptor antagonists, such as AVN-101 and
AVN-397, have been reported to have anxiolytic properties in
animal studies (108). AVN-101 was shown to be safe and well-
tolerated in Phase 1 studies and is under investigation for
Alzheimer’s Disease and may have potential for study in anxiety
disorders due to its anxiolytic eﬀects (109).

Ondansetron, approved to treat nausea and vomiting, is a
selective 5-HT3 antagonist that was found to improve anxiety in
a small RCT in GAD (110) and an open-label trial in PD (111).
There have, however, been no further studies of ondansetron
in anxiety disorders, with the only recent and current studies
focused on its use in OCD and tic-related disorders.

Agomelatine, a melatonin-1/melatonin-2 agonist and 5-
HT2C receptor antagonist, has been studied more extensively
in depression, although it was also found to have anxiolytic
properties (112). Based on several RCTs including comparisons
with escitalopram (113–117), a meta-analysis of treatments
for GAD determined that agomelatine was well-tolerated and
potentially eﬃcacious with the caveat of small sample sizes (91).

Despite its apparent positive response in GAD, there are no
known controlled studies of agomelatine in PD or SAD or any
known ongoing trials in anxiety disorders.

Finally, it is worthwhile to discuss hallucinogens, which act on
serotonin receptors, and their anxiolytic potential. Psilocybin (4-
phosphoryloxy-N,N-DMT) is an indolealkylamine derived from
mushrooms that causes perceptual changes in humans (altered
thinking, synesthesia, illusions) and is listed as a DEA Schedule
I controlled substance. It has been shown to have the potential
to reduce anxiety, with several completed RCTs of psilocybin
in cases of “life-threatening anxiety” (patients with anxiety who
have life-threatening diseases like cancer) (118). Lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) is a widely abused hallucinogen with similar
eﬀects as psilocybin and is also a Schedule I drug. Prior evidence
for the use of LSD in anxiety is less robust and favors its use
in alcohol use disorder (119). There is an active clinical trial
of psilocybin in cancer-related anxiety (NCT00957359) and a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing LSD
in patients with anxiety with or without life-threatening diseases
(NCT03153579). The diﬃculties regulating Schedule I drugs

may limit whether hallucinogens have potential for widespread
clinical application.

promising. For example, LY354740, an mGluR 2-3 agonist,
did not separate from placebo in a randomized controlled
comparison study with paroxetine (121) in patients with PD.
After studies with LY354740 were halted due to concerns about
bioavailability, LY544344, a pro-drug of LY354740, was studied
for GAD in an 8-week randomized placebo-controlled trial
with reported eﬃcacy but the study was halted due to concerns
about convulsive activity in preclinical trials (122). JNJ-40411813

studied in a RCT for anxious depression but did not show
eﬃcacy (123).

Ketamine, originally developed as an anesthetic, has shown
rapid and robust antidepressant eﬀects in multiple randomized
controlled clinical trials. The majority of these studies have tested
the safety and eﬃcacy of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of the
ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD),
most commonly at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (124–127). Subsequent
studies provide evidence for a favorable safety and eﬃcacy proﬁle
of repeated doses of ketamine administered over several weeks
(128–130). It should be noted that the use of IV ketamine for
TRD is oﬀ-label and there is currently a lack of data concerning
the longer-term safety and eﬃcacy of this approach (124, 131).
Ketamine exists as a 1:1 racemic mixture of R-ketamine and
S-ketamine. In 2019, an intranasal (IN) form of S-ketamine
(“esketamine”) gained approval from the FDA for the treatment
of MDD in adults with treatment-resistant depression (132).
Buoyed by these observations in depression, recent studies have
examined the tolerability and potential eﬃcacy of ketamine in
anxiety disorders, based on preclinical observations (133).

An early study reported the beneﬁt of daily oral ketamine
on symptoms of both depression and anxiety in adults in
hospice care (134). A small open-label study suggested beneﬁt
of ketamine administered subcutaneously in a single ascending
dose design in patients with refractory SAD and/or GAD (135).
The same group showed preliminary beneﬁt of ketamine 1
mg/kg injected subcutaneously dosed once or twice weekly for
3 months among patients who had responded in the initial
ascending dose study (136). More recently, a double-blind RCT
of intravenously administered ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg compared
to saline placebo showed beneﬁt in patients with SAD measured
using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) (137). There are
no known ongoing trials of ketamine in PD, GAD, or SAD.

Riluzole, a glutamate modulator approved for the treatment
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also has been studied
previously as an adjunctive agent in TRD (138–140). Animal
studies supported the eﬃcacy of riluzole in models of anxiety
(141, 142). To date, there is only one trial of riluzole in anxiety
disorders which was an open-label study of 18 participants
with GAD. The trial reported response or remission in a
majority of patients, as measured on the Hamilton Anxiety
Scale, although the results are limited by the lack of a control
group and the small number of participants (143). Subsequent
functional neuroimaging studies of open-label riluzole in GAD
reported that patients experienced changes in hippocampal
volumes and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations which
correlated with improvement on anxiety scales compared
with healthy volunteers (144, 145). An analog of riluzole,
troriluzole (BHV-4157), underwent a Phase III trial in GAD
which has been completed although the results have not been
published (NCT03829241).

There are several animal studies of AMPA modulators,
including PEPA, primarily in fear extinction models of anxiety,
showing positive anxiolytic eﬀects (146). One AMPA modulator,
Org 26576, has been studied for MDD (147). To date, however,
there are no known studies in the pipeline for AMPA modulators
for anxiety disorders.

D-cycloserine (DCS), an NMDA partial agonist, is among the
most widely studied glutamatergic agents in anxiety (148). D-
cycloserine is unique in that research to date has focused on
the eﬀects of DCS on anxiety in the context of psychotherapy
or fear learning. In animal and human studies, DCS has been
shown to facilitate fear extinction (148). Although not known to
be eﬃcacious as a monotherapy (149), DCS at a low dose of 50
mg/day (which is largely an NMDA agonist) has been successfully
used in augmentation of exposure therapy or CBT, including
reducing anxiety in persons performing cognitive tasks (150)
and facilitating declarative learning (151) by reducing reactivity
to phobic stimuli in persons with speciﬁc phobia on functional
MRI (152). D-cycloserine has been studied for augmentation
of psychotherapy in PD, SAD, and speciﬁc phobias. A 2015
Cochrane review reported no diﬀerence between DCS and
placebo in augmentation of cognitive and behavioral therapies
in anxiety and related disorders at study endpoint or follow
up,
in both children and adolescents (153). A 2017 meta-
analysis of DCS in anxiety disorders found a small diﬀerence
between DCS and placebo post-treatment but minimal gains
on follow-up treatments (154). Subsequent studies of DCS
augmentation in PD have been mixed (155, 156). In SAD,
despite earlier studies showing promise for the use of DCS
augmentation of exposure therapy (157–159), there have been
far less encouraging ﬁndings in subsequent studies (157, 160–
162). Studies of DCS in SP, including acrophobia and spider
phobia, have yielded inconsistent but mostly negative ﬁndings
for DCS compared to placebo (163–167). There are no active
clinical trials of DCS augmentation in PD, GAD, SAD, or SP. On
balance, while initial studies of DCS showed promise for use in
augmentation of psychotherapies, subsequent larger-scale studies
have been disappointing.

Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist FDA-approved
for the treatment of Alzheimer dementia, moderate-severe,
was tested previously in preclinical studies as a potential
antidepressant (168). One study reported minimal improvement
in seven patients with GAD, while 10 participants with OCD
experienced modest beneﬁt (169). There are no known active
studies of memantine for anxiety disorders.

Finally, nitrous oxide (N2O), an inhaled anesthetic most often
used in dental procedures, is a NMDA receptor antagonist (170).
Nitrous oxide can be used recreationally and has been associated
with potential neurologic and psychiatric adverse eﬀects (171).
There also has been some study of N2O for the treatment of
alcohol withdrawal (172) and a proof-of-concept study in MDD
(173). Although there is literature on using N2O for the treatment
of dental phobia and other procedure-related anxiety (174),
there is, to date, no known past or current study of N2O as a
pharmacologic treatment of PD, GAD, or SAD.

GABAergic Medications
Given how eﬃcacious benzodiazepines (GABA-A agonists) are
for the treatment of anxiety disorders, and how there may be
potential beneﬁts with pregabalin and gabapentin, there has
been an eﬀort to ﬁnd novel GABAergic anxiolytic agents. To
date, however, several GABA-A receptor subtype agonists have
either failed to reach market due to lack of eﬃcacy or poor

tolerability (89, 175). AZD7325, a GABA-A alpha-2-3 modulator,
failed to separate from placebo in a Phase 2 comparative trial
with placebo and alprazolam for GAD (NCT00808249). PF-
06372865, a GABA-A positive allosteric modulator, tested at two
doses, failed to separate from placebo as an adjunctive treatment
in patients with GAD (176). On an encouraging note, BNC-
210 (IW-2143), an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor–negative
allosteric modulator which also modulates the GABA receptor,
was reported to result in reduced amygdalar activation to fearful
faces compared to placebo and comparably to lorazepam, in
patients with GAD (177). Although it is unknown how many
GABA modulators are being studied in anxiety, preclinical
research suggests that several agents may be in the pipeline
(178). For instance, SAGE-217 is a GABA-A positive allosteric
modulator that is under Phase III study for MDD and postpartum
depression and is being explored for treatment of GAD (179,
180). Finally, phytochemical (herbal) compounds that have
GABAergic properties are also under investigation (see “Natural
Remedies” section below).

Neuropeptides
Neuropeptides are small proteins that work as neuronal signaling
molecules and are involved in an array of brain functions such
as analgesia, reward systems, social behaviors,
learning, and
memory. In addition, speciﬁc neuropeptides such as oxytocin,
substance P, neuropeptide Y (NPY), arginine vasopressin (AVP),
and cholecystokinin (CCK) play signiﬁcant roles in modulating
fear and anxiety.

Oxytocin is a neuropeptide involved in attachment and pro-
social behaviors. Due to its poor absorption in the digestive tract,
oxytocin must be administered either intravenously, intranasally
or sublingually, where it
is well-tolerated with no known
serious adverse eﬀects (181). Studies have shown that in healthy
adults, oxytocin has positive eﬀects on emotion modulation
(182), and that low oxytocin has been associated with high
anxiety (183). Animal studies suggest that oxytocin has anxiolytic
eﬀects and human research suggests that oxytocin may increase
anxiety acutely. For example, a double-blind, placebo-controlled
study of intranasal oxytocin on single-session exposure-based
psychotherapy for arachnophobia found that oxytocin impaired
treatment response compared to placebo (184). Overall, however,
oxytocin may have overall positive eﬀects on anxiety depending
on the frequency and context of administration (183). Research
on oxytocin for the treatment of anxiety disorders has been
focused on SAD (185, 186), with studies reporting increasing
amygdalar-prefrontal activity in response to emotional faces
(187), and enhancing prosocial behaviors (188). Although
there is a large body of research on the use of oxytocin for
augmentation of antipsychotics in schizophrenia (189), several
of these trials have been called into question (190) due to
study design and sample size and there has been controversy
about whether oxytocin can be absorbed into the brain with
intranasal administration or if peripheral levels reﬂect central
activity (191). Currently, there is one known study evaluating
intranasal oxytocin in patients suﬀering from acute anxiety and
depression during psychiatric hospitalization (NCT03566069).

Substance P is one of the major neuropeptides found in
the nervous system (192). Given its abundance in the fear
center of the brain, Substance P and its neurokinin receptor
system have been a great topic of interest in anxiety disorder
research (193). Despite ample research interest, several trials have
failed to demonstrate the eﬃcacy of Substance P in reducing
symptoms of anxiety disorders (194, 195), which has led to
a decrease in pharmaceutical studies (193). A recent study
conducted by Frick et al. (196) however, found that individuals
with SAD demonstrated more NK1 receptor availability in
the right amygdala when compared to healthy controls. This
ﬁnding highlights the need for further research on utilizing NK1
receptor antagonists for the treatment of some anxiety disorders.
Currently, there are not any ongoing clinical studies that evaluate
the use of Substance P for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Neuropeptide Y is one of the most abundant neuropeptides
in the brain and numerous reports have found that NPY is
critical for the stress adaptation process (197). In humans,
NPY has been closely linked to trauma. Most recently, a small
RCT of intranasally administered NPY in patients with MDD
showed potential beneﬁt for depression (198). A study conducted
by Sayed et al. found that intranasally administered NPY was
associated with greater treatment response and improvement in
anxiety ratings when compared to placebo in individuals with
PTSD (199). This ﬁnding encourages future research that studies
the safety and eﬃcacy of NPY as an anxiolytic treatment. There
are however no active trials of NPY in GAD, PD, or SAD.

Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) has been shown in animal
models to be related to anxiety responses and vasopressin V1a
and V1b receptor antagonists may have anxiolytic properties
(200, 201). Few human studies of V1 antagonists have been
published. Griebel et al. (202) compared the vasopressin V1b
antagonist, SSR149415, in a randomized, double-blind study,
to escitalopram, paroxetine and placebo, in MDD and GAD,
reporting that SSR149415 did not diﬀerentiate from placebo
in outcome measures for GAD. Conversely, studies conducted
by Fabio et al. (203), and Lee et al. (204) have shown safety
and promise of V1a receptor SRX246 as an anxiolytic, with
an active study of this compound in an experimental model
of anxiety in humans (NCT02922166). There are currently no
known clinical trials studying V1a antagonists in the treatment
of anxiety disorders.

animal models (208). The results from preliminary research
in anxiety disorders, however, have been disappointing (209).
One randomized, double-blind trial of the CRF-1 antagonist,
pexacerfont
(BMS-562086), compared to escitalopram and
placebo for the treatment of GAD, found that it did not separate
from placebo (210). There are also completed, but not published,
studies for SAD comparing CRF-1 antagonists verucerfont
(GSK561679) and emicerfont (GW876008) to alprazolam and
placebo (NCT00555139), and a Phase 2 trial of patients
with GAD comparing GW876008 to paroxetine and placebo
(NCT00397722). Research on CRF-1 antagonists appears to have
shifted toward addiction with recent trials of pexacerfont and
verucerfont in alcohol use disorder (211, 212). There are no
known active trials of CRF-1 antagonists in anxiety disorders.

Orexin, also known as hypocretin,

is a neuropeptide
associated with arousal, appetite, and wakefulness (213). Orexin
is also thought to play a role in stress response with alterations
in orexin found in depression and anxiety (214). Based on
the research ﬁnding that orexin levels are increased in CSF of
individuals with PD (215), orexin is thought to have anxiogenic
eﬀects, leading to research on orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptor,
and dual-receptor antagonists for treatment of anxiety disorders
(216). Suvorexant, an orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptor antagonist,
is FDA-approved for primary insomnia, and is under study in
PD, comparing the drug to placebo to monitor orexin levels and
response to a carbon dioxide challenge (NCT02593682). There
are no other known ongoing studies of orexin antagonists in
anxiety disorders.

In summary, neuropeptides appear to be a promising
emerging ﬁeld for the treatment of anxiety disorders but there
no clear therapeutic candidates for anxiety disorder have been
identiﬁed as of yet.

endogenously modulate neuronal excitability by interacting
with GABA-A, NMDA, and glutamate receptors (217). Both
preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated evidence
of aberrant neurosteroid homeostasis in anxiety disorders
(218). The antidepressant eﬀects of SSRIs have been shown to
correlate with increased brain and cerebrospinal ﬂuid levels
of allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid with potent modulatory
activity on GABA-A receptors (219). Because of their ability to
rapidly control the excitability of the central nervous system,
there has been increasing interest in the role of neurosteroids as
novel treatments for anxiety disorders. To date, two compounds
with neurosteroidal activity, mifepristone (RU486) and PH94B,
have been investigated for the treatment of anxiety symptoms.

RU486 is a progesterone inhibitor used for early pregnancy
termination (220). It is a glucocorticoid antagonist and has been
studied for MDD with psychotic features, improving cognition
in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and for the
treatment of PTSD. A 12-week, pilot clinical trial assessed the
eﬀect of mifepristone in older adults as a treatment for anxiety
disorders with co-morbid cognitive dysfunction (220). The study
included 15 older adults (ages 60 years and older) with an anxiety

disorder (GAD, PD, or anxiety disorder not otherwise speciﬁed).
Subjects were randomized to either mifepristone 300 mg daily or
placebo for the ﬁrst week of the study. After the ﬁrst week, all
patients received treatment with mifepristone 300 mg daily for
an additional 3 weeks. At the end of week 4, mifepristone was
discontinued, and follow-up assessments of memory, executive
function, and anxiety were completed at week 12. Subjects with
higher baseline cortisol levels had improvements in memory,
executive function, and anxiety, while those with low or normal
baseline cortisol levels experienced little to no mifepristone-
related improvement. There are no active studies of mifepristone
in anxiety disorders.

PH94B, an intranasally administered neurosteroidal aerosol,
has been investigated for the acute treatment of SAD. In a phase
2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
single-dose study, 91 females (ages 19–60 years) with SAD were
randomized to receive either placebo or PH94B nasal spray
15 min prior to a public speaking or social interaction challenge
under laboratory settings (221). Seventy-ﬁve percent of the
subjects who received PH94B were considered responders [either
“much” or “very much improved” as measured by the Clinical
Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I)], compared with 37%
of the subjects who received placebo. There were no diﬀerences
in adverse events reported by the PH94B and placebo groups.
A second study assessed the use of PH94B for the treatment of
symptoms of SAD in real-world settings in a pilot, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (222). Twenty-two males
and females (ages 18–65 years) with SAD were randomized to
either placebo or PH94 nasal spray. The subjects were instructed
to self-administer the nasal spray 15 min prior to a distressing
social interaction or performance, up to four times per day.
PH94B was superior to placebo in decreasing mean peak levels
of symptoms of social anxiety, as measured by subject-reported
subjective units of distress (SUDs). The results of an open-
label study of PH94B for the treatment of adjustment disorder
with anxiety symptoms in adults which has planned to begin
enrollment in 2020 will be of great interest (NCT04404192).

Alpha- and Beta-Adrenergic Agents
As noted above, clonidine may be used oﬀ-label for anxiety
but there have been no recent clinical studies of clonidine in
anxiety disorders. There are no current drug trials of clonidine
in PD, SAD, GAD, or SP. One RCT of guanfacine ER in children
and adolescents (ages 8–17 years) with GAD, separation anxiety
disorder, and SAD reported that the medication was safe and
well-tolerated but it is unclear whether it is eﬃcacious (80). To
date, there are also no known active studies of guanfacine in
anxiety disorders. As noted earlier, there is currently limited
active investigation of propranolol for anxiety disorders outside
of
the extensive research done on memory consolidation
and PTSD.

Cannabinoids
In many parts of the world, cannabis is consumed for its
euphoric and relaxing eﬀects. There is a widespread belief
that cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids
are harmless substances and can lower anxiety and induce

Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org

Garakani et al.

Current and Novel Anxiety Medications

relaxation. However, the literature does not support the belief
that cannabinoids are safe for patients with anxiety disorders,
nor does it support the notion that cannabinoids improve anxiety
and related symptoms in those patients. The quality of evidence
currently available from clinical trials with cannabinoids and
anxiety is very low. This is in part because most of the studies
included participants with a primary diagnosis of chronic non-
cancer pain, multiple sclerosis or ﬁbromyalgia, rather than
anxiety disorders. Other limitations of these studies include small
sample size and other methodological ﬂaws (223).

Endogenous and exogenous

cannabinoids act on the
cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, serotonergic type 1A
(5HT1A) receptor and the transient receptor potential vanilloid
type 1 (TRPV1) receptor. Cannabinoid type 1 receptor agonists
have a biphasic eﬀect: they have anxiolytic properties in low
doses and anxiogenic properties in high doses. While the
activation of the CB1 receptor produces inhibitory eﬀect in
the neuron, leading to an anxiolytic eﬀect, high doses of CB1
receptor agonists induce activation of TRPV1 receptor, which
produces anxiogenic eﬀects (224). Several drugs that act as
5HT1A receptor agonists proved to be eﬀective in the treatment
of anxiety disorders; recent studies indicate that cannabidiol and
other cannabinoids also act on the 5HT1A receptor, potentially
resulting in anxiolytic eﬀects (224).

The most studied cannabinoid in anxiety is CBD. Preclinical
animal model studies and human trials indicate that CBD is
a potentially eﬀective treatment for PD, GAD, and SAD (224).
In the study from Bergamaschi et al. (225), the authors found
that the administration of a single dose of CBD (600 mg)
successfully attenuated the anxiety response to a public speaking
test in subjects with SAD. In another study, the same research
team found that a single 400 mg dose of CBD reduced the
anxiety associated with a SPECT scan in patients with SAD
(226). One small RCT which included 37 adolescents with SAD
(CBD n = 17, placebo n = 20) showed promising results
(227). Subjects received 300 mg of CBD or placebo daily for
4 weeks. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) scores
decreased by 16% (P = 0.03) pre- and post-treatment in the
CBD group. The drug-placebo diﬀerence in LSAS was not
statistically signiﬁcant. Currently, there is a RCT with CBD
underway (NCT03549819) with an estimated completion date
of October 2020. Flexibly dosed CBD (200–800 mg/day) will
be administered for 8 weeks to patients with PD, GAD, SAD,
or agoraphobia.

Excessive activity in limbic and paralimbic cortical areas has
been consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety
disorders. The parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus are
thought to play a key role in mediating fear and anxiety. The
public speaking test produces activation of limbic areas in SAD
subjects, but in subjects treated with citalopram there is a
decreased regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) response in the
amygdala, hippocampus, and the periamygdaloid, rhinal and
parahippocampal cortices (228). In the study from Crippa et al.
(226) they found that CBD administration decreased resting
rCBF in the limbic area, namely in the left parahippocampal
gyrus and hippocampus. Although the eﬀects of citalopram and
CBD were similar in some areas, citalopram produced decreased

rCBF in the cingulate gyrus, while CBD produced increased rCBF
in the right posterior cingulate gyrus (226).

The anxiolytic eﬀects observed with CBD are in contrast to
the anxiogenic eﬀects induced by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(229). Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a partial agonist
of the CB1 receptor that can have anxiolytic eﬀect in low doses,
but in high doses can induce anxiety and panic attacks (229). In
a clinical trial for treatment of Tourette syndrome, the authors
found worsening of obsessive-compulsive behavior after the
administration of THC. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in
anxiety scores, but there was a trend of higher phobic anxiety
after administration of THC (230). There are no registered trials
for THC in anxiety disorders.

Dronabinol is a synthetic trans isomer of THC and, compared
to THC has higher aﬃnity to the CB1 receptor (229). Two RCTs
found that dronabinol was eﬀective for treatment for pain, but
neither study found signiﬁcant changes in anxiety scores (231,
232). In the study by Narang et al. two subjects experienced high
anxiety as a side eﬀect of a higher dronabinol dose (20 mg) (232).
There is one registered study listed as withdrawn (NCT03369639)
with dronabinol and anxiety disorders; there are no active studies.
Nabilone is also a synthetic cannabinoid which is similar to
but more potent than THC. It has high aﬃnity to CB1 and CB2
receptors. Four studies assessed the eﬀects of nabilone in pain as
a primary outcome and anxiety as a secondary outcome (233–
236). One RCT (233) which included subjects with neuropathic
pain demonstrated that nabilone was eﬀective for the treatment
of pain but did not produce any changes in anxiety. In the
study by Toth et al. 1–4 mg/day of nabilone was eﬀective in
relieving pain, improving disturbed sleep, reducing anxiety, and
increasing the quality of life of patients with diabetic peripheral
neuropathic pain (236). Skrabek et al. (235) also found that
nabilone produced improvement of pain, decreased anxiety, and
increased quality of life in ﬁbromyalgia patients. In patients with
chronic headache, nabilone was more eﬀective than ibuprofen
for pain management, but there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in anxiety scores (234). In the ﬁrst of two small clinical trials
(237), patients with either GAD or “anxiety neuroses” received
placebo or nabilone over four sessions, 7 days apart. Anxiolytic
eﬀects were observed only in a small portion of the patients. In
another study, 25 patients with anxiety received 2–10 mg/day of
nabilone for 28 days and had signiﬁcant improvement of anxiety
in an open-label phase (238). In the RCT phase of the same
study, patients received nabilone 3 mg/day for 28 days and the
improvement in the nabilone group was superior to the placebo
group. Side eﬀects included drowsiness, dry mouth, and dry eyes.
Signiﬁcant improvements in anxiety scores were also noted in
a cross-over comparison of nabilone (1–2.5 mg twice daily) and
placebo in 11 anxious patients (239). There are currently no
registered clinical trials assessing nabilone in anxiety disorders.

Preparations including both THC and CBD (THC-CBD)
have been tested as treatments for pain in two RCTs. In two
small RCTs which included patients with multiple sclerosis,
THC-CBD did not increase or decrease anxiety (240, 241).
In one of those studies (240), THC-CBD was eﬀective in the
treatment of pain and sleep disturbances, while in the second
study (241) THC-CBD was not eﬀective for pain. In a RCT

Current and Novel Anxiety Medications

of THC-CBD for the treatment of Huntington’s Disease (242),
there were no signiﬁcant improvements of motor, cognitive,
behavioral, and functional scores. Also, there were no signiﬁcant
changes in anxiety scores. There are no registered trials for
THC-CBD in anxiety disorders, but there is one trial underway
(NCT03491384) assessing the eﬀect of recreational cannabis use
on anxiety symptoms.

Regarding the safety of cannabinoids, currently there are no
studies showing that CBD or nabilone increase anxiety or cause
panic attacks, suggesting that these medications are safe for
patients with anxiety disorders. However, THC and dronabinol
are likely not safe drugs for these patients because they can induce
anxiety and panic attacks depending on the doses and individual
predispositions of each patient. In conclusion, cannabidiol and
nabilone are the most promising cannabinoids in the treatment
of anxiety disorders, but the level of evidence for these drugs
is still very low. Overall, THC, THC-CBD and dronabinol
seem to be ineﬀective and potentially harmful for subjects with
anxiety disorders.

Natural Remedies
There has been increased study of herbal medications for
depression and anxiety, with over 30 medications having been
tested in some capacity over the past 15 year (243). Despite
this burgeoning interest in natural agents, the data for most of
them remains sparse. The most widely studied herbal compound
is kava, a plant containing kavapyrones, which are thought to
exert anxiolytic eﬀects through activity on sodium and calcium
channels or most likely from action on GABA-A receptors (like
benzodiazepines) (244). A Cochrane meta-analysis of RCTs of
kava in anxiety disorders, published in 2003, reported reductions
in anxiety scores and separation from placebo (245). A more
recent analysis was more conservative and noted that kava could
be recommended for short-term use in anxiety but should not
replace longer-term medications (246), while another review
concluded that, given insuﬃcient evidence, kava could not be
recommended for GAD (247). All the above reviews also noted
the risk of liver toxicity, including potentially severe liver toxicity,
with the use of kava. There are no known active or upcoming
studies of kava in anxiety disorders.

Several systematic reviews of other herbal compounds for
the treatment of anxiety and anxiety disorders have been
conducted and reported including RCTs for several agents such
as ashwagandha, passionﬂower, galphimia, echinacea, ginkgo,
chamomile, lemon balm, valerian, and lavender (243, 248, 249).
A recent trial compared Galphimine-B (G-B), isolated from
Galphimia (and found in rats to have anxiolytic eﬀect through
inhibition of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental
area), to alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, as a control, in patients
with GAD and reported that G-B had comparable eﬃcacy
to alprazolam with less sedation (250). Although there have
been several positive studies of natural treatments for GAD, in
particular for chamomile (251), the agent with strongest evidence
for use is kava. Currently, there are ongoing clinical trials using
lavender (thought to treat anxiety by inhibiting voltage-gated
calcium channels) for dental (NCT04285385) and pre-operative
anxiety (NCT03445130) and a Phase 2 randomized double-blind

trial comparing galphimia to alprazolam for the treatment of
anxiety (NCT03702803). Although saﬀron (Crocus sativus) has
been studied for depression and anxiety, due to its possible eﬀects
of inhibiting serotonin reuptake in synapses (252), there is only
one listed study, a randomized, double-blind RCT in mild to
moderate GAD, although its status is unknown (NCT02800733).

DISCUSSION

Since this group’s last review of novel therapies for anxiety
disorders in 2014 (253), there has been little headway made
in the development or clinical evaluation of new drugs for
PD, GAD, and SAD. There have been no new medications
approved by the FDA for any anxiety disorder during that
time. Although there have been trials of serotonergic agents
(like vortioxetine and agomelatine), glutamate modulators
(such as riluzole and ketamine), neuropeptides, and even
cannabinoids, very few have advanced to Phase III trials or
have shown real promise for anxiety disorders. This trend lies
in contrast to the greater number of studies taking place for
PTSD, OCD, mood/depressive disorders, and schizophrenia.
Moreover, the ﬁeld lacks data contrasting speciﬁc drugs (or
mechanisms of action) with eﬃcacy, which would be required
to propose rational protocols for the selection of optimally
eﬃcacious treatments.

The traditional areas of research for anxiety included
serotonin, norepinephrine, and GABA, and indeed there
are several drugs recently studied and under investigation
targeting these neurotransmitters. This research, however, has
been built upon the previous success of SSRIs, SNRIs, and
GABAergic agents like benzodiazepines, and, to a lesser extent,
pregabalin and gabapentin, neither of which are approved in
the United States but are prescribed oﬀ-label for anxiety. The
temptation to continue work on these pathways is due to the
acknowledgment that these treatments are eﬀective while failing
to expand beyond this comfort zone. Indeed, the neurobiology of
anxiety has expanded well beyond the research on fear condition,
false suﬀocation alarms, and the neuroendocrine and HPA-axis
models of panic and fear. The early neurocircuitry models of
anxiety were based on pre-clinical research and cast a wide net,
including PTSD in those models. It is now better understood
how much heterogeneity exists between PTSD and other anxiety
disorders and even in the class of anxiety disorders, among
PD, SAD, and GAD (11). While neuroimaging studies in the
last two decades have led to a reﬁned understanding of brain
circuits involved in fear and anxiety, this knowledge has not
yet translated in insights leading to novel treatments (with the
exception, perhaps, of attempts to use transcranial magnetic
stimulation to modulate anxiety and fear circuitry) (254). This is
also because in general pharmacotherapies are less clearly related
to the functioning of speciﬁc brain circuits.

The pursuit of novel pharmacotherapies for anxiety disorders
has been fraught with many complications. The ﬁrst-line
treatments, SSRIs and SNRIs, were originally approved for
depressive disorders and then later for anxiety disorders. There
have been very few drugs developed de novo for anxiety. Studies

of newer agents have been hampered by ﬂawed study designs
such as lack of controls or using placebos instead of comparison
to established medications such as SSRIs or benzodiazepines.
While this may seem like an insurmountable hurdle, there
is hope in that several compounds, including neurosteroids,
neuropeptides, and phytochemicals (herbal compounds), have
shown some potential. It also would help to study medications
speciﬁcally for how the disorder manifests clinically, such as how
PH94B has been investigated for performance anxiety in SAD
by being administered 15 min before the participant is to have
a social interaction or give a performance (222). Although study
designs may be tricky, studying the use of pro re nata (PRN) or
“as-needed” medications may be of more clinical use to patients,
especially given that this is how a signiﬁcant portion of patients
are prescribed benzodiazepines.

Therein lies a second area of concern. Although it has
been assumed that most patients respond to SSRI or SNRI
medications, benzodiazepines, psychological treatments, or some
combination, about one-third of these patients have treatment-
refractory anxiety. There is still little known about treatment
resistance in anxiety disorders and how to treat it eﬀectively. It
also remains unclear how many patients are being treated with
eﬀective doses or being given adequate trials or are potentially
being misdiagnosed or treated with inappropriate regimens.
Anxiety disorders, in addition to their high prevalence, are a
leading cause of disability, which is exacerbated by their high
comorbidity with depression (255). Naturalistic studies may
be needed to understand how to treat anxiety patients with
psychiatric, medical, and substance comorbidities.

Perhaps the clearest

this synopsis is the
intentional omission of psychotherapies for anxiety disorders.
Although their eﬃcacy in PD, GAD, and SAD, has been
documented, this review aimed to focus on pharmacotherapies.
That said,
is impossible to ignore the importance of
therapy-assisted medications such as DCS or potentially even
psychedelic medications. Ideally, such medications could reduce
the distress related to exposure techniques and enhance the
information in anxiety-focused psychotherapy,

it

ultimately increasing its overall eﬃcacy. Such medications are
also important given the lack of access to care and how few
patients are in fact being treated ﬁrst by psychiatrists (for
medication management) and can receive appropriate CBT or
exposure therapies for their anxiety disorders. This is certainly
an area that needs greater investigation. Further research
on augmented psychotherapies should not, however, preclude
the concomitant development of novel pharmacotherapies,
especially given evidence for greater eﬃcacy of pharmacologic
therapies for certain anxiety
treatments over psychological
disorders such as GAD (256).

Since this review did not uncover a wide range of support
for promising pharmacotherapies for anxiety disorders in
development, we need to reconsider what treatments currently
work best, and what areas to focus on going forward. While
developing serotonergic or GABAergic agents with more
favorable side eﬀect proﬁles (compared to SSRIs, SNRIs, and
benzodiazepines, gabapentin and pregabalin) may have some
clinical value, there needs to be further expansion into agents
targeting neuropeptide pathways, glutamate, endocannabinoids,
and multi-modal medications (including phytochemicals and
hallucinogens). These newer compounds may not replace the
current treatments but may over time serve as adjuncts or aid
in therapy, at least until the ﬁeld can develop better biomarkers
and incorporate brain imaging, pharmacogenomic and other
neurobiochemical advances.
In terms of pharmacological
development, it is time for anxiety disorders to catch up to
depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.
