Abstract
Objective The COVID-19 pandemic increased economic, social, and health stressors for families,
yet its impacts on families of youth with chronic conditions, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), are not
well understood. Self-regulation (SR)—or the capacities to control emotions, cognition, and behav-
ior in response to challenge—is known to support T1D management and coping in the face of
stress. Strong SR may have protected youth with T1D from the impacts of pandemic-related stres-
sors. This study compared youth and parent emotional functioning and T1D management before
and after the pandemic’s onset in relation to family pandemic-related stress and youth SR.
Methods
Parents of youth with T1D (N ¼ 88) and a subset of these youth (N ¼ 43; Mean age
15.3 years [SD 2.2]) completed surveys regarding SR, stress, emotional functioning, and T1D-
related functioning prior to and after March 2020. Outcomes were compared using mixed effects
models adjusting for covariates. Family pandemic-related stress experiences and youth SR were
tested as moderators of change. Results Parents’ responsibility for T1D management increased
across pandemic onset and their diabetes-related distress decreased. Family pandemic-related
stress was associated with decreased emotional functioning over time. Youth SR, particularly emo-
tional and behavioral aspects, predicted better emotional and T1D-related functioning.
Discussion While youth with T1D whose families experienced higher pandemic-related stress
had poorer adjustment, strong emotional and behavioral SR appeared to protect against worsen-
ing youth mood and adherence across pandemic onset. Both social-contextual and individual
factors are important to consider when working with families managing T1D.

Introduction

experience mood disturbances

Living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be challenging
for families, particularly in the pre-adolescent and ad-
olescent years. Developmental changes and transitions
in T1D management during this time can make attain-
ing optimal glycemic targets difficult. For example,
youth may
and
diabetes-related distress due to additional burdens as-
sociated with T1D, and parents may worry about
relinquishing control of T1D self-management to their
child (Hilliard et al., 2013). Early to late adolescence
is a period of rapid development in self-regulation
(SR), which includes managing emotional responses to
stress, cognitive capacity to set goals and plan, and be-
havioral control to enact plans (Lansing & Berg,
2014). For youth with T1D, SR skills can allow for in-
creased responsibility in T1D self-management.

The COVID-19 pandemic posed potentially unique
challenges and stressors for youth with T1D. First,
youth with T1D were at increased risk of serious com-
plications and even death if diagnosed with COVID-
19 (Gregory et al., 2021). Second, the pandemic
disrupted systems to deliver diabetes supplies and rou-
tine medical care (e.g. transition to telemedicine visits;
Scott et al., 2020). Youth were also less likely to see
auxiliary supportive members of the health care team
such as school nurses or pediatric psychologists during
the early months of the pandemic (Plevinsky et al.,
2020). Third, emotional support systems were affected
(Magson et al., 2021) due to physical separation from
family and friends during periods with stay at home
restrictions. Lifestyle factors related to T1D manage-
ment changed, such as disruption in grocery shopping,
exercise regimens, parental work schedules and avail-
ability, and sleep schedules. Finally, changes in daily
activities, such as the lack of in-person school or
school-based activities may have altered T1D self-
management routines (Novak et al., 2020; Plevinsky
et al., 2020). Studies of the pandemic’s impact on
youth with T1D and their caregivers have found
mixed results, with some U.S. youth and caregivers
reporting higher stress but also healthier eating habits
(Goethals et al., 2021) and global work finding high
caregiver stress (Alessi et al., 2021), but decreased dia-
betes distress in youth during lockdown (Mianowska
et al., 2021). A recent study of U.S. teens with T1D
found that although youth endorsed high anxiety
about COVID-19, they also reported use of coping
strategies that helped with their anxiety as well as lim-
ited diabetes-specific distress or impacts on diabetes
management (O’Donnell et al., 2022).

Although SR was not measured in these studies, it
may be relevant given evidence of SR as a driver of
youth capacity to manage stress (Buckner et al.,
2009). For youth with T1D, associations of stronger
SR with higher treatment adherence (Lansing & Berg,

Miller et al.

2014), lower family conflict (Vaid et al., 2018), and
better glycemic outcomes (Vaid et al., 2018) under-
score its potential applicability to managing the
challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. SR is a multi-
faceted construct that includes emotional, behavioral,
and cognitive components (Nigg, 2017). One study
identified various youth-reported strategies that may
have helped foster diabetes and general stress resil-
ience during the pandemic; although this study did not
measure youth SR, the strategies noted reflect different
SR skills, for example perspective-taking, distraction,
and stress relieving activities (O’Donnell et al., 2022).
Different aspects of youth SR, specifically the capacity
to manage emotions effectively in response to stress,
cognitive ability to plan and organize, and degree of
control over impulsive behavior, may underlie use of
such strategies and thus function as a protective

Understanding how each aspect of SR may underlie
these outcomes may be important in providing clinical
guidance for youth and families in coping with
stressors.

Furthermore, family diabetes management during
adolescence is a dynamic process that has been charac-
terized as interdependent between parent and child,
with roles in T1D management changing over time
with increasing youth SR capacity (Berg et al., 2017).
Given parents’ integral role in family diabetes manage-
ment, it is reasonable to expect that youth SR may
thus not only be protective for youth, but also for
parents who are coping with stress and challenges to
youth T1D self-management. Indeed, developmental
studies suggest that child behavior and parent emo-
functioning are mutually influential across
tional
childhood, with effects of child behaviors such as ex-
ternalizing on parent responses becoming stronger
over time (Mackler et al., 2015). Therefore, we con-
sidered how pandemic-related family stress and youth
SR related to changes in both youth and parent emo-
tional functioning and youth T1D self-management
across the onset of the pandemic.

and T1D self-management across the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the degree to which fami-
lies’ pandemic-related stress and youth SR buffered or
exacerbated changes. The emphasis on youth SR
extends prior research on pandemic impacts on youth
with T1D (Goethals et al., 2021; O’Donnell et al.,
2022) by studying a dynamic developmental factor
with clinical
intervention implications. Changes in
youth and parent emotional functioning and youth
T1D self-management were examined from prior to
during the pandemic among two samples of U.S.

youth with T1D and their parents. We hypothesized
that declines in emotional functioning and T1D self-
management would be greater in families reporting
more pandemic-related stress and that stronger pre-
pandemic youth SR would predict less decline in youth
functioning and T1D self-
and parent emotional
management.

Participants and Procedures
Two studies of SR and medical regimen adherence in
youth with T1D were midway through data collection
in mid-March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic
began in the USA (see Supplementary Figure S1).
Study 1, which began data collection in May 2019,
was a clinical trial with a SR-focused behavioral inter-
vention enrolling youth and their caregivers (97%
parents, thus termed “parents”). Study 2, which began
data collection in April 2019, was an observational
study of parents of youth with T1D. For both studies,
participants were recruited from pediatric endocrinol-
ogy clinics at the University of Michigan and via on-
line methods (Miller et al., 2020). Study 1 eligibility
criteria were: youth (a) 13–17 years old; (b) diagnosed
with T1D for at least 6 months; (c) had HbA1c (cid:2)
resided with participating parent/legal
7.0%;
guardian at least 50% of the time; (e) had regular ac-
cess to a smartphone and Wi-Fi; (f) no psychiatric or
cognitive conditions that would impede ability to par-
ticipate; and (g) was sufficiently fluent in English to
complete study activities. Study 2 eligibility criteria
were: (a) parent had a child 10–17 years of age; (b)
child was diagnosed with T1D for at least 6 months;
(c) child resided with participating parent/legal guard-
ian at least 50% of the time; and (d) parent sufficiently
fluent in English to complete study. Both studies were
approved by the University of Michigan Institutional
Review Board (IRB-MED). Parents provided informed
consent in both studies. Youth provided assent for
Study 1. All participants from both studies who had
completed assessments prior to mid-March 2020
(N ¼ 121 parents [57 in Study 1, 64 in Study 2];
N ¼ 57 youth, all in Study 1) were contacted via email
between May and August, 2020 and invited to partici-
pate in an online follow-up to assess functioning dur-
ing the pandemic. Of these, 73% of parents (N ¼ 88)
and 75% of youth (N ¼ 43) participated in the follow-
up study and were compensated $25 for survey
completion. Mean time elapsed between pre- and
during-pandemic assessments was 8.7 months (SD: 3.4).
Only pre-intervention data were used from Study 1 for
the pre-pandemic assessment (no intervention vs. con-
trol differences in demographic or outcome variables at
pre-intervention; all p-values <.05). All intervention ac-
tivities for youth assigned to the intervention (N ¼ 22)

had been completed prior to the during-pandemic as-
sessment. Intervention condition was covaried in analy-
ses (see below).

Measures
Measures are described in detail elsewhere (Miller
et al., 2020) and reviewed below. All measures were
assessed in Study 1, Study 2 (both pre-pandemic), and
the during-pandemic assessment except where noted.
Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .77 to .95 across all
timepoints.

Youth Emotional Functioning (Assessed Pre- and
During-Pandemic)
Youth reported on their perceived stress
(PSS;
Gershon et al., 2013), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7;
Spitzer et al., 2006), and diabetes-specific distress
[PAID-T];
(Problem Areas
Weissberg-Benchell & Antisdel-Lomaglio, 2011).
Parents completed a proxy measure of youths’ per-
ceived stress (PSS; Gershon et al., 2013).

Parent Emotional Functioning (Assessed Pre- and
During-Pandemic)
Parents reported on their own emotion regulation dif-
ficulties (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004), perceived
stress (PSS; Gershon et al., 2013), and diabetes-
specific distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes—Parents
of Teen version [P-PAID-T]; Shapiro et al., 2018).

Youth T1D Self-Management (Assessed Pre- and
During-Pandemic)
Youth completed the self-report version and parents
completed the proxy version of
the Self-Care
Inventory-Revised (SCI-R; Weinger et al., 2005) to as-
sess youth adherence to medical regimen. Parents
completed

to assess degree of youth self-
management of T1D; higher scores indicate the parent
takes more responsibility, and lower scores indicate
the youth takes more responsibility (DFRQ; Anderson
et al., 1990).

(BRIEF-2; Gioia et al., 2015) about youth SR skills.
The BRIEF-2 is a clinically-validated tool yielding
standardized indices in three distinct domains of SR:
emotional SR (attention shift, emotional control), be-
havioral SR (inhibit, self-monitor), and cognitive SR
task-
(initiate, working memory, plan/organize,
monitor, organize materials). Higher scores on each
subscale indicate more difficulty with emotional, be-
havioral, and cognitive SR, respectively (scores >70
are clinically elevated).

Sociodemographics and T1D Characteristics
(Assessed Pre-Pandemic)
Parents reported on their own and their child’s age in
years, race/ethnicity (per NIH guidelines), and sex;
family income, number of people in the home, and
family structure. Income to needs ratio (ITNR) was
calculated by dividing income by the poverty thresh-
old that year for a household that size. An ITNR of
1.0 indicates a household is living at the poverty level;
higher values indicate greater income (Dearing et al.,
2001). Parents reported on youth T1D regimen (i.e.
use of continuous glucose monitor; insulin injections/
pump) and time since diagnosis. For Study 1 only,
HbA1C was collected by blood draw in conjunction
with the pre-intervention visit.

Statistical Analysis
We conducted mixed effects models to account for
within subject correlation due to having repeated
measures on the same participant over time. We in-
cluded time between assessments as a fixed effect to
examine change in emotional functioning and T1D
self-management measures
to during-
pandemic. Intervention condition was defined as inter-
vention versus control for Study 1 participants; all
Study 2 participants were given a value of “control”
for the purposes of the current analyses. We next con-
ducted mixed effects models to test whether family
pandemic-related stress or youth SR (emotional, be-
havioral, or cognitive) moderated change in each mea-
sure. The interaction term indicated whether the
degree of change in each measure from pre- to during-
pandemic was associated with family pandemic-
related stress or youth SR (moderator). We graphed
model-predicted patterns of emotional
functioning
and T1D self-management over time for participants
representing the 10th percentile, the median, and the
90th percentile of the moderator variables to visually
explore the corresponding response patterns. Alpha
levels for significance were set at p < .05; we con-
ducted follow-up tests to explore interactions with
p < .10. Finally, we conducted post-hoc analyses to
test for any changes in these models when only control
participants from Study 1 and Study 2 participants
were included.

Results

Table I presents descriptive characteristics for partici-
pants who completed questionnaires for the during-
pandemic assessment. Participants did not differ on
demographic variables from those who did not com-
plete this assessment (Study 1: youth age, sex, and
HbA1c; Study 2: youth age and sex, as HbA1c was
not collected in Study 2; all p’s > .05).

Changes from Pre- to During the COVID-19
Pandemic
No change was observed in youth emotional function-
ing from pre- to during-pandemic. Parents’ diabetes-
related distress decreased. Parent-report of youth T1D
self-management responsibility (DFRQ) increased, but
SCI-R scores did not change (Table II).

Pandemic-Related Family Stress as Moderator of
Change from Pre- to During-Pandemic
Higher pandemic-related family stress was associated
with greater declines in emotional functioning from
pre- to during-pandemic (Figure 1). Pandemic-related
family stress associated with increased parent-
reported perceived youth stress (p ¼ .004, pandemic-
related family stress (cid:3) timepoint interaction b ¼ 0.17,
95% CI: 0.06–0.28); and increased parent difficulty
with their own emotion regulation (p ¼ .0001, inter-
action b ¼ 5.74, 95% CI: 2.88–8.60), own perceived
stress (p < .0001, interaction b ¼ 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–
0.41), and own diabetes-related distress (p ¼ .02; in-
teraction b ¼ 5.07, 95% CI: 0.79–9.35). Pandemic-
related family stress was not a moderator of change in
youth-reported constructs. Supplementary Table S1
presents all moderation results.

Youth SR as a Moderator of Change from Pre- to
During-Pandemic
Emotional SR
Youths’ emotional SR moderated changes in self-
reported diabetes-related distress from pre- to during-
pandemic (Figure 2). Youth with stronger emotional
SR reported decreased diabetes-related distress,
whereas those with weaker emotional SR reported in-
creased diabetes-related distress [p ¼ 0.01; SR (cid:3) time-
point interaction b ¼ –0.73 (95% CI –1.29 to –0.17)].
Youth with stronger emotional SR were reported by
parents to show decreased perceived stress, but youth
with weaker emotional SR reported to show no
change in perceived stress [p < .03; interaction b ¼
–0.01 (95% CI: –0.03 to –0.001)]. Parents of youth
with weaker emotional SR reported increased difficul-
ties with their own emotion regulation [DERS; p ¼
.09; interaction b ¼ –0.28 (95% CI: –0.60 to 0.04),
whereas parents of youth with stronger emotional SR
reported no change.

Discussion

In this study of emotional functioning and youth T1D
self-management across the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic, the level of pandemic-related stress families
experienced was associated with decreased emotional
functioning, particularly for parents. Critically, youth
SR, particularly emotional and behavioral aspects,
appeared to protect against worsening youth diabetes
distress and regimen adherence across pandemic onset.

of change from pre- to during-pandemic.

Findings offer a novel perspective on family and indi-
vidual factors that may shape emotional functioning
and T1D-related outcomes for youth and their parents
in the context of a large-scale contextual stressor like
the pandemic.

Parent and Youth Emotional Functioning Changes
Across Pandemic Onset
Pandemic-related family stress moderated parents’
diabetes-related distress, consistent with prior work
finding decreases in diabetes-related distress during
lockdown among parents reporting no COVID-19-
related worries (Mianowska et al., 2021). Unlike
parents, youth did not report much change in emo-
to during-
tional

functioning overall

from pre-

unsurprising that parents reporting more pandemic-
related stress had difficulties in emotional functioning,
perhaps due to the unpredictable, uncontrollable na-
ture of the pandemic. Parents may also have experi-
enced emotional distress related to implications of the
pandemic in a way that youth did not yet process,
given the relative egocentrism of their developmental
stage and reduced sense of health risks or mortality
(Greene et al., 1996).

T1D Self-Management Changes Across Pandemic
Onset
Regardless of family pandemic-related stress experien-
ces, parents reported that youth increased their T1D
self-management responsibilities across the pandemic
onset. With youth and parents sharing the same space
due to altered school and work schedules, there may
have been more opportunities for parents to transfer
T1D self-management responsibilities to youth, and to
feel more able to monitor youth T1D management,
resulting in less diabetes distress. The finding that T1D
self-management did not change much in relation to
family pandemic-related stress was surprising consider-
ing anticipated challenges of delaying/shifting T1D care
visits or loss of daily T1D supports and structure at
school (Plevinsky et al., 2020). Our pandemic-related
family stress measure assessed job loss, physical health/
health care concerns, and loss of social connections, but
not factors directly related to T1D management such as
loss of access to diabetes routines and supports, changes
in physical activity options, noticing changes in blood
glucose patterns, difficulties managing blood glucose
excursions, or access to supplies, which have been de-
scribed as pandemic-related T1D concerns (Joensen
et al., 2020). Findings are consistent with other work
showing that youth did not change many T1D manage-
ment behaviors and that blood glucose levels either did
not change or improved during pandemic onset (Cheng
et al., 2021; O’Donnell et al., 2022). Together, findings

SR Moderators of Emotional Functioning and T1D
Self-Management Changes
Findings suggest youth SR may be an important protec-
tive factor, in particular in the context of a major, ex-
tended stressor like the COVID-19 pandemic. Results
differed by SR domain, suggesting some specificity in
SR skills that may promote diabetes resilience in the
face of challenge. For example, youth with strong emo-
tional SR, who can control their attention and emo-
tions, reported less diabetes distress and were reported
by parents to show less perceived stress across time.
Emotional SR skills such as the ability to use distraction
or calming strategies may have helped these youth feel

8

Miller et al.

less distressed and/or deploy effective coping skills to
manage stress (both related to diabetes and not).
Parents of these youth also regulated their emotions
somewhat better compared to parents of youth with
poorer emotional SR, highlighting the connected nature
of emotions in families, for example through emotion
socialization and stress response modeling pathways
(Bariola et al., 2011). Youth who were stronger in be-
havioral SR, reflecting capacities to self-monitor and in-
hibit behavior, were similarly reported by parents to
show less perceived stress, and self-reported lower dia-
betes distress and better T1D regimen adherence across
pandemic onset compared to those who did not demon-
strate such skills. As daily activities shifted during the
pandemic, behavioral SR may have helped youth priori-
tize diabetes management routines and reduced feelings
of diabetes-related burdens. Findings are consistent with
pre-pandemic studies finding that stronger general SR
skills associate with better T1D adherence in youth
(Perez et al., 2017) and extend this pattern to the con-
text of a major adversity. In contrast to emotional and
behavioral SR, youth cognitive SR did not moderate
emotional functioning or T1D self-management changes
across the pandemic onset.

Implications
Findings contribute to literature on COVID-19 pandemic
impacts on youth mental health (Goethals et al., 2021;
Magson et al., 2021) and T1D self-management
(Mianowska et al., 2021; O’Donnell et al., 2022). In fu-
ture work, it will be helpful to detail which aspects of SR
are most strongly linked to T1D self-management to
identify skills to promote adherence in youth T1D popu-
lations. Findings highlight SR as a possibly malleable fac-
tor that may protect against adverse impacts of stressors
on T1D self-management and diabetes-related distress. In
our sample, emotional and behavioral SR emerged as key
protective factors during significant societal stress, sug-
gesting they may help youth with T1D demonstrate resil-
ience in the face of major stressors, which is important to
understand even outside of
the pandemic context
(Hilliard et al., 2012). Indeed, SR has been proposed as a
novel intervention target in efforts to promote T1D out-
comes in youth (Miller et al., 2020; Stanger et al., 2021).
Clinically, findings may have implications for pedi-
atric psychologists seeking to support youth and fami-
lies managing T1D. It may be that using emotional
awareness, mindfulness, and/or relaxation strategies
to boost emotional SR, or using structured self-
management supports and rewards to improve behav-
ioral SR for these youth during periods of intense
stress may be more helpful than using memory cues or
organizational strategies to support cognitive SR. The
finding that youth SR was associated with parents’
own coping may also be clinically relevant as it high-
lights the interdependent nature of both SR and T1D

management between parent and child; if parents can
model effective coping strategies that support youth
SR development, youth may in turn more easily take
on developmentally appropriate T1D management re-
sponsibilities (Berg et al., 2017). Identifying how best
to support both youth and parent SR, perhaps by con-
necting parent and child goal-setting and plans for
managing stress as well as T1D tasks may be helpful
in developing family-level
intervention strategies
(Bauer et al., 2020). Pediatric psychologists and men-
tal health professionals on diabetes care teams are ide-
ally situated to support youth with T1D and their
parents to strengthen SR and apply those skills to ad-
verse situations, including diabetes-specific challenges
and other stressors (Kichler et al., 2015).

Strengths and Limitations
We assessed unique constructs—including SR—in
youth with T1D and their parents across pandemic on-
set. However, we did not include task-based SR assess-
ments, and parents reported on constructs that may
not have reflected youth viewpoints. It is also possible
that pandemic-related stressors may have affected SR.
Although we covaried the intervention condition,
about half of Study 1 youth had received an interven-
tion, which may have impacted outcomes. The small
sample of youth providing self-reports limits interpre-
tation of results, and limited power may explain some
null findings. Although new, the COVID-19 measure
had good psychometrics in this and other work on
family stress (Bates et al., 2021). We controlled for
time elapsed but were unable to standardize length of
time between assessments, so some families completed
the pre-pandemic assessment months prior to pan-
demic onset, and others completed it just prior. We
captured initial adjustment as families were not fol-
lowed across the duration of the pandemic. Eligibility
requirements for youth HbA1C differed between
Studies 1 and 2, so these groups may also have differed
regarding T1D management or stress. As in many
T1D studies, most of the sample was high income and
of White, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity. Thus, findings
may not represent or generalize to the more diverse
populations most
pandemic
impacted
(Kantamneni, 2020) and concurrent societal stressors
(e.g. racial and political unrest). Including more di-
verse samples in T1D studies can allow us to examine
SR as a possible protective factor for youth who are
experiencing structural, environmental, and geopoliti-
cal stressors such as poverty, violence, and racism.
