Abstract

Background. The estimates of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prevalence
across various studies are significantly variable, contributing to uncertainty in ADHD preva-
lence estimation. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have attributed this variability
primarily to the methodological characteristics of the studies, including the diagnostic criteria,
source of information, and impairment requirement for the diagnosis.
Methods. Review identified studies reporting ADHD prevalence in representative samples of
children and adults in Europe and worldwide. Studies that were conducted in the general
population were included. We focused on studies that report ADHD prevalence based on
clinical diagnosis (clinical diagnostic criteria based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases criteria, other diagnostic tools,
such as various scales or interviews based on clinical diagnostic criteria). PubMed/Medline was
searched to identify relevant articles published until 2024/2/01. The study was registered in
PROSPERO (CRD42020200220) and followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines for systematic review and meta-analysis.
Results. In total, 117 studies were subjected to full evaluation. In the meta-analysis, 103 studies
representing 159 independent datapoints were included. The overall prevalence of ADHD in
register studies was 1.6%, 95% CI [0.9; 3.0], in survey studies 5.0%, 95% CI [2.9; 8.6], in one-stage
clinical studies 4.2%, 95% CI [2.9; 6.0], and in two-stage clinical studies 4.8%, 95% CI [4.0; 5.8].
Conclusions. Exact comparisons among studies with different diagnostic criteria and types of
sampling can impact prevalence estimates. When comparing data from methodologically
different studies, these factors need to be considered.

Introduction

Psychiatric disease typically begins in childhood and adolescence, significantly impacting well-
being and development [1, 2]. Childhood psychiatric problems are among the most common
health issues, and their prevalence is increasing [2]. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) is one of the most widespread psychiatric diseases worldwide, especially in children and
adolescents [3]. Psychiatric diseases often persist into adulthood, resulting in individual and
collective social and economic burdens. This impact includes rising costs, education, welfare
system, and administration of justice since it affects all aspects of life, such as school or work
performance, relationships with family and friends, and community participation [1]. According
to the study of Doshi et al., total annual costs in the United States have been estimated to range
from US$143 billion to $266 billion, including health care and educational services for children
and loss of income and productivity for adults [4, 5]. Basic National Health Service costs for
ADHD (excluding medication costs) in England and Wales have been estimated at £23 million
for the initial specialist assessment and £14 million annually for follow-up care [4, 6]. Shlander
developed a model for ADHD drug costs in England and predicted in 2012 that costs would
exceed £78 million [4, 7].

In 2022, Barican et al. [1] published a systematic review and meta-analysis that included
14 studies in 11 high-income countries with a pooled sample of 61,545 children aged 4–18 years.
The most common psychiatric diseases were anxiety (prevalence 5.2%), attention-deficit/hyper-
activity (3.7%), oppositional defiant (3.3%), substance use (2.3%), conduct (1.3%), and depressive
(1.3%) disorders [1]. Cénat et al. [8] compared ADHD among children and adolescents of
different races. They included 23 studies, and the pooled prevalence rate of ADHD was 15.9%
with the pooled sample size of n = 218,445 [8]. Shooshtari et al. conducted an updated systematic
review in 2022 in Iran, including 34 original studies covering 33,621 Iranian children, adoles-
cents, and adults [9, 10]. The total prevalence of ADHD varies between 11% and 25.8% in
preschool children, between 3.17% and 17.3% in school-aged children, and between 3.9% and

2

Popit et al.

25.1% in adults [8]. Alhraiwil et al. [11] investigated the prevalence
of ADHD in different age categories (children, adolescents, stu-
dents) among Arab countries and reported variability across stud-
ies, with ADHD prevalence ranging between 0.46 and 19.6%.
Ayano et al. [12] evaluated ADHD prevalence in children and
adolescents in Africa, reporting a pooled prevalence of ADHD
7.47%. Liu et al. estimated the prevalence of ADHD among Chinese
children and adolescents [13]. The prevalence estimates of ADHD
in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were 6.5%, 6.4%, and
4.2%, respectively, with a pooled estimate of 6.3% [13]. These
prevalence estimates align with a systematic review and meta-
analysis from 2017, where an overall pooled prevalence of ADHD
among children and adolescents in China was 6.26% (95% CI: 5.36–
7.22%) [14]. Catalá-López et al. [15] investigated the prevalence of
ADHD among children and adolescents in Spain, with the overall
pooled prevalence estimated at 6.8%. Willcut [16] conducted a
comprehensive meta-analysis on the prevalence of DSM-IV
ADHD. While individual studies reported varied prevalence esti-
mates, the pooled results suggested that the prevalence of DSM-IV
ADHD was similar, whether ADHD was defined by parent ratings,
teacher ratings, or a best estimate diagnostic procedure in children
and adolescents (5.9–7.1%) or by self-report measures in young
adults (5.0%) [16]. Thomas et al. [17] conducted a systematic
review and meta-analysis to estimate ADHD prevalence in chil-
dren, with an overall pooled estimate of 7.2%. Systematic reviews by
Polanczyk et al. (2015; [3]) reported a worldwide ADHD prevalence
in children and adolescents of 3.4% and found that estimates of
ADHD prevalence were significantly variable (2014; [18]). In 2007,
Polanczyk et al. published a systematic review and meta-regression
analysis. The worldwide-pooled prevalence in subjects 18 years of
age or younger from the general population or schools was 5.29%,
and the prevalence estimate was associated with significant vari-
ability [19]. A few meta-analyses of epidemiological data on adult
ADHD have been published; however, Simon et al. [20] published
the first meta-analysis in 2009, estimating the prevalence of ADHD
in adulthood at 2.5% (95% CI 2.1–3.1). Dobrosavljevic et al.
researched ADHD prevalence in older adults. They concluded that
pooled prevalence estimates differed significantly across assess-
ment methods: 2.18% (95% CI = 1.51, 3.16) based on research
diagnosis via validated scales, 0.23% (0.12, 0.43) relying on clinical
ADHD diagnosis, and 0.09% (0.06, 0.15) based on ADHD treat-
ment rates [21]. Song et al. [22] assessed the global prevalence of
adult ADHD in the general population through a systematic review
and meta-analysis. The prevalence of persistent adult ADHD was
2.58%, and that of symptomatic adult ADHD was 6.76% [22].

Worldwide, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
been conducted to summarize the ADHD prevalence and analyze
variation of prevalence estimates reported by individual studies.
The variability in ADHD prevalence rates was mainly associated
with the methodological characteristics of the studies, such as
diagnostic criteria, source of information, and the impairment
requirement for the diagnosis [18, 19, 23]. Geographical location
was not a primary factor associated with the variability of preva-
lence estimates [16, 18, 19]. Variations in prevalence were also
confirmed in the World Mental Health Surveys, where adult
ADHD prevalence averaged 2.8% across surveys and was higher
in high (3.6%)- and upper-middle (3.0%)- than low-/lower-middle
(1.4%)-income countries [22].

Accurate prevalence estimates of psychiatric diseases in children
and adolescents are crucial to evaluate and properly address bur-
dens, as these disorders often persist into adulthood and can lead to
the loss of human potential [1, 3]. Policymakers require prevalence

data from multiple high-quality epidemiological studies using cur-
rent or recent diagnostic standards with rigorous diagnostic meas-
ures [1]. Systematic review and meta-analysis methods are optimal
choices for providing high-quality, relevant, accessible, and
up-to-date information that is crucial for policymakers [1, 24]. In
the context of the previous limitation in the meta-analyses and
systematic reviews mentioned above and the high ADHD disease
burden worldwide, the primary rationale for this review is to obtain
the latest data on ADHD prevalence and differences in prevalence
among different study types. These data would help calculate the
disease burden and help policymakers and clinicians better plan
resources for ADHD management.

Methods

We followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement
[25]. The protocol for this systematic review was registered in
PROSPERO (CRD42020200220).

Literature search

We conducted a search on PubMed/MEDLINE until 2024/1/02 for
articles in all languages using search terms related to “Attention-
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder” and “Epidemiology,” “Prevalence,”
and “Point Estimate.” The detailed search strategy is available in the
Supplementary material. No restrictions were applied concerning
language or type of document; we included full-text published
articles or conference proceedings.

Selection criteria

We included observational cohort studies (retrospective, prospective,
register-based population studies); cross-sectional studies; and clinical
studies with participants from the general population (e.g., community
samples, population-based registries, etc.) diagnosed with ADHD
using either: a) clinical diagnosis according to the International Clas-
sification of Diseases (ICD) or DSM criteria reported in registers/
medical files or self-reported medical history; or b) research diagnosis
of ADHD, that is, meeting the threshold/cut-off levels on an ADHD-
validated scales based on the DSM or ICD. We considered studies with
data on ADHD prevalence in those populations.

We excluded articles that were not in English (515 articles).
Additionally, we excluded studies conducted in nonrepresentative
samples of the general population (e.g., only boys/men, siblings) or
in selected areas (e.g., only rural/urban areas with small samples).
Studies not focusing on the prevalence of ADHD per se, despite
providing some data about it, as well as those presenting the lifetime
prevalence of ADHD and including only patients with ADHD
receiving pharmacological treatment, were also excluded.

Data extraction

References to studies identified in electronic searches were man-
aged in MS Excel®. Titles/abstracts were screened by two authors
(SP, KŠ), and full-text articles were independently screened by
two authors ( SP and KŠ). Senior authors (MŠ, IL) were consulted
to reach a consensus when needed. Two authors ( SP and KŠ)
independently extracted data. The following data were extracted:
first author and year of publication; year of data collection
(if applicable); country; age category; number of individuals with
ADHD; sample size; and prevalence assessment method group (one-

stage clinical studies, two-stage clinical studies, surveys, and registry
studies on medical records data). Age categories were defined as
preschool children (below 6 years), school children (6–12 years),
adolescents (12–18 years), and adults (above 18 years). Combinations
of age categories were also included. A margin of 6 years was allowed
for the preschool and school children categories, while an age interval
of 11–13 years was allowed for the categories school children and
adolescents. For the adult category, the age range had to be over two
decades. Prevalence estimates from the same study based on different
countries, age groups, or time frames were considered separate data-
sets. In case of overlapping study samples, the study that was published
earlier and/or the study that was the most pertinent to our criteria was
included. If the prevalence estimate was not reported or could not be
calculated based on data from the paper, a study was excluded from the
systematic review.

Data synthesis

Data synthesis was performed separately for each of the four
prevalence assessment method groups. As a rule, three or more
studies should be available for each subgroup. The meta-analysis of
prevalence data and forest plot construction was performed in an R

statistical environment. Age categories were used as subgroups in
the meta-analysis (version 4.3.1), utilizing the function metaprop
within the “meta” package. Due to the expected high heterogeneity,
the random-effect model was applied and the restricted maximum-
likelihood estimator was used for calculating between-study vari-
ance. The overall prevalence was calculated using the logit trans-
the overall prevalence
formation. The confidence interval of
estimate was calculated based on Hartung-Knapp adjustment.
Confidence intervals of prevalence for individual studies were
calculated based on exact binominal intervals.

Results

In total, 8,332 records were retrieved and 508 studies were subjected
to full evaluation. A total of 117 studies covering children, adoles-
cents, and adults were included in the systematic review (Figure 1).
Then, 103 studies representing 159 independent samples were
included in the meta-analysis. The majority of these studies
(116 studies) were conducted in different countries worldwide,
while one study was conducted in 10 countries in the Americas,
Europe, and the Middle East [23]. Of the 117 included studies,
26 studies were conducted in Asia (6 in China, 7 in India, 4 in

Turkey); 32 in Europe, 26 studies in North America (19 of them in
the United States); 3 studies in South America; 10 studies in Africa;
12 in the Middle East; and 3 in Oceania.

We summarized descriptive data for studies included in the

systematic review in Tables 1–3.

The included studies focused mostly on the population of
preschool children, children in elementary school, adolescents,
and young adults.

Diagnoses in these studies were determined through the analysis
of electronic health records, population-based and administrative
data, and/or health insurance data (register studies). They provided
information through surveys (survey studies) and interviews with
children, parents/guardians and/or teachers, using measures that
included DSM and/or ICD diagnostic criteria (one-stage and two-
stage clinical studies).

Overall prevalence of ADHD

The prevalence estimates of ADHD reported in the included studies
varied substantially and offered a range of heterogeneous data.
Heterogeneity was attributed mostly to the studies’ methodological
characteristics and age categories. Subgroup analysis showed that
the prevalence estimates differed significantly across different age
categories, except for the meta-analysis done for one-stage clinical
studies. Furthermore, the remaining heterogeneity within sub-
groups remained high, above 90% in almost all age subgroups
and all study types.

Prevalence of ADHD in register studies and surveys

In total, 42 studies assessed the prevalence of ADHD by analyzing
different databases or conducting a health survey. These studies are
presented in Table 1.

The primary data source for the 32 studies was a review of
electronic health and/or administrative records for a cohort of
patients. Then, 13 studies were conducted in North America,
14 in Europe, 3 in Asia, and 2 in the Middle East.

The majority of the studies included children and/or adoles-
cents. Twelve studies also included young adults and/or adults. In
the study of Bachmann et al. [27], the frequency of ADHD diag-
nosis in the age range of 18–69 years was 0.2% (M: 0.3%; F: 0.2%)
in 2009 and 0.4% (M: 0.5%; F: 0.3%) in 2014. In the study of Burd
et al. [31], after 18 years of age, ADHD was diagnosed in 2% of the
population. Hauck et al. [37] concluded that the overall prevalence
of ADHD was 5.4%, with a higher prevalence in males but in not
females, in older cohorts, although the reasons for the higher
prevalence in older age categories were unclear. In the study of
Chung et al. [33] 1.12% adult patients received diagnoses of ADHD
[33]. Prevalence increased from 0.43% in 2007 to 0.96% in 2016.
Among children aged 5–11 years, the prevalence increased from
2.96% in 2007 to 3.74% in 2016 [33]. Most recent studies focused on
the increase in the prevalence of patients diagnosed with ADHD
and on the other hand underdiagnosis and undertreatment of
ADHD. Giacobini et al. [40] reported the annual prevalence of
diagnosed ADHD in Sweden as 1.1 per 1,000 persons in 2006,
which increased to 4.8 per 1,000 persons in 2011 (in all ages). They
also concluded that the mean age of patients diagnosed with ADHD
increased between 2006 and 2011, with a slight increase in the mean
age of new diagnoses (21.2 in 2007 and 22.3 in 2011) [40]. In the
cohort study by McKechnie et al. [47], the prevalence of ADHD
diagnoses is highest among children. The overall proportion of
ADHD diagnoses in male children aged 3–17 years was 175 per

10 000 (95% CI 174–177), or 1.8%; in female children aged 3–
17 years, it was 37.7 per 10 000 (95% CI 37.1–38.3), or 0.4%. For
male adults aged 18–99 years, the overall proportion was 28.8 per
10 000 (95% CI 28.6–29.0), or 0.3%; for female adults aged 18–
99 years, it was 7.2 per 10 000 (95% CI 7.1–7.3), or 0.07% [47]. Pro-
portionally, rates increased among adults from 2000 to 2018.
However, the authors found evidence of increases in the proportion
of people with ADHD diagnoses between 2000 and 2018
[47]. Ramos-Quiroga et al. [50] reported that ADHD continues
to be underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly in female
adults. The prevalence of ADHD in children was estimated at
4.9%, whereas that in adults was estimated at 0.1%.

In the study of Holden et al. [42], diagnostic criteria were not
explicitly defined; McKechnie et al. [47] used the Read code system.
DSM diagnostic criteria were used in the study by Brook et al. [29]
Fast et al. [38], Habdank-Kolaczkowski [41], and Davidovitch et al.
[34]. In other studies, ICD-9 and/or ICD-10 criteria were used.

Eight survey studies were conducted in North America (Canada
and the United States). Five studies assessed ADHD in children and
adolescents (3–17 years old). In these studies, the person most
knowledgeable about the child, parent, or guardian answered ques-
tions about the presence of a child’s psychiatric diagnosis of ADHD,
confirmed by a doctor or other healthcare provider. Children
and/or adolescents were subjects in eight studies. Ten Have et al.
[63] and Hesson et al. [60] examined the prevalence of ADHD in
adults. In both studies, ADHD prevalence was higher in men than
in women (3.7% vs. 2.7% in women and 3.2% overall [63]; n =
287, 58.8% vs. n = 201, 41.2% in women [60]). Diagnostic criteria
were not explicitly defined in two studies – Parasurman et al. [61]
and Visser et al. [64]. In other studies, the DSM criteria (or in
combination with ICD criteria) were used.

Prevalence of ADHD in one-stage clinical studies

Twenty-five studies provided data on ADHD prevalence by one-
stage clinical studies. These studies are presented in Table 2. Data
collection tools used were: The Mini International Neuropsychi-
atric Interview (MINI), Development and Well-Being Assessment,
Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC), Diagnostic
Interview for Children and Adolescents (DICA), INCLEN Diag-
nostic Tool for Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, DSM-IV
questionnaire, The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia (K-SADS), ADHD Rating Scale, Child Behavior
Checklist, Teacher’s Report Form, Youth Self-Report, Peer-
Relations Questionnaire, and Revised Behavior Problem Checklist.
Three studies were conducted in North America, three in South
America, four in Europe, seven in Asia, two in Africa, three in
Oceania, and three in the Middle East.

Gomes et al. [79] assessed the prevalence of ADHD in young
adults, other studies evaluated ADHD prevalence in children and/or
adolescents (Cuffe et al. [72] and Moffitt et al. [85] included also
adults). Gomes et al. [79] used data from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort
(Brazil) and assessed the prevalence of psychiatric diseases at 22 years
using the MINI. The ADHD prevalence was 4.5% (M: 4.1%, F: 4.8%)
[79]. The weighted prevalence of DSM-III-R ADHD in the study of
Cuffe et al. [72] was 1.51% (males: 2.62%, females: 0.54%), with
significant association for gender (male). Moffitt et al. [85] reported
3% prevalence in the adult-ADHD group and gender balance.

Ashenafi et al. did not explicitly defined diagnostic criteria;
however, DICA was used (structured interview for school-age
children, based on the DSM criteria [69]). In other studies, the
DSM criteria (or in combination with ICD criteria) were used.

Prevalence of ADHD in two-stage clinical studies

Fifty studies provided data on ADHD prevalence through two-
stage clinical studies. These studies are presented in Table 3. In the
first stage, a questionnaire screening phase was conducted, followed
by a diagnostic interview.

Two studies were conducted in North America, 4 in South
America, 13 in Europe, 16 in Asia, 8 in Africa, and 6 in the Middle
East. The prevalence of ADHD in children and/or adolescents was
assessed in a great proportion of the studies included in this review.
In five studies, the prevalence of ADHD in adults was assessed. In
the study of Michielsen et al. [120], the estimated prevalence rate of
syndromic ADHD in older adults was 2.8%; for symptomatic
ADHD, the rate was 4.2%. Younger elderly adults (60–70 years)
reported significantly more ADHD symptoms than older elderly
adults (71–94 years) [120]. Fayyad et al. [23] assessed ADHD
prevalence in adult respondents aged 18–44 years in 10 countries
in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. Estimates of ADHD
prevalence averaged 3.4% (range 1.2–7.3%), with a lower preva-
lence in lower-income countries (1.9%) compared with higher-
income countries (4.2%) [23]. However, masked clinical reappraisal
interviews administered to 154 US respondents in this study yielded
a prevalence estimate of 5.2% for adult ADHD [23]. In the study of
Matte et al. [119], ADHD prevalence in 18- to 19-year-old young
adults was assessed. The prevalence of DSM-5 ADHD was 3.55%
[95% confidence interval (CI) 2.98–4.12], and the estimated preva-
lence of DSM-IV ADHD was 2.8% [119]. Urban inhabitants of
Tabriz (Iran) aged 18–45 years were selected for the study of Amiri
et al. [94], and the prevalence of adult ADHD was estimated to be
3.8%. Men, when compared with women, were more likely to have
ADHD (5.5% in men versus 2% in women) [94]. Kessler et al. [113]
evaluated adult ADHD in a probability subsample of 18- to
44-year-old respondents in the National Comorbidity Survey Rep-
lication. The estimated prevalence of current adult ADHD was

4.4% [113]. The Diagnostic criteria used in two-stage clinical
studies were preferably DSM criteria; ADHD prevalence ranged
between 0.6% in the study by Puura et al. [128] and 16.4% in the
study by Pineda et al. [127]. Heiervang et al. [112] used both the
DSM and ICD criteria. Bansal et al. [95], Elberling et al. [107], and
Deivasigamani et al. [104] used the ICD criteria, and the prevalence
rates of kinetic syndrome/disorder were 6%, 1%, and 1.7%.

In two-stage clinical studies, the DSM diagnostic criteria were
preferably used. Only in the studies of Bansal et al. [95], Elberling
et al. [107], and Deivasigamani et al. [104], the ICD diagnostic
criteria were used.

Meta-analysis

In the meta-analysis, we analyzed separately each type of studies
(register and survey studies, one-stage and two-stage clinical studies).
Age categories were used as subgroups. Results are presented in Figure 2.
Studies were grouped in according to age. In the case of less than
three studies in the subgroup, these studies were excluded. We
identified 103 eligible studies for meta-analysis.

One-stage clinical studies

We analyzed 28 independent datapoints (in total 22 studies). The
overall prevalence of ADHD in one-stage clinical studies was 4.2%,
95% CI [2.9; 6.0]. In age subgroups, the results were 4.9%, 95% CI
[2.6; 9.0] for school children; 3.7%, 95% CI [1.8; 7.4] for adolescents,
and 4.1%, 95% CI [1.7; 9.5] for school children and adolescents.

Two-stage clinical studies

We analyzed 79 independent datapoints (in total 49 studies). The
overall prevalence of ADHD in two-stage clinical studies was 4.8%,

cents, 3.1%, 95% CI [1.6; 5.8] for adolescents, and 3.3%, 95% CI [1.9;
5.9] for adults.

Survey studies

We analyzed 14 independent datapoints (in total 8 studies). The
overall prevalence of ADHD in survey studies was 5.0%, 95% CI
[2.9; 8.6]. In age subgroups, the results were 1.4%, 95% CI [0.6; 3.3]
for preschool children; 8.5%, 95% CI [7.9; 9.2] for preschool and
school children and adolescents; 6.4%, 95% CI [2.1; 18.0] for school
children and 11.1%, 95% CI [9.1; 13.5] for adolescents.

Register studies

We analyzed 38 independent datapoints (in total 24 studies). The
overall prevalence of ADHD in register studies was 1.6%, 95% CI
[0.9; 3.0]. In age subgroups, the results were 0.3%, 95% CI [0.0; 3.8]
for preschool children; 4.2%, 95% CI [1.8; 9.4] for school children,
3.5%, 95% CI [1.9; 6.4] for preschool and school children and
adolescents; 5.1%, 95% CI [1.9; 12.8] for school children and
adolescents;4.1%, 95% CI [0.9; 16.7] for adolescents; 0.2%, 95%
CI [0.0; 2.1] for adults; and 0.9%, 95% CI [0.3; 2.7] for all ages.

Discussion

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of studies evalu-
ating worldwide prevalence rates of ADHD to understand better
and explain the variability in ADHD prevalence data. The preva-
lence of ADHD was investigated across different age categories
(children, adolescents, and adults). We compared the results among
the different types of studies (register and survey studies, one-stage
and two-stage clinical studies). These data must be interpreted
cautiously due to the high variability in the analyses that are
conducted. The results of this systematic review show that the
overall prevalence of ADHD in register studies was 1.6%, 95% CI
[0.9; 3.0], in survey studies was 5.0%, 95% CI [2.9; 8.6], in one-stage
clinical studies was 4.2%, 95% CI [2.9; 6.0], and in two-stage clinical
studies was 4.8%, 95% CI [4.0; 5.8]. The register studies exhibit the
lowest estimate for ADHD prevalence, mostly because of inclusion
of the entire population (e.g., children under 2 years old), while the
other three types of studies show similar estimates. However, our
results also indicate that the type of study methodology significantly
impacts the estimation of ADHD prevalence. Register-based stud-
ies depend on the quality of different data collections (input data).
Since ADHD still lacks biological markers, diagnosis relies on
physicians’ education and practice [34], and cultural factors may
also play a significant role in the identification of ADHD
[11]. Therefore, ADHD prevalence can vary significantly. One-
stage and two-stage clinical studies provide more comparable
ADHD prevalence data.

Most of the studies included in our review utilized the DSM
and/or ICD diagnostic criteria to diagnose ADHD. Additionally,
different data collection tools, such as the DSM/ICD question-
naire, K-SADS, MINI, DAWBA, and DISC, were used in the
included one-stage and two-stage clinical studies. When the diag-
nosis was based on DSM criteria, the edition of criteria affected the
median prevalence in one-stage and two-stage clinical studies
(lower average of prevalence medians in DSM-III vs. DSM-IV
or DSM-5 criteria). However, the number of studies using the

DSM-III criteria was significantly lower than those using updated
diagnostic criteria.

Additional variations in the prevalence estimates can be attrib-
uted to the study populations. The prevalence of ADHD varies with
age [9]. Previous systematic reviews have shown lower ADHD
prevalence in adults compared to school children and adolescents
[3, 12, 17–22]. Most of the studies in our review have been per-
formed on children and adolescents. It is important to note that
psychiatric diseases often persist into adulthood, leading to indi-
vidual and collective social and economic burdens [1]. The differ-
ences in prevalence estimates between children and adults can be
attributed to delayed brain maturation [139]. This delayed matur-
ation, particularly in the frontal areas, may lead to a protracted
developmental trajectory in ADHD, with brain function normal-
izing in young adulthood but declining prematurely in later years.
Consequently, the neurobiological changes observed in ADHD
during adulthood may contribute to the varying prevalence rates
seen across different age groups [139].

Our study must be considered in the context of its limitations.
First, several methodological issues need to be addressed. We
limited our search to articles published in English for this review,
while articles in other languages were not considered. Although
most studies are published in English, we may have missed some
articles (mainly in Chinese). Additionally, our search was limited to
PubMed®, which may result in fewer articles being included. To
address these limitations, replicating our systematic review, includ-
ing other databases, such as Embase, is recommended. We also
included only studies that included the general population, which
might underrepresent local situations and represent the limitation
of the evidence. Excluding other populations (e.g., institutionalized
populations, “special needs” children) can lead to an underestima-
tion of the actual burden of ADHD, which is necessary data for
disease burden calculations. Second, we analyzed studies conducted
at different time points and locations; this issue could be examined
in a proper meta-regression analysis. Although we compared stud-
ies by type, not all methods used were standardized. Third, the
number of studies was not evenly distributed in all geographical
locations, especially in Africa, Oceania, and the Middle East. Add-
itional studies in these regions are needed to confirm our results,
calling for a meta-regression analysis in this area.

Despite some limitations, the results of our study have import-
ant implications. First, we included studies with clinically con-
firmed diagnoses of ADHD, which may contribute to the more
objective and precise ADHD prevalence data compared to the
systematic reviews that also included studies where ADHD diag-
nosis was based on nonclinical questionnaire results. Second, the
type of study (methodology) significantly affects the estimation of
ADHD prevalence. It is necessary to standardize diagnostic pro-
cedures to monitor the rates of ADHD efficiently. Third, our results
can assist policymakers in better understanding ADHD, which is
essential for resource planning and implementing global strategies
for ADHD management worldwide. Our results can also encourage
researchers to conduct additional analyses and systematic reviews,
incorporating more databases.

In conclusion, the results from this systematic review and meta-
analysis suggest that the type of study significantly affects the
prevalence of ADHD. Standard diagnostic procedures to estimate
ADHD prevalence may contribute to accurate prevalence data and
provide high-quality, relevant, accessible, and up-to-date informa-
tion for policymakers. Based on these findings, we propose that the
current estimate of prevalence of ADHD should be based on the
average of all study types.
