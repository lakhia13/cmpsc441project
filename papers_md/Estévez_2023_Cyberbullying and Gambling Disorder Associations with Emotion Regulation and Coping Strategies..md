Abstract
The presence of unsuitable coping and emotion regulation strategies in young populations 
with gambling disorder (GD) and in those who have experienced cyberbullying victimiza-
tion has been suggested. However, this association has not been explored in depth. In this 
study, our aim was to analyze individual differences in emotion regulation, coping strate-
gies, and substance abuse in a clinical sample of adolescents and young adult patients with 
GD (n = 31) and in a community sample (n = 250). Furthermore, we aimed to examine the 
association between cyberbullying and GD. Participants were evaluated using the Cyber-
bullying  Questionnaire-Victimization,  the  Canadian  Adolescent  Gambling  Inventory,  the 
Coping Strategies Inventory, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Alcohol Use 
Disorders  Identification  Test  and  the  Drug  Use  Disorders  Identification  Test.  Structural 
Equation  Modeling  was  used  to  explore  associations  between  these  factors  in  a  commu-
nity sample and in a clinical group. In both groups, exposure to cyberbullying behaviors 
was positively associated with higher emotion dysregulation and the use of maladaptative 
coping  styles.  Our  findings  uphold  that  adolescents  and  young  adults  who  were  victims 
of cyberbullying show difficulties in emotion regulation and maladaptive coping strategies 
when  trying  to  solve  problems.  The  specific  contribution  of  sex,  age,  gambling  severity, 
emotion regulation, and coping strategies on cyberbullying severity is also discussed. Pop-
ulations  at  vulnerable  ages  could  potentially  benefit  from  public  prevention  policies  that 
target these risk factors.

Introduction

Journal of Gambling Studies (2023) 39:1399–1416

The  prevalence  of  problematic  gambling  behaviors  among  adolescents  and  young  adults  is 
rising in many countries, bringing with it significant negative consequences in terms of social, 
familial,  and  occupational  functioning  (Calado  et  al.,  2017a;  Ferrara  et  al.,  2018)  Adoles-
cents with problematic gambling have shown, among other aspects, deficits in concentration, 
increased distress, depressive symptoms, substance use, eating disorder psychopathology, and 
lower self-stem (Afifi et al., 2016; Marco & Tormo-Irun, 2018; Nigro et al., 2017; Shead et al., 
2010).

Researchers have also posited that maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and dysfunc-
tional coping skills are relevant risk factors in the development and maintenance of psychopa-
thology and (Gross & Muñoz, 1995; Russell et al., 2012; Schreiber et al., 2012),  specifically, 
in the case of adolescent problem gambling (Calado et al., 2017b; Estevez et al., 2014; Jau-
regui et al., 2016). Therefore, difficulties in controlling gambling behaviors may be influenced 
by  deficits  in  coping  skills,  especially  by  using  emotion-focused  coping,  such  as  escape  or 
avoidance (Williams et al., 2012). Gambling may be used as a coping mechanism to escape 
from life difficulties and negative affect because, among other aspects, it provides immediate 
relief and distraction (Farrelly et al., 2007; Torres et al., 2013; Wood & Griffiths, 2007).

One of the difficulties that certain young people have to face is to experience a victimization 
process derived from bullying or its online modality, cyberbullying (Musharraf et al.,  2018). 
Cyberbullying has been understood as “any behavior performed through electronic or digital 
media by individuals or groups that repeatedly communicates hostile or aggressive messages 
intended  to  inflict  harm  or  discomfort  on  others”.  (Tokunaga,  2010).  Victims  of  cyberbully-
ing are characterized by lower levels of emotional self-efficacy (Olenik-Shemesh & Heiman, 
2014) and a more prevalent use of emotion-focused coping skills (focused on suppress or con-
trol negative emotions instead of change the stressor) and emotional suppression (Vranjes et al., 
2018). Data suggest that being continually exposed to these kinds of traumatic or stressful life 
events may predispose individuals to develop disordered gambling (Brydges et al., 2015; Rob-
erts et al., 2017), in addition to other psychopathological disorders, such as depression (Bottino 
et al., 2015). Regarding substance use, although some authors suggest the existence of an asso-
ciation between cyberbullying and substance use (Ybarra et al., 2007; Zsila et al., 2018),  others 
have not found a link between these two behaviors (Selkie et al., 2015).

To date, the relationship between GD, being victim of cyberbullying, and the underlying 
psychological mechanisms that could be related to this association have been sparsely studied. 
As such, the aims of the present study were: (a) to estimate the prevalence of cyberbullying 
in both a sample of adolescents and young adults with GD and a community sample; (b) to 
analyze individual differences in emotion regulation, coping strategies, and substance abuse 
between  a  clinical  sample  of  patients  with  GD  and  a  community  sample;  and  (c)  to  exam-
ine the underlying associations between cyberbullying and GD in both samples, considering 
direct and indirect (mediational) effects.

Methods

Sample and Procedure

The current study was conducted between December 2017 and April 2018. Both a clinical 
and  community  samples  were  recruited  for  this  study.  The  clinical  participants  included

n = 31  young  patients  who  voluntarily  asked  for  treatment  at  the  outpatient  specialized 
Gambling  Disorder  Unit  at  Bellvitge  University  Hospital  in  Barcelona,  Spain.  These 
patients were diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria, by means of face-to-face interview 
(American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013).  Most  of  the  participants  into  this  subsample 
were men (n = 28, 90.3%), and all were born in Spain. The mean for the chronological age 
was 20.8 years (SD = 2.4).

The community sample (n = 250) was recruited from secondary education schools from 
the Basque Country region in Spain following convenience sampling. Most of the partici-
pants into this subsample were born in Spain (n = 224, 89.6%), and distribution of sex was 
n = 126 men (49.6%) versus n = 124 women (%). The mean for the chronological age was 
18.2 years (SD = 4.9). Invitations were sent out to local schools and a research team mem-
ber travelled to  participating centers to  administer  the  paper-and-pencil questionnaires in 
person. Students completed the survey in their classrooms individually. The passing of the 
tests lasted approximately 40–50 min. During the completion of the protocols, members of 
the research team were present to resolve any doubts that might arise. The survey included 
general information regarding the study purposes. Minors had their consent forms signed 
by their parents/tutors prior to participating in the study.

Participation  in  this  study  had  no  compensation  whatsoever  for  the  people  who  par-
ticipated.  All  schools  received  a  general  feedback  report.  This  study  was  carried  out  in 
accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee of 
University of Deusto approved the study (ref number ETK-13/15-16), and signed informed 
consent was obtained from all participants.

Measures

Cyberbullying Questionnaire‑Victimization (CBQ‑V) (Estévez et al., 2010)

This  instrument  contains  11  items  that  evaluate  different  forms  of  cyberbullying.  It  uses 
a  Likert  scale  ranging  from  "0 = never"  to  "2 = often"  (e.g.,  writing  embarrassing  jokes, 
rumors, gossip, or comments about a classmate on the Internet). This instrument was vali-
dated by confirmatory factorial analysis, in a one-factor structure, showing a good model 
fit. It has an adequate internal consistency index, with a Cronbach alpha of α = 0.95. In this 
study, the exposition to cyberbullying was considered absent for raw total score equals to 0 
on the CBQ-V, while it was considered present using a raw total score higher than 0. Con-
sistency in the sample of the study was adequate (α = 0.79).

Canadian Adolescent Gambling Inventory (CAGI) (Tremblay et al., 2010) Spanish 
Validation by Jiménez‑Murcia et al. (2017) 

This  is  a  self-report  instrument  designed  for  teenagers  that  measures  the  consequences 
derived from gambling behavior in two different sections. It includes 20 items measured 
on  a  6-point  scale  to  analyze  the  frequency,  time  and  type  of  gambling,  as  well  as  the 
amount of money or valuables lost as a result of gambling (e.g., do you prefer to hang out 
with friends who gamble/bet?). It also includes 24 items measured on a four-point scale to 
measure the severity of one’s gambling problem, loss of control over gambling behavior, 
and the psychological, social and economic consequences derived from it (e.g., how often 
have you borrowed money from family, friends, or others to gamble/bet?). It also includes 
a subscale that measures gambling severity (GPSS) through nine of the items that make up 

1 31402

the  CAGI.  It  shows  adequate  psychometric  indexes,  with  satisfactory  reliability  (internal 
consistency, Cronbach’s alpha, α  = 0.91), satisfactory convergent validity as measured by 
correlation with South Oaks Gambling Screen (r  = 0.74), and excellent classification accu-
racy (AUC  = 0.99; sensitivity = 0.98; and specificity = 0.99). Consistency in the sample of 
the study was excellent (α   = 0.96).

Coping Strategies Inventory (CSI) (Tobin et al., 1989) Spanish Validation by Cano et al. 
(2007)

The  original  scale  was  made  up  of  72  self-administered  items.  The  Spanish  adaptation 
reduced the original scale to 40, removing items that showed less factor loading, and an 
added  measure  of  perceived  self-efficacy  in  coping.  The  scale  consists  of  eight  5-item 
subscales, with scores from 0 (not at all) to 4 (totally). The instrument has a hierarchi-
cal  structure,  composed  of  eight  primary  subscales,  four  secondary  subscales,  and  two 
tertiary subscales. The eight subscales are: problem solving (e.g., I stood my ground and 
fought for what I wanted);, cognitive restructuring (e.g., I told myself things that helped 
me feel better), social  support (e.g., I found  somebody  who was a  good listener),  emo-
tional expression (e.g., I let out my feelings to reduce the stress), problem avoidance situ-
ation (e.g., I went along as if nothing were happening);, wishful thinking (e.g., I hoped 
the  problem  would  take  care  of  itself),  social  withdrawal  (e.g.,  I  tried  to  keep  my  feel-
ings  to  myself),  and  self-blame  (e.g.,  I  realized  that  I  brought  the  problem  on  myself). 
These subscales are further integrated into four additional secondary subscales: problem 
focused engagement, emotion focused engagement, problem focused disengagement, and 
emotion focused disengagement. Finally, it features two tertiary subscales: engagement 
and disengagement.

The CSI shows good psychometric properties, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 
0.75  to  0.89  in  the  eight  primary  subscales  in  the  Spanish  validation.  In  the  present 
study, consistency was between adequate (α = 0.75 for F1 social withdrawal) and very 
good (α = 0.90 for F3 adequate global) (Table 1 includes the Cronbach alpha for all the 
scales).

The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) (Gratz & Roemer, 2004) Spanish 
Validation by Hervás and Jódar (2008)

This instrument is made up of 36 items that gauge a number of factors concerning optimal 
emotion regulation (e.g., when I’m upset, I become angry with myself for feeling that way). 
Each item is evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘Almost never’ (0–10% of the 
time) to Almost always (90–100% of the time). This scale comprises six latent factors: lack 
of  emotional  awareness,  non-acceptance  of  emotional  responses,  lack  of  emotional  clar-
ity, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, lack of emotional control, and impulse 
control  difficulties.  The  previously  reported  psychometric  properties  of  the  instrument 
were adequate (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93; range = 0.73–0.91, with a test–retest reliability of 
0.88 in a 4–8-week period). Its six-factor structure has been validated in Spanish (Gómez-
Simón et al., 2014). In the sample of the study, consistency was between adequate (α = 0.79 
for “difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior”) and excellent (α = 0.91 for total score) 
(Table 1 includes the Cronbach alpha for all the scales).

Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (Saunders et al., 1993) Spanish 
Validation by Martínez (1999)

The AUDIT was developed as a simple screening method for excessive alcohol consump-
tion. Internal consistency has been found to be high, and test–retest data have pointed to 
high reliability (0.86) and a sensitivity of around 0.90. Specificity in different settings and 
for  different  criteria  averages  0.80  or  more  (Martínez,  1999).  In  this  study,  cutoff  points 
of 8 and 20 were used to identify individuals with alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, 
respectively (Martínez, 1999). Cronbach alpha in sample was very good (α = 0.85).

Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) (Berman et al., 2005)

This  is  an  11-item  screening  instrument  developed  to  identify  non-alcohol  drug  use  pat-
terns and various drug-related problems based on DSM-IV-TR criteria (American Psychi-
atric Association, 2000). The first nine items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging 
from 0 to 4, and the last two are scored on 3-point scales (values of 0, 2, 4). Total scores 
can range from 0 to 44, with higher scores being indicative of more severe drug problems. 
It shows adequate reliability indices, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.93 in general population 
samples and 0.80 in clinical samples. Cronbach alpha in sample was excellent (α = 0.93).

Other Sociodemographic and Clinical Variables

Additional  demographic,  clinical,  and  social/family  variables  related  to  gambling  were 
taken in the clinical group using a semi-structured face-to-face clinical interview described 
elsewhere (Jiménez-Murcia et al., 2007).

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was carried out with Stata16 for Windows. Firstly, categorical variables 
were compared between participants exposed to the presence of cyberbullying through chi-
square  tests  (χ2),  while  quantitative  variables  were  compared  between  both  groups  with 
t-test procedures.

Secondly,  the  association  between  cyberbullying  severity  (measured  as  the  raw  total 
score  on  the  cyberbullying  questionnaire)  with  the  other  clinical  variables  was  estimated 
through partial correlations (R) adjusted for the covariates sex and age. For these estima-
tions, and based on the strong association between significance and sample sizes, the rele-
vance of the correlations was based on coefficient effect size (Rosnow & Rosenthal, 1996).
The  specific  contribution  of  the  variables  sex,  age,  gambling  severity  (GPSS-total), 
emotion regulation (DERS-total) and coping (CSI-adequate global and CSI-non adequate 
global)  on  cyberbullying  severity  was  estimated  through  negative  binomial  regressions. 
These models constitute a type of generalized linear model in which the dependent vari-
able is defined as a count  of the number of  times an event occurs,  and  it can  be  consid-
ered an extension of the Poisson regression for over-dispersed outcomes (Dupont, 2009). 
In this study, the negative binomial regressions were adjusted in two blocks/steps: (a) first 
block/step  entered  and  set  the  variables  sex,  age,  gambling  severity,  emotion  regulation 
scores and coping strategy scores; and (b) second block/step added and tested the interac-
tion parameters defined between the sex with the other clinical measures and between the 
age with the other clinical measures. After valuing the interaction parameters added to the 

1 31406

second block/step, a final model was considered which retained only those significant inter-
action terms (p ≤ 0.05), interpreting the main effects for the non-significant interactions and 
the single effects for the significant interactions.

Finally, path-analysis explored the underlying mechanisms between age, coping strate-
gies (CSI-adequate global and CSI-non adequate global) and emotion regulation (DERS-
total) with gambling severity (GPSS-total) and cyberbullying severity (raw total score on 
the cyberbullying questionnaire). Path analysis constitutes an extension of multiple regres-
sion modeling, which can be used to estimate the magnitude and significance of hypoth-
esized  associations  in  a  set  of  variables  including  mediational  relationships  (direct  and 
indirect effects) (MacCallum & Austin, 2000). In this study, the path analysis was defined 
via  structural  equation  modeling  (SEM)  using  the  maximum-likelihood  method  (MLE). 
Goodness-of-fit was tested with chi-square tests (χ2), the root mean square error of approx-
imation  (RMSEA),  the  Bentler’s  Comparative  Fit  Index  (CFI),  the  Tucker–Lewis  Index 
(TLI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). (Bentler, 1990): p > 0.05 
for χ2 test, RMSEA < 0.08, TLI > 0.9, CFI > 0.9 and SRMR < 0.1 was considered adequate 
fit. The global predictive capacity of the model was measured by the coefficient of determi-
nation (CD).

In this work, Holm’s method was also used to control Type-I error due to multiple sta-
tistical  comparisons  (this  procedure  is  included  in  Family-wise  error  rate  stepwise  tech-
niques and it has been demonstrated to be a more powerful test than Bonferroni correction) 
(Holm, 1979). In addition, due to the large set of variables, global measures were selected 
for the predictive models (negative binomial) and the path-analyses. Finally, all the analy-
ses were stratified by the origin of the sample (community versus clinical), with the aim of 
assessing differences in patterns due to the origin of the sample and to allow for generaliza-
tion to original populations.

Results

Characteristics of the Sample and Comparison Between Participants 
with and Without Cyberbullying

The number of patients who met positive screening score for cyberbullying in the commu-
nity sample n = 96 (prevalence = 38.4%), compared to n = 10 into the clinical sample (prev-
alence = 32.3%) (no significant difference was found in the prevalence estimates between 
the  groups:  χ2 = 0.44,  df = 1,  p = 0.506).  Comparing  those  who  reported  to  be  exposed 
to cyberbullying behaviors (n = 96 in the community sample versus n = 10 in the clinical 
sample) no differences emerged in the cyberbullying raw total scores: a mean equal to 1.9 
(SD = 1.5) was found in the community sample versus 2.4 (SD = 2.3) in the clinical sample 
(T = 1.03, df = 104, p = 0.303).

Table 1 includes a description of the study variables stratified by the origin of the sam-
ple, and a comparison based on the presence/absence of exposure to cyberbullying behav-
iors (separate descriptive are reported also for community and clinical samples). No sig-
nificant  differences  in  sociodemographic  variables  were  obtained  comparing  participants 
who reported exposure to cyberbullying, independent of the origin of the sample. In addi-
tion, in the clinical sample no differences between the groups were obtained in the clinical 
measures used. However, in the community sample, exposure to cyberbullying behaviors 
was related to higher emotion dysregulation, difficulties in coping strategies (higher scores

in the first-order factors cognitive desiderate-self, criticism-social and withdrawal scales, in 
the second order factors non-adequate problems and emotions, and in the third order factor 
non-adequate driving), and higher scores in the alcohol use/abuse scale.

Association Between Cyberbullying Severity and Clinical Measures

Table 2 includes the correlation matrix with the partial correlations (adjusted for sex and 
age)  estimating  the  association  between  cyberbullying  with  gambling  severity,  emotion 
regulation, coping strategies and substance abuse. In the community sample, higher cyber-
bulling  severity  was  related  to  higher  emotion  dysregulation  (concretely,  in  the  DERS 
limited emotion regulation, lack of emotional clarity and total scale scores). In the clini-
cal  sample,  higher  cyber-bulling  severity  was  related  to  lower  gambling  severity,  higher 
level  of  lack  of  emotional  clarity  and  most  dysfunctional  coping  strategies  (concretely, 
in the first order factors problem solving, emotional expression, social support and social

Table 3 includes the negative binomial regressions exploring the specific contribution 
of sex, age, gambling severity, emotion regulation and coping strategies (defined as inde-
pendent models) on cyberbullying severity (dependent variable). In the community sample, 
the first model showed no significant interaction parameter between sex and age with the 
remaining clinical variables. The main effects of the final model showed that the only sig-
nificant contributor was the DERS-total score (B = 0.03, p < 0.001). In the clinical sample, 
the  first  model  showed  that  the  interaction  parameter  between  age  with  gambling  sever-
ity obtained significance (p = 0.029), indicating that the association between gambling and 
cyberbullying severity differed depending on the patients’ age. The single effects obtained 
in the final model were interpreted, which indicated the association between the gambling 
severity with the cyberbullying level was higher for the older patients: a) among young age 
patients  (age defined as the  percentile 5  in  the  sample), no  association emerged  between 
gambling level with cyberbullying; among middle age patients (percentile 50 for age) and 
among old age patients (percentile 95 for age), the intensity of the relationship increased 
from B =  − 0.22 (p = 0.009) to B =  − 0.56 (p = 0.012).

Pathways Analysis

Figure 1 includes the path-diagrams for the SEM. Adequate goodness-of-fit was obtained 
in the two models adjusted for the community and clinical samples. Table S1 includes the 
complete results of the models, including the tests for direct, indirect and total effects.

In the community sample, cyberbullying severity was directly related to the DERS-total 
score  (worse  emotion  regulation  predicted  higher  cyberbullying).  In  the  clinical  sample, 
cyberbullying severity was directly related to the adequate-driving coping strategies, while 
an indirect effect was also obtained between age and gambling severity with cyberbullying 
(older age predicted higher gambling severity, while higher gambling severity was related 
to lower cyberbullying severity).

Discussion

Despite the positive benefits of internet and social media among young age people (includ-
ing quick access to information, access to teaching and learning resources, and increased 
levels of social support), the frequency of bullying online has become a widespread com-
mon problem for youths around the world, resulting in a high prevalence of young people 
affected  by  cybervictimization.  This  bullying  is  quite  different  from  “traditional”  forms, 
in the sense that it is not confined to school or the playground and there is no escape for 
victims (young people connect usually through social media and simply go offline is not 
an option for many individuals). Moreover, although cyberbullying is socially considered 
alarming  with  real  severe  consequences  (including  negative  psychological  health  out-
comes),  not  enough  research  has  yet  been  conducted  regarding  its  correlates.  This  study 
estimates  the  presence  of  cyberbullying  behavior  in  a  clinical  sample  of  young  patients 
who met criteria for GD and in a community sample, as well as the potential association 
of this form of bullying with emotion regulation profile, coping strategies, substance use-
abuse and problem gambling severity. The main results of the study showed a high prev-
alence  of  individuals  who  reported  presence  of  cyberbullying  behavior  in  both  samples

(around 1 in 3 individuals in our work have experienced cyberthreats online), and that the 
underlying mechanism and correlates of this victimization was related to the origin of the 
samples (clinical versus population-based).

It is well known that emotions play an essential role in the way how people manage their 
behavior  and  social  interactions  (Cole  et  al.,  2004).  In  our  community  sample,  exposure 
to cyberbullying behaviors was positively related to higher emotion dysregulation. In this 
regard, higher scores in cyberbullying were associated with higher levels of lack of emo-
tional clarity in the clinical sample. This result dovetails with previous studies also report-
ing  a  link  between  these  two  factors  (Hemphill  &  Heerde,  2014;  Hemphill  et  al.,  2015; 

1 3 
Journal of Gambling Studies (2023) 39:1399–1416

Vranjes  et  al.,  2018).  Emotion  dysregulation,  specifically,  has  been  described  to  make  a 
relevant  contribution  differentiating  bullies  and  victims  from  individuals  not  exposed  to 
these problems (Shields & Cicchetti, 2001). Therefore, difficulties in the management of 
emotions in social interactions could be considered as a predictor of cyberbullying (Baron-
celli & Ciucci, 2014).

In  both  the  clinical  and  community  samples,  higher  cyberbullying  severity  was  also 
related to the use of maladaptative coping styles. Previous data have suggested that coping 
strategies in young people may be relevant in the association between bully victimization 
and their psychological well-being (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2014). Data has identified the feel-
ing of ineffectiveness in solving problems in bully victims, as well as passive, emotionally-
oriented and avoidant coping styles (Hansen et al., 2012; Tenenbaum et al., 2011). Specifi-
cally, coping strategies more associated with bullying were rumination and catastrophizing 
(Garnefski & Kraaij, 2014).

Regarding  the  SEM,  in  the  community  sample,  worse  emotion  regulation  predicted 
higher  cyberbullying,  while  in  the  clinical  sample,  cyberbullying  severity  was  directly 
related to a lack of adequate-driving coping strategies. These findings would again dem-
onstrate  that  both  emotional  regulation  and  coping  strategies  are  closely  associated  with 
cyberbullying (Ittel et al., 2014).

The  findings  of  this  study  also  present  an  association,  in  the  community  sample, 
between alcohol use/abuse and having experienced cyberbullying. This observation coin-
cides  with  other  research  highlighting  an  association  between  victimization  through  bul-
lying and high-risk behaviors, such as alcohol and substance use (Khantzian, 1997; Man-
iglio, 2009).

In agreement with the risk taking patterns presented by those subjects who have expe-
rienced  bullying  (Poon,  2016),  we  expected  to  find  higher  levels  of  severity  and  higher 
difficulties  in  emotion  regulation  and  coping  processes  in  the  group  with  a  diagnosis  of 
GD. Studies in this line suggest that victims of bullying show a tendency to overestimate 
benefits, to underestimate risks and to present higher impulsivity levels, common features 
also found in GD (Poon, 2016; Steward et al., 2017) . However, both the control group and 
the clinical group had no differences in GD severity when comparing those subjects who 
had undergone cyberbullying and those who had not. One explanation could be that these 
populations  opt  for  other  types  of  behavior,  such  as  alcohol  consumption,  as  mentioned 
above (Khantzian, 1997; Maniglio, 2009).

Clinical Implications

Cyberbullying  represents  a  high  prevalent  dangerous  form  of  victimization  characterized 
by  harassment  and  humiliation  that  can  be  experienced  through  various  mediums  (e.g., 
e-mail, chats, mobile phones), with harmful correlates in maladaptative coping strategies 
and emotion dysregulation. Experiencing cyberbullying could have a long-lasting impact 
on  the  victims,  who  would  be  predisposed  to  wider  mental  health  problems  such  as  low 
self-stem,  somatic  symptoms,  aggression,  depression,  anxiety  and  substance/behavioral 
related disorders. The findings of the present study highlight the importance of the expo-
sure  to  cyberbullying  in  the  emotion  regulation  and  the  use  of  adaptative  coping  strate-
gies during adolescence and young adulthood in population-based samples and in a clinical 
sample of patients who met criteria for GD, The empirical evidences regarding the impact 
of  this  bullying  form  on  the  variables  analyzed  in  the  work  allows  developing  accurate,

reliable, and valid assessment instruments and planning useful preventive and therapeutic 
interventions  high-risk  individuals  exposed  to  this  type  of  victimization  (in  both  clinical 
and community settings). Therefore, as  other  authors  have suggested,  one  of the aims of 
bullying  and  cyberbullying  prevention  plans  should  be  to  promote  emotional  and  coping 
skills in the classroom (Garaigordobil & Martínez-Valderrey, 2018; Marikutty & Joseph, 
2016; Schokman et al., 2014).

Limitations and Strengths

There  are  limitations  that  should  be  considered  when  interpreting  the  results.  First,  the 
cross-sectional  design  of  the  present  study  does  not  allow  for  establishing  conclusions 
regarding  causality  and  the  direction  of  the  effects.  Longitudinal  studies  are  needed  to 
give essential insights on the underlying mechanisms between these factors and the evolu-
tion and long-term effect of the associations under study. Second, this study has focused 
exclusively  on  the  victims  of  cyberbullying,  without  exploring  the  clinical  profile  of  the 
aggressors.  In  addition,  it  has  not  considered  the  time  elapsed  between  the  victimization 
process and the collection of the study data. Low sample size was also a methodological 
limitation (particularly for the clinical subsample) associated with reduced statistical power 
and  increased  likelihood  of  Type-II  errors  (results  of  this  study  should  be  interpreted  in 
a  more  descriptive  than  inferential  way,  pending  that  future  research  with  larger  clinical 
samples confirm/validate our findings). Finally, emotion regulation and copying strategies 
were assessed using exclusively self-report measures, which are unable to fully capture the 
complexity of these constructs.

Regarding strengths, this study included an extensive assessment including standardized 
measures of the cyberbullying presence, the gambling severity, coping strategies and (dys)
regulation  emotion.  Moreover,  the  statistical  analysis  of  data  recruited  from  GD  patients 
and from a community sample allows to obtain evidences of the frequency of the cyber-
bullying victimization and the associations between the variables under study possible to 
generalize across clinical and also population-based settings.
