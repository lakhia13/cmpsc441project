Abstract

Background: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing
depressive symptoms. However, little is known how and for whom therapeutic change occurs, specifically in
web-based interventions. This study focuses on the mediators, moderators and predictors of change during a
web-based ACT intervention.

Methods: Data from 236 adults from the general population with mild to moderate depressive symptoms,
randomized to either web-based ACT (n = 82) or one of two control conditions (web-based Expressive Writing
(EW; n = 67) and a waiting list (n = 87)), were analysed. Single and multiple mediation analyses, and exploratory
linear regression analyses were performed using PROCESS and linear regression analyses, to examine mediators,
moderators and predictors on pre- to post- and follow-up treatment change of depressive symptoms.
Results: The treatment effect of ACT versus the waiting list was mediated by psychological flexibility and two
mindfulness facets. The treatment effect of ACT versus EW was not significantly mediated. The moderator analyses
demonstrated that the effects of web-based ACT did not vary according to baseline patient characteristics when
compared to both control groups. However, higher baseline depressive symptoms and positive mental health and
lower baseline anxiety were identified as predictors of outcome across all conditions. Similar results are found for
follow-up.
Conclusions: The findings of this study corroborate the evidence that psychological flexibility and mindfulness are
distinct process mechanisms that mediate the effects of web-based ACT intervention. The results indicate that there
are no restrictions to the allocation of web-based ACT intervention and that web-based ACT can work for different
subpopulations.

Background
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an em-
pirically based behavioural cognitive therapy that uses
acceptance and mindfulness strategies together with
commitment and behaviour change strategies, to in-
crease the ability to act in accordance with personal
values in the presence of life adversities [1, 2]. The ef-
fectiveness of ACT in reducing depressive symptoms has
been established in several recent meta-analyses [3–5].
In addition, there is growing evidence for the efficacy of
web-based ACT interventions [6–11]. Besides evaluating
treat-
the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological
ments, randomized controlled trials can be valuable in
revealing how (i.e., mediators) and for whom (i.e., mod-
erators) therapeutic change occurs. Mediators and mod-
erators are important to the further optimization of
treatments and their clinical and cost-effectiveness. Spe-
cifically, knowledge of mediators of change enables treat-
ment components to be included that are crucial to
recovery [12]. Furthermore, both nonspecific treatment
predictors and specific treatment moderators indicate
who benefits from treatment, or under which conditions
treatment works best [13]. Moderators and predictors
can help tailor interventions to different subpopulations
with possibly different causal mechanisms of disorders
and ultimately improve clinical decision about treatment
[13, 14]. Research into potential mediators and modera-
tors of action in web-based ACT interventions is how-
ever in its infancy. The focus of this study is therefore
on the possible mediators, moderators and predictors of
change during a web-based ACT intervention.

The central therapeutic mechanism in ACT is psycho-
logical flexibility, which is the ability to act in accord-
ance with intrinsically motivating values or goals while
being in contact with the present moment [1, 2]. People
who are psychological flexible also score high on accept-
ance, which is seen as a more effective strategy for regu-
lating negative emotions and thoughts than experiential
avoidance, i.e., the persistent and generally fruitless at-
tempts to avoid unwanted private experiences such as
feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations [1, 15, 16]. In
the model underlying ACT psychological flexibility is de-
fined by six interrelated therapeutic processes: accept-
ance, cognitive defusion, contact with the present
moment, self-as-context, values, and committed action.
Mindfulness is taught in the context of the first four
processes of the ACT model, where exercises are used
to enhance an observing and non-judging self, together
with the awareness and acceptance of unwanted private
experiences such as thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness
is often referred to as intentionally paying attention to
present moment experiences in a non-judgemental way
[17]. Mindfulness, as measured by the Five Facet Mind-
is conceptualized in
fulness Questionnaire (FFMQ),

several facets, which are observing (noticing or attending
to internal and external experiences), describing (label-
ling internal experiences with words), acting with aware-
ness (attending to one’s activities of the moment), non-
judging of
inner experience (taking a non-evaluative
stance toward thoughts and feelings), and non-reactivity
to inner experience (allowing thoughts and feelings to
come and go). Baer et al. [18] stated that non-reactivity
and non-judging may be seen as ways of operationalizing
acceptance. They found a correlation of r = .49 between
the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II;
measuring psychological flexibility) and the non-judging
facet of the FFMQ. Although the AAQ-II and FFMQ are
not meant to measure the same construct, Fledderus
et al. [19] found that the AAQ-II was positively related
to mindfulness facets and positive mental health and
negatively related to depression and anxiety. The mind-
fulness facets correlated significantly with the AAQ-II,
with – in agreement with Bear [18] - the strongest rela-
tion between AAQ-II and non-judging. The strongest re-
lation between AAQ-II and non-judging (r = .54) suggest
that the AAQ-II and the non-judging facet of the FFMQ
measure are related but distinct constructs. The results
also showed that
additional
the AAQ-II
variance in relevant outcomes such as depression, anx-
iety, and positive mental health. To date,
there are
several studies that have suggested that augmented
mindfulness mediates the effects of an ACT intervention
(e.g., [20–22]). Research into psychological flexibility as
a mediator in ACT interventions confirms that psycho-
logical flexibility is a core component of the theoretical
framework of ACT (e.g., [1, 15, 20, 23, 24]).

explains

As opposed to face-to-face, web-based interventions
offer advantages in availability and accessibility, but non-
adherence or high drop-out is an issue [25, 26]. Some
researchers have suggested that in web-based interven-
tions specificity of effects can account for the higher
drop-out rates that are common in web-based interven-
tions [14, 25]. Given this higher specificity of effects and
possible individual variability in self-support via web-
based interventions, it is important to study moderators
and predictors. Yet, little is known about the moderators
of change of web-based ACT interventions, and research
into moderator and predictor analyses of web-based
ACT interventions for depressions is lacking. There is
some limited research on moderators and predictors in
face-to-face ACT interventions for anxiety,
indicating
that factors such as socio-demographic characteristics
do not moderate or predict outcome, and that factors
such as mood disorder comorbidity may be predictors
and/or moderators [24, 27, 28]. Also, a study by Flaxman
and Bond [29] on worksite stress management training
(SMT), based on ACT, showed that the impact of SMT
was significantly moderated by baseline distress. For

mediators of change, the number of studies doing for-
mal mediational analyses of psychological
flexibility
and mindfulness in web-based ACT interventions is
small [7, 30]. In the study of Trompetter et al. [30]
improvements in psychological flexibility mediated the
effect of web-based ACT on psychological distress,
further substantiating that psychological flexibility is a
the ACT model. Also, Bricker
core component of
et al. [7] found that acceptance processes mediated
the effects on smoking cessation through greater ac-
ceptance of physical urges, cognitions, and emotions.

The aim of the current study was to identify media-
tors, moderators and predictors of participant improve-
ment in the web-based ACT intervention in a recently
published randomized controlled trial (RCT) [11]. The
primary objective was to test the hypothesis that pre- to
post-treatment changes in psychological flexibility and
mindfulness mediated the effects of the web-based ACT
intervention on depressive symptoms. A second object-
ive was to explore which participant baseline character-
istics and baseline symptoms moderated or predicted
treatment effects. These latter analyses were considered
exploratory given the lack of research so far.

Methods
Participants and procedure
The sample for the current study stems from the original
sample in the RCT on the effectiveness of web-based pub-
lic mental health intervention based on ACT [11]. The
study was approved by an independent medical ethics
committee for research in mental health settings in the
Netherlands (METiGG; number NL33619.097.100).
In
addition, this study has been recorded in the Dutch pri-
mary trial register for clinical trials (Netherlands Trial
Register, NTR2736). In brief, participants with mild to
moderate depressive symptoms were recruited through
advertisements in Dutch national newspapers and on the
Internet. A webpage created for the purpose of this study
included an outline of the study design, and a registration
possibility for participation in the trial. Within the web-
page candidates filled out a secured computerized in-
formed consent. After receiving the informed consent,
initial screening was conducted online for checking the
in- and exclusion criteria by use of a self-report question-
naire in a fully automated computerized assessment bat-
tery. Study inclusion criteria were: a) an age of 18 years or
older with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (> 10
on the Dutch version of the Center of Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale; CES-D [31]), and b) completion
of the baseline measurement. Applicants were excluded if
on initial screening they reported: (a)
few depressive
symptoms (≤10 on the CES-D); (b) received psychological
or psychopharmacological
for mental com-
plaints within the last three months; (c) reading or writing

treatment

problems due to insufficient Dutch language skills;
and (d) an inability to invest approximately 30 min
per day up to three hours per week in the interven-
tion and daily practices. Furthermore, participants
with severe psychopathology were excluded when di-
agnosed with a current severe mental disorder or
when having a moderate to high suicide risk, accord-
ing to the Dutch version of the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview [32, 33] and the Sheehan
Disability Scale [34].

Of the 436 persons that were assessed for eligibility,
236 participants were randomly allocated to either ACT
(n = 82), an active control condition based on Expressive
writing (EW; n = 67) or to a waiting list control condi-
tion (WLC; n = 87). Figure 1 shows the CONSORT flow
of the participants. Baseline characteristics can be found
in the
in Table 1. Due to a programming error
randomization procedure, the number of participants in
each condition differed. There were no significant differ-
ences at baseline between the conditions for any of the
demographic variables or outcome measures, except for
gender [X2 (2, n = 236) = 22.78, p < 0.00; percentage of fe-
male was higher in the ACT group, followed by WLC,
followed by EW].

Intervention
In the current study an ACT-protocol called ‘Living to
the full’ [35] was used, which has an explicit focus on
mindfulness [11, 35]. The web-based ACT intervention
comprised of nine online modules, that could be worked
through in nine to twelve weeks. This self-help interven-
tion has shown to be effective in reducing depressive
and anxiety symptoms, and improving positive mental
health, psychological
flexibility and mindfulness, as a
group course and as a bibliotherapy intervention with e-
mail support [31, 36, 37]. The nine sessions are based on
six core processes of ACT that together promote psy-
chological flexibility [2]. Each module uses experiential
exercises and metaphors to illustrate the ACT processes,
text messages, tailored stories for motivation, and an op-
tion to personalize the homepage. Furthermore, partici-
pants were encouraged to practice daily mindfulness
exercises that were provided on audio, downloadable
within the web-based intervention. Weekly e-mail coun-
selling by trained graduate psychology students was of-
and
feedback,
fered for personal
support. For a comprehensive description of the devel-
opment of the intervention see Kelders et al. [38].

The active control condition was a web-based Expres-

education on emotions and emotion regulation, and was

followed by instructions of the method of EW. In gen-
eral, people were instructed to write about emotional ex-
periences for 15 to 30 min on at least three days during
one week. E-mail counselling was offered similarly to the
web-based ACT intervention.

Participants in the waiting list condition were offered
no intervention and were free to access other forms of
care. Six months after baseline these participants could
start a web-based intervention of choice.

there was no restricted access to care for the WLC,
non-study treatment was checked but revealed no
difference between the conditions. Overall, the results
showed that on the short term the web-based ACT
intervention was significantly more effective to both
control conditions, but that both web-based interven-
tions had similar effects on depressive symptoms and
secondary measures at 6- and 12-month follow-up.

Summary of previously reported results from the RCT
As reported in Pots et al.
[11], analyses using re-
peated measures ANOVA showed that the web-based
ACT intervention was superior to both the active
control condition (EW intervention) and the WLC,
on all outcome measures (depressive symptoms, anx-
iety and positive mental health) and process variables

(psychological
facets observing and acting with

small to moderate and ranged from 0.35 to 0.56. The

Measures
In this study, we used the outcome measures of the RCT
assessed at baseline, at post-treatment 3 months after
baseline (directly after the intervention), and at 6- and
12-month follow-up. The process variables were used as
possible mediators. All other measures functioned as
possible moderators/predictors of change and were
assessed at baseline, prior to randomization.

As outcome measures the Dutch version of the Center
of Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale was used.
The CES-D (20 items, score 0–60) measures symptoms
of depression in the general population. Respondents
rate to what extent they experienced depressive symp-
toms in the previous week. Higher scores mean more
depressive symptoms [40, 41], and a score of 16 or
higher is indicative of clinically relevant depressive
symptoms [42, 43].

Pots et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:158

Measures for mediation were the Acceptance and
(AAQ-II), measuring psy-
Action Questionnaire-II
chological flexibility,
and the Five Facet Mindfulness
Questionnaire – Short Form (FFMQ-SF), measuring
mindfulness. The AAQ-II (10 items, score 10–70) mea-
sures the subject’s willingness to be in contact with
negative private events, the acceptance of these events,
and the ability to live according to his/her values.
Higher scores indicate more psychological
flexibility
[19, 44]. The FFMQ-SF (24 items, score 24–120) was
used to measure mindfulness in five sub-dimensions: (1)
observing (4 items), defined in terms of noticing or at-
tending to internal and external experiences; (2) de-
scribing (5 items), defined in terms of
labelling
internal
acting with
experiences with words;
awareness (5 items), defined in terms of attending to
one’s activities of
(4) non-judging of
the moment;
inner experience (5 items), defined in terms of taking
a non-evaluative stance toward thoughts and feelings;
and (5) non-reactivity to inner experience (5 items),
defined in terms of allowing thoughts and feelings to
come and go, without getting caught up in or carried
away by them. Facet scores range from 4 to 25 (ex-
cept for observing, which ranges from 4 to 20), with
higher scores indicating more mindfulness [18, 45].

Measures for moderation and prediction were de-
mographic
anxiety
symptoms, positive mental health, and diagnostic classi-
fication. Demographic variables that were assessed as
possible moderators/predictors were age, gender, and
educational level. For depressive symptoms the baseline
score of the CES-D was also used as a moderator/pre-
dictor. For anxiety symptoms the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A; 7 items,
score 0–21) measures symptoms of anxiety. Higher
scores mean more anxiety symptoms [46, 47]. Positive
mental health was measured with the Mental Health
Continuum- Short Form (MHC-SF; 14 items, score 0–5)
measures three dimensions of positive mental health:
(1) emotional well-being, defined as the presence of
positive feelings/satisfaction with life; (2) social well-
being, defined as positive functioning in community
life; and (3) psychological well-being, defined as posi-
tive functioning in individual
life. In this study the
total MHC-SF score was used, with higher scores
indicating greater emotional, social and psychological
well-being [48, 49]. Lastly, diagnostic classification
was measured with the Dutch version of the Mini-
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [32, 33],
supplemented with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)
[34], was used to measure the severity of a disorder. Sever-
ity was defined as at least two areas of role functioning
with severe role impairment due to the disorder
according to the SDS. The MINI and SDS were

conducted by telephone at baseline. Diagnostic clas-
sifications that were assessed as possible moderators/
predictors were current disorder, current depressive
disorder, and comorbidity.

performed using the SPSS Missing Value Analysis to im-
pute all missing data on the continuous measures with
the expectation-maximization (EM) method [50]. Avail-
able data was 96.6 % at baseline and 84.5 % at post-
treatment. Prior to the main analyses, one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were con-
ducted to examine baseline differences in all potential
moderators/predictor variables between the web-based
ACT intervention and the two control conditions. Over-
all, significance of mediators, moderators and predictors
were interpreted at p < 0.05. The statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS 20.

Both simple and multiple mediation analyses were
performed using PROCESS [51]. PROCESS is based on
regression-based path-analytic framework and com-
bines mediation and moderation into one conditional
process model. PROCESS estimates the indirect effect
and bias-corrected confidence intervals (CI). All ana-
lyses were based on 5000 bootstrapping samples. An
indirect effect was considered significant when the CI
did not include zero. The change score (baseline to
post-treatment, baseline to 6-months, baseline to 12-
months) on the outcome measure CES-D was entered
as the dependent variable. The dummy variable repre-
senting treatment (ACT = 1, WLC = 0 or EW = 0) and
the potential mediator (measured as the change score
baseline to post-treatment, baseline to 6 months, base-
line to 12 months) were entered as
independent
variables. To control for variation in outcome score the
baseline score of CES-D was entered as a covariate.
Analyses were done separately for the web-based ACT
intervention compared to WLC, and the web-based
ACT intervention compared to the web-based EW
intervention.

Linear regression models were applied for moderation
variables using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. During
the analyses, each potential moderator was mean
centered. The change score (baseline to post-treatment,
baseline to 6 months, baseline to 12 months) on the out-
come measure CES-D was entered as the dependent
variable. The dummy variable representing treatment,
the mean centred potential moderator, and the treat-
ment by mean centered moderator variable were entered
as independent variables. To control for variation in out-
come score, also in the moderator analyses, the baseline
score of CES-D was entered as a covariate. Analyses

were done separately for the web-based ACT interven-
tion compared to WLC, and compared to the web-based
EW intervention. In general, when there was a signifi-
cant interaction effect the variable entered was inter-
preted as being a moderator of change.

For the predictor analyses linear regression analyses
across all three groups were performed using SPSS 22,
with the change score of depressive symptoms (baseline
to post-treatment, baseline to 6 months, baseline to
12 months) as the dependent variable and the presumed
predictors as independent variables. The outcome was
adjusted for baseline values of depression by adding the
baseline score of the CES-D as an additional independ-
ent variable in the regression. Also, multiple linear re-
gressions were performed by simultaneously entering all
proposed predictors as independent variables into the
multiple regression. On account of the exploratory na-
ture of the moderator and predictor analyses the bor-
derline p-value was not adjusted.

Results
Mediation analyses
Table 2 shows the results of the outcomes of the simple
mediation analyses. The web-based ACT intervention, as
compared to the WLC, showed significantly greater im-
provement on the primary outcome measure post-
treatment (total treatment effect β = −4.73, p < .001). The
bootstrap results for the indirect effects of the web-
based ACT intervention on the WLC showed that

changes in psychological flexibility and all mindfulness
facets (except acting with awareness) significantly medi-
ated the effect of the web-based ACT intervention on
depressive symptoms post-treatment. Figure 2 shows the
results of the multiple mediation model, comparing the
web-based ACT intervention to the WLC. When all
mediators were entered into the model, three process
variables remained significant mediators of the effect on
depressive symptoms: psychological flexibility (indirect
effect β = −1.691, 95 % CI −2.96 to −0.76), and the mind-
fulness facets observing (indirect effect β = −0.428, 95 %
CI −1.17 to −0.02) and non-judging of inner experience
(indirect effect β = −0.518, 95 % CI −1.52 to −0.10).
Follow-up analyses from T0 to T2 revealed somewhat
different outcomes, with no significant mediating effect

tors were entered in the multiple mediation model, only
from T0 to T1 the mindfulness facet non-reactivity to inner
experience remained a significant mediator (indirect effect
β = −0.5194, 95 % -1.54 to −0.00). No significant mediators
remained for T0 to T2 and T0 to T3.

Moderation and predictor analyses
Table 3 shows the results of the moderator analyses for
the web-based ACT intervention compared to the WLC
and the web-based EW intervention respectively from
baseline to post-treatment. Compared to both control

conditions no single significant moderator emerged, indi-
cating that there were no significant differences for demo-
graphic characteristics, psychological measures, diagnostic
classification or comorbidity. Follow-up analyses showed
similar results, except for current disorder at T0 when
comparing the web-based ACT intervention versus the
web-based EW intervention from baseline to 12 months
(T0 to T3). Participants in the web-based ACT interven-
tion having a current disorder at T0 had more change in
depressive symptoms from baseline to 12 months, when
compared to the web-based EW intervention. No other
significant moderators were found from T0 to T2 or from
T0 to T3, for both ACT versus WLC and ACT versus EW.
Table 4 shows the variables that were statistically sig-
nificant predictors of change in depressive symptoms
over time across all conditions. Participants reporting
more depressive symptoms and positive mental health
(emotional, social and psychological well-being) at base-
line had greater change in depressive symptoms from
pre- to post-treatment, adjusted for baseline depressive
symptoms. However, participants with more anxiety
symptoms had less change in depressive symptoms post-
treatment, adjusted for baseline depressive symptoms.
No predictor effects were found for age, gender, level
of education, or diagnostic classification. When all
proposed predictors were entered into the multivariate re-
gression model only baseline depressive and anxiety symp-
toms and emotional well-being remained significant

follow-up baseline depressive and anxiety symptoms
and psychological well-being remained significant
predictors of change in depressive symptoms, and at
12 months follow-up only baseline depressive symp-
toms and psychological well-being remained a signifi-
cant predictor of change in depressive symptoms.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to examine why and
how a web-based ACT intervention for depressive symp-
toms is effective, and to identify for whom and under
what circumstances this intervention has differential ef-
fects. Psychological flexibility and two mindfulness facets
were the strongest mediators of the treatment effect of
the ACT intervention versus the WLC. Only change in
the mindfulness facet non-reactivity to inner experience
appeared as mediator of the treatment effect of the ACT
intervention versus the web-based EW intervention. The
moderator analyses demonstrated that the effects of
the web-based ACT intervention on depressive
symptoms did not vary according to baseline patient
characteristics when compared to both control groups.
However, baseline symptoms and positive mental
health were identified as predictors of outcome when
collapsing across all conditions. Follow-up results on
mediation and moderation/prediction were somewhat
similar.

The findings of this study on mediation corroborate
the evidence that psychological flexibility and mindful-
ness are distinct process mechanisms that mediate the
effect of web-based ACT intervention on depressive
symptoms. This confirms the relevance of psycho-
logical flexibility as the central therapeutic mechanism
in the ACT model and further strengthens the theoret-
ical framework of ACT [2]. Furthermore, our results
give empirical support for mindfulness as an important
mediator in the ACT model. Both the processes of psy-
chological flexibility and mindfulness can be consid-
ered within a broader context of emotion regulation as
a transdiagnostic mechanism of change in mindfulness-
[52–54]).
and acceptance based interventions (e.g.,
Chiesa et al. [55] suggest that such interventions may
in general enhance positive emotional regulation strat-
egies, as well as self-compassion levels, and decrease
rumination and experiential avoidance. They specific-
ally suggested that short-term mindfulness meditation
practitioners might achieve these benefits by means of
a top-down regulation of the prefrontal areas on limbic
areas [52]. Hence, the studies on the broader context of
emotion regulation endorse mindfulness and psycho-
logical flexibility processes as an emotion regulation
process within the theoretical framework of ACT.

Mediation analyses of ACT versus EW showed that no
mediators remained significant in the follow-up analyses

of the multiple mediation, in contrast to the simple me-
diation. In the previously reported results from the RCT
[11], we found that the web-based ACT intervention
had similar effects on depressive symptoms and second-
ary measures after 6 and 12 months compared to the
EW intervention. Additionally, the web-based EW con-
dition showed significant improvement compared with
the WLC from baseline to follow-up (T0 to T2) for psy-
chological flexibility and some facets of mindfulness, and
no significant improvement on other outcome measures.
The results of the current study show that there is no
unique mediator of change when comparing the web-
based ACT intervention versus the web-based EW inter-
vention. These findings, combined with the results from
the RCT, suggest that the web-based EW intervention
shares important therapeutic mechanisms with the web-
based ACT intervention, notably psychological flexibility
and facets of mindfulness. This lack of specificity is not
an isolated finding. A recent meta-analysis of Goyal et
al. [56] found that studies comparing a mindfulness
intervention with comparison conditions (active con-
trols) showed no significant differences on the FFMQ or
other mindfulness measures. Goldberg et al. [57] com-
pared a Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction program
with an active control condition that did not include the
instruction in mindfulness meditation, and a waiting list
control. In accordance with our results their active con-
trol condition also showed an improvement over time
on the FFMQ, suggesting that their active control condi-
tion did induce mindfulness although it was not specific-
ally trained. The literature on the processes of change in
EW is however still in its infancy. Some researchers have
indicated that acceptance or experiential disclosure is an
important mechanism [39, 58]. The results of this study
confirm the concept that acceptance is a process mech-
anism of EW as both psychological flexibility and mind-
fulness encompass acceptance, but future studies are
necessary to shed more light on the therapeutic mecha-
nisms in EW. This might, however, prove difficult in lack
of a solid theoretical model underlying EW.

A second aim of this study was to explore moderators
and predictors of change to identify characteristics of
those likely to benefit. Since none of the potential mod-
erators were significant for ACT versus WLC and these
effects were maintained in the follow-up analyses, the
results indicate that there are no restrictions to the allo-
cation of the web-based ACT intervention and that the
web-based ACT intervention can work for different sub-
populations. This is a significant finding, as web-based
impact in
interventions can have a large incremental
availability and accessibility of interventions [59–61]. To
attain this impact, however, it is highly necessary for web-
based interventions to ensure treatment adherence in
addition to treatment effectiveness. The high adherence in

Pots et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:158 

Page 11 of 13

this study might indicate feasibility and compatibility with
the users by using a holistic approach based on persuasive
technology, such as the usage of SMS support, multi-
media, feedback and tailoring, which has been shown to
be positively related to adherence [62]. This might indicate
that the persuasive technology used in the web-based
ACT intervention made the intervention more suitable to
individual’s needs. When comparing the web-based ACT
intervention versus the web-based EW intervention simi-
lar results were found, except for a single moderator at
12 months follow-up, notably having a current disorder at
baseline. This result is interesting as it indicates that hav-
ing a current disorder at baseline is predictive of more im-
provement in depressive symptoms at 12 months follow-
up, when receiving ACT versus EW. No other moderators
were found for ACT versus EW. In short, the results sug-
gest that the level of symptoms is more severe ACT seems
to be more beneficial at long term follow-up, compared to
EW. In addition to moderator analyses the predictor ana-
lyses indicated that participants reporting more depressive
symptoms, and emotional, psychological and social well-
being at baseline, had greater change in depressive symp-
toms from pre- to post-treatment. However, having more
anxiety symptoms at baseline seemed to lead to less
from pre-to post-
change in depressive symptoms
treatment. Follow-up results showed similar results on the
univariate analyses. In the multivariate model baseline de-
pressive and anxiety symptoms, and psychological well-
being remained significant predictors of change in depres-
sive symptoms at 6 months follow-up, and only baseline
depressive
psychological well-being
remained a significant predictor of change in depressive
symptoms at 12 months follow-up. These results indicate
that people with more depressive symptoms and positive
psychological functioning have the best opportunities for
improvement. This latter finding is in accordance with the
finding that positive mental health is a protective factor
against mental illness [63, 64]. Previous studies in different
populations on moderators and predictors of face-to-face
ACT interventions are sparse and non-conclusive on what
moderators and predictors are specific to help tailor inter-
ventions to different subpopulations [24, 27–29, 31, 65].
Some studies found that greater baseline symptoms, neur-
oticism, and experiential avoidance are moderators or pre-
dictors, but the results are not consistent (e.g., [24, 27, 31,
65]). A recent meta-analysis on 49 randomized controlled
trails Comparing computerised Cognitive Behaviour Ther-
apy (CCBT) to other therapies and waiting list controls,
sheds some light on moderators of web-based interven-
tions [66]. The findings indicated that the benefit of CCBT
decreases as age increases. Also type of control group
moderated effect sizes, with higher effect sizes for com-
parisons of CCBT with inactive controls. Interestingly, no
further significant moderating effect were found for any of

symptoms

and

the variables (demographic characteristics, severity of
symptoms, type of intervention, type of support). A highly
prevalent and important potential moderator is comorbid-
ity. In this study, comorbidity was not found to be a mod-
erator or predictor of effects, which is of importance
because the majority of web-based interventions have tar-
geted specific disorders. Interestingly, Wolitzky et al. [27]
found that ACT outperformed CBT among those with co-
morbid mood disorders. In contrast, Niles et al. [24] also
compared CBT with ACT and found no such effect. Des-
pite the importance of these findings on face-to-face inter-
ventions, it is to be expected that results of face-to-face
ACT interventions are not comparable to web-based ACT
interventions as these latter are expected to place a greater
burden on self-efficacy or resilience. The fact that in the
current study there were no moderators found when com-
paring ACT versus WLC, suggests that web-based ACT
can work for different subpopulations. As the analyses
were exploratory, the results should be interpreted with
caution. Overall, we can conclude that the studies so far
that have included moderator and predictor analyses in
web-based ACT interventions are sparse and mostly ex-
ploratory, highlighting the necessity of research in this
area. Future research should include more formal moder-
ator and predictor analyses to be able to better tailor indi-
viduals to treatment.

This study has several limitations. First, the RCT was not
powered for the moderator analyses. Since the analyses
were exploratory and post-hoc, the absence of significant
moderators could well be a result of inadequate statistical
power [67]. However, our study is in accordance with the
methodological requirements of exploratory moderator
analyses [68]. Second, all mediation analyses were per-
formed using baseline to follow-up measurements of both
processes and outcomes, precluding an evaluation of tem-
poral precedence. Future studies could use more sophisti-
the
cated designs to address temporal precedence of
process variables, such as a cross-lagged panel design [69].
Third, the original sample in the RCT was predominantly
female with a rather high level of education, recruited from
the general Dutch community through newspapers. This
restricts the generalizability of the results to gender and
education. The fact that our sample was fairly homoge-
neous could also be an argument for the fact that no mod-
erators were found [29]. Fourth, in this study we focused
on the overarching processes of the theoretical model ACT,
psychological flexibility and mindfulness. Nowadays, more
specific measures of the individual core processes of ACT
such as the Engaged Living Scale [70] measuring an en-
gaged response style, are available.

Conclusions
Overall, this study was the first to assess mediators,
moderators and predictors of change in a web-based

Pots et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:158

ACT treatment for depressive symptoms. The findings
demonstrate that web-based ACT is successful in enhan-
cing psychological flexibility and facets of mindfulness
and that these changes mediate the short and long-term
effects on depressive symptoms. The findings also dem-
onstrate that at present there is no reason to exclude
people from web-based ACT, though when the level of
depressive symptoms is more severe web-based ACT
seems to be more beneficial at long term follow-up,
compared to web-based EW. Furthermore, higher levels
of depressive symptoms and higher levels of psycho-
logical well-being predict better long term outcomes.
