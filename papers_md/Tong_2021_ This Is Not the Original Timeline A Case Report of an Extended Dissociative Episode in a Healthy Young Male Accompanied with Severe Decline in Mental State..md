Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative
disorders can be described and understood using the combination of ﬁve core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation,
identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in
diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the
relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no
signiﬁcant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to
agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No signiﬁcant ﬁndings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than
prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a
psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of
consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no
signiﬁcant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs
of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7
days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the
COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient
reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspeciﬁed, was given.
This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There
are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible beneﬁts
of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.

1. Introduction

Dissociative (conversion) disorder (F44, ICD-10) is an
umbrella term overarching various subtypes of dissociative
disorders like but shares the common themes of partial or
complete impairment of memories, awareness of identity,
sensations, or control of body movements. From a medical
perspective, patients with dissociative disorders have no
physical or neurological problems. Episodes are often associ-
ated with traumatic life events or psychological stress. Disso-
ciative disorders are underrecognised in general, and

dissociative (conversion) disorder, unspeciﬁed (F44.9),
is
even less prevalent; hence, it is no surprise that limited liter-
ature exists around the subject. Available studies have shown
that dissociative disorders have a lifetime prevalence of about
10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting
[1]. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) (F44.8) is the most
pervasive and most common out of the group of dissociative
disorders, forming up to 5%, leaving the remaining 5% split
between the lesser reported subtypes [2]. The onset of disso-
ciative episodes is usually sudden and usually follows trau-
matic or stressful events [2]. Duration of dissociative

2

episodes can range from hours to days but typically not more
than 2 weeks [3–7]. Here, we present a case of a young male
who experienced a dissociative episode over a prolonged
period of time—4 weeks, with a unique mix of psychiatric
and behavioural symptoms including formal thought disor-
der accompanied with severe thought block and word salad,
purposeless wandering, chaotic behaviour, and bizarre delu-
sions. Whilst we had various initial diﬀerential diagnoses,
we explain later in the discussion section why the other dif-
ferentials are unlikely and how this mix of symptoms has
prompted us to give him a diagnosis of dissociative (conver-
sion) disorder, unspeciﬁed (F44.9).

2. Case Report

A 21-year-old male initially presented to the Accident and
Emergency (A&E) department of a district general hospital
with increased anxiety reporting that they felt like he was
dying. He had a background of high functioning autism,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and no signiﬁcant
physical health problems. In terms of family history, he was
the only child and had no signiﬁcant family history of medi-
cal nor psychiatric illnesses. He admitted to using cocaine
that day but subsequent collateral history from his aunt,
whom he was staying with at the time denied this. A&E doc-
tors diagnosed him as having a panic attack and discharged
him shortly after back to his aunt’s farm. Within hours, he
presented to A&E again with increased signs of agitation,
pacing around, and being nonverbal. As such, no further his-
tory could be obtained from him. Initial bloodwork from
A&E looking at full blood count, liver function, renal proﬁle,
and inﬂammatory markers were normal. Urine toxic sub-
stance screen was negative. The only positive ﬁndings were
low phosphate 0.35 mmol/L and raised prolactin 737 mu/L
despite no previous antipsychotic use. X-ray of the skull
revealed no fractures. At this time, diﬀerential diagnoses
included meningitis, encephalitis, psychosis, and delirium.
MRI head subsequently revealed a normal-sized pituitary
gland, and no speciﬁc abnormalities were seen intracranially.
A&E then started treatment for IV acyclovir for prophylaxis
against potential encephalitis. He was moved to the acute
medical unit where his hypophosphataemia was treated with
oral phosphate replacement and levels returned to normal
shortly after. A week later, lumbar puncture analysis returned
negative for bacteria and viruses. Due to this unusual presen-
tation, he was referred to the mental health liaison of the
acute psychiatric unit for mental health assessment and was
formally admitted to our acute psychiatric unit for treatment
9 days after initial presentation.

By the time of admission, he was displaying severe disori-
entation to time, place, and person. Thought block was evi-
dent and major, accompanied by markedly limited speech.
He appeared to be in an altered state of consciousness and
had a dazed confused look, accompanied with an almost
catatonic-like physical presentation whereby there was
increased muscle tone in upper and lower limbs bilaterally
but was able to withdraw sharply to needles when doctors
attempted phlebotomy. Movements were few and spastic.
There were no features associated with an ictal episode. To

quote some of his word salad—“this is not the original,” “this
is not the right timeline,” “two people ﬁghting,” “two people
joined in the middle, diﬀerent timelines.” He did on occasion
seem able to answer a yes/no question but with great eﬀort
and could never remember what he said. He was still able
to withdraw from the pain from an attempted venepuncture.
Mental state examination demonstrated a relatively well-
kempt young man who had poor eye contact but when eye
contact was made, displayed an intense stare. His speech
was of normal tone and volume but very stilted. Contents
of speech were disjointed and bizarre. Mood was subjectively
and objectively euthymic. Thoughts were considered to be
very disordered and chaotic. From what we could make out
of his jumbled and limited speech, it seemed like he was occa-
sionally describing two people arguing, possibly suggesting
auditory hallucinations. He was disorientated to time, per-
son, and place, and he lacked insight and capacity with regard
to his mental state.

We then prescribed him lorazepam 1 mg four times daily
and quetiapine 50 mg daily with a plan of increasing it to
300 mg in ﬁve days in the hope of ruling out psychosis. Five
days later, there was no change in presentation in this patient
as he continued to display symptoms of thought block and
jumbled speech. From what we could discern from his
speech, it seemed like he had delusions about him not living
in the correct timeline; his DNA is not being his own, and his
mother was not his original birth mother. He did however
start to mobilise and walked around the ward albeit with a
slightly spastic gait. Behaviour remained bizarre as he was
often found removing his clothes and walking around aim-
lessly on the ward. As quetiapine did not appear to be work-
ing, we decided to replace quetiapine with haloperidol 5 mg
once daily and to replace lorazepam with diazepam 10 mg
three times daily. We then added sertraline 50 mg once every
morning. Unfortunately, he shortly developed some extrapy-
ramidal side eﬀects (EPSEs)—leg stiﬀness from haloperidol,
and we replaced it with aripiprazole 10 mg once daily after
three days. Procyclidine 5 mg three times daily was found
to be helpful in treating the EPSEs.

One week later, we repeated blood tests which revealed a
continued rise of prolactin and reduced parathyroid hor-
mone as the only positive ﬁndings. Upon discussion with
the endocrinology department, the rising trend of prolactin
was believed to be secondary to antipsychotic use. Further-
more, since the recent MRI was unremarkable, we felt it did
not warrant further investigation. Blood was also negative
for NMDA receptor antibodies, Treponema pallidum anti-
bodies, hepatitis B and C antibodies, and HIV 1&2 antige-
n/antibodies. By the 19th day postadmission, presentation
remained unchanged except with the addition of increased
frequency of agitation episodes which include but not limited
to using excessive strength to hold onto staﬀ, throwing of
ward furniture, not complying with staﬀ instructions, and
trying to access staﬀ areas with force. In view of this, we
increased aripiprazole dose to 20 mg once a day. He contin-
ued to be wandering aimlessly on the ward, speech remained
mainly incoherent, but word range had expanded slightly to
being able to speak half sentences. For example, “Jesus, these
are genuinely not one of the original sounds or thoughts or

Case Reports in Psychiatry

sound tracks,” “These are both our original thoughts. I think
it was all of them, there was no, this is wait, there was no orig-
inal timeline,” “I am not the soft science in the Jurassic
thoughts.” Despite no improvement in this thought block
after prescribing aripiprazole, we did notice a reduction in
agitation episode frequency and severity; hence, we decided
to persist with the medication.

First signs of improvement only came about 21 days after
admission where nurses observed a moment of lucidity
where the patient was able to speak full sentences and engage
in a brief conversation but returned to his confused state
shortly after. On the 22nd day, the patient suddenly appeared
calm and regained some cognitive orientation to person and
place. He was able to hold conversations, but as the day pro-
gressed, his ability to retain information and overall mental
state declined and was observed to be asking the same ques-
tions repetitively such as when he was going to be seen by
doctors. On the 23rd day, the patient did not display any of
the previous symptoms and his mental state appeared to
almost match that of baseline with the exception of reduced
concentration levels. He was able to engage with staﬀ for
most of the day and was even observed to be using his per-
sonal laptop computer at one point in time. On the 28th
day, the patient was reviewed and it was decided that the
patient was not displaying any acute signs of mental illness
and was able to perform all activities of daily living indepen-
dently. It was thus decided that he was ﬁt for discharge. In
conversation, the clinicians asked him if he had any aware-
ness of the past few weeks and he displayed localised episodic
amnesia by not being able to recall anything in the past few
weeks. COVID-19 antibodies and nasal swab results were
negative.

3. Discussion

Here, we present a case of a young male who suﬀered from a
dissociative episode for an extended period of about 28 days.
The case piqued our interest in its duration and severity of
the associated symptoms. The patient suﬀered from severe
functional impairment and decline of mental state as seen
from the purposeless wandering, thought block, and delu-
sional word salad, yet still retaining the ability to perform cer-
tain activities of daily living like
eating his meals
independently. It is also important to consider several aspects
of this patient’s background and social history and discuss
the thoughts leading to this diagnosis. He was born in
England but moved to Gibraltar early on and spent his for-
mative years there. His parents separated when he was nine
years old, and he has a family history of Asperger’s syn-
drome. Socially, the patient is highly intelligent from birth;
it was reported by his mother that he had a reading age of
four at 18 months and he recently graduated from a top Brit-
ish university. However, he did have an extensive recrea-
tional drug history involving cocaine, amphetamines,
cannabis, and Ritalin. Our diﬀerential diagnoses included
the following: encephalitis, meningitis, drug-induced psy-
chosis, delirium, dissociative amnesia (F44.0), and dissocia-
tive (conversion) disorder, unspeciﬁed (F44.9).

Both meningitis and encephalitis were easily ruled out
with lumbar puncture showing normal protein and glucose
levels. Autoimmune encephalitis was also ruled out with a
negative array of antibodies against GABA/AMPA/NMDA/-
CASPR. Whilst it might be tempting to suggest his presenta-
tion to be simply drug induced, urine drug screen on the ﬁrst
day of admission to A&E was positive for benzodiazepines
but negative for THC, amphetamines, cocaine, antidepres-
sants, and antipsychotics. The presence of benzodiazepines
in his urine was not surprising as he was given a stat dose
of lorazepam at A&E when he ﬁrst presented. We note that
the initial hypophosphataemia could lead to electrolyte
imbalance-induced delirium and indeed delirium was one
of the initial diﬀerentials in A&E, but within two days, his
phosphate levels were replaced orally and remained normal
for the entirety of admission, along with his other bone pro-
ﬁle parameters. As such, delirium secondary to hypopho-
sphataemia would be an unlikely diagnosis considering his
presentation persisted despite electrolyte levels being at nor-
mal levels. With regard to his raised prolactin on presenta-
tion, one could systematically rule out each potential cause,
i.e., physiological, pharmacological, and pathological. A nor-
mal MRI scan showing no gross abnormalities would rule out
any pathological cause. From a pharmacological perspective,
considering this patient was previously antipsychotic naïve,
the hyperprolactinaemia could be explained by his historical
recreational opiate drug use, coupled with evidence of acute
benzodiazepine use as seen from his initial urine drug screen.
It has been reported that both opiate and benzodiazepine use
can lead to hyperprolactinaemia via dopaminergic receptor
inhibition and GABAergic modulation, respectively [8, 9].
From a physiological perspective, stress would be a potential
factor for raising prolactin. Collateral history from his
mother reported that the patient was under a lot of stress
from preparing for examinations, his usual routine being dis-
rupted due to the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19,
and his estranged father recently coming into contact with
him. As such, his hyperprolactinaemia could be due to a mix-
ture of physiological and pharmacological causes. Even so,
there have not been any reports that hyperprolactinaemia
can directly manifest as delirium thus further convincing us
that delirium was not a likely diﬀerential. Towards the end
of his admission, we reviewed his blood biochemistry again
and all parameters returned to baseline with the exception
of his prolactin which was 1359 mu/L. However, as he was
presenting clinically well, we accepted this as a result of the
various antipsychotic medication during this admission.

We interviewed the patient after his dissociative episode,
and he described his experience like a never-ending night-
mare. Memory loss was episodic as he did not remember
majority of the past few weeks and his last memory was
entering the A&E department. He was completely unaware
of what happened on the acute psychiatry unit ward. Whilst
we did not attempt any formal memory assessments, his
long-term memory appeared intact. When we
gross
reminded him some of the phrases he used to say, for exam-
ple, phrases involving how we belonged to a diﬀerent time-
line or how he seemingly described two people ﬁghting, he
was puzzled and did not understand why he would say those

4

things as he was not a fan of science ﬁction. Dissociative
identity disorder was brieﬂy considered due to a certain
phrase regarding two people ﬁghting which the patient ini-
tially mentioned on his ﬁrst day of admission. However, we
excluded this diﬀerential quickly as the patient did not verba-
lise this statement on subsequent observations. Furthermore,
there were no distinct personalities displayed by the patient
nor any diﬀering patterns in the way the patient experienced
his body or the environment. His symptoms mainly revolve
around the blocking of thoughts and impairment of general
functioning which we feel did not fulﬁl the criteria for diag-
nosing dissociative identity disorder. One might also suggest
dissociative amnesia to be a possible diﬀerential as whilst the
patient did experience memory loss of about four weeks, we
felt our patient’s symptoms were not best described by the
ICD10’s criteria of memory loss being the main feature. We
feel his unique blend of symptoms of being severely thought
blocked as though in a trance-like state, purposeless roaming
around the ward, postevent amnesia, feelings of depersonali-
sation, and alterations in sense of self would support our
diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspeciﬁed.

When exploring possible triggers, the patient later admit-
ted to feeling overwhelmed by academic pressures from his
postgraduate course applications and a disruption of normal
routine by having to be conﬁned indoors during the nation-
wide lockdown prior to admission. He also added that the
falling out with his partner coupled with an unsolicited con-
tact attempt by his father contributed to his anxiety. He usu-
ally relies heavily on his mother who lives abroad for anxiety
management, but in this episode, it was believed that the
compounding of multiple stressful events proved too much
for him to handle. This element of stress preceding this
patient’s presentation might well be a major trigger to this
dissociative episode.

Eventually, the recovery of this patient was as quick as its
onset. With regard to his management, antipsychotic medi-
cation did not appear to have any positive eﬀect on his men-
tal state. Sedation was beneﬁcial
in managing agitated
episodes, and the patient was even observed to expand his
speech range after. As he no longer displayed signs of mental
illness, he was discharged to the community psychiatric
team. He was discharged with aripiprazole 20 mg OD and
lorazepam 1 mg TDS with the plan of weaning it oﬀ. We
would have liked to arrange for psychotherapy to be deliv-
ered as a form of long-term treatment in the community,
but unfortunately, the patient moved to a diﬀerent city and
would be under the care of a diﬀerent trust.

On reﬂection, whilst the old adage “common things are
common” still rings true in general medical practice, we would
like to remind clinicians to consider alternative diagnoses,
especially when the presentation does not fully meet the diag-
nosing criteria. In this case, drug-induced psychosis would be
a tempting easy diagnosis based on the patient’s history of
drug use, but on further analysis, his behaviour did not fulﬁl
the criteria of psychosis, and even after cessation of drug use,
his symptoms persisted. Thus, we feel that when querying a
diagnosis of dissociative disorder, management should ideally
involve an element of watchful waiting whilst ruling out other
diﬀerentials before trialling antipsychotics. Perhaps, antipsy-

chotics can be trialled if more deﬁnitive symptoms of psycho-
sis are evident. Whilst benzodiazepine was helpful in treating
symptomatic agitation, antipsychotic had little eﬀect on his
presentation. We did discharge the patient on aripiprazole,
but this was mainly for its mood stabilising eﬀect and for
relapse prevention. We understand that watchful waiting
might unfortunately be diﬃcult to implement on most acute
psychiatric units where there are pressures on the clinical team
to “medicate and evacuate” so new patients can be admitted.
Since there are no formal medical guidelines other than symp-
tom management in treating dissociative episodes, we would
like to report our experience and encourage the use of a
drug-free period of watchful waiting.
