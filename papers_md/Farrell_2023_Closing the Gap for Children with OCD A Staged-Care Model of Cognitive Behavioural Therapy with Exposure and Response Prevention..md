Abstract
Childhood obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is among the most prevalent and disabling mental health conditions 
affecting children and adolescents. Although the distress and burden associated with childhood OCD are well documented 
and empirically supported treatments are available, there remains an unacceptable “treatment gap” and “quality gap” in the 
provision of services for youth suffering from OCD. The treatment gap represents the large number of children who never 
receive mental health services for OCD, while the quality gap refers to the children and young people who do access services, 
but do not receive evidence-based, cognitive behavioural therapy with exposure and response prevention (CBT-ERP). We 
propose a novel staged-care model of CBT-ERP that aims to improve the treatment access to high-quality CBT-ERP, as well 
as enhance the treatment outcomes for youth. In staged care, patients receive hierarchically arranged service packages that 
vary according to the intensity, duration, and mix of treatment options, with provision of care from prevention, early interven-
tion, through to first and second-line treatments. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature on treatment outcomes 
and predictors of treatments response, we propose a preliminary staging algorithm to determine the level of clinical care, 
informed by three key determinants: severity of illness, comorbidity, and prior treatment history. The proposed clinical stag-
ing model for paediatric OCD prioritises high-quality care for children at all stages and levels of illness, utilising empirically 
supported CBT-ERP, across multiple modalities, combined with evidence-informed, clinical decision-making heuristics. 
While informed by evidence, the proposed staging model requires empirical validation before it is ready for prime time.

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the most 
prevalent and disabling mental health conditions affecting 
children and young people (CYP). Lifetime prevalence rates 
from around the world are estimated to be between 2 and 3% 

in developed countries (Kessler et al., 2011; Ruscio et al., 
2010) and between two-thirds to three-quarters of all adults 
diagnosed with OCD experience onset by 6 to 12 years of 
age (Geller et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2011). Childhood

onset OCD is associated with greater OCD severity, more 
OC symptoms, higher comorbidity, and greater prevalence 
of OCD in first-degree relatives and has a poorer prognosis 
and treatment response relative to adult onset OCD (Gel-
ler, 2006; Taylor et al., 2011). Despite the well-documented 
distress and burden associated with childhood OCD (Amir 
et al., 2000; Piacentini et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2018) and the 
availability of empirically supported treatments (McGuire 
et al., 2015), there remains an unacceptable “treatment gap” 
and “quality gap” in the provision of services for CYP suf-
fering from OCD. The “treatment gap” represents the dif-
ference between the 1 in 50 children who suffer from OCD 
at any point in time, and the negligible proportion who ever 
receive evidence-based treatment. The gap is further evi-
dent in the staggering delays in time to care, with Australian 
data suggesting more than 9 years of untreated illness for 
OCD (Cooper et al., 2023). Moreover, even when families 
do access services, they rarely receive evidence-based care, 
and if they do, often it is delivered sub-optimally (), thereby 
highlighting the “quality gap” in available services.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy, with a focus on expo-
sure and response prevention (CBT-ERP), is highly effec-
tive for CYP with OCD (McGuire et al., 2015) with almost 
two decades of empirical support since the first published 
randomised controlled trials (Barrett et al., 2004; POTS, 
2004). However, CBT-ERP continues to be underutilised 
in community settings and infrequently implemented with 
only ~ 5% of therapist routinely delivering the gold-standard, 
therapist-delivered, within-session CBT-ERP (). COVID-
19 has also disproportionately and profoundly impacted 
younger  people,  and  especially  young  people  with  pre-
existing mental health conditions such as OCD. Indeed, 
there is mounting evidence of worsening of OCD symptoms 
among youth already affected since the pandemic (Cunning 
& Hodes, 2022; Van Ameringen et al., 2022), as well as 
rising rates of OCD among youth more generally, and espe-
cially those with other pre-existing mental health problems 
(Kroon et al., 2022). This staggering increase in mental ill-
ness generally, and OCD in particular, has coincided with 
severe disruptions to mental health services, a sector already 
under enormous pressure, resulting in an unacceptable gap 
in the provision of high-quality psychological services.

In recent years, stepped care models have been proposed 
as one solution to improve the access to care. Stepped care 
involves the delivery of treatments from the least restrictive 
(in time/costs/specialisation: e.g. self-help; digital mental 
health with minimal therapist assistance) to the most inten-
sive, whereby patients are only “stepped up” when they 
fail at an earlier step (Ollendick et al., 2018). Stepped care 
has been found to be effective for child anxiety disorders 
(Ollendick et al., 2018; Rapee et al., 2017); however, it may 
be less suited to severe conditions such as OCD, where 
unnecessary delays in adequate dosing of ERP may result 

in higher illness-related burden and costs (Diefenbach & 
Tolin, 2013). More recently, staged-care models for youth 
mental health service provision have been proposed (Hickie 
et al., 2019) and are informed by the medical concept that 
less advanced stages of disease require less intensive treat-
ment, compared to advanced stages of disease that require 
more intensive treatment (Hickie et al., 2019). Staged care 
therefore personalises treatment selection for individuals 
based on the clinical severity of the presenting problem, the 
individual's illness trajectory, understanding of underlying 
mechanisms and current comorbidities to inform the clini-
cal stage (Cross et al., 2019), thereby delivering “right care, 
first time” (Hickie et al., 2019). This review paper aims to 
outline the ongoing treatment and quality gaps that exist for 
CYP with OCD and proposes a novel approach to improve 
the high-quality care through access to evidence-informed 
treatments that are staged, based on the clinical character-
istics of CYP with OCD. The staged-care model of CBT-
ERP presented here is informed by more than two decades 
of empirical research evaluating CBT-ERP for CYP with 
OCD, delivered across multiple modalities, and examining 
the clinical predictors of treatment outcomes to inform clini-
cal decision-making that determines level of care for CYP 
with OCD at all stages of illness progression.

Impact of OCD on Children and Young 
People

The onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence can disrupt 
the critical development that takes place throughout these 
important stages of life (Fineberg et al., 2019) and often 
negatively impacts social, family, and academic functioning 
(Cooper, 1996; Piacentini et al., 2003; Storch et al., 2010; 
Valderhaug & Ivarsson, 2005). In many cases, uncontrolla-
ble distress, avoidance of obsessional triggers, and time-con-
suming rituals interfere with the child’s routine and lead to 
difficulties with school attendance and difficulty interacting 
with peers (Farrell & Barrett, 2007). Up to 90% of children 
with OCD endorse significant functional impairment across 
multiple domains of life (Lack et al., 2009; Piacentini et al., 
2003; Valderhaug & Ivarsson, 2005) and, moreover, report 
significantly lower quality of life relative to community con-
trols (Coluccia et al., 2017). Childhood OCD symptoms and 
the associated impairment often persist into adulthood if not 
treated early (Freeman et al., 2014).

The  negative  effects  of  OCD  are  not  limited  to  the 
personal experience of young people, but extend to their 
home life and family functioning as well (Stewart et al., 
2017). OCD is directly associated with increased family 
distress (Albert et al., 2010; Amir et al., 2000) and indi-
rectly linked to reduced family functioning and organisa-
tion (Calvocoressi et al., 1995; Maina et al., 2006). Indeed, 

1 3644 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

the emotional burden of OCD on family members has been 
found to be similar or even greater than the family burden 
associated with mood (Vikas et al., 2011) and psychotic 
disorders (Remmerswaal et al., 2019). The impact of OCD 
on the family is further exacerbated when family members 
become directly involved in the disorder via accommoda-
tion behaviours (Lebowitz, 2016), which the caregiver per-
forms to assist individuals with OCD to avoid or manage 
their anxiety (Lebowitz et al., 2012). A child with OCD 
may ask family members to provide repeated reassurance, 
participate in compulsions, help avoid obsessional trig-
gers, or delay daily activities to complete elaborate rituals 
(Abramowitz et al., 2013). Indeed, over 96% of relatives 
of individuals with OCD report engaging in accommoda-
tion behaviours (Lebowitz et al., 2012), and nearly half of 
mothers and one third of fathers report daily occupational 
impairment as a result of managing child OCD symptoms 
and family accommodation (Stewart et al., 2017).

Despite being well intentioned, family accommodation 
worsens OCD symptoms, negatively impacts treatment 
response, and contributes to higher levels of functional 
impairment in children and adolescents (Peris et al., 2008; 
Storch et al., 2007). Accommodation of OCD also has 
direct repercussions for family members, depleting emo-
tional resources, reducing attention available for other 
family members, and altering the family’s schedule (Leb-
owitz, 2016; Lebowitz et al., 2012). OCD frequently also 
severely disrupt family life due to the expressed emotion 
of the affected individual when family members refuse to 
accommodate (Stewart et al., 2017). Early detection and 
delivery of efficient and effective treatment are critical to 
offset the profound impairment, disability, and economic 
burden of paediatric OCD. Moreover, interventions that 
support families and parents in managing OCD symptoms 
at home, reducing family accommodation, and support-
ing implementation of ERP are necessary for high-quality, 
effective care.

Evidence‑Based Treatment for CYP with OCD

The two most widely supported treatments for paediatric 
OCD are cognitive-behavioural therapy with exposure and 
response prevention (CBT-ERP) and serotonin-reuptake 
inhibitors (SRIs)—either alone or in combination (Geller 
et al., 2012; McGuire et al., 2015). CBT-ERP is the most 
widely supported evidence-based psychosocial treatment for 
CYP with OCD and current clinical guidelines recommend 
CBT-ERP treatment as the first-line intervention, with the 
possible addition of SRI medication for those with moderate 
or severe OCD, or those with limited response to CBT-ERP 
(Geller et al., 2012; McGuire et al., 2015).

Cognitive‑Behavioural Therapy with exposure 
and response prevention (CBT‑ERP)

CBT is a psychological treatment that involves both chal-
lenging thoughts (cognitive) and changing behavioural pat-
terns (behavioural). ERP involves exposing CYP with OCD 
to situations or stimuli that trigger obsessions (exposure) 
and distress, while they are encouraged to resist the urge 
to complete compulsions (response prevention; Wu et al., 
2016). In doing so, individuals learn new associations with 
feared stimuli, and new coping strategies for managing dis-
tress, thus breaking the cycle of OCD (Craske et al., 2008; 
Himle & Franklin, 2009).

Several meta-analyses comprising hundreds of children 
and adolescents have found CBT-ERP to be highly effective 
at reducing symptoms of OCD (Ale et al., 2015; McGuire 
et al., 2015; Öst et al., 2016; Reid et al., 2021; Skapinakis 
et al., 2016; Uhre et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2016); although 
Uhre et al (2020) conclueded that risk of bias across ran-
domised controlled trials (RCTs) to date is high, with blind-
ing of assessors and concealment of allocation not always 
reported or achieved in psychotherapy trials. The most recent 
meta-analysis, however, including CYP (n = 537) and adults 
(n = 1483) with OCD demonstrated that CBT-ERP was asso-
ciated with a large effect size (g = 1.09) for CYP compared 
to a variety of other treatments (psychological, pharmaco-
logical, placebo) or waitlists (Reid et al., 2021). Moreover, 
CBT-ERP for CYP was found to be as, or more, effective 
than CBT-ERP for adults (g = 0.60), with effectiveness of 
CBT-ERP significantly reducing with age (p = 0.006). In 
clinical trials, approximately 70% of CYP achieve treatment 
response (i.e. clinically significant reduction in symptoms) 
and 60% full remission (i.e. no longer meeting criteria for 
OCD (McGuire et al., 2015). These gains are maintained 
after treatment, for at least 6 to 9 months (Franklin et al., 
2015; Melin et al., 2020). Further, empirical research shows 
that ERP is typically tolerable with minimal side effects and 
low attrition (McGuire et al., 2018; Piacentini et al., 2007), 
acceptable to patients (Skapinakis et al., 2016), and CBT/
ERP with or without the addition of an SSRI is the most 
cost-effective treatment option for children and adolescents 
(Skapinakis et al., 2016).

Modes of Delivery

Typically,  CBT-ERP  is  delivered  for  12  to  20  sessions 
(Gryczkowski & Whiteside, 2014) and can be delivered in 
a variety of formats (individual, group, family) while main-
taining effectiveness (Barrett et al., 2004; Öst et al., 2016). 
Group-based  treatment  may  offer  an  economy  of  scale, 
meaning more clients can receive treatment from one or two 
clinicians (Himle et al., 2003), and for OCD, group therapy 
also offers peer support, reducing the secretive nature of 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

OCD and normalising the symptoms (Lavell et al., 2016). 
Group therapy may also increase compliance with ERP and 
motivation for change, via within-group norms and model-
ling processes (Lavell et al., 2016). Family-based treatment 
addresses family systems that children operate within and 
can incorporate parent management training or behaviour 
management techniques (Franklin et al., 2015). In the treat-
ment of OCD with CYP, family involvement is considered 
an essential part of effective CBT-ERP, given that family 
accommodation and associated distress in family members is 
rife and is associated with attenuated outcomes (Thompson-
Hollands et al., 2014).

In the only large-scale effectiveness study of CBT-ERP 
(n = 269, aged 7–17) delivered within community mental 
health clinics (the Nordic Long-Term OCD Treatment Study, 
NordLOTS), Torp et al. (2015) examined the outcomes for 
CYP with OCD following 14 sessions of manualised CBT-
ERP delivered across 20 clinics in Norway, Denmark, and 
Sweden. Outcomes demonstrated that treatment engage-
ment/adherence  was  high  (nine  out  of  10  patients  com-
pleted the full protocol) and on average participants’ OCD 
symptoms reduced by 52.9% following CBT, with a large, 
estimated effect size of 1.58. This study provides support 
for the implementation of CBT-ERP in community routine 
mental health services, using evidence-based manuals, sup-
ported by high-quality clinician training (i.e. up to 10 days 
clinician training) and site-specific supervision to support 
implementation in routine care (i.e. 3-hourly monthly site 
supervision).

Predictors and Moderators of CBT‑ERP Treatment 
Response

Although CBT-ERP is considered the gold-standard first-
line treatment for childhood OCD (Torp et al., 2015) not 
all patients achieve complete remission from CBT-ERP for 
OCD despite reduction in symptoms (Öst et al., 2016). For 
example, in the POTS (2004) RCT, 46% of CYP receiving 
combined CBT and serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SRI) 
medication did not fully remit from OCD, whereas 60% 
of those receiving CBT alone, and 80% of those receiving 
SRI alone did not achieve complete remission; highlighting 
significant room for improvement in treatment outcomes. 
Given this, interest has turned to exploring the predictors 
and moderators of OCD treatment response which can help 
inform which children will respond best to CBT-ERP, and 
who will require more refined, personalised approaches. 
McGuire et al. (2015) in their meta-analysis (n = 20 stud-
ies) found that a greater number of comorbid anxiety dis-
orders, and a greater number of therapeutic contact hours 
was associated with stronger CBT efficacy and symptom 
response, while greater treatment attrition was associated 
with lower treatment efficacy. Keeley et al. (2008) in their 

early review of the literature examining the predictors of 
treatment response concluded that whist there is variable 
outcomes across studies, the most consistent predictors of 
poorer response to CBT included increased OCD symptom 
severity, more severe comorbid depression, greater family 
dysfunction, and reduced therapeutic alliance.

Garcia et al. (2010) examined the moderators of response 
based on the POTS RCT (2004) and identified that family 
history of OCD moderated treatment response for CBT, but 
not other conditions. Youth with a family history of OCD 
who received CBT alone had a more than sixfold decrease 
in effect size (ES = 0.25) relative to those without a family 
history of OCD (ES = 1.63). The authors concluded that a 
family history of OCD may attenuate CBT response specifi-
cally, given that CBT generally requires substantive family 
support and engagement (e.g. with ERP homework), relative 
to medication compliance.

OCD Severity and Comorbidity

OCD severity at pre-treatment has often been found to be 
a significant predictor of treatment outcome (Garcia et al., 
2010; Ginsburg et al., 2008), although not all studies have 
found this association (e.g. Torp et al., 2015). A recent study 
(N = 314, youth aged 13–17 years) demonstrated that lower 
baseline OCD severity was the most robust predictor of 
lower post-treatment OCD severity and that other predictors 
expected to be associated with post-treatment OCD sever-
ity that were entered into the model were not significant, 
including length of treatment and comorbid symptoms of 
anxiety and depression (Højgaard et al., 2020) Piacentini 
et al. (2002) similarly found that higher baseline OCD sever-
ity and OCD-related impairment were the only significant 
predictors of poorer treatment response. Other studies, how-
ever, have found that in addition to baseline OCD severity, 
mental health comorbidities are also associated with OCD 
treatment outcomes.

In a large study, examining 15 possible predictor vari-
ables from the Paediatric Obsessive Compulsive Treatment 
Study (POTS, 2004), Garcia et al. (2010) identified only 
five significant variables associated with poorer treatment 
outcomes and response, including baseline OCD severity, 
impairment, insight, comorbid externalising symptoms, and 
family accommodation (Garcia et al., 2010). Indeed, several 
other studies have identified comorbid disruptive behaviour 
disorders, ADD/ADHD, and depression (but not anxiety), as 
associated with negative treatment outcomes (Farrell et al., 
2012a, 2012b; Storch et al., 2008). Farrell et al., (2012a, 
2012b) for instance examined the impact of specific comor-
bid presentations (i.e. ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, 
depression) on treatment response and remission rates in 
children and youth following group CBT. While they did 
not find a significant predictive relationship immediately 

1 3646 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

post-treatment,  treatment  outcomes  were  attenuated  at 
6-month follow-up for youth with multiple comorbid condi-
tions, and for those with ADD/ADHD, but not other comor-
bid conditions.

Jassi et al. (2021) recently reported evidence from a large 
clinical sample that youth with comorbid OCD and ASD 
(n = 100) had poorer treatment response to CBT-ERP for 
OCD, relative to youth without ASD (OCD sample, n = 223). 
These findings are consistent with those reported by Griffiths 
et al. (2017) who found CYP with comorbid OCD and ASD 
(n = 25) experienced significantly poorer treatment response 
at six-month follow-up relative to CYP with OCD and no 
comorbid ASD (n = 25). There is recent evidence with adults 
that diminished working memory and poor communication 
skills, which may underlie comorbid presentations of ADD/
ADHD and ASD, are associated with poor responsiveness to 
CBT-ERP for OCD. However, Hybel et al. (2017) found that 
higher baseline executive functioning reduced the effective-
ness of CBT on treatment outcomes in CYP, in contrast to 
children with lower baseline executive function scores. The 
finding that comorbid depression (severe), ADHD, and ASD 
appear to be associated with an attenuated response to CBT-
ERP for OCD, but not comorbid anxiety symptoms / disor-
ders, might be because those conditions are more clearly 
distinct from OCD (i.e. there may be diagnostic over-shad-
owing of OCD with co-occurring anxiety for instance), and 
(arguably) more often require management with adjunctive 
pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, the functional 
difficulties experienced with ADHD/ASD may constitute a 
continuous burden in CYP lives, which may also serve to 
maintain OCD symptoms.

Age and Length of Illness

There are almost no studies that have found age, or duration 
of illness as significant predictors of CBT-ERP outcomes in 
CYP with OCD. In a meta-analysis of 16 RCTs across the 
lifespan (n = 756 patients), Olatunji et al. (2013) found no 
moderating effects of age on outcomes within child or adult 
samples; however, they did report more favourable outcomes 
for CYP relative to adult samples. They found no evidence 
for duration of illness or age of onset as predictors of out-
come. However, the NordLOTS study of CBT-ERP in com-
munity mental health clinics (N = 269) for CYP with OCD 
examined 20 potential predictor variables for responsive-
ness to CBT-ERP and found that in the multivariate model, 
only younger age at treatment was a significant predictor of 
more favourable CBT outcomes, and that younger children 
(aged 7–11 years) generally experienced lower OCD severity 
relative to adolescents (aged 12–17 years) at post-treatment. 
Notably, in their model with age, OCD duration and their 
interaction were not significant, with only age (younger 
versus  older)  a  significant  predictor  of  more  favourable 

outcomes to first-line CBT-ERP in community clinics (Torp 
et al., 2015).

Family Functioning

Family factors are also associated with OCD in CYP and 
treatment outcomes. For example, family dysfunction (Bar-
rett et al., 2005), family history of OCD (Garcia et al., 2010), 
and parental psychopathology (Leonard et al., 1993) can pre-
dict poorer treatment outcomes for youth with OCD. Addi-
tionally, parenting styles that are characterised by parental 
rejection at baseline are associated with higher OCD symp-
toms at post-treatment and children of families who report 
high levels of family accommodation to OCD-related behav-
iours have higher OCD symptom severity at 12 months post-
treatment (Lavell et al., 2016). Moreover, family accommo-
dation is linked with greater OCD severity (Lebowitz et al., 
2012) and lower functionality (Caporino et al., 2012). It also 
predicts treatment outcomes in that higher pre-treatment 
rates of family accommodation are associated with poorer 
treatment outcomes (Gorenstein et al., 2015) and that greater 
improvements are made with lower levels of family accom-
modation (Garcia et al., 2010; Peris et al., 2017).

A  recent  meta-analysis  (McGrath  &  Abbott,  2019) 
explored the moderating role of family-related treatment 
variables, including family accommodation, blame, fam-
ily cohesion and conflict, and general family functioning 
for youth with OCD. Data from 37 eligible studies (1727 
youth, mean age range of 5.8 to 14.5 years) demonstrated 
that family-based interventions were effective in reducing 
youth OCD symptoms and family accommodation at post-
test and follow-up, with large treatment effect sizes. Moreo-
ver, targeting a greater number of family factors was associ-
ated with greater reductions in family accommodation from 
pre-treatment to post-treatment. Surprisingly, however, the 
greater the number of family factors targeted in treatment 
did not significantly moderate OCD symptom severity (C/Y-
BOCS) at post-treatment, perhaps due to the small number 
of studies that assessed family accommodation at pre-treat-
ment to post-treatment. This meta-analysis demonstrates the 
importance of addressing a range of family factors in youth 
OCD treatment to optimise the outcomes.

The Treatment Gap and Quality Gap for CYP 
with OCD

Few patients with OCD ever receive gold-standard CBT-
ERP, with adult estimates suggesting 60% of patients do not 
receive any treatment for OCD (Kohn et al., 2004). In Aus-
tralia, results from a national survey of over 6,300 families 
with children aged 4 to 17 years, indicated that only ~ 5% of 
CYP with mental health disorders accessed specialist child 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664 

647

and youth mental health services in the 12 months prior 
to the survey (Lawrence et al., 2016). Furthermore, in a 
recent study of adults with OCD and/or caregivers of those 
with OCD, the mean time of untreated illness with OCD 
was 9 years (Cooper et al., 2023). Even when families do 
access services, rarely do they receive evidence-based care 
(i.e. CBT for OCD and anxiety), and if they do, often it is 
delivered sub-optimally (Deacon & Farrell, 2013; Deacon 
et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2018). Indeed, children with OCD 
are unlikely to receive gold-standard CBT-ERP outside of 
specialist centres, with one study in the US reporting the 
majority of youth (> 70%) with anxiety disorders presenting 
to non-specialist centres are never introduced to exposure 
therapy during treatment (Reid et al., 2018; Whiteside et al., 
2016a). Numerous barriers to accessing CBT-ERP have been 
highlighted, including a lack of trained clinicians, geograph-
ical and financial barriers, limited access to services, and the 
time-intensive nature of traditional weekly therapy (Gois-
man et al., 1993; Marques et al., 2010b; Turner et al., 2009). 
Geographical constraints are of course an ongoing major 
problem for families residing outside of metropolitan areas. 
Youth with OCD residing in regional areas face problems 
with healthcare workforce shortages, lack of local clinician’s 
trained in CBT-ERP protocols, and time and transportation 
costs if travelling long distances to urban areas for treat-
ment (Comer et al., 2014; Crum & Comer, 2016). Even 
in metropolitan areas, there remains a dearth of qualified, 
trained clinicians who can competently deliver CBT-ERP 
for paediatric OCD. Moreover, clinician and patient negative 
perceptions about CBT-ERP present another major barrier to 
implementation and access in routine care (e.g. reluctance to 
engage in exposure therapy; Young et al., 2014).

Geographical, Structural, and Organisational 
Factors

The logistics and structural factors associated with deliver-
ing ERP have been identified as a major barrier to therapeu-
tic implementation. Session length and access to resources 
needed, such as off-site locations or stimulus materials, to 
implement exposure therapy were among the primary rea-
sons that clinicians reported not utilising ERP in practice 
(Reid et al., 2017). A survey of members of the Dutch Asso-
ciation for CBT (n = 490) found that 55.3% of the respond-
ents were not satisfied with the exposure resources at their 
workplace in terms of lack of proper protocols, while 22.2% 
also reported an insufficient availability of materials sup-
porting the implementation of exposure (Sars & van Min-
nen, 2015). Furthermore, evidence-based treatment manu-
als for OCD recommend concentrated exposure sessions 
ranging from 90 to 120 min (Lewin et al., 2005), which is 
considerably longer than standard sessions (i.e. 50 min) 
and therefore may not be covered by government rebates or 

insurance companies (Reid et al., 2017). Indeed, Marques 
et al. (2010a) survey of 175 people with OCD reported that 
one of the main reasons they did not receive exposure treat-
ment was due to the high cost of therapy and lack of insur-
ance coverage accepted by providers.

Clinician Factors

Due to clinicians’ concerns about safety and tolerability 
of exposure therapy, CBT-ERP is often underutilised in 
community clinics. Many clinicians believe, for example, 
that exposure therapy is aversive to clients (Rothbaum & 
Schwartz, 2002), may exacerbate symptoms (Olatunji et al., 
2009), cause harm (Richard & Gloster, 2007), or lead to 
treatment dropout (van Minnen et al., 2010). Even when 
ERP is delivered, it is often implemented in an overly cau-
tious manner that may limit its effectiveness (Farrell et al., 
2016). For example, clinicians may avoid using exposure 
tasks that cause high anxiety in the client or they may ter-
minate the exposure tasks prematurely (Deacon & Farrell, 
2013).

A survey of 182 clinicians examining their likelihood of 
excluding clients from ERP revealed that clinicians with 
increased anxiety and sensitivity and who held negative 
beliefs about exposure therapy were less likely to utilise the 
treatment method (Meyer et al., 2014) Another recent survey 
of 107 clinicians who treat youth with OCD showed that 
varying levels of exposure therapy were utilised depending 
on clinician background: clinical psychologists with a CBT 
orientation were more likely to implement ERP, compared 
to other allied health workers with differing treatment pref-
erences. Moreover, therapists who more often utilised ERP 
with CYP with OCD had more positive attitudes to exposure 
therapy (Keleher et al., 2020).

Specific to utilising exposure therapy with youth with 
OCD, Reid et al. (2017) found that among the top reported 
barriers to treatment were clinician’s (N = 230) concern 
about parents reacting negatively to ERP or believing that 
young people are not developmentally equipped to handle 
the treatment. Characteristics of OCD may also be a barrier 
to treatment. For example, in Keleher et al. (2020) study, 
clinicians reported that they were less likely to use ERP on 
OCD sub-types of hoarding or taboo obsessions, compared 
to contamination or cleaning rituals, symmetry obsessions 
or ordering compulsions, and mental rituals. Further, in a 
survey of 216 German clinicians (Moritz et al., 2019) nearly 
half (49.1%) the clinicians reported that they were unable 
to implement exposure therapy as the client refused the 
treatment. The clinicians were also less likely to implement 
exposure therapy if the client lacked motivation to engage 
in the therapeutic process or if perceived somatic constraints 
prohibited the procedure. In sum, these unfounded negative 
perceptions and concerns about the effects of ERP reduce 

1 3648 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

the likelihood of clinicians implementing this gold-standard 
treatment, thereby creating a treatment and quality gap for 
youth with OCD.

Sub‑clinical OCD

In addition to the 2 to 3% of CYP with clinical levels of 
OCD, there is a larger proportion of CYP with sub-clini-
cal symptoms, or emerging OCD, that to date very little is 
known about. Notably, however, these CYP with sub-clinical 
OC symptoms experience similar levels of distress, impair-
ment, and comorbidity to CYP with a diagnosis of OCD 
(Fullana et al., 2009), yet rarely receive any form of early 
intervention. Thus, CYP with sub-clinical OCD also fall into 
the treatment gap and represent a sub-group of young people 
with unmet needs. The notion that treatment interventions 
should also be extended to sub-clinical OCD symptoms has 
recently been raised in the literature (Fontenelle & Yücel, 
2019) and is supported by evidence that sub-clinical OCD 
during childhood is indeed a robust predictor of full diag-
nosis in adulthood (Fullana et al., 2009), yet these CYP are 
typically overlooked for treatment.

To date there is limited research reporting on definitions 
of sub-clinical OCD or rates at which CYP experience sub-
threshold OC symptoms. One Spanish study (Canals et al., 
2012), including 562 children aged 9 to 13 years of age, 
showed that the prevalence of OC diagnosis was 4.75% (CI 
95% 3.73–5.95), while the prevalence of sub-clinical OCD 
was an additional 5.5% (CI 95% 4.3–6.6%). Furthermore, 
children’s global assessment scores (CGAS) (Shaffer et al., 
1983) indicated significantly poorer global functioning for 
children with sub-clinical OCD (M: 72; SD: 22) relative to 
youth with no OCD symptoms (M: 93; SD: 7), despite being 
significantly higher than children diagnosed with OCD (M: 
61; SD: 12).

Similar findings of reduced functioning in youth with 
sub-clinical OCD have also been reported in a Brazilian 
community sample of 1,554 children aged 6–12 years with 
either a diagnosis of OCD, sub-clinical OCD (i.e. one or 
more obsession or compulsion symptoms), or no symptoms 
(Alvarenga et al., 2015). They found no significant differ-
ences between youth with an OCD diagnosis or sub-clinical 
OCD  symptoms  in  functional  impairment,  school  prob-
lems, delinquent behaviour, and treatment-seeking behav-
iours; and both groups were significantly more impaired 
than the healthy controls. Moreover, psychiatric comorbidi-
ties between youth with an OCD diagnosis, or youth with 
OCD symptoms, did not differ and both these groups had 
significantly higher comorbidities than youth with no OCD 
symptoms. While there is limited research examining symp-
tom trajectories among CYP with sub-clinical OCD, there 
is evidence for convergence into clinical OCD later in life.

The Dunedin multidisciplinary prospective longitudinal 
cohort study assessed OCD symptoms among children at 
11 years of age (n = 792) and followed the cohort up at ages 
26 years, and 32 years (Fullana et al., 2009). They found 
that youth experiencing one or more obsessive or compul-
sive symptoms (8% of the sample) were significantly more 
likely to be diagnosed with OCD as adults (odds ratio 5.90, 
95% CI 2.18–15.9). Further, 11-year-olds with OCD symp-
toms were significantly more likely to experience symptom 
dimensions of contamination/cleaning (odds ratio 3.37, 95% 
CI 1.32–8.61) and shameful thoughts (odds ratio 2.38, 95% 
CI 1.17–4.81) in adulthood. Given that early onset sub-clin-
ical OCD is prevalent in the community, is associated with 
high functional impairment and other psychiatric comor-
bidities, and represents a gateway to full blown diagnosis of 
OCD in adulthood (Fullana et al., 2009) there is compelling 
reasons to screen, detect and treat CYP with sub-clinical 
symptoms of OCD.

Closing the Treatment and Quality Gap: 
Innovations in CBT‑ERP for CYP with OCD

In recent years, CBT has been adapted and trialled in sev-
eral different modalities in efforts to improve access to care 
via more efficient treatment delivery. Innovations include 
internet-delivered CBT (iCBT: 12 + web-based sessions, 
(Aspvall et al., 2020; Lenhard et al., 2017); or web-cam / 
videoconference CBT (Storch et al., 2011); and brief, inten-
sive CBT-ERP delivered in concentrated format over sev-
eral days, instead of weeks (e.g. 2–3 sessions, (Farrell et al., 
2016, 2022); 5 days (Canavera et al., 2022; Whiteside et al., 
2014). Stepped care models have also been proposed more 
broadly in the literature to address the treatment gap in men-
tal health service provision and are based on the tenet that 
patients be offered the least restrictive treatment (i.e. low 
intensity intervention) in the first instance, and then stepped 
up to a higher intensity intervention, as needed if there is an 
inadequate clinical response at earlier steps (e.g. Ollendick 
et al., 2018; Salloum et al., 2022).

Digital Innovations

New technology and increased access to the internet have 
resulted in a burgeoning field of research aimed at improving 
access to CBT via digital technology. The most widely stud-
ied is that of internet-delivered CBT (iCBT), which ranges 
from fully automated and self-directed web-based CBT, or 
some version of therapist-assisted delivery of web-based 
CBT  to  videoconference,  real-time,  therapist-delivered 
CBT over the internet. A recent systematic review of iCBT 
for CYP with OCD found only 6 studies (I = 96; (Babiano-
Espinosa et al., 2019) including three randomised controlled 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664 

649

trials (RCTs), one single-case multiple-baseline design, one 
open-label trial, and one case series. Of these studies, 5 of 
6 reported significant decreases in OCD severity ratings 
from pre- to post-treatment, and the case-study similarly 
reported symptom reduction for all CYP. The reduction in 
OCD symptoms ranged from 26% in web-based therapist-
assisted iCBT (Lenhard et al., 2017) to 56% reduction in 
videoconference, real-time therapist-delivered CBT (Storch 
et al., 2011).

The only RCT of web-based, therapist-assisted CBT for 
OCD in CYP, involved 67 youth aged 12 to 17 years who 
were randomised to either 12-week iCBT including therapist 
and parent support or a waitlist control condition (Lenhard 
et al., 2017). CYP showed significant improvement in symp-
toms relative to the waitlist condition (i.e. 26% reduction 
in symptoms) and were satisfied with the intervention and 
maintained gains to the 3-month follow-up. In a longer-term 
follow-up, there were further improvements in OCD symp-
toms observed from 3 month follow-up to 12 months follow-
up, with remission rates increasing from 18 to 40% of the 
sample (Lenhard et al., 2020). Collectively, the evidence 
to date suggests it is both feasible and effective to deliver 
CBT via the internet to increase access to care for CYP 
with OCD. In particular, iCBT may be particularly effec-
tive as a first-line intervention for CYP with OCD within a 
stepped-care model of service provision (Ollendick et al., 
2018), freeing up more intensive interventions for those with 
greater need (Lenhard et al., 2017).

Although iCBT offers much promise, the interventions 
with greatest reach potential (web-based, minimal therapist 
support) have demonstrated substantially lower effects than 
those observed with interventions involving greater thera-
pist support (Babiano-Espinosa et al., 2019). One potential 
reason for the initial weaker effects observed in web-based 
iCBT may be the lower dose–response, given that patients 
infrequently complete a full CBT program of 12 + weekly 
sessions when delivered online (Hadjistavropoulos et al., 
2017) and thus, the dose of CBT-ERP may be too little for 
some CYP with OCD.

Given that technology and parents are both crucial ena-
blers of earlier access to CBT-ERP for children with OCD, 
our Australian team (Farrell et al., 2022a) piloted a novel 
parent training intervention in ERP (FAST CBT: Families 
Accessing Skills Training in CBT-ERP for OCD) delivered 
directly to parents of CYP with moderate to severe OCD 
(n = 8) aged 8–14 years. CYP were randomly assigned to 
a 2-week or 3-week baseline phase followed by the inter-
vention, which consisted of 4 weekly videoconference ses-
sions (1 h each), plus brief telephone maintenance over three 
weeks. Results indicated significant improvements in OCD 
severity and significant reductions in family accommodation 
to OCD, with 64% of CYP deemed responders at 2-month 
follow-up. This proof-of-concept trial provides preliminary 

support for a brief, internet-delivered, parent-focussed ERP 
intervention (~ 5 h therapist time).

Extending on the work above to further improve reach 
and efficiencies in treatment delivery, our Australian team 
has since developed a multi-technology version of FAST 
CBT, that trains parents as ‘ERP coaches’ via four self-
directed, web-based modules, complimented by four weekly 
videoconference group sessions with a therapist, and a final 
videoconference group booster session one-month later. The 
aim of the intervention is to equip families with effective 
therapeutic strategies for OCD (i.e. ERP) using brief inter-
ventions that can be readily accessed online, thereby increas-
ing earlier access and more immediate relief to children and 
families in need. We have conducted a small pilot of the fea-
sibility and acceptability of the intervention among parents 
of children (aged 7 to 14 years) with a primary diagnosis of 
OCD (n = 4) using a case series design (Scott et al., in prep). 
Parents completed four weekly, self-directed web-platform 
modules coaching them in how to implement ERP with CYP 
with OCD. This was complemented by four therapist-led, 
videoconference group sessions. Following the intervention, 
parents continued to deliver CBT-ERP at home and engaged 
in two brief therapist check-ins via phone (over a three-week 
period), and one therapist-led group booster session 1 month 
later.

Results supported the feasibility of the intervention and 
indicated high rates of acceptability for the parent training 
program as a blended, multi-technology modality. Overall, 
the usability of the web-platform was rated by parents as 
within the “best imaginable” range, with 3 of the 4 parents 
deemed “promoters” of the intervention, and one parent 
(who only completed 50% of the modules) as “passive” user. 
Decreases in OCD severity were observed on parent, child 
and clinician-rated measure. The outcomes highlight the 
opportunity for more efficient models of treatment delivery 
to reduce barriers to access for families experiencing OCD. 
Indeed, this novel, multi-technology approach offers promise 
for early intervention/prevention, as well as augmented care 
for child-focussed treatment.

Brief and Intensive CBT‑ERP

Given the numerous barriers to accessing CBT-ERP, another 
feasible option is to increase accessibility to empirically 
supported treatments by implementing treatment in more 
time-intensive formats. Brief, intensive treatments offer the 
same treatment components to weekly modalities, but are 
condensed into daily sessions, often of longer duration, over 
a much briefer time frame (Ollindick, 2004). Intensive treat-
ments have demonstrated comparable success to traditional 
CBT for a variety of anxiety disorders (Öst & Ollendick, 
2017). Delivery of CBT-ERP in a brief but concentrated 
format offers several benefits. Massed exposure allows for 

1 3650 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

prolonged and continuous exposures over a shorter duration 
of treatment, which increases the speed of recovery from 
traditionally 3 + months of weekly CBT-ERP to a matter of 
days and weeks in the case of intensive delivery CBT-ERP 
(Farrell et al., 2016; Lewin et al., 2005; Storch et al., 2007). 
This consistent focus on managing OCD symptoms during a 
concentrated period of time may also increase motivation for 
the child and family to make treatment their primary focus 
and commitment (Ollindick, 2004).

Massed, prolonged exposures delivered in an intensive 
format also offers an adjunct or second-line approach for 
more severe or treatment resistance patients who have not 
achieved  an  adequate  response  from  weekly  CBT-ERP 
(Storch  et  al., 2007).  Recently,  cumulative  research  has 
demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness 
of  brief,  intensive  and  concentrated  CBT-ERP  for  CYP 
with OCD, delivered in multiple formats, including 14 ses-
sions across 3 weeks (Storch et al., 2007), 10 sessions over 
5 days (Canavera et al., 2022; Whiteside et al., 2014), ~ 22 h 
over 4 days (Riise et al., 2018) or ~ 9 h over 2 to 3 sessions 
(2022b; Farrell et al., 2016).

The most concentrated and brief of the intensive CBT-
ERP modalities to date is that developed by our team, con-
sisting of 2 to 3 (daily or weekly) sessions of three-hour 
long  ERP,  combined  with  brief  telehealth  maintenance 
over a further period of three weeks (15-min telehealth ses-
sions). In an initial controlled, multiple-baseline case series 
(n = 10, (Farrell et al.,  2016), the preliminary efficacy of 
the intensive treatment, involving one psychoeducation ses-
sion, two sessions of 3-h ERP plus telehealth maintenance 
delivered once per week for 3-weeks (via videoconferenc-
ing), was examined across parent–child- and clinician-rated 
measures at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Overall, 
there were significant reductions in OCD severity, diagnostic 
severity and improvements in quality of life, with the major-
ity of the sample (80%) considered reliably improved and 
achieving clinically significant change. At post-treatment, 
80% were considered responders, and 60% were in remis-
sion of symptoms, the latter increasing to 70% at 6-month 
follow-up.

In a more recent large RCT of d-Cycloserine augmented 
intensive ERP (three sessions of 3-h ERP) for CYP with 
OCD relative to placebo controlled intensive ERP (n = 100, 
children 7 to 17 years), there were significant reductions in 
OCD severity and diagnostic severity, and improvements 
in functioning, for youth across both conditions following 
intensive ERP (Farrell et al., 2022b). At 6-month follow-
up, between 69 and 74% of youth were responders (based 
on most recent and conservative responder criteria (Farhat 
et al., 2021), and 49% to 51% were in remission following 
intensive ERP (Farrell et al., 2022b). Thus, there is good 
empirical support for brief, intensive ERP for CYP with 
OCD which could improve access to specialised treatment, 

as well as offer additional dose–response for CYP who might 
require more than weekly CBT or iCBT.

There are only a few studies which have examined predic-
tors of response to intensive CBT-ERP for paediatric OCD. 
One study by Rudy et al. (2014) examined the clinical char-
acteristics as predictors of response to intensive CBT-ERP, 
delivered over three weeks (n = 78) and found that only 
baseline  OCD  severity  and  family  accommodation  pre-
dicted remission status, whereas comorbidity was not found 
to be a significant predictor. The authors note, however, 
that the treatment was overall very effective, so even youth 
with severe OCD achieved a good clinical response with 
an overall response rate of 88.5% in this study. The authors 
noted that youth with more severe OCD, and those with 
greater family accommodation would likely benefit from 
more intensive delivery of CBT-ERP (over days, instead of 
weeks) and a stronger family-based approach where parents 
are better supported in addressing family accommodation. 
Similarly, Højgaard et al., (2020) examined the predictors 
to intensive residential treatment of OCD among adoles-
cents with treatment-resistant OCD (n = 314) and found that 
while lower OCD severity at baseline predicted lower sever-
ity following treatment, there were no significant predictors 
of treatment response. Collectively, these studies suggest 
that intensive CBT-ERP may be more robust against clinical 
characteristics that otherwise attenuate response to weekly 
CBT-ERP (i.e. comorbidity).

Stepped Care

In recent years, stepped care models have been proposed to 
address the treatment gap by harnessing the efficiencies of 
different modalities. Stepped care involves the delivery of 
treatments from the least restrictive (in terms of time/costs/
specialisation, e.g. iCBT) to the most intensive, whereby 
patients are only “stepped up” when they fail to achieve 
a response at an earlier step (Ollendick et al., 2018). The 
basis for stepped care models is that there is more than one 
modality (i.e. intensity of care) of treatment available for a 
specific condition and that the model of care is self-correct-
ing (Bower & Gilbody, 2005) that is clinicians are skilled 
in effectively monitoring symptoms and flexibly adjusting 
treatment to the level of clinical need.

Aspvall et al. (2021) have recently published outcomes of 
internet-delivered CBT-ERP stepped care (16 sessions iCBT 
Step 1) relative to in-person CBT-ERP (16 sessions) for CYP 
with moderate severity OCD (mean CY-BOCS = 23) aged 
8 to 17 years (n = 152), across two specialist mental health 
services in Sweden. Non-responders to each condition were 
offered a further course of in-person CBT-ERP (Step 2). 
Outcomes indicated that at 3-month follow-up, there were 
46% non-responders in stepped care, relative to 30% non-
responders in face-to-face CBT-ERP; however, at 6 months 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664 

651

follow-up, stepped care was found to be non-inferior to in-
person CBT-ERP with 68% of CYP across both conditions 
classified as responders. Further, health economics analyses 
demonstrated a cost savings of 39% for the stepped care 
model relative to in-person CBT-ERP. These initial findings 
hold promise for stepped-care models for moderate severity 
OCD. However, it is not yet clear how well-suited stepped 
care is for more severe and complex OCD, given that unnec-
essary delays in adequate dosing of CBT-ERP may result in 
higher illness-related costs and deterioration in functioning 
for CYP at the more severe end of the spectrum (Diefenbach 
& Tolin, 2013).

NordLOTS (Torp et al., 2015), the largest dissemination 
and implementation trial of CBT-ERP for paediatric OCD, 
involved a stepped care model of first-line, in-person CBT-
ERP delivered across three Scandinavian countries (n = 269 
youth), including 20 community mental health clinics. All 
CYP received an adequate dose of CBT-ERP, consisting of 
14 weekly sessions as first-line care (Step 1), with 89.6% 
completing the full treatment. There were significant overall 
improvements in OCD symptoms from pre- to post-treat-
ment with an overall 52.9% reduction in OCD symptoms. 
This multi-national, multi-site trial of evidence-based CBT-
ERP for OCD has been a landmark trial for implementation 
of CBT-ERP in routine care at scale, providing evidence that 
CBT-ERP, following rigorous clinician training and supervi-
sion, can be implemented in community mental health set-
tings with positive outcomes similar to those achieved in 
clinical trials.

In regard to non-responders, CYP who were assessed 
as having persistent OCD symptoms at 6 months follow-
up (i.e. ≥ CY-BOCS 16) (following Step 1) were then ran-
domised to either (a) continued CBT, or (b) SRI for addi-
tional  16  weeks  (Step  2:  Højgaard  et  al., 2017).  Of  the 
original 269 participants in the NordLOTS study, 27.4% 
(n = 66) were determined to be non-responders to CBT and 
eligible for Step 2 treatments. Results found large within-
group effects sizes for both conditions, suggesting continued 
treatment for CBT non-responders is beneficial. Moreover, 
continued CBT-ERP for non-responders to first-line CBT 
resulted in significant benefits, with 50% meeting clinical 
response with further CBT-ERP, an effect that was not sig-
nificantly different to augmenting first-line CBT with SSRI 
treatment of non-responders.

Notably, an additional analysis of the NordLOTS data, 
examined early response, at mid-treatment (week 7), to first-
line weekly CBT-ERP. After only 7 sessions, 4 out of 10 
CYP with OCD achieved early and persistent response to 
CBT-ERP, with a 50% mean reduction in symptoms, equiva-
lent to below clinical threshold. The authors examined pre-
dictors of early response and found that youth with lower 
baseline OCD severity were more likely to achieve this rapid 
and clinically significant response to CBT-ERP.

Taken together, these compelling findings highlight the 
importance of optimal dosing of CBT-ERP, suggesting a 
sizable proportion (40%) of CYP with OCD can achieve 
a  good  clinical  response  with  only  7–10  h  CBT-ERP; 
whereas others (20–30%) may require a much stronger 
dose of CBT-ERP than is typically recommended. The 
finding that continued CBT-ERP for non-responders is an 
effective alternative to SRI augmentation has enormous 
clinical significance and is a finding that is contrary to cur-
rent practice guidelines (Geller et al., 2012), which recom-
mend routine SSRIs for non-responders to CBT; a recom-
mendation that has not yet been empirically supported. In 
sum, achieving optimal patient outcomes from CBT-ERP 
for OCD may be a matter of dose. Innovative models of 
care that personalise CBT-ERP dose relative to clinical 
need (i.e. severity) may offer considerable efficiencies (i.e. 
time and cost) and reduce the treatment-quality gap.

A New Direction: Staged‑Care Models 
of Service Provision for OCD

A synthesis of the evidence for CBT-ERP across different 
modalities as well as clinical indicators of response (e.g. 
severity) has highlighted several important findings:

•  CBT-ERP  is  widely  effective  for  CYP  with  OCD, 
across all modalities, including in-person individual 
or group delivery, internet-delivered, and intensive and 
brief interventions.

•  There  are  several,  multi-level  barriers  to  accessing 
high-quality care, including lack of specialised clinical 
training and supervision in CBT-ERP implementation.
•  High-quality CBT-ERP can be implemented effectively, 
at scale, in routine mental health services with suffi-
cient training and supported implementation.

•  Efficiencies  and  effectiveness  may  be  leveraged  via 
more personalised dosing of CBT-ERP; ensuring inten-
sity of care flexibly meets clinical needs.

•  Several  known  predictors  appear  to  be  associated 
with poorer response to first-line CBT-ERP, with the 
most consistent variables being greater OCD severity, 
and specific comorbidity (e.g. depression, disruptive 
behavioural  disorders,  neurodevelopmental  disor-
ders—ADHD and ASD). These predictors could serve 
to inform whom may need less, or more, of empirically 
supported CBT-ERP.

•  Intensively delivered CBT-ERP appears to be more 
robust  against  clinical  characteristics  that  predictor 
poorer response to first-line CBT-ERP, such as comor-
bidity.

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

Staged care represents a major step forward in mental 
health care that aims to deliver highly personalised care, 
delivering “right care first time” (Sawrikar et al., 2021). As 
noted earlier, in staged care, patients receive hierarchically 
arranged service packages that vary according to the inten-
sity, duration, and mix of treatment options, with provision 
of care from prevention, early intervention, through to first 
and second-line treatments. A range of clinical indicators is 
considered, where evidence exists, to inform clinical deci-
sion-making and stage of care, including symptom sever-
ity, duration, functioning, and previous treatment response 
determining the level of care using a single prognostic index 
(McGorry et al., 2006). Staged care represents an innova-
tive population health-oriented service delivery model that 
incorporates clinical need in allocation-of-care decisions to 
personalise the treatment for individual patients.

Prior research demonstrates that patients in milder stages 
of illness respond better than those with severe illness to 
less  intensive  treatment  approaches  (Cross  et  al., 2016, 
2017), which is also supported by evidence from CBT-ERP 
for OCD (Torp & Skarphedinsson, 2017). However, more 
intensive care is required for patients in later stages of illness 
(Salagre et al., 2018), which includes integrated approaches, 
alleviating  current  symptoms  and  risk,  while  targeting 
longer-term functional improvement to prevent further ill-
ness progression (Colizzi et al., 2020; Sawrikar et al., 2021).
Sawrikar et al. (2022) have recently described a clinical 
staging framework for youth at risk of developing internalis-
ing and externalising disorders. According to their model, 
the early stages are related to non-specific symptoms with 
presentation  of  risk  factors  (0),  mild  clinical  symptoms 
with low risk of progression (Stage 1a) that then give way 
to sub-clinical syndromes that are more likely to precede 
to full-threshold syndromes (Stage 1b). Subsequent stages 
capture progressed illness full-threshold syndromes, char-
acterised by clinically significant severity and impairment 
(stage 2) and then to progression to recurrent, persistent, and 
treatment-resistant forms of illness (stage 3 +). Staged-care 
frameworks such as this can be tailored for other mental 
health disorders, such as OCD, to improve treatment out-
comes for CYP with sub-clinical symptoms through to full-
threshold illness.

Fontenelle and Yücel (2019) recently proposed a four-
stage care model for adult OCD treatment, whereby at Step 
0, individuals with no symptoms (Y-BOCS = 0) and mild 
risk factors (e.g. family history of OCD) receive “watch 
and  wait”  treatment.  Step  1  includes  individuals  with 
sub-threshold symptoms (Y-BOCS = 1–13) and multiple 
risk factors who would receive psychoeducation, group 
CBT,  meditation,  or  exercise  therapy.  Those  in  Step  2 
with moderate symptoms (Y-BOCS = 14–34) are recom-
mended SRIs, ERP, and/or transcranial magnetic stimu-
lation (TMS). For patients with the most severe/extreme 

OCD  (Y-BOCS = 35–40),  the  authors  recommended 
SSRIs, ERP, and/or TMS treatments, and, when treatment 
resistant, also considered deep brain stimulation (DBS) or 
psychiatric surgery. Based on our review of the literature, 
this is currently the only model of staged care proposed for 
CYP with OCD, and currently, there is no model of staged 
care for CBT-ERP specifically, in the context of children 
and young people with OCD. This staged care model for 
OCD, although not empirically validated nor vetted by the 
expert community, recognises that treatment outcomes for 
patients with OCD may be improved through more precise, 
personalised matching of treatments to the level of clini-
cal need. This clinical framework may improve access to 
care and reduce demand for higher intensity interventions 
via early identification and more rapid delivery of care for 
those CYP with sub-threshold symptoms, whom also expe-
rience impaired functioning and distress. Given that OCD 
most frequently onsets at around 10 years of age (range 
6–12 years) (Geller et al., 2021), and that early onset OCD 
is associated with greater severity, higher comorbidity, and 
a poorer prognosis and treatment response relative to adult 
onset OCD (Geller et al., 2021; Taylor, 2011), develop-
ment of a staged-care model for CYP with OCD utilising 
evidence-based treatments, tailored specifically to the level 
of clinical need is warranted and may provide a bridge 
for the current treatment and quality gap in mental health 
services for young people.

Closing the Gap: Novel Staged CBT‑ERP 
for CYP with OCD

Based  on  cumulative  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of 
CBT-ERP for CYP with OCD, across in-person weekly 
individual and group delivery (Barrett et al., 2004; Farrell 
et al., 2010, 2012a; Lavell et al., 2016), brief and intensive 
formats (e.g. 2022b; Canavera et al., 2022; Farrell et al., 
2016), and multi-technology modalities (e.g. Farrell et al., 
2023; Scott et al., in preparation), we proposes a prelimi-
nary model of staged CBT-ERP for CYP with OCD that 
tailors level of care (i.e. CBT-ERP intensity) based on 
level of clinical need, informed by evidence on known 
determinants of CBT-ERP treatment response.

Moreover, our model personalises CBT-ERP by con-
sidering essential elements of the care team (i.e. clini-
cians, parents, peers, multidisciplinary consultants) and 
care context (i.e. digital, home, clinic) at each stage of 
the model to ensure efficiencies wherever possible, while 
maintaining adequate intensity and thus safeguarding effi-
cacy. Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual framework that 
guides our model of staged-care CBT-ERP for OCD.

for CYP with OCD

Evidence‑Informed Staging

Reliable screening is the first step in determining staged-care 
CBT-ERP for CYP with OCD. Although there are several 
reliable screening and assessment measures available for 
OCD in CYP (e.g. Children’s Florida Obsessive–Compul-
sive Inventory, (Storch et al., 2009), we recommend brief 
screening tools in the first instance to determine clinical 
need. For instance, there are two brief screeners available 
for OCD in CYP, including the Short OCD Screener (Uher 
et  al.,  2007)  and  the  Obsessive–Compulsive  Inventory- 
Child Version-5 (OCI-CV-5; Abramowitz et al., 2022). In 
relatively small clinical samples, the 7-item SOCS has been 
found to have good reliability and acceptable sensitivity and 
specificity for detecting OCD (Uher et al., 2007).

More recently, in a large clinical sample of CYP with 
OCD (n = 489), as well as non-clinical controls (n = 259) 
and  youth  with  other  mental  health  disorders  (n = 299), 
Abramowitz et al. (2022) found the 5-item OCI-CV-5, that 
assesses  different  dimensions  of  OCD  (washing,  check-
ing, ordering, obsessing, neutralising/counting), resulted 
in good to excellent psychometric properties, and a cut-
off of (≥ 2) yielded optimal sensitivity and specificity. To 
detect early signs of OCD, including sub-threshold OCD, 

we would recommend a score of ≥ 1 to inform a full staged 
-care model; although, further research is needed to validate 
this screening tool for such purposes. Nevertheless, clinical 
guidelines for paediatric OCD recommend routine screening 
within mental health services (Geller et al., 2012).

Following  detection  of  possible  OCD,  full  clinical 
assessment is warranted to inform diagnosis and clinical 
severity of OCD, using a structured diagnostic interview 
(to determine comorbidity and differential diagnosis; e.g. 
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children, Par-
ent and Child versions (Silverman & Albano, 2022) along 
with the gold-standard CY-BOCS (Scahill et al., 1997). 
The CY-BOCS is comprised of two symptoms checklists 
(obsessions and compulsions) and five subscales (time, 
distress, interference, resistance, control) that indicate 
obsessions severity, compulsion severity, and total sever-
ity. It is administered in a semi-structured interview for-
mat, delivered to parents and children conjointly, either 
in-person,  or  via  videoconference.  The  CY-BOCS  has 
demonstrated  good  to  excellent  internal  consistency 
(Cronbach's α > 0.94) (Abramowitz et al., 2022), interrater 
reliability, and test–retest reliability (Scahill et al., 1997). 
Recently, Cervin and colleagues developed empirically 
supported severity benchmarks for the CY-BOCS based 

1 3654 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

on cumulative data from 5140 patients with OCD across 5 
nations (Cervin et al., 2022). Based on this work, severity 
cut-offs to inform clinical staging are; sub-clinical OCD: 
1–13 points; mild OCD: 14–21 points; moderate OCD: 
22–29 points; severe OCD: 30–40 points. Overtime and 
following larger scale implementation, we expect the use 
of artificial intelligence and machine learning, using base-
line “risk” data, combined with patient “outcome” data 
to result in algorithms that can inform refinement to the 
proposed clinical staging model over time.

We propose that clinical staging for paediatric OCD be 
informed by the past two decades of research from clini-
cal trials and meta-analyses, which have informed a range 
of predictor variables associated with treatment response 
to evidence-based CBT-ERP for OCD. While there is no 
formal consensus on definitive markers for early, partial, 
or delayed response to CBT-ERP for OCD, there has been 
consistent evidence that baseline severity, as indexed by the 
CY-BOCS (higher severity), is associated with attenuated 
response, for both early and acute post-treatment response 
to CBT-ERP (Garcia et al., 2010; Højgaard et al., 2020; Pia-
centini et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2018). While there is more 
variability across studies in which comorbidity has been 
found to predict poorer response, there is general consen-
sus that comorbidity is a complicating factor in CBT-ERP 
response, particular for CYP with severe depression, ADHD, 
and/or ASD.

There are of course other complex comorbidities which 
may (and frequently do) result in poorer, or slower response, 
including comorbid eating disorders, psychosis, bipolar dis-
order, and Tourette’s Syndrome, which to date there is no 
empirical evidence since these CYP are often excluded from 
RCTs. However, we propose that all of these conditions be 
considered “complex comorbidity”, likely to be associated 
with poorer response to CBT-ERP, and thus inform higher 
entry into staged care. Thus, we propose a preliminary stag-
ing algorithm to determine level of clinical need, based on 
the current state of the empirically literature for CBT-ERP, 
utilising three key determinants:

(a)  Symptom level and severity, as indexed by a positive 
OC screen (i.e. ≥ 1 on the OCI-CV-5), and OCD symp-
tom severity based on empirically supported CY-BOCS 
cut-offs  (sub-clinical  1–13;  mild  14–21;  moderate 
22–29; severe 30–40).

(b)  Comorbidity, as indexed by the presence of co-occur-
ring complex mental health disorders, including (but 
not limited to) severe depression, disruptive behav-
ioural disorders, AD/HD, and ASD, based on a struc-
tured diagnostic clinical interview (e.g. Anxiety Disor-
ders Interview Schedule for DSM 5, Child and Parent 
versions, (Silverman & Albano, 2022); The Schedule 
for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-

Age Children: Present and Lifetime version, (Kaufman 
& Schweder, 2004; Piacentini et al., 2002).

(c)  Treatment history, based on current best-practice guide-
lines and good clinical care, we propose that a failed 
(and adequate) past trial of CBT-ERP for OCD also 
represents a level of increased clinical need.

Figure 2 illustrates our proposed model of staged-care 
CBT-ERP for CYP with OCD, which should guide clinicians 
in determining level of care using our recommended stag-
ing algorithm, based on known determinants of response, 
including OCD symptom severity, comorbidity and prior 
OCD treatment history. Notably, this staging model repre-
sents a model of care for CBT-ERP, with or without medi-
cation management. While we specifically indicate formal 
psychiatric review and possible medication management 
plan for complex and resistant OCD (stage 3), we do not pre-
clude children and young people from being on medication 
at earlier stages. Instead, we recommend clinicians adhere to 
current evidence-based guidelines for management of OCD 
and recommend medication management at any of the ear-
lier stages, where necessary to improve treatment outcomes 
for young people (e.g. for low insight/motivation to engage 
in CBT-ERP, or lack of treatment providers of CBT-ERP, 
(Geller et al., 2021). For CYP that are acutely unwell and/
or actively suicidal, we recommend routine comprehensive 
clinical assessment, including risk assessments, and inpa-
tient admissions when required. The proposed model of care 
relates to clinical services delivered in the community by 
appropriately trained clinicians in CBT-ERP for OCD (Pia-
centini et al., 2021; Sookman et al., 2021).

Staged CBT‑ERP for OCD in CYP

The model assumes that lower intensity care should be 
offered to all children and youth with sub-clinical to mild 
OCD, utilising models of treatment that affords greater 
scale,  including  digital  interventions  (i.e.  versions  of 
iCBT with minimal therapist support (e.g. Lenhard et al., 
2017, 2020) that can efficiently reach more children. For 
CYP with moderate OCD and higher clinical need, we 
propose multi-level CBT-ERP, engaging a more compre-
hensive care team via inclusion of clinicians, parents, and 
peers (group CBT-ERP, which affords economy of scale 
in service provision), with implementation of ERP sup-
ported across different contexts, in the clinic and at home 
(i.e. via use of technology to support parents and children 
within the home, e.g. multi-modality parent training in 
CBT-ERP (Farrell et al., 2022a). For CYP with severe 
OCD, a multi-level approach that provides an even higher 
level of care via the addition of intensive delivery ERP 
to standard first-line CBT-ERP (or as a standalone inter-
vention if sufficiently dosed), along with parent-focussed 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

CYP with OCD

training/support is recommended (i.e. digital provision 
of parent training in CBT-ERP for OCD; Farrell et al., 
2022a). Finally, for complex OCD, defined by the presence 
of specific “complex” comorbidity or treatment resistance, 
we propose fully coordinated and multidisciplinary care 
teams,  that  include  psychiatry  review  and  medication 
management, along with parent and family support, and 
multi-level implementation of CBT-ERP, including stand-
ard CBT-ERP, intensive delivery of ERP (dose as needed), 
and family support, across contexts where possible (clinic 
and ERP within the home via use of technology). An inno-
vation in this model is that treatments are not linear—chil-
dren do not have to progress from one modality to another, 
if the treatment is unsuccessful. Instead, patient outcomes 
are optimised by providing mixed-modality, concurrent 
delivery of CBT-ERP, using complementary interventions 
across care teams and care contexts.

Our model proposes incremental increases in dose of 
CBT-ERP relative to clinical need; a model which balances 
the need for treatment efficiencies in closing the access gap, 
along with the need for high-quality specialised CBT-ERP 
to close the quality gap. Essential to this model of care is 
high-quality, clinician training in specialised CBT-ERP for 
CYP with OCD, along with ongoing clinician supervision 
in implementation. As level of care increases in this model, 
so does the level of expertise required of the treating clini-
cians to flexibly deliver, personalised intensive ERP across 

contexts (in-person where possible and in-home utilising 
videoconference technology).

We propose three broad levels of care commensurate with 
clinical need, with more nuanced delivery of CBT within 
each of these three levels of intensity.

(1) Low -intensity digital CBT-ERP for sub-threshold 
OCD  [Stage  1a:  digital  psychoeducation]  to  mild  OCD 
[Stage 1b: therapist-assisted, digital CBT-ERP] before ill-
ness results in major impairment.

There  are  several  therapist-assisted  iCBT  programs 
for OCD, including BIP for adolescents with OCD (aged 
12–17 years) that includes 12 online modules (chapters) 
along with five online parent modules that supports (Len-
hard et al., 2016) young people to overcome OCD (Aspvall 
et al., 2018). BIP has been tested in a pilot study (n = 21), as 
well as a randomised controlled trial (n = 67; Lenhard et al., 
2017) and found to be effective at reducing OCD symptoms, 
and requires only minimal weekly therapist support (e.g. 
17.5 min per week). The intervention includes modules on 
psychoeducation, exposure and response prevention, and 
cognitive interventions (Lenhard et al., 2016). Another iCBT 
program, includes “OCD? Not Me!” (Rees et al., 2016), a 
full automated iCBT program that delivers 8 stages of treat-
ment aimed at teaching children (aged 12–18 years) how to 
overcome OCD. Modules include psychoeducation, expo-
sure and response prevention, cognitive therapy, and dealing 
with stress and setbacks. Self-guided interventions might be 

1 3656 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

particularly well suited for sub-threshold OCD, with pre-
liminary evidence to support reduction in OC symptoms for 
youth with sub-threshold and clinical levels of OCD (Rees 
et al., 2016). More recently, we have developed a brief multi-
technology parent training intervention of CBT-ERP for 
OCD (Farrell et al., 2022a; Scott et al., in prep). This inter-
vention, based on OCD BUSTERS (Farrell & Waters, 2008) 
incorporates 4 web-based, self-directed weekly modules for 
parents, combined with 4 weekly videoconference group 
sessions to train parents in the “how” to implement and sup-
port ERP practice within the home. This modality of care 
focusses on equipping parents with long-lasting skills to sup-
port their child in overcoming OCD, where parents are and 
when they need it FAST (Families Accessing online Skills 
Training in ERP). FAST CBT includes modules on psych-
oeducation, training in implementing ERP with children, 
contingency management for ERP practice and reduction of 
family accommodation. This modality draws on “transfer of 
control theory” (Silverman & Kurtines, 1996), shifting the 
control / implementation of therapy from the therapist to 
the parent, increasing parental engagement and mastery in 
managing OCD and facilitating ERP practice, and reducing 
family accommodation, both established obstacles in child-
focussed interventions.

(2) Moderate-intensity mixed-modality CBT-ERP for full 
syndrome, moderate severity OCD [Stage 2: individual or 
group CBT-ERP in clinic, plus therapist-assisted, digital par-
ent training in ERP].

All children with clinical and moderate level severity 
of  OCD  should  receive  empirically  supported,  special-
ised, first-line clinic-based CBT-ERP (i.e. individual and/
or group, weekly in-person CBT-ERP, typically 14 + ses-
sions). We propose wherever possible group CBT-ERP (e.g. 
2012a; Farrell et al., 2010; Lavell et al., 2016) be considered, 
since this modality has been demonstrated to be as effectives 
as individual CBT-ERP in RCTs (Barrett et al., 2004), yet 
offers efficiencies in allocation of care within busy mental 
health clinics. Moreover, group CBT-ERP harnesses the 
power of peers, providing opportunity for peer modelling 
of coping, ERP practice and success, positive peer reinforce-
ment for practice and incremental success, thus providing 
enriched opportunities for learning, mastery and motiva-
tion. Given that family accommodation occurs at high rates 
among children with OCD, and that family accommodation 
is associated with more severe OCD and a poorer response 
to treatment (e.g. Gorenstein et al., 2015; Lebowitz et al., 
2012),  we  recommend  family-focused  CBT-ERP  inter-
vention for CYP with moderate severity OCD and above. 
Family-focused CBT-ERP (e.g. Barrett et al., 2004; Free-
man et al., 2014; Storch et al., 2007) involves the inclusion 
of parents in treatment, either for some component of every 
child session, or via additional parent-focused modules. 
In family-based CBT-ERP, parents are included as part of 

the child’s “expert team” and assist the child with at-home 
implementation of ERP, rewarding the child’s progress and 
reducing family accommodation. At this point in our stag-
ing model, we recommend our parent training in CBT-ERP, 
as an example, for the digital augmentation of clinic-based 
CBT-ERP, given the concentrated focus in this modality on 
parental support and reduction of family accommodation. 
Thus, at this stage in our model of care, we highlight the 
importance of care teams, including children, parents, clini-
cians, and peers to optimise child treatment outcomes.

(3) High-intensity multiple modality CBT-ERP for severe 
OCD [Stage 3a: group CBT-ERP, PLUS therapist-assisted, 
digital parent training, PLUS 1–3 individual, intensive ERP 
session/s); and unremitting or complex OCD [stage 3b: psy-
chiatry review PLUS stage 3a and additional intensive ERP 
until treatment response achieved].

Individual, intensive ERP sessions can be delivered as 
a single session, or more, as needed, at any point during 
treatment. This modality provides a time efficient, concen-
trated dose of ERP, providing massed extinction learning 
over a prolonged session, speeding up gains of CBT-ERP 
in  a  “power  dose”  of  within-session,  therapist-assisted 
ERP. In high-intensity staged CBT-ERP, we propose the 
implementation of complimentary modalities of CBT-ERP 
providing unique care contexts, each of which we propose 
offers added benefits. Having a child participate in a weekly 
clinic-based group CBT-ERP program (~ 14 weeks), while 
parents engage in an online parent training program at home 
(4 weeks + brief maintenance support), combined with an 
intensive 3-h ERP session (or more) within the clinic or 
at home, provides a multi-level, optimised treatment that 
harnesses the support of parents, peers, and technology as 
unique, yet complimentary care contexts to robustly treat 
OCD  in  CYP  with  severe,  complex,  and/or  refractory 
presentations.

Evaluation and Implementation in Practice: 
Future Directions

Despite the well-documented distress and burden associated 
with childhood OCD and the availability of empirically sup-
ported treatments, there remains an unacceptable “treatment 
gap” and “quality gap” in the provision of services for CYP 
suffering from OCD. In response to a global crisis in men-
tal health, marked by increasing demands for care within a 
sector of widening service gaps, recent innovations in men-
tal health have argued for a staged-care approach to mental 
health service provision (Hickie et al., 2013; Ollendick et al., 
2018; Sawrikar et al., 2021). A particular strength of this 
model is that it takes a risk-stratified approach to mental 
health service delivery, determining the level of care based 
on level of clinical risk/need, thus broadening the scope 

1 3Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664 

657

for intervening much earlier, incorporating prevention and 
early intervention potential into models of care (McGorry 
& Mei, 2018; Sawrikar et al., 2021). Based on two decades 
of empirical support for CBT-ERP for paediatric OCD since 
the first RCTs (Barrett et al., 2004; POTS, 2004), there is 
now considerable support for the efficacy of CBT via multi-
ple modalities; a multi-nation trial of dissemination in rou-
tine community care (Torp et al., 2015); and international 
knowledge and competency standards under-pinning gold-
standard implementation (Piacentini et al., 2021). Despite all 
of this—there remains an unacceptable treatment and quality 
gap for CYP with OCD.

Our review highlights that dose is an essential factor in 
determining the adequate response to CBT-ERP; with evi-
dence to suggest a lower dose of CBT-ERP is likely to be 
sufficient for a substantive proportion of CYP with OCD (or 
sub-clinical OCD), while a much smaller proportion will 
require higher intensity care than typically delivered. Staged 
care presents a novel model of personalising CBT-ERP for 
CYP with OCD, by delivering the right level of care (i.e. 
dose of CBT-ERP), determined by clinical need (i.e. sever-
ity and complexity), first time. We have proposed a model 
of staged CBT-ERP for CYP with OCD that is evidence-
informed and developmentally tailored to meet the personal 
needs of CYP with OCD and their families.

The future of staged-care CBT-ERP for OCD is depend-
ent on the prediction accuracy of the staging algorithm, 
which is currently informed by a synthesis of empirical 
studies on predictors, several systematic reviews, and meta-
analyses. To date, the evidence for predictors of response is 
mixed, and further studies with larger samples are required 
to improve our understanding of predictors of response to 
inform greater precision in staging algorithms. We propose 
a need for larger studies of implementation of CBT-ERP 
in community settings, including more diverse samples of 
young people with OCD than typically included in our RCTs 
that, combined with sophisticated machine learning statisti-
cal approaches, might unveil more nuanced prediction mod-
els of treatment outcomes. Machine learning is a powerful, 
statistical tool that can help sift through multi‐modal pre-
dictors and model their complex/non‐linear contributions, 
extracting sub-types of patients and their response to vari-
ous treatment modalities (Chekroud et al., 2021). This work 
requires collaboration across teams and settings to work with 
large datasets to uncover more precise prediction models 
and move the field towards more personalised treatments 
for youth with OCD.

Relatedly, the current proposed staging model focuses 
on staging CBT-ERP, rather than the staging of multiple 
modalities  of  care,  including  pharmacological  manage-
ment of OCD. Indeed, a limitation of our proposed model 
is that it does not integrate biological treatment modalities 
at all, including pharmacotherapy, transcranial magnetic 

stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. The reason for this 
omission from our framework is a lack of evidence to inform 
staging of biological treatments for paediatric OCD, as well 
as associated risk and cost. Medications, although indicated 
for management of moderate-severe OCD (i.e. Geller et al., 
2012), are associated with the risk of harm even if delivered 
with best practice. For instance, the first-line pharmacother-
apy for OCD is SSRIs, which are associated with increased 
risk of osteoporosis (Perkes et al., 2016). Clomipramine is a 
second- or third-line medication in this age group; however, 
it is dangerous in overdose and associated with side effects 
(Fountain et al., 2020). Transcranial magnetic stimulation 
is expensive to access and has a far lower evidence base 
in this age group (Gregory et al., 2022); and finally, deep 
brain stimulation has an even lower evidence base and is 
also associated with serious risks (Rapinesi et al., 2019). For 
those reasons, we propose a model that supports implemen-
tation of CBT-ERP as a first-line treatment for all children 
and young people, with or without medication management; 
however, we specifically recommend psychiatry review of 
medication management for youth at the higher intensity 
spectrum of care.

In response to known barriers of implementation of CBT-
ERP, and to enhance dissemination efforts, there is also a 
need for improved training and supervision of clinicians 
working with CYP with OCD in community mental health 
settings. Given that the availability of treatment manuals and 
clinical guidelines are insufficient in bridging the evidence-
practice gap for CBT-ERP for CYP with OCD, international 
work has begun in developing training guidelines and ulti-
mately standardised training protocols for the implemen-
tation of CBT-ERP (Sookman et al., 2021). A 14-nation 
International Obsessive–Compulsive Disorders Accredita-
tion Task Force (ATF) of The Canadian Institute for Obses-
sive Compulsive Disorders (CIOCD) has been established 
to develop knowledge and competency standards for imple-
mentation of specialised OCD treatments (Sookman et al., 
2021). Piacentini et al. (2021) published knowledge and 
competency standards for clinicians in delivery of special-
ised CBT-ERP for paediatric OCD based on a comprehen-
sive literature review and expert synthesis, resulting in over 
70 knowledge standards, and more than 60 specific com-
petencies associated with evidence-based assessment and 
CBT-ERP treatment of CYP with OCD. The move towards 
established knowledge and competency standards (i.e. Pia-
centini et al, 2021), along with future work to develop a suite 
of accessible training protocols and resources, will hopefully 
serve to better equip clinicians with the knowledge and skills 
to utilise empirically supported CBT-ERP in routine clinical 
practice and support implementation of staged CBT-ERP.

Large implementation trials are needed of staged CBT-
ERP for CYP with OCD to further inform and refine staging 
algorithms and determine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, 

1 3658 

Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023) 26:642–664

and long-term implementation potential in community set-
tings. Future research and implementation would benefit 
from systematic co-design of each element within a model of 
staged care with mental health services; the use of published 
and empirically derived cut-offs for screening and assess-
ment of paediatric OCD; assessment of an even broader 
range of clinical risk and prognostic indicators to inform 
refinements to staging algorithms (i.e. broader assessment 
of complex comorbidity, family history of OCD, past treat-
ment history, etc.); and implementation within the context of 
rigorous clinician training and support to the levels of spe-
cialised, international standards in competency. The impor-
tance of flexibility of the model within routine care, with 
the overall objective to inform the delivery of high-quality 
care, within the context of resources available, is critical to 
successful implementation. One of the particularly appealing 
features of CBT-ERP is that it has been found to be effec-
tive across multiple modalities of care, including in-person, 
digital, and intensive formats. Access to high-quality and 
timely CBT-ERP can be facilitated by a model of staging, 
where lower intensity interventions of greatest reach can 
be accessed by all children and families regardless of the 
level of clinical need. Given the rise of telehealth services 
in delivery of routine care, we would recommend clinician-
facilitated telehealth delivery of CBT-ERP for children who 
cannot access local in-person CBT-ERP. Government fund-
ing of OCD-specific treatment services and models of care 
(at least in Australia, Dyason et al., 2022) are needed to 
support the wider implementation of high-quality care for 
children and families struggling with OCD. In sum, though 
significant progress has been made in the treatment of youth 
with OCD, we cannot rest upon our laurels as much remains 
to be accomplished.
