Background

A B S T R A C T

Nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15% to 20% of five year olds, and up
to 2% of young adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of complementary interventions and others such as surgery or diet on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare
them with other interventions.

Search methods

We searched PubMed (1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (1980 to June 2010), the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
System (TCMLARS) (1984 to June 2010), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1975 to June 2010), China National Knowledge
Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to June 2010), VIP database (1989 to June 2010), and the reference lists of relevant articles, all last searched
26 June 2010. No language restriction was used.

Selection criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of complementary and other miscellaneous interventions for nocturnal enuresis in children
were included except those focused solely on daytime wetting. Comparison interventions could include no treatment, placebo or sham
treatment, alarms, simple behavioural treatment, desmopressin, imipramine and miscellaneous other drugs and interventions.

Data collection and analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data.

Main results

In 24 randomised controlled trials, 2334 children were studied, of whom 1283 received a complementary intervention. The quality of the
trials was poor: 5 trials were quasi-randomised, 5 showed differences at baseline and 17 lacked follow up data.

The outcome was better after hypnosis than imipramine in one trial (relative risk (RR) for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.42,
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.78). Psychotherapy appeared to be better in terms of fewer children failing or relapsing than both

alarm (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85) and rewards (RR 0.29, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.90) but this depended on data from only one trial. Medicinal herbs
had better results than desmopressin in one trial (RR for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.85). Acupuncture
had better results than sham control acupuncture (RR for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.94) in a further
trial. Active chiropractic adjustment had better results than sham adjustment (RR for failure to improve 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95). However,
each of these findings came from small single trials, and must be verified in further trials. The findings for diet and faradization were
unreliable, and there were no trials including homeopathy or surgery.

Authors' conclusions

There  was  weak  evidence  to  support  the  use  of  hypnosis,  psychotherapy,  acupuncture,  chiropractic  and  medicinal  herbs  but  it  was
provided in each case by single small trials, some of dubious methodological rigour. Robust randomised trials are required with efficacy,
cost-effectiveness and adverse effects clearly reported.

P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y

Complementary treatments such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic and medicinal herbs for bedwetting in
children

Night-time bedwetting is common in childhood, and can cause stigma, stress and inconvenience. Alarms offer the best chance of cure,
and desmopressin may be used to reduce or stop wet nights during treatment. Simple behavioural methods such as rewards also help,
especially as first line treatment. People often use complementary methods to treat their children, but the review of trials did not provide
good evidence to support this. There was no reliable information comparing complementary methods with established effective methods
such as alarms and desmopressin. Further research is needed.

Description of the intervention

This  is  one  of  seven  reviews  of  interventions  for  bedwetting
(non-organic  nocturnal  enuresis).  The  others  focus  on:  alarms,
desmopressin,  tricyclics  and  related  drugs,  other  drugs,  simple
behavioural training and complex and educational interventions.
All  seven  were  originally  based  on  the  work  of  Lister-Sharp  and
her colleagues at the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the
University of York, UK (Lister-Sharp 1997).

Description of the condition

Nocturnal  enuresis  is  the  involuntary  loss  of  urine  at  night,
in  the  absence  of  organic  disease,  at  an  age  when  a  child
could  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  dry  (by  consensus,  at  a
developmental age of five years) (APA 1980; WHO 1992). Although
bedwetting  in  itself  is  pathologically  benign  and  has  a  high  rate
of  spontaneous  remission,  it  may  bring  social  and  emotional
stigma,  stress  and  inconvenience  to  both  those  with  enuresis
and  their  families  (Fitzwater  1992).  Children  who  wet  the  bed
may experience parental disapproval, sibling teasing and repeated
treatment failure which may lower self esteem (Warzak 1992). The
children  may  also  be  at  increased  risk  of  emotional  and  physical
abuse (Warzak 1992). Consequently, it is important that enuresis is
properly managed on 'humane grounds' (Moffatt 1994).

Although  daytime  wetting  is  a  significant  problem  and  is  often
associated  with  bedwetting,  it  is  usually  considered  separately.
It  has  been  suggested  that  there  are  different  aetiologies
underlying the two conditions (Jarvelin 1989). If daytime symptoms
are  present,  investigations  to  identify  physical  causes  such  as
urinary tract dysfunction, congenital malformation and neurogenic
disorders are usually necessary (Djurhuus 1992). An organic cause is
more often found in children with daytime wetting; more structural
abnormalities  and  functional  disorders  of  the  urinary  tract  were
found  in  daytime  wetters  than  controls  (Jarvelin  1990).  Daytime
wetting will be the subject of a separate Cochrane review.

Prevalences and causes

Nocturnal  enuresis  is  a  complaint  that  affects  many  families.
Estimating  the  prevalence  of  nocturnal  enuresis  is  difficult,
however,  because  there  is  variation  in  methods  of  diagnosis  and
definitions (de Jonge 1973; Krantz 1994). In the United Kingdom,
the generally quoted prevalence rates are that 15% to 20% of five
year  olds,  7%  of  seven  year  olds,  5%  of  ten  year  olds,  2%  to  3%
of 12 to 14 year olds and 1% to 2% of those aged 15 and over wet
the  bed  on  average  twice  a  week  (Blackwell  1989;  Rutter  1973).
The  incidence  of  nocturnal  enuresis  is  particularly  high  amongst
children  in  residential  care  (Morgan  1970).  About  1%  of  adults
remain  enuretic.  Without  treatment,  about  15%  of  bedwetting
children become dry each year (Forsythe 1974).

The causes of nocturnal enuresis are unclear (Lister-Sharp 1997).
Genetic  (Bakwin  1971;  Bakwin  1973;  Eiberg  1995),  physiological
(Djurhuus  1992;  Norgaard  1993)  and  psychological  (Shaffer  1977;
Rutter  1973;  Devlin  1991;  Moffatt  1989)  factors,  as  well  as  delay
in  maturation  of  the  mechanism  for  bladder  control  (Jarvelin
1989;  Koff  1995),  have  been  suggested  as  possible  causes  of
enuresis.  Other  factors  which  may  contribute  to  bedwetting
include: constipation; sleep apnoea and upper airway obstructive
symptoms  (Maizels  1993);  and  diet  and  mild  caffeine  drinks  with
diuretic effects (e.g. cola) (Blackwell 1989).

Pharmacological,  psychological/behavioural  and  a  variety  of
'unconventional' interventions are commonly used for people who
wet the bed.

Pharmacological interventions

• desmopressin (Glazener 2002);
• tricyclic  drugs 
(e.g.  amitriptyline,  dothiepin,  doxepin,
imipramine,
trimipramine, 
desipramine, 
lofepramine, nortriptyline and protriptyline) and related drugs
(e.g.  viloxazine,  desipramine,  mianserin  and  maprotiline)
(Glazener 2003a);

clomipramine, 

• and  a  variety  of  other  drugs  (e.g.  indomethacin,  diclofenac,

diazepam and oxybutynin) (Glazener 2003b).

Behavioural interventions

• simple behavioural interventions such as reward systems (e.g.
star charts), retention control training, fluid deprivation, lifting
and scheduled wakening (Glazener 2004b);
• alarms and overlearning (Glazener 2005a);
• complex  behavioural  interventions  (e.g.  dry  bed  training,  full

spectrum home training) (Glazener 2004a)

These are discussed in separate reviews.

The current review is restricted to complementary interventions, or
other miscellaneous treatments not already included in one of the
other six reviews. Other interventions are included as comparators
if  they  are  compared  with  complementary  interventions.  The
comparators are described in the other relevant Cochrane reviews.

Psychotherapy and counselling

Because  psychotherapists  consider  enuresis  to  be  a  symptom
rather than a condition in itself, the emphasis of treatment is on the
"child's inner emotional disturbance" (Mishne 1993). Consequently,
the intervention is aimed at the putative psychological causative
factors and attempts to modify the environment which produced
the  symptom  (Mishne  1993).  Psychotherapy  may  be  used  in  the
management  of  children  who  have  psychological  problems  in
addition  to  enuresis,  to  address  problems  directly  related  to
psychopathology (Warzak 1994).

Surgery

Surgical  treatments  used  for  nocturnal  enuresis  include  urethral
dilation,  meatotomy  and  bladder  neck  repair  (Shaffer  1977).
Adverse effects of such interventions include urinary incontinence,
recurrent epididymitis and aspermia (Shaffer 1977) and surgery is
not generally regarded as an appropriate treatment for bed wetting.

Complementary interventions

Hypnosis  (Edwards  1985;  Seabrook  2005),  acupuncture  (Bartocci
1981;  Tuzuner  1989;  Minni  1990;  Roje-Starcevic  1990;  Capozza
1991b; Hui 2006), chiropractic (Feng 2008; Gemmell 1989; Johnson
1991;  Reed  1994),  diet,  faradization,  medicinal  herbs  (Feng  1999;
Zhu  2005;  Cheng  2007;  Hu  2008;  Wang  2009)  and  homeopathy
(Stanton 1981) are among the less traditional approaches used to
combat bedwetting.

Hypnosis

Faradization

Hypnosis  is  a  process  involving  a  hypnotist  and  a  subject
who  agrees  to  be  hypnotized.  Being  hypnotized  is  usually
characterized  by  intense  concentration,  extreme  relaxation,  and
high  suggestibility.  It  has  been  used  in  children  with  nocturnal
enuresis  for  many  years  (Collison  1970).  Rapport  and  trust  are
first  built  between  the  therapist  and  child.  Significant  stressors
are  discussed.  The  therapist  may  draw  a  picture  of  the  child's
body featuring the brain and the genitourinary system and discuss
the  connections  between  them  in  an  age-appropriate  manner.
The  children  are  reminded  that  they  are  the  boss  of  their  own
body.  Only  they  can  remind  their  own  "gate"  to  remain  shut,
and  their  own  "alarm"  to  sound  if  the  bladder  gets  too  full.
Formal hypnosis generally involves trance induction, visualization,
relaxation,  therapy,  and  ratification  or  reflection.  Self-hypnosis
enables  children  to  achieve  their  own  cure,  and  reinforces  a
sense of competency and self-esteem (Gottsegen 2003). However,
a major limitation of the existing research is the lack of treatment
specification  such  as  using  a  manual  to  ensure  consistency  of
delivery (Milling 2000).

Acupuncture

Acupuncture  is  a  procedure  in  which  specific  body  areas,  the
meridian  points,  are  pierced  with  fine  needles  for  therapeutic
purposes.  Being  an  integral  part  of  traditional  Chinese  Medicine,
acupuncture  involves  complex  theories  of  regulation  of  five
elements  (fire,  earth,  metal,  water,  and  wood),  Yin  and  Yang,  Qi,
blood  and  body  fluids.  By  stimulating  various  meridian  points,
disharmony  and  dysregulation  of  organ  systems  are  'corrected'
to  relieve  symptoms  and  restore  natural  internal  homeostasis
(Maciocia 1989). Acupuncture is claimed to be effective in treating
mainly all diseases, including enuresis.

Chiropractic

Chiropractic is another widely accepted alternative therapy (Ernst
2001).  It  is  a  system  of  therapy  in  which  disease  is  considered
the result of abnormal function of the nervous system, especially
the  spinal  cord  and  nerves.  Chiropractors  focus  on  dysfunctions
that can result from irregularities of spinal structure or movement.
Hands-on procedures are usually used to determine structural and
functional  problems.  The  method  of  treatment  usually  involves
manipulation  of  the  spinal  column  and  other  body  structures.
Chiropractic  "adjustment"  is  used  to  promote  normal  bodily
function and correct structural deviations. Chiropractors theorize
that  some  neurological  problems  relating  to  bedwetting  may  be
due  to  a  spinal  subluxation  or  misalignment  of  the  lumbosacral
spine which affects the bladder and kidneys.

Diet or restricted foods

Restricted  diet  is  advised  for  patients  with  certain  medical
conditions, such as migraine, that are precipitated by specific food.
Restricted diet has also been suggested to be helpful in childhood
nocturnal enuresis. It has been reported that a low-calcium diet in
hypercalciuric enuretic children may improve clinical symptoms by
increasing aquaporin 2 excretion (Valenti 2002). In some patients,
nocturnal enuresis may be linked to dietary allergies that provoke
bladder instability; food allergen avoidance has been suggested for
management of these patients.

Faradization  is  the  application  of  faradic  current  to  stimulate
muscles  and  nerves.  Its  use  dates  back  to  the  17  th  century
(Oschman  2000).  It  is  claimed  to  be  useful  for  a  wide  range  of
medical conditions including enuresis.

Medicinal herbs

Medicinal herbs form the mainstay of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM),  as  a  kind  of  complementary  and  alternative  medicine.
Traditional  Chinese  Medicine  is  a  3000-year-old  holistic  system
of  medicine  combining  medicinal  herbs,  acupuncture,  food
therapy, massage and therapeutic exercise for both treatment and
prevention of disease (Fulder 1996; Kirby 1997).

Traditional Chinese Medicine has its unique theories for concepts of
etiology, systems of diagnosis and treatment , being different from
that  of  western  medicine.  The  theories  of  TCM  include  Yin-Yang
(representing the opposite principles and balance between positive
and negative systems in the body), the five elements (metal, wood,
water, fire, and earth), Qi (vital energy) and blood, Zhang-Fu (five
viscerae  and  six  bowels),  and  channels  and  collaterals  (Meridian
doctrine) (Liu 1991; Cheng 2000). Bianzheng Lunzhi (differentiation
of symptoms and prescription of drugs) is the application of these
theories. TCM is used for correcting the imbalance of Yin-Yang in the
body and maintaining kinetic balance under the movement of five
elements.

Medicinal herbs are mainly made from natural plants and usually
incorporate  one  to  several  herbs  as  the  basic  drug(s)  to  treat
the  disease.  Depending  upon  the  different  symptoms  or  causes,
curative  herbs  are  selected,  which  are  then  mixed  together
following  a  particular  method  to  form  the  prescription.  The
different  ingredients  in  each  plant  will  work  synergistically  to
balance the body of patients with enuresis.

Homeopathy

Homeopathy  is  a  therapeutic  method  using  substances  whose
effects  when  administered  to  healthy  subjects  correspond  to  the
manifestations  of  the  disorder  in  the  sick  patient.  The  remedies
are  thought  to  retain  biologic  activity  if  they  are  diluted  and
agitated  or  shaken  between  serial  dilutions,  even  if  no  original
molecules  remain.  Based  on  the  principle  of  "similars",  or  "like
cures like", homeopathy postulates that small doses of a substance
that  can  cause  symptoms  in  a  healthy  person  can  be  used
to  cure  similar  symptoms  of  disease  in  someone  who  is  ill.
Homeopathy  is  another  popular  form  of  complementary  and
alternative  therapies  worldwide.  Nearly  40%  of  physicians  in
England refer for homeopathic treatment and more than 60% of the
French public use homeopathy (Ernst 1996; Fisher 1994). The use
of homeopathy in the United States has increased 5-fold since 1990
(Eisenberg  1998;  Davenas  1988).  Homeopathy  is  one  of  the  most
controversial of the complementary therapies because of the high
dilutions of the medicines used, often beyond Avogadro's number
(6.022x1023) (Eisenberg 1993).

O B J E C T I V E S

To  determine  the  effects  of  complementary  and  miscellaneous
treatments on children with nocturnal enuresis.

The following comparisons were made:

1. Hypnosis versus no treatment or placebo or another treatment.

2. Psychotherapy or counselling versus no treatment or placebo or
another treatment.

Comparison  interventions  included  untreated,  sham  treated  or
waiting  list  controls,  reward  systems  (star  charts),  desmopressin,
tricyclics (imipramine) and alarm treatment.

Types of outcome measures

The outcomes considered in this review were.

• NOT CURED:  number of children not achieving 14 consecutive

dry nights during treatment.

• NOT IMPROVED:  number of children not reducing number of wet

nights during treatment.

• Mean number of wet nights per week during treatment.
• FAILURE  OR  RELAPSE:    number  of  children  failing  during

treatment and/or relapsing after initial success.

• Mean  number  of  wet  nights  per  week  when  children  were

followed up after treatment stopped.

• Adverse effects.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomised  or  quasi-randomised  studies  of  complementary  or
miscellaneous  treatments  versus  other  treatment  of  non-organic
nocturnal enuresis.

The  Traditional  Chinese  Medical  Literature  Analysis  and  Retrieval
System  (TCMLARS)(1984  to  June  2010),  Chinese  Biomedical
Literature  Database  (CBM)  (1975  to  June  2010),  China  National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to June 2010), VIP database
(1989 to June 2010), PubMed (1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (1980
to  June  2010),  were  searched  from  their  date  of  inception  to  26
June 2010 by one reviewer (TH) using the following keyword search:
clinical trial AND nocturnal enuresis.

Searching other resources

For  a  previous  systematic  review  of  enuresis  treatments  (Lister-
Sharp  1997),  extra  specific  searches  were  performed.  The
reviewers obtained information from a variety of sources, including
organisations,  manufacturers  and  individuals.  These  sources  are
listed  in  the  NHS  Centre  for  Reviews  and  Dissemination  Report
(Lister-Sharp 1997). The reference list resulting from these sources
was searched.

Data collection and analysis

The studies for this review were assessed using the methods of the
Cochrane Collaboration (Deeks 2003).

Types of participants

Identification of trials

Children (as defined by the trialists, usually up to age 16) suffering
from nocturnal enuresis which could not be attributed to organic
causes.

Types of interventions

Any trial which used complementary or miscellaneous treatments
in at least one arm of the study.

The titles and where possible abstracts of all studies located by the
searches were checked by two reviewers (TH, XS) to identify those
likely to be evaluations of the effects of interventions for nocturnal
enuresis. Full papers were then obtained and assessed in duplicate
to identify those that met the inclusion criteria. Differences were
resolved by discussion.

Quality assessment

A range of both general and more specific quality issues were noted,
including:

• level of concealment of random allocation in the trials
• whether data to assess the comparability of groups at baseline

were given, including baseline levels of wetting

• use of a 'wash-out' period if a crossover design was employed
• intention-to-treat analysis
• whether outcomes were clearly defined
• blinding of treatment or outcome assessment
• the provision of appropriate follow-up data
• the use of appropriate statistical techniques
• whether useful data (e.g. means and standard deviations) were

presented

• whether  children  with  daytime  wetting  were  specifically

excluded

• whether  children  who  had  physical  (organic)  causes  for  their

enuresis were specifically excluded

However,  none  of  these  criteria  were  used  to  include  or  exclude
trials.

Data extraction

The data were extracted independently by two reviewers (TH, XS)
using a standard form. Differences were resolved by discussion.

Data analysis

Where  appropriate,  the  results  were  converted  to  the  mean  and
standard  deviation  of  the  number  of  WET  nights  per  WEEK,  or
the  number  of  children  failing  to  achieve  cure  during  treatment,
defined  as  14  consecutive  dry  nights,  or  the  number  who  were
not cured during treatment plus those who relapsed after stopping
active treatment (to allow for possible differences in initial 'success'
rates).  Where  a  mean  value  was  reported  with  no  standard
deviation, we entered the data into 'Other Data Tables'.

We intended, where possible, to calculate standardised effect sizes
and  95%  confidence  intervals  (CI):  weighted  mean  differences
(WMD)  where  outcomes  were  continuous  variables  and  relative
risks (RR) where they were binary. A fixed-effect model was to be
used  to  calculate  the  pooled  estimates  and  the  95%  CIs  (Berlin

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

1989),  with  mean  differences  weighted  by  the  inverse  of  the
variance, and given as differences in number of wet nights per week.
Negative values indicate fewer wet nights in the intervention group
at the left-hand side of the graphs. Differences between trials were
to  be  further  investigated  when  it  appeared  obvious  from  visual
inspection  of  the  results  or  statistically  significant  heterogeneity
was  found  at  the  10%  probability  level  using  the  Chi2  test  or  by
assessment of the I2 statistic (Higgins 2003). If a reason was found
then a judgement was to be made as to whether it was reasonable
to  combine  the  results.  If  there  was  no  obvious  reason  for  the
heterogeneity, or it persisted despite the removal of outlying trials,
a  random-effects  model  could  have  been  used.  However,  in  the
event this was not necessary.

In general no assumptions were made about missing data and data
were presented as given in the trial reports. However, where there
was  evidence  of  differential  dropout  from  the  groups  which  may
have  been  caused  by  lack  of  response  or  adverse  effects  of  the
interventions, the data were recalculated as if the dropouts were
failures.

Crossover  trials  have  been  indicated  by  a  suffix  #  after  the  trial
ID.  The  data  have  been  presented  as  'Other  Data'.  Alternatively,
data from the first arm only could be used if it was available and
appeared unbiased. Continuous data reported without measures
of dispersion such as standard deviations (SDs) were presented as
'Other Data'.

Included studies

Size of the trials

In  total,  the  24  trials  included  2334  children  (an  average  of  97
children  per  trial),  of  whom  1283  received  a  complementary  or
other miscellaneous intervention. The trial sizes ranged from 9 to
338 participants.

Interventions

The following interventions were included:

• hypnosis  in  three  trials  (Bannerjee  1993;  Edwards  1985;

Seabrook 2005)

• psychotherapy or counselling or cognitive treatment in six trials
(Ciotti 1983; Kahan 1998; Khosroshahi 1989; Ronen 1992; Sacks
1974; Werry 1965)

• acupuncture in four trials (Jiang 2000; Mao 1998; Radmayr 2001;

Hui 2006)

• chiropractic in three trials (Feng 2008; Leboeuf 1991; Reed 1994)
• diet or restricted food in two trials (Egger 1992 #; McKendry 1975)
• faradization in one trial (Cupalova 1988 #)
• medicinal herbs in five trials (Cheng 2007; Feng 1999; Hu 2008;

Wang 2009; Zhu 2005)

Comparators

They were compared with the following treatments:

• waiting list control (Edwards 1985; Leboeuf 1991; Ronen 1992;
Sacks  1974;  Werry  1965),  placebo  (Egger  1992  #)  or  sham
treatment (Cupalova 1988 #; Mao 1998; Reed 1994);

• alarm  (pad  and  bell  bed  alarm)  (Ronen  1992;  Sacks  1974;

Seabrook 2005; Werry 1965);

• simple behavioural intervention (reward system) (Ronen 1992);
• desmopressin  (Feng  2008;  Kahan  1998;  Radmayr  2001;  Wang

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Organic causes and daytime wetting

Four  trials  failed  to  explicitly  exclude  children  who  might  have
had an organic cause for their wetting (Ciotti 1983; Cupalova 1988
#;  Egger  1992  #;  Radmayr  2001):  of  these,  children  with  daytime
wetting  were  excluded  in  two  (Ciotti  1983;  Radmayr  2001),  not
mentioned  in  another  (Cupalova  1988  #)  and  some  children  with
daytime  wetting  were  included  in  the  fourth  (Egger  1992  #).  In
another  trial,  some  children  were  included  who  had  daytime
wetting  but  not  organic  causes  (McKendry  1975),  Six  trials  failed
to explicitly exclude children who might have had daytime wetting
(Cheng 2007; Feng 1999; Feng 2008; Hu 2008; Hui 2006; Zhu 2005):
of these, not mentioned in four (Cheng 2007; Hu 2008; Hui 2006; Zhu
2005 ), unclear in two (Feng 1999; Feng 2008), and in the remainder
of the trials daytime wetting was excluded.

Previous treatment and setting

Three  trials  included  children  who  had  no  previous  treatment
(Kahan 1998; Radmayr 2001; Reed 1994), two included some or all
children who had been treated before (Cupalova 1988 #; Leboeuf
1991),  and  the  remainder  did  not  report  this  feature.  Children
were recruited from the community in three trials (Edwards 1985;
Leboeuf 1991; Reed 1994), were in hospital in one (Cupalova 1988
#) or attending hospital outpatient clinics in twelve (Cheng 2007;
Ciotti 1983; Hu 2008; Hui 2006; Jiang 2000; Khosroshahi 1989; Mao
1998; McKendry 1975; Radmayr 2001; Ronen 1992; Werry 1965; Zhu
2005).

Ages

Two trials included some children under the age of five years (Egger
1992  #;  Leboeuf  1991),  and  one  included  some  young  adults  (9
participants with primary nocturnal enuresis aged 16 to 21 years
in addition to 91 younger children, Jiang 2000). It was not possible
to  analyse  the  data  from  the  younger  and  older  participants
separately.

2009);

Excluded studies

• imipramine  (Bannerjee  1993;  Cheng  2007;  Ciotti  1983;  Feng

1999; Hui 2006; McKendry 1975; Zhu 2005);

• piracetam (Khosroshahi 1989);
• other drugs (a mixture of meclofenoxate, oryzanol and thiamine)

(Hu 2008; Jiang 2000)

• Mozes Detector (alarm that delivers electric shocks on wetting)

(McKendry 1975);

Quality of data and crossovers trials

Three  trials  provided  continuous  data  without  measures  of
dispersion  (Cupalova  1988  #;  Edwards  1985;  Leboeuf  1991)  and
in  the  latter  two  of  these  data  were  estimated  from  graphs.  In
addition, the data from two crossover trials could not be analysed
in Review Manager and so were presented only in Other Data Tables
(Cupalova 1988 #; Egger 1992 #).

Baseline recording of wetting

Six  trials  failed  to  present  data  on  systematic  measurement  of
baseline wetting before the trial began (Bannerjee 1993; Ciotti 1983;
Jiang 2000; Khosroshahi 1989; McKendry 1975; Sacks 1974).

A  further  26  studies  were  excluded:  the  reasons  are  given  in
the  Table  of  Characteristics  of  Excluded  Studies.  Eighteen  were
not  randomised  or  quasi-randomised  studies;  it  was  unclear  in
another four whether the participants had been randomised (Minni
1990;  Pan  2009;  Trisnar  1996;  Zhang  2009);  in  another  one  both
intervention and control groups received combining therapy (Chen
2010);  the  participants  were  adults  in  one  (Ellis  1995);  partially
children below 5 years old in another (Wang 2003). One otherwise
eligible  RCT  was  excluded  due  to  compromised  randomisation
(Yuksek 2003).

Risk of bias in included studies

Concealment of allocation to groups

None  of  the  included  trials  reported  a  method  of  randomisation
that  was  clearly  securely  concealed  before  allocation  (class  A),
and five trials used quasi-randomised methods such as alternate
allocation (class C, Bannerjee 1993; Cupalova 1988 #; Ronen 1992;
Wang 2009; Werry 1965). The details of the process in the remainder
were unclear (class B). In two trials the proportions randomised to
the groups was unequal (Hu 2008; Jiang 2000).

Baseline comparability of groups

Eleven  trials  reported  that  the  children  in  the  groups  were
comparable  at  baseline,  suggesting  adequate  randomisation
(Cheng 2007; Cupalova 1988 #; Feng 1999; Feng 2008; Hu 2008; Hui
2006; Mao 1998; Seabrook 2005; Wang 2009; Werry 1965; Zhu 2005).
However, in five trials there was evidence that the groups were not
comparable (Edwards 1985; Kahan 1998; Leboeuf 1991; Reed 1994;
Sacks  1974).  In  the  two  crossover  trials  (Cupalova  1988  #;  Egger
1992 #), children acted as their own controls. The remainder did not
provide data or did not comment on baseline comparability.

Dropouts

Six trials reported dropouts, usually due to some children lost to
follow  up  (Hu  2008;  Khosroshahi  1989;  Reed  1994;  Ronen  1992;
Seabrook 2005; Werry 1965). In one trial (INSERT REF), the authors
commented  that  one  intervention  (cognitive  treatment)  had  the
fewest children dropping out compared to the other three arms, but
the numbers were small. In another, dropout and poor compliance
was  clearly  related  to  the  unacceptability  and  lack  of  success  of
diet treatment, and the data were analysed as if the dropouts were
failures (McKendry 1975). In the other trials, dropouts did not occur
or the trial was reported without mention of children who might
have dropped out.

Use of a washout period in crossover trials and carry over
effects

In  the  two  crossover  trials,  no  'washout  period'  was  reported
(Cupalova 1988 #; Egger 1992 #). One involved faradization or sham
faradization, and the data presented were inadequate for statistical
analysis  (Cupalova  1988  #).  In  the  other,  test  provocation  foods
were  reintroduced  on  a  weekly  basis,  and  again  the  data  were
inadequate for statistical analysis (Egger 1992 #).

Data from graphs

In  the  two  trials  where  continuous  data  had  to  be  estimated
from  measurement  of  graphs,  the  imprecision  of  the  data  was
compounded by the lack of even graphical display of measures of
dispersion (Edwards 1985; Leboeuf 1991).

Provision of follow-up data

Only eight trials provided any information about the enuretic status
of the children after the end of the period of trial treatment, such
as relapse rates or number of wet nights per week (Edwards 1985;
Feng  1999;  Jiang  2000;  Kahan  1998;  Mao  1998;  Radmayr  2001;
Ronen  1992;  Wang  2009).  Follow  up  was  not  interpretable  after
the crossover trials, as children would have been exposed to both
treatments (Cupalova 1988 #; Egger 1992 #).

Effects of interventions

1. Hypnosis versus no treatment or placebo or another
treatment (Comparison 1)

Three small trials addressed this comparison:

• hypnosis versus imipramine in one (Bannerjee 1993);
• hypnosis versus alarm in another (Seabrook 2005); and
• hypnosis  with  or  without  suggestions  or  versus  an  untreated

control group in the other (Edwards 1985).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Although the number of children cured or improved was similar at
the end of treatment in one trial (Bannerjee 1993), the high relapse
rate after stopping imipramine (19 out of 25 children) resulted in a
lower combined failure or relapse rate than after hypnosis (8 out of
25 children, RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78, Analysis 1.3.1). The trialists
attributed this to continuing self-hypnosis in the hypnosis group,
but noted that it was less effective in younger children.

In another trial (Seabrook 2005 ), hypnotherapy therapy was less
effective  than  an  alarm  both  during  treatment  (RR  for  children
failing  during  treatment  1.80,  95%  CI  1.22  to  2.65,  Analysis  1.1.2)
and after treatment stopped (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.90, Analysis
1.3.2).

In  the  third  trial,  failure  to  provide  SDs  meant  that  the  data
could  not  be  statistically  analysed  (Edwards  1985).  The  number
of  wet  nights,  both  during  and  after  treatment,  was  highest  in
the untreated control group and similar in the other three groups
(Analysis 1.2), leading the trialists to conjecture that, as suggestions
alone  were  as  effective  as  hypnosis  alone  or  hypnosis  combined
with suggestions, the difference was due to the suggestions rather
than  the  hypnosis.  However,  due  to  data  combining  and  small
numbers, this could not be tested statistically.

2. Psychotherapy or counselling versus placebo treatment or
another treatment (Comparison 2)

Six  trials  used  some  form  of  psychotherapy,  counselling  or
cognitive  treatment  for  children  with  enuresis.  The  interventions
or  the  comparators  in  two  trials  were  considered  to  be  so
different  that  the  data  could  not  be  combined  (psychological
counselling plus placebo in Kahan 1998, and play and supportive
psychotherapy  in  Khosroshahi  1989).  Data  from  another  three
could be combined as the interventions seemed to provide similar
support,  psychotherapy  or  cognitive  therapy  (Ronen  1992;  Sacks
1974;  Werry  1965).  Data  from  the  last  trial  were  not  suitable  for
combination  with  any  other  trial  (Ciotti  1983).  The  comparison
treatments also varied: desmopressin (Kahan 1998); alarm (Ronen
1992; Sacks  1974;  Werry 1965); imipramine (Ciotti 1983); rewards
such  as  star  charts  (Ronen  1992);  piracetam  (Khosroshahi  1989);
and untreated control or placebo groups (Khosroshahi 1989; Ronen
1992; Sacks 1974; Werry 1965).

During  treatment,  the  psychological  or  supportive  interventions
seemed  to  result  in  fewer  wet  nights  (Analysis  2.2)  than  with
desmopressin  (Analysis  2.2.1  and  Analysis  2.2.3:  Kahan  1998)  or
untreated controls (Analysis 2.2.4: Ronen 1992). In terms of number
of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights, children were less
likely  to  fail  with  psychological  interventions  than  with  rewards
(Analysis  2.1.10,  Ronen  1992)  or  with  piracetam  (Analysis  2.1.5,
Khosroshahi  1989)  in  single  trials.  Psychological  or  supportive
interventions  had  better  results  than  untreated  controls  (RR  for
children failing during treatment 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.85, Analysis
2.1.8:  Ronen  1992;  Sacks  1974;  Werry  1965)  but  with  significant
heterogeneity.  Although  they  did  not  appear  to  be  as  good  as
alarms  (RR  1.47,  95%  CI  1.11  to  1.94,  Analysis  2.1.9:  Ronen  1992;
Sacks 1974; Werry 1965), there was also significant heterogeneity.
The significance of the effect depended on results from one trial for
each comparator (Ronen 1992 for the untreated control comparison
and  Sacks  1974  versus  alarm).  The  differences  became  non-
significant  when  a  random  effects  model  was  used.  There  was  a
suggestion that imipramine was more effective than psychotherapy
during  treatment  in  the  last  trial  (3  out  of  12  improved  on

4.2.2) but with wide confidence intervals and no information about
bedwetting after treatment stopped.

After treatment stopped, the numbers not achieving 14 dry nights
or relapsing were similar after psychological counselling compared
with  desmopressin  (Analysis  2.3.1,  Analysis  2.3.2,  Analysis  2.3.3:
Kahan 1998), although the numbers of wet nights were fewer after
the counselling (mean difference (MD) -1.7, 95% CI -2.31 to -1.09,
Analysis 2.4.1: Kahan 1998) or if counselling was supplemented by
desmopressin (MD -2.10, 95% CI -2.67 to -1.53, Analysis 2.4.3). In one
small trial (Ronen 1992), psychotherapy appeared to be better than
both alarm (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85, Analysis 2.3.5) and rewards
(RR 0.29, 95% 0.09 to 0.90, Analysis 2.3.6) in terms of fewer children
failing or relapsing.

3. Acupuncture versus no treatment or placebo or another
treatment (Comparison 3)

Four  trials  (Hui  2006  ;  Jiang  2000;  Mao  1998;  Radmayr  2001)
included a group receiving acupuncture. Two small trials compared
acupuncture  with  imipramine  (Hui  2006  )  and  desmopressin
(Radmayr  2001)  separately.  The  numbers  were  too  few  to
demonstrate whether or not the two treatments differed in either
cure or improvement rates (Analysis 3.1.1; Analysis 3.1.2; Analysis
3.2). In another trial (Mao 1998), acupuncture seemed better than
a sham procedure: fewer children remained wet after acupuncture
finished  (26  out  of  56)  than  after  sham  acupuncture  treatment
finished  (38  out  of  55)  (RR  0.67,  95%  CI  0.48  to  0.94,  Analysis
3.3.2)  (Mao  1998).  In  one  trial  (Jiang  2000),  warm  acupuncture
appeared to have a lower failure rate than a combination of drugs
(meclofenoxate,  oryzanol  and  thiamine)  (RR  0.31,  95%  CI  0.21  to
0.45, Analysis 3.3.3) (Jiang 2000).

4. Chiropractic versus no treatment or placebo or another
treatment (Comparison 4)

Three trials (Feng 2008; Leboeuf 1991; Reed 1994) addressed this
comparison.

in  baseline  wetting  before  starting
There  were  differences 
treatment  (active  group  significantly  more  often  wet  in  one
(Leboeuf 1991) and significantly less often wet in the other (Reed
1994)).

In one trial (Leboeuf 1991), the control period (while the children
were  on  the  waiting  list)  lasted  for  only  two  weeks.  During  this
control  period,  there  was  little  change  in  the  numbers  of  wet
nights per week (from 4.8 to 5). In the children in the active group,
however,  the  number  of  wet  nights  decreased  from  6  to  5.5  in
their  first  two  weeks  of  treatment,  but  measures  of  dispersion
(standard  deviations,  SDs)  were  not  given,  ruling  out  statistical
comparison  (Analysis  4.3.1).  Thereafter  the  control  group  were
given chiropractic treatment, precluding further comparisons.

In  another  trial  (Reed  1994),  in  which  the  group  given  active
chiropractic  adjustment  were  less  often  wet  at  baseline,  the
children given active treatment were more likely to improve during
treatment (RR versus sham adjustment 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95,
Analysis 4.2.1) and had fewer wet nights after treatment stopped
(MD -1.8, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.64, Analysis 4.4.1).

In another small trial (Feng 2008), pinching massage seemed to be
as good as desmopressin during treatment (Analysis 4.1.1; Analysis

5. Diet or restricted foods versus no treatment or placebo or
another treatment (Comparison 5)

Two  trials  tested  the  effect  of  dietary  manipulation  on  enuresis
(Egger 1992 #; McKendry 1975).

In  the  first  trial  (Egger  1992  #),  a  subsample  of  children  whose
enuresis appeared to respond to a restricted 'few-foods' diet (see
Characteristics  of  Included  Studies  Table)  were  tested  in  double-
blind randomised fashion by re-introducing test foods which were
thought to affect enuresis. Relapse occurred in 6/9 children given
test  foods  compared  with  0/9  given  placebo  (non-reactive)  foods
(Analysis  5.2.1).  However,  the  numbers  were  too  few  for  reliable
comparison.

In the other trial (McKendry 1975), only one child became dry on a
restricted diet (see Characteristics of Included Studies Table). There
was a high drop out rate from this group due to parents finding the
diet too difficult to enforce as well as ineffective. Counting dropouts
as  failures,  imipramine  was  more  effective  during  treatment  (RR
1.20,  95%  CI  1.07  to  1.33,  Analysis  5.1.1)  (McKendry  1975).  Two
children also seemed to become aggressive on the diet.

6. Faradization versus no treatment or placebo or another
treatment (Comparison 6)

One crossover trial using sham faradization as the control placebo
intervention addressed this issue (Cupalova 1988 #). There was not
enough  evidence  to  assess  if  there  was  a  difference  between  the
active and control arms: 12 out of 50 improved on active treatment
and 9 out of 50 on the control treatment (Analysis 6.1.1). It was not
possible to assess any differences in number of wet nights (Analysis
6.2) due to lack of data.

7. Medicinal herbs versus no treatment or placebo or another
treatment (Comparison 7)

Five trials addressed this comparison:

• versus desmopressin in one (Wang 2009),
• versus meclofenoxate in another(Hu 2008), and
• versus  imipramine  in  the  others  (Cheng  2007;  Feng  1999;  Zhu

2005).

In  one  small  trial  (Wang  2009),  which  compared  Chinese
medicinal herbs with desmopressin, the numbers were too few to
demonstrate a difference in the improvement rate (Analysis 7.2.2),
but there was a lower failure or relapse rate after herbal treatment
than  after  desmopressin  (RR  0.35,  95%  CI  0.14  to  0.85,  Analysis
7.3.1).

In  another  trial  (Hu  2008),  which  compared  Chinese  medicinal
herbs with meclofenoxate, the difference in the failure rate was not
statistically significant (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.16, Analysis 7.2.1).

In the other trials (Cheng 2007 ; Feng 1999 ; Zhu 2005 ), medicinal
herbs appeared to be better than imipramine both during (Analysis
7.1.1;  Analysis  7.2.3)  and  after  treatment  (RR  0.41,  95%CI  0.20  to
0.84, Analysis 7.3.2).

Adverse effects

Eight  trials  mentioned  adverse  effects  associated  with  the
interventions:

• dizziness or dry mouth with imipramine (Cheng 2007);
• headache or stomach ache with desmopressin (Feng 2008);
• nasal  itch  in  all  three  arms  of  a  desmopressin/placebo  trial

(Kahan 1998);

• headache or nausea with piracetam (Khosroshahi 1989);
• headache,  stiff  neck  and  lumbar  spine  pain  with  chiropractic

(Leboeuf 1991);

• aggressiveness on a restrictive diet (McKendry 1975);
• headaches,  abdominal  pain  or 

fatigue  with 

imipramine

(McKendry 1975);

• eyelid  edema,  hypertension  or  headache  with  desmopressin

(Wang 2009);

• poor appetite or dry mouth with Chinese medicinal herbs (Zhu

2005);

• dry  mouth,  nausea,  headache,  constipation,  sweat  or  mild

insomnia with imipramine (Zhu 2005).

One trial report stated that there were no adverse effects (Radmayr
2001) and the remainder did not mention them.

D I S C U S S I O N

There  were  few  randomised  controlled  trials  on  complementary
therapies  for  nocturnal  enuresis  in  children,  and  most  of  the
treatment  comparisons  considered  in  this  review  were  tested
only  in  single  trials.  Meta-analyses  were  rarely  possible  because
of  clinical  or  statistical  heterogeneity.  Overall  the  quality  of  the
trials was poor. Of the 24 randomised controlled trials identified,
none  had  a  securely  concealed  method  of  allocation.  Baseline
comparability of the treatment and control groups were doubtful
in 12 of the 24 trials. In the two crossover trials, a washout period
was not reported. Excluding the two cross-over trials, only 9 of the
22 trials provided follow-up information about the enuretic status
of the children after the end of the trial treatment.

SUMMARY OF MAIN RESULTS

Hypnosis

One  trial  suggested  hypnosis  was  better  than  imipramine  in  the
treatment  of  enuresis,  although  the  cure  rates  reported  included
improvement (Bannerjee 1993). The lack of a placebo or untreated
control  group  also  made  it  difficult  to  judge  the  effectiveness
of  hypnosis.  The  author  attributed  the  lower  relapse  rate  in  the
hypnosis  group  to  continuing  self-hypnosis  in  the  participants.  If
this is true, hypnosis had actually been continued for longer and
the true "relapse" rate had yet to be seen after completion of all
"hypnosis" treatment. Another trial claimed that children receiving
trance or suggestions or a combination of trance and suggestions

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

had  better  outcomes  than  waiting  list  controls  (Edwards  1985).
However,  the  sample  size  was  small  and  no  statistical  tests
on  between-group  comparisons  were  reported.  In  addition,  the
baseline severity of enuresis was somewhat different between the
groups; and hence the authors' conclusion is open to question. In
the third trial (Seabrook 2005), hypnotherapy appeared to have a
higher failure rate than alarm therapy, as it was a small trial, and
lack of a placebo or untreated control group made it also difficult
to judge the effectiveness of hypnotherapy.

Psychotherapy

During  treatment,  psychological  or  supportive 
interventions
seemed to be better in achieving dry nights compared to untreated
controls after combining results across studies (Ronen 1992; Sacks
1974;  Werry  1965).  However,  there  was  significant  heterogeneity,
the positive overall effect depended on only one trial (Ronen 1992)
and  it  disappeared  when  a  random  effects  model  was  used.  It  is
therefore questionable whether it is appropriate to combine data
from the trials or to rely on the findings.

During  treatment,  imipramine  was  better  than  psychotherapy  in
one small trial (Ciotti 1983) but follow up data were not provided.
Psychological or supportive interventions appeared to have lower
failure  rate  than  desmopressin  (Kahan  1998),  rewards  (Ronen
1992) and piracetam (Khosroshahi 1989) in single trials. They also
seemed  to  result  in  fewer  wet  nights  than  with  desmopressin
(Kahan  1998)  or  untreated  controls  (Ronen  1992),  and  fewer
children  relapsing  than  with  rewards  (Ronen  1992)  or  alarms
(Ronen 1992). However, since only single trials with small sample
size  and  questionable  quality  reported  success,  evidence  on  the
effectiveness of psychological treatments is not strong.

Psychological  or  supportive  interventions  were  probably  not  as
good  as  alarms  (Ronen  1992;  Sacks  1974;  Werry  1965)  although
again there were doubts about the statistical reliability of the data.

Finally,  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  judge  whether  the
apparent  benefit  of  psychological  counselling  compared  with
desmopressin persisted after treatment stopped (Kahan 1998).

Acupuncture

Acupuncture  seemed  superior  to  a  sham  procedure  in  achieving
dry  nights  after  treatment  in  one  trial  (Mao  1998).  However,  the
quality of the trial was suboptimal in that allocation concealment
was  unclear,  blinding  was  not  possible  and  duration  of  follow-
up  was  not  given.  Two  small  trials  (Hui  2006;  Radmayr  2001),
which compared acupuncture with imipramine and desmopressin
separately, did not have adequate statistical power to demonstrate
differences  in  either  cure  or  relapse  rates.  In  another  trial  (Pan
2009  NEWa),  acupuncture  appeared  to  have  a  lower  failure  rate
than  meclofenoxate,  it  was  a  quasi-randomised  study  which
provided weak evidence. In the trial (Jiang 2000), acupuncture also
appeared to have a lower failure rate than a combination of drugs
(meclofenoxate, oryzanol and thiamine) but the suboptimal quality
of the trial and the lack of placebo control group cast doubt on the
authors' conclusions.

Two  of  these  drugs,  meclofenoxate  and  oryzanol  (see  Additional
Table 1) can be regarded as complementary medicines. However,
it was not possible to gauge whether they had any effect as they
were  given  in  combination  with  the  B1  vitamin  thiamine,  and
acupuncture seemed to be better (Jiang 2000).

Chiropractic

One of three RCTs identified on chiropractic therapy provided weak
evidence for its effectiveness (Reed 1994). The group given active
chiropractic adjustment were more likely to improve and had less
frequent enuresis post-treatment. However, children in the active
treatment  group  had  less  severe  enuresis  at  baseline,  leading  to
doubts  about  adequacy  of  randomisation  and  comparability  of
enuresis severity between the groups, which might bias the results.
Another trial (Leboeuf 1991), was too small and the duration too
short  to  provide  useful  information.  In  another  trial  (Feng  2008),
pinching massage seemed to be as good as desmopressin during
treatment,  but  it  was  a  single  small  trial  with  no  follow  up,  and
needs to be verified in further trials.

Diet

The effects of dietary manipulation is uncertain. In the crossover
trial  (Egger  1992  #),  a  number  of  children  who  responded  to  an
oligoantigenic ('low antigen') diet relapsed when test foods were
reintroduced but did not relapse with non-reactive (placebo) foods.
However, the numbers were too few for reliable comparison. The
other trial of restricted diet (McKendry 1975) had a high drop out
rate due to difficulty in implementing the diet and being perceived
as ineffective by the families, rendering the results unreliable.

Faradization

difference in success rate, albeit with wide confidence intervals.

faradization  compared  with  sham 

Medicinal herbs

Five  trials  used  medicinal  herbs  treatment  for  children  with
enuresis. One small trial (Wang 2009), of Chinese medicinal herbs
appeared to have a lower relapse rate after the end of treatment
with herbs than after desmopressin treatment.

In  one  trial  Hu  2008,  medicinal  herbs  did  not  appear  to  be  more
effective than meclofenoxate but the confidence interval was wide.

In  another  three  trials  (Cheng  2007;  Feng  1999  ;  Zhu  2005),
three  different  preparations  of  medicinal  herbs  were  compared
to imipramine. Although the outcome measures varied, the herbs
seemed  to  be  better  than  imipramine  both  during  and  after
treatment.

However,  all  these  trials  had  small  sample  sizes  or  were  of
questionable  quality,  and  none  compared  medicinal  herbs  to  a
placebo  or  untreated  control  group.  Therefore,  the  evidence  on
the  effectiveness  of  medicinal  herb  treatment  for  children  with
enuresis is not strong, and needs to be verified in further trials.

Homeopathy and Surgery

There  were  no  randomised  controlled  trials  of  homeopathy
or  surgery  for  nocturnal  enuresis  in  children  and  hence  their
effectiveness is uncertain.

Adverse effects

Adverse  effects  identified  in  eight  of  the  24  RCTs  were  generally
mild  and  self-limiting.  However,  the  adverse  effects  could  not  be
attributed to the trial treatments with certainty. Furthermore, the

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

majority  of  the  trials  (15)  failed  to  mention  whether  or  not  there
were adverse effects.

Other considerations

One factor which makes interpretation of trials of complementary
treatment problematic is that it is often difficult to disentangle the
effect of time spent with a therapist (ie the placebo or psychological
support  provided)  from  the  actual  treatment  being  tested.
However,  treatment  of  enuresis  can  provide  a  robust,  objective
and  measurable  endpoint  (ie  a  wet  bed)  which  might  make  it  a
uniquely suitable condition for testing complementary therapies.
Economic outcome measures should include consideration of the
cost  of  provision  of  the  treatments  and  evaluation  of  outcomes
using  personal  and  societal  costs  as  well  as  those  to  the  health
service.

One  paper  included  a  minority  of  participants  classed  as  'young
adults' (Jiang 2000). It was not possible to identify their outcomes
separately. However, this group with persisting enuresis may have
a particularly intractable problem, and might benefit from research
specific to their needs.

There was no information available about how often homeopathic
or other complementary treatments are used in children. Such age-
specific  data  might  help  to  put  in  perspective  the  current  use  of
such treatments and suggest what scope there might be for future
trials in children.

In  summary,  there  was  not  sufficient  evidence  that  any  of  the
complementary  treatment  modalities  included  in  the  current
review  were  clearly  effective  in  treating  childhood  nocturnal
enuresis, but by the same token there was not sufficient evidence
to say that they were ineffective. Despite the wide use of many of
these alternative therapies, the evidence we have found does not
support  their  use  until  proper  randomised  trials  have  been  done
to  demonstrate  their  effectiveness.  Among  the  complementary
and  other  therapies,  hypnosis,  psychotherapy,  acupuncture,
chiropractic and medicinal herbs look most promising and warrant
further research.

A U T H O R S '   C O N C L U S I O N S

Implications for practice

There  was  weak  evidence  to  support  the  use  of  hypnosis,
psychotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic and medicinal herbs but
it  was  provided  in  each  case  by  single  small  trials  of  dubious
methodological rigour.

The current review did not find sufficient evidence about the use
of  dietary  manipulation  or  faradization,  nor  any  evidence  about
homeopathy  or  surgery  for  nocturnal  enuresis  in  children.  Long-
term effects are uncertain. Despite the fact that these treatments
are  widely  used  in  practice,  current  evidence  does  not  support
their use until proper randomised trials have demonstrated their
effectiveness. However, judged on the evidence available adverse
effects  of  these  therapies  seemed  to  be  generally  mild.  When
standard  effective  therapies  such  as  enuretic  alarms  have  failed
or  are  contraindicated,  these  complementary  therapies  might
be  considered  after  careful  discussion  with  parents.  Parents
should be thoroughly informed of the uncertain effectiveness and
possible  adverse  effects  of  these  alternatives.  In  addition,  these
complementary  therapies  should  be  administered  on  a  research

basis as part of a randomised controlled trial whenever possible,
with efficacy and adverse effects carefully monitored.

Implications for research

High-quality  randomised  controlled  trials  of  complementary
therapies  for  nocturnal  enuresis  are  lacking  to  inform  practicing
clinicians of the effectiveness of alternative treatments particularly
when conventional therapies fail. Future trials of complementary
therapies  should  address  the  importance  of  concealment  of
randomisation, employ placebo or sham controls when possible,
try  to  achieve  blinding  of  therapy  for  patients  and  clinicians
and  outcome  assessors,  ensure  adequate  sample  size  to  attain
satisfactory  statistical  power,  allow  an  adequate  washout  period
for  crossover  trials,  and  follow  up  patients  for  a  longer  period  of
time. However, the existence of a robust outcome measure, a wet
bed, should facilitate the design of objective trials.

Mean number of dry nights per week during trial: A: 4.5, B: 4.5, C: 4.8, D: 2.1 
Mean number of dry nights per week after trial ended: A: 4.3 B: 4.6 C: 5.1 D: 2.8 
Trialists reported that children in groups A B and C improved between baseline and 6 month follow up
(A: F-ratio=9.04; B: 14.27, C=5.67) but not in group D (untreated control), F ratio=0.027 
No data suitable for comparison between groups was provided, but the authors concluded that the ef-
fect was significant only in groups A and B, ie the effect was due to the suggestions rather than the hyp-
nosis 
Adverse effects: not mentioned

Comparability of groups not statistically tested but there were baseline differences in dry nights (A and
C had more dry nights at baseline than B or D) 
Unclear if intention to treat 
No details of previous treatment 
Data from graphs 
No SDs

Hypnotic (trance) induction was standardised using a treatment protocol

Suggestions aimed at enuresis included increasing bladder capacity by 'holding on' during the day; re-
duction of fluids before bedtime; emptying bladder before going to bed; waking at night to empty blad-
der if it feels full

Egger 1992 # 

Methods

Study 1: not RCT 
Trial 2: RCT, double blind crossover, order of test or placebo food decided randomly (random numbers)
with at least one week washout between arms 
Systematic baseline measure of wetting: No 
Organic causes excluded: No 
Daytime wetting excluded: No (16/21 children had diurnal wetting)

Setting Trial 2: subsample of children from bigger Study 1 of few-foods diet for children with migraine
and hyperkinetic syndrome

Participants

Study 1: 21 children with migraine (8) or hyperkinetic syndrome (13) who also had enuresis, treated
with an exclusion / reintroduction diet to identify provoking foods 
Inclusion: age over 5 years, enuresis at least once per week, one child had a UTI, no enuresis treatment
during Study 1 or Trial 2

Trial 2: 9 of the 21 children who responded to the diet 
Age: 3.5 to 14 years (mean 7.5 years)

Interventions

Study 1 (21 children): phase 1 = oligoantigenic (few-foods) diet for 4 weeks (Diet 2 used if no response) 
Phase 2 for those who responded = reintroduction phase for 2 weeks (new foods introduced one at a
time for a week, stopped earlier if symptoms returned)

Trial 2 in 9 children who responded to Study 1 by reaching an acceptable diet: 
A (9): active food in placebo food 
B (9): placebo food only

Notes

Risk of bias

Bias

Study 1: enuresis ceased in 12/21 and improved (reduction of 50% in wet nights) in 4/21 others (5/21
did not respond to diet) 
Most common (over 30%) foods provoking enuresis in 16 responders: chocolate, orange, benzoic acid
and tartrazine, blackcurrants, cow's milk

Trial 2 
Relapse in A: 6/9, B: 0/9 (McNemar P<0.05) 
No evidence of order effect, data given for first and second arms separately

Children who relapsed with active foods usually reacted to several different foods

Study 1 
Few-foods diet 1 = 2 meats (lamb and chicken), 2 carbohydrates (potatoes and rice), two fruits (ba-
nanas and apples), vegetables (cabbage, sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, cucumber and carrots), water,
salt, pepper, herbs, calcium and vitamins 
Few-foods diet 2 (if not improved on Diet 1) = foods not included in Diet 1

Trial 2: suspect (test) foods reintroduced by blind addition to non-reactive (placebo) foods: 
Test = cow's milk, placebo = sheep or goat milk 
Test = orange juice, placebo = blackcurrant, apricot or pineapple 
Test = wheat, placebo = rice or oats 
Test = benzoate, placebo = calcium lactate capsules 
Test = pork or egg, placebo = savoury base of potato flour, carrots, caramel, sage, onion, lentils and salt

Appendix 1. Search methods for the previous version of this review

The search methods used for the previous version of this review (Glazener 2005b) are given below:

This review has drawn on the search strategy developed for the Incontinence Review Group. Relevant trials were identified from the Group's
Specialised Register of controlled trials which is described, along with the group search strategy, under the Incontinence Group's details in
The Cochrane Library (For more details please see the ‘Specialized Register’ section of the Group’s module in The Cochrane Library). The
Specialised Register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and
handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. The Incontinence Group Specialised Register was searched using the Group's own
keyword system. The search terms used were:
({design.cct*} OR {design.rct*})
AND
({topic.urine.enuresis*})
(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 9.5 N, ISI ResearchSoft).
Date of the most recent search of the register for this review: 16 November 2006.
The trials in the Incontinence Group Specialised Register are also contained in CENTRAL.

For this review, extra specific searches were performed. These are detailed below.

The Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS) was searched on 25 June 2004 by one reviewer (DC).
The years searched were January 1984 to June 2004 inclusive, using the following keyword search: clinical trial AND nocturnal enuresis.

For  a  previous  systematic  review  of  enuresis  treatments  (Lister-Sharp  1997),  extra  specific  searches  were  performed.  The  reviewers
obtained information from a variety of sources, including organisations, manufacturers and individuals. These sources are listed in the
NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Report (Lister-Sharp 1997). The reference list resulting from these sources was searched.

We did not impose any language or other limits on any of the searches.

Substantive amendment

C O N T R I B U T I O N S   O F   A U T H O R S

The current review is amended based on the previous review (Complementary and miscellaneous interventions for nocturnal enuresis in
children) written by Cathryn MA Glazener, Jonathan HC Evans and Daniel KL Cheuk. In the current review, a new objective (to determine
the effects of medicinal herbs on children with nocturnal enuresis) was added.

TH: searching for trials, quality assessment of trials, data extraction, data analysis, review development.
XS: searching for trials, data extraction, and quality assessment of trials.
YH: data analysis, review development.

Previous version of this review author contributions:
CMAG used the data extracted by the York reviewers, converted them into Cochrane Review format, separated into seven component
interventions (of which this is one). She edited the text of the original and wrote additional text for the previous review.
JHCE contributed to writing and editing the previous review.
DKLC contributed to writing and editing the previous review.

D E C L A R A T I O N S   O F   I N T E R E S T

For the previous version of the review - one of the authors: JHCE has received reimbursement for attending a conference, fees for lecturing
and a consultancy fee which was paid into a research fund from Ferring Pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of desmopressin.
