Summary

The world-wide prevalence of insomnia disorder reaches up to 10% of the adult pop-

ulation. Women are more often afflicted than men, and insomnia disorder is a risk

factor for somatic and mental illness, especially depression and anxiety disorders.

Persistent hyperarousals at the cognitive, emotional, cortical and/or physiological

levels are central to most theories regarding the pathophysiology of insomnia. Of the

defining features of insomnia disorder, the discrepancy between minor objective

polysomnographic alterations of sleep continuity and substantive subjective impair-

ment in insomnia disorder remains enigmatic. Microstructural alterations, especially
in rapid eye movement sleep (“rapid eye movement sleep instability”), might explain

this mismatch between subjective and objective findings. As rapid eye movement

sleep represents the most highly aroused brain state during sleep, it might be particu-

larly prone to fragmentation in individuals with persistent hyperarousal. In conse-

quence, mentation during rapid eye movement sleep may be toned more as

conscious-like wake experience, reflecting pre-sleep concerns. It is suggested that

this instability of rapid eye movement sleep is involved in the mismatch between sub-

jective and objective measures of sleep in insomnia disorder. Furthermore, as rapid

eye movement sleep has been linked in previous works to emotional processing,

rapid eye movement sleep instability could play a central role in the close association

between insomnia and depressive and anxiety disorders.

Approximately 6%–10% of the adult population in industrialised coun-

tries suffer from chronic insomnia according to DSM-IV criteria,

defined by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep with associated

daytime symptoms for at least 4 weeks. Women are more frequently

afflicted than men, and this difference becomes more pronounced
after the age of 45–50 years (Ohayon, 2002). Data on the course of

insomnia indicate that once persisting for at least a month, it fre-

is involved in the development of cognitive impairment. Insomnia is a

risk factor for work disability, sick leave and impaired work perfor-

mance (Kucharczyk et al., 2012). Not surprisingly, ID is associated with

a high burden for the healthcare system and society: 150 billion US

dollars have been calculated as direct and indirect costs of insomnia

(Reynolds & Ebben, 2017). Data from Germany (DAK Gesundheitsre-

port; Marschall et al., 2017) show a rise in the prevalence of insomnia

from 2009 to 2016, and a parallel increase in hypnotic prescriptions.

Besides that, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a further significant

increase in insomnia prevalence (Morin et al., 2022).

Summarising, chronic insomnia is a highly prevalent disorder, with

a strong negative impact on somatic and mental health coupled

with high costs for the healthcare system. The DSM-5 (American Psy-

inadequate opportunity (i.e. enough time is allotted for sleep) or
inadequate circumstances (i.e. the environment is safe, dark, quiet and

least three times per week.
