Social Scaffolding of Human Amygdala-mPFC Circuit 
Development

Nim Tottenham, Ph.D.

Abstract

Strong evidence indicates that reciprocal connections between the amygdala and medial prefrontal 
cortex (mPFC) support fundamental aspects of emotional behavior in adulthood. However, this 
circuitry is slow to develop in humans, exhibiting immaturity in childhood. The argument is made 
that the development of this circuitry in humans is intimately associated with caregiving, such that 
parental availability during childhood provides important and enduring scaffolding of 
neuroaffective processes that ultimately form of the nature of the adult phenotype.

Social Scaffolding of Human Amygdala-mPFC Circuit Development

Adverse caregiving early in life is a major risk factor for mental illness later in life (Heim & 
Nemeroff, 2001). The mental illnesses most associated with early life caregiving adversity 
include those whose root problems involve difficulty with emotion regulation. These links 
suggest strongly that early caregiving influences adult outcomes by acting proximally on the 
neurobiology of emotion regulation. In this review, the influences of early caregiving will be 
discussed as they relate to developmental changes in core circuitry of emotion regulation 
processes, namely the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex.

The neurobiology of emotion has been extensively and best characterized at the level of the 
amygdala and its connections with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Amygdala nuclei 
rest subcortically and mediate emotional learning, increasing attention to and arousal for 
emotionally relevant stimuli (Davis & Whalen, 2001). In adulthood, these nuclei are 
bidirectionally coupled with the mPFC to provide tight regulation over emotional behaviors 
(Banks, Eddy, Angstadt, Nathan, & Phan, 2007; Motzkin, Philippi, Wolf, Baskaya, & 
Koenigs, 2015; Phelps, Delgado, Nearing, & LeDoux, 2004). As will be discussed in more 
detail below, evidence suggests that the amygdala is an earlier developing structure relative 
to the prefrontal cortex, which may not show mature functioning until late adolescence or 
early adulthood. This late development of the circuitry raises the question of how emotion 
regulation is accomplished prior to neuromaturity. This paper posits that during development

of amygdala-mPFC circuitry, the parental stimulus provides significant scaffolding of 
neuroaffective processing in ways that both support emotion regulation in the child and has 
enduring effects of adult functioning.

Human research has shown that early caregiving adversity influences brain development, 
and there is a disproportionate influence on affective systems (Cohen, Tottenham, & Casey, 
2013; Davidson & McEwen, 2012; Gianaros et al., 2008; Tottenham & Sheridan, 2010). For 
example, adults who report a history of early maltreatment (abuse, neglect) exhibit 
exaggerated amygdala reactivity in response to emotional or stressful stimuli (Banihashemi, 
Sheu, Midei, & Gianaros, 2014; Dannlowski et al., 2013), which corresponds to greater 
emotional responding at the level of behavior. At the same time, there is a relative lack of 
prefrontal connectivity in adults reporting childhood adversity suggesting less regulatory 
tone over the amygdala (Burghy et al., 2012), including during effortful attempts to regulate 
emotions (e.g., cognitively reappraising emotionally distressing images) (Kim et al., 2013). 
Findings like these suggest that one significant outcome of early caregiving adversity is 
diminished prefrontal regulation of the amygdala.

These studies are examples of some of the best evidence to date showing that early 
caregiving adversity produces enduring effects in affective neurocircuitry that last into 
adulthood in humans. One large challenge to these conclusions lies in the reliance on 
retrospective reporting, which might increase the risk of apocryphal reports (Maughan & 
Rutter, 1997). Perhaps a greater challenge is the limited ability to make claims about the 
developmental timing of events (infancy vs childhood vs adolescence) – without this 
information, the temporal resolution for identifying sensitive periods is blurred. 
Compounding this challenge is the fact that for most individuals who experience adversity 
early in life, the odds of experiencing future adverse events are unfortunately high. Thus it 
cannot be ascertained whether the early event, the later events, or the accumulation of 
adverse events over a lifetime (Evans & Kim, 2007; Sameroff, 2000) caused the adult 
outcome.

Knowledge about timing is important because with this information, we can search for 
correlations between timing of the event and developmental changes in underlying 
neurocircuitry. The coincidence between an environmental event and development of a 
particular circuit is a critical step in developing a neurobiologically plausible mechanistic 
model of early environmental influences that can be empirically tested. Animal models 
provide an opportunity to consider timing factors given the great control over the timing and 
administration of parental care (Moriceau, Raineki, Holman, Holman, & Sullivan, 2009; 
Sanchez et al., 2005). This control is usually not available in human studies.

At the heart of much research examining the coincidence of environmental agents and 
neurodevelopment is the concept of sensitive periods for brain development. A priming or 
“readiness” of a particular neural system may be referred to as a sensitive period. A sensitive 
period is a period in development during which certain capacities are readily shaped or 
altered by particular experiences (Knudsen, 2004). These special periods allow for 
developmentally-unique moments for learning that endures, which scaffolds the maturation 
of brain function and behavioral output.

For the past 14 years, I have been working on research projects studying a group of children 
and adolescents who have a unique caregiving history. This group of children and 
adolescents were born outside of the United States and spent the majority of their infancy in 
institutional care (e.g., orphanages) and thus experienced significant and extreme parental 
deprivation as a result of institutional care. At some point, which differs across individuals, 
children were adopted by families in the United States via international adoption. Families 
that adopt internationally are, in research terms, a special group of families; because 
international adoption often requires that parents travel to the country of adoption and stay 
for some extended time, the families typically have the financial means to adopt 
internationally. They tend to be a highly educated group of parents (Balding, Feng, & 
Atashband, 2015; Hellerstedt et al., 2008); and most importantly for child outcome, they 
clearly have a great desire to provide care since international adoption requires significant 
effort. It is this desire to provide care that has been most closely linked to optimal child 
outcomes (Hodges & Tizard, 1989). This naturally occurring developmental timeline – that 
is, early caregiving adversity followed by family enrichment – allows for asking questions 
about early caregiving experiences in a temporally defined manner, which unlike in tightly 
controlled animal studies, is rare in human research. As described by Gunnar and colleagues 
(M.R. Gunnar, Bruce, & Grotevant, 2000), institutional care – even in the best of 
circumstances – is a suboptimal caregiving situation. The caregivers are staff, who rotate 
shifts and who are responsible for the care of a high number of infants and children. There 
are, of course a huge number of unknowns when working with this population – prenatal 
records are unavailable and preadoption records are not always reliable. There is also wide 
variation in the quality of care from country to country and from orphanage to orphanage; 
e.g., the wretched conditions described in some orphanages is not representative of all 
institutional care facilities. However, there is one important constant across all institutional 
care settings, which is the lack of a stable caregiver, the most potent stressor for a developing 
infant.

At the time of adoption, many children exhibit a number of developmental delays including 
motor, cognitive, and emotional; however, because of the family environments into which 
previously-institutionalized (PI) children and adolescents are adopted, they often show 
remarkable rebound. The rate of developmental improvement is notable such that across 
many domains of behavior, PI children begin to more closely resemble children without a 
history of caregiving adversity (Nelson et al., 2007; Rutter, 1998).

In many cases however, catch-up is incomplete. In particular, socio-emotional behaviors 
often exhibit lingering effects despite the enriched environment of the adoptive home. While 
there is large heterogeneity in outcome, with some children thriving, one of the most 
common concerns that adoptive parents report is heightened emotional reactivity and 
difficulty with self and emotion regulation (Casey et al., 2009; Malter Cohen et al., 2013; 
Merz & McCall, 2010; Wiik et al., 2011). For example, at the group level, PI youth exhibit 
heightened trait anxiety and increased depressive symptoms, particularly in adolescence 
(Goff et al., 2013). On laboratory tests, PI youth are more likely to show behavioral 
interference from highly arousing emotional stimuli (Tottenham et al., 2010) and increased 
behavioral freezing in response to fear eliciting stimuli (Stellern, Esposito, Mliner, Pears, & 
Gunnar, 2014).

At the neural level, these behaviors have been paralleled by differences in amygdala and 
medial prefrontal cortex development (Gee, Gabard-Durnam, et al., 2013; Tottenham, Hare, 
Millner, et al., 2011; Tottenham et al., 2010). Specifically, on average, PI youth have 
exhibited larger amygdala volumes (Mehta et al., 2009; Tottenham et al., 2010) (though see 
Hanson et al., 2014; Hodel et al., 2015) and heightened amygdala reactivity in response to 
emotional stimuli, like fearful faces (Gee, Gabard-Durnam, et al., 2013; Tottenham, Hare, 
Millner, et al., 2011) relative to peers without a history of institutional caregiving. There is 
some evidence that the age at which children were removed from institutional care is 
important in that larger amygdala volumes were observed in children adopted at a later age 
(after their first birthday; Tottenham et al., 2010). Earlier reports using PET scanning have 
shown that the pattern of resting glucose metabolism in medial temporal structures including 
the amygdala was lower in children adopted from Romanian orphanages (whose duration in 
institutional care ranged from 16 to 90 months) compared to the activity of controls (the 
nonepileptic hemisphere of children with a history of epilepsy) (Chugani et al., 2001). It is 
not possible to obtain basal activity of the amygdala using fMRI, but with the PET and fMRI 
data taken together, these findings may suggest that the amygdala hyperactivity in PI youth 
may be specifically elicited by emotional events in the environment.

The amygdala phenotypes described are consistent with a large non-human animal literature 
showing that premature separations from the parent (i.e., mothers in the case of rats) is 
causally related to premature development of amygdala structure (Ono et al., 2008) and 
function (Moriceau & Sullivan, 2006) as well as increased anxiety (Ono et al., 2008) and 
premature fear-learning (Moriceau & Sullivan, 2006). These effects on the amygdala have 
been shown to be mediated by the stress hormone corticosterone (Moriceau & Sullivan, 
2004), the end-product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Notably, 
dysregulation of the HPA axis in PI youths have also been documented (Gee, Gabard-
Durnam, et al., 2013; M. R. Gunnar, Frenn, Wewerka, & Van Ryzin, 2009; Koss, Hostinar, 
Donzella, & Gunnar, 2014; Wismer Fries, Shirtcliff, & Pollak, 2008) across laboratories. 
However, there is evidence that these cortisol phenotypes were improved upon adoption (for 
earlier adoption) relative to institutional care (McLaughlin et al., 2015).

Animal studies that have examined the effects of premature separation from the parent have 
also shown evidence that amygdala-mPFC circuitry is atypical in part because the early 
separations act to accelerate development of this circuit. For example, separation from the 
mother has been followed by premature myelination of amygdala neurons (Ono et al., 2008), 
earlier engagement of amygdala function during fear learning (Moriceau & Sullivan, 2006), 
more adult-like retention of fear memories (Callaghan & Richardson, 2012b; Cowan, 
Callaghan, & Richardson, 2013), and adult-like fear extinction learning, suggesting that the 
mPFC becomes engaged at a premature age following maternal separation (Callaghan & 
Richardson, 2012a; Cowan et al., 2013). These amygdala-mPFC differences following 
maternal separation have been interpreted as ontogenetic adaptations (Callaghan, Sullivan, 
Howell, & Tottenham, 2014; Callaghan & Tottenham, 2015) that occur in response to 
environmental signals that the mother is unavailable. Viewed in this way, development may 
proceed with a reprioritization towards neural circuitry that will aid in independent 
navigation of the safety and danger of the environment (i.e., survival). In our laboratory, we 
have examined functional connectivity in the amygdala-mPFC circuitry following early

institutional care and observed that children with a history of institutional caregiving 
similarly show a more “adult-like” pattern of connectivity between the amygdala and mPFC 
relative to children without a history of institutional care (Gee et al., 2013). Current thinking 
is that early caregiving adversity may act to accelerate the closure of a developmental 
sensitive period for amygdala-mPFC circuitry. This difference in connectivity in the PI 
children may be a developmental adaptation that helps meet the immediate needs of 
regulating highly reactive amygdala nuclei. The current framework is based on the idea that 
early chronic absence of parental availability results in early and high amygdala reactivity. 
This reactivity may initiate earlier development of connections with the mPFC. Moreover, 
this adaptation seems to benefit children such that those PI youth who exhibit the “adult-
like” functional connectivity exhibit lower trait anxiety than those that do not (Gee et al., 
2013). However, structural connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging has identified 
reduced white matter integrity in tracts that run between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex 
in previously-institutionalized children (Bick et al., 2015; Govindan, Behen, Helder, Makki, 
& Chugani, 2009) suggesting that functional and structural connectivity follow different 
developmental trajectories following early adversity.

Across laboratories, researchers have shown that early parental absence is associated with 
age-atypical emotional behaviors. Moreover, for decades, researchers and theorists of 
varying orientations (including ethological/attachment theories, parenting styles, family 
systems) have discussed the profound influence of parental availability on emotional 
behaviors and development (Baumrind, 1966; Bowen, 1966b; Bowlby, 1982; Gewirtz, Baer, 
& Roth, 1958; Hofer, 1994a). The goal of this paper is to address the question: if parental 
availability is so important for emotional development, what exactly is parental availability 
doing on a moment-to-moment basis to scaffold affective neurobiology in enduring ways? 
Can we develop a testable neurobehavioral model that characterizes parental influence on 
emotional development?

To develop such a model, it is useful to first characterize what is known about human 
amygdala development and its connections with mPFC. These data have been collected in a 
standard laboratory manner such that parents were not allowed in the scanner room. In 
general, fMRI studies show that the amygdala is highly reactive to emotional stimuli. For 
example, in response to fear faces (Gee et al., 2013) or other highly arousing negative 
images (Decety, Michalska, & Kinzler, 2012; Silvers, Shu, Hubbard, Weber, & Ochsner, 
2014; Swartz, Carrasco, Wiggins, Thomason, & Monk, 2014; Vink, Derks, Hoogendam, 
Hillegers, & Kahn, 2014) children show a very strong amygdala response that typically 
exceeds that of older participants (adolescents and adults). (Importantly, not all studies have 
shown high amygdala reactivity in childhood. In Hare et al. (2008), amygdala response in 
children was lower than adolescents’. It is unclear why these differences exist. One 
possibility is that the nature of the stimuli or task used to elicit amygdala reactivity in 
children matters. This is an important matter for future research to clarify). This strong 
amygdala responding to negatively valenced stimuli is paralleled by immature functional 
and structural connectivity with the mPFC. Functional anisotropy measures (diffusion tensor 
imaging) of the uncinate fasciculus, a primary structural connection between the amygdala 
and prefrontal cortex, shows low structural integrity of white matter relative to adult levels 
(Lebel et al., 2012; Swartz et al., 2014). Functional connectivity, which measures the degree

to which two regions correlate in time, has also been shown to exhibit immature coupling 
between the amygdala and the mPFC during childhood (Decety et al., 2012; Gabard-
Durnam et al., 2014; Gee, Humphreys, et al., 2013; Perlman & Pelphrey, 2011). For 
example, in our laboratory, we have observed that unlike adults and adolescents who show 
strong amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity, children (under the age of 10 years old) 
either show an absence of stable connectivity (during resting state (Gabard-Durnam et al., 
2014)) or a child-unique connectivity pattern that suggests the nature of communication 
between the amygdala and mPFC is yet immature and perhaps not exhibiting the regulatory 
relationship it does in the adult (Gee, Humphreys, et al., 2013). Taken together, these data 
show that childhood (prior to adolescence) is characterized by heightened amygdala 
reactivity without the addition of mature top-down control from prefrontal inputs (see Figure 
2).

In the absence of a mature amygdala-mPFC circuit, how is emotional regulation 
accomplished in young ages? The rodent work of Myron Hofer is probably some of the most 
relevant when addressing this question. Hofer and his team were able to show that the parent 
(mother in rodents) is a primary regulator of offspring physiology and homeostasis (Hofer, 
1994b). This work in addition to the pioneering research of Seymour Levine (e.g., Levine & 
Mody, 2003) (and his many students) was critical in laying the ground work for future ideas 
centered on conceptualizing infant brain development in the context of parental milieu. 
These research studies were performed in developing rodents, which are phylogenetically 
quite distant from humans. However, when considered in the context of developmental needs 
of an altricial or semi-altricial animal, there are many parallels to be drawn between species 
that might lend important insight.

Indeed, for decades it has been appreciated that parental availability is a potent modulator of 
child emotional behaviors (in particular fear/anxiety). Across various scientific perspectives 
(including ethological/attachment theories, parenting styles, family systems; (Baumrind, 
1966; Bowen, 1966a; Bowlby, 1982; Gewirtz et al., 1958; Hofer, 1994a; Kernberg, 1972) 
researchers have noted the special relationship between parent and child and the regulatory 
influence this relationship has on children’s emotionality. For the last century, these effects 
have been documented and empirically tested at the behavioral level.

One of the most fundamental things that parents do to influence children’s emotionality is be 
physically close. Physical proximity of the parent signals to the child that the parent is 
available (either for physical or psychological assistance), which exerts profound (and 
sometimes inconspicuous) effects on children’s reactivity and emotional learning. Physical 
presence and availability of the parent increases children’s likelihood of entering a novel 
(Sorce & Emde, 1981) or threatening situation (e.g., new school), decreases nighttime fears 
(Simard, Nielsen, Tremblay, Boivin, & Montplaisir, 2008), inhibits acquisition of new fears 
(Egliston & Rapee, 2007) and buffers against elevations in stress hormones during childhood 
(Hostinar, Johnson, & Gunnar, 2015; Kertes et al., 2009). These effects are so strong that 
even availability of the parent through a phone call is effective (Seltzer, Prososki, Ziegler, & 
Pollak, 2012). Despite its critical function, the neural mechanisms of parental buffering 
effects on children’s emotional development have not yet been described.

Parental buffering of amygdala reactivity

Our laboratory has begun addressing the question of how parents influence emotional 
development by first considering the nature of the scanning environment during a typical 
MRI testing session. We noted that during scanning, children are not with their parents. 
Perhaps if we could provide access to a parental stimulus, amygdala function would change 
in a state-like manner during childhood. Specifically, we examined whether providing 
children and adolescents with some access to a parental stimulus would buffer against the 
high amygdala reactivity that is typically observed (Gee, Humphreys, et al., 2013). In 
rodents, empirical examination of the effects of parental (i.e., maternal) cues might come in 
the form of an odor cue (Sullivan – see this issue), which during a sensitive period in 
development acts to dampen amygdala engagement during fear learning. Odor is the primary 
sensory modality in developing rat, and thus an odor cue is a potent stimulus to represent the 
mother. For humans, the visual modality is a primary route for emotional information, and 
thus we provided pictures of a parent’s face to healthy children and adolescents during fMRI 
scanning. The contrasting conditioning involved presenting pictures of someone else’s 
parent (a stranger). The hypothesis that we tested was that availability of a parental cue 
would act to dampen amygdala reactivity. However, the effect would be developmentally 
transient such that the attenuating effect of the parental cue on amygdala reactivity would 
only be observed during childhood and not during adolescence. This hypothesis was 
generated by the developmentally unique phenotypes of the amygdala-mPFC circuit that has 
been observed across laboratories.

The results supported the buffering hypothesis, and indeed children showed lower amygdala 
response when presented with their own parent’s images (Gee et al., 2014). Adolescents did 
not show this effect and amygdala responding did not differ between their own parent and 
someone else’s. The dampening of amygdala response by the parental cue in children was 
noteworthy given the high amygdala response that is typically observed in children. A 
similar result has been documented in clinically anxious children and adolescence when 
their mothers were physically near them in the scanner (Conner et al., 2012). Although we 
observed this amygdala dampening across all children, the magnitude of the amygdala 
buffering effect was associated with attachment representations such that children whose 
amygdala decreased the most in response to a parental cue were more likely to report that 
they would tend to turn to their parent (as opposed to another individual) in times of duress. 
These findings suggest that the strength of amygdala buffering was associated with the 
strength of the parent-child relationship, but on average, all children showed some degree of 
buffering by parental stimuli. We interpreted this finding as being parallel to rodent studies 
showing a developmentally transient maternal buffering effect on amygdala engagement.

Functional connectivity analyses showed that presentation of a parental cue also 
strengthened (negative) correlations between the amygdala and the mPFC. This effect was 
specific to the parental cue and developmentally specific during childhood. The analysis 
used a voxel-wise approach, which means that the effect of the parent on amygdala 
connectivity was specific to the mPFC since other regions did not show parental modulation 
in amygdala connectivity. Examination of parental buffering effects on emotional behaviors 
of developing rhesus monkeys have shown that the mPFC is critical for the buffering effect

to occur (Rilling et al., 2001). If the amygdala dampening by parental cue was indeed 
evidence of parental buffering at the neural level, what we might have been observing in 
children during fMRI scanning is a phasic increase in top-down communication between the 
mPFC and amygdala caused by presentation of the parental cue.

We observed parental effects at the level of behavior as well (Gee et al., 2015). Out of the 
scanner, children and adolescents performed an emotional face go/nogo task (Tottenham, 
Hare, & Casey, 2011), which assesses behavioral-regulation under different affective 
conditions. Participants responded (via button press) as quickly as they could to facial 
stimuli (e.g., neutral faces) that were serially repeated to build up a prepotent tendency to 
respond. Infrequently, a negative (e.g., fear) or a positive (e.g., happy) face was presented. 
Prior to the task subjects were instructed to only press to the neutral faces. Thus, a button 
press to the emotional faces would be a false alarm error. False alarm error rate that was 
greater to fear faces than happy faces was interpreted as an error in affective behavior 
regulation (Johnson & Tottenham, 2015). Children and adolescents performed this task 
twice, once sitting next to their parent and once sitting next to a friendly female 
experimenter in counterbalanced order. Both the parent and the experimenter were instructed 
to not interact with the subject, but to busy themselves with paperwork. As anticipated, 
children performed worse on this measure than adolescents, but importantly, their false 
alarm rate for fear faces (i.e., their affective behavior regulation) improved significantly 
when seated next to their parents. Moreover, it improved most for children who showed the 
largest parental buffering effects on the amygdala during fMRI scanning. These brain-
behavior associations suggest to us that during childhood, the parent is effective in 
phasically modulating affective behavior by influencing amygdala-mPFC. When the parent 
is not available, amygdala activity increases, and when the parent becomes available again, 
amygdala activity decreases again. The difference between children and adolescents’ 
responding suggests that the window during which parents can exert these effects may close 
as children transition into adolescence.

Proposed Neurobiological Model of Parental Influence

Based on evidence from rodents, non-human primates, and human studies that include 
lesion, imaging, and endocrine methods, we reasonable evidence to begin building a 
neurobiological model of parental influence on emotional development. This model is in its 
earliest stages but is testable, and the predictions that it generates will allow for future 
modification.

Figure 4 illustrates the working model. During childhood, amygdala and associated 
emotional behaviors may be under direct control of parental availability. (NOTE: This 
control may extend downward into toddlerhood and infancy but the youngest ages tested 
with our fMRI data collection thus far has been 4-year-olds. However, the findings of 
amygdala hyperexcitability in children with a history of parental deprivation in infancy 
coupled with evidence of amygdala modulation by mother’s voice in sleeping infants 
(Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2010) would support the hypothesis that parents modulate 
amygdala development throughout early development). This responsiveness to the parent is 
the result of a proposed sensitive period prior to adolescence, including childhood (and

possibly earlier) and associated heightened plasticity of the amygdala and connections with 
the mPFC. During the sensitive period, routine parental availability and non-availability 
phasically influence amygdala and associated behaviors (green up and down arrows). The 
proposed mechanism involves interactions at the level of hormones, neural activity, and 
behavior. When the parent is temporarily unavailable, cortisol levels are elevated. This 
elevation will be associated with heightened amygdala reactivity to emotional events in the 
environment, which increases emotional reactivity at the level of behavior. However, when 
the parent becomes available, cortisol is buffered at the same time that connectivity between 
the mPFC and amygdala increases. Together, these two factors result in a decrease in 
amygdala reactivity and associated emotional reactivity. This phasic modulation is predicted 
to be important in the “toning” of the amygdala-mPFC circuit to respond independently at 
older ages, once the system becomes more stable. Note that the model allows for periodic 
parental absence (e.g., parents go to work and children go to school). In fact this cycle of 
presence and absence is key to the toning process, and may be akin to models of “stress 
inoculation” proposed by others (e.g., Parker, Buckmaster, Sundlass, Schatzberg, & Lyons, 
2006), where a bit of exposure to phasic stress is helpful for toning of the system in maturity. 
The opportunity for parental availability to influence this circuitry is hypothesized to end 
with the increasing independence from the parent in adolescence. At this point the circuitry 
will operate in a way that reflects the toning that occurred during childhood.

This working model provides one possible mechanism explaining individual differences in 
amygdala-mPFC functioning and emotional dysregulation in adults with a history of early 
caregiving adversity. As can be seen by the red arrow, we propose that parental neglect/
deprivation (and perhaps other forms of insecure parenting) may eliminate the opportunity 
for affect related neurobiology to be phasically modulated; thus, amygdala and emotional 
reactivity will not be routinely buffered and the system will stabilize in a way that results in 
emotional dysregulation.

This model is only a working model; it is yet incomplete, and there is much work to be done. 
For example, the model does not currently include infancy and toddlerhood. Surely parents 
provide significant scaffolding of affective neurobiology at these younger ages. The nature 
of the scaffolding might be similar to what the model proposes in childhood, in which case 
the proposed sensitive period would be extended down to infancy. Indeed, the effects of 
parental deprivation described in this paper were the results of deprivation experienced in 
infancy and toddlerhood. Alternatively, the effects may be different at very younger ages in 
which case the model would have to be significantly accommodated. Those data are difficult 
to obtain given the technical challenges of collecting fMRI data from awake infants and 
toddlers. Nonetheless, a testable working model can be useful for making future progress in 
characterizing the neurobiological mechanisms of emotional scaffolding by parents.

Conclusions

As discussed elsewhere (Tottenham, 2012, 2014) since the parent is external to the 
developing child yet so critical for the progression of normal emotional development, 
qualifies parental availability as a species-expected stimulus. Therefore, it seems necessary 
to appreciate brain development in the context of parental presence versus absence to

acquire a complete understanding of human amygdala-mPFC development. This manuscript 
began with a focus on amygdala-mPFC phenotypes of children and adolescents with a 
history of institutional caregiving, but the ramifications of parental influences extends 
beyond this group to many other individuals experiencing various forms of caregiving 
adversity. Moreover, understanding how parents scaffold affective neurobiology provides a 
fuller mechanistic understanding of brain development in all humans.

Figure 1. 
Amygdala-mPFC connectivity across children and adolescents as a function of early 
caregiving. Two independent groups of typically raised children exhibit positive correlations 
between amygdala and mPFC, which then switches for adolescents, who show a more adult-
like negative correlation. Children in the previously institutionalized group show a 
connectivity pattern that more closely resembles the adolescents. Adapted from Gee et al., 
2013.

Figure 4. 
Working model of parental influence on emotional development. Parents may have their 
largest effects in modulating amygdala activity and functional development prior to 
adolescence. Importantly, there is little data on amygdala functional reactivity in humans 
prior to early childhood; thus although the x-axis begins in childhood, we would predict that 
parental influence on amygdala development extends downward into infancy.
