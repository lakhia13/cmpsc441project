Controversies in psychiatry 

Florence Thibaut, MD, PhD – Editor in chief 

Abstract
Neuroimaging  and  recent  genetics  discoveries  have 
raised many questions regarding the current diagnostic 
criteria  of  psychiatric  diseases  and  the  current  classifi-
cations used, which are still based on subjective clinical 
assessment. Despite high-quality research in brain neu-
roscience and evidence-based guidelines in many psychi-
atric  diseases,  some  therapeutic  issues  are  still  a  matter 
of debate. These controversial issues will be discussed in 
this 20th anniversary issue.   

Keywords: biomarker; controversy; genetics; psychiatry; precision medicine

For  the  last  20  years,  the  journal  Dialogues  in  Clinical 
Neuroscience has devoted each issue to a specific topic 
using review articles that introduce, in a highly integrat-
ed manner, basic neuroscience to the dilemmas faced by 
clinicians in everyday practice. The journal celebrates its 
20th year of publication with this special issue on contro-
versies in psychiatry. 
  At  the  turn  of  the  19th  century,  the  science  of  psy-
chiatry really began to develop, and the way that society 
treated the mentally ill gradually changed. Outstanding 
clinical  descriptions  of  mental  diseases  were  published 
by  German  and  French  (neuro)psychiatrists  such  as 
Griesinger  and  Charcot.  Medical  doctors  and  scientists 
began to understand how the brain works, and thus start-
ed the slow progress of mental health treatment. How-
ever, the first major breakthrough in the development of 
effective psychiatric drugs came out in the 1950s by ser-
endipity. Yet,  the  introduction  of  effective  antipsychot-
ics for schizophrenia and mania, and antidepressants for 
depressive disorders, revolutionized the care of mentally 
ill patients and their outcome; many patients were finally 
able to live outside of the mental hospitals. From these 
discoveries, substantial progress was made in the under-

standing of the biological basis of psychosis and depres-
sive disorders. However, the lack of specificity of these 
medications revealed a certain degree of overlap among 
clinical classifications of these illnesses. Furthermore the 
discoveries in the neuroimaging and genetics fields add-
ed  an  additional  degree  of  confusion.  In  fact,  common 
genes were identified between schizophrenia, autism, bi-
polar disorders, and intellectual disability. A whole neu-
rodevelopmental spectrum of disorders was thus able to 
be identified. Altogether, these observations raised many 
questions  regarding  the  current  diagnostic  criteria  of 
psychiatric diseases and the current classifications used 
which are still based on subjective clinical assessment1,2 
(Carvajal, in this issue p 161; Crocq, in this issue p 155).

In  contrast  to  many  somatic  diseases  which  already 
have implemented biomarkers, in psychiatry, we continue 
to build on subjective clinical assessment of clinical symp-
toms and syndromes. We need to develop biomarkers that 
can be measured objectively and evaluated as indicators of 
normal or pathological processes with a high level of sen-
sitivity and specificity3-6 (Hoehe and Morris-Rosendhal, in 
this issue p 169). These biomarkers should also be easy to 
use and consistent across studies. They could be used for 
both early and differential diagnosis, personalized predic-
tion of treatment response, and/or side effects. In precision 
or personalized medicine, the focus is on identifying which 
approaches will be effective for which patients based on 
genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Noninvasive 
neuroimaging  is  a  key  area  for  biomarker  development 
because it connects behavioral outcomes with structural, 
functional, and molecular mechanisms7 (Falkai et al, in this 
issue, p 179). Pharmacogenomics combines pharmacology 
and genomics to develop effective, safe medications and 
doses that are tailored to variations in a person’s genetic 
background (Hoehe and Morris-Rosendhal, in this issue 
p  169).  Furthermore,  integrating  genomics,  epigenomics, 
transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics combined 
with neuroimaging may contribute to the identification of 
the  pathways  contributing  to  mental  disorders,  enabling 
a  precision  medicine  approach  to  the  treatment  of  indi-
vidual patients.7,8 However, despite high-quality research 
in  brain  neuroscience  and  evidence-based  guidelines  in 
many  psychiatric  diseases,  nonconventional  approaches 
remain  in  the  present  practice  of  psychiatry  and  will  be 
discussed  in  this  issue  (Schulz  and  Hede,  in  this  issue, 
p 207). Finally, therapeutic issues regarding the use of an-
tidepressants in minor depression or the length of main-

tenance antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia remain 
a matter of discussion (Naber and Bullinger, in this issue, 
p 223; Davidson, in this issue, p 215). o
