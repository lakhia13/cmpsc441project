Background: When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the 
spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Extended periods of isolation have detrimental effects on an individual’s mental 
health. Therefore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should include assessment of psychological distress and 
its known risk factors, including coping style and emotional regulation. 
Methods: This cross-sectional study surveyed 6,027 Chinese university students recruited from May 25, 2020 to 
June 10, 2020. In addition to sociodemographic information, participant data were collected using online ver-
sions of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), 
and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). 
Results: The incidence of psychological distress was found to be 35.34%. Negative coping style and expressing 
panic about COVID-19 on social media were the most important predictors of psychological distress. In addition, 
being male, being a “left-behind child” or having a monthly household income lower than 5000 CNY or higher 
than 20,000 CNY were associated with higher psychological distress. 
Conclusion:  The  psychological  consequences  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  could  be  serious.  Psychological  in-
terventions that reduce nervousness and negative coping style need to be made available to home-quarantined 
university students, especially those who are male, are “left-behind”, have a monthly household income lower 
than 5000 CNY or higher than 20,000 CNY, or express panic on social media.   

1. Introduction 

The  novel  coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-2)  causes  coronavirus  disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (Tang et al., 2020a, 2020b). There was a 
rapid  surge  in  the  number  of  COVID-19  cases  during  March  2020, 
particularly  in  Iran, Italy, South  Korea, and the  United  States (Elsous 
et al., 2020; Asokan et al., 2020). Previous studies have reported that 
psychological problems can occur during pandemics (Chen et al., 2006; 
Main  et  al.,  2011;  Salomon  et  al.,  2021).  In  fact,  the  increasing  and 
continuous threat of the pandemic led to a global atmosphere of psy-
chological distress (PD), partially due to disrupted travel plans, social 
isolation,  media  information  overload,  and  panic  buying  of  necessity 
goods (Purtle, 2020; Pimenta et al., 2020; Bagus et al., 2021). 

As  the  pandemic  persists,  the  general  population  experiences 
different levels of PD, such as nervousness, fear of infection, anxiety, and 
depression (Duan and Zhu, 2020;Feinstein et al., 2020; Valenzano et al., 

2021). PD is strongly associated with psychological disorders, which can 
significantly reduce the quality of life and is a risk factor for physical 
health problems, such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (McLachlan and Gale, 2018). Therefore, 
governments and public health authorities urgently need guidance and 
actionable  information on  effective  public  physical and  psychological 
health  interventions  that  can  safeguard  the  general  public.  Recent 
mental health studies on COVID-19 have focused on health professionals 
or  a  particular  age  group,  or  have  not  analyzed  the  data  in-depth  to 
identify risk or protective factors for mental health. 

Coping  styles  may  have  a  strong  effect  on  mental  health  in  un-
dergraduates (Anahita, 2008). Effective coping strategies might protect 
individuals  from  developing  PD  when  they  experience  stressors, 
whereas inappropriate coping styles can lead to a perception of personal 
failure  and  distress  (Gurvich  et  al.,  2021).  In  a  longitudinal  study  of 
undergraduates,  maladaptive  coping  styles  were  associated  with

increased PD following negative events (Cui et al., 2019). Problematic 
coping strategies, such as giving up in order to avoid a potential failure, 
may prevent a student from seeking help from family, friends, or pro-
fessional services. Few studies have explored relationships between PD 
and different coping styles among Chinese undergraduates. 

In  addition  to  coping  style,  emotion  regulation  may  also  play  an 
important role in PD among undergraduates, serving as a mediator be-
tween stress and psychological problems (Kashdan and Farmer, 2014). 
Effective emotion regulation was shown to help protect perfectionists 
from  experiencing  PD  (Beblo  et  al.,  2012).  A  useful  instrument  for 
assessing  emotion  regulation,  particularly  in  the  Chinese  cultural 
context, is the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) (Gross, 1988). 
The  ERQ  has  been  widely  applied  in  many  PD  studies  (Aldao  et  al., 
2014). This instrument comprises two subscales: cognitive reappraisal, 
which  is  an  attempt  to  reframe  a  situation  in  a  way  that  changes  its 
meaning and emotional impact; and expressive suppression, which is an 
attempt  to  inhibit  or  reduce  ongoing  emotion-expressive  behavior. 
Cognitive reappraisal has been shown to strengthen the experience of 
positive emotion, which may help prevent distress in the general pop-
ulation  (Taylor  and  Heimberg,  2018).  On  the  other  hand,  expressive 
suppression has been shown to heighten the felt intensity of negative 
emotion,  which  may  significantly  increase  PD  (Gross  and  Jazaieri, 
2014). This discrepancy highlights the need for further analysis of how 
the two subtypes of emotion regulation are associated with PD in Chi-
nese undergraduate students. 

To evaluate mental health status during the initial outbreak and peak 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify risk and protective factors of 
the resulting PD, we recruited university students upon their return from 
home quarantine. In this study, we explored the relationship of PD with 
coping  style,  emotion  regulation,  and  COVID-19  exposure.  We  also 
assessed whether COVID-19 exposure, coping style, or emotion regula-
tion predicted PD. We attempt to provide a reference to help identify 
students who have high levels of PD and enable early intervention. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Participants and procedure 

This  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  using  convenience  sam-
pling in one university in Chengdu between May 25, 2020 and June 10, 
2020. Approximately 30 classes from each university year with between 
40 and 70 students each were selected. In total, 8000 students from 120 
classes  across  four  university  years  were  invited  to  participate  in  the 
survey. Of the 8000 students, 6079 completed the survey. However, 52 
were eliminated because of illogical answers, such as all choices being 
one or zero. In the end, 6027 completed surveys were used for analysis, 
corresponding  to  a  response  rate  of  75.3%.  All  surveys  were  de- 
identified, and all participants provided consent for their anonymized 
data to be analyzed and published for research purposes. All procedures 
complied with the ethical standards of the Research Ethics Committee of 
the Chengdu Normal University. 

were:  “Did  you  feel  …(1)  tired  out  for  no  good  reasons?”,  …(2)  ner-
vous?”,  …(3)  so  nervous  that  nothing  could  calm  you  down?”,  …(4) 
hopeless?”, …(5) restless or fidgety?”, …(6) so restless that you could 
not sit still?”, …(7) depressed?”, …(8) that everything was an effort?”, 
…(9) so sad that nothing could cheer you up?” and …(10) worthless?” 
Each item was scored on a five-point Likert scale (1 = none of the time, 2 
= a little of the time, 3 = some of the time, 4 = most of the time, and 5 =
all of the time). The total possible score of the K10 ranges from 10 (no 
distress) to 50 (severe distress). A participant with a total score of 10–19 
is likely to be well, 20–24 is likely to have a mild disorder, 25–29 is likely 
to have a moderate disorder, and 30–50 is likely to have a severe dis-
order (Fuller-Thomson et al., 2020). Studies have shown that the K10 is 
psychometrically valid and appropriate for use in indigenous and gen-
eral populations in Ghana (Anderson et al., 2013; Vasiliadis et al., 2015). 
A  total  score≥25  indicates  moderate  to  serious  psychological  distress 
(Fuller-Thomson et al., 2020). 

2.2.2. Coping style 

The Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) is a 20-item self- 
report scale that measures individual coping style (Ye et al., 2017). The 
SCSQ  is  divided  into  two  subscales:  positive  coping  (12  items)  and 
negative  coping  (8  items).  Positive  coping  reflects  the  level  of  active 
coping style, such as “when facing problems, find several different so-
lutions” or “look at the good side of things”. In contrast, negative coping 
reflects the level of passive coping style, such as “when facing problems, 
escape  troubles by  drinking and  smoking”  or  “imagine a  miracle will 
come,  and  the  problem  will  be  solved”.  Each  item  is  scored  on  a 
four-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = often, and 3 = al-
ways). The total possible score of the positive coping subscale ranges 
from 0 to 36, and the total possible score of the negative coping subscale 
ranges from 0 to 24. Higher scores on each subscale reflect higher levels 
of the indicated coping style. Cronbach’s α for positive coping (0.89) and 
negative coping (0.78) demonstrate high reliability in Chinese popula-
tion (Adbollahi and Carbring, 2017; Lin et al., 2020). 

2.2.3. Emotional regulation strategies 

The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ, Aldao et al., 2010) is a 
10-item  self-report  measure  of  two  emotion  regulation  strategies: 
cognitive  reappraisal  (6  items)  and  expressive  suppression  (4  items). 
Sample items for the ERQ are “When I want to feel less negative emotion 
(such as sadness or anger), I change what I am thinking about” for the 
cognitive  reappraisal  dimension  and  “I  control  my  emotions  by  not 
expressing them” for the expressive suppression dimension. Each item is 
rated on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = neutral, 
and  7  = strongly  agree).  The  total  possible  score  for  cognitive  reap-
praisal ranges from 6 to 42, and the total possible score for expressive 
suppression  ranges  from  4  to  28.  The  Italian  version  of  the  ERQ  has 
shown good reliability and validity (O’Mahen et al., 2015). The ERQ had 
an internal consistency of 0.78 and 0.80 for cognitive reappraisal and 
0.72 and 0.78 for emotional suppression in samples that were or were 
not obese, respectively (Fucito et al., 2010). 

2.2. Measures 

2.3. Statistical analysis 

Sociodemographic data were collected from each participant, who 
self-reported sex, university year (1–4), their families’ monthly house-
hold  income,  and  whether  they  were  “left  behind”  by  parents  who 
moved to a city for better work. PD, coping style, and emotional regu-
lation were measured with the published scales described below. 

2.2.1. Psychological distress (PD) 

The  10-item  Kessler  Psychological  Distress  Scale  (K10)  was  devel-
oped as a screening tool for PD in the general population, and we used it 
to assess non-specific PD in students. It is composed of items measuring 
psychological  and  physiological  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression 
within the previous four weeks (Kessler et al., 2003). The items included 

Data were summarized with descriptive statistics. one-way analysis 
of  variance  (ANOVA)  or  t-tests  was  used  to  examine  the  associations 
between the categorical variables. Multiple linear regression was per-
formed  to  identify  predictors  of  PD.  All  statistical  analysis  was  per-
formed  using SPSS  25.0 (IBM,  Chicago, IL,  USA).  A p-value  less  than 
0.01 was considered significant. 

3. Results 

Sociodemographic characteristics of the 6027 respondents are sum-
marized  in  Table  1.  The  sample  population  was  slightly  more  female 
than  the  general  population,  with  3518  (58.4%)  female  and  2509

(41.6%) male. Approximately half of the respondents (57.54%) were left 
behind in rural areas to be cared for by other family members while their 
parents sought work in a nearby city. The monthly household income of 
52.85% of the respondents was lower than 5000 yuan (CNY; 1 CNY =
0.15 USD). We also surveyed students about their behavior and exposure 
to COVID-19 media coverage. Most students (65%) spent less than one 
hour each week focused on COVID-19, but 30.8% focused on COVID-19 
for one to two hours. Only 9% expressed panic about COVID-19 on social 
media,  and  94.5%  of  respondents  indicated  that  their  cohabitants 
worried about the disease less than half of the time. Student responses 
were  more  evenly  distributed  when  students  were  asked  about  their 
level  of  worry  about  infection,  either  for  themselves  or  for  family 
members. Only 6.7% of respondents knew a member of their community 
who had been infected. 

Mean scores of coping style subscales (positive coping and negative 
coping),  emotion  regulation  subscales  (cognitive  reappraisal  and 
expressive suppression), and PD are shown in Table 2. The percentage of 
respondents in each PD category was also reported, with 35.34% likely 
suffering from a moderate or severe mental disorder. Table 3 summa-
rizes the interactions between the subscales and each sociodemographic 
characteristic  from  Table  1.  Female  students  showed  a  significantly 
higher  positive  coping  style  than  male  students  (22.76  vs  21.42,  p  <
0.001). Females also demonstrated significantly better emotion regula-
tion than males, with higher cognitive reappraisal (31.26 vs 30.21, p <
0.001) and lower expressive suppression (15.42 vs 17.21, p < 0.001).

Unsurprisingly, male students had a higher average PD score than fe-
male students (22.17 vs 20.81, p < 0.001). There were no significant 
differences in any psychological metric across the four university years. 
Compared with students that lived with their parents, the left-behind 
students had a significantly lower positive coping style score (21.86 vs 
22.67, p < 0.001) and cognitive reappraisal score (30.65 vs 31.06, p =
0.005 < 0.01). They also showed higher PD scores than students that 
were not left behind (21.93 vs 20.62, p < 0.001). There were significant 
differences in PD scores among various household incomes (p < 0.001). 
Students whose family monthly income was lower than 5000 CNY or 
higher than 20,000 CNY had a higher average PD score. 

The length of time focused on COVID-19 was positively associated 
with positive coping style scores (p < 0.001); however, it was not found 
to be associated with PD scores (p = 0.044). Compared with students 
who did not report expressing panic about COVID-19 on social media, 
those who did had a higher negative coping style score (10.72 vs 9.31, p 
< 0.001), lower cognitive reappraisal (30.01 vs 30.9, p = 0.001), and 
higher PD scores (25.81 vs 20.94, p < 0.001). People who reported more 
worry about themselves or family being infected had higher PD scores 
(24.37 vs 22.08 vs 20.90 vs 20.72, 23.45 vs 21.52 vs 20.39 vs 20.39, p <
0.001).  In  addition,  students  who  had  more  nervous  cohabitants  also 
had  higher  negative  coping  style  scores  (23.35  vs  22.16  vs  21.55  vs 
21.18, p < 0.001), lower cognitive reappraisal scores (28.38 vs 30.02 vs 
30.64 vs 31.2, p < 0.001), and higher PD scores (27.55 vs 25.02 vs 22.15 
vs  19.82,  p  < 0.001).  Respondents  who  knew  someone  infected  with 
COVID-19 in their community had higher PD scores (23.01 vs 21.26, p <
0.001). 

Table 4 presents results from multiple linear regression analysis to 
identify predictors for PD. The regression model indicated that negative 
coping  style  was  the  most  significant  predictor  for  PD,  followed  by 
expressive  suppression,  cognitive  reappraisal,  positive  coping  style, 
expressing  panic  about  COVID-19  on  social  media,  cohabitants  being 
nervous  about  COVID-19,  worry  about  family  contracting  COVID-19, 
and being left behind. In contrast, sex, household income, worry about 
oneself contracting COVID-19, or knowing someone with COVID-19 in 
the community did not predict PD. 

4. Discussion 

We  conducted  a  survey  of  6027  Chinese  university  students  to 
explore sociodemographic variables and certain psychological metrics 
as potential risk factors of PD after the COVID-19 outbreak. We observed 
that male sex, being left behind, and a monthly household income lower 
than 5000 CNY or higher than 20,000 CNY were associated with higher 
PD in our sample. However, of these, only being left behind was pre-
dictive  of  PD.  Among  pandemic-specific  variables,  expressing  panic 
about COVID-19 on social media was the most important predictor of 
PD. The second most important predictor of PD was having cohabitants 
who  were  nervous  about  COVID-19.  In  addition  to  these  factors,

worrying  about  oneself  or  one’s  family  contracting  COVID-19  or 
knowing  someone  in  the  community  with  COVID-19  were  associated 
with higher PD. All of our measured psychological metrics were more 
important predictors of PD than any sociodemographic metric. We also 
explored the interactions between sociodemographic characteristics and 
each  psychological  measure.  Our  findings  are  contextualized  in  the 
following sections. 

4.1. The effects of sociodemographic factors on PD 

About 35.34% of the students in our sample have moderate to serious 
psychological  distress.  Considering  many  previous  reports  about  psy-
chologic status during the COVID-19 pandemic were scored by K6 or 
K10,  it  is  necessary  to  compare  the  PD  prevalence  results  with  these 
studies. The PD prevalence in this study was much lower than a sample 
of 993 adults from Eswatini using K6 (Shongwe and Huang, 2021) and a 
sample of 553 medical students from Jordan using K10 (Seetan et al., 
2021), who had a PD rate of 47.1% and 50.3%, respectively. In Shongwe 
and Huang’s study, desperate need for food and concerns about the loss 
of business were associated with the increased of PD prevalence, which 
was different with our sample, who were protected by their families and 
did not need to deal with these problems. Medical students in Seetan 
et al.’s study faced higher exposure risk and were more vulnerable than 
the  general  population. The prevalence  of our  sample was  also  much 
lower  than  a  sample  of 11,333  Japanese  using  the  K6 version  of  this 
scale  (Yamamoto  et  al.,  2020),  who  had  a  PD  rate  of  48.1%.  Many 
participants in Yamamoto et al.’s study were healthcare workers or had 
a history of treatment for mental illness, which was risk factor for higher 
PD (Alqutub et al., 2021). The prevalence of PD in our study was com-
parable to a sample of 12,989 Welsh persons using the same screening 
scale (Gray et al., 2020), who had a PD rate of 36.9%. However, the PD 
prevalence of this study was much higher than a sample of 1293 British 
using K6 (Goodwin et al., 2021) and a sample of 3389 New Zealanders 
using K10 (Bell et al., 2021), who had a PD rate of 16.5% and 23.13%, 
respectively. In comparison to the 22.8% prevalence found in a sample 
of 1588 general Chinese people, the PD rate of our study was also greatly 
higher  (Yu  et  al.,  2020).  Unlike  these  studies,  many  students  in  our 

sample were left behind and faced poverty, and these were associated 
with the increased of PD prevalence (Racine et al., 2020). 

In  a  word, the  psychological  distress  of the  population  during  the 
COVID-19 pandemic was not optimistic, and the screening scale (K6 or 
K10)  does  not  significantly  impact  PD  prevalence.  Discrepancies  of 
prevalence in the above-mentioned studies could be due to the age range 
(Horiuchi  et  al.,  2020)  and  exposure  risk  (Seetan  et  al.,  2021).  For 
example, this study has interviewed young subjects in a small age range 
who had poor health risks related to COVID-19 infection (Bagus et al., 
2021). Compared with children and old people, the pandemic-related 
psychological distress for young subjects was limited (Horiuchi et al., 
2020; Gong et al., 2021). Then, the extent of the lockdown (Bell et al., 
2021), pre-existing depressive disorders (Yamamoto et al., 2020), and 
food insecurity (Serafini et al., 2021) have been proved to significantly 
impact  the  PD  prevalence.  Furthermore,  the  stage  of  the  pandemic 
(Goodwin et al., 2021), the data collection periods (Yu et al., 2020), and 
the  country’s  response  to  the  pandemic  (Shongwe  and  Huang,  2021) 
also could be important reasons for the different PD prevalence. 

We found that male students had higher average PD scores than fe-
male students. This significant sex difference is inconsistent with pre-
vious research results, which showed higher PD in females (Eisenberg 
et  al.,  2007;  Zhang  et  al.,  2018).  This  discrepancy  may  be  caused  by 
differences in coping styles and emotion regulation strategies employed 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Previous  studies  have  shown  that 
populations with negative coping styles have higher levels of PD (Eaton 
et  al.,  2012).  Similarly,  a  more  positive  coping  style  may  promote 
emotional well-being (Wright et al., 2010). Our results showed that male 
students  were  more  likely  to  use  negative  coping  styles.  In  addition, 
cognitive reappraisal can offset the accumulation of negative emotions, 
perhaps reducing depression (Fredrickson and Joiner, 2002). Expression 
suppression,  which  masks  an  individual’s  feelings  and  limits  their 
external expressions of emotions, may negatively impact psychological 
adaptability (Hong et al., 2018). Our results showed that our male stu-
dents used less cognitive reappraisal and more expressive suppression 
than female students, which may explain their higher PD. 

Being  left  behind  is  a  risk  factor  of  PD,  which  is  consistent  with 
previous studies (Su et al., 2013). In China, many younger adults and 
couples migrate from rural areas or smaller cities to larger cities to find 
better-paying  work,  leaving  their  children  behind  to  be  cared  for  by 
relatives  or  community  members.  According  to  the  ecological  system 
theory  of  human  development,  the  family  has  significant  effects  on 
adolescent  development.  Specifically,  lack  of  financial  and  emotional 
support from parents leads to social anxiety (Ren and Li, 2020). Families 
play  a  major  role  in  helping  children  cope  with  trauma,  so  parental 
absence during childhood may contribute to the development of somatic 
or panic symptoms (Tang et al., 2020a, 2020b). Without their parents to 
protect them, students who are left behind can feel hopeless and lonely, 
which  increases  their  risk  of  PD  (Jia  and  Tian,  2010).  Further,  the 
reduced parental support also increases the likelihood of problems such 
as low self-esteem (Amato, 1993), which is one of the most powerful 
clinical predictors of PD. It is also possible that being left behind may 
increase negative life events for children, which may have a cumulative 
effect on an individual’s mental health in adulthood (Li et al., 2020). 

The students whose family monthly income is lower than 5000 CNY 
or higher than 20,000 CNY show higher PD, which is consistent with the 
findings  reported  in  previous  studies  (Shafiee  et  al.,  2021;  McQuaid 
et al., 2020). For the students whose family monthly income is lower 
than 5000 CNY, it is more likely that they lacked care and support from 
their  families,  instead  requiring  they  often  deal  with  difficulties  and 
pressure by themselves. They are also less likely to participate in group 
activities  because  of  the  additional  expenditure,  which  reduces  their 
avenues for making friends. Further, they are more likely to be sensitive 
and introverted, and therefore, less likely to express their emotions or 
needs. High income has been shown to be associated with elevated stress 
at work (Chamik et al., 2017). Therefore, the 2.31% of students whose 
family monthly income is higher than 20,000 CNY have parents who are

more anxious, which may increase their own stress. They may receive 
less emotional care from their parents because their parents are busier 
than the general people. In addition, their parents are considered highly 
successful,  which  may  place  extra  pressure  on  them  to  be  more 
hard-working.  In  fact,  it  is  likely  that  above  a  certain  level  of  stable 
income, individuals’  emotional well-being is constrained by other fac-
tors in their temperament and life circumstances (Kahneman and Dea-
ton, 2010). 

Among COVID-19-related factors, expressing panic about COVID-19 
on  social  media  was  the  most  important  predictor  of  PD.  During  the 
COVID-19  pandemic,  students  use  social  media  to  continue  their 
learning virtually, as well as to communicate with friends and to obtain 
more information about the pandemic. Thus, social media plays a major 
role in rapidly spreading panic about the COVID-19 pandemic among 
students (Radwan et al., 2020). The unavoidable media coverage and 
constant  exposure  to  negative  information  relating  to  this  pandemic, 
including an increase in cases and deaths, is likely to negatively affect 
respondents’ mental health (Smith et al., 2020; Bagus et al., 2021). The 
second most important predictor of PD was the belief that cohabitants 
were  nervous  about  COVID-19.  A  previous  study  showed  that  in-
dividuals might be consciously or unconsciously influenced by others’ 
emotions (Hatfield et al., 1993). An individual can transmit his or her 
nervousness (Valenzano et al., 2021), which would likely happen often 
with  cohabitants, given  their proximity. Worries  about family getting 
infected also increased the risk of PD in our sample (Fu et al., 2020). The 
severity and infectivity of the virus, the prospect of being quarantined 
alone, the many unknowns around how to manage and treat the disease, 
as  well  as  the  strict  pandemic  control  measures  were  all  factors  that 
likely contribute to stress, and therefore, PD. 

4.2. The effects of coping style and emotion regulation on PD 

We found that a negative coping style was the most important factor 
to predict PD in our sample, and that a positive coping style was asso-
ciated  with  significantly  lower  risk  of  PD.  In  previous  research,  the 
population with negative coping styles showed higher levels of PD than 
people  who  use  positive  coping  mechanisms  (Wright  et  al.,  2010). 
Negative coping styles usually make people doubt and deny themselves, 
which leads to increased anxiety and stress. Conversely, people who use 
positive coping styles prefer to believe that the problem will be solved in 
the  end,  which  allows  them  to  focus on  finding  the  best  method  (Du 
et al., 2018). In other words, having a positive coping style improves 
one’s probability of success (Wang et al., 2007). Students with positive 
coping  styles  find  it  easier  to  develop  an  appreciation  of  life,  likely 
because  that  positivity  stimulates  self-growth  (Guo  et  al.,  2017). 
Further, those who have a positive coping style may depend more on 
themselves and depend less on their relationships with others, while a 
negative coping style promotes the opposite (Wang et al., 2013). 

As  for  emotion  regulation,  cognitive  reappraisal  was  inversely 
correlated with PD, and expressive suppression was positively correlated 
with PD in our sample. Previous research indicated that more frequent 
cognitive reappraisal is significantly associated with higher levels of life 
satisfaction, self-esteem, optimism, and environmental mastery, while 
expressive  suppression  has  long-term  negative  effects  on  life  satisfac-
tion, self-esteem, and well-being (Brewer et al., 2016; Haga et al., 2009). 
Peers of individuals who perform cognitive reappraisal more frequently 
report closer connection and greater self-liking (Gross and John, 2003). 
Conversely, individuals who use expressive suppression more frequently 
report receiving less social and emotional support from their peers, and 
their peers report feeling less close to them. In addition, individuals who 
perform cognitive reappraisal more frequently may feel more confident 
in  their ability  to  regulate  their  emotions  and,  subsequently,  more in 
control  of  their  lives  (Taylor  and  Heimberg,  2018).  Expressive  sup-
pression,  which  heightens  the  felt  intensity  of  negative  emotion  and 
dampens  the  experience  of  positive  emotion,  may  negatively  impact 
mental  health  in  the  long  term  (Hong  et  al.,  2018).  Thus,  it  is  not 

surprising  that  students  who  perform  cognitive  reappraisal  more 
frequently are more likely to have a higher mental health status, and 
those  who  use  expressive  suppression  are  at  increased  risk  of  mental 
illness. 

5. Limitations 

Although the present study has introduced unique contributions to 
the field with regard to the relationships among coping style, emotion 
regulation, and PD in the university after the COVID-19 outbreak, some 
limitations  should  be  noted.  First,  since  this  is  the  first  time  that  re-
lationships among coping style, emotion regulation, and PD have been 
assessed, replication will be necessary to confirm our findings. Second, 
only coping style and emotion regulation strategies were examined in 
the present study. Subsequent studies should involve more psychologi-
cal  measures,  such  as  emotional  intelligence,  social  support,  and  the 
Fear of COVID scale. Third, the study population was limited to Chinese 
university  students  at  one  school.  Samples  involving  people  of  all 
occupational  groups  and  nationalities  should  be  recruited  in  further 
studies. Fourth, the study has interviewed young subjects in a small age 
range. In fact, the benefit of the severe countermeasures to COVID-19 
seems minimal in this age range compared to the old subjects, so our 
opinion was influenced by this situation. Further researches focused on 
this bias among larger age ranges would be important. This was a cross- 
sectional study, so future work could also include longitudinal assess-
ment of PD in a specific population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 

6. Conclusion 

In this study after the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that Chinese 
university students who were male, were left behind, or had a monthly 
household income lower than 5000 CNY or higher than 20,000 CNY had 
higher PD scores. We identified that expressing panic about COVID-19 
on  social  media  was  the  most  important  pandemic-related  factor  to 
predict  PD  in  this  population.  Negative  coping  style  and  expressive 
suppression were two of the most important factors overall to predict 
PD.  The  results  of  this  study  could  assist  healthcare  professionals  in 
identifying university students at elevated risk of mental health prob-
lems so that they can be targeted for appropriate interventions. Specif-
ically, universities should focus more attention on students who are left 
behind,  worry  about  family  members  being  infected  by  SARS-CoV-2, 
live with others who are often nervous about COVID-19, express panic 
about  COVID-19  on  social  media,  utilize  negative  coping  strategies, 
frequently suppress their emotions, or do not reframe situations. Extra 
attention should also be given to students who are male, have a monthly 
household income lower than 5000 CNY or higher than 20,000 CNY, 
worry  about  becoming  infected  with  SARS-CoV-2,  or  know  someone 
infected with COVID-19. Some of these factors are more easily ascer-
tained than others, and together they can help identify students more 
likely  to  be  affected  by  PD  since  the  COVID-19  outbreak.  Long-term 
psychological services should be provided for all students, and special 
efforts  should  be  made  to  reach  out  to  these  especially  vulnerable 
populations.
