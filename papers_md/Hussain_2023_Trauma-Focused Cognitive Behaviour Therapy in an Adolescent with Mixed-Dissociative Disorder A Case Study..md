Dissociation is a psychopathological condition with a range of alterations or changes in the normally integrated mental functions
such as identity, consciousness, or memory and can manifest in various types such as depersonalization, trance states,
derealisation, dissociative amnesia, and dissociative identity disorder (Waller et al., 1996). From an etiological perspective, past
experience of trauma plays a major role as a precipitating factor in dissociation, wherein dissociation is conceptualized as a
reaction to trauma as a way to distance oneself from the traumatic situation and events related to it (Lanius et al., 2015).
Initially understood as a coping mechanism, the persistent manifestation of dissociation hinders the overall psychological
functioning and interferes with the daily activities of the individual. Therefore, the focus of the various treatment modalities of
dissociative disorders is mostly focused on enhancing the coping skills of the patient. The current case study demonstrates the
manifestation of dissociation in a 16 years old adolescent with a history of trauma. Furthermore, it documents the eﬃcacy of
Trauma-Focused Cognitive Statistical Manual of Mental (Cohen et al., 2017).

1. Background

Dissociation is a psychopathological condition with a range
of alterations or changes in the normally integrated mental
functions such as identity, consciousness, or memory and
can manifest in various types such as depersonalization,
trance states, derealisation, dissociative amnesia, and disso-
ciative identity disorder [1]. The latest Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders-ﬁfth edition (DSM-5)
describes dissociative disorders as broadly involving impair-
ments in the integration of all of the following: consciousness,
memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation,
motor control, and behaviour.

Dissociative disorders are rare in children, but conver-
sion disorders account for the majority of them, especially
in developing countries [2]. Studies have shown that disso-
ciative disorders have a complex relationship with the
patients’ body, mind, and sociocultural environment [3],
and those stressful life events, traumas, and adjustment dif-
ﬁculties have a positive association with subsequent dissocia-
tive and conversion symptoms in children.

From an etiological perspective, past experience of trauma
plays a major role as a precipitating factor in dissociation,
wherein dissociation is conceptualized as a reaction to trauma
as a way to distance oneself from the traumatic situation and
events related to it [4]. Initially understood as a coping mech-
anism, the persistent manifestation of dissociation hinders the
overall psychological functioning and interferes with the daily
activities of the individual. Therefore, the focus of the various
treatment modalities of dissociative disorders is mostly
focused on enhancing the coping skills of
the patient.
Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT) is
an evidence-based treatment approach shown to help chil-
dren, adolescents, and their parents (or other caregivers) over-
come trauma-related diﬃculties. It is designed to reduce
negative emotional and behavioural responses following
trauma, including child sexual abuse and other maltreatment,
domestic violence, traumatic loss, mass disasters, multiple
traumas, and other traumatic events.

The treatment addresses distorted or upsetting beliefs
and attributions related to the traumas and provide a sup-
portive environment in which children are encouraged to

talk about their traumatic experiences and learn skills to help
them cope with ordinary life stressors. The current case
study demonstrates the manifestation of dissociation in a
16 years adolescent with a history of trauma. Furthermore,
it documents the eﬃcacy of Trauma-Focused Cognitive
Behaviour Therapy (TF-CBT) in dissociation [5].

2. Case Report

Index patient, a 16 years old adolescent boy, belonging to
Hindu nuclear family from a lower socioeconomic strata,
hailing from rural Bihar was admitted in the inpatient
Department of Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi.
The adolescent was maintaining well and would go to
school regularly until about four months ago when, one
day his cousin brother who was around one year older
than him passed away by drowning in a river nearby his
village, where he had gone to take bath. The adolescent
was extremely shocked and traumatized when he came
to know about this incident. He shared a close emotional
bond with his cousin and would spend most of his time
at school as well as home with his cousin brother. Accord-
ing to the adolescent, his deceased brother was like a
father ﬁgure for him, who would always standby him in
his good and bad times and would always save him from
bullies in school.

The dead body of deceased brother was found two days
later and the patient had a glimpse of the body, which left
him completely shattered. The family members further
observed a change in his behaviour; he would remain
upset, stay alone, and would not talk to anybody in the fol-
lowing days.

The adolescent reportedly would have diﬃculty falling
sleep and would stay awake and keep thinking about his
deceased brother. When he would fall asleep, he would have
nightmares causing him to wake up in a fearful state.

The adolescent resumed his schooling after a week and
took the bus to his school. However, the family members
received complaints about his behaviour as he would stay
alone, not talk to anybody, and would not respond to his
teachers either. Within few days, the adolescent experienced
the ﬁrst episode of dissociative amnesia, when one day he
left his class without informing anyone and reached his
aunt’s place nearby his school. He would not speak to his
aunt for hours. His parents were called and the patient was
taken home. Later, upon inquiry, he could not recall any-
thing about this journey to his aunt’s place.

The adolescent experienced the second episode of disso-
ciation, two days after this incident, the adolescent was
studying inside his room, when his mother called him for
some work, he was not present in the room and was not
present around the home either. Hours after this, the family
members received a call from a person who informed them
about the adolescent. When the family members found
him, he again reported being unable to recall the incident
and further complained of dizziness and headache. He
would also refuse to go to school and state that he cannot
concentrate on his studies and that the image of deceased
brother comes into his mind.

The adolescent had similar episodes 2-3 times in the
week, whereby he would walk alone for distance of 1-2 kms
and then suddenly ask people nearby about his own where-
abouts. In one such incident, it was reported that the adoles-
cent was walking with the mother to a market nearby. The
mother noticed that after sometime, the adolescent walked
by himself and did not respond to the mother and would
not speak to anybody. His mother kept following him for
2-3 kms and suddenly the adolescent stopped and started
asking the mother how he reached here or what are they
doing here.

The family members were concerned about the deterio-
rating state of the patient. Eventually, they took him to a
faith healer, who saw him and told them that he is being tar-
geted by some evil spirit and asked them to perform rituals
and did some religious spells. This further triggered a sense
of fear in the adolescent, as he would say he is scared that
something might happen to him.

In the following days, condition worsened as he would
run away from home almost 3-4 times in a day without
any recall. He also started having episodes where he would
fall and lie down on the ground without any response and
have jerky movements characterized by head shaking with-
out any symptom of up rolling of eyes or tongue biting
with his eyes tightly closed, that would last for a minute
and occur every day. According to the mother,
in one
such incident, the adolescent had gone to take a bath by
himself in the bathroom. After 3-4 minutes, the mother
suddenly heard the adolescent screamed “mummy.” The
mother tried to open the door but it was latched from
inside. When, the adolescent's younger brother tried to
peep in through the window, it was seen that the adoles-
cent was lying still on the ﬂoor of the bathroom. They
got inside and tried to wake him up, by calling him out
loudly and by sprinkling water, but the adolescent did
not respond in any manner and remained still. After 4-5
minutes, he got up and could recall anything about the
incident. He again started asking the mother about the
incident.

Eventually, family members brought him to outpatient
department (OPD) of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP),
and he was admitted eventually in the inpatient ward. His
persistent and pervasive mood was irritable. His role func-
tioning was impaired and personal care was intact.

2.1. Mental Status Examination. Index child was kempt,
tidy, and in touch with surroundings. He was maintain-
ing eye contact, rapport was established; speech was soft,
relevant, coherent, and goal directed with normal reac-
tion time and decreased productivity. He had adequate
level of attention and concentration. Cognitive functions
were intact. His aﬀect was dysphoric, communicable, and
appropriate.

Hopelessness, pessimistic view towards future was pres-
ent in thought content, and no abnormality was detected
in perception. His social judgment was impaired with grade
II insight. The case was diagnosed as mixed-dissociative dis-
order as per the guidelines provided in the International
Classiﬁcation of Disease 10 (ICD 10).

2.2. Medical Investigation. The child had normal ﬁndings on
Computed Tomography Scan (CT-Scan) and Electroen-
cephalogram (EEG). Therefore, the possibility of seizures
was ruled out.

2.3. Baseline Psychological Tests/Rating Scale Findings

2.3.1. Wechsler’s Intelligence Scale for Children-Iv. The Full-
Scale IQ derived from the combination of all 10 subtest
scores is considered to be the most representative estimate
of global intellectual functioning. His Full-Scale IQ score is
89 which suggests a dull normal level of global intellectual
functioning.

2.3.2. The Severity of Dissociative Symptoms Scale. It also
known as Brief Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-B)—Mod-
iﬁed is an 8-item measure that assesses the severity of dissocia-
tive experiences in children ages 11–17. Each item asks the
child receiving care to rate the severity of his or her dissociative
experiences during the past 7 days. Each item on the measure is
rated on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = once or twice; 2 =
almost every day; 3 = about once a day, and 4 = more than once
a day). The raw total score can range from 0 to 32, which is
then converted into average total score by using the formula

(iii) Thought-emotion-action matter (to modify his
cognitive process and maintaining the dissocia-
tive symptoms)

(iv) Chill Out Kit (to ward oﬀ negative emotions)

(v) Parent counseling (to change dysfunctional par-

enting behaviours)

2.4.1. Rationale for Selected Mode of Therapy. Dissociation
has been found to be linked with the experience of trauma
[6]. Some authors have conceptualized dissociation as a com-
plex response to the experience of trauma that is seen as adap-
tive in the context of trauma but understood as maladaptive in
other settings [7, 8]. Therefore, treating dissociation includes
acknowledging and treating underlying trauma response.

2.4.2. Ethical Considerations. The informed consent was
sought from the child as well as the parents regarding the
adolescent’s participation in the therapy as well as its docu-
mentation after the successful completion of nine sessions.
Ethical guidelines of psychotherapy and research were
followed during intervention as well as documentation of
this case.

2.4.3. Drug Prescriptions. The adolescent was prescribed with
standardized dosage of antidepressant and antipsychotic, i.e.,
ﬂuoxetine and olanzapine in the course of treatment.

It allows the clinician to think of the severity of the child’s
brief dissociative experiences in terms of none (0), mild (1),
moderate (2), severe (3), or extreme (4). The score and impres-
sion of the index child are as follows: The baseline raw score
was 16 and the average score was 2, which indicates moderate
level of dissociation symptoms.

2.4. Management Plan

(1) Target of therapy

(i) To reduce anxiety and distress related to trauma
(ii) Increasing child’s awareness of distorted appraisal

of unwanted thoughts

(iii) To modify speciﬁc cognitive processes and
behaviours that is maintaining the dissociative
symptoms

(iv) To ward oﬀ negative emotions

(v) To change dysfunctional parenting

(2) Treatment module: Trauma-Focused Cognitive

Behaviour Therapy for Adolescents

(3) Techniques of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy

(i) Psychoeducation (to build insight about the

illness)

(ii) Relaxation (to reduce anxiety and distress

related to trauma)

2.4.4. Intervention Module. The intervention was given by
the author, who is an RCI Licensed Clinical Psychologist.
The Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy was
delivered to the indexed patient in 9 sessions with duration
of 1 hour each for a period of nine weeks in the inpatient
ward. The initial session was mainly focused on building of
therapeutic alliance with the adolescent and his mother
who was the main caregiver during the adolescent’s stay at
the inpatient ward. In the ﬁrst week, the clariﬁcation of his-
tory of presenting complaints was done with the adolescent’s
mother. The baseline assessment indicated that he has mod-
erate level of distress and dissociative symptoms. The psy-
chological causes of dissociation and role of TF-CBT in
treatment was explained in details.

The second session was focused on teaching and practic-
ing of Jacobson’s progressive muscle relaxation training,
which is one of the key techniques of TF-CBT commonly
introduced in the initial sessions. The adolescent was also
given homework to practice relaxation whenever he feels
anxious and tensed in and around the inpatient ward. In
the following week, the adolescent’s attempts at relaxation
practice were reviewed and he had practiced and reported
a temporary relief in his body and mind with each round
of JPMRT. The adolescent’s attempts at relaxation were
admired and he was further encouraged to practice it on a
daily basis.

Once the rapport was adequately established and relaxa-
tion was properly taught to the adolescent, in the next ses-
sion, his hobbies and likes were assessed. The adolescent
was passionate about science projects and had received prize
for his science project assignments at school, he liked

4

socializing with other children, and drawing was also listed
as one of his hobbies. An activity schedule was prepared
for the adolescent collaboratively, which listed science pro-
ject assignments, drawing, and interaction with other chil-
dren in the inpatient ward along with the academic tasks.
The adolescent was provide with the necessary materials
for his drawing and science projects, including, sketch pens,
drawing books, and science books from the ward stock. He
was explained in details about the activity schedule and
encouraged to follow it on a routine basis. In the fourth ses-
sion, the concept of emotion, emotional identiﬁcation, and
emotional regulation was explained to the child with the
help of emoticon stickers. He was taught to identify various
emotions and rate his own emotions on the “emotional ther-
mometer.” It was discovered that the major emotions expe-
rienced by the adolescent were anxiety and sadness, which
were mostly related to his recent loss of his brother and
uncertainty of his present condition.

In the next session, the concept of “Chill Out Kit” was
explained to the adolescent. The therapist and the adolescent
collaboratively included various activities including, draw-
ing, talking to other children, practicing relaxation, and
engaging in science projects into the child survival kit. He
was taught about ways in which he can use these activities
from the survival kit to ward oﬀ his anxiety or sadness. He
was encouraged to use his survival kit as frequently as he
can in the treatment ward. His attempts at using this kit
were routinely monitored by the therapist in the ward. The
sixth session focused on the thought aspect of TF-CBT, i.e.,
the Thought-Action-Matter. The meaning of thoughts and
its relation with emotions and action were explained to the
child with simple examples. He was explained if our
thoughts are positive then our feelings and actions are also
positive. But if our thoughts are negative, then our feelings
and actions are also negative. The therapist and the adoles-
cent worked on some activities based on Thought-Action-
Matter aimed at helping the adolescent understand the
thought-emotion link more clearly. The testing of thought
for validity and utility was done in the next session collabo-
ratively. The dominant negative thoughts including those
related to “loss of his cousin” were put to test to assess the
validity and utility of these thoughts. The adolescent was
taught to restructure the thoughts by drawing from evi-
dences “for and against” the thoughts. He was given home-
work based on the Thought-Action-Matter to deepen his
understanding, to restructure his negative thoughts, and to
develop a balanced, realistic, and adaptive thought.

In the following session, the mother was psychoeducated
to develop a right attitude towards the adolescent by impart-
ing correct information regarding nature, causes and man-
agement of dissociation with examples. An authoritarian
parenting style was found from the mother’s side. She was
explained about the harmful eﬀects of authoritarian parent-
ing including shouting, critical comments, or hitting on the
mental health of the adolescent. The mother was explained
about the need to adopt an authoritative parenting style
focused on placing reasonable demands on the adolescent
by providing him with love and care without setting unreal-
istic expectations or punishment especially in academics.

In the ninth session, the activity on “survival kit” and
“Thought-Action-Matter” was reviewed by the therapist
and its importance was summarized to the adolescent. He
was informed about the termination of the therapy and
was given the homework to write about his own story of suc-
cess, narrating about the various skills that he has learned in
therapy. The adolescent maintained a record of his activities
in survival kit and Thought-Action-Matter. It was observed
that the adolescent was actively socializing and participating
in the ward activities along with other children. The feedback
was taken from the adolescent and the mother. Signiﬁcant
improvements in dissociative episodes were reported. The
adolescent reported that he felt in control of his thoughts
and that he was now aware of the activities and techniques that
can be used to cope up and ward oﬀ distressing thoughts and
emotions. The rating scale was readministered. The post inter-
vention raw score was 2 and the average score was 0, which
indicates no dissociative symptoms.

2.5. Discussion. In the present case, the dissociative symp-
toms were precipitated after the loss of adolescent’s cousin
brother, who was perceived as a father ﬁgure by him and
was his primary support at home as well as school. The psy-
choanalytic theory postulates that the early loss of a parental
ﬁgure can lead to psychopathological symptoms in children
and also predispose them in adulthood to various psychiatric
disorders [9]. Early loss of a close member can be traumatic
and can overwhelm the coping responses of the child that
can interfere with his self-regulation mechanisms [10].
Existing literature reports that children exposed to severe,
chronic, and/or multiple-source trauma often present with
dissociative symptoms which further impact their ability to
do learn and socialize [7, 8, 11, 12]. Children who have little
parental support due to parents who are absent, over-
whelmed by their own posttraumatic stress, and dealing with
psychiatric conditions are more vulnerable to dissociation,
let alone if the caregiver is the cause of trauma [13]. In the
present case, the adolescent presented with symptoms such
as ﬂashbacks, nightmares, and memories, typically seen in
PTSD, but did not fulﬁll the criteria for a formal diagnosis
of PTSD. Moreover, as per the existing literature, dissocia-
tive symptoms may sometimes also include posttraumatic
symptoms
intrusive
such as avoidance and numbing,
thoughts and memories, nightmares, ﬂashbacks, traumatic
reenactments, and hypnagogic hallucinations [14].

There are a number of treatment modalities available for
trauma in adult population. However,
these treatment
options may not be as helpful for and adolescents as they
have a lower awareness of emotions and struggle to express
certain emotions. Given this, the Trauma-Focused Cognitive
Behaviour Therapy for adolescents based on Cohen’s model
is simpliﬁed and applicable in adolescent population with a
history of trauma. The intervention module includes parents
or caregivers as well that plays a key role in management of
psychopathology [15]. The existing literature in Trauma-
Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in and adolescents
has mainly focused on its eﬃcacy with posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSS)
wherein TF-CBT models are found to be more eﬀective at

Case Reports in Psychiatry

decreasing PTSD and PTSS than waitlist control conditions,
standard community care, child-centered therapy, and non-
directive supportive therapy [16–18].

On the other hand, the existing studies on interventions
in dissociative disorders in younger children includes play
therapy, hypnosis, storytelling, and other forms of art ther-
apy that does not require an advanced level of capacity to
process and evaluate and restructure thoughts [19–21].

The existing literature on the eﬃcacy of Trauma-
Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy on dissociation is
limited in both child as well as adolescent population.
According to the author’s knowledge, this is the ﬁrst case
study report that has demonstrated the clinical manifesta-
tion of mixed-dissociative disorder (with features of disso-
ciative amnesia, dissociative convulsion, and occasional
mood swings), and successful treatment adolescent. The
short-term goals of the current intervention were to help
to process painful memories of the loss, help him restructure
his thoughts, and regulate his emotions. The long-term goal
was to enhance the coping skills of the adolescent and pre-
vent future episodes. The ﬁndings from the case study show
that Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for ado-
lescents as set out in the manual [5, 22] is eﬀective in treating
an adolescent with dissociation.

2.6. Limitations and Future Recommendations. Since it was a
single case intervention report, the ﬁndings of the study may
not be generalizable to a larger population with dissociative
it facilitates the reader’s conclusion
disorders. However,
about its transferability in cases with similar manifestations
of dissociation. Secondly, as a part of the treatment as usual
procedure (TAU), the child was already prescribed and
adhered to psychotropic medications. Therefore, the clinical
improvements cannot be fully attributed to the nonpharma-
cological intervention, i.e., (TF-CBT) delivered in the present
case. Finally, the case report is based on a prepost interven-
tion with no follow-up observation of the case. Therefore,
the long-term eﬃcacy of the TF-CBT in the present case
could not be stated.

The future studies may focus on the eﬃcacy of TF-CBT
in adolescents in dissociative disorders with a larger sample
size along with follow-up studies.
